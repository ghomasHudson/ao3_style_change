“For my sins,” he said, dabbing his eyes with the back of one sleeve. He sniffled. “I’ve been travelling with them for a few months now. Left school to find Potter and help. Though I think I’ve done more harm than good,” he added and Bill Weasley unfolded his arms and clapped him on the shoulder.
“Focus! What about the Horcrux?” he snapped and Hermione slipped out of Ron’s arms and began gathering the fangs, her cheeks pink.
“Look for the door!” he shouted and Draco blinked through the haze of smoke. He coughed and wiped at his eyes, which made them sting.
“Madam Lestrange,” Tom murmured reverentially, tugging on his forelock as Hermione approached the bar.
with my own thoughts and feelings and personality had somehow become an Artefact of Dark Magic,” he leaned forward in his chair, elbows on his thighs, and took a deep breath, steadying himself.
“How did you know?” he asked, feeling like the memory of Rowle screaming on the floor was so distant here, like it had happened to someone else, and Potter shrugged one shoulder.
The roast potatoes had tasted like ash in Draco’s mouth, so he had only managed a few bites before putting his knife and fork down and spending the rest of the dinner staring at the place setting in front of him. Father was on his fourth glass of wine and Mother was delicately picking at the food on her plate, taking small nibbles of everything but barely eating at all.
“Did you see what happened to her?” he asked, smoothing back his cousin’s hair. Her chest was so still, her eyelids did not flicker. He could see that they shared the same nose, the same chin.
"I want to. They're my sons too," he said and Harry felt a wave of rage sweep over him.
“Alright. But – why?” he asked and Draco shrugged.
“Read it!” he shouted, pulling something free from inside and storming back over, shoving a piece of parchment in front of her, nearly upending Weasley’s bowl of soup. “Read it! Dumbledore has the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one.” His hands shook so hard that something jumped out of the pouch and rolled away, heading towards Draco, who leaned down and picked it up.
“Dobby was already on his way out when Tizzy found him. I’d seen Potter in the mirror, in the dungeons,” Aberforth explained, then he looked around as though searching for the elf. “Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him?” he asked and Draco’s heart dropped. He slumped into an armchair opposite Hermione, who gave him a weak smile.
“Dream of me often, do you?” he asked, crossing his arms over his chest and Potter smiled. It was genuine and Draco thought of the times he had often seen Potter smile from across the Great Hall, the corners of his eyes wrinkling, the corners of his mouth quirking upwards. There had been times where he had wanted desperately to have that smile turned on him, but it never had been.
They arrived at the top of the staircase to find it was already open, waiting for them. Regardless, Draco rapped on the wood with his knuckles and waited until Snape called for them to ‘Enter’. Draco stepped inside first and held the door open for Isobel, who inclined her head briefly in thanks. The Headmasters office was covered, wall-to-wall, in portraits of the previous Headmasters and Headmistresses. Most dozed in their frames, one was playing solitaire, and the large portrait behind Snape hung empty. Bookcases lined the wall they had entered from, and even with a quick glance, Draco could see books missing from the shelves, gaps that had been previously filled.
“Me as well!”
“I’ve been to my aunt's vault once before,” Draco told the goblin, who gave him an unimpressed look. “I visited with my father, as he was her trustee during her incarceration. I know how to get in. You can’t stop us,” he said and the goblin had bared his teeth at Draco.
“Funny ‘ow they all thinks we wants to ‘ear’ that,” Scabior said mockingly from the shadows. “But none of ‘em can tell us where the common room is,” he added and Draco’s stomach dropped, his heart skipped a beat. There was no way Potter could answer them, no way he knew where –
Without a second thought, Harry reached over with his other hand and placed it firmly on Malfoy's stomach. He tilted his body inwards, towards Malfoy, angling his legs so that their knees locked together. Malfoy's grip on his hand tightened for a brief second, and then relaxed.
“The battle is won. You have lost your fighters. My Death Eaters–” Draco didn’t hear anymore. He covered his ears and tucked his head down, shaking it. Harry could not be dead. Harry could not be
“Stay here,” Draco told her and she gave him a slightly offended look. “Stay safe, they’ll be all right,” he tried to reassure her, but she didn’t look convinced.
’, finishing the chapter on Ancient Macedonian Wizards that had travelled with Alexander the Great. Hephaestion had always been something of an idol to Draco.
freed Dobby! He was my favourite elf!” he said in outrage and Potter laughed even harder. Draco grumbled to himself and took another bite of his sandwich.
's rose up around them. Hermione pressed a hand to her mouth as Rose and Hugo leaned out of a window to wave, and Albus and Scorpius joined them in their compartment, leaning out of the window as well. Ron gave a sniff and waved back, while Harry reached for Draco's hand and laced their fingers together.
"Harry," he said and Harry turned back to look at him. "What do we do tomorrow? I mean - what can we do?" he asked, his voice desperate and Harry stared at him, feeling very lost.
“Sir?” Draco asked Amycus, not wanting to believe what he had heard.
“The Dark Lord is most displeased with Rowle,” Mother said to him over breakfast, taken in her small drawing room off her bedroom. The elves had brought them eggs and toast and bowls of fruit but Draco could only nibble on one corner of buttered toast and the rest made his stomach roil.
“It’s too late for that,” he said with finality. He lifted one shaking hand and pressed it to his head, closing his eyes again. “He knows where it is. He’s there now.”
“It’ll be ok,” he whispered to Potter and Potter only groaned horribly. Draco squeezed his eyes shut.
“Ron’s taken her inside. She’ll be all right,” he told Harry kindly, and he nodded and turned to look back down at the body of the house-elf in his lap. Draco watched as he pulled the knife free from Dobby’s chest and then Potter shucked his jacket and laid it over him like a blanket.
“No,” he said curtly, brushing down his coat. “Let’s keep looking,” he said and he turned away, looking a little pained. Draco smiled at him a little, though he could not see it, and they parted again, searching among the stones.
"Go on," he murmured and she frowned and sighed.
“I’ll get it when we leave,” he said and she sniffed but took the cloak and tucked it carefully inside the bag.
“Bring him in, quickly!” she said in a high, quivering voice, and the group was forced up the stone steps and into the entrance hall. Draco blinked in the harsh light and then his mother was on him, patting his face, stroking back his hair. “Oh, Draco! Release him, at once!” she snapped at the Snatchers and a few of them hesitated but Greyback gave a short nod and they released Draco’s bindings, though they rebound the remaining five prisoners to each other.
“I… I know things now. Things I didn’t know before. I have to go,” he said, his voice firm but low. “I wanted to go without saying goodbye. I know Ron and Hermione will try to stop me. I know you will,” he said and Draco felt anger flare within him.
“He was in your grasp, Rowle, in
Though he was incorporeal, Draco threw himself out of the way as guests began running in all directions. Through the crowd, he could see Granger looking around the room desperately. At her side was a redhead, some sort of Weasley cousin Draco suspected. A sharp crack sounded, and Draco realised that the family had put protective charms around their land and those charms had now broken.
“Might as well make sure the world knows,” Crabbe suggested and then they were on him. Draco hadn’t been fast enough to dodge out of their way, tired as he was, and Goyle caught him around the middle, sending the both of them crashing to the floor. Crabbe flipped him over and pinned him down with one knee to the middle of his chest, holding him in place. Draco coughed and wheezed and tried to push Crabbe off him, but the other boy was much stronger than he was, and weighed much more as well, built solidly of muscle that Draco never expected to be used against him.
“Are you alright, Harry?” Longbottom was saying, hovering nearby. Harry’s eyes took a second to focus on Draco and then he turned as Longbottom continued to speak. “Want to sit down? I expect you’re tired, aren’t–?”
They Apparated back into the Bodleian Library, pulling on their gowns as they exited and once again joined their applicants in the atrium, picking up their badges for the second day of exams. Harry spotted Malfoy leaning against one of the walls, and he caught Harry’s eye before giving a small smile and then ducking his head down again, frowning.
“About Harry? Yes, I do. I also know you were the one telling her while she was in her beetle Animagus form,” she said and Draco blanched. Hermione giggled. “I caught her and kept her in a jar for three days,” she said with a grin and Draco gaped at her. Hermione shrugged. “She hurt Harry. She lied about Hagrid. I wasn’t going to let her fly free to ruin more lives,”
“Well done Harry!” Ron said cheerfully and Harry thanked him. “Hold on, Hermione’s just getting her letter opener,” Ron said in a teasing tone, and Harry could hear Hermione’s snappish reply. Ron laughed. “She wants to preserve the envelope, just in case,” he told Harry, who smiled. There was a pause and then Hermione gave another happy shriek. “She-,” and then there was the sound of a lip-smacking kiss, which made Harry draw back a bit.
And then he had left them. Alone, in the middle of Kings Cross, students and parents and muggles alike bustling around them.
and Draco froze, wand raised but no further noises came.
“I miss her, but not like that,” Potter finally said, and Draco nodded a bit shakily. They lapsed into silence then, the only noise the fluttering of the Snitch’s wings as it leapt from Potter’s open hand and circled around their heads once more.
“We need it. For what we’re doing now. We need the book,” he said firmly and Draco shut his mouth. He took a steading breath.
“I asked one of the Malfoy elves to get Dobby,” he said but Aberforth waved a hand at him.
“You’re asleep next to me,” he said and Potter nodded. He was sitting cross-legged on the dark floor and Draco joined him, sitting opposite so that they were nearly knee-to-knee. “Do you remember these dreams?” he asked and Potter shrugged one shoulder.
“Told you! Viktor Krum was right!” he crowed at Granger, who turned around to scowl at him, but she turned her attention back to Draco.
A few deep breaths later, and he felt like he could speak. He lowered his hand and looked up to find that Potter had crouched in front of him, so that their eyes were nearly at level. He leaned back.
“What are we going to do then, Harry?” Finnigan asked, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “What’s the plan?” he said and Harry blinked at him.
“Where are we?” Harry called out from behind them and Longbottom answered.
“Harry! Oh Harry, congratulations! Ron, go check, have I had a letter?” Hermione asked breathlessly and Harry could hear Ron grumbling, but there his voice disappeared from the line. “He’s just gone. Oh Harry, really, I’m so pleased! When is it?” she asked, and Harry glanced at the calendar on the kitchen wall.
His Patronus, a Snowy Owl, swooped once, twice, overhead, and then landed softly on the alcove behind him. Draco whirled around to watch her and she clipped her beak at him, hooted softly, and then faded. His heart in his throat, he turned to Potter, beaming.
“Of course not, of course not!” he said impatiently and he let go of Draco’s arm to move closer to Potter, bending slightly to be at eye-level with him. Draco drew back, allowing his mother to wrap her arms around him once more.
“You heard what she said – go on, Malfoy,” he said with a sneer and Draco, hands shaking despite him trying to mask it, stood and left the classroom, leaving his satchel behind.
Malfoy’s whole body tensed. “Maybe I’m keeping someone else’s bed warm, Potter,” he said with a sneer. “Can’t you mind your own business?”
Listening to the moans of pleasure next door, he realized the sub must be in handcuffs. Briefly, Harry wondered if the Wallbanger would be better at playing his Dom. He blushed furiously at the thought and reminded himself that he was supposed to be asleep, and therefore, supposed to be upset with his neighbor, not fantasizing.
Harry shifted uncomfortably and said, "Can I help you?"
Harry gave a humorless laugh, "What about the Muggle-born Registration Commission? Surely that wasn't legal?"
Hermione smiled down at him then looked back to Harry, "It's the right thing to do."
He jumped off the bed where he'd been laying down thinking of how to handle the mess he'd gotten himself into with Draco. Blaise had a fairly good idea of where these thoughts were headed and he needed to get out of this room before-
You guys make it worth it <3
He leaned against a counter that was selling a sticky sweet muggle version of Butterbeer, that was woefully lacking any alcohol, and surveyed the scene. Draco had listened in on several conversations throughout the night, even joined a few, and decided that there was nothing to worry about. Well, nothing new, at any rate. Some of these muggles did believe the stories were true, but most of them were convinced it was fantasy. As long as the Ministry kept watch over early experiences of accidental magic they wouldn’t need to worry about growing fame of the Harry Potter series.
"Apologies, Ginerva," Blaise said, holding back the smirk at her grimace. He lifted his eyes. "Dean, I was wondering if you might be interested in a proposal from me?"
Pansy took a long, slow, deep breath and said, "Is there anything you're not useless at?"
Draco gave a fleeting glance towards their destination, then looked back at her, “It is indeed.”
he answered,
with Draco to end, but knowing he didn't have a way to draw it out without being obvious. Finally, he said, "Yes, I think I'm ready."
Anna chewed at her lip, considering. "Is it a charity that specifically helps muggleborns?"
Loire turned to Draco and looked him over for a long moment, "You would be the best choice, your defensive work has been top level so far, but I'm afraid you will have to sit this one out. It's not that I don't trust you, but this exercise might make it difficult for you to stay impartial."
Dudley put a hand down to keep her behind him, still looking at Draco, "I can prove it, let me show you my phone."
Harry rolled his eyes. He knew Malfoy was sleeping on the couch in the common room when he wasn’t in their room because he always checked the map. Not that he cared about where Malfoy slept, he just wanted to make sure that he wasn’t up to something. Though Harry knew that was unlikely, Malfoy was so subdued with everyone else that the only thing he was likely ‘up to’ was avoidance.
Astrid leaned in to pat his hand, which was now gripping the steering wheel instead of his normal casual hold. “I told you I won’t go anywhere unsupervised, and I will keep my phone with me, ok?” she waited for him to nod before continuing, “I will see you on Sunday at 10am and we can go to family brunch.”
"Yeah," Harry replied, a little surprised that Draco seemed inclined to small talk with him. "I have an appointment with the Wizengamot on Monday. Yourself?"

(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione sighed, “I have, though I’m pretty sure he’s still waiting for me to come around.” She looked around the common room, then back at him. “Do you really not know if you find men attractive?”
"I didn't even know you could do that."
Two months later Draco sat at his desk writing out a theoretical potions formula for dreamless sleep. His first cousin, once removed, Felix Rosier, had helped him get the paperwork through the ministry to open the apothecary. He has a small shop on the tail end of Diagon Alley, just before it turned down Knockturn. The only thing Felix had asked for in payment was a steady supply of healing potions specializing in counteracting the effects of Peruvian vipertooth venom.
"Understandable," Draco replies, thinking of his own aversion to the Ministry, "but retail?"
Harry grinned, looked up, the head of a cock barely pressed to his bottom lip, and asked, "What was that?"
He thought.
Harry bit his tongue, not wanting to take out his frustration on anyone else. Halloween was a month away, that's too long. Maybe he should learn Occlumancy. He pushed the thought away. Tonight was about having fun and acting like a normal teenager, not worrying about stray thoughts.
He growled in her direction and threw himself on a plush red rug that was spread out in front of the fireplace. He looked up, his eyes on a mural painted on the ceiling above him. It was a painting of cats bounding around after pigmy puffs, but Harry's thoughts were only on Draco. As time passed, he ran through several plans of escape. Dismissing them as needed and filing others away for further review, just in case they needed to run.
“Hang on!” Pansy’s voice calls to him from the banister and Draco starts to breathe again. He takes a moment to come back to himself. He doesn’t have panic attacks very often anymore, but his survival instincts have never fully received the message about the war being over.
Professor Loire lifted a brow at him, leaned forward, and placed a copy of the
photographer in the building. Even if there's not, this will be enough to start a few rumors.
“Why did you order it to go?”
Harry couldn't help it, he chuckled at the ridiculousness of the whole thing. "I'm sorry you're caught up in this," he said. "I'm guessing you will find a way for me to make it up to you during the school year though?" He hoped that would warm her up to the idea, even though he wasn't sure that it was sane to offer.
"Er…" Ron replied.
A slight blush tinged Harry's cheeks and he fought to keep it from going full down his neck as he remembered the prefects bathroom in 4th year. "Fine," he amended, "I've never messed around with anyone in Gryffindor."
“Potter,” Draco said wearily, backing away from him. “We do not have time-”
"Is that your shirt?" she mouths the words, instead of speaking them, thankfully. They are far too close to Hermione for her to whisper quietly enough.
“Harry.” Hermione steps through the floo into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. She leans into the hallway and calls up the stairs, “Harry, are you here?”
Harry bit down hard enough to leave a mark on his pulse point. He didn't want any confusion about why Draco wouldn't be taking clients for two months. Or ever, if Harry had his way.
At the time, Hermione had taken offense, arguing that she was not ‘a fragile woodland creature,’ and ‘woman can wear more than pink,’ and ‘can’t a female dress for reasons other than looking pretty’.
, Scorpius thought.
"Focus, Potter," Draco said, pinching Harry's nipple.
Draco hummed in approval and Harry finally made it to his eyes.
Harry and Draco walked through the door to the Headmistress' office to see McGonagall standing stiffly behind her desk.
"Oh stop it," Hermione said through an embarrassed laugh as she went back to her desk. "Nothing is going on behind Ron's back, Harry."
After the Gryffindors left, Blaise and Draco stood in silence, staring at the door.
Remember - Harry's thoughts are in bold and italic, Blaise's thoughts are only italic.
Malfoy swallows thickly as though he’s fighting his own reply. Finally he says, “I’m sure you have plenty of fans willing to take you out for the gala. Krum would probably fly in from Bulgaria if you asked nicely.”
When Astrid walked into the kitchen she found Harry standing by the granite counter pouring tea from a kettle. He was in pajama bottoms and a long sleeved shirt made from thin material.
Seamus walked to the foot of Harry’s bed. “So,” he said, then seemed to stall out. This had been happening more and more often with Seamus since they had gotten back to Hogwarts.
"Pansy?"
Harry met his eye, guilt and lust written in every feature, "You want this? Are you sure? Because I'm not really great at casual encounters."
Draco is thrown by the suggestion at first until his mother practically materializes into the room and swiftly lifts Teddy from his lap. She smiles knowingly and Draco and says, “I will take him to his room. You can come to see him again tomorrow, he’s expecting you to be here in the afternoon.” Her eyes flick to Potter then back to Draco, “Have fun tonight.” With that, she sweeps from the room, Teddy, still sporting the Malfoy hair color, in her arms.
“Draco calm down, this isn’t a big deal.”
"What?" Neville squeaked out, once he could breathe.
“I honestly hadn’t considered that.” Harry’s brows cinched together. He was not going to talk about the war. He and Draco had done that conversation, more than once, years ago. The first time had been after the war trials, and Harry hadn’t been able to think through the conversation. The last time was when Draco showed up for Teddy’s twelfth birthday party. They’d both given apologies for previous transgressions and come to the decision that they should be cordial.
Blaise smirked, guessing Potter had discussed that phrasing with Hermione. He wondered if Hermione had bought it. Blaise sure as fuck didn't, he had heard too many thoughts to buy that lie.
Harry's eyebrows rose up at that, "Really?" he asked, watching the tips of Draco's ears go pink. "Maybe your job should be to study me then," he said, leaning in to bite Draco's ear lobe, assaulted with scent of citrus soap and expensive cologne.
Harry grabbed Draco's collar and barely glimpsed the Malfoy smirk before their lips met in a bruising kiss. Every fantasy Harry had had about this moment was shoved aside as second rate when compared to the real thing. For one thing, in Harry's fantasies, they were the same height, but he found he liked that the Slytherin had a few inches on him. Draco's kiss was heated, and passionate but precise. His talented mouth took control of the kiss with perfect pressure of tongue and teeth. When Draco's fingers ran through Harry's hair, Harry took the opportunity to press their bodies together and run his hands along Draco's body touching as much as he could. He moaned into Draco's mouth when his erection made contact with Draco's thigh.
The burst of laughter from Neville echoed in the small stairway, wrapping around Harry like a hug. "I can't believe you two are still like that. I want to touch Blaise a lot but you two are just as bad now as you were in 8th year."
Draco's grip strengthens and he pulls Harry into a possessive kiss.
“No one’s here. I mean, no reporters.”
With a brief glance to Blaise and Neville, Potter stepped up close to Draco. Blaise watched closely, noting his friends measured breathing and calm exterior. Only the fluttering pulse point of his pale neck gave away how fast his heart was beating. Blaise heard Potter speaking in low tones but he couldn't make out the words. He might have leaned closer, out of pure curiosity, if Neville hadn't distracted him with a touch.
Draco took another drink and his expression went back to relaxed, "Slytherin," he said simply, "I was-"
Harry saw a flash of heat in those silver eyes before Draco said, "I'm sure I can manage, Potter. Tomorrow."
Unspeakable Malfoy,
"After the stunt Potter pulled last night you better have something planned if you want to get even."
"I'm not even going to try and unpack that." Draco held up the note from Hermione. "He came to give me this."
"I'll have the house elves bring something up," Potter said.
"I know 'Mione but we are all of age and there's no rules against it." Harry smiled as he watched Hermione grimace. "Don't worry. If it works well for a week I'll submit a formal request, all right?" At least that seemed to appease her.
“It’s a selfish act, I assure you,” Draco replied, reaching out to roughly tug on Harry’s shirt. “I want you before we go out.”
"She saved my life," Harry replied defensively.
Pansy looked at him again, her face full of concern, "Are all of your friends like her? Is this what I should expect from the Savior's posse?"
Harry considered that for a moment, “The entire manor?”
"I've heard Slytherins get on quite well with puffs in relationships."
“I thought you were upset, I thought you were going to confront me about-” she cuts herself off. Draco doesn’t think he’s seen her look this nervous since she asked him the Yule ball. He lays a hand on her knee.
Draco seemed to pick up on his cue, as he offered up the bird to Ron who took it in a daze.
Scorpius watched Harry’s eyes go wide at the offer. "Draco…" Harry said, hesitating.
"Your glasses, Potter," Draco said, in between kisses.
Pansy looked down at the plaque it read 'Pots and Pans'.
Draco answered and looked Harry over with slow hungry eyes, "Good morning."
Children who were magically inclined were now contacted at first sign of accidental magic. Draco felt that was a better move in the Ministry's part. In fact, Draco had not only been a believer in bringing muggleborn children into the wizarding world at a younger age, he had funded a good portion of the programs.
"Tired? Worn thin?" Harry offered with a self-deprecating smile. "I am. Any chance you could ring the Undersecretary and see if she can help me?"
Harry's
Harry gave a weak smile in return, "Yeah, but I don't think we're even allowed to miss the sorting ceremony. Three hours of my life I'll never get back."
Harry swallowed through his dry throat, summoned his famed courage, and finished the sentence, "I want to build my future with him."
"Of course, Professor."
Harry shrugged, "It belonged to someone important to me." He looked down at his nearly empty glass, shrugged, and said, "He hated it here, but I feel closer to him, ya know?"
"Bi, actually," Draco quickly cuts in.
Three hours and a shared order of fish and chips later the waiter approaches with the bill. He's tall and slim with a sly smile and hungry eyes, and he's been flirting with Draco since they arrived. If this were any other night, or if he was in anyone else's company, Draco would certainly take him home. Maybe share him with Pansy. But it's not any other night, and he's with Potter. Potter, who bristles every time the waiter approaches, who speaks to him with a tight smile and glaring green eyes.
paparazzi had ever managed to take of him. The first few pictures had been awkward. The people would hold up their phone and push the buttons, then look at the picture and pout. Finally, a girl with dark eyeliner and purple streaks in her hair had fixed the issue.
"You have a lot of nerve walking around like you're welcome. They don't want you here, Death Eater," Zach said, spitting out the last two words.
Potter rests his forehead on Draco's shoulder. "I appreciate your vote of confidence but I'm no match for Hermione. Especially vengeful Hermione. Ron's lucky he's not being kept in a jar like Skeeter."
"Yeah, I noticed that. Are we actually going to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes?"
"I-" Malfoy's mouth opened and closed a couple times before he said, "I've not really thought about it."
Her assistant is sitting dutifully at the large desk in front of Hermione's closed-door office and she smiles when Hermione walks up. "Morning boss," Pansy says. "Your notes for the meeting are on your desk along with a bouquet of multicolored Cape Jasmines."
" Ok," Draco said, "Let's go to the garden patio then."
Finally, Friday evening came. After dinner, she pulled on her ankle boots, said goodbye to Joanna, her mom, and hopped in the car, not even attempting to hide her excitement.
Now it was McGonagall's eyebrow that lifted at him.
"Some tea," she said warily. "Harry, I know you're, you know, rebelling or whatever and I'm supportive of that, but this," she looked back at Draco, "this is not…" She trailed off.
"What are you doing?!" he whispered fiercely over the increasing sound of heavy breathing.
“Just to recap,” Pansy said, her dark hair swinging against her jawline as she turned to Blaise, “you think the Savior is trying to cockblock you?”
A hand gripped tightly at Harry's waist, long elegant fingers pressing heat through Harry's shirt.
“You’ve told Ron, yeah?” he asked, not wanting one of his best friends left in the dark.
Draco whispered a spell,
"Hello, Harry," Anna said.
Ron, still blushing slightly, tried for the upper hand, "I didn't think you'd be interested in the details of my bed, mate."
He thought.
“You know what I mean.”
he thought.
Draco stepped through the door to find Potter on the ground, his body stretched taught, held up by only his toes, and his forearms against a blue mat on the floor. He wasn't wearing a shirt and the muscles along his back were tense, glistening with a sheen of sweat.
"What is the matter with you?" Emily asked, wrenching her arm out of Draco's grasp once they were alone.
A light layer of bubbles spread out from the wand, quickly covering the surface. This was perfect. The bubbles were multi colored, giving up a scent of lavender and cinnamon. Best of all, you couldn’t see through them.
There were noises of agreement, though Hermione’s could also have been of protest, and then Harry shouted “NOW!” and let go.
“Yeah… it could be…” Potter muttered and Granger let out a frustrated huff and withdrew her wand from the inner pocket of her jacket, lighting it without a word. Even by the light from the wand, the stone was still barely legible, but even so, Granger pointed it at the stone.
“The Dark Lord?” he asked and Potter nodded. Draco felt his heart sink in his chest. “But if he has… pieces of his soul floating about, he’d be… well, he’d be immortal essentially,” he said quietly into the silent clearing and eventually Granger gave a sombre nod. Draco slumped a little where he sat. “Merlin,” he breathed finally and Granger nodded. “Do you know what you’re looking for?” he asked eventually and Potter squirmed where he sat.
"Wherever they are, you'll find them, Mr. P," she said kindly, and then the office door was flung open as Ron and Hermione came running in. Hermione was on him in a second, knelt over him and pulling him into a hug, her body shaking. Ron stood nearby, looking pale, his freckles standing out starkly against his skin. Belinda patted his shoulder as she left, pulling the door closed behind her.
The portraits were silent, many of them empty, as though their inhabitants had either sought shelter elsewhere or were off celebrating with friends in far flung corners of the castle. Somewhere, distantly, Peeves was singing;
It had been quiet when Draco had visited with Pansy and Blaise in August, but now it was silent. Boarded up windows lined the street, the store fronts shuttered and discarded newspapers paved the cobbled road. From most lampposts and windows, Harry’s face watched from Wanted posters. Crouched in doorways, huddled together for warmth, were people dressed in ragged and torn robes, their faces in rictus’ of desperation.
“It’s very brave of them,” Hermione said, standing and heading for the kitchen. “If they were found…'' she said, trailing off and Weasley shrugged.
“I thought you might have one,” Potter said without any preamble. He sounded curious rather than resentful, and Draco shivered as Potter lightly traced the curve of the snake with the tip of one finger. He looked tired, and his hair was a riot of curls, his t-shirt lightly grimy as though he hadn’t been able to do any laundry for a while. He met Draco’s gaze and settled back on his heels, allowing Draco to sit up.
“Wait,” Draco whispered and Hermione gave him a shocked look. The pieces were joining up now. That moment on the Astronomy Tower.
“Harry, here!” Granger called and Draco whipped around to look at her. She was two rows of tombstones away from Potter and he had already begun to wade over to her, lifting his knees high to get through the heavy snow. Draco followed, his heart pounding.
He cast a quick look around and then ducked around the sign, crouching to lift the stone. A scrap of a pamphlet had been stuck to the bottom of it, crumpled and caked with sodden dirt, but Draco peeled it off and wiped the dirt away.
“Draco–” Snape began but Draco cut him off once more.
“Are you sure he never mentioned–?” she asked and Potter shook his head, rising to stand straight and cutting her off.
“He has,” he said finally, his eyes catching Draco’s over the firelight, dark and intense, and Draco took a second to understand what he was saying, before gaping at him.
“And… and it went? Just like that?” she whispered and Weasley swallowed and nodded his head.
and went in search of Pansy and Blaise.
He chased them. He dove around spells and curses, his body incorporeal and moved by a force that Draco couldn’t quite control. It was like he was standing in place and the scene was just moving around him. The motorbike dodged and wove and all the while, Potter was still holding onto that cage, his dead owl sprawled across the bottom, her amber eyes open and unseeing. Draco watched with a sinking feeling in his stomach as the metal joints between the sidecar and the motorbike began to fail, and he spun out of the way of a stunning spell that Potter sent flying, missing the moment when the sidecar finally gave way. He dove to help in some way, but as he was immaterial, the sidecar went careening to the ground past him, the metal of the owl’s cage catching the light of the spells that darted through the night sky. Potter had been saved by Hagrid, hauled onto the back of the motorbike by the collar of his shirt, so they were sitting back to back. Draco watched as a pained expression went across Potter’s face as he raised his wand and pointed it at the falling sidecar, the cage and body of his owl still inside.
“Then we shall begin. Fellow Braithwaite, I believe you had a question regarding Mr Potter’s answer in General I?” he said, looking across the circle and the Fellow sat there nodded.
Behind them, the Aurors were springing into action, some firing spells at the mirror, others alerting the Mediwizards on standby. Distantly, Harry could hear Hermione crying and Ron sniffling, but there were more important things to focus on, like his family before him. A bit battered and bruised, but finally whole.
A house-elf stood in front of him, wearing a toga made of a tea-towel with the Hogwarts crest embroidered on it. The house-elf blinked at him with large blue eyes, and then offered out a glass tumbler filled with a clear liquid.
“So, what brings you to Diagon Alley this early, Bellatrix?” Travers asked and Hermione cast a glance at the Gringotts building in the distance.
“An unbeatable wand might be a nice addition. This one barely works for me, I much preferred Draco's” Potter said with a bitter bite from over by the bunks. He was twirling the pale wood wand in his hands, thinking. Hermione threw her hands up in the air in exasperation.
“Why are you talking to me now?” he asked and Snape raised an eyebrow. His dark eyes were endless voids in the noon light of the Orangery, absorbing all warmth around them and reflecting back the coolness of the Black Lake in winter. Draco held his gaze though, rage gnawing at his insides, betrayal as well. “Where have you been all summer? Where have you been since June?” His insides twisted as the hurt tasted acidic in his mouth. “Where were you when I needed you?” he asked and Snape looked pained, his eyebrows drawing together, his lips pursing.
With trembling legs he stood and looked around the room he found himself in. It was a dusty, sawdust-strewn bar. He felt a sneeze building in his nose and choked it down. The front door to the bar was still open and Draco ducked down behind the counter, crouched in a dark corner until he heard the door shut and then the scrape of the lock being bolted again.
Whether it had been by Potter’s touch or his presence alone, a sign was now rising out of the ground in front of them, through the weeds and snow. It creaked as it raced towards them and then let out of soft groan as it settled, and the gold letters on the wooden placard read;
By the time they reached Bellatrix’s vault, sopping wet and a little breathless having just fallen 60 feet, Draco was about ready to go home. The Transfigurations that Hermione had placed on Weasley and Draco had been washed away in the Thief’s Downfall, along with Hermione’s Polyjuiced form. Thanks to Harry’s quick thinking, Bogrod, the goblin that was leading them down to the vault had been Imperio’d once more, and with some trepidation, Draco watched as Harry pressed the goblin’s hand to the wooden door of the vault. It melted away at once and they stepped gingerly into the vault, which was dark and cool.
Once their tea was ready, she handed him the mug with half a teaspoon of sugar and sat down next to him, wrapping both her hands around her own mug. She stared into her tea for a second, before she began to speak.
The pub was a bit fuller than it had been the day before, and they found a table towards the back of the pub, all of them slumping down heavily. Harry felt a headache growing behind his eyes and took off his glasses briefly to pinch the bridge of his nose, attempting to alleviate the pressure.
"Harry - the boys, they've not… The Trolley Witch, she reported them missing from the train about 5 minutes ago," she said and the bottom fell out of Harry's stomach.
The glowing Dark Mark had gone, leaving the night sky studded with stars. Dumbledore waited for him. He looked like his portrait, whole and healthy, his hands folded over his long beard. He did not look like the half-dead man Draco had once confronted in this very place.
“No,” he murmured, sinking to his knees, the groan chorused by Ron and Hermione just behind him, their voices filled with agony. Hagrid, the half-giant, stood in the centre of the courtyard flanked by Death Eaters, cradling the limp and lifeless body of Harry.
“Have you not gone up?” he asked her and she raised an eyebrow at him.
“Why should we trust you?” Potter asked and Draco blinked at him. He and Potter had been meeting in dreams for months now, surely Potter had learned to trust him. But maybe Potter didn’t remember his dreams? Maybe he had no recollection of what they had spoken about in all this time.
“Very well. When are we going?” he asked and the plans began.
“I need to get a book from the library. I’ll see you in Charms,” he told them both, not looking at them, before walking away briskly. As he passed the group of Hufflepuffs, one of them started to sob in earnest, and he turned his face away, hot shame flooding through him.
“The office is currently occupied,” it replied, without actually answering the question. Draco had to assume it meant that Harry was in there, and with a huff, he sat down next to the entrance. The gargoyle peered at him out of the corner of its eyes but then snapped them closed again.
It was only because he was practically lying on Harry that he noticed, but all of a sudden Harry went rigid underneath Draco, his muscles seizing. Draco sat bolt upright.
Thankfully, the tent collapsed with a tap of his wand and wrapped itself up tightly again so he could easily stow it in the backpack. He pulled down the wards and went to splash his face with cold water from the lake, taking a second in the cold light of day to check the Dark Mark – it had faded to a dark angry colour, but no longer burned as black as it had in the night.
“I thought you did very well,” she said under his breath and Draco just gaped at her as Amycus forced Longbottom to kneel on the classroom floor and then raise his own wand.
“Well, your complexion has slipped from Elegantly Pale to Sun-Deprived Pasty,” Pansy Parkinson said as she looked him up and down in Diagon Alley two weeks later. She leaned close to kiss him on the cheek and he took a second to breathe her in. Bergamot. Citrus.
Deeper into the graveyard they went, stopping now and then to peer at headstones and overground tombs, dusting off the snow to check the names. Draco kept an eye out in the surrounding darkness, squinting to make sure they weren’t being followed.
I was treated the way I was as a child,” one of the Fellows sniffed and Harry caught her discreetly wiping her eyes. He leaned back in the chair, spreading his hands wide. “I think my fascination with History, in
“Where are you going?” she asked and Draco waved one hand at her, hoping she wouldn’t follow.
“If you’re tired Harry, I can show you where the guest room is,” she offered and Harry gave her a smile.
Griphook’s gravelly voice came through the crack in the door. “No. It is a fake,” he said solemnly and Potter let out a shaky breath next to him.
Back in the present, before he could say anything further, there was a knock on the door. Malfoy slid away from the desk and settled himself onto the sofa, picking up a stray file and opening it. Harry watched him for a second, before waving his hand at the door - it opened with a click, revealing Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Luna behind it. They trooped into the office like soldiers reporting for duty, but Hermione broke away from the group and went behind Harry's desk to pull him into a hug.
“I figured as much. My Mark burned most of the night,” he interrupted, not wanting to think on those minutes of fear, squeezing Potter’s arm so that he realised that Draco was still holding on to it. He changed the subject. “Hermione’s asleep. She wanted to wait until you were awake but she was falling asleep standing. Do you want me to wake her?” he asked and Potter glanced over his shoulder at the closed off area where Hermione slept. He hesitated but then shook his head.
“Oh, good. Budge up,” Potter slurred, and Draco shuffled back against the canvas of the tent as Potter moved to lie down next to him, tugging up a blanket that had been draped over his legs. He offered his hand a bit clumsily, nearly slapping it into Draco’s side, but Draco took it anyway, curling their hands together in the awkward space between them on the bed. “Sleep,” Potter murmured, his eyes already closed, and Draco closed his eyes too.
“He fell off a sofa in the common room, Madam Pomfrey, and I’m concerned he might have hit his head,” Blaise said smoothly and Draco nodded. Pomfrey sighed and lifted her wand, lighting only the tip.
"I've contacted the Auror Office separately but currently - we don't know where they are," she said and Harry's whole world slid sideways, panic gripping at his throat.
Albus.
,” he said and Potter nodded, weaving his way around the bed to stand in the middle of the room. Draco followed him. “Is she safe, at least? Are
“He literally just summoned a goat Patronus outside, Ron,” Draco said exasperatedly and Ron deflated a little. Aberforth gave Draco an amused look.
“I’m sure it is. They’ll–” She swallowed a little and Draco followed her gaze to the churchyard. He could see the dark line of gravestones peeking out from behind it. “They’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it,” she said. Potter hesitated, his arm convulsing a little and Draco tightened his grip on his shoulder, enough to depress the fabric of Potter’s coat a little. Potter was staring at the graveyard like it held everything he had ever wanted and everything he had ever feared. He looked frozen to the spot and Draco had to dodge out of the way slightly as a villager came slipping past, apologising for nearly colliding with Potter and Granger.
“- an’ Dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been kissed first!” and from the other Death Eaters, there were noises of agreement. Draco sank back further into the wall and tried not to panic.
!” Blaise said and his forearm seared cold and hot, causing Draco to gag again until it stopped and his arm no longer burned with pain. “It’s not bleeding so much now,” Blaise murmured, dropping his arm.
“Uhm?” he asked, sounding as un-Malfoy-like as Harry had ever heard, and Harry laughed, drawing back a little bit.
“I’ve been with Harry,” Draco said wearily. He flexed the hand connected to the ruined forearm and the skin pulled, which made him hiss in pain. Blaise gave him a grim smile.
Draco was on his front pulling his backpack out from under Potter’s bed when a strange whirring sound echoed. He looked up and froze.
A large canvas tent was pitched on a flat plain under a sprawling tree, and a campfire crackled merrily a few feet outside the entrance. Sat on the forest floor next to the fire, his wand out and trained on Draco, was Potter. Draco’s knees nearly gave way at seeing him.
“So, you were studying in France?” Hermione asked, lifting the pint that Harry had bought her to her mouth. Malfoy nodded, pouring the last of the contents of the can into the glass carefully, like he was measuring out a potions ingredients. He looked up once he was done, setting the empty can to one side. Every moment was careful and calculated, Harry realised. Malfoy never made a move without it being deliberate.
Please be aware that some dialogue in this chapter has been taken directly from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by JK Rowling. These words do not belong to me, and I do not claim them as my own.
“What did you do, Baron?” he asked quietly and the Baron turned so that half his silver face was cast in shadow.
“That’s fair. We can just sit here for a while. I think you’re keeping the nightmares at bay,” he replied, looking over Draco’s shoulder at something in the distance. Draco settled back and they sat there in silence for a long time after.
"Like you don't know," he replied, and Malfoy looked over at him, placing the book back on top of the pile.
“Really gives a feel for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?” Ron said solemnly as he slipped out from under the cloak and held a door open for them to slip through.
“I’m sorry?” she asked and Harry gripped her elbow a bit tighter.
?" he asked, and Harry nodded, hugging the jumper close.
“Hermione stabbed it! Thought she should, she hasn’t had the pleasure yet,” he said, Draco taking the cup from his hand and turning it over in his own, running his thumb over the ruined object. A thousand years old and utterly destroyed.
The world exploded. They had all stood together for a moment of peace, Harry, Draco, Hermione, the Weasleys with the two Death Eaters at their feet and then the world fell away in a burst of noise and light. Draco felt like he was falling, or maybe he had been thrown, the sensation so reminiscent of those dreams from so long ago that he thought for a second he was in one. But it wasn’t, and he hit a stone wall so heavily that time stopped.
“I’m just telling you what Krum told me,” he said with a shrug.
After Potter woke up a few hours later and Hermione had her watch, they ate another dinner of stew and set up for the night. Potter sat himself down on the cushion, which had now been layered with three extra blankets, the bluebell jar resting in his lap as Draco handed over his wand. Their fingers brushed as Potter took it off him. “Thanks,” he said and then he turned to face the inky darkness outside and Draco went to bed, a small ache in his stomach.
The dungeons were just as he remembered them, cold and damp. He found the corridor and sidled up to the stretch of stone wall that was the hidden entrance. Distantly, he could hear water dripping from one of the walls. He pressed his fingers into the stone and tried to think.
"Like your Dad said, we'll see you soon, okay? Be good boys, listen to your teachers, and do your homework," he said and the boys nodded. He pulled them in, dropped kisses on both of their heads, and then let them go. "Go! Have fun!" he said and the boys nodded, and jumped on to the train, just as the whistle sounded again.
Draco thought he could hear screaming, but he wasn’t sure if it was just the sound of a thousand secrets being burned to soot in seconds. He turned where he sat, scanning the room below – there!
“Scared, Malfoy?” he asked in a slightly teasing tone and Draco could have nearly cried but he took a deep breath instead.
“Muggles who’ve just been leaving flowers on your parents’ grave! Harry, I’m sure there’s someone over there!” she snapped and Draco withdrew his wand as well inside the cloak, raising it a little as Potter hesitated next to him.
It was another night of lying wide awake on the sitting room floor Ron was snoring at his feet, Dean finally still and silent on the sofa and Potter, dead to the world, next to the sofa and at Draco’s head. One of the hallway clocks chimed for 3 in the morning when Draco decided to slip out of his sleeping bag and go to the kitchen. Fleur’s recipe books were on a shelf next to the small kitchen table and Draco picked one at random to flick through. Bill had gone on a reconnaissance mission to the tent site and had recovered a few books and some of their clothes, but had told them most of it had been destroyed.
“He was amazing!” Hermione said adoringly. “Amazing!”
It had taken Harry a few days to settle back into his routine in Melbourne. He spent his mornings in St Kilda’s, either at the Vineyard or at the Galleon Café, where he was regular enough that the woman behind the bar knew his usual coffee order. He read a bit, and wrote letters (to Luna, who was somewhere in the outback with her fiancé; to Neville, who had announced that he was going to take the position of Herbology Professor after Christmas; to Ron and Hermione, just letting them know he was home and settling back in). A few times, he had unfurled a blank sheet of parchment and written ‘
T for traitor.
“This evening should be… lively,” Mother murmured as she plucked at the table cloth. White now, but by the end of the evening it would be stained – with food, wine or blood, Draco couldn’t predict. He didn’t answer her and just stared at the floorboards. “His Lordship is expecting great things this evening,” she added, straightening and smoothing her skirt. The belt she used to cinch her waist, with a wand holster on the side, had been cinched further this evening. Her cheekbones were high and sharp and even by candlelight, Draco could see the smudges under her eyes. She was just as exhausted as he was, and unable to show it as well.
“Did you know what he did, Baron?” Draco asked, turning to follow the ghost as it swept past him. The Baron sighed.
Travers looked a bit insulted but recovered quickly. “And who accompanies you today, Bellatrix? I do not recognise them,” he said, eyeing Weasley and Draco. Draco straightened a little.
"Chaser. He's good - takes after both of us, I think. He was annoyed that he didn't beat me for “Youngest Seeker in a Century', though. He thought that if he was really good, the team would recruit him before he had even stepped on the train," he said with a laugh and Malfoy smiled. He tapped on the frame near Scorpius.
“Look – there!” he pointed as a pale rectangle of light appeared ahead of them, but Harry was diving suddenly and Draco screamed, tightening his hold around Harry’s middle.”What are you
“Oh, we volunteered. Well, Harry volunteered us. But we always like to see familiar faces onto the train,” Draco said, smiling down at Tatiana. Even her dark hair couldn’t free her from the tell-tale Weasley blush as it burned her ears. “How about I go fetch Harry if you’re meeting Ron and Hermione on the platform?” Draco suggested and Ginny gave him a small smile, which he took as agreement. He hopped back on the train and began the search for his husband.
“Stop looking! She doesn’t care!” he hissed at her and Hermione had to drag Bellatrix’s black eyes away from a woman crying in the padlocked doorway to Florean Fortescue’s. A bedraggled man lurched towards them from a shaded doorway, mumbling about his children, but they dodged past him continuing on their way.
Draco woke up late morning to the sounds of heated discussion coming from outside the tent. He had clambered into the upper bunk soon after Potter had left him to go on watch, and he lay there for a few minutes after waking, staring up at the canvas ceiling. He tilted his head back and could see that the flap that usually separated Hermione’s sleeping area had been rolled back – she was awake then.
Hermione relieved Draco’s watch soon after dawn and he gratefully slipped inside the warm tent, heading for the rudimentary kitchen and making two mugs of tea. Once done, he went back to her and handed her one of the mugs, sitting down next to her.
"You don't know Occlumancy." Blaise tried to think of another way but his mind was coming up short. "All right, I'll keep my walls up. I won't be able to shield every thought I have, but I can do most of them. And you can…" he trailed off. There really wasn't anything like Occlumancy, and he didn't know what else could help.
He thought. "Well, I was thinking," he said slowly, trying to figure out what the hell he
"Merlin," Blaise said, sucking in a lungful of air. "Not many safe subjects with you." Blaise knew that Potter had been through a lot, they all had. He didn't know it was this bad though.
"Ron," Hermione's voice came from behind him, "don't be rude." She squeezed past him and stepped into the room, looking between Harry and Draco. Clearing her throat, she said, "We are going to miss breakfast. Let's go."
Harry watched as Draco's eyes trailed down his body and back up to meet his own. "Come to get your picture taken, Potter?"
Hermione blushed. Pansy grinned. Harry nearly choked on his own tongue.
Is anyone else doing camp nanowrimo?
Astrid came back down without commenting on the wardrobe and asked Harry if they could go shopping.
During the silence that followed, Harry noticed that Lisa carefully kept her eyes on the intercom instead of looking at him. He briefly felt bad about doing this to her, knowing the lack of information would likely send her into a downward spiral. Curiosity killed the Ravenclaw and all that. He didn't feel bad for long though, it was this or go completely barmy.
"Hello?" he hears a woman's voice call out from the door.
Before Draco could manage a reply to that, a girl started shouting behind him.
Pansy walks into the kitchen, her presence noted by the click-clack of high heels on the tiled floor. Draco can see her over Potter’s shoulder, her head tilts as she looks them over. “You know, I had Astoria pressed up against the exact same spot last night.”
He leans forward, letting his blonde fringe brush against her forehead, to whisper, “I’m thinking about kissing you.”
When Harry came to Diagon Alley near the end of May, with Hermione and Ron, the three of them were bombarded by people the entire time. Even in the shops, they weren't able to get away or purchase their things without several people coming up to touch Harry, or talk over each other. They wanted to say thank you, ask him out, offer him gifts, or ask him to come for dinner. By the end of it, Harry was thrown into a panic attack and Ron had to side-along him back to Grimmauld place.
Hermione gave her a disapproving look. Harry was familiar with that look, he'd received it plenty of times. "Pansy," Hermione said, "is here to help Ron and me pick an outfit from her collection for the gala in July. You know the one? It's held every year on your birthday."
"So, are we good?" Potter asked.
. "Yeah," he said, and Potter crumpled to the mat, "you did eight minutes."
The girl blushed, "Oh of course I messed that up too. So sorry," she said and looked down at her phone, "I need flat 394.”
in Gryffindor then," he said, "I've never messed around with any men in Gryffindor."
Not that Harry sought out the rumors, of course. Just when people mentioned certain words like
"You will not be going anywhere," McGonagall said. "You still have several months of school to finish before I consider letting you leave this castle for good."
Anger rushed through Harry's body, the emotion crashing about, looking for a way out. He took a deep breath and didn't move or speak.
Draco hummed, tucking into his food. He looked completely at ease.
Harry waited, fear-numb, as the wolf approached, pressing its head against Harry’s hand. Teddy's disembodied voice floated from the mouth of the wolf. "Harry no one is hurt but we need your assistance. Please follow the Patronus and don't kill me when you get here."
He leaned in to speak against Draco's skin. "I don't want easy," Harry's voice was so low he hardly recognized it. "I don't just want a fuck. I don't care what anyone else says. I'm not doing this to avoid the nightmares."
"Or," Potter said, pulling the bag away, "you could go home and grab your research and then come back to mine."
:    Draco Malfoy
Harry grabbed at Draco’s shirt, hauling him forward and kissed Draco with a desperate need zipping through his body. He poured everything he could into the kiss, and when he heard a pleased moan from Draco, he knew the emotion was getting through. Draco took control of the kiss, sucking in Harry’s bottom lip to bite gently before he pulled back and trailed kisses along Harry’s jawline.
Potter hugs her back, strong arms circling her waist. "Hermione, it's good to see you." Potter's eyes flit to Draco before she pulls back.
She felt her cheeks heat up but lifted her chin in defiance. "I'm not admitting to anything," she said. "Besides, what I saw at Madam Malkin’s went a bit past my understanding of the term snogging."
Draco stepped closer, "All this change must be hard for you," he said. Harry reached out to pull his shirt and Draco let him, until their bodies were pressed together. Draco leaned down and bit Harry's neck, "About that fuck Potter?"
Harry looked up at the roof. It was made from some dark wood and didn't have any holes in it, "What?" he demanded.
They stood in the entryway not making eye contact. “What are you doing here Parkinson?” Harry asked warily.
Hermione blushed and said, “Blaise, it’s your turn.”
Malfoy had several bottles of cologne. Harry had seen them in his trunk while Malfoy was unpacking on their first day here. Only two bottles sat on the shelf in his closet though, he never used the others.
Zabini stepped up behind her, reaching past her waist to take hold of the bottle. "Nicely done Potter," he flashed a charming smile at Hermione. "I'll just get this behind the bar."

"No thank you, Lovegood. How are you?" Pansy asked.
“Did you forget to tell him you have a 'shagging only' policy?”
The boy hopped off the counter and turned down the hallway leading to the door. He could hear a man’s voice on the other side as he said, “Joanna we talked about this, I know what I’m doing. I should have tried talking to him years ago.”
Draco slipped his hands into his denims pockets, drawing Harry's eye to the way they were slung low on his hips, and looked at the display table of ties. "I take it you're looking to get dressed up?"
May drarry forever reign 🤴
Daphne stared at him, tilting her head. "Level with me Savior, how did you manage to take out Voldemort when you're this oblivious?"
"Then I would go with the basics if you think they will like the sound of it. J’ai envie de toi, I want you. Or Je veux te baiser, if you want to be more," Draco said, running a hand through his hair, "explicit."
Harry kicked the door open and looked at Draco expectantly.
"Which you know about," he said as she remembered how to breathe, "because Teddy told me that you two saw us."
“You smell like tequila and sexual repression Harry," Neville said, affectionately.
Draco laced his fingers through Harry's and gave his hand a squeeze.
“I mean,” Harry motioned to the folder, “having a labeled folder with incriminating information at the ready kind of makes it look like your just sitting around waiting for the right moment to strike. And sure, I get that, to a Slytherin-” he faltered briefly, remembering his current company. “I just don’t know that it makes the best impression.”
I'm really hoping this chapter isn't devisive. Please leave comments, they make me happy!

Harry gave a small bow and said, "I live to serve."
Draco didn't freeze up in fear, or shove him angrily, he didn't even flinch. His only response was a smirk as he breathlessly said, "Grip harder you fucking Hufflepuff." Then he captured Harry's lips in a passionate kiss, and came all over Harry's hand.
The two of them stood, dusted off and headed for the hall. Harry turned back before leaving, "Professor?"
"Merlin. Don’t fucking stop," Harry begged. As if that were even an option.

When they reached the kitchen Draco handed the invitation to Astrid and she stared at the front in confusion. She looked at Draco and asked, “Why does it say ‘Potter’?”
When he asked Hermione about it earlier in the week she'd said primly, "He offered to assist me with a project."
Harry scowled, "No, none of this is why you came," he said bitterly, and motioned to the glasses and the patio roof. "You just came to get your wand back."
After several steady beats of silence, Draco turns to Hermione. "I would love to join you. We can go together if you like. Pick you up at 6?" Draco asks, as though Hermione had had any part in inviting him.
Malfoy hummed in response, "So we're not going to fuck?"
Harry stared after him as Draco sat on the lounge, swung up his long legs and leaned against the back. Once comfortable, Draco turned back to look at Harry, lifted a questioning eyebrow, and motioned to the other lounge.
with his wand pointed at Ron.

Behind him, Draco chuckled. "You don't share me. And Weasel is right. I definitely don't share." He wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and set his chin on Harry's shoulder.
"So what are we doing in here?" Harry asked Draco once they were sitting.
Harry forced himself to look up at Malfoy’s eyes.
Potter has been coming by like this several times a week since Draco opened. He rarely has a good reason to interrupt Draco’s work, unless you count physical pleasure as a good reason, which Draco does. Most of their time has been spent in Potter’s flat but Draco likes it better when they are here because he has the upperhand of being in his own space. Though the lack of bed has its drawbacks. Luckily, Draco is fairly flexible and Potter is determined, so they usually make do.
“Merlin, Draco I-” Harry cut the words off, desperate not to have that between them until he knew Draco wanted it.
"Oh. Yeah, 'Mione said everyone got them, 7th year and up. Why? Are you going?"
"I'm sure you can figure that out," he replied casually. Draco looked down at the snitch fluttering about on Harry's t-shirt, "You're here for the same reason."
Harry got home at 6:30 that evening, wanting to have enough time to get Orion fed and settled before meeting with Draco. He had stopped off at The Magical Menagerie and purchased a magically created cat treehouse. The tree itself was over a meter tall and the house was built throughout the branches. Harry had chosen one that was spelled to sway slightly as though a breeze was blowing gently through the branches. He'd also paid extra for a charmed waterfall to be added, and picked up a new litter box that had a built in vanishing charm. He had left the Menagerie with excitement at the idea of Orion falling more in love with him because of the gift.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not a chance. Don’t change the subject. You like Longbottom. And don’t bother saying it’s just his fit as hell ass.”
Harry smiled, "I'm sure you'll be able to read all about it in the
"It's not like that. He said I should come by if I had time. Which I do not. I need to finish this assignment."
Ron huffed a laugh. "Yeah, fourth year. It wasn't subtle the way you two were with each other. And, Merlin fuck, I'm not even going to address sixth year."
As Draco was adding the last ingredient, 4 Fire seeds, the doorbell chimed. Their house had two entrances, one Muggle and one Wizarding. The Wizarding side on the North only had a door knocker, so they knew someone was awaiting response on the South side of the house that faced Muggle London. Scorpius glanced at his father who gave him a nod and said, “Go ahead, I need to take this off the heat and wash my hands.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco said cooly.
Harry is experiencing, addresses Draco with another question. "Do you think I could ask you a few questions afterward? I'd really like to go over a few details."
want to kiss Potter.
Harry rolled his eyes.
After one of the longest showers he'd ever taken, Harry dressed in a baggy pair of denims with a tight t-shirt that had a picture of a snitch fluttering about his chest. He pushed his hair around until some of it fell over the scar on his forehead. Then he ate the dinner Kreacher had made and headed to the wizarding club, Double Arrow.
"Don't be ridiculous, you had to go. That group would have stormed the castle if you'd tried to get out of it."
“Potter.” Even with Draco’s height, he didn’t have any advantage here. Potter’s hands braced against the wall, caging Draco in.
Harry backs up, reminding himself that he’s got nothing to worry about. He can take Malfoy if it comes to that. He just needs to remember how to breathe and everything will be fine.
“Of course I did. It’s amusing for me to watch you try and persuade Slytherins,” Draco replies, tilting his head to give Potter better access for kissing and biting his neck. “Come to the kitchen, I will make you some tea.”
Harry glanced back at Neville who immediately cast a patronus and sent it to McGonagall. Harry stepped forward trying to look Draco over for bruises, while ignoring the 4 students who were attempting to call out to him through the gags. Harry couldn't even look at them, he knew he wouldn't be able to hold back with the fresh memory of Pansy in his mind.
Scorpius smiled at the familiar scene, it happened twice a year, once in July when they received invitations for his Grandmother’s birthday gala, and again in December when she threw an extravagant Christmas celebration. Draco insisted they show up in new robes for both events -or in this case clothes as Narcissa was requesting muggle attire- Scorpius knew that Harry thought it was ridiculous but he also knew that Harry would get everyone a new set of robes every week if it made Draco happy. They were ridiculous, honestly, ridiculous and happy.
-about the gala
"It's barely half 5 Draco."
She cast a
“I have to say, I’m a bit surprised you didn’t use
"Ooh, I think you're a bit pissed." Pansy said with glee. "Let's hear some secrets Potter. I know you have a bunch of them."
“You're doing so good. Fucking made for me." Draco's cock pushes into Harry’s body, stretching him open. His body firm and solid against the backs of Harry’s thighs, his shoulders steady behind Harry's knees.
Seamus sat up to open a drawer in his bedside table and pull out a book. "Here, you should read that before you do anything," he said, handing it over as Harry sat up.
At those words, Harry's stomach took on a nauseated quality. He still wasn't sure what was going on, but he didn't like the idea of Draco being compromised.
He cast a
"You made that clear" another man's voice responded, and Harry pressed his ear harder against the door, "when you were on your knees in the shower this morning." The voice sounded sexy, even though it was muffled through the door.
He can feel Draco smile against his skin. “Listen to you beg, it’s music to my ears.” The sound of Draco’s posh voice, low and eager, sounds like pure sex.
Malfoy's eyes drifted over Harry's outfit slowly. He glanced over at the brass numbers, 394, that were drilled into his door frame, then looked down at his own hand, fingers splayed.
Malfoy's eyes flicked to Harry in the mirror's reflection. "It's cologne. Not that I would expect you to know anything about personal grooming."
Ron turned an incredulous look on her, "And what would you do if I said those words to you?" he asked.
Pulling out the file from his pocket, Draco grabbed the list of items he'd written down. He looked over it and asked, "Do you have muggle products here?"
Pansy nudged his arm, "Let's go in Potter."
"You hate to follow rules," Draco leaned in and bit Harry's earlobe, whispering, as he said, "What's the harm in breaking this one?"
"Forced proximity?"
Harry sat between Neville and Hermione. Hermione spent most of dinner discussing their plans for a Hogsmeade trip the following weekend, and Harry promised to join her at the bookstore if she came with him to check out the new Nimbus.
Harry stared at the wall, his breathing coming hard and fast. He barely heard the next words.
"You're right," Pansy said, "you shouldn't be alone. You should go catch a pretty boy toy for the night." She started to push him out of the way. "Go on Potter, this is the last step and then we are free of each other till school."
"With Draco."
Harry gave her a dirty look, "That's so far from the truth-"
Blaise looked between them, his brows furrowing, “Ok, now I feel like I’ve missed something.”
Harry's shoulders slumped and he leaned against the doorway. "I think I just need someone to talk to," he said.
Hermione came around the desk to give Harry a welcoming hug, and he noted that, even in her
Scorpius wasn’t an obsession. He was Harry’s kid, they had established that when Harry bought the house. Being his kid, Scorpius knew that he was in a different category for Harry. The category was probably labled ‘children I will murder for, but also need to keep a disturbingly close watch on because they might be prone to trouble’ in Harry’s mind. Yeah, Scorpius was definitely in that category, along with Teddy Lupin. Because of this, he was not surprised that Harry was suspicious of him.
Ron cocked an eyebrow at him "I'm one of seven Malfoy. I know how to share." He glanced at Harry, and added, "Not that either of you would know anything about that."
"Relax," the unmistakable Malfoy drawl filtered in through the bedroom wall.
“Pansy."
He thought.
Blaise followed him through the common room. Draco stopped before the knights and turned back to Blaise.
"Hi Ginny," she said with a flirty smile.
"I'll think about it," he said, then motioned to the bookcase, "Go on then."
Astrid had gotten up early and gone into the cellar to look over the potions ingredients kept at the house. She thought it would help to be able to recognize the more common items quickly when she was watching me work, not to mention for class. When Scorpius came in to collect her she was standing before a shelf that held mostly jars of leeches, and Murtlap tentacles, and looking between her book and the bottles.
Hermione looks between them, as they stare at each other without speaking. she can tell Pansy is stirring up trouble, only she's not sure what kind. Both of them are so careful to only express the emotion they intend to have shown. Surely this isn't about an old school rivalry, Draco hasn't said a bad thing about Harry to Hermione since this whole thing started. Come to think of it, he hasn't mentioned Harry at all.
"I heard Neville's expecting you," Daphne said, scribbling away on her parchment.
Astrid rewarded him with a brilliant and fast spreading blush, he bit his cheek to prevent a triumphant smile. “You could also offer a reason for me giving in to what you want. I find that logic, or something that appears to be logic, works more effectively on those who are practiced in the art of reading people.”
He leaned in, "I didn't quite catch that."
"Funny about me?" Draco asked, seeming delighted with conversation he'd heard.
Blaise nodded, knowing they were
I really like this chapter! I hope you do too, please leave me some feedback in the comments! It makes a big difference.
"Sorry to hear you'll be busy tonight, Draco," Macmillan said, finally removing his hand. Then he gave Draco a wink. "I'm free Saturday if you want to talk."
The man at the door frowned, then cocked his head, trying to see into the house. “Are you sure? It’s really important that I speak with him,” he said, fishing for something in his pocket. He pulled out a piece of paper and attempted to hand it over to Scorpius, who made no moves to take it. The man’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, “He sent this to me,” he said, his tone becoming less friendly.
Draco’s brows drew down and he blinked twice before saying, “Budget?”
"You sure?" Blaise asked. "Someone might see us in there."
Harry cleared his throat and said, "I want to take you out on dates before that, real dates."
"Ok," Harry said with a sigh, "It's treacle and tart. Sweet?"
Hermione jumps at the sound of Draco's voice. She might have even
“Oh Merlin, your brooding is as bad as his,” Pansy said, motioning to Draco.
"Ron is here and he's pissed off Ginny." Harry grabbed Draco's wand, handing it to him, and pocketed his own.
“Why do you think I would even consider this. I have no desire to get caught up in your drama.”
“Er,” Harry said.
Harry rubbed his left bicep and scowled at her, "What?!"
"More than?"
"I tried to stop them," he offered, keeping his tone level. He knew the girl could lose her temper as easily as he could.
Harry peeked over at Neville, who was wearing baggy denims and a tight-fitting charcoal Henley with long sleeves. Zabini was in tailored trousers and a blue button-down. Harry decided on denims. He tore off his robes and started to pull clothes out of the closet.
"So good. So good."
Draco held his right hand out to Pansy who placed her wand in his. "Sorry Potter," Draco said, "no games this time." With that, he shot out an expelliarmus and caught the wand in his left hand before it could soar past him. Draco dropped Pansy's wand into her waiting hand and stared down at his own. He took a shaky breath before sliding it into his robe. When Draco looked back to Harry he said, "Thank you, again."
“Care to tell me exactly what you were doing with my son in a locked classroom?” Lucius asked.
"What does that one mean, exactly?"
“Help,” Malfoy repeated, pulling Harry from his thoughts. “The same type of help that Blaise needed when he asked me about french?” Malfoy’s eyes flicked down to Harry’s lips, “About how to seduce someone?”
"I guess you hadn't considered that," Draco says, letting a smug smirk pull from his lips.
Harry felt his shoulders tense and the room grew suddenly hot. There were always articles about him, something atrocious must have come out for Pansy to be this excited to throw it in his face. True, they had built something of a truce over the last month, bordering on a friendship, but even as a true friend of a Slytherin you were always in danger of blackmail or good old-fashioned humiliation.
"Is there anything we can talk about regarding the project?" Potter asked.
Grimmauld place.”
"Oh my God," she squealed, "it's Harry Potter!"
"I'm great! It’s easy to be happy when you have plans, and I have several," she said and turned to Draco. “Draco, Neville and I are going to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes to say hi to Ginny. We will be there in an hour. You should stop by, can you?”
I hope you like this chapter!
He got to the landing and stepped into Neville's room. "Hey," Harry said, pulling a flask from the pocket of his blazer, "I brought you some firewhiskey."
Harry watched as she walked past them, shocked by her friendliness. He looked back to Draco, "How!?" he demanded, the memories of her tortured cries were flooding his mind.
Anna's smile grew into something uncomfortably
“An effective way to piss off my father.”
so fucking casually. "No, I need sleep," he said.
“I think Grimmauld Place likes you, Potter.” Draco’s face was just over Harry’s shoulder, his words coming out in hot puffs against the back of Harry’s neck.
“Narcissa Malfoy is still on house arrest, isn’t she?” Loire asked.
Harry's head snapped up so fast his neck twinged in protest. His heart started to pound in his chest.
"It's nothing to worry about. We have them all the time. Part of loving a Malfoy, I think."
"Maybe you should take the morning off," Seamus replied, "You've been doing those extra training sessions every day since we got here."
Loire looked at him for a moment and then softly smiled, "I hope not. Either way, your help is needed. The Headmistress put Miss Lovegood in charge of assigning so please follow her."
"So," Anna said, "is Teddy involved?"
Draco was not feeling alright. Draco was having a
Mr. Malfoy cocked an unimpressed eyebrow at him, "What happened?"
On Monday morning, Ron sent an owl letting Harry know that he and Hermione were coming back Thursday, one day early. They hadn't told Mrs Weasley, and asked if they could stay at his place for the night, before going back to the Burrow.
Blaise didn't know what that meant. He didn't even know a Charlie. He did know Draco, and he knew that he couldn't have Draco mad at him. "Look I didn't-"
- and a slate-grey jumper. Hoi Polloi was less than a kilometer from the apparition point. During the walk they passed Soft Serve Society, a quaint ice cream shop just off the main road.
Scorpius felt his neck crack with the speed he jerked it to look up at his father, "Can we do that?"
Kreacher appeared with croissants and pumpkin juice, setting them on the desk and leaving after they both said thank you.
"Merlin! I was kidding!" he pulled back from Hermione, "You know Ron is an auror right? He knows where to hide bodies."
Fanfiction is highly influential, bordering on cult like qualities. The effects on the psyche appear to be similar to imperious. I recommend we keep a close eye on the muggles who write them. Most of the authors are likely harmless, self-indulgent, fanboys (or fangirls). However, I fear that, given time, the stories could infiltrate the muggle population, having even more influence than the original Harry Potter series.
“All right, glad that’s settled,” Seamus said, backing out of the room. “I will tell the guys and they can move their stuff tonight. You’ll talk to Neville about it, Harry?”
Draco leaned back against the building, letting his head fall back to expose a long pale neck. Harry stepped closer, trying to ignore the way his magic was whipping around in his body.
Harry, shivering, mindless with it, said, “You. I need you.” He reaches down, a restless touch, gripping Draco’s ass, pulling him deeper.
She then looked from Draco to Harry and back again before saying, "I presume the two of you can be trusted not to antagonize each other? I need to go back to my office and write owls to several parents."
"I'll tell you when I'm done investigating. Until then, you'll just have to be curious." Draco hoped he could come up with something convincing by the time they were done tonight.
“Have you seen this guy yet?” Neville asked, once he'd recovered.
Harry chewed at his bottom lip and wondered what it would be like to think things through before speaking. "It's your. I mean, you live next door to me," he said, forcing himself to stop fidgeting "So, you know there's thin walls and my bedroom is," Harry continued l, watching Malfoy's face go a bit more pale, "we share a wall, and sometimes," he cleared his throat, "I mean your clients aren't exactly quiet."
"Safer I guess. It was the wand that took out Voldemort, after all."
Harry lunged across the hot tub, bracketing Draco’s legs with his own.
Harry swallowed and said, "Er… Ok?"
she wrote. She looked up to see it flash along his bracelet but nothing was there. Her eyebrows drew together, "Why didn't it work?"
Narcissa's eyes narrowed, "You said-"
Ron had said something like that to him once, accused him of being obsessed. Accused him of stalking.
he thought to himself.
"Why don't we just play cards?" Hermione asked.
Harry was so thankful for her voice of reason, but apparently his boyfriend was still a Slytherin.
Malfoy sits upright again and casually undoes the top button of his shirt. Hermione makes a show of slowly looking him over as if he would taste far better than anything on the menu. It's not that difficult if she's honest. The way his hair falls to gently kiss the long white-blond lashes of his left eye, the barely exposed clavicle, the muscles shifting under that shirt he wears like a second skin. When she meets his eye again her lips curve into a wry smile.
“Handle what better?”
A full smile bloomed on Scorpius’ face as he cut him off, saying, “Oh, you definitely shouldn’t talk to me like that.” He stepped back feeling his father come up beside him, and watched as Draco put his wand to the man’s throat.
“Do not ‘yes love’ me. Get out of the shower and put your clothes on! We need to leave or I’m going to be late.”
“Mr. Potter,” she said, her eyes quickly flitting around the room and then back to him, as though looking for clues as to what he was doing there.
"What!?!" Ron shouted, making both Hermione and Harry flinch. "Bloody hell, have you lost your
In order for this to make sense, Harry's thoughts sent through the bond will always be in bold letters.
Before Lucius could respond, green flames, just behind Lucius, jumped to life again, and Narcissa Malfoy stepped out of the floo, around her husband. Keen blue eyes landed on Harry and he fell silent at the sight of her, his memory of their last encounter flooding his mind.
Harry had pulled him back into the bed then, saying, “You and me, together.”
"What are you doing here?" Pansy asked.
Pansy runs a hand over her over the curve of her ass and smiles, "They are."
"So," he ran a hand across the back of his neck, "I get the feeling there was more to this than a break from the normal class activity."
," she said, pulling off her coat, "my last name is going to be Weasley soon. What are you going to do when that happens?"
"You have thirty seconds left," Weasley said.
Incoming smut in the next chapter
"No, it's not that," Neville said. Harry could hear the amusement in his words. "You should never eat anything sent to this room for Harry. It's probably dosed with a love potion. If it doesn't come from Kreacher, don't touch it."
Harry’s eyes snapped open at the words, glaring at the wall in front of him, which, promptly, vanished.
"Don't you dare be so crass," Draco said the words between kisses, rolling his hips against Harry, "as to propose to me at a wedding."
"Good. Yes, please let's not go to the great hall."
“Salazar’s snake, Harry!
She gave him a kiss on the cheek, “I will Dad, don’t worry.” She opened the door and stepped out onto the street, pulling her backpack over her right shoulder. She walked around the car to the sidewalk, slowing to a stop when she heard the car window open behind her. She turned back around to see her Dad looking anxiously at her from the driver’s side. She prayed he wasn't upset by the length of her skirt, it wasn't short, but it wasn't necessarily modest either.
"-not to mention," Hermione was saying, "the
What was wrong with him? He never stumbled over his words. Weasley's brows furrowed. "You want to try that again?"
“Yeah, well it’s been a while since I've liked you.”
Hermione glanced back at the woman sitting atop her desk and smiled, "I'm sure Pansy is delighted at your timing. Especially considering the topic."
"Stunt?" Blaise asked, feigning ignorance. He glanced up at the girls who were both watching them with rapt attention.
Draco shook it, trying to remember the name he’d given to Emily. When he couldn’t think of it he said, “You can just call me Draco. I wouldn’t want to ruin the illusion.”
“Is there something you needed?” Harry asked. Why had he thought flying would help?
Why must Potter crowd him so? Green eyes, pinning Draco to the wall, flashing with challenge. The heat pouring from his body-
The three of them watched her skip away until she was lost in the crowd. Harry broke the silence.
“All right Jellybean,” Dudley said as he adjusted to car closer to the curb in front of Harry's house, “mind your manners while you’re here and have fun. Remember to text me if you need anything.”
“Granger,” he said with a stiff nod. Then, looking at her sleeve covered left arm, “I’m sorry for what you went through at the Manor.” Then he met her eye, “I also apologize for the many horrible things that I’ve said to you over the years. ”
Potter rolled his eyes. "Listen, I'll admit the git crosses my mind a lot, but none of my thoughts are," Potter lowered his voice to a whisper, "explicit in nature."
Draco looked down at his arm feeling faint. It must have shown on his face because Emily squeezed his bicep and said, "You look a bit ill, Jason. Why don't you head out. Your two hours is up anyway."
Draco jerked back, cutting the thought off, his shoulders hitting the door behind him, and closed his eyes. This assignment was driving him crazy!
She fought a blush, “Hello, Mr. Malfoy,” she said, returning the smile.
Helpless to do anything else, Blaise closed his eyes. His cock was
Blaise let the smile grow. "I just enjoy seeing the three of you happy, darling."
"Harry," Hermione said his name cautiously.
I had to adjust the timeline for movie/book releases to make this story work. Hope you don’t mind!
She’d peeked up at Draco, teeth dragging over her bottom lip, and nodded. “Yeah, thanks mate.”
"Can I get you to write down that glowing review and autograph it for me?"
They left the courtroom and went straight to Robert’s office to floo to the Leaky Cauldron. They ate quietly, with the only conversation happening towards the end of the meal. Even then they didn’t talk about the day but took refuge in the safe topic of Quidditch.
Blaise kept his eyes on the book in front of him.
Draco chuckled against Harry, the sound rumbling through his chest, wrapping around Harry's heart. "I love you, Harry," he whispered.
Ron threatened to force a calming draught potion down Harry’s throat if he didn’t stop fidgeting until Hermione reminded him that any potion could be considered tampering with a witness.
Kingsley sifted through the papers, setting several pieces of parchment and photographs aside and tapping them with his wand to create copies. When he was finished he looked back to Lucius, "I appreciate you bringing this to me, it will undoubtedly be enough to convict her. I must say something though, for my own integrity, if nothing else. I know you wouldn't be here if she wasn't after your son. You would have done the same Lucius, if not worse, to those Muggle-borns."
They both kept their word.
He flashed her a smile, "He has that effect."
Draco huffed a laugh, "You did that already, Potter, when we were eleven." Then he leaned down and kissed him.
“Actually I did have a purpose for coming to see you this evening,” Draco said. Then added, in false sweetness, “I assume you have friends to share confessions with, but if you would rather discuss your homoerotic awakening with me, I can make some time.”
“No, not like that” Harry said quickly. Then, when she seemed to relax a touch, he said, “Pansy just wanted to give me a hard time. She wasn’t cruel or anything. I’m not worried about her. It’s the rest of them, I’ve been getting owls non-stop from people giving their opinions about the whole thing.”
Harry shrugged, knowing it was likely. "Do you have the password then?"
"About
Harry thought that her voice sounded sexy, a thought he promptly felt guilty for having while getting off with her
Harry leaned down and scooped him up with his left hand and motioned him a bit towards Malfoy, “Found him,” he said, offering what he hoped was an awkward smile but felt more like a grimace. Another uncomfortable silence followed so Harry tried to fill it, “What are you doing out here?”
"Yes."
He hadn't brought that idea up to anyone though. Best to keep
After Pansy handled the waitress at the Leaky Cauldron, motioning to Harry and saying the word
Harry looked him over and thought,
When Harry opened the door Pansy Parkinson was standing on the other side of it with her arms folded and an angry pout on her face. Standing next to her was a putout Draco Malfoy. Harry looked them both over carefully and said, "No," and shut the door.
Draco's eyes widened, "You do?"
"Draco come on, you have to have some kind of idea about what you want to do after school," Blaise said, passing the last of the second bottle to Ernie.
He shrugged, thinking back, and said, "Well, based on my experience she likes awkward fumbling hands, confusion, and good kissing," he looked up, "kissing is the only thing I'm good at with females. I mean I'm good at kissing guys too. Just, I'm also good-"
Granger's entire face went red as a Weasley.
Hermione lifted an eyebrow, “How do you know that?”
This time, Draco dropped his eyes to look Harry over, pointedly checking him out, taking in Harry's jeans and t-shirt, unruly dark hair, and broad shoulders. Harry tried not to shift or fidget under the gaze, feeling too exposed.
isn’t interested in the kind of kinky shit I am.”
"Potter asked Neville to show him the proper form for
Naricassa glanced back at Harry and he had the distinct feeling that he was being weighed and measured. She looked back to Draco and said, "I see. We shall need to revisit this at the appropriate time."
The wards shimmered as Draco reached out to breach the magic. He waited, a bar of tension straining across his shoulders, but nothing happened. Looking at his hand he could see that the magic around it was all white. Acceptance. Gaining confidence, Draco stepped onto the porch and placed a flat hand against the door.
George hummed in response, running his fingers through the strands of a leather flogger hooked to the wall. "So what then?" He asked. "You want to know what Harry has bought in the past?"
Draco started to laugh and even Harry had to choke down a chuckle. “Fine,” Harry said. “Just don’t ever do that again.”
Again, Pansy answers first, "I'm sure she doesn't
She seemed to make up her mind and gave a quick nod. "Very well," she replied cautiously, "Harry."
That let loose another round of bitter, painful, thoughts from Potter. Things that didn't seem to connect involving Snape, Mom, Sirius falling through the veil, and, again Voldemort. Blaise tried to think of something innocent to say, something that would distract Potter. "Unicorn," he said.
"What about you, Savior?" Blaise asked, and Harry lifted his head off of Draco's neck to look up at him bleary eyed.
"From who?" Draco asked. "Lovegood?"
"How did you reconnect?" she asked.
“Right,” Potter said, rubbing a hand across the back of his flushed neck. “Yeah, that’s what I meant when I said come back to mine. Come back and investigate.”
"Blaise," Pansy said, grabbing his hand, "Neville isn't going to marry a pureblood girl. He likes you. Stop sabotaging your own happiness."
“Potter!” Pansy barked, startling Harry.
Harry let his eyes drop slowly over the man. To cover up the blatant act of checking Draco out, Harry tilted his head, asking, "How do you keep your robes so clean in the floo?"
Let me know what you think in the comments💖
Apparently that was enough to break Lucius of his silence. He sneered at the site of their contact. “Don’t lie Draco, Potter already told me that you’re he's not a client of yours,” Lucius said.
Location: Waterstones Book Store, London.
was a good look on Potter, with his flinty green eyes and clenched fists. Draco shook his head trying to focus. Macmillan was still touching him, doing his best to look as though he wanted Draco's attention.
He watched as a man stepped out and looked at him with surprised storm-grey eyes that he hadn’t seen since the last time he stepped foot in front of the Wizengamot.
Draco scoffed, “That’s ridiculous. You know that every time I talk to him we end up fighting.”
Hermione had laid a comforting hand over his, "I think you're right Harry. If you want to speak for him I'll speak with you."
Seamus laughed, "That's nothing new."
“Fine,” Potter said, standing from the bed to cross his arms and lean against the bedpost. His eyes moved purposefully to Draco who was still shirtless, having only managed to pull on a pair of trousers.
"I'm not supposed to-"
"Harry, I'm fine. I promise. Besides, I'm going on a date tonight."
Harry stared at the plaque for a moment, then said, "Happy for both of us?"
"this door does take you into the house."
Blaise spotted Draco in the common room with Hermione and Astoria. They were reviewing each other's potion's essays that were due in the morning. Blaise wasn't sure what the motive was for Draco to attend these study groups but he knew they were helping.
, then whined into his pillow at the sound coming through the wall.
Astrid paused, thinking about the three of them, she could feel her cheeks heat up. Obviously, Scorpius had caught her eye, he was practically a Justin Bieber clone. His Father was just as good looking, and Astrid wasn’t immune to the appeal of him sitting next to Harry when they had talked, even with the two of them being 20 years her senior. Their contrast had made for a complimentary aesthetic, the kind you see in GQ ads where they pair a dark skinned rugged mess with some buttoned-up clean and pretty blonde.
*En Temerant Voistra is a reference to a book list in one of my favorite stories. Please read Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss! It's amazing!
"Merlin," Harry said, running a hand through his hair to hide the blush. "I don't think that would help, lots of people try to seduce me."
Draco shrugged one shoulder, looking at the table. "It's warmer in there. How do you like our dorm?" he asked. It wasn't the smoothest change of subject but Blaise let it pass.
"That'll be all Kreacher," Potter said, standing to grab his own plate. "Thank you," he added, though it sounded as if it pained him.
"Draco?"
Harry cringed at the word mobile and hoped it wasn't his magic causing issues with the reception. Hermione had warned him about his casual use of wandless. She said wands give more direction but Harry's magic came so easily since the war that most of the time he didn't really think about it. Magic was just something he did, like walking, or breathing.
Hermione looked smug, the same way she did when a theory she had was proven right, "For that, you will have to get him at least three outfits."
"Yes."
"No." Harry said the word firmly. He wasn't going to be a jerk to her, but that idea was not on. "I'm not getting locked out there with all those fangirls, and I won't be sanctioned to the common room either," he said, and then waited for her to meet his eyes. "This is the first time I've been in school without being hunted. I just want to enjoy it."
"Wait. What?"
Seamus beamed. “Great! And Malfoy? You’re all right with it?”
I told you.
Draco let the tips of his fingers slip into the custom trousers he wore and started to take casual steps towards Harry. "I've already received several lectures from Pansy about why you're a bad idea," he said. He was close now, close enough to touch easily.
on that coin and your boy will show up within the hour.”
"No," he replied with a wry smile, slipping the phone back into the pocket of his jeans. He had no intention of sharing Draco Malfoy with anyone.
Scorpius sifted through the invitations on the table to pull his from the pile. His hand paused in midair when he spotted a name that he hadn’t expected.
Harry gave her a cheeky grin, "Only when Pansy here asks me to." He could feel Pansy turn a glare on him.
“More what you were looking for?” Potter asked.
Harry looked at Ron in surprise, "You're not going to the aurors?"
Harry turned a shocked expression on the other boy, who smiled with false innocence. "Can I help you with something?" Harry asked.
Harry had spent a lot of time thinking over the moment that wand became his. Harry knew he hadn't given it willingly but part of him suspected that Draco didn't regret it after everything. So, he took a chance and said, "Thanks for letting me borrow it."
Blaise glanced up before returning to his task. "Hello to you as well, lifelong friend," he replied, pulling out a quill from the side pocket.
"Sorry Harry, I didn't," he chanced a glance at Scorpius, "I wasn't trying to make trouble." He moved to the side, "Harry, this is my daughter, Astrid. She recently received a very important letter."
The pictures had been the worst, in the last two hours he’d probably taken more pictures with muggles than the
“I was informed there was an incident at Hogwarts today with Delores Umbridge, shortly after you set up this meeting."
Draco's client gasped and backed up against the wall. Harry reached up to touch the antlers, just to solidify their existence, and feigned shock. "Oh I'm so sorry. Are you Muggle? This is just a bit of magic, nothing to be afraid of."
he thought, remembering the detailed description from the stories. How the material felt on his fingertips as he slid his hand past them to wrap his-
Potter stumbled but caught back his grace easily. Damn Auror training. He moved forward until Draco’s back was pressed against the wall.
Comment if you want to make my day!!
Draco lifted his eyes to meet Harry's, and said, "Then at the station, Granger had a chat with me about you as well. She said you're not ready for someone like me." Draco raised his left hand and placed it on the door above Harry's shoulder.
“I’m sure it’s nothing compared to whoever plays your role.”
Draco nods, “She’s my best friend, I had to tell her.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, though he sounded anything but sorry. He was the picture of incredulous when he asked, “You work to help kids who have been bullied?”
“Of course,” Potter said readily. Blaise nodded in agreement.
Draco returned with a smile before they were even directed to a table for dinner on the West side of the ballroom. Their table was set close to one of the winding staircases. Each of them looked for their name on the place cards and set their stuff down. The seating was well handled, going in a circle starting with Joana, then Dudley, Vernon, Petunia, Astrid, Scorpius, Draco, Harry, Teddy, and Andromeda.
Neville, ever the perfect assistant, reminded Harry of his meeting with the interior designer tomorrow, and text him the address so it was a fresh notification on his cell.
“You can’t stay locked up in this house Harry,” she said.
"Treacle Tart. Hermione, you know the answers to all of these questions," Harry said.
Judging by the blush on Hermione's cheeks, Pansy had just won this argument by default.
“I’d be happy to give you a blow by blow account Lucius,” Harry replied easily, watching the other man’s eyes narrow, “but I have a prior engagement.” He moved to step towards the floo.
Harry shrugged.
He laughed, bemused, and strode to his door. Astrid noticed that he walked with the same elegance as Draco and wondered if it was natural or if he'd been trained to move that way. "All right," he said, opening the door, "have at it."
Harry was gobsmacked.
A stony silence followed his words in which the lawyer cast hard eyes on Doge but remained silent for several minutes. He smoothed out the nonexistent wrinkles of his robe and turned back to Harry and said, “My apologies, Mr. Potter, allow me to rephrase. Do you believe it was Lucius Malfoy’s intent to deceive the people in the room with you during your time at Malfoy Manor?”
Harry walked into the room, tugged off his robes and tossed them on the bed. He pulled out a pair of flannel pants from his trunk and stared down at them. He didn't want Pansy to walk in on him changing clothes, not that he much cared, but he wasn't sure if she cared. He certainly didn't think it was wise to assume anything about what would or would not upset Pansy. Not when she was so willing to point it out.
Draco leaned over the desk and slid his report to the side, revealing the artwork he’d been given the night before. Her eyes flicked up to him, then back down to the picture. To her credit, Hermione didn’t flinch the way Draco had. Which meant that she wasn’t surprised.
I don't want anyone to be surprised so I want to say two things.
He opened his eyes to find Ernie Macmillan standing in front of him. "Don't call me that Macmillan."
she asked, "was it about the war?"
For a moment they sat in the water quietly, only looking at each other. Until Draco said, “Come on Gryffindor, make a move.”
“Did I know about what, exactly?” she responded carefully, still looking at the parchment.
Harry took the list and read it over, then looked back to her, "Yes," he answered, cautiously. The list wasn't a friendly one and he had no idea what she was planning.
She touched with her thumb thinking of the boy in front of her and saw his name, then with her finger, -
“She just likes to threaten you Potter,” Draco says. “I know the feeling.”
He jumped when Draco soundlessly grabbed his wrist and guided Harry, to walk behind him. Pansy took up the spot behind Harry and they walked in a line instead of side by side. It's weird to walk single file, but the people in front part quickly when they are faced with Draco Malfoy. Harry's not sure if that's from fear or genuine dislike, but right now he doesn't care, he's happy to have the crowd held off. Behind him Pansy threw a casual jinx at anyone who got too close to her, and eventually, the crowd grants them a wide berth.
"Hermione," Hannah said seriously, "hufflepuffs would never do something without consent."
Say hi on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit
"It's Draco. I'm here to speak with you," the voice says.
Harry had the sinking feeling this wouldn't be the last time he saw one of the postcards.
“Is that what you do with Draco?”
Hermione smiled. "Thank you, Harry," she said sweetly. "I'm going to take him away now. Have fun tonight, but not too much. Make sure you talk first."
“Don’t be ridiculous," Draco replied, "I owe you no such thing.”
“What do you mean why?”
The group relocated to sit on the cushions set up in the corner. Once Draco and Granger joined, charmed bottle in hand, Hannah went first. She gave Ernie a light peck on the lips, which he returned as though they had done this all through school.
Potter gave a lazy smile, "Lucky guess. I haven't heard any of your thoughts since we left the infirmary."
James thought.
"We got you a plate," Astoria added, handing him an essay to review. Sighing, Blaise took the essay and skimmed over it, looking for any obvious mistakes. He liked eating in the Great Hall.
At the beginning of 8th year, Professor Flitwick had paired off each student to comply with the new rules set by the Headmistress. The rule stated that all students would be paired outside of their own houses to further the goals of inter-house unity. Hermione and Pansy had started off the year in a stony silence, only speaking when they had to for an assignment. After three weeks, Pansy had broken the silence with a bit of gossip about Lavender Brown. Hermione tried not to let this interest her but Pansy was undeterred by her silence, and Hermione found herself shaking in laughter by the end of it when the girl revealed that Lavender had accidentally dyed her hair three different shades of orange. Once they started talking the pair of them didn't stop, and by November, they were often seen sharing tea together in the common room.
Luna linked hands with Harry and started to pull him out of the hall, describing different renovation projects along the way. When Harry started to hear the voices of other students he dropped her hand and pulled back. Luna stopped and looked at him.
Ginny looked at him with round, shocked eyes.
"Sorry," Potter said, giving her his 'I saved the world smile' that Draco recognized from his interviews in
“It’s good. I think you are going to like the rooms, and we are nearly done with that area,” Harry said. He stood up to start the kettle, “Do you want a cuppa?”
OK. Fine. It's not like he'd never thought about it. But it was always, what was that word Hermione loved? Dysfunctional. It was always a dysfunctional fantasy where he would shut Draco up with his cock, or shove him against the wall after a duel and leave bruises on his neck with his teeth, or cum on his face, or his chest, or his ass, or anywhere really. But especially inside him.
“I think it’s your turn for questions. Are you still doing the remodel business?”
Harry thought.
article or you don’t know why you showed up at my house?” Harry asked, fighting to keep exasperation from his voice.
Harry nodded to the window ledge, "Feel free to use the wireless," he said.
The next day, Harry arrived at the Three Broomstick via floo at 9am. He wanted to be late for this initial meeting to avoid the other students. Upon arrival at Hogwarts, he went to the great hall and found Luna Lovegood sitting with someone Harry had never seen before.
At the same time, Draco yelled,
“Shut up Zabini,” Harry replied with an embarrassed laugh. He only called Blaise by his surname when he was being a total prat.
All that mattered was the result.
The rooms were spacious with a mirror inside, on the outside was another dispenser for hand sanitizer and lotion, plus a hook to place a tag numbering your clothing items.
"Harry needs to work with you so no one worships him."
he thought as he hopped off his bed.
Still, it was a nice view, and one he hadn't gotten in his old room.
"Um it's, I don't know," he shrugged and looked at the floor, "short on the sides but longer on top. Has that fringe stuff that hangs over his left eye. It's blonde. White blonde I guess? Or platinum. It's slightly darker at the roots than at the tips. I assume that's from sun exposure. And it looks soft now that he doesn't gel it back," he looked back at Hermione.
Harry thought about Ginny as well. He was going to have to talk to her before Sunday dinner at the Burrow. The last thing he needed was a pack of Weasleys bombarding him with questions about Draco.
Harry shifted against the wall, using his hands to brace himself as he arched his back and pushed against Draco cock, taking Draco deep inside him. They both groaned Draco kept a hand on Harry’s cock, the other hand gripped his hip hard enough to leave the mark of fingerprint bruises. Draco watched the slick slide of his cock thrusting in and out of Harry.
Dudley cleared his throat, shifting on the leather chair where he was seated. “It’s called Speak and Seek. We-” he broke eye contact and looked at the table which was now holding several cups of tea. “We, counsel kids who are caught bullying in school.”
Out of the corner of her eye, Hermione sees a flash of red hair and that’s enough to push her over the edge. If these two are going to play games than Hermione is going to capitalize it.
Harry scowled at her, wondering how it was that she could always tell what he was thinking. Maybe she was smarter than him.
Draco gives him an easy smile. "Then I reckon you're buying because I don't have any Euro on me." It seems like the right thing to say because Potter relaxes and asks Draco about France.
Next to him, Macmillan choked, probably from the effort of not speaking. Whatever, Draco didn’t care when Potter was observant. This conversation was completely off track.
"How long have you wanted me?" Draco counters.
Potter was a major benefit. Not Potter himself, necessarily, though it was nice to see The Savior seemed not to hold grudges against any students. Potter had spent Blaise's first night in the room talking to him and Draco -who sat quietly and listened until Potter forced him to talk by persistently pestering him- about Quidditch.
Head Unspeakable Granger,
There was another distinct thump and then a moan. The four of them stared at the wall with rapt attention as moans of pleasure started to filter through. A slow smile spread across Luna’s face, and Neville blushed furiously.
Draco glared at him, turned to Pansy and said, “See? This is exactly what I’m talking about.”
"Albus?" Dad asked with a quick glance around the deck to confirm James' little brother wasn't here somehow.
“Show me how, I want to please you,” Harry said, his lips moving against Draco’s throat, soaking in the rush of his skin, “show me.”
Loire turned to the other girl, "Your friends are waiting for you in the great hall. You should both go home really." She turned back to Harry, "And you should consider coming in early to avoid your fan club, rather than late. No one ever shows up before 9am."
“What about Potter?”
Draco smirked, slipping his hands under Harry's shirt, the touch of his hands was hot and needy and Harry was more than ready to give. "I'm sure," Draco said, "You're used to people doing what you ask, but why would I quit?"
“Because no one ever asks if I won in a fight against a lion,” Draco said, lacing their fingers together, “they are just impressed that I survived.”
After they both buttoned back up, Harry had one arm tucked behind his head with the other wrapped around Draco, who was laying on Harry's chest. "That was brilliant," he said.
Three weeks into term Blaise walked through the common room and up to the boy's dorms. Draco has been subdued, keeping to himself as much as possible. He said his room wasn't too bad, he only spends time in there when he needs to sleep, but Blaise knew Draco had been sleeping on the couch in the common room several nights this week.
"Yeah," Harry said, his voice thick with longing, "that makes sense. I'm not known for getting attached easily or having obsessive behavior. I met Ron for a full 7 minutes before he became my best friend."
"I don't know why you think you would get a say in that matter," Draco said in clipped tones.
“Come on Harry, let’s teach Blaise how to play poker to get your mind off of things for a bit. It will help,” Neville left the room to get a deck of cards.
He gave her a warm smile, "Don't apologize, just don't bother lying to me until you're more convincing than a Gryffindor." He turned and pulled her towards the table where his grandparents were sitting.
“Come on,” James said, suddenly thankful for the knowledge that the blush he could feel would be hidden by the heat from the hot tub. “You can’t tell me you’ve never found anything like that in those journals.”
Draco smiled, leaned back in his chair and lifted a corner of fabric up, "It runs diagonally down to my hip bone."
"Draco, would you try on this jumper?" Blaise asked. "It's terrible for my skin tone but Pansy says you'll look perfect in it."
"Oh Merlin," Ginny whispered. When Harry looked back at the fire he could tell Ginny could see Draco. "This can't be happening," she said.
“You owe me an apology,” Blaise said. He knew it was a futile request. Malfoys do not apologize.
"I have. I did everything you asked,” Harry replied, flushing at the thought of choosing that collar.
When they were finished they walked back down the hall to the staircase. Astrid paused in front of Scorpius' room, "Would it be too weird for me to look at your wardrobe?" she asked.
Hermione finds him in the spare bedroom he and Ron slept in when this place was Order headquarters. He converted the room into a dueling room for practice and is currently swinging fists at a punching bag that is spelled to move around the room. He’s wearing grey joggers and no shirt, she can see the top of his black boxer briefs peeking out his joggers. As his body shifts to throw another punch Hermione can see the muscles shift across his back.
Draco captured his mouth in another kiss, slipping his hand down to press his palm against Harry's cock through his trousers. "Feel how hard you are? So needy for me. How are you going to get through the vows?"
“How do i activate it again?” Harry asks.
Licking his lips, Neville slid his thigh up again, and Blaise felt his entire body shudder from the contact. "Neville, please," Blaise said, "either let me leave or help me. I can't handle teasing right now."
Neville cocked an eyebrow, waiting him out.
"Ugh," Harry said, after Hermione smacked Ron and the shoulder, a faint blush on her cheeks. "You two have fun. I'm going to lock myself in my room and avoid the student body." With that he headed to his dorm.
Before Harry there stands a tall, posh, blonde bloke with Malfoy's face.
Blaise stared down at the two of them, letting the words sink in before asking, "Is it true your sister is no longer in marriage negotiations with Draco?"
on the moving bag.
over the last 24 hours."
"Even Slytherin's don't kiss without consent, Granger," Draco said, not quite meeting her eye. "There's a charm for the bottle so it only stops if both are willing to at least kiss." He peeked up at her, "I can teach it to you, if you like."
"Oh. Ok. Should I tell her-"
Harry cut him off, “Please Nev, I really need to talk to someone and I can’t go to Ron and Hermione with this.”
The host meets her at the door and offers his arm. "Ms. Granger, your table is ready for you."
Harry looked over at Parkinson. She was easy to spot, sitting next Malfoy at the table, in a red dress. "Yeah, sure, I guess I've noticed." He shook his head and pulled out the bottle of Ogden's from his bag. "I brought this, too."
by now?"
“Did you know about this?” Draco asked.
Draco lifted his eyes and looked at him for a long moment, "You really just want a kiss? This isn't about who I am?"
The eyes looking back at him are storm-grey paired with an all too familiar Malfoy smirk.
“We need to leave!” she said.
“Does Pansy know?” Hermione asks as they walk to the Leaky Cauldron. “About our agreement.”
"Don't boss me Potter." Draco’s hand, threaded through Harry’s hair, tugged lightly in admonishment.
"Wait, what?" Harry looked up at him, then at Dean who gave him a sly smile. "You’re together?"
"Yes," Draco replied, "or a black curtain." He leaned past George to see if he could spot anything hidden. "A back room of some sort?"
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Why is my order in a bag instead of on a tray?”
"I should punish you severely for that," Draco said. "However," here he looked pointedly down at his own cock, which was standing at attention and dripping a bead of precum onto the carpet, "I don't want to punish myself by making you wait."
Harry lifted an eyebrow at that, and Malfoy lifted his chin definitely, though Harry could see he was fighting a smirk. "So about that business proposition?" Harry asked.
"Actually you've got all of that wrong," Harry said, "My first kiss was in 4th year, with a boy," he finished boldly.
Draco stood outside Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, waiting for Potter. He'd explained on the way over that Hermione wanted Potter to come along so the staff was more amenable to answering Draco's questions. He had declined, in every way he could think of, to tell Potter what he was going to ask about. Hopefully he would get a moment alone with whoever was running the shop once Potter worked his magic.
"I just want to make sure you're here with me when I walk through this door," Teddy's words came out with warm puffs of air against James' cheek. "Magic is finicky and always changing, so it's best if we're touching when I open it."
"How long can I get you for with $300? That's all I have on me."
As Pansy passed Draco her dark eyes narrowed. A flash of surprise crossed his features briefly, which was quickly replaced by a smug smirk.
Harry blinked, realizing that Malfoy's familiar drawl was the voice he’d been getting turned on by for the last week.
"Go on," Dean said, "you were saying that Malfoy is ruining your life."
Potter's grin turns feral as he stalks forward. Draco backs up, unwilling to actually cast on the Golden Boy, until his back is against the wall. Potter fists Draco's shirt and pulls him forward into a filthy kiss that has Draco melting against him.
"You can borrow any book you like," Draco encouraged. "We have books older than even the ones here at Hogwarts."
Harry shrugged, "I needed to give something to Malfoy and," he motioned to Pansy, "she's kind of our interpreter. Malfoy and I still have a tendency to - um-"
Ron kissed her cheek, leering, and said, "I'd like to come together as a student body."
Harry washed his hands, as he talked, to remove the chicken stock that had leaked through the packaging. He looked through the window above the sink when a beak tapped the glass. A majestic eagle owl sat on the ledge.
Harry stopped, staring at the lovely cock before him and stupidly said, "No underwear?"
-Discuss music or movies.
Harry scoffed, "In this case you would need to fight with fiendfyre. She's a monster."
He looked up now, "I am I think."
"Harry," Hermione said, "just out of curiosity, did you even consider using a silencing charm or Muffliato?"
Draco made a face as though he'd just eaten an ear wax Bertie Bott's bean, "Why? Ignoring for a moment that she is a
Zabini hummed in response and said, "I don't suppose you have something sweet I could have instead?"
Neville chuckled, quickly converting the sound into a fake cough. “Sorry,” he said, biting back a smile as Draco turned a glare on him, “just, Blaise is right. You can’t possibly be upset about that. It's not like Blaise made badges and handed them out to the entire student body.”
Blaise walked into the Slytherin common room and beelined for Draco who was sitting on the plush couch next to the fireplace.
"Alright, I'm ready for whatever weird tasks you need me to do."
Dean looked and Ginny both looked at Seamus. He glanced at them both before addressing Blaise. "Why do you want to be in Harry's room?"
Harry peeked into the room and could see as Pansy unfolded her arms and began to tick things off on her fingers.
Harry scowled, "You realize I run a business remodeling wizard homes right?"
Draco huffed a laugh, despite feeling his cheeks heat. He glanced at the window to the ice cream shop, spotting Potter at the counter. There were a couple of people in line ahead of him, so Draco reasoned he should have a few minutes.
Harry huffed a laughed even as he felt his face heat, he took a moment to enjoy his ice cream before saying, “Why then. Why did you choose this line of work?”
He leaned down to show her the bracelet. “I think of who I want to send a message to,” he said and tapped the gold with his thumb and the word Scorpius appeared, “then I think of what I want it to say,” he tapped with his middle finger, the words shifted and said -
Anna's small smile bloomed into a broad grin. "Draco, you've got yourself a drarry fic."
"Oi. No working new leads while we are on a date. Besides, she said she’s not interested."
The Headmistress looked at Harry for a long moment, then turned back to Professor Loire. "You're right," she said slowly. "We don't need a heroic Gryffindor for this, we need someone who can take her down, no matter the consequences." She looked back at the boys and took a measured breath. "Mr. Malfoy," McGonagall said, and waited for him to meet her eye, "I think it's time your Father heard about this."
Should be posting by Wednesday!
Harry grins down at him, "How much have you had to drink?"
Outside of the office, Harry folded up the list and stuffed it into his pocket. "Do you want to come back to mine, then?" He didn't look up when he said it. Not when he'd spent so much time biting his own tongue to stop himself from flirting with Draco after ministry meetings. And now he'd just used the same line he would to pull a good looking bloke from the bar.

On the Hogwarts express Harry sat with Ron and Hermione. Both boys listened as Hermione excitedly talked about the study group she had signed up for. Unsurprisingly, it was a group of Ravenclaws and Hermione. Harry watched people walk by their cabin, he had cast a strong Notice-me-not so the steady stream of students did not try to come into their cabin.
"Pansy!" Blaise whispered angrily. He glanced around the common room to make sure no one was watching her make a scene. "What the hell are you doing?"
"Just describe it, whatever comes to mind, like you did with the Treacle tart."
Kreacher gave a quick bow and disappeared with a
objectification of women in that art! I mean, my god Pansy, look at the outfits!"
Hermione nodded, “How’s it going there? Is it still working out with Parkinson?”
His post orgasm brain wasn't firing at the right speed, making him far too honest. Harry heard himself whisper, "I don't think I have ever been this happy." He slipped his hand around Draco's cock, "I never want to touch anyone else like this for the rest of my life."
"It means dragon," she said easily.
too many times, the three of them were sat in a private room and fed fish and chips with butterbeer.
"Pansy!" Draco gave her a withering stare.
Blaise bit back a smile at hearing Potter's thought. He couldn't help but agree, Draco truly had a pert little ass. All round and fit from years of Quidditch. Once Draco got the jumper down and slipped it on, Blaise gave him a peck on the cheek saying, "It suits you. Wear it for dinner if you like."
Hermione's eyes narrow at the memory. Harry Potter was rarely smug and never subtle. Hermione knew for certain that he was up to something, but this was the first time in their long friendship that she had no idea what he was getting into. She is going to have to keep an eye on him.
"Just come on, and stop being so loud." Teddy looped back on the path to grab James' elbow and move him along towards the gargoyle statues.
Blaise shook his head, "No. Not exactly."
“Yes.”
“No. The letters didn’t go that far. I think Sirius moved in with your grandfather shortly after my dad came to visit. I found the password in my dad’s journal.”
Kingsley cleared his throat, and said, "That's not necessary. Thank you for the offer though," he finished, sounding more than a little uncomfortable. He looked back down at the copies he'd made from the file. On the top was a photo of Umbridge scowling at a Muggle-born witch, in the picture she snapped the woman's wand and tossed it on the floor. Kingsley looked back up, "Actually, we are rather crowded. If we can't find room for her, I will contact you about the dungeons in Malfoy Manor."
Hermione, bless her, seemed to know what he was trying to ask. “I don’t know Harry. I like him, I kissed him, I think we could be, you know, happy together.”
Malfoy carries conversation fluidly, dancing through several topics and giving Hermione the opportunity to place her own as well. Hermione watches him closely, trying to pick up on any tells that a reporter might notice. When they are through the meal Malfoy calls her out on it.
The look-alike is perfect. He's the right height, just a few centimeters taller than Harry. His white-blonde hair falls elegantly to his shoulders, with half of it pulled off his face. His eyebrow is cocked and there's a tight frown tugging his lips. His arms are folded around a file and
"Um," Harry said, "Harry Potter?" Much to his surprise, the door opened.
"In fact," Lucius said, drawing their attention, "I know that your cells are crowded at the moment. To show we are in solidarity, I'm happy to open up the lower levels of the Malfoy Manor if you need a place for Delores to serve out her imminent sentence."
For a moment Granger doesn't say anything either and they just stare at each other in an increasingly uncomfortable silence. Finally Granger puffs out her cheeks on an exhale and says, "All right. Well this is more awkward than I had imagined." She huffs a small laugh and meets Draco's eye, "Look, I need your help. Can we maybe sit down and talk?"
Draco wrapped his hands around the mug as though he was absorbing heat from it, "Well go on then Potter, let's hear it. Who was your first kiss?"
"So, what do you want from me?" Pansy asked, cracking one eye open to look at him.
Harry froze at the contact, his breath coming fast as though the air in the room had started to vacate. He looked at the two of them in the reflection, and thought,
“What?!” Harry cried.
She tugged gently at the copper sash around her waist, making sure it was properly snug, pulling in the fabric of her dress. The top was a teal satin that went up to her collar bone after the sash was a teal tool skirt with copper beading throughout. All of the boys were dressed in gunmetal grey suits, light teal button-ups, and copper ties. She had felt a bit jealous at how easy it was for boys to pick their outfits while she had to spend an hour trying not to hate every dress she tried on. When she’d found this one though, she felt it was worth it, this was the prettiest dress she’d ever been in.
Hermione leans back into the chair, lets her shoulders relax, and looks away from him. “All right, fine. I need you to go to Harry’s charity gala with me in September.” She adds the next sentence in a forced calm voice, “As my date.”
Both of them had howled with laughter of Harry's uncomfortable morning, and easily agreed to work on the Manor project, especially since the main goal seemed to be ticking off one Lucius Malfoy. As they sat there plotting, not only the remodel but ways to make it hell for Lucius, Harry's phone buzzed. He fished it out of his pocket and saw a message from Draco. Feeling his stomach flip, he quickly hit view.
Harry swallows hard through his dry throat and tries desperately to think of something
The tension in the room snapped when a partially translucent silver wolf burst through the wall. Draco jumped up, grabbing his wand, “Teddy’s Patronus.”
The metal is skin-warm and a zip of excitement runs through Harry. Charlie was one of the best lays he’d ever had, but the Gemini service might be fun enough to make up for the boyfriend. Harry smiles up at Charlie. "How do I use it?"
Blaise walked over to them and sat down next to Draco. "Are you lot going to miss dinner tonight?" he asked in lieu of a greeting.
"How did you even find out about these tunnels?" James asked.
Scorpius didn’t even blink before he gave his usual reply, “He’s not here.” He didn’t care that Harry was in the upstairs study. This reply was the same thing he said to everyone, regardless of Harry’s presence in the house. Draco and Harry had been together since Scorpius was three years old. At six, he had used his birthday to ask for them to be a real family and Harry had bought their house the next day, followed by a wedding in the gardens of Malfoy Manor 8 months later. With the six years that followed, Scorpius was well practiced at rebuffing the Harry Potter fans who came sniffing around.
George pulled Harry over and started talking about his brother Charlie leaving for Romania and brunch at the Burrow tomorrow. Harry shoved thoughts of the two girls away, and listened to him, happy for a distraction.
“What? What does that mean?”
Draco cuts him off. "Save it Potter." He reaches out and takes Harry's hand off the handle. Turning back to the blonde in the doorway. "You work for Blaise?"
Harry leaned his back against the wall, "I'm supposed to avoid stalking you," he said.
When Harry and the attractive blonde walked away together, Harry cast a brief glance back at Draco who was sending him a death glare. Warning bells went off in Harry's mind, which he easily ignored, as he flashed Draco a wicked grin.
, Harry thought,
Potter flashed him a broad grin, “And the goggles.”
he thought.
had sparked a month's worth of opinions from the public. During the public outrage, Draco and Harry had gone for ice cream, played with Orion, and shopped for a new flat near London's South Bank.

"Honestly, gentlemen, after this last stunt, I have half a mind to transfer one of them to a different house."
"What?" Harry asked dumbly.
"Ernie! I was worried this would be snakes only," Harry said happily, then winced in pain from Draco's elbow hitting his ribcage.
Pansy abruptly stopped laughing, "That's disgusting Potter," she said. Then after a moment, "I'm sad that wasn't in the interview," and started to laugh again.
A throat cleared and Harry's attention was pulled to the woman behind Luna. He walked up and put his hand out, "Hello, I'm Harry Potter."
Harry humms, getting distracted by the way Draco's elegant fingers are massaging his neck. “I hadn’t thought of that. I mean, I assumed they have someone who plays as me, or fucks as me, I suppose. But I hadn’t thought about who the person is in real life.” He grins at the idea and asks, “Do you think it’s someone I know?”
Please leave comments as I do use them for sustenance! 💕🙏🏾
Harry stepped in. “Hi,” he said awkwardly, his hands in his pockets.
Harry looked up at him, heaving a sigh and tried to decide how to answer. “Blaise, I wish either one of those ideas had even crossed my mind, it would make this a lot easier. Instead, all I could think about was the way his leather jacket fit, how his voice has been getting me hard for a week, and those fucking dragonhide boots.” As Harry talked he watched Blaise’s eyes go from inquisitive to saucer round with shock.
If Draco had thought through his past interactions with Potter then he would have seen it coming. It was always the same, after all, there was a pattern. He would instigate and rile Potter up until the Chosen Prat snapped and reacted. So, honestly, it should have been no surprise when he did just that. Harry moved with speed and force, forsaking grace altogether, and Draco found himself shoved against the stone wall of the hallway before he had even realized that Harry's hands had grabbed his robe.
Teddy, who had barely taken his eyes off of the
Neville looked down to his shuffling feet, which amused Harry. His dorm mate had grown into quite a figure during 7th year, and his confidence had bloomed under the pressure of leadership. Somehow though, Neville still seemed too shy to take a compliment.
Luna turned to Pansy and said, “Would you like a hug Pans? Or a radish?”
A brilliant heat spread across Harry's cheeks and down his neck. He felt it spread and cursed himself for being such an easy blush.
(See the end of the chapter for
Reaching the top of the staircase Blaise looked around at the other students, spotting Potter and a group of Gryffindors slumped against a wall. Blaise noted the lack of the Weasel before moving in the opposite direction to stand with Millicent who was alone. They exchanged a quick nod in greeting and Blaise set down his bag, Draco and Pansy following suit.
That pulled a reluctant chuckle from Harry until he firmly told himself to stay upset with her, pulled back from the hug and scowled at her. “I prefer when you meddle,” he said.
"Oh, I-" Harry swallowed trying to think of any reason to decline he could give that would sound convincing.
Draco stared at the last tag and the notes he'd written. How did he know that, about what Potter smells with Amortentia? He thought back to 6th year when they brewed in class. He remembered Hermione smelling the cauldron and saying something ridiculous about toothpaste. For the life of him he couldn't remember if Potter had told the class his smells or not. He must have though, how else would Draco have gotten that information? Perhaps it had been printed in the
“It didn’t matter. Malfoy was still an asshat.”
That was surprisingly easy.
“You know, I have an idea.” James reached back, fishing through his pile of clothes to grab his wand. “Albus taught me this spell. I think it will make this even better.” He held the wand up, drawing a line with a curl at the end to point at the water, and said,
"Well…" Draco trailed off, he had no idea what muggle gay stereotypes were. He felt completely wrong-footed, and sure that any answer would blow his cover. It's not that he'd never
"Same difference," Harry replied.
"Listen,” Draco said, “I still have a lot to figure out about muggle-borns and what my opinions are. But I'm working on it. What I do know is this, I'm not going to make any life decisions based on bloodlines. I can’t imagine the slayer of snakes is going to either."
When Anna set the ring on the table next to Harry’s ice cream Draco leaned close and said, “In 1991 I made you an offer that you declined,” Draco said, meeting Harry’s eye, “I’d like to give you another chance at taking my hand.”
"I'd much rather relive that part of the trip than the hangover," Harry replies, thinking of how good it felt to let Charlie pin him to the bed with those strong arms. “Shame you brought a date to my birthday party.”
That’s suspicious. Pansy is not only excellent at following Draco’s direction, she is also fond of gloating about how she often does what he asks her to do. Maybe she’s upset with him? Maybe she already knows what he wants to talk about? He watches her for a moment, gauging her, then says, “We need to talk.”
Hannah had enlisted the help of Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini to design the backroom, transforming it from a storage area into a low lit dance club. The room had its own bar, tended by Dean Thomas three nights a week while he was finishing his art degree.
When Draco turned back to meet his eye, Harry couldn't get a read on his expression. "Perhaps," Draco said, "you would like to tell me what that missorted Hufflepuff did to cause you to protect me over him?"
“Where is my son?”
Ron grinned, "I bet."
"How are you adjusting to the Wizarding world, Astrid?" Harry asked, setting the tea mugs on the table and sitting in the chair across from her.
Which had been the extent of it until Draco came to his first meeting in one of those suits and Harry’s definitely-not-a-crush had taken him by surprise.
"I did," she said, setting down the quill to look up at him. "I heard it from Hermione Granger when she came to collect my sister."
Say hi @dracos.tealsuit on Instagram
I hate Umbridge so much.
Neville, already blushing, drew in a stuttered breath, right before Blaise's lips made contact. It was soft, and sweet, until Neville shifted his hips and groaned into the kiss. Surprised, Blaise gasped and Neville took the opportunity to slip in a slick tongue against his own. As he pulled back, Blaise bit gently at Neville's plump bottom lip.
“Oh, yes.” A faint blush stole its way across Draco’s high-cut cheek bones. He took a longer sip of wine before replying. “To be honest, you didn’t give me a lot of comfortable options with the name of your youngest sprog. James was far easier to swallow as I never knew your father. But Albus Severus Potter?” Draco shrugged, not making eye contact. “I’m sure Scorpius doesn’t call him Potter at school.”
Please let me know if you're enjoying this! Your kudos are appreciated and your comments light up my day <3
he thought,
I'd probably be in the hospital wing right now."
Pansy had taken the bet eagerly stating "They don't have it in them to do something so against the heteronormative. Weaslete dated
“There must be something. I can’t live with this knowledge and do nothing about it.”
"I have good news," Blaise said, as he sat gracefully down next to the blonde, stretching out his long legs and crossing them at the ankles.
"Zabini thinks I'm gay," Harry whispered angrily.
"Ginny," Harry said her name firmly, and hoped it would imply that she should stop talking.
"I didn't turn the sign off though," Draco says, stuffing his shirt back into his trousers.
The dressing rooms were in the back corner of the store, behind a line up of suit jackets, varying in color through all fifty shades of grey. Harry couldn't help but feel secluded as they walked past the curtain to see 4 dressing rooms, two small couches, and a corner of mirrors, placed strategically so the viewer could assess all angles of their future purchases.
"At least we're at the bargaining stage," Hermione said quietly.
“Fuck,” he heard Draco breathe, the word choking on a gasp, before Draco’s fingers deftly undid Harry’s trousers. He leaned forward, letting a kiss swallow the sound of Harry’s moan, when Draco’s right hand slid down and brushed against Harry’s straining erection, through his boxers.
He pointed to the door on his left, "You're looking for that one, I’m 392. Good luck with your drive," he said.
And this,
When they reached the door Teddy paused, turning to face James. His face lit by
“I’m not stupid enough to get involved with some starry-eyed fan. As for Krum, the last thing I need is another quidditch obsessed jock who can’t hold an interesting conversation,” she says.
Harry cocked his head, “So, why do you live in an apartment? Did you just want space?”
- he heard the bathroom door open.
Scorpius looked like he was holding back a comment. Astrid smiled, "Can you show me some magic?"
Once inside the now empty common room, the three of them looked over the room listings:
"Any time Harry," Kingsley replied. "I don't suppose you would like to tell me why your mixed up with a family of pure bloods?"
A flash of anger went through Hermione’s eyes, “Well I hope she wasn’t offensive!”
Draco shudders at the idea of conversing with his parents about Potter. He glances up at his boyfriend and manages to push those thoughts from his mind.
Draco set down the dark green shirt and held the other one up to himself again, nodding in agreement. "Not that you know much about pale skin," he said, eyeing the Harry's collarbone. Any reply Harry was going to make died when the sandy haired sales clerk approached them.
Astrid could tell he didn't want to give more details and she had learned from interviewing WWII soldiers, for a project in 3rd grade, that it was difficult to discuss a war directly if you'd had to fight in it. However, that didn't mean she wanted to give up this opportunity to talk to Harry.
Draco shook her hand, “Nice to meet you, Emily.”
If you made it this far you might be into edging.
Hermione leaned in to hug Harry and said, “You have enough between you to work out without someone here to meddle, and there’s no way I could keep my mouth shut.”
"Try not to let your stark views on what's right and wrong take over this meeting." Narcissa said, and though her tone had a crispness, it was not cruel. She began to walk the same way Lucius had gone.
Since then he had put together a renovation business that was thriving in the post-war world. By May 2001 he'd done 7 renovations, hired a part-time team to help with building, hired an assistant, and moved into this new apartment.
For a brief moment Harry saw a look of concern on the girl's face before it was covered by her more common expression of indifference.
Scorpius thought.
His hair was tousled, with fringe falling softly over his face.
“I also think the assignment would be a complete nightmare for any pure-blood wizard to work. Naturally, I thought of you as the best man for the job.”
Next to him stood Mr. Malfoy.
After potions, Blaise went back to the common room, intent on getting through his herbology homework that was due tomorrow. Draco's words had been interrupting his thoughts all day. He sat down at the table, with Pansy and Daphne, and started to unpack his bag.
“Are you cold?” he asked. Draco shook his head but pulled his knees up to his chest and wrapped his arms around them, pressing the arches of his feet into the bedframe. Weasley was still talking, but was now speaking about how the locket (had Potter had the locket on him?) had been opened and he hesitated for a second before Potter cut in.
"Children who converted to the light after the War? Children who were disowned after denouncing Voldemort?" he asked, ignoring Malfoy's flinch.
“I’m very certain, Severus,” he replied and Draco, unable to wait any longer, banged on the door. There was a frantic round of rustling, and then Snape called ‘
“Could you get a fire going?” she asked Draco, who nodded and began to collect twigs and dry leaves from around them. He had to laugh at himself slightly – a year ago and he wouldn’t have dreamed about doing anything like this, but here he was, scrounging around on the ground for twigs and leaves and sticks that he could use to get a fire started without any magic.
“They said they’d be here Lily, they must be in the crowd,” her mother said, adjusting the strap of her handbag over her shoulder. She looked around as well, her own red hair cropped short and shining bright in the early autumn sunlight that streamed from the skylights overhead. She obviously spotted who she had been looking for because she smiled and waved. “They’re over by the train, let’s go! Sasha, don’t bash anyone with your trolley please,” she snapped at her son and he looked over his shoulder with a mischievous grin, his hair dark and his eyes a warm brown.
Goyle screamed as he was hauled onto the broom behind Draco, sending them pitching. A great Chimaera of flame hissed at them as they rolled too close and swiped it’s giant claws at them as Harry righted them, pulling them into a steep climb that felt too slow, too heavy. Goyle’s hands were heavy on Draco’s hips, holding on tightly, as Harry forced them into a sharp turn.
!” The spell came before Draco could even blink and his wand was whipped out of his hand, flying in an arc for Potter to catch. He gaped as Potter snatched it out of the air and stood, brushing down his jeans as his glasses caught the firelight, the lens flaring gold for a second. His jeans were stained with mud at the knees and his jumper was fraying at one of the sleeves cuffs, but Draco had never been happier to see anyone in his life, even if he had just taken Draco’s wand.
in woodland, sending them sprawling onto the icy ground. Granger sobbed and Draco groaned and Potter let out a strange strangled cry. Draco looked up to find Potter convulsing on the ground next to him, his eyes white as they had rolled back, his limbs jerking erratically. Granger moaned to herself and scrambled over to him, wrapping an arm around his waist.
’ and scanned the questions laid out before him. He had to choose three of the 78 questions from the list in front of him to answer, and it was key that he chose the right ones. He flipped over the booklet to the second page and took in the questions there, pausing over a likely one.
’ and Draco slipped into the room.
he loved you,” Potter dropped his arms to his sides, all the fight gone out of him.
“No idea!” he shouted back, and then they settled in again, tucking themselves low over the dragon's back. It was flying them more and more North, Draco could tell by the North Star that began to twinkle overhead as the sun slowly sank on their left.
His office was in disarray, with files lain across every surface, and one wall requisitioned for some sort of Case Summary which included a very complicated spider diagram (possibly showing the connections between several Death Eater families), and list of names, with a few crossed out. Harry recognised Hermione's handwriting, Merlin help him.
“Good,” and then there was a yelp of pain from the goblin and a
Hermione stormed in first, her face a picture of fury, her jaw clenched so tightly Draco could see a vein popping in her temple. She flicked her wand aggressively and the lights of the tent flared around them, making Draco blink in the sudden light. Behind her was Weasley, pleading and defensive at the same time, his backpack hanging off one shoulder. His jacket, Draco could now see, was sodden through and his hair was plastered to his head.
Around dawn, he saw Harry slide out of his sleeping bag and followed. Harry woke Weasley, avoiding Dean and they quickly changed in the semi-darkness before creeping out into the garden. The stars still shone, albeit weakly, overhead as they wound their way to the overlook, Harry holding Draco’s hand in the early morning light. Dobby’s grave, with it’s headstone reading ‘Here Lies Dobby, a Free Elf’, had become part of the landscape now, and a few green shoots were appearing from the now flat earth.
“Harry is their friend. He's also their teacher. A lot of these students were in Dumbledore’s Army with us, they trust Harry and they want to help him,” she explained. Draco frowned.
“Do you think we should have children?” Draco asked, waving as Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Viktor began to slip away from them, the platform falling away. The question had come up a few times in the last year, and it was one Draco dwelled on at night when he couldn’t sleep. Harry, warm and real, hummed next to him, slipping his fingers through Draco’s.
“Don’t be,” he replied in a soft voice and then stepped away. He brushed a hand over his cheek again, wiping away the tears that remained and then he looked back at the place that the owl had been. “Do you think you could do it again?” he asked and Draco drew his wand, knowing that the kiss he just had would fuel a million Patronuses.
