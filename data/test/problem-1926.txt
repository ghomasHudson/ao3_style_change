His brain ticked backward, and a dozen tiny moments Harry hadn’t questioned suddenly clicked into place.
“Merlin, Malfoy,” he cried, “I’m so sorry! I should have known you wouldn’t want to apparate after what happened.”
“That’s when Lavender hit me with the body-bind, and I just couldn’t take anymore. I was so worried about you, and I just – twisted out of it. I wasn’t thinking about the fight at all.”
“I’m glad to see you’ve learned to use the door,” she said, “like a proper customer. Last time, I thought you were some sort of deranged burglar!”
“I’m in the middle of something,” Malfoy replied, and the words stitched a pattern of despair into Harry’s heart.
“Will you bring that tea over sometime?” Harry asked, nudging him gently with a shoulder. “I’d like to taste it.”
Break something, then? Or knock something over? Make a mess? Cook a giant meal, more than he could possibly eat?
Finally, Harry shuffled closer and casually rested a hand on Draco’s thigh. The muscle jumped under his touch, and Harry could tell Draco was holding his breath. He moved his hand slowly up the inside of Draco’s leg, just barely brushing his balls before continuing down the opposite thigh.
“When anyone fell ill, Draco knew just what potion would help. He brewed them all himself. He even healed my arm for me, after Bellatrix broke it.”
managed to bake a passable imitation of at least three of her signature treats were allowed to meet with Draco.
But still, there was a tiny tremor to Draco’s movements and his grip on Harry’s hand had increased to the strength of a vice. Harry winced, but did not try to make Draco let go. He knew that Draco half expected to be tossed out on his arse the second he dared cross the Weasleys’ threshold. And as much as it broke Harry’s heart to admit it, he also knew that Draco believed he deserved such a harsh dismissal.
After several seconds of silence, Harry darted a hopeful glance up at Malfoy. The other man was still frowning, but Harry thought it might be a confused frown rather than an angry one. His heart leapt, quite without his permission. Harry frowned then, annoyed with himself. He was
Harry laughed. It was the same speech she had given them when they opened their joint Christmas gift – a hamper with a permanent preservation charm on it, full of treacle tarts and autumn shortbread, and two round-trip portkey tickets to Peru.
With an involuntary sigh, he shook off the feeling and answered Draco. “I was trying to attach my new shelf to the wall, but I couldn’t get the right wand angle from the floor. I scrounged up that ladder from the garden shed. I guess it’s seen better days.”
Harry propped his chin on Draco’s shoulder and stroked his arms soothingly. “What happened when you went to Azkaban? What did your father do?”
Draco looked up at him, tears in the corner of his eyes. A muscle jumped in his stomach and his legs were beginning to tremble. “No,” he breathed out. “It’s just – so much. You feel so
Ron sputtered in feigned outrage and Harry laughed, finally beginning to unwind. Hermione rolled her eyes at them fondly and hefted a sheaf of parchment out of her bag. In between Harry’s Cannons insults and Ron’s attempts to defend his beloved team’s (mediocre, at best) players, Hermione told them about her progress learning to draft legislation. She was only an intern at the Department of International Magical Cooperation and wouldn’t be in a position to propose new laws for years, but Hermione always had believed in being prepared. Besides, she would likely die of boredom without an intricate research project to consume her free time. Harry found himself smiling softly at the thought, grateful that his clever friend now had the time to pursue subjects of her own choosing, rather than scrambling for miracles to save Harry from Voldemort’s latest plot.
, Harry was sure of that. There are some things you can’t share without ending up in an unspoken cease fire, and discovering a mysterious magical phenomenon in a place where you both almost died is one of them.
Sixth year schoolboy grudges were one thing, and heroic, empathetic testimonies were quite another. But distracted musings about Malfoy’s oddly diverse spice purchases
“I’m alright,” Harry said. He brushed his lips against Draco’s in quiet thanks, then moved to lean against the arm of the sofa. With a light tug, he got Draco to move closer, sitting with his back against Harry’s chest. “Tell me more about the orphanage.”
“It was about eleven o’clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills,” Harry read. “I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn’t care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be.”
The conversation ground to a halt as the movements of the children picked up speed. The precision of the display was quite impressive, as odd as it looked for them to be essentially fighting the air. A few minutes later, after a particularly intricate sequence of high kicks, the children bowed to their instructor, turned and bowed toward each other, then capered off the mat in all directions, running into parents’ waiting arms. There was a smattering of applause.
Harry closed his eyes, mind whirring back to an idea he’d had the night before. As far as he understood it, Aperiomancy was advanced, highly temperamental magic. It required a thorough understanding of theory, precise wand movements, and ironclad focus, and even if you got all that right, it still might not work.
Draco let out one last shuddering sob and dropped his head into his hands. This time, when Harry wrapped his arms around him, Draco did not resist.
The corner of Draco’s mouth quirked up. “Every bloody day,” he promised. His smile shifted into something sheepish. “I may have already acquired the Hogwarts teaching fellowship paperwork. From the Headmistress. It’s on the desk in your old bedroom –” he bit his lip, then rushed to say - “only if you want it, of course.”
“Sort of?” Harry hedged. “But there’s not really a spell to get yourself out of a full body-bind, and Shield Charms are just supposed to block, not physically affect your opponent – so it seems like it kind of changed the spells.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. His fingers were still a bit tingly, but he had finally stopped shaking. He tucked his hands into his armpits and shuffled closer to the fire. “Thanks.”
But Draco didn’t know how to fix this, didn’t know what to do, what to say. His silence widened the trench between them, and all at once, Harry’s face shuttered, his eyes narrowing into scornful slits, the light in the window winking out.
Draco crunched into a crisp, then made a face and squinted down at the package. They were Harry’s favorite, cinnamon and sugar flavored – admittedly not the best choice to compliment savory sandwiches, but he could never resist them. Draco continued to chew skeptically, peering at the remaining crisps with a vaguely mistrusting expression. After he swallowed though, he licked his lips, a reluctant smile pulling at the corners of his mouth.
They crowded into a warded-off corner of the shop, everyone chatting and helping themselves to the excessive spread of biscuits and pastries Maeve had laid out before Hermione cast the privacy spells.
“Yeah,” Harry said, then paused until Draco managed to breathe his tension out. “She was worried about potions being made from the turtles’ shells. I told her my boyfriend was working on different kinds of potions, ones that won’t need to kill animals and insects.”
The door opened easily enough, but as he stepped across the threshold, he had bounced back, obstructed by some kind of invisible barrier. Confused, then slightly panicked, Draco had hammered at it with increasingly frantic fists, but it had not budged.
He cast something that made the air in front of them light up with glowing lines and symbols. They bowed their heads over it, pointing at different spots and conferring in terse whispers.
“Why are you sitting like that?” Blaise Zabini asked in his deep, melodious voice. He crossed his arms and smiled cheekily at Draco. “You look like you’re posing for a photograph that nobody asked for and less than nobody wants to see.”
Frowning, Harry reclaimed his seat. The steaming plate of fish and chips that had arrived while he was gone suddenly looked less appealing. He popped a chip into his mouth forlornly.
“Ariana Banesbury,” Draco said quietly, running a fingertip over her signature. “Did you speak to her as well as Evan?”
“Oh, Draco,” Harry murmured. He scooted closer to sit face-to-face with Draco, their knees touching. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry reached out and clasped Draco’s hands, massaging them gently until his fingers unclenched.
“I’ll build a fire,” Harry said, guessing that Draco still needed the comfort of the fresh air blowing in through the open windows, however cold it got.
“Thank you,” Harry said, and he hoped Draco knew that he meant for all of it. For breakfast and his company, for not looking at Harry like he was broken, for being clever and interesting and creating the best tea Harry had ever drank.
The lock shuddered without opening, which only increased Harry’s alarm. If the door was warded, then something very wrong must be happening inside.
Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s, smoothing his thumbs over Draco’s cheeks. And then, without any warning, he swept an arm behind Draco’s knees and scooped him up in his arms. Draco gave a strangled yelp of shock and delight, before protesting loudly (and insincerely) as a beaming Harry carried him up to bed.
Still, it came as a relief when the plates were finally empty and Draco was able to slip away to the bedroom, where he had stored the cakes. He needed a minute away from Harry, just to properly catch his breath.
disappointed when Draco left, even when they had spent practically the whole day together. But as much as that look had tugged at Draco’s heartstrings, he had always been able to rationalize it as a symptom of Harry’s loneliness, rather than any real attachment to Draco himself. In this moment though, Harry was not alone. Weasley was here.
– “and it would be wise to consider the merits of each. However, please know that I intend to spend the next months wooing you with expensive equipment, internship opportunities, and private mentoring sessions with witches and wizards at the top of the Potions field.”
“Draco,” Maeve said, looking straight into his eyes. “Everything you want to know, you will. I’m not leaving forever. This is a lifetime partnership, young man,” she added, tone shifting toward sternness. “Do you understand? You’re not ever getting rid of me.”
Harry shifted toward Malfoy and cleared his throat awkwardly. “Malfoy, speaking of the Manor –” Malfoy’s entire body tensed. Harry could practically see the walls going up, but he stubbornly continued. “I never thanked –”
“What?” Harry said. “No, Gin, don’t worry about it. Things are good, really good. I just have to be patient, show him it’s all true.”
Hermione darted a look out the window, then slipped from the room, likely to save the gnomes from drowning. Everyone else began to arrange themselves around the table, even Ginny and George, who appeared to have reached a temporary truce.
Harry whined, then leaned back, dragging Draco with him to the ground. He flipped them over effortlessly, pinning Draco beneath him and chasing his mouth.
“Yes.” Draco hesitated. But then he placed his hand over Harry’s and his expression grew serious. “And –” He took a steadying breath. “I’ve never felt this close to another person. You make me feel – safe.” Draco swallowed noticeably and his eyes went soft around the edges. He finished in an intimate whisper. “You make me feel
Draco adjusted his feet, perfecting his stance, and Harry felt the tendons in his wrist move as he tightened his grip on his wand.
“Fascinating,” Granger whispered, tapping a finger against her lips. “I mean, if they’re not suppressing you in some way, then there probably isn’t any kind of magical interference happening, but it’s still good to know that the apparition doesn’t show up on the trace. I’m not sure what that means yet, but it must mean
“She also said –” Draco smoothed his hair back with a shaking hand, then took a steadying breath. “She said she could feel my – my suffering, while she was in the Manor dungeons, that she knew I was just as trapped as she was. She said she knew I had tried to help her, and that the knowledge of my attempt had kept her warm during the cold nights.”
The fact that Harry was voluntarily seeking him out sent a shiver of pleasure up Draco’s spine. He straightened his tie and moved closer to the fire.
In the end, he grumpily ate an apple summoned from the tree in the corner of the garden and fell asleep spreadeagled in his overgrown grass.
“Yes, yes, I’m sure you suffered terribly, Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes. But then he leaned forward, hands clasped and elbows on his knees. “Please tell me,” he begged, the shift in tone abrupt enough to be comical. He was almost quivering in anticipation, like a delicate bud first opening its petals to the sun.
The raw honesty of that staggered Harry, the words whirling around him until he was blinded by the past. For a long moment, all he could see was sixth-year Draco, drawn and desperate and miserable, lashing out at Harry. Draco, torn open and bleeding on the bathroom floor.
“Er – what?” Harry said. He blinked rapidly, trying to stave off the sudden pressure behind his eyes.
Draco sipped from his own cup before answering. “Lightning Storm Heartache,” he mumbled, averting his eyes.
“I know.” Harry kissed Draco tenderly, wiping away a stray tear with a gentle sweep of his thumb over Draco’s cheek.
Draco’s hands dropped involuntarily from his ears, palms smacking against the table. He did not even register the sting. “I’m sorry, what?”
Draco forced himself to relax his muscles. “Yes, you’re really getting in the way of my reading, Potter,” he tossed off, his face a mask of playful irritation.
Silence crept in around them again, their breaths mingling in the prelude to sleep. Everything was warm and safe and heavy, cocooned as they were by love and whispered words.
It was early yet and the grounds were deserted, but Harry enjoyed watching the owls swooping toward the West Tower, returning after a long night and settling in to sleep the day away. The air had the crisp, almost minty feel of approaching snow, tempered by the scent of spices and woodsmoke that always seemed to linger on the wind when Hogwarts’ fires were burning. Strolling along like this, with Draco’s crisp vowel sounds washing over him and safe in the knowledge that they had beaten the hooks, Harry felt more content than he had in a long time. It was all so pleasant that he almost started to whistle, though that likely would have alerted Draco to the fact that Harry wasn’t really listening to him.
“Life-debts dissipate naturally once they’ve been fulfilled,” Hermione shrewdly pointed out. “So I assume the best course of action is for you to continue helping each other, and eventually the apparition will stop on its own.”
Draco’s cock finally sprang free and Harry stared at it for a long moment. Tongue darting out to wet his lips, he wrapped his hand around Draco and began to pump.
He ached to tell Draco that it was ok, that the Dark Mark was just another scar, that it didn’t define him, that there was no part of Draco that repulsed Harry, no part of him that Harry could ever hate.
Harry moaned. “Fuck. Draco.” His eyes were locked on Draco, his own movements beginning to slow as he watched Draco wank himself.
After a brief exchange in which Harry convinced Lavender to join the Brixton Kickboxing Club rather than relying solely on Harry to train her, Lavender hugged them both goodbye and rushed off to meet Parvati Patil for a late breakfast. Draco had been so shocked by the embrace that he stumbled and almost fell when Harry gently tugged him toward the door. Harry had laughed and kissed Draco’s cheek before twining their fingers together. They were outside and down the street before Draco even realized they had left the building.
After one last, desperate look at the space beside Draco, where he’d much rather be heading, Harry swallowed down his fear and ducked into Madam Pomfrey’s office.
When his bowl was empty, Harry leaned back in his chair with a satisfied smile. “You know, Draco –” he said, crossing his hands behind his head. He fell silent, studying Draco with an intensity that felt like a thousand fire ants crawling beneath his skin.
Apparently, the antique shop specialized in magical scavenger hunts, and anyone who had solved a clue was invited to return and leave behind an object of their own, as long as it would lead the lucky buyer to a similarly majestic location. Each clue and solution were thoroughly vetted before being put on sale, and Blaise had become rather obsessed with getting one of his own ideas approved by the persnickety shop owner.
“Yes. After I –” Malfoy swallowed hard - “after I spent a lot of time in that part of the woods. Potter, those flowers all produced that same golden dust. That’s the only other time I’ve seen it.”
– like you wanted to solve it, and it lit you up inside, and I just knew that’s who you were supposed to be – this clever, curious person –
In the classroom or on the grounds with Malfoy, it was all a game – so far removed from reality that Harry couldn’t fear it. When he thought about it in the context of real life though – as a career, or in response to a new darkness that he did not yet understand – all he could remember was the relief of dying, and the burden it had been to realize he’d come back.
Harry briefly rested his head against Draco’s and then turned to him. He grasped Draco’s shoulder and looked directly into his eyes. “The book’s accurate, Malfoy, and your sacrifice was no less deserving than mine.”
Draco’s stomach swooped unpleasantly. He may not be as fearful of Maeve’s departure as he once was, but he still did not like being reminded of it. “Of course you have to leave as soon as I get my magic back,” he grumbled, hiding his moment of disquiet with a scowl.
By the time Harry and Draco emerged from each other, Tahlyn, McGonagall, and Pomfrey had administered the potion to all four patients. They were sleeping calmly, the residue having released them from its grip.
McGonagall drew her wand, but clearly did not know how to help. She looked desperately between Tahlyn and Draco. “I thought we’d have more time!” Her voice was rough, anguish written across every tense line of her body. “I’ll send for Horace. Perhaps he can –”
in all the time we’ve been –” Draco chewed his lip for a moment, then finished crossly – “whatever it is we’ve been doing.” He arched one regal brow, but the gesture could not hide the sadness clouding his eyes.
“There was Death Eater magic everywhere!” Harry insisted, voice raising now. “There’s something else, something you’re not telling me.”
Harry wet his lips and crowded in closer to Draco. “But now – I think sending it would have forced me to understand something I wasn’t ready to understand.”
belong here, as if he would always be welcome. As if Harry wanted Draco there any time he chose to come.
“I’m afraid I don’t know much about it,” Draco said. “I’m not involved, really. I simply outlined the mission of the organization, set a few parameters, ensured that a quality board was chosen, and then signed over the money. I didn’t even know what it was called.”
They stayed like that a few minutes longer, just holding each other, needing to know that losing the apparition bond had not unraveled them, needing to prove that they still belonged in each other’s arms.
McGonagall folded the note neatly and tucked it into the pocket of her robes. “I am needed back at the castle.” She gathered her cloak more tightly around her and began to stride away.
And then George’s voice broke off. A hush descended, an eerie silence replacing their friends’ muffled laughs and whispers.
Harry reached out and snagged a lock of Draco’s hair. “Thinking about me, then?” he asked smugly, twirling the fine blond strands around his finger.
Their eyes met then, and Harry’s shy smile was so at odds with the wild, debauched look of the rest of him, that Draco could not help the breathless laugh that escaped. Eyes sparkling like the sun, Harry collapsed backward, pulling Draco with him until they were cuddled together in a tangled, sated heap.
Harry swallowed what he could, continuing to suck gently until Draco tugged him off. Harry smiled up at Draco’s sweaty face, his mouth hanging open blissfully and hair wild against the pillows. He lay boneless on the bed, panting, as Harry licked him clean.
you I was different. But this is too important. You’re too important. And I don’t want anything to be left unsaid between us.”
Draco grimaced, then shot Maeve a skeptical look. “I have never heard anyone say that in my life.” Maeve stared back at him implacably, mirroring his expression. When she did not respond, Draco muttered, “What does that even mean?”
Harry was sitting at the kitchen table, where he’d been for at least forty-five minutes, patiently listening to Draco rail against Blaise; the entirety of Slytherin house; good-for-nothing, interfering friends; and joke shops, in general. But now he was holding out a hand to Draco, face troubled.
“It shouldn’t,” he insisted. The words were coming in breathless gasps. “It wasn’t enough. I shouldn’t have just fed you. I could have broken you out.”
“Perhaps the flowers affect the residue somehow?” Draco mused. He straightened and resumed his finger tapping as his eyes darted around the room. “What if we brought some of them to the forest, to the place where you cast the spells?”
Draco sighed. “It might not. But I realized that we know next to nothing about magical architecture. If we could find a reference to this type of spontaneous flower growth, we might be able to learn what causes it –”
the future of the Potions field, Mr. Malfoy.” McGonagall frowned down at him then, as if she were scolding him. “It is high time you recognized your value.”
Harry hesitated only a moment before knocking. But as the sound echoed down the long corridor, he realized he had no idea what he was going to say.
“What you’re talking about,” Draco said, voice suddenly soft and unsure. “What you’re talking about is – a life.”
Draco gaped at her. True, he had charmed the headscarf to look as though it contained the eddies and currents of a real ocean, but Maeve should not have been able to determine that without looking at it.
The anniversary of his parents’ deaths had felt different somehow, this first year after the war. The grief was inexplicably sharper, as if the struggle against Voldemort had been insulating Harry against the true extent of the loss. Without the looming threat of battle, without a villain to defy, Harry suddenly didn’t know where to channel his pain.
“I really am sorry, Harry,” Draco said, once Harry had emptied the second plate and placed it on the table. “I should have thought about the barriers. Pushing you out like that was selfish of me.”
A sudden wind whipped up around them then, warm and teasing, billowing their clothes and blowing their hair into their eyes. Draco laughed, the sound surprisingly joyful. Tilting his head back, he lifted his arms to better catch the breeze. Harry drank in the sight of him, wanting to memorize every line, every carefree angle.
“He just really likes cooking,” Harry said nonchalantly, though privately he couldn’t help feeling a bit smug.
About coming back to the dorm and locking himself in his bedroom and casting spell after spell. About clenching his eyes shut and chasing the shockwaves of his own magic. About the lethargy that had settled over him. The sudden and overwhelming thickness of the air. How he’d had to flee outside to escape it, and then found himself trying yet again by the edge of the lake.
“I just thought –” Harry’s mouth worked silently for a moment. He wasn’t sure how to explain it all to McGonagall. “I thought if he could see that people have good things to say about him, then maybe it will help him to – to get over some of his guilt.”
They were both leaking with need when they finally helped each other wrestle down their trousers, refusing to halt the kiss even to undress. Harry’s hands dipped beneath the waistband of Draco’s boxers.
“That’s what you’re doing with your Potions theories, dear,” Maeve said, turning to Draco. “Looking for ways to activate the inert magic that exists within Muggle ingredients. Didn’t you realize?”
Draco froze, a look of embarrassment crossing his face. He wiped his palms against his trousers and stepped determinedly, if stiffly, away from the wall.
Harry gnawed at the inside of his cheek, but then he braced himself and just said it. “Will you keep telling me I don’t have to be an auror?”
But then he had glanced at the windowsill. It was a small movement, eyes darting back to his desk almost instantly, but Harry had followed his gaze. And there was the blue wildflower from Harry’s garden, carefully transplanted into a pot of fresh soil and positioned to catch the light of the sun.
to be happy, that’s why I requested the teaching fellowship application in the first place, because it really seems to fit your skills and personality and I really do think you would enjoy it, but you will have so many other opportunities, I mean, every wizarding door will be open to you, it’s not like it is for me, with all the mistakes I’ve made, it’s a miracle I have a future at all – but you, Harry! You could do literally anything, and I want you to choose for you and not just settle for the first good thing that falls in your lap, and I promise to support whatever decision you make, but you should get to make that decision yourself and I’m sorry I said yes like that, you should have had the chance to think about your own decision without knowing mine –”
Sunlight poured into the bedroom like an unwelcome guest, growing more demanding with Harry’s every breath. The dream fractured, and Harry was left to greet the day, alone in his bed and achingly, desperately hard.
Determined to keep his promise to teach Draco, Harry had been testing out the different techniques he had brainstormed for working with students. He found ways to verbalize the abstract process, giving Draco an outline to follow, and even managed to use his own Sentiomancy to push against Draco’s magic and give him something specific to look for. It had been a slow process, but Draco was beginning to recognize patterns in magical residue and develop his own sense of what different spells felt like, and Harry had been able to add pages of new ideas to his Hogwarts application.
What Draco felt when he first kicked off the ground defied description. It was a nameless, rushing joy that cut to the bone as surely as did the wind.
But every time, Draco would grow pale, fidgeting with his ring while trying to nod encouragingly at Harry. So Harry had given up, knowing that nothing he said would be enough to ease Draco’s discomfort. No, Draco would steel himself for ire and rejection right up until the moment it did not happen. Or past that, even. Draco could probably date Harry for twenty years and still resign himself to the possibility of the Weasleys abruptly turning on him.
“You’re Harry Potter! The hero of the wizarding world! And I’m sorry, I know you don’t like to be referred to like that, and that is not what I mean, not really, it’s just you’ve already done so much
Draco didn’t emerge from beneath his arm, but his voice was stronger this time. “Harry, oh Harry – your
There might be a part of him that would always hate Draco Malfoy, but Harry would never tire of seeing those grey eyes light up with unanswerable questions.
“The view is lovely –” Draco cracked an eye open to look up at Harry – “and I’m rather enjoying the company.”
Luna interrupted then, extracting two scarves and handing them to Ron and Hermione with an impish grin. Ron’s was bright orange and Hermione’s a warm, chocolate brown.
Draco was soft, but he hardened quickly beneath Harry’s caressing fingers. He threw his head back, mouth opening in shock and pleasure.
Harry leaned into the touch. Malfoy gazed at him, eyes so earnest and soft that Harry thought he might die of it.
They locked eyes, sharing a warm rush of affection for Maeve. Draco looked away first, shrouded once more in sorrow.
Harry was spared answering when Hermione yawned and announced that she was heading to bed. As she walked toward the dormitories, Ron gave Harry a sheepish look, his eyes trailing after his girlfriend.
“The biggest have a circum – er, circum-fer-ence,” she said slowly, sounding out each syllable, “of thirty feet.”
Harry’s heart sank, but he refused to let the dismay touch his face. Bad enough that Draco had endured Azkaban at all, without feeling like he had failed at his self-appointed mission.
Tahlyn slashed her wand violently and the wailing noise stuttered out. Luna dropped to the bed and stopped moving.
Draco was baiting him, Harry realized, distracting him with banter so he’d forget to be embarrassed. It was such an odd way of being kind, such a
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat, not sure how to put it into words. He resisted the urge to get up and start pacing the kitchen. “I miss cooking for her, and having her in bed at night. I miss having someone to talk to. I miss the smell of her shampoo in the shower and making her laugh. I miss the cottage being alive. Now it’s just –” he looked down at his palms as he whispered the last word – “empty.”
Harry moved his own hand to the seam of his trousers and trailed a fingertip over the buckle of his belt. “Draco,” he breathed seductively.
made things right with Malfoy. He couldn’t risk losing him again, couldn’t stand the thought of making Malfoy uncomfortable and watching him pull away.
A growl rumbled low in Harry’s throat and he surged forward, capturing Draco’s lips. Draco met him with surprising fervor, kissing back desperately for one, two, three blissful seconds. Then he broke away, leaving Harry reeling.
And there he was. White gold hair artfully arranged and gleaming in the sun, a strange contrast against his sickly pallor and the deep circles beneath his eyes.
Blaise dragged a chair over and sat opposite him, loosening his tie and propping his feet up on the corner of the desk. Draco scowled as he rescued some of his papers, but did not otherwise protest. Blaise would actually have been quite a pleasant surprise if Draco hadn’t gone and gotten himself all tangled up in hope and Harry Potter. As the sting faded, he found himself able to look up and smile at his friend.
After a tour, Harry had met with Blooms’ Headmistress, Cynthia Vandersprite. Her office was comfortable and inviting, and she had made Harry feel right at home. No star-struck wonder, no invasive questions, no probing comments. Cynthia had treated Harry like a normal volunteer, offering him tea, showing off some endearingly hideous art projects, and listening attentively to his thoughts about how he would like to get involved.
It had been a lovely afternoon, whiling away a few hours with Harry. Strolling through outdoor markets and chatting idly, sipping mulled cider after a lunch of Greek kabobs. Despite the overcast sky and sporadic rain drizzles, Draco somehow never felt the chill. He had been too aware of Harry, warmed by the barest brush of their arms, by Harry’s fingers on his wrist, by the adoring look in Harry’s eyes.
Draco had slept poorly the night before, and after a long morning spent experimenting with a new tea flavor, his eyelids had begun to droop and he fancied some fresh air. He had told himself it would be alright, that he’d just nip out for a walk, pick up some fish and chips – but he’d been lying to himself. Malfoys were not deserving of such simple pleasures, and nothing good came from fighting that. Draco had forgotten himself, and now, worse than the punch
“I thought about researching it,” Harry admitted, “after the first time I was here. But I kind of like not knowing.”
When the butterfly finally flew away, Draco watched it until it was out of sight. He sighed dreamily, then scooped up an empty crisp packet and handed it to Harry.
Harry tilted his head forward, brushing his mouth against Draco’s. The touch was different this time, soft and sweet, barely there. But it sent a shockwave all the way to Draco’s toes. He whimpered, and Harry cupped his cheek, fluttering tiny kisses along his jaw.
Harry nodded. “Thanks. I – I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t –” he swallowed painfully, throat raw from crying. “I’m not embarrassed. Not about that. I know you – I mean, I –”
the people you love,” Draco said, trying and failing to be gentle. He cringed slightly, but couldn’t stem the flow of emotion pouring from him. “How can you tell me, an actual fucking Death Eater – I’m Marked, Harry, I was
But in the end, Harry had chickened out, standing frozen as he watched Malfoy escorted from the courtroom. The next day, Harry had owled Malfoy’s wand to him, and was rather surprised to receive a polite thank you note in return.
Desperately, Harry bit down on Draco’s shoulder, trying to stave off his impending collapse, wanting to give Draco every possible second of pleasure. Draco hissed, rocking his hips faster against Harry’s. Harry watched as unadulterated need bloomed in Draco’s eyes, a deep grey pool rippling with longing and lust and heat.
Across the room, Harry could see several confused stares from the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. And Parkinson was glaring at him, looking murderous. Zabini, on the other hand, appeared to be delighted. He was beaming and elbowing Parkinson wildly.
Draco thought. The tea he would pair with this particular mug. He could almost taste the crisp tartness and heady pine tones, richer somehow, when sipped from a cup of such artistry and blue depths.
Draco’s eyelids fluttered, but he did not look away from Harry. “In that case, I’d advise you not to murder me,” he said seriously. “Far too risky.”
“Yes, well, I prefer to have my morning wank in the shower,” Draco said musingly, “but to each his own. I’m certainly not going to judge you for a little thing like that.” He prodded Harry with his foot again. “I have plenty of other things to judge you for, after all.”
“Oh,” Harry said quietly. He looked down at his hands, suddenly feeling lost. “Yeah, it might have. Draco might have run, if we found out even a few weeks ago. It’s like I told you yesterday. He’s not sure of me yet.”
Draco had never spoken about his feelings for Potter, not at Hogwarts and not even during all those long nights he and Blaise had sat up together, after the war. They hadn’t known then, if Draco would be sentenced to Azkaban alongside his father, and Blaise was the only reason Draco had stayed sane while awaiting the verdict.
They were quiet for a time. Malfoy had hauled several of the textbooks onto the bed and was flipping through one, muttering under his breath.
Draco opened his eyes in time to see her throw her hands up in exasperation. He straightened and adjusted his tie. “He’s not mine, Maeve.”
“No, I think Potter is right,” he said, lips pursed as he gazed into the far corner of the kitchen. A moment later, he nodded and refocused on Hermione. “Emotional hurt is very different from a cut finger or falling off a ladder. It does not seem likely that a singular spell – or bond, or curse, for that matter – could respond to both superficial injuries
A jolt reverberated through Harry’s arm, startling him and leaving his fingers strangely numb. He bit back a curse, worried Malfoy would intervene if he thought Harry was hurt.
The other scars were faint, but there were at least a dozen of them. Stark silver lines spiderwebbing erratically across his sternum and ribs.
Harry began to wonder if Draco really did want to be left alone with his book. Surely Harry couldn’t be
Draco leaned into Harry, humming softly. “What is this place?” he asked again, but this time, his every word dripped with wonder.
“Oh –” Draco squirmed a little and his blush deepened. He threw up an arm to cover his eyes. “H-Harry,” he stammered, barely audible.
“So?” Maeve challenged. “You don’t have to use it for everything. You know some things are better done by hand.”
sound, Draco fumbled the forkful of glazed carrots Molly had foisted on him in the time it had taken Harry to cross the kitchen. Harry was expecting a scowl or a grumbled retort, but when Draco shifted on the stool to meet Harry’s eyes, he was glowing.
Harry chuckled as he pulled on Draco’s other jumper. Thankfully, the fire had dried it more thoroughly than the jeans. “I thought you really
“An apology is just words,” Hermione answered. “What he is doing instead is showing me respect. I think he’s trying to
A coy look flashed across Draco’s face and he slipped two fingers into Harry’s mouth. Harry moaned around them, sucking desperately as Draco teased his fingers in and out, in and out.
“Was that the first time you made it?” Harry asked, popping a few grapes into his mouth in an attempt to seem casual.
not a hero, or a sacrifice, not a defective piece of machinery that had been chewed up and spit out by the war. In Draco’s eyes, Harry was whole.
“I know it’s hard for you,” Draco said, “but we can work on it together. I promise, Harry. We’ll figure it out.” He stroked a thumb over Harry’s cheek. “I always want to help you.”
The words were harsh, almost accusatory, but there was calculation there as well, like she was trying to pin Harry down and figure him out.
“Oh.” Harry shuffled his feet on the stone tiles, one hand scrabbling behind him to find the doorknob. “Do you want me to leave?”
He reached across the divide and helped Draco hold the burden of his past, not because Draco could not shoulder it himself, not because Draco needed to be saved, but because Harry understood and accepted Draco’s pain. Harry looked at Draco then with nothing but respect, respect and a raw, unshakeable belief in the man Draco had become.
By early afternoon, the quiet bustle of the common room had become unbearable. Even the sight of a fully healed Padma Patil, blushing slightly as she held Luna’s hand, was only able to lift Harry’s spirits for a few minutes. He welcomed Padma back warmly and beamed happily for Luna when she kissed Padma’s cheek, but his thoughts kept tangling with images of Dementors and eventually, he had fled to the lake.
Draco gulped, the shadows from the fire playing over his face. “How novel for you,” he retorted breathily. Harry could tell he’d been aiming for a superior sounding drawl, but the shake in his voice belied the attempt.
He let himself drip onto the bath mat for a moment, not wanting to track the damp onto the floor of his bedroom. But before he could take a single step, he heard a loud crack.
“Do you want to talk about it?” he’d asked softly, about an hour before they were due to meet McGonagall by the Forest.
Draco cocked his head, eyes darting erratically around the garden as he considered that. “So your kickboxing – stance? The way you move your body, I mean – it made your spells more effective?”
Harry shook his head. “No, but that makes sense. The hooks twist spells Dark, yeah? But the spells I cast were already Dark.”
Harry had long ago come to terms with the fact that he wanted to understand Malfoy; he was still struggling with the idea that he might want something more than that from this strange, new Malfoy.
Malfoy pursed his lips, and Harry could tell that he was considering pushing the auror conversation. Harry’s hands twisted anxiously in the blankets. He felt Malfoy’s stare, but then the other man simply sighed and leaned back against the lab table. Harry’s stomach unclenched.
Something hardened in Draco’s eyes. “Don’t you go getting sappy on me, Potter,” he growled. “I don’t want you looking at me any differently because of this, do you understand me?”
That seemed to cut through Draco’s shock. “Where?” he asked, eyeing Harry’s tight jeans suspiciously. His gaze lingered a beat too long on Harry’s crotch.
“Draco,” Harry said again. He brought his lips to Draco’s cheek. “Draco, darling.” He peppered the words across Draco’s skin, marking each with a reverent kiss. “Draco, love,
“It’s fine. You didn’t –” Draco floundered, too exhausted to explain, particularly to someone as decent as Potter. “It’s fine,” he repeated, rather than finishing the thought.
in increasingly intimate ways. Harry wanted more of Draco’s secrets, wanted to stare into his eyes and taste him, soul and skin and mind.
“Wait.” Draco’s eyes flashed. “You asked me if casting was enough to create residue.” The bowl he had been holding clattered into the sink, and he braced his hands against the edge of the table. “Potter, please tell me you have not been casting Dark Magic spells.”
Harry sighed and let himself lean against the wall. Malfoy’s curtains fluttered in the breeze from the open window, caressing Harry’s face. He pushed them aside. “I just meant – I don’t know what I meant.” He huffed out a harsh breath, bringing a hand up to massage one of his temples. “I’m supposed to be an auror, and I know part of that is the ‘defeated Voldemort’ thing, but I
“Excellent, Mr. Potter,” said McGonagall. “Will you be able to perform your Aperiomancy while standing behind me? I do not want to cast in your direction.”
Draco crawled back into bed, wrapping his arms around Harry from behind. The crackle of the fire was soothing, and Harry was just drifting off to sleep when he realized there was still one thing bothering him, plaguing the back of his mind like an itch just out of reach.
“Malfoy!” Harry groaned. He flopped back on the pillows dramatically, aiming for “exasperated” but in reality having trouble containing his giggles.
She gave Draco a long, considering look. Draco nodded at her, smiling almost shyly. This apparently satisfied McGonagall, because she shifted her focus to Harry.
Malfoy frowned at him again, but Harry noticed a faint blush was heating his cheeks. Malfoy opened his mouth. Closed it. Then he took one last look at the plants and glanced at Harry before simply walking away. Again.
“I am at the shop every day save Tuesday and Sunday,” Draco finally replied, “if you’d like to stop by.”
The mention of Sirius had unbalanced him, unleashing an avalanche of dark memories to fester in his blood. Azkaban had stolen Sirius from him, had broken his godfather with the weight of years he should have spent with Harry. And now Draco was going there, all alone, to face his monster of a father in a place that drove men mad.
But neither of them had pulled away. Instead, they had settled into a comfortable routine of nightly walks and conversations, and as Harry had tossed and turned in his bed last night, he’d realized he missed it. Missed
“Look Malfoy, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have run off like that. I was in my room during dinner, trying to do it again.”
McGonagall pressed a hand to her chest as her face went pale. “You cannot possibly be suggesting that these wands are – horcruxes?”
Cautiously, carefully, Harry expanded his magic outward, probing into the space between him and Malfoy. He felt sweat prickling at the back of his neck and his chest began to ache, as if he wasn’t drawing in enough air. He paused, then strained outward again, searching.
“Had an owl from George,” said Ron. “Want to try out his latest?” He held out a clear packet full of shiny hard candies. They were faceted like jewels.
Harry closed the door behind him and they stood awkwardly for a few seconds, not quite meeting each other’s eyes.
“Could you tell what type of magic it was?” Malfoy asked. “Or if it was a certain spell placed on the flowers?”
“The only thing I require,” Draco hissed, “is your absence.” The words lay shattered on the ground between them, cold and deadly as ice.
It should have come as a shock, the things he had just learned. Except Harry wasn’t actually surprised.
When he was sure he had Draco’s attention, Harry said, “When I passed out in the clearing, you saved me. The residue was literally ripping my magic to shreds, but then you were there, and there were no hooks around you, so I was able to get away. Draco, you’re
The lie lingered on his lips, dry and stale-tasting. Frustrated with himself, Draco wondered again if he would always be like this. Opening the door to Potter only to slam it closed a minute later. Why this meal then? Why the clothes? Why show Harry the book at all?
Standing there, back straight, forearm muscles working as he steadily ground herbs into his mixture of powders, Malfoy looked so – settled. This was a man who knew what he wanted, a man who worked toward it with quiet certainty.
ok? You’re clever and inventive and I want to know every bizarre idea that bounces around your brain. And you care, so much. When you’re invested in something, you give it
Harry felt more than heard Malfoy step closer to him. A sudden intensity sparked between them, warmth rushing up Harry’s spine. He didn’t need to open his eyes to know that Malfoy had lit up like a bonfire, expression wondering and exposed. Nothing fueled Malfoy’s strange beauty like the pursuit of a new question.
Potter’s face was drawn, his normally bright eyes hooded by deep shadows. Though his hair wasn’t quite as unruly as usual, that was only because it was plastered to his head with sweat. Draco had the sudden urge to feed Potter a hot meal and draw him a bath, but he shook off the unwelcome impulse. He had no business worrying over Harry Potter.
and fractured, splitting into dozens of skinny lines that tangled with the lilac ones above their heads.
had been confused), before ever allowing them to use their wands. Even more unfortunately, he was constantly tripping over himself to praise Harry.
Harry grinned, feeling even more encouraged, and made his way to the foot of the bed. He sat down and peered over Malfoy’s shoulder.
Draco sighed into Harry’s silence, his breath fluttering the locks of hair that spilled over Harry’s forehead. Harry looked up at Draco, wanting to tell him that he loved him for him, not because of the actions he’d undertaken to purge his father’s sins from the world.
Struggling to regain his composure, Draco sat up a little straighter and took a deep breath. He looked down his nose at Harry and arranged his features into a smirk of his own.
“No,” Harry said, pulling away in surprise. “I just wanted tonight to be nice for you, before I told you about the testimonials.” Guilt flashed across his face, but then he gathered Draco back into his arms. “I wanted this for so long, Draco, but you seemed so nervous, and I was trying to be patient. Should I –” he bit his lip – “should I have waited longer?”
They moved into the opening dueling stance, opposite each other at the center of the room. After a deep breath, Harry nodded, and Lavender flicked her wand at the ceiling. The door locked and the lights dimmed, right before large boulders and trees materialized around them. The waters of a wide brook separated them, its swirling eddies almost hypnotic as they danced at Harry’s feet. He wrenched his eyes away just in time to block Lavender’s first hex. The impact drove him to one knee, and he used the momentum to roll behind the nearest boulder.
Draco allowed himself a beleaguered growl as he lathered his arms and chest. Harry Potter popping up any time Draco was injured or bleeding or wearing his damn pajamas! Like the universe was seeking out his most vulnerable moments and taunting him with everything he could never have.
Blaise knew, of that Draco had no doubt. And Blaise had never teased him, not about that. No, Blaise had been the one to divert attention away from Draco, to shoot the arrow back at the aggressor without ever seeming to intend offense. It was a detached humor that Blaise practiced, one that had always protected Draco without calling attention to the fact.
That was certainly an understatement. Mr. Zobinski had the most boring palate of anyone Draco had ever known. In fact, Draco often wondered if the man did it on purpose, choosing bland food and drink to further accentuate his outrageously bold fashion choices.
Harry grinned, and Draco got up to fetch the roasting pan from the oven. Once it was safely resting on top of the stove, Draco saw that Harry was now frowning down at the table. He must have felt Draco’s eyes on him, because he looked up and met Draco’s gaze.
Malfoy interrupted constantly, mind racing ahead of Harry’s, meeting his every statement with exclamations and explanations and dizzying torrents of theory.
Harry’s insides squirmed with guilt. He never should have let Draco go alone. Azkaban was death personified, an isle of nothing but despair, and Draco deserved better than to be dragged through the muck of trauma and memory.
“Draco, you said –” Harry’s eyes flicked to the scars on Draco’s arms, visible for once, dressed as he was in one of Harry’s old t-shirts. Draco shifted uncomfortably and Harry forced himself to look away. Swallowing hard, he finished the thought - “you said you hated the flowers for saving you.”
Draco’s discontent immediately fell away. “No, I suppose it isn’t,” he said quietly. Heat pooled in his cheeks, making him wish he had accepted that second glass of lemonade.
Draco snatched his pitiful little cup of coffee off the table and emptied it in one furious gulp. Slamming it back down, Draco rose to his feet and stormed out into the damp.
“You know it’s more than that for you, Draco,” Maeve tutted, something akin to pity dampening the gleam that had sparked in her eyes.
“Oh,” Harry said, a bit embarrassed he hadn’t thought of that himself. Sweeping his wand in a wide arc, he created a soft barrier around them, ensuring that the children could not wander or fly away.
“I like that idea a lot, actually,” Harry said, wanting to reassure him. “Sometimes I think about how I might like to keep studying Defense. But I really, really don’t want to be an Auror, and I didn’t want to feel pressured into that.”
And then Lavender’s excited babbling faded into the background, because Harry was snogging Draco senseless.
“Fine,” Draco said, grabbing the present and crossly tearing off the paper. Inside was a golden key. A tiny cauldron was etched onto the handle. Draco ran his fingertip over it before looking back at Maeve questioningly.
He wanted to walk with him to class and fly with him on weekends and pull him into alcoves to capture his lips and tug at his hair. He wanted to wake up next to him and whisper about their dreams. He wanted to hold him after nightmares. He wanted to be there when Malfoy had a new idea, when he smiled softly at some unexpected pleasure, when he was frustrated or scared or hurt. He wanted to follow him around the castle, not to find out what he was up to, but because he
Draco would always regret his actions during the war, but he was a different person now, a better person, and he was doing the best he could.
The question shocked Harry into silence. Is that really what Malfoy thought? That Harry would only talk to him because he suspected something evil? The idea made him feel surprisingly sad.
Harry struggled into the bathroom and plunged his head into a sink of cold water. When he resurfaced, he grabbed a clean towel from the cabinet and scrubbed it hastily over his hair. Then, he hurried back to Draco.
“Draco –” Harry whined breathlessly, but Draco was already gone, tidying up the mess at his lab table.
Draco did not spend much time in Maeve’s home, but he knew it well enough to note that many items were missing. There were blank spots on the walls where tapestries had once been and her collection of tiny glass elephants was no longer scattered over every available surface, all likely packed away in the large purple traveling trunk that Draco pretended not to notice sitting in the corner.
“I’m sorry I’m late,” Draco said, holding out the jug to Harry. “Closing took a bit longer than usual, but I brought you a new tea to try.”
Draco accepted the bag silently, before standing to stroll along the edge of the garden. Every so often, he’d pause and delicately collect a few buds or leaves. Harry did not follow, sensing that Draco needed a moment to gather himself. And when Draco returned to the blanket a short time later, new cloth pouch bulging with flowers, he was much more composed.
He forced himself to breathe slowly, calming the angry rush of his blood. Closing his eyes, he let go of the dream, loosening the fingers that had been clutching to its fading scraps. And then, as he peeled off his pants, he conjured a new image. Draco at the kitchen counter last night, shoulder muscles straining against deep blue fabric as he’d vigorously whisked the soup, fitted trousers emphasizing the curves of a sinfully gorgeous arse.
Ron grinned cheekily. “There’s a reason we never let you play chaser, mate.” He laughed and scored another direct hit.
Turning his attention back to Harry, Draco slipped his fingers into those messy black locks, disturbingly unbothered by all the sweat.
“What?” Harry yelled again, jostling Draco in his arms. He seemed to be trying to hug Draco and jump up and down simultaneously, all without getting out of the hammock. “Draco, that’s amazing!”
Draco craned his neck to look at Harry, whose brow was furrowed with the beginnings of worry. Unease settled over them, like a scratchy blanket rubbing against bared skin.
Her reassurance warmed him, stifling the last remnants of his self-consciousness, confirming that he had not let her down.
This room was much more subdued than the main shop, but it had the same inviting air. It was painted a pale blue with grey trim, and twinkling white fairy lights were strung along the eaves. The floor was the same rough concrete as the storeroom, but it was covered with a warm burgundy rug. A small desk and bookshelf were situated by a window, the desk strewn with open books, quills, and piles of parchment. The long counter that contained the sink wrapped around two entire walls of the room, with cabinets and drawers arranged below. The paraphernalia atop it looked like barely controlled chaos – knives and ladles, pouches of various sizes, little metal tins, herbs and flower petals.
“So I’ve heard,” Harry grumbled, but he obediently shuffled over to the scrubbed wooden table and collapsed into a chair.
Harry touched Draco’s wrists, his spine, his cheeks, and then he buried his head in Draco’s shoulder and let out one broken sob.
After, they had lain in the grass, holding hands as the sun warmed their wind-whipped skin. Draco had told Harry about Hermione’s visit to Novelle’s the day before, about how much he liked her, about odd life-debt statistics and three new blends of tea. He spoke about how he wasn’t as afraid anymore, of Maeve leaving, even though he knew how much he would miss her. Harry had kissed Draco’s cheek, then talked to him about kickboxing, about the defensive spells he was finding ways to make stronger, and about how he had spent the morning doing nothing, relaxing into the empty hours with no hint of panic, something he had not been able to do since the war.
“I missed you too,” Draco whispered. He set his mug on the ground and folded his legs beneath him on the sofa, turning to face Harry fully. “But I’m the one who should apologize. It was my fault. What I said was unfair, and I –”
Heavy footsteps echoed against the cement floor of the storage room, cutting into Draco’s thoughts. A tall man in impeccable navy-blue dress robes rounded the corner and entered Draco’s workshop. Eyes fixed on the man’s aggressively shiny buttons, Draco tried to swallow past the raw
“I don’t care!” Draco screamed. He stalked closer, and Harry might have thought Draco was going to hit him, if it weren’t for the tears welling in his eyes. He did not lower his voice, and it rang through the room, fierce as a lighting flash, broken as thunder. “Having survived worse is not a blanket excuse for reckless behavior! You’re not
“Yes. You bought me lunch on Friday, and I wished to reciprocate.” Draco’s fingers slipped on the knife when he realized his error. “Now that I have this unexpected opportunity to do so, that is,” he added breezily, sweeping the celery into the pot with a practiced nonchalance.
“Those monies are invested in such a way that the organization will be self-supporting for decades, if not longer. Mr. Zabini handled all of the financial arrangements, which I believe is how he was promoted so quickly to the top of his firm. I understand it is not typical for nineteen-year-old interns to waltz into their superior’s office with a proposal for a multibillion-Galleon charity project.”
The cover displayed two scantily clad wizards standing in front of a pyramid. They were staring deeply into each other’s eyes, one shooting a spell over the other’s shoulder. His wand was aimed at a disturbing purple cloud that had fangs protruding from far too many mouths.
Draco moaned appreciatively. “I always want to bake after reading that chapter.” He closed his eyes and snuggled deeper into the pillow, moving his head just enough to butt it up against Harry’s hand.
“Does it hurt?” Harry asked, wondering if he should disobey Maeve and offer Draco a pain-numbing charm.
“I wasn’t avoiding you,” Harry started, but Malfoy huffed out a disbelieving breath. A few strands of hair – the ones that always seemed to escape his bun – fluttered, then fell back into his eyes. Harry shifted in the grass, subtly adjusting his trousers. Messy-haired Malfoy never failed to get under Harry’s skin, and it was getting worse, not better, the more time they spent together.
Draco’s fingers twitched, finding their way to that silver ring of his. He twirled it once, then stilled and lifted his eyes back to Harry’s. “Yes, alright.”
The hooks writhed and shrieked and twisted, sending one last shock wave of dizzy pain roiling through Harry.
The kiss was soft at first, a slow exploration, tongues sliding against each other in a subtle give and take. They stayed that way for a long time, pausing only to rub their noses together or pepper light kisses along the other’s cheek, always spiraling back together, succumbing again and again to each other’s heat.
Harry’s heart thumped, a dizzying wave of relief rushing through his veins. The sweatpants were an old pair of Harry’s, left behind one morning when he’d been running late for dueling. They were too large on Draco, rolled over at the waistband and exposing sharp hipbones. A thin white t-shirt clung to the planes of Draco’s stomach, rumpled and creased, likely from a night as restless as Harry’s. Strangely though, Draco’s hair was as neat as the rest of him was disheveled, the long half pulled back from his face in an intricate braid. The contrast was striking, almost unbearably so, and Harry felt a brief flash of arousal.
“Of course, Professor. I wouldn’t!” Harry insisted vehemently. But then he shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “I mean, well – I did think about it. But I know it would be bad for him, so I won’t. That’s why, well –” He gestured to the Ministry letter beneath McGonagall’s elbow.
Harry chuckled as he buttoned his trousers. “Then go take one, darling. I’ll bring you some breakfast.”
Harry cut himself off with a little laugh and said, “This is nice.” Stretching his arms above his head, he twisted from side to side until his spine popped. When his arms dropped, he turned to smile at Draco. “I’ve felt a lot better the last couple days, but I missed you. I’m glad you came over.”
Draco opened his eyes and shrugged, the pain seeming to flow from him as easily as his anger had. “Better than Azkaban. And there’s a poetic sort of justice to it, I suppose.” He unfolded from himself, stretching out to lean back on his hands. “Seven years studying to be a wizard, seven years learning how not to be one.” The words were more wistful than bitter.
“I’m sorry,” he murmured, even though Draco had told him not to. “I’m sorry I used a spell I didn’t understand. I’m sorry I hurt you.”
Draco kept his back turned until Harry finished the spell. For the first time, Harry realized that he rarely did any magic when he was with Draco, unconsciously mirroring Draco’s limitations. He wondered if Draco had noticed, and if it bothered him if he had.
“Yes, well,” Draco huffed, brushing flour off his hands and straightening his spine. “A black eye will do that. It has nothing to do with – with him.” His voice cracked on the last word, belying his aloof tone.
“Hmm,” Harry breathed, mouthing along the underside of Draco’s jaw. “So why didn’t I murder you weeks ago?”
Harry glanced sheepishly at Padma, who he’d paired with first today. They’d been “working” together for the last fifteen minutes and he was just realizing that he hadn’t cast a single spell. They were meant to be casting simple non-verbal spells, so their partner could practice recognizing the patterns of residue left by various kinds of magic.
Draco Malfoy had built a life for himself, and he was afraid his former nemesis was here to spit on it. Harry didn’t know how to convince Malfoy –
He opened his eyes and looked at Harry. “I can make the potion, Potter,” he whispered. “I know how to fix it. I know what to do.”
Draco swirled his tongue over the tip of Harry’s cock, then took him deeper, bobbing his head forward and back in a steady rhythm. Harry let out a long, garbled cry and came undone.
Harry patted her hand before gently pushing it away. He leaned forward to argue, but Draco beat him to it.
. Even as the taunt left his mouth, part of Harry regretted it, a tiny tendril of shame coiled in his gut.
“No,” Harry said forcefully, sitting up and locking his eyes on Draco’s. “I would never do something that I knew could hurt you.”
Harry was so in love, so entirely overwhelmed by the whirlwind of discovery and memory, by the grief and pain and joy that this night had somehow held.
“Alright, fine. I have never heard anyone speak such utter nonsense… about a valuable aspect of magical theory,” Malfoy corrected himself, still looking rather put out about Driffield’s inability to teach them.
Moving quietly, so as not to spook him, Harry approached the foot of the bed. He climbed up and sprawled casually atop the Gryffindor blanket, making sure he wasn’t directly facing Draco. Harry didn’t want his body language to suggest any kind of pressure or expectation.
“You had quite enough to be getting on with last summer, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, banishing the mess with an efficient flick of her wand. She poured Harry a fresh cup and set it in front of him. “I will not hear one word of guilt or apology from you. Now stop fidgeting with that piece of parchment and tell me what is troubling you.”
“Thank you for cleaning them up,” Harry said with a pained smile. “I don’t think I could have looked at them again today without losing it.”
“I’ll remember that,” Harry promised. He moved to lean against the wall next to Draco. “So you’ll stay?”
After the Halloween feast, Harry had fled to the Astronomy tower, Draco close behind. They sat together, surrounded by stars, and Harry had asked Draco to tell him about his childhood, about his mother.
“These look like formulas,” Harry said. Draco looked over his shoulder and saw him intently scanning the book. “Are you breaking down different potions? To see how their parts interact?”
“Harry saved my life in the Room of Requirement,” Draco said, “but I didn’t save his there. In fact, it could be argued that I did not save his life at all.”
Harry sought out the connection between his body and the wand, and after several long heartbeats of nothingness, suddenly there it was, all at once. A muted, crackling energy zigzagging from his core to his heart to his arm and out through his wand. He felt the spell buzzing through him and holding steady at his wand’s tip.
When he pulled back, it was like a veil had lifted, exposing Draco for the very first time. He was just looking at Harry, nothing more, but there was a steadiness there that made the air seem to shimmer. Harry gazed back at him and Draco unfurled, a wildflower that had been tightly budded finally opening its petals to the sun.
Harry brought the cutting board over and used the edge of his knife to knock the mound of squash into the pot. With an uncharacteristically bashful look at Draco, he smiled before retreating back to the table. He studied Draco for a minute, an unreadable expression on his face.
That sentence was better than a jolt of caffeine. That’s why Harry had asked Malfoy to take a walk in the first place! But he had gotten lost in their strange conversation and forgotten.
“What are you looking for?” Harry asked when he caught up, only just stopping himself from reaching out to nudge Malfoy’s shoulder.
Draco looked him up and down, then seized upon a rare burst of courage. “Walk me home, Potter? You look dreadful, and I have just the thing.”
Its petals were tightly closed, but it shone with an iridescent gleam, as sharp and clear as if it were carved from glass.
“I wasn’t snooping, I swear!” Harry blurted. “He was in the other room to get dessert ready, and I was just looking at some books when the letter fell out of one.” Harry swallowed hard. Despite his good intentions, telling McGonagall this felt like betraying Draco. “It was from the Ministry.”
Draco gravitated toward shades of blue, eyes crinkling with pleasure as he discovered plump sky-colored petals, and pale ice-blue flowers shaped like bells, and tight clusters of shockingly dark buds, an electric blue that was almost black. His hand would drift toward his pocket, one finger tapping against the notebook concealed there. Harry could practically see the inspiration strike, a thousand tiny lightning bolts that Draco longed to record, if only there wasn’t so much more to see.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but didn’t otherwise press him. He scrubbed at a ladle that looked unpleasantly sticky and simply waited for Harry to be ready to continue.
“Hermione,” Draco said, brow furrowing, “do you think Muggles have life-debts? Is it easier to live with, if you don’t know it’s there?” Draco had never minded the knowledge that he was indebted to Harry, but he could see how something like that could be a burden to most people.
As they ate, conversation flowed easily between them, though there was an unusual tightness to Harry’s eyes that worried Draco. He did his best not to dwell on it, because Harry seemed happy enough. Perhaps he was just tired.
“Yeah, alright,” Harry said agreeably. He caught Draco by the chin and brushed their lips together. “I feel it, ok? Intuitively. I know this is real. But that’s not how your brain works. So I thought it through, the way you would, to help me explain to you what I already understood.”
No, all Draco could do was sit stiffly on the edge of it all, wanting desperately to belong to this chaotic little family and acutely aware that if things went wrong today, he never would.
The downside to the week-long eighth year workshops was that they were taught by visiting professors. Which was great – in theory.
He didn’t relish a chat with her at the moment though, not with a sore face and lingering thoughts of Potter. He had almost made it to the door of the back room, already grateful that he’d dodged the encounter, when Maeve called after him.
“He worked with her all last summer restoring the greenhouses while Hogwarts was being repaired,” McGonagall said. “She wished to show him how well the plants are flourishing.”
Draco’s forehead wrinkled in confusion – or maybe concern, Harry couldn’t tell which – and he glanced up and down the empty corridor.
Draco pinned Harry with a long, serious look. “You don’t owe this world a single thing, Harry Potter,” he said slowly, lending weight to every word. “Whatever you choose to do will be more than enough.”
Draco had scoffed when she said it, but perhaps one tiny part of him had believed in it, after all, one tiny sliver of his soul that thought maybe, just maybe, he and Harry were meant to be.
Harry let her bustle him behind the counter and settle him atop a tall stool. Before he could blink, there was steaming cup of tea and a plate of miniature tarts in front of him.
There was a beat of silence, and Hermione awkwardly withdrew her hand. Harry was about to intervene when Draco sat up.
Harry shivered as a gust of wind whipped by, snaking beneath his collar like the unwelcome clasp of cold, skeletal fingers. He pulled his scarf more tightly around him. Ron tugged up the hood of his cloak and dug a pair of gloves out of his pocket.
The apparition had been what brought him and Harry together, and for months, Draco had assumed that when the apparition ended, so too would his relationship with Harry.
Bad enough that Potter had stood in Draco’s workshop, had breathed life and laughter into it without one second of disdain.
“No,” Draco said, still whisking. “I am brewing you a potion that will replenish your energy and lift your mood.”
“We don’t have to, of course. It’s entirely up to you.” He clamped his mouth shut and his knuckles whitened. After a pause, he added, “I just wanted you to know, that you can talk about it, if you want to. I’m, well – I’m here.”
George, Ron, and Hermione immediately sank into chairs by the sofa. No one spoke, waiting expectantly as Maeve circled Harry and Draco. She muttered to herself for several minutes, occasionally reaching out to trail a finger in the air above one of the lights.
Draco shook his head, but he was smiling. A garish accessory like that should have looked ridiculous on a woman as old as Maeve, but she somehow managed to turn it into a dignified (if eccentric) fashion statement.
“Don’t,” Harry whispered. “It’s ok. I love you. Everything’s ok.” He lifted his head, nuzzling Draco’s cheek before slotting their lips together.
“Different spells have different wand motions because magic needs to be channeled in different ways,” Draco explained. He sounded like a Professor, and Harry found it disturbingly sexy. He struggled to refocus as Draco continued. “The wand motion creates the proper pathway for us to control and direct each spell.” Draco trailed a hand across his sternum and down his wand arm, pivoting his arm at the elbow as if demonstrating various pathways.
Harry knew he was pushing his luck, but he couldn’t stop himself from asking the obvious question. “What was it trying to tell you?”
Draco slumped forward, as if George’s original spell had been the only thing holding him up. He felt weightless, and oddly off balance, like his body had been off-kilter for so long that the restored equilibrium felt foreign and wrong.
“No, Blaise,” Draco said, cutting him off. “You knew how I felt about him.” Draco’s voice broke, as if finally acknowledging out loud what Blaise had always known had shattered something inside him. “How I have
Classes would continue on a modified (and reduced) schedule for all years, focusing on history and theory for the time being. The eighth years had already been scheduled for an Arithmancy/Divination workshop (and wasn’t that an odd blend? Hermione was furious.) beginning Monday, which conveniently did not require spells.
McGonagall smiled at him. “I had my doubts at first, but I believe this is a good thing you are doing, Mr. Potter. Thank you for allowing me to help.”
Draco tugged at his hair, relishing the tight pull of his scalp. He imagined himself reordered, settling back into a shape that made sense.
As the pages turned, Draco’s limbs slowly relaxed. His eyelids fluttered more and more frequently, and by the time Harry had reached the end of the first chapter, Draco was fast asleep.
“No,” Harry said fiercely. “No, Draco, I didn’t, I promise. I would never take that choice away from you.” He tried to give Draco’s arm a reassuring squeeze, but Draco jerked away.
McGonagall’s voice caught, and she paused to collect herself. And that’s precisely when Draco Malfoy slipped in through the side door.
Malfoy’s voice was a thin rasp, and he looked so fragile, like even a gentle wisp of wind could tear him to pieces. Harry longed to take him into his arms, to stroke his hair and kiss away the hint of tears, to whisper over and over that it was all ok now, that he was safe.
“It’s not,” Harry confirmed. “I had to call the shop, and then Maeve said she’d transfer me to you. I didn’t know you
Draco’s eyes were distant. Harry had released him as soon as they exited the bathroom, and Draco was running his fingertips along his chest again. But then he shook his head and looked up sharply at Harry.
With a sharp inhale, Draco squeezed his eyes shut. He let out a measured breath, and when his eyes opened again, there was only a tiny sliver of grey surrounding his dilated pupils. He licked his lips as he ran a finger along Harry’s collar bone.
Draco blinked at her stupidly, her face seeming to swim before his eyes. Before he could answer, Harry had him by the elbows, pulling him forward until their bodies were pressed together.
George frowned at her. “I needed to do it like this,” he defended himself. “Because the potion connects them.” He paused, studying the space between Harry and Draco. “And it worked. This –” he pointed at the orange knots – “is the residue of the potion.”
Harry had had something good with Ginny – companionship and comfort and admittedly brilliant sex. But in the end, it had not been enough. Not enough for her, certainly, as she had tried to explain, oh so gently, on the day she left. But Harry knew now that it was not enough for him either.
“Draco, Draco, Draco,” Blaise chided teasingly. “What have you not been telling me? Perhaps you’ve had some
Draco dropped the ice, then scrambled to pick it up before Maeve could scold him again. “How – how many spells have you invented?” he asked in awe.
Draco’s hands scrabbled at his elbows. He was folding into himself, voice tight with shock. “You lied to
Draco handled the mug gently, cradling it between his palms like a precious magical artifact. When Harry caught his eye, Draco turned a brilliant shade of pink, color flaring along his cheekbones.
– their magics melding together into something new, something more powerful than either of them could ever be alone.
He almost ended the conversation right then, but Malfoy’s steady grey eyes calmed him, and he felt able to continue. “It’s also because it could be - er, a weapon, of sorts. To help us fight.” Harry breathed in carefully through his nose to steady himself. “If I’m going to be an auror, I want to do
In the center of their little woodland was a roaring bonfire (complete with a permanent shield charm, to avoid any drunken mishaps). Chairs and sofas made of woven branches were scattered throughout the room, somehow as plush and comfortable as anything Gryffindor tower had to offer. Overhead, the tree branches were strung with tiny lanterns that seemed to always provide the perfect amount of light. Indeed, as Harry closed his eyes, the lantern above him dimmed slightly, and he almost smiled.
That was probably more of the war trauma, he supposed, like Hermione was always going on about. But Harry didn’t see the point in dwelling on darkness. Voldemort had taken up quite enough of his life, thank you very much, and Harry was more than ready to just get on with things.
“To force you together,” Blaise said. The flash of stubborn self-confidence that had reassured Draco just a moment ago had already faded away. Blaise’s normally rich skin had taken on a grey cast, making him look queasy. “Ginny said –”
“Not when he’s talking about the books, no. We also discuss class sometimes. We’ve both been working ahead on the Arithmancy unit that’s meant to be the workshop focus in a few weeks. That’s always been my favorite subject. It’s – nice, having someone to talk to about it.”
Draco carded a hand through Harry’s wild mop of hair, easing him back against the pillows. He brought the cloth to Harry’s groin, washing him with gentle strokes.
Harry dropped his head to Draco’s shoulder, trying to catch his breath. Taking advantage of the momentary lull, Draco ran a finger over Harry’s stomach, tracing the edge of the sheet that still covered his lap.
Draco looked down at his hands. “I may have overreacted. I should have let you explain.” He hesitated, then admitted, “You scared me.”
Harry laughed and kissed his temple. Draco ducked his head to start cleaning up the cannisters of tea, but not before Harry caught his blush.
“Why would I be angry?” Draco asked quietly, after making his way back into the main room. He stooped to help Maeve with the pastries. “Madelyn needs you.”
Harry nodded absently, but his gaze was locked on Draco. Draco’s stomach flipped, heat clawing at his chest. He approached cautiously, knees suddenly weak with desire.
“Give me a few more days,” Hemione said, giving Draco’s hand a reassuring pat. “George has been working on it, and I want to compare notes with him.”
“Right,” Harry muttered. Desperate as he was to share this with Malfoy, to satisfy his old rival’s insatiable (
This was the first time that Malfoy seemed entirely at ease around Harry. He looked soft and vulnerable and oh so pretty, and Harry
The idea had come to him only a few days after Maeve had untangled them from the apparition bond. It had felt… strange, not being pulled to Draco almost constantly, and Harry found himself full of jittery energy, unpleasantly similar to how he had been in the days before his relationship with Draco.
Propped on his elbows, Harry kissed Draco tenderly, sliding his slicked cock between Draco’s arsecheeks. Draco hid his face in his elbow and let out a long, desperate moan. A pink flush had spread prettily across his cheekbones and down to his chest. He looked disheveled and sweaty and thoroughly debauched. Harry kissed along his jawline as he pressed the tip of his cock to Draco’s hole.
Surprised by her presence (though he shouldn’t have been; of course she and Blaise planned to confess at the same time), Draco had immediately stammered out an apology for not knocking. It was the first time he had ever done so, letting himself in as if he belonged here, as if he had a right to Harry’s home.
As far as Draco knew, Harry had suggested this visit to Hogwarts so they could explore the Room of Requirement. It seemed a logical next step after the information Hermione had given them, and though Harry could not articulate any sort of plan beyond going into the Room and seeing what happened, Draco had been intrigued. Harry owled McGonagall to explain the situation, and she had invited them to Floo into her office on a Sunday morning.
was written out in pink letters, but it looked like someone had run a finger through it, blurring the impressively high number. Next was a smaller picture of Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini sitting out by the Hogwarts lake. Blaise was smiling at the camera, but Pansy was stretched out on her back, eyes closed and expression more content than Harry had ever seen her. Her longs legs were bare and her fingers were tangled in the grass. Something about the pose made Harry uncomfortable, a strange, prickly feeling that he did not want to examine too closely, so he quickly turned his attention to the last frame.
Harry squeezed her back tightly, feeling comforted by her familiar scent of raspberries and vanilla.
“I always want to help you, too,” Harry whispered. He caught Draco’s hand and kissed his fingers. “Tell me why you’re frightened.”
Harry slumped onto one of the stools and tried to explain. “I asked for it during my advisory meeting. I promised it was only to cast things I could practice Sentiomancy on, and that I wouldn’t cast anything on myself or other people.”
It was Wednesday night. Harry had not spoken to Malfoy in five days, and he had finally reached his breaking point. It was past time to fix this, and Harry fully intended to do so – just as soon as the sun went down.
Harry kissed Draco’s throat. “Like this?” he asked, his fingers skimming the waistband of Draco’s pants.
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco whispered, eyes crumpling with pain. He smoothed the hair away from Harry’s forehead and cupped his cheek. “I should have been there for you. I should have noticed that something was wrong.”
He shut the door behind him and leaned against it, closing his eyes and inhaling slowly. He felt oddly stretched, as if the things he told Potter had surged through his veins and forced their way out, leaving him misshapen, an empty sack too large for his bones.
“It just feels – important, I guess,” Harry offered, gesturing vaguely at his chest, struggling to put the gut feeling into words. He spoke slowly, working it out as he went. “To understand it, this invisible force we put into the world, you know?”
“No, no,” Ginny backpedaled, “I just meant, when Ron told me, I didn’t think past the apparition part. I didn’t even wonder if it could affect your feelings.”
Harry wondered if all potions carried discernible echoes of their brewers, or if he was just hopelessly attuned to Draco Malfoy. A daft smile unfurled across his face at the thought.
He felt Draco’s touch against his cheek and opened his eyes again. “But you’re right, Malfoy. I shouldn’t have done it. I should have talked to you about it and let you make your own decision.”
“No Draco, it’s you. Your theory, your formulas, you refusing to quit.” Harry paused to card a hand through Draco’s hair. “A lot of people would have fallen apart after what happened to you,” he said quietly. “But you clawed your way out.”
No, that was absurd, the very idea histrionic. There was no reason to suspect his magic of turning on him. It never had before, and he had outgrown accidental, emotional magic years ago.
They stayed with Luna for almost two more hours, and when Draco had finally stood to go, Harry stopped him, just for a moment.
It did hurt, for a time, a fiery stretch that stole Harry’s breath. But never once did he want to stop. The pain was nothing more than a brittle shell. It cracked open like a fancy chocolate, pleasure oozing out and coating all his nerves in caramel.
When Maeve pulled back, she kept hold of Harry by the elbows. “You take care of my boy while I’m gone, you hear me?” She pinned Harry with her gaze, eyes searching his.
“It’s good to see you,” Ginny said, smiling down at him. She was dressed casually in one of her Quidditch practice jerseys, with her hair swept back in a messy braid.
“Casting,” Draco answered, fingers tracing restless patterns across Harry’s shoulder. “The residue comes from the spell itself. Not its effect. Honestly, Potter.” His eyes crinkled with amusement. “That’s the ‘First Foundational Property of Aperiomancy.’ Did you learn nothing from Auror Driffield?” He clapped a hand to his chest in exaggerated shock.
His hand was still on Harry’s shoulder. For a moment, Harry swayed toward the touch, before he quickly caught himself and straightened up. He ran his fingers through his sweaty hair, still gulping in deep breaths, then shook out his hands, trying to dispel the last remnants of the unpleasant sensation that had overtaken him.
“Just thinking.” Harry laid his head against Draco, not ready to share the idea that was niggling at the back of his mind.
what was wrong with him tonight – the same thing that had been wrong with him every night for two weeks now. Ever since his former rival had grinned at him across a table while devouring Draco’s tea.
Ron nodded and squeezed Harry’s shoulder briefly. “I know, mate.” He leaned back, resting his weight on his gloved hands, and gazed out at the lake thoughtfully. “He apologized, you know. To me and Hermione both. Neville too, I reckon.”
Potter shifted from foot to foot, until sudden understanding lit up his face. For a moment, he was more brilliant than the sun, but then he winced, looking chagrined.
But he stopped himself. He wouldn’t pressure Draco to bare his Mark tonight. Would never pressure Draco to reveal anything before he was ready.
His tone was curious, not angry or demanding, but Draco’s hand jerked all the same. His spoon scraped harshly against the bottom of the bowl. The delighted shout of a child floated up from outside, momentarily overtaking the sounds of evening traffic.
Luna appeared to be directing her side of the game with no regard for strategy or even for the most basic rules of chess. Oddly, her pieces moved without complaint or argument. Harry glowered at the board. He’d been playing with those chess pieces for years now, and they had never once been this obedient to him.
Draco had settled immediately, turning his face up to the sky and gulping in huge breaths of the fresh air. After pondering for a moment, Harry had led him to their cottage, and by the time Harry had gotten every window in the place open, Draco had already started brewing. He’d been hunched over the cauldrons in the kitchen ever since.
With Draco leading this time, they turned sideways to squeeze through the opening and emerged into blackness, not a color to be seen save that same lilac light. Moments later, an arc of midnight blue light streamed across the space, hardly distinguishable against the darkness. It bounced off the edges of something
And then he was suddenly falling. He flailed his arms, letting out a yelp as he crashed into – something. Something firm, yet slightly squishy. Something pleasantly
As Draco moaned and whimpered, holding nothing back, Harry felt an overwhelming need building inside him. The words of love that had passed between them had released something in Draco, had finally allowed him to surrender to the connection he and Harry had been building all along. Even as they touched, Harry ached with desire for Draco, longing to join their bodies as intimately as they had their souls.
He looked more peaceful than Harry had ever seen him, and the image cut into Harry like a knife. Draco seemed to blur before Harry’s eyes, the smile transformed into a shriek of pain. Harry tried to push it away, tried to give in to whatever the fuck the Room was doing and just enjoy the ocean with Draco, but Evan’s words echoed in Harry’s head, and without the distraction of the house of never-ending childhood trauma, he just couldn’t ignore them any longer.
“Ariana is a Ravenclaw,” Draco said, “but she has a healthy amount of Slytherin ambition. She asked Slughorn for more advanced Potions work, wanted to preview the O.W.L curriculum as a first year.” Draco felt a small smile tugging at his lips. “Nobody had time for that kind of thing, of course. Hogwarts was a war zone that year. But Ariana wouldn’t give up. I don’t know how she discovered that I was so skilled at Potions, but she started following me around, pestering me with endless questions. And every time I found a moment to brew something, there she was, ready to observe and take notes.”
Harry kissed him, sucking teasingly on his bottom lip. Draco gasped, and brought his hands up to clutch at Harry’s shoulders.
Draco cleared his throat. He looked beautiful framed against the vibrant chaos of Harry’s overgrown garden, his light blue trousers and grey jumper seeming soft and almost blurred in comparison, as if he were a cozy little warren to crawl into and feel safe. But his eyes were hesitant, flickering away from Harry, and his knuckles were white on the handles of the casserole dish he was holding.
“Research, of course!” Hermione gushed. “Hardly any of it is relevant, now that we know the source of the apparition, but it’s still fascinating.” She brushed a stray curl away from her eyes impatiently. “I’ve been dying to talk to you about it.”
Harry barked out a laugh, then let himself fall into the tub. He reclined next to Draco, legs hanging over the edge and arms behind his head.
“How did you –” he trailed off. There was no point in questioning Luna. Sometimes she just sensed these things.
“Research,” Hermione said firmly, as though Draco had not just swept the ground from beneath Harry’s feet. She had crossed her arms and was looking between the two of them appraisingly, but it wasn’t enough to distract her from the matter at hand. “We need to know what kinds of spells could cause a connection like this.”
Draco was the only one to remain composed. Maeve’s voice always calmed him, and besides, he’d seen her do much more shocking things than disregard privacy spells and walk through wards.
“Not a bloody thing,” Harry chortled. Then his mouth quirked mischievously. “Oh,” he said in an offhand manner, “I did pick up how to perform the most advanced kind of Aperiomancy, though – I mean, apparently.” He shot Draco a wicked grin and shrugged.
Heart pounding, Draco attempted to smooth down his hair with shaking fingers. Too late, he remembered the ink and snatched his hand away, hoping he had not accidentally stained the blond strands. He hastily wiped his palms against the back of the curtains before adopting a casual position perched on the wide sill of the window.
“Well, you know Hermione – she didn’t exactly let him off the hook. Gave him a piece of her mind, of course, but then she held his hand and thanked him and told him she accepted his apology. And then –” Ron continued with a groan, rolling his eyes - “they argued about ‘arithmantic numeral philosophy’ for twenty bloody minutes!”
Muscles burning, Harry feigned concentration and dove toward the center goal post, hoping Malfoy would follow. As Harry pulled out of the dive, his broom dropped abruptly, leaving him several meters below where he had meant to be. He shook his head, annoyed that he had let himself get so out of practice, before sweeping in a long arc to the opposite end of the Pitch, intending to leave Malfoy far behind.
“Was she right?” Harry asked, an expression Draco could not read coloring his eyes. “Did you try to help her?”
Therefore, the magic drawing Draco and Potter together had rules that did not allow them to leave each other until some unknown requirement had been met. And that was the most frightening possibility of all.
Harry’s answering smile was blinding. He immediately stood and offered Draco a hand, helping him up and tugging him toward the door.
“Tracing a spell from a wand to its target is child’s play. You’ll have to do better than that if you want to surprise me, dear,” Maeve said with a tsk of her tongue. “Wandless, or at least nonverbal.”
Before he could grow too melancholy though, Maeve presented him with a small square package, wrapped in shiny sky-blue paper and a silver bow.
Harry let go of his mug, which continued to hover in the air above the hammock, and ran a fingertip over the label. In Draco’s neatest script, it read
Draco gasped, and his hips jerked. He tilted his head back, exposing the pale white of his throat. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed, struggling to form words.
Draco got up to fetch two glasses of water. When he returned to the table, Harry gulped the drink down gratefully and finally looked up from his food.
Mouth suddenly dry, Draco reached out and stroked his fingers down Harry’s spine. It was meant to be a calming gesture, simple reassurance, but sparks seemed to flare from Harry’s skin, the heat rushing up Draco’s arm.
Harry no longer doubted that Draco wanted this. He had felt it in the way Draco had shivered beneath Harry’s touch, in the reverence of Draco’s own caresses, in the way Draco had whispered Harry’s name. And he had seen it in Draco’s eyes, in the way he drank in the sight of Harry, as if Harry’s mere existence breathed life into Draco.
“What?” Draco cried, as Maeve seized his wrist and pulled him from the room. “Maeve, that’s ridiculous. There’s no need to – I mean, really, you don’t have to – that’s not at all how presents work!”
Out of breath and dizzy, Harry stumbled over loose pebbles and tree roots. The aching of his limbs was a constant distraction. It untethered him from the present moment, snatching up his mind and depositing it back at Draco’s doorstep.
In the year he had worked for her, Maeve had made no secret of her disdain for the Ministry’s treatment of Draco, and she took every opportunity to assure him it was wrong. Draco did not know what she was trying to accomplish with the pointed remarks and tiny temptations. She certainly did not want him in trouble with the Aurors, and Draco was sure she would have stopped him, had he ever picked up a wand.
Harry startled, then quickly relaxed, not wanting to distract Draco. He nodded in encouragement and settled in to listen.
Draco frowned. He tilted his head, meeting Harry’s eyes. Harry did his best to hold Draco’s gaze. One of Draco’s eyebrows quirked up suspiciously, but after a long moment of indecision, he finally nodded. “Alright.”
Harry looked a bit stunned. He was rubbing the back of his neck with a troubled expression. Draco wondered if he was remembering the heat in the Room of Requirement that day, the terrifying power of the fiendfyre, Draco’s panicked fingers bruising his hips. Draco shivered, then forcibly looked away from the memory.
Draco hummed reassuringly and let Harry sob into his shoulder. The storm passed quickly, and a few seconds later, Harry lifted his head, scrubbing a wrist over his damp eyes.
Colors of all kinds seeped outward from the dark spot, suffusing the void until Harry was gaping at what looked like a watercolor painting of the ocean.
Harry jolted awake and sat up at once, trying to conceal how badly Malfoy had startled him (and trying to ignore how badly he wanted to pull Malfoy down beside him).
“Are you sure?” Potter’s eyes flickered toward Draco and away again. “You were shaking really badly.”
The words seemed to take on a life of their own, clamoring around Draco, clawing at his face, making him want to mask himself in indifference – a bitter, if necessary, armor. But Draco resisted the impulse, knowing Harry would never shame him for his pain.
He gasped in a breath, the air harsh against his raw throat. He still couldn’t see and the tightness against his legs was unbearable. He tore at it, ripping it away from him before realizing it was only his sheets. He cringed away from the touch of the bedclothes, pulling his knees to his chest and sobbing into his hands.
cast Dark Magic.” Harry’s fingers shook and he released Draco’s hands. Squeezing his eyes shut, he whispered, “I didn’t think I could bear to do it if you were watching.”
Maeve’s face softened, and she nodded at him. “I had a good feeling about you from the very beginning, you know.” Harry blushed as Maeve continued. “And then Draco told me something, and I knew my feeling had been right. He told me that you weren’t afraid of his darkness, and that you trusted him enough to show him your own pain.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “you could say that.” His voice was a hoarse croak. Grimacing, he took a swig from his water bottle.
“– don’t have much time before my next meeting, but I wanted to stop by with a quick update. My research has yielded several promising new leads.”
When Harry had started the renovation, he regarded it as little more than a pet project, something to keep his head and hands busy while Draco spent these last few precious weeks with Maeve at the shop.
As Harry watched, Draco wandered over to a patch of wildflowers and knelt beside them. He inhaled deeply, closing his eyes in reverence as his fingers brushed against the petals.
When they’d met on the seventh floor about twenty minutes ago, Draco looking unusually cheerful after his visit with Sprout and Harry still unsteady from his conversation with Evan Thornguilde, they hadn’t been sure how to proceed. Eventually, they had simply approached the door to the Room and Draco said, in an oddly polite tone, “We require information about what is happening to us. Will you please help us understand what is causing the apparition bond?”
Maeve batted his hand away from her precious dough, but when she spoke, the words were gentle. “You seem pretty rattled.”
Draco nodded at him. Tremors wracked his body as the adrenaline left him, but his pulse began to slow. Harry reached for Draco, pausing before he touched him. When Draco did not balk, Harry ran his thumbs gently across Draco’s cheeks, wiping away his tears.
Mouth a stubborn line, Draco had begun to protest. She had already apologized; there was no need to treat him like a fragile child. But then Maeve chucked him under the chin, her calloused touch so familiar and comforting that Draco had surrendered without deciding to.
“I have an advanced form of the trace on me, that notifies the proper Ministry officials if I use magic. I was worried at first, that I would be in trouble for the apparition. But no one has shown up to arrest me, so whatever is happening, it does not register as me performing magic.”
Draco surged forward, slotting a thigh between Harry’s legs and rutting against his hip. His hands were clutching Harry’s jumper. Harry met him thrust for thrust.
Harry squinted at it; the purple and blue lights reflecting off the chandelier made it hard to see, but the mortar appeared to be a rosy shade of mauve. Bile rose in Harry’s throat and he had to look away. It was the exact color of the kitchen wallpaper at number four Privet Drive.
But Harry had another reason for coming to Hogwarts today, one that Draco couldn’t yet know about. And the walk would just have made Harry jittery, a needless burden on his already fraying nerves.
Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably, then crossed the room to fetch a plate from one of the cabinets.
Harry chuckled. The Hogwarts staff had apparently decided to be quite accommodating about eighth year bedrooms. The dormitory was large enough for them each to have their own small room, but it easily adapted to the preferences of its residents. The rooms responded to any polite (and reasonable) request. Ron and Hemione had created a lovely shared bedroom for themselves, complete with an entire wall of bookshelves and a small corner dedicated to the bright orange of the Chudley Cannons.
“Well if the bloody Savior says it, it must be true,” Malfoy quipped, but there was no humor in his tone. He turned away from Harry and rested his head against the desk.
Silent tears were streaming down Draco’s face as he stared at Luna. Harry reached for him, but Luna got there first. Draco buried his head in her stomach and continued to cry. She wrapped her arms around him and gently stroked his hair.
Now that classes had resumed, Draco had taken to spending their lunch hour in the hospital wing visiting Blaise.
Panting raggedly, Draco squirmed in his chair, his trousers uncomfortably tight against his half-hard cock. Harry was just as affected, eyes glazed over and breath coming in stuttering gasps.
He was stiff at first, too formal. But then came a charming witch in a sparkling cloak, inquiring politely about different teas with a slight French accent that reminded Draco of his mother. She was effervescent, bubbling over with a wellspring of inner joy. Draco served her a crisp, herbal tea paired with spongy cake full to bursting with strawberries and cream. Her parting grin was so delighted, and so genuine, that Draco found himself stunned.
Harry mumbled a sheepish apology. When his heart slowed, he gave Draco a wry smile and continued. “No, definitely not. I think Lavender might want that, eventually, but I – I just can’t. I don’t want that kind of life anymore.”
Just this once, Harry had thought he’d get to explore Hogwarts’ mysteries for the joy of it, not because the world might be at stake.
“I’m sorry,” Potter repeated, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jeans. Despite looking thoroughly abashed, he stepped closer to Draco. “I didn’t think I hit your face, but I guess I must have knocked you with my forehead or something. It looks pretty bad. Do you want me to –” he bit his lip, but then jutted his chin forward stubbornly and continued – “do you want me to heal it?”
“Sorry,” Draco mumbled, appropriately abashed. The back of his neck burned. He wished he could reach for his ring. “I’m just – frightened.”
Harry shook his head. “No, not the way you mean.” He ate a few more chips, thoughtful. “I’m lonely sometimes,” he admitted, “but not for her. If that makes sense.”
“Holding steady! Not sure how much longer I can –” She cut herself off, whipping her wand in an intricate pattern.
And Malfoy had been there at the edge of it, goading Harry and focusing him, somehow making the entire experience sharper and more thrilling. Flying had been wonderful, but the challenge – one he was equipped to meet head on, rather than having to run from – that had been
It was like Harry had been studying an abstract painting, unable to make sense of the swirls of color. But then Hermione had reached out and inverted the frame, and suddenly the distorted image came together before Harry’s eyes, distinct shapes that had lingered unseen, waiting to unveil and dance for him, if only he would actually look.
It was a cautious, gentle thing at first, just lips and breath and eyelashes, fingers barely grazing skin. The heat built slowly, kindling from the embers, the steady warmth of fire-bright coal. Languorous caresses melting into rhythm and friction and stammered pleas.
“You can say anything to me, you know that. But you haven’t asked a single question. You haven’t even gotten angry.”
Harry flipped them over, so Draco was sprawled on his back, then threw out a hand to wandlessly summon a bottle of lube from Draco’s bedside drawer. Legs trembling, Draco stared at Harry’s hands as he slicked his fingers.
“I understand.” Draco placed his hand atop Harry’s, giving him a reassuring squeeze before letting go. “Is there something you do want to do?”
Above them, the vines swayed, their velvet soft petals set free to swirl through the air, slowly drifting downward to blanket the ground.
An ocean landscape on a beautiful summer day. Gulls cried out in the distance, mingling with the sounds of waves crashing against the shore. The wind picked up, carrying the scent of salt and brine as the air warmed.
Lavender laughed joyfully, throwing up a Shield Charm and blasting the hexes aside. Just as she raised her wand for a counterattack, Harry swung a fist upward, aiming something toward her face. It glanced off her Shield Charm, but it was just enough of a distraction for Harry to gain the advantage. With a vicious spinning kick, he flung a Trip Jinx at her that cut through her defenses and took her out at the ankles.
Draco consciously stilled his hands, resting one in his lap and reclaiming his spoon with the other. “It’s not as similar a skill set as I expected,” Draco said before neatly swallowing a few spoonfuls of soup. The observation was detached, far less emotional than what he had just admitted, and he found that distance comforting. “I had quite a few disasters at first,” he added with a shrug. “But I kept at it, and I enjoyed learning.”
He stood in the doorway, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. His bemused expression did little to hide the tired lines of his face or the deep circles under his eyes. His glasses were perched on his nose, but he was still shirtless, revealing muscular shoulders and toned abs. His sweatpants hung low enough that sharp hip bones peeked out, two tantalizing lines drawing the eye downward. Draco’s throat, already dry, tightened further and he had to quickly look away. The silence buzzed in his ears as Potter stared at him, clearly at a loss for what to say.
“Better you hurt me in self-defense than I hurt you unprovoked,” Draco whispered, voice tight. “I couldn’t have lived with myself if I had hurt you.”
Harry gave Draco’s wrist another tug and he finally stopped resisting, falling into step beside Harry and grumbling to himself as they moved through the fog.
“I’ll look into it,” Hermione promised. “In the meantime, we need to gather more information. You should start keeping a written record of each incident, to be sure we don’t miss any details.”
The flowers from the courtyard had infiltrated the Quidditch Pitch, twining through the stands and infusing the late-October air with their peculiar scent. They shimmered in tiny silver and gold blooms, gleefully mirroring the night sky.
As he baked, Harry had lost himself in the memory of their first kiss, and that star-touched night had made its way into the pie. Apple filling to recall tart bludgers and the taste of Draco’s lips. The spices, painstakingly chosen, to evoke the warmth of their blood against the chill winds of night. A glaze, lovingly crafted to resemble the sheen of moonlight. And of course, a burst of hidden berries, to tantalize the tongue as surely as those miraculous flowers dazzled the eyes.
“Hello, Harry!” Hermione called out brightly. Her smile widened when she caught sight of Draco. “Draco! I’m so glad you could make it.”
“Yeah, but all physical. You attack and defend with your body instead of magic. I joined a Muggle club in Brixton.”
His feet pounded against the dirt trail, and with every footfall, echoes of the inked letters seemed to shudder up his shins, clawing at his spine. They looped thorny tendrils around his lungs, stealing his breath as they pulled tight.
“Is that all?” Blaise went on. “No beautiful damsel on your arm, pestering you to make an honest man out of him?”
Harry blinked in surprise, oddly touched. He had been expecting an interrogation of sorts, but all traces of Malfoy’s impatience had vanished. There was a worried crease in his forehead, and he looked as though he genuinely wanted to help.
Harry obeyed, and Draco followed him down, kissing him tenderly as he carefully massaged Harry’s hole. His touch was electric, a lightning strike that traveled up Harry’s entire spine.
“Thank you for inviting me, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said, holding out a small parcel. “I brought you some teas from Novelle’s. Harry said you enjoy sampling different flavors.”
McGonagall stared into the murky depths of Draco’s potion. “This potion is entirely untested, Mr. Malfoy. I cannot sanction its use without –”
“And I think you should stop pressuring yourself,” Draco said, voice quieter now, but just as emphatic. “You’ve more than earned a break. Besides, what you choose to do right now doesn’t have to determine what you do next. You don’t have to pick one thing and pursue that forever. I say do what you like, and when you stop liking it, stop doing it. Think of it like your white morning mugs. You get to decide, every day. You can always, always choose again.”
When Draco had gone rigid at the first brush of Harry’s lips, Harry had felt like the entire world was shattering. That one moment had called into question everything Harry thought he understood about his developing relationship with Draco, and he had cursed every assumption that had led him to make such a brash, impulsive move. But then Draco had surprised him. He hadn’t let Harry run. He had asked to try again.
Draco gave another slow nod. His expression was troubled, but after a moment he tentatively touched Harry’s shoulder. Harry leaned into him, and suddenly they were curled together, Harry’s head on Draco’s chest, the comforting weight of Draco’s arms around him.
“This wasn’t what I expected it to be like, you know. Seeing each other again.” His eyes were open now, but he kept them fixed on the night sky, not turning to Harry.
The other man bristled slightly, but didn’t rise to the bait. “Yes, Potter,” he drawled out. “I have literally performed that spell in my sleep. I am quite certain.”
After a miserable weekend without so much as a glimpse of Malfoy, Harry had tentatively looked forward to the week’s new workshop, hoping the class would somehow bridge the gap between them.
, and as he lowered his wand, he saw that his school robes had been transfigured into a Muggle suit with a fitted green waistcoat.
He started to toy with Draco’s trousers, running a finger along the button and up and down the seam.
Harry exhaled in sudden relief. An unconscious part of him had been tense all afternoon, terrified that Maeve had been the only thing tying Draco to London, dreading the moment when Draco would say that he was leaving too. Harry had not even registered the silent fear until the weight of it was gone.
They were in the bathroom now, the space lit only by candles as Draco filled the tub with steaming water. The room was all driftwood and stone, the tub set into the floor like their own private little cavern, the aquamarine tiles sparkling like the sea.
Harry paced across the floor of his bedroom, muttering obscenities under his breath. Almost unconsciously, he projected his magic outward, tangling it into the folds of his invisibility cloak.
Ginny groaned, collapsing back dramatically into the sofa cushions. Ron kicked her ankle., then dodged her retaliatory shove.
genius plan, Potter,” Draco drawled, oddly unconcerned. He shrugged and lay down amongst the flowers, a maddening echo of Harry’s wish.
Will had really pushed him after that. Harry’s stamina was excellent, but his speed and accuracy still needed a lot of work, and Will was a rigorous trainer.
Draco felt a pang in his chest, like he’d been suddenly deprived of air. “Maeve, you know I can’t –”
Without waiting for a response, Harry had kissed Draco on the temple and climbed out of bed. He pulled on trousers and a cloak before heading out to the Great Hall.
Maeve stood with a chuckle and a slight grimace. Pressing a hand to her lower back, she answered nonchalantly. “A fair few.” Her mouth twisted thoughtfully then, and she pinned Draco with the force of her gaze. “You ever want to do more than mix tea blends, you let me know.”
Bewildered, Harry stared down at his plate. He was sure there was some article somewhere, if not more than one, that detailed the food preferences of “the chosen one,” but Maeve hadn’t seemed the type to go in for all that Harry Potter savior nonsense. He had liked that about her, and the idea of her reading up on him after their last meeting didn’t sit well with him.
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut. Tilting his chin, he pressed his lips to Draco’s palm. He worshipped the skin there, working his way down in a series of wet, open-mouthed kisses, lavishing attention on all the tiny bones of Draco’s wrist.
Harry leaned harder into the wall, relishing the rough stone scraping against his back, the contrast making the velvet hand on his cock feel that much sweeter.
I was scared, all the time. And I thought, if I could just be who he wanted me to be, think what he wanted me to think, maybe it wouldn’t hurt so much.”
of you. And it’s beautiful, Draco. You’re so fucking beautiful. And when you cook for me and scowl at me across the table, I don’t ever want to let you go, because you feel like home in a way I’ve never had.”
Draco nodded, then abruptly turned away from Harry before the tears could spill over. He picked up the glass with a shaking hand and sipped it slowly.
Malfoy’s smile cracked and fell away. “I can’t believe we’re not allowed on the House teams. I was really looking forward to flying again.”
Harry wanted to grasp Draco’s hand, pull him toward the edge and jump with him, remind him that he would always be there to catch him after the fall. But Harry forced himself to be patient, because these were decisions Draco needed to come to on his own.
Granger scoffed at that, though not unkindly. She seemed to be directing her ire at the Ministry, rather than at him. Draco supposed he should have expected nothing less from one of Harry’s friends. Gryffindors, noble to a fault.
Draco spilled over Harry’s hand as Harry groaned and came inside him. And then they slumped into the cushions, tangled together beneath the twinkling glow of a thousand tiny stars.

Draco had looked up at Harry then and flushed. He stood hurriedly and strode over to the gate, awkwardly brushing dirt from his knees as he went.
“Having fun, sweetheart?” Harry whispered, his lips pressed discreetly to Draco’s ear while Molly was absorbed in mashing butter and cream into the potatoes.
Draco slipped his hand beneath the sheet and then Harry’s cock was in his palm, hot and thick and utterly perfect. Draco moaned as he wrapped his fingers around it, wanking Harry with long, languorous strokes. Harry keened low in his throat, his hips bucking.
“Oh yes,” Maeve confirmed, nodding cheerfully. “It goes both ways from the very beginning. Quite strongly too.”
Harry, however, found it hard to pay attention to anything else. His mind kept wandering down garden paths, stray thoughts snagging on lustrous petals and trailing in the wind.
It was Draco’s tell, that fixation on the food, making it glaringly obvious that he was worried. And so, all week, Harry had casually brought up the Weasleys in conversation, trying to reinforce the idea that they would be welcoming to Draco. He mentioned Molly’s desire to try Novelle’s teas, wondered aloud if Draco’s knowledge of magical theory would overlap with anything George studied for his product development, told funny stories about Arthur’s misguided attempts to charm all things Muggle.
But Draco needed one more thing, one last thing before he could let himself come apart. He seized his wand again, waving it above him before tossing it to the floor.
But Harry couldn’t do any of those things, so he just kept hold of Draco’s hand, running his thumb over his palm in soothing circles.
“Not your fault,” Potter mumbled. Still trembling, he drew the blankets up to his chin, hiding his bare chest. “Draco –”
Letting the words of the argument fade into background noise, Harry drifted toward the flowers. He teased out several strands of his magic, tethering one to Draco.
Harry finally looked away from the window, meeting Draco’s eyes briefly before dropping wearily back into his chair. “You don’t deserve that,” he mumbled. “It’s too much.”
The two squared off, eyes never leaving each other even as they bowed, then immediately launched into action. There was none of the cautious circling that had begun each previous match. Harry and his trainer –
His eyes narrowed as they snapped back to this supposed “curse-breaker.” The man was dressed in a sleek blue cloak and excessively tight trousers. He had a burnished wand-holster strapped to his arm that should have looked ridiculous, but somehow only emphasized his bulging muscles. Harry glowered, deciding he absolutely did not trust this suspiciously attractive man or his shiny hair. His hands were flailing about pathetically as he spoke with Jaffey and he was clearly out of his depth. He had no chance of helping Harry and Draco’s flowers.
Harry heard Draco’s breath hitch. He brought his hands to cradle Draco’s arse, running his thumbs over his hip bones. The touch was as soothing as it was provocative, and though Draco bit his lip and flushed prettily, he also relaxed, muscles surrendering to Harry’s ministrations.
After several excruciating minutes of silence, McGonagall returned to her desk and picked up her teacup. The tea had to have gone cold by now, but she calmly drank it down to the dregs before turning her attention back to Harry and Draco.
“Thank you, Draco. That was very thoughtful of you.” Molly wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulder with a motherly cluck of her tongue. “Why don’t you come tell me all about them while I check on the roast?” she suggested, beginning to lead Draco away toward the kitchen.
But what would he do with all those spices? He supposed he could learn to cook some new meals. That might also help with the boredom.
and I know you want to do something you love, not just chase after criminals because it’s expected of you, and I could not agree with you more. I want you to be happy, you
. Something that smelled of a forest in the springtime, fresh and green, clean as rain. Harry breathed deep, relaxing as that horrible, hollow feeling seemed to bleed out of him.
Draco smiled at the next customer, and set about finding the right confection to match this stranger’s heart.
Harry reeled backward, choking on a pained noise as he darted an anxious look at Draco. Draco’s face was stricken, crumpled in grief, and Harry didn’t want to worry him further by panicking.
“Are these pretty mugs not for drinking then?” he teased, tone warm with amusement despite his genuine curiosity. “Stripped of their true purpose, valued only for their looks, relegated to little better than colorful clutter?” Potter cracked an eye open and raised an eyebrow. Encouraged, Draco continued. “What have they done to deserve this cruel fate, Potter? I may weep at their plight!”
“Thank you,” Draco said, as Harry sat back down. “I always feel better when I can breathe the air from outside.”
Afterward, McGonagall had required another explanation, insisting they go through it all calmly and without speaking over one another.
Harry closed his eyes, burrowing a little deeper into Draco. The room was pleasantly warm from the fire and Draco’s arm was a steady, comforting weight draped over Harry’s side. He was just beginning to drift off when Draco spoke.
Draco’s breath caught, but he managed not to jump. It was a coincidence, he assured himself, that was all. Harry couldn’t possibly know.
“No, Harry,” Draco said firmly. “It wouldn’t have been right. I told her everything that day, more than I had ever spoken about before, even when giving my testimony to the Wizengamot. Maeve listened, let me tell the whole sordid thing. When I finished, I told her I would understand if she did not want a person like me working for her, and that if she preferred, I would not visit the shop again.”
They finished their tea in comfortable silence, gazing up at the sky as the first stars appeared out of the darkness.
When Draco’s eyes flicked open not a minute later, Harry peered up at him, giving him a smoldering look from beneath his eyelashes. He licked Draco once, a long line from root to tip.
The place itself becomes dangerous, hurting people in ways that resemble the effects of explosions or curses. But no matter how bad it is, your own magic is not affected. You still have control over your magic to respond to whatever trouble the residual Dark Magic causes you.”
Draco hummed thoughtfully. He gathered up the bowls and utensils and carried them to the sink. As he rinsed them, delicately maneuvering around the pile of dirty dishes already there, he said, “I had always wondered if it would be possible to incorporate more – palatable ingredients into potion making. I thought there surely must be a better way than all those foul-tasting concoctions made of bits and pieces of insects and the like.” He grimaced, and bent to check on the meat in the oven. “And then I met Maeve, and I fell in love with tea, and I wanted to know more about it. So I started reading all these books, about the history of tea-making, and that led me to books about natural healing and the medicinal properties of herbs and plants.”
“Oh! Right, sorry to – er, to keep you.” Potter tugged at his matted strands of hair. He looked off-balance somehow, as if Draco’s refusal had rocked the ground beneath his feet. But then he brightened, and Draco almost staggered back under the force of his smile.
Several of their classmates had walked by on their way to the common room, some shaking their heads and some laughing, but Harry and Malfoy paid them no mind, neither willing to look away from his opponent.
, like a hot towel soothing the back of his neck. Harry chased the sensation, sinking deeper into Malfoy’s magic. It shifted in twisting spirals, moving away from Malfoy and toward Harry.
And something inside Draco loosened. For the first time, moving on did not seem impossible. Perhaps Draco could be forgiven. Perhaps someday he might be worthy of Harry’s love.
Draco placed a teasing finger against Harry’s lips. “Shh,” he murmured, his other hand slipping soothingly into Harry’s disheveled black locks. Still keeping a hateful distance between their cocks, Draco leaned in to whisper in Harry’s ear. “Go wait for me on the bed, alright?”
Draco pocketed his notebook, but before he could get to his feet Harry had dropped to his knees beside him.
Draco was already at Luna’s side, combing his fingers through her hair and holding a cloth to her brow. His eyes were darting helplessly from Blaise to Neville to Hannah, as if desperately seeking a way to comfort them all.
Draco’s mouth fell open and his hands stilled under the water. “How?” he managed, after a beat of stunned silence.
It did not take long. Draco had already been perilously close. A few tugs, then one twist of Harry’s wrist and he was gone, coming all over Harry’s fingers with a loud groan.
Draco gave a suspiciously triumphant shout, then clapped his hand over his mouth for the second time in as many minutes. He coughed abruptly, as if trying to distract from his outburst. When Harry’s eyes flickered over to him, he looked furious with himself.
“Malfoy and I just learned that these flowers are artifacts of the war,” Harry offered, tone carefully neutral. “They bloom in response to self-sacrifice.”
Malfoy held the flower out to Harry in careful, trembling hands. He was still clearly terrified, the hollows of his face catching the shadows and giving him a grim, haunted look. But even still, Malfoy’s entire body was alive with curiosity and wonder.
They crashed together, tossing clothes haphazardly to the floor, until they tumbled onto their sides, skin to skin and everywhere slick and hot and gleaming.
Harry didn’t know what that thing could possibly be, but he did know that he never would have thought to look for it if it hadn’t been for Draco.
“Draco!” she cried, pulling a chair right up to the fire and throwing herself into it. “Is everything alright? Has something happened?”
Harry understood what Draco was offering, and so, he closed his eyes and let go of his final secret.
Harry felt the grass beneath his fingers and slowly came back to the present. His breathing slowed as he remembered what it had felt like that night at the Manor – staring into Malfoy’s eyes and seeing not an enemy, but another victim of the war. That night had been the first time Harry understood that the children of the enemy were suffering too.
“But I haven’t even done anything!” Harry cried. His skin prickled with shame at his own ineptitude.
Harry eased Draco back against the pillows and began to pull up the blankets, but Draco caught his wrist.
“Tell me again about the first time,” Draco said. “When you threw off the full body-bind. What happened just before? What were you thinking – or feeling, maybe? Can you remember what you were feeling?”
Shivering slightly, Harry chafed his palms over the goosebumps on his arms and bounced up and down to loosen his calves. Lavender gave him one last look of concern before launching into a jog, setting a moderate pace for their usual three lap warm up. A narrow track wrapped around the perimeter of the building, magically shielded from the rest of the space to protect runners from rogue jinxes and curses.
Through the thin walls, Harry heard a groan. For a moment, he thought Draco might not answer, but then he heard shuffling footsteps that grew louder as Draco approached the door.
“That’s alright, Wilfred,” Harry said, scooping him up and setting him on his feet. “You’re doing really well.”
The thought was comforting. He would be able to feel her presence here, even when she had gone, and he would guard this home of hers, keeping it safe until she could return.
“That sounds like such a – waste,” Harry said, but then he realized he was grinning. “But that doesn’t matter, does it? Because it would be for
Harry smiled, his cheeks coloring slightly. His fingers twitched, drawing Draco’s attention to the book in his lap.
“I don’t know,” Harry admitted, feeling even more miserable than he had that morning when Malfoy fled the courtyard.
Harry sat back down on the sofa as Maeve made her way across the room. She would be flooing to the Ministry, where she would pick up her international portkey. Draco was waiting for her by the fire, hands knotted into the grey jumper he wore over his crisp white collared shirt.
No, Harry had done this as a kindness. Because he genuinely believed that Draco had changed. Because he cared about Draco’s future. Because he cared about
Draco took a bite of the meat and marveled at its tenderness. “This is delicious, Harry. Thank you.”
“Oh?” Draco had gone stiff, but Harry knew him well enough now to understand that he was surprised, not uncomfortable. The clenched muscles relaxed almost immediately as Draco continued to work his fingers over Harry’s scalp.
Harry was standing with his back to Draco. He had raised the blinds again, and was gazing solemnly out the window. There was a rigidity to his spine that was unnatural for him, and when Draco rounded the table to set the tray down on the counter, he saw that Harry’s jaw was clenched, sharp as cut glass.
Draco smiled against Harry’s lips, caressing his cheek tenderly before pulling away and settling on his back in the grass. As he stared up at the stars, his expression went distant, and Harry knew he was attempting to puzzle everything out.
“No,” Draco said. “In this scenario, Maeve would hire a private detective to find me. And you would play the grieving boy–” he cut off abruptly, two spots of color flaring high on his cheeks.
“I usually kickbox in the afternoons, but my trainer was busy,” Harry said, after they had both ordered. “I needed something to do, and –” he hesitated, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose – “I wanted to see you.”
The fire had made the room uncomfortably hot, and Malfoy’s grief had tangled into Harry’s fear, turning the normally comforting space oppressive. The thought of flying – of the crisp night air and open sky, of laughing and competing with Malfoy – was exhilarating in comparison. Harry suddenly needed that outlet so badly that his chest ached.
“We could get breakfast, instead,” Lavender suggested, after an awkwardly long silence. “Do you want pancakes? Pancakes always make me feel better.”
Harry didn’t care what it was. He felt like he was scrabbling at the edge of a cliff, and he wasn’t prepared for the fall.
Malfoy shrank back and quickly pulled his hand away from Harry’s. He hesitated, but then he spoke. “When the Dark – when
Draco paled at that, and Harry knocked a knee against his under the table in a show of solidarity. After a tiny flinch, Draco pressed more firmly into Harry’s touch. A flare of heat snaked up Harry’s spine.
“How do they restrict you?” Granger scuffed her chair closer and leaned forward until her nose was almost touching the fire. There was an eager gleam in her eyes. “Are you physically incapable, or –” She clapped a hand to her mouth. “Oh Merlin, Draco, I’m so sorry – I didn’t mean to be insensitive! I was just thinking about the apparition, and what if whatever they did to you is interacting with the bond or life-debt, and well, I just got ahead of myself.” She flapped her hands a bit pathetically, then tucked them into her lap. “I’m sorry,” she said contritely. “You don’t have to answer.”
Draco’s cheeks were flushed and his fingers tapped erratically against Harry’s knee. Harry grinned soppily at him, surprised he wasn’t muttering under his breath as he worked his way through the mental labyrinth that had captured him.
A window was thrown wide, inviting in the chill night air. Clustered on the sill were dozens of potted plants, petals fluttering in the breeze. With a slight pang, Harry recognized the glass-like flower from the Room of Requirement. It was shimmering at the center of Malfoy’s little garden.
“Draco!” Maeve yelled, snapping Draco out of his chocolate-tinged daydream. “There’s a young man here to see you!”
Draco bit his lip. Tears burned behind his eyes. All he wanted to do was collapse to his knees and drop his head in Harry’s lap, but George had not yet released them from the spell. He was still staring at the bizarre display of colors, eyes darting between the orange knots.
Harry grinned at him and opened his own packet of crisps, pleased when Draco ate another handful. They munched quietly for a few minutes, shoulders pressed together where they leaned against the stone wall, enjoying the sun on their faces and the rustle of leaves in the breeze. At one point, a bright blue butterfly landed on Draco’s elbow, lazily fluttering its wings. Harry and Draco both stilled so as not to startle it, Draco hardly even seeming to breathe. The butterfly’s wings were tinged purple at the edges, the colors so vibrant that it felt as magical as the garden.
And it meant something, Harry thought, that Malfoy was willing to accept blame. Malfoy hadn’t apologized for his actions, but Harry could see the remorse just the same.
Harry leaned into the touch before turning his head to kiss Draco’s palm. And then Draco was moving his finger again, and Harry was no longer capable of any kind of coordinated movement. All he could do was lie there, practically melting into the tub as pleasure radiated outward from his arse all the way to his toes, to the crown of his head, to the very tips of his fingers.
Draco had bolted upright, flushing a deep red as he clutched the blankets to his chest. Harry suppressed a chuckle, knowing that Draco was remembering (and panicking about) the vulnerability he had shown during the night. But Harry also knew that the shame was merely a surface reaction, and he wasn’t going to let it stop him from giving Draco what he needed.
Shaking, Draco hugged his arms into his chest. His fingers scrabbled at his elbows, his nails biting into his flesh. Very slowly, so as not to make any noise, Draco pushed his chair away from the table and stood up.
Hermione tapped a finger against her lips, ignoring Harry’s protest. “I’m also curious to know what would happen if you apparated voluntarily,” she mused. “Neither of you have tried that since this started, have you?”
A man who must have been her father grimaced apologetically as he followed. Petals dropped from the huge bouquet of flowers he carried, fluttering in the breeze until they settled at Draco’s feet.
Harry jumped, knocking his knees against the underside of the table. He yelped in pain and accidentally flung the sugar spoon into the air. “Wh-what?” he spluttered, looking away. “Ginny – she, er… didn’t she tell you?”
They stared at each other for two long heartbeats before Malfoy continued. “You’re blocking my light.”
Harry snogged him for three more perfect seconds before finally relenting and pulling away. Still grinning wildly, he tried to explain what he had felt. “I don’t understand how, but the flowers are still fighting. Their residue, it’s surrounding the hooks, bunching around them – just like before! The hooks used to be inside the flowers. Like the blooms were trying to swallow them or something.”
Harry darted a look at Draco, who continued to be of no help at all. He was staring determinedly at the floor, face so pale he looked ill. His hands were clasped tightly together in his lap, and Harry thought they might be trembling.
Draco’s eyes widened. “Emptiness,” he whispered. He stared up at Hermione in awe, as if she had solved the mystery of the cosmos.
There was a long silence as McGonagall considered that. She went back to studying the letter while Harry anxiously crumbled a biscuit between his fingers. Forcing himself to stop, he glanced around the office, mildly curious about the changes McGonagall had made. On the far wall hung a cluster of Muggle art prints, abstract watercolors that Harry found inexplicably lovely. The bold colors stood out in the otherwise spare office, drawing the eye.
Malfoy really must be up to something. The posh git had always been irritatingly punctual. In six years, Harry had never once seen him walk in late to a class, like it was beneath him to take a wrong turn in the corridor or misplace his parchment. If he was this late, and on the first day, there must be a reason.
He brought a hand to the muscles of Harry’s chest, fingers trailing downward to stroke the line of soft hair on Harry’s belly.
Draco sat atop a tall stool, positioned at Molly’s elbow by the stove. His face was serious, his eyes intent on Molly’s wand as she siphoned juices from the roast. Molly was speaking quietly to Draco, waiting for his sharp nod before moving on to explain the next step. And then Harry noticed Draco moving his hands, carefully mirroring Molly’s graceful wand motions. Harry’s breath caught as longing surged through him, an echo of Draco’s pain for the magic he had lost.
Harry nodded. He wanted to wrap an arm around Draco, but he was leaning forward, hands still busy with the bottles.
Draco hesitated. When he answered, his tone was carefully controlled. “Yes. You said their letter felt genuine. Kind.”
Draco hissed and flinched back, wincing as his skin throbbed beneath Potter’s touch. He brought his own hand up protectively, gently covering the heated, rapidly bruising flesh.
“I was reading them all morning, and I guess I just got overwhelmed. It was the same thing, over and over. All these people wanting a piece of Harry Potter, offering me things I didn’t earn, invasive questions, demands, guilt trips.” Harry sighed.
never been able to take his eyes off Draco on the Pitch, and maybe there had been more to that than just beating him to the Snitch…
McGonagall joined them briefly, only long enough to assure them that Luna was stable. The hooks were as frozen as she was, and at the moment, they had every reason to believe she could stay that way indefinitely. There was time yet to search for a cure.
Draco took a moment at Blaise’s side, bowing his head and grasping Blaise’s forearm. He checked in on Neville and Hannah too, then headed for the door.
Harry didn’t say anything. He just placed his palm flat over Draco’s heart, mirroring the gesture Draco had made twice now, challenging him to deny the declaration it implied.
Harry’s heart seemed to contract in his chest, clenching painfully around the memory of their fight in the courtyard, when Harry had thrown Draco’s words about trust back in his face. Harry took a shaky breath and reached out again, clasping Draco’s hands in his own.
“Yes, well –” Draco blushed, huffing out an embarrassed breath. “They were beautiful, and fascinating. I suppose I didn’t like the idea of them being Dark.”
“Yes,” Draco said wistfully. “I had always hoped to meet her someday.” He shifted to face Harry, resting his back against the arm of the sofa.
“She was stuck on the residual Dark Magic idea for a while, as I had been. But then she said something that got me thinking.” Draco trailed off, staring at the glass flower again.
Outside, an owl hooted and the wind rustled against their window. The glass flower swayed and danced in the light breeze. It opened its petals, bathing the room in the subtle scents of fresh soil and citrus.
From the start, Maeve had centered the baking around Draco, relegating herself to a supporting role. He’d balked at first, insisting that he was not a baker, but Maeve was having none of it.
He bent his knees, propping an ankle against his thigh. Absently, he began to move his foot in slow, restless circles.
Draco was watching her uneasily. Harry reached out to squeeze his hand and was relieved to see some of the tension drop from Draco’s shoulders.
Draco frowned after her, stymied by her stubbornness. Maeve would be leaving in a little over a month, and she refused to accept that certain changes would need to be made if Draco was to look after the shop. He was uncomfortable relying on magic to take inventory and to order ingredients when he could not perform the spells himself.
There was another pause. Harry kicked off his trainers and moved to sit cross-legged. He sighed and rested his elbow against the arm of the sofa, propping his head in his hand.
But Harry was also dedicating more time to Defense – continuing to hone his kickboxing, reading up on defensive technique, both magical and Muggle, and experimenting with new physical forms for various spells. Harry was building something, Draco was certain, even if neither of them knew precisely what that something might be. Draco would not be the reason Harry lost his momentum. Even a part-time job at Novelle’s would cut too deeply into time better spent exploring what Harry truly loved.
Harry and Draco exchanged a look. Without having to discuss it, they immediately moved closer to watch.
“Potter,” Draco said, barely audible. “I need –” Unable to continue, he hung his head and gripped the edge of the table.
He quickly swept crumbs off the counter and began to line up cups and small plates in preparation for the late afternoon rush. But Maeve took them right out of his hands and nudged him toward the register.
“When the apparition first started, and I saw your fl–” Harry cut himself off, chagrined. He and Draco had never discussed money before, and it suddenly felt incredibly rude to be commenting on the state of Draco’s flat.
Harry gulped, his eyes tracking Draco’s fingers, sweeping down the expanse of newly revealed skin. Emboldened by Harry’s gaze, Draco trailed a fingertip down his own chest, pausing to circle one of his nipples. It hardened slowly, and Draco pinched it, releasing a breathy whimper. Harry had to stagger back to lean against the counter, his hands clenching on the edge of the sink.
Draco felt his cheeks heat, and he nuzzled deeper into Harry. The fabric of the grey dress shirt was cool and silky, finer than anything Draco would have expected Harry to own. A thread of suspicion snaked its way through Draco’s reverie.
Harry lay down again and opened his eyes to the sky. The stars reminded him of Sirius, and Sirius always made him brave.
“Sometimes the simple things are the hardest to master,” Draco retorted. “I’ve never managed to cook steak half so well as this.”
Harry frowned, then rearranged himself in a messy scramble of limbs until he was sitting cross-legged facing Draco. “I thought you didn’t use potions when your magic was restricted.”
“Scared, Potter?” he breathed out, barely audible. He had never sounded less like the cocksure boy who used to spit those words at Harry at the slightest provocation. But Harry was absurdly grateful for the familiar taunt.
Draco smiled lazily, and it was almost a smirk, so close to the boy he used to be that Harry grew dizzy in the face of how far they had come.
The door to the shop clattered open then, admitting a group of giggling teenagers. Maeve greeted them warmly and stumped back over to the counter.
Harry tried out his second smirk of the night, with significant success. Draco averted his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest.
He looked quite put out about it, and Harry found it inexplicably charming. He wanted to smooth the worry lines from Malfoy’s forehead with gentle fingertips and kiss away his frown.
“It’s because of you,” Harry had whispered. “I didn’t know what was wrong with me, what I needed. But now I’m working on the Defense stuff, and it matters to me, and suddenly stillness isn’t so scary.”
Harry closed his eyes and sent a wave of magic over the prone forms of his classmates. Prodding intently, he sought out the residue and immediately recoiled. Frozen no longer, the hooks were wriggling, digging their way into their victims’ cores.
Harry twisted in his chair, centering his sight fully on Draco. “What do you mean?” he asked, lightly touching Draco’s shoulder.
Luna gave him an uncharacteristically sharp look, but when she spoke, it was in her usual, dream-like tone. “Does it matter, if people notice?”
Draco took a step back, surveying the shelf from more of a distance. He nodded to himself and turned to lean against the wall, arms crossed and a crooked little smirk aimed at Harry. The self-satisfied expression was so charming, and at such odds with the uncertainty in Draco’s eyes, that Harry’s head swam dizzily.
Harry closed his eyes and leaned into the caress before he continued. “But none of it felt anything like what’s in the flowers, so I guess it didn’t do any good.”
“I’m glad,” Draco said. Whatever darkness had gripped him seemed to retreat, and the air between them grew less fraught.
“Oh.” The word was high pitched and oddly breathy. Malfoy ducked his head, pale strands of hair obscuring his expression. “And then you blundered ahead into a completely different kind of apology and forgot all about the potentially important discovery you made?” he finally grumbled.
Malfoy opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again, then frowned, a flicker of vulnerability warring with the steel of his expression.
He hadn’t meant anything by it, the mocking thought that flickered like a guttering candle behind his closed eyes. The nameless assailant had shoved Draco roughly against a stone wall, and as he braced for the blow something in him had called out to the past.
“Are you moving in here?” Harry bit his lip, tried to keep his voice from shaking. “Above the shop?”
“Merlin’s beard!” Hermione exclaimed, cutting Draco off. “My meeting’s starting. Got to go! We’ll talk soon.”
Harry shook off his grip and hunched forward, refusing to budge. “Ron, I can’t. I can’t just sit in the common room while he’s –”
“Yes, I thought you’d appreciate that,” Draco said, smiling fondly. A moment later, the smile faltered. Draco sighed and hugged his knees into his chest. “And then she said, ‘I also know who you are now, and it’s certainly not a Death Eater. Now, do you want this job or not?’”
“Well…” Ginny fidgeted uncomfortably in her chair. After a moment she stood and walked over to the sink. Briskly washing her hands, she mumbled, “I may have made her promise not to tell you.”
“Why that moment?” Draco asked. “Shouldn’t there be more glass flowers then, if this book can be believed?”
“Why is he being pulled to me when I’m in need?” Draco held out his hands, weighing the inconsistencies in his palms. “If I am the one who owes the life-debt incurred in the Room of Requirement, should it not be only me that is pulled to him?”
back to him, hand working tirelessly as Draco met him with tiny thrusts, almost bouncing in Harry’s lap. Harry’s thighs began to tremble beneath Draco’s arse and everything in Draco pulled tight, until he was spilling over Harry’s fingers. Harry sucked in a sharp breath and followed, coming with a hoarse cry.
Harry tipped his head back, gazed at the rustling branches above his head, and let himself get lost in everything that was Draco.
It seemed an odd question, seeing as Draco was so obviously enamored with the story himself, but Harry didn’t mind answering. Those books were like dueling, really. A way to feed the parts of him that still longed for the intrigues of the war.
Draco poked at the dough in front of him, wondering whether caramel or butterscotch would best bring out the smoky richness of Novelle’s signature black tea. Maeve sidled up next to him before he could decide. She peered skeptically at the finely ground tea leaves that speckled the dough.
Malfoy added a shimmering powder to one cauldron before inserting a glass rod into another. He stirred the potion with precise motions, then cast a wandless stasis charm over the whole table.
Harry snorted at that, but his eyes were warm with fondness. Draco smiled at Hermione and nodded in agreement.
McGonagall’s usual stern countenance settled back into place. “Nonsense, Mr. Malfoy. While I appreciate your offer and while I do not object to you and Mr. Potter handling the residue at Hogwarts, you must realize that this residue likely contaminates many other wizarding areas. Death Eater activity was not limited to Hogwarts, as you may recall.”
Harry groaned helplessly, suddenly realizing they couldn’t perform a quick cleaning charm before drifting off to sleep. Unwilling as he was to let those vicious little hooks anywhere near his bits, the idea of forsaking the warm cocoon of blankets for the chill tiles of the bathroom was nearly as intolerable.
“I know I have no right to be upset,” Draco said, hardly seeming to notice Harry’s touch. “Madelyn is Maeve’s only family.”
As the kiss deepened, Harry slipped his hands beneath Draco’s shirt, fingers caressing the smooth skin over his spine. Draco lifted his arms, hips already moving in tiny thrusts, and Harry dragged the thin cotton over his head, tossing it aside before scrambling for the hem of his own shirt. Draco helped him tear it off, and then they were crashing back together, a desperate mess of hands and tongues and teeth.
“That’s it. That’s literally how we did it. I waved my wand around until Hermione told me the answer.” Harry’s tone was light, but Draco must have heard the thread of self-doubt beneath, because he dropped the sponge he was holding and came back to the table.
Harry remained standing, staring down at Draco’s body splayed over the smoky grey bedclothes. He was so beautiful – pale torso flushed pink, hair falling chaotically about his face, eyes rapidly darkening into a storm-tossed sea – that Harry was struck momentarily senseless.
Harry’s cock throbbed. The rush of heightened arousal was so immediate and so overwhelming that Harry would have fallen if weren’t for the wall behind him.
“Is that how you knew what to do?” Harry asked, eyes stubbornly fixed on the bookshelf across the room. He absently noted the yellowing leaves of the plant perched there and chided himself for forgetting to water it.
A third jab and Draco’s wrist flashed hotter still. It hurt, just for a second, like a stinging hex.
Draco chuckled, good humor at least partially restored by Maeve’s nonsense. He supposed the comment was slightly more relevant than
By the time Draco had dragged himself from the daydream, Harry was sitting at the table, cheerfully dicing butternut squash into perfectly sized chunks. Draco must have given him instructions automatically, without even realizing it. He shook his head, still feeling a bit dazed, and concentrated on slicing the onions and carrots.
“I know you do not think highly of the Ministry, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall cut in smoothly. She gave him a sharp look, and for a moment, Harry thought the statement a rebuke. But then McGonagall bared her teeth in a rather vicious grin, and Harry knew she was on his side. “For good reason,” she continued. “Rest assured, I have no intention of letting those goons run rampant at Hogwarts. A few discreet inquiries in the Department of Mysteries will serve us well.”
Luna released his hands and unwound one of her many scarves. It was a bright, cheerful red, with thin stripes of silver running through it.
Granger considered that, her eyes hardening for the space of a single breath. Then she nodded, accepting the truth of his words. The past flickered between them, acknowledged before being set aside. Draco felt his respect for her grow.
“I do know you,” Draco said fiercely, letting his head fall against Harry’s. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I never should have said that to you.”
Malfoy nodded. “All magic leaves traces – residue, if you will. And magic will always interact with other magic. We call that
“Sorry, Potter,” he drawled, laying the smugness on thick. “Tender declarations of feeling aren’t really my style.”
Ginny leapt to her feet, grabbing Harry’s hand to pull him up after her. With a finger to her lips, she led him slowly down the stairs and toward the kitchen door. Jostling each other for a good position, they leaned forward and surreptitiously peered around the doorframe.
Maeve paused meaningfully, and Draco shoved his hands into the dough, heart seeming to leap into his throat.
Neither spoke. Malfoy’s fingers twitched at his sides. Harry swallowed hard against the impulse to reach out and clasp Malfoy’s hands in his own.
Draco groaned, but Harry sprang up right away, dragging Draco after him. Maeve beamed at Harry, then chivvied them into their seats. She got her wand out again, and the others quieted instantly, clearly interested in whatever was coming next.
By Tuesday, Harry had even begun researching in class, book propped on his knees under the desk. The Arithmancy/Divination workshop proved impossible for him to follow – the professor claimed to be teaching them “predictive analytics,” which utilized common Arithmancy number sequences to… unveil prophetic patterns? Or something like that. Harry wasn’t sure what that meant, but after an entire day of trying to make sense of the professor’s graphs and charts, he recognized that working on the flower problem would be a better use of his time.
Harry nodded. “You can do anything you want to right now. And you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. Ok?”
Harry’s insides squirmed uncomfortably. He’d been avoiding the topic of Ginny with Draco, though he could not say why. Reluctantly, he nodded yes.
Malfoy was the only one (besides Hermione) who seemed to begin to actually understand the professor as the week went on. And then, he had started to respond to the questions addressed to Harry. Malfoy spoke up hesitantly at first, but with more and more confidence as Harry continued to encourage him.
“As for you, Mr. Potter, I will also have a position for you, whether you fill in that application or not.” She raised an eyebrow and Harry ducked his head sheepishly. He’d been avoiding discussing McGonagall’s suggestion that he become a teaching fellow for weeks now. But then the meaning of her words penetrated, and Harry’s head snapped back up.
Harry closed his eyes and was just beginning to think vague thoughts about bed, when Malfoy finally did speak.
Draco blinked down at Harry’s untidy scrawl. The ink was faded, but not enough to obscure the message.
Malfoy was shaking, and there was a glint in his eyes that could have been a sheen of tears. But when he turned and stalked away, his head was held high.
While he could have done without the week they spent on magical politics and international relations (the curriculum had felt irritatingly pure-blood, what with all the foreign etiquette they had to learn), last week’s unit on healing and basic magical remedies would certainly have eased some of the strain back when they were struggling through the woods.
Fists clenched, nails digging deeply into his palms, Harry managed to lean against the wardrobe and match Draco’s stillness. He wanted to rush over to him, cover him in kisses and breathe the fire back into him – but he knew better than to try. Draco’s shields were up, the icy façade firmly in place, and so Harry needed to wait for Draco to come to him.
It felt similar to the moment when Draco knew he had gotten Harry’s tea right, like Harry had pulled him right up against his chest, suffusing Draco in his scent. Leather, and sugar by the seaside, a waffle cone drizzled in chocolate, tempting the tastebuds away from the salty breeze.
Draco seemed to have recovered himself somewhat. He was smirking at Harry a bit too knowingly. “Are you
“Unless – you anchored the spell to the insulation aspect of the teapot,” he mused. “That which keeps something hot can easily be persuaded to keep something cold, and then –” Draco gasped. “Did you – did you use the teapot’s potential – the, the… echo? Of the boiling water? To – to create the potential for
The way most of their classmates subtly shrank back from Luna, Malfoy glaring daggers at them as they did.
“No,” Draco said adamantly. “Even the simplest potion feels brilliant right now. I don’t care if it takes me forever. I am so grateful just to be able to brew.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked hoarsely. He was pressing his fingers roughly against the label, as if he could absorb the ink into his skin, as if he needed to touch the words to make them real.
When Draco finally stilled, Harry came up behind him, pulling Draco against his chest and resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco whimpered, pressing closer to Harry. Every place they touched seemed to light up, as if magic was skating along their nerve endings, wrapping them in sunshine and wildflowers.
A crackling, buzzing gold, tracing a path like an arrow shot from Harry’s heart through Draco’s stomach.
“I know,” Harry said, as he returned to the sofa and sat down carefully next to Draco. “But I think you’re making a mistake.”
“Of course,” Harry said, knocking his foot against Draco’s beneath the table. This time, when he offered his hand, Draco accepted it, twining their fingers together. “Can I ask you something, though?”
remember?” He scrounged around the floor until he found his wand, then offered it to Draco. “Use a sustained
Malfoy started, as if he had just realized he was still hovering over Harry like a disapproving schoolmarm. He sank hastily to the ground, knocking his knee into Harry’s thigh. Malfoy looked horrified and scooted backward, hugging his arms to his chest and training his gaze on the far shore of the lake.
Harry folded back into himself, bowing under a rush of gratitude. Regretting his prickly manner, he cocked his head and gave Ron a tiny smile. “Thanks, Ron.”
“Well, I also told her I couldn’t wait another second to see you, and that I was really anxious to ask you on our first date.”
Rather uncharacteristically, Draco scuffed one of his shoes against the ground, but then he let out a sheepish huff and crooked a tiny smile at Harry.
Hermione nodded. “It’s hard to be sure – I had to track anecdotal evidence and things hidden in footnotes – but I suspect that people who owe life-debts are more likely to struggle with depression and anxiety.”
And then Harry leaned over Draco and brought his lips to the marred skin, fluttering tender kisses across the length of each and every scar.
Harry grasped Draco’s elbow and pulled him back. He cupped Draco’s chin and kissed him softly on the lips.
And then, as quickly as it began, it was over. Maeve folded her hands over her stomach, no longer touching the fuzzy lilac light.
Harry was tempted to follow Malfoy – to lean over him, push the hair out of his eyes, and run a thumb along his cheek.
He’d been rolling away from the hooks, fleeing to a space where the hooks were not. And where the hooks were not, he’d found – Draco!
“I’m not sure how to tell you this, darling,” Harry said, waggling his eyebrows at Draco, “but we’ve been living together for almost two months now.” He kissed Draco’s neck, nipping teasingly at the skin beneath his jaw.
“I’m fine, Professor,” Harry assured her, ignoring Draco grumbling obscenities at his side. He brushed some snow off his sleeves. “No harm done.”
Draco clutched onto Maeve, hands tangling in her apron strings as he sobbed against her shoulder. It hurt his back to hunch into her like this, but he didn’t care. The cloth of her purple dress was soft against his cheek and she smelled of raspberry jam and vanilla.
Draco could picture it – Harry breaking Lavender’s hold with the same deadly grace, the same intensity of purpose, as he had shown at the exhibition match.
On his way down the hallway toward the bathroom, Harry ran his fingers over the closed door of another room he hoped to renovate someday. His heart gave a little pang, the ache lingering as he stepped into the shower and began to scrub the sweat from his body.
Malfoy looked rather alarmed, but his expression quickly smoothed over. Without sparing Harry a second glance, he politely apologized to McGonagall and took a seat next to Luna at the back of the room.
“No, I know,” Harry backpedaled, feeling the nape of his neck heat. “That couldn’t be it. I just – don’t know what I did wrong.”
Draco’s entire body was on fire. He must be blushing down to his toes. “Can – can I make you waffles?” He knotted his hands into the sheets, before saying pathetically, “It’s late. You must be hungry.”
“What are all these books for?” he asked, noticing that several large textbooks had replaced the pile of Muggle novels by the bed.
Harry had dragged a faintly protesting Draco toward Diagon Alley, not because he had forgotten Draco’s avoidance of wizarding areas, but because the thought made him sad. The way Harry saw it, Draco’s self-imposed limits were a sort of inverse prison, and it was past time he broke out. Draco
Harry chuckled, not at all convinced that someone as posh as Draco needed to be schooled in manners. But he finished his tea and tarts obediently and showered Maeve with compliments before heading to Draco’s workshop.
Draco threw up his hands in exasperation. “It is a tricky bit of magic that has probably gone wrong somehow and I am going to unravel it, because magical theory is what I
Draco melted into him, but then he broke the kiss and leaned his forehead against Harry’s. “I love you, Harry. With all my heart. And I’m still not sure I deserve you, even now.” He took a deep breath. “But I need you to know - I intend to do everything in my power to earn your respect and your forgiveness.”
“At your event in Brixton, there were those children,” Draco recalled. “They did a demonstration, of sorts? No opponents, but they worked through a series of kicks and punches.”
Malfoy blinked once, looking almost dazed, then frowned at Harry. For a moment, Harry thought Malfoy was going to walk away, but instead Malfoy spoke. “Why did you ask me about it then?”
Draco settled himself in the water, arms propped on the lip of the tub. His eyes scanned over Harry’s still fully clothed body and he arched a regal brow. His tongue darted out to wet his lips as he beckoned Harry toward him.
“This must be a type of magic we haven’t studied,” Malfoy mused. “You could tell that my spell was likely Transfiguration because you’ve learned Transfiguration. You understand it.”
Draco rolled his eyes and gave Harry a playful shove. “If you must know, there’s a tea of mine that Blaise especially likes. It’s very intricate, so I hardly ever make it, but I, erm –” Draco busied himself with straightening out the bedclothes – “invented it for him. It tastes the way our friendship feels.”
Malfoy flushed deeply, and averted his eyes. He pulled his hand from Harry’s and scooted backward toward the head of the bed. He poked around his pillows and emerged with his wand, already casting something toward the lab table.
“Yes, of course I do,” Harry said, his response immediate and emphatic. He rubbed the back of his neck and smiled a bit wryly. How had he managed to forget what it was like talking to Luna? She was like an infusion of Veritaserum, though thankfully, she was about a thousand times more comforting.
“I won’t promise you that we’ll be together forever,” Harry said, heeding his gut instinct, “because I know we can’t control everything that happens.”
Draco blinked at him. Harry raised his eyebrows and glanced pointedly at the blanket on the sofa, gesturing with his chin between it and Draco. Looking mildly put out, Draco draped the blanket over himself and lay down. He was a stiff lump of discomfort, eyes still stubbornly burning into Harry.
Luna nodded solemnly. “On his face. And one time, a split lip. He usually stayed longer with me on days the bruises were fresh. He never talked about it, but he’d sit by the bars and let me hold his hand. I told him about all the magical creatures I could see in his basement, and all the ones I wanted to find out in the world someday, and he told me about the properties of plants.”
Harry’s pulse jumped. He tugged at the hem of his jumper and shifted his weight awkwardly. Malfoy’s back was to him, shoulders tense, and he was scribbling complex notations into a large book. Harry could make out a few numbers, as well as long lines of unfamiliar symbols.
Expression stunned, Draco didn’t respond, but Harry noticed his hands trembling. He took the application from Draco and tucked it back inside the desk drawer.
He hung his head over the desk, stunned by the loss of urgency that had occurred without his notice. When they had first discovered their mysterious connection, Draco had felt it like a shackle. It had loomed over him, constantly threatening the tidy life he had built for himself in the aftermath of the war. But he’d let his guard down, stopped researching just like Maeve had suggested, without even consciously realizing it. He and Harry had both been behaving as if the apparition was of no consequence, as if they were actually a part of each other’s lives.
“Harry,” Draco corrected automatically, then flushed. He bit his lip and averted his eyes. A thousand tiny Dracos grimaced at him from the erratic placement of mirrors on the wall.
Harry had seen that look on Malfoy before, had seen him sparkling with questions as he trailed questing fingers over mysterious flowers. That night in the courtyard, Harry had seen beauty in Malfoy for the first time, and it had stirred something in his soul. Harry had thought he’d understood then, exactly how much Draco Malfoy’s intellect could move him, but in reality, he was entirely unprepared for what it would mean when those sharp grey eyes finally turned to him.
was a touch dramatic. More likely he’d throw down the spatula and pout. Though he was sure Maeve would sweep in and rescue him before anything got that dire. She was busying herself cleaning crumbs out of the display cases, but Draco was not fooled. Maeve may not be looking at him, but she didn’t miss a trick in this kitchen. Draco’s scalp prickled under the intensity of her attention, as she observed and weighed every twitch of his fingers.
Harry sat, feeling encouraged by the “just yet” part, even if he wasn’t entirely sure why. Did he want to talk to Malfoy? He shook his head, reminding himself that he wasn’t thinking about it.
As Harry, Draco, and Headmistress McGonagall hurried toward the castle, Draco making pained, choked noises and Harry with a steadying grip on his elbow – a change came over the clearing they had so thoroughly saturated with Dark Magic.
A beaming Molly carried in the roast then, and as Harry pulled out a chair for Draco, the overheard argument suddenly seemed a lot less important.
“These can’t be real,” Harry said, giving up when the words began to blur together. His brow furrowed as he stared across the kitchen suspiciously. “Draco, did you – did you make
Harry sighed and turned back to Blaise, who seemed to be examining the knickknacks on a nearby shelf. He was as suave and sophisticated as Harry remembered, but something about the way he was studying the shelf belied his apparent ease. He was too intent, too focused – his eyes a fixed point, not moving at all. Harry wondered if he should say something about Ginny, tell Blaise he wasn’t upset they were together, but he wasn’t sure how to bring it up.
