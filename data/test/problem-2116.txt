"Kind of leaves a mark when one is of old age, especially when waking to the chill of early morning Scottish weather" he muttered to himself absently in the gloom, his face etched with the wrinkles and lines only those past 100 could gain as well as slightly gaunt from sleep deprivation, seemingly drenched in various patches of dried purple ink, thanks to a certain ink palette his face fell on sometime in the night.
Peverell Vault: 700,200 Galleons, 20 Sicles and 70 Knuts (Unlockable), 300 artifacts and 50 rare tomes remaining.
After snatching it up to examine the rude request he gasped and rushed to his store room to find the appropriate potions, 'Lily is going to have an heir to the vile Potter line? if it has contracted that bastards' vampirism, I will butcher him for potions ingredients regardless of if I get sent to Azkaban for the deed, no child of her's should have to deal with the scrutiny despite it being a Potter' "I will be there momentarily Fawkes go back to the office if you must".
He walked down the dungeon corridor and turned right, into his private lab and placed the contents in his arms on the stone table in the middle of the room, beside the simmering cauldron he had planned to use for the potion.
Before the occupants can move I smoothly point at each of them and murmur "Obliviate" 'even if I may have no inclination of joining yet no one can know of our sudden recruitment meeting' I think to myself in some satisfaction.
"Albus and Severus hold a vast knowledge and positions high enough to take care of such a child though I wish to escort you back up to your office and talk to Auror Black myself and also request to see the child myself to do a full risk assessment, given I am aware of the adoption rituals backlash of turning the sire into a half blooded creature, if the child is one so I will ask to also be present with two of my staff on hand as well when it is pushed through, we will go back up in a few moments I must send a memo to my staff about this before I meet with Sirius" he said as he smiled and penned a note to his subordinates, requesting a meeting in two hours to determine the risks after he visited young Mr Potter.
"Well I expected that, Crucio!" Voldemort said as Blaise started convulsing on the bed and screaming in pain, "I trust the Goblins put a type of bond on you and Harry? It would explain how you knew where to open the portal given we had not given you the specific location of Draco's room" Voldemort said as his gaze switched to Osiris who's purple orbs changed abruptly from malicious glee to outright fear and also barely disguised anger.

Harry took the dagger and slit his palm slightly with the edge of the blade, allowing a few drops to spill on the parchment, it glowed blue for a moment before words appeared.
is sitting in Harry’s stomach, eating away at the lining.
“No worries, Potter.”
“What- I can’t just-”
“You knocked?” Now Harry feels bad. “We’re fine here, thanks, Dave.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “No, Potter, I did not
“She looks great, Mrs. Harris. Call Dave to schedule her next appointment- this time next year would be good.”
Draco, who was bobbing in the water, gasping for air. Harry swam as fast as he could, making quick strokes through the water. Draco’s head dipped under and back up, and Harry’s heart left his body.
“I thought you hated me.”
“When do you feel happiest? Remember, no context.”
After three right turns, Harry could see Draco’s blond hair from Gilbertson’s doorway.
“Um, hi,” Harry says. Draco looks up, cheeks pink.
“Were you checking me out, Potter?”
“Of course I’ll help,” Harry replies. He chose this career so he could help. “No one’s in right now, come, follow me.”
Draco flushes. “Go fuck yourself, Potter,” he snaps, even though Potter’s looking like he just killed Draco’s dog and Draco
Rather than the typical tinge of pink, Malfoy’s cheeks turn a burning, bright red. “Well, I- How dare you accuse me of- As if I wasn’t-” Malfoy splutters some more and Harry realizes: Malfoy’s self-conscious.
And the game continues. They go back and forth, laughing at each other, but Draco can’t seem to focus anymore. Until Potter’s name is called.
this articulate?”
Draco cracks a laugh when Harry mentions the Noods. The waitress brings over their lunch, and they chat about the snakes, and what Harry’s going to name his new practice, and Harry tries to ignore how his heart feels in his chest every time Draco smiles at him.
“Fine. Get in.”
Malfoy tilts his head, considering. “Okay,” he says, apparently approving. He puts the snake down on Harry’s table and lets him begin the exam.
“Dave’s a college student,” Harry explains. “He could really use the extra money.”
“Where else are you hurt?”
“As we promised Healer Vincent,” Granger begins, “we will still be getting to know each other and playing games. The first one for today is called Simon Says. It’s actually a Muggle game-”
“According to the poster in the office, yeah. You took your sweet time going through the Floo.”
When he wakes up the next morning, Potter is gone.
Draco’s face immediately shuts. “What, just like that? You just, don’t like me anymore?”
“Yeah. Thanks.” And maybe that was why Harry had gotten nervous about bringing the subject up to Hermione: he’s known her and Ron for so long that the prospect of them changing the way they think about him is… terrifying. He knows Malfoy, but they have little history besides being childhood rivals, and having Malfoy think about him in a new way is much more palatable.
“Oooh, and who proposed to who!” Luna exclaimed.
“How’d you end up working with snakes, anyways?”
“Well, I was going to shower!”
“Potter, honestly, what the fuck-”
“Yeah. I was going to a Mind Healer, and she thought it could potentially get better, but I didn’t want to have to deal with… facing that. Eventually realised I’d become an Auror because I thought I should, not necessarily because I really wanted to be one.”
“Why?”
“Draco,” he slurs.
“Why are you staring at my tattoos?” Malfoy sounds amused.
Malfoy smiled in surprise. “I am, actually, yes. I—”
“That’s what I thought.”
“Molly was talking to me about her friend who got us the tickets,” Malfoy snapped. “Potter, listen to me. I’m only going to say this once.
And for some reason, that put a lump in Draco’s throat. “That’s — that’s very kind of you, thank you. I’m sure we’d love to visit.”
And Draco asked for it, but his cheeks still flush, much to Harry’s delight.
does not. I mean, what did I do to offend him? Is it the tattoos? Am I matching too well? On that note, I must add, the fact that I was able to match even these dreadful Muggle clothes only goes to show my incredible taste. Is that it, Potter? Is my taste too good? Has my taste offended him?”
It’s about three in the morning and Draco hasn’t been able to sleep at all. It’s like that sometimes. He just thinks and thinks and thinks and before he knows it, it’s morning. Tonight, Draco’s stomach is grumbling and he decides to grab a snack from the kitchens. He quietly gets out of bed and makes his way through the dimly lit common room towards the door. He’s creeping past one of the larger sofas when he trips over something big. And hard.
Malfoy just gave a polite nod, looking somehow even paler than before. He took a seat at the table, and Harry followed.
“I know!” Peter grinned. “Well, I’ll leave you two alone to enjoy.”
Harry’s face must betray him, because now Draco’s face is full of concern. “What’s wrong?”
“Night, Malfoy.”
Since the night Malfoy had tripped over him, Harry finds Malfoy in the common room every night.
Padma orders them a round of tequila shots, which quickly turns into two rounds, then four, and Harry loses count.
Betsy steps up to the microphone again. “Alright folks, last question. You’re allowed to give a bit longer of an answer. How did your parents contribute to your education?”
“Were you?”
Draco closes the distance between them, pushing the plates onto the floor and climbing over the table into Harry’s lap. They don’t make it upstairs.
“Potter, get out of my office,” Gilbertson snapped.
, showing up here, did he?
“It appears Patil would like to work with other people.” Malfoy's voice is sarcastic.
Draco’s mouth twitches. “How disappointing,” he says. “You certainly aren’t implying that sex is for upstairs only?”
“I love you,” you say out loud.
. It’s… pleasant. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever heard Malfoy laugh like that before. And he can’t help but smile back at him as they pull themselves up.
Malfoy’s staring at him, grey eyes wide in shock. And then – he laughs. He laughs
But it certainly changes things in the group, as people notice Harry’s finger of confession.
“Of course, of course, you’re going to love it.” She held out the jar of Floo powder towards them. “Now, you’ll want to say
“Oh,” they say out loud. “That was thoughtful of you.”
“Well, I’m sure you’ll want to visit your mother. But every year, we have a nice dinner with just the family — Arthur and I, and the kids and their partners. Harry’s always invited, and of course you are too now, you’re part of the family! Isn’t that right, Ginny?”
“Great. Good for you.”
They’ve ended up playing Truth or Dare, which was inevitable, really. They always end up playing it at some point during these socials. Pansy usually starts it. She and Granger have unofficially become the leaders of the eighth year group, and they’ve become close friends, too. He never would have imagined.
Harry’s trying to remember the details now. He had only been open a week, and was slowly getting new clients. He hadn’t hired Dave yet and was working his own reception. Malfoy came in… Harry didn’t think he had a snake with him, but he left so quickly Harry wasn’t certain.
“It’s a rather embarrassing story. So anyways, after I left Hogwarts-”
Harry shows Malfoy where the skin is, so he can keep an eye on it. “If it’s not gone in the next few days, let me know.”
“I am not getting on that boat.”
“You know how rich people get,” he says. “Eccentricity, and all that. I’ll be in my office, give me a holler when the first patient arrives.”
“Potter,” he says again, but softly this time. “Why are you on the floor?”
“Are you kidding me, Potter? You can’t even walk straight?”
Harry cringes. “Sorry, just trying to make things more comfortable–”
Draco goes out to grab them dinner after the opening, and when he comes back he’s holding a bright orange snake and no food. “I found him by the Leaky,” he tells Harry, worried. “Do you think he’s okay?”
Harry needed to kiss him. But that was definitely not okay. He needed to do something platonic, to show he was not obsessed.
,” Draco snapped. “Do go on, Harry.”
Draco looks to Gertrude, who’s staring at them.
them to be dates-”
Harry’s starting to realize that he doesn’t stand a chance. He’s well and truly fucked. He’s falling for Draco Malfoy, of all people. The one person he can never have. But they’re civil, they’re even- friends, he thinks, and it’s the most he could hope for.
“Blaise,” he says, pulling his sleeve down and trying to keep his voice smooth. “Truth or dare?”
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” Hermione says. “We thought you moping around was because you had finally figured out that you like boys.”
“No problem,” Potter replied, smirking at Draco. Draco sighed in resignation, then turned to give Molly another forced smile.
“Well, here they are,” Harry said, breathless, hearing how stupid his words sounded. “You should take advantage.”
He does
“I’m saying, the only reason he would have done that is if he cared about you. He obviously likes you
“Good evening, Harry.” His smile when he faces Harry is soft. “Granger, Weasley, nice to see you.”
“The absolute- now,
He looks at the note first.
Malfoy sticks his nose up. “I’d like to think my sensibilities have matured slightly since my school years.”
He takes Bertha and Apparates out of the clinic. It takes some time for Harry to convince Dave that he left out the back emergency exit.
That Monday is hell.
“Richards is down. Johnson and Maynard got away, as far as I know. We’ll have to start from scratch on the case.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry answers, surprised. “They’ve got loads to say. Why?”
Harry was on the floor. He jumped up, threw his pillow on the bed, and bunched up his blankets in his arms.
“And you can’t call me Potter. We’re engaged.” Potter said, then winced as he added, “Draco.”
“What? Why?”
And even gentler, as if she’s going to break him by saying the words, Hermione says, “And now you’ve kissed Malfoy, and you laid in bed for three days refusing to talk to anyone.”
interested in Muggle magic culture.”
“Probably a few times as a child, but I don’t remember it.”
No one says anything about them after that.
* * *
After taking furious notes, Harry finishes up the exam and walks Malfoy back up to the lobby. Malfoy stops at Dave’s desk, and to Harry’s surprise, pulls out a hefty wad of Muggle cash. Dave looks mildly alarmed, but lets Malfoy know how much he owes.
, Potter, what is wrong with you?”
“Painless, is it?” Malfoy leaned forward dramatically. “It may have been painless for you to watch me on Veritaserum during my trial, but
“I’ve been thinking, and… I’m going to start another practice, in the Wizarding world. For magical snakes.”
They’ve been dating for six months when Harry’s new clinic opens. He passed his exams with flying colors, earning his Veterinary Healer certification.
“Thank you for coming, Mr Potter,” Chief Warlock Grimsworth said. “Mr Malfoy has been given a sentence of exile from Britain. However, he has invoked Wilkie’s Law, which states that defendants married to upstanding citizens of this country may not be forcibly removed.
“For you,” they reply. “I’m really sorry, Draco–”
Draco just snorts.
? The absolute
“Harry…” Hermione crosses the room and sits next to Harry. “It’s Malfoy.”
The first social comes just a few weeks into school. Harry isn't sure what he was expecting, but he certainly wasn't expecting the Great Hall to be turned into a Muggle-style high school cafeteria, around ten students per table. It looks like Vince has assigned everyone seats such that each table only has students from the same year, but includes a mix of houses. Harry, Ron, and Hermione head to the back of the hall, where it looks like the older students are sitting.
“I suppose I could accommodate that,” Draco replied, mouth twitching.
Potter finally makes it back, holding two glasses of pumpkin juice. Draco takes his glass, but doesn’t drink it.
“So, your aunt and uncle were rubbish, then?” Malfoy’s voice comes out of the darkness.
“It’s not?”
were you thinking?”
“‘As a war orphan myself’ - you’re terribly right, Potter, I
“Mmm. I like you.” Harry smiles up at him. Maybe they’re more than tipsy.
He leaned over to look at the clock, his hand landing on a piece of paper. It wasn’t even 8 a.m. Harry picked up the paper, grabbed his glasses, and read.
Draco looks shocked. He takes Harry’s arms, and moves them away from his face. “Harry, what do you think we’ve been doing?”
“Sesame seeds, and the entire spectrum of human emotion.”
“So, I’ve got some news,” Harry starts.
“Will you do it?” they slur to Draco, who takes out his wand.
He stops by Gringotts on his way into the clinic and converts the money to pounds. He splits it into two stacks. Dave’s already in when he arrives, but there aren’t any appointments for another hour. He hands Dave the first stack of pounds for payment of Malfoy’s two visits, and waits as Dave enters it into their records.
Malfoy’s just admitted to being gay. Or bi. Or whatever. He likes men. He’s attracted to men. Should Harry put a finger down? So Malfoy knows he likes men? But then everyone would know. And Harry definitely has
They’re turning into Hogsmeade now. None of the shops are open but a few early birds are out walking dogs. No one seems to notice them.
“Yes, well, tell anyone and I’ll curse you, and all that,” Harry replies sheepishly.
They stay like that for a while.
And it’s Friday. Harry’s considering leaving early himself. “No problem, Dave. Have a good weekend.”
Harry turns his head to find Malfoy laying on his side, looking at Harry. It’s too dark to read his expression, but he seems relaxed. Comfortable.
“Malfoy, what’s wrong? Is everything okay?” And how is Draco supposed to reply to that? He tries to scoff but it comes out as more of a cough. They sit in silence as the band plays on, Potter sipping his juice and glancing at Draco every few seconds. Students have started to trickle out of the Great Hall, but it’s still pretty full.
“She said no context given,” Harry replies easily. “Why are you a teacher?”
Harry pauses. Because, well, fuck.
The castle created a new common room with attached bedrooms for the eighth years as soon as it heard the news they'd be returning. Two per room, which is nice for privacy. It seems they've laid out the room assignments so that people are mostly with their houses, but there was some overlap. Pansy, for example, is rooming with Granger.
“Arthur here seems to think you just made up this engagement so Malfoy won’t get sent away. Is he right?”
Malfoy smiles sheepishly. “Glad you enjoy her sense of humor.”
Friday night dinners are Harry’s favorite time of the week. They rotate between Grimmauld Place and Hermione and Ron’s London flat, and it’s really the only time he gets to see his two best friends. Harry usually prefers the flat, with its organized chaos and toys strewn about. Harry’s spent so much time fixing up Grimmauld, and he’s proud of what it’s become, but it’s so… big. Empty.
Draco stops in his tracks. He turns around.
“Ah, of course Harry proposed.” Molly settled herself down on a couch. “Now, Harry, how’d you do it? Was it romantic?”
“I just…” Harry rubs at his face. “I don’t know if we should keep doing these lunches,” he gets out.
“I’m investigating your engagement. You know this, Potter.”
know. That first day, Harry had told him he was a vet for Muggles, that he had never worked with magical snakes before. So Malfoy definitely knows. And of course Harry wants to help his snakes, especially if the Wizarding vets refused him service, but. Well. Malfoy didn’t have to act like it was
, Harry, you can’t just
“So what’s partnering up with Malfoy like?” Ron asks through a mouthful of bread.
Harry doesn’t wait for him to finish. He grabs Draco’s hair and pulls him in and kisses him, and Draco grabs Harry right back, nestling one hand in the back of Harry’s shirt and the other around his neck. The kiss is warm, and sweet, until Draco
“Look, I got them to agree on something! And you said it couldn’t be done.” Golstein is grinning, and Draco’s remembering the fight they had before entering the common room. Just a bet is all. Draco heaves a sigh of relief. They won’t actually make Potter kiss him.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Glad we’ve got that cleared up. Anything else you’d like to discuss? Didn’t know you were a heart-to-heart at midnight kind of guy, but I’m glad you let me know.”
Harry’s eyebrows raise. “Snake charming?”
“Yes, that’s what Harry said too.” Molly looked thoughtful. “Hmm. What if you two got married at the Burrow? It could be a small event, nothing too much, but that way it’s a little bit more special for the two of you than just paperwork?”
“Remember, hold that eye contact,” Betsy says from her spot on the podium. “We want you to dive in deep,
Lord to:
Sonia walked briskly towards the lift grates at the end of the corridor as they slid open to reveal Madam Umbridge in her usual obnoxiously pink robes, before she could pass her by hoping not to be caught in conversation with them woman, Dolores tapped her on the arm with a simple "Heh hem" trying to gain her attention, 'What does this woman need from me?' Sonia thought in frustration, she made eye contact despite this, offered a polite smile with her eyebrows raised in question.
"I understand, sorry this door is just brimming with power was hard to unconsciously resist trying to touch it" Harry replied in a slight daze, the goblins marched over with Griphook at the lead, he stroaked one gnarled finger over the centre rune before a faint glow and a muffled click could be heard.
Cousin: Draconis Lucien Malfoy (Alive)
Uncle: Ted Tonks (Alive)
"You are correct, he is asking for a legal guardian by the name of Severus Snape to be documented along with being stationed as a ward of the school under Albus Dumbledore" she nodded.
Loyalty Potion tied to Molly Weasley, Ron Weasley and Albus Dumbledore,
Severus stood in his store cupboard rummaging through his stores to find the specific ingredients for the Adoption Ritual potion he needed to brew before the idiot Black came back from the ministry "Half a gram of Dragons' Heart String, a pinch of Asphodel, Flobberworm Pus, Diced Scarab, a litre of Moonshine and an ounce of Gurdyroot to ward against the acidic toxins, all that is left will be the final ingredients of mixed blood" he said as he gathered each ingredient before heading to his private potion lab 'before any of the obnoxious children see him' he thought with a sneer.
"That's Kiss worthy offences of possible child endangerment and misuse of authority at the very least if she is convicted, which given I knew both you and Auror Black was waiting for us in my office gives enough official evidence to the thought, did she manage to even get in the room before you got her? She can't know the information without authorisation, which I actually told her before I went to collect Dedalus!" She spat.
He quickly found himself at the end of the alley and walking up the steps to the Remus and Pettigrew residence, he knocked briskly and waited for a sign of movement within the dwelling, after a moment he could hear subtle shuffling towards the entrance and muffled "hold on whoever you are!", as the knob turned and the door was wrenched open slightly to reveal Remus looking haggard.
"You are aware the Potter's have just died leaving the son an orphan under my guardianship and I believe it is best to transfer it as well as the vault access to people more suited to take care of the child, do you not?" He sneered, Ragnok brought the tips of his hands together "I am aware, who would be needing access to the Potter Vaults?" He eyed Sirius with a scowl of his own, "Severus Snape is to be the Guardian, he will be going through a blood adoption ceremony tonight and Hogwarts will also gain custody of him as a ward of the school so both will need full access however give Hogwarts only restricted access only to Tuition fees and Board, I do not want Albus Dumbledore abusing his position in this!" Sirius said angrily, "This will be arranged, an owl will be sent to each respecting party once the ministry has confirmed the change however here is a temporary Vault key to Harry Potter's private vault until he is of age to have his full access, please present this to Mr Snape as proof of this meeting as we can not give written ascent until the ministry is notified and has approved" Ragnok held a key in his outstretched hand to Sirius, who took it as he nodded, as he walked to the door however Ragnok smirked and spoke again "We are also aware of the nature of his birth, it was foretold within the Fae courts despite their rejection of his kind, it looks like Lord Potter and Severus Snape will soon be hunted if this happens as you say tonight, the vampires do not forgive turning Humans after all, no matter the circumstance nor will the ministry remain silent when you tell them" he chuckled darkly at the thought before walking past Sirius who just stood their in fear and astonishment 'how I never told them of Harry! What is he to them?' He thought darkly as he walked out of the bank and disapperated to the ministry visitors entrance.
As Harry walked off the bus, he quickly scanned the street for muggles looking his way, thankfully the muggle repelling charms on the Leaky and Knight Bus shielded him and his floating trunk from direct view.
Blaise immediately stunned and bound Osiris as instructed, before casting "Locamotor Mortis!" And dragging the thieving Dark Elf deeper into the Manor, towards the Dungeons with two Death Eaters flanking him either side as he walked off, leaving Draco to spell Harry up to his room and settle him into the sheets until he awoke again.
Molly reacted first though "How dare you promise me his riches and a marriage to Ginny to play us like this! How dare you go back on your words! We fed him those potions so it would do that for us!" And then stopped herself in mid accidental rant aware they weren't alone, the others blinked stupidly at both her and Arthur and Ginny who was openly scowling, her plans being ruined along with Ron and Hermione's unbeknownst to the others.
Sirius was taken aback, he thought Molly Weasley was a lovely motherly woman, they were friends throughout the last war for Merlin's sake, he stood up, pulled out his wand and banished all three of them outside his house, them landing hard in the square outside.
Sirius breathed another sigh of frustration before walking in and towards the shortest line present to see one of the bank administrators, all of who sat atop their high back podiums, along the walls of the room, either weighing and checking item value, scratching reports or conversing with their customers lined before them.
Godfather: Sirius Orion Black-Lupin (Alive, In Hiding)
~July 30th, 1995 two minutes to midnight, Privet Drive~
Sirius kissed his head and said softly "Don't worry heaven and earth will not stop us from finding him, I'm sure Albus made a fail safe to find the boy, he might even have a vial of blood to use as an anchor for location spells in case this happened we know the bastard has always been crafty and thinks many steps ahead until today when this caught all of us off guard!" He squeezed his mate softly in reassurance before turning and bolting down the stairs towards the kitchen.
"On second thought, I best check the student's before I start this, they had best not have blown up anything with their poor excuse for potion making!" He said and turned behind him to the bookcase, he paused for a moment and deftly attempted to pluck the book titled 'Darkest Arts Of The Mind by Michael Ainsworth' out from its' careful placement along the shelf, however as he pulled it loose a click could be heard and the section of the wall and case gave way to reveal a hidden passage behind it, smirking to himself Severus strolled into the gloom towards his class room's secret vantage point, he only used this at times when he was too busy with volatile ingredients to supervise his seventh years therefore his attention was needed elsewhere, under the guise of self study sessions he would walk through this passage and spy on the students to make sure they didn't blow anything up in his absence.
Voldemort stood in his long black silk robes surveying his grovelling servants in Riddle Manor. "Brother'ss and ssisterss it sseems our ssearch for the Potter brat is over, Wormtail proved useful after all" his piercing glare fell upon Wormtail twitching on the ground at his feet. "Thisss iss truly good newss, I will go myself to end their blood traitor line, I will never fall to thisss child, the light will lose this war and Dumbledore" he spat the name venomously "will fall in the wake of the end of this child of prophecy, they will lose everything" he ended in a whisper, the Death Eaters knew not to speak out directly and only gave nods of approval and grins at their master's jubilation.
Which apparently, according to the Goblins, was called a Somnum Exterreri Solebat Duplici or Nightmare Double, a liquid based magical creature that can take on the shapes of what it consumes usually found as a nasty trap in dark wizard tombs, kind of like a really evil Slime monster from Harry's favourite fantasy novels.
"Interesting he seems to have taken on the characteristics of Dark Elves like his companion here, the boy has rune patterns that are brimming with untapped power, from what I can see these patterns improve his magical control, some are even elemental based, I have never seen them on common creatures so he must have found something powerful, what truly intrigues me is the golden glowing Deathly Hallows sign on his chest, that is the mark of a Higher Necromancer and of the house of Peverell no less, he will be a true asset to our side if his talent is cultivated, assuring his allegiance is paramount but first I must assess the circumstances, chain the Elf here in the dungeons with the other prisoners I wish to interrogate him more thoroughly, his resistance is impressive, contact Severus and bring him to my room's young Blaise, Draco take your new partner to your rooms and inform me of when he wakes, dismissed!" Voldemort intoned darkly before walking back up the stairs and out of sight.
New spells to note:
As he strained for a moment he could detect snatches of the various conversations going on in his absence among the seventh years, steam rising steadily from their cauldrons gently obscuring their features as they steadily stirred and added ingredients or stood scratching their heads buried in a potions book.
"Well this is surprising I own a quarter of Hogwarts like Tom does, maybe if we find the others we can remodel the classes" Harry laughs disparagingly, seeing just how well off he actually was.
Dolores looked slightly shocked at this rude reply before she purpled up in suppressed indignation "Now see here I am the senior undersecretary! you know the dangers of such a thing being left on it's own even under the proper guidance!" She sneered the last part with a deep ugly scowl.
As Draco blinked in surprise and heavy concern at seeing Harry unconscious in the arms of some other random Dark Creature, Tom Riddle moved swiftly down the stairs, clearly having felt the enormous pressure Harry exuded even unconsciously, all Draco could think was 'What The Fuck Was That!' As he too rushed down to grab Harry out of the things arms and cuddle him close.
"You see headmaster, we of young Harry's lineage gain control of the elements and of wandless magick quite early on our only issue is birth rate is lower in our races, the gods put at us at the top but at a price of less young, he will be more talented at most given how quick he is displaying and we will not have you meddle in his destiny, if we catch you.. let's just say there's more to worry than a Dementor's Kiss or the magical sealing curse the Wizengamot is known to use as punishment for you wizard's" Flora said quietly as she turned to eye all the occupants looks of shock.
I try to bolt for my bedroom to retrieve my wand but before I can get past the cupboard under the stairs Dudley trips me, making me fall flat on my face in the hallway, Vernon closed in and swiftly kicked me in the side as I tried to get up, I heard bone's snap and got hard to breath as I simultaneously spat blood on to the carpet and cry out in pain, I think 'he punctured my lung with that kick shit!' All kinds of alarm bells were ringing in my ears as Vernon took off my Jean's..
"Today we will be making a simple draught to cure boils, instructions are on the board, pay heed to the steps if you misstep and create a poison, instead of antidote, I will be testing the failures on your precious pets" he said coldly to the room at large who couldn't help but gasp as he smiled grimly at their discomfort.
Murmurs rose around the Great Hall as Severus purposely strode up towards the high table, locking eyes with a scowl at Dumbledore, who's deep blue eyes merely twinkled rapidly at his potion masters approach.
"Oh look mother, the headmasters here to catch his runaway Golden boy" Draco muttered to Narcissa, who narrowed her eyes calculatively before they disappeared, inside however he was feeling very antsy at seeing Dumbledore, 'What if he took my Harry away before I even got to be with him, he wouldn't let the son of a Death Eater close to his precious Golden boy nor would Harry's friends, I hope he keeps his promise' "come back quickly Harry" he muttered under his breath as they appeared in the Manor's receiving room, House Elf's popping in to welcome their master's back.
Grandmother: Druella Rosier-Black (Deceased, 1965)
"Guess we will find out how much shit I am in at Gringotts, speaking of which.." the bus stopped and opened "The Leaky Cauldron, Harry this is your stop!" Stan says jubilantly remembering the last time Harry was on, "Thanks" I mutter as I rise and tap my trunk and follow out the door with the trunk floating behind me 'note to self wordless is another ability I have seemed to awoken'.
He couldn't allow the old man to play tricks with his family even if it was for the greater good, he wished nothing more than to rely on him as less as he could though it was still more or less their life in his hands being the only one strong enough to cast their estate into fidelius, he was starting to doubt even Peter was the correct choice if it weren't for Sirius's askance to change he wouldn't have.
To Like Molly Weasley,
"Well Lil's I could sniff him out either way.." she hurled a pillow at him over that "James if I can't find him, I will hex you into oblivion! even if you can regenerate most mortal wounds, I will use you as a fucking target dummy!" Lily shouted and then placed her hand over her mouth in horror.
Lily woke late into the morning, aching between her legs and stomach, a reminder that just last night her Harry was born, if not for the rougish smile in the door way facing her and the soft giggle and babbling next to her, as Harry kept trying to climb all over her face and smacking her with his little black wings.
Albus himself was positively livid despite his calm but dark mask displayed 'how dare this creature think he is powerful enough to threaten me' he thought though settled for "Sir Ragnok, this is about the matter of Harry Potter, we recieved word he was being seen held floating at wand point after entering your establishment and has been taken to a ritual room, we insist you hand him over to us we will help him with what ever he may need, it is not your issue to bare".
Most laughed disdainfully at the non human bound or ignored his struggling completely as if he didn't exist though when they glanced and saw Harry Potter floating at wand point whispers and murmurs erupted, increasing in volume rapidly as more and more clients started to notice and point their way.
"Plenam Pecunia Solvere! You left me no choice but to do that whilst I explain!" He snapped as the visceral silver binding shot out of his wand encasing Harry and Remus in the chair they sat in, Remus could only whimper as the silver rubbed tightly and dug in to still fresh wound on his aching body, Harry awoke in a strangled cry as the bindings covered the boy.
"Blaise I trust Osiris is held in the dungeon? And that you used the correct cuffs to chain him? If not you will be punished should he portal here" Voldemort said crimson eyes trained on him with a strongly questioning gaze.
"Headmaster, I had just finished my nights' rounds and had returned to my quarters to indulge in some wine and work on a new project I have undertaken for the benefactor you already know of" he said with sharp nod and quick meaningful glance at Albus who nodded and gestured for him to continue
What do you think of Snarky Snape fathering Harry?
Birth Certificate:
Blaise looked on in interest at this and then whistled lowly before outright laughing at what happened to Pansy, Harry managed to get his urge under control as he sat down beside his mate and asked "Draco you have a choice in this will you accept me as your mate? I understand you may have already had partners and I respect that but my instincts are shouting to make you my one and only now that I am a creature and no longer a wizard, I realise we got off on the wrong foot all those years ago in first year but it means very little to me now, I am willing to be way more than the friendship you once offered, are you?" His eyes boring into Draco's looking for the acceptance he craves.
(See the end of the chapter for
Yours Respectfully,
He inhaled her scent briefly for a minute before turning sharply to shake her awake "Lily my sweet I believe the baby is coming!", she began to moan slightly in her sleep and then shot bolt up right screaming, she was going into labour, the blood pooled between her legs rapidly as she started to shake violently, fighting off the waves of painful contractions.
A resounding crack could be heard as numerous witches and wizards burst through the entry hall of Gringotts, Albus Dumbledore apparently at the lead if they heard rightly from his booming voice carrying all the way to the still open ritual room door at the far end of the hall.
"Remus, he is a danger to others and himself, if someone got wind of him and his powers and tried to take him from us, before he has the ability to understand and protect himself, surely it is right to douse his signature and inhuman features? Do you want someone like Greyback trying to kill him? As I assure you, he will, just for killing his master! Let alone because he is a baby and is of the vampire race! Your sworn enemies by default!" Albus said in exasperation.
"Please put on the rings of your house's Lord Potter and then we shall leave for the Ritual to remove your blocks and go select some Dark Creatures for you to feed on, you also have to realise this ceremony will hurt a lot, removing blocks is no small thing and putting them on is potentially lethal to a person let alone a child".
"I'm sorry but you have trespassed mrs?" Dumbledore began before being lifted bodily by the Lich, "Heh you think a wizard can out rank us regardless of their achievements? You think you can decide the life of one of our own without a member of the council here to witness and approve? You are arrogant for a human with such knowledge behind those occlumancy shields, yes I can see everything and if you do what you have planned you will pay more than a life in repentance!" It said placing him back down on his feet, "The boy, our little Harry has nothing to fear from Sirius or Remus, they are loyal and know whom we are and what this boy represents beyond your Boy Who Lived title, he is very special and very powerful, we will be here until Severus Snape takes his blood oath and sires our young one, we will give them provisions and the boy will grow up with our clans until he is eleven, at which time he will return to the school as others of creature blood do to learn their magicks, the Wizarding world will do nothing to find him until he returns except file this farce of an adoption, we will not take no for an answer however we will allow Severus to remain here as long as the headmaster allows his teaching post, is that clear?" The woman said again silkily.
They walked out, vaguely aware of some memos flying out to zoom off to the correct doors littering 2 metres apart on each side of the corridor. Sirius gestured towards the end of the corridor, as they strode past Auror Headquarters, all of which waved from their cubicles if they weren't busy buried in mountains of paperwork.
"Well that's quite an interesting turn of events ay Sonia? You would expect my department to be more interested in that book but at least we fill in the proper channels before requesting to take on certain child cases!" He gives a toothy grin which she can't help but find still unnerving given it usually means extermination.
“Yep.”
Draco raises it, points it at the bed, then looks blankly at Harry. “I can’t remember the spell. You do it.”
. That knot starts to unravel.
Oh, god.
They wake up the next morning with those warm, lean arms clutching their chest again.
“Good, it’s the least you can do,” Padma replies. “Now, get a drink already. We need to catch up.”
“Kind of, back at school.”
Draco looks confused and even a little hurt by Harry’s tone. “Just wanted to make sure you were all right.”
“That’s one way to avoid fighting, I suppose,” Hermione says thoughtfully. “Has he changed much since school?”
He lays in silence for a few minutes, willing his body to sleep, when Malfoy speaks up again. “Does… do any of those gender identities… resonate with you?”
Grimsworth blinked. “Mr Potter, you mean to say that you’re currently engaged to Draco Malfoy?”
And nothing is wrong with the snakes. It almost seems like Malfoy is using the snakes as an excuse to show up, but obviously that makes no sense. Why would Malfoy want to see Harry? And so often?
“You… what?”
“Oh. Okay.” Draco was surprised he’d agreed with no argument.
snake he’s ever seen, he did fight a basilisk after all, but. Well. If he had known the grass snake was going to turn into
“Um, Draco loves…. Boats,” Potter stated. “So I proposed to him on a boat, at, er, sunset.”
Harry startles. He’d thought Malfoy was already asleep.
He comes in a few days later with Doris, a Bundled Woodchuck Asp. There’s nothing wrong with Doris.
They stopped at shop after shop, checking out clothes and books and jewellery without buying anything. They’d ask his opinion on things every now and then, but seemed comfortable to let him follow along quietly.
in our department? Spies. We’ve only been around a couple of years and we’re the most transparent of
Malfoy keeps showing up like he belongs at the clinic. It seems like he doesn't know he's not Harry's typical client, but he
Harry turned towards the bed, facing Draco’s voice. “You’re not a coward. You and Narcissa both saved my life. You both helped me defeat Voldemort. And you both deserve to stay in Britain. It’s your home.”
And then Potter was grabbing him by the shirt and shoving him into the closet door. “You’re using me for my name?”
And then he thought of his mother. His mother, who had sacrificed everything for him, and would now be alone, in the Manor, with no one. He wouldn’t be able to see her again for years, when her probation finally ended. Just a month after her trial, she was already a shadow of the woman who’d raised him, and he didn’t know if she’d make it until then.
“Great! Draco, is that all right with you?”
“Okay, okay,” Potter called. “Just one, though.”
Now Hermione looks confused. “That you’re attracted to boys, of course.”
“No boats,” Draco replied, voice soft but resolute. “No more boats.”
Harry stands up quickly, and Padma and Draco both look at them in confusion. “All right, Harry?” Padma asks. “Maybe we should call that one the last round.”
Malfoy looks outraged. “
They go to Exam Room A (
“Harry is sharp enough to avoid being used by
“Well, why not, if you do with all the other snakes?”
They lose the race, but when they sit next to each other for lunch, the silence is easier. Almost friendly.
“Malfoy… I’ve never worked with magical snakes before,” he admits, realizing that must be what she is.
Harry’s become so used to the bed being Transfigured into two by Draco before even getting to the room at night, that they’re nearly startled to see just one bed.
On the pillow, there’s a snake wrapped around a piece of cherry pie. At the bottom, the word ‘Pie-Thon’ is stitched. Harry grins.
It was quiet for so long after his words that Harry thought Draco had fallen asleep. But then, he said, “I’m sorry.”
Malfoy turns his head. “Patil uses they and them pronouns. And no, I haven’t seen them.”
Draco just leans in and rests himself against Harry’s chest, sighing softly. Harry can’t hold back their smile.
When they pull away, Harry is mesmerized by Draco’s beaming smile. He’s never seen anything so beautiful in his entire life.
“Yeah. It was… needed. And it got me interested in race and blood status and sexuality and gender diversity, so I’ve read a fair bit about it at this point. So, er, basically, you’ve got men and women, right?”
“Fine,” Draco replies, cooly, but his smile is as bright as ever. “I suppose that would be alright.”
“George nearly lost his other ear yesterday,” Ron cuts in. “Well, technically, he
“You smell
“Okay. Er, so, she’s a Southern Stinging Mamba. Stinging because, well, if she feels threatened she can set off the equivalent of a stinging hex, up to about ten feet away. Mamba, well I’m sure you know mambas.”
of my office,” Gilbertson repeated.
Harry gnawed at his lip, thinking. “Favorite foods. Allergies. Pet peeves. Honestly, I feel like I already know most of these things about you from school.”
Draco took a deep breath in, trying and failing to hold back his irritation.
The last thing either boy coherent thought was 'well three days came quicker than expected!'.
My body has grown from a measly 5'3 to 5'7, my usual lean sun kissed skin has taken on a white creamy gleam exuding an aura of abstract beauty completely alien to my old self, my eyes are no longer green but gold.. as if I was a werewolf like Moony, my magical power seemed to arise more than a little as well from how my body feels, I also have a strange urge to take in magic from the items I can sense in my trunk "Wow.. what the hell happened to me?" As I said this there was an audible crack from behind me.. I spun around guardedly to notice a small note floating towards the floor.
They stood there briefly with wide eyes before Sirius and Minerva barked out orders "Kingsley, Arthur! Grab Tonks and bring her inside we need to assess how much was taken from her by those nasty memory charms, we will then take her to St Mongo's and inform the ministry of the damage should it be long lasting and extensive" Minerva announced while Sirius was shouting "Dedalus, Alastor! Grab that bastard Dumbledore we need to bring him inside for interrogation before he is handed over to the Auror's, Mad eye do you have any magic sealing cuffs on you? If so take his wand and cuff him so we are no longer in danger, Snape feed him some Verituserum when we get inside, I want to know his plans for my godson and why he chose to attack his own!".
Malfoy Vault: (Inaccessible)
Sanguinem Exhaurire - Blood Drain
He quickly put on his abandoned half moon spectacles as well as cast a refreshing charm on his robes, before stretching and clicking his tender and aching muscles appropriately, though a sudden urgent knock on his door brought him out of his mundane musings quite abruptly.
As they moved inside however the noise attracted the ire of Mrs Black's painting "Filthy blood traitors besmerching the most noble and ancient house of Black! And YOU are no son of mine you cowardly stain on my name!" She shouted looking directly at Sirius who stood ushering them all in and down into the kitchens.
Sirius Black, was a pure blood in every sense of the word even in utter despair as he was now he looked ravishing beneath those dark dangling locks and short stumbled beard, his crystal blue eyes alight with angst, hostility, betrayal and some other intense emotions Severus couldn't read at first glance, though he would be a fool to misinterpret or underestimate the man before him, he was still in every sense the aggressive young bully he encountered on that first train ride to Hogwarts, experience told him Black would do something drastic right now and only experience told him to keep his guard up despite being the innocent here, he thought maybe he shouldn't have bated the man however he was also the perfect opponent to let off the tension he had acquired since leaving the school.
He sighed and completed the steps with ease before placing it under a stasis charm for later, making it just in time for his next lesson with the first year Hufflepuff's and Ravenclaw student's, he quickly hurried to the classroom, once in there he meticulously went around whispering "Evanesco" vanishing the remains of any problematic concoctions left by the untidy seventh years "I can rely on them not to blow this room up, yet I have to be their maid after every brew? This is getting ridiculous, I will need to have words with Minerva, Filius and Pormona about student's and their sloppy cleanliness after the day's potions lesson's are through, before I meet the others for the ritual" he said to himself with a scowl, he had just finished when the first years began to arrive and take their seats, they knew well to remain quiet as he shut the door and made his way to the chalk board.
"Interesting, alright however can you wait a minute I think I sense Hedwig joining us" Harry replies as he looks towards the open door, a tinkling of broken glass and a squawk could be heard in the main chamber as well as some goblins seemingly peeved before Hedwig lands on Harry's shoulder and pecks his ear 'Master, sorry I am late' Harry just chuckled awkwardly "I will pay for that window Griphook as it is my fault" 'Hed I'm surprised you are here, are you ready to be in your true form again?' 'Yes Master' she says, "Alright Hed, Finite Incantatum!" He mutters in response.
“It’s settled, then,” Molly announced. “You’ll get married at the Burrow. Monday is a holiday and Harry’s off work, so let’s move the wedding to Monday, and we’ll spend tomorrow getting the place ready!”
“Oh, that’s a very kind offer, but I think I’m all set, thanks.” Draco gave his best attempt at a friendly smile. It wasn’t that he disliked Molly, she seemed kind enough and had even defended him last night. But she also seemed like… like she had a lot of energy. Too much energy for him to deal with. And walking through town with her and Potter’s ex was not his idea of fun.
Harry drags his Muggle suitcase out of the lift to his room. The door opens with a slide of the key. Malfoy is already in the room, placing clothes into the dresser. He’s in tight Muggle jeans, and his arse… Harry looks away.
“Okay, fine. Stop.”
When they finally pull apart, Harry turns to whisper in Draco’s ear.
“Do it, then,” Hermione challenges.
Malfoy grabbed it and immediately wrapped it around his waist, looking furious. His wet hair drooped over his forehead like a drowned rat. “Why are there no towels in this place?!”
“So dead parents, that’s a no, but my clothes are fair game?” Harry’s mouth twitches up, and Malfoy’s does the same.
Harry had been joking about the heart-to-heart, but Malfoy starts talking to Harry the next night, too.
Malfoy tilts his head, pausing. “My father once bought me a sword for my birthday. Yours?”
* * *
But everything is not the same. If he enjoyed kissing Malfoy, does that mean he’s attracted to Malfoy?
blushing. “I didn’t realize it was yours.”
Grimmauld Place might not have been made for one wizard, or even for one wizard and a shit ton of snakes. But two wizards and a shit ton of snakes? That seems to be the key to happiness.
“I’d like to make an appointment.” Harry hears Malfoy before he sees him.
Harry’s expecting Draco to come in on Monday, and he does. He’s got Gertrude wrapped around his shoulders, and he smiles so brightly at Harry that Harry thinks he’s going to just fall apart right there, in the lobby, in front of Dave.
“Do you want… if you want, I could use he and they pronouns for you. Interchangeably. To see if you like that.”
Potter nods. “Can’t get nightmares if you can’t fall asleep,” he says.
“Right now.”
This should be a fun year.
They settle on hanging it over Harry’s bed, and Draco smirks every time he sees it. Which is every night, these days. Draco really only goes home to feed and socialize with his snakes, the rest of the time he’s at Harry’s.
Malfoy’s not just decent these days, he’s funny, and quick, and doesn’t put up with any bullshit.
Malfoy visits the clinic again the following Monday, and he’s wearing the clothes Harry bought him. Harry stops short, staring in awe. The jeans fit him perfectly, and Harry wonders if he got the size right or if Malfoy did an alteration charm. The green of the shirt makes Malfoy’s pale skin stand out, and good god, no wonder he was sorted in Slytherin, it would be a crime to see him wearing any other color.
“What do you mean?”
Potter isn’t talking to Draco anymore. Or really, Draco concedes, he’s not fighting with Draco anymore. They never really talked to begin with. Every time he sees Potter he can’t help but spit something out, but Potter’s no longer responding. He’s starting to realize that he…
“Your crisis after kissing Malfoy? Remember that talk?”
“I’m sure you’d be willing to corroborate your story under Veritaserum, then, Mr Potter?”
Neville, the truest Gryffindor of all of them, is the first to guess. "The lie is that two were atrocious," he offers haphazardly.
Harry walks with him to the Apparition point, tipsy from the champagne. “You were nice to Ron and Hermione,” they say.
He turns back to Malfoy, who’s staring.
“Why not? Aren’t you my employee?”
“Thanks for the validation,” Padma says with a snort. “And it’s not just that either, it’s – you and Malfoy.”
And honestly,
Malfoy looked hard at him, seeming to evaluate if Harry was taking the piss. Then he nodded. “I would have been nice to them anyways,” Malfoy told him. “I only ever hated them because my father did. But I learned the hard way just how wrong my father was about, well, pretty much everything.”
Dave looks hopeful, but it seems Malfoy still hasn’t fully grasped the concept of making appointments ahead of time. “No, thanks,” he replies. And then he takes the rest of the money- still quite a large wad- and places it in Dave’s hand.
“Yeah.” Ron rolls his eyes. “Since like, sixth year.”
,” Harry tells them. “A Southern Stinging Mamba.”
When Harry comes up after leaving the bar that night, they expect to see Draco asleep. That hangover-induced migraine couldn’t have gone away quickly without a potion, and Betsy had spent the entire day lecturing.
Granger looks at Weasley, who shrugs. “We’ve gone all the way,” Granger says matter-of-factly, as if expecting someone to be upset with her for this. A few people whoop, and Pansy grins. “Great, you pick who’s next,” she says.
. “You may be interested to note that most Muggles do not wear pyjama bottoms outside of their homes. Dave thought you were homeless.” Malfoy looks outraged. “Which, as you pointed out, is probably discrimination against homeless people. But in Dave’s defense, he also thought you stole a grass snake from its habitat just to come in here.” Harry narrows his eyes. “Did you?”
“I’m— it’s for my mother.”
“Good afternoon,” Harry replied.
Granger picks Weasley, who admits to adopting a stray rat he found near the kitchens. Ernie MacMillan does a cartwheel. Dean Thomas eats a piece of parchment. And then it’s Draco’s turn.
“Well done.” Justin Finch-Fletchley gives him a pat on the back. “Well, go on now, Harry, a dare’s a dare.” Draco sighs again. So much for that.
“No, at least not right now,” Harry replies. “I wanted to adopt one, but then I couldn’t choose which one to adopt, so I ended up not adopting any.”
“I have,” Harry replies, unashamed. “I’ve been going since the start of the year. It’s helped loads.”
He shifts slightly, and his eyes blink open. He doesn’t notice you yet, sitting in the corner. Harry looks up at the ceiling and sighs. He looks… disappointed.
Harry honestly tries to think of something positive, but there’s nothing. “They went out and got me glasses after a teacher suspected I was being neglected, and after that, I was able to learn to read,” Harry tells him.
“It’s a sex pun! Sex puns are for upstairs!” Harry’s trying to sound exasperated, but really he’s holding back a laugh.
"Well
. Harry walked over to the table and collapsed into one of the chairs.
“I think he’s ours,” Harry says, after a few weeks have gone by. “What should we name him?”
But after a while, Draco gives up on disguising it. He likes Potter. Again. He wonders if he ever even stopped.
“No, no, I insist. You should have people there who care about you both. Or would you prefer to have it at your family’s manor, so your mother could attend?”
“Are you going to tell me what’s wrong with Eleanor?” Harry continues, before Malfoy can ask him any more questions on snake gossip culture.
“I know!” Harry yelled back. “I’ve got you!”
Harry slowly pulled away from the kiss, smiling. Draco’s eyes were bright. “Yes, Auror Gilbertson,” Draco stated matter-of-factly. “I’m afraid I’ll have to retract my previous statement. Harry and I actually
Dave looks like he’s going to argue about the money some more, but Harry just waves him off and walks to the back. Dave did have a good point though, Harry thinks. About the trousers.
subject my loving fiancé to.”
“Can we get back to the part where you… like me?”
“You’re welcome to do whatever you wish,” Malfoy replies, flipping the book open. Harry can’t read the cover, but there’s a half-naked bloke on the front with a scantily clad woman wrapped around him. “We’re roommates; we’re not married.”
“Right,” Molly said, brightening. “Let’s talk of happier things! You’re getting married tomorrow, right? What will you be wearing?”
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Draco waves him off. They walk to the apparition point together and Harry’s not sure how to say goodbye- is a handshake too formal? Is a hug too familiar? They’re staring at each other, and Draco looks expectant.
“Where is he?”
“And here I was, feeling insulted that you wouldn’t kiss me goodbye after such lovely dates,” Draco teases. “Turns out you were just waiting to be in a workplace setting, that’s certainly more appropriate.”
“Yeah, kiss!” another Weasley aunt joined in. The room soon filled with a chorus of demands for them to kiss.
Draco’s jaw dropped completely open. And then he grinned, and it was the most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen. “You’re serious?”
Ginevra burst into laughter. “Merlin, you’re joking, right?”
“Yes, terribly pleasant all around,” Ron says, looking hard at Draco. “Hmm. Maybe Harry’s not completely wrong about you.”
“I’m not drunk!” Harry scowls as they take their shoes off.
That evening, Harry’s the one who starts the conversation. In the darkness, the words naturally tumble out. "What does it mean to have no gender?"
She handed them the tray, and Harry scooped a forkful of eggs into his mouth instead of answering. Malfoy took his arm from behind Harry and moved it so he could grab his own plate. “Er, we’re very excited,” Malfoy said. “Can’t wait.” Malfoy’s voice was still gravelly from waking up, and had it been any other man, Harry would have been in trouble.
“I’m sorry for not being
” Harry stutters. And then realization hits. “Wait. So you like me?”
“They didn’t really do anything,” Potter said, resigned. “They mostly pretended I didn’t exist. Although living in a cupboard as a child was less than ideal.”
, he tells her.
“Never have I ever had sex with a woman,” Parkinson winks. The group lets out a laugh, by now used to her incessant need to turn the games in the sexual direction. A few put their fingers down.
, can you believe it? He’s not performing tonight but he stopped by to visit McGonagall and he must be over a hundred years old-”
“I think Patil would be a better person to explain it.”
Potter looks disappointed, and Draco thinks that whatever this prank is, it must have to do with dancing. He may have accepted that he deserves Potter’s punishment, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to walk into it willingly.
“Well, you’ve been friendlier lately-”
“Could you stop doing whatever it is that you’re doing, then?”
“It’s Ron. And don’t thank me.” He and Granger — Hermione — began to walk towards the door, but Hermione turned back towards Draco before she went back to the party.
“How could you just kiss me and
Peter led them onto the ship, taking them up a flight of stairs and over to a small dining table right next to the ship rails. “The best views for my guests of honor!” he exclaimed. “The table is yours for the day, but dinner won’t be served for a few more hours. There’s a buffet on the first level if you get hungry before then, and you’re of course welcome to explore the ship!”
Harry decides to turn Grimmauld into the location for his magical snake veterinary practice. Between appointments at the Muggle clinic and study sessions for his Wizarding veterinary tests, he and Draco spend most of their time there, fixing the ground floor into something resembling a clinic.
Harry’s awake. Ron had stumbled into bed around three, and Harry had pretended to be asleep. He still is. He wishes he could go out to the common room and talk with Draco for the rest of the night but Draco hadn’t been there a single night this week and he certainly wouldn’t be there now, not after Harry had kissed him. His cheek. But still. It was mortifying. And Harry’s gotten to know Draco well enough the past few months to know that he won’t make fun of him for it, or gossip about it, but Harry’s still gone and ruined their friendship.
“I have to tell you something,” he starts.
It’s everything Harry wants. Everything they need. Time stops moving as Draco pushes them onto the bed that’s fused itself back together. And then it’s hands, and heat, and heavy breaths.
he continues.
It’s another pouch of Galleons, way too much, just as before. And there’s another item in the parcel too. It’s an embroidery hoop, and there’s a cross-stitched snake, a European common adder, with a witch hat on it. The word ‘adder-cadabra’ is stitched across the top. Harry grins. He doesn’t know how Malfoy knew about the silly abracadabra incantation, but it makes him happy to think Malfoy knows more about Muggles than he lets on.
Weasley puts his hand over her mouth. “He’s going to hear you-”
Hermione narrows her eyes. “Is it?”
“Where is who?”
“I don’t care. Upstairs. Now.”
Harry nods and turns back to Gertrude.
“Right.” That knot in Harry’s stomach tightens.
“And?”
Draco’s smirk was predatory. He pulled Harry in by the shirt for a scorching kiss. Draco’s body was hot and hard, and Harry swayed against him.
Draco started his walk down the narrow gravel path towards the Weasley’s home. Moments later, Potter stepped out of the front door and walked to meet him along the path. He was wearing a button-up shirt, the blue color bright against Potter’s brown skin. As usual, his hair looked like a bird had attacked it, and it unfairly suited him. Potter was frowning as he approached, and Draco braced himself for another argument.
And now Draco gasps softly, and now they’re stopped in the middle of the road. “You do have a punchable face,” Draco says. “It’s also a face I’d like to kiss.”
“Hullo, Malfoy.”
“Please, Draco. I’ll explain inside.”
They miss all their classes that day, and get quite the scolding from McGonagall, and a detention with it, but neither can stop smiling. Not a single person is surprised when they tell the other eighth years they’re dating.
“Yes, that’s correct,” Draco says, giving a small smile. “You just looked… particularly punchable that day.” This time, Potter lets out a real laugh. “I guess I should apologize for this year too,” Draco continues. “I know I haven’t been pleasant. Something about you just always seems to bring out the worst in me.”
“Well, technically Crabbe set off the-”
. How can he just… look like that? It’s absolutely unfair. Harry forces down a swallow.
Padma crosses her – their – arms. “Okay, yes, we’re all here, yes, we’re the only three wixen at this event, yes, you two have to do all your activities together, but
Potter clasps Draco’s shoulder as he stands up. “I’m going to get us drinks, okay?”
“Draco? Are we doing lunch again this Saturday?”
“Excuse me, Aunt Betta,” Granger interrupted politely. “Do you mind if we steal Draco for a moment?”
“And, I had a panic attack in the middle of a wand fight. Almost died. Our targets got away. I tried another mission after I got out of St Mungo’s, same thing.”
“What are you doing?” Harry asks him, unable to keep the annoyance out of his voice.
“Don’t you like rooming with me?” Harry asks, pouting.
Malfoy met his eyes, sitting up in his chair and sticking up his nose. “Nevermind, Potter. It’s none of your business.”
“Can I come in?” Potter asks, polite despite the hoarseness of his voice.
“I- I think I would
“Patil can speak for themself, Malfoy,” a husky voice cuts in from behind them. Padma looks… well, older, for one. Harry hasn’t seen her – them; he corrects – since Hogwarts. Their hair is shaved into a buzzcut, and it makes the sharp angles of their jaw stand out.
“Rarely.” Harry looks up, and Malfoy’s smirking, but not cruelly. It’s actually a good look on him, Harry thinks. Now that he’s no longer so pointy. And the tailored dress robes do suit him well, much better than the mismatched Muggle clothes.
“I’ll talk to him, okay?” Harry tells Dave. “He probably just needs some help.”
“Some of them.”
“If you hurt Harry,” she said pleasantly, “the Wizengamot will be the last of your worries.”
The opening goes smoothly. It looks like he’ll have a lot more clients than he was expecting. He’ll split his time between the offices, he thinks, and hire another assistant for The Snake Charmer.
“Could you tell me a bit about her?”
“Well,
,” he can’t help but murmur out loud. Because she is. She’s got to be at least six feet long. He’d measure, normally, but the way Malfoy’s worrying his bottom lip makes Harry think it’s an emergency, so he decides to leave her be until he figures out what’s wrong with her. Her scales are bloodred, and she almost looks like a mamba except… well, red mambas don’t exist. There’s a twisting pattern of soft yellows and oranges down her back, and Harry’s reminded of the sunset. She doesn’t really move once she’s settled on the table, other than to flick out her tongue.
Draco thinks that one needs no response. They sit in silence for a while, listening to the Hobgoblins play song after song. Weasley and Granger giggle their way over, and plop themselves down next to Potter.
“Alright, alright.” Harry allows himself to drop and can’t help his surprise when Malfoy’s arms are firm in holding him up. He pulls himself away quickly, and they repeat the falls until Betsy calls for the next activity.
And then she was gone, and Draco could hear a chorus of voices calling his name. He headed back to the main room.
“Is that a question?”
“Obviously.”
“Great,” Malfoy repeats. “Goodnight, Potter.”
Betsy’s helpers come around, bringing a rope to each of the groups. They’re instructed to tie their legs together so that they each have one free leg and one tied leg.
“Very personal, Potter.”
“For who?”
Draco looked to Ginevra, who seemed amused. “It’s best not to argue,” she told him.
“No,” Draco spits. “You
,” Potter spits. And then the
It’s a game of Never Have I Ever that really tips Harry over the edge, though. It’s the end of October and the castle is decorated for Halloween and he’s been friends with Malfoy for almost a month now, and Vince has just announced that Hogwarts will be holding a Yule Ball. Harry’s trying not to think about Malfoy in dress robes, and focus on the game before him.
“Okay,” Harry croaks out. “Sounds good.”
“Was I what?”
Draco thought of Potter’s earnest testimony in his favor. He thought of obscure old laws from the books he’d been studying during his probation. And then, a plan started to form in his head.
Harry realises his mouth is wide open and snaps it shut. “I’m… I… You know this is a Muggle practice, right?”
Hermione quirks her lip. “We’re fine, Harry. Nothing as exciting as teacher training to keep us entertained.”
Oh, sure, years one through seven had Voldemort, but they didn’t have forced social interactions. And, he guesses, the other years did have Malfoy, but not like Malfoy is now. He’s not the snarky kid who bullied Harry in the corridors. He’s not the depressed, quiet Malfoy from sixth year. He’s somehow… both. Malfoy is irritable, and he snaps at Harry every chance he gets, while still looking like a lost puppy. And the worst part is, he can’t say anything to Ron or Hermione, because he already did. (
“A fair amount,” Malfoy replies with a smirk.
It’s a copious amount of money, though, and Harry gives the leftovers to Dave again after converting to pounds.
“Fairy godmothers! Fortune telling! Snake charming!”
“Will you help?” Malfoy’s voice interrupts his thoughts.
Dave just stares, and Harry leads Malfoy to the exam room.
“No, I just- I
? Harry doesn’t know how to respond to that.
Draco still sits next to Harry during the teaching lectures, but Harry can feel his anger seething between them. They don’t try to talk to Draco during breaks or lunch. Harry skips dinner, leaving Draco to eat with whoever he wants to, heading up to bed instead. They don’t want to make things any more uncomfortable than they already are.
“You go first,” Harry says. “Best present you’ve ever received.”
Harry holds his arms behind his back and pinches himself.
And Draco suddenly realizes just how completely wrong he had gotten it.
They unpack, then head together in silence to the ballroom on the ground floor where the conference is set to take place.
“Right. Dumbledore’s Army. No, I haven’t taught before. But I guess that’s why she sent me here.”
A few more minutes in silence pass, and when Draco looks over, Potter is asleep, slumped onto the floor.
Draco forces himself to breathe evenly. “How many times have you died, Potter?”
Harry smiles. “See you then.”
“Yeah, well, you asked. So yeah, after I resigned, I got a letter from McGonagall about the Defence professorship,” Harry finishes. “Why are you becoming a teacher, then?”
And Harry’s a bit pissed off at Draco, but he’s looking so earnestly at them, like he’s actually concerned.
“That’s good,” Malfoy replies, a hint of caution in his voice. “And if you’re not completely sure, that’s okay too.”
“What did they do to you?” Draco could feel the questioning getting annoying but couldn’t stop himself. He needed to
Dave’s eyes widen. “I can’t take this.”
And the
“Good. Glad that’s settled.” Harry takes the small snake from Malfoy’s hand and places it on the exam table. “Is this another big one?”
“I– what?” Harry pauses.
- you named your practice ‘The Snake Whisperer,’ what’s one supposed to think?”
seen Malfoy’s face look like that, and, well, then he’s gone.
“Oh. Okay. Good.”
“He’s not
“What the fuck are you doing?”
she snaps. Harry lets out a chuckle at the sass.
“Slow walkers. When people are late. Loud chewers. Being on boats. Think you can do me?” Harry gave him a challenging smirk.
He swears and picks himself off the floor, turning around to see what he tripped over. It’s dark, but he can make out curls of black hair and knows immediately that it’s Potter.
Harry finally made it to him. He grabbed onto Draco’s torso and lifted him higher. “
Of course. Fucking Gryffindors. They just can’t help themselves. He doesn’t want them to see. Doesn’t want Potter to see.
“What? Why not?”
“So, Malfoy, huh?”
“All through our school years you accuse me of using my name to get further, and here
They are, it seems. Potter’s holding onto Draco’s arm and leading them into the Great Hall, where music is already playing. It’s going to be some sort of humiliation in front of the entire school, then. Delightful.
. It’s a dick move. And you know it.” Harry could feel his face reddening as Draco just stared at him.
Malfoy moves to leave the exam room, and Harry grabs his arm. “You don’t- I’m already seeing you right now, aren’t I? Just make an appointment next time.”
Draco looks up and grins at him, and Harry’s heart clenches. “Sure,” he says. “See you then.”
“Gilbertson,
“Yeah, sure. Intense Quidditch bloke.”
“This is extremely inappropriate—”
Draco cleared his throat. “As they say, communication is the key to any healthy relationship.”
After Apparating into downtown Ottery St Catchpole, Draco found it was rather easy to avoid talking about Potter or the engagement, as Molly and Ginevra were perfectly capable of keeping up their conversation without his participation. Ginevra had cut her hair short since leaving school, and it suited her. She walked with confidence and seemed genuinely happy to be spending time with him and Molly.
The inside of the house was filled with magical items bobbing about, but Draco barely had a chance to look around before the guests started arriving. There were a few people he recognized, but most of the people were redheaded and entirely unfamiliar. In the crowd, Draco was able to spot Ronald and Ginevra Weasley, and Granger as well. He thought he got a glimpse of Luna, too.
Severus was still awake in his private quarters despite the late hour, making notes in his potions journal as he sipped his muled wine, occasionally muttering to himself about the incompetence of his students when the flash of flame interrupted his musings and drew his attention to Fawkes' sudden appearance in his study along with a note clutched in his talons.
James grew suspicious of those empty platitudes despite them thinking he was naive and blindly loyal, Dumbledore was being shifty as of late and he hoped he would leave soon this was his home and he was feeling very protective of his heir and wife right now, it seemed his tensing got his message across to Snape and Poppy as well as they left not soon after Dumbledore.
"S-sorry s-sir it-t s-says I na-need Bat Spleen yet I took a Bazour oops" she said shakily, "Oops indeed, if you had used that with the potion and made the ingredients volatile without the Bat Spleen at least when you test it, you would have something to counteract the poison you would have ingested, 10 points from Hufflepuff for failing at adhering to simple instructions, get back to your seat and start brewing or you will be in detention finishing it tomorrow night!" He shouted as she practically ran back to her seat to prepare her brewing station and cauldron, 'it's times like these I am reminded of how little, children follow the instructions and care little for their dangerous errors, I would leave this place now that the Dark Lord is on a undetermined leave of absence, if not for Harry needing me now and what Dumbledore is likely to do to me, if I left his service, I would also leave his protection and given the court's and the ministry will be after us, we could use all the backing we can get, if I want a less risky life for the boy' Severus thought as he walked around the room eyeing the cauldrons many stages of premature disaster in distaste.
"As Auror's apperated to the scene in order to find out the cause for disturbance within the seemingly quiet suburban neighbourhood, an erupting explosion could be heard engulfing the boy's muggle home."
'It seems the dunderheads live to brew another day without my explicit guidance' Severus thought satisfied he could attend to more pressing matters, as he walked back the way he had come, back to his private lab ready to brew the adoption potion for his soon to be son.
"The thing you have to understand is that the Dark Lord you wizards are so scared of is but an insect compared to the council and once Harry is grown maybe his title of saviour will be literal given his powers already showing at infancy.. providing meddlesome tools stay out of his way" the unknown Lich added in rasp, clearly glaring at the Headmaster at his feet struggling to rise due to the gravitational spell produced by Flora.
Ha ha Umbridge got caught! I wonder how the trial will turn out though, it does seem to be thick with political manipulations within the Wizengamot and its ruling.
Sirius enters the Ministry to attempt to send out warrants for Pettigrew and his apparent help and to see Harry is adopted legally by his new guardian Severus, however things are amiss when Umbridge appears requesting certain documents on one Harry James Potter!
"I believe I asked what the fuck you were doing here Snape, I knew what James was and I can tell this little fella has the condition, if you haven't forgotten I am an auror, you are trespassing and witnessed in the scene of a crime of murder! State how you knew to come here and why you are here, you will not touch Harry, I was named his guardian in case of these circumstances!" He barked out harshly, also withdrawing his wand and pointing towards Snape in accusation.
Ragnok nodded his assent before taking a small object out of his pocket and handing it to Osiris "You will have thirty seconds before that port key takes you to Malfoy Manor with Lord Potter" though before he placed it into the Elfs hands he quickly cast Harry unconscious again "He needs a healing sleep, his body has been through too much too quickly even an immortal would snap if his magic collapsed as his is dangerously close to doing, make sure he does no magic for a week after he awakes which should be in three days once with his mate, Osiris you will also inform him he is welcome to return to collect his holdings in Peverell vault after that and we also have a problem with that nasty Messorem, if he could come by when rested and dispose of that abomination, we would compensate him greatly given the risks involved with dealing with the thing, not even our curse breakers can kill that undead" He muttered then placed a small obsidian orb into the Elfs outstretched palm.
The cart lurched suddently into a sharp descent, almost like a rollercoaster in Harry's opinion, before coming to a grinding hault, facing an ancient doorway etched in extensive immaculate runes only illuminated by the soft eerie glow of the numerous flickering torch brackets either side the door.
"I am a Dark Chimera a rare Dark Creature now with the power to sap magical gifts from other dark beings? Was this the edge against Tom the prophecy foretold or am I just lucky? Well whatever the case Dark Arts is forbidden so I must train discreetly and make sure Albus doesn't find out what I have done or am even if I am still me, He detests Dark Creatures because they aren't safe around normal beings, my nature hasn't changed enough but I propose a significant threat now that I am good at wandless magic and have the means for exponential growth, he may kill me just for what I am regardless of the side I wish to be on" I mutter to myself in contemplation under a silence bubble so those I obliviated of the conversation can't hear me and undo my hard work.
'it seemed her uterus has burst internally as her son has tried to get out through the contractions', she thought as she rushed to Lily's side and tipped her chin back to swallow a vial handed to her by Severus, he then proceeded to point his wand at her legs and chant "Volmera Sumento" with each inflection the blood slowly flowed back into her body and sealed the vaginal wound.
"Wait Blaise please do not tell me you used our normal magic sealing cuffs on a Dark Elf.. you do realise they don't work on magical creatures!" As the look of horror dawned on his ex lovers face he realised with a sinking dread that is exactly what happened and was startled when another knock struck the door followed by Lord Voldemort and his father walking in with a decidedly evil smirk on their faces.
Parseltongue (Broken)
Paddy popped into the room at this "Mistress be needing the extra care of young master while she be resting? I be's careful not to get bitten buts I will need permission to use masters' dragon hide gloves to handle master Harry" he squeaked.
The red eye's filled with unrivalled malice glanced in his direction instilling fear deep in Draco's heart, before latching on to the prone form of Harry and the swirling rune patterns etched into his rivals skin.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dumbledore chuckled to himself as he watched the little one play, "Now Harry it is time we got down to business" he said as he gently pulled the rattle to gain the child's attention, "I assure you this will not hurt a bit! You will thank me later I'm sure, we can't have you running off now can we? I do this to protect you, Liga Animo!" A jet of silver light hit the boy square in the temple, who promptly fell into sleep and slumped in the mans grasp, dropping the rattle with a thunk under the mans desk.
Griphook pushed the door inwards and turned to see Harry's slightly stunned "I'm sure you are wondering why I must do that, standard procedure hex on vaults, if one tried to open their vault without a goblin present it would swallow them whole and we only test them for thieves once a year to see who's stuck inside, you will die through starvation way before we check it" he let out a voracious grin at him which was returned after a moment.
Remus slowly stood to place Harry in his cot as was asked, being very careful not to wake the infant who fell asleep sheltered in his arms, sometime after Remus started stroaking him, his golden irises dimming as the waves of quiet anger left him.
He breathes out a soft sigh 'damn she is beautiful in this moonlight, bursting full with our son, it should be any day now according to Poppy, I hope my cursed nature hasn't been past on to him but we will see as she was unfamiliar with the spell to test creature blood before birth, if it wasn't for our creature blood we could of used a licensed St Mongos healer though I'm glad we are able to put our trust in Poppy as she is the only person we can trust if Harry has our burden'.
"Son must you do this? He is the most dangerous thing on the planet! And he will get even worse the more he consumes, what if he has no trace of humanity when he wakes and see's you as sustenance? You would die ten thousand deaths if you don't kill it before it awakes!" He said scared shitless.
This emotion died a monstrous death however, when as they turned to disapparate, Dumbledore crept into view in his harshly billowing purple robes.
Vampiric Touch (Broken)
Albus Dumbledore was in the midst of finishing the last of his ministry paperwork and penning a note to Peter Pettigrew, feeling slightly tired however he was about to get up from his desk and turn in for the night, when a flash of the floo alerted him to something potentially grave, he quickly banished his piles of work for later use and steeped his fingers, focusing on the floo grate, all drowsiness evaporated when James appeared in his grate wearing a deep scowl 'has he figured my plans out already?' Dumbledore thought in irritation though proceeded to wear an indulgent grand-fatherly smile "James my boy! What can I do for you and Lily at this late hour?".
Grand Father: Fleamont Charles Peverell-Potter (Deceased, 1979)
Sirius and Remus were silent for a moment at this, before Sirius asked "Flora if we are to care for the boy other than Severus how are we to keep up with his immortality? I may not be his new guardian after this but I do still love the boy and have a duty of care for him as my best friends wanted" Remus nodded at this too, Flora cocked her head at this "Hmm you have a point human and I do admire your determination to keep our Harry safe, you will be given a choice though Remus has limited options given he is already a Dark Creature and has the limitations of his kind, though we do have a solution, for you we can turn you into an immortal being depending on which Creature you wish to become, you could even allow Harry or myself to bite you if Vampire is your choice, however I expect a choice brought to us before we leave with them both. As for Remus we can give the potion to fuse him and his wolf as a start and we can even persuade Nicolas Flammel to give him monthly doses of the elixir of life, it is the only way he can stay alive but be warned it is an eternity of loneliness if you wish to stay in the mortal world with immortality, those you love turn to dust while you remain, can you even handle immortality to care for young Harry?" She asked with a raised eyebrow.
Inheritance: Dark Chimera
Severus rolled his eyes somewhat at this "Looks like I will have to cover up this bastards messes again, leave it to Potter to torment me even in death, Culex Pipiens! Subscriptio Exponentia Irritanda Destinauit!" He spoke softly as he pointed his wand at the decaying flies hovering around as well as inside his body casting the insecticide hex and the dark spell magical signature nullification, before casting a final disgusted yet dismissive glance at his childhood nemesis.
Harry’d been with the Aurors for almost a year now. After the war ended, he’d tried to spend time with the Weasleys and with the Hogwarts rebuild, but this had only resulted in him fighting with Ginny and getting frustrated with not being able to help Hogwarts in the ways it really needed. The Auror department was a vast improvement from the awkwardness of Weasley dinners after the breakup or the anxiety from seeing Hogwarts so far from recovery.
“There’s only one—”
----------------
Ron raised an eyebrow. “I got here ten minutes ago to help Mum with something, and I haven’t seen him. Haven’t seen Mum either, actually, do you know where she’s gone off to?”
Hermione smirks. "Nice to know you think I'm smart, Parkinson. But I do suck at chess. The lie is that I've never left Britain- I've done quite a bit of traveling."
Harry has to hold in their wince at Ron’s word choice. Stupid Malfoy, making them too aware of their gender. Absolutely ridiculous. They should take back what they said about him being decent.
“So, how many snakes do you have, Malfoy?” Harry asks after they put in their order.
“Well, I was fired,” he replies, flushing at the memory.
There’s a knock on his door, and Potter’s voice. “Hey, Malfoy, are we doing this?”
“Reckon so,” Harry says to the ceiling. “Why do you care?” he asks, hoping the question comes out more inquisitive than rude.
And does she ever.
Harry groans. “I can’t believe I’m admitting this out loud… I like Malfoy.”
“And that’s okay. We learn new things about ourselves all the time. Sometimes, those things are bigger than others. Sometimes, they change everything. But that’s not terrible. You’re learning about yourself, Harry. That can only be a good thing.”
“How is that obvious?”
During the trial, Malfoy had confessed to everything he had done, had turned Lucius in, had spoken with a strength of emotion that nearly had Harry moved to tears. Harry knows Malfoy regrets his role in the war. After seeing his left arm covered in ugly scars, there’s no doubt about that. But he’s still Malfoy, he’s still an asshole, and he won’t stop harassing Harry. And with the eighth years all living together, eating together, and taking all the same classes, Harry can’t escape from him.
at him. Potter’s dress robes are perfectly tailored to his Quidditch-fit body. There’s a glint of emerald green woven through the edges of the fabric and Potter’s eyes look like jewels. Potter looks Draco up and down, and it looks like he’s hungry. Well, Draco thinks, there’ll be food at the ball. If they’re even going there.
“Are you kidding me? Already?” Granger tightens her jaw.
. Oh, Harry.”
“If he’s got this much money, shouldn’t he spend it on, I don’t know, trousers?” Dave looks exasperated. Harry laughs.
Harry let out a sigh, relieved that Draco sounded calm now. He wrapped the blankets even tighter around them both. “No more boats,” he agreed.
“Can I help you?” Harry inquires politely. He’s nothing if not a professional, even if he’s napping. The blond man turns around and Harry immediately loses his composure. “
“Sorry.” Harry sighs. “Didn’t mean to be an arse.”
“Draco, listen to me,” Harry said, ignoring Gilbertson completely. “You’re a complete dick.”
Draco and it’s warm and it’s hot and it’s soft and it’s hard and Draco can’t help but gasp for air as Potter pulls away.
“It’s nothing against you personally. It’s just, I went to school with you, yeah? And every year, there was a crisis, and I know they weren’t
gay?!” Seamus cries.
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy walked closer towards the rail, taking in the brilliant orange and yellow sunset. “It’s beautiful!” he shouted to Peter.
, did I mention? He couldn’t even have said goodbye? Who leaves a note?”
Harry melted into Draco as their lips met and moved against each other. It was more tender than their first kiss; it was longer, warmer, deeper; it was infinitely better now that he knew Draco, now that they knew
“Yes, me and Harry,” Draco replied. “That— that doesn’t bother you, does it?”
“What’s that supposed to—”
“What are you…” Draco’s voice was strained.
Draco met his gaze and gave Harry a soft, grateful smile before closing his eyes. He shifted in the bed, moving so their arms just barely brushed together.
“Noodles?” Now Harry’s laughing.

The Chief Warlock didn’t seem to notice the unspoken conversation between them. “Mr Potter? Can you confirm that you won’t willingly take Veritaserum to verify your relationship with Mr Malfoy?”
To feel Outcasted by Blood Relatives.
Sitting around, casually chatting in its dank and dusty depths, the smell of stale food, smoke and alcohol immediately assaulting his now heightened senses, causing him to grimace darkly, the only partial comfort being the boundless power fluctuations he could feel, emanating from the cores of each occupant, strengthening his desire to reach for it and sap it for his own.
I stare mindlessly into the blurry abyss of the softly blanketing darkness engulfing me within my bedroom, taking only small comfort in the final silence of Privet Drive and the gentle snoring of the Dursley's down the hall, slowly counting down the seconds until my birthday as is my lonely tradition despite gaining friends finally in Hogwarts.
The goblin in question nodded and handed a third piece of parchment detailing recent business transactions and vault estimates.
"I was musing about the Potter birth that occurred early hours yesterday morning, when I realised I could think of their address clearly, which was a clear sign of the charm failing and the Potter's possible endangerment, my fault was not alerting the proper authorities when I left via unregistered portkey to check their residence myself, hoping my potions expertise would spare at least Lily and the Boy here if I could make it in time to curse any Death Eaters snooping around, I appeared in the centre of the small village and quickly deduced something was indeed wrong, from a far as I walked to the Estate, I noticed the gate had been open slightly which suggested either they left or something got in through the charm, though no Dark Mark was present, hanging over the building, from further inspection as I drew nearer, I saw the door blown out, merely splinters and a cracked doorway was left, with fallen debris along the entry way and what seemed to be dark magic residue and structural scarring from stray spells, it was clear a magical battle of some sort was faught in the early hours of the morning before I arrived, I found James Potter's decomposing corpse which had fallen down the stairs, it seemed he was a victim to the organ rupture curse causing outer bleeding of the orifices and internal bleeding, I killed the insects milling around his body to prevent the spread of vampirism, before I ascended to find the remains of Lily and the Dark Lord himself in the master suite as well as their house elf, intriguingly the boy was the only one left alive, Lily sacrificed herself for the child and whatever spell she used succeeded in rebounding a rupture curse back on to the Dark Lord, astonishingly he is dead and the boy came out of it with nothing but this cursed scar where he was hit! I wrapped the boy up before Black appeared and we realised the possible culprit behind this attack, only Peter Pettigrew was able to give that address, he sold them out to Him! He has left this child in the care of Black who has no experience in parenting a normal child let alone a full blooded dark creature infant, he needs a place, a fit guardian, I will not have Lily's sacrifice be in vain Dumbledore! What is to happen to him? You know our world are prejudice at best to half wizards and dark creatures let alone a boy who fell the Dark Lord and is practically a mythical creature in this country! Not just will he be shamed by our kind but those of the Fae or Vampire court when they get wind of his continued existence, it will be a manhunt!" Severus shouted in the mans face, "Now my boy it is truly a day of celebration if what you are saying is true, the boy will be regaled as a hero, The Boy Who Lived in fact! He is the first to survive an encounter with that man other than myself and we all know I don't counter as I am fully grown and accomplished, he is a defenseless child going against the greatest threat to wizard kind since Grindelwald, you just can't compare, I understand your reasoning but I will not blame Peter without evidence that he was there at all, do you have proof of these allegations? Did you find his magical signature as you searched the premises?" Albus added, "No headmaster but it is the only explanation as the floo was only accessible if the Potter's opened it up their end as you know, he was secret keeper!" Sirius interrupted, "I cannot place blame without tangible evidence, you are free to track the man down Sirius as you are an Auror and take him in for questioning however there is nothing I can do with no evidence or testimony and it would need to be brought up to the rest of the Wizengamot as these are serious allegations of murder charges and must be examined thoroughly before such a sentence can be thought of, now about the child, I agree with Severus that it unwise to pick his guardian uncarefully as you are unfit to house someone this young especially a dark creature that could spread vampirism with its every feed, as you are legal guardian however will you consent to leaving him in our care so we can all find the best place to take him? He has muggle relatives if I remember correctly however I will not put him with them that would be most unsuitable and would endanger everyone involved with the child, Severus what do you suggest?" Albus enquired of the two, "Now see here Albus, I do not give consent unless I know this boy will be cared for more so than I could give him which is a pretty high standard to achieve if it could be, why are you both doubting that I can't take care of Harry?" He said in frustration, causing the boy in question who was sticking his hand in his mouth to eye him inquisitively for a moment before going back to his task and resting in the mans arms.
Sirius could be seen trudging silently through the depths of Knockturn Alley, carrying Peter in his new cage, as the milling shady occupants eyed the auror in both fear, hostility and open disgust before disregarding him completely as he walked steadily towards the Alley entrance.
Suddenly a very loud noise could be heard outside of the Great Hall, including a muffled wail and an even louder shout of angry voices, one could be easily distinguishable to the occupants as the chattering stopped to hear the explosive arguement outside.
As Harry collapsed unconscious due to the influx of receiving the power of the mysterious Shaytan, Osiris ran to him exasperated "The one fool to help me escape this place and he's allowed himself to over tax his magical consumption.. this idiot has damn near killed himself before he could even get me out of here!" He raged, much to the amusement of the Goblins stationed around him.
2nd Bedroom,
All the Goblins standing admist their usual podiums waiting to serve customers, all turned and gazed and the rather abrupt entrance, most sneering openly thinking 'Who does that wizard think he is barging in here like he owns and thinks he has the right to give orders on our premises!', Ragnok the bank manager present at the far end just stared him down before signalling the armed guards to walk with him to where the Dumbledore stood with half the Order.
What will happen when they go to start their transition into the immortal community? What training do you think Harry may be subjected to before his emergence back into the Wizarding World?
(See the end of the chapter for
She took a moment to gather herself and breathe more calmly than she felt before knocking, "Enter" a rough male voice said from inside, she steeled her resolve as the door opened to reveal the man inside, sitting at his desk writing, what seemed to be a long report, occasionally scratching his sweaty head.
"Calm down Lil's, Snape has been, I fed Harry, he is just lively as this is the first he has seen of the world and of us, it is common for an infant vampire to be very inquisitive early on, I must say though he is amazing, I thought he might be like Tonks last night his eyes kept changing colours, it was intriguing but I don't know what Nymphadora was like so young and she is only in her third year right now so we won't know until she is away from Hogwarts for the holidays, do you think Ted or Dromeda might know how to test him?" James asked in contemplation.
Poppy ran some diagnostic spells on both the mother and child before reporting her findings "Lily you recieved extensive damage to your internals due to the nature of this birth however our quick action will only leave you more sore than average for a few weeks, I recommended plenty of rest and to take replenishment potions daily for up to next seven days as well as nutrient potions until the effects wear off as well as a pain relief potion immediately, if you experience any flu symptoms please floo me, as for the boy he is healthy and as we can see he has contracted your husbands' vampirism however he is in fact a Dhampire! a hybrid of Dark Elf and Vampire, he can eat normal foods as well as drink blood and he seems to be magically very powerful, now that he has calmed I can tell he also has hetrocromia an eye condition leading to multiple melanin distribution in the eyes causing multiple colours of the irises so far it is green and blue with a hint of red, we will have to monitor him closely for a few days, I do not recommend feeding him milk on first feed however as he needs blood to regrow his energy, I will contact saint mongos for a list of donors and we can get him blood packs tomorrow, tonight however he is best feeding from his father in order not to spread his vampirism" she looked sharply at James at this, who smiled meekly and nodded given he was caught doing that years ago in Hogwarts and the cycle may continue in this case.
As Sirius took his seat at the head of the table and Remus came in to sit at his right, Alastor smirked openly "Ah gentleman finally joining the party I see, personally I can see why and we heard your discussion, we aren't shouting our disagreements, we concur he needs to be back her and shown we are not out to hurt him unless he turns on us or allies himself to the Dark, we know even if he is a Dark Creature at nature it doesn't mean he would ally himself easily with Voldemort, you are living prove Remus, the boy needs protection and training but found in the right way not Dumbledore's way, speaking of anything you wish to ask him? He's been fed the truth serum it will last until Severus feeds him the antidote".
Osiris for his part didn't complain with the rough treatment to him it was lucky he was getting out at all and he did owe Harry enough to be concerned for the others wellbeing, half way through the ricketin journey back through the myriad of tunnels, Harry stirred and started to glow a faint light blue which began to snake along his arms, arranging into strange runic patterns, some being noticable and simplistic such as the symbol of lightening, others appeared all together more intricate and hard to distinguish as they were carved into his flesh.
He spotted the door to their bedroom, it seemed there were many spells on the door to break but he was no amateur he laughed even 'they were foolissh enough not to activate their blood wardsss I will make easy work of thisss' "Finte Incantatum!".
Harry edged right behind Narcissa before wordlessly casting "Finite" to end his concealment, all the occupants jumped and fumbled for their wands before pointing them at him, leading him to giggle a bit, Narcissa took in Harry's changed form and his startling new golden eyes before gasping loudly in recognition.
Potter Main Vault: 370,500 Galleons, 50 Sicles and 7 Knuts (Accessible), 70 artifacts and 40 rare tomes remaining.
He noticed the guards tense as he neared "How strange" he muttered as he walked up the marble steps towards them. "Stop, You will be searched magically before entering!" One of the guards shouted at him holding up a whirling rodded instrument in one hand and a spear in another, threateningly. "Besides this rat cage spelled to keep the occupant inside I am not carrying anything illegal and am not here to foolishly attempt to steal gold! Do you dare accuse a Black of attempted robbery or an Auror for that matter?!" Sirius shouted back in equal rage, the goblin guard just smirked "No sir it is simply protocol in this time of unease surely a pure blood of such a prestigious noble line would sequest to our security procedures, we mean no offence after all" he said calmly this time but with his eyes gleaming in amusement, "Fine hurry up, I have business to attend to, do not attempt to remove any enchantment on this cage it is an Animagus I am bringing to the ministry for interrogation after my business here is concluded" Sirius sighed, the goblin nodded its' ascent before scanning him head to toe with the rod, whirling irritatingly in Sirius's face, "He is clear, he may pass" the goblin said to the other stationary whom nodded and opened the gold door for him in a short bow.
What do we think of Dumbledore's behaviour or Sneaky Snape?
