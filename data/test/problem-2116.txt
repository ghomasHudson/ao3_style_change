“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.”
Sarah did not speak to Harry at all through Transfiguration when he arrived from his Charms class. She sat next to Blaise on the other side of the room and ignored the green-eyed boy’s looks. It was easy to distract herself; Professor Umbridge was sitting in a corner, a clipboard on her lap.
“That’s only because you made me practice for hours until you were happy,” he grouched, smiling slightly.
,” Sarah said, pulling him to a stop. She desperately tried to catch his eye but he wasn’t looking at her. “Draco cares so much about you.
“Are you feeling all right, sir?” Draco closed his eyes and pinched his nose at Charles’ question. He had already been asked that question twice by Rosie and Cassandra before he had even managed to step into the surgery rooms and he had been hoping that the young man would refrain from repeating it. Alas, it would not happen.
Draco clenched his jaw but didn’t look away from his sister’s face, even when she turned to glance out a nearby window, the afternoon sun glinting off her white-blonde hair.
“Yes! My boyfriend cheated on me and it’s not like I’ve been able to sleep with anyone lately, I’ve been surrounded by gay blokes, one of which is my brother!” Lyra exclaimed. She suddenly stopped and held her breath, grey eyes widening. “Pretend you didn’t hear that. Oh, Merlin, I fucked up. I fucked up.”
“Oh, he wanted to,” Pansy assured her. “He just had to deal with Potter first. Apparently, that man feels as though you’ve been slighted. You would have thought, a Potter defending a Malfoy?”
“Conniving bints,” Draco growled, practically stabbing his parchment as he wrote. “They need to keep out of my business.”
. You were extremely fit and you obviously cared about Fluffy and Teddy. Pansy and Rosie teased me for weeks, especially when they found out I had gone to your store. I don’t think you truly understand how much I love books, Harry, and the fact that you own a bookstore just seemed too perfect for my panicking gay mind.”
Draco let out a stream of curses when he couldn’t identify the source of the seizures. Surely, there was
“Yeah,” came Fred’s voice from behind her. Sarah turned to see him smirking at the first years. He slung an arm around his waist and added in a conspiratorial whisper, “Be worried about his boyfriend. He took down a dragon once!”
The other’s laughter echoed around Lyra and Draco as Lyra darted around the corridor, trying to evade Draco as he raced after her. It only came to a stalemate when Lyra jumped on Harry’s back, wrapping her limbs around him tightly. Draco refused to attack his boyfriend, something that greatly irritated Lyra even much later in life. But it didn’t matter, because they were nearly graduated. They all finally had the opportunity to start their lives without the shadow of darkness hanging over them – and they intended to grasp it with both hands.
“Seven years,” Draco answered with a smile. “She was the first friend I made at university. Haven’t been able to get rid of her since.”
Sarah spent most of her time in the Slytherin common room surrounded by Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Theo and Millicent. She had quietly told them what happened in the graveyard, Theo’s eyes going wide when his father was mentioned.
“Most of the judges,” and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look, “feel that this shows moral fibre and merits full marks. However…Mr Potter’s score is forty-five points.”
Harry stuck his left hand out and pulled his sleeve up to expose the golden band. Sarah examined it and stroked it carefully.
Stunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned to Dumbledore now…or almost every face. Sarah saw Crabbe and Goyle muttering together. She felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in her stomach. She forced herself to look back at Dumbledore.
“I think everything is just about to begin,” Sarah admitted. “We know about the Horcruxes but we still have to find them, and I
Harry was looking at him with such a fond expression that Draco’s blush deepened, heating all his face and neck.
!” Draco hissed. He grabbed his cloak and marched through the bar towards the door. He relished the cool wind on his face as he leant against the outside wall, staring balefully out across the street.
Moody took out a register and called everybody’s names, slowly down slightly at Crabbe’s, Goyle’s, Sarah’s, Draco’s and Theo’s. His vivid blue eye trained them on and they stared defiantly back.
“Excuse you, I was living off rats for the majority of last year,” Sirius argued, stuffing half the sandwich into his mouth. “If I want another sandwich, I will
“I think it was because of the locket,” Sarah admitted. “Being in such close contact made the connection with You-Know-Who stronger, overpowering his Occlumency shields.”
“Leave them alone, Pads,” Remus said, rolling his eyes. “I hope you two enjoy the Quidditch World Cup. Bulgaria versus Ireland – that’ll be something to behold.”
“So that’s it, is it?” said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt. Sarah could see the exact moment that Harry realised what was going on, a second before McGonagall continued. “Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.”
“Congratulations, Harry!” Skeeter said, beaming at Harry. “I wonder if you could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you feel
The second attempt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Sarah couldn’t stop snickering at Draco after he tripped over his own feet and nearly fell in Professor Sprout, who was walking nearby. It wasn’t until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.
, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all wizardkind, and it one young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the
The three of them sat on Fred’s bed in tense silence. They had drawn the curtains closed and put up a Silencing Charm so they could talk without disrupting the other boys in the room.
She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, “Of course I – how dare you suggest - ?”
Sarah was about to ask another question when her view was suddenly blocked by a large cloud of brown curls.
“Thank you again, Narcissa, for all your help with this,” Fred said suddenly. “Everything was perfect.”
“We should make an event out of it,” she declared. “A giant renovation party where we just tear down the walls and make it our own place.”
“Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. “I don’t know I’m doing it!”
He shrugged and dropped down into a free armchair, shifting his daughter so that she laid across his chest.
Crabbe and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. She, Draco, Harry, Ron and Hermione were all on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.
The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar of the crows as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Sarah felt the wind whip her braid through the air as she immediately grabbed the Quaffle from the air, shooting down the pitch.
“And that is as much information as you’re sharing,” Harry said quickly, covering Draco’s mouth with his hand. When he was sure Draco wasn’t going to say anything else, he sat down beside Fred.
“I didn’t tell you about mine or your mother’s friendship with Sirius because of his actions many years ago,” Lupin explained. “He chose to betray us – his best friends – and I have never understood why. It was simply easier to push that part of me away – to ignore it and pretend it never happened.”
“In all seriousness, though,” Sarah went on, “Harry and I did have a lovely chat with dear Ronald and I think he’s going to be making some beneficial decisions in the future.”
With N.E.W.Ts and graduation looming closer, Harry and his friends commonly found themselves taking opportunity of the warmer weather to study outside. His boyfriend always had a textbook in front of him and merely hummed when Harry lay in his lap, resting the book on Harry’s head and carding his fingers through Harry’s hair. Harry found it quite a nice place to relax when his brain began to fail from all the knowledge he was trying to cram in. Luckily enough, Draco had willingly helped him with Potions and Transfiguration – Harry would never admit to anyone that he usually offered rewards if Draco helped, that was to be kept between them – and now Harry felt quite confident with his classes. Of course, he still mucked around in Charms with Ron but some stern words from Lyra and Hermione had soon prodded them to start taking the class seriously.
Lyra mouthed ‘most preferable’ to herself slightly incredulously. “Right then,” she said aloud. “See you around, Potter.”
“Get to your dorm or the bathroom!” shouted Sarah. “Or grab some homework. Cast some cooling charms. You need to cover up the fact you’ve been running. Quick!”
She didn’t offer any other explanation and her friends just stared at her curiously before moving on.
he cooed, leaning down to pat her. She swiped at him and he laughed. “Honestly, I was expecting something larger.” Sarah hissed at him and he sat back on his heels, smirking. “We’re going to have to come up with a name for you,” he declared. “What about Whiskers?”
“It’s a wrench, giving it to you,” said Fred, “but we decided last night, you need’s greater than ours.”
Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and Sarah and Harry edged nearer so that they could catch Ernie’s words.
Sarah settled back against his chest and allowed her body to relax for the first time in a while. It was true that Sarah was probably working too much without stopping but she loved her job and wouldn’t change it for everything. Thankfully, Fred was always waiting at home with a hot meal and sweet kiss when she finished her long shifts.
Once Sirius had firmly closed the door behind him, Sarah closed her eyes and concentrated, trying to remember what it had felt like to transform all those months ago. With a jolting sensation, she dropped to the ground on her small white paws and meowed up at Sirius.
“Too fucking bad,” snapped Sarah. She marched into the room and Harry slammed the door behind her, grumbling under his breath. “So, this is where you’ve been hiding?” she said, observing Buckbeak the hippogriff and the half-eaten rats on the floor. “Thanks for that, by the way, do you know how
Bill took Dean and Luna to Muriel’s the first night and Sarah had been sad to see them go. It had been so good seeing her friends, despite the circumstances they were in. Fleur had forced Sarah and Hermione to stay in bed for hours at a time until they could both walk without assistance and the tremors in Sarah’s muscles had disappeared. At night, Sarah poured over the messy cuts let on her skin from Bellatrix’s knife and tried whatever she could to heal them with as little scarring as possible. Alas, no amount of dittany seemed to be making them go away.
“But what do you mean?” she said, frowning at them, her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. “Of course, you must not leave, you are safe ‘ere!”
“Oh, they definitely have,” Sarah nodded. “The number of times I ran out of a room because I saw them snogging…”
Draco couldn’t help the slight shiver that went through him at Harry’s proximity. He relaxed his grip on his quill slightly, not wanting to break it.
“The possessor the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it,” said Xenophilius. “Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of wizarding history.”
The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.
“But that’s your name, isn’t it?” Draco said. Harry was slightly astounded to realise that the blond was
“Fred will never replace you,” she promised. “You’ll always be the first person I turn to when I need to. I’m just lucky because now I have you
how many people asked if he was Chad Michael Murray,” Rosie snorted, barely getting the words out around her wild cackles. “Then he would open his mouth and they’d all practically
Sarah scoffed. “Draco can live without either of us for a few hours. And Fred and I don’t really spend that much time together, with classes and everything.”
“You’re going to teach Harry Occlumency?” Draco asked Snape, frowning slightly. “Is that the best idea? I mean, you two don’t get along and Occlumency can be very intrusive.”
“Because if you don’t do it now, you’ll never do it,” snapped Hermione. “And I won’t let you copy off mine.”
Somehow, the three of them made space on the tiny cot and managed to fall into a fitful sleep, tightly wound around each other and savouring the comfort it provided.
“Oh, Draco…” Harry held him as Draco finally let the tears out, his body shaking at the image of the small body, still warm even after its last breath had been taken. “I’m so sorry…”
Harry, Viktor and Mila eagerly agreed and dragged a slightly reluctant Sarah, Draco, Hermione and Aleksander with them.
But the Death Eater Hermione had just silenced made a slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione’s chest; she gave a tiny “oh!” as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless.
Draco just whimpered and coughed. A trickle of blood appeared at the side of his mouth and Sarah’s heart skipped a beat.
“The Dursleys never bothered to tell me I was a wizard, Dumbledore won’t tell me anything because I’m ‘too young’, no one was going to warn me about Sirius Black – “ he cut off suddenly and gave an angry huff. “Hell – even
“Polyjuice Potion, sir,” Harry said, smirking at Ron and Hermione. He sent a wink across in Sarah and Draco’s direction and they rolled their eyes.
“Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you. And you two must be Sarah Deaumont and Draco Malfoy – Molly told me you arrived yesterday, I’m sorry I couldn’t be there to greet you.”
?” said Professor McGonagall, turning around, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line.
“Look,” said Hermione, intervening swiftly as Neville pushed Sarah back down, “that’s really not what this meeting is supposed to be about – “
“Don’t let me hear you say that again, Malfoy,” Crabbe’s voice suddenly said. He, Goyle, Tracey Davis and Cassius Warrington were smirking at the three of them from further down the table. “Or I’ll put you in detention. You know what? I think I’ll take five points from Gryffindor for that comment. I’d take it from you if you weren’t in Slytherin but your boyfriend’s House will work fine.”
Sarah nodded and drew her wand gingerly again. Wracking her mind back to her lessons with Pomfrey, she cast a muscle relaxing spell and nearly cried with relief as the pain left her body. She shot one at each of her friends, who jumped first with shock and then relief. Harry came slowly back to them and groaned when he noticed their worried faces.
“If it’s that important to you, I’ll strive to call you ‘Harry’,” he said softly, not taking his eyes off his notes. “I can’t promise I won’t call you ‘Potter’ occasionally, though.”
“Be quiet,” said Snape coldly. “I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin’s lack of organisation.”
There was a loud slamming noise and everyone jumped. Hermione was standing by the window she had been staring at. She was holding something tight in her hand.
She watched him leave down the hall and then turned back to the others. It was only then that she realised one hand was still tightly clasped around the diadem. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as she looked at it closely she was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it:
“I know,” Lyra assured her. “But he let it happen. And Draco did as much as he could but sometimes – sometimes he wasn’t there. And despite that, I’m still grieving for the bastard. How is that fair?”
“ENOUGH!” Snape screamed. Immediately, the Hall fell silent as the students froze. “If the person who threw that hex is not in my office in ten minutes,” he continued in a deadly quiet whisper, “I will ensure that they are
him. He’s furious about this summer,” replied Draco furiously. “And not only me, but you too! Your father obviously helped him plan this.”
“I know babe,” Sarah replied, running a hand lightly throw his silky hair. “But I have too. I’ll be fine. If anything happens, I’ll get out of there and contact you – any of you,” she added, looking around the compartment at her worried friends.
“LET HIM GO!” shrieked Sarah, trying to catch the ferret but Moody kept moving him out of the way. “What are you
“And we learnt obviously learnt Bulgarian and Italian,” continued Sarah, listing them on her fingers. “Our tutors taught us Latin and Greek and we spent a few months in Germany a few years back so we know passable German.”
She was kneeling in the dirt of a large graveyard. Tombstones rose as far as she could see, with the largest a few metres before her, shrouded in deep shadow. Firelight flickered in her peripheral but she couldn’t see the source of the flames. She could feel her father standing behind her, one hand gripping her hair painfully and pulling her head upright. Spread out around them were over a dozen figures cloaked in black standing in a large semi-circle.
“We already thought about that!” Harry exclaimed angrily. “Draco warned me at breakfast. I was going to talk to Flitwick tomorrow.”
It was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned. Somebody (and Harry had a shrewd idea who) had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks.
Teddy clapped his hands happily. “And Draco can do the voices again!” he said with all the childish enthusiasm that he seemed to possess. “He does the best – better than you, Harry.”
…he knew I wanted to date you,” Harry revealed. “It’ll be fine, Draco. I promise. Anyway, it should just be Molly and Arthur – and Teddy, of course.”
Draco felt his face flush slightly. “Well,” he said primly, “I couldn’t just let you both wreak havoc on Hogwarts.”
“Yes, well not all of us are lucky enough to have a boyfriend like you, Theodore,” Pansy sniffed, sending a pointed glare at Blaise, who was too preoccupied trying to find something in his trunk to notice.
bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Draco was still standing blew up: the force of the explosions slammed him and Harry into the wall, the Cloak slipping off Harry. Sarah tumbled across the floor, her head smacking painfully into a chair corner before she slid to a stop.
Sarah nodded dazedly. Harry, however, smiled so brightly at Draco that the other boy couldn’t seem to do anything but smile in return. Harry then jumped toward his boyfriend and began snogging him so intensely that Sarah looked away. When it looked like the embrace was about to move in dangerous territory, Sarah cleared her throat and they jumped apart.
Lyra absentmindedly traced over her left forearm, the constellations standing out stark against the faded image of the Dark Mark. Even after nearly two decades, the brand had never fully faded. But that didn’t matter anymore, for new memories covered the old scar.
Ron and Hermione slipped away, the Marauder’s Map open before them. The rest of the Room’s occupants turned toward her and she awkwardly coughed.
“You know me!” There was resentment in the werewolf’s voice, “Fenrir Greyback! We’ve caught Harry Potter!”
“All right,” said Ron slowly, “let’s say we go for it tomorrow…I think it should just be me and Harry.”
“I don’t know, Hermione,” Draco said slowly, glancing at Sarah. “I think we would have heard something if Crabbe was saying anything like that.”
“Erm…” muttered Harry. “Well, I wasn’t expecting anything …”. He ran a hand through his messy hair, blushing slightly.
She pushed herself, with the help of Draco and Fred, into a sitting position and regarded Fudge with a stern glance.
“Of course,” Sarah said sincerely. “Harry, Draco and I would do anything to help you. We know you’d do the same for us.”
Lyra stood quickly, jamming her parchment and quills into her bag. She made eye contact with Harry across the classroom, his green eyes worried.
“House-elf magic is untraceable,” Hermione explained to Harry in response to his confused expression.
“Can you please make sure three spare bedrooms are prepared, as well as mine?” Sarah asked. “We’ll be staying here for the while but no one can know, okay?”
can find the ingredients and try and cook them into something safe to eat, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you – “
“We went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast. We decided to drop Muggle Studies.”
A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black travelling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swivelled toward the stranger, suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling. He lowered his hood, shook out a long man of grizzled, dark grey hair, and began to walk up to the teachers’ table.
“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.”
“I owe you an apology. It was stupid to use a spell I didn’t know. You could have died and it would have been my fault,” Harry said determinedly, staring at Draco as if daring him to argue.
Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire and with every right step he took, there was a loud
“It would be nice to see her,” she eventually said. “Maybe we could see if Pansy and Blaise wanted to join us with their parents?”
Within seconds the door flew open to reveal Sirius’s beaming face and Sarah was immediately swept into a bear hug that lifted her off the ground and brought her dangerously close to the doorjamb.
Draco only had a split second of horror to realise that Lyra’s eyes were filling with water before she burst into tears. He hastily embraced her and put her head on his shoulder, rubbing a hand down her back as she sobbed quietly into his chest.
He looked around for anyone to help him but Pansy and Theo had already finished dinner and Draco was sitting with Harry at the Gryffindor table. Realising he didn’t have any other options, he shifted so that he could scoop Sarah into his arms and stood from the table.
“I swear you two are both actually children,” Theo said with a smile, pressing a kiss to the back of Lyra’s neck.
“That is a serious accusation, Mr Malfoy,” Fudge spluttered, blotches of red appearing on his face. “Your father is acting with your best interests – “
He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way. Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp’s blood showered them as Harry pulled Sarah to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees. Once there, they looked back – Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran all down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing. As Sarah and Harry watched, Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged after them, smashing more trees aside as he went.
Sarah and Draco cooed at them in delight as Harry said weakly, “Is this the moment?” and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “OI! There’s a war going on here!”
“That’s incredibly mature,” Draco said sarcastically. “Punish the fifteen-year-old for making a mistake. Yes, very wise for a grown adult.”
Realising that the others were waiting for her, she put Harry’s broom in his trunk and pulled it out of the cupboard, shutting and locking the door behind her.
“Hermione pulled him aside to tell him off,” Harry stated, narrowly dodging a tall sixth year Ravenclaw with their head in a book.
“Okay, I’m sorry,” she said. “I’m just worried. I want to help but I think Snape’s lessons are just making it worse.”
Sarah stood up but before she left the room, she leant forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Sarah thought she saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as she closed the door behind her.
“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!”
It was during the final Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, that Sarah and the other found out why Hagrid had been constantly getting injured throughout the term. He had appeared during the start of the match and taken Sarah, Harry, Draco and Hermione into the forest, showing them his half-brother giant, Grawp. Hagrid asked them to take care of Grawp when he was inevitably fired by Umbridge. Like a total idiot, Harry agreed immediately, which led Draco to reluctantly agree and by default, Sarah and Hermione.
To ensure that no underage age student yields to temptation,” continued Dumbledore, “I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross the line.”
“No proof?” hissed Sarah. She took a step forward and Seamus took one back, his eyes darting to where his wand was lying on his bed. “Would you like to see the memories of that night? Or better yet, the scars that are still present?”
“Hopeless cause, that,” Draco scoffed. He was sitting in between Harry’s legs, leaning up against the other boy’s chest. They drew their legs up to let Sarah climb over them to sit in Fred’s lap.
After their conversation in the hospital wing, Sarah began to spend more time with the twins. She and Draco usually found themselves at the same table in the library with the pair, four heads buried in books. Draco had smirked widely at her when Sarah had told him the reasoning behind the new development.
“I said that if I had to talk about legislation for another hour today I’d probably quit and she’d lose the best Barrister she has,” Draco replied with a coy smile. “She was very willing to accept my terms.”
The parchment was no shining with drops of blood from the back of her hand, which was searing with pain. When she looked up next, night had fallen; Harry’s hand was in a similar shape to hers.
“Well, it – it screamed,” said Harry with a half glance at Ron. Sarah guessed that they were omitting something but she didn’t have enough energy to care. “Here.”
“He’s my godson, too,” Draco grumbled. “Anyway, he’s more your brother than godson, with how much you spoil him.”
As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Sarah saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then she saw Remus and Sirius, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout, “
Sarah sat in a shocked daze as Dumbledore and Fudge commenced an argument surrounding removing the dementors from Azkaban. How could he possibly dismiss the truth? Voldemort had finally returned and was only going to get stronger.
Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognise a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on the condition that she was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her.
But she was nowhere near him when it happened: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, most of them retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.
“Shhhh!” said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. “Don’ shout stuff like that, Harry, d’yeh wan’ me ter lose me job? Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d care, would yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag – “
“But you’re not a bad person now,” Teddy said determinedly. “Harry says so and so do I. I don’t think you can be a bad person if you look after animals.”
“Of course,” he replied with a crooked smile. “Couldn’t just let you fall to your death. Draco would have my balls.”
“A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely she would unravel them for several years.
She cried out in frustration and hit both her palms to his chest, only hard enough to make him sway slightly backwards.
Sarah looked up in surprise. “I’ve always been interested,” she admitted. “But I was also considering something to do with Alchemy.”
“Harry Potter used Gillyweed to great effect,” Bagman continued. “He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely own.
“Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said Dirk. “Couple of days later, once he’d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.”
Sarah looked up at Hermione’s worried shout. The girl was racing toward the Slytherin table, her brown eyes wild and red-rimmed.
Sarah looked down at her hand and groaned as she took in the blood staining her shirt sleeve and handkerchief.
Harry’s voice appeared above them and Sarah turned to see him smiling down at them, his eyebrow raised in question. She pushed Draco roughly across the seat to make room for Harry and quickly explained the dare she had given Blaise.
“Better not, mate,” Harry said, plucking the utensil out of Ron’s hand just as Mrs Weasley walked into the room, weighed down by various dishes.
“What kind of weapon is it?” said Umbridge harshly, her stubby fingers still tight on Sarah’s shoulders.
“Harry has been trying with his Occlumency,” she said into the darkness. “It’s been getting harder for him to control the visions recently. But he
“If you need somewhere safe to stay over the holidays, we know a place,” Draco had said softly to the other boy.
“Morning, Rosalyn,” Draco said as he stepped through the swinging doors. “You’re exceptionally bright this morning.”
“I do not understand all their resentment,” Aleksander said one lunchtime while they reclined near the lake. They had avoided the Great Hall after an article by Rita Skeeter had been published, in which she only talked about Harry and barely mentioned the other champions. “They are all being petty – they should be supporting
Draco studied the face, familiar despite the swelling. If it weren’t for the bright, green eyes staring back at him, Draco would have thought that Potter was nearly unrecognisable.
Rosie. That’s Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron’s daughter but she’s a baby so she doesn’t do much – “ Teddy hardly paused for breath and Draco quickly interrupted him gently.
Overall, the meeting was quite uninformative. Harry was able to ask questions about their overall goals but Mrs Weasley cut Sirius off from answering too much. Moody refused to say anything more apart from getting updates from various members. When they were dismissed, Sarah and the others trudged up to Draco and Harry’s room, which had become the designated meeting room.
“She had only recently completed an arranged marriage with Antonius Deaumont, and he had ties to known or suspected Death Eaters, especially Lucius Malfoy – she didn’t want to risk her friends, so she cut herself out of their lives to keep them safe,” Professor McGonagall explained.
” she said, pointing her wand at Sarah, who cried out in pain as she slashed open a deep cut on her ribs. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Sarah, my hand’s shaking!”
“What’s done?” demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed Sarah's shoulders again and shook her slightly. “What’s done, girl?”
She skidded around the corner, her shoes slippery with blood; Draco and Harry had an immense head start, and that wasn’t even including Snape and Crabbe. Was it possible they had already gotten away? Or had the Order taking steps to prevent escape? She could hear nothing but her own pounding feet, her own hammering heart as she sprinted along the next empty corrido, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors –
“I guess you’re right,” he admitted. “I do feel tempted to go down there and strangle that hag with my own two hands.”
“Just good time management,” Draco said distractedly. “Sarah, is this correct?” He pointed at a line of rune translation for her to check.
“Er – what are you - ?” Ron said tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Sarah and Harry.
“Luckily, Minerva has given be Floor access in my office to Grimmauld Place,” Remus continued, as though there had been no interruption. “I’ll come home each night instead of staying at Hogwarts and she can still contact me if needed.”
Fred followed her out of the room and the last thing she saw before the door swung shut behind her was Draco and Harry sitting on Harry’s bed, arms wrapped around each other.
Now knowing where to go, the three of them, plus Hagrid and Fang, began to run as fast as they could for the entrance to the Room of Requirement. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armour and cloaks, cramming themselves into each other’s canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook and Sarah knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order.
“Yeah, it’s only been like two hours, Lyra. You can’t leave yet,” Harry added, successfully stealing one of Draco’s many snacks. Her brother glowered at his boyfriend and angrily stuffed a pastry into his own mouth.
“I’m not marrying anyone,” Draco sighed. “I’m hoping that mother will give up soon. Andromeda has been a good influence on her.”
Sarah smiled brightly again and watched as Fred’s eyes gleamed even brighter. She kissed him deeply and climbed on top of him, wrapping her arms around him tightly. She hadn’t been this happy in forever and she never wanted to let that feeling go.
Harry flushed at these words but didn’t offer an explanation. Sarah and Draco sighed and began packing their stuff up. It would not do to get detention just because the caretaker is a cranky old geezer.
“We need to keep an eye on him,” Draco said as they walked down the corridor in the opposite direction to Harry.
“Argus, good…” said Umbridge. “You two,” she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, “are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.”
“Yes, but it’s been longer since I’ve last seen Harry and Fred,” Narcissa said, hugging them all. “You’re all so busy these days.”
“No, you can’t,” disagreed Sarah without looking at him. “I have too much blackmail on you.” She turned back to the waiting groups. “When I call out your name, get in the air. You’ll have fifteen minutes to prove whether I should pick you for the team or not. We need new Beaters, a Keeper and two Chasers.”
“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,” said George, in a good imitation of Percy’s most pompous manner. “Now let’s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters’ll be taken.”
Until that point, Sarah hadn’t registered the heavy bandages covering her abdomen and right forearm. She tugged absently at them.
“Five points from Slytherin for your language, Miss Parkinson,” Snape snapped from the head table, scowling darkly.
“It’ll be okay, Sarah,” promised Draco. “I doubt he’ll be up in the Minister’s Box with us – you won’t need to see him.”
“Whatever would your aunt say?” Moody said softly, but the room was so silent that the entire class could hear his words.
“She loves you too, Ted,” Remus said, smiling knowingly at Sarah. “Just make sure to be careful when you’re eating. I don’t want you getting food all over the two of you.”
Sarah watched as his face crumpled. She took out her wand and crouched down in front of the grave. A bouquet of white apple blossoms appeared from the end of her wand and she gently lay them on the against the headstone.
“I just don’t know what to do,” Lyra’s voice was incredibly small, her body curling around herself as if to hide away forever.
“But why sack Hagrid now?” asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head. “It’s not like Trelawny, he’s been teaching much better than usual this year!”
later that Sarah kicked Hermione out of her room and collapsed into an exhausted sleep on the bed, her mind full of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles and Decoy Detonators.
There was a gentle knock on the door. Sarah looked around, chalk raised; Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati and Dean had arrived.
“Harry and Draco caught the fish and I did my best with it!” snapped Sarah. “I notice I’m always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a
“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius, “you are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.”
Snape clicked his tongue and spread out a variety of pamphlets on his desk. His demeanour changed slightly from ‘Professor Snape’ to ‘Severus’.
They lay there for a while longer, Draco idly tracing patterns on Harry’s back. At one point, Harry reached over to grab his wand to clean them up but settled against Draco again when he was done.
Lyra withdrew and smiled reassuringly at Mrs Weasley. “It’s all right, Mrs Weasley,” she said. “It’s the past and right now we need to focus on the future. The battle isn’t over, but we all need to remain strong.”
Harry listen to it all with a blank expression on his face, his grip on Sarah’s hand never lessening.
“Come now, Draco,” he said. “Take a closer look. We have to be entirely sure before we call the Dark Lord…”
“But then…do you mean…” said Hermione slowly, and Sarah could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of scepticism out of her voice, “that you believe these objects – these Hallows – actually exist?”
There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin’s head was lengthening. So was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks’s hair was on end again; he was backing away –
Sarah was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday’s rain had cleared; the sky was a brilliant, pale grey which matched Draco’s eyes, and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first-ever Care of Magical Creatures class.
“It’s not Potter I’m worried about,” Lyra interrupted. “It’s the rest of the Weasleys. Blaise, we put their son in the hospital wing – he nearly died because of us! And we’ve tormented their family for years.”
“Honestly, I feel like this happens at least once a year,” Draco observed, running his fingers through Harry’s curls. “Someone fights, Ron and Hermione stop talking to each other, and then we all separate trying to keep ourselves sane.”
“He didn’t even do anything wrong,” cried Sarah. “Crabbe threw that hex. Draco was just behind him and rushed forward with his wand out – but Moody changed them both. And he didn’t listen when I told him Draco had been trying to help.”
“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Crabbe, flipping the paper over and holding it up. “A picture of your parents outside their house – if you can call it a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn’t she?”
“I was so worried,” Draco sobbed, gripping Harry tightly. “But you did amazingly. I’ve never seen you fly like that before.”
“No, I don’t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,” said Remus, “but that does not mean that there won’t be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and – and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on.”
“I have to say I agree,” Remus said, rolling his eyes fondly at Sirius. “You shouldn’t have to be involved.”
“Well, I better go see what Bill wants,” Remus said. He dropped a kiss to Sirius’ dark head and squeezed Sarah’s shoulder once before leaving.
“Draco! You have to come in. Please. I don’t know what went wrong. I need you here now!” Rosie’s voice was frantic and it sounded as though she was sobbing.
Narcissa’s house-arrest was nearly over and she would soon be able to escape from the various past-times she had picked up in the last three years.
“Looks better than your first attempt,” came Fred’s teasing voice, a second before he dropped a light kiss to the top of her hair. “Well done.”
“She’s right,” he said. He hadn’t loosened his grip on Harry’s arm. “We need a distraction if we’re going to try to contact Sirius. They can help with that.”
He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly wood still, just, connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. Sarah hoped for Harry’s sake that she was wrong.
Once they had finished opening their gifts – interrupted occasionally by impromptu snogging bouts – they made their way down to the kitchen where Sirius, Remus, Sarah, Hermione and, unsurprisingly, Fred all sat.
“Oh, thank you,” she said to them both, blushing slightly. The blush only increased as Fred pressed a kiss to her cheek.
“Where were you this morning?” Draco asked as he sat beside Sarah at the Gryffindor table. “I checked your room but you weren’t there.”
“I hope so,” Harry sighed. He took his arm off the back of the couch and placed it around Draco’s shoulders, squeezing tightly.
“Enough, darling,” Narcissa interrupted Draco. “I have made up my mind. It’s not like we can’t visit each other. I’m going to the Continent, not dying.”
!” Sarah said in awe. “If you keep doing things like this, Harry, I might just start a fan club for you.”
Sarah listening in muted exhaustion as Harry explained how Snape had given him memories to view when he died. He described how Snape and Lily had been friends as children, but as they grew older, slowly grew apart, both ending up on different sides of a war. Then Harry explained how Dumbledore had known Harry was a Horcrux, that a piece of Voldemort had lived inside him ever since Voldemort had tried to kill him. It meant that in order for Voldemort to be truly defeated, Harry had to die.
Feeling smug that she had managed to bring Harry out of his disappointed mood, she wrapped up another roll and pulled him to his feet.
At last, she found the tiny bottle and drew it out with a cry of triumph. The others crowded around her and she realised just how bad they all looked. They all had angry red burns over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in places. Sarah quickly cast some spells and dabbed essence of dittany on them before doing herself and sighing in relief. Hermione pulled out five bottles of pumpkin juice and clean, dry clothes for all of them. They changed and then gulped down the juice.
“You already said that Draco was better at makeup than you,” Hermione said easily. “And I trust him more with my hair as well. You sometimes look related to Harry by how messy your hair gets.”
From inside his cloak, Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry seemed to understand the rest of the plan immediately.
“It seems that Blaise has somehow managed to insult Bill’s gnome-throwing abilities,” Lyra explained. “Ron and Hermione appear to have started taking score.”
“So, what made you decide to open a muggle clinic?” she asked as she poured them both a generous glass.
When their group crossed through the barrier between platforms nine and ten, they found a surprise waiting for them: Remus was waiting alongside Tonks, Mad-Eye Moody and Mrs Weasley, with Sirius leaning against his boyfriend, smirking at the teenagers.
“I don’t know why Fred waits for you,” Pansy said to Sarah as the boy in question made eye contact with his girlfriend, his face lighting up. “You don’t even share the same class.”
Harry's laughter echoed around the deserted alleyway as Draco gripped his arm, Apparating them away to a nearby street close to Rosie and Naomi’s apartment.
This lesson; however, turned out quite differently to others. It began as boring as ever until Hermione suddenly put her hand up.
“I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was you’d been caught.”
“I’m sure it is,” said Draco, his eyes upon the church. “They…They’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mother and father? I can see the graveyard behind it.”
Sarah nodded and sighed in relief as the pain in her arm lessened. She moved in experimentally and found that whilst it still hurt, it was bearable. She could hear Madam Hooch and Draco shouting at Warrington not too far away.
” Draco repeated. His silver eyes were suddenly hard and steely and Blaise noted that the other boy had drawn his wand. “Where is he?”
Sarah cocked her head. “Do you know anyone available off the top of your head that wouldn’t mind being a rebound shag?”
“I need to talk to Hermione,” she announced. She kissed Fred quickly before forcing her way through the crowd.
And Sarah had little choice but to follow him into another lift, feeling the eyes of the others burning into her retreating back.
“It was more that neither of us let the other kill him,” corrected Draco. “We both wanted to kill him individually.”
Mrs Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bill’s wounds with a most curious expressions upon her face. Nobody said anything; Sarah hardly dared to move. Like everyone else, she was waiting for the explosion.
Warrington scowled at her and turned back to sneering at the Gryffindor team who was currently using the pitch for practice.
“I didn’t think!” whisper-cried Harry. “But that’s not the point here, Sarah. I…I saw my dad and he wasn’t, well, he was a bully.”
“I do,” said Harry, and he explained briefly about how Crabbe had fixed a Vanishing Cabinet which had a pair at Borgin and Burkes. “So they got in through the Room of Requirement.”
Harry ran his uninjured hand through his hair and shook his head. “I have no idea,” he said. “She’s evil enough but I don’t know if she could be a Death Eater…”
“But it can’t hurt you if someone throws something at you,” said Harry, reasonably. “I mean, it’d just go right through you, wouldn’t it?”
Mr Weasley was shaking hands with Amos Diggory, a ruddy-faced wizard who worked in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Sarah and Draco had met him a few times through Lucius’ work at the Ministry.
The five of them hurriedly wrapped themselves in the cloak and with last hopeful utterances, set off toward the castle. They started up the sloping lawn. The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west, there was a ruby-red glow.
“You shouldn’t throw it out, Sirius,” Sarah said, indicating the tapestry. “Kreacher’s right about one thing, it’s got a lot of history on it.”
“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing Goyle’s mother’s face when he gets off the train,” said Ernie with some satisfaction, as he watched Goyle squirm above him.
The corridor she was a shortcut to the library from the dungeons. No doors lined the walls, only stain-glass windows which reflected the tapestries on the opposite wall.
“Miss Malfoy has revealed that you both want to free yourselves of the task you have been forced to complete by Voldemort,” Dumbledore stated calmly.
“Chin up, Coco. It’s just Harry,” Lyra said with a smile as Draco stalked over to the only free seat.
“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of
“Hermione, I’m fine – “ Sarah gasped, trying and failing not to inhale swatches of Hermione’s bushy hair. “But I might not be soon if you continue suffocating me.”
They stayed sitting in silence for another hour before Harry uncurled himself and stood up. He reached down a hand to help Sarah to her feet and said, “We might as well go down now before Draco breaks down the door and kills me.”
But now the first task loomed before them. Harry had been a shaking mess at breakfast and not even a walk around the lake with Draco had calmed him down.
“I’ll tell you later,” he said, brushing the questions away. “Let’s go, I want to see Ha – everyone.”
They continued in this manner for a few minutes before a loud voice shouted outside the door, “Oi! Are you two lovebirds done
“All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to protect you all from something much worse…We all know what Black’s capable of…”
“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!” Mrs Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms. Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger.
He fell silent, gulping his tea. Sarah, Draco and Harry watched him breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before. After a pause, Sarah said timidly, “Is it awful in there, Hagrid?”
“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You need to get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He’s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don’t owe him anything.”
She turned to Sirius with a contemplative look on her face. “It’s been updating itself, Sirius. Do you know what that means?”
“Harry, if I had an issue with it, I would tell you,” Draco interrupted gently. “Who knows, maybe Teddy can show me those favourite books of his.” He smiled softly and then turned to leave. Just before he reached the gate, he looked back at Harry and waved.
“Most of our families are arseholes,” Pansy declared. “I’d love nothing more than to curse my bastard of a father.”
“Sarah has been extremely ill recently and the cold is detrimental to her recovery,” Draco lied smoothly. “The party has been riveting, though.”
At some point, Sarah and Neville got separated as they were buffeted into the entrance hall: she was searching for Draco and saw him across the room, Sirius beside him, both firing spells as quickly as they could. Flashes of spell light blinded her as she fought her way through the crowd toward them, knocking people back with both her fists and wand.
Draco stopped struggling and the four of them stood in shock, looking at Harry, who was standing above Crabbe with a murderous look on his face, green eyes shining brightly behind his glasses.
Sarah’s hands were clammy as she clasped them tightly in her lap. The quiet sound of Fred’s voice echoed across the large, open field, even the birds and insects had remained silent today.
Whispers followed the pair but they ignored them, falling heavily into the seats opposite Pansy and Blaise.
An indiscernible amount of time later, she heard the door open and felt the side of her mattress dip. Draco remained silent as she flung herself at him, sobbing into his chest. He stroked a calming hand up and down her back and let her cry in a way she hadn’t since her mother’s death.
Sarah was dragged backwards by a rough hand at her neck. She kicked and screamed against her captor, who just laughed and continued to haul her toward the dais.
“It’s not school work,” she said as she cleared her plate and departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred.
“You’re hiding from everyone because you think you’re a danger to us,” she said evenly. “I’m guessing that before you came up here you began to panic pack, thinking that the best thing to do would be to run away?”
“That’s surprising,” he muttered, walking slowly toward Draco and Sarah’s group. “A Malfoy calling out to stop suffering.”
“Of course you did,” muttered Ron, as Terry Boot said, “Ravenclaw’s was supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.”
“Don’t worry, darling,” he said reassuringly. “Mother has been saying the same thing to me and Harry. She keeps mentioning surrogacy and muggle clinics, if you can believe it.”
“They’d be suffering together!” Fred exclaimed, turning to look at her. His hairdresser tutted and Fred moved his head back into position. “Doesn’t mean
Leave your thoughts below! If you have any suggestions or recommendations, feel free to chuck them in.
Ron nodded hurriedly and Sarah turned her back on him. Draco had taken a seat beside Harry on the bed and was holding his hand tightly. The pair were smiling shyly at each other.
Fred led her over to a table close to the top table and held her chair out for her. She smiled gratefully at him as George and Angelina, Pansy and Millicent, Theo and Daphne, Lee and Katie, and Blaise and, to everyone’s surprise, Luna, joined them at the table. Ron had joined a table with the other Gryffindor boys and their dates.
It happened immediately: Sarah felt as though a hook just behind her navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. Her feet left the ground; she could feel Draco and Fred on either side of her, their shoulders banging into hers; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling colour; her forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then –
Draco wordlessly handed his results to Harry but Sarah just let out a great breath and said, “I got ‘Outstandings’ for everything…”
Draco growled and stepped forward but was interrupted by Lavender Brown squealing, “Ooooooh!”, in a high-pitched voice.
“What about the others…?” Sarah said quietly, looking helplessly at Draco as he wrapped an arm around her shoulders. “Viktor…Mila…Aleksander?”
Hermione frowned. “He may have wanted your blood,” she said suddenly. Sarah blinked at her in surprise and she added, “You have Potter blood in you technically, very diluted mind you, but it’s still there. Maybe Voldemort thought it would enhance whatever he wanted to achieve if he used your blood as well. In the end, it didn’t matter.”
“Well, it took you long enough,” Lyra said. “I swear, if I had to hear one more thing from either of you, I was going to lock you in a room until you shagged and figured it all out.”
fault Harry attracts trouble!” he said indignantly. “Most of the time he doesn’t even actively go looking for it!”
“I ‘spect he’s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,” said Hagrid. “But he doesn’ know who that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they’d’ve bin caught, wouldn’ they? Wha’ worries me,” said Hagrid, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder, “is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein’ attacked. Chamber o’ Secrets all over again, isn’ it? There’ll be panic, more parents takin’ their kids outta school, an’ nex’ thing yeh know the board o’ governors’ll be talkin’ about shuttin’ us up fer good.”
A voice suddenly sounded from behind Blaise and Pansy. Sarah looked up to see Professor Umbridge glaring down at her.
“Did you mean what you said the other day?” Draco was lounging against the counter this time, watching as Harry reorganised a nearby shelf.
“Has anyone been in contact with him that’s recently had a sick pet?” Draco jotted down the temperature and heartbeat of the cat and felt around its stomach for the presence of any foreign objects.
“I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once,” Griphook told them, “on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected…” He turned to Sarah and Draco. “Both your family vaults are beside the Lestranges’.”
Lyra beamed into the kiss and pulled the curtains of the four-poster bed closed, blocking out Draco’s complaints.
“We don’t have any choice,” she whispered, her words quiet enough that Draco nearly missed them. “What can we do?”
“Oh, so did he suddenly turn into a girl?” Sirius said innocently. “I don’t think Harry would like that very much.”
“We’ll see,” she told him, pecking his lips again briefly. “But let’s maybe head down before we get caught snogging in a tree by my brother or mother.”
“Nonsense,” Blaise said, waving a hand in front of them. “You and Draco have always been too pessimistic.”
“Because ‘e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!”
Potter hesitated for a moment before striding through the doorway. Rosie sat at her desk, chomping happily on a filled bagel but paused when Potter appeared, pale eyes widening slightly.
“Wow, we were up there for nearly four hours,” she said in surprise. They had started working at nine that morning.
“I’m not sorry we didn’t tell you,” she said, staring defiantly at the two boys. “It was the right decision to make. We’re just going to make sure we don’t get detention again.”
“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll torture us for a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.”
He was sitting in front of the dark fireplace in the sitting room, holding Teddy’s hands and waving them up and down gently as the little boy giggled in delight.
They followed the crowd to the doors and found themselves reaching them at the exact same moment as the majority of the Durmstrang students, Karkaroff at the lead.
Harry hummed in agreement and held back a smile. Maybe this room-sharing business wouldn’t be so bad after all.
The four of them gazed at each other; Sarah felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalisingly close. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told Harry? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realised it at the time?
“Detention, Weasley,” Snape said silkily, his face hard as stone. “And if I ever hear you criticise the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.”
A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in Harry’s direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore.
“Sirius Black?” Sarah said suddenly, straightening from where she had been rummaging through her books.
The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself that to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.
“How did you - ?” Hermione started and then sighed. “Actually, no, I’m not surprised you figured it out.”
“We’ll send a letter to Remus and Sirius tomorrow,” Sarah said, pulling a piece of parchment toward her. “They should definitely know about this.”
Mrs Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle.
Draco’s face soured at the mention of the Dursleys and he resolutely said, “It’s decided then. We’ll teach you to ice-skate.”
“I just want to know what he’s doing,” Harry said. “I checked the map once and he wasn’t on it. Only Hogsmeade doesn’t show up.”
“It is nearly time,” she said. “Please follow your Heads of Houses out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.”
Cries of “Happy Birthday!” and “Surprise!” bombarded them as they stepped through the door into the living room.
Professor Umbridge gaped at her as she stood and slung her bag over her shoulder. Before she left, she marched up to the teacher’s table and said to Dumbledore, “Your wards didn’t work, Professor. My father managed to send me a letter. I’d appreciate it if you fixed that.”
Half an hour later, there was a knock on the front door. Sarah looked at the two boys as they listened to Remus go answer it. Draco led the way back downstairs where laughter met their ears. Lounging upon the limited furniture where a group of familiar faces: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favourite shade of bright pink; Kingsley, bald and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy basset hound’s eyes and matted hair. Sarah’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight of them.
“You cannot be serious,” she told him. “Potter. Harry. Just, just talk to Draco, okay? That’s all I’ll say.”
Fred leant down and pressed a kiss to her neck, slowly but surely creating a mark that Sarah knew wouldn’t heal for a few days.
“Lyra, what do you need to talk about?” Potter interrupted, ignoring the glare Lyra sent his way. “You said it was urgent.”
“I’ll leave it be for now,” she told him. “But I do think you’ll be surprised. And remember,” she added, pulling back and looking him stern in the eye, “if you ever feel like telling me what happened, I’ll never judge you. I've got your back, Draco.”
Harry’s seventeenth birthday finally arrived. The occupants of the Burrow had a subdued celebration, all subconsciously understanding what this moment meant: Harry was now old enough to leave if he felt like it. Sarah knew that Draco had been threatening Harry with a variety of horrid things if the other boy even
“I should not be listening to this,” Draco declared calmly as he ate the bacon roll Sarah had prepared for him. “As a Prefect, I cannot endorse any illegal activity.”
“Right now, anything is better than how I’m feeling,” Blaise said, sighing in relief when the potion began to work. “Did we miss anything interesting last night?”
The pair left and when they stepped into the entrance hall, Ron immediately turned toward her and blurted, “I’m really sorry for being such a git.”
“Scary Draco!” cried Teddy, laughing excitedly. For some reason, scary Draco was one of Teddy’s favourites. Sarah would never understand how that kid’s mind worked. She rolled her eyes exaggeratedly at Remus and Sirius as she walked toward the other group, the pair smirking at her in response.
Sarah clicked her tongue disapprovingly. “Now, now, that’s no way to speak to your dear friend.” She stood up. “Grumpy old git,” she added with a smirk while lunging forward and pushing Draco off the bed, covers and all.
It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered, now, from the bustling place Sarah was so familiar with. More shops than ever were boarded-up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since her last visit. Harry’s face glared down at them from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words
Nearly everything in the room was a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Posters of all shapes and sizes were covering every inch of the shabby wallpaper. They all displayed the players in Ron’s favourite Quidditch team: the Chudley Cannons.
Draco pushed open the glass door of his clinic and flicked the lights on. The sterile, pale blue room was exactly as he had left it the day before but he still went through the routine checks of the front room. His routine had not changed since he had opened the clinic a year ago, finally using the money his mother had given him when he left home at the end of the war.
He turned to her with a sigh. “I’m sorry I snapped at lunch, they’re just been driving me spare all day.”
“Sarah! Draco! Wait!” he called after them as they ran into the crowd. Guests were sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken.
She raced forward and jumped at her godfathers, grasping them both tightly as they swayed to keep their balance.
Sarah cringed as Harry read through the horrid article, which included reference to Harry’s scar hurting during his last Divination lesson, one where he had had a nightmare and had left the classroom. It also quoted Crabbe talking about Harry’s ability to speak Parseltongue. Overall, it was an attempt to discredit him and make him seem crazy and unpredictable.
Sirius laughed. “Unfortunately, none of that,” he smirked. “Although, I’d love to see Fudge’s face if someone said he wasn’t allowed to wear another bowler hat in his life.”
Sarah immediately saw Fred, Harry and Viktor waiting in the crowd. She smiled brightly as their jaws dropped in unison and they all began to blink quickly and rub their eyes.
“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of ‘em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!”
, in his words.” Draco scoffed and shook his head. “I intend on being friendly with the foreign students but not to spin his
“Not messing about, Molly, dear,” said Mr Weasley imploringly. “It was just – just something Pye and I thought we’d try – only, most unfortunately – well, with these particular kinds of wounds – it doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped – “
“Harry, the rumours are ridiculous. Only idiots are actually believing them,” she assured. “Hey Draco, did you talk about the similarities between the Assembly and the Greek and Roman consulates?” she asked, searching blindly for the book she had seen on the table.
”, and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulling out his wand and yelling, “You’ll pay for that one!” and pointed it at Higgs’ face.
“Indeed I am, young Mr Malfoy,” Fudge said, wiping the sweat off his brow. “It was such a shame to hear you were injured. Your father did the right thing, bringing it to the attention of the Committee. We can’t have dangerous beasts running around can we!”
Sarah fell heavily onto soft sand and only barely glimpsed Draco’s pale face above her before she passed out.
“You’re okay,” said Fred’s voice in a soothing tone. “Just breathe, Sarah. Slowly – in and out – that’s it.”
“We didn’t want to leave without you and Lyra,” Pansy said. “But then it became obvious that the students were losing…”
To Sarah’s complete and utter shock, Harry managed to get them all the way up to the Fat Lady’s portrait without once risking their perfectly formed skulls. The Fat Lady peered down at them curiously but swung open when Harry panted out the password.
Harry raised his eyebrows at his boyfriend and said, quite slowly and seriously, “You literally refused to speak to me for
“Seat a hundred thousand,” said Mr Weasley proudly. “Ministry task force of five hundred have been working all year on it. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they’ve suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again…bless them,” he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.
“Exactly,” said Hermione. “And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we’d had our conversation by the lake. And unless I’m very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the say your scar hurt. She’s been buzzing around for stories all year.”
“No,” Draco said softly, “I asked Harry the same thing after he found out about Black. He said that no one had asked him that yet – always asking if he was okay.”
She noticed Draco sitting at the Slytherin table, so she veered toward there instead of the Gryffindor table.
“Draco’s a big boy, he can take care of himself,” Lyra assured him. “Besides, he’s got Pansy with him and she wouldn’t let anyone without a foot of him.”
Sarah had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Draco, Pettigrew and Ron went next, awkwardly hobbling sideways. Next came Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, help up by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione followed behind them and Sarah and Lupin brought up the rear.
And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider’s web from the point that Fred’s wand had touched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:
Draco raised his hand to get the bartender’s attention. After another glass of whatever random concoction Pansy was feeding him was safely in his hands, he said again, “Why the fuck did I do that?”
“Don’t worry, Malfoy, you’ll never truly lose that,” Nott called from across the room where he was sitting with Daphne.
,” muttered Hermione. “McLaggen makes Grawp look like a gentleman. Let’s go this way, we’ll be able to see him coming, he’s so tall…”
Sarah said down beside him and leant her head on his shoulder. “I don’t know either, Harry,” she sighed. “But I know that Sirius and Remus have been fighting him every day. Anyway, Draco and I already have a plan. It might just mean that you have to spend a few days with those horrid people – then you’ll be with us.”
“The Death Eater’s scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they know they’ve got to join him.”
The farewells echoing around them were cut off when Harry closed the carriage door behind them. They began to struggle down the corridor, their heavy trunks floating behind them awkwardly, avoiding the inquisitive faces that peered up at them from behind glass compartment doors.
“No, no,” she assured Teddy. “Not any time soon. I guess I walked into that one,” she added to Remus in an undertone.
, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy – Antonius, come back here, we need to organise! We’ll split into pairs and search, and don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy, you can kill the others is necessary – except Draco, bring him to me! Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right – Mulciber, Dolohov, the door straight ahead – Macnair and Avery, through here – Rookwood, over there – Antonius, come with me!”
‘I’d love to!” she said. “I probably wouldn’t have been able to go back to Draco’s anyway, my father would have planned for that. I was planning on going to the Leaky Cauldron again or the Weasleys.”
“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while…”
“I bet you Harry and the others are just out playing in the snow,” Lyra said wistfully, craning her neck to peer out of the frost-covered glass. “Do you think we can afford to take a quick break? It looks lovely out there.”
“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Remus, then hesitated slightly. “And I’d tell him to trust his friends. They are the strongest allies he has with him.”
They walked for a few hours. Harry, at Draco’s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which seemed deserted.
Harry tiredly smiled at her and leant against her as Madam Pomfrey finished cleaning his wound and wrapping it.
“I can’t stay mad at you for long,” she admitted, brushing back his damp fringe. “Especially not when you look so bloody sad.”
Fred and George were standing in the middle of the entrance hall, smirking up at Professor Umbridge, who was standing on the marble staircase and smiling cruelly down at them.
“You’re Head Boy, Draco!” Sarah continued, her loud voice echoing in the empty common room. All the other eighth years had disappeared when she had stormed in a few minutes earlier, dragging Draco by the ear with Harry following them. “Of all the stupid, brainless,
Professor McGonagall matched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there.
Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing unblinkingly at Ron over the top of the magazine, which turned out to be
“If I’m going to be completely honest,” she said in a whisper to Remus as they made their way outside where Bill and Arthur had sent up a group of tables, “I may have eaten some of my anger away at the Manor and haven’t recovered. Do you think Molly will notice?”
They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Sarah sent a great cascade of fake Galleons on to the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the flowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Sarah’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling. Suddenly, Draco let out a shout.
Speechless, Harry and Sarah carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. As they turned a corner, they saw Ron dashing toward them, grinning ear to ear.
“Ginny,” said Ron. “You don’t know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally – “
“Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as Ron, Draco and Sarah opened their mouths to shout back across the road. “Look, this will do, in here!”
“Yes – my Lord, that is true – but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact with not only the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.”
Sarah just rolled her eyes. If she kept that up her eyes were just going to roll out of her head one day.
“Pants…off…” Sarah panted, reaching down to the button. His trousers, pants and socks followed quickly, as well as Sarah’s skirt and underwear. The small space was filled with soft pants and gasps as they moved, skin on skin.
“Exactly what I said!” Lyra exclaimed. “Shit!” She quickly regained her balance, the branch swinging wildly beneath her.
“Harry, I need you to listen to me and listen closely, okay?” Draco waited until Harry had nodded before continuing. “You have every right to be angry. You lost your parents, your chance at a normal childhood. And now, the man responsible for that is after you. Feeling anger to that degree does not make you the same as him. He killed people Harry – you could never do that. You are a good person.”
,” she said dryly. “He may be a right bastard but somewhere deep down in that thing he calls a soul he actually cares about what happens to Draco and me.”
The Hall broke into applause. Sarah, Draco, Mila and Aleksander clapped loudly for Viktor as he got to his feet and made his way to down the staff table and disappeared into the other room.
Harry didn’t question Slughorn again over the next few days. The Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, appeared to have put the entire matter from his mind. Sarah continued to confirm to him that no invitations had been given for Slughorn’s next party. Draco began to brainstorm with Harry different ways to get Slughorn to give up the original memory.
Draco returned with a large basket and the trio made their way around the display of treats, with Sarah following Harry’s silent directions. She picked up a few packets of Sugar Quills for herself and Draco and also a large selection of strawberry and apple liquorice. Once they had finished, the turned to leave but Draco suddenly steered them to the opposite wall.
Draco watched Sarah nervously all through dinner. While the news wasn’t as heart-wrenching to her as it was to Harry, Draco could tell that something was troubling her.
“The worst?” said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity. “Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?”
Their money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents. Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and Mr Weasley was carrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold.
“I agree with Sarah,” Draco said. “Maybe Grawp is different, I don’t know – sometimes you get outliers. But giants aren’t something we should be messing with.”
“Better out than in,” Hagrid said cheerfully as he steered Ron into a large chair, handing a copper bucket to him. “Get ‘em all up, Ron.”
“Gin!” Sarah said, rolling her eyes. “Honestly, you act as though you don’t have a girlfriend sitting right there.”
“There are the Wrackspurt siphons – to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker’s immediate area. Here,” he pointed out the tiny wings, “a Billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally,” he pointed to the orange radish, “the Dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.”
Hermione frowned at her. “And you know how much I disagree with slave labour,” she said haughtily, descending into her usual lecture.
“Consequences?” Harry said in disbelief. “What? That nonsense Snape told you? You’re being stupid – your father can't touch anyone here. You’re just too afraid to stand up for the right thing.”
“I’m sorry I shouted,” he apologised. His warm brown eyes were watching her intently. “I just hated the fact that she hurt you. I shouldn’t have yelled at you, though.”
is obsessing about it. This leads me to my next point: you are not the weapon he’s after.” Harry frowned but let her keep talking. “What he wants is obviously somewhere in the Ministry and the Order is guarding it. That’s what Mr Weasley was doing and Sturgis Podmore, remember? The guy who got arrested for trying to get into a locked door in a restricted area of the Ministry? I think the Order is protecting either the entrance to the object or the object itself.”
“Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk heavily. “With the whole of the Ministry and all of their informers looking for him I’d have expected him to be caught by now. Not to mention the resources looking for the Malfoy boy and Deaumont girl.”
“We’ll never fit through here together,” Sarah whispered. “I’ll change my appearance and you can follow me in the cloak, okay?” Harry nodded so Sarah concentrated quickly on darkening and shortening her hair, also changing her facial features slightly.
More footsteps cut them off and they turned to see a dejected Harry and Ron appear around the corner.
Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned for them to sit down. She settled herself behind her desk, while Professor Snape lurked behind her, half-cloaked in shadow, and said abruptly, “Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you tow were taken ill on the train,” nodding her head at Sarah and Harry.
“The only regret I have is not saving you sooner,” Harry whispered against Draco’s lips. The other boy shivered and pressed closer to Harry.
Dumbledore looked unperturbed. “Regardless, this is simply to eliminate any possible contact. You are, of course, allowed to decline,” he added with a slight smile.
“Try again?” she clarified. She caught his gaze and saw the way that his eyes lit up in interest and question.
“Yep,” said Lyra, following his gaze and catching Snape’s eye. The Professor glared at her before looking away, directing his attention toward the Gryffindor table, a sneer upon his lips.
Her ears began ringing as she got to her feet, staggering unsteadily toward the veil. Distantly, she heard someone shouting Harry’s name and the sound of running footsteps but she paid them no mind.
Ron was about to answer back when Professor Lupin stirred. They watched him apprehensively, but he simply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly open, and slept on.
Harry groaned loudly and closed his eyes, moving his hips in time with Draco. Pants and gasps filled the room as they both quickly rushed towards completion.
“Only because Sarah tackled Quirrell when he was strangling me!” countered Harry. “She definitely did more than me!” People gasped as they looked toward Sarah in shock.
It was like watching a speeded-up film Hermione had shown Sarah two summers ago of a growing tree. A head was shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up.
She had been fine with the arguments and the taunting. But when her father had cursed her mother as being the fault of Sarah’s traitorous character, she had snapped. Sarah thought she was lucky to have escaped unharmed as she recalled the fury in her father’s brown eyes and cruel face.
“He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed – “
Bill and Fleur’s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Whenever Sarah went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, she could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. She spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on her face. Sometimes she was joined by one of the others but usually it was just her.
Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken: a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart.
“I see Sarah’s awake,” came Hermione’s voice. She had just pushed her way through the tent flaps. “How are you feeling?”
Draco nodded in agreement. He worried his bottom lip for a moment, his gaze darting to the Gryffindor table and back. “I wonder why she’s here?” he asked.
All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly when they took their departure. Mrs Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr Weasley on the cheek, though not nearly as much as the twins, who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her.
“Do not be angry, mon cheri,” she trilled. “Ignore zat ‘orrid woman – today is a day of ‘appiness and love.”
“She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.”
Draco smiled to himself and said, “It actually started out as a joke between me and Rosie – she’s my business partner – We were both interested in veterinary sciences but had no idea what to do after graduation when suddenly, she announces that we should open our own place and monopolise the work in London’s clinics. Mind you, we had both had most of two bottles of wine at this point so anything seemed like a good idea.” Draco grinned at the memory of Rosie slurringly declaring that they would rule the veterinary world. “Once we sobered up, we realised that it wasn’t that bad of an idea,” Draco continued, swirling his glass around. “And when we looked around for locations, we saw that Newcastle had a shockingly low number of clinics. And well…we finally managed to open last year.”
Sarah sighed and rubbed her eyes. “You guys can go back to bed,” she said. “I don’t think I’ll be getting much more sleep tonight.”
“Okay – well – “ she said haltingly. “The others and I have some things we need to do but I still think you all will be able to help us. We need a distraction as we look for the – er –
“Greg,” Theo put a hand on the other boy’s shoulder. “You won’t be able. Blaise, Pansy, Sarah, Draco and me, we’ll all look out for you, all right?”
“I don’t think he’ll able to, Ron,” said Mrs Weasley, setting a huge plate of roast chicken in front of Harry. “He’s really very busy at the moment.”
“A new schedule will be made shortly,” Moody replied gruffly. “Kingsley’s informed us that some people were catching on. We’ll have to be more careful.”
At first, they were all a little apprehensive. The only experience they had had with alcohol previously was small glasses of champagne or wine at various formal events. After a few glasses, however, they were all feeling warm and slightly fuzzy.
Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Sarah understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seems to shred her lungs and the stitch in her chest was like fire, Sarah sped up as an unbidden voice in her head said:
It wasn’t until later that Draco realised Lyra had effectively avoided talking about Harry’s gay interest.
He crawled closer and Draco realised it was indeed Dean Thomas. His dark face was scratched and one of his eyes was beginning to swell.
Everyone froze at Bellatrix’s shout. Granger was limp in Bellatrix’s arms, the silver knife pressed hard against her bared throat. Potter stepped away from Draco and Lyra and took a step closer to Weasley.
“As of right now, only you four,” said Dumbledore. “However, we may contact others whose families have been directly impacted by Death Eaters, just in case.”
“Ready?” Hermione asked as the clock struck seven o’clock. The other girls in Hermione’s dorm had come in during the last few hours and had already left for the entrance hall.
“You guys are sickening,” George teased. “If you look any more in love I fear I may start vomiting hearts.”
Currently, Sarah and Draco were watching the seventh floor near the Room of Requirement. Everything was quiet.
“It’s at the back of the clinic,” Draco said. “Technically, it’s owned by Rosie and me but we hired separate people to run it while we run the clinic. You can access it from the clinic or another front entrance.”
“We could have gone to your place,” Fred replied, the last word dissolving into a moan. “You’re just so fucking beautiful.”
They found the main battle in the corridor leading to the Astronomy Tower. Professors McGonagall and Sprout were battling three Death Eaters and McGonagall’s Scottish brogue echoed against the walls.
“Your father didn’t let your mother associate with me once they were married,” Professor Lupin said sourly. “Your mother managed to sneak away every so often though. Sometimes she even managed to bring you as well.”
Their dinner passed the same as the one Draco had shared with Harry and Teddy all those weeks ago. Conversation flowed as easily as the wine and any discomfort Harry had stressed over was not evident. Instead, all there was, was Draco’s bright eyes locked onto Harry’s the entire night.
Snape set off around the edge of the room and began lecturing about the nature of the Dark Arts. He was oddly fond in the way he spoke about them, gesturing towards the gruesome pictures depicting various results of curses or Dark magic.
Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of panic in the Gryffindor team now as Slytherin pulled ahead, forty-nil.
Sarah spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. She could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first.
With a lot more skill than before, Lyra climbed down the tree, with George helping her out of the last branch. That move ended in a hurried kiss as they stood against the trunk, Lyra’s back pressed to the sun-warmed wood.
Angelina blushed a pretty pink and smiled at Sarah. “Say’s you!” she exclaimed. “You look like one of those goddesses out of the children’s myths.”
Sarah was gaping in shock. The Malfoys always, without fail, held an extravagant party in the Manor. The fact that they hadn’t was extremely unlike them.
The Gryffindors were dreading the upcoming Quidditch game on Saturday. Fred and George had gone to watch one of their practices and reported back that they were going to get absolutely slaughtered.
“He says he’ll be delighted,” said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas Nigellus had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. “My great-great-grandson has always had add taste in houseguests…that
,” she murmured a few times until the skin healed over completely, leaving only two, small white scars.
The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she leapt up again.
Sarah blinked and looked around. She had not noticed the professor at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her. Sarah was speechless with horror.
Sarah’s stomach lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very sentient tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.
Harry opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls.
“Hey, Jesus, let me take a look at that wound,” Sarah said softly, gently removing the bloody cloth.
Lyra looked down at where she was straddling Harry’s hips and quickly threw herself off, both of them yammering at the same time.
Professor Snape stepped forward from the shadows and drawled, “The usual limit for a suitable schedule is ten subjects. You three, however, have chosen to disregard that.” He stared down at them, lips curling slightly. “It has been decided that a Time-Turner will be provided by the Ministry to allow Mr Malfoy and Miss Granger the ability to complete all their chosen subjects. You two will share it and use it only when for class.
This led to Luna enthusiastically describing nargles and various other creatures while everyone slowly trickled into the room. Sarah listened in interest and was soon offering her own opinions on the theories Luna told her.
“Thank you, Alastor, you may go,” Antonius Deaumont dismissed Professor Moody with the polite indifference made possible only by centuries of entitled pureblood breeding.
. He had no idea how they had seemingly gotten over seven years-worth of antagonism. Well, he conceded to himself, Draco healing his cat did help. He glanced down at the cat in question, who was sleeping peacefully draped over one of the chairs, arms and legs dangling off the sides. Teddy had been so happy that Fluffy was all right and Harry hadn’t been lying to Draco when he told the other man that the boy had done nothing but talk about him since they took Fluffy home. It didn’t help that Ron made a few pointed comments about the Malfoys at the last Burrow Sunday lunch, causing Teddy to stand in defence of his cousin.
“She failed to mention that part,” Sarah said, narrowing her eyes across the room at the older woman who was in deep conversation with Hermione and Draco. “That actually makes me feel much better.”
A girl, who strongly resembled a veela, got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blond hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“I guess you believe his nonsense, then?” Ron said, his eyebrows raised. “That he didn’t enter his name in the goblet.”
“Umbridge says we have to only sit at House tables now,” Draco explained sourly. “I expect it’s another one of her ridiculous Educational Decrees.”
As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their D.A meetings were put on hold because Angelina and Warrington insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship, were determined to see their side’s victory. Professor McGonagall cared so much about beating Slytherin that she didn’t give any homework in their joint Gryffindor and Slytherin Transfiguration class the week leading up to the match.
“I think this means you ought to make up with Hermione now, Ronald,” Sarah said sternly. “Or else I won’t let Harry lend you the broom.”
“I reckon Kreacher’s right,” he said. “We’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.” He passed it back to Sarah.
“No,” Sarah and Harry said at once. Harry added, “We’re not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she’s gotten to us.”
“There you two are, good. I was beginning to worry you had gotten a compartment with the hag,” Pansy said sharply. She strode into the compartment and flopped down beside Sarah, placing Sarah’s feet in her lap.
“It’s because you own a joke store, Uncle George,” James said seriously from his place on the floor. He had pressed himself up against his father’s legs as Draco sat in the armchair opposite Hermione. “Father says that you have the resources to deal with us all.”
“Blaise, here, thought it would be a wonderful idea to hook up with a girl while he was already involved with another,” Theo explained.
“Are you positive this is Potter?” Narcissa said regally. “If Lucius comes home to find you have made a mistake – “
“Also, you don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a troll,” said Ron reasonably. “Personally, I think there’s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest of the team might’ve dealt with him before you get out of here…”
It was barely more than a whisper but she still heard it. She didn’t even know if Fred had meant to say it.
“Me too,” Draco added. He turned his grey eyes on Harry, who looked visibly relieved that they believed him. “We’ll talk more about this tomorrow. If Snape checks the common room and Sarah and I aren’t there, we’ll be in so much trouble.”
“Move this scum outside,” said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. “The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!”
She waved her wand in an intricate pattern and held her breath as the air around Draco began to shimmer before solidifying.
“I just wasn’t expecting it,” she whispered, taking a long sip of the fragrant beverage. “It’s not like I haven’t thought about the possibility of it. But seeing the reality of it thrust upon me in
“Merlin, I can understand why,” Sarah scoffed as the group of five left the Gryffindor common room for lunch on Saturday. Sir Cadogan flitted between challenging them to duel and complimenting the girls on their ‘scandalous hair designs’ when he wasn’t busy changing the ridiculous passwords. He was so annoying that Sarah was sure she’d snap one day and hex his pudgy face off. At least he still let her and Draco into the Gryffindor common room.
A stillness had settled over the scene. Beside Sarah, Harry was cringing in pain, his face draining of colour.
The five of them struggled over to a nearby corner and sat in a huddle. Greg indeed was barely paying attention. He was leaning against the wall, eyes blank as they stared at seemingly nothing. Lyra gripped Draco’s hand tightly, refusing to let him out of her sight for even one more second.
Draco had woken up and obviously heard enough to understand what they were talking about. He walked up beside Hermione and peered at the picture of the letter.
screamed Sarah, who had just caught up to them, Hermione hot on her heels. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backwards toward the bell jar. Sarah expected to hear a
“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded…You have until midnight.”
“That makes sense then,” Lyra said, almost to herself. She smiled reassuringly at Harry. “The only people who have any problems with homosexuality are the stuffy pureblood families who are focused on reproduction. But most of them would still allow the person to take a lover as long as they produced an heir first.”
“It just keeps hitting me at random times,” she said. She turned her gaze to Fred’s warm brown one and felt slightly better. “The –
It clipped Antonius on the shoulder and he scowled. “You’re not getting away this time,” he growled and he began fighting in earnest.
Alastor Moody, who had actually turned out to be locked in a chest and replaced with the imposter Barty Crouch Jr, was at the staff table now. Harry had explained how Barty Crouch Jr had used Polyjuice Potion all year to pretend to be Moody, and that he had put Harry’s name in th Goblet of Fire and ensured that Harry would touch the Triwizard Cup and get transported to the graveyard. It also explained why Moody had led Sarah to her father that night.
Remus watched him leave, his lips curling into a slight smirk. He turned back to the wary teens and his smirk turned into a soft smile.
Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes – green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria – which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectable figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.
Sarah saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by Fred and Lee, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground. She saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, but screaming for her son.
The door to the room cracked open and a thin figure slipped through, closing the heavy wood silently behind them. Moonlight reflected off familiar white-blond hair and Lyra released the breath she hadn’t known she had held.
“When were you going to tell me this little fact?” Sarah hissed to Hermione as they left the Hall after talking with Blaise at the Slytherin table. “
When she got back to Harry’s room, he helped her pass the trunk through the window to Ron and Draco.
Draco was still angry at Harry but Sarah suspected there was something else fuelling his rage. Draco, however, was refusing to spill.
“Isn’t there a practical portion in our Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L? Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and things?”
Lyra knew it was a pointless battle to try to reason with her son on that topic so instead, she turned to her brother.
“Thankfully, Dumbledore has already taken certain precautions,” Draco added, rubbing Harry’s back slowly.
“I was just wondering whether we would be looking at Mr Slinkhard’s second edition of this series?” Sarah asked evenly.
“Yes…but we all did things in the war that we’re ashamed of,” Hermione reasoned. “And Harry is adamant that you’ve changed your life around.”
going to curse you,” she assured, leaning down over his shoulder to look at him sideways. “It was only going to be like,
“Fuck off!” she shouted over her shoulder, tightening her grip on the small rucksack across her back.
“And that still haunts me,” confessed Lupin. “But no one knew about us – my condition was kept secret, and the others obviously kept theirs secret so that they didn’t have to register. However, it caused some people to suspect us.”
“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your wife seem less than happy of late…What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?”
“Would you believe me if I said nothing?” Naomi replied, swatting her girlfriend away good-naturedly.
“Your winnings,” he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto Harry’s bedside table. “One thousand Galleons. There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances…”
Harry thought for a moment. “Well, he usually comes to my store Wednesday afternoons,” he told her. “Apparently he only has a half-day. Rosie officially takes the second shift but usually they both spend the whole day there.”
“Teddy’s nothing if not forgiving,” Potter said. He paused for a moment, seeming to debate with something before he asked in rush, “Would you want to come over for dinner one night?”
“No problem, Sarah,” Tom brushed off her thanks. “Yer mum was a good friend of mine.” He turned away and walked toward the door to leave. “I’ll send up some breakfast in the morn, if yer want?” he offered, light eyes dancing in the flickering light of his wand.
Hermione was staring out the window and didn’t reply. Draco cleared his throat and descended into a brief summary of what they had been doing for the past few hours.
Draco huffed again and slid further down into his chair, seething for the unlucky reality of his life.
Before the occupants could speak, they were disrupted again, this time in the shape of Ron Weasley with a baby on his hip.
Sarah scrambled up from the floor and gathered her own gifts, jumping on the end of Seamus’s bed, careful to avoid the presents.
Hermione bought a quill and chastised Ron for harping on about Ginny’s dating life. Harry turned to Sarah. “Can we talk, please?” he said nervously.
Sarah and Tracey barely inclined their heads, not willing to take their eyes off each other. To Sarah’s surprise, she could see a trace of fear in Tracey’s hazel eyes.
“Harry, is everything okay?” Draco asked again, a hint of concern building inside him. In all the weeks they had shared a room, Draco had never seen Harry like this. It was slightly disconcerting.
Sarah spent the next hour barking orders at them, shooing people away when they dismally failed to complete simple tasks. All the while, Pansy smirked beside her and at one point, offered her a flask of suspicious liquid.
Sarah blanched. Harry was watching Grawp’s feet, which were almost as long as Harry’s whole body. Sarah gripped his arm tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped.
The screaming inside Sarah’s head began to fade as a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry’s wand, to hover between him and the dementor. Harry’s legs began to visibly shake.
The group was planning on practising Quidditch in the field next to The Burrow. Sarah and Draco were planning on trying out for their house team this year and Harry, Fred and George had been running them through drills with Ron helping out wherever he could.
Pansy settled down and their group fell into an uneasy silence. It was quickly broken by Sarah’s loud arrival.
“I zink you should leave,” she heard Fleur say to Bill. “She should not ‘ave men near ‘er right now.”
“Well, he’ll be doing his Potions Mastery immediately after graduation,” Sarah replied. “But don’t think about Draco for a moment, Harry. Think about what
“Did you slip?” she asked him, accepting the Cloak which he handed her, stowing it in her ever-present handbag.
Lyra rolled her eyes, already knowing the answer before Verity said excitedly, “Your brother, Lyra. I swear, that boy gets more stunning every time I see him.”
Slowly, the candidates trooped out of the pitch and Sarah collapsed on the ground, lying face up looking at the setting sky.
PS: if anyone can draw hit me up cus I want to put scenes onto paper but I can't even draw a crooked stick man
“Poor Blaise…” Sarah murmured as she walked towards Pansy’s bed. She sat down on the end of it and said carefully, “I heard about you and Millicent.”
Sarah glanced around the deserted entrance hall. “Well, yes…” she said hesitantly, “but we need to figure out a way for Harry to breathe underwater for an hour. We’ve looked through everything we can think of and we still don’t know how.”
The barman grunted. Sarah thought there was something familiar about him but it wasn’t until he turned toward her and she saw the sparkling blue eyes behind dirty spectacle lenses did she realise.
Sarah smirked. “Yes, Professor,” she said in a teasing voice. Harry flushed dark red as people laughed.
“Thank you. Now that’s over, I’d like to eat in peace,” Draco said primly, settling a napkin on his lap.
A fire danced to life on the other side of the canvas; large shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalisingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.
. It can’t have been in food – he and Rosie checked it every day to make sure it was fine. None of the animals had shown any symptoms of sickness yesterday…it was almost like…like…
“Oh, hush, you big baby,” Rosie said dismissively. “How’s Bernie today? He was looking a little rough last night.”
It was a small, shabby all-night café. A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Sara grimaced but followed the others to a booth, where after a moment’s hesitation, Draco slid in. Sarah guessed Harry had gotten in first, as Hermione and Ron slid into the other side without waiting. Hermione glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch.
“You’re one of my best friends, Harry, and I want you to always know that,” Sarah replied with a smile.
“Patronus, Sarah,” said Draco. Sarah hardly needed to be told; her silver lynx shot out and joined Harry’s stag, Draco’s snow leopard and Ron’s Jack Russell terrier. Hermione’s silver otter finally burst from her wand after a few tries.
“It’s fine, Hermione, you’ll be out there,” Draco said, waving a hand. “I’d much rather be here with Harry.”
“I woke up at the arse-crack of dawn,” she complained. “So I went to the library to get some work done.”
“It’s not,” Hermione agreed. “But grief works in strange ways. Maybe you need this to finally overcome everything that happened. Maybe now, the last string connecting you to those experiences has been cut and you are free to go forward.”
“I hope you don’t want intimate care from every Healer you encounter,” Sarah said, raising her eyebrow at him.
“Think about it, Sarah!” Harry enthused. “Dumbledore used to live there – they would have known each other. And even if they didn’t, they
Hermione finally found her book and then nodded at the letter that was still clasped in Lyra’s hand. “You looked distracted,” she said. “Is everything okay?”
“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. “You thin it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?”
There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, guys! Wondered where you’d go to!”
“Well, Dean, Seamus, Parvati and I were working on Transfiguration while the others were working on Potions,” Hermione replied, tucking an errant curl behind her ear. “I was trying to get Ron and Harry to finish that essay Slughorn set us yesterday.”
“Looks like we’re using your room, girls – can you deal with the other two?” Blaise said, grinning ear to ear.
“Well, look who’s here,” Blaise cried as they entered the warm common room. “We were beginning to think that you had forgotten where you lived.”
“But, sir,” said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, “we’re not supposed to start werewolves yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks – “
“It’s Longbottom, isn’t it?” sneered Lucius Malfoy. “Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause…Your death will not come as a great shock…”
“Draco had nothing to do with Bellatrix’s actions,” he said, his tone offering no room for argument. “And anyone who blames him will have to deal with me.”
yeah, I know, I remember,” said Harry. “But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure, I’m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?”
Sarah turned back to her bunk as Ron explained how he escaped the Snatchers. She was furious, beyond furious, and on top of that, hurt. He had said some truly horrible things before he left and now just expected them all to forgive him like no time had passed and nothing had happened?
“Right, I need you to go and find some Gillyweed for me,” Sarah said. “Make it enough for someone to be able to breathe underwater for just over an hour. Got it?”
“Don’t be,” Sarah said, shaking her head. “He was a horrible bastard and I’ll be much better off without him threatening my life every day.”
“You should talk to her,” Blaise said. “And if she says no, I’m always happy to help. I mean, it’d be payback for Millicent shagging a dude.”
“That is a task I will willingly help you with,” Lyra promised. “I don’t know how long I can stare at those moulding walls before I curse them off.”
Professor Bayard nodded at them and left them in front of a portrait depicting an autumnal forest scene, shooting a brief amused smile in Lyra, Draco and Pansy’s direction as he passed.
“Harry was sent a Firebolt for Christmas but he doesn’t know who sent it,” Draco explained quietly, eyeing the teachers at the table.
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch game of the season approached. Sarah and Draco had been training constantly with their team, despite Madam Pomfrey telling Draco to take it easy with his arm. At the final training session, however, Flint revealed that they would not be playing in the upcoming game.
“Well, that’s just brilliant,” Harry grumbled sarcastically. “Don’t we just love always being the odd one out?”
Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. The grin on Draco’s face had dropped entirely. Sarah sighed quietly and led the way to class.
Draco moved so that his back was resting against Harry’s chest and looked down at his sleeping friend and godson.
“I’m letting Hedwig out, she can meet us back at The Burrow,” she said, stroking the snowy owl once before letting her fly away into the night.
?” she asked him. “Give me a moment.” She quickly wrote something down on one of the numerous papers littering her desk and tapped it with her wand; the memo flew out of the room. “There we go – now we can really talk.”
“Have you got your stuff ready?” he asked, glancing past Harry and into the sterile hallway. “Moony is going to kill me when he realises I took these two.”
“There’s no need to look so worried – we just want a word in my office,” she told them when they halted before her.
It was true. Draco had fallen fast asleep on top of a pile of books, his quill still dangling from his long fingers. Sarah sighed and leant back into Theo’s legs, enjoying the sensation of the massage.
“I know, I know,” he rushed. “It’s just hard sometimes – I mean, you, Harry, and Draco come from three of the richest wizarding families.”
The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her. When the final bell rang and the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags, Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a dishevelled and soot-blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick’s classroom.
“How did you get into the room?” Harry asked. He began piling food onto his plate, suddenly ravenous now that his stomach had stopped trying to do the Samba without his permission.
“I guess you were interesting to talk to,” Draco begrudgingly added, slightly distracted by the movement of Harry’s mouth over his skin. “And you did buy me tea.”
“No, I’m not,” said Hermione, beaming. “I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears.”
Sarah wished that Draco hadn’t caught the pod so that she would have an excuse to leave the conversation. Harry obviously had the same thought. He seized the bowl from Draco and began to try and open the pod by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of. Draco snickered slightly and began to help him. Unfortunately, they could still hear every word of the conversation.
She rounded a corner and nearly crashed into somebody. Jumping backward, her wand raised, she realised with horror that she was staring into the cruel face of Gregory Goyle. She prepared to utter a curse when he did something she never would have expected: he raised a finger to his lips and glanced worriedly behind him.
built the Chamber, wouldn’t it make sense for him to put something down there that he could control?”
“Indeed,” Sarah replied. “He even convinced Ronald to stop being an idiot and finally makeup with you, Hermione.” She inclined her head at the bushy-haired girl, who was bent over a long roll of parchment and scribbling furiously. Hermione lifted tired eyes to Sarah and smiled weakly before going back to her work.
“Promise,” he said. Harry kissed him quickly. Draco pulled back and rolled his eyes. “Look at the sap you’ve turned me into,” he said dramatically. “I’ll never hear the end of it from Lyra.”
Harry blushed and sighed in defeat, dropping his hand. “You and Draco are too close for your own good.”
“Harry, you can’t think about this, right now!” Hermione whispered furiously as she flicked her wand. Her pillow soared through the air and landed on top of Sarah and Draco’s. “You need to focus on the task!”
“Greg,” Sarah said firmly. “Greg, listen to me. You need to find somewhere to hide. Wait until all this is over and then I’ll find you, or you find me, okay?
The odour of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly. Sarah took a delicate step away from the woman, closer into the house.
“Drink this, Miss Deaumont. It will help with the disorientation,” the first voice had returned and Sarah realised it was Professor Snape. He was holding out another vial and she struggled to raise her arm enough to grab it. He sighed slightly before supporting her hand to help her swallow the next potion.
Bellatrix was standing before a group of Snatchers, three hunched figures in front of them. Their mother was standing behind her, her elegant face pinched and worried. Lucius stalked into the room, indicating that Draco and Lyra should follow.
“For heaven’s sake, Harry,” she said, exasperated. “We’re going to go and find Justin so you can talk to him. If you keep being this bundle of nerves I’m going to throw you into the snow!”
“I know you will,” Harry smiled. He pressed a soft kiss to Draco’s lips. “That’s what makes you a good person.”
“What happened to you?” asked Sarah, for Hermione looked distinctly dishevelled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare.
Draco and Harry sat shoulder to shoulder on Harry’s bed. Their previous delighted expressions had fallen into concerned confusion.
He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze, disappearing from view.
“Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake him up.”
“How do we get past?” yelled Lee over all the screaming, but before either Sarah or Fred could answer they were bowled aside: Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella.
“He only went for Ron, for some reason,” soothed Draco, patting Pansy on the back. “I’m okay, Pans.”
Draco thought for a moment and then said, “What about Friday night? That gives him Saturday to spend time with the other children.”
exactly, but he had begun to take notice of different things. For example, Lyra was an extremely pretty young woman. Her grey eyes complimented her white-blonde hair and it wasn’t as if she wasn’t well-endowed. He just never felt the need to stare at her chest, like he had caught Ron doing on more than one occasion. Hermione, too, was pretty but the thought of doing anything remotely romantic with her just felt wrong; like kissing a sister or something. The one and only time Ginny had tried to kiss Harry had resulted in him jumping back so fast that he slammed painfully into the wall. She had looked offended but the mere thought of her touching him like that had caused his heart to race in panic.
Sarah drew a rough sketch of her bowtruckle, decided that it was quite horrible and vowed to get Draco to redraw it for her.
“YOU DID IT!” Sarah screamed and ignoring the pain lingering in her arm, drew both boys into a tight hug.
They spent the rest of the afternoon playing Quidditch and lounging in the sun until Mrs Weasley called them in for dinner.
“So – straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I’m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you’re in sixth year. You’re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it all then. But Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you’re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? You need to be alert and watchful. So…do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by Wizarding law?”
Harry and Draco bid Sarah goodnight and headed for the boy’s dormitory. As Sarah was leaving to follow Hermione, she made a detour and flicked Ron on the back of the head. He separated from Lavender with a suctioning noise and stared at her.
“Thank you, Miss Davies,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr Filch. If the rest of your house could follow.”
“I know that my family and I have done some atrocious things to you and others in the past,” he said softly, “and I know that I will never be able to take those back. But I like to think that I did manage to learn something from having everything I knew uprooted and destroyed. Even if you don’t want to accept my apology, I am sincerely sorry for the hurt I’ve caused in the past. I know that that will never erase my actions but I hope you can come to tolerate me – if not for myself, then for Harry’s sake.”
Rosmerta smiled and ruffled first Sarah’s, then Harry’s hair. “You two remind me so much of your parents,” she said wistfully. “Oh, I miss those troublemakers.”
Harry was waiting for Sarah in the entrance hall the next morning as promised. His arms were crossed grumpily over his thick winter coat and his beanie managed to conceal most of his frown.
“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. “You’d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.”
“It’s been ages since I’ve seen Mum’s cooking put someone to sleep,” Ginny commented across from Harry. Her arm was draped over Luna’s shoulder as the other girl talked energetically with Charlie about a strange creature Harry had no hope of comprehending. Hermione was beside the pair and wore a pained expression as she seemed to be struggling not to interject.
“Apparently You-Know-Who wants them found and taken alive,” Dirk explained. “Something about Lucius Malfoy being sure that his son and friend has been cursed the entire time. Rumour is that they want to make Death Eaters of the pair, yet.”
Hermione shot her a narrow-eyed look but didn’t say anything. Ron appeared in the doorway, his shirt the wrong way.
They quickly threw the last of Sarah’s things into her school trunk, laughing occasionally at Remus’ voice drifting up the stairs as he told Sirius off for various things.
“Sarah, he was your father,” he said calmingly. “No one is going to blame you for grieving when it happened right in front of you.”
She shifted so that her arms rested on his chest. “Do not forsake me, my love!” She propped her chin on her palms and said in a sweet voice, “You leave me to deal with them alone and I’ll make your life so difficult you’ll never be able to be truly happy again.”
“You have nothing to be sorry for, Draco. There was nothing you could have done, even if you were there – and I am glad you weren’t,” she assured softly. Sarah glanced around and saw the others watching intently and decided now was not the time for emotional reassurances. “We’ll talk more about this later. Right now, we have a bigger problem to deal with.”
“You all seem to forget that I’m not actually stupid,” Pansy drawled when Sarah asked why she was holing up in the library with them instead of tanning in the sun. “Besides, I miss spending time with you dears.”
“You’re going to make yourself horribly sick one of these days,” she said as she watched him reach for another sandwich.
Fred began to move faster as he got closer to completion and Sarah’s mouth moved to kiss and suck at the hollow of his neck, eliciting a deep moan from him. Sarah bit down slightly harder than she meant to when her orgasm wracked through her, her body tensing and shuddering and Fred began to thrust into her even faster, panting slightly as he kissed her. Sarah wrapped her arms around him and tensed, swallowing his groan as he came, thrusting hard into her a few more times before stilling. She kissed around his face as he rode down his orgasm before finally pulling out and dropping slightly to the side so that he wasn’t crushing Sarah.
Thundering footsteps sounded and a voice screamed loudly from the left. A bright light burst into the room, illuminating Harry’s limp figure across from Sarah.
“RUN!” Harry yelled. He seized a handful of Sarah’s robes and dragged her forward. She ran with one arm over her head to protect it from the raining glass pieces. She felt Draco running close behind her. A hand suddenly her by the shoulder she heard Draco shout “
“And where was he when Sarah’s ribs were broken?” Draco asked quietly. “Or when you were writhing in agony with a Horcrux burning into your skin?”
The dragon had not realised that it was free. Sarah raced forward and leapt onto its back, her foot finding the crook of its hind leg and she pulled herself up fully onto it hindquarters. Harry helped heave her further up the spine so that Draco, Ron and Hermione could clamber on after her. A second after Ron had climbed on, the dragon became aware that it was untethered.
They spent the rest of the lesson writing notes on werewolves and glowering at Snape as he read through their previous assignments and commented harshly on them.
“Why not?” said Harry excitedly. “Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.”
“You don’t have to apologise, Harry,” Sarah assured. “I know how much they fight. I must get annoying.”
“Yeah?” said Ron, his fake grin dropping off his face. “You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you’ll need to be up and early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.”
She smirked at the shocked looks on the Gryffindor’s faces. “Yes, we know what that is – after the debacle at the Ministry last year, our dear father thought that he ought to educate us on the ‘
lovely to see you both!” she gushed. “I’m so glad you’re staying the rest of the holidays. Sarah you’ll be staying with Hermione and Ginny and Draco, you’ll be with Harry and Ron. Harry arrived about an hour ago, I believe they are outside with George.”
“Now, Severus, I’m sure that’s not the case. I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure he will perform it admirably.”
Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov, in particular, seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knowing her off her broom.
“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. “Sounded like a banshee…Maybe you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”
“You two need to be Glamoured,” Moody said gruffly to Sarah and Draco. “You’re too recognisable and your fathers have got people out everyone looking for you.”
They all froze at Harry’s words and Lyra turned to see that the young man was slowly turning a bright red.
Sarah smiled at her reflection as Harry stepped up behind her, leaning against the wall and gazing across the trees.
“I’m trying, though,” she said in a strong voice. “I’m trying to remember that, it doesn’t matter if you understand or not, it only matters that you’re there for me.”
“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, “right to my chest, and then – it just went straight through. It was here,” he touched a point close to his heart, “I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me, I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere…”
“Is he?” Sarah said, internally cursing Ron, for every time she had gone to give him a check-up, he had been perfectly alert.
Sarah sat and noticed that Harry subtly shifted his chair close to the window to try to watch the Keeper tryouts. She internally rolled her eyes and steeled herself to start writing. The first cut always hurt the most as the healing scab sliced open and began to bleed afresh.
She ignored Fred’s shouts and vaulted from the room, uncontrollable shivers wracking her body. She pushed through the portrait hole and barely heard the Fat Lady exclaim in outrage behind her. She ran and ran and ran until she reached her secluded alcove. It was only then that she allowed the sobs to escape her body.
Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around.
“Yeah, probably a lot more than Lockhart does,” Draco muttered to them quietly. Harry snorted to contain a laugh as Hermione shushed them and glared.
“Be quiet and keep your eyes open,” Severus hissed at them before marching up the stairs to the top of the tower.
Sarah looked up as Harry stomped through the portrait hole late one stormy Saturday afternoon, a few days before Halloween. He was dripping with rain and mud and had a thoroughly confused expression on his face.
“Excellent,” Draco said with a wide smile. “That means we can go shopping for new clothes for Potter.”
“Don’t be rude, Blaise,” Sarah scolded. Theo and Greg sat down at the table but Sarah remained standing. “Greg saved my life. He’ll be staying at my family Manor with Theo for the summer.”
Sarah and Harry put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing moans.
If there’s one thing that always manages to make Sarah feel calm, it’s flying. As much as she loves the adrenaline of a Quidditch match, she also savours moments such as these, where she just glides through the sky at a leisurely pace, content to just enjoy the breeze on her face and the freedom of the open air.
“More reading areas and shelves,” Potter replied. “I wasn’t very good at sorting out genres so excuse the haphazard shelving.”
“Slytherin score!” same Lee’s voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowds below. “So that’s ten-nil to Slytherin – bad luck, Ron…”
“Do you have something to tell us, Blaise?” Draco asked teasingly. “I never would have guessed you swung both ways.”
going. Which brings us to my next point – Draco, I have already been in conference with the goblins at Gringotts to ensure that you have full access and control over the family vaults and assets, including the Manor. Seeing as your father is currently indisposed, you will be named Master.”
to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We’ve been over and over this, I mean, what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t even bothering to tell us – “
“Nothing,” Sarah said. “Except you’re making quite the scene not appropriate of a prefect. Goodnight, wanker.”
“So generous,” Lyra muttered under her breath. Draco dutifully ignored the comment. “So, step one seems to be going well. Excellent! This means you can start talking to him a bit more.”
“Are you actually going to eat the food or are you just going to keep staring miserably at it?” Blaise asked her after she hadn’t moved for a few moments.
Before she could even do more than blink, Sirius (now back in his human form), had grabbed her around the waist and hauled her over his shoulder, spinning around to lead her back to Remus. Draco narrowly missed getting hit by Sarah’s feet and waved brightly at them despite Sarah’s laughed cry for help.
“I did learn from the best,” admitted Lyra with a smirk as Harry appeared in the kitchen, wand drawn.
“Sarah, breath,” Remus said, smiling slightly. “Everyone will be fine. You all did an amazing job holding out for as long as you did.”
screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus.
When Sarah and Draco arrived in the Hall, they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout – the Heads of Houses – and a small wizard whom Sarah took to be the Apparation instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Sarah wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.
“I do not wish to criticise the way things have been run in this school,” she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, “but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed – not to mention,” she gave a nasty little laugh, “extremely dangerous half-breeds.”
“No, it isn’t about Ginny,” he replied. “Although, I’m still not too keen on going to the Burrow for my birthday. Are you sure we can’t just stay here and maybe invite Ron and Hermione?”
“All right, let’s say for a moment I’ll do it,” she said abruptly. “What kind of fee am I going to get?”
“Well, that could have gone worse,” Lyra commented idly as they left the last exam of their schooling career.
“She’s waiting for us just up here,” said Mrs Weasley stiffly, averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Draco.
Hermione blushed. “Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,” she said happily. “I’m glad you could make it.”
“How come you’re not in Ravenclaw?” Terry demanded, staring at the pair with something like wonder. “With brains like yours?”
“IRELAND WINS!” Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match. “KRUM GETS THE SNITCH – BUT IRELAND WINS – good lord, I don’t think any of us were expecting that!”
Sarah was dozing peacefully when the portrait hole opened and Hermione walked in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Harry and Ron stared at their head of House as Hermione walked around them and sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid her face behind it.
People slowly began to take notice, heads popping up tiredly and turning toward the Hall’s entrance. Sarah made her way to the doors where she was soon joined by Draco, Ron and Hermione. A massive wave of black was marching toward them and the occupants slowly trickled out of the Great Hall, Sarah and her friends leading them down the front steps to the front courtyard.
“Don’t even think about it,” replied Harry. He wrapped his arms around Draco and rested his head against the other boy’s, the pale strands tickling his nose.
diminished significantly. He quickly wrote out a response and tied it to the owl’s leg. Watching it fly off into the night, Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes.
Sarah kissed him and wrapped her arms tightly around him. Without much warning, she suddenly flipped them so she was straddling him. She put her hands on his chest as he stared wide-eyed up at her.
She never got to finish her question, for at that moment, Harry pulled out his wand and roared the Patronus incantation.
The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: he slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another spell at Sarah: shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Sarah head to foot – the waitress screamed and ran for the door – Draco sent a Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Sarah, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. Ron dived for cover in another booth and shot a spell blinding over his shoulder, clipping the standing Death Eater’s arm.
“Just a get well card,” said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:
She turned her back on him and marched toward the Great Hall, ignoring Ron’s calls of her name and apologies.
“Ugh, you’re right,” Sarah groaned. “I’m sure that once Blaise is a bit older he’ll be flirting with anything that walks.”
The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men’s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.
“That’s not the point, Sarah,” Draco snapped, cutting off Harry’s response. “The problem is that it could have been sent by Sirius Black!”
Remus hesitated and tightened his grip around her. She looked at his face to find that he was already looking at her, a sad expression on his face.
“As sweet as that is, Harry,” Draco said evenly, “I think you’re forgetting that I’m the reason one of their sons is half-werewolf, why another nearly died, and why one
Harry sat on his rickety bed at the Dursleys house, Sarah’s most recent letter grasped in his hands. They were finally able to get him. He had spent nearly a week in the house, the memories the last few weeks spiralling through his head and causing him to wake up in the middle of night, a shout on his lips.
“That’s so unfair!” Ron gasped. “George put a Canary Cream in my breakfast before they left and you’re telling me you always have the antidote on you?”
Draco turned his head and pressed his lips to Harry’s and Harry leant forward slightly, seeking that familiar, comforting warmth.
“Get it himself?" shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter. “The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic – “
Sarah’s shout attracted the attention of the others. Hermione, Harry and Draco raced into the room and judging by the copious amounts of swearing and thumping overhead, Sarah guessed that Ron was attempting to make his way downstairs.
“You were going to give the broom to Flitwick anyway,” Sarah reminded him as they walked around the lake together. Draco was keeping Hermione company as they researched more about Buckbeak’s hearing. Sarah had no idea where Ron was but guessed that the redhead was probably sulking somewhere.
Draco went a bright pink at the memory. Sarah peeked over his shoulder to see Harry also blushing brightly but with a smug smile on his face.
“James got us a compartment so we can all sit together!” Lyra exclaimed. She pulled back and moved to hug her father, who ruffled her black hair fondly. Both the twins had inherited Sarah’s metamorphmagus skills and had delighted themselves in changing parts of their appearance nearly daily.
“They’re over there,” said Fred, who was also swigging butterbeer, and pointed to the armchairs by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping precariously in her hand while Draco frantically scribbled on a piece of parchment. Harry and Ron went over to them as Fred came to talk to Sarah.
“Everyone ready?” he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam. “Minister – ready to go?”
“Well, I guess why not,” she said. “It’s not like I can expect you boys to actually get work done. You’ll be too busy staring at each other and snogging to plan the meetings.”
As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Sarah and Draco and Hermione. They seemed to melt away before them, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Sarah looked after them disdainfully, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
“Honestly, you two, pull yourselves together,” Narcissa sighed, eyeing Draco and Sarah sternly. “Harry and Fred look so conflicted right now, it surely can’t be good for their health to have you both catatonic.”
“I think I’m going to miss this place,” Lyra voiced suddenly. “Sure, sixth year wasn’t too great, but we still had fun.”
“Sarah, keep your voice down,” Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with her. “Anything could be listening in here – “
Begrudgingly, everyone grabbed their brooms and the Quaffle and began to follow Sirius and Remus into the downstairs sitting room, where the Floo waited for them.
, inlaid with many small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent’s canvas roof.
Potter doesn’t care what happened to her in there – well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff – “
“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Crabbe’s voice had risen excitedly. “If your friend Goyle intends to pass his Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L this time around, he will need to work a little harder than he is doing at pres – “
“Lyra…” murmured Hermione. “You shouldn’t forget the bad things he’s done…but you should also hold onto the good. Your father – he made bad choices and his beliefs weren’t the greatest – “ Lyra let out a choked laugh at that – “but, I think in his own, twisted way, he cared about you and Draco.”
“Right now, I just want to bandage this and get changed into something else,” she said. “Are you done shouting at us on our behalf?”
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it.
Sarah walked over to the waitress and mimicked Hermione’s actions, hoping she hadn’t done anything wrong.
A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Sarah saw a shining, high-heeled black show emerging from the inside of the carriage – a shoe the size of a child’s sled – followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman she had ever seen in her life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped.
Draco felt a smile of his own tug at his lips. “Careful what you wish for Potter,” he warned him. “Rosie’s a handful. And you haven’t even met Naomi yet.”
Sarah and Remus reached the front of the aisle and Remus hugged her tightly, kissing her cheek and whispering something into her ear. Sarah grinned in return and then turned toward Fred, who held out one hand with the largest smile on his face.
“Verity, stop coming on to the poor boy,” George said. “Come on, let’s leave these three alone. Good to see you, Harry, Draco.”
“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, “it is an honour to have you here, in our family’s house. There can be no higher pleasure.”
“Just keep hold of Teddy and you’ll be fine,” reassured Remus. He turned to his son. “Teddy, would you want to sit with Sarah for lunch?”
“No!” Draco could tell his face was a bright pink. “Unlike some people, I actually like getting to know the person before I fall into bed with them.”
Her father vanished and was replaced by a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin, who said,
“You shouldn’t be moving around so much,” scolded Fleur, placing a cup in front of her. “You will reopen your wounds.”
When she looked back, Sarah found she had only scattered memories of the next few days. The recollections she did have were very painful. The worse, perhaps, was seeing Harry meet with the Diggorys the next morning after the task.
“Sure thing, Captain,” Ron said. “Shall I let them get a few in to bolster confidence? The poor souls look like they’re about to wet themselves.”
“Yeah,” said Harry while Sarah nodded along. “Yeah…she said…progress will be prohibited or…well, it meant that…that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.”
“Have you ever seen spiders act like that?” said Hermione wonderingly. Sarah and Draco shook their heads.
“For Healing, you’ll need top marks,” he explained. “This means Outstandings in all your O.W.Ls and N.E.W.Ts. I believe they will accept some Exceeds Expectations but it is preferable to have O’s.”
“Great,” said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside. “I’m starving. I want to get to the feast…”
She faintly heard Theo throw something at Blaise and snap, “Shut the fuck up, Blaise, you’re always offended”, bringing a smile to her face.
“There’s nothing there to hurt us now, anyway,” Orion said, glancing up from his book to address his mother. “Thanks to Uncle Harry and everyone.”
And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing number eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in this heat.
“Of course, Voldemort would have considered that ways of house-elves beneath his notice, just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals…It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn’t.” Her voice was icy.
