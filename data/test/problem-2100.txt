Soon the light materialized around them and Harmony lifted her head from his back. She slid off and ignored Ginny hiding her mouth and having a good laugh about the whole thing. "Thanks Draco," she said.
"But wait, is that Vanilla witch number 5?"
When Harmony returned to the room, Draco hadn't realized that she sat next to him or that he was glued to the screen. His eyes widened as the show went on and after a few moments he noticed that the laughter wasn't coming from the telly. "What's so funny?" he asked, not even turning to her.
"What the hell is wrong with you?" Ginny asked calmly. Malfoy smirked and took an empty seat directly across from Harmony.
Harmony felt the magic, seductively flitting across her mind, compelling her to move forward. "Fuck you," she hissed. His eyes narrowed.
"Where is Dumbledore?" Harmony had asked when she returned from her obnoxious Malfoy encounter and ice cream recovery session. Not that she particularly needed more attention from certain interfering old wankers, like more sex changes, she just wanted answers. It didn't make things any better that her lower stomach kept on acting up either.
"We both know that you were out somewhere, probably meeting someone. And it better have not been Malfoy."
"Yes," Leighton brought a fist to his chin, "You," he pointed at Ginny, "will hereby be known as Hook, and you," he added as he then turned his finger to Luna, "will be known as Dash." Luna didn't even blink from the name. "But it would seem that we will have another visitor tonight," Leighton scrunched up his nose, "a weasel."
"That's not fair, she's my friend too! I have important gossip to go over with her, you can't take her for the whole trip."
"Professor Snape can make a counter potion that will negate the effects." Dumbledore noticed Harry's defectiveness. "I know that you find it hard to trust him, but I believe in him, I would entrust him with my very life." Harry looked into his eyes and there was only remorse that reflected back at him.
"So there's a Basilisk tooth somewhere in this bathroom?" Draco looked around him dubiously. "Alright."
Ginny swam to the edge, looking up at him. "I kind of got carried away there." She said. "Are you mad at me?"
"Some of the Slytherins want to hurt you because of that. Watch your back Draco, Hogwarts isn't safe for you." Draco snorted, remembering Snape and his father had said something similar to that.
"That's a little hurtful considering I saved your life."
"Than make some Hufflepuff friends." Blaise laughed, and patted Draco's back.
"What is your problem, really?" Harmony asked him.
"It's not the same." Harmony retorted.
"First year, when someone jinxed Harry's broom, Snape was the only professor attempting a counter jinx. And Snape officiated the next match. Third year, back when everyone thought Sirius Black wanted to kill Harry, Snape was never around, and you could always find him patrolling near the Gryffindor tower. Last year-"
"Hm?" Ginny whispered, "You think we are going to be pulled up?"
"Murder," Harmony gripped her robes and Leighton nodded.
He knew that she wasn't dead. She couldn't be. He glanced down once more at the ring that connected them. It hadn't faded to silver, as it had when Harmony had fallen at the Dark Lord's hands. He knew that she lived. And as the weeks passed, Draco expected every day to see her return. He listened for a cry of triumph throughout the school as a short midget with glasses returned. But it never came.
"So that's it."
"The Headmaster has been here, this morning," Sirius began, careful of his words or of exposing too much. "He and a couple of us were just in time to witness the Dark Lord exiting the Ministry of Magic...specifically from the Department of Mysteries. He was looking for something, and we weren't in time to stop him. He was in a rush as well, didn't even try to conceal himself. And now the Wizardling World knows that the Dark Lord is back. Maybe he just wanted the world to be in fear. Sure as hell twisted enough of him. Fudge is going to have a field day, though."
Draco reached from behind her, and twisted the knob. "When the house is under attack, a lot of the doors will lock down, and only a Malfoy can get through." They left the cellar open, and Draco and Harmony turned into animals just as two death eaters passed. Though it wasn't the most brave thing to do, Harmony reverted to a girl and shot them in the backs with stunning spells.
Harmony rested on her bed, and closed her eyes in peace. She did not have to worry about her Gryffindor mates seeing her as a girl anymore, since Proffesor McGonagal had gladly given her an unused room in the common rooms. Harmony had it constantly locked, and wondered why she hadn't gotten her own room earlier. Ron and the others did not protest her removal, because it had been the time during which she had the temperament of a raging Snape.
"Secondly, you and I both know that when Potter's things were found, they weren't all found, or everyone would have heard about the fact that Harry kept women's knickers and dresses."
"Didn't you give him three kilos of that stuff?"
"And….you will soon be a girl." Dumbledore say what?
Harmony pictured Voldemort and his bald snake face as she punched the air in front of her. She went at every direction, and threw in some kicks to his groin. It would have been fun, but she tired after twenty seconds. She didn't stop as her arms burned from the excursion. "Keep going," Leighton said, "this is your personal monster you are fighting, give it a good fight." Harmony lashed out at her invisible Voldemort, and felt the satisfaction of his jaw moving and everything. She'd show him. "Done," Leighton said. Harmony turned to Draco and saw him smirking. It was obvious who his personal monster was, considering that he was glaring at the man in a self satisfied kind of way. Harmony almost laughed but she was too out of breath.
"Thanks," she said and he left the changing room. Harmony felt the collar of the shirt between her thumb and fingers, and brought it closer to her face. As silly as she was acting, Harmony smiled as she thought that it smelled like him, and ran to class before doing something even more embarrassing.
"I feel better now, I had an hour hot shower," she said.
"Cooking is improvising from a standard procedure, Potions is just way too precise and stressful for me," Harmony said. He gave a little laugh.
"It's just a little water, Potter," Pansy laughed, "it suites you well." Harmony pointed her wand at the girl. "Easy Potter, it wasn't me."
"Harmony, you know that you're rich, right?" He mentioned to her.
The door clicked as it closed and the three girls sat in a momentary silence. "What the hell just happened?" Ginny asked. "Why would he want to meet you, and why was he acting so strange?"
"I'll be right back with your order." Luna and Ginny caught her eye, and she quickly looked away. As Harmony, she was invisible to the scrutiny of the world, but she felt the eyes of one person on her, and he would not stop.
"A while."
She disappeared into the train, and Draco whispered a good bye to her. It would be a terrible week alone. A week stuck with himself. He unraveled the socks, and couldn't help but think that she really hated him. And though he ought to have been offended, he was incredulously thankful. In fact, he began to chuckle, for he realized that the socks were what she used to wrap the gift. Hiding in one large sock was a small ring, and as he put it on, colors swarmed around the band like ink. Dark colors that twisted around his finger.
"But there is more," Severus said slowly. "Dumbledore did reveal that he was destroying all of these objects in order so that you would never be complete."
"There would be an outcry if the rest of the wizarding world knew. So much publicity is already on her, any more would make her ego explode." There was that cursed word again. What was Snape on anyway, too many fumes and no ventilation were bad for his health. He already had problems, but this just was pushing it.
"Why is it so important to you?" Harmony muttered. Kreacher's fingers twitched as if the air rattled them.
"Lily? No, who are you?" Aunt Petunia scrutinized the girl.
"Oh Harmony," Ginny sighed, "you don't have to be shy." Harmony frowned at the girl.
"I don't see why though," Leighton shrugged, "I am your mentor, you are my student, so naturally you would be my cub." No matter how hard she tried, she could not follow his logic. "Unless you would rather be young grasshopper instead."
"What is this?" she asked.
"You wouldn't," Ron sneered, "no. I don't think that you can."
"I don't like the sound of you being alone in the castle," her eyes went round, "when you can be protected by the Order. Even Dumbledore won't be in Hogwarts!" Ginny caught her rising voice and glanced around to make sure that no one was listening.
"You're getting lots of attention though," Ginny said, and Harmony saw that many heads and fingers were pointing her way. She shrugged her shoulders. "They're calling you the Hogsmead girl, and Draco's girlfriend."
"It was nothing really, sir."
"Well he's certainly making an impression on you," Luna commented, "and I think it's rather nice of him to think so much about his special someone."
"My old house elf?" Draco asked, "you're kidding."
Or not? Like I mentioned before, you could do well in Slytherin. You have a fair amount of cunning, I suppose. You would gain power and influence there. But you do realize that you are very brave right? My brave students tend to go to...
It was a gray afternoon that Dumbledore was buried, cloudy and seeping with undertones of orange. Harmony stood off to the side as Harry Potter, feeling as the cool wind played with her hair. The black lake rippled against the shore, with faces just below the surface, watching with yellowed eyes. Ringed around the lake, the centaurs had come to pay their respects. Standing solemnly with their bows slung across their backs and pawing their hooves anxiously into the muddy ground.
"Yes!" Harmony said in exasperation. "I am." She puffed out her chest and took off her glasses. She looked at them as a girl. "I'm not getting it," she said. Draco had to stop himself from looking at her for too long. He had control.
"I am really sorry Harry." Dumbledore stopped for a moment. Harry put his hand to his chest to see if he was growing anything, and fortunately his hand felt his flat chest. Okay, so Dumbledore finally became raving bonkers.
"Yes, I can spot everything on the field," she said.
"Yes," Draco said, and immediately he felt the strain of Snape's mind on him. The man dug as if he could rip out chunks of Draco's thoughts, and Draco sealed up his mind even more, determined to give the older man nothing.
"Damn, what did you put in there? It burns." She grabbed his hand. "You better know where you're going," he muttered with his eyes sealed shut. A slight remorse trickled down her gut, from seeing the harm that she had caused. He held her hand tightly, and must have been really blinded from the potion. Their clasped fingers slackened and slid till the contact ceased when they arrived to the loo. The sound of water flowing and draining alerted Draco to start rinsing his eyes. Tepid water slipped through his fingers and down his arms. Water droplets caught in his hair, and dripped down his jaw line.
"Yes, so pain caused by betrayal is almost always harder to get over." Draco bit his tongue, realizing just why the older man picked on him. Draco glanced at Harmony. Her eyes were downcast, staring into the jar that was so seemingly innocuous.
"That's still flying," Luna said.
"What are you talking about? This is totally unnecessary, I already said that I would go all dressed up, it wasn't an invitation for you to do any of this."
Harmony considered it, if Dumbledore had done it, it couldn't be that bad. "What is it?"
"Oh right, half the fun is watching the Professors rip out their hair or beards, as they look for the evidence to incriminate me, while only having leads to the other houses. I know. But my detentions are lessons for me."
"Wasn't that-" Draco started and frowned, "nevermind." Three pairs of eyes looked at the boy wonder who shrugged his shoulders.
"The rug is charmed so that muggles will see a cloud in the sky." Before she could say 'of course' the rug hovered from the ground beginning its journey. "So how was your stay?" McGonagall asked.
"You need lessons to close off your mind. I assume that you have never heard about occulmency." Snape said, not even waiting for a response. "Occulemency is guarding your mind from people who can use legimus, which is infiltrating a person's mind usually against their will. There is a detrimental connection between you and the Dark Lord, one which he can take advantage of. If he wants to, he could implant messages in your mind, see into the depths of your soul, and use that knowledge to find out what could hurt you the most. Few can master occulmency, and if I am to teach you, it must be in secret. Interested?"
"Doesn't matter," Harmony inched closer to the blue flames, "Snape is gonna fail me any way."
McGonagall went to Harmony and hugged her tightly. "I heard what happened and we will take you home immediately." Harmony's eyes drifted first to Dumbledore who nodded, and then to Leighton who appeared to be a bit amused.
She stared at the message hidden in the crane.
"Any questions?"
"But where-"
"What?" she was met with an odd expression, and as he turned to the mirror, he stared with an open mouth. What light was touching his skin looked as if someone had glued sequences and glitter to his face, and he jumped back from the light as if burned. He touched his face hesitantly, "this better not be permanent."
"DUMBLEDORE!" Harmony shot her hand in the air, as if it was class, "what is his form?"
"Sure, if we could think of a way to sneak off without your mum and six brothers finding out and murdering us."
"Sure," Draco said and got up. Blaise raised his head from his hand, and gave Draco the thumbs up before smirking. The message was clear, try not to make a fool out of yourself, and Draco put his wand away before grinning back at Harmony. "You ready?" he asked.
Harmony looked at herself in the mirror of the loo and decided that she didn't look bad. The white contrasted against the light tan of her skin and drew attention to her slim hourglass figure. "Blimey, Harmony you're tiny." Ginny remarked when she stepped out.
"He can handle himself," Draco said, "he'll be in the thick of things." They took a few steps in the darkness, and Harmony was reminded of all the horror muggle movies that she had ever watched, and all the times she had said 'don't go in there' to the actors. She contemplated grabbing a handle of a knife, or anything, but she reminded herself that her wand was a loaded gun.
"Two months?" Draco said in disbelief. "And I bet illegally as well."
Now that he was alone with her, he was stuck. What could he even say to her?
"Not so," Dumbleodre said, looking at the papers on Severus's desk, and frowning at all of the fails he saw. "I fear that he has lost it," he paused for a moment, "or should I say she." Severus looked at him sharply. A glare like a double edged sword, meeting the headmaster squarely in his right eye.
"What, no hi, how's it going, nice to see you again?" he grinned even more as she gave him a pointed stare. "Fine, Dumbledore hired me, apparently there's a shortage of Defense Against the Dark Arts professors willing to take a job at Hogwarts. And as to how I did that, I'm a wizard Harmony. I can do magic."
"What!" Fletcher said, "I'll not be treated like this, I'm leaving."
"What are you doing here?" Ginny held her hands on her waist as she made her way in front of Draco.
"And you don't?" He gave a light sneer "Oh woe is me, the boy-who-has-to-save-everybody…wait, no sorry, the girl who has to save everybody because the world would blow up otherwise." He stared down at her. "Did I miss anything? Oh yeah," he said hitting his forehead in the process. "Besides that hero complex, you're the little attention seeker who must disregard the rules because your just that much better than everybody."
"Which would mean," Leighton smiled, "that each of you will be given code names." Harmony smacked her forehead with her palm, shaking her head in disapproval.
"What of your life?"
"Why do you like them?" Charlie asked, and Harmony noticed that the side conversations halted, as Ginny and the twins looked her way, curious for an answer.
"Er, right," Harmony muttered, wishing that she had some ice cold water to cool her senses. Her body slid to the floor, and her forehead rested on the knees she brought close to her chest. A headache, she repeated in her mind, and not the embarrassment rushing to her head.
"I don't want too much on," Harmony said, "I still want to look like me."
"Of course it's not, you are much too special to be ground down by anything less than courageous, perfect, and pure."
"What was missing?" Snape looked pointedly at Draco. No way was he going to utter the Dark Lord's unmentionables.
"That doesn't tell me whether Harmony's alright." Ginny said, wanting to know more.
It was the day after Christmas, and Harmony sauntered down the stairs looking for Ginny. Harmony peered innocently into the kitchen, to see if Ron, or the Really Obnoxious Nuisance, as she started to think of him, was up and about yet. Harmony paused in her train of thinking, and frowned at how vindictive she sounded in her own mind. No. It wasn't as if she hated her former friends now. She didn't even dislike Ron. But if he decided to continue to be a prick about who she wanted to date, then she wasn't going to back down.
"Wha- What are you doing?" Harmony faltered as she watched the progress of his shirt exposing more and more skin. His shirt was nearly off as he began to turn to her, so that now she could see the full expanse of his chest. She didn't know why she was staring, since she had seen many of her mates with less on, but this caught her completely off guard. With his shirt off, Harmony noticed his smirk next.
"Come into my office, I'll show you." Leighton stepped aside and swept a hand to towards his room. Leighton sat down in a pine green over stuffed chair, next to a jar of Honeydukes Finest atop his desk. He leaned back into his armchair and motioned for her to sit in another overstuffed chair. Though he filled his seat, Harmony could barely touch the floor with her feet and she had ample room to spare. She looked around to see large medieval weapons lined on the walls and what looked to be rolls of blue and red padding stacked upon shelves. The door shut on its own.
"Huh?" Dudley said perfectly imitating the apes Crabbe and Goyle.
"Insufferable arse," Ginny muttered.
"Ah, sticky stuff with a faint odor of dead skin, peels off at the end of the day. This," he said waving his hand in front of his face reverting to a younger looking self about seven years of difference "is much more convenient." Leighton continued to wave his hand back and forth switching between the two faces.
"I can't take it anymore- all of your fake bullocks! And this wretched class. I have to get out of here!" She grabbed her bags from the floor, making twists and turns from the tables for the exit. Her hands yanked on the handle, and before she left she caught the image of Ron standing up and applauding with a wicked grin of approval. She scampered down the spire with her pack thumping against her back. Why did she have to take that class? She pulled out her crumpled school schedule. All she had to do was fill it in with another class, and she wouldn't have to deal with crazy teachers sprouting her demise and her secrets. She already had Snape to do that.
He killed her to be beautiful, but the fine blond arches, and silky hair looked appalling, like make up plastered on a monster. She felt revulsion clench through her and Harmony hunched up, ready to strike. The door burst open and Death Eaters stopped as they witnessed their Lord. Lucious Malfoy dropped to his knees in horror.
Her body began to shake violently. The magic holding the door broke free, but she had lost sight of her surroundings. "you are mine, Harry Potter!"
"Wha- what are you talking about?" Her heart rate pounded along her veins. Was this some cruel new tactic to scare her. She saw his smirk and really wanted to see into his mind. The door thudded open but Harry had eyes only set for Malfoy. A void filled between them as he pulled away from her and his faint scent lingered along with their combined heat. He chuckled then and Harry berated herself for behaving like such a girl.
"Are you a cream puff?" Ron smirked.
"Wait, would you ever want to go to Romania with me?" Charlie asked. Seeing her confused look, he added, "Er, I mean to study dragons more." He hoped that his ears weren't turning red, despite the laughter that Fred had disguised as a coughing fit.
"I'll be right back, Harmony." She did not respond to him, as if she was in her own world where he did not exist. His father gripped his arm tightly as they left the room. He was still in pain. "You should get that checked out," Draco said. His father gave him a look, which shut him up.
It was a week before the dance, and Harmony wondered if Draco would ask her still. She was on edge about it, and then shook her head. She stepped through the halls, as she made her way to the library, and blocked a bucket of black ink from falling on her head. She would have gotten drenched if she hadn't heard the ink slosh before it emptied. She heard a snicker, but didn't catch the student.
Draco dropped his wand to the ground and brushed dark hair away to check Potter's temperature. The touch radiated a burning heat and Draco lifted an eyebrow as he looked at Potter. The dorky glasses had come off and it was like looking at him for the first time. Draco could make out the scar that contrasted against the blanched skin, the eyelashes that were much too long for a boy, and the slightly parted full lips that just made him want to laugh at how ridiculous Potter was. Even Potter's skin was soft and smooth, and Draco shook his head. No way should a boy look so effeminate. Sure Draco knew that he himself had devilishly good looks proving that someone up there loved him more than those common peasants, but at least that someone had gotten his dishy looks with his gender right.
"Be right there," she yelled back, making for the door. She wanted to be comfortable since she figured they would be walking for a while with Gringotts Wizarding Bank as their first destination. She grabbed her overlarge and worn out sneakers and slipped them on before facing her. McGonagall approved of the outfit till her eyes reached the not so appealing foot wear.
Professor Trelawney soon vanished below and they were both were silent.
"You don't want to do that and get expelled from Hogwarts this year," he said in a uninterested kind of manner "Then I will be bored all year, plus I don't think I could control my father if you do something to me, he can get pretty mean to those he doesn't like."
"Perhaps," Leighton said, "but for now, that is for the Dark Lord to figure out."
"Oh," he said, "could have fooled me."
"Yea, I'm fine, just the whole stress with Cedric and Voldermort is really bringing me down." Harry lied through his teeth, but he knew they would buy it. Hermione instantly responded by wrapping her arms around him and he stiffened a bit.
Draco stepped back into their hotel room to find his father standing over his bag. His father had turned around and silently held out a pair of jeans, touching the material lightly as if they could be contagious.
Harmony ran for the door and tiptoed down the stairs with the invisibility cloak hiding her. Going through her head were the secret passage ways into Hogsmeade. She had an hour to spare, before the students would actually leave Hogwarts. Deciding to leave earlier, she strolled to the third corridor where the one-eyed witch statue stood. She glanced around before taping the witch and whispering the dissendium spell. She internally thanked George and Fred, before entering the secret passageway. Harmony kept the cloak secured over her head, ignoring the darkness that crept along the crumbling walls. A root jutted out from the dirt, which nearly tripped her. "Why do girls even wear these silly shoes," she mumbled as she checked her nails for any chips in their color.
"I saw in the paper that there was a dementor attack last night, but it didn't give any details. Know anything about it?" He still had that smirk on. To anyone else it may have seemed like a topic like asking what the weather was like, but she knew him and the knife that he liked to plant at people.
"Your hands will get in the way, plus I know that you will pay more attention if I do it this way."
"The Sirius Black, mass murderer and traitor?" Blaise whistled, "sounds too good to be true."
"No," Harmony said abruptly, and paused "I told him that I probably wasn't going."
"A phoenix," Ginny thought out.
Air swept past her ear tassels as she dropped back to earth, and she too landed on Leighton's back, though not as gently. Her claws felt the coarse fur, but the smell of blood didn't trickle through. She jumped away before the bear could rise, and she melted into the leaves and brush of the forest. The snap of a twig alerted her of a new creature, and her eyes brushed over Draco.
She was glad to know that she was a healthy young girl and would continue to grow. She thanked Merlin when the embarrassing questions ended; the ones that she would never dare exchange to anyone, unless of course she wanted them to leave her alone.
"Well, is there anyone that he is close to and who knows?" Harmony thought for a moment, less than a handful of people knew.
The next room on her list was Theodore's. She did much the same except place a bucket of ice water above his door, and set loose hair eating worms in his bed. She also found his completed potions essay and instead of throwing it into the fire, she changed the middle of it into a love confession for Snape. Draco shook his head at her. "I'm so glad that you never took revenge out on me," Draco said.
He vaguely could recall the horrors of Health class in the muggle schooling, but even that could not answer the question of his retarded growth and lack of puberty. The human body seemed like a foreign subject for there were no classes on it offered, at least that he knew of.
"And that's coming from you, Potter, the greatest deceiver here." She narrowed her green eyes.
"Can we go now, please?" she asked feeling like some pervert surrounded by any boy's fantasy dream. At least she didn't see any familiar faces, not that they would recognize her anyway. But really, who wanted to see life sized posters of girls barely wearing anything? She had never seen girls undressed and wondered why she wasn't getting excited like the boys who looked at those magazines under their pillows. She was more or less getting embarrassed for the undressed girls on their behalf.
Draco shook his head, "I'm serious." He leaned closer to her, "try me." This was the chance that she was waiting for, to develop her skills in order to get into Voldemort's mind, discreetly. "I'm sure that my mind is much more pleasant than Professor Snape's."
Harmony rested her head once more on the desk, not meeting his eyes on purpose. "Perhaps something will change my mind by then, but who knows."
"You really should be going to Madam Pomphrey about that lice," Draco said.
"Peculiar that dementors would be out like that." He noted when it ended. The lines of his face sagged with age and weariness.
Harmony made her way back to the Gryffindor common room, excited to tell Ginny what had happened.
Dumbledore's smile fell a fraction as he knew what was to come would be painful. "Good morning Harry, are you hungry?" Harry gave him a pointed stare, even though he did feel a bite might do him good. "Well a student found you and fortunately brought you here." Harry felt that the headmaster was hiding something, something very horrid. "How have you been these past few days?"
"She never changes," Ginny looked over at Harmony. "And now its time to spear this locket."
"We were, we were…in the re-uh."
She stepped out of her room, which was adjacent to the main room, to see McGonagall fully clothed with wand in hand pointed at her throat. "Prefects and Head girl, check each bed for any child still sleeping." Harmony stood against the wall, as her school mates in every year stood in their pajamas and cloaks. Harmony put her hands under her arm pits to keep them warm, and many others tried to warm their hands at the burned out fire.
But it wasn't what he really wanted. Draco shook his head, and lifted the locket from his neck. Draco didn't want to settle for less, and in no way did he desire to hurt her. Making her jealous would not cause her to fall for him. No, he needed something else.
"Like she would be interested in you Gordon, I on the other hand bet I can get her." She could make out the golden blur of the snitch reflected in the dragon's eyes. She was flying closer now and saw the fire erupt from its mouth heading for her.
Harmony wasn't the only one looking up, as students shot passed her. She squinted at the black shape as it approached, watching as a bat like creature came closer till a line of flames poured forth. "It's a dragon," Ginny said, just as the color of midnight arched over their heads and a tendril of smoke streamed after the dragon. But it wasn't the dragon that made Harmony's throat constrict.
"So you do prefer me to trifle with you," Draco smirked, leaning in closer, "but I hadn't anticipated that you would respond to that so nicely."
"Shove off," she said. Ginny went through the painting of the fat lady and crossed her arms.
Mr. Malfoy stared at his son with eyes filled with amazement.
"Yes?" Draco asked.
"Ah, now that's how it's done. Five points to Gyrffindor for an excellent example."
"Thank you," Harmony said and put the rings inside her bag with the other gifts.
"Very good," Leighton said, "from the venom, there is the antidote. The solution resides in the pain that you are suffering from. In nature spiders, snakes, insects, magical fey, plants, and platupus venom have the antidote within. Every curse has a counter spell. With anything that inflicts pain, their is a way to heal. What we need to learn is how not to allow the pain to posses us." Leighton pulled from his robes a jar of clear liquid and opened it. He passed it to Ginny who sat next to him. " What you hold is a dragon's venom that could kill you a thousand times over. Get it on your skin, and it will corrode to the bone. Now why would I show you such a beauty?"
Alright no need to shout. I know where you will do best. It was lovely talking to you again, a much more interesting mind than all of those eleven year olds...
"You're a riot," Draco put a thick spread of raspberry jam on his toast, "I think you would like Harmony. She's coming over soon."
Though obviously, she hadn't planned things through, she didn't think that everything could turn out so wrong. She had brought no money. No way to contact her friends-not that she could anyway. And then there were the burns.
"Draco Malfoy," Ginny said.
"I don't know if it's even possible. But we can start by not getting at each other's throat." Right after she said that, she knew that he was smirking, and she knew that was about to comment on the 'at each other's throat' bit.
"Open," she hissed in parseltongue. At the same time the sink shifted from the wall, the locket clicked open. Two eyes peered back at her from the pictured windows, and she fell forward, almost sucked into the dark depths of the hole.
"And?" Harmony asked.
"Sirius Black."
"NO!" Voldemort screamed, "I am the most powerful, I possess the elder wand, and I will cut your heart out, Potter!" Harmony had to push away the pity that rose in her, and she shook her head.
"Er, I dunno, we found him like that." The potion started to activate in his system and he embraced the numbness that coursed through his veins. The endless blackness filled his mind and he allowed sleep to overcome his senses.
"Lies!" Kreacher hissed, "Oh, if Mistress knew what liars and thieves had ransacked her home."
"Like you could name me any better," Harry spat a tad bit offended. Harry's heart almost stopped when he witnessed something impossible: Snape was smiling, and oddly he didn't have the urge to commit suicide, but he wouldn't believe how beautiful such a smile could be. It blinded him, the perfect balance with such an abnormally large nose.
"Should we.." she heard, and Harmony moaned into her pillow.
"Our next destination will be completely dry," Kingscross assured him.
"What is Draco in here for?" Dumbledore asked. He knew that if he opened his eyes a crack he would be able to see the stars twinkling in the vast blue depths.
"Sirius," Harmony said to the wagging dog, "I'll visit you every chance I can." Sirius changed back to his human form, forgetting the bone in his mouth in the process. He sat next to Harmony.
Though he loved all the attention from the ladies, he could not find one he fancied. They bored him, resembled miscellaneous animals, or were fake in his eyes. A sigh escaped his lips as he once again had to pry Pansy's hot pink nails from his much abused arm. They rounded a corner and neared the Great Hall. "Pansy," he tried, "not while I'm walking, I don't want to trip and-" The door to the dinning hall swept open and the boy wonder brushed past him without so much as an apology. "Watch it Potter," he warned.
"You don't have to," Harmony said quickly, "I can make it."
Draco got to his knees to figure out how to carry Harry Potter. He obviously could not give a piggy back ride, for any drool stain would be an embarrassment. He crossed off the possibility of dragging the boy because then the nurse would suspect him of hurting Potter. He brought one hand to rest on Potter's head and the other on his shoulder to give one last desperate shake to wake him up. "Potter, Potter!" he called halfheartedly. Wonder boy's head rolled to the side and the fruitless effort stressed Draco. He was not used to helping others.
Harmony forced a smile, reminding herself that it was better if they didn't know the truth. "Don't worry about me, I have everything under control." They still looked at her funny.
She met Draco in the changing room, and convinced him to go outside. She held a note that she had forged from Madame Pomfrey, that excused her from class. Draco smirked at her, and as they went to the quidditch locker room, Harmony changed to a girl. The wind was frozen against her cheeks, and her teeth chattered as she flew, but she raced along side Draco. Her firebolt gave her an edge as they made laps in the field, but Draco flew on beside her, pushing the limits of his Nimbus 2001. Draco laughed as they put away their gear, since Harmony's hair stuck up, and looked to be frozen in places.
"To make sure that Potter gets the right ingredients," Draco said.
"When the other kids are out on break, I can go inside and find a deserted room, or closet. I know quite a bunch of places."
"But what if..." She clenched her teeth.
"Really?" Ron looked bewildered, "but I thought that you two would make a cute couple." Harmony looked behind her at the Ravenclaw table and realized that Cho Chang hadn't come to her mind in ages.
"So why are you here?" Ginny whispered.
"You could trick most of them into believing that, but not Blaise and Theodore."
Harmony was left to tend to her burns on her own using homemade muggle remedies. She had been too distracted to notice the blisters at Hogwarts. They had grown steadily more painful on the flight over to the Dursleys as the adrenaline wore off. But by then it was too late. Harmony was terrified of doing magic and being discovered by the trace.
"The Septicemic Plague Curse," Snape deduced unsurprisingly. "Present symptoms are high fever, vomiting, rapid heart rate, and delirium. All he needs is time for the spell to wear off." Harry wouldn't have thought it possible, but Snape did appear to care for him; poor Malfoy indeed. "Crabbe, you may leave now, and Poppy, force him to drink all of the pain killer potions."
"And if you don't, I will have to search for you." He winked at her, but Harmony doubted that the man was joking.
Harmony looked at the livid creature that was huffing and wheezing. "Just return what you have, Fletcher, and we can all forget this happened."
"If that is all, then sod off," she said curtly, walking away.
"Because the rat blotched up my resurrection, and I became incomplete." Voldemort took a step closer over a fallen trunk.
"I destroyed Dumbledore!" Voldemort shrieked as she flew over the dead man's tomb, making it erupt in flames. The fire was put out by one of the professors, blackening it, but the children ran with a new desperation.
"Let me hold on to it for a while," Draco said, "you need a break from a demented soul." Ginny gripped it tighter and held it to her chest.
"Vegas, of course. Where else?" Harmony said.
"Slytherin Prince?" Harmony wondered, already expecting who said person was.
"So who do you think will win?" Ron asked.
They were everything he could ever ask for, and they somewhat completed him, but he knew that they would eventually leave him to be together. Harry would end up alone. What was he to do as a male in a girl's body? How could anyone love him now that he didn't even know what he was?
"Yes, strange," Harmony forced a laugh and Draco watched amused, "though I never heard of her."
"Ron, you wouldn't wake up if I shouted at you that there was a fire, plus you were sleeping so soundly I honestly thought I would be all right if I got some fresh air."
Harmony's mind wandered, not caring to hear all of Ron's amazing qualities. Something was bothering her, like an itch to the back of her mind. There was something up or something that she was missing out on. Harmony ignored the owl post as it dropped newspapers and mail. But there was something disturbing with the owls. There were too many of them, and they were all frantic. Packages dropped into food and owls screeched in fear. And then they were all gone. The students anxiously looked around the room before unraveling their papers. The absence of chatter was replaced with gasps. Harmony did not have a paper, but Hermione did.
"I know what you really are, Potter" his breath tickled her ear, but she was unable to move away and her arms were immobile as her mind screamed for her to push him away. His low voice sent a slight shiver down her spine. Fear crept into her eyes as her brain finally processed what he had said. What did he know? How could anyone know, it had only been two full days? No of course he didn't know he was just trying to get a rise from her.
"No, it's semi permanent. Did you find all of the lice eggs?"
She began to pick the stems of grass around her. Peace, she reminded her brain. Her thoughts went through the lectures that Leighton was teaching her. The meditation would calm her, and she needed to practice the nonverbal spells anyway.
"Couldn't he be sending you something fake then," Draco asked.
"What the hell?" Harmony stated when the girls were out of earshot. "Were you expecting this?"
"Then it's yours," he said, "have fun in class."
As if cued by the mention of hurtling objects, owls swept in delivering the post. Flitting its way through letters and rolled bundles of The Prophet, a hand crafted bird flapped and danced in the air, before landing in front of Harmony. Ginny's eyes searched her, but none of her other friends had noticed the small folded parchment's journey. She encased it in a lose fist before hiding her hand under the table. Harmony pulled it open.
"I would think that there should be something to catch us," Harmony said. Three girls began to make their way up, and Harmony watched as they fell like ants before hovering the rest of the way down. "Oh."
"Draco, I will teach you legillimens. Look into her eyes and say the word. Go past her eyes and see into her mind. Push your own mind forward, looking for anything. Alright?"
It reminded her of muggle school when they practiced fire drills, but for the look that McGonagall gave them; a look very much like a bird discovering that its eggs had been cracked and plundered. She repeated the announcement, and when the prefects brought the last few children down the stairs with them, she started a head count. The relief was evident in her tone as she announced that all students were to sleep in the Great Hall that night. Ginny grabbed her arm then, and Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
All at once the pain stopped, and Draco pulled enough strength together to raise his head. In time to see that very thing that haunted him, the only thing that could ruin everything. Harmony had launched herself at the Dark Lord as a caracal. He could see the bones snap in the Dark Lord's hand. He watched, as she stood in front of him, protectively, and reverted back into a girl.
"He will ask me what is happening to him," Severus shook his head.
A lone whistle brook the chatter, and Lee Jordon's magnified voice greeted the school. Harmony straighted her back and leaned forward as the doors at the field opened at opposite ends. Green and purple swirls shot out and Harmony instantly became aware of who and what was on the field. The captains shook hands at the center of the field and Harmony watched as the balls were released and the whistle was blown.
She was falling, falling and squeezed like an apparition gone wrong.
"Please," she said, "go." Something grabbed his shoulder, tugging him back. Draco looked in surprise at his father, who was pulling him away.
More unbelievable than the fact that Snape allowed her to have a merry dandy time at Hogsmeade was that Ginny had actually tied her to a chair. The fortunate thing, thought highly debatable, was that Harmony was still conscious.
"You let my god father die," Harmony said. Draco closed his eyes tightly.
"Shall I take you home now?" Draco asked Harmony, to which she nodded.
"Shite Harmony, what the hell were you thinking?" Draco asked. "Does your life mean anything to you?"
Harmony choked out a gasp and the anguish gripped her further. She wrestled free from her bed and stood on the cold floor hugging herself. "Damn," she rasped, and massaged her dry throat. She had been so close. A hate bubbled inside. A part that despised herself for being alive, and another for desiring death. But what was worse was that everything surrounded her reminded her of him. For good reason too, since she was in his house.
"I'll get you, Harmony," Draco mumbled. "You'll see."
"Bye," she said and held Draco's hand. They went through the entrance way, walked a few feet inside, just out of sight. If they weren't so busy kissing, they would have missed Blaise and Harry's parting words.
"Alright," Draco said, "i'll see you later Sly." She smiled at him before wandering off. Draco could only think of her for the remainder of class, and when Leighton did send them off, Draco watched Harmony go. He barely even noticed Blaise come at his side, and stare at him oddly.
"Oh, anything will stick to the rug when it is in air." Harmony sat cross legged behind her teacher and freed Hedwig from her cage.
Fake-Harry looked over at Blaise, surprise etched over her face. However she covered it up by giving him the finger. Leaving him to wonder whether she hated him or was still playing the part of Potter. She started heading to the Gryffindor common rooms, out of his reach.
She walked faster now with excitement bouncing in her heels. She smiled at the prospect of flying with Draco that night. She didn't even care about the competition. Her smile lifted as she saw him where the dungeons of the Slytherin house began. He must have heard her echoing feet, and turned her way. "Harmony?"
She was not worried when she didn't receive any letters from her school friends; they probably wanted to celebrate in person. She gratefully accepted a gift from Sirius and carefully unwrapped the crumpled up brown paper. Inside was a note which read Thank God you were born. She knew her mouth would hurt since she rarely smiled for such a long duration. It was one of the nicest things ever said to her. Underneath the parchment was an antique looking mirror which oddly didn't reflect her face.
"Occulmency is strenuous on the mind, and you will have to practice often. My mind will be attacking yours, and I will be invading your inner most emotions, thoughts, and memories. I will understand if you are reluctant to undergo the practices."
Harmony and Draco were hanging out in a muggle mall, still trying to decide whether they wanted frozen yogurt or ice cream. It was quite pleasant at the mall. They were surrounded by hordes of people who didn't know them, and who they would likely never see again. She was quite pleased by the way Draco had dressed up. Once he had made up his mind to dress up as a muggle, he had not only turned into a convincing muggle, but a stylish one as well. Complete with designer jeans, Timberlands, and a fitting black shirt.
"Draco isn't his father, and he's not a death eater if that's what you're thinking." A deep red was seeping through his cheeks.
Harmony wished that she was dead. She lay on her bed, chocking as if the lump in her throat had grown a hand. Her fists clenched till nails dug into her palms and thin flecks of white pealed off. She hated herself. Enough that the thought of punching a window would have brought some kind of satisfaction. She had delivered Sirius's death, and her heart, like an open wound, festered.
Cub, meet me tonight at my den. Party animals optional. -Honey Dukes.
"Er," Harmony wasn't to sure where this came from, "what?" It was like the storm had passed from his eyes, and now he looked at her through clear eyes. "Anyway, what is this place?" she looked away from him, but was aware that his focus was still on her. Around the room were dark red curtains draped from the walls to the floor, and torches gave off a light smell of pine needles. And if she listened close enough, she could hear a very low violin and other music.
"What is wrong?" one of the 7th years asked who Harmony recognized but could not place a name to.
As if the room were a forest relinquishing its leaves- it felt bare to the students. They looked about unsure towards their professor, to which he snapped his fingers. Immediately the floor softened from under their feet, turning the room into blue and red blocks of padding. The two houses naturally separated from either side and Leighton looked back from the two and sighed.
With the Death Eaters gone, the three of them ran to the entrance where Ginny had seen Harmony last. Instead she saw Micheal Corner, someone who she perhaps should have been thinking of-but wasn't.
Harmony soon realized that the best way to alleviate her cramps was to eat a little of just about everything. Her plate piled with much missed foods.
"Only to muggles," Theodore smirked, "this curse only produces the symptoms and will disappear in a day or two."
"Very good," he said and tapped the wood of his desk methodically. "Do you two need a break, or do you want to quit."
"Like he would tell me anything," she muttered.
"Harry Potter!" Voldemort screeched in every students' minds, "Do not make me kill every child before reaching you!"
"What." Harmony gave the professor a hard look, taking in his broad chest, umber short bed head hair, square rugged jaw line, and honey colored eyes. "Oh. Leighton."
The two of them didn't speak until they were a few blocks away and signaled for the Knight Bus.
"His jar has been empty for a week," Harmony said, "but I'd need to go to Hogsmead to do that."
Ginny shook her head in disbelief, "what the hell? When did this happen?"
"Yes," she said, "and you all as well." Harmony lifted her hand and waved as the train passed her. The wind ruffled her hair and she shivered from the snow that tickled her. Even though she was left behind for the holidays, she rubbed her palms together and smiled. She would be spending Christmas with Sirius.
"Alright," Harmony said, and when Draco still did not move, she grabbed his arm and pushed him away. The other students were already out the door, and Harmony realized that she shouldn't be touching him, and dropped her hand. "The detentions are my lessons with Snape, and he wants you to join us."
"Voldemort killed everyone I care about. I don't have to do this. I want to," she reminded herself. As long as Voldemort lived, death would follow her. Harmony could never hide for the rest of her life, knowing that Voldemort was out there, murdering and tearing the world apart.
"Now without your wands," Snape said. They put their wands in their pockets and faced each other.
Harmony thought about the accio spell, but the room was still barren from when the students had smashed desk, and she had no desire to accio the many daggers, axes, and other pointy weapons placed on the walls to hurtle at her. She settled for the benign enough spell lumos, which she chanted in her mind to no avail. She could definitely feel the wood of her wand warming in her grasp. Leighton waited patiently, sitting and eating his little candy. She thought she saw a little light spark at one point. She waved her hand a few times before biting her bottom lip.
"No, sir." Draco said in a cold tone.
The girls called from where they stretched and Madam Hooch blew her whistle to get them in order. Harmony though was glad to see a familiar patch of red, as Ginny waved to her. She returned the gesture and sped from the large gymnasium, throwing her weight into the door. Her peak of discomfort transmuted to mild agitation when she noticed that Draco had disappeared. How the heck was she supposed to know how to get back? She took a few steps muttering about useless gits, when a shadow drifted from the wall on her left. Draco Malfoy peered down at her, looking sullen like a statue. Without a word he retraced their steps, and she followed him, legs working to keep up with his long strides. Half way back she remembered the spell she had learned that would point her in the right direction, but she went with him, till she parted at the Great Hall with a mumbled thanks. He left for the dungeons and harmony shrugged her shoulders.
She looked at the dough that was squished between his fingers. "A cat," she said. Draco looked to the book, and saw no mention of a cat. Draco then thought back to the other potions that they worked on, and then knew why they weren't as good as his usual work. He then saw that the dough had little clumps that had not been mixed properly.
"Professor," Draco said, "What if she tried to go into my mind, and see how I block my thoughts, then maybe it won't be so bad." Snape seemed to regard him with interest. He put his fingers to his chin and brushed his long fingers to his black hair.
"Holy shite..." Blaise murmured, not taking his eyes off the scene.
Draco had never thought that someone could work him up in twists and knots as if he were an unraveling scarf. He held her hand and looked down at Harmony, thinking that if a thousand dementors decided to crash the party, that not a single one of them could take away his happiness.
"I can't believe this," she hissed, glaring at Malfoy. He had taken the liberty to set up their cauldron and knives.
"Let's take turns," Luna said, "till we figure out how to destroy it." There was a ghost of a smile on Harmony's lips.
She left Potions alone and with her mind elsewhere while on her way to charms. Maybe she made herself into an easy target, especially without Ron and Hermione at her sides to back her up. But her housemates were close enough to watch as a spell drenched her in ice cold water, waking her up from her thoughts. Harmony gasped as her robes flooded and and water snaked around her torso and swept down her legs. When she turned around, many of the Slytherins were laughing and pointing at her. She wasn't sure who had cast it, and Harmony shivered in her wet shoes as she glared at them. Her only consolation was that no one could see her not so male figure in the thick cloaks she wore.
"Do not beguile me, I abhor liars the most." His somber eyes stared unblinkingly into hers. "Tell me what you saw." It was strange when he looked at her like that, like he could read her.
"Close enough." Harmony replied with a smile.
"Then it should have been Neville," Harry tried.
"No Ron, I'm not a pastry."
"I'll come back when you are feeling better, and we can talk more in my office." He retreated faster than Harry thought possible for an old man. Harry continued to grumble even during the nurse's rapid assessment, and he was utterly brassed off. He accepted the food given to him, ripped at it and angrily masticated the food when a wave of nausea forced him to slow down.
Later that day, after the sun had gone down, Ginny stared at the impatient face of her friend in the mirror that reflected them both. She was carefully applying a second layer of mascara to Harmony's eye lashes, bringing out the vibrant green. She stepped back to enjoy her handiwork. Harmony was a gorgeous girl already, just a touch of eye shadow, and a hint of blush made an impact. Like always, Ginny enjoyed getting Harmony ready more than she cared for her own preparations. She looked at the mirror critically-Harmony was just about perfect, she just needed...
"Guess what we did today!" Goyle raised his hand as if to be called on.
"Close the door. What is it, now?" She had not really thought of how to go about to persuade Snape, and she was not using any of Ginny's suggestions.
Class was over by the time they returned and Harmony went straight to Snape's office.
"My mum. I saw her when I was dead." Harmony replied. Snape searched her eyes, and Harmony didn't even try to block him out. The image of her mother at Kings Cross and the words he was the best friend I ever had flitted through her mind.
"Ron, I'll be fine," Hermione placed a hand on his back, propelling him towards the girl who had yet to spot the beaming boy. "I've just about had enough of shopping, and am ready to get back to Hogwarts."
"Yeah," Draco muttered. Harmony stared at him, knowing that there was still something more that he was hiding.
"Is this really going to work? It seems too simple." Harmony asked, looking at the slipper Ginny had placed by the door. If anyone opened the door, the twin shoe was enchanted to start dancing, and the two of them would portkey back.
"He seemed to like you."
The still clad girl, Harmony, tensed at the blond greeting her. She and Draco had left the tea shop, and he had continued to follow her, even accompanying and her when she went to buy shorts and a tanktop for her new class and recommending the shortest and tightest ones to buy. "You have got to be kidding me." Luna, however, continued to lazily analyze Harmony.
Harmony went through the halls, passing the Ravenclaw and Slytherin banners. It was near impossible to forget that the match was today, and even though she wasn't playing that day, Harmony felt the excitement build in her. She joined Ginny at the Gryffindor table and pooled her plate with toast. "I'm glad we're not playing today, the weather would have frozen me off my broom," Harmony said. The room was chattering loudly, and Harmony wondered why a quidditch game was brining such a fuss up.
"I will be back with you in a moment," Leighton said and left the two in a hurry. Harmony made an attempt for the door, but Malfoy just stood in front of it in a bored manner picking at his pristine finger nails. He looked down at her and a lazy smug look filled his face. It was like he found the little prize in one of Duddley's cereal boxes. He stared into her green eyes, at her short untamed chopped hair, at the place where her scare would have been if her hair was not covering it up. I know what you really are, Potter repeated in her brain. That seemed like such a long time ago back on that train. What did he know?
"My essay," she said, "see," she held it up. "This is Snape giving me an F, and this is me hexing the Slytherins."
"Care to join us for the Quidditch party, Saturday night." George added, addressing Harmony. She nodded.
"Hello, Harry," Myrtle giggled and passed through him,"what are you up to now?"
"Draco, you cannot be serious." Mr. Malfoy said in a low voice. "I won't allow you to die!"
"Good night," she said, and grinned at him. Draco left even as his body wished that he had just leaned down and kissed her senselessly. He brushed his hands together, feeling the lingering warmth of her hands. He wanted to roam that warmth, and Draco had to stop himself from thinking further than that.
"I'm not really sure."
"We should go," Ginny muttered to Hermione and Ron. It looked like Ron had a lot that he wanted to say and do to Malfoy, and it did not matter that the faking liar was apologizing. But the way his sister latched to his arm stopped him. "For Harry."
The windows of the Gryfindor tower were shattered in the fight, and Ginny flew around it twice before locating Harmony's room. She perched on the windowsill, silently taking in the sight of all of her things still there.
At the Great Hall, Draco sat away from the few Slytherins who ate breakfast. He supposed that many of them had hangovers from last night. He could see Harmony from where he sat with Ginny, eating vanilla pudding by the mouth fulls. No one would suspect that their boy wonder was dating him. It made Draco chuckle to himself, except when Blaise strode in the Great Hall and sat next to him.
"Interesting methods to enable foresight," Trelawny dubiously said with a sniff, "do you perchance see anything?"
He walked over to the muggle, wand in hand, and jabbed the point of it into the fat rolls of the man's neck.
Because you're crazy. Draco eyed the water like venom when Luna placed it into his hands. Anyone could slip it in a drink, and poison someone. It would happen so fast. "Draco," Leighton said, "it seems like you know why."
"Because it's embarrassing! Hell, it's a nightmare just for me to accept it, let alone the madness that would happen if it got out. I don't want things to change right now. Just this once, I don't want- I don't know- to be so..." Harmony put her head in her hands, feeling torn. She wanted to tell Ron and Hermione, but she couldn't. They had been friends with her for too long, if they found out, it wouldn't be the same. She was trapped.
The students went back four feet and watched Leighton intently. The change was almost instantaneous. Instead of a man, a grizzly bear stood in his place. A bear that was definitely smiling, but even that made it seem more malevolent. They couldn't believe it; they were going to learn animagus transfiguration. Leighton reverted to his real appearance.
"I fell in the pool before I almost crossed the rope." Harmony shrugged her shoulders and another stream emptied to the floor.
"I'll take her to Saint Mungos," his father said.
"There is something plaguing me," Voldemort hissed, "my body!" Voldemort clutched at the front of his robes, balling his fists and he stared with madness, "it betrays me."
The only good thing was that it was making her more aware. She'd listen to those around her, and no matter how many times they taunted her, she got right back. She didn't need friends to body guard her and shadow her each time she went alone. She acted like a caracal and slinked around the halls.
"Ron, stop it," Harmony glared at him, "it's none of your business who I become friends with." That didn't seem to settle well with him.
Potter is the hottest dark haired girl-if I didn't want to get murdered by Draco, she'd be an excellent girlfriend. Cho Chang could work, but she is too much of a sob case.
A white bumble bee crawled against the wooden panels of a low ceiling. It crept like an old man, slow and twitching. It could have been mistaken for a speck of dust, or a star against the vastness of the blackened room. The door croaked open and the bee made one last step before dropping to the floor.
"I want to apologize." She looked away from him, and Draco tried not to get discouraged. He barely heard Ginny telling the others to leave, but he didn't miss her warning look. Don't mess this up.
A gasp could be heard as Petunia stuck her long face over the banister. "Don't Vernon!" she called out.
"Nearly midnight," Draco said and stripped his leather gloves from warm fingers. He had not forgotten to spell them warm before he left. He heard a loud bang as Harmony slammed her locker. "Something the matter?" He put the rest of his things in his own locker before spelling it shut.
"I have, but that's a muggle story."
"Teachers don't usually allow that till you actually have another class in mind, she'd probably send you back to Divinations; plus she has a class right now with the third years. How about I show you the classes at this time, since Divinations is basically an elective it doesn't matter if you get into a class filled with other grades."
"I saw you holding hands with him at the funeral. What is it Ginny? Don't even try to pretend that there isn't something going on here," he demanded.
"You know…something to fasten yourself to so that you won't fly off" and kill yourself in a horrible fashion was heavily implied.
"Harmony... what is that?" Ginny asked her friend, shocked.
Though all he wanted was to bring her close, he let her go. He couldn't do this anymore, to be with someone and having it feel so right, when it was all wrong. He took a step back to admire her once more. She looked at him curiously. "Thank you," he said simply and turned away. He didn't go that far before he felt something tug at his arm.
"No need to be dramatic." Draco responded coolly, taking a step closer, lessening the gap between them. "It's a force of habit, really."
"Yeah," Harmony mumbled.
Harry thankfully didn't have to wait long for Dumbledore to return and told the headmaster that he felt well enough to make it to his office. True to his word he made it to the weird gargoyle statue.
"You may learn something if you actually paid attention, Sly," he said. Draco had started using that instead of Potter whenever they were in class.
Draco tested his extremities and smiled at their mobility. He checked the room once more and was glad to note that Madame Pomfrey was in her office. Potter's friends were not present either, perfect. He pushed himself to the end of the bed and allowed his feet to touch the cool tiles of the floor. He experimented with how much weight he could put on his legs and smiled when he stood triumphantly. He took a wobbly step towards the bed that had curtains around it. They though that would stop prying eyes, no Malfoy could be stopped, not even by curtains.
"Thanks Ron," she whispered, "I'm OK." Ron looked stricken.
"There will be more chances," Leighton responded. "On to something new, you can practice nonverbal spells. This is similar to masking your face, but now using an actual spell. Figuring and understanding different nonverbal spells will make you closer to magic, it will strengthen your mind by desiring spells without enunciating their given names. You could try shouting the spell in your mind if it helps, though it is unnecessary." He flicked the wand in his hand, and a Huneydukes candy flew at him. "It will come handy in a magic fight along with the stealth. Try it."
"Yes father, I'm fine." He responded in a flat voice, unlike his own.
"Don't think that Hogwarts is safe, there are eyes watching."
"Harmony, what are you doing?" Ginny asked.
"Yes, now what brings you here?" Many of the students stopped to watch her talk with their professor.
Remus discovers Harry:
The Dark Lord stood over her, twisting the wand that he took from Dumbledore in his long fingers. He flipped the wand up and wood became steel, elongating to a deadly point. "Such beauty," he whispered. Voldemort kicked the body over on to her back, and her neck lolled off to the side. He raised the sword high, poised over her heart. Even though Harmony didn't have a human face, the whites of her eyes shown in shock, and reflected the image of Voldemort swinging the knife down. She gave a low hiss, as Draco shot up.
"There's no point in you all fighting, she has a boyfriend already." Ginny snapped at them, sobering up the mood in the room. Charlie's face fell before he could stop himself.
"Then why isn't she here asking me?" Harmony asked.
"There is something else though." Draco looked around them to make sure that the others weren't sticking their ears at him. "it's the way you look at him." Blaise frowned, "like constantly." Draco couldn't flat out say that he was in love with Potter. Was he really that obvious?
"Harry, are you even listening to yourself? It's Malfoy! His father murdered Sirius!"
"You have serious issues."
"We're just supervising, sir," Ginny said as she eyed the professor. "You look different, more young."
"So who is she?" His father finally asked.
"Headmistress McGonagall knows, and a professor will come to pick us up."
"He might," Harmony argued. "The Harry I know wouldn't disappear without saying goodbye. Just give him time." The tea kettle came to a boil and Harmony turned to it gratefully, glad for a chance to turn her face away from Hermione's gaze. Harmony poured the tea carefully, trying not to let any trace of guilt show as she thought of all the other people who must feel the same way. Hagrid, Mrs. Weasley... Ron, just to name a few. Not that she wanted the whole magical world to know that she had changed genders. She liked her privacy, her anonymity. She returned back to the kitchen table, armed with two mugs of tea and a blank expression on her face.
Students timidly walked up to the front and eyed the hammer they were given. Only Crabbe opted to use his meaty fists, which accounted to a howl of pain, and snickers from the Gryffindors. There were hollow taps throughout the room, like the sound of screws nailed to walls. "Hmm, I thought that you all would be overjoyed to vandalize school property," Leighton said a minute later to the pathetic hammering.
Harmony hugged the man beside her and clutched his thin robes. And though Snape would be furious at her for being five minutes late, she stayed with her head on his chest as if nothing else mattered.
"What is she?" Ginny asked.
"Yes," Kreacher said, "listen to Harry Potter."
"Harmony," he said and held her hands, "what's wrong?" She wanted to pull away, and he saw that. "Don't." She looked at him, aware of the blush that betrayed her. That she could not hide, even if she wanted.
Ginny's hand hovered over her lip glosses, deciding, before pulling out the red. Red was classy, and bold. If anyone could pull it off, it was Harmony. Ginny handed the lip gloss to Harmony, and watched as she applied the red, completing the look. "Perfect..." Ginny commented.
They were told to keep their wands, and Madam Hooch had them run laps and stretch. A beating music filled the room, and the girls got in rows. She stood in the back next to Ginny and Luna, ignoring the ever present glances thrown her way.
"Good evening, Harry," Luna called along with Ginny. "You look mildly perturbed, get a bad premonition from Divinations?" She had no idea how to answer that.
"Wow Harry, when did you start smelling so nice?"
"I see," he said.
Ron whimpered, but kept his eyes on the Professor. "This is the third detention this week, and each time Harry has done nothing. Last time you gave him a detention for dropping his quill."
- Honey Dukes
"Thank Merlin you're alright," Micheal said, reaching for her.
The door to the room popped open and Draco, who had been leaning against the frame, landed on the hard stone tiles. (But somehow had made it to look as graceful as anyone in such a position could.) He instantly got on up and brushed the seat of his robes.
"Nothing," he said, "there is nothing new to say about the boy." Voldemort screamed in frustration. He stood over Severus, like a hungry vulture ready to pick out the eyes of its prey.
"Nah, I'm talking about that rank kid who got his face knocked off," George's grin practically consumed the entirety of his jar line. Ron became a blank canvas.
"It will not break no matter what Kreacher tries. It must be opened first."
"Don't be mental," Harmony said, anger rushing through her.
"I don't know, maybe he's bored," Harmony replied.
"Now we need the tears of a dieing pig," Draco pointed to a shelf too high for the girl, and after she pointedly stared at him, he easily reach up and retrieved some. "You could use accio," Draco remarked, and Harmony shrugged her shoulders, "or try to reach it, it's funny when you can't." They ignored Ron as he continued to gape as they worked together. Harmony kept piling the ingredients on Draco, and soon he could barely hold the list.
"Eighteen."
"Silence! You dare mock me? I will carve your face out, throw your remains across Hogwarts. Death will be your only blessing." Harmony was beginning to have a headache. Her wand felt heavy in her hands and she lifted it steadily in front of her. She took a step closer, anticipation humming through her wand. This would be the end.
"Who is this, Draco?" Pansy glared at the girl who had touched her precious Draco.
"For the prophecy," Dumbledore sighed, "or more correct for the answer to his ailment. But the prophecy wont tell him anything." At the mention of the prophecy, Severus clammed up, his face becoming blank. Dumbledore noticed that as well. "The prophecy still stands, but there is also a new one that I was lucky to witness." There was much pain behind Severus's eyes that he could not conceal, no matter how many years of masking his emotions.
"I've got a secret, but I need to whisper it to you." He could hear weasel stomping around like a troll.
"To protect you," Sirius said, "I'm staying in the cave for now."
"Really?" Draco said wrapping his arms around her, "well I know something muggles like us could do right now." And with that said, he kissed her, tasting the sweetness of her for the first time in a month. He looked down at her curiously, as she pulled away from him.
"Shh," someone said in the glowing dark, "he has super hearing, he can hear you." She was tempted to say that he had could read their every thoughts, but knew that she would be berated if she did. Draco took the list from her hands and read off what they were supposed to get.
Something in the unnatural and detached way Draco had said that made her throat constrict. Like something bad would happen if she let him go. He was already to the door. She should just let him leave, and make things easier. The others were standing near her, already putting that interruption away. "Wait." She said, surprising everyone, and even herself. She had not said it loud enough. He had already left. "I'll be right back," she said, and Ginny had an eyebrow raised and a slight frown. Harmony took a light run out the door, but she didn't have to go far. A hand caught her wrist, making her momentum nearly trip her over. Draco had been stationed near the exit. And a overwhelming smirk took over his face.
"I missed you," Sirius muttered, and his loneliness was almost tangible. Sirius cleared his voice, and brought a hand to his brow. "I'm not really supposed to tell you..." Harmony rolled her eyes.
Lights brightened the room. "Alright class," Kingscross's voice echoed through the obstacle like course. The walls were beginning to shake and join the floor once more. Ginny, who had been jumping atop the makeshift walls, glided through the air, before landing gracefully on her feet. Draco found his way towards them, eying Harmony from a distance.
"So which one of Potter's friends are you really?" He asked.
"Yeah," Harmony muttered, "we will do it to night. Tell Luna." Harmony closed the door and locked it shut. All she wanted to do was curl up and sleep.
He sprinted with a desperation that he didn't know he had. His gasps echoed with his feet and soon enough, he made it back to the three girls.
"What were you doing there?" Draco laughed, "you're one to talk."
"Wait, that's not what I meant."
"What the hell happened?" she said and felt a bump at her head, "the locket, where is it?"
"Why do you care?" Draco asked, unfazed.
"Damn it, just leave me alone." She walked a few steps, before he materialized to her side, placing his hand on her bare shoulder.
"You're wrong," Harmony continued to smirk as Voldemort sneered, "it is because you took my blood." Harmony removed the glasses from her face and threw them to the ground. "I guess it is only fair that you see what has brought your downfall." Harmony removed the magic from her face and a girl looked back at Voldemort. The response was instantaneous.
Draco kept a straight face, though his muscles tensed. He knew that this would have happened sooner or later, though not this early. "I cannot, father. I-," Draco paused, and met his father's unnerving eyes, "I do not want anything to do with him." Mr. Malfoy blinked down at his son in utter bewilderment.
"Continue," she said. Draco set aside his anger, and stood. He would show him the consequences of messing with a Malfoy.
"Hermione and I have had a bloody brilliant time."
Draco considered the offer, and nodded, turning to Ginny and saying, "could you take the first years back to Hogwarts?" The red haired girl hesitated to leave Harmony, but agreed, grabbing the hands of a set of kids and running down the halls with them, with Luna at her tail.
"Bloody hell, these girls are giving me a migraine. Why are they going wild?" Ron said.
"Not if there is a hawk and a lemur making a ruckus," Luna said, "and who knows, maybe a bear could barge in as well."
Obviously if they are inviting me to go with them, they are trying to trick me. He thought. Oh this relationship drama is so much more fun than school. It's absolutely ridiculous, Potter-who apart from Crabbe and Goyle is the least attractive boy in our entire year, what with those ridiculous glasses and the fact that he stands only at the height of a third year-makes the hottest girl in the school. She has got to be a solid ten, with that perfect figure, gorgeous face, and bright green eyes. She's a powerful witch too, evaded a dragon and the Dark Lord. And she's not a bitch. It sucks. All the Slytherin girls are either already dating someone or they are complete bitches.
Severus hated it when the headmaster popped out of no where. "There is no apparating on Hogwarts grounds," he said, "why can't you be a normal wizard and knock!"
"No, he's here," Harmony began to feel the tension of her magic. "He's going to do something-" The door that they had entered slammed shut. "Hold it." At the corner of her eye, Harmony saw something shift. She focused on the spot, but nothing was there, just rows of artillery.
"No. But at least you can take a few punches. How about we go over some 'muggle' fighting, before we learn more spells? It will be fun. Take off your outer cloaks, they'll get in the way." Harmony noticed Draco twitch his hand as they piled their black cloaks on his desk. "I'll teach you guys ways to bring down a man twice my size. Let's go over the proper way to punch. Hold your fist and arms like so," Leighton demonstrated. "If you are small and your opponent out weighs you, then it is best to be as swift and fast as possible. This way you land ten punches by the time he tries to do one. Hold out your hands, and punch." All of them tried. I want you all to punch the air for a minute with everything you got. Imagine the worst monster you can, and pulverize them. Begin."
"Whatever," she said, "let's just get this over with." Ginny painted them with much care and Harmony decided that she would never understand all of these female rituals. She would go without till, well, she didn't know till when. Ginny worked fast and spelled them dry when she was done.
Harmony was careful to tread softly over the creaky floor as she made her way to the stairs. The grip around her neck had not loosened. She needed water.
"Are you finding it hard to believe? It's the third time you've made your presence known." Luna said, "At least they don't think you're somebody else."
"I'd rather die than see my mother and you die in front of me," he looked away from her, "fucking hell."
"He!" Kreacher spat while pointing a crooked finger at Fletcher, "has been stealing from the dead Master and Mistress since a week ago, and I saw him in my cupboard. He has it, I know he does!" Harmony would not have cared about the fact that the man was stealing from the house, but the way that Kreacher seemed almost desperate and wild made Harmony really look at Kreacher. "Give it back!"
Harmony looked down at what she was wearing, and noticed that her black tanktop revealed the dragon tattoo on her shoulder, and that the silver pendant that curved in the shape of yet another dragon hung around her neck. "I love dragons." She admitted. It was true. Her respect for the creatures that began in fourth year when she faced the Horntail, had only grown. When she had found herself looking into the blood-red eyes of the Hebridean Black, raw unmitigated power stared back down at her. It was honestly a rush-even more so when the dragon didn't kill her.
"Well I have always wanted a girl to dote on and guard from all of the worthless scum called the male race." He gave her a wink, though she thought that she saw something lost in his expression. "I think I smell dinner, and I hope that Snivellus forgot the arsenic."
She shoved the cloak into his arms and went to leave the store. He began to laugh a bit and took her arm before she left. "Why are you leaving so soon without a hi?"
"Now, I have noticed over the years that certain individuals, not to be named," he ground out deliberately looking from Harmony to Neville, "need extra help, to put it nicely. And partnering those special students in need with someone equally inept will not allow them to learn," he then saw the red hair of Ron which he much rather wished to burn off. "Partners will be based on those who require the most improvement with those class mates who show the proper mastery of potions. Other partners will be based on equal skill. If I hear any whining, you will get a zero for the day, if I see any nonsense, then expect to see me for detention."
"It's best if you wait a bit, Cub," Leighton said, "till you heal your heart." Draco twitched over a certain word and glared at him.
"Dumbledore didn't tell you?" Sirius asked. Harmony almost laughed at that line.
The headmaster Dumbledore smiled when he noticed the green eyes staring back at him. Harry blinked and slowly rubbed his eyes when they widened. He could see perfectly and his glasses were on the counter on top of his cloak. He looked at Dumbledore questionably. "Er. Professor, What's going on?"
Harmony shut her eyes, desperately hoping that it would cease the contact. She felt the presence closer, as if it were ripping chunks out of her mind.
"Er, right." Harmony hoped that people weren't smart enough to put two and two together. She wisely turned away from Ron and Hermione who were making googly eyes at each other.
"Yes, but there seems to be a lot of people with air in their heads, and not just at Saint Mungos either." Luna said. Harmony snorted.
"Nothing important, I'm going to take a shower now," Harmony passed him what she called the remote before leaving. Each random button he pushed, the screen changed. Draco was bored as he did this, only watching because he couldn't understand why someone in their right mind would call this utter tedium as entertainment. No wonder muggles were such a bulging, half-witted and lazy subspecies.
"Harry!" she waved, and scrambled out of her seat to give Harry a bear hug. The boy smiled at her and hugged her back. Now the Slytherins had their attention as the boy wonder stood at their table. He could almost see the growl on Pansy's face and the hate on Theodore. Harmony seemed oblivious to the onlookers, and Draco smirked as he saw the glare on Harry's face that he shot over her head. "I haven't seen you in ages!".
"Good," Leighton said, "now try it." Harmony went over to the growling fox and tried the two spells. Instantly the fox stopped growling and bent its head down. Leighton turned to the boar.
"Potter," came Snape's low growl, "Detention!" Harmony said nothing as she wiped the vanilla, making the brown stain further.
Someone bumped into her, and Harmony fell against Draco. She held on to his arm as she regained her balance on her high heels. "Sorry," she mouthed, and Draco touched her bare shoulder blades. Of course Ginny would get a dress that would show a good portion of her back.
"You look a bit flustered," Ginny whispered, and Harmony snorted. She had most definitely not been thinking about a shirtless Draco.
Draco looked around once more, hoping that no one else had figured as much as Blaise. If any one who actually wanted to hurt him found out, it would mean trouble. He had been a love struck fool, but he was glad that it was Blaise who had warned him. As Draco went back to the dungeons he saw Nott looking like he had been wearing his own make-me-disgruntled-locket. Nott sneered at him, and Draco thought there was something terrible in the boy's eyes, something akin to a mad man's glare. When their eyes met, Nott winked at him before they passed, and Draco wondered if perhaps they all had finally lost it. He didn't even know if it mattered anymore.
"For what?" Draco asked a bit confused
All at once the water left her shivering body and Harmony noticed Hermione as she passed her with a worried look. Harmony nodded her head, and mouthed back a thank you. She didn't have enough time to change for Charms, to make all of the dampness leave, and Harmony sat at her desk with cold feet. At least she didn't have to worry about the Ravenclaws making her life miserable.
"Eh, she's alright," Harmony said. Ginny rolled her eyes next to her, and Harmony went back to her toast.
"Are you sure it's her?" Harmony asked, peering at the lemur. The animal appeared to understand her, because it turned its head towards her and gave a slow blink.
Fletcher frowned and with a shaking hand went into his robes to empty out his pockets. Silverware of all kinds and other magical items began to pile to the floor, and Kreacher looked on with beaming eyes. "And the locket!" Kreacher croaked when that had not yet been revealed. Fletcher looked on in disgust before lifting up from over his neck a locket that he clenched in his soot filled hands. Once Harmony touched the cold chain of the locket, she nearly dropped it. Her scar pricked with heat. With it in her hands, the pain disappeared and Harmony saw how beautiful and deadly it was.
"Ron and Herminone should be upstairs dear," McGonagall reassured Harmony, before she and the rest of the advance guard began to walk over to a distant room.
"Well that's silly…So it's for exercising?" Harmony pondered, as Draco nodded at her, having vague memories at a time in her muggle schools where they had something called physical education. "Can you show me?"
When Harmony stood in line with the other first years to be sorted, she was a little unnerved. Even though she looked nothing like Harry Potter, she felt like someone may point at her and say, 'Potter has returned' and everyone would cheer.
"Want to come?" she asked.
"That's revolting, is that how I look?" Draco snorted, "before we know it they'll think that-"
"Not bad for a first try. It'll get easier with practice. At the end of my class, most kids should master wandless magic basics—stopping projectile weapons when the wand is out of hand; that kind of thing. But I'm willing to teach you more, if you want."
As Lucious took one last look at his wife's prone figure, his eye twitched involuntarily. "Should I stay to protect you my Lord?" Lucious asked.
Blood rushed to Harmony's head as she held the locket and recalled something similar, some vague memory or dream that now chilled and numbed the very hand that held the locket. A great nausea welled in her and urged her to drop the locket. She looked at Kreacher's hardened scowl. "If you tell me the story of this locket, then I will destroy it for you."
"Since when can you lip read?" Draco asked as he watched as Hermione continued to talk.
"Those are thestrals, and only those who have witnessed death can see them." Luna announced to the small cluster.
The blanket snaked around Harmony's twisting form as she unconsciously writhed. She fought against her body as she relived Sirius's death. Harmony could barely breathe as the sheets rung around her neck, chest and stomach. She quivered and shook with the desperation to escape her confines, till finally Sirius's eyes glazed dead and locked on her.
"It is a Horcrux," Leighton said, "and don't think that it is only your burden to bear." Harmony bit her bottom lip, and shrugged her shoulders. "It would be foolish to try to destroy it by yourself. There could be irrevocable damage."
Leighton smartly chose not to go after them with battle axes, and instead greeted them from atop his desk. He sat with his legs hanging over the mahogany wooden frame and his elbows on his knees. "Come, come, don't be shy." Leighton jumped to the floor and looked at them closely.
"Call me Honey Dukes, and yes, it was peaceful." He looked at the others, expectantly. Harmony grumbled into her scarf, and Draco and Ginny shrugged their shoulders. "That bad huh." Harmony gave him a cross glare, and Leighton smiled pleasantly back. "Perfect then."
He awoke to the sun setting and casting black arms around the room. He nearly chocked when he saw purple spots on his arms, it didn't matter that they didn't hurt any more. He hoped that Theodore had been true to his word and that the pain was only at the beginning. Well Theodore was entitled for a beating regardless. Yes, one that would cast him into a coma, no, not a coma, he needed to feel the deadly pain.
"Come on." Faces blurred, blanched and nameless, as Harmony stopped at the door. She let go of the two girls and faced them with a small smile. The unmistakable howl of a werewolf was followed by four more calls, and Harmony knew that she had to act quick, before the doors locked.
Ginny locked eyes on Harmony considering her. "So you're sure about this." Ginny stated. And Harmony replied with a shy smile, revealing some of the elation she had felt since that morning. "Send me a postcard?" Ginny concluded.
"Don't worry about the trace here. The bus's magic distorts it."
"You wouldn't have had to, if you had just listened to me." His father retorted.
"But I'm not a doll!"
"Yes, I have made a mistake. I caused Harry even more pain, too much for one child."
"Really? I had no idea." He said in a mock sincere voice and moved an inch from the door. He really was asking for it.
"What is going on here?" Harmony's eyes opened from the familiar voice. She turned her head and Sirius as Padfoot growled on a lease held by an stone stiff Snape.
"Go solo," Luna said, "that's quite fashionable, in its own lonesome way."
"So you're just friends," Luna clarified.
"I wanted to visit you!" She hugged his side then seemed to notice Blaise. "Oh, hi." She looked around and saw that other students were staring.
Harmony collapsed to the floor, her body shook and her head pounded. "I see that you are in much need of practice." A low acerbic voice came from across the room. She bit her bottom lip to compose herself.
"Is that what you really want?" He asked, softly.
"Either Medimento or Vulnera Sanentur," Luna said, "Both will work". Leighton waved his hand for her to perform the spell. Next he presented the bird who flitted in the cage to Ginny.
"We'll come again," Hermione said and led Ron out of the room. Ron, still unsure of what to do, frowned. When the door closed behind the two, Harmony let out a breath.
"Really Ron, it's not so bad," Harmony assured them, "I'm used to cleaning." She realized her mistake as they looked awkwardly at her. Shite. She could tell that they were thinking about the Dursley's. "I can handle it guys."
Draco put his book bag onto the desk in his room and sat on his bed. He could see his reflection from where he sat, and knew that it was an understatement to say that he was easy on the eyes. There was nothing not to like. And his muscles were quite defined considering that the only sport at Hogwarts was sitting on a broom.
Meet me past third meal, third day, in a room hung with framed metal
Which did indeed happen, but not in the context brought from Draco's hand. Dumbledore stood from his chair gaining the attention of the present students. The winsome dotard took a brisk look to his lower robes, and to the student's delight, they were in place. He cleared his voice for effect as well as taking in a deep breath. "I am pleased to announce," he began as the students' eyed the pink fluffy sleeping cap atop Dumbledore's head, "that in celebration for Halloween, there will be a masquerade party for all students." A hoot of cheer came from the mass of students, and realizing that he was being ignored and that his tea was brewing for ten seconds too long, he abruptly sat down. The teachers had matching nit brows; save for Leighton who looked to be too busy enjoying his honey smeared pancakes.
"Well it was nice seeing you again Leighton." Harmony laughed, and Leighton winked at her, as he and Candice walked into a little store called Honey Bee Bakery together.
"Don't know any, the house elves do it for me."
"Hell no...I mean that class is taboo for boys. Plus, I just handed in a journal filled with made up dreams that I worked on for nearly the entire night before school started," Ron continued, failing to notice that Harmony had lost interest. "Anyway, think that I have a chance at Quidditch?" Ron asked to no one in particular. "I don't want to make a complete fool out of myself."
"But I don't want to break a nail," Parkison said with a whine.
"That's a load of tripe," Ron replied as he speared three sausages onto his fork. Harmony had not yet experienced one of Snape's infamous detentions. They had it planed so that the detentions served as a cover for their occlumency lessons. She sat with her face planted in her palms.
"No one is to know, but you should get to know Harry, she isn't like what you think."
"That can't be all," Harmony mumbled. She had to find out what was up, but she didn't want to go to Dumbledore. She could talk with one of the Order of the Phoenix members. She got up, and excused herself. She would reach Sirius. "Should I send him a letter?" she mumbled. No, Post was unsafe. But how? She went up the moving staircase, heading towards the Gryffindor common room. The people in the paintings were talking amongst themselves, and pointing her way as she went passed. The students who she walked by also acknowledged her, without so much as a snide comment. Some even apologized, and Harmony nodded her head. There was a first year coming down the hall dragging a suite case. Though he was going home, he was crying. Their world was changing. And they were all soon to experience an upcoming war. The wind knocked against the windows, and a cold draft caused the torches along the wall to flicker.
The girl reflected back had a smaller and snub nose, emerald eyes with thick black eyelashes rimming them, finely arched eyebrows, and her face had a soft and smother appearance. Her lips were fuller with a swollen look and small like a petite mouth on a porcelain doll. Her once untamable hair fell in soft waves that she knew with length would curl at the ends. She was glad to see the same black hair color and knew that it was her by the lightening bolt scar.
"Ouch, he's going to be in pain for at least a week." Draco practically imagined Theodore's death that moment.
"Would you risk everything to make sure that she lived?"
"No, a hippogriff," Draco said.
"No, the professor got some vision and shouted that I'd die a woman and some other crap," Harmony said as Draco laughed at her. She wondered why they were still walking together. "So I'm going to go to Professor McGonagall and ask her to switch me out of that class."
"Enough, Harmony," Snape said in what could have been a gentle yet firm tone. "Come here." Draco could not believe it as she got up and went to Snape. Even more disbelieving was that Snape touched her shoulder, and she leaned closer to him. "Draco," Snape ordered, "alert Madam Pomfrey." Draco looked taken aback at that, but he stopped his mouth from protesting. He left the room soundlessly, and briefly wondered if he would trust Harmony with anybody. What choice did he have? Harmony would only push him away. Draco could feel dejection eat at him from the inside, but he would have to bear it if he ever wanted to be with Harmony.
"Bloody hell, Dumbledore sure knows how to pick them," Ron muttered. Hermione swished her hand to get their attention.
"Remember that fifth year who tried out on the team?"
"I have my ways," Dubledore said and took a seat at the desk, he gestured to the seat where the students sat. "Severus, please do sit, it will make the pain lessen."
"Er, and I'm Harmony," she joked, "Thanks Sirius, I will keep in touch."
"You do not understand what your actions have caused, Draco! You do not understand anything. The Dark Lord is furious, and is punishing us. If you do not come home, you jeopardize your mother and me, and you will be as good as dead. I killed Sirius Black to please Him! Who cares if that filth lived or not, he was a wanted murderer anyway."
"How did you get here?" It was Ron that time, they were on to something.
"What are you trying to pull?" her voice came out strained.
"You freak of nature," Vernon deduced. Some things will forever remain. Dudley stared about unsure, but the fumes from the kitchen tantalized his hunger and he left unnoticed.
"Sure," Harmony said, "then I'm glad that at least one of us will know." Harmony lifted her potions book in front of her head, so that maybe Snape wouldn't see her. She glanced at Draco once more, knowing that potions occupied most of his attention. Since the locket had been destroyed, Harmony didn't feel like someone else's emotions were clouding her judgment. It started slowly at first, but she began to feel like she did before the locket. Even before Sirius died. A nervous kind of excitement bubbled inside of her, something which made her mind drift and think of things which she had tried to bury. Like that kiss. She noticed other things about Draco. He didn't stare at her during the Great Hall anymore, not that she paid any more attention to him than what was necessary.
But she didn't.
"We got you gifts."
"Really, it's abbreviated as Sex for the Magical Education, X-rated, " He laughed at her priceless face of horror.
Draco and Harmony shakily disembarked from his office, and Draco didn't want to part quite yet.
However, leaving the flat meant locking away Harmony, and she didn't know whether that thought appealed to her or not.
"Yeah, but why would you be at my door?" Leighton asked, not really caring for an answer. "I am quite too busy to inquire from you when I could ask your head of house as to why he is sending his students to crouch at my door."
"Great," Draco said, not wanting to engage in more conversation.
"What's making that hissing noise?" Draco asked. The hyenas were turning their tails, leaving as a pack for safety.
Lovegood is the hottest blonde in the school, shame that she's crazy.
"Hey, where's Luna?" Harmony asked, looking up into trees. Leighton checked his head, just to be sure, and laughed when he looked at his arm and saw the lemur there. She clung there for a moment longer before changing back.
"Perhaps, as long as Harmony can make it," Snape said, giving a slow singular nod.
"You just think that Cedric, Er. I mean Edward's hot."
"Do you have that mirror?" Sirius asked.
"Yes he can," Harmony stepped closer, "Kreacher I command you to retrieve what has been stolen." Kreacher gave a wicked smirk before a stream of magic shot from his finger and hit Fletcher. The man slumped to the floor pinioned and petrified. "I have inherited all that was my late God father's, and I want you to return what's rightfully mine."
"Harmony, that bear is real alright," Luna said, "let's split!" They went in opposite directions and the grizzly turned its head from side to side, and continued to growl. Its eyes locked onto Harmony before it began to lumber towards her. Harmony shot spell after spell, deciding then to stop shouting the spell names audibly.
"For business," his father said, which meant either for the Dark Lord or for the Ministry.
"We were trying to hide that we were friendly," Draco said cautiously.
Blaise spent the rest of the walk, watching as Ginny disguised as Harry led them to secret passageways that he had never seen before around the school. He tried to figure out her character and see what she was really like based on the way that she was acting when she was pretending to be Harry.
She looked at him, deciding to believe what he had to say, or call him a dirty liar. His dark grey eyes told her nothing. "Alright, Malfoy," Harmony said, "I understand, we can try this friend thing for real." The corner of Draco's lips lifted.
"What? Running away to cry in a little hidden hole." Harmony laughed, "right."
"Harry!" Remus's eyes darted to Draco in confusion, "what are you doing?"
"So coming?" Ron smiled, and Harmony sighed.
He told Harmony when they were in Magical fitness of what happened to his mother. "She's being held hostage?" Harmony asked as they sat on the bench.
"Now, first order of business, I want each student to destroy the desk that you and your partner share, but without the use of magic. If you chose not to use your bare hands, you may take a hammer. If I see any wand movement, you will give me fifty muggle pushups." From a small wooden box from the front, he pulled out a faded red crate of hammers. "I also do not want to see hammers thrown at other students. Or wood splinters for that matter. The desk is the target, not each other. Now begin."
"That felt good," Harmony said with a slight smile. It was quite easy, all she had to do was think of everything that frustrated her and lash it out with a swing of her arms. She was just glad that she hadn't embarrassed herself with a war cry.
"Draco..." Harmony murmured, as if the word slipped out of her unintended. He looked into her eyes and read the confliction there. That was enough. It was all he needed to see. Three short steps and she was in his arms, and he was holding her against him. At that moment she was the only thing that existed.
"Then why have I changed back?"
"What is that? Like 5 inches!" Ginny laughed.
No! Harmony shrunk in her seat, hoping that people had been too asleep to hear that she would die a woman. "That's ridiculous!" Harmony bellowed. Trelawny's eyes opened and she blinked a few times, a dazed look passed her face. "You know nothing, absolutely NOTHING!" Harmony shot up from her chair, fists white to the bone.
"Ah, but he was the fortunate one, at least he got to reconstruct his features to look better for the funeral."
"Hell," Harmony said, remembering what Snape had said the other night "who knows, maybe he will invite you too."
"I don't understand," Draco said, "what about Bellatrix? Isn't she upset about it too?"
"Master Potter is a Mistress?" Dobby asked, "why didn't Dobby know?"
Hedwig swooped low and Draco veered after her, the ground rushing up closer and closer. He only jerked out of the dive when he saw that it was not Harmony, but a mouse that Hedwig had in her sights. Hedwig pulled up from her dive with a rodent clenched in her talons, and perched off in a nearby tree to devour it. Draco took the opportunity to land. He lay down on the grass, not even caring that it was dirty. He stared up at the leaves of the tree, which were blurry with the rush of motion as if he was still flying and Draco vowed never to do this again. So this is why wizards typically didn't use owls to find people.
"For the Dark Lord," Draco guessed. The silence that followed was answer enough. "What does he want? Is it something you got from the room?"
"Er. Not anymore than usual." Luna's tarsier like eyes met her before they entered the Great Hall where dinner was just about ready.
"Ready to be-"
"I'm so proud of you." Lilly said.
Harry had a faint idea of where he wanted to go as he walked with his wand tip lit. He wanted to see if his weird pain syndrome could be listed in at least one of the books in the library. He knew he could not go to Hermione, for her nagging and fussing would surely make him instantly regret telling her. Harry breathed in the faint smell of old pages as he passed rows and rows of fat books. The cloak fell to the floor in his excitement. He hastily checked over the medical section. He wondered if he perhaps ate one of Fred and George's unfinished candies, but knew such affects would be temporary. No one had either hexed him recently, not even a simple itching spell to annoy him. They all probably thought it best to leave him be since the Triwizard tournament, four days ago, though some of them looked as if they wanted to call him a liar and hex him down for announcing Voldemort's return.
"A house elf gave it to me to destroy. He said that it was his last order before his master died. It won't break, no matter what spell I use." Draco was shoved sideways, and Draco glared at the red head who had stolen his perch. He took back his though of strangely liking her.
"Is there some way I can stop him, that I can read his mind and find out what he's planning?" Harmony asked, and he knew what she had been planing.
"I think it's safe."
"People never plan to 'fall in love', it just happens." Draco countered, while tracing her cheek with one finger.
"Of course, I'm sure we can arrange a doghouse in a corner," she smiled cheekily. He ruffled her hair.
"This is ridiculous, Draco, I'm taking you back with me." Draco stopped in his tracks and did not cower from his father's frown and growing impatience. "You will come here."
Draco shrugged his shoulders, "it suites me just fine." She sat on his bed, the only thing comfortable in the room. "Class is almost over, they will come soon," Draco said.

"What?" Harmony grumbled, "shouldn't I be the one to decide what I want to be called?"
"I can't believe this, Harry," Ron scowled, "don't expect me to tolerate him! I'm not going anywhere near you and Malfoy."
"Ginny!" Harmony leaned away, unable to stop her blush of embarrassment, "stop it!"
"You!" he spat, and under his breath whispered a disarming spell. The spell ripped the wand from her fingers, and Harmony seethed. "Who are you?" he asked, wiping blood from his cheek.
"Send me a message by school owl when you have practiced enough and feel that it is time for your next lesson." Light streamed in and illuminated the two.
"Wow," he said in what could have been a laugh, moving to kiss her cheek, and she moved her head to kiss him again. He went for her neck, and enjoyed the hitch of her breath as he gave her a soft kiss there.
Harmony turned to Draco. "I'm sorry, about him. He get's like this sometimes." Draco brushed the hair from his eyes, and shrugged his shoulders.
"And what kind of ring is that?"
"Maybe I really should cheer Draco on, to make Ron angry," Harmony muttered.
"Ouch," Draco said, "that almost hurt, Weasley." Draco continued to smirk. By this point, Ron looked like a plump cherry, ready to pop. He lifted his wand and pointed it at Draco.
Voldemort was silent as he digested what Severus said, "So my body is not complete, not without my Horcruxes."
She took the locket from her neck and held it in her fist. She remembered the time when she had been a child with Ron and Hermione, standing in front of that very sink. It was time to open the Chamber of Secrets.
"Padfoot!" Harmony whispered in disbelief, "what are you doing here?" Sirius gave her one last lick before dashing off, and Harmony followed the foot prints in the snow, ignoring the people staring as she skidded through the snow.
"Ah, you must be Miss Granger. It has come to my attention that most of your lessons were without the test of practicals. The point is that students need more than knowledge, they need to get away from their heavy reliance on wands, they cannot learn to defend themselves from the dark arts behind the safety of bound pages."
She had a wand in a small purse that Ginny had given to her, and walked as fast as she could to the stairwell where she had told Draco to meet her.
"So which one of Potter's friends are you really?" Blaise asked Harry.
"Should we wake her up?" Harry reluctantly opened her eyes to see the mammoth Dudley and his monkey gang who tormented her as a boy kneeling over her. Immediately she went for her wand but stopped at Dudley's peaceful gesture.
"The hell," she mumbled. The owl had flown away and she wondered what kind of encrypted, convoluted message this was.
"Yeah, Harry was staying with his relatives and then with my family the entire summer," Ginny said as she swished her eyes from the two. Luna continued to read as if oblivious of the intruder.
"Why isn't that hard to believe?" Draco looked at Harmony. Would someone else believe that she was lying? Think that she was making up stories. A twelve year old boy taking down a horcrux and a basilisk was hard to believe. Down right impossible even. But he didn't dismiss her.
"I don't know," Draco said, "I may have changed for her. It's strange."
"I guess that I'll just have to fail with you," Draco said. Harmony put a hand to her mouth.
"The Dark Lord anguishes, seeking more than your blood. He will steal everything from you. Death is at knife point, waiting to carve out your heart. The Dark Lord anguishes, seeking…seeking…seeking…"
"Ginny!" Ron reprimanded with a red face. Ginny stepped in further.
"Yeah, that's why most of us have our own rooms in our year."
For a moment she remained still, and Draco didn't know how long he could push away the pain that kept clawing its way to the surface. But then she took a small breath. At the sight of her breathing, Draco let go of some of the control and the tightness in his mind. He suddenly became aware of the forty Death Eaters in the room, his father included, who were watching him.
Draco looked quizzical "sounds fatal."
"How am I to look like Harry then? I can't go around wearing a skirt to defeat Voldemort." Harry blanched considerably. "I can't stay with the Dursleys as a girl!"
Draco panicked when he lost track of the owl. There was nothing in his line of vision except clouds everywhere, and he had no idea where he was. Draco hovered in the air, looking for any sign of motion. A flurry of wings brought her into his focus once again, as Hedwig pulled up close to him, and seemed to examine him with her wide amber eyes. If Hedwig hadn't doubled back, Draco had no idea what he would have done. He vowed to buy a huge sack of owl treats when this was all over.
"No," he simply said, as he took a ladle and made counterclockwise circles in the blue liquid. He had to concentrate. The room was too silent, and Draco looked up at other partners. Instead he saw Professor Snape's crossed arms. There was a frown on Snape's lips as his eyes were on Harmony. He looked at the girl, and saw that she held an open bottle to the cauldron. Draco grabbed her hand, stopping the miscellaneous brown substance from flowing in. "What," he asked, "do you think you're doing?"
"No, I will," Ginny said and already had it to her face.
Harmony looked up at him in mild surprise, "trying to find out what Voldemort is up to." Draco's hands dropped to her forearms.
"I have to thank you for what you have done," Dumbledore said.
"He wants you there," he said, as if it was obvious.
"Chamber of Secrets," Draco recalled, "like in the second year?"
"It's more than that, and you know it," Draco said.
"I see vegetables, rotting under the sun." Harmony watched Neville almost fall off his seat before looking up into the large brown eyes of her teacher.
"I think you need some protecting, In fact, I think I should join you," Harmony had her mouth open, hoping that there was still time to reverse Ginny's conviction. "Harmony, don't give me that look, it doesn't work."
She frowned at him, and Draco could read the emotions on her so well. "Hey Potter," he said and smirked, "mind telling me your happiest thought." She looked up at him before looking around them. There were some people watching them, but Draco didn't care.
"Magical Fitness," Draco said "the female population does it to lose weight or something, but it's like an unwritten rule that only girls sign up for it."
"You wish." She laughed, hoping that he could not see through her. His smile grew wider.
"I can hear you!" Harmony said louder than she meant. Just great.
"Not for you, obviously." Harmony replied and saw him struggling not to chuckle.
"You won't be saying that soon," he said and Pansy laughed shrilly.
"What is that?" Draco asked in an uncaring manner, as the creature hung from a branch with its tail flailing side to side. It was looking at him.
"I'll call you whatever you look like at the time then, just so long as you don't call me professor. No need for formality when the other students are not present. Oh, and remember that these lessons are basically secret."
It didn't matter to her as the girl's ears began to elongate like an elephants. "That suites you too, Parkinson." Pansy cried out in alarm, and shielded her growing ears from those around her.
"Alright," Ginny said. They all said good night. When Draco left Ginny turned to her. "It's hilarious that he's trying to be your knight in shining armour."
Before they entered the shop, dull flickering candle light trickled from the curtains of the residents' windows as they spied with swerving eyes the remains of the last light.
"Here silly."
"I thought spending alone time with Leighton was reward enough?" Harmony joked. Ginny lightly punched her shoulder. Around them, the bleachers began to fill, and Harmony watched as the Slytherins cloistered together while the others dispered like a cloud of houses. It would seem like it was three houses rooting for Ravenclaw. Well and one Gryffindor for Slytherin, she thought and laughed to herself. That wouldn't go to well with her house mates. More importantly, she couldn't help but feel silly for thinking that she was going to actually root for Draco.
Harmony stood by Professor Snape's desk, the rest of the students had left. "You wanted to see me." She called to him. He appeared through the door, the very image of taught misery.
Draco knew that someone was in the room, and he would totally take house points off for being out at such a late hour, because whoever it was had indirectly tripped him and thereby insulted the respectable Malfoy name. He grudgingly picked up the silky cloth when he heard another noise.
"As I recall, I was out cold, thank you very much," Ginny pursed her lips, "but this time will be different."
"Thanks Harmony," Ginny said as she turned to the door, "It means a lot to me. Alright, I think you are set, I'll see you on the dance floor." The girl left and Harmony sat on her bed, excited for the next hour to pass. She cursed as she realized that she couldn't just walk out of her room. she got out her invisibility cloak, only to realize that she didn't have anything to put it in. She couldn't just stuff it into her school bag and go to the dance floor with it bumping against her back.
"I sent him a picture of me kissing Harmony," Draco laughed, "Potter knows that I won, but still refuses to admit it. He's such a child." Blaise gave him a funny look as he watched the retreating form of Potter, and Ginny rushing after him.
"Nothing," she muttered and got on her broom. He followed her and they soared into the night. Usually as she flew she could forget about everything and just enjoy the sensation of flying, but not now. Not with her feelings for Draco making her thoughts hot and dreadful. She couldn't be with him, how could she? His teasing her didn't mean that he had any interest in her. Why would he have any feelings for her anyway? She could imagine him laughing if he ever discovered her tumult.
"Yes I invited her today," Ginny said. "And she's Harry's friend too."
"How dare you," the girl shot, "You're dead!" Some of the Gryffindors laughed at Parkinson's elephant ears and the girl left in distress. No one else came forward to say who had cast the spell. Harmony couldn't believe that she still didn't know the spell to clear the water from her soaked body. She shivered in her cloak and her shoes squelched with water. She hated the Madidus spell. Her house mates hung back a bit, to make sure that nothing else would happen before leaving as well.
"But you should at least watch what you are eating, wouldn't want to spew out a rainbow of vomit." The twins turned their attention away from Ron giving him a final pat on the head.
"Avada Kedavra!" he shouted. A green surge of magic struck the stunned form of a Hufflepuff first year girl. She lay as she had before, with her pigtails sticking out, except the gleam faded from her eyes, and she stared out with a glassy look. He pointed his wand at Draco next, who was hunched against the wall. "Come," he commanded Harmony with malice. "Unless you want his death on your hands."
"Nothing," Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
"Night," Draco said and went to his pink room.
A burst of wandless magic pushed Voldemort a step back as he reflected it away. His crooked teeth showed as flames erupted from his wand, and Harmony blocked it just as the flames licked her sleeves. She clutched her wand, as rage urged her to kill him. Curses and hexes shattered marble and exploded antiques as they missed their targets. None of the Death Eaters moved as their Lord fought against a fifteen year old girl.
"Stay here, Dobby," she said to the elf, "wait for us." Dobby nodded his head, and they slowly made it to the far corner where a stream of light drifted underneath a door. Their wands were pointed out, and Harmony held the invisibility cloak in her other hand before draping it over them once more. "Where are the dungeons?" Harmony asked.
"No," Harmony sushed him, "nor is this the place." She got to her feet and leaned on a wall closest to her. Then she looked at him, "Thanks."
"I think that's enough," Harmony said.
"Yeah, I think that I got the basic first aid. It's hard to practice mending bones when there isn't anything broken to fix."
"The horcruxes are gone, you made sure of that," Harmony continued, "it's over."
"Alright, Fletcher," she said, " if you ever steal anything from here again, I will personally remove you from the house." The magic dissipated from his limbs and the man looked at both of them livid with anger.
"So I assume that they sleep here and here," she motioned to the beds made into dirt nests. "Arricneo," she cast on both of the beds. "Also known as the Bucking Bronco Hex. They'll fly off once they hop in. And this will slap them silly," she pointed to their pillows. "And for giving me an indian rug burn, here is a jar of maggots and cockroaches. She spilled it on their left over food.
"That's because Dash has discovered a part of herself, her wild side." Kingscross pointed up. Draco squinted his eyes, and indeed saw a strange monkey looking creature. It was staring down at them from a newly forming sapling tree, and soon went to swinging from branch to branch. It must have been leaping eight meters, because it had long arms and legs that were perfect for moving. The thing was a fuzzy reddish brown creature, and they watched it lazily from where they stood.
"Dance with me." He held her hands firmer. Harmony then realized that the room looked very much like a dance floor, and she briefly wondered if this was Draco's intention from the beginning. She laughed at how strange and mental he could be, before nodding her head, and bringing a hand to his shoulder.
At this point, the house elves were scrambling to get drinks for the students who had broken into the Hogwarts kitchens. Blaise was glad to get his hands on a butterbeer because now it was time for him to do some serious thinking.
"Then why are you lieing to me?" Harmony couldn't answer at first, but glared at Ron.
"It seems like the Ravenclaws are wining," Luna waved her raven flag. The houses cheered as yet again, the quaffle went into a hoop. Harmony didn't care who won in the end. The most important part was catching the snitch. After ten more minutes, with the Slytherins slightly catching up, the snitch left the banner and shot away. She wondered if in the next game she played, if she should fly near the bleachers. Harmony saw that Cho Chang was watching Draco intently, and Harmony wondered if things had been different, she would have been sitting there watching that girl instead. It was a strange thought, but Harmony felt no regret from her loss with Cho Chang.
"The Dark Lord plans to hunt you down. He's going to go to Hogwarts, after you, and it will happen soon." Snape drawled. And seeing Harmony unfazed Snape seethed, "Don't you even care?"
There was a muttering outside of his door that made his eyes narrow. Harmony had not left. He drummed the fingers of his good hand, containing his growing annoyance. He heard giggling, and a sweet voice. "You are quite frisky," he heard from beyond the door, "you also smell nice." That was quite enough for him. He stood from his seat ready to throw the closest thing he could find at the door. His hands went for the paper weight that he used for grading Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors papers, all of which but four were marked with fails. But he stopped, and the weight fell back on his desk.
Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs dragged their feet up the spire, circlig their way to the large blue door. Harmony's nose crinkled at the smells of overwhelming lavender, pine, sea foam, passion fruits, and a sugary too sweet sent that mixed and wafted, permeating through her skull, and causing an onslaught of a migraine. The door had not even opened yet.
Her hands crumpled the thick parchment and she took off her glasses to rub her eyes. The only plus was that Dudley was out with his gang and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were leaving her be. Her temporary room felt so stale and stuffy. The window was open but that didn't do much to ventilate the air. Not to mention she had no air conditioner and the day would only grow hotter. She changed her shirt to that of a thinner one and hopped into her only pair of graying shorts. The park would do her good.
It was easy to slip out from the front without being noticed and she felt the reassuring presence of her wand inside of her pocket. When she got to the park's entrance she was glad to note that there were no children. Behind the grassy field she saw a cluster of lilac trees and she made her way to hide from the sun's glare. She gracelessly plopped down onto the soft grass and enjoyed the fresh earthly scent. She briefly wondered how her friends were faring before as she shut her eyes, thinking.
"What do you think you're doing?" she asked calmly before elbowing him in the stomach. He backed away with a bit of surprise then smirked.
Several eyes followed her as she made for Ron and Hermione. She hoped that the students wouldn't be able to see through her disguise. She knew that Professor McGonagall and Snape were eyeing her as she plopped down with Ron.
"I prefer to watch," he said as he leaned back on the shelves in an easy manner. She sighed and went about collecting three boar hairs. After two more ingredients, she had to start to juggle them in her arm. One of the last ones, ink of an octopus, was on one of the taller shelves. She stretched an arm up, standing just on her toes, and still only her fingertips grazed the smooth glass. She leaned even closer, the many selves marking her arms a bit red. She then felt something pressing against her back gently, and a hand reach easily behind her to snatch the little jar.
"Or we could just hope that a bludger gets somebody," Ginny said and Luna frowned. "I think that we should be getting extra credit points for all of this after school work," she touched her pink nose.
"Thanks Ron," Ron smiled, "but, I don't want to be a third wheel with you two. I'm very much fine by myself." She tried getting past his lanky leg, but he was a persistent wanker.
"I'll visit you soon, Harmony," Harry said, and they hugged good bye.
"If you teach me then not even Dumbledore is to know." He nodded his head slowly. "Yes, then I want to learn."
"Up yours."
"Hey!" Ginny crossed her arms, pretending to act offended. "Though he may be dishy, you are still the priority in my mind." Harmony smiled. "At least you won't have to worry about me falling head over heels for you, Harmony." Ginny laughed softly and crossed her arms.
She pulled on a large white hat with cat eats which Luna had given her for Christmas. She had matching gloves and Harmony double checked that no Gryffindor related article was noticeable.
"Tell me again why you are staying at Hogwarts over the summer?" Blaise asked him.
She tried to remember why she woke up like this. But couldn't. "It was a nightmare. Thanks for waking me up."
"Just wondering if the cat has claws," Draco murmured.
"Maybe there is another way," Draco said, "or, if not, he will create one."
He met her eyes, only inches away. "I'm sorry Harmony," he said, and she pushed him away. How could she have been so stupid. You are unlovable. "I meant to ask you before." Harmony sat down and regret filled her. What did she expect? It was better this way. She didn't want to be with him, anyway. "Harmony, will you go out with me?"
"Strange too that you don't look anything like him, and yet, look just like another witch I once knew. Lily Evans."
"Snape's cupboard," she said, "he won't miss it." She smiled at her handy work and went to Blaise's room next. Naturally it was locked, which didn't mean a thing to her.
"Oh really? Tell us who and which animal you think would be their animagus form," Draco challenged. Leighton sighed a bit.
"This enchanted mirror connects to my own mirror so we can communicate. If you ever want to speak to me, no matter the time or even if it is to say goodnight, I will answer you."
"Oh, really now," one of the three said. "Suppose you can cast it again."
"Alright, tell me," Ginny said.
"I'm not interested," Draco responded coolly. Pansy began to press against him, but Draco had already dismissed her from his thoughts. His face hardened as if the metal of his mask melted and contorted to his face. Boys were asking Harmony to dance. His body bristled. He got the urge to hex the eyes out of their sockets. He calmed a bit thought, when he saw that Harmony had declined their advances. But the Weasley twins were different, the tenacious wankers, they cornered her like they were hound dogs, and she a coon.
"Not try, Harmony," Draco replied, "we will be good friends." She didn't respond to him, instead she brought the now bitter tea to her lips.
"I'm glad that you're happier," Ginny said, "you were so pissy before."
"Now to finish Narcissia," he hissed to Nagini.
"This isn't a game," Harmony said. Anger fumed from her small frame, but instead of lashing out, she turned away from him and ran. He gritted his teeth. This was a game; A game of cat and mouse.
This was her victory, but Harmony didn't have the heart to put on her mask anymore. She flew to her window, collected her meager girl belongings and left everything Harry related how it was. With one last look she threw the invisibility cloak over her head and mounted her firebolt. The beginnings of cheers could be heard through the castle as the last of the Death Eaters left, and Harmony shut it all out. She took off, knowing that she was leaving everything behind. She was done. Harry Potter would never be seen in the wizarding world again.
"It's from Master." Kreacher's eyes were glued to the locket, as if it nothing else in the world mattered.
There was no red carpet, lit candles, or velvet love seat when Harmony brought Sirius into the room. At first she wondered if this was the right place that Draco had showed her. There were piles of furniture and miscellaneous objects, but Harmony could have sworn it was the place. Sirius, in his dog form, began to sniff all around the room. Soon enough, he found a bone too big to be anything human to entertain himself.
He got up and from his closet extracted a fresh school uniform. Draco's mind continued to wander. He had loyalties to his father and the Dark Lord, he didn't know what he would do if anyone found out how dangerously close he was actually getting to Potter. He wasn't a traitor. He had to prove his worth and gain his conviction. Potter was planting her own tricks in his mind. He thought back to the Hogsmead trip. He had been taken aback at how pretty she looked. He laughed aloud with no merit, at his foolishness. Of course she probably had her whole face warped with magic. He combed his silky hair easily. Worst of all he was beginning to change in his thoughts, conveniently forgetting that he was tricking Potter. He wondered if he believed the lies he fed her. "Of course I want to fight alongside the Dark Lord," he told himself. The end of October was creeping through his thoughts, and he had to act fast.
"Why? So he can watch me suffer." Harry stared pointedly at his Potions Professor who in return sneered.
"My Harry, do you have an appetite." Ron said with a mouth full of chicken breast. She could swear that Ron had little to no tact. Did he have any sympathy for the plight of the undersized prepubescent boy making his journey to womanhood? Harmony could swear that her ovaries had grown claws and were doing a number on her delicate woman parts.
"Of course not dear, it is a flying rug. Carpets have too much surface area." Harmony decided not to question any further. "Do you want to say goodbye to them?" she said waving a hand where the screams had subsided. Harmony could see the fear in each of their faces as if waving objects spelled out decapitation or defecation, each being seemingly worse than the other. She gave a tight smile and a small wave as she then progressed to move her luggage onto the rug.
Harmony ducked under iron knights that stood poised against approaching ogres. Voldemort had brought an army to fight her, and Harmony should have been flattered. A pang of sorrow welled inside her, as a chill descended from the castle wall. Colors swarmed and darkened, scattering her vision, and Harmony shuddered before a patronus leapt from her wand. The door was in her sights and she blasted it open.
"Just observing how idiotic and absurd muggles are."
"Must have been those nasty Gryffindors, right Crabbe?" He knew that cutting voice was his dear and faithful Professor Snape.
"Let's bounce," she said, and they ran through the Slytherin Common rooms. She checked her map once more, before throwing the cloak over the both of them and opening the entrance to the Slytherin's dungeons. They crept out and shut the portal, just in time as a few 6th years neared the corner. Harmony and Draco shuffled past the wall entrance and her heart beat fast as she had to do this all without bumping too close into his chest. It seemed like he thought of the opposite, and walked close behind her. "That was close," he whispered into the shell of her ear.
"Known?" Ginny finished for her. "With your business as everybody's personal amusement." Harmony shrugged her shoulders in defeat. She didn't want to be the boy who lived.
They both turned towards him and he gave them a bored glance, then something lit up in his face. She saw his eyes glow with a predatory smirk. God, did she want to leave. "I just though you yelled that you were not a 'weak little boy', but that can't be right." She gaped at him, had she said that? Even Leighton turned to her. Damn that bloody prat!
Harmony placed down her tea cup and smiled a small smile. "Isn't it obvious?" She asked.
"Professor, I don't want her to be angry at me."
"I didn't think that he would be able to put up with you every other night," Draco challenged. Harmony gave a light laugh that tinkled in his ear.
"Then you let this thought or memory fill you up." He knew which memory. Their kiss still made his face relax, made his heart pump harder. She gave a little smile, and Draco watched her lips intently. "Then you say."
"It doesn't-"
"I figured that I wouldn't play games with you and pretend to be something I'm not, saves us the trouble. So let go, I won't run away." She had previously thought that the Malfoys were cold blooded, cold everything. The only thing cold was the darkness.
"Hmm, is that so? Haven't had those curses for a decade at least."
"My date for the day," Draco's smirk persisted as his eyes traveled over the girl, "Harmony." The word 'date' had registered in her mind, as she felt his hand on her wrist, pulling her away from the other Slytherins in their year. When they were far enough away, she yanked her arm from his grasp.
As you have been aware, the Dark Lord is not in our favor since you have become a traitor to the cause. Your mother and I are doing everything we can to keep you safe, but I fear the worst is yet to come. Your mother can no longer leave the Manor, and she is being watched by the Dark Lord or one of his subjects at all times. I do not know why this is so, but I do hope that you will come to your senses. Hogwarts is no longer safe, and the Manor can no longer be your home. I think that there is still time for your act of betrayal to be reversed, but I do not think that the Dark Lord will forgive you without consequence. For now, stay where you are.
"So you do know," Draco said, "but what? You can't tell me."
"Will you stop bringing it up, leave me alone, and hang out with Pansy."
"Never been here in my life," he said, and Harmony didn't bother thinking too deeply how ridiculous that sounded.
Harmony stood up and looked at Ron, feeling the gap between them as the red headed boy scowled at her. She wondered why Snape was doing this, pairing her with him. They stood in front of the class with wands out, and Harmony wondered how she was going to do this painlessly for the both of them. It was strange seeing him giving her a look that he reserved for those he deemed as slimy gits.
"Hurry up, get in the car." he said shoving her trunk into the back. Harry held onto Hedwig and sat onto the green leather seat. The car accelerated in motion and she ignored the glares that Vernon was flashing her from the mirror. It was going to be fine since it was only a day with them. Harry had more important things to think about. She watched through the window the passing landscape and the void canvas of the sky.
Then her nervousness heightened, making her want to throw the invisibility cloak around her tiny body. Harmony had spotted Draco. He was thankfully not a walking diamond and no longer had to avoid the light as if it were a plague. She rose from the grass, and forced her legs to move. She did not notice the student's stares as she passed. Her better judgment told her to turn around and just hide. But she never ran away, not from danger: she faced it. Draco caught her gaze, his eyes widened. His previous sour expression slackened, and transformed to his haughty smirk. She stood in front of him, not allowing any of her misgivings to appear on her face. She had just surrounded herself between Draco and his friends.
"Is it even possible to learn it in two months?" Ginny asked.
Remus Lupin woke with a pounding in his head, much like a killer hangover. He groaned. It must have been a rough night, considering the state of the room. Curtains were shredded, furniture dismantled, but at least there were no dead bodies of animals. Remus rearranged his clothes, finding a new assortment of tears that would need mending. He stopped when he heard something across the hall, and he knew it wasn't Kreacher's usual shuffling. He unlocked the door and stared as if a ghost had passed.
"Harmony," Sirius said, and smiled. She looked at his taught face, at lines that she had not remembered. He did not look so well, and his long black hair appeared wire like. "It's good to see you."
"There," her voice muffled out, before she reached out for the latch which connected to the Honeydukes cellar. She put her ear to the board, and cracked it an inch to see for any life. It was clear. With a swift upward motion, she pulled her body through the trap door and closed it with a jarring clasp. All she had to do was wait for the students to start steaming in.
"Why are you staring at me?" Draco blinked at her.
"So, you're saying that the tiara was part of the Dark Lord's soul?" Snape nodded his head. "That's mental. So if parts of the Dark Lord's soul are destroyed, then he will never be fully restored, right?"
"Right, Potter," Blaise said, "of course."
"You've been holding out on us," George whined, and hugged Harmony, "I thought you loved us."
"Leighton!" Harmony exclaimed. Leighton's honey eyes recognized hers and waved her over. Draco followed reluctantly. That's when they noticed that Leighton was not alone.
"That's not how I see it. You stood up against your father, and told him that you would not be one of the Dark Lord's followers." Snape said, "Draco, what happened was not your fault."
"I based your image solely on that of James, including the glasses to make you in likeness of him. I do not know what you will look like, but recently the magic has weakened, so you have been turning to look more, er- like your mother, which caused great pain for you."
"Watch what?" Harmony huffed, already knowing the game that Draco was playing.
"I heard what they were saying downstairs, well, that you are possessed by you-know-who." Harmony looked down to the floor. "But that's bullocks. I remember Riddle's Diary, what it did to me, but that doesn't make you evil Harry." Harmony continued to stare at the floor, wishing she knew how to turn off the damn faucet in her eyes.
"Really, Leighton!" Ginny smiled.
"Hey, where did that bear go?" Ginny asked to Harmony's right. She squinted her eyes, and indeed the bear was gone. A misty light streamed from her wand. What was going on? She moved her wand to the left and not three feet away was the bear statue on all fours.
With the snap of a twig breaking above her, Harmony moved on, training her ears to hear all around her. She looked up above her, and then back on the ground to make out any shadows. Her nostrils flared as she picked up the sent of another animal. It was close by, and Harmony stalked across the brown deaden leaves. Her mouth began to water, and she slowed to a crawl. She only had one time to pounce, and she wanted to win the hunt. She could feel her heart pounding through her veins, and was overwhelmed with how natural it felt.
"But it made it sound like it was to be a boy, and apparently I'm a girl."
She said goodbye to Ron and Hermione and promised to keep in touch. They said that she could visit the Burrow and Hermione kissed her check sending Ron sputtering. She hugged Mrs. Weasley on the other side of the barrier and saw Uncle Vernon looking nastily along.
"No girl can resist my charms, plus there's plenty of me to go around!" She was momentarily disgusted because she could identify that voice. The fire brushed her legs but thankfully she didn't feel the burning, unfortunately the bristles of her broom alighted with fire.
"STOP!" Harmony steeled herself, staring into those red serpentine eyes. She stepped toward him. "You can kill me," she said, "but I promise you, it won't get you what you want."
Harmony was his.
"I would too," Harmony tried to smile, "I'm so sorry. You were right, we shouldn't have gone...It's my fault." His eyes caught hers.
Draco loosened his tie and then patted his shoulder. "I can take a punch," he said and Harmony snorted. "I'd go through much more too."
"Right," she said.
"She's your friend?" Ron asked, as if this was just as bad, "What the Hell?"
The harassment didn't end. Sometimes she'd be walking down the halls, and from behind a corner, a hex would knock her down. Other times a cup or quill would explode before she touched it, and Harmony knew that they were playing a game with her. She wondered which one of the Slytherins took Draco's place, if not most of them.
But she didn't listen. She stepped forward to the Dark Lord, right in front of him, not even flinching or looking away as he turned his wand once more into a knife. Draco didn't see the knife as it stabbed her, but he saw the blood pool at her feet within moments. She hunched forward as the life went out of her and she slid sideways to the ground with a final thud. And this time Draco screamed out, silently in his own mind, as if he were choking.
"Some bullocks that the houses should unite during dark times," Ron answered. "Can you imagine the Slytherins being all cozy with us? It's completely mental!" More names were called to be sorted.
Harmony had never seen a ferret so close before and was compelled to scoop it up. When it was close enough to sniff her, she grabbed it by the middle and whisked the animal to her chest. The ferret squeaked in fear, and nipped angrily at her fingers. She held it in a more comfortable position and the ferret stopped squirming. It was completely rigid as she held it, and Harmony thought that maybe something was wrong. It looked rather sneakily up at her, before poking into the arms of her robe and disappearing completely from view. Harmony laughed as it tickled her arms. It poked its head from the collar of her shirt before resting atop her shoulders. Good thing that she wore multiple layers to increase her mass, or else it would have been weird to feel the animal against her skin. "Well aren't you a strange ferret," she mumbled to herself. "You are quiet frisky." The ferret bristled at the word, and pawed at her neck. She brought her arms to hold it close to her face. "You also smell nice, I thought ferrets were stinky." The ferret 'ki'ed in response, and waved its paws around. She stared into its grey eyes, and it stared back at her. cute, she thought.
"Ginny and Luna?" Harmony asked.
"So have you started to bleed yet?"
"He is meeting us there, and we will have company soon, you better change." McGonagall said as she got a better look at the girl in front of her. "You look a bit riled up, is the wind strong?"
Harmony slowly propped her body up, to touch where his sleeve had brushed, but he got to her first, and lightly held her.
"What do you want?" Harmony asked and gripped the padded seat. In the few moments that he did not respond, Harmony felt her stomach clench and unease made her blanch.
"Yes," she laughed and shot a spell at him. The class was soon to find out that Draco was able to hold his own, by successfully blocking spells wandlessly, and that they fought like they meant it. The other students tried not to imagine what their real fights were like, and watched as Harmony and Draco laughed, enjoying their game.
"A little slow there." Leighton gave a wide grin, and Harmony watched as seven years evaporated from his face.
"Here is good," she said as she stopped at the top of the stairway where they usually met. He knew why she wanted to say goodnight here.
"We better destroy it soon."
"Ron," Ginny pushed her brother away, "you're being a turd." Ginny was shining in her flaming red dress, and glared at her brother.
"Ahh!" Pink seeped into her features "This is absolutely—".
"Who? Who is the Dark Lord—"
"Now if there happens to be a mace hurling at your head, you can't spend the time thinking about a spell name, or take the time to say that spell name. If you did, then you would never even need to use that pretty little head again." Leighton covered his mace with loving care before replacing it with a sledge hammer. "If you want a class that involves only the use of text books, then go to a muggle school, because this is a class where you will learn to survive in a world where wizards won't always stand against each other and take turns aiming and firing. Many wizards will fight dirty." Leighton took a few steps to a now vacated desk. "Your wand may not always be with you, and they will use that against you."
"How bout we play with their heads a little," Draco smirked, "throw them all off."
"Professor." Harmony knocked on his door.
Even though Harmony caught him less and less looking at her, she still knew that he had his thoughts set on her. He was careful, and it was no wonder that he surpassed her at occlumency already. Class was nearly over, and Harmony turned her attention to the other partners in the room. Snape had done something right with the pairs that he constructed, and there were fewer cases of fight interrupting between partners now that half of the school year had past. "Are you going to the Valentine's dance?" Draco asked suddenly as he mixed the cauldron. Harmony had banged her head that morning when Dumbledore had pleasantly announced that there would be a Valentines day dance scheduled. Valentine's day had never been something that she had looked forward to, and Harmony didn't have the heart to ask a girl anymore.
"She wouldn't kill pure bloods," Luna said by Harmony's side, but Harmony knew what Voldemort could do.
"Take one more step and you're dead," Sirius held his wand out and it shook in his hand.
"Did, you see that? That Ravenclaw chaser almost got a bludger to the head!" Ginny said and whispered what must have been 'wicked'. Harmony had not seen that, she had spotted the snitch not fifteen yards away. It was hovering near their bleachers, where the wall and the banner meet. No wonder the snitch was so allusive, it was blending in with the gold banner. If she were on a broom, it would have been in her hand already. She couldn't afford to look away or else lose it. She knew that it would be too soon to catch it now, anyway.
"Really? And you're talking about Draco Malfoy?" Ron shook his head in disbelief. "I knew your father and there's no way that he would have approved. There are better men out there."
The entirety of the events was barely able to process in her exhausted mind. Leighton stood before her and produced a cup of hot chocolate. She gave him a grateful turn of her lips as the steaming cup contrasted sharply against her frigid fingers. How had this happened? Dementors don't just appear like that. Sure she had a mad raving psycho killer and his troop of monkeys out for her blood, but no one else really wanted to kill her.
"If I can find out why my father was at Hogwarts, then maybe she can forgive me."
"Can you demonstrate the next lock on me?" Harmony asked, not wanting Draco to do something in his annoyance. "Like you really mean it." Draco looked at Harmony from the corner of his eyes, with something akin to shock.
"That is true, but the real reason is because it is more fun this way. Plus then I can look my age, and not have to act like a stuffy and sensible teacher," he smiled, and she laughed a bit, figuring that he would act normally regardless of the age he appeared and as abnormally as he could.
"Ginny, I think he knows." Harmony whispered as her right hand tangled with her messy short hair. "I did see him at a bookstore, and he never acted like that before." Harmony ended with a wild gesture of her hands.
"Nah, he was just trying some new intimidating tactics, didn't scare me a bit." Since when was she such a good liar? Maybe she just didn't want to alarm them. "He just said the usual threats and how his father was coming after me." Now that would be scary if Malfoy Senior would come on to her as well. She shuddered lightly, bad mental images.
"Now go to bed, its past twilight and it's a new moon tonight."
"Shut up Blaise," Draco shook his head, "go find someone else to amuse you."
Harmony's gray vest fell to the ground and Harmony glanced at Draco, wondering how this even started. He was topless with his hands unbuckling his belt, and Harmony turned quickly away. Even though she knew that he wouldn't do anything to her, Harmony couldn't help but think that something more could happen. Her heart beat faster, and she shook her head. What was wrong with her? She had seen so many of her house mates undress. She knew what a bloke looked like. But Draco was different. She had tried to suppress that kiss they shared, but it didn't stop her body from remembering. The hate between them had long gone, and she had already forgiven him. Draco liked her, and she couldn't understand why; Why he'd go through all this trouble for her. And even so, something was stopping her from relishing the feeling of being in his arms.
"Nothing," Harmony trudged on, "which is why these things happen to me."
"Try relaxing, let it be natural," Leighton encouraged from somewhere in front of her. She hadn't realized that her muscles were all tense and that she had gripped her wand to fists. "Forcing nonverbal magic is exhausting, just believe and want light."
What hit the dog was much worse than the crucio curse. Harmony blanched as she saw blood stream from Sirius's face, as if he had been hit with a crowbar. His eyes bled red. Sirius whined and dropped the leg to look beyond Draco through the eye that was still intact. The growl came back and he began charging for the doorway. Harmony turned to face Lucious Malfoy. "No," she whispered as she saw Lucious's raised wand. Her heart dropped as Sirius jumped with fangs wide at Mr. Malfoy. He never reached him.
"You're pretty good," Hermione said and she waved her wand back and forth. Still with each spell, Harmony's shield held. They expected her to retaliate, but Harmony just kept her magic up, watching as Hermione grew tired.
"Let go of me," Harmony said, annoyed by his antics.
"Yes," Harmony said, "I'm ready."
"I can trust him?" Harmony frowned as her mother nodded.
"What the Hell's happened to you?" Ron stopped walking and looked at Harmony as if she was a spider. "Is Malfoy black mailing you? Cause I swear if he is-."
"And the time before that, all he did was sneeze," Ron retorted, he was determined now.
"Alright, now, we don't want to lose anybody. On the count of three. One. Two. Three!" Draco latched onto the tiny key, with his index finger and thumb grasping the thin metal. He had closed his eyes so that he wouldn't get disoriented from the spinning colors, and when they reopened, they were all situated in Kingcross's office. "Now the next one!" Leighton pointed to a torn book cover, and before they could fully regain their balance, one, two, and three was shouted out, and desperate hands gripped the portkey.
"Who told you?" Snape barely whispered.
He couldn't believe it. The rejection hurt more than the first. It was unfathomable, and twice by the same person. Bloody Potter! Draco made his way back to his compartment in silent fury.
"Are you alright, Hermione?" Harmony asked softly.
"Nothing," Draco said.
...More of a reason to spend time with Draco. That would bring the pretty red-head my way when she wants to hang out with Harmony.
Three hours later left him appreciating the endurance of the owls even more. If his attention wavered for even a moment, the white of the owl blurred into the clouds. He would not lose focus. He wouldn't.
Harmony met his eyes and smiled. "Yes," she said simply.
"Almost," Ginny nodded, "which means that there is still light." They shoved their books in their bag, and Harmony, Ginny and Luna pulled on their warm stuff and jumped into the snow. "The wind is perfect!" she shouted, "Milvus!" A yellow kite trailed from the end of her wand and shot into the sky. Harmony and Luna sprung kites from their own wands and ran ankle deep in snow. A light flurry sprinkled their hair and Harmony balled snow in her gloves. She chucked it at Ginny, and sped off.
