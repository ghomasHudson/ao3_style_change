They decided to have the cafe open six days a week, Monday through Saturday, between the hours of 7am and 2pm. That would give Draco enough time after work to prep the various batters and grind the coffee beans for the next day. Sunday, of course, was their day to spend time at Draco’s flat and think up new combinations and flavors for the scones and muffins.
“No, Draco is sleeping and I don’t want him to wake up and not be able to find me.” Harry sighed and adjusted his position. Floo talk wasn’t the most comfortable, but it was the easiest at the moment.
He had been dancing for a good couple of months, and had fallen into a great routine. He had specific moves for certain songs, and he could judge the crowd and knew what days would be best as slow and sensual, fast and hot, or somewhere in a delightful medium.
I raised my eyebrows and made eye contact as I used the toilet. Asserting my dominance? I don’t know. His cheeks flushed but he didn’t look away.
“We can change that immediately.” Harry interrupted. “I have the paperwork down in my office. Who do you want to change it to?”
“Who?” Draco startled as she reached out to pat his arm. Luna always seemed to know when he wasn’t all there.
“No, he doesn’t remember that we’re dating.” Harry’s face flushed bright red. “But that’s no matter.” He waved a hand in what he hoped was an offhand manner. “We were only dating for a month. Not that big of a deal.”
The crowd booed, as he knew they would, and after what he considered an appropriate amount of complaint, he knelt into a crouch and crossed his wrists across his raised knee. “Not to worry, not to worry. I still have something fun planned for you all. Who wants to see a show?!” As expected the crowd roared its approval, and he rose to his feet and spun around, showing himself off and spreading his arms out wide. “Let’s get this party started!” At the agreed-upon phrase, the stage flooded with lights and Draco was off.
Kreacher nearly dropped the treacle tart he was placing on the trivet. “Master Draco! It has been so long, sir, since Kreacher has seen you. Oh yes, the last time was years ago, when Master Harry told Kreacher, he told Kreacher to follow you, yes, to see what you were up to! Such a clever master you were, Master Draco, Kreacher is honored to have you in the residence of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black…”
“‘I have to clean up Sirius’ bedroom’,” Ron mimicked Harry almost perfectly, “‘No, really Ron, go on without me. If I get done early, I’ll catch up with you all.’ Never does, mind you. We’ve all but given up on inviting him places. He just doesn’t want to go.”
“Not sure.” Harry admitted, cancelling the diagnostic and walking to the head of the bed. “Lumos Languidus,” he murmured, and the tip of his wand began to glow with a weak light. Gently opening Draco’s eyes, he moved the light in front of them, watching as the pupils contracted and attempted to focus on the light. “He’s definitely waking up.” Harry confirmed, ending the spell and reaching for the chart.
“I’m not an invalid, Popcorn. I can understand English just fine.” Harry stared at him. Not only had he not seen the patented Malfoy Sneer in years, but had Draco just called him…
“You can’t hide from the world forever.” Draco turned to fully face Harry, looking into the brown eyes of his Glamour. “You’re Harry Potter. You’ve defeated The Dark Lord. You’ve been lied about, outed to the media; by yours truly, even.” Harry grimaced, and Draco knew he was remembering fourth year when he told Rita Skeeter his secrets during the Triwizard Tournament. “What I’m getting at, is that no matter what, someone is going to put you in the spotlight because of who you are. It’s up to you to decide how to handle it. If you want to continue wearing Glamours when going out, then that’s up to you. I, personally, think that Harry-Sodding-Potter can handle a little bit of the bullshit, if only you’d let it go immediately.”
The front door chimed and Draco called, “Be with you in a moment!” He glanced at the clock - it was five minutes until close. Not many people would come in this late; everyone knew they usually ran out of their pastries by this time, if not sooner.
“Erm… Harry is fine,” Harry tried to smile, and Draco placed a comforting hand on his arm. “And yeah, I am. I… I guess I work here now.”
“Hey Draco, I’m so sorry I’m late,” he panted, vaulting over the counter and hurriedly placing his wand in the receptacle, “I was trying to fix up the old stove in the kitchen, and it ended up spewing flames at me… Kreacher got it under control, but...” his voice grew muffled as he made his way into the kitchen. “Everything set out for me? Anything I need to know?”
Pulling his wand from his arm holster, Draco set it on the nightstand and shot a scathing look at Harry. “Don’t call me that.”
Harry sighed. He knew he didn’t have to disclose everything to her, so he decided to gloss over the morning incident. “We woke up together, cuddling. I ran away, he went to make tea, then got angry with me and said he got a letter from Blaise. After a bit more arguing, he left and Flooed to Blaise’s, and then I called you.”
The front door of Number 12 Grimmauld Place unlocked at Harry’s touch. Draco tried not to let on, but was always impressed at the way Harry handled wandless magic. As he trailed behind Harry, he glanced around at the old Black residence. It felt almost cheerful; the light from the midafternoon sun was streaming through several open windows and the house smelled faintly of lemon and treacle tart.
Of course that was the next question Draco would ask. Harry felt his face grow hot and he took a drink of water to give him time to think. The easy answer to that was no, they were not shagging. The more difficult, albeit more honest answer, would be ‘not yet’. “No,” Harry finally settled on, “We’re not shagging.”
“I don't know, alright?” Draco exploded, “I don’t know him, I don’t know his wife, I don’t know me, but for whatever reason, I remember your stupid face and that I call you by your stupid surname. Is that what you want to hear?” Tears were shining in his eyes, but he was too proud to let them fall.
He enjoyed the goth nights to no end at The Castle - a night away from magic, the Manor, anything that could possibly tie him to the wizarding world.
“Froooooozen in time without your touch, without your looooove….” Draco sang as he pulled the last trays of scones out of the oven, “Only youuuu are the life among the de-” He started as he saw a blonde head whirl past him, then smiled. It must be 6:33am, since that’s when Luna insisted on arriving every day. “Luna!” He called, “Stock the front cabinets for me?”
“It would be good for both of you.” Luna was persistent. “I know how lonely you get, Harry. And, you’re the only person Draco trusts to be back here without his constant supervision.”
“No, of course not,” Draco quickly responded, taking a step back and running a hand through his hair. “This is all new, I got carried away…”
Draco took a deep breath as he walked down the stairs of the stage, watching Alyce and Potter’s interaction. She had just switched his drink out and said something that caused him to stiffen …
Draco rolled his eyes. “Not that it’s any of your business, but while I’m not dating at the moment, I am most definitely interested in someone, and that someone isn’t you. Do you want your coffee?”
A loud beeping caused them all to jump, and Draco swore and rushed back into the kitchen, pressing the flashing timer and flipping the mixer off. “Time for mix-ins!” Luna exclaimed, and the three others filed into the kitchen, first depositing their wands like the sign commanded.
“Should have chosen a different Glamour,” Harry complained next to him, giving his scraggly, sandy blond beard a scratch. “This is not comfortable at all.”
“That’s fine. Seems like you’re back with me.” Draco gave him a half smile and handed him the glass of water. Harry took a small sip and rubbed at his eyes.
He turned back to Malfoy, who was pulling him through the throngs of people towards the center of the dancefloor. Once he was satisfied, he whirled to face Harry with a coy smile. “Come on.” His mouth brushed against Harry’s ear and the quiet words when straight to his groin. Willing his body not to respond too much, Harry strained to hear the music over his wildly thumping heart and tentatively began to move. Malfoy slotted his thigh in between Harry’s legs and pulled him close, one hand at the small of his back, the other coming up to run through his own long hair. “Feel the music,” he murmured, directing Harry’s movements.
Draco was alone in his room by the time Harry returned, but the telltale signs of a Blaise Tantrum were there - the cup of tea Draco had requested was on the table by his bed, and there was a large splatter on the wall where it appeared someone had thrown their coffee.
It was just a matter of turning his head just slightly, and his lips would brush against Malfoy’s, and he would finally know what it felt like.
“They’ll show up in Healer Douglas’s office in a mo’. Do you have everything?” Harry glanced around the room, noticing for the first time that Draco didn’t really have anything of his own in the room, minus the clothing he was now wearing.
“What?” Slowly, he approached the bed, watching as Harry’s movements grew more frenzied. “What do you mean, ‘you’re not real’?” Harry managed to throw himself off the far side of the bed and stood on shaky legs, his eyes squinted, probably looking for his glasses or his wand.
“Not deaf,” his voice was low and ragged, “It’s just easier to sign when it’s loud and after I’ve been shouting and singing.” Pulling away, he gave Harry a full smile, then his eyes swept down, a look of appreciation crossing his face. Harry was, yet again, in a v-neck shirt, charcoal grey this time, and had worn the same dragonhide pants as last Friday. He flushed as Malfoy’s onceover.
who you were. If she could tell, then who else is going to call you out?” The ferret yawned, and stared at Harry, the disdain palpable. “Well, I’m glad you’re fine with this.” Harry slammed the front door and strode through the foyer and into the sitting room, throwing himself onto the old, floral printed couch he had inherited from Sirius.
“Seems a bit unprofessional, living with your patient.” Draco crossed his arms and looked pointedly away from Harry. “I don’t think you know what you’re talking about.”
“Not interested, Granger.” Blaise interrupted. “I’m hungry, tired, grumpy, and I haven’t spoken to my wife in days. I’m sure you’ll send a Patronus if there’s any update. Good day.” He swept from the room, leaving Ron and Hermione to look at each other in bewilderment.
He made sure to brush against Potter’s arm as he completed his normal ritual of asking Alyce for a water using sign language. This time, it wasn’t just because his voice was hoarse from his performance; oh no. This was its own special performance - something he was putting on specifically for Potter.
A chorus of boos rose from the crowd, and Malfoy dropped into an elegant crouch, resting his wrists on his knees and glanced around the people in front of him. “Not to worry, not to worry. I still have something fun planned for you all. Who wants to see a show?!” The response was deafening, and with a nod to the DJ, Malfoy rose to his feet and twirled around, his arms held wide. “Let’s get this party started!” With that, the stage flooded with a multitude of different colors and the music began again.
“Well, James, first things first, I know you’re a wizard.” The eye contact was intoxicating, but he willed himself to stay calm and poised. “The magic you exude is extremely powerful, especially around so many non-magical beings.” Not a complete lie; he could definitely feel the tingle of Potter’s magic, but it wasn’t any greater than his own. Taking a chance, he leaned closer and breathed into Potter’s ear, relishing in the shiver it caused. “Second thing,” he continued, “I saw you last Friday, watching me. I saw you run away. And I can
He had removed the now toasted bread from the oven and was flattening the shortbread dough into a pie tin when Harry padded out of his bedroom, looking flushed but none the worse for wear.
“Where’s your wand?” Harry asked curiously, watching as Draco rolled the lemon on the counter before deftly slicing it in half and squeezing the juice into the pan.
The silence was deafening. Usually, he and Harry would talk about the day or discuss plans for after work, but Harry appeared to be brooding and Draco didn’t want to bother him. He knew that sometimes, the silence was necessary to process, and that Harry would speak when he wanted to.
“You just read that on your chart,” Harry tried to tug it away from him, “You don’t know what your name is.”
Healer Douglas regarded Harry for a moment before giving a swift nod. “That sounds like the best course of action. And of course I’ll grant your sabbatical, Healer Potter. You’ve been an asset to St. Mungo's from the moment you finished your training and haven’t missed a single day of work since.” Rifling through the papers on his desk, he pulled out a blank sheet of parchment and tapped his wand to it. Ink bloomed from the tip, writing out the verbiage for Harry’s sabbatical. “Three months ought to do it, yeah?” He asked Harry absently, sliding the parchment across his desk. Harry blanched. He thought he’d be lucky to get two weeks off, but a full three months would be plenty of time to help Draco and possibly find a cure.
“It’ll take me about thirty to get things in order here, so don’t worry, Luna. I’ll also walk home just to give you a little more time, how’s that sound?”
“That sounds fine.” Draco flicked off the lights as he and Harry left the kitchen, grabbing their wands on the way out. “I’m guessing we’re going to skip the movie tonight?”
Hermione narrowed her eyes. “What’s it’s name?” She asked, looking at the ferret suspiciously. The ferret gazed back at Hermione, not breaking eye contact.
Draco paused and glared at the ground, fresh tears running down his cheeks. “I’m… I’m not really like that, am I?” He questioned. “I’m not the… the slag Blaise was making me out to be?”
“We’re only looking out for you, Harry.” Hermione pulled him into a crushing embrace, as Ron nodded behind her. “We don’t want to see you hurt.”
Draco lowered his eyes to his hands and picked absently at a fingernail. “Then you are well aware of my inclination towards the male gender?”
“No shit.” Harry said under his breath, watching Malfoy climbing down the ladder. The bartender laughed and extended her hand.
Making a mental note to speak to Carl about a shorter set next week, he watched from the shadows as Potter brought a hand to his lips, his cheeks flushed red, before he turned and made his way to the club’s exit.
“I checked out some books from the library!” Hermione waved her wand and a stack of heavy books landed neatly next to her. “I don’t mind doing some research. It’s been a while since I’ve read a good book.”
“Do you have a mirror? Or do you know how to do a Glamour?” Harry asked sheepishly, pausing before the front door. Draco turned to look at him, confused.
With a sudden surge of courage, Harry tapped Malfoy on the shoulder. Waiting until he turned to face him, Harry brought his index and middle fingers up to ear and tapped twice with a quizzical look on his face. Malfoy gave him a half smile, shook his head, and leaned in to speak into Harry’s ear.
“I don’t know, I’m not a healer like you. Something about recognizing your surroundings, or some shite.”
kitchen to do with what he liked. He had full creative control over everything, and that thought filled him with pride.
“Sounds like a plan. We can all let go a little.” He glanced over at Harry, who was still standing in the doorway to the kitchen, looking out of place. “Potter,” he gestured, “Come and have a drink.” Harry hesitated and took a few tentative steps into the kitchen before Hermione stalked over and engulfed him in a bone-crushing hug.
“I’m not going to force him into a relationship he doesn’t even remember.” Harry said through gritted teeth. “That’s not why I invited him home with me. He lived there before we were dating too. It’s still his home.”
“Is that a wand in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” Malfoy’s voice brought him crashing down out of his thoughts.
“Pretty hot, huh?” The female bartender who had served him earlier said happily, cleaning out a glass as she leaned towards Harry. “He’s been coming here for a few months; caught the owner’s eye right away. He was always dancing alone, but something about him was just mesmerizing, to everyone.”
“He is, thank you so much for asking.” Ms. Benson took the cup and inhaled the fragrant drink. “Smells heavenly, just like always! Happy birthday, my dear. I’ll see you bright and early on Monday!” She turned to leave, and Draco busied himself with wiping down his counters before grabbing the basket with a lone blueberry scone - the only leftover pastry of the day - and taking it to the back.
“Could just take it off.” Draco suggested mildly, sipping his juice. The look Harry gave him could have melted a glacier, but it only made Draco chuckle. “If you’re uncomfortable, no reason to have it on, right? We’re meeting our friends. They know who you are. Might as well look like you.”
He took the stairs two at a time, almost tripping at the bottom, before stumbling into the brightly lit kitchen. Draco was there, two steaming cups of tea sitting on the counter. He stared at Draco awkwardly, mouth opening and closing as he tried to figure out what to say.
“You’re trusting me to clean out your expensive espresso machine?” Harry chewed on his bottom lip. “What if I mess it up?”
I’m the one who protects the ones who need it most. You’d be surprised at how much violence Voldemort left in his wake.
“Well, now that I have thoroughly worn out my welcome, I’m going to take my leave now.” He began to edge toward the door, stopping when he heard Draco laugh again. “What?”
He raised his wand to blast through the door - and I was on him in an instant. I pushed him down and back, my knee digging into his sternum, my hands at his throat. He choked, and couldn’t keep his charm up. It dropped -
As Harry pushed open the door at the top of the stairs, he made a mental note to thank Ron and Hermione for everything they did for him. Draco hadn’t been sleeping in his room since they started dating, and Harry knew it would have been as dusty as the rest of the house. It appeared that they had run a scouring charm across all surfaces, and even made up Draco’s bed with the vibrant purple silk sheets he favored.
“No buts!” Ginny cut him off. “You said you were going to use a Glamour for next time. What were you thinking? Blond? Red hair?” She smirked as Harry scrubbed a hand through his black tresses.
Flashing the ID he had created (he didn’t think the club would take too kindly to his Auror badge as ID, though the thought had entertained him), he was granted access and was instantly overwhelmed by heat. To his right was a little alcove with a small bar and an outside area; Ginny had told him that was the calmer area. He was more interested in the staircase to his left, which promised the larger dance floor and live DJ.
“What did you call me?” Harry breathed, watching the emotions flit across Draco’s face. The Draught of Peace was doing its job, but it was a low dose, so that Draco could still have a clear mind - or, at least, as clear as the amnesia would let him have.
It was with sick pleasure that Draco informed each and every person who asked that the artist was dead and that the tattoo on his arm was the last Mark he’d ever make.
He allowed Potter to stumble over his words for a moment, sipping his water and watching the dance floor. Should he invite Potter out to dance, only to take him home at the end of the night? Or should he keep him wanting more…
“Can I help you?” He asked stiffly, crossing his arms. He gave Ethan what he hoped was a disinterested look, but that didn’t appear to deter him in the least.
“You’ve been going by Draco Black for years,” Ron said quietly, “When your father died, you renounced the Malfoy name. It was kind of a big deal.”
“I’m not particularly hungry.” Harry said through gritted teeth. “I was planning on finishing up here and then going back to Grimmauld.”
,” he ground himself into Harry’s front, “that I excite you. So the question becomes…” He trailed his hands up Harry’s neck and tangled them in the thick curls. His mouth curled into a smile and he gently grazed Harry’s lips with his own. “Are you coming back next Friday?”
After the scones were finished, it didn’t appear that he was any more inclined to speak; instead, he began cleaning his station with a look of determination on his face, as though he was doing everything he could to get out of the cafe as soon as possible.
His set has just started. He had gone through the beginning of the song - perfectly choreographed, his dips and steps on beat and immaculate. Allowing himself to get lost in the song, he began singing along, over-exaggerating his mouth so that the crowd knew what he was saying. He scanned the crowd, watching with rapt attention as people either stared up at him in adoration or danced along with him, grinding on their partners.
And then they’d lit the Libidentia, which was commonplace to him.  It had been a routine addition to the Hufflepuff and Slytherin common room parties.  If any groups were to inundate themselves with the scent of who they lusted after, it was cuddle puddle-prone Hufflepuffs and sexually-adventurous Slytherins.
Hot lines streaked down Draco’s cheeks as he grinned.  “You tell it to go fuck itself, and that it’s ugly, and it smells like troll socks,” he said, voice trembling.
They were the ultimate “Till death do us part” of betrothals.  Gods, he could only ever dream of a proposal like that.  He’d squeal like only a grown ginger man can squeal.
“Very well.”  Draco’s hands slid out and covered Harry’s, finally warm.  Dove-grey eyes looked up in quiet anticipation.  “It’ll make quite the Quibbler article, you know.”
“Bit of a necessity. I sort of burned out two wings of the manor before I could walk.” Draco sets his hands on the desk behind him and leans back, the long line of his nude torso on display.
“Yeah.”  Screwing up his courage, he slid his hands over Draco’s.  They were ice cold, and Harry’s chest ached with an impotent urge to fix it.  “I think I’m done
“Oh, right,” Harry blurted.  “I just wanted to give you this.”  He thrust the bag out awkwardly.  Eyeing it suspiciously, Malfoy accepted it, weighing it in his hands.  Realization bloomed slowly across his face.
“Much obliged.” Robards stuffs his hands in his trouser pockets and rocks back and forth on his heels, thinking. “Mind if I ask why you’re leaving, though?”
The “Couldn’t Tell His Arse From His Head” Auror had lost the power of speech.  And what he lacked in verbosity, he made up for with volume.  And enthusiasm.
“Did you watch it when they named you Ted’s godfather? Or did Andromeda give you instructions? Maybe I should have asked her, but I think she’s mad at me for lighting his toy car on fire. And besides, I don’t want to know if you have to kill people on Teddy’s wedding day, Harry. I don’t. And I don’t want to have to put hits on people when I could be eating cake.”
“Sorry,” Harry muttered, shifting his weight on his knees on the bed behind her.  “That was me.  Sorry, ‘Mione.  I’m just really bad at this.”
, he realized with a soft smile.  Their fingers danced over his skin until he had the pattern memorized, too.  The pattern, but no music.
The cat grudgingly walked off the laptop, and a fullscreen photo showcasing a very erect, rather large penis next to a hand giving a “thumbs up” filled the screen.
Harry paused, thinking and shrugged.  He reached over and stole half of Ron’s chips.  “You’re in fine form today.  What’s in the bag?”
His hands press the pillow down around my face, his teeth scrape my neck, and I hump the mattress like a shameless teenage boy.
His breath shuddered out as Harry handed a list off to an assistant.  It would be fine.  Eventually, it would be fine.  He didn’t have to look at anyone.  He couldn’t see the Minister or Chief Warlock right in front of him, anyway.  If he leaned forward, the Unspeakable blurred out the Committee and Wizengamot members seated in the boxes on either side, too.  He could just rest his elbows on the table and let the Unspeakable fog his vision.  A dignified way to hide.
“Still capable of creative swearing.  Not ready.”  He traced slick fingers down her folds and stopped just outside her entrance to tease.
But if anyone were going to make the case to her that it was relevant, he supposed it would be Malfoy.  And if he’d convinced her to learn for
She had a dab of neon pink highlighter on her lower lip, where she’d tapped the tip while deep in thought. It was more than a little adorable. “Yeah, sure.”
Harry sat at his desk waiting.  For what, he wasn’t entirely sure.  For someone to tell him what to do?  For some kind of emergency?  For Falk to breeze in and agree that this was total shit and he definitely didn’t look that desperate in person?
Harry shakes water off stalks of basil and strips the leaves. “True. You slept alright at my flat, though. I think.”
A soft whine trickled through her nostrils as her jaw clenched in an attempt to maintain her dignity.  She would
Harry’s breath rushed out over her exposed shoulder, and he laid his lips on her skin.  “I think I might have already asked her to stick me between a cock and a soft place,” he whispered next to her ear.
Harry should have had four more nights in his bed before he could move back to his flat.  No, Draco thought, frowning,
Still silent, Harry moved to a chair to Draco’s side and settled in.  Not before Draco noticed the tent in his trousers, though.  Relief coursed through him.  Harry looked mildly terrified, but at least he found it arousing.
He plucked it from her fingers with his lips, though she’d expected him to suck on her fingers or something equally lewd.
“Thank you,” he choked out.  “I’ll take her post, I guess.  And tell the Head Auror I’m here if you see him in the halls.”
Harry ran damp palms down his shirt.  In the dream, he’d worn a jumper, but it was entirely too warm this afternoon.  Maybe Draco was right, and nothing they did could change the course of the day.
“I thought I smelled an Auror,” Malfoy drawled, looking reluctant to move as he raised his head.  Blood flowed from both nostrils, and he licked it from his lips.  Pink-tinged tears ran down the edges of his nose.
The Floo rumbled again, and he wondered why a bunker would have such an obvious entry point.  Narcissa could pop right in.  She would expect tea.
His body fell, knees slamming against a slimy stone floor as bolts of pain shot through his legs.  A cold wind skittered over his damp skin, still flushed from climax.  The gust smelled of sea spray and salt.  Between drafts, the stagnant air wafted scents of ancient stone, wet iron, and pain.
Kos, however, had found an identical cause of death in two Aurors involved in the Ministry’s somewhat-illegal raid of Durmstrang five years ago.  The ICW published the findings, making special note of the Ministry’s attempt to pass the deaths off as blunt force trauma.  They’d included a tasteful footnote reminding the world of the Ministry and Hogwarts’ public censures for their failures and actions in the war, as well.
Draco chewed slowly, fork turning rice over to mix it with gravy. He swallowed and loaded another bite. “I request a full update from the Head Auror himself. At his discretion, of course.”
His relief when she got back in bed was palpable.  Falling into his dream was seamless, except that the point of view was hard to control.  They were still in bed, but there were other people with them.  Kids?
“Yeah, okay,” Harry muttered softly, flipping his glasses on top of his head to rub his eyes.  That was going to be one hell of a sit-down.
“Harry, I registered it to Hermione,” he prattled on, “since she can’t have one in her Muggle building, and you already have your Ministry-issued residential Floo in your flat.  I figured keeping Malfoy’s name entirely off it was best.  Hope that’s okay.”
” He began gyrating his hips, not fully flush against Harry’s, but enough that Harry could feel every brush of movement.
Yet again, this would not have been possible without the hardcore encouragement from the best person,
He reached out to the handle of the sliding glass door and tugged on it, causing it to silently open into the room. The voices from the couch became audible, and it seemed as though Draco and Blaise were arguing.
“The jig is up, Potter,” he sighed dramatically, “they know all about our sordid love affair. Far be it from us to ruin their imagery of us tussling around in the sheets...”
to see my vision of Harry and Draco. I don't claim to be an artist at all! Just quick sketches of how I saw our boys throughout the fic.
“Dunno what you’re talking about.” Harry shrugged, reaching a hand up and giving the ferret a tickle under the chin. “This is my emotional support ferret.”
“POISON!” A voice bellowed from behind Harry, making him jump. “Poison, where in the name of Merlin have you wandered off to? You’ve abandoned me, you absolute cretin, and I demand compensation in the form of supper!”
“He won’t.” He patted the ferret’s head, a bit roughly. “You won’t.” He threatened, before offering Hermione a smile. “See you tonight… at seven?”
“Blaise called you that,” Harry shot his own words back at him, unable to keep the attitude from his voice.
Cheers rang out, and as Harry looked up at the person in the cage, he realized that the figure was most definitely male. He had his back to the audience and was swaying his hips in time with the music, his hands behind him and gripping the cage bars. He tossed his head and the long, cascading white-blonde hair moved with him, accentuating the movements of his hips. Bending his knees, he dipped into a squat and bounced for a moment before bringing himself back up, arching his back and twisting to face the audience.
Placing a steaming plate in front of Draco, Harry sat down in the opposite chair and picked up a fork, spearing an asparagus. He watched as Draco elegantly cut a piece of lamb and scrutinized it, before placing it in his mouth. A moan of pleasure, burst through his lips, and Harry flushed. He didn’t want to hear those noises from Draco, not at the moment.
Laughing, Draco rolled his eyes. “You’ll think it’s foolish. I think it’s foolish, and I’m the one thinking!”
“What’s that?” He asked, hopping up on a barstool and watching Draco eagerly. Draco raised an eyebrow and began to poke the bottom of the dough with a fork.
“Even after paying reparations?” Harry asked, “After everything the Ministry had you do, after your trial?”
“Okay, I’m going to give you advice that I probably should have given you before you went the first time.” She turned resolutely to face Harry, arms crossed. “Rule one - and you should know this from being an Auror - don’t you dare take drinks from someone if you didn’t watch them being poured.” Harry opened his mouth to argue but it died in his throat as Ginny raised a hand. “Ah, not done yet. Rule two - dance, Harry. Go before Malfoy goes on stage…”
“Draco called me ‘Potter’,” he panted, “Draco was a right arsehole in school. Draco wouldn’t be friends with Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny…”
Harry opened the refrigerator and shifted a few vegetables… and there, behind a large nappa cabbage, was Draco’s jar of homemade mint jelly. He held it up silently for Draco to see. “Things are coming back,” he said, hope leaking into his voice. “You’re starting to remember bits and pieces of our life. That’s progress.”
“Yeah, no problem.” Harry walked over to Draco, and blanched at the sight of Ethan. “Are… are you sure you…?” He began, eyeing the customer warily. Luckily for him, Ethan seemed so focused on Draco that he didn’t even notice that Harry Potter was standing behind the counter as well.
“She wanted to be sure she’d be ovulating at a certain time so we don’t end up with a certain zodiac sign.” Ron interrupted. “C’mon, he didn’t call to ask about our life, he wants help with his… which is weird, in and of itself.” He stared pointedly at Harry. “Usually he plays the martyr and does everything on his own.”
“I’m here,” Draco said cautiously, “and you’re here, in my flat. You’re in my bed, you had a bit too much to drink and I let you rest here.” He took a step towards Harry, and watched as his eyes grew more wild.
“No one will be able to tell who you are now.” Draco slid his wand into his sleeve, willing his shaking hands to be still. This was a mystery he needed to solve, but not today. Today was his birthday, and he was about to celebrate with his friends… and Potter, of all people. “Shall we?” Harry nodded and followed Draco out of the cafe, pausing as Draco performed the locking spells on the door. He shoved his hands deep into his hoodie pockets and followed a step behind as they made their way to the Leaky Cauldron.
“I did, yeah…” Harry’s eyes roamed the walls and bakery case, a disappointed look crossing his face. “No more scones?”
Blaise snorted. “Even after being out for a month, you still are the same demanding arsehole. Sure, I’ll get your tea. Preference?”
“Me too.” Nodding, Harry looked at the ceiling and took a few deep breaths, before meeting Draco’s eyes and grinning. “So? What do I call you? My boyfriend? My partner?”
“You were eating scones and talking to the strawberry plants, telling them how tasty they were going to be once they were big enough to make into jam,” Draco corrected, throwing Luna a withering look that went right over her head. Everyone began laughing as Luna danced into the back room. “Wands out of the kitchen!” He said with a roar as he sprinted after her, tugging the wand from her back pocket before depositing it in the receptacle outside the kitchen’s door.
“Maybe not for normal comas, but the magically induced ones aren’t that strict.” Harry shrugged. “If he’s tired, he should sleep.”
Draco was used to things happening. Bad things. Weird things. One time, someone didn’t properly hook the Cage up to the ceiling harness and both Cage and Draco had come crashing down - Draco managed to cast a silent, wandless cushioning charm without anyone noticing, and assured Carl he wouldn’t sue the club. Another time, a rabid fan of his had rushed the stage and nearly molested him - luckily, the bouncers caught her right away. She was banned from the club and, yet again, Carl was assured he wasn’t about to be sued.
The kettle whistled, and Harry hurried to remove it from the burner, but it was too late. The tell-tale noises of an angry, hungover Draco began to float down the stairs.
muscular bicep - damn, being an Auror did him all the favors, didn’t it - and pulled him into the middle of the throbbing bodies on the dance floor. He saw Potter look back at Alyce, probably hoping she’d rescue him, but Alyce had always been on Draco’s side. She simply placed a cover over Potter’s unfinished drink and gave him a thumbs up.
“Of course I’m waking up, you bloody pillock,” Draco’s voice sounded weak with disuse, “I’ve been asleep for ages, I have … things to do.” His voice faltered as he groaned and tried to sit up. Harry quickly waved his wand and shifted the bed into an inclined position.
Draco nodded and got up from the couch gracefully, avoiding Harry as he walked to the staircase and made his way upstairs. Harry listened, and as soon as Draco’s door shut, he let out a primal scream as his magic exploded outwards. He had held it in as best as he could while he was speaking to Blaise, but it only helped so much. The fire grew and licked out of the fireplace, blackening the table in front of the couch as picture frames shattered, and Harry was showered in glass fragments.
“I can wait until the machine is back up.” Ethan practically purred. “In the meantime… where were we?”
The article Rita ran through The Prophet when I quit was supposed to dethrone me - but it did exactly what I wanted it to - it helped me to become a relatively normal celebrity.
A roaring sound filled Harry’s ears, and he could feel his magic building inside of him. The plants around the room began to sway as the unseen breeze filled the room, causing Blaise and Draco to finally turn and see Harry standing in the doorway, his fists and teeth clenched.
Ethan was not so easily put off. “Okay, not today. I got you. The cafe is closed tomorrow, though. Would you want to meet up then?”
Three rounds of scones and one left to go, he turned up the muggle radio and began to get into the music. It was easy when he was alone to let go; a talent he learned after he disassociated himself from his parents and their pureblood ideologies. “Children were to be seen and not heard.” Well, Draco liked being heard, and he made sure to sing loudly in his own subtle defiance of his upbringing.
“You’ll what?” Blaise challenged, standing in one swift movement. “You’ll lie to him, keep more things from him? When were you going to tell him?”
That fateful Friday night, he dressed in the outfit Ginny had helped him pick out (nothing too fancy; simply a tight black v-neck shirt that showed off his muscles and a pair of tight dragonhide pants) and apparated a few streets down from the club. He could feel the music before he even saw his destination; the steady thrumming of bass seemed to pound through his feet as he curiously walked towards the source of the noise. He saw other people walking the same way he was; they nodded and smiled and he did the same back. It felt as though he knew them, even though there was practically no way he did - they were Muggles, after all.
Harry looked through the glass doors into the room Holly led him to, and was momentarily stunned. This room was a good three times bigger than the anti-room Harry Flooed into, and it was a veritable forest of different plants and ancient artifacts. There was a fireplace across the room, crackling merrily, and in front of it, on a couch angled away from the door, sat Draco and Blaise. It appeared as though they were talking; Harry could see their lips moving but either the glass was too thick for their voices to carry, or they were speaking quietly.
Luna had been the one to suggest the muggle cooking class, and Draco had agreed to it after laughing at the idea, thinking she was winding him up. She just stood there, looking at him placidly, before his laughter died down and he realized she was serious. “And we’re almost late, we need to go now!” She had tugged him, sputtering, into a side-along apparition that spit them out in the alley behind the college the class was held at. It was here that Draco discovered his love of baking (and Luna’s absolute ineptitude at it), and the rest was history. Luna would bring him different fruit from her garden room, and he would transform them into tarts and scones, muffins and puddings, and even jams and jellies. They did this once a week and indulged together - it was a special time, one where they got to unwind and not worry about anything else that was happening in the world around them.
After bringing Ginny over a few times, Luna began to branch off and bring others with her - Neville was the second guest, and he had clapped Draco on the back as though they were old friends and swore up and down that he had never had as good of an American muffin as Draco’s lemon poppy seed. He had left with a basket full of the muffins and a few jars of raspberry jam for his gran, and Draco felt lighter than he had in years. He may not be able to call these people friends, but they definitely weren’t enemies any longer.
Someone cleared their throat, causing Harry to jump and turn. There before him was a well-dressed House Elf, holding a tray of what appeared to be sparkling water. “Master Blaise is in the drawing room.” She squeaked, blinking slowly up at Harry. “You may follow me, if you so choose.” The elf turned and began to walk away, and Harry pushed himself away from the mantle and hurried after her.
“In a dream,” Draco finished dryly, peering down at the ostentatious sign that was now pinned to his chest. The dragon really was pretty; its pearlescent scales glowed and the multifaceted eyes seemed to light up mischievously . He sighed and gathered up another basket of scones to put into the display case. “Thanks, Luna. Truly.” He smiled at her, and she smiled back, her face displaying nothing but adoration for her friend.
Not quite knowing how he got there, he found himself in front of the fire, a pinch of floo powder between his fingers. Throwing it into the flames, he called out, “Granger Grotto!” and stuck his head through. At once, he was able to see into Ron and Hermione’s shared living area, and waited for his friends to join him.
“Back in a flash, princess.” Blaise winked at him and left the room for the second time that day. Draco turned to look at Harry, his face pale.
“Gentlemen,” Robards began gravely, “It appears that we have a rogue employee.”  Only Neville appeared to not be surprised at the news of Malfoy being a Ministry employee.
“Harry, I swear to you, I didn’t know!” Ginny pleaded earnestly the following Wednesday, the first day he was able to corner her. She was at her flat putting together her outfit for that night’s event: a rave, headlining DJ Hixxy. Harry had burst his way through the door (okay maybe not burst; they were friends, he did have a key after all) and had used all of his Auror tactics to crowd and intimidate her. She easily pushed past him and continued lacing up her neon yellow boots, glancing up at him every now and then as he breathed heavily and tried to get ahold of himself.
“Today is not the day.” Draco said firmly, leading him back into the kitchen. “It is my 24th birthday, and I can think of nothing better to do than hang out in my kitchen and drink with my arch nemesis.” He arched his eyebrow and handed Harry a new drink, inclining his own in another toast. “To new beginnings, and not killing each other.” Their glasses clinked and their eyes met. “On trinque?” Harry looked confused, and Draco chuckled. “Shall we drink?” He reiterated in English.
“I don’t…” Draco started, then snapped his eyes to Harry’s. “Weasley. The one who’s tall with red hair.”
The music began to ebb away and a loud voice startled Harry out of his thoughts. “Helloooo, freaks and geeks, are you ready for tonight’s entertainment?!” There was an ear-splitting scream as the dancing bodies stilled and turned their attention to the stage. A ladder descended from the cage and the lights went down. Harry could see the shadow of a lithe figure climbing the ladder, though the lights were so dim he wasn’t able to discern much about the person. They appeared relatively androgenous, and they were definitely skinny and had long hair down to their mid-back. Could be any gender, Harry mused, watching them as they got settled in the cage and with a nod to the MC, the ladder was removed and the lights began to rise again as a relatively slow song came over the speakers.
“I’m not trying to… look, you have amnesia, it usually makes sense to you!” Harry tried not to get worked up. It wouldn’t help either of them.
And now, here he was, on a bright Sunday afternoon, with Luna in his garden, eating scones and discussing opening a damn cafe. “Do you even know how to run a cafe, Luna?” He asked carefully, crumbling the last of his scone into the grass for the birds.
“As far as I can figure, Peanut.” With a groan he sank onto the bed, gripping his head in his hands. “That’s not right either!” he practically yelled, “Why the fuck can’t I remember your name?” He looked up at Harry, and the tears that had threatened to fall earlier were making their angry way down his face. “You’re obviously important, or I would remember someone other than you. Why is it
More confident now, he tried to take Potter deeper, relaxing as best he could until he felt Potter’s cock brush the back of his throat. Abruptly, it was too much, and was coughing as he pulled back, tears pricking his eyes.
Blaise furrowed his brow. “Friends. Right.” He looked unconvinced. “So, what, does that mean the two of you are best mates with the Gryffindors now?”
Draco was at a loss. He looked to Blaise, but the dark-skinned boy merely shrugged and directed his attention to his scrambled eggs. Goyle had an expression of mild panic on his face—he had never been good at dealing with other peoples’ emotions.
Draco was quick to cut him off. “You should do nothing. You’ll just make things worse.” He waited for Potter to meet his eyes, emphasizing each word as he spoke, “Just leave it. It’s not a big deal. Okay?”
A moment later, to Draco’s great relief and even greater confusion, he heard Potter and Weasley’s footsteps retreat in the opposite direction. He remained frozen against the bookshelf a moment longer, blood still pounding with adrenaline. Potter had seen him, Draco had no doubts about it, and more than that, he was sure that Potter had recognized him. So why, then, had Potter acted like he hadn’t? Was he that desperate to avoid talking to Draco?
“After dinner,” Potter corrected, giving Draco a pointed look that made Draco scowl. When did he start sounding so much like Pansy?
“She’s not going to care.” Pansy sounded so confident that Draco wasn’t sure he had any choice but to believe her. “She just wants you to be happy. I know it.”
Rage seethed beneath his skin, and Draco had to press his nails into his palms to keep his hands from trembling with it.
“After the war…” Potter crouched down, fiddling with one of the many golden faucets surrounding the massive sunken tub. “Things changed, I guess. It just wasn’t the same between us anymore.”
He forced air into his lungs, pressing his nails into the heel of his hand as he focused on the sound of Goyle’s breathing, the rustle of sheets as Blaise rolled over in his sleep. Gradually, his heart rate began to slow and his muscles relaxed. Once he felt like he could breathe again, he pushed back the covers, knowing he wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep any time soon.
Potter did not look at Draco once while giving his testimony. It was only after he had finished his wild story and gotten up to leave that he turned to face the person he had so ardently insisted was a victim, rather than a criminal. Potter’s eyes had never looked so vibrantly green as in that moment when he extended his hand, holding out Draco’s wand.
Every few minutes, Draco would pause on a particular ingredient, fingers tracing absently over a label or the curve of a bottle while his mind worked, trying to recall its properties, its every possible magical use, its interactions with other ingredients. Would Diricawl feathers alter the effect of the Shrake spines? Was Crup bile safe to use in topical solutions? Were caiman teeth really any different than alligator teeth, and could they be used the same way?
“Yeah.” Draco swallowed, thinking back to sixth year, to the long, dark days when a ghost was his closest confidant.  “Yeah, I guess I do.” The smile faded from Potter’s lips. With a jolt, Draco realized that perhaps they were recalling the same thing: that day in the boys’ bathroom on the sixth floor, mirrors and porcelain shattering as they duelled; the spilling first of water, then of blood.
At Draco’s suggestion, they stopped at the bookshop, where Draco became so engrossed perusing a copy of
Okay I know it's been ACTUAL ages since I've updated and I am deeply sorry for that, I was dealing with some health things and then the pandemic happened and long story short I've had to prioritize some other things in my life for a while. But this story lives in my head all the time, it is planned out and I have no intention of leaving it unfinished!
Draco felt an unpleasant tug in his stomach at that. He tried to ignore it, clinging onto the happiness of their success, but it persisted even after they left Slughorn’s office, promising to meet with him again in a week once he’d had time to review their potion more closely. Draco was quiet as they headed back to their common room, unable to stop his thoughts from spiralling, stuck on Slughorn’s comment.
Drunk or not, he was glad for Potter’s company. It felt right to have him there, almost like Potter himself was an integral part of the process. And maybe he was, because when Draco added the Murtlap tentacles — one large spoonful, finely minced, added over a low heat with three clockwise stirs — the potion frothed and rapidly changed colour, unlike any reaction they’d produced before.
“I’ve never gotten far enough to test it on myself before,” he lied, thinking fast. Perhaps he couldn’t test the potion in his usual way, but the Mark on his arm wasn’t the only scar he had. There was only one problem. “I guess I’ll have to now. The only thing is…” He glanced at the shallow bowl they had used to soak the piece of synthetic skin. “We’re going to need a much bigger basin.”
Draco bit his lip, holding in the words ready on his tongue. Wasn’t he trying to avoid any unnecessary interaction with Potter? His usual logic said he should stay silent, but lately that logic seemed to be holding less and less sway over his decisions.
Draco made a noise in his throat somewhere between a laugh and scoff. “Ah, right, when you killed it, of course." He shook his head in disbelief. How Potter could describe such wild things with such intense modesty was beyond him. Up until now, he had never really believed the stories about Potter saving the school from the monster in the Chamber of Secrets at the end of their second year. Back then it had seemed insane. A 12-year-old slaying a near-mythical monster—who would have believed that? But now, given all of Potter’s feats, him besting a Basilisk didn’t seem so implausible.
Pansy’s gaze was fixed on something in the newspaper that he couldn’t see, her lips pressed tightly together in a way Draco knew could mean nothing good.
Potions theory is fascinating to me and I spent wayyy too much time researching potion ingredients for this chapter…
Desperate for something to latch onto, he thought of Halloween night. Potter showing up, face reddened with alcohol. Adding the Murtlap tentacles to the potion and watching it change colour. The scars on his chest fading, disappearing beneath wisps of grey smoke. Laughing with his arms around Potter.
Unless it wasn’t a game. Maybe Potter was just trying to move forward, and Draco was the one clinging to the past. Maybe it was okay for things with Potter to change; everything else in his life had, so why not this? He could be friends with Potter, if that’s what the other wanted, or at the very least he could try and be less of an ass. He’d done much more difficult things than that in his life, so why did it seem like such a challenge? What was he so afraid of?
It was something Draco had been thinking about since the day the war had ended; he had thought about it while sitting alone those long weeks in Azkaban, and at his trial, and while at home under house arrest, until he saw scars everywhere he looked. He thought especially of monsters like Greyback, who had torn into his victims while Draco stood by and did nothing, whose stench - putrid and metallic, like death and blood - had lingered in Draco’s home long after the man himself was gone. He thought of those survivors like Lavender Brown, who were disfigured for life. And the more Draco had thought about it, the more he had felt that Greyback was not the only one to blame for those scars—it was also the fault of every coward who had enabled him, or who had been too afraid or too weak to step up and stop him when they had the chance. It was the fault of people like Draco.
Draco was halfway to the Gryffindor table, muttering furiously under his breath as he went, when out of the corner of his eye he saw an unusual burst of shimmering blue light. There was a shout, followed quickly by an agonizing, blinding pain in his left side, and as Draco fell to the floor, all he could think was that it better not be Potter who came and saved him, because he really couldn’t afford any more personal debts.
— was ever present in Draco’s mind, the very thought of it enough to make his heart race. Draco had yet to respond in kind, and it didn’t seem like Potter expected him to, which Draco was grateful for. Most of the time, he wasn’t sure what he felt, or if he was even allowed to feel those things. Did he like Potter? It was a strange thought. Not as shocking as it once would’ve been, but not entirely comfortable either.
He lined the vials up on the table and lit a low fire under the cauldron. Potter was quiet for a moment, and then asked, “What should I do, then?”
The wall-to-wall shelves were crowded with bottles and jars of varying sizes, shapes, and colours, everything sorted alphabetically by ingredient name. Larger bundles of flowers, branches, and herbs hung from the ceiling, identifiable by the small, parchment-coloured labels that floated in the air just beneath them. Massive barrels filled with everything from glittering beetle eyes to slimy mounds of frog hearts covered most of the floor space, which was stained with a number of dark, unidentifiable splotches where it was visible.
“My Transfiguration notes are missing,” she said, looking agitated as she began to empty out her bag, still apparently unable to find what she was looking for. Although the statement seemed to have been directed at Potter and Weasley, neither of them replied. “I don’t know what could have happened to them. Harry, can I borrow yours?”
“It’s not,” Potter said. His brows were slightly furrowed as he looked at Pansy, like he too sensed this wasn’t just a simple discussion of their preferred subjects. “I didn’t use to like it much at all. But…” He glanced at Draco. “Recently I’ve started to realize it’s not so bad.”
“What is it, Pans?” he repeated, dread beginning to coil in his stomach. They had caught Blaise and Goyle’s attention now, but as Goyle leaned over to see what Pansy was reading, she quickly tried to shove the paper out of sight.
“Of course not,” Potter agreed. His eyes flickered over to meet Draco’s, and something in that look and the lowness of his voice made Draco shiver.
Draco was not in the habit of angering professors, or of losing his House points. If nothing else, he had always been a good student, never the kind to cause such a disruption in class. If he were still fourteen years old, if he were still proud and studious and desperately seeking approval, if he were standing in front of a different person, someone with tidier hair or duller eyes or less history tangled between them, Draco might have been able to do it. He might have been able to grit out an apology and seethe in silence at the back of the room for the remainder of the lesson, his fury quietly contained.
Draco nodded, the contents clinking as he shifted the bag’s weight against his hip. “You got the password?”
Potter’s brow furrowed. “Really? Didn’t your family use to send you packages of sweets all the time when you were at school?”
“That’s the rumour, anyway.” She was watching him very closely in that way she had that made Draco nervous, as if his thoughts were spelled out across his face for her to read. He pushed himself roughly up into a sitting position, turning his back to her.
“That’s always what I want to hear.” Draco grabbed his notebook, his quill flying across the page as he eagerly recorded to results of their experiment. “This is good, really good. Now that we know it works safely on regular scar tissue, we can start the real tests.”
“You’re no fun, you know that?” Pansy grabbed his arm, ignoring his protests as she began to pull him towards the fireplace. Draco always forgot how strong she was until moments like these, when she was dragging him somewhere against his will. “How do you ever expect to make new friends if you don’t loosen up a little?”
, and although he had been the one to ask, he wasn’t so sure anymore that he wanted to hear the answer.
, you two should know better.” Professor Hayward’s voice was as stern as Draco had ever heard it. “You are both adults. I will not tolerate this kind of childish behaviour in my classroom.”
“I was more than happy to drop the subject myself, to be honest. I’ve never understood why Draco likes it so much,” Pansy said, pulling her Charms homework out of her bag. To anyone who didn’t know her, she was the picture of nonchalance. But Draco knew better. Wherever Pansy was going with this line of conversation, it was calculated. “I’m surprised that you seem so interested in it though. I wasn’t under the impression that it was exactly your favourite subject.”
“In any case, Ms. McKinnon attempted a spell well above her years,” McGonagall continued. “It was not as strong of a curse as it could have been, fortunately, but the results were also much less predictable. We believe she was attempting a kind of petrifying curse, meant to stop you from moving. However…” She looked over at Madam Pomfrey, lips pursed.
“I want to be here,” Potter had replied, folding his arms on the table where Draco was working and resting his chin on his forearms.
in some way. But it was hard to lie when Potter was looking at him like that, so genuinely curious, like he really wanted to know the answer.
He pressed his face into Potter’s neck when he came, muffling his moan against Potter’s skin. His body felt heavy, a contented kind of exhaustion. They didn’t have the time for it, but he allowed himself a moment to rest there, just until his pulse had calmed, before drawing away.
Draco could still sense that green gaze all around him, watching his every move. The dormitory seemed designed to mock him. The tapestries draping the walls, the bed hangings, the pillows, even the carpets — it was all green. In the seven years he had been at Hogwarts, it had never bothered him. In fact, he had always quite liked the colour. His bedroom at the family manor in Wiltshire was a riot of green. But now, lying in his bed remembering that cold morning in the Ministry courtroom, the colour felt like an oppressive weight under which he could hardly breathe. Another moment of it and Draco thought he might go insane.
Distractedly, Draco began stripping off his school robes, grabbing his towel with the idea that maybe a long, hot shower would help him clear his head. Pansy’s comments had only served to stir his confusion. What had she been insinuating, anyway, telling him those things about Potter? Why would she think Draco would be interested? Pansy loved gossip, she always had, and over the years Draco had often joined her in sharing malicious accusations and unconfirmed rumours, especially about Potter. Yet this time seemed different, somehow. Why had she brought it up like that, so seemingly out of the blue?
“Is that Potions homework you’re working on, Potter?” Everyone seemed to tense when Pansy spoke. Draco gripped the arms of his chair, bracing himself for wherever this was going. The question sounded innocent enough, but knowing Pansy, Draco doubted it was just idle curiosity.
Draco’s stomach dropped. Slughorn must have overheard them in the corridor before class. Draco fell back, grimacing in reply to Blaise’s curious expression as the other boy brushed past him out the door. A few feet away, Potter was waving a dismissive hand at his own friends, who seemed inclined to linger.
“I like you, Malfoy.” Draco blinked, caught off guard by the honest admission. “I know that’s probably pretty obvious already, but I wanted to tell you, just in case. I like you, and…” He pushed a wet lock of hair off of Draco’s forehead, the touch easy, delicate. “I hope we can go on another date, sometime.”
Within minutes, the ground was speckled with raindrops. Without speaking, they both quickened their pace, trying to outrun the inescapable. They made it almost to the edge of the village before the sky opened up on them, pouring down in a heavy sheet, unable to be contained any longer.
“We can go to the apothecary,” Potter explained hurriedly. His ears were red. “To look at ingredients, or something. I just… I figured it might help us come up with ideas.”
At this point, Slughorn launched into a longwinded recounting of all the prominent potioneers he had taught in his time, focused heavily on his own hand in all of their successes. Surreptitiously, Draco stole a glance in Potter’s direction. Potter had schooled his features into an expression that to the untrained observer might be interpreted as polite attention. But Draco knew better; the slight glaze over Potter’s eyes betrayed the fact that he had as little interest in Slughorn’s self-congratulatory anecdotes as Draco did.
Curious, Draco took hold of Potter’s hand and pushed it back down towards his belt, pressing Potter’s fingers against the buckle once more. But even with the encouragement, Potter’s fingers remained still, making no move to undress him.
When Granger dropped the teetering tower of books she was carrying one day in the library and Draco helped her pick them up. When Weasley held open a door for Pansy, looking surprised even at himself. When they all sat around the fire in the common room once again, not talking this time but not shying away from the proximity either.
After a cursory glance to make sure Professor Hayward’s attention was elsewhere, Draco ducked down to grab the piece of parchment still nudging itself against his shoe. He unfolded it in his lap, careful not to be too obvious about what he was doing. It was only one sentence, the messy writing familiar.
“Mr. Malfoy,” she began, clasping her hands behind her back as she came to stand at the end of his bed, “It is good to see you looking alert. How are you feeling?”
He broke away from the kiss, breathing heavily as he raised his hand to press against Potter’s chest, intent on forestelling him from coming any nearer. Potter’s eyes blinked open slowly, somewhat dazed. His expression morphed into one of confusion as he glanced down at Draco’s hand against him, holding him back. Draco followed his glance, heat curling low in his stomach at the look and feel of Potter’s wet, flushed skin under his touch, quickly followed by an icy stab of horror as he realized that, in his distraction, he’d lifted his left hand, blatantly baring the dark brand on the inside of his forearm.
The change in Draco’s demeanour must have been more noticeable than he thought, because as they reached the third floor, Potter asked, voice hesitant, “Is something wrong?”
Draco made a noise of disgust. The beloved Saviour was red in the face and ducking his head, but Draco knew he was lapping it up. Potter thrived on being the centre of attention.
“I was just going to say, maybe we could walk around a bit, or something?  Since we’re already here.”
“So what is this?” Potter asked, dark hair falling across his forehead as he leaned over the cauldron to examine the potion he was stirring.
“So… is that why you didn’t want to come back here?” Draco cleared his throat, unsure if he should even ask, if he was crossing some sort of unspoken boundary. They had always moved carefully around the topics with the sharpest edges, the ones that would cut too deep too fast. “Because of…?” He left the question unfinished, the implication clear.
All three Gryffindors looked around in surprise, almost as if they had forgotten he and Pansy were there. Weasley was staring at him with his mouth slightly agape, which Draco thought was a bit dramatic. It wasn’t as if he’d offered her his kidney or anything.
that Potter finally had to drag him out of the store, teasing him all the while. They wandered briefly through Dervish and Banges, Draco trying his best to ignore the sidelong glances of the curious shop assistant, then lingered over the newest Firebolt model at the Quidditch supply shop, discussing the design improvements in reverent tones.
“Fine, fine, I won’t,” she promised, waving off his threatening stare. “If you don’t hurry up, though, we’re going to miss dinner.”
“Whatever you’re thinking, it wasn’t like that!” Potter insisted, cheeks red. “He didn’t invite me to go
Draco threw his head back and laughed, feeling light in a way he hadn’t in a long time. When he looked back at Potter, still smiling, he found the other boy looking at him as if he were seeing him for the first time, a kind of wonderment in his eyes.
“I was carrying it while I waited to be called in. I think they knew it wasn’t mine. They almost stopped me.”
They lapsed back into awkward silence, all seemingly unsure what to do now, except for Pansy, who continued with her Charms homework like everything was perfectly normal. After a few minutes, the rest of them followed suit, Draco pulling out his Defence Against the Dark Arts essay while the three Gryffindors resumed what they’d been working on before Draco and Pansy had interrupted.
Potter’s brow furrowed slightly. “You know, I never really thought about it before,” he said thoughtfully, glancing between the cauldron and the vials. “I’ve had so many injuries that were healed with magic that never left any scar. And then, others…”
“Oh, um,” Granger said. She clearly hadn’t even thought to ask him, though it would have been the logical thing to do considering they were all in the same Transfiguration class. He supposed he couldn’t really blame her for that, though. They weren’t exactly used to doing favours for each other. “That would be great. Thank you.”
It wasn’t the same as the shift that had happened between Draco and Potter in private, one that still made Draco dizzy at times. It was subtler, not quite a reversal of years of enmity. But it was enough that other people started to take notice.
Some students headed towards their dorms while others broke off into groups, chatting and taking up places in the chairs around the room. Even Blaise and Pansy had quickly gone to claim seats by the fire with another Slytherin, Millicent Bulstrode, and were now beckoning him over. Goyle, loyal bloke that he was, had stuck by Draco’s side without question, though he was beginning to edge towards the others, his eyes flickering uncertainly between them and Draco. No one else, it seemed, had any reservations about this new setup. No one except Draco.
He waited until he felt Potter’s body relax before pulling back, letting the Gryffindor’s hand fall limply away from his face. He swallowed once, then a few more times, his throat thick with the way Potter tasted, unfamiliar but not entirely unpleasant. He wiped the back of his hand against his mouth as he stood; his knees were sore, he realized, almost as much as his jaw.
“I’m very pleased that most have you have made such substantial progress,” Slughorn announced, circling back to the front of the room. “If brewed properly, your potions should age well over the next few days and be ready by our next meeting. If not…”
Draco tried not feel bothered by any of the other eighth years who cast them curious or confused glances when they saw him and Pansy sitting near the Gryffindors in the common room. Tried to tell himself that he had handled much worse staring, that if Potter wasn’t worried about what other people thought, then he didn’t need to be either. Potter could make his own choices about whether he wanted to be seen with Draco. And Draco couldn’t live his whole life cowering under the scrutiny of others. At least, that’s what he told himself.
Capitalizing on Potter’s momentary inattention and Slughorn’s wistful reminiscing, Draco took a moment to appraise the boy beside him. His dark hair was the same disaster as always, his eyes the same bright green. But Draco had never quite appreciated how clear and smooth his skin was, or how striking his cheekbones looked from this angle, as they were so often hidden by the round frames of his glass. And were his glasses new? They looked similar to the ones he had always worn, but seemed to fit his face better, somehow.
“Sod off, Finnigan.” Blaise and Goyle had both stepped forward, ready to defend him if necessary, but Draco waved them back; he refused to rise to such petty baiting.
When they weren’t alone, and reality encroached around them, the truth of it shrank. Under the judgmental eyes of his peers, all the reasons why he couldn’t like Potter and shouldn’t like Potter came crashing back.
“You could leave,” Draco muttered, tapping the first vial with his wand to uncork it. The response came like a reflex to him, and he didn’t think much of it until he saw Potter lean back from the table and reach for his bag as if he really was about to go. At once, Draco wished he could take it back. Despite how on-edge the Gryffindor made him feel and how hard Draco had fought against him being there, Draco didn’t really want him to leave. It had simply never occurred to him that if he pushed too hard, Potter might actually give up.
Dear Salazar, did Draco really have to spell it out for him? “I need your name, Potter,” Draco snapped, unable to smother his irritation at the Gryffindor’s obtuseness, though he knew anger would not serve him well just then.
“Yes, right, of course,” Slughorn conceded, his voice turning sympathetic. “Of course, you of all people deserve a break.” Potter kicked at the ground with the toe of his trainer.
Draco nodded, sensing where this was headed. The anxiety twisting in his stomach eased, replaced by a cautious feeling of hope.
Yes, it had been too late, for so many things. But that had nothing to do with Potter. Draco’s expression hardened. “I don’t need a saviour,” he spat. “I didn’t need one then, either.”
– and he couldn’t help the way his eyes mapped the lines of Potter’s shoulders and chest, the muscles toned by Quidditch, the narrow lines of his waist, the way he looked healthy and strong and achingly
“Is it the nightmares again?” she asked, wild brown hair briefly invading Draco’s line of sight as she moved closer to the other two, arms laden with books. Draco wasn’t sure Potter would answer her, but after a moment, he responded with a small, terse nod.
“What the bloody hell do you know about babies, Potter?” Draco’s scoff was only slightly muffled as he pulled his jumper over his head. “Got a little Chosen One running around out there?”
had just broadcast to the world that the Chosen One was spending his time with a known Death Eater and Draco had half expected Potter to say he wanted to put as much distance as possible between them from now on, or at the very least to mock him for his humiliating mistake. Draco could not even begin to comprehend why Potter had continued to visit him in the Hospital Wing; his only possible explanation was that maybe Potter wanted to tell him off to his face and was just waiting for the right moment to do it.
“Parkinson?” Potter finished for him, his expression souring. Draco made no reply, wondering at the harshness in Potter’s tone. “I won’t keep your girlfriend waiting. I’ll see you tomorrow night.”
He could hear Potter’s bare feet behind him, shifting around. “You’re right, I don’t want to.” There was more shifting. Draco cast a tentative eye over his shoulder, just quick enough to see Potter with his wand in his hand, pointed at a what looked like an oval-shaped scar right over his heart. “
Draco spoke quietly, hoping maybe Granger and Weasley would be too wrapped up in their disgustingly couple-y giggling to hear. But Potter heard; those green eyes fixed on him, unsettling as ever.
He pulled back slightly from the embrace, arms still wrapped around Potter. “It worked,” he said, breathless with the reality of it.
They lapsed into silence as they perused. In an unspoken agreement, Draco started on one side of the shop – ingredients beginning with letters A through L lining the shelves – while Potter took the other.
Draco was too much of a coward to tell Potter the full truth: that it felt like a sick kind of hypocrisy to punish a student for hurting him when he had never been punished for hurting so many of them.
Halfway to the Great Hall, Draco stopped, slumping to the floor with his back against the wall. He knew what he had to do now, although the thought made him nauseous. What other choice did he have?
Now assured that the altered potion formula was still safe and effective on the synthetic scars, they could move on to the more important test. Draco stood and began to unbutton his shirt, exposing the pale lines of scar that slanted across his chest. When he reached the last button, he left the shirt hanging open on his shoulders, not wanting to expose the mark on his forearm with Potter watching. They had done these tests enough times that he knew without looking that Potter was watching him, gaze warm and heavy over Draco’s bare skin. Many times, Draco had let himself be pulled in by that gaze and by the hands that usually came with it. But this time, Draco didn’t let it distract him.
Draco looked up in surprise. The question was a little bit rushed, the words tripping all over themselves, and Draco was intrigued to find that the Gryffindor suddenly looked quite nervous.
Potter was very close now, only an arm’s length away, so as a last resort, Draco sat back on the ledge, pressing himself as far away from Potter as he feasibly could. Potter remained undeterred, his gaze fixed steadily now somewhere below Draco’s neck. Belatedly, Draco realized that, by sitting on the ledge, the top part of his chest was no longer submerged beneath the potion-tinted water. His skin prickled, itching at the sensation of being exposed and yet knowing it was too late to hide.
“Gods, Pansy, your voice could wake the dead.” Draco squinted against the brightness of the room as he looked at the dark-haired Slytherin girl, who gave a very visible start upon hearing him speak. “I’m not dead, am I?”
He silenced that voice quickly. It wasn’t a date, he had absolutely no reason to believe it was, and he certainly had no reason to worry about what Potter thought of his response to a silly question.
He discarded the memory of the prefects’ bathroom with ease and began to sift through the images arrayed before him, skimming over their edges like the pages of book. Potter had left his thoughts entirely unguarded in his attempt to confront Draco, and it was all too simple to press deeper, past the memories that Potter had inexpertly thrust to the forefront of his mind.
“No worries, my dear boy, no worries at all! Well, then, I won’t keep you any longer, you both should get to lunch before your next classes begin.”
Thank you to everyone who is reading, and thank you for the kudos/comments! This is the first fic I've ever posted on AO3 so it's really cool to know that people like it!
“Sadly, I don’t think you’re her type.” It wasn’t his best retort, and he didn’t quite achieve the cool and mocking tone he was going for, but he least managed to keep from sounding breathless.
He could see that Potter wanted to say more, saw the way his lips parted to argue, but something seemed to make him pause. It took Draco a minute to realize that Potter’s eyes were fixed on his fingers, poised to undo the buttons of his shirt. Draco had undressed without hesitation until then, distracted by their conversation. But now, the nerves from earlier returned tenfold, prickling along his skin and focusing at his throat, where Potter’s eyes were glued and where his own fingers were now fumbling, as if they had suddenly forgotten how buttons worked.
He narrowed his eyes at the Gryffindor, wincing only a little as he pressed his hand against his aching ribs. “Why are you here, Potter?”
Knowing that his face must be as red as a tomato, he was thankful that Malfoy was facing away from him. Taking a deep, steadying breath, he began to move with Malfoy. One step to the left, one step to the right, dipping his hips back and forth as he moved. His hands gripped Malfoy’s hips momentarily, and Malfoy leaned back into him, allowing Harry to rest his head on his shoulder. Malfoy’s hair smelled good and was so soft. He pressed his nose into the hair just behind Malfoy’s ear and inhaled deeply. Some sort of fruit? Whatever it was, it was divine.
“Nah, it probably was,” Ron said cheerfully, “But that’s our Harry. Doesn’t say a damn thing he doesn’t mean. Bet he can’t wait to wake up to your pointy face every morning!”
“As his overprotective watch dog you mean!” Blaise scoffed. “Our dear Draco used to be quite the adventurous one, back when he was trying to please daddy but still be himself on the side.”
Ron and Hermione had their arms around each other’s shoulders and were looking at the photographer with wide smiles. Harry had his arm draped over Draco’s shoulder, and was laughing as Draco said something into his ear.
“Harry, you were worse than me.” Gently, Draco reached out and set a tentative hand on Harry’s knee. “Voldemort may have been in my home, but he was in your head.”
Draco sniffled and finally raised his eyes to meet Harry’s. “Are you mad at me?” He asked, rubbing a hand across his eyes.
“I don’t know.” The words were mumbled, but were easy to hear in the noiseless kitchen. “I don’t know why I’m still here, honestly. I should…” He looked helplessly towards the front door. “I should just go. I don’t know why I thought this was a good idea.” Throwing back his drink and swallowing several times, he slammed the empty glass onto the counter and jumped at the crash. He began walking towards the door, but was stopped as Draco’s hand shot out and caught his elbow.
The smile that Harry gave him was so brilliant that he wanted to make it into a Pensieve memory. “I trust you, Draco.” He motioned to the stairs. “Do you want to go and watch the telly? Or possibly discuss how we’re going to tell everyone tomorrow?”
“I knew that’s why you came back!” She giggled, pushing on his shoulder gently. “You couldn’t take your eyes off of him last time… not that I blame you. He’s good at what he does.” Harry blushed, hoping that the darkness of the club covered his flaming cheeks. “He doesn’t drink, really. But he always comes over to me after his set is over. Why don’t you wait over here afterwards and ask him yourself?” She winked and bustled away to serve another customer, leaving Harry to make his way to the stage. He noticed the cage wasn’t up; maybe Malfoy wasn’t performing tonight. Maybe he’d get lucky and be able to enjoy himself without oogling Malfoy.
Deep breaths, Harry told himself. He doesn’t remember, he has amnesia… To Draco, he said, “We haven’t gotten around to all the rooms yet. We mainly focused on our bedrooms, the kitchen, and the sitting room, since that’s where we spend most of our time.
“Did you know that there’s a coffee that’s brewed from coffee cherries that have been eaten, digested, fermented, and then defecated by the Asian palm civet?” The two men jumped as Luna’s voice drifted into the kitchen. “It’s called Kopi luwak, and it is terribly expensive. I wonder if we could create a habitat for civets here?”
In my defense, I had just sharpened my new machete and I was being rather reckless - trying new things.
“Paperwork is filled out. Don’t you have to take it to your boss?” He held out the papers, and Harry tapped them with his wand, causing them to disappear.
“Harry… you know Malfoy is an Animagus. A ferret Animagus.” She stared pointedly at the animal, who had draped itself over Harry’s shoulder. “And you also know that he’s a wanted man; the Ministry has been looking for him for days now! How can you be sure that
“We don’t want to lead people on, Harry. Falling in love with one person when they’re actually another… that’s not good, for either of you. If you want Malfoy, then be yourself.” She pulled him into a hug and broke away, wiping under her eyes carefully. “I can’t cry now, it took me ages to get this on. Get out of my house, Harry Potter, I have a rave to finish getting ready for.” She turned back to the mirror and Harry realized that he was being dismissed.
He lost track of time as he stared into the fire, thinking about the could-have-beens. He didn’t remember falling asleep, and he didn’t remember Draco stealing down to cover him with a blanket as he slept.
“Okay, Draco, let’s talk about what happened.” Harry flipped through the pages of the chart. “You work as a Curse Breaker for the Ministry of Magic. You were hit by a curse while on a job. You’ve been in a magically induced coma of your own doing for weeks. Your body is fine; you had a few lacerations and bruises that I healed when you first arrived, but it appears that you may have some form of amnesia. Is this making sense to you?” Draco slowly turned his head towards Harry, his face transforming into a sneer.
Draco’s nerves were alive with focused energy. While this whole situation started as a joke, he couldn’t hide his feelings anymore. He
“I found it behind all the big ones,” Harry hurried to fill the silence that had fallen, “And… and it says it’s treacle syrup, so…”
After one too many ruined raids, he stormed into Draco’s office and demanded his assistance. There was a cursed mansion that belonged to one of the old Death Eater families, and Ron wanted him at the forefront to see him in action.
Harry was silent for a moment, and Draco waited, not wanting to hurry him. “I think that there’s a lot on the surface that will work,” he said finally, “but I also think there’s going to be some things we need to work through. Some alone, definitely some together. I hardly recognize you now; you’re so different from the prat I knew at Hogwarts. But…” he trailed off, then nudged Draco to turn around and face him. “I’m willing to work for this if you are.”
Once they had navigated to the center of the dance floor, Draco forced his thigh in between Potter’s legs and pulled him in close; one hand gripping his back, and the other tangled in his own hair. Draco was extremely confident in his body, and that translated to the dance floor, no matter if he was doing a solo set on stage or dancing with a partner. Potter was stiff, but with a few pushes and prods, he began to move. “Feel the music,” Draco instructed, his hand tightening on Potter’s back.
Harry wanted nothing more than to pull Draco into a tight hug, stroke his hair, and not let go until the tears stopped. He knew better, though. Draco was volatile at best, and when he didn’t remember their relationship or even what Harry’s name was, any form of unwanted touching would be playing with fire. “We’re important to each other,” he finally settled on, “We’re best mates. We live together. We tell each other everything. It’ll come back to you.” Harry promised, and he knew he wouldn’t stop until he had fixed Draco’s amnesia. “Everything will come back to you. I promise.”
Following Harry, Draco looked around the pristine kitchen. “I don’t know why you even asked me to check,” he said, shaking his head. “You did an amazing job.”
“The things that Blaise was saying…” Draco coughed and flushed, looking away. “About me, and how I used to be… and about the things I used to do...”
“I can assure you that I am the real, flesh and bone Draco Malfoy.” Draco picked up Harry’s glasses from the night stand and held them out, still keeping his distance and trying to appear non-threatening. Harry snatched the glasses from his hand and shoved them on his face, eyes now focused directly on Draco.
“I will neither confirm nor deny those allegations, as it is absolutely none of your business.” Draco bristled, hoping Harry hadn’t overheard. “Now, one last time. Do you want a coffee, or not?”
The kiss they shared - scant as it may have been - set all of Draco’s nerves alight. He wanted Potter, possibly more than he had ever wanted anyone else.
“Well… yeah, we knew that, mate,” Ron said, “But the question remains… why at The Ecstatic Croissant instead of Draco’s?” He lowered his voice conspiratorially. “The bacon here is too thin, and the eggs are always a bit overcooked. You must have noticed that the food isn’t fresh?”
“Have a nightmare that morphed into a panic attack when you woke up in a strange place after drinking yourself into a stupor?” Draco offered, and Harry barked out a laugh.
His train of thought was interrupted as Harry reached over and touched his hand tentatively. “You alright?” He asked. “You seem to be in your head. You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to… if you have somewhere else to be.”
Understanding the dismissal, Harry stomped down the stairs and bustled into the kitchen, slamming the kettle onto the stove. He knew he needed to keep his temper in check; Draco had amnesia, for Merlin’s sake! If he couldn’t get through this, maybe they shouldn’t be dating. Frustration coursed through him; partially at Draco, partially at himself. He knew that Draco was an absolute git, full of sass, but beneath it all, he was a relatively decent bloke with a good sense of humor.
“And the wrackspurts are gone, don’t forget about that!” Luna exclaimed and the tension was broken. Everyone laughed, and returned to their croissants, the conversation bouncing between the Hogwarts Greenhouses, Quidditch, the cafe… and throughout it all, Draco continued to hold Harry’s hand.
“How often do you make treacle tart?” The oven beeped, and Draco quickly put an oven mitt on, grabbed the crust and dumped the beans back into their tin, and replaced the crust, this time setting the timer for ten minutes.
“Draco wait! At least let me explain…” Harry turned, reaching a hand out as though to grab Draco, but he was already in front of the fireplace.
That’s how they found themselves sitting at a corner table at the new breakfast spot in Hogsmeade, aptly named The Ecstatic Croissant. Draco ordered two freshly squeezed orange juices, wondering idly if a full breakfast was something the Lovegood Cafe should consider getting into.
Draco nodded, smiling slightly into his cup, and Harry was sure he had made a mistake in telling him. To his surprise, Draco was one of the most supportive people when it came to Harry’s choices, choosing to flirt with him just as much (if not more) than he flirted with Ron.
“For someone who likes it so much, I’m surprised you didn’t recognize the ingredients for treacle tart.” Draco felt a rush of pride as Harry’s eyes grew wide. “Reach behind you and grab me the beans, would you?”
“Actually, we did have some news on that.” Hermione flourished her wand and a piece of parchment came soaring into her outstretched hand. “This just arrived from Ron a few minutes before you popped in.” She held it up for Harry to read, and he skimmed it, noting that Ron had seemingly found the cursed object that went off when Draco opened the room at Crabbe's residence, and that it was contained and safe at the Ministry.
“They’re dry baking beans, to keep the crust from puffing up too much.” Draco laughed as he poured the dried beans in an even layer over the bottom of the dish. He slipped the dish into the oven and set a fifteen minute timer before grabbing his food processor and crumbling the toasted bread into it. “Homemade breadcrumbs are far superior,” he explained, raising his voice over the sound of pulverizing bread. “You can control how much or how little moisture is in the crumbs, so you can ensure the finished tart is as thick as you want it to be.” Abandoning the crumbs in the processor, he grabbed a sauce pan and threw it to the stove, lighting the cooktop with a long match.
He loved listening to their lives: Ginny’s Quidditch training with her team, Neville’s work with the Aurors and as a fill-in Herbology professor at Hogwarts, Ron’s Auror training and Hermione’s slow ascent into Magical Law Enforcement. Every now and then they’d mention someone else he knew from school - Hannah Abbott becoming a healer at St. Mungos, Ernie Macmillan securing a place as the Assistant Director for the Daily Prophet, even Pansy Parkinson’s name came up as they discussed her new line of clothing and fashion. Draco drank these stories in, happy for his old school mates for doing everything that Draco found he couldn’t.
Hermione was silent for a moment. “I don’t think that Draco visiting Blaise is the best idea,” she said. “Blaise has always come off as very…”
“If I’ve been going by Draco Black, why does my chart say Draco Lucius Malfoy?” He was getting closer to hysteria, and Harry quickly motioned Ron and Hermione to leave. With worried looks, they left Harry alone in the room, shutting the door behind them. Harry took a deep breath and summoned a vial of Draught of Peace, handing it to the panicking Draco. He downed it in one go, and his breathing slowed down. His eyes glossed over, and a small smile tugged on his lips.
Suddenly, Draco really didn’t want to be alone at the front of the store. “Do you mind coming out front, just behind the counter? I need some help with one of the machines, if you can manage.” He made eye contact with Ethan, who just smiled serenely and gestured for Draco to continue doing what he was doing. With a sigh, he focused back on the machine. The bricks of used espresso were too packed into the dispenser drawer and had started crumbling into the machine, which could result in the machine overheating or, even worse, an expensive repair by the manufacturer.
“I would like to hold you to that sentiment, Potter,” Draco responded, his eyes closed, “But right now, you are high on exhaustion, and I am still very much inebriated.” He turned over, snuggling into the pillows. “Ask me tomorrow when I’m sober.” The soft snores signaled that he had fallen asleep, and Harry padded out of the room and into his own, thinking about what he had just offered Draco.
“If you’re sure…” Harry set the book blindly to his side. “I’ll get out of your hair for now. I’m going to give Draco a bit of time to come home, and if he’s not back soon, I’ll Floo to Blaise’s.”
“You’d better not be shitting in my house!” Harry yelled after him, covering his face with his hands. What had he gotten himself into? When he saw the stark white ferret slinking along a wall in Knockturn Alley, he knew, without a doubt, that it was Malfoy. Not that he had ever seen Malfoy’s Animagus form, but it was some innate Malfoy-Radar that Harry was equipped with. He had always known when Malfoy was around at Hogwarts, and apparently, that Malfoy-Radar extended way past his school years.
“But just because of what happened this morning doesn’t mean we’re in a relationship.” Harry knew he was digging himself into a deeper hole, but he couldn’t stop himself. “It could have meant I woke up randy, it could have meant I was having a dream…”
Harry shrugged and avoided his eyes. “If we’re going out of Diagon Alley through the Leaky, I’d prefer if I didn’t look like… Harry Potter. There’s a reason no one has seen me, and it’s not just because I don’t leave my house.” Draco started at this revelation. Harry Potter, the most loved wizard in all of history, didn’t leave his house without a disguise.
“Do control your temper.” Blaise sounded bored. “Some of these artifacts are priceless. I’m merely stating that you are throwing away a perfectly reasonable opportunity…”
“It’s possible,” Hermione hedged, “It could be his magical core keeping him asleep so that he can heal any internal issues.”
“Healer Douglas kept you late, darling, or were you showing the new recruits the ropes?” He’d ask when Harry arrived home even five minutes late.
“It’s good to see you, Harry,” she began, “We were beginning to worry that you didn’t…” Harry shook his head vehemently and stepped away from her embrace.
Knowing he couldn’t put it off any longer, he squared his shoulders and strode back to the fireplace. He grabbed some Floo powder and threw it into the flames. “Zabini Manor!” He said clearly, and brought his elbows in as he was whisked away.
“Once you become a coffee connoisseur, like myself, perhaps then you’ll understand the finer nuances between the different types of coffee beans.”
“The bed.” His voice was barely more than a whisper, but Draco nodded encouragingly. “The glass of water. The window. Your weird plant.” Closing his eyes, he shook his head again. “I don’t want to.”
Hermione glanced at the permanent Tempus charm affixed to the wall. “His shift starts in 10 minutes. I’m sure he’s in the break room if you wanted to wait for him…”
The hazelnut macchiato Harry finally handed to Ethan was steaming hot, and, according to Ethan, “Just as good as the ones Draco makes!” Harry smiled, bowing his head in thanks before retreating into the back room.
“Unspeakable Malfoy disappeared shortly after a break in the love potion case.” Robards sat down and idly straightened the paperwork on his desk. “It was no coincidence; we found evidence at the scene that Malfoy was directly involved. The fact that he’s been missing in action since then makes it clear that he’s feeling guilty. I leave it up to you fine gentlemen to find him and bring him in.” Harry, Ron, and Neville looked at each other. It was rare that they were to go after a singular person, let alone a Ministry employee…
Cursing internally, Draco reached back and grabbed at Potter’s hands, bringing them to his own waist. “Here, maybe it’ll be easier if you feel
“Birthday drinks!” Luna to the rescue, as usual. She pulled a tray of purple drinks emitting clouds of fog from the fridge and handed them out. Draco took his gratefully, sniffing at the smoking liquid. It smelled of elderberry syrup and definitely had Luna’s signature all over it. “To Draco, may he have a wonderful 24th year!” Luna raised her glass, and everyone else followed suit.
Draco accepted defeat, and stopped fighting with the sheet. “Why would you do all of this for me?” He asked. “Why would you go above and beyond for me?”
Light footsteps behind Draco alerted him to Harry’s approach. “Hey,” Harry’s voice was barely above a whisper. “I’m so sorry. I really didn’t mean to cause any sort of issue between you and them…” Draco turned to face Harry, noting his reddening face. “It’s just… it’s been a long time, and with Ginny and I breaking up, I haven’t really left my house to see them, and I try not to impose on anyone…” Draco had heard enough. He held up a hand to silence Harry, waiting until the man looked up at him.
“Nonsense!” Malfoy threw back the last of his water and tugged Harry towards the dance floor. “Everyone can dance. You just have to feel the rhythm.” Harry looked helpless back at Alyce, who put a cover over his not yet finished drink before giving him a thumbs up.
In fact, it was while I was staking out the Manor that everything became crystal clear to me - about the Ministry's corruption, and about how I was still simply a pawn to them.
Draco thought for a moment. The apology did sound sincere, and other than the flirting and the mishap on Saturday, Ethan was nothing but a polite customer. He signaled to Harry to begin making a macchiato, and gave Ethan a small smile. “I accept your apology. And I appreciate you coming back here; normally, even if someone comes to the conclusion that they are in the wrong, they don’t have the bollocks to own up to it. I think that says something about a person.”
The music quieted, and everyone turned to the stage. Lights went down, and there he was, climbing the stairs in the shadows, getting situated right in the middle of the stage.
“I didn’t want to mess up your healing.” Harry gave into his feelings and hugged Draco. “I didn’t want you to focus on me and my feelings when it’s you who’s important at this moment in time. Your healing trumps any feelings I have.”
The ferret leapt off of him and onto the back of the couch, baring his little ferret teeth at Harry, before scampering off to Merlin knows where.
“Earl grey, splash of milk, three sugars.” Harry smiled at Draco’s quick order. At least he still remembered his preferred drink. That was a good sign; he hadn’t lost all of his memories after all.
“You’re...” He heard Harry gasp, “you’re…” Draco tucked his wand into the waistband of his trousers and held up his hands to show he was unarmed.
Ah, there he was. The unruly mop of hair that was so pointedly Potter was heading towards Alyce’s bar.
After several moments, he felt Potter begin to move with him. Letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding, Draco leaned more heavily into Potter and enjoyed the warmth of their combined bodies. Feeling Potter’s head on his shoulder was a surprise, but even more surprising was the feeling of Potter’s nose rubbing against his hair. Draco felt his breath catch in his throat, and hoped that Potter hadn’t noticed.
At 7am on the dot, Luna reappeared to flip the sign from ‘Closed’ to ‘Open’, and Draco’s day really got started. If he thought that the weekdays had been busy, then he was extremely shocked with how many people showed up on a Saturday. He supposed he should have known; most people were at work on the weekdays while they were open, and since this was the first official Saturday, there were a bunch of new faces to cater to.
Harry frowned, but sighed and waved his wand under the table, dispersing the Glamour. “It was uncomfortable,” he admitted to Luna, “But I just don’t want to be…”
“Don’t need to.” Draco eyed the flame before zesting one of the lemon halves into the pot and giving it a quick stir. “Things like this become second nature when you’ve made them enough.”
Blaise Zabini sat in an armchair next to Draco’s bed, a book propped open on his knees, watching Ron and Hermione’s exchange with bright eyes. He was Draco’s emergency contact, and as such he was called as soon as Draco was admitted into St. Mungo’s and had hardly left his side, visiting hours be damned. He was in a private room reserved for Ministry employees, so visiting hours were only a suggestion.
Yes, this is basically the exact same chapter as 1, only from Draco's POV and with his thoughts on the whole thing. You have to have both sides!
“Oh, alright.” Throwing her hands up, Hermione sighed. “Bring the damn thing. But if he antagonizes Crookshanks, or, I don’t know, digs up my plants…”
“How’re his stats looking?” Ron knelt in front of his hearth and looked down at Harry. “Still greens and yellows?”
“I don't need a babysitter.” Draco attempted to swing his legs over the side of the bed, but the sheet became twisted. Giving an enraged cry, he kicked and shoved at the sheets until he was completely tangled up.
“Allow me to let you in on a little secret.” Blaise lowered his voice. “He’s not going to settle down with you. This whole fling you’ve got going on? That’s all it is. A fling. He’ll come back to us when he’s bored of you, mark my words. It’s been what, a month?”
Ethan looked like he really wished the floor would swallow him up. “I just… look, I… I wanted to say I was…. Sorry.” He mumbled the last word, causing Draco to lean forward slightly.
Knowing that Ron, at the very least, would be needing a hangover potion and a fry up, Harry got up early and made his way into the kitchen, setting the kettle to boil and summoning two hangover potions from his stash.
“I promised to keep you safe,” he griped, “But you need to be less conspicuous. Can you do that?” The ferret didn’t look like it wanted to respond, but finally nodded his head once in acknowledgement. “Great. Brilliant. Now,” Harry grinned mischievously, “we’re going to have to come up with an actual name for you.”
Humming to himself, he set about organizing the scones on his baking pans and placing them into the oven before retreating back to the dining room. He took down the chairs, wiped down the tables, and set each one with a little vase containing a single sunflower, right in the center - Luna said that the sunflowers brightened the room, and Draco agreed. He also knew he could do this part with magic, but he found he enjoyed the physical labor.
I knew how the Aurors operated when they found a body. Check for Magical Signatures, check for the trace of magic in the air.
So why was Potter standing right by the stage, staring up at Draco as though he was the most interesting thing on the planet?
For the first time in as long as he could remember, brunch was not served at Draco’s flat. During their discussion the night before, both Harry and Draco agreed that telling their friends should happen in a public place; that way, if there were any negative emotions, the negative energy wouldn’t taint Draco’s flat.
Draco swore under his breath. Though he knew he couldn’t fully blame Harry, he was still behind in opening the store. “Sorry, Luna. Harry and I were—”
Quiet voices were shushing each other, and Draco could hear the faint jostling of bodies. He stepped into his brightly lit kitchen and was immediately greeted with a shout of “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!” Luna, Ron, Hermione, and Neville stood there, beaming at him, holding a large cake in the shape of a dragon. Luna must have told them that Harry was with him, because none of them looked surprised to see him. Draco smiled and took the cake from Luna, watching as the cake-dragon puffed out a smoke plume.
“I told you I had a mind healer. I was diagnosed with a bunch of things after the war; the most prevalent thing was anxiety attacks. My healer taught me the five-senses trick, and while it’s hard to do to oneself in the midst of an attack, it’s easier when you have a second person talking you through it.” He patted Harry’s knee. “I could tell you were coming back to me after you told me what you could hear, but it’s important to go all the way down to one. The taste ends up grounding you the most because you have to think a little harder.” Harry nodded slowly and got up from the bed.
Ginny had to have known, hadn’t she? He shook his head. She came here a lot, knew about goth night, knew about Fridays… was she having him on? Was she trying to make him go insane? Just because they had broken up, just because he had admitted that his school-boy nemesis may have been something less nemesis and more obsession… he groaned and downed the rest of his drink, hoping it would cloud his mind enough to stop it from racing.
Not that Draco was doing anything illegal, but the fear of being arrested was still very fresh in his mind.
“And may you come up with even more tasty treats for us to eat!” Ron narrowly avoided Hermione’s slap. “Come on, ‘Mione, you know it’s true! You can’t forget the cake he made me for my birthday.”
“Mmhm,” Harry nodded his agreement, though his mind was a thousand miles away, thinking of other ways he could potentially jog Draco’s memory. If he remembered where the mint jelly was, maybe he’d be able to remember other things. If only he could come up with a solid plan to help him remember…
“I bring him your blueberry scones on Mondays,” interjects Luna, “He thinks they’re delicious. The last time I invited him to your flat, he said he didn’t think he was welcome and then spent the rest of our visit staring into the fire. I’m sure he just saw some fire salamanders and was trying to figure out how to capture them, so I left him to it.”
“I know what you’re going to say, but once we open up a shop in Hogsmeade, there’s nothing stopping us from asking Hagrid if he wants to raise a new animal, is there?” She grabbed a bag of cups and tore it open, counting out an even number of smalls, mediums, and larges. “You haven’t done anything up front, were you aware? Or were you planning on making today a surprise ‘bring your own cup’ day?”
“It’s a perfectly natural thing, Polenta,” Draco continued, sipping his tea and staring directly at Harry. “Healthy boys have urges, after all.” His face turned predatory, and Harry took a hasty sip of his tea, burning his tongue in the process. “But now, there’s no doubt in my mind that there is something more than ‘roommates’ between us.” Draco idly stirred some sugar into his cup, tapping the spoon gently on the rim. “I may have amnesia, but I don’t appreciate you lying to me.”
The ferret paid him no mind, ripping and tearing at the magazine until he had a few pieces lined up neatly. He jumped off the coffee table and ambled over to Harry, clawing his way up his trouser leg and shirt to perch back on his shoulder. A nudge and a bite to Harry’s ear made him yelp, but the ferret stared at the line of torn paper deliberately. Harry sighed, but, getting the ferret’s meaning, he leaned over to look at the lined up paper. They were all words, lined up to form…
Taking a deep breath, Draco settled himself into baking mode as he whirled around the kitchen, grabbing his ingredients and deftly pouring them into his industrial mixer. For the more showy pastries, he would focus on the weighing of the ingredients, but for the basic batter he’d be using as a base for his flavored scones, he knew the ratios by heart. He held back before flipping the switch, going over his mental checklist three more times before nodding and turning the mixer on “low”. It only needed to mix for a bit before separating the batches and adding the mix-ins. Voices drifted into the kitchen from the dining area, and Draco pressed eight minutes into his timer and walked idly to the sink to wash flour off his hands when he heard something that made him pause.
“I don’t see why not,” he said thoughtfully, “I could do a split-Sunday, you could come in the afternoon after the others have left?”
“You seem to remember me just fine.” Was it Harry’s imagination, or was Blaise’s hand slowly making its way up Draco’s thigh? “That little shiver when I press just…”
Harry felt his face flush. “It’s not like that, Draco,” he hesitated, “Anything that we may or may not have kept from you was in your best interest.”
Hermione nodded, biting her lip. “He never says no outright,” she said slowly, making eye contact with Ron before sweeping her gaze to Draco, “but there’s always an excuse to not do something.”
“At least once a week,” Neville responded, gesturing to himself, Ron, and Hermione. “We stop by Friday nights before we go to the Leaky. He’s always invited, but like Ron said, excuses out the arse.”
“Custard, definitely.” Harry licked his lips as though he could already taste it, and Draco was surprised to find himself watching the path of his tongue. Flushing slightly, he turned back to the refrigerator and found what he was looking for.
“Thank Merlin for that.” Draco bumped his shoulder into Harry’s. “Not my type, that’s for sure.” Relishing in the red flush that creeped up Harry’s cheeks, he waited as Harry followed him out of the cafe and locked the doors behind them.
“I haven’t even seen the house since I was… five?” Draco had to think. “As long as the House Elf heads aren’t on the walls, then you’ve done a great job.”
“Asparagus, I think,” Harry said, somewhat to himself, “And I know I have the mint jelly somewhere around here…”
“So,” Draco wiped his mouth and pushed his plate away. “We’ve lived together for… two years, did you say?”
“Show off.” Draco said flatly as he tucked into the stew. The beef chunks were large and tender, with just the right amount of comforting spice to offset the richness of the broth. They ate in silence for a few minutes, the only noise coming from the spoons clinking in their respective bowls. This gave Draco ample time to think about the afternoon, and consider any and all interactions he had with Harry. He was dying to figure out why Harry was being distant with him.
Draco stopped to consider this. There was the rush of adrenaline, the fear of failing, the constant talking to people… “I’m overwhelmed,” he admitted, letting himself lean back against the counter and rubbing his face. “It was a good day, don’t get me wrong… but I’m wondering if I’ll be able to do this consistently.”
“Uhm, yeah.  One of them.”  She really hoped they’d drop the topic.  Cassandra was shell-shocked already, and Janine looked like she was going to burst.
“Fuck my ass,” she spat out, mortified.  Her cheeks felt like they could combust out of sheer embarrassment.  His fingers kept circling, and his thumb kept pressing, and all she could focus on was getting him inside her and letting her climax around him.
“I’m not certain it went unnoticed,” Harry whispered, lowering his lips to Draco’s shoulder.  He pressed a kiss and rose.  “It’s only one more week.”
Harry sat on his living room floor, cross legged, scrolling through the barrage of text messages and emails he’d gotten since noon.
Do. Not. Vomit. On the sex chair. Don’t. Cold air over exposed nerves. Slick, bloody holes against his tongue. Vodka a cauterizing burn. Not real. Not anymore. Never again.
Harry stopped for another hitching breath, and the realization hit Draco.  He hadn’t been overheard, he’d been
The chair across from her scooted out for him of its own accord.  “Show-off.”  Gripping the armrests tight, he lowered himself into the seat.  Twice, she’d whipped the chair out from under him and cackled so loudly that they’d drawn a small crowd.
He reaches out, gathers the ends in each hand and gently tugs them. The weave tightens, loose loops and furls arranging themselves into a dense band of tan fabric with a rather distinctive pattern running through it. A raised, undulating line of rounded, peaked shapes takes form; brown on tan.
She turned off notifications and scrolled back up to his picture, setting the laptop on her bedside table.  He’d actually sent her a picture.  The Chosen Cock.
The bloody dough just absorbs all the flour Harry rolls it onto until it’s stuck to the counter itself, and Harry’s hands are gummed into it. Draco steps up behind him, merely observing, but his breath tickles Harry’s ear.
“Now, don’t misunderstand.  I love these wankers, I really do.  Except you, Alexander, you bastard, don’t nick that table!  Anyway, love these idiots, but they’re not much on tips.  This week, though?  I’ve made enough to pay next month’s rent already.  I don’t give a rot what happens to the Wizengamot.  Never done nothin’ for me.”
At a loss for words, Draco slid their cuffed hands into contact and shoved the memory into Harry’s mind.
“Harry," Draco said sternly, "you will know when it’s too big by my subtle saying that it’s too big and then ending the demonstration.”  It was more sarcasm than he’d intended, and he turned to apologize.  Harry’s eyes rolled up to meet his gaze.
Draco was hedging his bets on how things would play out with Potter.  Personally, that had been the best orgasm he’d had in several years.  He had to assume the same for Potter, who'd shown unexpected proficiency in using a bond during sex.  But would they fall forward or backward off this particular ledge?
His knees slid up to straddle Harry’s, and he leaned down for a long, slow kiss.  He pulled back, grey eyes misty.  Harry released his wrists and ran fingers through Draco’s hair.
Steady, slow breathing at her back and the distant sussing of the waves were the only sounds.  But the sound of the waves could have been her own heartbeat in her ears, and that was incredibly unnerving.  Like being in an enormous seashell.
want that side of Harry Potter, Head Auror.  The broken, needy, wanting side of him that wasn’t satisfied with banal one-night stands.  The side of him that wanted to own and be owned in return.  The side of him that he’d perhaps never shown Ron or Hermione.  The side of him he was likely ashamed to admit existed.
A firm knock sounded on the bookcase, and Draco looked up to find Harry leaning in the doorway. He held the ward-tethered bracelet up. “Why did Calix, Basilia, and Ron all just cross the wards?”
She pulled him back out, sucking him dry.  “Don’t ever call me ‘Granger’ again,” she whispered against his length, sliding him back along her tongue.
The man pocketed his mobile and indulged Draco with a weak smile. “It was really fucking weird, but yeah, it was a little bit amazing.”
Fumes from the rubbing alcohol burn his nose as he scrubs the workbench. The monkey tree resin had worked, but not without leaving an awful, sticky mess. He throws the rag in the bucket and tosses it all in the utility sink. He wonders, briefly, if it will spontaneously combust overnight, and sets it all in the alley. Just in case.
“Oh, big deal, disposing of a beast,” Draco said, nose wrinkled.  “What are you even going to do with the thing before it rots?”
“I don’t know why you think I need to know outdated courtship practices, anyway,” she muttered, zipping up the bag.
Harry opened his eyes, acutely aware of the leaking erection tenting his trousers. With a furtive glance, he sprinted to a park restroom and locked himself in a stall.
“No, I saw the address on a receipt. It must be my favorite. I certainly spent a lot of money there.”
“Oh, that’s bollocks.  Why’s it got Hermione’s name on it?” Ron asked.  She didn’t give him a bracelet.  Now he wanted a bracelet, dammit.
Harry stammered, not sure what DMLE custody even entailed.  Did that mean Azkaban?  Was there a jail for petty wizard criminals he wasn’t aware of?
“For Godric’s sake,” Molly swore.  “Bill and Fleur split a single one, and I got a granddaughter out of it.”
“Sella still scared about school?” Felix asked, blinking sleep from brown eyes that never failed to make Ron’s heart lurch.  “I told her I’d kill any beasts that looked at her cross-eyed, but that only made her cry more.”
“Only ones that pertain to them,” Draco retorted.  The half-truth tasted bitter.  “But I didn’t think you’d want to see them.”
Time in Azkaban moved to the beat of several drums.  There was the shift change of the guards.  Thrice daily, in a cacophony of footfalls.  Afternoons spent in the yard, metered out by his father's knuckles.  Weeks measured in the bloom and fade of bruises, with trips to the infirmary at what seemed like irregular intervals, but turned out to be distinctly related to the guard schedule.
He tried to keep his eyes above the man’s chest and failed miserably.  Whether he had intentionally turned to outline his figure in the bright doorway, Harry wasn’t sure.  But it was difficult to ignore.  Long legs, narrow waist.  A dancer’s build, Harry thought.
It was his turn to panic.  One percent of a baby was plenty of fucking baby.  Maybe his body had reversed it?  Maybe it hadn’t worked that well after all and there
“Well, what, Ron?”  Harry demanded, kicking small rocks down into the nearest pit.  It was meters deeper than it had been even a few days ago.  What the fuck was Ron doing out here?
Draco’s lips part as Harry moves inside him, but he’s silent. His fingers pull Harry’s grip from his hip, and Draco clutches Harry’s hand to his chest.
She swallowed demonstrably and dried her hands on her t-shirt.  Her jeans were somewhere in the living room, and she was glad she’d packed a handful of knickers.
A bead tricked down his length, and he spread it as he stroked.  Tense weight built deep in his hips, urged on by the steady press and release inside him.
“No,” Harry said, scraping out the last of the curry.  “I think you and I know cruelty when we see it, Draco.”
His lips sought out new territory along her jaw, and down her neck, his beard tickling as he went. Her hands had found a mission in freeing his cock from its denim cage. The button and zipper gave way easily enough, but Circe’s snatch, these jeans were tight.
“Okay, let’s start with the ribbon.  Blue means it’s from an orphan.  Which, from you, looks like a pity play, what with the Obliviation and whatnot,” Ron instructed, sipping a cup of scarlet tea.
Malfoy ignores the question to look up at the man over his shoulder. “Zanny. Darling. A glass of chardonnay would not be remiss.”
Ron was already sorting parts and had moved on to slipping anchors into cutouts, matching screws and test-fitting them. He was surprisingly adept with the tiny tool, spinning it deftly between his thick fingers then switching to press it firmly with his thumb.
Long fingers wrapped easily around him, and he gasped.  How the hell did Draco’s hand fit his cock better than his own?  The other man grinned and gripped him tight, earning a low moan.  Gods, his hands were fucking
Malfoy plucked the ginger cat off his shoulder and deposited him on the carpet, much to the creature’s dismay.
“Harry, back up.  I don’t mind being on display, but I do mind showing up to Azkaban with an Auror’s nose up my ass.”
The name started on his lips, hard and tight, and his tongue flicked forward in the middle of the name, and the end of it rolled into the back of his mouth like cigar smoke.
She was the first woman he’d thought of a couple weeks ago when Ron had suggested he was dating pensioners.  He’d always wondered if she were married.  Or had kids.  Or maybe a cat and a house full of amazing artwork.  That seemed most likely.
“Ron!” she hugged him as though she could meld them together and never separate again. He held her like she was the last solid thing on Earth. Tears welled in her eyes, and she hid them against his chest. He did the same, burying his face in her hair.
The images faded, and he was back in the hive.  Visions of himself had surfaced in the controlled chaos.  Him in Quidditch kit.  Him in robes.  Him leveling a wand.  Malfoy’s memories, he realized.
After the estate assets had been frozen, he’d had enough in his own vault to buy the piece of land.  Its only amenities were the coastal bluffs and a short mine shaft that had hit a hot spring and been abandoned.
But it worried Harry.  If this was what Draco did alone; if this was what he liked, should Harry discourage the knicker-ripping, ass-fingering exhibitionism?
“Or, my personal least favorite, we can chit chat about our… whatever we’re doing.  Our not-dating,” Harry said, grimacing at his own poor explanation.  “You pick.”
His not-husband had said it would be a good idea to refamiliarize himself with the book, but he was more interested in the people than the bloody job description. Their unit was several dozen Aurors, partitioned into specific squads, and he couldn’t remember a single one of them.
Ron patted his own shoulder in invitation.  Uneasy, Draco stared at him, trying to get a read on what he meant by the gesture.  Ron shrugged, not offended by the skepticism.
“Time to go home, love,” Pansy said softly, still seated in front of him.  “I expect dinner invitations from you from now on, you know?”
Half my goddamn pile is his shit.  His socks lay on my suit jacket.  I have to get the fuck out of here.
It crescendos in a scarlet-plumed wall of smoke and fire that’s too close to Fiendfyre, and Harry turns away. Next to him, Eric kneels, eyes wide and lips parted. It would be the perfect time to kiss him, Harry thinks, but he can’t bring himself to do it.
It couldn’t be, he thought, tucking his shirt in his trousers and his trousers into his socks.  He’d only seen a spontaneous exodus of spiders once in his life.
“Uhm, no.  Bit lean, actually.  She took up running,”  Draco drawled, knowing any personal detail would derail Narcissa’s interrogation and avoid her own breakdown.  Maybe.
Draco smiled.  He was cute like this.  Unguarded.  Interested.  Engaged in something new and visceral.  Rather similar to watching him eat, Draco realized with a sigh.  Maybe this would become his favorite hobby.  Tantalizing Harry Potter with new modes of physicality.
He felt his mobile vibrate in his pocket, and ignored it.  The blue boxes teased him, and he focused on the left one.  A nudge of magic, and the top popped open, projections floating out.
Draco’s hands slid down Harry’s legs, along her torso, and gripped her hips as he thrust slowly up.  Hermione fought a moan as her hands settled under her navel and she whispered the spell.  Maybe for the last time in a while.
“Got up and walked away.”  Harry raised his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose, huffing out a long breath.  “But it doesn’t matter, Ron.  I can’t do anything about it for a year, anyway.  I told you what the Ministry policy is.”
I thrust into his hand, and push myself onto his tongue, but I want more.  So much more.  I want him inside me, and on top of me, and around me.  I want him to engulf me like a force of nature.  I want him to burn me down to the girders and kick the ashes.
He’d expected Potter to approach the soup with trepidation, but he’d tucked right in.  He’d even paused to compliment the bowls.  Draco hadn’t laid them all out, hesitation getting the better of him.
Unfortunately, they hadn’t gotten their hands dirty enough in the war to be given long sentences.  Too posh for drudgery, those Malfoys.
I hate him.  I forget it every day, and I fill that empty space with lazy brunches and whispered affections.  Until he pushes back into me in one hard thrust that sends white hot pleasure ricocheting behind my closed eyelids and I can’t think of wanting anything more than I want to have him inside me forever.
He wraps his arms around Draco’s chest and presses his face into his back, but it does little to muffle the howl that wrenches itself from his chest. His arm is on fire, and his eyes burn, and his throat feels scratched raw as he wails against the unresponsive body in his arms.
He watched her over the rim, taking her in.  Her ash blonde hair tumbled down in neat waves, framing deep blue eyes.  He often found himself admiring her more as a work of art than with desire.  She was always lovely.  A bit perfect.  A bit bland, even.  But the departure between her appearance and her tastes was part of the appeal.
He’ll say it’s my guilty conscience that made me imagine he was fucking his friends.  He might be right.  He’s always right.
Niggling guilt forced his gaze away again.  The mugs of tea were cooling rapidly.  Each sat in front of a chair like Draco really had expected to sit down to tea together in the middle of the night.
Draco's gaze flitted between the sign, "Janus Thickey Memory Ward, Persimmon Suite", and his nameless husband asleep on the small couch across the room. The man's robes were thrown over him in a makeshift red blanket, and his glasses straddled the armrest as if keeping watch on the ceiling.
His words were for Harry, but his gaze was on the delicate offering before him.  He knocked Harry’s knees wider with nudges from his shoulders, and slid his hands under Harry’s legs, curling his arms around to grip Harry’s hips.
Their eyes were level, and she could see him practically vibrating with outrage, his grey eyes molten. He was too close and too angry and gods below, he smelled like hot teakwood in the sun.
“Oh,” she whispered, startled.  She hadn’t planned that far.  “I was going to get my mobile out of the kitchen.”
Harry reached both palms out, brow knit in concentration.  It was unlike anything he’d encountered at work.  A brittle glass-like dome, but with a sticky, clingy layer.  It reminded him of a caramel-dipped shortbread.
Stark light from the windows lit his blond hair and graced his skin in a way lace never could.   Cold illumination glanced off the satin skirt below his hips, and cast the scene in harsh relief.  It was the only harsh thing about it, though, Harry thought.
Ron had been following a pair of Senior Aurors who’d been called to investigate an orphanage for magical children.  He’d said the conditions were horrendous.
Why would he mail her something?  And so soon?  He would have had to send it the morning after what she was calling “The Curry, Couch, and Cunnilingus Cavalcade”.  Such a weird night.  Good weird.  But weird.
At the corner of his eyes, he could see the slight pinkness starting to spread on Draco’s cheeks at his words, and knew that his plan, even though he got caught, was working.
Eventually it died out. The reception hall was empty by then, everyone having moved on. Draco and Harry both found themselves trying to get enough air to calm their breathing, but eventually Draco felt it was safe enough for him to straighten up. Next to him, Harry did the same. He reached over to one of the floating trays and grabbed a few napkins, handing one to Draco and using the other one himself. Draco accepted it.
Harry took a sip, grimacing at the bitter flavour. The beer wasn’t very friendly, but it dulled the feeling of depression that loomed over him.
innocent. He looked directly at Draco as he made a show out of taking off his shirt, one button at a time. Draco was
When he was still hung on the high of the end of the War. When he still thought that he would finally find some peace of mind. He’d wanted to introduce Draco – they’d only just started dating – to some Muggle music, and Oasis held the first available concert. Harry bought them both T-shirts that day to help them fit in the crowd. Harry had worn his quite often since, finding it comfortable when he was lounging around the house.
For a moment, Harry was speechless. Draco – always top-fashion, wouldn’t-be-caught-dead-in-anything-that-costs-less-than-fifty-galleons-and-wasn’t-tailored-to-his-exact-frame Draco – wore his
“Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t know it was still a secret.” She looked more sorry that Lucius’ information was inaccurate. Astoria was her niece, and despite being stripped of a lot of their properties after the War, the Malfoy name still had its charm in the right circles. The Blacks were a part of those circles. “Congratulations,” she said.
Draco wasn’t sure how to react to that. He knew he should probably be offended, but he wasn’t. He’d lived his entire life being terrified of Lucius. He hadn’t realized that until becoming an adult and having at least
Again with the pet names. But it bothered Draco much less this time; as if the initial shock of being referred to as anything other than ‘Malfoy’ or ‘git’ by Potter had worn off and left room for the possibility of them having a different kind of relationship.
“Harry,” Draco cut sweetly into her words before she could say a name. He had a feeling that his father might have had something sinister in store for him, especially after the way he looked at the two of them when Draco first introduced Potter to him as his date. He offered a sweet smile. “Yes, that’s correct.” To prove his point, Draco searched for Potter’s hand, grabbed it, then pulled him closer. He heard Potter gasp. He knew that this wasn’t exactly what they agreed on. But if his father was walking around claiming he was engaged, then Draco had to pretend it was true. Partially, anyway; he assumed that his father was claiming his fiancé was Astoria, rather than Potter. He’d been trying to convince Draco to let go of his
So they settled on having three judges; Draco, and one selected judge for each Harry and Kreacher. Harry chose Ron, knowing that regardless of what was being served to him, he would vote for Harry; Kreacher chose Pansy Parkinson, knowing that the pureblood would most likely vote for the purist house-elf.
Another tray - this time a trash tray - floated in their direction; possibly summoned by the offended serving tray. Draco used the opportunity and placed his own wet napkin on it. He let out a short, bitter chuckle as it slowly floated away. “No. He disowned me.”
He wasn’t completely wrong, at least about the second part, but it wasn’t bad enough today for Harry to push him away.
Draco could feel Harry tensing next to him, but he pretended he didn’t notice it as he calmly replied. “We haven’t settled on a date yet, but please rest assured that we will send you an owl once we do. I know how busy your schedule is.”
Draco wasn’t sure how he felt when he watched his father disappearing between the sea of lavish dress robes and floating party trays. A mixture of fear from the significance of the step he’d just made, and the elevating feeling of freedom that he’d finally made that one step, finally freed himself from the chains that held him from doing what he wanted to do,
He suddenly understood how stupid and naive he’d been to think that pretending to date Potter would get Lucius to back off. That maybe Lucius would even understand him and accept him for who he was. That was never going to happen.
Harry rolled his eyes at the memory of his own words; the words that made Draco suggest that instead of fighting, he and Kreacher would just compete against each other in a cook-off. With him as the judge, of course.
He brought his hand to his mouth, and, while maintaining eye contact with Draco, proceeded to lick the white liquid off his skin. Slowly. Harry had to fight the urge to laugh as Draco moved slightly in his seat.
He could hear Potter’s laughter intensifying, as if hearing Draco laughing as well somehow encouraged him. As if they were stuck in some kind of a loop, Draco’s laugh grew wilder, louder, too. His eyes closed and he could feel wetness at their corners. He placed his hand on his stomach, feeling like he might fall and roll on the floor if he didn’t support himself
Draco’s hand found Harry’s, and gave it a light squeeze. “Good. I also brought your favorite book from the Manor. And, oh,” there was something sinister about Draco’s smile as he leaned closer to kiss his ear. “I have a few ideas for some
He frowned, annoyed and disappointed, when the dough broke. Tears were forming in his otherwise perfect sheet. He wasn’t sure what he did wrong, but he didn’t think he had time to fix it. Kreacher was already almost done with his lasagna sheets; plus, fucking up would surely take off some points from his score. He worked his brain, trying to think about how he could fix this, moving the dough around and just creating further damage.
He was caught. He knew that Ron wouldn’t understand, but he should’ve known Parkinson would be a bit more attentive. He considered stopping his little show; but knew that it would mean losing, and he wasn’t going to lose to
. Trust Potter and his hero complex. “It would’ve happened anyway sooner or later,” he said, trying to make his voice sound indifferent. The truth of it hurt. “I should be thanking you for sparing me Merlin knows how many more years of him pretending I’m who he wants me to be instead of accepting who I am.”
He scoffed, scowling as he was annoyed at himself. Feeling sorry for himself won’t get him anywhere. Getting drunk, however, would at least make it a little bit more bearable. He gulped the rest of his beer and then glared at the empty bottle in annoyance, more pissed at himself for not thinking ahead and having a few more laying around within arm’s length. He groaned and pushed himself up –
The large room was filled with scents of delicious fresh tomatoes cooking with basil and various other ingredients. Harry wasn't the only one who felt dizzy from how good the tomato sauce Kreacher was making seemed; he could see all three judges constantly drifting to sniff it, looking curiously at Kreacher's work, while only when they remembered he existed did Harry see their eyes moving to him.
He’d tried several things, from the Auror Academy to waitressing at Rosa’s place down in Hogsmeade, but he wasn’t able to stay longer than a few weeks – a couple of months, at most – anywhere. Ron and Hermione kept throwing suggestions at him, offering different types of jobs he might be able to do, but after trying several of those and feeling the same sort of emptiness, he started turning them down with various excuses.
“I’m fine,” he lied. But it was nice to feel Draco’s warmth against him. He could swear he could feel his heartbeat through his shirt, even though the smooth, slightly rigid texture made it more difficult than his usual high-thread silk shirts –
Lucius narrowed his eyes, his pupils moving between Potter and Draco, as if he was examining every nuance of their appearance. “Do you, now?”
Draco gave him a once-over, and the twitch at the side of his lips had told Harry that his disheveled state was noted and registered. Not that Harry would have thought otherwise.
It certainly did not help that he’d been feeling this way for a while. He was usually alright; functioning, at least, to a degree. He was able to mostly keep his place clean, with the help of Kreacher, and he had beers and simple foods in his fridge most of the time. He didn’t have a job. Still hadn’t managed to figure out what he wanted to do as an adult wizard.
Harry shrugged mentally and turned his eyes back to his beer. It was a Muggle brand. As much as he liked Butterbeer, somehow it wasn’t as strong – and it was too sweet for him at times. Times when he was overcome by his ongoing depression. Like tonight.
Harry wanted to kiss Ron for helping him out, because he could think of no excuses. Parkinson glared at Ron, then glared at Harry, and then crossed her arms over her chest. “Fine then, but doing all that’s not going to make your
So Harry found himself slaving in the kitchen trying to make the best Alfredo pasta he'd ever made, while Kreacher was making his own creation of Lasagna.
He was vaguely aware of the witches and wizards who were staring at them. They probably thought they’d gone mad. Had the news of Lucius disowning him already spread around? Or did they just think they’d drunk a few too many shots of firewhiskey? It should’ve bothered him; but much to his astonishment, he didn’t care. He’d spent his entire life caring what other people thought of him. He was tired of it. As if Lucius telling him he wasn’t going to support anymore him set him free not only from his constant control, but from the rules that dictated his life.
Draco rolled his eyes. He should've known, when he asked Potter to be his escort to the wedding of a distant cousin, that he was setting himself up for an especially annoying evening. He had no idea what was going through his mind when he approached him –
Draco ignored how fake it sounded. She didn’t even put any effort into sounding genuine. “Thank you, Auntie Lyra. Now, if you’d excuse us, I think I see Uncle Cepheus there, and I have yet to greet him.”
Then it hit him. Who said that pasta had to be perfectly shaped? His mind was racing; he could just keep tearing it apart, and have pasta shreds. No one would know it wasn’t his initial intention. Smiling, he started tearing the dough intentionally. He then moved on, grabbing the knife and turning his attention to the onion. The knife was sharp and required almost no strength at all; but Harry still flexed his bicep, glancing at Draco to make sure he was watching, fighting a smirk when he saw that his man’s full attention was on him and his motions.
it was to break free. But that one chuckle rolled and turned into a whole-hearted laugh that rumbled through his chest, almost aching. The kind Draco rarely allowed himself; especially in public, not even when his only witness was Pansy, the only person who still remained his friend.
For some reason, though, Draco didn’t comment on it. “I was,” he said instead and walked past Harry into the house.
, and sitting alone in a worn-out T-shirt that probably belonged in the recycling trash by now and it was only by some miracle that Draco hadn’t forced him to throw it out yet.
Strangely enough, however, Potter stayed, albeit grumpily. They were approached by other wedding guests, more frequently from that point on. Apparently, the news of Lucius Malfoy’s son’s expected marriage to none other than The Chosen One was hot gossip and it travelled in the room faster than the Knight Bus on a busy night. Draco could tell that Potter wasn’t pleased, but Draco was relieved to see that his assumption that Potter wouldn’t be able to resist his need to help everyone seemed to be accurate.
The surprise in his voice reminded Draco of who they really were to each other. Co-workers who used to hate each other and grew to tolerate each other, at best. What they did today – it was only a show. Harry didn’t owe him anything. The kiss meant nothing; just a way to make Lucius back off.
Draco opened his eyes at the loss of Potter’s lips and was met by a sea of green again; but the lines of worry that adorned his forehead were gone, replaced with small lines at the corners of his eyes - the hint of a smile. Draco couldn’t help himself and found himself mirroring the smile, letting out a single, breathless chuckle.
His only hope was that he managed to get Draco horny enough to cloud his judgement. He watched him as he looked at both dishes, watched his mouth as he moved his tongue on his lips. Harry could recognize his little mannerisms, could imagine the struggle inside him.
“Master Harry,” the elf said without turning around, “The treacle tart turned out wonderfully, and the beef stew master is so partial to is almost finished. Can Kreacher offer any other assistance?”
They decided to go with a mixture of burgundy and vermilion for the walls, another idea of Luna’s, because she liked the energy that the reds gave off. Draco didn’t mind, though he was a little less enthusiastic about the uniforms they had decided on. He already expressed that he wouldn’t mind whatever colors Luna chose, but when she showed up to his flat with an armful of brilliant purple fabric, exclaiming that purple would be the perfect color for Draco to wear for his apron, he was hesitant until she showed him the sandy-colored shirt that would go underneath it. Finding he liked the combination, he tugged the shirt over his head and tied the apron around his middle, and modeled for a delighted Luna.
“Is that a wand in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” He cringed inwardly at the pickup line, but it had the effect he wanted - Potter froze and began to stammer. Draco turned around and placed his thigh back between Potter’s legs, drinking in the deep brown eyes, almost absent thanks to his blown-out pupils. How he wished Potter hadn't Glamoured them! Yes, this was the right choice, but it was so difficult not to give into his sexual desire. “This is a Muggle club, James. What are you doing here?” Draco held his breath. Would he admit that he was actually Harry Potter? Would he run off?
As though he could sense that I was awake, his eyes shot open and those cinereous eyes found mine. I knew the next question he would ask, before the words even left his lips.
At least this was familiar; Draco was frequently this demanding, even on his good days. “Right away, princess.” Harry said, and dodged as a pillow was thrown at his face. “What the hell, Draco?!”
“Oddly enough, that makes sense.” Draco watched as Harry flitted around the kitchen. He could feel Draco’s eyes boring into him, but he chose to ignore it as he seared the lamb shanks before putting them into the oven.
“Don’t you see,” Blaise leaned forward, a mad glint in his eyes, “You could completely recreate him. Draco Malfoy, from the ground up. He could be your perfect, pliant boytoy if you only let yourself be selfish for one damn second.”
Draco stalked forward, and crowded Harry back against the counter. “Let you go?” He teased, running his nose up Harry’s jaw and ghosting a kiss on his lips. “Never.”
“Yes, bro code or whatever.” Hermione continued, seeming to ignore Ron. “The statute of limitations must have passed by now, so have a go. Worst that can happen is that she’ll say no, right?” Draco couldn’t stand eavesdropping any longer. He had his own questions he wanted answers to. Turning off the water, he dried his hands off before exiting the kitchen and addressing his - were they friends? - in the lobby.
“Muggle?” He asked, and smiled when Draco nodded. “Brilliant.” His face seemed to shimmer, and his hair turned back to the messy jet black locks; the lightning bolt scar reappearing on his forehead. Draco noticed that he took a deep, steadying breath and the smile on his face became a bit strained. “Ready for your party?”
“Kind of obvious, wasn’t it?” Ginny snorted, “Harry coming out of your room, looking freshly shagged…”
Thanks for reading so far! I'm having a lot of fun, and the relationship is beginning to bloom. Yay for friend things! xD
His eyes settled on the figure in the bed, and his wand dropped to his side. Harry was thrashing around, tangled in the sheets, mumbling to himself. Draco let out the breath he was holding - Harry was just having a dream. A nightmare, by the looks of it. He carefully walked to the bed and held out a hand, pausing momentarily before placing it on Harry’s shoulder. At once, Harry’s eyes flew open and he looked wildly around, unfocused.
“What’s your favorite?” Draco handed the last spoon to Harry and rinsed his hands before moving towards the refrigerator.
“Sorryyyy~” her voice drifted out, and Draco knew she was going back to finish conversing with the plants they had in the back garden. With a sigh, he placed his own wand next to Luna’s and entered the kitchen. He had quite a bit of prep work to do if today’s opening was any indication. Without the Harpies and their endorsement, he still expected quite a few people to stop by tomorrow; their location was extremely centralized.
He wanted so desperately to help Draco, but he had no idea where to start. Being an injury Healer was easy; the diagnostic spell was almost foolproof and there was a potion or a tincture for any physical malady. Brain injuries and damage, though… those were a whole different story.
Harry waited until he heard the door close before rising unsteadily to his feet. He hurt. He knew it was best to keep their relationship platonic at this point, especially since it would feel like he was taking advantage of Draco if he made any sort of move on him. That didn’t make it any less painful to watch him walk away without a goodnight hug and kiss.
Harry did as he was told and followed Draco, sitting down in front of the warm tart. Handing Draco a fork, he dug in immediately, his eyes falling closed as the warm, gooey treat hit his tongue. He chewed happily for a moment before swallowing and meeting Draco’s amused gaze. “This is the best treacle tart I’ve ever had!” He proclaimed, taking another bite before frowning. “And I’m not sure if I can be around them, not just yet. You saw how Hermione likes to pick at me, and Ron I think is still sore that Ginny and I didn’t work out.” Draco took his own bite of the tart - it wasn’t perfect, he’d have to work on the recipe, but he wasn’t about to tell Harry that - and shrugged his shoulders.
“Like… like this?” Potter began to match Draco’s swaying, their bodies close enough to brush against each other. Taking the hand that was previously running through his own hair, Draco brought it around Potter’s neck and leaned in closer, reveling in the shiver that ran through his body.
Harry took a steadying breath. He knew that Draco was lashing out because he was scared, but didn’t want to admit it. He always hid his emotions, and had only recently begun to open up to Harry and sometimes Ron. The regression hit Harry like a brick wall. “Do you know who was just in the room with us?” He tried to switch the subject.
Dropping his fork with a clatter, Harry started at Draco, who resolutely refused to meet his eyes. “Do you… are you referring to the fact that you’re gay, Draco?” He asked incredulously.
“Well.” Harry was fiddling with the edge of his shirt. “This is it. It’s not much, and there’s still a lot of work to do, but… it’s mine. I live here.” He said it almost defiantly, daring Draco to say something back. Draco took a few steps of his own, following his nose down the stairs and into a rather open kitchen area. There, a wizened old house elf was bustling around, pulling a steaming hot pan of treacle tart from the oven.
Harry reached out and rested a hand on Draco’s blanketed knee. “No, Draco, of course I’m not mad at you.” He rubbed his thumb in soothing circles. “Why would I be mad at you?”
“Opening week is very important, after all,” Luna mused, twirling a strand of hair between her fingers, “and we have a lot of ideas to discuss!” Draco nodded and half-listened while she was happily chattering about different flavors of muffins and possibly expanding into a full breakfast and lunch area. He turned down that idea, stating that it was entirely too early to be expanding anything, but let his mind drift as she was explaining how she could use the coffee grounds as fertilizer for the garden out back. He kept thinking about Potter and how he was holed up in his flat without family, only getting visits a few times a week from the same people. Then again, he didn’t know if Potter had any other friends, and it was entirely possible that he was having people over every day. Doubtful, he thought, from how the others were talking.
“Wench!” He spat fondly, rolling his eyes. “Well, I suppose we’ll just see, won’t we?” Alyce chuckled with a nod, and turned to serve someone who had just come up to the bar.
“I am well aware, Weasley,” Blaise drawled, marking his place in the book and closing it. “I’ve been here since day one. Who knew that being a Curse Breaker was so dangerous?”
I woke up three days later, in Draco Malfoy’s bed, surrounded by pillows. Draco was asleep in an armchair next to me. I pressed down on my leg and felt the bandages there, but the pain was merely a dull ache. He must have healed me.
“Very well.” Pushing in his chair, Draco turned to leave the room. “I’ll be in my room, then. Please don’t disturb me, for I have quite a lot of thinking to do. Thank you for cooking the food I marinated.” And with that, Draco disappeared up the stairs.
“Ready to go?” He asked, breaking the silence at last. Draco stiffened, then relaxed as he turned and faced Harry, an eyebrow raised.
With all of their talking about past classmates and their own lives, there was one person who was extremely absent from their musings - the one and only Savior of the wizarding world, Harry Potter. Draco realized relatively early on that no one really spoke of Potter, only in extremely brief spurts and only when talking about the past. He had asked Luna about it once, and she had just shrugged with a sad look in her eye. “Keeps to himself, mostly,” she said, “He was supposed to be an Auror, you know… never showed up on the first day of training.” Questions burned in Draco’s mind at that, but he didn’t want to ask these new people who he still didn’t quite consider his friends. He didn’t want to pry, and he didn’t want to seem overly eager. If he wanted anyone to be his friend, still, after all these years, it was Potter - but he definitely felt that ship had sailed. True, Potter had spoken at his and his parent’s trials, and had saved his mother and himself a hefty Azkaban sentence, but that was really the last time he saw Potter. He was basically a ghost, a memory.
“Of course I do,” he replied. His voice was surprisingly steady considering the whirlwind that was raging inside him.
Draco forced himself to smile. “Yes. Harry is a bit of a jealous type,” he said. He saw Potter’s eyebrow arching up, but he didn’t say anything to contradict him. So he kept going, unable to hold himself back, now that he’d started. “You cannot
With his vegetables ready, it was time to start with the actual cooking. He put a pan on the stove and turned the fire on, throwing some butter into it. He added in the onions and sauteed them before throwing in the mushrooms as well. Stealing another glance at Draco, seeing he was still very much focused on him, Harry held the pan’s handle, and mixed the vegetables in swift throwing movements.
Draco placed the package he was holding – how did Harry not notice it until now? – on the messy coffee table. He pushed a few items to make enough room for it, which made Harry almost flinch at his own messiness. He usually cleaned up – at least a little bit, and with Kreacher’s help – before Draco came over.
dating, after all.” Potter’s hand left Draco’s, making him look at him in confusion. It changed into surprise when instead, it was inching around his waist.
Or perhaps it was Draco’s own freedom that allowed him to see Potter for who he really was for the first time in his life. Just another young man, who’d been through more in his short life than all the people Draco knew
He could see Potter looking between him and his father. Was he going to bolt now that their cover was officially blown? Draco hoped not. Facing his father on his own after having pretended to be engaged to Potter was bound to be much worse than facing him when trying to tell him he had no intention of marrying Astoria without any additional weight to it. Or any other witch, for that matter. He hated to admit that, but Potter’s presence next to him helped him hold his ground.
. He was twenty-four, unemployed, his inheritance already half gone, without any sort of certificate to show that he was capable of finishing
“I’m…” he paused, letting a short, uncertain laugh. Finding it hard to put his emotions and thoughts in order. “Thank you,” he managed. “You didn’t have to do it.”
Potter blinked at the term of endearment. Well, if Potter was allowed to, then Draco should be, too; and Potter should live with that in peace. He nodded. Why did his surprised face induce such warmth in Draco’s stomach?
“It was,” Draco agreed. He put his wand away and walked towards Harry, wrapping his arms around him and placing a kiss on the top of his messy hair. “But it looked like you needed me tonight more than my work, so I came here.”
A lock of hair tickles Harry’s ear, and he almost brushes it away with one dough-covered hand, but stops himself just in time. Thick, sticky bread dough coats his fingers like a puffy glove. He scowls at the beige lump on the counter and gathers it up to roll it into the flour scattered next to it. Something about the humidity is making it-
His focus was being rapidly drained by his efforts to ignore the exposed skin of her abdomen, the tightness of her shirt, her nipples peeking through, and the continued warmth of her hip against his calf.
“I’m sterile.”  He let the statement hang, watching her lift her face to stare at him in disbelief.  “So if that’s what this is about, I’m willing to listen, but I’m not on trial here.”
The Floo roared to life, and Ron surveyed the wreckage covering the kitchen table with a grimace.  Mum would not appreciate the rock shards littering the surface.  And the floor.  And the dust drifting about the freshly-scrubbed kitchen.
Mind reeling, Harry carefully considered the dozens of questions he wanted to ask.  Malfoy’s eyelids were drooping, and his earlier flush was gone.
“I was disappointed, to say the least. It’s really all I remember of that summer. There is… or at least was… a garden of mirrors next to the conservatory. I used to sneak off and bounce spells off the mirrors when Narcissa was… Narcissaing.”
He’d been suspicious of Falk in the deaths of the Aurors and the man in the bar, and this all but confirmed it.  And Falk had done all of this without missing a cue from Basilia.  Like it was little more than breathing for him.
“You can’t make up for blood with drama, Weasley,”  Draco said, rolling his eyes.  “Spread the skin a bit tighter and do it again.”
Harry didn’t even need Draco’s suggestive pull as he placed their clasped hands on Harry’s behind to know what he meant. He wasn’t in the mood for that right now, but he knew that with Draco’s nurturing, and after enjoying the pie, he would probably feel differently.
Draco, apparently, noticed his look. “I got you a cake, too. It’s a Treacle Tart. It’s not home-made, but it’s from a good place, so I think you’ll like it.”
Why was this kiss affecting him so much? It was just a kiss. Draco’ d been kissed before. By better kissers.
“Keep your curiosity to yourself. Oh, hello Auntie Lyra,” Draco replaced his annoyed frown with a charming smile as he spotted one of his mother’s cousins. “Have you met my boyfriend, Harry Potter?”
pretending, yes; but Lucius was supposed to think it was real. The notion that Lucius was apparently humiliated by the fact that Draco was dating someone he hadn't been set up with - and a wizard, at that - stung him like a
He watched his Aunt Lyra as she proceeded to give Potter the look through; head to toes and back again. He saw her eyes lingering for a few seconds on his forehead. It’s been a decade since the War had ended and the Dark Lord was officially defeated (again, and, hopefully, indefinitely this time), but people still thought that there was something special about Potter because of the scar. Idiots.
“Draco dear! No, I haven’t, actually,” her smile faltered as she glanced at Potter, but only briefly. “So good to see you,” she smiled at him. “Both of you.”
“But I can tell it hurts him to hear about the different dates you try to set up for me. So please, father, stop. I’m perfectly happy where I am now, by Harry’s side.”
. The loathing in Lucius’ eyes told him the same story. It hurt more than he thought it would, after everything Lucius had put him through. He ruined his life; in more than one way. He didn’t
Draco was surprised at how indifferent it made him feel, now that the initial shock had been processed. “
He saw the confused look on Potter’s face. Could almost see him refusing, breaking their deal and apparating away. It wasn’t like Potter owed him anything; Draco only offered to take over his paperwork at the office for the next month. He knew that this wasn’t really the make-or-break part of this little favour. He was mostly counting on his hero complex and his need to save everyone.
“Aren’t you supposed to be working?” Harry found himself asking. He knew very well how he looked, in his tattered, faded T-shirt and an old, ugly pair of boxers. He hadn’t bothered combing his hair all day, so it was even messier than usual, especially since he was long overdue for a haircut (as Draco did like to remind him). To top that, he’d had the chocolate cake Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had owled over to him for dinner, and he was pretty sure that he wasn’t careful enough with his eating to make sure there were no chocolate smears on his face.
Draco glanced sideways and saw his father’s horrified look. He looked like he was a second away from trying to tear Potter away from him, or disowning Draco. Or both. Seeing that something as simple as a kiss could induce such a reaction from his father ignited a fire in Draco. He moved his eyes back to look at Harry, now noticing the little frown on his forehead. The shock of
Draco looked at Potter, saw his eyes looking at him worriedly behind his glasses. Those ugly glasses he hadn’t changed – or at least, hadn’t changed the
Lucius’s eyes narrowed even farther, but then, for whatever reason, he straightened up and instead looked at the two of them arrogantly. “If that is what you really want Draco, I won’t stop you.”
Draco looked sideways sharply. Potter looked, still, very uncomfortable; but there was something different about him now. It wasn’t the same embarrassment and general look of wishing-he-could-apparate-away that had been hiding under his mask of politeness all evening. It looked more like – was he feeling
Draco didn’t know what to make of Potter’s tone, but there was definitely something sinister about it. He didn’t get to speculate about it for long, though, because it was only a brief second before Potter’s hand went from resting on his waist to gripping him hard and pulling him closer. He had no time to protest – no time to even
very happy. Considering he proposed to me, I can only assume I make him happy too. Isn’t that right, honey?”
Potter’s voice cut through the frenzy of Draco’s thoughts, bringing him back to the present. Around them the party went on just as it did before this encounter with Lucius. It seemed that everyone was too busy to notice his drama. They were drifting around the room, talking, drinking, eating. Unaware of the major life change he’d just gone through, unaware that the world, the way he knew it his entire life, had just shattered. It felt surreal that something that was this significant to him could go so unnoticed by everyone else.
“Oh, no, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Possibly in France, maybe by the beach, or at one of the vineyards, we haven’t finalized the details yet -  “
, caused a cell memory of some sort, Draco brought his hand up to his mouth, moved his fingers over his lower lip, thoughtful. He could no longer taste Harry; but the memory of how his lips felt pressed against his remained, sharp as if they’d only just parted.
Draco gasped at the feeling of soft lips against his own and the wet warmth of Potter’s mouth. This was not a part of the agreement, very much not. He was confused. Potter had absolutely no reason to do anything more than pretend they were dating, and he’d made it rather clear that he wasn’t happy about playing along with anything Draco added to the basic agreement. What had changed?
“Of course, Draco, of course. It was great seeing you, and I’m very happy about the exciting news,” she almost turned, but then seemed to remember that Potter was there too. She offered her hand to him, and he took it, shaking it awkwardly. “Harry Potter. It was great meeting you, too. When should I expect your invitation?”
Harry could tell that Draco was already straining to control himself, could already recognize the slight difference in tone, the hint of hoarseness.
Right. But Draco’s head was elsewhere at that time. Too busy thinking about what had to be the biggest change in his life so far. “Why?”
of – since school. And they were ugly back then, too. But something was different now. Perhaps it was the kiss, and all the feelings it generated in him. Perhaps it was the role he’d played in setting Draco free from his father and his outdated views.
It gave Draco time to process, and he realized that Harry was still there next to him, and they’d just both made complete fools of themselves. After having kissed.
“I’m so sorry that my existence humiliates you, father,” he said bitterly instead. His voice was cold, shaking with self restraint, frustration, fury. He hoped that Lucius wouldn’t think that he was about to
“No.” The mere thought was repulsive. “But it’s better than – never mind. Just play along, alright?”
They laughed together for a while; long enough for people to just move on to gossip about them somewhere else. Long enough for Draco to be gasping for air, to no longer care that his eyes were tearing.
logo that used to decorate the front of his shirt. The drowning car underneath it was barely visible, looking more like unintelligible patches of blue and white than the cover of the album it was representing. He was never a big fan – they were okay, nothing more - but it was the first time he allowed himself to enjoy a concert.
Confused, still in disbelief that Harry agreed with him, appreciative of the gesture and of the suggestion (Merlin, he
He smiled back, putting up no resistance as Draco’s other hand slid over his arm, taking the empty beer bottle from him. “That sounds like a pretty good birthday to me,” Harry said, and moved his head to kiss Draco’s lips again. “Thank you.”
the reason behind this sudden change? Draco wasn’t sure; but whatever Potter’s motivation was, it was working in Draco’s favour.
“I vote for Harry,” Ron announced. He placed his fork down, grimacing as he swallowed the last of his bite of Harry’s pasta.
him they’d be free. Of course everyone had good excuses, and everyone had said that they’d celebrate with him next weekend; Draco even popped in his fireplace to wish him a happy birthday through a Floo call. But it didn’t help him feel less lonely, sitting alone on the living room floor of Grimmauld Place with nothing but a cheap beer to keep him company.
