“A month I think. We only found out this week.” Sirius told her, stepping to the side as a healer pushed an elderly man in a wheelchair past them.
“‘M sick of kids already.” Neville muttered and Harry and Hermione laughed, “Seriously though, It’s weird to be going back. Exciting though.”
“Harry anything could have happened to you. You agreed with the aurors to keep a low profile until they found out who was threatening you.”
Harry shuffled on the sofa, pulling his feet up under him and resting his head against the cushions; he could hear Remus and Sirius talking in the kitchen, heard his name said in hushed tones, and sighed. He had only been back here a couple of hours and he had been asked if he was okay at least ten times and been offered four cups of tea since then; he knew it was all done out of love but frankly it was exhausting.
“Teaching assistant.” Neville corrected.
Draco paused at that, wondering if the boredom was what had led Potter back onto the app in the first place, maybe he hadn't been looking to talk to Draco at all but to pick up some other guy for the night.
“Harry!” There was a warning tone to Sirius’ voice and he felt a flash of anger, why was Sirius telling him off when Remus was the one being unreasonable
Sirius sighed, “I’m not mad.” He said, “I’m just concerned. But he does seem like a decent kid and merlin knows we all deserve a second chance.” It had been the way they were together that had sold it to him way more than Draco’s good manners really, those had clearly been put on just as much as his had when he was meeting the Lupins all those years ago, but the affection on the boy’s face when talking to Harry… Well that had eased some of Sirius’ discomfort.
“It’s your godfather.” Sirius he supplied loudly, before adding “Maybe let me in?” A little more quietly to the blonde who was still blinking up at him in surprise.
“It was good to see you.” Harry told Dennis who gave him a tight smile. Just as they were turning to leave someone came rushing past, shoving into Harry and sending him tripping forward, almost bashing into Dennis as he did so, “Watch where you’re going!” Harry said, turning to scowl at the person who was already halfway down the street, their cloak billowing behind them. “You alright?” He asked Dennis who nodded and handed him the books he’d dropped, “Thanks.” Harry said, shoving them into his bag and quickly side stepping as one of the shop assistant came rushing out of the shop and raced up the street after the cloaked figure.
“Love you too you daft sod.” Sirius said, ducking as a tea towel came flying towards his face. “You know you can use magic to wash up right Moon?”
Harry sank back against the pillows, “S’good, thanks.” He mumbled, feeling his eyes closing again, as he drifted off he thought of Draco again and hoped the man was okay and hadn’t been scared off by all this.
Tonks gave a small shrug, “They’d already booked him for nicking some gold quills. Says he knows nothing about you and so far his story adds up.” She said.
“Yeah, I figured. And I really don’t think it’s that. Harry uh… he had a note in his pocket, another one of the ones he was sent at the start of the summer. We’re tracing it as best we can but so far all we know is that a postal owl delivered it on tuesday morning.”
Thank you so much for your patience and your reviews and kudos.
Draco threw his phone down onto the sofa, standing up and giving the man a smile, "Hello."
“That’s what happens the week before September first.” Harry pointed out, taking a swig of his beer and rolling his eyes at Neville who stifled a laugh, “Besides, S’good practice for our Nev here.”
“No!” Draco insisted, his eyes never leaving Sirius’ even when they heard the bedroom door open.
“He always was a good student.” Remus chipped in, removing his hand from Sirius’ leg and picking up his own mug of tea, “Put in more effort than some.” He added with a small grin and Sirius watched as Harry pulled a mock annoyed face.
"What is it you want baby? Use your words." Draco teased.
“Hopefully as much effort as he put into dressing up as a dementor and trying to scare the shit out of you.” Sirius muttered, shuffling up the sofa as Remus put down his mug again and sent him a disapproving look.
“Sorry, I didn’t think.” He muttered and Draco rolled his eyes.
The dots were back instantly and Draco smiled to himself as a reply popped up,
Sirius gritted his teeth, wondering, not for the first time, why his godson always had to insist on seeing the good in people, “He only got off at the trial because you…” He paused then, realising that this was yet another thing they had never fully discussed, he knew Harry had given evidence in the Malfoys favour but the trial had been closed and Harry had refused to talk about it afterwards.
The younger man ran his hand over his face, looking contemplative as he opened his mouth and Sirius waited, not sure if he wanted to hear what was coming next; he was almost grateful when the sound of the doorbell interrupted whatever Harry had been about to say and they both looked up as the door to the bedroom creaked open, “Is it safe me to answer the door?” Malfoy asked in an amused tone as he walked past the kitchen door, now fully dressed thankfully, “Weasley, perfect timing.” Malfoy said as he opened the front door, Sirius couldn’t quite make out what was said next but a moment later Ron appeared in the kitchen doorway.
He wondered if he was overthinking it, wondered if he was being overdramatic when he felt physically sick at the thought of Harry casting that curse. This was Harry for Merlin’s sake, little Harry who only used a disarming charm when defeating the evilest wizard of a generation, how the hell had he managed to cast such a dark curse? But Draco had said it was an accident, he reminded himself, that Harry hadn't even known what spell it was he was casting… He must have been terrified when he saw the blood, Sirius decided, the thought strangely comforting.  Sirius tried to close his eyes and settle to sleep but in his mind all he could see was Draco bleeding and Harry stood above him screaming
“Fuck you.” Sirius muttered automatically, though he could hear his voice breaking as he said it. Harry was right and he knew it deep down, Sirius had been a bully at school; cruel to other kids just to make people laugh, to feel better about how shit he had felt. And maybe Remus was right that he hadn’t changed, here he was still making shitty comments and winding other people up, he couldn’t help himself, part of being born a Black he supposed before his heart sank again because he wanted to be nothing like them.
He let out a huff of air, "Well, I promise to at least try to be less of a dick. Although, habit of a lifetime and all that."
Until five minutes ago that was when the 'last active' counter suddenly switched to online. Draco may or may not have spent the full five minutes staring at his phone, initially he had assumed the man would message him but that felt less and less likely with every passing minute. Maybe Potter didn't want to talk to him, maybe he thought last time was a mistake, maybe he was talking to someone else, Draco realised, feeling his jaw tense at the thought. He shouldn't be surprised really, he had only liked Potter's profile to start with out of a weird kind of curiosity and it had been a total shock that Potter had messaged him, and even more of one with what he had said. Not that Draco was complaining about that; it had certainly led to an interesting night.
"How the fuck did you even get these on?"
They both looked up as the door opened, "Tonks'll be here in half an hour." Remus told them and Sirius felt the tension in his throat return instantly.
Draco twisted his lips, looking like he disagreed, “You wanked off your childhood enemy in the bathroom of a club.” He pointed out and Harry scowled at him, ignoring Ron and Zabini’s twin sounds of disgusts.
"Hey." He reached out and grabbed Potter's wrist, holding it tightly, "I'd like to do that again sometime, if you want."
Draco replied, keen to continue.
Tonks looked as though he had slapped her but to her credit she simply nodded, “I’d better get to Hermione’s before she goes to bed.” She turned away, moving down the corridor before she paused and turned back to them, “Just… Keep me updated, and give him my love when he wakes up.”
“Liar.” Tonks said, she opened her mouth to say something else but Harry cut across.
“I’m fine.” Draco said quietly, his face expressionless as he walked away. Sirius wrinkled his lips, briefly wondering if he should follow the man and check on him for Harry’s sake, before deciding against it.
In the time he was waiting Draco finished his glass of whisky and poured himself another, he contemplated throwing on a shirt before deciding against it, Potter had already seen his bare chest so what was the point. He had a moment of doubt, aware that inviting Harry Potter over for a shag was probably not his most sensible of decisions but he shrugged it off quickly, glancing back over their previous conversation and pictures to remind him why he was doing this. He was still looking at them when the floo shot up and Potter stepped through.
Draco had expected that, and he wasn't exactly sober himself, although he didn't tell Harry that, instead making a glib comment about having to catch up and then sending the man his floo coordinates.
Harry smiled then, “and I love you for it Sirius, I really do. But you have to learn to trust me to make my own choices.”
Sirius scowled at that, wanting Ron to see that that was why he was concerned, “He’s -”
“He seems… nice.” Sirius said.
Sirius nodded, forcing himself to focus on the here and now and not on the what if’s; the younger healer pulled a chair over to the bed, motioning for Sirius to sit, and he thanked the man, dragging it as close to Harry as he could and taking his hand again. “I’m here pup, and I won’t let anything else happen to you.” Sirius murmured, feeling his throat tighten further as he remembered saying the exact same words last time, “You’re safe now.” He added quietly, his voice breaking as he did so. It was another ten minutes before Remus and Draco entered the room.
“Cup of tea?” Remus offered, looking confused at the change in atmosphere, and Sirius smiled his thanks, squeezing his arm in greeting and sliding into a chair by the table, opposite Harry. Harry barely acknowledged him, his eyes flickering upwards for a second before he looked back at the table, Draco had definitely told him Sirius realised, watching as Harry raised his hand to his mouth, gnawing at the skin on the edge of his nail; Sirius reached out and touched his arm to stop him, surprised at the speed Hary pulled it away from him and the panic on the man’s face, “Don’t bite your nails.” Sirius said softly, offering him a smile.
“Yeah.” Draco breathed, sniffing loudly and swiping at his eyes before he leant forward and placed his hand on top of Harry’s bandaged one, “When he wants to be.” He added with a soft laugh and Sirius smiled his agreement.
“I still don’t understand the need for a combined team,” said Draco. “Why not just select the best players?”
“Progress,” Snape announced, sweeping into the living room. “Has occurred. The prophecy has a small, hairline crack.” He held up the prophecy to show them. Harry couldn’t really see any difference. “I believe we must attribute this success to the trust exercises,” Snape continued, swishing back and forth in front of the TV. “How many of them did you complete while I was gone?”
“No! You know he can’t be trusted. Why would you help him bring me here? And where is this?”
“Yes! I started a petition to get him fired. The man was a menace.”
“Yeah, massive turn on.” Harry’s voice was dry enough to dessicate the swamp. “Come on, sex god, last one before we can shower and tell Angelina we’re dropping the team.”
“Pint for me,” said Ron, waving his half-empty glass, grinning as Draco nodded and sauntered over to the bar. “Well then.” He turned back to Hermione, nudging a bag of skittles towards her. “So, the er, the Phoenix is in the er, oven.”
“Don’t worry,” Tonks finally released her grip on Draco’s shoulder long enough to slap him on the back. “You’ll see him soon enough.”
“No. Asking someone to teach you one of the most complex pieces of defensive magic after waking them up at six-o-bloody-clock is a bit more than common courtesy.” Harry heard his own voice rising. “We are not “old school fellowes”, we are old school enemies and we are not bed mates, we are just sharing a bed so-”
“Urgh,” he slammed the beaker down. “These drinks are abominable, what are they?”
“Thanks.” Harry didn’t really want to put the hoodie back on. He rolled it up and stuck it behind the pillow, propping himself up to examine the room. “If I ask you a question,” he said, “Will you give me a proper answer? Without being a dick about it?”
Potter put down his own phone and turned to the waitress. “We need a few more minutes, thanks.”
“But mum’s being a bit much at the minute and—”
“Right,” said Draco, feeling rather off kilter. “Right, er. Right. See you later, Blaise. GiNERVa.” Ginny’s squeak of outrage followed him across the packed stadium foyer, up the stairs and all the way into the Minister’s box.
“I didn’t mean
Harry didn’t know what he and Malfoy were exactly. He just knew that their previously uncomplicated (and often drunk) hook-ups had, somewhere during the rushed gropes, quick wanks, and quiet fucks, grown into something awkward and hesitant, full of lingering stares and not-even-slightly-casual touches.
that all witches carry inside them. Impossible to extract without killing the subject, of course.
“We all know you’re squeamish.” She talked over the top of him. “But this is a serious infringement of school rules
“Fuck off, Malfoy.”
“Well…” Words, where were words? “Office comradery is invaluable and…” Draco gave up looking for words and instead concentrated on closing his mouth.
Volunteer? Harry’s head spun. Oh, no, not in this fucking millenium. He looked around wildly trying to find an escape, but his only option seemed to be a doorway decorated with pink plastic and foam to make it look like a vagina. Everyone who'd gone through the doorway so far had been crying when they came back out and it was too late, anyway. Cormac was advancing, his strong hand curling around Harry’s bicep, and, in no time, Harry was being dragged to the stage with the words, “Tits out and abs tight, Haz. Time to load that bar and just do it..”
Harry abandoned the shadows, and strutted up to the main gate. The guards immediately took notice of the short human being garbed in a completely black plague doctor's outfit. They didn't quite know how to address someone breaking into the prison, and Harry's stature caught them off guard. Cautiously they placed their hands on their firearms.
-////-
His mind raced to discern some explanation or possibility. The bittersweet taste of the food and water made sense now. Harry managed to calm himself down to think properly, and reached into his core for his magic. It floundered and slipped in his grasp, as if it were a water balloon coated in oil. He couldn't pin it down and allow it to flow. Anxiety crept back into his mind, flooding with terror over not having his magic to defend himself as planned.
He stalked the aisles and the racks of clothes, examining masks and cloaks, etc. After approximately 10 minutes, he found something that he fell in love with.
"Why so worried now? You didn't seem too concerned the last time I approached you about his safety." Her irritation pricked at the edge of her voice.
The next blow followed swiftly, striping across his shoulder and face. Then his legs. The pain made his muscles spasm, he couldn't curl up his body anymore. His torso was exposed, opening him up to a more furious barrage of blows. His cries rang through the whole house, the pale boy tried crawling away. Another mistake, he was slow, and moving on his belly exposed his backside. The mountain of flesh struck him again and again across his back, thighs, and buttocks. Every place he could conceivably be struck with a belt suffered injury.
Harry darted around the corner of the house, and saw his chance. There was an ivy riddled lattice fence on the side of the house, there was no way the larger boys could follow him up, he would be safe on the roof. Sadly, he would never have the chance to take the roof as a haven. He was weak and small, this made it hard to climb. Dudley and his gang had enough time to reach the lattice before Harry could reach the top. Too bad Ol' Dudders had a wad of fat in place of his brain, as he bagan to try and follow his cousin. A bad move on his part, as he was only a few feet up (shaking the lattice quite a bit as he got there, making Harry's own climb all the more difficult) when the whole structure began to tilt away from the house. Dudley's fall was so small his rotund form managed to land on it's feet. Harry was not so fortunate.
She was simultaneously surprised and annoyed to find Dumbledore in her classroom once again. He was facing a window, quite dramatically. His wrinkled and weathered hands clasped behind his back.
In his sleep he had nightmares about Vernon, and about being left by close friends he didn't have. He had woken up multiple times in the night, feverish and in tears. One thing that perturbed him above all else, was the dream he had.
Harry narrowed his eyes behind his mask. "Be as quick as possible. Do nothing other than retrieve that list."
On instinct his magic lashed out, and grasped the disc in the air; it remained there, suspended, Harry's hand extended towards it. Suddenly, a cold wash flooded the kitchen. The hairs on the back of the obsidian haired child stood on end.
A voice stirred him from his trance.
She hissed, her coils tightening around Harry's leg.
"Coming!" Came a tired sounding response, followed by a hurried shuffling to the door. The brown haired head of Lupin poked through, his face tired and slightly flustered. "Yes?"
He slowly sat up, nausea rushed into him, but it was managable. He took the glass of water, and inspected it. It was crystal clear, pristine. He took a small sip, no abnormal flavours to speak of.
Harry froze, he'd nearly forgotten about the strange way that the assault had suddenly stopped. He never thought about why they stopped, not that he had been given the chance. He was barely conscious until a moment ago, so all in all, not a lot of time given to reflect on that situation.
His bonds snapped apart, startling Vernon, who flinched at the sound. He stared wide eyed as Harry slowly pushed himself into a kneeling position, glaring at him with molten fury.
"What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck!" He looked at Harry, terror in his eyes. "How- Who the fuck are you?"
And with that, she was gone. A cracking noise went off like a silenced pistol. Which was loud, but not so much as to alert the entire neighbourhood. Harry was left with one question among the others that had spiralled into his head.
He became a little too absorbed in his thoughts as he came upon the entrance to what he thought was his alley. He only barely realised anything was different until he tripped over a pile of trash that hadn't been there before. He fell clumsily over it.
The woman inhaled sharply, questions filled her mind as she continued.
Slowly, his green, gemstone like eyes turned toward the entryway.
The bespectacled woman didn't know how to respond, she couldn't exactly rebuke his words without displaying desperation. She huffed quietly, and crossed her arms loosely. Her posture verges on defeated. She closed her eyes and mulled over what had just happened. Perhaps this should be taken as a small victory? This thought crossed her mind before she opened her eyes to see Albus patiently staring at her, subtle, yet victorious smile just barely visible beneath his long grey facial hair.
Dudley's droogs chuckled at the jest. Harry's readyness to run was all that kept him from rolling his eyes in such a way that if they were bowling balls they would surely get him a strike. That is to say, he was extremely unimpressed. He was also extremely fucking scared. Harry saw the other boys very obviously begin shift their weight to begin the impending chase. Harry took off as if he'd just heard a starting pistol, and he was going for gold. Except in this case, gold simply meant escaping his tormentors relatively unharmed.
"How do you know my name?" He asked, a wave of scenarios and explanations raced through his head most of which involving magic in some way. Though what he really wanted to know was why she knew his name. He'd only recently discovered his magic and doubted that outside of being able to speak with snakes he wasn't terribly remarkable. Really, what strange perverted reason would this woman be stalking him for?
The only reason they knew of her at all was because of Delphinium's ability to sense the magics of others. She had found it suspicious that the same magic kept appearing nearby every other day, in the same place and almost at the exact same time. She had heard stories of human magic users that could transform into animals, it was her theory that this cat may be one such magic user. Lending credit to this explanation was the fact that the feline had a much larger magical presence than any normal animal she'd encountered. It came very close to Harry's own presence and power, this cats magic felt like it was fortress. As if the magic were stones in a nigh unbreechable wall, strong and unyeilding. Yet behind that fortress it softened, feeling like the love of a parent.
So far he'd had the most success with items about the size of a large drinking glass. The bespectecled boy found large objects to be the easiest to move, he had discovered that mass had a very minimal impact on his ability. And their surface area meant that he needn't be quite so accurate with his targeting. Targeting happened to be the most prominent obstacle, as "grabbing" anything at all was comparable to having a third hand that just so happened to be invisible, and his sense of moving this invisible apendage was somewhat inverted compared to his corporeal and visible hands. It didn't help that the "hand" as he imagined it, was almost entirely disembodied. It felt similar to having a helium balloon taped to the inside of your sternum, yet it sprouted out of every point of your skin at once.
He couldn't very well have a heart to heart talk with the man. The young boy couldn't even ask for a drink of water without fear of being yelled at. There was always something threatening about the man whenever something involved Harry. The young wizard held out his hand from his body, he reached down into his core and let magical energy flow into his fingers. He focused on a specific abstract aspect of the magic, suddenly, flames were dancing along his fingertips and knuckles. Magic was a potential solution. But only as a defense. Even then, it wasn't the greatest option. His control over his magic was so limited, even as he practiced these past 4 years. His connection to the fire wavered and he cut the flow before something disastrous and unpredictable happened.
McGonagal leaned back into her chair, her nerves buzzing with relief and elation. Not only was Harry safe, but he was with Remus. That, and now she could operate while leaving Dumbledore unaware of her schemes. She still had to be careful, a single misstep and they could be discovered.
"No enchantments placed by a single witch could possibly protect him more than the combined talents of magic users throughout history. There is no way, not a chance in hell." She crossed her arms, why did the wizard have so much faith in Lily's abilities?
He glared at the wall in front of him, eyes fixed at the hole through which his serpent used to enter his miniscule abode. She was far too large now, her body was the diameter of an American football. Several times larger than the small rodent sized entryway. So, for a couple years now he slept entirely alone. No longer able to depend on the loving comfort of Delphi when he woke up from his nightmares.
He held up his hand again, and snapped. The homeless man's left leg spasmed as a muffled cracking sound emitted from said limb, Harry had just broken his femur. He slowly repeated the process with each major bone in all four limbs. At one point Charles lost consciousness, Harry jolted him awake by bumping the man against the wall, only enough to hurt. The man groaned intensely as his injuries were agitated.
Harry needed to know how this magic worked, he needed to know how it functioned. How best to access it, so that he could use it to achieve his ends.
Though bleary and exhausted, one question immediately popped into the emerald eyed boy's head.
"Come here!" Growled the dirty man, baring his teeth.
"How do you know about the killing curse? I thought you'd only discovered magic recently."
"Har- Harry, what have you done?"
"I want to be able to terminate our current relationship personally, to say goodbye for the time being."
Harry stored this information away for later, rifling through the wallet to find an ID card and about one hundred pounds. He stored the latter away in his pocket, and replaced the wallet with Crocker's ID in the interior breast pocket after wiping his fingerprints from everything he touched. He had heard enough crime shows in the background as he did chores to know about such things.
She didn't turn back to look at him. He sank to his knees, and looked sadly as she turned a corner and was gone. He couldn't process what had just happened, his forehead wrinkled, his mouth hung agape. The obsidian haired boy felt a tightness in his chest.
"I am going to lower my hand so that it does not escape, yes?"
The same fog clouded his consciousness as he regained it. Harry was only cognizant enough to realise that he was no longer in his cupboard. The walls of this new location were covered completely in white plastic sheeting. The raven attempted to push himself into a sitting position, only to find his hands bound behind his back. There was only enough clearance for him to lie flat. His feet and legs were bound together also, only enough for him to spread his knees a bit wider than his shoulders. Harry shuddered, he noticed that he was not currently clothed. Everything laid bare.
"Do you smoke mister? Or do you want your pen back?"
The man looked sad for a moment, before a small smile returned to his scarred face. "Needed something to occupy myself with while on the road. Besides, some songs remind me of old friends."
"Hmm." Acknowledged Harry, thoughtfully. He imagined the man spending time in libraries, studiously practicing notes and chords. Playing through practice scales and such. He absently combed his fringe over his scar, which almost seemed to catch the gentleman's eye.
After the first twenty minutes of spreading fertilizer over one of the flower beds Harry had made the decision to talk to the mysterious cat that lurked around his reluctant residence. He stopped manipulating the nitrogen enriched mulch and wiped his brow with his shirt. After a quick look at his surroundings, he made off toward the wall where the cat was inconspicuously lazing about with her tail wagging slowly and rythmicly. She startled as she felt him come near, her head snapping up when he approached her for the first time ever. She made no move to run away, he may have thought she was just a friendly stray.
"Help me to the front room, please." Harry said, Remus couldn't decipher whether it was a demand or a request. There was a hint of bitterness behind the otherwise neutral tone of his voice. Harry felt humiliated, having to be coddled by some stranger. He didn't want to be saved. He didn't want to place his trust in this man he barely knew.
Lupin's face was pale, and he started to sweat. At that moment he looked at the television to see footage of Harry doing endless magic effortlessly. It dawned on him that Harry hadn't just accidentally used magic in defense.
Vernon was dead.
Harry then acted more out of instict than thought. With a few movements of his hands, the entire ceiling collapsed in a strip behind him. A cloud of dust and large hunks of rubble and debris rained onto the floor and walkways. Then a series of cells opened on the opposite side of the curtain of damage. Harry continued to flee toward where he had originally entered, as prisoners spilled out of their cells and made a charge for the platoon.
Instructing Harry turned out to be an amazingly easy task, especially considering he did not have a wand. But outside of teaching him, it was a difficult experience. Scheduling and secrecy were hard to work out. She tried to mostly work with him on weekdays, on account of the other male occupants of the house were at school and work respectively. Meaning that they only had the attention of one person to avoid. But this came with the consequence of needing a decoy to stand in for her at Hogwarts.
There was a sound like metal hitting brick to his right. He turned to see two wires laying across the floor, leading to the shaking held Razer gun in an officers hand. The man wrapped his digits around the handle of his pistol and prepared to pull it out.
Harry was sat in the garden, as usual. He patiently awaited the arrival of McGonagal while he completed his gardening duties, Delphi wrapped around his torso. They hissed quietly to each other, about what new magics the raven would be introduced to that day.
He found that the establishment was run by a man and his wife, both from the colonies. He assumed that at some point they decided to move to the UK from the states, and open a restaurant serving their home cuisine. A lot of it looked very interesting, either cooked on a griddle or fried in hot oil.
Harry shook his head a bit, prompting a questioning look from the man carrying him. The glassy, green eyed child didn't want to allow himself to sympathize with Remus. He couldn't risk it. So much could go wrong.
He quickly gathered his composure, as if it hadn't ever broken. "Well, with that, I'll be returning to my other duties." He walked to the door as he said this. As he placed his hand on the doorknob to her classroom, he turned his head back to look at her.
Harry sputtered and sniffed through the words, burying his face deeper into her body. The snake felt herself being hugged closer to Harry's warm body.
He gave in and quenched his dry throat. He didn't realise how thirsty he was until he began drinking. He finished the glass in several large gulps.
hissed the snake
He opened his eyes again to find his mask being removed, still in the street from the lights. He was in the arms of a vaguely familiar blur. He didn't remember the rest of what happened.
"Wait a minute, I haven't even got your name!"
The raven's body stiffened to stone when the plastic that lined the wall rustled to his left. Vernon shuffled in through the curtains, he himself was also naked. His round, flabby body flustered in the dim light above them. The plastic crinkled beneath his feet as he walked toward Harry saying, "So you're finally awake, mongrel."
"You play beautifully!" Harry said as he hurried away. The man seemed startled, but continued to play his music. As Harry glanced back, he caught the man's eye once more, before turning and rushing to round the corner.
"What in hell are you doin', you lit-" Vernon's question was cut short by a sudden pressure around his throat. He pressed his own hands to the spot, trying to pry away at invisible hands. He kicked and struggled for breath, watching Harry slowly peel the tape away from his face. His lips were twisted into a scowl, eyes almost glowing with rage.
Looking at price tags, he found he would have to work a little more to be able to comfortably afford an entire outfit. He decided to wait until that evening to put on another show, when the streets were filled with people hurrying home after a busy day. Until that time came, he continued to walk about.
Vernon dragged Harry to the hall near the stairs, the boy prepared to be tossed cruely into his "room." He was unfortunately surprised by the walrus' next actions.
Looking in the mirror, he could tell that no amount of hair potion in the world could fix the state of disarray of his wavy blonde hair, so he decided to jump in the shower.  Another thing about Malfoy Manor; the water was either scalding or freezing.  Draco had tried many times to warm or cool the water with some spells he had read about in one of the books in Father’s library during the hours he spent studying for Hogwarts. No matter how hard he concentrated, nothing ever brought the water temperature and his preferences to a state of concord.  Draco consummated his shower by slicking his hair back the way Father liked.
Harry pulled out a drawstring bag, his carefree tone unburdened by pecuniary factors, held it out for the witch and said, “We’ll take the lot.”   Draco had a feeling he and Harry would get along swimmingly.
Merlin, Harry, I’d think you of all people would know why we don't use his name.  After what he did to your—”
“What do you mean, they’re horrible?”  Draco had a sudden moment of realization, “Is that why you don’t have any pictures of your family?”
“I dunno.  The Muggles can’t, ‘s against the law.”
and Draco was running, Father pushing the trolley in front of him.  Draco closed his eyes right before he was about to hit the barrier between Platforms Nine and Ten, and just when he expected to shatter his shoulder against brick, Draco felt like he was going through a curtain of mist.
“Slytherin’s my family’s house.  I want it so that I can prove that not all of them are bad.”  Ronald’s expression startled him.  “What?”
“Pansy, you know I don’t care to look at girls.  I just want to pass Transfiguration, which is why we’re going to the library.  Maybe we should focus on that.”
“We met when Hagrid brought me my letter and took me to Diagon Alley for my school things,” Harry explained, “He’s the one who got me Hedwig, my owl.”  Before Draco could ask why the giant man had brought Harry his letter and why he hadn’t just received an owl, Hagrid was yelling again.
“I think that’s Professor McGonagall.  She’s Head of Gryffindor, I think.”
“Yes, Draco, what he did was depraved, but doesn’t it just make everyone more afraid of him if you can't even
When the Sorting Hat called out “HUFFLEPUFF”, the whole table stood up, cheering and clapping.
A witch with a snack trolley came along and asked if they wanted anything.  Draco only had a couple sickles in his bag at the moment, so he bought a pumpkin juice and two chocolate frogs.
The ceremony went on, names being called at random, until “Draco Malfoy!”
“Now, let the feast begin,” said Dumbledore after a while, and with a wave of his wand food appeared on the tables.  More food than Draco had ever seen.  It was delicious.
“SLYTHERIN!”
“I dunno, I just thought it was some idiosyncrasy of Hagrid’s, not some wizarding fiat—”
Harry nodded thoughtfully.  “Well, the ones I live with are horrible, but they’re not all like that.  Most Muggles are just regular people, I suppose.  I don’t know many wizards to compare them to.”
Harry looked rather embarrassed and responded, “Well, yeah, what else would I call him?  George?”
“Mother,” Draco muttered, “pull yourself together.  I won’t even be gone that long.  I’m coming home for Christmas, remember?  It’s no big deal.”  In truth, he was nervous about being gone from his mother and his home for so long, but he had to stay cool in from of Mother.  He didn’t want her to worry any more than she had to.
“It’s called a fridge.  What else would we keep our food in?  It would go bad on the counter.”
“OI!  ALL FIRS’-YEARS COME ‘ERE!  WE’VE GOTTA GET ON THE BOATS ‘FORE THEY LEAVE US!  Come on, let’s go Harry, Harry’s friends.”  Hagrid almost effortlessly garnered the attention of the mass of children with the volume of his voice.
“May I sit with you?”  Draco was surprised at how timid his voice sounded.
“Don't say it!”  Draco interrupted.  “Harry, don’t say it, alright?  Please.”  Draco shifted uncomfortably at the thought of hearing Harry say the Dark Lord’s name again.  The name of the man his father held as a god, his father who was now living in ignominy for having been a follower of.
It’s an odd name, isn’t it? Vold—”
Herbology was much the same as Charms, with a lecture about the merits of growing magical and non-magical plants and the properties of some common ones.  Harry’s face went bright red when Professor Sprout, a very short and very round woman, awarded five more points to Slytherin for Harry being “such an attentive student”.
The Slytherin table exploded.  Draco was ecstatic. He ripped that nasty hat off his head and ran as fast as he could to sit with his new housemates, a smile plastered across his face.  Everybody was patting him on the back and punching his arms, congratulating him.
“No, thank you.  I was just on my way to see the rest of the train.  I’m Hermione, by the way.  Hermione Granger.”  She stuck her hand out for each boy to shake, and each said his name as they shook hands.  “It was a pleasure meeting you all,” she said a little too enthusiastically, and she turned and walked down the hall in the opposite direction she came from.   Draco knew that if he was up against her to be considered the brightest wizard in his year, he’d have to have quite the stratagem.
Draco followed Harry through the common room, past a notice that said there would be a meeting that night for all first-years with the prefects, and up through the castle to the Great Hall.
“A stasis charm, of course!  Though I don’t know how to do it.  That’s the House Elves’ job, of course.  What are the Muggles like?  Are they horrible, like Father says?”  Draco hoped Harry said they weren’t, if only because it would mean Father was wrong.
” Ronald screamed, his voice emphasizing the exigency of the boy’s presence.  “I’VE BEEN SPEAKING TO
“An’ here we are, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”  Draco could tell by the pride in Hagrid’s voice that he saw the school as hallowed ground.
The older male's genital area erupted into flames. He attempted to writhe and scream as fire incinerated the clothing covering that area and made it's way to the sensitive organs held therein. Harry felt an indescribable sense of euphoria as he watched the man in agony, flesh bubbled and seared as it burned into organic slag. He felt momentarily tempted to release his grip on Charles' throat, just to hear him wail and scream. He held onto his resolve though, not wanting to risk any attention from anyone who could be walking down the street.
He knew full well that he couldn't simply break into a prison wearing his street clothes, or show his face. Especially considering he was definitely a wanted person. He'd murdered his uncle after all. Harry remembered a shop that sold costumes a few blocks away. He would gather what he needed from there.
"Shut 'im up!" One of the other boys said, he didn't want to draw too much attention.
"You didn't say how you learned, mister." Harry chided.
Harry's voice shook as he said, "Vernon."
Harry didn't know what to think. Possibilities upon possibilities swarmed through his head like angry hornets. He could go anywhere? Do anything? He had been with the Dursleys his entire life, this house was all he knew. These people, they gave him everything he had. Not that he was grateful, they took almost as much from him as they gave. They couldn't even be bothered to feed him enough, he was wire thin compared to Dudley, who seemed to get rounder and larger every week. Leaving. It would mean freedom. Absolute freedom.
As Harry elaborated the light seemed to spark in her eyes as she understood.
He had transfigurwd several objects, levitated several more, and summoned fire in his hands. At one point he did a short dance with Delphi, pretending to be a snake charmer. By the end of the hour, the sun was nearly finished setting, and his crowd has dispersed, heading home to their families and pets. His performance had accrued a bit over 40 pounds!
It was settled. The moment that aggression prone pile of lard made his move, Harry and Delphi were gone.
"I'll tell you in a moment." Harry said, his voice possessing a defensive bite. McGonagal gazed forward once more, understanding that this was not an easy subject. They kept walking in silence, McGonagal's curiosity grew as she heard Harry making just barely audible noises of exertion.
"Such as?" Asked Dumbledore, a cold look on his face. As if he were looking for some discrepancy in her actions or words.
"Oh, yes. Well over the years I read some books, and learned from teachers where I could. Practiced a lot. Pretty similar to most who play, I would say."
"Yes harry?"
Remus looked shocked, and his face grew sad. "I- I didn't know. I sympathise with you, but what has that got to do with any of this?"
He felt as if his chest were being crushed underneath the weight of a car. The pain was sharp and dull at the same time, his chest cavity felt like a vacuum; a cold, empty sensation permeated his body. The grass beneath his knees seemed to sag from his weight, nearly giving way to dark cavernous depths. He felt all alone again.
"He- he- he beat me. With a belt." Tears began to stream from his eyes. The glasses wearing woman felt her heart drop.
The young boy wanted to see if his assailant could be useful before he was absolutely dismantled. So he searched the old man's pockets, hoping to find a wallet, or even some pocket money. He found the former within an interior pocket on the breast of the jacket, along with some curious crumpled documents.
"Lupin. Remus Lupin."
Harry opened his eyes at the sound of shattering crockery. His pupils contracted and focused on what used to be a flower pot. Now in it's place was a litter of red dust and shards of brick colored debris. His eyes were wide with absolute astonishment. A smile crept up on his face, giddyness rose within him as if he were a child on christmas morning and there was a sizable pile of gifts beneath the tree. His smile faltered, and fell flat.
Remus seemed to shrink a little. "I understand, Harry. I don't want to push it, but I hope you can come to let me in some day." He started walking toward Harry, who flinched. "Relax, I just wanted to give you food."
"Before I take this sheet, do not be scared, under it lies my assistant!" He pulled it of in a wide motion, revealing Delphi beneath it in a coil. A woman gasped, the man next to her put his hand over his mouth.
Mcgonagall stared at Albus Dumbledore, incredulity showed plainly on her face. The moment she reappeared at Hogwarts she'd virtually attacked him in his office with inquiries on what he planned to do, along with a much more concerned and furious version of "I told you so." She knew for a fact that putting Harry in that environment would result in his being abused. The only part she was wrong about was the level that the abuse would be at, which was to say, much worse than she'd ever imagined. She hadn't known sooner because, well, you can only discern so much information on a child's situation from afar.
"What's wrong, Professor?" His brow knit together, he hasn't seen her like this yet. She didn't speak for a moment, electing to simply stare at him as if he were barely there. A fight unfolded behind her eyes. Suddenly her expression hardened, she looked stern, but hints of pain flickered in her face.
"I'm headed out, I hope you will be ok on your own for a while?" The lycanthrope inquired.
"You still don't understand. You couldn't understand. It didn't happen to you."
"Lookin fer these?" The fat one held something in Harry's face. His glasses. He made a weak attempt to swipe them away, but they were pulled out of his reach too quickly for him to register at the moment.
Harry felt the numbness fade into a smoldering hot ball in his chest as he watched Vernon sit there in his ecstasy, covered and sweat, slouching lazily whilst sitting on the floor. Harry's emerald eyes squinted and twitched with fury and shame, magic flooded through his veins like a tsunami.
Harry was curious, there was a mark? He, Harry Potter, had used magic (unbelivable) to throw his attackers away and carve a mark into the dirt (also unbelievable). Yeah, sure. Magic and talking snakes can't be real.
Thank you all, and I'll hopefully be seeing you guys in a couple weeks.
-////-
He headed off on his way, disappearing down the street, humming a meandering tune to himself. Harry knew that man wasn't trust worthy, as kind and eccentric as he seemed, there was some whisper of insincerity that crept through to Harry's intuition. The fact that he was a wizard, and that he was looking for his teacher were also warning signs.
He marveled at the virtual mountain of food in front of him. He doubted he could finish it all, but he decided to dig in. He tackled the waffles first, occasionally taking bites of the fried chicken. It was delicious, the waffles had a crispy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. The combination of the sugar and the syrup added a delectable layer of sweetness. The chicken was also amazing, sweet and tender thigh meat coated in a crispy and crunchy exterior. The breading was flavourful, tasting of rosemary, thyme, and dill.
Special tools? Does she mean...
"Lupin... I'll be seeing you, maybe. Have a nice day." Harry waved as he wandered in the general direction of his alley. He looked distractedly through shop windows as he walked, conceptualising new magic tricks for that evening.
Hey guys, I just wanted to give an update to say that this fic is going on hiatus for a while. Hopefully not more than a couple weeks, but we will see. Do not fear though, I wont be abandoning this fic anytime soon. Too many hours of work have gone into it.
Shots of the destroyed cell block panned across the screen, and clips of interviews with officers and other staff intermittently interrupted confused takes of the carnage. Censored pictures of injured officers and the bodies of Harry's various fatalities popped up. In the corner, a kill count hovered. It was separated into multiple categories: prisoner fatalities, officer fatalities, prisoner casualties, and officer casualties.
Harry explained, he seemed excited.
"Checking on his condition? Is that all?" The old man inquired, clearly suspicious.
The masked child looked around the room, a few people in suits cowered on the floor. One of them stood out, a man wearing wireframe glasses, his nametag read "Lead Records Associate," along with his name: Bernard. Harry spoke to his serpent.
Even his hair seemed to lose it's attitude, laying across his scalp and on the floor in a more messy and unkempt fashion than his usual handsomely tousled locks. It was greasy, but lacked shine. It's volume was reduced to the point of almost being manageable.
The costumed boy ran even harder, hoping to outrun whoever may still be pursuing him. He managed to reach the front doors, running out into the expanse between the complex and the perimeter fence. He got around 10 meters from the building before he felt a terrible pain in his leg almost instantly following by a deafening bang. He tumbled to the ground, and looked at the prison.
Soon he noticed that he was getting extremely tired, and his nausea was not extending beyond only being caused by pain. He felt faint, and lightheaded. His head began to throb.
"Yes, miss." Harry suddenly threw his arms around the older woman, surprising her. She smiled and held him closer. Soon she sent him home, and returned to Hogwarts to confront Dumbledore once more.
"The hell kind of name is Mcgonagall?"
"Well, yer not gonna get 'em! Not 'til we grind your sorry ass to paste." Harry saw Dudley toss his glasses haphazardly behind him. The specs made a light noise as they fell into the packed grass a few feet away. The pressure on his leg increased. A grimmace sprang onto the visually impaired child's face, tears built up in his eyes and dripped down his ears and into the grass. Harry let out an agonized scream as he felt his leg snap audibly at the joint.
He pushed his glasses up his nose. "Simple really, cease all contact with Harry potter until it comes time for him to start his schooling as Hogwarts."
Delphinium fantasized, she was slowly but surely getting bigger. She had shed her skin a few days ago, leaving Harry with a translucent Delphi shaped husk to admire. This explained her ever increasing appetite.
Mcgonagall held her tongue at that. She needed to tread more carefully now.
Harry thought for a moment. He didn't really know what love entailed. He hadn't ever really experienced it. So, he said what he imagined love to be.
His tone verged on begging, so she complied. They laid there, quiet for several moments. Harry was the first to break the silence.
-////-
She spotted her son nearby (not a hard feat honestly, he would be recognizable from a kilometer away) and her anger all but dissapated. Her motherly instincts brimmed and she ran to fuss over his (oh so very minor in comparison to Harry's) injuries. Once she realized that the walking blob of adipose tissue that was her son was just shy of unharmed, she ran to her sisters child. Petunia's rage reappeared in a flash boil, as she roughly grabbed the critically injured boy and ignoring his groans of agony dragged him into the house and threw him into his cupboard.
The open window behind Dumbledore let air gently circulate through his office. The currents so gentle they didn't perturb the flame of the candle fully illuminating the parchment before him, until suddenly a gust of wind sent the flame sputtering slightly more. The old man listened intently, the flapping of wings told him of an incoming message.
Her confusion was evident in her voice as she said,
The tears began to flow more heavily now, Harry sobbed and drew his knees to his chest and hugged his legs. McGonagal crawled closer to him, and put her arms around him. He stiffened for a moment, before relaxing and leaning into her. Only now did she see the faint bruises covering his skin. Her blood boiled at the thought of that man harming a child as he did. She could only imagine how bad it must have been to cover his skin so completely, for him to have trouble walking days later.
Harry thought, honestly, you probably would have to be if you started hearing snakes talk as if most humans couldn't even comprehend words. And then to go on about how snake talkers made friends with snakes because they did magic.
Now he was standing several feet from the doors, heavy duty, electronically activated. He focused his magic on the door, letting build, and build, and build. He allowed it to feel as if it were about to lose control, before releasing it at the door. The blast was deafening, Harry had to cover his ears. Even still, his ears were left ringing. He looked forward through the doorway, seeing no one injured by his little explosion.
"Well, Harry, care to explain? What happened?"
"Things?" Harry queried. "What kind of things?"
Excitement crept onto his face, mixed with a considerable amount of vengefulness.
"But fear not, I've found him. He's in poor form, very poor. Though he's alive, and safe, for the time being. He's been through much abuse, at the hands of those who were supposed to protect him. He has surprising control over his magical abilities. I think that Dumbledore is aware of what Harry was suffering, how could he not?"
Harry looked at his leg, in the dark he could hardly see his blood darkening the cotton of his pants even further. Pain hit him again in a wave, he nearly screamed as he attempted to put weight on it. He spoke to Delphi.
Harry stared at the list in his leather gloved hands, each of the few dozen felons was listed in cell order. He would be able to do this quickly, and efficiently. He had to anyway, if he wanted to get out of here. He had no doubt that there were more entrances somewhere else along the block.
His eyes sparkled with that familiar cunning. "If you're so concerned about him, as to leave Hogwarts in the middle of lessons, it may actually be worth my direct intervention. I should visit him myself, see what he is getting up to." His tone had just a hint of his self satisfaction.
-////-
"The... killing curse? I thought that it left no marks! How could it have scarred me even if I did survive? Actually, how did I survive? None of this makes sense!"
"A man at the drugstore forgot it on the counter today, thought it might come in handy."
"Depends, where did ya get that cigar, kid?"
"I have had everything taken from me! Everything. I never had a home. I never had a family. Nobody loved me. I didn't even know who I was until I was six, and even that was taken from me!" Tears streamed down his face.
He needed someone. He wanted love. He crave acceptance. Maybe he could find it. Not in a person, but something else.
There were mainly restaurants and cafés in this town, along with a few petrol stations, and various other service providers. Some flats were also nearby, within walking distance of his alley. A couple of times he stopped by the front windows of shops that sold food, looking longingly at their goods. He hadn't eaten or drank anything since last evening, when he had been drugged. Thinking about it made him nauseous, and he craved to erase the taste of it from his mouth.
Harry and the serpent traveled until they couldn't that night, taking care to stay off of main roads, and remaining in the shadows. The young wizard knew Petunia would call the police, he heard sirens soon after he made his escape. He traveled as fast as he could, but both Delphi and his violated rear end made swiftness impossible. He couldn't keep track of where or how long he was traveling, every second felt like an eternity. His body was all but numb, which made it easier for him to endure the endless trek.
His excuse for classifying the event was that he wanted to prevent panic and hysteria in the wizarding world. Minerva suspected that he was simply trying to preserve his own ego. It had already bean bruised quite heavily within the upper government level, he struggled to maintain his influence. If word reached the public that the Boy Who Lived was missing, Dumbledore's image would be unsalvagable.
The complex wasn't extremely large for a prison, but it was definitely a considerable amount of ground to cover for a ten year old boy. He would have to infiltrate administration first, which he assumed would be nearby to the prisons main entrance.
Her mind raced to find a suitable explanation, and it begged the question as to why she hadnt done so preemptively. She couldn't let Albus win this battle of wills, she needed to beat him. Him and all that cunning that stormed behind those steely blue eyes. A thought occurred to her, she was never explicitly forbidden from seeing potter.
The snake said.
She slithered her way up his body, staring into his eyes.
"Alohomora!" He said, as he grabbed the handle. The door was slightly heavy, made entirely of steel. Entering and closing the door behind him, he looked around for something to blockade the door with. There were several desks that he tossed against the door in a pile.
"I've known your name since the day you were born." Said the guitarist, his tone hinted at bittersweet memories.
Harry reached for his magic on an impulse, and wildly lashed it outward. His assailant was thrown over Harry's head, toward the deeper end of the alley. Harry struggled slightly to his feet, panting. The raggedy man was laying on the ground, groaning and dazed.
Harry inquired.
He stomped toward the boy, belt still in hand; Harry no longer had the ability to attempt escape. A gigantic hand reached toward the mop of messy noir, and grasped it harshly. Vernon yanked the small boy down the hall to the cupboard, Harry almost screamed, and weakly raised his arms to grip the fatty digits pulling at his hair.
Harry walked up to her and crouched down, offering his arm for her to climb on. She made her way up the limb and made his shoulders her resting place. They felt something pass between them, The Raven shivered. He wasn't sure what had happened, but a deal had been made between them. Something deeper than a simple allignment.
"Can you help me? I can't seem to get up." The injured child asked sheepishly, a faint blush formed on his pallid cheeks.
Later that night, Harry was washing up the dishes in the kitchen. His hands red and pruning from the hot soapy water. He scrubbed at plates, and cookware. Everything had food crusted onto it from use. The load was astronomical since Vernon and Dudley ate enough food for a small family, each (If each member ate second helpings, along with dessert). Tonight's meal was especially difficult, French onion soup. All the cookware and serving vessels had cheese crusted and melted onto it, it loved to cling to the oven-safe ceramic. The brown, beefy broth nearly seared onto the sides of each ramekin. Jammy, caramelized bits of onion and their natural sugars refused to be removed from the large Dutch oven in which they had been cooked to a sweet, flavourful mass.
For the next few months the bespectacled boy would have nightmares, awaking every time in cold sweat, panicking wildly. In those nightmares, he dreamt of being abandoned by faceless people he felt he loved and cared for. When they faced him, he had that same crushing feeling as when McGonagal dismissed him. Eventually he became numb to them, waking suddenly, but laying there empty as tears flowed down his pallid cheeks. He continued to train his magic in secret, slowly getting more proficient at doing whatever he could imagine.
He didn't know where he was when he stopped. His bleary and exhausted eyes could only see that they were in the outer edges of a city. Light was beginning to creep its way over the horizon. He stumbled blindly into a nearby alleyway, collapsing into a pile of trash bags. He didn't remember losing consciousness.
So Harry stood before the wall, and prepared himself. Steeling his nerves and building up the magic within himself. He aimed his will at his target, and allowed the energy to rush forth with explosive force. It flew away into the hall in a cascade of bricks, shrapnel, and dust. This accompanied by a smattering of twisted metal and other structural elements. The hallway was filled with the echos of collapsing infrastructure, accompanied by screams and yells uttered by the several guards attempting to enter the records room.
Hissed Delphinium.
Tears streamed from his eyes, and the broken boy sobbed as much as he was able, without disturbing his bruised ribcage. Mucus dribbled from his nose, and spittle leaked from his mouth as he cried. What was wrong with him? What was so wrong with him that he deserved being beaten within an inch of his life with a belt? Why was his magic so vile, and disgusting to them?
He broke into a sprint to his first cell, running out of the prisoners reach. They were rioting in their cells, asking who Harry was, and what was happening. Some made ineffectual threats. All of them were standing pressed against the bars. He soon came upon his target, he didn't bother to read the name. He only cared about the prisoner ID, which was displayed both across the back and front of the prisoners uniform.
"Behold, there is no longer a pen! In it's place, a cigar!" Harry declared, lifting his hand to reveal a thick cigar. Now there was a tiny crowd watching his little play. A small chorus of gasps and "oooooooh's" ran through it.
Delphi slithered down from his torso, traveling down his leg and disappearing into a nearby brush. The woman stared at the empty space left by the serpent. She hadn't seen anything like it for a long time. His stomach was horribly distended, the snake had been able to fill the space so well that he looked normal until she'd left. His ribs were so apparent she could have counted them without needing to feel for them. Hell, he looked like a human xylophone. Now she took a closer look at his arms, they were extremely thin. His legs were no better, she almost couldn't fathom how he functioned. She was sure that he was unconsciously using magic just to stay upright. Then there was the bruising, a large amount of his skin was blotched with purple and red. Like his ribs had been broken. Is that why I stopped seeing him for a few days? She needed to talk to Dumbledore immediately, she could not believe he would leave this child in this environment. Bloodline wards be damned.
"No, you got that scar from the killing curse. Your parents were killed by the very same curse."
Seeing no sign of either potential danger, he dropped the vegetative matter into the steel pail that sat near him and stood. The raven made a silent flight to the site of his interest. Our bespectacled character of focus stopped dead in his light footed tracks. Several feet away there was a depression, already with the beginning of new grass buds sprouting from the dirt. It was easily four, maybe even five metres in diameter. The center of it was darker than the surrounding soil, almost as if it had been scorched. Like lightning had struck the spot.
Images of what he'd done to Vernon plagued him. His bruised throat. Mangled hands, a bloody pulp, with irregular bone fragments spread throughout, tendons twitching and pulling at nonexistent digits. Eviscerated and emasculated crotch. Bloody pulsating intestines spilling onto the cold, dirty concrete. The adipose tissue around it a dirty yellow, a myriad of clumps and bulbs. So much blood flowed slowly across the grey and brown floor of the dank basement.
"Yeah, what of it? You miss, are a witch. I think thats the more relevant part of this."
"I've been visiting Harry Potter, observing his condition," stated McGonagal.
Harry hadn't even bothered to count how many people he had murdered, whether by accident or with intent. It was made clear that they didn't differentiate between how or who the subjects had been injured or killed, though the intruder (Harry) was responsible for the majority of the victims. In total about 60 people had died, Harry assumed about 40 of those were a direct effect of his assault on the prison.
The bright red lettering that read "URGENT" filled her with dread. The alarm caused by the note wasn't something she needed, as Harry Potter had been missing for two weeks. The anxiety surrounding his disappearance had burst a vein in her eye, a rosey red splotch bordered the iris of her right eye. Her every nerve urged her to tell everyone around her of the news, but everything was being kept quiet. Dumbledore threatened her job when she had objected to the secrecy, it had become a habit of his, to threaten her at the slightest sign of rebellion. Slander, imprisonment, death. All sorts of things she couldn't risk him going through with.
The voice grew louder, but his torment continued. A very clear memory of his cheek being stroked so tenderly by that hulking mound of fat that posed as a man.
"That doesn't answer my question." Spat Harry, Remus was silent for a moment.
-////-
Remus turned to look at Harry, incredulous. "What the hell do you mean 'had to be done?' You murdered... well I don't even know how many people last night!"
"Oh, thank you." Harry cautiously took the plate, noticing that the food was only somewhat warm now. Remus walked toward the front of the flat, grabbing his guitar case along the way.
And with that, he was gone.
"Get back, you fools!" Harry screamed, throwing them away from the pile. The banging hadn't stopped, the desks were slowly but surely being moved away from the heavy steel door. Harry forced them back into place, looking around the room for more heavy objects to secure the entrance.
The older male's brow rose. "Friends? Interesting thing to be with a snake."
"Don't touch me!" Screamed Harry, flailing his hand in front of him. Remus felt himself being pushed back by an invisible force, sliding a couple meters back and falling onto his rear.
"What? No?" She almost yelled, incredulous. "How could you possibly not remove him from that place? He is suffering abuse, you should have seen the bruises. Children his age shouldn't react that way, days after any form of 'discipline.'"
Suddenly his remaining breath was thrust from his lungs as his back impacted the wall of his miniscule living space. The young one crumpled like a sac of bones, and moved no more. His skin was mottled purple and yellow all over is body, a variety of strips of many lengths.
There stood Vernon, still as a stone. Somehow his flabby lard bloated body seemed stiff and tight to the core. The fear and shock of having been caught shook Harry to his core, breaking his connection to his magic. The plate shattered on the floor.
She could sense the pain in his heart. She slithered closer.
"Harry..."
Professor McGonagal swallowed, there was no way she could escape this. "Can you grant me one thing, Albus?"
came a hissing sound from the boy's torso. Delphinium had taken to wrapping herself around Harry's stomach and chest when they weren't either outdoors or in his cupboard. It served to be a good hiding place for her, as Harry's malnourished frame and extremely loose clothing left plenty of room for her to lie almost unnoticable. She made him look almost like a healthy child wearing oversized clothes.
Come time to tend to the garden the sun was beginning to set, the dishes had taken him so long because each one was more crusty and disgusting than a homeless blokes diseased bleeding sphincter after getting rammed by a drug dealers HIV riddled cock for his next meth fix. Nor did it help that the two gargantuan pigs he had for an Uncle and Cousin ate about as much as a band of starving competetive eaters with free admission to an all you can eat buffet and that days special was a tables worth of the messiest foods you could imagine and none of them had the common courtesy of using the provided utensils to slop the stuff into their gaping gullets.
His excitement was contagious, she was anxious to hear what he wanted to do.
It's interior was similar to that of a 40's American diner, with cushy red leather booths, and chrome accents. Everything was colourful and had character. There were a few patrons also enjoying their first meal of the day, a family of four, an elderly couple, and the busker that inspired Harry the other day. He spent the short while simply absorbing his surroundings.
Once Harry had broken the bones he wanted to, he started on Crocker's teeth. Forcing open his mouth, and with a flick of his wrist, wrenching each individual tooth from it's socket. Blood was gushing from the new holes in the gums, the dark crimson fluid coated the molesters mouth with a copper like flavour.
"Aw, look at Potty, by 'imself in the dirt. Lookin' fer bugs to eat I bet. Like some dirty lil bird!"
He went to his alley that night hungry, but happy that he had found something to fill his pockets. No amount of money and magic could prevent him from having horrible nightmares, unfortunately. He slept through much torture that night. He never knew about the man that peered at him from the entrance to the alleyway momentarily, before disappearing into the night.
Harry turned to stare at his companion. His brow furrowed in thought, and disappointment.
Delphi said this, hoping to protect Harry from more pain at the hands of other humans, at least, any who could hurt him if trust were placed into them.
"How do you know my name?"
She almost seemed to grin mischeviously.
He tried to sit up, and grimaced at the soreness. Flashes of the Dursley's basement overwhelmed him. He curled up into a ball, cradling his head as the events of the previous night washed over him. He couldn't breathe, no matter how much air he sucked in. He could feel Vernon's hands wandering his body, fondling his buttocks and genitals. The alleyway warped between itself and the basement, the pristine, plastic sheets hung and spread all around. He felt that hot slick stuff pumping into his stomach.
It was the serpents turn to be suprised, him give her a name? Some emotion rose in her body, like she was happy to have been offered this thing she'd never had. Nor knew that she had wanted, at some low, unconscious level.
"Harry? Harry, I need you to focus on me."
Remus seemed surprised for a second before saying, "Oh, of course!"
Harry arched his back as he felt something slowly and agonisingly push its way into his rear. His entire body tightened and relaxed repeatedly with the pain of the intrusion. Nausea welled up in Harry's stomach, nearly causing him to vomit. He screamed ineffectually, the audio being muffled by the tape over his mouth.
Going to the owlry made her nervous, and she didn't have a personal owl. Then an idea occurred to her: why not use a student's owl? But then, who's owl? It had to be a dependable student, one she could trust. Someone smart, but not potentially devious like a slytherin. Bravery wasn't really a necessity, she could simply lie about the contents of the letter, and the likelihood of accidental revelation though lack of care was anxiety inducing. With Gryffindor out, she realised that hufflepuff was a bit too unpredictable, she couldn't be sure their loyalties would lie with her. Her use of their owl could spread through the house.
One of the guards he had taken out when he entered was conscious, and holding his gun, it's barrel pointed toward Harry. Anger boiled up into the raven's chest, and he flung his hand at the officer. The uniformed man was flung into the adjacent wall with such force that he left a red smear on it as he flopped lifelessly to the ground.
She was puzzled, and would have expressed it with her face if she could.
his scaled companion spoke. Harry gasped quietly and lept a short distance. He turned to face the serpent, still unsure whether or not he could believe what he was seeing and hearing.
Harry remembered a spell the witch had taught him all those years ago. He thought it could be perfect for this moment. He pointed his open hand at the sex offender, and spoke one word.
He never got an answer, as Harry quickly turned and ran to his next cell. He got very much the same reaction with each encounter. It was almost monotonous, running from cell to cell beheading those who ever dared touch a child sexually. He did this all while terribly aware of how many seconds closer he got to the resident police force storming the cell block.
Together, they stalked off into the night.
His green eyes scanned the sky, it appeared to be midmorning, a couple hours after sunrise. Most shops would be open by now.
Satisfaction and glee shined within his startlingly blue eyes. She knew that he was only doing this to torture her, to get an admission of guilt. He was enjoying watching her struggle with her thoughts, her words. A small,  sinister smirk played at the corners of the old man's mouth

"I need to go, I have urgent matters to attend to."
"You seem to underestimate the strength of a mother's love, Minerva." His blue eyes weren't so much as lazily gazing in her direction. Instead, they were staring with scrutiny upon the documents placed in front of him on his desk. He absently made scribbles and notations on the pages.
replied a tired voice off to his left.
His face was wet with tears, and now they flowed forth with increased fervor. She unraveled him from her coils and allowed him to hug her.
"Maybe I should even talk to him, ask about any shady characters."
Delphinium was surprised by those last words. It sparked something inside of her, a feeling she couldn't describe. It was warm, and light. Ironic, considering her cold blooded nature. She couldn't help but to return the sentiment.
Harry froze and stared at Lupin, sniffling, tears still flowing. "What do you mean? How do you know?"
With that she hopped off the wall, to the side walk on the other face of the wall. Harry hesitated a moment. He thought this may be the time to express a little more caution. But he soon followed as quickly as he could, which wasn't entirely fast considering he was a malnourished six year old who was also bogged down by the considerable weight of an 84 centimetre long serpent. There was also the issue of getting through the gate quietly, not an easy task as it rattled like a maracca at the slightest push when the chain link scraped over the side walk. He only opened it wide enough for him to make it through with little headway, he didn't want to squish Delphi.
Harry giggled. "A magician never reveals his secrets." While he acted relaxed toward the man, he remained guarded. His instincts told him to be wary, and not reveal anything about himself.
Though first, he needed to overcome the chain link fence bordering the perimeter of Thornwell. It was topped with razor wire, which eliminated climbing in its entirety. He supposed he would need to bend the fence to accommodate him.
As Remus carried the boy to the couch, Harry pondered last night. The interaction had felt rushed, and left a lot of questions. Remus' expository revelations felt odd, though he had probably been holding onto that weight for a long time.
The game was definitely up now, they both knew for sure of the other. The Cat looked around, making sure those bastard relatives weren't keeping watch. No one was, so she locked eyes with the green ones before her and flicked her tail. A gesture that he took as "follow me."
"No, no, I can make my own way, thank you." Harry said, scooting back and trying to get to his feet, but in a flash the man was on top of him. The young boy's hands were flailing, in an attempt to avoid being restrained.
"That is the safes possible place for Harry to reside until he has to begin his schooling. The enchantments placed by his mother made sure of that." His tone was assured, verging on arrogant.
A few weeks had passed, and Harry was busy washing dishes in the early afternoon. He'd been practicing his magic as much as he could, every solitary moment he had outside of his cupboard. Strangely (or not) he found himself with more time alone (with the obvious exception of Delphinium, whom he'd taken to occasionally calling Delphi) since Dudley hadn't gained back the nerve to provoke him. Regardless, progress was slow and tedious. He had much less trouble accessing his magic now, though he still struggled slightly. The most pertinent issue was controlling the flow, and getting it to behave as he wished. Which currently meant using his magic to move objects in whatever way he wanted.
Soon enough, a man dressed in robes walked casually down the sidewalk. Long grey hair, and a beard to match. He had a kind face, framed by a pair of half moon glasses, which aided steely blue eyes. Harry watched him intently out of the corner of his eye. Delphi had hidden herself among the flowers, she hissed quietly to Harry.
The man chuckled, "No worries, I'm only joking."

His knee bobbed with anxiety. More problems seemed to arise with every solution. Harry had to take a moment to comprehend what Delphi suggested next.
"Call it what you will, Minerva. I know what I am speaking of."
"You can speak to serpents?" It was more a statement than a question, but it demonstrated her suprise none the less. Harry fixed his gaze on her, his brow furrowed and a slight frown appeared on his face.
Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes, he felt as if Delphi was the only one he could trust at this point. Was it safe to let anyone else in?
The guitarist felt his heart break. He had been lied to. Harry wasn't safe in the Dursley place. Remus set the plate on a small table beside the sofa. He had wondered where all of those scars had come from, he attempted to extend a hand toward the boy.
But what would he do? He didn't have an instrument, much less the skill to play one. He wondered what talents he could put on display, something he could entertain with. He relayed his thoughts to Delphi, who was attempting to sunbathe in the back of the alley, where some warm gilded sunlight managed to peek through the light grey cloud cover.
"What are you doing?" Inquired Harry, preparing to stop the man from performing some act of treachery. He hissed for Delphinium to strike if necessary, she reared up in response.
Hello, I'd really appreciate if you readers could comment your critiques about the story! Especially for the chapters from this point forward. I need to find my groove again, so the writing may be stylistically different from the previous four.
"Free-" his command was interrupted by his sudden collision with the wall behind him.
Throughout the exchange the newly revealed witch watched with suprise and a hint of horror. Harry was a parselmouth?
Remus expression changed to that of deep sadness, his forehead wrinkled, brows furrowing, and his mouth formed into a frown. "Unfortunately you're wrong there, Harry. I know exactly what that is like. It's horrible, and I have to live with it every single day."
"Grading assignment, planning lessons. My normal duties, what else?" Her face maintained its stern, gentle look. Except her eyes glinted with an air of innocence.It wasn't exactly a lie, those were things she needed to tend to. But it was a lie in that, those weren't things she planned to do tonight. What she really planned to do was plan her schedule for teaching Harry in secret, regardless of whether or not she or anyone else was granted permission to train him.
his serpenting friend repeated
His voice was panicked and laboured.

"She's an older woman, but much younger looking than me, I assure you. Wears glasses, very pretty face. Sharp features. Grace of a cat I'd say, when she walks." He talked about her as if she were a good friend. At the mention of cat-like grace, Harry almost tensed up. He had to remain calm, and not express anything that could tell the man he knew the woman he spoke of.
The sounds of muffled crying emenated from an unassuming cupboard underneath the stairway of one number 4 Privet Drive. The contents of said cupboard, a milk crate which itself contained several mostly empty bottles of now curdling milk, some uselessly thin blankets, large amounts of dust and insects, and the source of the traumatized screams: a child. Harry Potter sported a very recent addition to his sweet, innocent face, an angry and lightning shaped gash that ran down his forehead. The gash still had pinpricks of blood beginning to bead in the deep crevices of marred flesh.

Harry had returned to the alleyway  and was speaking to Delphi. He figured now he was ready to talk about what had happened to him with Vernon. His retelling was stressful, and emotional. Tears began to flow from his eyes in the middle of his story. Delphi expressed her condolences and love to Harry, and vowed to never let that happen to him again. She also expressed her guilt for not having been able to prevent either occurrences. They sat silently for a moment, before Harry disclosed his plans for that night, in regards to his discovery.
Harry was in denial, and in his denial he'd given away the true damage that had been done to him by the monsters that caged him. The cool blooded creatures heart ached at the revelation. She'd seen children bully each other, and fight. It seemed a generally normal occurence, a part of human life. But never once had she ever seen offspring so mistreated by caretakers. From what she'd gathered most parents were compassionate and kind, only appearing to change their demeanor when a child had done something wrong or displeasurable.
Harry breathed heavily, staring at the desiccated corpse of his uncle. His legs suddenly couldn't take his bodyweight, and he sank to his knees. He slumped down, and barely managed to stay upright. An emotion he couldn't describe rose up into his chest, he let out a guttural and primal scream. It almost felt like his vocal chords were about to tear.
After another breath, she drew out the page therein. It was folded to fit into the envelope, the back facing outward, blank except for a name.
But his magic was not his current focus, and neither was the shrinking pile of greasy crumb covered porceline plates in the sink. No, Harry was focused on the feline observer he had on the edge of his vision, outside the window and sitting on the wall. The animal had been there since a few days after Harry and Delphinium's official allignment. It was a peculiar cat too, as he'd thought he saw white goggle like markings around the eyes the few times he'd let it come into center view. He wanted to maintain the illusion that he was unaware of his beastial stalker.
She paused a moment, she didn't remember ever having a proper title. Her mother had never given her one, and she'd never been asked on account of her life essentially being a constant competition for survival.
Harry covered his eyes with his arm, and shut them tightly, the light on the other side of the doorway was blinding. The door shut, and Harry felt himself relax a bit. His shoulders and neck had been stiff the entire time due to anxiety toward Remus. Exhaustion claimed him quickly, and he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
Once again, he was in the front yard, tending the flowers. Gradually tending each plant as necessary. His tools all felt leaden in his hands, and each task lacked his usual attention and grace. He bore the pain as well as he could, resulting in a barely acceptable gardening performance.
The noise seemed to disturb the walrus of a man's stupor. Suddenly, fury envelopes his face. Blood rushed through his skin, veins popped in his temple, his teeth were bared. He lunged forward and grabbed Harry roughly by the scruff, ignoring the cries of pain as his meaty fist gripped his supple skin.
“Yes, Professor?”
“Thank you, er, Albus.” Draco took the hot chocolate. “Scorpius? What’s wrong darling?”
“Better not let Katie hear you say that,” Harry murmured.
Sighing heavily, he almost folded himself in half to reach over the side of the bed and give the bottle a quick spin. Once. Twice. Three times the bottle spun before landing on...
