A befitting end. And a lot of work before. He went to his study, going over all the notes he had made at the Malfoy library, all the assumptions, all the calculations, everything. He needed this to be perfect. Nothing less would suffice. Nothing less would be worthy to trigger the sacrifice of the last piece of Lilly in this world.
Once or twice he still needed to duck but it was obvious none really dared to challenge him in this very moment. When the chaos became manageable the smartest attendants of Voldemort's little club had already left, ready to scheme and plot their way up through other means. The rest shuffled away when Severus dismissed them with harsh words, some hateful and to be watched for the future, some already calculating their versus his worth as allies.
“Any advice?” It sounded desperate and young, reminding Severus he was still dealing with two boys, not grown men.
As for food... He ate in a strange mixture of hurry and restraint, paying close attention to every correction of his table manners. He seemed to assume all the time the dish would be taken away any minute now. At times Severus could see what it cost Potter not to close his arm around the food in protection, not to gobble down what little he could eat, before the rest of the meal was replaced by potions to give rest to his still upset stomach and intestines.
But it was, and closing one's eyes to the reality could only further worsen the situation. It really was an absurd moment, he arguing on Potter's behalf and Albus, who basked in the identity as first champion of the light ignoring the needs and suffering of the very person he swore to protect. It cemented what Severus had realized over the years and which had been quite a bitter pill: Albus was loyal to no one but himself and his obscure agenda of a greater good. He would stop at nothing, in his self-righteous, prejudiced and willingly ignorant crusade, and the Dark Lord was the most welcome reason to condemn that half of the wizarding society that chose not to perceive him as their ultimate leader to greatness and purity.
“So...” he opened the door to his quarters, ushered Draco in, and then trudged towards his favorite armchair, sitting down heavily. “What happened?”
With a fast flick of his wand Severus conjured a splash of water and steered it into Potter's face. That did sheer wonders. Some deep breaths, then the boy straightened up and rasped almost coherently: “'M sorry, sir...”
Potter shrugged, then looked away pensively, slightly swaying in an unconscious gesture of self-comfort. “I really don't know... It felt like... accidental magic. I had no control over it. It felt...” He struggled for an appropriate description. “It felt... off. Protective, but not in a good way. Malevolent. Conniving.”
Dissatisfied he clicked his tongue and decided, there was no time like the present. He set up an alarm charm, informed Poppy, he would return at a later hour, so she knew to take the necessary actions without him, if something happened. Then he left Hogwarts and apparated back to the house that would perhaps serve best now by burning to the ground. But not yet. Careful, not to overlook something, he cast Revellios in the front and back garden and then in each of the rooms. They were all filled with traces of magic, presumably from the smoke of burning magical books and items, but some accidental defense magic was there too. Severus tried not to think too much of it, as he checked the cupboard last.
Draco started smirking and met Severus eyes again in a clear challenge, even when he spoke to Potter. “See? You have something to live for, then.”
Over the next few days, several supplies arrived, simplifying both Severus' life and the boy's. With his own set of books he no longer relied on Draco's and his own library, though he asked for certain books from time to time. New clothes were also a well-received comfort, allowing him to leave his bed for longer periods of time, albeit only if he sat down again soon. It still made both teaching and communication with him easier, due to the neutral ground of Severus' study.
Closing the door and locking it, knowing Potter had a point there, he then went towards the stairs and further to the headmaster's office in long strides. He almost sent a hex towards the gargoyle when the stony beast did not seem to react fast enough to the teacher's password. Then he entered Albus' office with the right amount of irritation showing on his face, non-verbally communicating he dared the older wizard to offer him a lemon drop on the threat of violence.
And Severus played his part, the words burning like acid of betrayal on his tongue, even when he just said what he was supposed to say. “My Lord, I have been able to locate Harry Potter for you. He was hidden in Hogwarts the whole time and with the help of your other... asset there I have been able to secure him.”
It felt good to step just that one step closer that allowed him to loom over her and look down on her snooty overconfidence. “So... you need? Or is it rather well described “you want”?” He took another step circling her reproachfully. “I take it, the headmaster chose to not inform you about Mr. Potter's whereabouts?” Leaving her no pause to step into, both physically and figuratively, he continued: “What, pray tell, makes you think, I, if hypothetically better informed, would share such revelations with you?”
Unfortunately Severus' quarters would not do for the plan he made and so, at last, the initially appointed storage room came to late honor, as Severus studied it shortly and then prepared it for Potter's arrival. There was not much to do. Transfiguring a cot out of some cupboards, place a loo behind a false wall, placing wards and alarm spells and at least temporarily eliminating the dampness were easy.
Severus had shaken his head, found no words and then belatedly breathlessly asked: “How do you know?”
“How...” Draco started, interrupting himself then with a sigh. “A lot. But I was lucky. It could have been a bite from Greyback instead.”
Poppy shook her head. “Not right then and there. He was by far too scared and upset to disquiet him further.”
They do cast a secrecy charm on him, after that. They do. But nothing the could do is as unbreakable as his own damnation. Blaise isn't an idiot. His name carries none of the ring of Malfoy or Nott. The day he tries to mess with them again, he is done for.
Poppy, as aware of the contrary as Severus, begged to differ greatly. She even went so far as to put the start of reinstatement further off, given Potter's present state of mind and the lingering vulnerability of his body.
Severus sat the glass down and closed in on his protege. “I want no such thing. You have your task and stick to it. Leave the games for those able to play them.”
In the meantime, dividing his time between teaching imbeciles and checking on a patient, who, if he opened his eyes at all, only stared at the ceiling, and confiding with Poppy on their path forward, Severus found a surprising solace in his tasks. As if the disgraces of his daily life shrank to insignificance in the light of his own shortcomings and dark regrets. Better to think of Longbottom's abysmal potion, which to everybody's astonishment didn't blow up, than of a broken body found on the floor of a locked cupboard. Better to recall even the dullest of recipes than the memory of a body too light for what he was meant to weigh. Always too light, always too small. For years.
With a deep sigh he lit the enchanted light by the bedside and took a closer look at Potter, who, as soon as the light touched him began to whisper urgently in a hoarse, rasping tone. Only a fast Sonorus made the babbling audible and it was gut-wrenching. “No, please, no. I'll be good, I promise. Please, no more. I'll be good...”
Potter looked everywhere but at him, guilt and shame flowing of him in waves. “I don't know. All I do know is I can see nothing directly concerning my own fate. He told me. Said he wasn't
Severus felt the unexpected need to lower his position as his looming over the boy caused him significant unease. That would not do of course, their relationship being anything but friendly, but fighting the urge became more difficult the longer he stood still. A distraction was needed.
“This room is barely bigger than a broom closet. It has no windows, only one door and is still reeking of the ingredients that used to be stored there, until I noticed, the room's dampness reduces their durability.”
Severus allowed himself an indulgent smile. “What keeps you from going the same way?” Before Draco could work himself into a mood, where he tried to cut ties, he would later need, Severus ended breakfast and conversation, leaving his words hanging for a later revisit. “Go now, you have classes.” He didn't mind the defiance in his stance, as long as the boy did not openly oppose him.
Silently he went over to his godson, deliberately crossing his line of sight, and put a hand against his back, murmuring near inaudibly: “Collect yourself, or he suffers for nothing.” Draco's eyes went up to his as he continued: “Watch them, not him. Watch the reason he does this.”
Olivander leaned forward, whispering something to Harry, but the boy shook his head in clear refusal. “Go on” he requested tonelessly and clenched his jaw.
Malfoy's hands are warm, when he turns Harry on his back. “You sure?” Harry's smile is enough. Malfoy takes a pillow and stuffs it, under both of them, bringing Harry higher, parts his legs, frowns... Puts them up on his shoulders, then starts again, pushing in faster now, watching Harry closely. Taking in Harry's groan, his needy whine, his eyes falling shut against his will.
He cleared his throat, disgust pooling in his guts, and replied: “Is that, what Albus said?” So typical of the old meddler to leave his dirty work to others. He didn't even need her sigh to know. “So then, what has he “suggested”.” Or rather decided.
Severus shrugged, exhaling exasperatedly. “Is this all you can see? What could have been but wasn't?”
“I live to serve, my lord.” He went to one knee under the pressure of the Cruciatus curse, before it was lifted, but judging by the fact, it didn't go any further, he clearly wasn't in the focus today.
Draco took his usual place, too, looking entirely too relaxed to be honest. “The weasel being a colossal arse happened.” He halted, putting in another request for tea. On Severus refusal he continued, less happy than before: “The mudblood came for a visit, I don't know what she talked about with Potter, but when she came back out she looked troubled. And I made sure to have a good look.”
“Exactly” she pointed in worry.
Severus folded it and tugged it into his pocket with the “map” to hopefully leave this house forever. There was really no point in going back after salvaging what was left of Potter's possessions.
Alarmingly it did not raise the Gryffindor reaction. Instead Potter sighed, looking at him pensively. “I did die already, didn't I?” His soft impassive stare remained at Severus, unsettling him by no small means. “Everything after... might be just epilogue?”
When they part again, a strangely proud smile is plastered over his face, a breathlessly captivated look in his eyes. Gods... Potter plays so well on innocence, Theo starts to question, why they didn't find that one out so much earlier. And what fun they could have had...
In typical Gryffindor style Granger and the youngest Weasley son as well as the newest addition to their unsavory circles, the typically red-haired daughter of the same clan had managed to maneuver themselves into a ridiculous amount of difficulties by trying to gain entrance into his quarters without his permission. Severus had been less than amused about the attempt, yet refused to oversee the resulting detentions. Maybe that was a mistake as it could be seen as quite an unusual behavior for him. Unfortunately he had little choice. No matter how much the invasion of his privacy might have infuriated him, he lacked the time for appropriate retribution.
Severus dismissed it and led him further, entering before him to check if Weasley was still present. That being the case he shielded him from view, until they reached Poppy's office. All the while he threw an imperious look at the loudmouth Weasley boy to make him keep his lips firmly shut.
Harry is so lost. It had been a large step already to come here, trust the Slytherins even the slightest bit. But it felt so right, at the time... letting go. Just be himself, for even the smallest part of an hour, not thinking about the image he gives, not thinking about consequences, not thinking about the evil maniac who is after him. It still feels good, all his limbs weak from exertion in the bests possible way, his mind floating in some strange place, where it is absolutely normal to cuddle up against Draco “the arch nemesis” Malfoy and be content about it.
Severus did not really care. Finally he could allow himself to relax. He breathed slowly and watched how Draco fell to his knees beside Potter's lifeless body, trying to place the lolling head in his lap. The boy brushed the dark hair away from the now pale face and stared down intensely. He did not cry but it was a close thing, and in this case Severus would have much preferred he would have let his pride rest. Yet he could not force Draco and would not try.
At least, they can have said fun now, he decides and recaptures Potter's lips, before switching to his neck. Potter follows suit, lips and tongue and teeth, leaving shivers on his skin. Right now, he would very well like to forget about Draco, but you just don't do that to your mates and so he whispers seductively: “Mind if someone joins the fun?”
“It will hurt, you know, this time, it will hurt. Can't help that...”
Severus waved his approval and went to his bedroom not bothering with much preparation before he simply let go.
But Theo would not be a good Slytherin, if he did not have a few good ideas. He hides in the shadows of the door and pulls out his own wand. Just a whispered “Wingardium leviosa” and he can screw up Blaise's spell quite nicely, distract him. Slow him down.
“Stupid boy” he growled but Putter only rolled into a tighter ball of misery, possibly not even understanding him in this state. With utter dissatisfaction Severus realized, scolding served no purpose here. It might release his own tension, but really, wasn't he above the need for such simple outlets to blow of some steam?
Severus tsked, showing no signs of anger or forgiveness. “It is advantageous to have you both present for the time being. I won't have to explain things twice.” He halted watching both Draco's frown and Potter's hopeless anticipation.
Suddenly all he wanted was leave Potter, leave the room to get away from this terrible sadness. It would have been irresponsible though. Potter might very well do something stupid. “You will get better soon enough” he said and it was almost a reprimand.
“I'll handle it. Just keep Minerva and her annoying lions out of my way.” He knew it wasn't enough to appease the old wizard,so he added, if disgruntledly: “Potter might well be the Dark Lord's downfall sooner than we expect.” And wasn't that bitterly true?
“Then some other Gryffindorks came and went. I did not keep track. Potter told them he had an accident and not more. Can't say how that went, but probably nothing remarkable happened, or Potter would have told me.”
“Fine. What duration sounds... sufficient to you? Half an hour? An hour? Two?”
The other boy understands instantly, glides behind Potter, encasing his back like Theo does to his front. They kiss him, both, sloppy and wet, savor his moans and relish the very sight of him. Now Theo has his neck, Draco his shoulder blades, them both his hips and groin, as he moves between them, thrusting into thin air, out of control.
Well it did not matter of course. Severus had done things worse by far to keep his standing with the Dark Lord or deflect suspicion. What did the dignity of one boy, no matter how battered by fate, count in the end against the greater...
Severus refused to like him any more because of that, he had been thoughtless and irresponsible and had no right to complain on that part. But his full breakdown left the plans to use Potter against the Dark Lord in question, and therefore left Severus concerned nonetheless.
Potter trained his face back to neutrality, figuring he would receive no pity here. “I got the broom from Sirius. And there were... photos.” He closed the book noiselessly and with care, as if the simple gesture offered him comfort. “Of mom and dad. And Sirius... and Remus.” For a moment, Potter thought, before adding: “The cloak and map might still be there. I don't think they found those.”
But then, during the darkest our of the forth night in his rooms a strange desperate noise, not quite a scream, woke Severus from his slumber. Instantly, he was awake and checked on the patient in his care only to find him wide awake and scared beyond measure, the face streaked with tears, the green eyes impossibly wide, the throat still too damaged for more than hoarse wheezing.
He just knew where this was heading. “You would really prefer the dungeons, where any number of things can happen unseen? Where the most fertile recruiting ground of the Dark Lord resides?”
Now finally Albus found his voice again, losing quite a lot of his usual serenity. “Next you'll suggest we strip him of his magic and let only house-elves attend him to serve his needs.”
So instead of lashing out, Theo just grins. “One would think, we were a little more substantial than a dream...”
Maybe a little panic attack in front of Albus would do. Severus was utterly surprised when he found himself hesitating. It was the right thing to do, a layer of protection, Potter needed, and yet, he felt bad for exposing him to what in Potter's eyes surely felt humiliating.
Mostly it was silent companionship, both boys reading or writing, barely exchanging a word, when Severus would hear them. He almost suspected they were purposefully hiding something from him, when things suddenly got interesting. He was just rising to send Draco to bed, so he would arrive before curfew, when it started, but stayed outside, when he heard them talk.
She turned back to her work instantly and he left even more concerned than before. Potter... Things always revolved around Potter, though in this particular case he was hardly the person to blame. It did not sit well with Severus that this time he and Draco were right in the middle of the mess.
Severus watched how after another few seconds without reaction from his side the boy put book and quill away, picked up his wand and rose in cautious motion to avoid knocking over something.
But maybe he was looking at this the wrong way. There was one person, who already had access to his rooms, certainly would notice Potter's presence anyways. He, too, was far from ideal, quite the contrary, to be honest, but at least his involvement would not cause any additional displeasure. And besides... direct confrontation with the cruelty of mankind might prove quite instructive for his godson after all. With any luck it would even cure him of his futile dreams of grandeur in service of Lord Voldemort, where there was nothing to gain but tears and pain and horror.
Potter took the book from his lap, closing it and putting it away, then stood up and faced him directly. “Pain, nightmares, occasional weakness, nausea, vertigo.” The dry tone of his voice was a first challenge after weeks without and Severus welcomed it.
“Let us try around a bit, so you can figure it out, shall we?” Draco smirked, although he found, he did not really feel smug. Not at all. He still reached for a cane, as he stepped to Potter's side and gave his back a few tentative strokes, that had Potter gasping but not crying out. It was no surprise, Potter managed to hold on, although his faced was more pinched than Draco had suspected. He suppressed the urge to ask for Potter's well-being. This was, after all, fully opposed to the whole point of this encounter.
“Potter?” Draco seemed, in a way, as horrified as Severus himself. “For what it's worth. You did a decent job, until now. This isn't your fault.”
Another few steps. Draco's voice clearly upset. “You don't mean that.”
Potter sniffed but shoved Draco away by the sound of it. “Don't get me wrong. I don't want you to go. But I need you to.” He halted his voice changing when he started again, harsh now, repellent. “People get killed around me. And... at this point I strongly suspect I won't make it either this time. Even my luck will run out at some point. And... Vol... that creature... is so powerful that once it happens I am toast.” The cool, dry tone ran goosebumps down Severus' spine. This was a child for Merlin's sake. A child he despised, true, but no war-veteran or sacrificial lamb. He should not content himself with such fatalism, made worse by how right he truly was.
They sit in the back garden, when Severus arrives, a bunch of children, their own adopted and friends from school jumping in and out of the pool and causing a colossal chaos that leaves both of them unfazed. Harry stands up first, offers his seat to him. “Severus.” His voice is warm where the skin on his left side isn't. Draco frowns as usual because he was slower. As usual. He steps close and runs his fingers absentmindedly over the unbroken skin on Harry's right side. For years Severus has tried to reprimand him for that public show of affection. Longer even than he found himself annoyed. He has long given up. “The school board asked me to offer you the Divination teacher job. Again.”
This, ever too sudden looked like the development, Severus had hoped for, when he introduced Draco to his task. It was the first blossoming begin of what could be friendship, if Draco just let it. Would enable him to call on allies, no matter, which side of this conflict prevailed. Severus remained wary though If something looked too good to be true, and things going according to plan always did, it usually was. Maybe some legilimency later on would help him evaluate the current situation.
This of all things at last produced a reaction, a small mischievous smile, barely covering more than the eyes, but still too valuable to dismiss. “I appreciate your efforts.” The corners of Potter's mouth twitched. “I'll leave the Floo open for you. One never knows.”
It made for a good chuckle. “I noticed.”
At first Petunia screamed, but soon her voice faded to mere sobbing and remained there when he was finished. He didn't look back when he farewelled: “A long life, Petunia. A long life to you.”
“We cannot safely assume it would work. He might have placed it at your first encounter, and it is still present.”
Just as he had expected the Floo flared and he stepped through right into the kitchen of the awful Black residence that now, after Black's death, belonged to none other than Harry Potter. The moment he arrived he knew he had been right. For not only did the tracking spell go off, in addition the kitchen was warm and smelled of food. Neither would have been the case if Kreacher had been the lone attendant of the house. After that it was an easy task to find Potter huddled in an armchair in the study and nursing a cup of tea in his hands. “What do y'want...” he slurred when he noticed Severus, indicating the cup might not only contain tea.
The answer, shivering and so low, he considered another Sonorus, wasn't quite what he expected. No anger, no resistance, nothing at all but only: “Water... please...”
It took two more attempts before the boy spoke out, not turning his face towards his teacher in the slightest, the voice full of fear and surrender. “Since surely, you don't want to know I am scared witless...” He caught his shuddering breath, swallowing tears. “I suggest you better don't ask.”
Belatedly the Dark Lord raised his hand, words stumbling soundlessly over his thin snake lips, but there was no more power in his motions. Easily Severus slapped the hands away, seizing the wand in the process.
Draco didn't want to come like that, still dressed, right into his trousers, as if he had the same pathetic amount of self-control as his counterpart. But one look into Potter's face, when he came with a pained groan, one more harsh contact, hip against hip, groin against groin, and he was done.
Severus still held his jaw with firm hand, when he poured the first liquid into the kid's obediently opened mouth, knowing the instinctive reaction to avoid suffering wouldn't be curbed as easily as deliberate defiance. And he was right, though the weak resistance the boy offered, trying to turn his head this way or that, was of little consequence.
On Potter's sheepish grin, he laughs and adds: “Don't worry, so did we... Draco is still out.”
She followed the usual pattern of her actions by simply ignoring the implications and disrespecting his wish for peace and quiet. “I need to know, where Harry is!” Her infuriating, squeaky voice scratched over his mind like fingernails over a plate of slate.
“Petunia...” he growled mock-friendly. His state of mind was one step away from feral, but he would not let go. Slowly he turned to her, pinning her in place with just the intensity of his stare. The woman before him looked nothing like the girl he once knew, but familiar still in her ignorance, her hostility, her bigotry. He didn't even hear the excuses, pleads for mercy, explanations that fell from her lips in a never-ending stumble of words. He didn't want to, didn't need to.
Suffocating silence spread between them, until he eventually rose to get redressed for the day at least. There was no good reason to stay dressed only in his bedrobes after all. He could hear Potter's breathing speeding up in panic when he left and took note of that, but he really couldn't remain by his side. Work had to be done, arrangements to be made. For as long as he could justify Severus occupied himself getting dressed, then arranging Potter's potion regimen around his lessons. His content work was however suddenly interrupted by a muffled thunk from the storage room. Alarmed he rushed in, finding Potter coiled into fetal position on the floor, his hands over his head, whimpering. The back of the infirmary robes was again stained with blood.
Unwanted and unhelpful compassion almost chocked him: He was rather grateful, when Hogwarts' medi-witch decided to send him away in pursuit of a diverse range of potions, she would need that were not right at hand. Already she poured some of the more common concoctions she had in stock over the injuries or into the throat of her unconscious patient, helping him swallow with sure, firm movements.
The blonde shrugs. “Potter wouldn't put up much of a resistance now. He is totally fucked out.” He can't suppress the pride, but neither the worry. “We must go and get him, before he can leave the grounds.”
It was a simple enough task, but he took comfort in the familiarity of potion work. Finishing it, he looked up, finding Draco still present and eyeing him suspiciously.
“Severus, good to see you. Poppy is asleep right now, but handed me a potion schedule for you.”
The worst part, thrice a day, was a potion combination made of weakened skele-gro to increase bone density without sucking the boy dry of all the necessary nutrients and the potion to prevent and revoke nerve damage. The concoction was unpleasant on one's best and it would burn in Potter's still tender throat like fire. He still took it meekly each time, looking utterly defeated, when first his swallows were pure agony, which, even worse, then spread to all the injured limbs burning deep within them, as it did its necessary work.
Another series of noises left Severus clueless again, until Draco hoarsely gritted out: “But Potion first.”
Draco's eyes shoot up towards his own, undecided, if they should look impressed or disgusted. “You hate him.”
For a moment he pondered choosing one of Potter's insolent deviant friends for the task, only to recoil from the idea. They, too, had turned a blind eye on it. Gracing such mockery of care with the privilege of access to his quarters was out of question.
The mere fact that Draco left him to stumble through his sentences uninterrupted told everything about how surprised and confused he was. “Are you serious?” A short pause, then he added with heat: “I would have no hesitation at all to hand you over to the Dark Lord, the moment it profits me. Stick your fucking choice up your fucking jumper!”
like this.” Draco exclaimed and stepped back, watching Potter's strained body.
If he understood even on a merely instinctive level, Severus could rest assured, he had made his future a lot less dangerous. In the meantime though... “I have work to do. I do believe you will find more peace and quiet for doing your homework here, than you would face in the common room or library. I even grant you perusal of my personal stock of books and parchments.” He did not state his conditions. It wasn't necessary.
His hands clenched, at the memory of a light body, more befitting a child than an adolescent boy of sixteen, making this show of care all the more hypocritical. “I have no intention to continue this pointless conversation nor listen to the surely abundant accusations you have at your disposal. I suggest, you take your unmistakably enormous concern to those, who feel compelled to listen to it.” With that, he left her standing and headed back towards the potions lab.
Sometimes things that were not said told more than those who were. Draco's non-descriptive style was worrying.
Severus, who knew the boy well, had no doubts, he tried to convince Potter, maybe even himself. He could not convince his godfather. A simple question, and the balance had shifted. Even more so, when Potter didn't lash out in return, but answered, after a long while, sad acceptance in his ruined voice: “It may be for the best. Getting over with it.” There was a strange noise, Severus could not quite place and then: “My chances don't get any better now. I am supposed to prepare, to... grow strong. Whatever... I don't know. Instead I am totally useless.” The boy spit it out with a measure of disgust and self-loathing to match his anger and resignation. “See the mighty savior.”
“My Lord? If Potter is dead, the Order will surely know soon. I shall talk to them and see what Dumbledore comes up with. Should no such occurrence come up, I shall assume, the smarmy fool hid the Potter boy somewhere, and try to identify his whereabouts.”
Slipping back into reality Severus found satisfaction in the knowledge Draco would sort himself out. Even if it was at Potter's side. It conveniently explained, too, why Potter could not see him, for there was no way in hell he would leave his godson's life.
“Everything, everything...” Petunia assured. “Everything you want.”
The atmosphere subtly shifted, and even Severus could not tell how, until he noticed a silent change on Potter's skin. Sharp whitish lines grew from the prominent scar, following the same meandering patterns the horcrux had, split his left eye, disappeared below his collar to reappear on his left hand, running into the very tips of his fingers.They clenched, unclenched, like the limbs of a puppet, moved by an inexperienced handler. The corners of his mouth twitched, then his chest rose and fell. Impossible. Or worse.
Severus went past the door towards his rooms, then muffled his footsteps with a silent spell and doubled back, fully concentrating on the sounds he could hear through the door.
seen worse, but neither so suddenly nor on a living person, and very especially not on the one person, who should have been kept safe for his importance in beating the Dark Lord.
He cannot help but smile, when Potter's head falls back dreamily, though the smile goes certainly smug, once the Gryffindor winces, as he feels the soreness of his body. At least, he isn't all messy anymore. Draco cleans bed mates quite thoroughly... He does take some pity however, grabs his wand and runs some simple healing spells, they learned, just for this occasion. It certainly helps Potter back to better mood.
“If we let it” Severus answered. “I would prefer if you choose another approach though.”
It was a good thing Potter screamed and cried, putting on quite the show and catching all the attention, for one look at Draco would have given them away. His face was a cold mask, the only veneer of calmness he could come up with, and his hands shook perceptibly, even shoved deep into his pockets. He could not look away from the Potter boy, doing exactly what Severus avoided at all cost: sympathizing.
Thus they reached the breaking point of Draco's patience. The voice dripping with sarcasm he asked if someone would pretty please explain to him what by Merlin's saggy balls they were talking about.
Strangely, the act of comforting the long despised child was as soothing to him as to his involuntary ward. Silently he stared into the darkness, ignoring the cold of the night, until he could hear another sound, a weak whimper, too low to be understood. Reluctantly, he bent down until he could make out the single word. “Why?”
He could not have chosen a worse – or maybe better – moment. Whatever reason had brought Ron Weasley to the dungeons, he was in perfect position to watch Draco and Potter leave his quarters side by side, carrying what looked like two satchels of school supplies. Worse even, Potter stumbled under the weight of his burden and the still prominent weakness of his muscles and Draco drew close, catching him almost tenderly.
Again, still in his sleeping robe, he checked the storage room, where Potter now was alone, sometime during the night Draco had woken up and left to take the more comfortable rest in one of Severus' armchairs, transfigured to a couch. This calmed Severus' worries, but he still held onto the plan to check for the actual events later.
Extra points for catching the pun ;)
Draco nods calmly and with just the slightest hints of guilt, another sign that things had got derailed badly, for the Ice prince never admits any guilt. At all. He could be caught red-handed on a murder scene by Professor Snape himself and still point at someone else with a smile.
Draco gaped, needed half a minute to recover from such lack in composure. “What is this? What does he do in your rooms?” Always blunt, where subtlety would have served him so much better. Draco still had so much to learn.
The room gives him not much to justify it. They have only applied low lighting today, for with
Severus took a deep breath. “Tell me about Weasley.”
Potter's gaze wonders from one to the other thoughtfully, again and again, though he is suspiciously silent. Theo gets it. He is not quite through with the night, but there are things, that need a serious talk. “Draco?” he asks innocently between two bites. “You really should... you know... apologize?”
The latter leaned against the wall with a sunny smirk and not even the slightest hint of embarrassment. Quite in contrary he had no intention to hide his eyes still almost devouring the other boy's neck. “I brought the homework...” he practically dared Severus to call him out.
But whoever is out there, comes too late. Theo might flinch, when Draco slips beside him, pointing his own wand at Blaise as well, but it's a pleasant surprise, both of them united for another good cause. The need not even exchange a look to coordinate. By nature, Draco is the more aggressive one, takes over keeping Blaise in check, while Theo gets Potter's body back to the castle, back to their playroom.
It made it all the more surprising when Draco after a trip to London on lordly matters came back through his Floo with a spring in his step Severus had long missed on him.
And yet. If he was right, if he could
The inside of the room, once they entered, left Draco curious. Alongside the apprehensive equipment, the room provided a rather cozy interior, not so unlike his father's study, and, however inconsistent, a bed.
Draco could not help but grin like a cat before the cream. “How about that.” His brows twitched, when Potter looked up. “I get to... torture you a little longer, half an hour was promised, after all, and then...” His grin grew dirty, predatory.
With Voldemort's anger thoroughly satisfied and the boy no more resistant and defiant, Severus risked a final wager. “My Lord?” he spoke silently, catching more attention with it than by screaming.
Potter fights with himself, then slowly nods, his face darkening even more. “Yes...”
Severus hated it with every fiber of his being and felt still drawn to it, caught himself staring.
He did however head for his storage room, once he entered his quarters, checking, if everything had gone according to his directions. As expected the bedside lamp threw a soft light over the room. Potter did not handle complete darkness well at the moment and fell into panic attacks more often than not, if left alone in a room without light. Unexpectedly though, Draco was not sleeping in the spare cot in his bedroom as he had suggested, but on a chair at Potter's bedside. One hand lay on the cot, with Potter almost coiling around it, the fingers wrapped into his own.
In resignation Severus sat down and watched for a while, taking in all the small signs of recognition and refusal. The still stubborn staring at the wall, the tension in sore muscles despite the suffering that caused, the jaw set in defiance.
And so, after an unhappy meal, where he stared everyone into silence, who dared to address him, he returned to his rooms, ready for another moment of mutual hatred with Potter, for once not directed at the other but at the less than ideal situation.
Draco smiled radiantly and wrapped himself around Potter, every last pinch of hesitation blown away with two simple words.
At this point Severus let the memory be and withdrew carefully. “It's comforting to know, you can handle yourself in case, it will be necessary again in the future” he announced, putting as much appreciation into his voice as he could, while watching his godson's reaction carefully. Draco flinched, just before he hurried to reassure him that this would not be a problem. It seemed, the boy had learned something. The young Malfoy had no stomach for torture and knew so now. Severus could not have been more proud, although it made the situation all the more complicated. Lucius had never had this particular problem, which was one of so many reasons, why Severus had slowly distanced himself over the years. He could manage himself, had at times and with certain participants even taken joy from it, but the mindless slaughter, Voldemort propagated these days was appalling and only appealed morons like Goyle or psychopaths like McNair or Avery. This was no company for Draco. Even Potter would be preferable to that.
For a moment, even without legilimency, he could see right into the bottom of Draco's soul, dissect all the hurt, all the despair, then his godson caught himself and found back to his impassive mask. “This...” he bared his forearm in frustration. “... clearly restricts my options, don't you think?”
Still his hand rested on the top of the boy's head as he straightened, thinking carefully. “You are still needed, Potter.” Pathetic, how the harsh words could not mask the tenderness of the tone, full of worry for a child's well-being.
The medi-witch agreed. “It might be safer.”
Poppy studied the boy over his shoulder. “What can we do?”
Silently they negotiate, who is going to get him this time and who has to go and wait, if he ever comes back. Draco is insistent... full of fear of losing his chance, and it will cost him, Theo will make sure of that, when he stands back, letting him have his way. It is definitely worth it.
“The weakness of your body and soul gave it space to grow. By this point it feeds of you. Your body. Your magic.”
With that he opened his arms and his mind, taking no more care, the tears flowing freely if without a single sob.
Potter took shivering breaths, telling Severus he was aware of even some of the implications. “He used it. Used me.” Thinking of their failed occlumency lessons, Severus corrected his assessment of the time frame. Maybe it was really older than he thought.
BTW: we will end up with around 33k words, so this won't take very much longer ;)
Granger was another candidate. As annoying as her conviction and inflexible morals were, her intellect may actually come useful. Weasley and Longbottom were out of question, as was the Weasley girl. Again this was a very, very short list, and he regretted he had not noticed earlier. Who had Potter ever had to rely on? Who could he ever trust? Granted, it was much harder to gain Severus' trust than the boy's but still... it was most disappointing.
And to your left you now see a horcrux... Please refrain from touching, it bites.
Heading back to the dungeons that promised some quiet to think, he passed by Potter's door and frowned. The wards were in place, though slightly ruffled, the door just that much ajar that nobody would notice but one could hear from the insides what happened in the corridor. Curious.
Yes. His book on detection spells was an absolute essential, given his need to circumvent wards, dark artifacts and all kinds of spells in his need to hid his profession as a spy.
Severus shrugged. “Why, care for him, for now. The Dark Lord wants him for himself, as you are well aware.” It would have been the perfect hook to let Draco know, he expected him to help, but somehow Severus hesitated. Perhaps it was better to let the young Malfoy come to his own conclusions.
It took another minute or so, then a small figure clad in a dark cloak stumbled into the room, coughing hard, falling to his knees and finally to his face, unable to stop the fall with his hands tied behind his back. It was another deviation from the initial plan, but what an effective one. It made Draco stepping through the fireplace after Potter looking all the more in charge. Quickly he glanced around the room, his eyes glinting in bitter triumph, before he sank to one knee and bowed his head beside the huddled form of Potter's body.
A place, where it feels good to be pulled closer still, manhandled really, a hand slowly combing through his hair and staying on top of his head then, making it impossible to raise it again. Harry's breath only deepens, as he doesn't even try. It's too good to fight it, too natural.
direction on a battlefield.”
From time to time he tries to reciprocate, his hands sliding over their skin, his mouth soft and wet and hot on their skin, but he isn't prepared for them. Again, a pleasant deviation from the expected path of the evening. Again a hint, something does not quite add up.
When the boy laid down instead of answering, he took the vial and poured it, even he failed to find the cruelty to make the boy drink this by himself. Placing an alarm charm, he then left, already a little late for classes, and strangely grateful for a reason to go away. Pathetically he felt the pity for Potter growing, each time, he found himself in this situation. A pity, he could by no means afford. Better to bury it under loads of work and the anger of a master over the incompetence of his pupils. The first years of today's class were willing targets, as they did not yet know how to behave in the lab and in turn rightfully asked for a proper scolding, which he dutifully delivered.
Severus came to the conclusion that it was rather lucky, this had happened at the start of the semester, before those stocks of potions could be depleted. It still left him with a lot of work, both to replace the used potions and brew new, more specialised ones to avoid sepsis, strengthen the body and give rest to both the vulnerable physis and frightened mind.
Potter nodded and off they went.
Severus had a good idea on that but did not tell him, in part because he really couldn't. Grimmaulds Place 12 was his first bet as it lay abandoned ever since the dog had died and the wolf moved out to flee from the memories. It was no good place for Potter and it would be a worse place even for Draco. Until the Fidelius was undone however, he had the best excuse to keep him away. Draco threw him a wary look. “You know something.”
“What do you see?” Potter had asked when he first picked it up. “My mother?”
It burnt, his heart clenching in realization, how little the boy looked like James Potter now and how much like the shy girl from the muggle world that would one day be his mother.
Draco pretended not to notice and busied himself with tying Potter's hands up and raising them over his head with a winch. Several conflicting impulses warred for precedence in his head. Maybe it was his best approach to work through them one after the other.
For you could see it if you looked closely. Potter's left eye slowly losing its radiant color, the thin, cracked and broken lines on his skin darkening by the day like veins of spoiled blood. It was good no one was allowed to see him anymore for there was no hiding it. Starting from his scar they ran all the way down to his left arm and hand, started to take over his ribs and hips and chest as well. Not much longer now until the wretched thing would make itself known in other ways, not much time to stop it. It did already cause pain to the boy, a fact he carefully hid from Draco while he could.
The Gryffindor gained confidence in Draco's presence and broadened his mind, which would come handy one day to open his eyes for the fate of the Slytherin children, who would certainly suffer, once open conflict broke out again. And his godson could use some new experiences, too, preparing him for the revelation that killing mudbloods, pardon muggleborns and halfbloods would solve none of the real problems of the wizarding society. This, Severus knew was a hard path to walk, when even intelligent people like Lucius strove for the seemingly simple solution. It was a worthy one, nonetheless, and would pay in the future, so he would not suffer his godfather's fate as a lonesome, bitter man full of regrets.
As agreed, Draco runs of through the corridors, while Theo takes the shortest ways outside, just up the stairs, around the corners and then... A bit of fabric hangs from the next knights armor, standing by the entrance as if guarding it, the soft patch white and soft. Their blanket. Or at least part of it. Theo swears. Suddenly he realizes, he should not have parted with Draco. Together they would have had a much better chance. Blaise is not easily fooled or beaten, can be quite an opponent, and there is no say, if he didn't get himself some help...
His expression only ever lit up, when Draco stepped into the room, which fortunately happened daily after classes. Sometimes he stayed only a few minutes, handing over some homework by teachers, informed of the situation, sometimes he remained in the room all evening, keeping Potter's company.
“Yes please...” It was still barely a whisper but clearly spoken.
Severus shook his head disapprovingly. “There is time yet, Do not rush blindly into it. Potter might just present himself as an opportunity rather than an obstacle to you, if you handle this right.” He would certainly help keep Draco out of trouble until Severus had made a plan to save both his godson and his mother Narcissa without exposing his position as a spy.
“We will try again at noon.”
Against all odds the one eye not completely swollen shut, opened slowly and stared at him without focus. A noise, not as much as a real voice, but a broken and rough whisper sounded: “Go away.” After a cough and a pained groan, louder than the words themselves, the boy continued: “Let me... die... in peace... at... least.”
to receive comfort. Severus doubted it would work with Potter. After the incident with Weasley he didn't feel particularly inclined to try. Another unexpected physical sensation would need to do.
Theo contents himself with another movement, grinding his hips to Potter's, their cocks sliding against each other, fluids mixing. He, too, can't keep it fully quiet any longer. Draco glides deeper, Potter, between them, moves, his hips rolling in slow motions, back and forth, impaling himself deep on Draco, then going forward to meet Theo. He doesn't even know, he is doing it, doesn't notice, how Draco bottoms out. Doesn't understand, what happens, when Draco finds the right angle, meeting his prostate. Draco and Theo though exchange a knowing, satisfied smile, when he screams out, his rhythm stuttering, his whole body tensing in anticipation. Soon, too soon.
Another layer of red tinged Potter's face. “I don't know, I... had to try.” He looked down and flinched, when Draco's palm slid under his chin and forced it back up.
When he arrived in the sickroom one needed to pass on his way to the medi-witch's office, the Weasley boy was still present and in company of some of the Gryffindor students. Naturally he threw hateful looks in Severus' direction. For the moment however he had the sense to do nothing more. Severus ignored him and his fellow lions and went straight for Madam Pomphrey's office.
Judging by Potter's current state, he had little chance to oppose the idea or sabotage its execution, unfortunately at the cost of being too vulnerable to be exposed to any hostilities from Draco's side. He would need to talk to him. At length.
Severus still watched, fully alert, how Olivander opened his suitcase , evaluating its contents, then handing out the first specimen complete with his usual barrage of information.
Severus studied him for a moment before he chose to answer. “Have you noticed anything unusual about yourself since your recovery?”
Blaise tries to create a good balance, keeping Potter at the same height all the time, so for the time being, Theo pulls him up. Not to much, just a little bit, so that Blaise does not realize yet, he messes with him.
The other boy still looked quite awkward, when he started to unbutton robe and then shirt, shrugging out of them and revealing a rather worn and disfigured undershirt. While he removed this, too, an ashamed blush crept over his cheeks.
Potter listened to the statement with demonstrative patience.
He stretched along Potter's body to loosen the rope, when he felt first the breath then lips of the other on his. All of a sudden, he lost every interest in the task, embraced the Gryffindor insteand and deepened the kiss, invading his mouth and drinking up the moans that followed. Potter was inexperienced but both clever and enthusiastic. It took him no time at all to get, what Draco wanted, and give it to him. Draco raked his back with fingernails, scratching more gently, than he thought, he would, rested the hands on his hips, grinded against him with rising vigor, never really breaking the kiss and stealing the breath right out of Potter's mouth.
“What is this?” he shouted, unable to contain himself, tired, worn out and horrified as he was. It didn't do him any good. Draco stood up and placed himself in the line of sight between him and Potter protectively. “Severus, I would suggest we talk next door? With tea, preferably?”
Severus rose to his feet, dipping his head only the smallest bit, voluntarily risking Voldemort's anger. He would do quite a lot more, before the evening was over. “My Lord, if I may rid you of this annoyance so we can go on to more pleasant parts of the meeting?”
When he opened the door, though, he was surprised by some unexpected noises from the storage room. Silently he sat down, willing himself to first listen.
Shaking his head in exasperation Severus dismissed the thought and every other one circling around Potter. Or tried.
Continuing his musings he applied a first healing spell, just as Poppy stepped into the room accompanied by his godson. When she took over, he sat down to calculate an alteration to Potter's potion regimen to include a stronger blood replenisher and some additional nutrients for better healing. He also considered reducing the pain relief, not out of senseless cruelty, but to have better feedback on what was going on in the boy's body. He decided against it. The child was clearly in pain, judging by his injuries and yet his reactions to it had never exceeded purely instinctive level. There would be no answers from this.
And Severus knew he would. They had repeated the plan so often all of them could dream it in their sleep. All Severus had to do now was prepare the stage for the final act of the tragedy to unfold. Steeling himself against all sentiment he went towards the boundaries of Hogwarts and apparated, reappearing at Malfoy Manor as expected.
The headmaster gestured for a chair and Severus ignored him intentionally, letting him struggle through several exhales and a slightly irked: “And what do you expect me to do about him? Imprison him in the dungeons?”
“He might still let me...” Draco's voice. Tentative. Insecure. Not at all like the overconfident persona he held firmly in place against any hurt, insult or attempts to understand him.
someone else. Someone he now knew had watched and did nothing.
Poppy, professional as himself, understood that and spared him the usual barge of questions and declarations of pity. Instead she got directly to work, running cleaning and detection spells in rapid succession. From time to time he felt her throw him a quizzical look, but that aside, she worked relentlessly.
Draco speeds up and so does Theo, taking over the control, giving the golden-skinned boy between them everything they have, until he cannot think straight no longer, and certainly not talk... All he can do, is scream and gasp and cry and moan. And come... His whole body caught in one inexplicable arch, looking almost painful, something so extreme, it wouldn't work, if he wasn't that thin, that small, that flexible. Draco cannot hold on against that sight, tenses too.
And Potter had claimed: “You told me. How you were friends. How it went to hell. No... wait...” he had stumbled, apologetically. “That was the other Snape.”
What was left now was to move Potter here, preferably in plain sight of some of his dorm mates to instill all the wrong impressions. He thought long and hard, how to best raise suspicion and hostility and chose then to leave some traces of seemingly ill-advised magic. The new wand did serve nicely in this matter. Some obviously visible if totally useless wards would do even better. Severus placed them, not abiding to his usual policy, in plain view as to allow visitors to have a good look at them.
Severus cool stare made him stop. “Think before you speak, Draco. This is of essence.”
To be totally frank with it, neither he nor Draco put up much of a resistance. The mere thought of sharing Harry fucking Potter between the three of them... unthinkable and tempting. He really can't understand, why Zabini backed out in the end, especially,
“I fully understand your need to punish misbehavior. But is the boy really worthy of your attention? When no one but your faithful servants who need no more demonstration will ever know?”
“Go now” he added softly when Potter remained in place, making no move to stand up, his body slightly shaking, the shoulders in the constant up and down of suppressed sobs. “Potter?” Severus asked, masking concern with harshness. “Potter!”
“Please, please, please....” he whispers. “Malfoy, Draco, please...”
Severus sighed. “I don't know. We can only try our best and hope.”
Sure, Draco's mouth
Potter didn't sleep and looked up startled, when he heard the door. Knowing now, he feared to be unprepared for Voldemort, it was less of a surprise that he had a book in his lap and was studying. Pensively he stared for a moment, then asked Severus calmly, as if he had pondered the question for a very long time: “Is... is a wand forever?”
He hoped there would be at least enough time for Draco's new, not even quite admitted affection to cool off and die down. If not, even the best possible outcome would be a disaster. Even if Potter came out alive and mentally... existent, he would be still far away from anything resembling a “happy ending.”
It was probably time to put a stop to it by introducing Potter back into his old environment, if restricted by the still palpable lack of stamina.
Severus could not allow himself not to pay attention. “What was that?”
Draco didn't let him. “No. My game, my rules and you will like them or suffer obediently.” Potter looked mortified and moaned, but said not a word, as Draco began to rub over muscles and ribs, explored the hollows of stomach and throat, the ridges of spine and shoulder blades, all the while his face in close contact with the other boy's. Gasping and groaning, the head bowed, the eyes averted, Potter gave the perfect picture of shy innocence, albeit not quite a tortured one, to be honest.
Severus was no longer receptive to his threats. He held his stare for long seconds, bowing only to keep appearances up. “I submit to your decisions, my Lord.” Exhaling slowly, he swallowed the bitterness rising and took his place among his so-called peers, appalling creatures most of them, from the disappointing ratish servility of Pettigrew over the barking madness of Bellatrix Lestrange to the indifferent brutality of Greyback.
“I got Madam Pomphrey. She... helped him. She left, I stayed to keep him company. It's far from comfortable over there. Hence the cot. End of story.”
His silent acceptance more than anything told Severus how deeply Potter had been broken, how little of the arrogant, inordinate boy he knew, had survived the ordeal. This being, this
“Nevertheless.” He had won staring contests with Lucius and might have, if he ever dared, with the Dark Lord. Draco was no match for him. “A Slytherin knows how to keep all his options open.”
Draco can see his doubts and huffs, scratching his head, then smiling so damn starstruck. “He was lying completely open, Theo...” he tries to explain. “Was practically shoving it into my face, begged me to give it to him.”
Potter seemed doubtful now. “Yes. Maybe. I... see little else from you. Only... flashes.”
First he stepped behind Potter's back, relishing his nervous tension, and ran his hands contently over the smooth skin. He liked the way, muscle after muscle twitched under his fingers, and chose not to comment. Instead, he circled to Potter's front, slapping him in the face, once, twice. “Is this, what you want?” He scoffed. “Do you really believe, it will prepare you for anything?” He underlined his last word with a jab to the stomach that would have had Potter bending over, if not for the tied hands. “Answer me.”
What occupied most of his time though, especially the silent hours of the night, when he stared into the darkness failing to find respite, was the emptiness he found in the boy. The old Potter had been barely containable, even when hurt, would by now found a thousand different ways of testing the boundaries of the rules set for him, would have asked dozens of pointless questions on the how and when he would be returning back to his friends, not necessarily to school.
Severus sought refuge in bluntness, as he always had. “No one allowed you to die, Potter, so don't you dare now!” After that, he stepped away, searching the house for something, anything to make the transport of the boy at least bearable. He would have apparated directly with him, but under the circumstances St. Mungos might not be safe enough for him, and the wards of Hogwarts prevented him from going directly to the Infirmary there. In the end he chose one of the furniture protection sheets and wrapped Potter's body firmly into it, paying little mind to the weak shrieks of pain, not by choice but out of necessity. Prepared like that he lifted him with a careful levitation charm and touched the top of the head, which seemed to be one of very few unaffected areas to ensure sufficient contact for a side-along apparition right to the gates of Hogwarts. Covering his head too and concealing the red stains that flecked the white fabric, he then made his way to Poppy Pomphrey, hoping the experienced medi-witch might be able to safe the boy's life and restore him, preferably to full health, although that seemed unlikely at this point.
Severus would need to correspond with Olivander on the matter and force him to swear complete confidentiality. The rest of Potter's things, the sentimental value aside was easily replaceable. He would make sure to order in sufficient amounts on behalf of the school to conceal the actual usage, sure that Albus would not refuse this. He was just as keen on keeping this secret as Severus. And should he be more stubborn than expected, Severus would not refrain from blackmail either.
“The weasel must have slipped through. I only noticed when the screaming was audible over here.” Draco shrugged as if he wasn't aware what kind of noise was necessary to achieve that.
On a whim Severus cast a last analysis himself. Soulmagic, among the darkest kinds of things to apply to another person, destroying them in the most literal sense. An unholy shiver ran over him when this at last came out positive. More than just Potter's life was at risk it seemed, and Severus had only ever encountered anything similar once before. Then it had also been directly connected the Dark Lord. He would need to consult the Malfoy library as soon as possible. This evening might be best. He cast a quick tempus and found it was still early enough to get everything done and go there later.
Draco answered with a bitter laugh that echoed painfully with Severus' own suffering. “Don't be ridiculous. What do you have to be sorry about, in that?” Severus could practically see how Draco pushed the possibility of it away.
Another nod, then Draco's face scrunches up in concentration, while he ever so slowly eases himself into the boy before him, one inch at a time.
Severus coughed. “I have to explain what it is for you to understand what it does. And how, if you choose so, we can turn it against him.”Draco frowned, then flinched, as he realized they were talking about the Dark Lord. Only now he understood how far Severus had crossed the line of open betrayal. Also noticed that Potter wasn't surprised, had known what he had not. He showed his mature, almost adult side when he leaned back instead of interrupting with thousands of insubstantial questions.
Severus was used to suppressing his feelings and did not want to change that now, but still felt the distinct urge to destroy something. Something expensive with a nice sound preferably. Instead he shook his head and prepared himself some tea. He would not be able to continue his work any time soon and could not risk stupid mistakes due to a lack of concentration. So he forced himself to relax, rest, do some well-needed self-preservation. He was fully aware this could not go on for much longer for it was wearing him down. It did the same to the boys who were much less used to this kind of pressure. Merlin knew when they would crack. Somehow he wasn't worried though. They had managed to this point, the would manage the rest. If only he played his part.
Feel also free to write to my discord. The account info is in my profile.
Theodore is surprised by that.. One would think, Potter has had really everyone, with blatant exception of the Slytherins. Well, maybe he didn't dare try that particular kind of pastime before, what with his image of being the spearhead of morality and jolly goodness. A screwed world view, but then... these times everything is screwed. “You ok?”
Draco did not look happy or relaxed anymore. “Nightmares. He screamed himself raw, fought against the blanket, fell of the bed. Neither of us was there. I found him in the morning.”
The problem, Severus soon realized, wasn't to cause just any incident. Potter, though physically stable enough, if not forced into long walks or, worse, flying, was anything but that mentally. The silence, common in Severus' rooms, had rarely been broken, the boy treading lightly in his every move, waiting for the next strike. Even after weeks in Severus' care, trust was hard to come by and the smallest of provocations made him seek cover in the storage room, not to be seen again unless forced out for the meals.
Severus thought about it. “I guess I am.”
Pensively he watched his godson and sighed after a while. “He isn't there nor is it very likely he will return.”
Had Voldemort had time to think he might have gotten suspicious. His inner circle had heard the ramblings on how
Draco could not grin more predatorily. “You did? Then... How about a repeat performance?” He even wriggles his brows suggestively, that wandering cliché. But then... this is Draco. He cannot do without drama. And Potter...
The Dark Lord fell to the ground, and an uproar began, screams and shouted spells flying around the room. Bellatrix fell to the floor, weeping “my Lord, my Lord” before gazing at Severus with unrestrained hatred. A stray curse stupefied her before she could do more.
Potter was better now, to the point that he got up regularly and was allowed to do some reading instead of being restricted to listening, though he still tired easily and was still too frail to be allowed more than a trip to the bathroom. The danger of a relapse was simply too high, with a body that was mostly still held together by magic, spit and good wishes. Besides, his extensive potion regimen needed constant attention.
“I see you are taking care of your studies.”
Potter glanced at Severus over his shoulder before giving Draco a tentative kiss to the cheek, more brotherly than hot, filled with goodbyes and unfulfilled wishes. “You'll get over me. I'm but a blink in the big picture of things.”
Potter hesitated, pain slowly bleeding into the face, as he shook his head, casting his eyes to the floor, mumbling something.
Potter shook his head impatiently. “There is nothing else? How very creative...” His eyes met Draco's and for a long moment neither spoke as they fought a silent duel. Green against grey.
The boy's hand fell back to his side and he nodded jerkily. “You are right.”
“You want me to torture you.” Draco's obvious doubt was well-deserved. After all, this request was... insane at best and from Potter it could only be worse. The other boy shook his head. “Not exactly. I want to know, what it would be like. If I could take it... being tortured by a death eater. You are one, aren't you?”
“Or he can go his merry ways. Remembering nothing, not what he did, not what happened here. Not
As Potter furrows his brow, Draco nods in abashment. “Probably. So... Potter... I know, we had quite some fun, but... I am sorry, I pushed you that far. It wasn't... right.”
Theo knows, Draco swings that way, likes it to be in charge, likes it to make all the decisions, likes to add a little pain, a little power. But he has never broken the unspoken rule before: never without discussing the deal first. Never without safety net. Granted, this is Potter and Potter has always been a bit of a sore point for Draco. But falling so completely out of their rule-set is unlike him.
“Severus, I take it, the path out of Hogwarts' wards has been arduous?”
He got up again and, totally ignoring Severus continued presence, left the room towards the kitchen. There Severus found him leaned against the hearth, trying to absorb its warmth. “When he asks...” Potter didn't mention a name. Did not need to. “Tell him I died.” It sounded suspiciously like “I soon will”.
Potter didn't confirm, but explained. “He told me it wasn't my time yet. I had duties yet so he would send me back. But there wasn't enough left of me to survive.”
Just when he thought Voldemort's patience would run out any second now the fireplace flared up in green light. Clever boy. Using the Floo from Severus' office would of course be traced. But on the one hand he was just “going home” and on the other it would hardly matter anymore after this night however the plan would turn out.
Soon the body lay bare, the extent of damage open to the eye; it was devastating. There seemed to be no bone unbroken, no part of skin intact, no pain spared. From time to time tremors ran over the muscles and pressed out more thick sluggish blood. The worst though, the very worst were those injuries unexplained by “just” a beating. The throat raw within, the lower intestines damaged, the skin of the stomach pierced. From the insides. Poppy could not make heads or tails of that, but Severus knew. He had seen it before, though he shoved the memories into the darkest places of his mind, as far away from attention as possible.
He instructed his guarding portrait outside, a good resemblance of Pyridor the Daring, genius inventor of several basic potions, to let Poppy in without a fuss until further notion. Thereafter he went to open the potions classroom, just in time for his first batch of daily idiots, hell-bent on destroying the near indestructable interior, the third years of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw in this case.
“Don't” he whispers, then louder. “Please?”
Instead, he would probably not be able to convince any of those so very proper and adult people in time, giving Blaise all the time he needs. Even Draco can do better than that. He will surely come after Theo, once he has no more floos to check. And if they are lucky, he will bring Snape, under some weird pretense, Theo will never ask him to explain. Until then, he is on his own... And time is running out.
Severus suppressed a shiver, forced himself into deadpan. “For now and until the matter is resolved I would have you keep your distance from others.”
The answer, though intended to be cryptic, was telling instead. “ I was punished for misbehaving.”
Draco swallowed thickly, still all but mesmerized by his remarks. “Do... do you want to make me traitor?”
“Show me” Severus barked when barely back to himself. Potter tried to refuse, pulled back, a more instinct-driven reaction of self-protection than actual disobedience. Severus held him back, the fingers digging firmly into the shoulder. “Show me.” But the moment he had Potter's full attention, their eyes meeting in one intense fearful gaze, he needed to see no more. The left eye was discolored, just slightly, the green dull and weak compared to the emerald of the right.
He extended the same offer to Severus, who gladly took it, for it gave him what he most needed now. Peace and quiet and time. To think, to recover, to figure out, what to do now.
“Sleep now.”
Their attempts on brewing the assigned potion of the day proved futile in most cases, when even the famed Ravenclaws could not be bothered with the intricacies of potion brewing. It left Severus plenty of time to brood over the problem of how to introduce both patient and companion to the prospect of spending time with the other, without jumping at each other's throats.
Potter huffed and unfolded his body and legs into a more dignified position. “Really? You want to hear more of that?” It was no wonder he very well remembered when he had had no one else to speak to, quite in contrast to Severus. “You want to hear how I left you behind, knowing I could do nothing more for you?” He sounded angry and sad and inexplicably guilty as he looked directly at Severus with a determination he had never shown before, not even when he had still been “Hero Potter”.
Severus could not understand Draco's less clamant answer, but could guess well enough when Potter stormed into the hall, throwing the door shut behind him. “Fine” he screamed over his shoulder, completely ignoring the presence of his once teacher. “You can still go and marry some pure-blood wench, have a lot of pure-blood kids and pretend you are happy.” With that he stomped towards Severus or rather past him to get to his guest room, ready to gather his things.
Again, intense gazes met. “I would. Besides... you can't get me out of Hogwarts and you won't kill me, because Voldemort wants me for himself.” He exhaled heavily and continued: “What do I have to loose?” A whole lot, Draco knew, but didn't say. The whole matter became entirely too enticing to step back from it, now.
The other Slytherin waves his hands softly, does just the tiniest of shrugs, not to disturbs his sleeping bed mate. “I know, Theo, I just... lost it, when the magic hit me.”
He saw Albus come to the same conclusion and nod reluctantly. “Very well. But I want you to make sure the boy will receive sufficient company.”
“Crucio” it hissed behind Severus, who flinched, but wasn't the target, this time, as Voldemort questioned Avery on his visits to locations suspiciously close to the place, where Voldemort suspected Potter's summer hiding residence. Next was Greyback and then himself, gracelessly falling and seizing under the force of Voldemort's spell, yet no one could come up with valuable information. He deemed it wiser not to give the Dark Lord anything, lest he decided to act prematurely thus endangering both Potter and Draco.
He's so responsive, so helplessly ill-equipped for their onslaught. Tries to remain silent, and can't, a constant stream of groans, whimpers and swearwords falling from his lips. And they haven't even properly started...
In passing their eyes met just for a split-second, and for the first time since his death. Potter stumbled and paled, averting his eyes with near-panicked hurry. Severus' hand shot out and grabbed his chin, forcing him back mercilessly. “What is it?” he asked, emphasizing every single word.
Potter has agreed to meet with them. But so be it, less crowded, more gold-kissed skin for Draco and him. He won't complain. And Draco... well... Draco has wanted this as long as he has actually figured out, how to have a proper wank, as everyone in their dorm can tell, if they paid attention. Even the most oblivious creatures on the planet, Vincent and Greg know that much.
He let himself not be fooled by the friendly and concerned tone of Voldemort's voice. Despite the obvious facts of his travel, his late appearance after calls was a constant reason for reprimand.
For a minute both of them stood catching their breath, then Potter swallowed uneasily and suggested, all to gently: “Perhaps... it would be good, if you untied me now?”
Dozens of questions arose in Severus' mind, but he only addressed the most urgent ones: “What kind of burst? What signature?”
Clicking her tongue at the sudden change of subject, Poppy mused: “In principle he is fine again. I only keep him for supervision.”
Harry asked, just an hour ago, would have declared the prediction, he might like anything like that insane. But now that it actually happens, it makes him awake and free and real. Pain doesn't bother him, pain is just part of his life, but the jolts of intensity, of sensation are too perfect to be anything but a dream, too primal to be anything but real. He didn't feel himself getting hard, but now, when Malfoy is moving, he can feel the friction and it hurts in all the best ways. He loses control over his breathing, if he ever had it in the first place and shivers, screaming, panting, crying for what Malfoy does to him. He doesn't even find it him to protest, no matter that he should, really, really should. Instead, he begs for more, groans in pleasure, when Malfoy's heavy body presses him down, his chest pulling uncomfortably at the shoulders through his bound hands, his legs tangling into Harry's his hard cock pressing against his already abused hole.
Severus wished for defiance, wished for anger or fury, in Merlin's sake, even fear would be better than this calm nothingness. It was all he got from Potter. Gruffly he countered: “You were send back for a reason, Potter. You cannot deny that. So you better straighten up and get yourself back together.” After a short moment of contemplation he dryly added: “Or shall I do that for you?”
He huffed and let once more instinct beat contempt, as he placed just one warm hand quietly on Potter's body and let it rest, until the touch seeped through the haze of his troubled mind. At first, the boy tried to get away from it, easing out of the way within the small space between Severus and the cot. When he could go no further, he stilled, slowly calming down, until only the shivers of his skin bore witness of the storm passed.
The old wandmaker knew a dismissal, when he heard it, collected his goods and hurried towards the floo, before leaving with a last friendly greeting.
Severus started to explain. “On one of your encounters, I presume when he gained control over you, the Dark Lord placed a piece of himself, of his soul inside you.”
It was as impersonal a warning as she could give and he hoped it was all there was to say. “Is there a possibility to prepare for that case or fully remove the risk?”
She stepped into his path with her usual annoying self-righteousness and didn't even have the decency to flinch, when he measured her with cool contempt.
Of course, Blaise compensates, pointing Potter back down, halts to gain back his bearings, which is exactly, what Theo was waiting for. With a simple movement of his wand he points down too, making Potter glide to the ground slowly.
Hey everyone, it will go pretty fastpaced now, I guess.... the hyperlong chapters are behind us. Might be, I will combine two or three of the smaller scenes into one chapter, therefore I am not sure yet with how much we will end up, but it will be soon.
Once Draco had left, he rose, taking a bowl of porridge over to the sickroom and offering it to Potter, who looked rather doubtful, but tried to rise and arrange himself in a sitting position anyways. He forced down a spoonful or two, looking sick already and handed the bowl back. “I'm sorry, sir.” All too polite to feel right, but at least stronger than last time.
When the house-elf returned, he sat at his table gesturing towards Draco to take the opposite seat, then watched him for a moment. “I take it, the potion administration went well?” Legilimency always worked best, when the thoughts already went into the right direction.
“Maybe” Severus admitted. “But it does not concern you since you told me yourself: it is over.”
Draco almost fell, too, leaning against Severus, his face hidden in his godfather's shoulder.
It still took another soft kick from Draco to make him reach out to take another wand. “Yew, 11 inches, unicorn hair core.” as Olivander helpfully provided.
And isn't he right about that one... Pity really, if he would have got messed up too early for them...
When only Draco, two bodies and Bellatrix' unwanted presence remained in the room he summoned one of the Malfoys' elves to put her into the dungeons before she woke up. The aurors would probably take care of her later once Draco let them know.
With Potter blushing even harder Severus knew it was pointless to make Draco see. He knew already the chances were non-existent, but found his strength in fighting for them anyways. In a way he, this..., felt more adult than Severus had ever given him credit for.
Severus watched, just for a moment, before he decided to interfere by reprimanding the boy. “Mr. Potter, contain yourself. You are no five-year-old out to buy some sweets and I should think, you would have good interest in not exposing yourself so easily.”
Severus threw a last none too gentle look at Potter, who shrunk under the attention, then nodded. “I expect you to tell me everything.”
Potter looked down on his hands, still a picture of stoic acceptance, and nodded. “As you wish, sir.”
But that is not the plan, so he keeps it still, watching, as Draco runs his prick through Potter's crack, leaning over and whispering soothing words into his ear. “Relax, love, it might a bit uncomfortable, but it won't hurt. I know, what I am doing...”
“Blindness. Ignorance. If I had...” The words faded into an uneasy silence, before Potter started anew: “I was full of prejudice. I was wrong. The Slytherins... you... are not as I expected. I could've... offered you a choice...”
This certainly changes the pace of Potter's breaths, though not really easing their way. Theo grins, smug as a cat before the cream, wets the fingers again and slips them down over Potter's groin onto his thighs, carefully avoiding to touch his weeping, hard cock for now. They would not want this to end to soon. And all bothered and worked up, Potter will agree easily. Knowing, what Draco is doing behind, his fingers slipping in cautiously and with care, Theo continues his efforts, touching only lightly, each seemingly coincidental contact with Potter's length making him jerk and moan.
The edges of the picture he did not quite see still irritated him. Swollen lips and bright eyes. Dark smudges near the collar. Whispers and gasps just inside his earshot. Hands and eyes locking.
“It's not the taste...” Potter breathed apologetically. “I'm just... filled, after a week of only potions.” It had been more than a week, Severus knew. Suddenly he was glad, Potter didn't. It meant, he did not remember the whole misery. “Thank you, though. For this. For coming.”
After these words, he left the room, for once not enforcing anything, as he was well aware, Potter would be as likely to sleep now as he was – not at all.
Draco stills him, whispering hoarse with need: “Relax, love, I will not hurt you...” And Potter is too gone to notice the endearment, that so easily slipped from Draco's lips in the heat of the moment.
A sudden thought threw him onto a new tangent and made him smirk. Yes. Potter was already used to putting on the brave face and to even those close to him abandoning him in times of peril. Driving a wedge between him and some of his housemates would do no further damage but the resulting hostilities were excuse enough to keep up at least some of the precautions. And Albus could hardly object to keep the boy under close scrutiny after the events of late if things got heated once again.
Draco seemed to appreciate the sentiment as well as Severus willful ignorance of the look in his face when it happened. He still was forlorn and sad, telling Severus this was not quite as over as Draco wanted him (and himself) to believe. Further evidence was provided when he took his leave to go back to Hogwarts and inform both Dumbledore and the public what had happened in the past days. By this point the lack of action from the Dark Lord's followers would have everyone on their toes. But all thoughts of that paled when Draco sheepishly asked: “Will... you make sure he is okay? Until... I am back at Hogwarts I mean?”
Before Albus recovered from his surprise and indignation, he added more coldly than he felt: “I will ward the door and room and supervise all his activities. Visits should be restricted to the absolute minimum. The lack of distraction shall serve him well in reducing his backlog in comparison with his peers.”
That left very little to do for him. Finishing the school year and collecting his things to follow a more fitting path as potions master. Ensuring Dumbledore left him alone and buying the ingredients for a better future, a house, a shop. And the other issue that had to this point been left hanging in favor of more important things...
fashion sense, Potter has definitely issues with his body, he will be safer if some things remain in the shadows, which leaves only the shine of stone walls and the oversize fourposter bed, they use for their fun. Potter eyes it with suspicious anticipation, smiling ashamedly or looking scared in turn.
Olivander tried to mollify him, stating that the excitement was all too understandable, but Severus recognized it was not that, what Potter felt.
The second class was hopelessly uneventful though, as the seventh year Ravenclaws with one or two Hufflepuffs in between tended to work with care and concentration, their NEWTs a constant threat hanging over their head. A few well-placed questions aside, the lesson left him void of both an occupation and an outlet. He managed to take off a few points for indecent behavior, when he found two students snogging openly directly in the corridor in front of the lab, but it lacked the usual satisfaction, when he knew that right after a probably subpar lunch he had to go back to give Potter another dose.
The medi-witch raised her brows, knowing full well he was on first name base with both. “Involvement of the aurors might have caused a stir, but there are other options...” Though she was not a member of the Order of Phoenix she suspected at least some. But he still shook his head.
Harry still nods. “Please.”
Malfoy's voice tickles in his ear, his usually impeccable hair falling all over Harry's face. It takes him a long time to understand, what the blonde says; that he actually talks to him.
It was devastating. Ron Weasley in the Infirmary, hit by an unknown kind of strong magic, though on his way to full recovery. The whole House of Gryffindor once again in full opposition to Potter for “what he did to Ron”. Draco not present in Slytherin because of “more pressing matters”. And Potter...
“Talk to me” he demanded, less loud than insistent, and Potter obliged, telling him, sometimes barely coherent, how all of this affected him, while Draco happily bit and kissed and licked, caressed and pinched and tickled. He had him in sobs, before the tempus charm went off.
The universe as a whole must have gone slightly mad, because Harry feels himself nod, fully relaxed, yet hungry for more. For time outside of his grid, for... whatever is there for him. More than slightly mad actually, he realizes, as he feels bindings appear around his hands and neck, the feeling, though more than a bit unsettling shooting right into his cock.
Severus saw the quick swipe of his fingers over Potter's arm, soothing, reassuring, but he doubted anyone else would have noticed. Voldemort certainly didn't. “Rise, my faithful servant,” he commanded with radiant glee, his eyes all but devouring both boys with predatory intensity.
“You will figure it out eventually, Draco. You have time now. Assuming the dear party guests don't try to make me the next Dark Lord and start bickering between themselves instead.” Severus gave a reassuring nod and continued: “My bet is on the latter.”
It distracted him in such ways that he not only failed to punish all visible misdemeanors, but also found himself faced as suddenly as unpleasantly with the infamous and inconvenient Ms. Granger.
Unfortunately no other candidates presented themselves easily either. Those, Potter had been friendly with, wouldn't appreciate seeing behind the heroic mask... and a mask was all, his defiance had been, Severus now acknowledged in horror. The others might very well use Potter's unprecedented weakness to end him completely.
Potter seemed equally astonished and eyed the whole room cautiously only ever glancing at the whips, canes and other instruments of torture. Draco understood that very well. He had an ambiguous relationship with those as well, although they were certainly preferable to the Cruciatus curse.
A glass is pressed against his lips and he notices, he is thirsty, drinks, forgets about it, the moment, it disappears, the body heavy, down to the eyelids, no need to move, no need to think, no need to fight the darkness taking him.
He knows, he can't take it, is still sore from the first time around, knows, he shouldn't wish for it, but he wants, wants... so badly. Malfoy's voice slowly stabs through the haze of his mind. “God, you are good, so good, Harry. Just relax and take it. So perfect.”
Severus was contended when the owl went of, and returned to the infirmary where Potter sat in disturbingly motionless silence after Poppy had finished with him. When Severus entered, he looked up, the face failing to conceal the depth of his despair.
“Or we figure out a combination of spells. We have to assume he made more than just you and the diary. We can bind them all together and destroy them at once.”
“I would prefer not to inform anyone unnecessarily. Not in such personal matters.”
There now, he found something truly magical, not its mere remnants. Under the floorboards in a small confinement stinking of decay he found a paper folded like a map, adorned with a few dark brown stains of dried blood. When he took it out, his fingers brushed over some fabric, his eyes could not see, and he gasped in surprise. This had to be the cloak Potter deemed so important, then, Shaking it out and watching or rather not watching it, he could not help but agree. Such was a valuable possession that explained so much about Potter's misdeeds in the previous years. An invisibility cloak of unseen quality...
Malfoy's strange mixture of care and torture, tenderness and brutality is intoxicating, just hurts so good. There is no way to say no to him, not even, when he asks, only a whisper in Harry's ear, Harry's stomach, Harry's lap. “Again?”
Draco seemed fond of this development as well, as it allowed him to sit with Potter in the far more comfortable living room, instead of the storage room. They now both occupied Severus' armchairs, his godson with dignified posture, the Potter boy pulling his legs protectively up to his body most of the time. The glasses, specifically fitted for Potter's needs, were another level of freedom. It was not as obvious as the other two but if one paid attention, one would see how his reading speed increased and how he took social cues much easier than before. The last needed piece of the puzzle arrived at the very moment. Severus was informed to open his floo, so his guest could get into his quarters unseen and undisturbed.
The official curriculum of Hogwarts did not feature them, so he would need to give Ms. Granger's annoyingly insistent and accurate research abilities something to latch on. Once set on the path she would surely figure out what they were. And also that they did not aim to keep malevolent energies out but in. The only wager in his plan was if the infamously nosy young witch would figure it out in time to prevent Potter's return to his dorms.
“That.” Potter pointed. “How do we do that?”
Potter sagged, the pained tension in his body flowing away and leaving the only peace fate would grant him.
It was a good thing Draco was not paying attention, caught in his own thoughts, or he would have noticed Severus staring in shock. The wards had triggered. Potter had released some kind of Dark Magic. He would need to analyze this further, but luckily the hints did not point to purposeful use just yet.
Seeing this alone was already torture.
All three share a silent, knowing laughter, but it is Draco who answers as Harry still rarely ever speaks when there is nothing to say, nothing to see. “Tell them thanks, but we are quite busy as it is.” And they are. He knows. Between their own kids, caring for abandoned or mistreated wizarding children, both pure-blood and muggleborn, and campaigning for decent protection laws, the rest is fully dedicated to each other. And he is happy for it. One can't hold a grudge forever.
The boy allowed it, sighing in resignation. “Yes, Madam.” When he looked up, meeting her questioning gaze, she froze again. She had seen it, too, and wasn't good at hiding.
Potter's hands fell down and he rubbed the chaffed wrists. “Perhaps we... could try the bed, next time?”
Part of Severus wished, he could let him off with that. But he had barely scratched the surface. Stabilizing his hold on Potter he cast again, feeling how the smaller body staggered.
Draco was too scared to produce more than the thinnest veneer of anger. “Then, what do you want? Why would you let me in on this? You can't seriously expect me to help you with
-oOo-
He could lie for all his life, just marveling in the feeling of long-fingered hands petting the hair behind his ears, pale skin, reflecting the warmth of his breath back to him, an arm around his back, resting loosely at his waist, small kisses to his crown, barely there, yet never-ending.
Blaise's brow furrows, just when a soft thud can be heard, but before he understands, Theo casts an Expelliarmus. It is by no means a match to Potter's – the irony, really – but it is enough. Blaise's wand goes flying, landing somewhere in the grass, neigh untraceable without magic in the poor light of the moon.
She did not find the right comparison, and Severus helped out: “As if something is robbing his strength away?”
Throwing a last pensive gaze at his two wards, Severus stood up, nearing Olivander, and informed him: “The payment will be allocated from Gringots within the next two days. Thank you for your time, Mr. Olivander.”
“That being relevant, because?”
On instinct Severus grabbed his wand, pointing at the slowly reviving body. Suddenly, stirring Draco from his grievous stupor, the boy raised his hand, the right unblemished one, Severus noted. “Don't...” he pleaded, the voice warm and soft, but with hoarse edges, that would never leave him again.
“I cannot say. It depends.”
Wand. Potter's wand, famous for holly and phoenix.
With Gryffindor courage and little grace, Potter pulls robes and shirts over his head, not bothering with separating it from the undergarments. The worn out edge, Theodore notices tells a lot about the why, although the conclusions again, do not fit his picture of the perfect Potter. It's nice though. Somehow, it makes him more relatable. As does the sheepish, jerky motion, when he pulls his pants down and balances on one leg to pull them of the other, socks and all. The low lighting compliments him, creates shadows on his skin, leaving everything to imagination and creating the wish to explore with fingers, what the eyes can't make out. It's a pity he slips between the blankets with abashed hurry.
Malfoy only makes it better, adds pleasure to the pain, small kisses to the bites, his hands caressing and pinching and clawing their way over his body. Harry tries to turn his head, his body enough for a kiss, pleading wordlessly, and Malfoy grants it generously, the kiss tender in all the ways, the rest of his touches aren't. As if he was pouring real love, real emotion into this, as if he wanted Harry to stay. As if this wasn't just... sex. And he wants this, wants this so badly in this very minute, wants to forget, who this is, who he is, anything but what they are doing.
Severus shrugged. “I told you a lot of things. But you weren't listening. No matter what you want, no matter what you decide in the end, it never hurts to have a good view on your enemies. And to keep in mind that you can be stabbed from
and he alone would finish Potter often enough. But he did not have the time and his fury was getting the better of him a lot lately. “Don't you dare!” he yelled instantly, throwing a wordless crucio at Severus.
Severus shrugged. “If you will allow it I shall arrange for precautions on this matter.” Albus would not, of course. Yet. Severus had planned ahead. “Or any other member of the staff, able to handle this kind of problems...”
he probably deserves.” He did not let himself get distracted by the nervous squeal from that pile of useless flesh and fat.
Theo actually rises to study that sight some more, still doubting his eyes, as that was something he never believed to happen. Potter half draped over Draco, the eyes drooping, the body melted into full relaxation, and his friend protectively closing an arm around the dark-haired boy. It pretty much sums up, what Theo knew that neither of them would ever, ever admit, even to themselves.
Of course, and it was always like that, Severus could not remain undisturbed. He was barely starting to dive deeper into the matter when someone knocked at the door. Annoyed he covered the most obvious hints of what he was working on and marked the pages of all the books with a wave of his wand before returning them to their places in the shelves. Getting up he then unlocked the door, facing the probably least appreciated company for the moment. “Albus...”
Potter was just relieved, softly caressing the wood of his new wand, whose only decoration was his smoothness, stripped of anything unessential, just like himself. Draco looked strangely proud, as if it had been his achievement to find the new companion for his... friend?
“He?” Severus asked, ashamed of the superstitious shiver running over his back. He wasn't sure he wanted an answer.
Just like the distorted mirror image of Dumbledore who also only acknowledged what he wanted to hear Voldemort grinned, the snakish lips spread impossibly wide. “I shall test your promises and reward you befitting to their outcome.”
He lowers his head, awaiting the inevitable jeering, but it won't come. Draco and Theo exchange another look, ranging between predatory and alarmed. “I'll do the wards” Draco offers, and Theo nods. It is better that way. He needs to reassure their newest bed partner, or they will lose him, before this even goes somewhere. Which would be a real waste, honestly. Another kiss, then he gives Potter a reassuring smile. “Kind of hard to find someone, with all the things going on in your life, hm?”
The headmaster strolled in, greeting with a nod. “I was informed the visitations of Harry went less than ideal...”
In hindsight it seemed no wonder, Potter had never paid him any mind beyond a mutual antipathy. What did a gruff scolding or unpleasant detention matter against this? Granted, never before had Potter been in a similar state, but incidents like this rarely came out of thin air and the signs had all been there. If he had not chosen to ignore them.
Severus curiosity was now in full reign. “And from others?”
Draco studied his nemesis of years closely and took his sweet time, stretching the uneasiness into a small eternity, before he finally demanded: “Strip.” He paused, easing then: “To the waist.” Potter's sigh of relief was a first, sweet victory.
Severus shook his head in unease and refused to open this specific brand of Pandora's box. Standing up empty-handed, he doused the light and headed for bed, throwing only a last glance at the boy.
Severus closed in, well aware he confined the boy to the smallest of spaces. “All of them. The burst of Dark Magic. The pain under your skin. The visits of my godson. The events of the summer. Voldemort. All of them.”
Just so you know, the number of chapters is not yet clear, because I didn't decide yet, if I will put some of the later ones together. The story IS truly finished.
I thought about it long and hard. And give you the last chapter now. The finish, the closure.
Softly, softly, he positions himself, above Harry, every little distance too much already, leaving Harry empty and cold, pushes, even more careful than the last time, making the burn hurt, worse than if he just shoved in. Harry gasps, cries out.
It took Draco some time to realize Severus would not budge, even more of it to gather his things and leave for the small sickroom, but then Severus was alone with his thoughts again. And again, he decided to busy himself with work. It was a rather feeble attempt though, as his thoughts drifted back to the boys in the storage room, whenever they could, which left him in unrest, until he gave in and went to check on the two.
Theodore eyes him quizzically and nods then, still disgruntled. “Fine. I talk to the house elves to get us some breakfast for later. And you...” He scowls some. “You take care of Potter. This isn't over, you know?”
He agreed without reservation. “Have you run a full check again?”
Olivander clapped his hands in pure enjoyment and shouted: “Ha! I should have known. Yew, of course. Resurrection, reincarnation, how befitting you. And unicorn hair. Innocence, strength, a strong connection with the light!” Neither of the boy's shared the wandmaker's elation.
He re-entered his quarters, ready to move Potter and curious, what situation he would find. He was not disappointed in receiving an unpleasant surprise, as Draco and Potter sat as close as necessary to share one book - on the floor, no less - for his armchairs discouraged such proximity. The former disengaged from an embrace with the latter, just as he entered, carefully training his face not to look even remotely guilty.
This was by far more important than Albus or Minerva's attempts to delay the inevitable at any cost. Potter would die, and all he and everyone else involved could do was making it worth his while. It seemed he needed to talk to both of them...
Everyone assumed his toneless, dry voice was a sign of nervousness, maybe even excitement, but Severus knew Draco was holding onto his composure by the skin of his teeth. Better to bring this to its closure quickly.
“They burned it” Potter exhaled, biting his lip in an image of loss. “Broom, too, school supplies, books.” The shadows of grief deepened, albeit Severus had never taken Potter as materialistic. Quite the contrary in fact.
Potter scowled. “I'll do it. He needs to pay. When I am... done... Someone kill that bastard for me, will you? So he can never come back again?”
“You could hand him over. Portkeys are not that hard to come by,” Draco suggested. Heatedly? Eagerly? Desperately?
She confirmed it. “Of both kids. “She handed him the files, uncomfortable with talking about it openly when everyone could walk in at any time. “It was more mortifying than dangerous this time.” She spoke softly and added: “There might however be still a lot of bone splinters we don't know about and which might get dislodged at any time.”
When he finally got to got to his feet, heading for the door, Severus stopped him a last time. “And Potter?” The boy threw his head back as if silently praying, but did not turn his face. “For what it is worth: I do not wish for you to die.”
Severus shrugged and continued his way, coming up with not a single other student to add to the list. Though there were some who were not quite students. Which reminded him. He changed his path and made his way to meet Poppy at the infirmary. She most certainly already knew what happened and made her own assumptions. Discussing with her might prove helpful.
He looked up again, the green in his eyes radiant as ever, the face withdrawn.
You have been warned, this is getting dark, welcome to the rabbit hole.
He is more clever than they thought, too, learns from them just by watching. Surprises Theo with just the perfect little bite at the bottom of his throat, licking over the initial hurt, his wild hair tickling all over Theo's neck. And his hands... God. Theo knows, Quidditch is good for those, Draco can do things, most people can't, a strength in them, only flying can train. But Potter is the equally gifted and so generous, so keen on giving as much as he takes, far from Draco's intelligent egotism.
“Do you want more?” His breath feels warm and damp and wonderful. “Will you allow me to have all of you?”
Only then Severus lifted him back onto the cot, cast a quick healing spell to halt the flow of blood and covered him with the blanket again. Now, without the help of a levitation spell, the sudden revelation of Potter's much too low weight hit him. Vaguely he could recall earlier irritations along the same lines, but none so distinct that it stuck and forced him into action. How long had he suspected, what he knew now? How long had he allowed himself to be lulled into ignorance by Albus' idle chatter?
No, he probably imagined that part, but it feels to good to question it just now, so he just lets sensations wash over him, takes and takes and takes. He doesn't even try to come just now, the need somehow subdued by the completeness of the whole experience. He doesn't urge on, doesn't assume, doesn't pressure. Just takes. And Malfoy gives, his movements strong and controlled, his face a mask of concentration, of need. Only, when he speeds up, his movements erratic and almost feral, the same longing hits Harry full force, makes him want to touch himself, makes him aware again, taking in reality from a different perspective, the hushed, fast breathing at their side, Theo watching, the strain in his shoulders from the hands behind his back, the pounding, dull ache within him, irrelevant, for all he cares, but still there. The pure, primal need for release.
When Potter stirs between them, he wakes again, just in time to look into owlish green eyes, more than slightly confused by the scenery and company.
Potter nodded in resignation. “I figured.” Tried then valiantly to hid his sorrow. “A good thing then, I am still here.” At this point he lost the battle against the tears as he continued: “You might want to lock the door though. Avoids... incidents.” The expressionless voice, the lack of attempts to hide the crying... Just one sentence had destroyed all progress the boy made, the fragility of his emotional state all too obvious.
Potter flinches, tries to turn, just to see, who is there. It's not that hard to guess, even in the half-darkness of the room, Draco's hair is a dead give-away. He instantly pulls away, once he realizes it, trying to get out of the bed without hurting Theo. How considerate, really, how unhelpful too. He stops him right there with another kiss, then whispers into his ear. “No outside hostilities, remember? Just fun. Think of it as a truce. You won't talk, he won't talk, everything is fine.” As if by accident, Theo's fingers glide down Potter's body, not quite touching his prick, just now.
Blaise gives a mocking laugh. “Yeah... your precious honor. Draco started with the same shit, before I knocked him out. Won't gain you any privileges with the Dark Lord, though, will it?” He is positively screaming now, attracting attention...
“I see that now” Albus admitted none too repentantly. “But you are clearly atop the situation.”
“Draco.” He stood up, took the boy by his sleeve and guided him towards his study, where he ordered him to sit down. Only, when they both were seated, he started to really speak. “I see, you have noticed, why I summoned you here today.” His exhale and face gave no hints on his intentions, no leverage, if the Dark Lord ever got hold of this specific memory.
“Valid point, Mr. Potter” Severus granted. “Off you go.”
Arriving at Potter's room Severus became aware of the whole measure of damage done. He found Draco and Potter lying side by side on the cot. Both were fully dressed, if this was a consolation, the former looking much too content, the latter guilty, his voice hoarse and raw as in the first days. The smell of potions, magic and ozone lingered in the air.
Potter shakes his head. “That's not it, really... It's just...” He breathes out, leaving all his explanations to imagination. They might talk later... Once he can trust, they won't tell. It will be okay. For now, it is more important to get him back on track. “Want something from me?” Theo can sound quite seductive, if he just wants to. And with Potter still looking reluctant, insecure, he just massages his shoulders carefully, breathing soft kisses over his chest, smiling all the time, until Draco is back too.
It was to no avail as Potter lost his fight for composure bit by bit. Making himself sick, he inevitably leaned onto the cot heavily, swaying. Some kids in that state responded well to a well-placed slap. The sudden shock pulled them out of their stupor and made them responsive again, willing and above all
For now he took a shower, changed into his teaching robes and started to grade essays on his desk, until he saw Draco stir. He figured, his recall of the evening would be more telling, if harder to obtain, than Potter's pain-clouded version. So he invited his godson to take breakfast with him, instead of in the Great Hall due to the special circumstances.
Potter was shy about it, pretended it wasn't there just as much as Severus himself. Draco... wasn't. In contrary he almost seemed to throw it into Severus' face, defiance his last line of defense against the slowly unfolding fate.
Severus sighed. If the means did not justify the ends anymore, if he could not allow himself such thinking, what did it lead to? And how was he to avoid Potter's far too early full return?
expected next to nothing more from life and was utterly devastated.
Weasley's face was already beetroot red, when the Slytherin noticed him and couldn't help but pour oil into the fire by throwing a smug grin at him. Weasley did not disappoint. Screaming a chain of profanities only secondarily directed at Draco he stomped towards them, balling his fists in a vivid picture of barely contained aggression.
The Weasleys were sick with worry, Lupin's permanent nagging at the Order's meeting a misery, Dumbledore kept pacing in his office like a caged tiger, until making a decision and sending him – him of all people – to go and collect the brat.
Potter nods doubtfully, asking, barely audibly: “What now?”
Then the wait began. While Voldemort paced they all sat still, hoping the young Malfoy would appear before the Dark Lord lost his temper and made one of them his first aim. There was a think chance of that, in reality. Severus knew exactly how long the path from the dungeons to a place outside the wards took him. Dragging and carrying along Potter writhing in pain, Draco would take even longer.
Severus grit his teeth. “You will join me in my study later.”
“And what then, will you gladly follow his decent into madness, kill and torture and rape for him? Do you have it in you to completely ignore, you are after all still a human being, capable of softer emotion: fondness, compassion, love even?”
Potter nods, throwing his head back with a groan. “Yes.. please...”
A few days after Harry's sixteenth birthday people got nervous. Three weeks after his birthday they began to ask questions. One month after the date everyone felt, something was completely wrong. One month and a day it became painfully obvious: Harry Potter had not returned to Hogwarts. The boy who lived was missing.
Theo weighs his head, and Draco laughs.
First he needed sleep though. It wouldn't do to wake the boys up and, after the meeting with the Dark Lord and his followers, he had no patience left for teenage complications, not even second hand.
Potter nodded once more, eyes closed, unable to will his body into relaxation. Severus understood that. Of all people few could fathom what choice he had made, and now Potter was definitely one of them, going through something so similar. End an unhappy life with terrible things in it on an even more unhappy note just for the sake of others.
Potter nodded, his nervousness finally getting the better of him and his voice therefore failing. Slowly, hesitantly, he removed his wand from his pocket and placed it on a nearby drawer. Another nod served as signal to begin.
To call the last day and a half a catastrophe of epic measures would in Severus opinion still have been an understatement. From the moment Potter had left his rooms everything that could go wrong had. It started with Minerva's insistence not to restrict the visits of Potter strictly to Ms. Granger as Severus had suggested after the incident with the Weasley boy. Of course it would give her a prominent and privileged position among the Gryffindor students but the same was true for visits to the Infirmary and those were with reason restricted to the closest friends under Madam Pomphrey's strict reign. To make it worse Minerva wouldn't exclude Ron Weasley from the visitors, because “he had done nothing wrong.” Shouting profanities at a classmate in the corridors obviously didn't count in Gryffindor definitions of wrong.
Still feeling pressed by a certain sense of urgency he left Potter with the medi-witch for the check on bone splinters and went to the owlery, conjuring a quick message for Lucius Malfoy and sending it off. It usually paid to be polite to pure-bloods, the higher up the ladder, the more. Lucius was especially susceptible to that, his pride and ambition always present and getting the better of him.
He allowed himself a small weakness however, and went to get a blanket to wrap it around Draco's body, half sitting, half lying on the cot, closer to Potter than Severus found comfortable.
Harry nods some more, willing himself into silence, where he wants to beg, wants to submit, wants to... Hell, he has lost all contact with reality, he knows, but just now, reality has not much to offer, while this, this... feels so good, like he didn't in ages, maybe ever.
“Whose?”
Determinedly he stepped back, nodding at the boys and frowning just to conceal his implicit permission. “I shall go and start preparing. There is no say how much time we will have.”
In long strides he headed towards the main entry and then the reception room Voldemort had taken up as his own. Of course Severus was the last one to arrive and of bloody course Voldemort made his dissatisfaction with his lateness known. He did not extend the lesson for too long however, as he was curious what Severus would have to report.
Since then Potter flinched each time he entered the room, each time he needed to touch him, valiantly fighting off the memory of his complete helplessness and pain.
Hiding anger, disgust, self-loathing as he always did, Severus bowed lightly. “Summon him, and he will bring you the Potter boy, incapacitated and weak, ready for your final retribution.” And for a change not a single word had been a lie...
There was none. Now that even the headmaster with his very questionable standards had been unable to come up with another Defense teacher than Severus himself, none could both handle outbreaks of Dark Magic and have the time to supervise the boy in any relevant fashion.
He dipped his chin slightly, content with the sensible arrangement. This ordeal probably had been rather exhausting for the medi-witch and preserving her strength was of great importance especially in the current situation.
Severus was even more impressed by Potter's resolve now. He of all people knew of the terrible death that particular venom promised. And he still offered.
It is enough to make him believe, enough to make him go on. He bottoms out in one slow shove and exhales in surprise. Harry is still so lose, so well prepared, so willing. They both feel it, both can't stop now, forget about he world around him, as they meet and part, meet and part. Harry doesn't hold back, whimpers and cries, Malfoy tells him, how good it feels, tells him, how perfect they fit together, tells him, he loves this... loves him...
Theo holds him back, before he can. As good as Draco is with his body, his gab has never brought him any plus points. He chimes in, murmuring almost tenderly. “He is right, Harry, let us take care of you. Relax, all is right. And you can stop it at any time. Okay?” When Potter hesitates, he gives him another reassuring look, adding a tiny sting: “You should manage at least as well as Finchley-Fletcher, should you? He was a bit anxious too...”
Severus stared speechless until Potter was back in his seat, huddled again, looking cold and lonesome. “What by Merlin's...”
Unsurprisingly he was already in quite a mood, when he arrived at number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging and knocked at the door. It did not get any better, when no reaction followed, not on his first nor the second or third knock. Frowning he opened the door with a swift Alohomora and stepped in, finding the house completely silent and void of its inhabitants, at least as far as he could tell. The rooms were bare of any signs of living, the furniture covered in protective sheets. The smell of abandon had not yet set in, so this seemed to be a recent development. He would have to ask the neighbors where the brat and his irresponsible muggle caregivers had gone.
