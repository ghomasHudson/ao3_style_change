Remus lay snuggled next to Severus on the settee in their room while watching their son play on the floor. Fenrir sat in a chair across from them lost in thought. Just moments ago he and Severus took a pensive dive into Greyback’s memories. He wasn’t sure if the cub he saw in the memories was him or not, but one thing was positive, the Ministry had to be stopped.
“I now have all the ingrediants I need.” Hermione tucked the strand into a vial, sealed it and placed the vial in her pocket.
Severus sniggered at the disheveled look of his one time nemesis, “He won’t eat cereal, he likes pancakes and eggs.”
Lily stood up and went to James linking her arm through his elbow. Licius turned to Tom as the man was about to get up, “Tom, I think that it would be best for you to remain here. I don’t think that Black would appreciate your appearance as of yet.”
“Well then, you might want to go rescue them, last I saw James was covered in milk and Sirius had cereal clinging to his hair.”
“We will find them. I need to see Malfoy, you might as well come with me. He could have an idea as to who might be behind this. There are other things in play as well.”
“When a magical being, Fae in this instance, bond with their mate it connects them on a spiritual and mental level. If one dies so too will the other. Soul mates is the closest reference for you. The magic binds them together and pulls the other with the deceased mate so they are together in both life and death.” Harry explained.
“We can enlist Madame Pomphrey’s aid. Possibly use it as a checkup. Muggles have all sorts of drugs that could contaminate out magical core. We call all muggleborn and muggle-raised children to the hospital wing and take a blood sample. Then use the Heritage potion.”
“Madam, how do you know that name?” his voice had a hiss to it, almost as if he was a snake. She wondered if he’d gotten stuck in a half animagus transformation. Then what he said caught her attention.
Tom glanced at the irate wolf, “There is no one else, Greyback. James and Lily have to stay hidden, Sirius is still considered a fugitive and Gellert is too frail that Albus will not leave him.”
Tom signaled Licius and together they went down into the darkest depths of the prison. They came upon many cells with prisoners that were so far gone that they were mindless husks. A few more cell over and Lucius called out.
When he had gone into labor and gave birth to his and Albus’ child she was taken away before he ever saw a glimpse of her.
Harry slapped him on the arm, “Hey, Gryffindor’s present! So what about all the others? I mean there are at least twenty Muggleborns at Hogwarts now. Are you saying that they are all from Pureblood families?”
Sirius smiled, “I gave Harry my two-way mirror. He should have it on or near him.” Hew pulled the other half of the mirror out of his pocket and said the activation word. The mirror began to glow blue and Sirius called out, “Harry! Harry, answer the mirror!”
After about ten minutes Hermione seemed to calm down and she sat up, still wrapped in Blaise’s arms. She wiped the tears from her face as she took in the sight of her best friend and cousin.
“A drop of your blood will be sufficient Miss Granger.” He pulled out a small paring knife from his robes and handed it to her, hilt first.
Lucius dared to look at his lord, “I have been thinking about this ever since we found out about Miss Granger. I believe that the Ministry has done this for the single purpose of creating dissention among the bloodlines. There have always been ‘light’ and ‘dark’ minded families, what if the ‘light’ families, wanting to thin our bloodlines, stole our children, placing them with muggles and when they come to our schools we purebloods scorn them for their ‘impure’ blood, thus reducing our chance of continuing our families blood. I can think of no other alternative, nothing else fits. They are trying to wipe us out by making us the ‘bad guys’ when we just want our families to live on.”
Hermione swallowed hard and gave a infinitesimal nod. Bellatrix lept to her feet and grabbed her daughter in a fierce hug crying, “My daughter, my Rosie.”
Sirius stood off to the side watching the man who James said was his lover. Who blood tests show he’d had a child with. Said child who is fourteen years old, whom he’d never watched grow up, never saw his first steps. In all honesty that was his whole problem with this. His child grew up with muggles, never knowing his family legacy. Not that he really cared much for his own parents, but the Black’s were still a well respected family with a long history. Hell, he never even got to name his child when he was ripped from him. They took that all away from him.
Pairings: Hermione/Blaise; Harry/Draco; Bellatrix/Rodolphus; Lucius/Narcissa; Severus/Remus; James/Lily, Tom/Sirius, Albus/Gellert, Fenrir/Tala (Native American, means wolf)
The door clicked and swung wide revealing Severus… and a young woman who looked intent on stalking him.
He glanced around the room and was surprised to see the Headmaster standing at the doorway to the main sitting room, his arm wrapped around that of a thin and sickly looking man who looked to have spent decades in Azkaban. He spotted his father talking to a tall dark haired man. He walked over and almost fell in shock as he recognized that face on the other man.
“She died, almost ten years ago. As I was saying her name was Toriana Forgan. She had quite a resume, and seemed to fit right in with the staff here. She was a very skilled midwife. It was actually her preferred occupation. She regularly made house calls, especially when the expectant mother was on bedrest or were high risk pregnancies.”
Quietly the four of them observed as the Unicorn mare brought a new life into the world. Hagrid leaned down and whispered to Hermione, “Walk as calm as you can holding your hands out to the side and approach her. If she nods her head you may take your one hair. Make sure it is just one. The best place would be from the mane.”
Hermione and Harry both glanced at each other in confusion but sat with their prospective boyfriends.
Tom looked at him curiously, “And what is that ‘startling information’ Lucius that has you so stressed that you drop your usual mask.”
Rosalind Druella Lestrange (aka Hermione Jane Granger) lay on her bed staring at the ceiling trying to come to terms with everything that has happened within the last month. First she brews a Bloodline potion and finds out that she’s not Muggleborn but a Pureblood, the daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange no less, second was that all Muggleborns are actually Purebloods, Harry’s mother being one, and third said mother and spouse are alive. She still hadn’t figured out how that was possible. She wished she knew if her adoptive parents were in on this conspiracy or not.
Now here he was in one of the most expensive homes he’d ever seen and no one had called him a mudblood. He sighed wearily. Dennis was asleep on the enormous bed, wiped out from everything that’s happened over the last two months.
A moan came from the woman and she began to stir. He pulled his wand just in case. She opened her eyes slowly and turned to see the figure beside her. Her mouth moved as she said the mans name in a inaudible whisper. She turned to look about the room frowning in confusion at the strangness of it and spotted him standing at the end of the bed.
Severus came into view of the mirror so he could speak to his godson, “Draco, I’m here with Dumbledore at the Manor.”
Fenrir sighed, “I suppose when we find the answer to that we will also find the answer to why they are taking pureblood children as well. The Ministry has a lot to answer to.”

“What’s is this? Some kind of joke, Cissa? You really think that I’d fall for this charade?! Is this some kind of ploy to get me to join you and him. If it is, then you’ve failed. I’ll not join you, and I’ll especially not join HIM.” Sirius threw the pages at her and got up storming out of the room.
Bringing himself back to the present he flicked his wand and unlocked all the cages and released the children. There were about twelve of them ranging in ages from ten down to just a month old. The oldest child looked at him fearfully.
A/N: There is no MAIN PAIRING!! The story is about all of them! Albus/Gellert are Lily’s parents, Bella/Rodolphus are Hermione’s parents, Fenrir/Tala are Remus’ parents
She froze at the door, her hand on the door handle. “I’ll think about it sir.” She rushed out the door before she could change her mind.
A/N: There is no MAIN PAIRING!! The story is about all of them! Albus/Gellert are Lily’s parents, Bella/Rodolphus are Hermione’s parents, Fenrir/Tala are Remus’ parents
The man came back down, a blanket wrapped around what he carried. Remus caught the new scent and threw his head back and howled, letting his wolf come foreward. His bonds snapped just a Umbridge threw another curse at him. He lept to the side and it flew past him. But one thrown by one of her men hit him and he fell crying out in pain.
While everyone was out rescuing Snape, James was trying to prevent his wife from going to her sisters house and killing her, along with her obese husband. In all honesty he felt the same way but he knew that until their friends regained their memories he would be without support. The ministry could just very well take them back to Azkaban or even just outright kill them.
Harry groaned as he woke and it alerted the person sitting next to him. His glasses were handed to him as he sat up. Putting them on he glanced at the person.
Disclaimer: I don’t own Harry Potter nor do I make any money from this story, Just having some fun with the Characters
Looking about the room for any indication of where she was at and she spotted the man at the end of the bed. He looked odd to her, but with the shadows it was hard to make out why. But she knew him, no other man she knew can pull off that stance.
Severus pulled out of Tom’s mind and frowned, “It is not an Obliviate. It’s more like a block has been placed over the memories.”
Harry spoke up from where he sat, “What do we know of that almost every witch and wizard have contact with?” Everyone turned to look at him, “The Daily Profit. Very few people don’t get the Profit. What if the spell or potion was on the paper?”
Severus turned to the girl. “Sierra, come. This is my mate, Remus. We can take you out of here. Out where you can run free in the forest. Remember, I told you about the forest?”
Ron Weasley was annoyed. He’d looked all over the school and Harry and Hermione were nowhere to be found. He was sure to get it when the others found out. Making his way up to the Headmistress office he barked out the password and stomped up the stairs.
Severus smiled, “Daddy is sleeping and will wake very soon, but for now how about I make you breakfast?”
She cocked her head to the side, “Wolf changes…” she looked away from him thinking, then turned back to him, “I am 269 wolf changes. That makes me 22 years and 5 wolf changes.”
Minerva groaned, “I remember something that Albus once told me. Many of the Pureblood children have emergency portkey’s that transport them home. We should have confiscated them all, Delores.”
She spotted a few potential ones that she thought would be challenging as she flipped pages. As she got to the back of the book, the last potion in it popped out at her.
Tom cleared his throat, “We can determine all that later. The most important part right now is restoring our memories. I for one would be glad to know that I’m not a cold blooded killer. We need to find out how our memories were altered and try to restore them.”
But Neville Longbottom was not weak. With the help of his friends he was stronger than his family ever thought. And he was not stupid either. The school was whispering. The students were afraid.
Albus glanced at the Malfoy’s, “It would take a very powerful spell to transfer a child from one mother to another. Either one very powerful wizard or several linked together. And the only way to link would be through a certain artifact, which I know for a fact the Ministry is in possession of.”
“Fenrir is the Alpha of his pack, if there is a chance of getting more of the wolves away he needs to go with you. We don’t know how the other wolves will react to a sudmissive’s presence. Having an alpha with you will not hurt.” Tom told the Black Lord. Internally he was wondering what had drawn him to the over-excitable man. “Go and get some sleep, especially you Remus, your link to Severus through your mating bond will help you find him faster.”
The burn in his arm felt good in comparison to the nightmare he’d woken up from. Rememberace of his summer with the Dursley’s. He gritted his teeth as both tears and blood flowed.
“Of course, I actually have a few bottles. I had them brewed a few years after Draco was born. Cissa was pregnant again, but lost the child…” He trailed off at the reminder. Clearing his throat he call a house elf to get the potion. Then they all left, Severus back to Hogwarts and the Malfoy’s to St. Mungo’s.
Tom glanced at the werewolf and nodded. He then noticed the girl hovering nearby and raised an eyebrow at Fenrir. “Who is she?”
Draco sighed and kissed him lightly, “I know Harry, but it’s the only way out of Hogsmeade since we are all too young to Apparate.”
She sneered at him, “No, he is not and you will tell me where he went, now!” and she flicked her wand at Remus who screamed in pain.
The broken man beside him clung to him as they made their way into the house. Albus went to the least ruined part of the house, the kitchen, and sat Gellert on a bench near the table. He suppressed a shudder as his memories assailed him. With a wave of his wand he cast a general scourgify around the room. It was a little better. He glanced at the man sitting huddled on the bench.
Arriving back at his hotel Harry gave the door a quick knock and it opened from inside. A blond head appeared around the door.
Pairings: Hermione/Blaise; Harry/Draco; Bellatrix/Rodolphus; Lucius/Narcissa; Severus/Remus; James/Lily, Tom/Sirius, Albus/Gellert, Fenrir/Tala (Native American, means wolf)
“Ok, I’m confused Tom. Let’s start from that Halloween night and what you remember of it.” James spoke in.
Lily pulled back and looked at the other man seated on the couch. She knelt down in front of him and smiled as she gazed into his eyes. Gellert lifted a trembling hand to her cheek, his face full of wonder.
“We will figure that all out eventually, Harry. For now I want you to rest.” Lily looked around them room noticing someone missing, “Where is Draco?”
Lily moaned, “Great, I wake up not too long ago thinking my baby is still a baby, only to find out that he’s sixteen and already dating! Can the day get any worse?”
Ever since the Headmaster disappeared Professor Umbridge has wreaked havoc with the system. She’d fired Professor Trelawney and Hagrid. Their replacements were more Ministry idiots.
Harry bit his lip and making up his mind rushed to Draco’s side and quickly straddling his lap. “Please Draco, Snape is back and I want you! Make me forget about my uncle!”
Albus stared at the man in shock. Here he was in the same room and Tom Riddle and the man is being very polite to everyone, even going as far as letting them say his real name.
“Mr. Weasley, I hope you have a good reason for being here? You were supposed to be with Potter and Granger.” Umbridge inquired.
Hermione nodded and stepped forward slowly hands spread.  When she was two yards away the mare turned her head towards her gazing into her eyes. Hermione did not blink as she felt… something… probe her mind, then it was gone and the mare gave a single nod of her head, her spiraled horn bobing with the motion.
Goodbye’s were said, tearful in Bella’s case, and the four teens made their way back to the entry where their portkey activated in reverse taking them to the exact spot they left.
Then one day as they lay in front of the fire in the Room of Requirement Draco gathered his courage and kissed Harry. It was soft and sweet and Harry loved it.
Umbridge sniffed, “Well, what’s done is done, let us hope that the Master doesn’t hear about this. Let’s try and get them back shall we, hmm.”
“No, I believe things to be worse off than that. A mediwitch midwife delivered some babies about ten years ago and stole a few of them, letting the parents believe that the child was stillborn. I have records from the Hospital about this woman and who she took children from.”
It took Tom three days to gather enough forces to storm the facility. They were all situated around the dining room listening to the debriefing. Remus was currently explaining the layout of the compound.
About halfway further down the hall they came to a set of cells that were so cloaked in concealing charms it was a wonder that Bella even knew they were there. Tom peered into the first cell and gave a start. He heard Lucius gasp as he looked into the other cell.
Remus shied away from the first touch pulling his wand on his sire. “Severus!” he cried frantically looking around.
She smiled, “Yes, Sev, it’s me. I’m not dead. Please let me have the child. Let Cissa check you over.”
“Do you remember fifteen years ago you gave me a recommendation. I want to know the name of that mediwitch and I want to know why you recommended her.”
“We are all here for you Harry, I’m not particularly fond of portkeys either. I need you with me Harry, please?!”
When Severus Snape returned to Hogwarts he slipped down to the dungeons as unobtrusively as he could. Years of practice kept him clear of Filtch and Mrs. Norris. Snape sneered, oh how he hated that filthy squib.
Draco glanced down at Harry and the dark haired Gryffindor sat up, “I have had some news from my father. They are attacking Azkaban tonight.”
Umbridge turned as she realized that Snape was loose. She flicked her wand in his direction and hit him before he could evade the curse. He screamed, Remus screamed and the crying from upstairs grew louder as the man who went to upstairs returned, a screaming child of about two years old struggling in his grasp.
With gentle mummers of comfort he pulled Harry into his arms rocking him back and forth. Only until the heard the conductor yell that they’d arrived at Hogwarts did they realize how long they sat there on the bathroom floor.
“Gel, I need to ask you a few questions.” He pulled the other away from him and looked into vibrant green eyes. Lily’s eyes, Harry’s eyes.
They were all quiet for a while then Lily asked, “Tom, what happened to Harry after that Halloween?”
As they made their way towards the kitchen they could hear the laughter of a child and exclamations of the men. They came upon a scene of great hilarity. James and Sirius, both covered in milk and cereal, were huddled under the table as Conall, standing on the table with a spoon, would wack at them if he saw them. The boy was completely clean, no milk or cereal covered the two year old.
While he was meditating he remembered a book that held a potion that, combined with a spell, could break any memory charm. That book was in the restricted section of the Hogwarts Library. He needed to find someone willing to get into the school and retrieve the book for him… for them all.
Lucius turned back to the Healer his wand pointed at the man, “Did you know about this? Answer truthfully Jorgens.”
Sirius growled as a house elf quivered in front of him offering a drink. He hated house elves.  His own was a pestilence in his home and could not wait until it died.
Lucius swallowed, “My lord… to put it bluntly… there are no real muggleborns.” And he cringed at the Dark Lords frown.
From within his robe he pulled out his knife that he uses for cutting his potions. Slowly he pulled his sleeve back to reveal his arms. Red slashes crissed cross his arms along with older ones that were white scars. He took a deep breath and drew the knife across his skin.
Albus Dumbledore glanced at the entrance of Nurmengard Prison in trepidation. He knew he needed to do this, but it would be doubly hard to face the man after what happened.
The lady gasped as she realized she no longer felt the pain in her abdomen, “Where… where’s my baby?”
Tom stalked through the corridors looking for any stragglers. The few werewolves they’d encountered seemed hesitant in attacking the powerful Dark Lord. Two doors down he heard whimpering and crying. Slowly he pushed the door open and came upon what appeared to be a kennel, but upon closer examination he saw that it was not puppies that housed the cages, but children and babies.
Draco slowly pulled the other boy to his feet, gave him a gentle squeeze and left. No words had been said but it seemed that a sort of truce came over them. Over the course of September they met together secretly and talked. They talked of school, Quidditch,everything but the one topic, Harry’s cutting.
“We are still not sure exactly, but some of us have a theory. We believe that the ministry is trying to weed out the ‘Dark Blood’ families. By placing our children with Muggles we assume that they are Muggleborns and with the Pureblood fascism towards Muggleborns we are not breeding with our own class, thus eliminating us by breeding us out. Too much interbreeding leads to squibs and deformed children.”
Lily was sitting on a small couch in her sitting room watching her husband and his best friends. They were discussing how best to take their revenge on the Dursley’s for their treatment of her son. No matter how many times she thought about it she never would have thought that her sister was capable of the things she did to Harry. She knew that Petunia envied her her magic, but never would she have thought that it would turn to something so intense as hatred.

Lily Potter may have been sleeping through a drug induced daze for the past fourteen years but she was not blind. And she knew what her sister’s husband was like. Oh he may spout his lies about being ‘normal’ but Lily knew the truth. She knew from the first glance she had of the man and a quick glance into his mind. The man was disgusting. Preying on innocent children for pleasure. She will be visiting that man very soon, make no mistake. Her baby lived with that man and there was no doubt in her mind that he did something to him.
Hermione groaned as she opened her eyes. Her gaze fell on Snape sitting on a chair next to the sofa she was lying in. Seeing him reminded her why she was on the floor. Snape called her ‘Miss Lestrange’ and after that she promptly fainted.
Just then an owl flew in and deposited a note on his chest. Sitting up he read through the short missive:
Hermione was excited. Snape stepped up to the cauldron and inhaled the aroma, dipped the ladle in checking its consistency and gave a sharp nod.
Tom Marvolo Riddle, AKA Lord Voldemort, sneered down at Peter Pettigrew, AKA Wormtail. The man was a sniveling rat and at times Tom wondered what possessed him to allow the fool to remain.
Gellert raised his head slowly and looked into Albus’ eyes, “Al… am I really out of there? Or is this just a dream?”
“Miss L…” Snape stopped, “Miss Granger, if you would be so kind as to get up, you are late for your next class.”
He followed discreetly behind them. He wanted to know why his cub looked at him like he did. Halfway down the hall he heard a whispered conversation up ahead.
Lily and Narcissa lept to their feet just in time to catch Severus before he too hit the floor. The bundle in his arms moved and Lily gave a gasp as a child poked his head out of the blanket covering him. James and Sirius were already lifting Remus up and placing him on the couch. Lucius came over to him with jars of potions ready to administer.
The child though, from what he’d heard, was a Gryffindor and nothing like what he’d pictured his heir to be. He wondered if the boy inherited his Parceltounge. He hoped the boy did have his birthright. It was only proper for the next heir of Slytherin to have it.
The mediwitch bowed again, backing out of the room. As she past the doors she removed the silencing spell she placed around the room.
“Well, that answers that.” Lucius said, “Now to find out what it is and how to reverse it for the populous.”
Disclaimer: I Don’t own Harry Potter nor do I make any money from this story, Just having some fun with the Characters
Tom gave him a perplexed look, “Why do you seem to think that I knew anything about Black’s life before all this happened. He was your friend.”
He leapt at the man holding his child and threw his fist into the mans face. Blood spurted everywhere as the man’s nose broke. He fell and Severus pulled his son from the loose grasp. Bounding over to Remus and Umbridge he pulled his love from off the screaming woman.
Lucius sneered at the man, “And you never thought anything odd about that? Was she the only one who reported infant deaths? How many?”
When they apparated back to the manor they saw that Lucius and Rudolphus had returned as well. Fenrir was concerned that Remus and Severus were not back yet.
Albus sighed, “I can only assume it would be to trick the wizarding world into believing there are Muggleborns, although if there are no Muggleborns then Voldemorts ideals are no longer valid.”
Shortly after they talked Gibbs had been called to a scene and told Harry to wait for him at his desk. Harry was inspecting the pictures on the man’s desk. One stood out prominently of a beautiful red-haired woman and a seven year old girl. Harry assumed that this was the wife and daughter Gibbs had spoken of. He studied the picture of his deceased sister and noticed some similarities between them. The shape of their eyes were very similar.
“Because I believe Professor McGonagall would be rather put out with her favorite student if she was late.”
“I’ve found him. This way.” Together they made their way through the halls. They met little resistance as they meade their way in the direction Remus’ nose led him. Soon they were at a door that was iron and locked. Sirius pointed his wand at the lock, “Alohamora!”
Remus’ shaking began to subside and he fell forward into his fathers arms, calm. He knew right then that this man was his sire. No other wolf could have done what Fenrir just did, only sire to cub.
Narcissa ran her hand along her name on the first page, “How is this possible? I miscarried, it was a a miscarry, how could this be true?!” She ended in a shriek as she shook. Lucius wrapped his arms around his wife.
Harry jerked away his eyes unfocused. Draco pulled back until the dark haired boy was fully awake. He’d made that mistake once before and received a black eye for his trouble. Now he sits back until Harry knew where he was.
“We don’t know, Harry. The ministry is behind the whole thing. We have all lost children to this.” Narcissa said softly and sadly.
James gave a snort, “That child is definitely a Snape. Had me and Sirius dodging cereal this morning.”
Then she set about her task, marking each vial of blood with the name of the student. After she was done and the last student left she took the vials of blood back to her office where Lucius Malfoy and his wife sat, potions ready.
Snape led her to his desk where he pulled out the Bamboo parchment and potion. After the potion was absorbed by the parchment Hermione once again let one drop of blood hit the page. And once again the same words appeared on the page.
The mediwitch bowed one last time and left. Once she was past the Antiapparation wards she apparated to the small Muggle hospital where she sent the Lestrange baby girl.
The mediwitch glanced at the bundle wrapped golum and turned back. “I’m so sorry my lady, but the child didn’t make it… the strain of such a long labor was too much for her.”
Tom knew he was watching. He could feel Black’s gaze on him. He wondered what the man was thinking about. Was he thinking how they got together, or was he thinking of their child. It was something he too could not stop thinking about. From his memories that he possessed he had little interaction with the Black heir. Mostly from the battlefield he glimpsed vaguely the shaggy black hair and his barking laughter, very like his cousin. Although Bella’s seemed more from madness.
Peter Pettigrew, aka Wormtail, quailed under the wrath of his true master. It was just recently found out that the Potters were missing from Azkaban. They had known of the other breakouts, it was all approved by his master, but the Potters were not on the list of those the Death Eaters were suppose to be released. They hadn’t been obliviated and could cause serious harm to their cause if they talked to the wrong people.
Harry just curled back up to his side and sighed. Draco silently raged at the Muggles who made his love feel less than nothing. Who would tell a small boy that he was unwanted and ugly. A ‘freak’ Harry had told him once.
Pulling out a fresh sheet of parchment she began to copy down the potion. When she was done she blew on the page to dry the ink. Casting a quick tempus she realized that it was dinner time.
Draco sighed heavily and set the darkened mirror down. Turning to look at the figure asleep on his bed he frowned. His father was very adamant about him bringing the Creevey brothers. He wondered what for. A soft knock at the door brought him out of his thoughts and Blaise Zabini slipped into the room.
Fenrir nodded, “We had three that were pregnant, Devon was almost full term and our healer was concerned that he would deliver early. Two others who’d only been a few months.”
Lucius swept from the room to the floo and flooed over to Riddle Manor where Tom and the Potter’s were. When he came into the room Tom was laid out on the bed where Lily was pressing a cold compress to his forehead.
As Harry looked down into his face, Draco could see the desire there, not just a desire to rid his mind of the muggle that dared to touch him, but a desire for HIM, for Draco. That sent a thrill down his spine and as Harry nodded he slowly stood up with Harry who wrapped his legs sround his waist and slowly moved to the bed. Laying Harry on his back he stood back and began to undress him, piece by piece kissing each bare patch of skin as it was revealed.
Draco blanched. He’d never had to use his emergency portkey before. Things would have to be desperate if his father was telling him to use it now. Draco nodded and Lucius handed the mirror back to Sirius.
“I’ll have to arrange it. They were just hear yesterday. Bella wanted to meet her daughter and Harry was with her for support. I do have one little thing to tell you two… Harry is dating my son Draco. And Miss Granger is dating Mr. Zabini.”
“I did it perfectly, nothing went wrong. Professor Snape, what does this mean? How can I be that… woman’s daughter? Oh great Merlin, I’m a pureblood,” she groaned, “and Malfoy’s cousin.”
First to be told that all you know is a lie, then to find out that one of your so called enemies was in fact your lover and now this.
“What!?” shrieked Lily mouth agape, “You most certainly did not do anything of the sort! What gave you that idea?”
“What is all the yelling! There are children trying to sleep!” Remus snarled at Fenrir. His head understood that the man was his father, but his heart cannot accept that fact until the man can prove himself.
“The compound is heavily fortified and there are many guards patrolling the perimeter. We were ambushed near the south border, away from the main entry. I only got a quick glimpse when Sev commanded me to leave. They’d swarmed us right away, blocking us from each other. Sev told me to leave… I should have stayed… I-”
“Yes Master.” Mopsy bowed and disappeared. A moment later and Narcissa came into the room with Severus holding his son.
Harry nodded and turned to leave. Just then the elevator chimed and a man stepped out. He was older, balding and to Harry he thrummed with magic. He fingered his wand that was up his sleeve.
Albus had tears in his own eyes and he went and cradled Gellert in his arms. He still could not believe all of it himself. Lily was his daughter… and Harry his grandson… Great Merlin! What was the Ministry doing by seperating families like this! Lily should at least had a paternity test preformed on her. Why did they give her to Muggles?
Draco frowned uncertain as to what to say, “Yes, but he can’t talk right now. I’ll fill you in on all that I know when we get home.” And then the mirror went dark.
Sirius shook his head, “Harry, there’s something you need to know. When Malfoy and Riddle went to Azkaban to ‘liberate’ their followers they found someone they never expected in the depths of Azkaban. Malfoy thought she was delusional until he saw too.”
Harry Potter and Ron Weasley glanced up from their Charms Essay as the portrait door opened and Hermione Granger walked in clutching a book to her chest.
Fenrir wanted to follow the trio out and find out why his cub felt such hatred for him. The last he’d seen of his cub was over thirty years ago when he was just a small pup. Now here he is, a grown man with a cub of his own.
He probably would have broken down if it weren’t for Draco. The blond Slytherin never left his side except for necessity. Draco said that it was for support, but Harry knew that he was also nearby to keep him from cutting. Harry was sure that Draco didn’t know why he cut, but he supposed that the blond could guess with what little he’d said from their conversations. He dreaded the day his parents ever found out…
Hermione gaped at the page. She had never seen the last two ingrediants in any other potion before. Reading further the potion also required it to be brewed in a #2 silver cauldron with an Ivory ladel and a single sheet of Bamboo parchment to soak in it, then you add a drop of blood to the parchment of the person you’re using the potion on.
Narcissa gave a snort, “That could also explain why so many people believed the paper about Harry being crazy over the last few months. No one believed him that the Dark Lord was back after Rita Skeeters article.”
Hermione pulled away from Harry and practicly flew into the arms of the dark skinned boy on the left. Blaise Zabini cradled her as she cried into his shoulder. Her ran his hands through her hair comfortingly.
“After a time I found a wizard that could get me into Hogwarts and retrieve the Philosophers Stone which would grant me eternal life. I was thwarted by Harry again and I was once again essence floating in nothingness. Then last year Pettigrew found a ritual that would gain me a body and we contrived for Harry to be brought into my presence. When I emerged from the cauldron I looked as I do now, this snake-like appearance.
Tom was quiet for some time after Lucius spoke. He knew that in his own family they were inbreeding. His grandfather had wanted his mother and uncle to have a child together, just to keep parceltounge alive. The dark families were getting thin, and with two wars, Grindewald’s and his own, the population has diminished even more. Many of their followers died on the battlefield or they died in prison. Very few of them survived Azkaban.
Lucius put a reassuring hand on his shoulder, “He is fine now, Sev. The potion has run its course. He is just exhausted from the ordeal.”
They’d almost not made it out of Nurmengard. His bones ached from the strain he’d put on them. He was not used to exertion any more.
“How does he know of us when you and I just found out from them.” Tom asked pointing to the Potters.
Harry hated traveling by portkey. It made him nauseas and a little scared. One of his experiences with a portkey went very badly for him and he wasn’t so sure that this time will not end up the same. With a grimace he gripped Draco’s hand as he felt the pull and was unceremoniously dropped onto the floor of the foyer. A smooth and delicate hand pulled him to his feet.
Fenrir went to his cub’s side and grabbed his head, forcing his wolf consciousness into his son’s, the Alpha commanding.
Severus snorted, “You should have stayed in bed and waited until they could come to you. It’s not like they can go anywhere. The whole world thinks that their dead.”
Tom was ignoring it all as his own gaze settled on one Sirius Black who seemed to cringe behind Narcissa Malfoy. The man kept peering over her shoulder as if he was afraid to look into Tom’s eyes.
Tom cursed the werewolf’s sensitive nose. Even his slight change in sanity was noticeable to the wolf. “Certain things have been brought to my attention. What brings you to my door Greyback? Is your pack in trouble?” Not that he really cared about werewolves, but they have been loyal to him, at least he thought they were.
Footsteps approached and he turned to greet Severus, a smile on his face. Standing in the doorway was Severus Snape, Potions Matser and Hogwarts teacher, and the love of his life. He moved to embrace him and they kissed, passion filling Remus and he groaned.
On the train headed to school Draco came across a distraught Harry in the bathroom. The savior tried to cover himself up but the other had seen. Blood dripping down his arms into the sink and a razor blade in his hand. The two stood stranfixed for a full five minutes, then Draco pulled out his wand, which set Harry off.
Lily scoffed, “After all the things you told me about what you all remember, I’m not surprised. Sirus is a little thick sometimes, no offence Tom.”
“Remus!” Severus exclaimed. “Thank Salazar, you have come. We must leave, it’s two days until the full moon and she is getting more feral with each passing day.”
“I must return to Hogwarts. Although, Lucius, I was wondering if you had any supply of the Heritage potion. I know that most Pureblood families keep some around for indentity purposes of children.”
“Lily!” Severus looked up and beheld his childhood friend, Coppery red hair and emerald green eyes the shone with life. “How? Where have you been? Harry… Petunia…”
Tom took the potions from him, “Well then…” and he downed the first potion. The whole room waited in anticipation for any change. Sirius looked especially anxious.
“Is not necessary for family.” Harry said to him. “Can we discuss this somewhere more private, sir.” He looked at Gibbs, “Not the elevator.”
“I have to shower! Do my hair! Pick out clothes! Harry, first impressions are very important!” Draco shrieked in a very unMalfoy like manner.
“Lucius, open the cells and lets see the conditions they are in. If they are sane we will take them with us.”
Tom Riddle stood by the fireplace, a glass of Firewhiskey in his hand. He kept bringing it to his lips then stopping and lowering his hand. He kept glancing to his side where Sirius sat by the window trying hard not to look in the man’s direction.
“Due to certain circumstances Professor Dumbledore has been relieved of his duty as Headmaster and the Ministry has placed me in charge until a new Headmaster or Headmistress is appointed.”
In his private rooms he went to the fireplace and threw in some floo powder calling out, “Malfoy Manor!” then stuck his head into the flames.
The house was run down, a part of the roof had caved in, but it was his home. The place where he had grown up, where he’d experienced his first kiss… and the place where his little sister was killed. He’d never been back since… until now.
James Potter opened his eyes and blue locked with green, “Lils, what can be so much more terrible than what Peter did to us.” At those words he gasped and sat up with a groan. “Peter! When I get my hands on that stinking little rat…” That was when he saw Tom. “Tom, what in Merlin’s name happened? Where’s Sirius?”
Draco thought. Harry's mouth reached the crook of Draco’s neck. His left hand caressed Draco’s belly and played with his light-coloured pubic hair.
After a while, it might have been a minute but had felt like a life-time, Draco pulled away. "Take us to bed," he whispered. Harry Apparated them into his bedroom.
"I imagined what it would be like to seduce you. As you don't remember me, it should feel like you had sex with a stranger, someone that might have watched you in a bar all evening, a stranger who doesn't know you. The thought turns me on. The sex would be new, fascinating. "
It was like before. A sign, a code word. If they had turned each other on, with looks and hints, with touches, and one could not stand it anymore, there was only one question: "Where?" The other decided.
"You turn me on like no one ever has," Harry murmured as his lips made his way up again. “I haven't been able to resist you for a single week. No wonder I got married to you."
It was a Monday, 1st October 2001. That year terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in New York, Wikipedia was founded and Prince William met Kate Middleton at a Scottish university. Douglas Adams had died and bands like Outkast, Linkin Park and Blue stayed in the top 10 of the charts for weeks. Millions of fans were eagerly awaiting the premiere of the first part of the “Lord of the Rings” and billions of text messages were sent worldwide via Nokia and Ericcson cell phones.
The question left a bitter trace in Draco’s mind, but then Harry's fingers gripped his penis. Draco gasped. Harry's lips found his mouth. Draco returned Harry's kiss with passion, but uncomfortable thoughts began to spread in his mind. Harry crouched between Draco's legs and looked at Draco's face asking for permission. His pupils were dilated with desire.
"I don't want any other sex. I love everything about it. That's why I'm so keen on you. I'm just fascinated by the idea that I'm a stranger to you, that I can surprise you. I'm sorry I started this conversation if it upsets you.”
Harry did a lot of good for wizards and muggles, but his desire to bring the two worlds closer together was not well received by the new minister. Melbroke wanted Harry to focus on the wizarding world exclusively.
Harry was tidying up his café and just about to wipe a table by the window when three people appeared in front of the building and stopped undecided. They wore ill-fitting, out-of-style muggle clothing and moved as if they felt watched. Harry only had to look once to see that they were wizards. One of the three was a tiny woman. She pointed to the front door and talked to a bulky middle-aged man who was standing next to her. The older wizard had his fingers wrapped around the arm of a skinny, tall guy as if to prevent him from running away, although the younger man showed no intention to move at all. He was waiting impassively for his companions’ decision to enter the house or not. A long, beige trench coat slithered around his thin body and the black hood of his sweater jutted far above his head. A few strands of white blond hair peeped out from the sides. He clutched a brown, almost ridiculously small suitcase and kept his head down. Harry was not able to see the man’s face, but something about his attitude sparked Harry’s curiosity.
"Upstairs, in bed." Draco's voice almost broke. He took Harry's hand, but didn't dare to kiss him just yet. Harry might back down. He had to take Harry to bed first, show him how much he adored him. "Come on then."
A terrible notion spread through Harry. He got up and ran to the side door of the café that lead into the stairwell of the house. He opened it as quietly as possible and listened.
Before he left the room, he turned to Harry and said, "I can't do this, Harry. I'm so sorry. I fooled myself. I think it's better if I move out as long as you don't have your memory back. And then we will see what's left of our marriage.”
Harry had known that the apartment would be occupied again in October. What he hadn’t known was the fact that the new tenant was his old arch enemy Draco Malfoy. He found out about that on the day Malfoy moved in.
"Sure," Draco managed to say. Harry poured the golden-brown liquid from a carafe into two wide glasses and set Draco's glass with a coaster on the shiny black wood of the grand piano. He himself went back to his abandoned space on the sofa. Draco finished his piece of music and joined Harry on the couch. He took a seat on the sofa opposite of Harry and sipped his drink. The silence in the room was disturbed by the rustling of the wind and the shaking of the shutters. Raindrops pattled agaist the windows. They stared at each other.
Before the three of them disappeared through the front door, the blonde man suddenly raised his head and looked through the window into the café. His eyes met Harry’s and for a moment the time seemed to stop. The young man was Draco Malfoy, though he didn’t show any sign of recognition when he stared into Harry’s eyes. A few heartbeats later the older wizard pulled Malfoy  out of Harry’s field of vision.
“You know, this building is owned by the ministry and an apartment has become vacant. Malfoy will receive a monthly allowance. He’s quite lucky, I guess, for being a death eater and all,” the wizard added.
But Harry stopped him. He pulled Draco towards him and pressed his lips to Draco's mouth. Draco was surprised, but he didn't hesitate for a second. There was something starting to vibrate inside his body, his magic reached out towards Harry and he felt Harry's answer. The intensity of his feelings almost made him sink back onto the couch. He hugged Harry tightly and surrendered into the kiss. Harry pressed his whole frame against Draco and showed him with lips and tongue how much he had longed for this.
The day Draco Malfoy moved into the rooms next to Harry’s apartment was a day like any other, yet it should turn Harry’s world upside down like no other event since Voldemort had brought himself down with his own death curse.
Draco heard Harry's praise, but his heart clenched. His penis went completely limp and now it was impossible for Harry to miss that the atmophere had changed. He paused and looked at Draco. His expression, almost feverish of desire, became clear and questioning. Draco lay under him, his body tense.
Harry’s apartment was on the first floor on the left just above the café. After the death of Mrs Pentriss, Harry’s next door neighbour, her apartment stayed uninhabited for three months. Mrs Pentriss had been a teacher at a public muggle school and had passed away peacefully at the age of 93. She had no relatives and since the Ministry of Magic, which owned the building, could not find any heirs to get her things out, the apartment was going to be rented out furnished from now on.
Draco thought. Aloud he said, "No, no, that’s not the way it was supposed to feel." He pulled his legs out from under Harry, who hesitantly made room for him. His face showed his confusion, devote of any subtlety as always.
They were back in the living room. A summer storm raged in front of their windows and drove away the oppressive sultry that punished every movement with an oily sweat during the day. Draco played the piano and Harry was lying on the sofa, eyes closed, following the music. Draco's eyes kept wandering to his slim, relaxed figure in a t-shirt and short jeans. Two weeks had passed since he woke up in St Mungo’s without remembering their relationship.
Harry heard her fumbling with a key. Apparently the lady was not used to opening muggle locks. After a short while a familiar squeak indicated that Mrs Pentriss’ door was opened.
Draco opened his legs a little further and directed Harry's gaze to the bulge in his pants. Draco saw Harry swallow, wrestling with doubt and desire.
They staggered towards the bed. Harry's arms encircled Draco, his lips searched for his mouth again, greedy and hot. He was like a drowning man and Draco felt the same. Harry's fingers opened the buttons on Draco's shirt and slipped it over his shoulders. Draco hadn't forgotten that some movements were still painful for Harry. With more care than Harry showed, he pulled Harry's t-shirt over his head. Harry kissed Draco's neck and ran his hands over his white chest. "You smell so good, Draco. You are so incredibly beautiful and sexy. "
Draco's penis started to sag. Harry didn't notice. He trailed down Draco's leg with one hand and squeezed his own dick with the other.
"I was shopping.” Harry wasn’t going to tell just anyone where he lived and worked. “Was that Draco Malfoy you had with you?”
Harry couldn’t change it and he didn’t really care what others thought about him. He had done his duty and was happy with his life. He had kept his old friends and made a few new ones. He had created a niche in which he could live in peace and with the feeling of doing something useful. Now, Draco Malfoy was threatening to destroy all of this, and Harry didn’t know what to do.
When the door fell shut behind Draco the hurt look in Harry's eyes revealed the love his husband had missed all along.
Draco felt excitement rising in his stomach like a wave. The last few days with Harry had brought him to the edge of his self-control. His senses were extremely tense. He wanted to wrap his body around Harry, to feel Harry on his skin and feel Harry inside of him. He had to look away.
Draco was pleased with Harry's words, but he was too busy concentrating on Harry's lips sucking his nipple and sending electric shocks through his body, to answer. He pulled Harry onto the bed with him and opened the zipper of his trousers. Harry quickly shoved them down over his hips and simultaneously removed his boxer briefs. Then he freed Draco from his clothes. He pressed kisses on Draco's belly and licked a damp trace from his navel to Draco's hip bones and then worked his way slowly deeper. His fingers kept playing with Draco's nipples. Draco couldn't help groaning. His dick lay full and heavy above his abdomen, twitching with excitement. He buried his hands in Harry's hair, kept running his fingers over his shoulder and his back.
Draco stared back. He was searching for something in Harry’s face and in his touch, but didn’t quite know what it was. Something was missing, and then the knowledge what it was hit him like a blow. There was no love in Harry's eyes. Coldness filled Draco.
“Yes, but don’t worry, he doesn’t have a wand and he is only allowed to use magic in case of an emergency or for his defense - if he can do wandless magic, that is. He can’t harm anyone and will be checked by his probation officer regularily. Otherwise, he can move around freely as long as he doesn’t enter the wizarding world or leave the country.”
Harry slumped into the nearest chair. What was Draco Malfoy doing here? He was supposed to be in Azkaban. Harry had last seen him at his trial. That was three years ago and Malfoy had looked just as sickly as now, lean and pale, with deep-set eyes and an apathetic expression on his face.
No, how could he? Draco hadn't understood it before either. He wanted Harry's love. He had thought that once Harry was in his bed it was a good start for more. It turned out, having sex with Harry but knowing he didn't love him was impossible for Draco. Never has Harry been more of a stranger to Draco than in the moment he had touched Draco without love.
Draco knew his words hurt Harry, even if he didn’t feel much for Draco anymore - apart from sexual attraction.
Draco had to explain all of that to Harry, he really should. But somehow he couldn't bring himself to do that right then. Later. There would be a later, wouldn't there?
"I thought it would be nice to have sex with a stranger. Well, it is not. Not for me. I don’t want a stranger. I want you back, Harry.
The two wizards looked at each other as if they didn’t know if that information was confidential. Apparently they came to the conclusion it wasn’t and replied, “Yes, Draco Malfoy.”
"No, wait." Harry rose as well, walked around the table, and held out his hand to stop him. "I want it too."
Draco had been playing for maybe half an hour when Harry got up and came over to the grand piano. First he lingered by the side and watched Draco's fingers slide over the keys. Then he stepped closer, stood behind Draco, surprisingly close but out of Draco's sight. A few minutes passed in which Draco felt nothing but Harry's warmth on his back and the sounds of the music. Then Harry's hands lay on his shoulders. Thumbs ran briefly along both sides of his neck. Draco's eyes fell closed, he held his breath, but much too soon Harry removed his fingers from Draco's skin. Draco was about to open his eyes in disappointment when he felt another touch.
“Dennis!” Hermione spoke up in shock. She was still being held by Bellatrix and surrounded by the male members of her new family.
Draco turned his gaze back to Weasley and saw that the red head was looking at the two of then oddly. For someone who professed to be their best friend he looked as if he expected the two of them to sprout horns and scales and start shooting off Dark hexes.
Severus struggled with his bond too and with Umbridge distracted he broke free. He screamed in rage as Remus writhed under the curses being held on his lover and swept across the room. He wrapped his hand around the mans throat and twisted. A satisfying crack resounded in the room and the man fell to the floor dead.
“Now Lucius?” Tom turned to look directly into his eyes, the gleam reminiscent of the old days, “I plan on thwarting the Ministry from ever stealing anymore of our children and returning the lost ones to their proper families.”
Hermione pulled away from Bella and smiled at him giving him a kiss on the cheek, “Nothing, but you are right. We need to get back.”
One by one they placed a single drop on the paper and slowly the child’s families were revealed. Two pages stood out amongst the others and the couple could only stare at the first of the two in total shock.
Lucius looked up at the Matron, “I really don’t know how far this all goes. Madame, could you please send for Professor Dumbledore. I’m sure he would like to know that he has a grandson.”
“We know about that, Draco. Listen, you need to get home as soon as possible. It’s not safe for you there anymore.”
Tom sighed and pulled a chair up next to her putting his wand away. “I don’t know where Black is, not that it matters, and as for your son…” Tom cringed at the hard look the woman sent his way. “He is fine.”
“The place we went to was guarded, but not heavily so, and Greyback could smell wolves. Let’s wait and see what Severus and Remus saw when they get back.”
“Yes, she died ten years ago, at least that was what the St. Mungo’s administrator says.” Lucius stated.
“From my own recollection I have no memory of the man so how can I take offence. Well, Lucius, what did you tell him?”
The room they went into was full of computer screens and electronics. Harry glanced around at the people there until Gibbs snapped out a “Clear the room!” order and they did. The only person who didn’t leave was a black man with a mustache.
James and Lily clung to each other as one of their best friends writhed in pain from the silver poisoning. Sirius just stared at the two men in shock. The child, Conall, clung to Severus as the man rubbed soothing circles on the child's back.
Narcissa stood up abruptly and walked out of the room. Moments later she was back with todays edition of the Daily Profit. She dropped the paper on the floor in the middle of the room. Severus drew his wand and cast a revelio. The paper glowed an eerie green in color.
Harry took out his wand and levitated an afghan to wrap around the two of them. Exhausted they fell asleep right there on the floor.
Harry glanced at the Muraders Map once more then slowly made his way to his destination. The girls bathroom was cold this late at night and he sighed as he noticed that Moaning Myrtle was not there. He made his way over to one of the stalls, closed the door and sat on the seat.
Two years ago when Draco Malfoy came into his family’s dormant Veela heritage his whole persona changed. Being the submissive made him more susceptible to emotional outbursts. Especially since he’s been pregnant. It was actually kind of fun to let his mate loose all his Malfoy calm.
Severus awoke to pain and darkness. Without opening his eyes or moving he used his other senses to get a feel of his situation. The first thing he felt for was his bond with Remus. It thrummed faintly in the back of his mind telling him that his mate was safe. He then began a check on his body. Bruises and abrasions covered his body from when he fell, hit by a stunner aimed at Remus. His right shoulder ached and he couldn't move his fingers, that told him that his arm was dislocated.
The woman stirred at the sound of his voice. She moaned as she rolled over, “Luce? Have the hallucinations gotten that bad now?” She mumbled.
“Remus is a more logical choice for this recon. He and I work together well. Conell will be well looked after by Lily and James.”
Suddenly the floo came to life and Severus Snape came through cradling something in his arms and right behind him came Remus Lupin, who looked beaten and bruised and collapsed to the floor.
