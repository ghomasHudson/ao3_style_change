“Thank you, Potter,” Malfoy said, looking a little taken aback. “I’m sorry that you get, you know... hounded by the media.”
“Goodbye, Harry. And my apologies, Minister, for what you saw. I assure you that I usually conduct myself much more professionally.”
It was Harry’s turn to laugh at that. “You see I have some ideas, but it would be so much more fun to hear you say it.”
“True,” Harry sighed. “But I did enjoy this. A lot, actually. And I don’t know, I was sort of thinking...” he trailed off, unsure if he really wanted to voice his true thoughts.
Draco took the paper she was offering, and gave it a quick glance. Only a few sentences in and he was already blushing. Pansy hadn’t been lying, whoever these people were, they were clearly big fans of his updates, and what’s more, they seemed to be big fans of his.
Draco flushed immediately red, and choked slightly on his own saliva. “Oh,” he said, when he’d regained the ability to speak, “I, um, wasn’t sure if you’d want to. Or do anything else really.”
When he flung the door open, it was to see a very nervous looking Draco peering carefully at him and biting at his bottom lip.
“Well that’s a relief. Not that I minded the bit of role play that followed to be honest... although when do I ever mind the chance to bend you over the kitchen table and have my way with you? Now come on, a few minutes ago you were desperate for food, or so I recall.”
Malfoy seemed to struggle to avoid rolling his eyes, but composed himself before answering. “Yes,” he said, “prior to moving to Finland I had been working as the secretary for the head of the spell damage ward at Central Hospital in Belize City. Not the largest hospital in Central America, but we certainly had enough work to keep us all busy.”
“It’s lucky that I love you,” Harry said in exasperation, before suddenly realising what he’d just admitted.
Harry’s eyes widened suddenly with a look of understanding. “Right! Okay. Of course, you should go. Don’t you have to meet Hermione first?”
Harry gulped. He had opened a cake just like the one Scorpius was describing and had already scoffed down a good half of it. But surely this must still just be part of an elaborate prank?
“Shocking. You mean you think it would be a bad look were one of your students to come across a partly used bottle of lube in the middle of a remedial Defence Against the Dark Arts session?”
Hermione raised an eyebrow in his direction. “You have a plan,” she stated incredulously. “Now that just makes me suspicious Harry, because I have never known you to have a plan. Usually I have a plan, and you make it a point to ignore it.”
After what felt like an age, but in reality was likely only a few seconds, Draco leant forward and took Harry’s length into his mouth.
“Because I’m brilliant,” she answered instantly. “And besides, Draco, you know you’re more than capable of this. People just need to be assured of what’s happening. It’s been a week now since Granger announced that we had to cut all ties with Muggles. People want someone to reassure them.”
Draco made an angry tutting noise. “Hardly. Although I can’t promise I’ll be polite if one starts talking to us like that again.” He didn’t even need to see Harry to know that he’d rolled his eyes.
From experience, Harry knew better than to pick an argument with Draco when he was hungry. In fact, these days whenever Draco started calling him insults or referring to him as ‘Potter’, Harry would immediately summon the nearest sweet treat and wait for Draco to return to his usual self, which at least softened the insults.
“That’s a great line, Harry,” Draco said, his mouth hovering only millimetres from Harry’s now. “I bet you use that on all the boys.”
“What- um, what are you proposing?” Harry choked out, his voice much more high-pitched than he ever recalled it being.
He’d known it was a stupid decision at the time, and yet when had that stopped him before? As the papers had been enjoying explaining in great detail, Draco had made a fair few bad decisions in his life.
“Let me get this straight,” Malfoy spoke after a moment, “you’re upset about the gift. But because you think it’s what - some dig at you?”
“I didn’t bite his head off,” Harry insisted, “I just pointed out that he chose a complete nutcase for me to interview.”
Malfoy just mumbled incoherently, pushing the globes of his arse into Harry’s hands as much as he was able to without coming off the desk.
“Yeah. It’s me,” Potter admitted. “I know you must think I’m weird. I just... I haven’t really been able to go out lately. I tend to only go to Muggle places, it keeps me from being harassed. And then recently...”
“An excellent question, Potter, and I can understand why it might seem a little unusual that I’d apply for the role given our previous history. Honestly, I think I could do this job well, and I’d like the challenge. There’s a large variety of work, and it would be nice to be based back in Britain.”
Potter nodded. “Yeah. I know. Hermione is still one of my best friends, remember? Even if she’s been flat out with all this.”
“Because,” Hermione said slowly, “he was clearly embarrassed about being caught by me, yet he stayed around long enough to stand up and defend you. When he thought you had been doing something like that with everyone you interviewed he looked like a kicked crup. And most importantly, he spent the whole time looking at you like you were some fairground prize!”
“I don’t want to go,” Draco muttered, and Harry sighed with relief. “But I should let you know that I’m really not into pain with sex. In case you were hoping that this was some kind of turn on for me. It’s really, really not.”
“What do you think, Potter? That Witch Weekly bachelor of the year spread with those, you know, photos.”
Satisfied, he turned back to his latest case file, and put all thoughts of hiring a secretary to the side.
As he walked away towards where he could safely apparate, he saw the small smile grace Harry’s features, and the relaxing of his shoulders. Indeed, it was only Harry that Draco wanted. As ridiculous as the whole situation was, in the circumstances, Draco wasn’t certain that he wouldn’t start his own fan club for Harry.
Harry forced himself to nod finally, and gestured to the chair opposite his desk. Shit. This wasn’t good. He wasn’t at all prepared for this interview. Not in the least because he actually had no idea what Malfoy had been up to since high school, and he knew that Malfoy would pick up on the fact that Harry had been too lazy to read his résumé before the interview.
Hermione shook her head and sighed audibly. “Harry, you know I think you’re an excellent Auror, but you are honestly terrible at reading people when it comes to your personal life. You’re just being plain thick if you think that he ran out of this room to get away from you.”
“I should probably go,” Malfoy said. “Thanks for meeting with me, Potter. It was more than I expected, really. I know this hasn’t exactly gone brilliantly, but I’m glad you heard me out.”
“You can’t be that thick, Malfoy. He told me himself that it was your idea. Wanted to humiliate me did you? Poke fun at my sexuality? Well congratulations, you’ve had your fun. I hope you got a bloody good laugh out of it.”
Two weeks passed by. Draco’s life had become so incredibly busy that he barely had time to breathe. He was grateful though that they seemed to be making progress. There had only been three instances of Muggles needing to have Obliviators deal with them the day before.
“It’s okay,” Malfoy interrupted, “you don’t need to say it, Potter. I’m sure you’ve got someone else you’d rather employ. Like I said, thanks for your time, anyway.”
While it was promising, Draco was still concerned. The magic they’d been performing was so minor that it shouldn’t have been obvious, and yet breaches had still occurred. It was bizarre, but he knew his team was closing in on a permanent solution, a new spell that they could use to protect themselves against prying Muggle eyes. He just needed everyone to hold on until it was in place.
Draco sighed, moving to look at the head in his floo. He wished that he’d had the forethought to actually make himself look a little more put together before now, but there was no time for that.
Harry smiled, and thought to himself that this time Dean had done fairly well. She’d become more friendly as they’d talked, and he was starting to see a future in which they could work well together.
Finally, Harry conjured a small amount of lube into the palm of his hand, and began rubbing it gently around Malfoy’s hole. “Fuck,” he muttered, still a little unable to believe that this was really happening.
“You were a nanny?” Harry asked, surprised. His current interviewee, Aoife, was slightly intimidating to him, but he must admit that she interested him much more than the unlikeable Dave.
It was agonisingly slow at first as he gently pushed his finger inside Malfoy’s tight hole. Malfoy gasped slightly at the intrusion and so Harry waited, not wanting to rush things. He especially didn’t want Malfoy to change his mind and leave, because as surreal as this whole experience was, now that it was happening, Harry felt as if he’d never wanted anything so badly in his life.
“Draco, darling, don’t mind the journalists. They live to annoy you, didn’t you know? They’ve nothing else to report on at the moment, so they’re spending their days finding tricky questions for you.”
Draco’s retort was cut off as he suddenly felt the truly glorious sensation of Harry’s tongue licking a firm stripe up his shaft while his hands continued to fondle his balls underneath.
Harry laughed. “No complaints here! It’s, um, not really something I’m into either. So I guess that’s good?”
“Draco, listen to me, please. The stories they’ve written... everything they’ve implied... none of it’s true, I swear. I didn’t do anything with anyone. I just danced a bit.”
Hermione sighed, but put up her hands in surrender as she made to stand up. “Fine, I’ll stay out of it. I’ll come and see you after your last interview. When are they getting here?”
“Do you really want me?” Draco asked quietly. “Only I’d quite like to kiss you now, but only if that’s something you’d be interested in.”
As he peeled back the elegant wrapping paper, Harry had to admit that his curiosity was piqued. It certainly seemed to be something a little different than a standard box from Honeydukes.
The resounding laugh in answer stung, but was probably deserved. “Harry, please. If it’d been left to you, you’d have always been too busy to read anything properly and either never picked someone, or picked at random. Who knows how that would’ve gone.”
Draco smiled, and Harry was relieved to see that a lot of the tension seemed to be leaving him as they spoke.
“I’m sorry, I was just trying to get something nice, and well, I mean it was Dad’s idea, but he promised that it was a favourite of yours back in your school days!”
“As you can see, Minister, our Obliviators are already stretched. If it keeps up...” Draco trailed off, preferring to let the Minister come to the conclusion herself.
“Honestly, Harry, there’s a lot that will need to be said. You know that at the end of the day, I am still your boss, and what I just saw... Harry, that was completely unacceptable. Of course I’m glad that Malfoy was so, shall we say, enthusiastic about the whole thing, but still, you just can’t do that with an interviewee in your office.”
“I hate my life,” Draco grumbled, throwing his file onto his desk and stripping off his tie. “Bunch of bloody annoying twits! They don’t listen to anything I say, do they?”
“Oh,” Dave said, looking a little thrown off for the first time since he walked in the room. He quickly threw it off though and stood up with a smile on his face. “Well, thank you very much, Mr. Potter. It’s been delightful to meet you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.”
“Good,” Hermione said, relieved. “Now, you’re feeling confident on what you’ll ask? You don’t want any last minute advice on interviewing techniques?”
It was Aoife’s turn to laugh now. “People always ask me that! But you know, it’s not all that different to any other job. I learned a lot. I’d never had to be so well organised before in my life than when I was trying to coordinate the schedules of a busy family. And yet, I don’t think anything could be quite as rewarding as it either. So, challenging, fascinating, full on and fun, plus a million things in between. That’s how I’d describe it.”
At least until Draco came to his senses and broke their kiss, leading to Harry letting out a little simpering noise that made Draco’s heart clench in a way that he didn’t want to examine too closely.
Draco nodded. “Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. Sorry I know you’re usually busy in the day, but you don’t just have a minute to talk do you?”
“You’re so sneaky! I can’t believe you’ve known all this time and you were just using me to get free sweets!”
So now here he was on house arrest for six bloody months, with no visitors outside of the one approved house elf that was allowed to bring him essential supplies. Apparently his boyfriend didn’t count as an essential supply as much has Draco would have liked to argue that he very definitely was, so Draco was forced to communicate with him via owl and floo only.
“I barely know him! I hadn’t seen him for a decade or so until today! I just thought... I don’t know what I thought, but it didn’t involve running out the door at the first opportunity.”
“And I’ve told you before, Dean is brilliant and completely and utterly off limits to you. Besides, you know as well as I do that he’ll be moving soon enough. I’m actually going to recommend him for a managerial position in Human Resources. After everything he’s just done for you, I’d say he’s more than qualified.”
All pretence of being professional now forgotten, Harry threw his hands up in exasperation. “Why would that bother me?”
“There’s a difference between moving past school grudges and asking your former enemy to shove a dildo up your arse!”
Pansy strolled into the office waving something above her head. “You are going to love me!” she squealed, doing a little twirl as she spoke.
Harry hurried to conjure more lube and cover himself with it before he finally got to breach Malfoy’s now open and pliant body. The feeling of that first slide in was incredible, better than any of the men he’d been with until now, because this was by far the most erotic experience of his life.
Draco shook his head. He hated that they were in this position. Suddenly everything that they’d had in place for centuries to protect their world and their ways was crumbling around them. Glamours were failing in front of Muggles, the Knight Bus had suddenly appeared in the middle of Oxford Street, alarming hundreds of Muggles who’d been going about their shopping, and witches and wizards seemed to be spotted with their wands every other minute.
Malfoy did bend himself over the desk at that point and wiggled his arse at Harry just to emphasise his point. Harry had to take a moment to compose himself before he felt he could safely cast the spell to rid himself of his clothes without accidentally vanishing his own cock along with them.
Draco threw him a careful glance, before answering. “I think you know. But I have to ask - what happened in your office - did you, I mean, do you wish that it hadn’t happened?”
Harry snorted. “That sounds like high praise coming from you. Do you always flatter your partners like this?”
Draco turned bright red at her words, clearly having been too distracted by her arrival to do anything about cleaning up his face before now. He quickly summoned his wand, casting a cleaning charm on himself, and transfiguring the crude sheet Harry had conjured for him into something a little more flattering.
This time it was Hermione who burst out laughing. “Yes,” she said emphatically, “yes I do, Harry. So go on, chase him down and tell him whatever it is that you need to tell him.”
“I’ve done it before,” Harry answered after a moment, “but you still have to tell me if I’m hurting you. I’ve never done it with you.”
Harry laughed, and successfully distracted Draco with another kiss that left them both hard and gasping in no time. Harry let his hands wander down and grab hold of Draco’s arse, taking great delight in gripping the firm cheeks as Draco ground his hips up and down on top of Harry’s cock, which was straining inside his trousers.
“It’s a long time, Harry. You’ve already complained about not getting to have sex for that long, but really there’s nothing stopping you.”
Harry snorted. “I’m honoured you think so much of my stamina, really, but no, Draco. Look, this whole thing will only work if you trust me.”
Harry just folded his arms. He had to quietly admit that Dean had a point. The paperwork and whole Human Resources side to his job was definitely not his favourite. He’d got into this line of work to try and catch dark wizards, not to decide if three years of working for the Wizengamot was more useful in a secretary than four years in Gringotts’ foreign exchange team.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t want to stop and let that mob get pictures of us together, bloody hell, Harry. We can talk about it when we get to your place.”
Harry flushed when he realised what he’d just asked, and Malfoy’s raised eyebrow and salacious smile was making him nervous.
“I have,” Potter replied. “I think that was a lot of what made your updates so fascinating to me. You’re so genuine, and caring, and I’ve always been drawn to you somehow. But seeing how you spoke now compared to back then... it was nice.”
“You do like that don’t you? You know, we could resolve the whole question of who keeps that delightful toy in a different way.” Malfoy was pinning him with a questioning look, some of his bravado fading a little as he tried to gauge Harry’s response.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “As eloquent as ever, Potter. Fine, I’ll admit that it would be something of a fantasy for me since seeing you splashed across that ridiculous magazine for the last few years.”
At last, after what felt like an eternity, Dave turned around and walked out of Harry’s office. Harry slumped back into his chair, letting out a loud groan and rubbing at his temples. Had Dean really thought that Dave would be a good candidate, or was this just some perverse revenge for some unknown crime Harry had committed against him?
Draco could have sworn that he heard a chuckle at that. Harry’s hand continued stroking up and down Draco’s shaft, a tortuous combination of wonderful and not nearly enough at the same time. Draco tried bucking his hips to get more from Harry, to speed up his rhythm, but that just made Harry slow down further, the utter sadist.
Harry just blinked. Malfoy had fantasised about him? Instead of saying something intelligent, all he could think to ask was, “what magazine?”
He couldn’t have been more wrong. The universe was obviously out to get him. Or at least Dean was out to get him. That could be the only explanation as to why Harry now found himself staring gobsmacked at none other than Draco Malfoy.
A laugh rang out threw Harry’s office as Dean stood there shaking his head. “You know, Harry, only you would have that as your deciding factor in hiring someone. It’s fine if they’re useless, as long as we can have a good yarn! Good luck, mate, two to go!”
The moment was ruined slightly by Harry’s overly excited reaction, as he misjudged how close Draco’s head was to his own, turning his enthusiastic nod of agreement into more of a head butt, leaving Draco to pull back from him with a sharp cry of pain.
“It’s not what you think, Hermione,” Harry began, desperately hoping that she’d hear him out. “We’d finished the interview before any of this happened.”
“You see, I know a lot about dragons,” Dave continued, “and yes I know that a Welsh Green shouldn’t technically have ended up in Brazil, but it’s just one of those things isn’t it? So yes, happy to have avoided any incident over that one, and I’m sure you can see how valuable those diplomatic skills are. I’ve never been one to back down, and I certainly could manage anything that you have to throw at me.”
“Yes there is, you utter moron. The fact that you’re stuck here, and no matter how much I plead to the bloody minister, I’m not allowed to come and see you.”
Carefully, Harry pulled out the dildo from Malfoy’s arse and threw it on the floor. There’d be time to clear it up later, but right now his attention was most definitely elsewhere.
“I’m not the one acting like a teenager that just discovered the joys of sex. But hey, I’m flattered,” he added, pushing himself up from the desk and summoning his clothes. “You didn’t entirely disappoint me I must say.”
Draco stepped inside, brushing past Potter on his way. He had to admit that Potter still looked alarmingly good, despite his apparent sheltered existence for the past few years.
Draco’s shock was only clear for a moment before he shook his head and smiled, answering simply, “I love you too.”
It had been stupid not to ask Harry what he’d meant when he’d said to Draco that he’d be going out that night. Not that he had to ask him, no, the papers had saved him that trouble. Draco wished they hadn’t been included as essential for him to see while eating his breakfast.
Silence fell between them, and Harry wished that the floor could swallow him up. Perhaps he could invent an emergency that would require the Head Auror to rush away. Was it too much to ask for a Dark Wizard to start firing off curses downtown to save him from his embarrassment?
“Me?!” Draco exclaimed. “Why on earth should I be doing a press conference? Surely the Minister is better positioned. People love listening to her.”
“Yeah,” Draco agreed. “Do you have plans for this afternoon? Only I could make a little time in my schedule, if you were free.”
A heavy silence settled between them, as Hermione continued to look at him with disappointment, and Harry realised the seriousness of what he’d just done.
Harry gulped. His heart was racing, and other parts of his anatomy were having their own rather enthusiastic response.
Malfoy laughed, a bright, delightful sound that Harry would never have associated with him. “Oh, Potter, I don’t hate you. It’s been twenty years! I think we’ve moved on from our old school grudges, haven’t we?”
Harry stared at him, gawping ridiculously. Malfoy surely hadn’t just said that? He felt a flush creeping up his cheeks, because although he would never admit it to Malfoy, the man had made a fair observation.
Thirty boxes of Honeydukes chocolates, three bottles of firewhiskey, two hip flasks with a best professor slogan and a few assorted surprises later, Harry was left with only one present to open. An unusual rectangular box, he was a little surprised to even see it there, given the thank you note indicating it as being from Scorpius Malfoy.
Draco shrugged. “It doesn’t matter. You didn’t know what you were thinking. And I should be going anyway.”
“My assistant, Pansy, I expect you’ll remember her? Well, you see she did a little research for me, and her digging found that it looks like you’re the one running a certain... club. About me, specifically.”
“Do you do this with all your fans then?” Harry asked suddenly. “Only how do you have time to actually fix the problems with the breaches of the statute? Wouldn’t you be snogging half of wizarding Britain?”
She surveyed him carefully for a moment. “You have an idea, don’t you? But you don’t think I’ll like it. Come on, Malfoy, you should know by now that I’ll at least hear you out.”
“Never mind,” Harry sighed, running his hand distractedly through his hair. Instead of leaving though, Malfoy stepped back towards Harry, with a curious look on his face.
He reached out towards Malfoy, and grabbed his hand. “Wait,” he said again, only with more urgency this time. He pulled Malfoy back towards him, until there were only centimetres separating them.
A swift knock on the door broke Harry from his reverie. The person didn’t wait for Harry to reply, throwing the door open with much more force than was strictly necessary.
“How is it anything to do with you being gay? Are you trying to say that gay people don’t eat treacle tart any more, Potter? I must have missed that on the agenda at the last big, gay reunion!”
“You haven’t been able to go anywhere because of the restrictions,” Draco finished for him. “I’m sorry,” he said, and was surprised that he genuinely meant it. “You know it’s the only thing we can do.”
“It’s not weird,” Harry groaned, “I just want to make sure that I could get along with them. That’s all. Dean seems to think that as long as they can do the job, it doesn’t matter if they’re a git, but I disagree.”
Harry gulped. Malfoy had a point, but he didn’t want to admit it. “I’ve never tried to say I was brave,” he said instead, “other people have done that for me. But I’ve never claimed to be that myself.”
Harry hastened to comply, working a second finger inside Malfoy’s body. It slid in more easily than the first, which Harry took as an indication that Malfoy was relaxing into what they were doing.
“Well you need to give me a damn good reason not to suspend you right here, right now, Harry,” Hermione hissed. “What the hell are you playing at?! And for goodness sake, Malfoy, cast a cleaning charm on yourself, won’t you?”
“What - no, you’re just winding me up. Look, I’m sorry about all this with Scorpius, I’ll apologise to him later, but then could we just please forget that this happened?”
Draco pulled a graph out of his briefcase and sent a quiet word of thanks to Stevenson in his department for producing it before this meeting.
Their kiss was slow and gentle as they began to ease into this new, unfamiliar territory between them. Harry felt Malfoy’s hand gently rubbing at his back, and he relaxed into the surprisingly tender touch.
“Because I know you, Harry,” Malfoy said, and Harry certainly picked up on the use of his first name again. “Maybe not as well as I once did, but you always worked best when you trusted your gut. So that’s how I think you got this position so young. You did what was right, you followed your intuition, and the results spoke for themselves. You can’t have changed that much, or you would have read every inch of my resumé before I arrived today.”
He dropped the box from sheer shock when he first saw what was inside. “What the fuck?!” Harry yelled, a mixture of disbelief and pain from where the box had struck his toe coursing through him.
Malfoy held out his hand, and Harry grasped it, feeling his palm start to sweat as they exchanged a brief shake of hands.
Malfoy was now standing far too close to him, his eyes piercing into Harry as though trying to read his mind. Harry suddenly wondered if Malfoy knew legilimency, and cursed himself for not having read the man’s résumé when he’d had the chance.
Malfoy stared at him intently for a few moments and Harry felt a blush rising in his cheeks. Perhaps he’d completely missed the mark with what he was asking, and Malfoy had only wanted this to be a one time thing. Harry couldn’t deny that he’d be disappointed with that now, but he hadn’t thought to ask before, and Malfoy had only ever said that having sex with him was a fantasy, nothing more.
“Fine,” Draco grunted out, “Harry, would you be ever so kind to see what would happen if you stuck your cock through my floo?”
It was incredibly confusing for Draco. Why on earth would Potter of all people be conducting a mail in vote about which photo of Draco was the best? The worst part of it was that the photo that won wasn’t even a particularly good one as far as Draco was concerned.
“Well, well, Potter. I had no idea that you’d be so curious about what I get up to. What would you like to know? How I’d carefully work myself open, using just enough lube to make sure that I could fit the tip of that in? Then I’d carefully insert it further and further until it was deep enough inside me to make my head spin...”
“No, you know I don’t think we can, Professor. What on earth would the papers make of you discussing such things with your students?”
Harry didn’t need to be asked twice. He grinned at Draco once, and then disappeared with a quiet pop. As Draco patiently waited for another part of his boyfriend’s anatomy to appear, he decided that this house arrest thing maybe wasn’t so bad after all. It was looking like the next four months might just even be enjoyable.
“Yes!” Harry answered, far too quickly. “I mean, you should stay. I shouldn’t have- I know I was wrong- but let’s at least talk some more.”
Draco hung his head, a sense of shame washing over him. Of course Harry was right. “I do trust you,” he whispered after a moment, “it’s just hard seeing that. Reading it all. I don’t know how I’ll cope for six months.”
“Now just you wait one second there, Malfoy. I didn’t say you could take it. What would you do with it anyway?”
Harry was remembering exactly why he hated Malfoy now. He’d always been such a git, and as much as he might look completely different now, it didn’t seem like the boy who Harry had once known had disappeared completely.
“Right!” Harry finally interjected, cutting Dave off in the middle of another rant about his excellent abilities in broomstick making. “Thank you, Dave. I appreciate how... forthright you’ve been today. I’m sorry, but we’ve about run out of time as I do have other appointments waiting. But thank you for coming in.”
“Hmm, you do have a good point there,” Harry conceded. “Come on then, get your kit off. I think I could quite enjoy having a look at all of you.” He followed this with what he hoped was a sexy wink, and from Draco’s reaction he could tell that he hadn’t succeeded, but that Draco didn’t really mind.
Smiling, he checked his appearance before exiting the room and making his own way to the Great Hall for dinner. He had been wrong earlier he decided. Inviting families of departing students for the end of year was a brilliant idea.
Draco snorted. “Please, as if you don’t know. Bloody hell, just look at you. Could I- I mean, would you like...” he trailed off, his face flushing red as he bit his lip nervously.
“That much is obvious,” Hermione huffed. “This looks bad, Harry. You could easily be accused of using your position to obtain... favours.”
“Look, love, I know why you did it,” Harry continued, “but look what’s happened now. You knew they’d throw the book at you for anything to do with Muggles.”
Malfoy didn’t answer in words, but his responding groan and thrust backwards towards Harry made it pretty clear what he wanted. Harry smiled softly, and continued to push the toy further inside Malfoy’s body.
Instead, he would make do with a glass of firewhiskey and listening to a ridiculous programme on the wireless to take his mind off things. He could hope that he might bump into Draco somewhere; now that he would be based in Britain again it was possible that they would come across each other. The wizarding population in the country wasn’t so large after all.
As he came down from his climax, he was aware that Malfoy still hadn’t gone over the edge himself, so he began to pump his fist up and down Malfoy’s cock more and more quickly. He could tell as Malfoy finally reached his own orgasm with his whole body tensing, and his breathing becoming shaky and uneven.
“Yes, I said I’d been in a relationship with him, not that I’d been sleeping with everyone in Finland! Does it bother you that I didn’t settle down with a nice woman straight out of Hogwarts and produce several gorgeous children?”
It was with a crushing sense of failure that Harry decided to just go home. He couldn’t just burst into every house in wizarding Britain to see if Draco Malfoy was there, and if he did, it would likely just make people suspicious of Draco. He was sure that he could get a tracking spell cast on Draco’s wand, but he felt that that was really crossing a line, and that was before he even got into the illegalities of it.
“I didn’t even know anyone did that,” Harry admitted, realising that with this admission he risked sounding rather stupid.
Draco smiled and nodded at his son, grateful for his occasional bouts of denseness. No, Potter - or Harry as he should now think of him - was most definitely not Draco’s Professor.
Harry had tried to smuggle him some condiments through the floo, however this hadn’t been successful. Apparently trying to get around the rules that way just resulted in the items exploding in a variety of colourful fireworks which left a smattering of multicoloured dust throughout Draco’s living room. After spending two hours cleaning up the mess, he wasn’t in a hurry to try that again.
He could feel that Harry was similarly effected, as they ground their lower bodies against each other. Draco knew he could come just like this, just from rubbing against Harry in the middle of his lounge in broad daylight, and he found that he didn’t particularly care.
“So... do you, erm, accept my apology?” Malfoy asked finally, startling Harry who realised he’d been silent for an uncomfortably long time.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, you are my boyfriend, so what else would I call you? If you’re back to worrying about that stupid article that implied I was paying you for some kind of services...
It was Harry’s turn to snort now, but he didn’t want to waste any more time. He brought his hands up to cup Malfoy’s face, and after what felt like an eternity, he finally brought their lips together.
It seemed to take an age for Malfoy to relax a fraction and nod curtly in agreement. “Okay. Well, I think the last thing you wanted to know was what brought me back home now? If I’m honest - my mother. She’s not very well and I would like to be a little closer to her.”
Harry spun them around until the backs of Draco’s legs hit Harry’s desk. Taking the hint, he lifted himself slightly until he was sitting on the desk itself, and leant back enough to allow Harry to stand between his legs.
“Well, of course Granger is sickeningly popular, but it’s not just her, Draco. Have you seen your fan club?”
“And what a terrible problem that would be. Imagine if we were wizards and could just spell our clothes clean later. Oh wait...”
The silence that followed was oppressive. All three of them seemed frozen for a moment, the thumping of their heartbeats the only indication that time had not actually stopped.
Finally, Harry came with a shout. Much to his horror though, he realised that he wasn’t the only one shrieking inside his office.
“At least I can see your face,” Draco conceded, reaching out and running his hand gently along Harry’s cheek. “I don’t know what I’d do if I couldn’t see you at all.”
Harry took a moment to look at his boyfriend, the anxiety clearly showing on his face. “Look, Draco, I know it’s hard. But I promise that they will get bored of all this eventually. And any idiot knows that Hermione would only hire someone that she thought was right for the job.”
“I promise that I didn’t do or say anything that he took objection to,” Draco replied calmly. “He assures me that he did enjoy your actual gift, and he’ll pass on those sentiments to you when he gets the chance.”
“Just waiting here, Potter,” Malfoy said cheekily, sighing dramatically for effect, and stretching out further across the polished wood of Harry’s desk.
The articles about Harry’s life while he was, according to the papers, “free” from Draco, had continued. Draco was getting better at ignoring the stories of Harry’s many supposed conquests, even if he had torn up this morning’s paper into shreds with his bare hands before casting an Incendio at the remains. His tolerance only extended so far after all.
The moment seemed to go on for eternity, and then he gave a yelp as he felt a hand wrap around his cock. He had no idea if Harry could hear him or not, but if he kept doing what he was doing, Draco honestly wasn’t going to be entirely interested in conversation anyway.
“Oh fuck, yes,” Draco answered enthusiastically, not even caring about how smug that made Harry look in return. “But what can I do for you?”
“Yes,” Malfoy replied firmly. “And look, perhaps it would be best to acknowledge that there is a little bit of history between us first before we get started.”
Finally, he decided he had to confront him. Perhaps it was Potter’s idea of a sick joke? Had he found out how attracted to him Draco had always been? It would seem odd though, as Draco had only briefly spoken to the man in years. No one saw much of Potter these days, not since he’d shut himself off from the world after the war.
“I’m just grateful that she listened to me,” Draco admitted. “Plenty of Ministers wouldn’t, and in that case... well. All I can say is that I’m glad we had her in charge.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said truthfully, “I didn’t realise that she... I mean, I didn’t know that she was sick.”
“Ah,” Malfoy said, “I take it I may have missed the odd bit of news from our shores while I’ve been overseas?”
Much to Harry’s annoyance, Malfoy didn’t take the hint and just stop talking. He seemed determined to make this day as humiliating as possible for Harry, which he supposed was partly his own fault, but he still didn’t appreciate it.
“Never had much chance,” Harry admitted, “but if you’ll let me, I’ve got plenty more terrible lines that I wouldn’t mind using on you.”
“I can’t believe you, Harry,” she cut in. “What the hell are you thinking? Is this what you’ve been doing with the candidates? The test to see if you could get along - did you mean you got them to do - to do that to you?”
“Relax, Potter. I have to say, I struggle to understand why you, of all people, would do such a thing. Care to enlighten me?”
Harry startled when he realised that he was expected to say something at this point. “Uh, yeah, mmm. That’s great.”
Granger looked at him for a moment, concern etched into every line on her face. “That isn’t going to be easy. We’ll be asking people to stay away from family, friends. There’s plenty of businesses that sell to Muggles that will have to close. Do we have an alternative?”
“I’ll add some lube to it,” Harry said stupidly, spelling some of the slick substance onto the head of the dildo. “Um, just tell me if it’s uncomfortable or anything.”
It was a new kind of magic for Draco. He couldn’t believe that he was here, in Harry Potter’s lap, having the life kissed out of him by the one person with which he’d never believed he had a chance.
His resolve lasted three days. Three days of asking Pansy repeatedly just how sure she was. Three days of being so flustered at his 1pm update that he’d been asked by one of the loathsome journalists if he was feeling alright.
Draco looked at her. “Well, yes, I can tell that people are complying, that’s why the Obliviators haven’t been overrun... but that’s more likely to be the Minister’s influence than mine.”
“Know?” Draco supplied helpfully. “Because you’re about as subtle as a Hippogriff in a tea room, Harry. But don’t stop, because I do love knowing that all I need to do is call you ‘Potter’ and it earns me a free chocolate bar.”
Harry suddenly felt rage begin to take over him as well. “I don’t bloody expect anything! I don’t care if students send anything or not! But I won’t be mocked in my own classroom, no I will not!”
“Of course,” Harry said. “I have to ask, and I hope this isn’t rude, but what made you choose to train at a Muggle University? Birmingham, you said?”
“Thanks for coming in,” Harry said at last, releasing Malfoy’s hand and stuffing his hands awkwardly into his pockets for lack of anything better to do with them.
“I’m sure. The Auror department is a bit different to a hospital though. More... criminals, I guess. There’s a lot of demands on us, and your role supporting me wouldn’t be a straightforward one. Most of all, you’d have to actually listen to me and be someone that I can trust.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s nothing,” he lied, “I’m fine. I’m guessing you’re going to have more to say to me though?”
“Well come on then, you better hurry up. I’m not gonna last much longer with you still pressing that into me.”
Harry just swirled his tongue around the head of Draco’s cock by way of reply, before pushing himself back down onto Draco, somehow taking in even more than he had before. When Draco felt himself hit the back of Harry’s throat, he knew that it was all over for him. He started to feel himself tingle, his balls drew up tight, and the next moment he was coming in a rush, screaming Harry’s name over and over.
They sat quietly for a moment, before Harry finally got the courage to ask what he’d wanted to ask from the moment that he’d seen Draco on his doorstep. “So why did you come over?”
“No,” Harry said, “they’ve already written what they want to write about us. Come on, Draco, they’ve known about us for weeks now, surely that means we can hold hands without any drama?”
“Really, Potter? Because as much as you’re trying to be the serious interviewer here, you’ve managed to accuse me of being a slag, and insisted on knowing the personal reasons of why I want to be in Britain! Is there any way that I could get you to trust me?”
“Hey, Dad,” Scorpius greeted warmly as Draco approached him at the Slytherin table. “Is everything okay with you and Professor Potter? He doesn’t still think it was me that sent that thing does he?”
“Tell me, Potter,” Draco said slowly, “did you mean it? A lot of those things you wrote about me... of a more, uh, intimate nature? Or was that just for the benefit of your readers?”
Malfoy swallowed audibly and bit nervously at his bottom lip. Harry was alarmed to see that his eyes appeared to be filling with tears, so he hastily looked away. Thankfully when Malfoy spoke, there was no waver to his voice.
Harry felt his heart racing. Had Malfoy just called him attractive? He found himself oddly flushed with the compliment, but unsure exactly what to do now. In truth, it was strange that Malfoy could have this effect on him after a decade without having laid eyes on him. But Harry would be lying if he said that he didn’t find Malfoy attractive now.
“Oh shit! I’m so sorry, Draco! Are you okay?” Harry asked, sincerely hoping that he hadn’t just ruined his chance of doing any of what Draco had offered.
A very red-faced Hermione was standing shell shocked in the door, a pile of papers having scattered to the floor at her feet. Draco pulled back from Harry in alarm, causing the remainder of Harry’s release to splash across his face.
Harry shrugged, relaxing more now than he had since Malfoy had arrived. “Thanks. I know it could be worse, but I just hate the intrusion into my life. Bloody hard to do anything without someone turning up and trying to photograph me. They had a whole article exposing my indecision when it came to brands of bread, and what that said about me.”
“So, what did you think?” Dean asked hurriedly. “Sorry, I know he was your first interview, but I just happened to see him leaving and thought I’d be cheeky.”
“Um, sir? I think there’s been a mistake. I swear, I just sent a treacle tart flavoured cake. I don’t know anything about - that,” Scorpius stuttered out.
“It was fine,” Draco replied shortly, “but come on, I’m getting hungry and I want to get out of here now to avoid the gawping masses.”
Finally, Harry put him out of his misery and swallowed Draco down as far as he could go, sucking obscenely around him. He still used his hands to caress what he couldn’t get down his throat, so that the sensations truly threatened to overwhelm Draco at any moment.
Harry looked up and groaned. Dean was grinning down at him, the pile of résumés he’d just deposited on Harry’s desk feeling more to him like an unstable potion than anything to smile about.
“Yeah, I’m ready,” Harry said, deciding that the report could wait until morning. “Come on, I need to hear all about your first day.”
“You’ll be fine. And you know that Granger will join you when necessary, so you don’t need to worry about the politics of it all. Just tell the people that their efforts aren’t in vain, and you’ll win everyone over.”
His cock seemed to be thinking only one thing though, and he decided he’d just have to risk it. He couldn’t go on for four more months like this, that much was certain, and maybe having his bits burnt off might help crush his libido a bit. Not that he would necessarily even count on that at this point.
Draco smiled at his son, taking the empty seat next to him. “Everything is fine, Scorpius, don’t worry. I think your Professor might even apologise to you. I made it clear that it was necessary that he do so.”
Harry felt inwardly thrilled at the praise. He was still half worried that Malfoy would turn around and tell him how shit he was at this. He never would have believed it before today, but he sincerely wanted Malfoy to enjoy this now.
“See, you know I’m right,” Dean concluded happily after a moment. “Now, just promise me that you’ll go into all of the interviews with an open mind? You know I wouldn’t have set them up if I didn’t think they were each going to be genuinely good for you.”
Draco squeezed his hand gently in response. “You know they think I only got this job because you forced your friend to hire me. Plus I’m sick of seeing endless headlines about how I’ve somehow cursed you into being with me.”
“He did, Scorpius, he very much did. Perhaps he didn’t get as much pleasure from it as he did from my gift to him, but nonetheless, I think you can consider it a success.”
“Yes,” Harry said, almost out of reflex, making himself look directly at Malfoy. “Sure. Um, it’s fine.” Harry sat there awkwardly for another moment, playing with the hem of his sleeve.
“See, the thing is, well, it’s just that I was thinking, um, maybe if you thought it was a good idea too - -”
“Why is that?” Draco cut in. “Because you thought the best way to let me know that you couldn’t control yourself for a few bloody months was via the fucking papers?”
“Well, I don’t know, I mean obviously we’re capable of getting along better now than we did at school.” Malfoy snorted, but waved for Harry to continue. “Maybe we could, um, start talking? You know, get to know each other better.”
Potter was watching him carefully, his face curious. The total embarrassment of before seemed to have faded somewhat.
“I don’t care who you do or do not sleep with,” Harry hissed, wondering how on earth they’d got onto this topic. This was not the direction he’d meant for this interview to go in. “You’re the one who mentioned that... issue with the Finnish Minister’s son!”
She shut the door that Draco had left open behind him and, after casting a quick cleaning charm on it, sat down in the seat that he had vacated.
Draco summoned himself a cup of tea from the break room. Ridiculous questions about whether or not this was worth it had him riled. He thought he’d answered well, but it bothered him. Couldn’t people understand why they had to do this? He’d told them often enough.
“Obviously,” Malfoy muttered, but his words lacked their usual venom due to him choosing that moment to rid himself of all his clothes with a quick flick of his wand.
It took several more minutes of Harry carefully working Malfoy open, until Malfoy was finally writhing and panting against the desk, pushing himself back onto Harry’s fingers in an attempt to push him deeper inside.
“I don’t think you’re an idiot, Harry,” Malfoy said gently, and the use of Harry’s first name had him snapping his eyes up to meet Malfoy’s head on. “I wouldn’t have come here if I thought you were. You’re the youngest Head Auror the Ministry has ever seen. I know some of what you accomplished as a field Auror, and I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t impressed. So no, I don’t think you’re an idiot.”
“You will,” he promised, knowing full well that he’d never hear the end of it if she didn’t have all the details the moment he knew.
Harry waved away his apology. “It’s okay, you don’t need to apologise. I don’t blame you given the circumstances. If she weren’t my boss I’d have probably taken off from there as fast as I could too, to be honest.”
Pansy laughed. “Oh, darling, you know you’re brilliant at your job. You’ve been in charge of maintaining the statute for the past three years. This might be a bigger challenge than usual, but it’s nothing you can’t handle.”
Almost on cue, a knock sounded on the door that Harry just knew would be Dean. Sure enough, the door swung open to reveal his tentative smile aimed in Harry’s direction.
He heard the distant sound of what sounded like footsteps, which he sincerely hoped belonged to his boyfriend and not to one of the leagues of hangers on that frequented his flat. Draco had learnt to be civilised to the hoards of Weasleys that he now saw on a regular basis, but he didn’t want to see them more than necessary either, especially not now when he thought their presence would truly ruin his plans.
His expression caused Harry to feel a tug in his gut that had nothing to do with his attraction to Draco, and was born entirely out of guilt for having caused the anxiety that was now written clearly on the man’s face.
“You haven’t! I knew something seemed a little off about your reaction when I arrived. I thought you just didn’t believe that I’d turn up! But you don’t know anything about what I’ve been up to since school, do you?”
They stood there in silence for what felt like an eternity, but must have only been a few seconds. Harry was so conflicted. On the one hand his brain was telling him that this was ridiculous and he should be chasing Malfoy out of his office with a stinging hex for good measure.
“I’m not going to be patient for bloody long, Potter. In case you’ve forgotten, it’s been two bloody months!”
“We’ve been over this,” Draco groaned, “Look, Harry, I’m sorry that I snapped, but that Muggle totally had it coming! What the hell was he doing yelling at us like that?”
That made Draco roll his eyes again, and Harry was starting to realise that he actually rather liked it. “Of course we could, but it’s easier to just not get them dirty in the first place, isn’t it? And besides, I wouldn’t mind actually seeing... you know.” He motioned towards Harry’s crotch as he trailed off.
He made to get up, but Harry waved at him to sit down. “It doesn’t bother me, Malfoy,” Harry sighed. “How could it? I’ve done that too. I mean you’re not the only one who you know...”
Harry stared almost transfixed as Draco started to undress himself. He hadn’t been able to look at him this openly before now, and now that he had been given the opportunity to just watch him, he wasn’t going to waste it. Draco was undeniably one of the most handsome men that Harry had ever seen, and Harry felt his body responding.
Harry started to wonder if he’d ever get Dave out of his office. This was only the first interview, and if the other two were like this then Harry wouldn’t be surprised if his head had exploded by the end of the day.
Harry looked at the two Malfoy men sat in front of him, and for the first time felt his confidence waning. The elder looked irate and ready to explode at any moment, while Scorpius was looking confused and a little nervous.
“You know I don’t like it either when people react like that to us kissing,” Harry sighed, “but Draco you can’t just punch people in the face every time you hear some kind of homophobic comment!”
“Alright, err, sorry,” Harry replied stupidly, his mind beginning to fog over as he locked his eyes on Malfoy’s bottom, his cock becoming painfully hard. He stepped closer towards Malfoy, the dildo still clasped tight in his hand.
His concern had been for nothing if Draco’s answering groan was anything to go by. Harry was thrilled to see that Draco was just as hard as he himself was, and that he appeared to be equally effected by this whole experience.
“Of course it is! No one else would have got more than a fine. But you know the public still struggles...”
Malfoy had the good graces to look ashamed. “True. And like I said before, I am sorry. Really. I know it won’t make up for anything... but I have changed from the awful person that you remember. Mostly. I won’t claim I’m perfect, but I’m trying to be better.”
“Don’t lose your mind now, Potter. It’ll somehow end up being my fault. My insanity-inducing arse will make headlines the world over.”
“Oh,” Harry replied dumbly. Maybe that hadn’t been such a terrible thing after all, despite his initial embarrassment.
“Let’s go,” Harry said, standing up and summoning his coat. “You know I haven’t got anything planned for dinner, so if you’re wanting to eat quickly then we better buy something on the way.”
This time it was Malfoy who laughed, his face lit up with a sort of manic glee. Harry felt something inside him crumple at the reaction, and he turned away to start finally getting dressed himself. After a moment, he felt Malfoy’s hand gently touch him on the back.
Malfoy let out a somewhat garbled laugh. “I’m honoured, Potter. You don’t feel so bad in there yourself.”
Harry ran his hand along his neck again, noticing the first signs of a headache setting in. He didn’t want to admit that he might be wrong, because that would mean admitting that he’d called in a barely-of-age student to his office and brandished a dildo at him, which probably wasn’t what the school board would consider professional conduct.
Draco couldn’t sit still any longer. He leapt to his feet, Potter following suit seconds later, a look of confusion crossing his face.
Harry huffed. He didn’t need the reminder. It was one of a number of things that he and Ginny had fought about over the years, before Harry had finally realised the real reason that he didn’t feel comfortable in the relationship.
Thankfully Harry didn’t answer, instead using his tongue to gently lap at the head of Draco’s cock now. Draco had been fantasising about this exact thing for weeks, and yet somehow none of his fantasies were as anywhere close to brilliant as the real thing. And Harry hadn’t even properly got started yet.
Harry walked him towards the door, and Draco was very aware of his presence with every step they took. He’d never disliked his 1pm engagement more.
“I will,” Hermione said. “I don’t know what weird way you have of interviewing these people, Harry, but Dean assured me that you had it all under control. I hope he’s not lying!”
“Now that,” Draco said, reaching out and running his hand over the outline of Harry’s cock through his trousers, “sounds like an excellent idea. So, which way to the bedroom?”
Bugger. Harry knew that was a stupid suggestion. He had a few that he usually relied on, but none of them were quite right for this situation.
Pansy shook her head. “You really are clueless, darling. Although I suppose in this case I can forgive you on account of you being rather occupied trying to save our world. The people adore you. And they’re being remarkably compliant.”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. She was certainly refreshing, and Harry appreciated her honesty. “So, tell me more about being a nanny? What was it like?”
Harry just chuckled lightly, completely unsurprised by Malfoy’s continuing impatience. He never had been good at waiting to get what he wanted in Harry’s experience. What was different on this occasion though, was that Harry was just as desperate to make sure that Malfoy did get what he wanted.
“I know today will be tough for you,” Hermione said consolingly, “but just keep in mind that you need to get someone new here. It’s been months now since Maja resigned, and you can’t keep trying to do everything yourself.”
“Draco! Oi, Draco! I know you’re there, you idiot, you literally can’t leave your house. Will you come and talk to me?”
“I guess that’ll have to do for now. Look, love, I have to get to work, I just wanted to make sure you were fine first, okay? I’ll call you again tonight.”
“That you used to love them back at school! Obviously he was wrong... I’m sorry, Professor, I’ll do the detention, just tell me what you want me to do.”
“Excellent,” Draco said, stepping forward to give Harry a quick kiss on the cheek. “I’ll look forward to it.”
She tutted and came into the room, settling herself in the chair opposite him and crossing her legs primly. “Not checking up as such,” she said, “but I did think I better see how you were doing before your interviews today. I know it’s not your favourite thing to do.”
“Silly,” Pansy chided. “The one who runs your fan club! You wanted me to track them down, and I have. You’ll never believe it.”
He didn’t miss the flicker of hurt and confusion that crossed Harry’s face before he managed to cover it.
Harry nodded, unable to argue with Malfoy’s shrewd observations. He just wished that he knew what exactly Malfoy wanted from him now. Bravery was only useful so long as one had an inkling of when they needed to use it.
Harry didn’t disappoint, but he was quickly starting to feel that he’d like to get rid of the bloody toy and replace it with his own cock. Malfoy was driving him crazy and he was becoming desperate to get inside him.
Harry was surprised to hear that Malfoy had been working in such a Muggle domain. Draco Malfoy at an airport? If Harry had been asked before today, he’d have sworn that Malfoy didn’t even know what an airport was, let alone that he’d have spent any time in one.
Harry shook his head, and turned to face Malfoy again. “Fine. Althoug I should point out that I have excellent taste in restaurants. There you go, that’s something you’ve learnt about me.”
“And you know you still owe Aoife for covering for us last week,” Draco reminded him. “That was definitely outside of the secretary job description. You shouldn’t have screamed so loud.”
“Can you not find out who runs it?” Draco asked Pansy. “You’re always so good with little detective work.”
“Look, I better get going,” Hermione said. “I have a firecall scheduled with the French Minister in an hour and I really better prepare. I expect to hear all about your proposed new employee by the end of the day though, Harry!”
Harry sighed, knowing that Hermione was right. He’d been an idiot to do this, but he’d gotten carried away in the moment and let his urges override his common sense.
Malfoy beamed, every one of his features lighting up, and Harry thought he’d never seen anyone look more gorgeous. “Good,” Malfoy replied, his face flushing slightly. “That’s good.”
“That perhaps it was part of his role in Human Resources to make sure that we weren’t shagging in the office again.”
“I was trying to be considerate,” Draco groused, “but I would be more than happy to let you pleasure me. If you were willing.”
Harry took a minute to process what she was saying. “You mean... you think he might want to see me again?”
Unfortunately Harry had to agree. He just wished that this whole thing would sort itself out without any input from him.
“Of course! How is it fair that I’m being punished too? Only... he didn’t entirely see it that way. So no visits, I’m afraid.”
“Alright,” Harry muttered finally, “I’m just going to conjure a little more lube and then I’ll give you that finger you’ve been so keen for.”
“You know back in school I couldn’t have imagined you ever saying anything like that about Hermione.”
His question was met with an incredulous look. “You can’t seriously be asking me that, Potter? Me, the villain of the war, left free to roam the streets? Oh yes, people are generally delighted to see me and beg me to sit down for a drink with them. Right.” Malfoy crossed his arms, and this time didn’t hold back from rolling his eyes at Harry.
“Sure,” Harry replied, frowning slightly at Dean’s comment. Why wouldn’t he be open minded to the candidates? “Thanks, Dean. I’ll let you know how I get on.”
“Can you tell me, please, why the fuck it is that you have my son doing detention today? And don’t tell me it’s because his end of year thank you gift wasn’t up to the standard that you’d expect like it says in this ridiculous little note! Surely even you aren’t that conceited?”
“Well, if I do the job well, then no one should know. The point was to handle any incidents quickly and calmly without causing a scene and running the risk of breaking the Statute.”
It took a moment, but Potter finally lifted his head and looked at Draco, the bravery he was so renowned for shining through at last.
There Harry was, dancing away happily in various nightclubs, body pressed far too close against far too many different men for Draco’s liking. They usually went together and Draco could intervene before the dancing turned into something more like rutting, which, he thought with disgust, appeared to be exactly what his bloody boyfriend had done with half of London the night previous.
Eventually it was Malfoy who spoke again. “Look, Potter, I can guarantee that I have done plenty over the last few years that would qualify me for this role. But if there’s no chance of you hiring me, then is there any point in us continuing?”
“Excellent,” Malfoy said, smiling more broadly than he had at any point since he’d arrived. “Thank you, Potter. That’s- that’s great.”
“And yet, somehow, I don’t think that’s what you’re really worried about right now. And if it’s not my reaction that’s bothering you, then I’m left to guess that it’s Malfoy’s.”
“And then I told the Brazilian Ambassador in no uncertain terms that there was really no need to make such a fuss about one little escaped dragon! I mean honestly. How fortunate that I’m fluent in Portuguese, wouldn’t you say?”
Harry grinned. “Okay, Draco. What would you say to more kissing then? Only, as nice as this chat is, I have to admit that I was enjoying myself more before.”
In the moments after Malfoy had spilled over Harry’s hand and onto his desk, Harry suddenly became very aware that he was still inside Malfoy’s body, and perhaps this would no longer be welcome. Very gently, he pulled himself out, quickly casting a cleaning charm on himself as he saw Malfoy turn around and do the same.
For a few minutes there was silence except for the scratching of the quill as Scorpius wrote furiously. Harry was reminded of why he hated giving detentions, because it also meant that he was prevented from doing what he wanted.
Scorpius nodded and scurried off, and not for the first time Harry was left wishing that the invitation to families of departing students had never been extended. As he heard the door click closed behind Scorpius, he turned to face the elder Malfoy, bracing himself for the explosion. It never came.
Malfoy laughed, the sound ringing out around Harry’s office. “No reason at all, Potter. Look, I’ve changed since school, but perhaps you haven’t. I’m really a rather boring grown man now, but yes, I have had relationships with men throughout the last few years, and if that bothers you then there’s no point in us continuing with this.”
“Nicely answered,” Harry admitted. “I’ve never had kids myself, but my godchildren can be a serious handful at times! They’re wonderful though, and I wish I had more time with them.”
Malfoy sighed dramatically, and threw his arms in the air. “You’ve barely spoken to me for twenty years, and yet you seem convinced that after all this time I’d still want to make fun of you like we’re teenagers again?”
“You’re right,” he conceded, slumping further in his chair. “I’ve been stupid. I don’t know what I was thinking.”
Draco brought his hands up to cup Harry’s bum, gently kneading his cheeks. When he pushed Harry forward slightly, taking him in even deeper still, Harry let out a long, low groan. Draco was holding nothing back, encouraging Harry to keep thrusting and hitting the back of his throat.
“Wouldn’t you love to know? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I better get dressed and go to meet my son for dinner. I don’t think he’d believe me even if I told him what we did, but nonetheless, best to avoid any awkward conversations.”
Harry looked at Malfoy, hoping that he would follow his son out of the room and they’d never have to speak about this again. Of course, he wouldn’t be so lucky.
She waved to him cheerily as she headed out the door, not doing anything to alleviate the dread that Harry felt about what lay ahead of him. He had ten minutes now until the first interview, and he was going to use that time to make himself a good cup of tea. At least that way if the interview was a disaster, he’d still have something to enjoy.
“I wasn’t discussing anything! It was a genuine misunderstanding! I’m still not sure I understand how this all happened, but you have to see how it looked from my point of view. I’m still not convinced you didn’t have something to do with it.”
“You definitely used to think I was an idiot,” Harry replied at last, “or at least you said I was often enough.”
Hermione looked a little taken aback by the quick apology, but attempted a comforting smile in his direction. Harry was still feeling a little shellshocked by how quickly everything had just happened, and he couldn’t help but feel disappointed that Draco had just run out of there as fast as he had.
“You know, Potter, I have no idea why you’d be so upset about receiving that anyway. It’s very good quality.”
Malfoy snorted softly, but it wasn’t anything like the cruel way in which Harry remembered him doing so at school. It was terribly close to sounding fond.
“Well, what would you like to ask me then? You know, in terms of my qualifications for being your secretary?”
“Yes,” Malfoy said again. “Fine,” he sighed, noting Harry’s raised eyebrows, “perhaps more than a little. But, I’d appreciate if we could put that behind us. For what it’s worth, I am sorry for what I did to you in school, and you know... after.”
Harry’s eyes widened in shock, but within a moment he realised that he sort of had just asked him out, and thought it would look foolish to back out now.
“You know, Draco, I really don’t care, as long as you get me off, and fast. I got so fucking close just by tasting you and I’m ready to pop any moment here.”
Harry leaned back in his chair and surveyed the small pile of gifts that had accumulated across his desk. It still amused him to receive these every year, but he’d long since given up trying to prevent it from happening.
Draco smiled. “I assume she told you that. Yeah, we usually have a quick run through of what I’m going to say, make sure that she’s happy.”
Harry sighed and ran his hand through his hair. “It’s not just a matter of what they can do technically though, is it? I need to find a way to make sure that they’re someone I can trust and rely on. I could never have got to that stage with him. He just... wasn’t the right fit for me. I know, maybe he would have been good at getting stuff done, but... I couldn’t have worked with him.”
“Well, I guess this is it then, Potter. Probably the strangest job interview I’ve ever had, if I’m honest.”
“Well, I’d like to think that once you have a secretary on board, you’ll hopefully have some more time available to you to spend as you wish,” Aoife said.
Granger groaned and sat back in her chair. “Well, I suppose we better work on a plan to sell this to the magical community.”
Harry couldn’t understand why Malfoy was looking so bewildered, so he settled for just glaring at him. Scorpius to his credit just continued to write as though there had been no interruption.
After taking a moment to compose himself, he cleared his throat and asked, “Are you honestly saying that you had nothing to do with this?”
“So you started a fan club,” Draco said with a smirk. “Interesting way to show your appreciation, Potter. But I can’t say that I mind terribly.”
“Excellent. I trust you know what you’re doing with that,” Malfoy added, gesturing to the toy that Harry was strangely still grasping in his hand. “You better not bloody hurt me.”
The next few weeks passed painfully slowly. Draco wished that he could at least have a decent meal; for all that the food provided by the ministry fully met his nutritional needs, the taste varied from bland to even more bland.
“I was thinking more along the lines of that thing you mentioned where you bend over my bed while I fuck you? But only after I’ve had the chance to suck you off first, of course. I’m not forgetting that we definitely had unfinished business when we were interrupted before.”
Yet despite all their painful shared history, Potter somehow wanted to kiss Draco, and now they were standing in Potter’s living room on a cold Tuesday morning with their lips melding into one another, and Draco didn’t think he ever wanted to leave.
“So you’re claiming you didn’t send me this?” Harry asked, waving the ridiculously large toy above his head like some kind of madman.
Draco sighed, resigning himself to the fact that Harry was actually correct, and being the stubborn fool that he was, might be there for half the day if Draco didn’t answer him.
“You know you should try this yourself sometime. Don’t be so afraid to have something up there, Potter. It feels bloody amazing once you get into it.”
Harry checked his watch. “Ten minutes. No idea who they are, but at least they can’t be worse than Dave, right?”
Dean sighed dramatically and flopped into the chair across from Harry. “Seriously, mate. You know I’d love to help you out, but working for Hermione’s good for me. I’ve gone through all the candidates and I think those are the best for you. Interviews are set up for tomorrow.”
“Goodbye, Harry. I might see you round.” Malfoy gave him what seemed like an almost sad smile as he turned around, and finally Harry clicked.
“You do. The Saviour of our world, devoting your life to ridding the world of dark forces. And yet, you aren’t brave enough to say whatever it is that you want to say to me.”
“Hey,” Draco said lamely, with what he was sure would be a ridiculously soppy smile gracing his features.
“Well obviously. I get it, have a laugh at the gay professor. Congratulations, you did. And while I can’t impose any consequence on you, I can on Scorpius at least for the next few days. Hence, he’s writing lines.”
Draco nodded. It was odd really, how well he and Granger worked together. It certainly hadn’t been an easy process when he’d first started in his role at the Ministry, but they’d both been professional enough to maintain a working relationship. These days he had to admit that he had developed a deep respect for her as Minister, and sometimes he was terribly worried that he liked her as a person.
Malfoy reached his hand out and ran his hand down Harry’s cheek. “You’re sure, Potter? I don’t want you to do anything that you’re not comfortable with. But if you are sure, I’ll strip my trousers off this second and bend myself over that fine looking desk of yours.”
Potter made a small groan of embarrassment, but didn’t drop his gaze from Draco. “I meant it. It was all true. And you can hate me if you want, but I just feel something. I don’t know what exactly. But I just can’t get you out of my head. I don’t want to get you out of my head. I just want you.”
“Well I mean, last I checked, as a gay man myself I thought I could choose whether or not I liked certain foods. But you’re telling me now that supposedly gifting treacle tarts to a gay man is a bloody hate crime and I’m curious as to why!”
“Point accepted. You shouldn’t have to deal with that though, you know. It’s not... it’s not right. You don’t deserve that.”
What really was driving him crazy, as he had known that it would, was the lack of contact with Harry. In the year that they’d been together, they’d never gone so long without physical contact. Especially the intimate kind. The odd touch of each other’s face as they floo called back and forth really just didn’t cut it.
Draco waved her away, and kept reading. He was shocked. Whoever this was, they clearly were rather infatuated with him. He wasn’t entirely sure how he felt about it, but he supposed if it helped make people listen to him then that was something.
“Because,” Dean began in a patronisingly soothing tone, “I think the Minister might be disappointed were she to lose me to her Head Auror.” Dean had the cheek to pat him on the head at this point, and Harry had to bat him away.
This guy was a complete knobhead. Harry had spent the last ten minutes deciding what one word would best describe the man’s personality, and he’d eventually landed on that. Nothing else seemed to fit. Harry understood the general idea of interviews was to sell yourself to your employer, but this man seemed to be trying to apply for an Order of Merlin.
Harry sat back in his chair, smiling slightly to himself that there was no way that Malfoy could refute that. He’d always loved scoring points over him; it was odd really how quickly the old rush of competitiveness came surging back between them.
Harry wondered for a moment if his initial assessment had been fair. One word wasn’t enough to sum up everything that was wrong with Dave. Just how stuck up could one man be? He was somehow a more extreme version of Percy Weasley, and that was something that Harry had hoped to never come across, even if he must admit that he had started to get along quite well with Percy as they’d grown older.
“Thanks, Harry,” Draco murmured, pressing a quick kiss to Harry’s forehead. “I know I shouldn’t let it get to me, but I’m not as good at brushing it off as you are.”
“Hmm. I’ll consider it. We should probably see how the first date goes though. Wouldn’t want to rush into anything too soon.” He winked exaggeratedly for effect and Harry just laughed again.
“This,” Harry said, holding the toy out to Malfoy, “this is the delightful little present that your son got me. As I take it on your word, because ‘I used to enjoy them so much at Hogwarts’.”
Harry couldn’t believe that he was doing this, that he was about to take out and start waving about a bloody sex toy in the middle of his office in front of a student and Malfoy, but he supposed worse things had happened in his life.
They finished getting dressed in silence, and Malfoy made his way towards the door. He paused with his hand on the door handle, and turned to face Harry. “You know I still expect you to apologise to Scorpius. Even if there may have been certain, um, benefits, to our little discussion.”
Harry groaned. He wanted to deny it outright, his mouth was even forming the words, but his body was completely betraying him and instead of saying something sensible, he just let out a strangled grunting sound. It wasn’t bloody fair. He didn’t even like Malfoy, but he couldn’t deny that the man did have a certain attractiveness about him.
For a moment, Harry felt like he’d forgotten how to speak. He swallowed nervously, feeling a blush rise up his body. Finally, he managed to concentrate enough to ground out a simple, “I do, yes.”
All too soon they broke apart, but Harry didn’t step back. They were both breathing heavily, but Harry was relieved to see that Malfoy wasn’t looking like their kiss had disgusted him. Quite to contrary, he was looking rather pleased with himself, and Harry couldn’t stifle a small chuckle.
“Then we risk the statute being broken beyond repair,” she sighed. “One hundred Muggles this week alone have witnessed obvious magic. How?”
Three months had passed since Draco’s interview-turned-rendezvous in Harry’s office, and it felt to Harry as though it had all passed by in a blur. Harry had completed a one month suspension and a professional standards course over what had transpired that day, on Hermione’s insistence that as Minister, she simply had to report something of that nature to Human Resources.
“If you’re worried that he somehow coerced me into this, then you shouldn’t be. I’m not going to be complaining about it. We’d already discussed that I wouldn’t be getting the role before... well, before what you unfortunately witnessed occurred. So, perhaps we could just forget that it ever happened?”
“You heard, Harry. It’s no bloody secret that I’m attracted to you, I mean, if you couldn’t figure that out from what happened earlier then I retract my comments about you not being an idiot. But I think with everything I know about you that if we tried to do casual... I’d probably just end up getting hurt. And I’m sorry, I don’t want to do that.”
“Fuck,” Harry sighed, letting himself for the first time just admire Malfoy’s body openly, looking at his long lines and sharp angles, the pointy appearance from his youth having softened slightly with age. Harry’s body was certainly responding, and almost without thinking, he’d let a hand wander down to palm at his cock through his trousers.
“I think you know, Potter. Here we are, two single gay men, and there’s a gorgeous, well made dildo in front of us. Is it hard to imagine what we might do?”
Harry gulped, and for the briefest of moments considered denying it. He reminded himself that he was supposed to be brave based on his house sorting, and more importantly that he’d been single for what felt like forever. “Yes. I’m asking you out.”
“Well,” he began slowly, “you know how when we call each other, we can sort of touch? Like you’ve played with my hair, stroked my cheek and so on?”
It was Draco’s turn to huff this time, as he crossed his arms and looked away from Harry. They’d had this argument every day since Draco was arrested and was awaiting his trial. Draco really didn’t agree that he had to just deal with that kind of crap, whatever Harry might say. Why shouldn’t he stand up for himself? For both of them?
He came back to himself after a moment, remembering where he was, and the discomfort from having to lie awkwardly on his elbows hit him in full force. He called out to Harry to give him a minute and he’d call him back, before extracting his lower half from the fireplace, sitting down on the floor, and casting some cleaning charms over himself.
Malfoy lay back in his chair, seemingly completely at ease with what he had just revealed. Harry was gobsmacked. He hadn’t even known that Malfoy was gay, let alone that he’d been swanning around Nordic countries breaking the hearts of politician’s sons. That was certainly interesting.
“Of course,” Harry replied sincerely. “I really don’t understand how it happened. Or who even sent it, they can’t have included a note.”
Harry dropped his head into his hands and groaned. Trust Malfoy to still be able to get to him after so long out of his life. This was exactly why he’d been avoiding him despite any assurances that he’d changed.
Dean looked quite taken aback. “Really? I don’t think he’s that bad, Harry. And he does have a lot of relevant experience. Did you know they even wanted him at Gringotts? You could do worse than him, mate.”
His update had been gruelling as ever. At least some of the questions had been lighthearted today though. He’d enjoyed being asked about whether wizards could pat Muggle dogs.
He’d spent about half that time having to convince an unimpressed Narcissa Malfoy that Draco was not in fact in any trouble with the Aurors, but that Harry would like to speak to him all the same and to please let him know that if she saw him. She still seemed suspicious when Harry left, but he had at least established that Draco was not actually staying with his mother.
A look of relief swept across Draco’s face, before he grinned right back at Harry and closed the distance between them.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t think so. It’s possible there was one and it fell somewhere when I accidentally knocked everything on the floor though.”
“Well, Harry, are you just going to stand there all day or are you going to come over here and help us both have a good time?”
Finding Draco was easier said than done. He had been long gone from the Ministry by the time Harry had tried to follow him, and he’d now spent over an hour trying to track him down.
“It wouldn’t be a problem, Potter. Look, if you can’t put our history behind you then that’s fine...”
“I’m not going to last long,” Draco warned breathlessly, his embarrassment of his stamina disappearing with every little lick that Harry gave him.
Harry shook his head, but couldn’t hold back a smile. “Oh, you definitely hadn’t been overestimating your skills. It was... I mean, you were brilliant. Really brilliant. Honestly, it was so bloody good, Draco.”
“Um, yeah, I guess I am,” Harry said. “Well, we haven’t seen each other in a long time, and I don’t know, I thought it’d be nice to get to know you a bit better now, yeah? You’ve obviously been up to some interesting stuff. And we’ve established that we’re attracted to each other, so is dating that bad an idea?”
Once he’d pulled his head back out of the flames, he took a moment to pull himself together. He was now hard as a rock and desperate for nothing more than to shove his lower half into the flames, not giving a fuck about what might happen. But Harry did have a point about the being set on fire thing. Perhaps he should consider this more carefully.
“Wait,” Harry said impulsively. When Malfoy turned back around to look at him, Harry suddenly realised that he had no idea what he’d been intending to follow that up with.
Pushing the tip of the toy into Malfoy felt like something out of a dream. The moans and grunts coming from Malfoy’s mouth did nothing to make it feel more real either, because before today Harry could never have imagined him making such filthy noises. Right now he was wondering just why he’d never thought of Malfoy in this way before.
Harry’s eyes widened and he stuttered slightly in protest. “Excuse me,” he finally forced out, “but like any normal person, I know I want to buy bread, but I might still look at the selection of bread on offer when I get there! You’d have loved that story wouldn’t you? Had a right old laugh at idiot Harry buying his groceries.”
“Well, yes, I was passing,” Hermione said, making herself comfortable in the seat opposite him. “And well, yes, Dean did mention that you were a little unhappy after your last interview, so I thought I better run interference so you didn’t bite my poor secretary’s head off this time.”
Draco stared at him for a minute, his mouth opening and closing as though he were struggling with what to say next. Harry was starting to get concerned that he’d said something wrong when at last he noticed a smile starting to form at the edges of his mouth.
“No, Scorpius, I think I’d like a little word with Professor Potter here first. I’ll meet you for dinner in the Great Hall later.”
“I’ve had plenty of practice with the papers writing rubbish about me,” Harry said with a shrug. “You’ve had a decade of travelling where no one knew you, so it was bound to be a shock.”
He’d denied himself this particular fantasy, never believing that Harry would be attracted to someone like him, but now he could do more than fantasise. It was wonderful and glorious and feeling Harry’s hardness against him was enough to make his head spin.
Draco didn’t bother replying to that, and instead he brought their mouths together once again. Their first kiss may have been slow and gentle, but this time neither of them were holding back. Harry moaned audibly as Draco plunged his tongue urgently into Harry’s willing mouth, their bodies pressed almost impossibly tightly together.
“Good luck, mate. There’s only three you’re interviewing. If you really don’t like any of them then let me know. But I think you’ll be alright.”
Scorpius appeared to visibly relax next to him. “That’s great, Dad, thank you. I know it’s silly to worry about it, but I am glad that he actually liked that cake.”
Harry knew that he couldn’t last long and he slowed down to tell Draco as much. Draco grinned, releasing Harry’s cock with a small popping sound.
“Ah yeah, you’re right. I just don’t know what kind of a gift says ‘thank you for turning up the wireless and then lying to the Minister because I was too stupid to cast a silencing charm while my boyfriend fucked me in my office!’ And there aren’t many people I can ask for advice on the issue...”
“Am I not? I just don’t see why you had to involve your son in this endeavour of yours. You want to revert to being the tosser you were at Hogwarts then fine, but why would you involve your own son? Great example you’re setting there.”
“Don’t look like that, Harry. Of course I’d love to straddle you on that ridiculous sofa and get straight to fucking, but I just don’t know if I can do the whole casual thing. Not with you. I can feel the heartbreak coming from a mile away.”
They stood there silent and immobile for a few moments, and Harry began to wonder what he was supposed to do now. He had no idea what the protocol was when admitting that you found your old high school enemy attractive, but he figured it probably wasn’t just standing about and looking awkward.
Draco laughed. “She’s the Minister, Harry. Of course she expects a lot of her staff! I think today went well though.”
Draco hadn’t been lying - he really was ridiculously good at this. Harry only had a moment in which to feel a token of jealousy toward the other men that Draco had done this to, until he stopped caring about much at all other than his own pleasure.
“You know,” Draco panted, detaching his mouth from Harry’s, “I do realise that you are attempting to avoid having me talk more about your awful pick up line?”
“Yes, um, lovely to meet you too. I’ll be in touch.” Harry offered his hand and Dave grasped it firmly as they exchanged a quick handshake.
“Now, come on, we both need food. Plus I’m dying to hear what it was like working for Hermione. Tell me, is she really as tough on her secretary as Dean always implied?”
“You know, I really do wonder sometimes just how you managed to save the world all those years ago, Potter. Now, I really better be going. I’ll send you an owl once I’ve found a suitable restaurant. It’s been a better afternoon than I anticipated.”
Draco held his breath, unable to make himself look up to meet Harry’s eyes, focussing instead on an interesting looking log lying next to his face amongst the flames.
“Would you want me to suck you?” Draco blurted out. “I mean, I don’t know if you’d like that obviously, I mean I just thought...”
“Oh, believe me, you’ll have a hard time stopping yourself from snogging me once I’ve told you this news, but please refrain yourself. That would be entirely inappropriate.”
Harry hurriedly summoned his wand and conjured something to cover both himself and Draco, who was now sitting on the floor attempting to protect his modesty. Harry finally turned to face Hermione, who was looking more furious by the second.
Draco scowled. “Yes, and if I hadn’t, it would have been pretty easy to figure out given that over breakfast this morning, I read far too much detail about what you supposedly did to celebrate the beginning of the weekend.”
Draco gave Harry one last, salacious grin, and then sank down to his knees in front of him. It was by far the most erotic image that Harry had seen in his life; Draco Malfoy on his knees, his mouth hovering an inch from Harry’s incredibly hard cock.
“Stop that, Potter,” Malfoy hissed, “you’re being ridiculous. Put that away before you take someone’s eye out.”
“Hmm, maybe you’ll have to convince me first,” Draco replied cheekily. “What do you want to do when we get there? Have a lie down? Brush each other’s hair?”
“No, not at all. It’s a completely inappropriate gift as I think I’ve said repeatedly, and it’s the reason why we’re here.”
“Oh, Draco,” Potter moaned into his mouth, and oh, what that did to Draco to hear his name, his first name, fall so easily from Potter’s tongue.
Harry grinned, because of course Draco would be worried about getting his clothes dirty in a moment like this.
That certainly helped Draco’s ego. “Did you really? I’m honoured. Should we try this now then, or would you rather wait until tonight?”
“With us?” Draco finished for him, and Harry nodded. “Yes, of course I’m aware that the average idiot on the street can’t accept our relationship, but I would have expected the Wizengamot to hold themselves to a higher standard.”
For the first time, Draco felt a pang of nervousness that had nothing to do with whether or not his idea was feasible, and was entirely to do with Harry’s reaction.
“No,” Harry answered swiftly, summoning his office chair to sit in and gesturing for Draco to sit in the seat he had been in earlier. “Of course not! How could you - either of you - think I’d do that?”
“Why can’t you be just be my secretary?” Harry asked, knowing that he sounded like a whining child but choosing not to care.
“I must remember to choose gifts appropriately,” Harry responded after a moment, pleased with himself for the quick thinking. “Let’s say two hundred times. I should think that will be enough, and then we’ll forget this whole thing.”
His boyfriend was particularly displeased with him. Apparently six months without sex was something of an imposition for him, and Draco couldn’t really argue with that. He wasn’t delighted with that either, but then, as Draco had argued multiple times, this whole thing wasn’t even Draco’s fault. Not really.
Malfoy shot him a slightly surprised look, before covering it with a small cough and saying, “well, my last job was in Finland, as I’m sure you know. I was working for their Ministry at Helsinki Airport, trying to intercept any witches or wizards flying into the country who may have brought contraband items with them.”
“Well, of course she would make the most sense,” Pansy said, a much too wicked smile on her face, “but she’s terribly busy, darling. So you see, as head of this charming department, you’re it.”
Harry had lost any willpower to walk away from Malfoy and he didn’t even try to pretend that that wasn’t exactly what he wanted.
Harry’s voice was faint, much fainter than it would have been normally, but he could hear him, and most importantly feel him, exactly as he’d wanted to.
“Neither did I,” Harry said honestly, “but it’s true. Then again, you’ve always been good at making me see things differently, Malfoy.”
“I know. Look, I need to head off, I’m going out tonight with Seamus and a couple of the other guys from work. You’ll be alright?”
He had almost finished his firewhiskey when he heard the faint knock on the door. At first, he wasn’t sure if he was just hearing things, but then it came again more insistently, and Harry leapt up.
“Harry,” Draco breathed, deepening the kiss, and pushing his body up against Harry’s. They stumbled slightly, taking a few steps back towards the chair that Harry had vacated moments earlier, Draco sliding down Harry until he was straddling him in the chair.
“Well then. I suppose you better get rid of that face of yours from my fireplace and replace it with your bloody gorgeous cock.”
Draco laughed and made himself comfortable on one of the armchairs in the small living room of Harry’s flat, while Harry sat on the sofa across from him. “She didn’t have to work hard to find me, you know. I was looking like a fool standing outside your office waiting for you to come back. Fortunately she came past and directed me here. She said you probably wouldn’t mind.”
“I’m not, I’m not, I know it was me,” Harry said. “Um, so does this mean... well, I guess I understand if you just want to go now.” Harry watched Draco closely, hoping that his own stupidity hadn’t just lost him a shot with Draco.
Harry was relieved to hear that Malfoy was close to spilling over, because he knew that he couldn’t prevent his own orgasm now for more than a few moments. He gave a couple of urgent, powerful thrusts into Malfoy, and then came with a startled cry.
Right, so that was how he wanted to play it, Harry thought. He had to admit that Malfoy seemed to have changed somewhat, certainly in terms of appearance. His hair had grown slightly, giving him a more relaxed look than he’d ever had at school. His clothing too was different; he had chosen to incorporate some Muggle fashion elements into his outfit, the dark wizarding robes falling over an elegant suit. Harry had to admit that he looked good.
“That’s not why I called,” Draco hastened to add, “although if you could get those idiots to stop writing that shit about you I’d appreciate it. No, I called because I had an idea.”
The answering snort was a little much in Harry’s opinion, but it was softened somewhat when Draco stood up and walked over to him, placing his knees either side of Harry’s thighs and kissing him clean on the mouth.
“Look, Potter, if you’re not going to even use that, I could always take it off your hands. After all, I’m a single man, and such things do come in handy.”
Conjuring a small slip of paper, he scrawled a note and sent it to the dungeons, informing Scorpius that he must report to his office the following afternoon to complete detention. Harry fully expected to give the brat a good piece of his mind as soon as he could. For now, he’d have to attempt to sleep in a much worse mood than he’d anticipated before opening his end of year gifts.
“Me!” Harry squeaked. “I thought your idea was for you to try it first! I don’t want my bits to be set on fire! Or turned into a bloody firework display.”
“I accept,” Malfoy murmured. “Potter, I would very much enjoy going on a date with you. But I’m choosing the restaurant, because I don’t trust you not to take us to the Leaky or some other ghastly old pub.”
The rest of the interview passed without great incident, and after an hour, Harry found himself waving Aoife off with a much more positive feeling than he’d had at the end of Dave’s interview.
“So, um, right, yes, okay, Finland,” Harry mumbled meaninglessly. “Why come home now, though? If you’ve been there all this time?”
Steeling his nerves, he raised his fist and banged on the door to Potter’s home. It took a few moments before he answered, and Draco was already beginning to wonder if this was a bad idea.
“Fuck, of course it’s a yes,” Draco replied exasperatedly. “Or I suppose a ‘no’ really given that what you asked me was ‘is dating that bad an idea?’”
“It’s okay, Potter. I’m quite aware that he deserves to be in Azkaban, I’m not arguing otherwise. But it would be a lie to say that it hasn’t taken a toll on my mother.”
Pansy smirked. “Of course not, darling, that’s sort of the point. I think they prefer anonymity for when they’re discussing which hairstyle they prefer you to wear. What’s your thoughts on you with or without hair gel?”
Harry’s brain was struggling to keep up. Since when was Malfoy even gay? “I mean, what are you talking about? What have treacle tarts got to do with anything?”
“Honestly, no,” she replied with a shrug, “look, perhaps this isn’t something that I should say, but I’m not going to pretend to be someone else. I didn’t find a lot of the options for graduating Hogwarts students all that interesting. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew that I wanted to study more, and so I ended up studying education at Birmingham. And from there, I’ve done a few weird and wonderful things since.”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh again, aware that this probably wasn’t the response that Malfoy would hope for after sex. Harry didn’t think he could pull off some kind of suave indifference though, so grinning like an excited crup would have to suffice.
Harry shuffled his feet backwards, pulling Malfoy’s hips up slightly so that he had a clear space to wrap his hand around Malfoy’s body and start tugging on his length. The change in angle felt somehow more intimate, and Harry realised with a jolt that he liked it.
“I know,” he sighed, “but you wouldn’t have liked this guy either, Hermione. He was so full of himself. But don’t worry, I did like the woman that I just interviewed. You can go and tell Dean that so he doesn’t worry about me attacking him or something.”
“Elliott, though… he was my Crup come to life. Somehow he always knew when I needed him. He would cause distractions, or hide me until my father or his friends lost interest. Take me flying, even. In retrospect, I think it must have been my accidental magic, keeping me safe. Making me imagine… I don’t know. But he was real to me. And he made me feel protected, in a way I haven’t felt since he left. At least, not until you.”
Seamus promptly obliged. Then, before their friends could start cat-calling, they broke apart, summoning two brooms.
“No!” Harry said. “I mean… yes? Sort of. I was trying to protect you, Draco.” He reached out tentatively, but although Draco allowed the touch, he held himself rigidly. Harry’s hand fell away. “Professor,” he said, turning back to Dumbledore, “we have to get his mum out of Malfoy Manor. We owe it to him. Don’t you see that? None of this matters right now. It can wait. She can’t.”
. You convinced Draco to defect. You convinced Dumbledore to rescue his mother. You followed The Plan to the best of your ability. It wasn’t your fault, and it wasn’t his. It’s all right to feel the way you feel.”
“We thought it was only right,” Hermione said. “He – he’s not well, Harry. But he wanted you to know that he’s glad you proved him wrong. About everything.”
; the right to marry outside the bond, the right to own you in every sense of the word, to keep you in whatever condition he chooses. But the law was written by the very rich, powerful Alphas of bygone eras, who stole their Omegas from their true mates. Your bond – a true bond – cannot constrained by such laws and dictates. You are sealed together at the very
“I’m here,” Harry whispered, hugging him hard. He pressed his lips to Draco’s hair, and Draco closed his eyes. “We’ll get through this. I promise.”
“Then you have nothing to worry about. I should not have to explain to you, Miss Granger, that you cannot rely on anyone else to correct any stupid blunders you make during battle. Not even the great Harry Potter.” Snape sneered in his direction, and Harry only just managed not to roll his eyes. “In battle, you must rely on your own knowledge, your own skills, your own wits to survive.”
Draco brushed Harry's hair off his forehead, running a fingertip over his scar. “Yes,” he said. “Lily Potter was Snape’s true mate.”
Draco made a small sound of satisfaction and took hold of his hips, fingers digging in, leaving bruises as he thrust in again, and again, easy and smooth in the wet slick Harry’s body was pumping out. He put his teeth to the back of Harry’s neck; just resting there, the gentle pressure a reminder. Of ownership.
“It’s dealt with,” Draco said. “Severus burnt it himself. He scattered the ashes over half of Scotland. Not even the oldest, Darkest ritual could bring that bastard back now. As for everyone else, I gave a statement to the reporters on your behalf; explained how we defeated Voldemort at last, and what we’ve been doing for the last year.”
thinks it has to, but you don’t have to accept his interpretation, Harry. You can find another way. The prophecy will be fulfilled. Such is the nature of prophecies. But Dumbledore’s interpretation is not the only one. It is, in fact, fundamentally flawed.”
The loyalists had been subdued and taken into custody, but there were already two confirmed deaths; both Slytherins. Fifteen students were already at St Mungo’s, not to mention the dozens more needing treatment for lesser injuries or shock.
Potter frowned. “Luna gave you the Resurrection Stone.” Pansy nodded slowly, understanding beginning to dawn. “You’re the Master of Death.”
She stared at him for a moment. Then she sighed, reaching up to kiss his cheek. “Very well. I will protect him as I would you. But you understand this: I will never choose him over you. I will find a way to save you
“Five, at least,” Hermione said. Not that she was counting. Even the thought of the way she could have lost them all those years ago in the Devil’s Snare still had the power to make her throat close up.
But Draco just smiled at him, looking shyly pleased. Harry realised, with a flooding sense of shame, that Draco didn’t mind that he’d drooled all over him. He was just happy that Harry had trusted him enough to fall asleep on his shoulder.
Hermione’s hand rose to cover her mouth. “Fenrir Greyback?” she whispered. Harry nodded, and she looked horrified. “That’s
Dumbledore sighed. “Which means he no longer has the faculty to understand the difference between consensual sex and rape.”
Harry flinched, looking down at his hands, twisting in the bed-sheets. “I. Gay. I think,” he whispered hoarsely, and Dumbledore sighed and asked him patiently to speak up. “
“Clearly he has good taste,” Harry said. He hesitated. “You know it’s not real, though, right? It’s an illusion, like the bed. It will fade.”
She ducked her head, and even her ears were red now. “I did something really stupid,” she whispered. “After you went to bed last night, he said something that – and I thought, you know, sometimes he’s just so grown up. I really thought he might be ready. And I tried to tell him how I feel, and he just
“The perfect lamb to the slaughter,” Draco murmured. “Praising you for thoughtlessly endangering your life as a
Charlie looked puzzled. “Malfoy put –?” The sound of a distant explosion echoed through the infirmary. Everyone paused. “That’ll be the bridge,” Charlie said, grimly. “Time to go. Anyone else care to join?”
“Straight, downward flick with your wand, from eye-level to your belly-button,” Pomfrey said, gently. “
“Okay, explain this to me again,” Ron said, massaging his temples. “You reckon you can use the Wild Magic to destroy a Horcrux inside a wizard, without killing said wizard, who I happen to be fairly fond of, believe it or not, even though he’s not exactly endearing himself to me
Harry had been loath to trust the man, but, once he had accepted that his son was bonded, for life, to Harry Potter, Lucius had thrown himself into aiding the Light. His information on tactics and safe-houses and potential targets had saved many hundreds of innocent lives. Harry thought it was entirely possible the war had been won much quicker, and with far fewer casualties, because of him.
Pansy glanced at Daphne and Theo, who were sitting a small distance from them. Crabbe and Goyle were between them, but she couldn’t afford for any of them to overhear this conversation. She lowered her voice further. “My word that when you hold up your end of the bargain, I will hold up mine. That hasn’t changed.” As much as she had enjoyed his wrath at her snub at the lake, she couldn’t afford to let him slip the hook. “Draco has made his relationship with Potter official. I intend to use my new ‘relationship’ with Seamus to show my solidarity with him.”
“What was Mr Malfoy doing? Was he alone? With friends? Was he carrying anything? Did he stop to talk to anyone? Did he appear angry? Or pleased?”
“For all the sixth years,” Granger explained. “The seventh years have one after their exams, of course, but we’re not invited to that, and besides, I think it would be a good opportunity for everyone to get to know your housemates in a more informal, relaxed environment.”
Alastor Moody’s head hovered in the flames. “Albus,” he said. “I’ve just received an aborted distress signal from Kingsley. I think we have to assume this is it. The beginning of a full-scale attack.”
!” he hissed, and Harry winced as he saw the broken, bloody teeth. “I told you –” His breath hitched. “It said – it said it was going to
“Not exactly, I’m afraid, Miss Granger,” Madam Pomfrey sighed. “It’s certainly not something the average witch or wizard could do.” And then, seeing their faces, “It’s just a working theory, for now. I will need more evidence before I come to any solid conclusions.”
“Is that what a good, obedient little Omega would have done?” Harry teased, and Draco’s next thrust slammed into his prostate. He arched, mouth opening in a silent cry, and Draco smiled down at him with his teeth.
The halls of Hogwarts were quiet, with hundreds of children gone from all four Houses. Slytherin was quiet, too, but it was a false quiet; the calm before the storm. Draco paid very little attention to the political manoeuvring in his house. He had made it clear to his fellow Slytherins that Pansy had his full support as leader of the rebellion, but he spent the majority of his time in the infirmary, at his mother’s bedside.
“Amenable to Potter’s overtures?” Pansy regarded him seriously. “I’ll give it some thought. You have to understand, though – Potter has an uphill battle ahead of him. Draco is in a perilous situation, and it isn’t just a petty, childish grudge he has against Potter. His father is in Azkaban because of him.”
That terrible thought galvanised Harry into action; he threw himself backwards just as Pickering's teeth grazed his neck.
Draco adjusted his thrusts for the new position, taking Harry’s hips in a bruising grip as he complied with his lover’s demand, making sure he hit Harry’s prostate with each plunge, powering forwards until Harry had to press his hands against the headboard to stop Draco from slamming his head into it.
She hesitated, glancing at Madam Pomfrey again. “I don’t want to lie to you,” she said, slowly. “You deserve better than that. But it’s not good out there. People are saying the power you and Draco have is dangerous.”
Dumbledore was reminded again just how little the boy knew about magic. Growing up in a pureblood household, himself, he often forgot the very simple, basic things that Muggleborns never learnt growing up. It was one of the many factors that had led to his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys, all those years ago, but it never ceased to surprise him still.
. Merlin! You could have a little brother or sister in nine months! Salazar knows we didn’t remember the contraceptives – we’re just lucky we –”
Draco cleared his throat, shifting awkwardly. “Ideally,” he said, voice remarkably steady given the precarious location of Harry’s fingers, “I’d like to read Jeremiah’s book again, but I don’t see a way to get it out of the Manor. At least we have an advantage in that much of our magic seems to respond well to instinctual actions. Still, I’d like to be as prepared as possible.”
, Pansy slipped into the room, with Daphne and Millicent on her heels. Harry’s hopes rose, only to be dashed again when Millicent closed the door behind her. He felt tears prickle at his eyes, and forced them back.
“Wait!” Potter shouted, jumping in front of her. “Stop! He helped us. He told us where to find the kids.”
.” His face was still pale and sickly from the Scorched Earth spell, but there something very dark and sad and satisfied in his gaze. “Call me Remus,” he said.
Robards scowled. “I haven’t forgotten. I also haven’t forgotten that he’s the son of a convicted Death Eater. Lucius attacked
When Professor McGonagall let him go, he found Ron and Hermione waiting for him outside the classroom.
“They won’t detect it, not in this lot,” Draco assured him, examining Harry’s hand closely. Harry wanted to pull away, especially when Draco made a low growl in his throat, and jerked his head up to stare at Harry. “Blood Quill?”
Draco just shushed him again. “I know. But it’s not working. The moment you go into heat, you should be
Snape sneered at him. “When the goings-on in this school become your business, Mr Potter, I will be sure to let you know. Until then, I suggest you keep your nose out of matters that do not concern you. Unless, of course, you would like detention every day for the next year.”
Pansy smiled. “A by-product of the enormous amount of magic you poured into him. He’d just turned seventeen; a wizard’s coming of age. It activated a long-dormant inheritance. It is not uncommon for certain powerful bloodlines to see recurring gifts or abilities, of course, but there were none in the Malfoy or Black lines; not for centuries. Not until now. Draco told me about the prophecy you were given, about the Heir of Slytherin.”
“Ah, okay, that’s something to think about… well we’ll see how it goes.” Thirty-nine pauses and gives them a calculating look. Then, “Can’t hurt for you guys to know a bit, I suppose… Having an ejected soul and still being present in the mortal realm is essentially like a ghost. With the added patronus bit here. Ghosts are ghosts, because they choose to stay while being cut off from their bodies due to the lack of life, if that makes sense. However, Mr. Malfoy here clearly still has life, meaning his patronus is keeping his soul in another sort of shell. We need something else to give his soul a path back out of his patronus and to his body. That’s all.”
And when the fox finally comes to settle down on the couch next to Harry, the air's long been receiving his yawns and his reports have all been sealed and sent on their way. With Draco once again clinging to his shoulder, he stands and gets ready for bed. His routine comes methodically, and he wonders the whole time through what the fox is going to do. Grimmauld can’t be more fun at night than St. Mungo’s, and he’s sure a sleeping Harry or Kreacher wouldn’t provide for much entertainment.
For a month after the trials, the media had kept vicious tabs on the Malfoys, from reporting the sale of the manor as war reparations to every, mundane activity. Criticisms and speculation of what they must be secretly plotting rang through the magical world. Harry remembers that month as one of the most irritating periods of his life. The moment he went anywhere, talks of the savior and whispers of the Malfoys rang in his ears. The din had only continued to grow, and Harry had been furious and agitated. He wanted to crawl out of his skin and tell the world to just shut up, shut up,
“I’m not blaming you!” By this time, Harry’s standing as well, their cups of tea forgotten on the table.
But the next chapters will actually clear the air beetween Harry and Draco and I'm excited to get all the baggage out of the way ^-^
“I—I’m sorry,” he says quickly. “Hermione told me I had to get your permission and everything but you were
Imaginary-Harry gives Draco’s hair a last ruffle and sighs. “Go to sleep, Draco. You don’t know what’ll happen when Baker comes back. Get some rest.”
“Does me doing my own thing upset you?” Malfoy looks him straight in the eyes this time, his glare holding Harry in place. “Is it so wrong for me to do what I wish?”
have a problem because how is he supposed to get food in an empty house that requires constant supervision?
Harry shrugs. “Luna’s friends with you. Thought she’d know where you are after I couldn’t find you in the hospital.” He tosses in another mumble at the end for good measure, “—fucking receptionist.”
He quiets down now, looking at this notebook. At the notebook that wasn’t quite what he was expecting, but gave him that piece of Malfoy anyways. In fact, it’s better. Because this is a part of Malfoy that’s more subtle. A part that Malfoy himself wouldn’t ever write down. It’s the perfection, the want, the lack, the shattered dream—it’s everything put into the quill that wrote these words, drew these diagrams. It’s the wish for a home, built and fixed, and Harry suddenly feels the desperate need to be a part of it.
Then he grabs his own paper and does the same, only, taking his time with this one because there’s nothing else in the room he can destroy. So he tears it ever so slowly, focusing on the ripping sounds, and when enough time has passed for him to stop shaking at least, he walks to the window and watches the pieces fall from his fingers.
In all honesty, Harry doesn’t get it. Doesn’t think he ever will because he’s not the one stripped down to a bare soul. He has his inner monologue, his “physical” thoughts and emotions, and he can put words to everything he thinks and does. He
His ears ring. It’s loud, but quiets soon enough, and it’s only when he’s starting to wonder if they’re being attacked that he hears the loud peals of laughter. He crawls back in front of the fireplace. Then gives an internal sigh of relief even as he glares at the faces.
Malfoy appears a few times throughout the afternoon; usually after something Harry’s said, so he figures Malfoy
He’s scared. He’s so scared. If he’s going to die, he always wanted someone with him at least. He doesn’t want to be alone. He doesn’t want to go anywhere alone. He doesn’t want to die. He
The fox lights up and starts sprinting excited circles around Harry. Harry laughs and remembers the alphabet paper. He sets it down on the table.
And when Harry opens his eyes, there’s a familiar form barreling recklessly through furniture, showers of mist flowing in its wake.
Harry spends the next few days throwing himself into auror missions and spending a record amount of time at Hermione and Ron’s place. It’s to the point where his friends simply offer him their guest room, which he takes gratefully. Harry knows they want to question him, ask if he’s ok, but they know by now to give Harry time to gather his thoughts and categorize where exactly everything stands in his life at the moment.
Draco gives a hum. “Probably. Smart of him not to give away his full name or year though. Just in case I escape and give him away.”
He’s excited, yes. If—and that’s the thing—if, this works, he’ll have Draco back in his body, and Harry will finally be able to give the man a hug. He wants to hold those fingers in his and ruffle that hair and bury his face in it and just breathe Draco in. He wants Draco. Solid and real and
There’s nothing to do except sit, so he does and lets his thoughts wander, desperately keeping them away from the possibility of death. He wonders how Luna must be doing. Luna, Luna, Luna. Luna, who had been caged in the Malfoy dungeons for months. Luna, who held no grudge but had indulged his request for forgiveness anyways. Luna who stayed with him and comforted him and offered to share her home even when his burned. Luna who only ever gave him the one request to keep her plants and home safe. One request and he couldn’t complete it.
Thirty-nine shrugs and starts leading them towards the stairs. “We’ve been trying to improve the lighting among other things.”
When Luna comes back and sees Harry about to leave, she waves a hand casually. “Oh no, I’m just going out on a quick errand. Would you like to come?”
It’s going to be okay? Nice Harry thinks it’s going to be okay for Draco to die? But no, this Harry is smiling and glaring and Draco doesn’t know which Harry it is anymore. Maybe both want him to die.
Ron waits, letting his words sink in and the shaking subside. When it does, Harry gives him an incredulous look. “Who the heck is willing to walk through an entire village house by house?”
Draco jabs out, and Harry only barely follows the movements with how furiously quick Draco’s pointing out the letters.
And Harry only looks helplessly at her as he feels his hands and feet start to jitter under the table. Ron quickly grabs his hand and gives a reaffirming squeeze.
But even so, his friends run around and smile at him and maybe he could be young again too, some day. He smiles back.
Draco turns his face away back into the ground. He’ll take what he gets. He knows this isn’t real. He knows it’s better than nothing. And yet even his imaginary mother won’t address his being gay and raped. He supposes it’s because the knowledge of his real mother is still leaking into his wishful imagination. If anything, why can’t this be perfect? It’s not.
He closes his eyes and pretends Harry’s beside him, laughing and leaning against his shoulder. And as this Harry comforts him and strokes his hair, Draco slowly calms down to sniffles and hiccups.
“I heard them talking about Malfoy earlier when you guys were passing by!” He gestures at the assembled Aurors and Unspeakables. “Don’t lie to me. I want to know what’s going on. I asked around earlier and literally
He pauses when he realizes he’s rambling, and sneaks another look at Draco. He stills, and though he’s not sure where he’s gone wrong, regret floods him anyway.
s and “I’m fine.” Because he can’t tell Draco when Draco himself doesn’t seem to be aware of what’s happening. So he worries and wallows alone.
The person doesn’t speak. Simply waves their wand and frees Draco from his chair. The moment he’s staggering to his feet, there are shackles connecting his hands and feet together. So he can’t run away after all. Then there’s another pop as a small tray of food appears on the ground. The person turns and leaves without a word.
But even with how desperate he is, Harry sits back for once and lets Draco steer their conversations. Perhaps his guilt plays a role, but he understands the fragility between them now. And he won’t be the one to ruin it. So he listens and watches as Draco painstakingly points out his letters.
of the world and the freedom Malfoy never had and may never get to have again. He cries with regret that he couldn’t have understood sooner, and he mostly cries for himself. He’s confused and muddled, and while he now understands the frustration, the anger, he can’t understand the calm, the escape, and peace with crystal skies and seas of green.
And even as his fingers graze the tips of Draco’s ears, the collection of mist swirls and disintegrates. The ears flick. The fox refuses to stir. And Harry sleeps.
“Yes, precisely. And being blunt, we’re getting quite desperate. It’s been almost a month since we found out, and we’ve run out of leads. If Malfoy knows anything, we really hope you’d speak now.”
But under that late morning sun, Harry swears he sees something like two speckled ears that are decidedly un-fox-like flicking on top of the cloud.
The door swings open almost immediately after Harry knocks, and at the sight of blonde hair, he splutters his grievances out.
HIIIIII so I sped through this chapter because I was feeling motivated from people's comments (thank u love u guys)
“Um...” Harry searches for words while Luna looks around at the piles of wood and stone and shingles that sit all over the yard and roof.
“Yes you are. As someone who witnessed your sixth year at school, I believe I can firmly say it’s the same thing all over again! Plus, this
The normally-calm and smiley man buries his face in his hands. It unsettles Harry a bit. That can’t be good. Meanwhile, Robards scribbles away.
Malfoy is openly glaring now, his arms crossed across his chest. “And why is this my problem? Why should I have to do it? I’m perfectly fine where I am, Potter. I don’t see the world flipping out over it.”
But he’s also scared. Because being with Draco has become so natural now. For merlin’s sake, he’s spent practically the entirety of the past month with him. From morning to evening, and more recently, from dawn to dawn and dusk to dusk. He doesn’t know when it started. Doesn’t know and doesn’t care to know. He simply wants
It doesn’t ring a bell, but Draco stays silent anyways, making sure his face is as blank as he can possibly make it.
Once, he imagines Harry sitting across from him. Harry, with his green eyes glaring at him behind glasses and messy hair. Hair he wishes he could comb his hand through, just for the sake of it. But no, this image of Harry he imagines is mad at him, and it’s the last memory of him he has. That fuming expression when Draco had tried to tell him he’d tried. He’d tried so hard.
And now, he’s back to pouring over Malfoy’s diagrams, following the instructions as he slowly gets the boards and tiles down by hand. It’s a slow and tiring process, but there’s satisfaction in feeling his hands physically create something. He thinks he could get used to this feeling.
He walks around the bed, staring over every inch of the still body lying in it as if he can will the fox out. He looks under the bed then, under the chairs, behind the plants, out the window, and still, there is no fox.
Harry ponders that. Draco doesn't have a mind? If he doesn't have a mind, how is he thinking? How is he communicating like this with Harry? How is he still very much, well, in his mind? Besides that, he's sure he's seen Draco dozing plenty of times on his bed or on top of his own chest.
control over before, and it’s infuriating. Unspoken boundaries had been crossed, disrespected. And Harry hadn’t even understood.
So he stands up abruptly, his chair scraping back with a harsh screech. Both Luna and Draco look up at him with varying levels of alarm.
When no one answers, Robards turns back to Harry. “As you know, Mr. Malfoy was abducted about a week ago in Grasmere. Luna Lovegood reported him missing when she did not find him upon her return from Brazil. We intended to keep the entire thing quiet for now due to… public misconceptions. However, Rita Skeeter found out anyways, hence that article.” Everyone grimaces. Nobody at the Ministry was a fan of Skeeter. It was a miracle she was still employed even with all the complaints.
Harry gives a startled shout and cracks his head on the wall in his effort to scoot away from whatever it is. As the bit of smoke clears, he sees Luna, awake now and backed into the opposite wall. The doe hasn’t moved.
But then again, it’s not like he can just tell Draco to turn back into the fox he’s come to know and love. So he lies on his side and watches the doe try to twist its neck to look back at itself in between the periods of darkness that means he’s succumbed to sleep.
. How there’s always some deadline to be met, someone who needs to be saved, people to talk to, chores to be done. But right now, right now he doesn’t need to worry about anything. In this one second of
Luna pulls out a few homemade dishes that thankfully look pretty normal, and Harry immediately swipes a cookie and stuffs it into his mouth. “Ifs preffy ‘ood,” he says around his mouthful.
But I cannot guarantee quality over time—because I rushed, I'm not too confident in this chapter I suppose.
He sticks out a hand towards Malfoy, even though he knows there will be no hand-shaking today. “Hello, I’m Harry. Harry Potter. And you are?”
Except where Malfoy should be is some old wizard who looks like he’s on the verge of death. And Harry balks. He
. He apologizes and apologizes until his voice is hoarse and scratchy and the tears have drenched his sleeves.
No. No no no nonono. He will keep it under control. But there are people out there that need help. The world still needs help. And here he is, doing nothing but pacing. But he can’t stop pacing. If only the world would stop spinning for just one goddamn second. Then the neverending stream of problems would stop. There would be peace. And Harry would live within that one second forever. If only all these fucking criminals would—
“Unfortunately, we were not able to locate their headquarters. It seems the manor was simply a prison of sorts.”
And thankfully Luna appears beside Malfoy right then, because Harry really doesn’t know how to reply to that.
When the healers arrive, Harry decidedly sits still, not trusting himself to do anything rash. He lets Victor take the lead, telling the healers what they’ve found and watching as they bundle Malfoy up and apparate away. And Harry can’t help but think that if they make it through this, perhaps he’ll take up Luna’s offer—“Start over, Harry. You can start over. And this time, you’ll find the ground solid beneath you.”
“Fuck, fine be that way prick.” The man walks over and kicks his chair so that it skids back with a screech. Draco winces at the sound.
Harry starts, as if he had been walking in a daze all day and feeling as if he's just woken. He looks at Luna. Then at the cookies. It’s glowing. Everything’s glowing. And Harry wonders if he, standing here under all this warm light in Malfoy’s home, is also glowing.
Fuming, Harry stands there for a moment. It isn’t like he doesn’t want a break—by the gods, he wants one so badly. But how can he? How can he when memories from the war try to haunt him every day? How can he when the world refuses to reach that peace everyone had promised when Voldemort fell? How can he be at peace if the world isn’t at peace?
The Dementor glides forward and reaches out a hand towards him. Draco backs into a corner and he’s shaking so hard he collapses to his knees. Tears are sliding down his face and he shuts his eyes.
It’s golden hour now, and the streets are pleasantly quiet, with the occasional talk and laughter carried over on the wind. “It must be quite loud in London right now, especially during rush hour,” Luna muses.
Harry feels like he’s drifting. Drifting aimlessly and floating on clouds. Except it’s really not as nice as it sounds, because he’s also lost. There’s a void in his chest he doesn’t know how to fill and nothing he thinks of feels right. He needs to be grounded, he knows. But he’s known that for the past twenty-one years of his life and nothing has changed, so why would it be any different now?
there’s no more water coming in. He stares at his water barrier in panicked satisfaction for a while before looking back at the room.
So instead, they chatter away about work and quidditch at dinner, and Harry is happy to let them distract him with talk of things that don’t matter. It’s relaxing and carefree, he thinks, to have his friends with him and dabble in topics that would make them seem quite shallow otherwise.
“It’s okay, I’ll take you there some time,” he says back to the doe. And then he says to his other friends, “Draco wanted to see the moat and booby traps.”
Everyone gathers around Robards enlarged table, and Harry takes a look around, noting the four Aurors and the three Unspeakables present. He doesn’t recognize any of the aurors, and why there are Unspeakables, he has no clue. He’s never seen them take part in a case before, and to say that they are now can't mean anything good.
Harry almost forgets to write his reports until Thirty-nine firecalls him one evening at Grimmauld a week later. Apologies spilling from his mouth, he updates the man, describing the fading, the bursts of mist, and Malfoy’s relative silence. Malfoy hasn’t said anything pertaining to the case, and Harry’s not about to push it. He tells Thirty-nine as much, and the latter nods, agreeing. But he reminds Harry anyways, that while the data the Unspeakables seek is not as urgent, it’s a different case with the resistance.
“So um, I want to know what’s going on.” He phrases it like a question. When no one says anything, he continues cautiously. “Why is this a top-secret case, and what happened to Malfoy? Ron and Hermione told me he’s being isolated at St. Mungos?”
Thanking whatever gods again for giving him such a chill partner—who never riles him up, he might add—Harry snaps himself back to attention and surveys the scene. He senses no lingering magic in the air, meaning no lasting curses or perpetrators; they would have to capture them later. As for the actual damage…
“Hey, hey, we’re perfectly fine though. Just a bit of minor damage. Why anyone would attack a joke shop is beyond me. Must be a bunch of idiots.”
, and he imagines himself as Draco. He runs through their Hogwarts years. He looks at Hogwarts, their school, their home, and he sees himself put proudly in Slytherin, making friends, and making childish jabs at Harry, Hermione, and Ron. He sees the pranks, the hexes, the name-calling, and he does them all.
. All of him. The bright bits and the dark bits and all the colors in between, visible or invisible.
A cold tingle passes through his arm, and he looks up to see Draco sitting back on his hind legs, a paw raised in the air as if to swipe at Harry.
He’s gone back to Grimmauld place after the “Malfoy Incident,” as they come to call it, and he’s drowning again in the silence and gloom. But he hadn’t wished to overstay his welcome at Ron and Hermione’s so he had forced himself to say his goodbyes and leave.
They give each other a quick wave, and Thirty-nine darts out the door. Harry turns back slowly, listening to the quiet breathing and watching the rise and fall of Malfoy’s chest. With the fox gone, Malfoy looks as if he could just be sleeping. Harry entertains that for a while. Malfoy looks peaceful sleeping; if not tired. But he looks younger and older at the same time, and it’s like he’s timeless. Time freezes around them, and Harry can only sit.
Time is even more nonexistence in this place. His meals are more irregular, and the only thing that’s constant is the cold and suffocating feeling of his mind. The cold is unpleasant but not unbearable. But the dread, the fear, and the pain make him want to claw at his brain, to tell the neurons to stop firing, to just disconnect him from the world.
Eventually, Kreacher gets annoyed of his ceaseless pacing and shoves him out of the house with a box of homemade pies. “Master is being in the way of cleaning. Kreacher is asking Master to do his walking somewhere else.” The door slams in his face, and Harry knows this is Kreacher’s way of saying “You’re being annoying. Fuck off and go solve your problems already.”
When he opens his eyes again, the room is bathed in golds and greys and a darkening purple. He sits up slowly, groaning and trying to shrug the stiffness out of his neck and shoulders. Malfoy’s body still looks the same, suffering and painful but less pale than before. Or maybe that’s just the lighting. And he looks soft. So soft.
Then just as Harry’s starting to think he’ll go mad, a silver mist floats out of Malfoy’s chest. It swirls around before slowly condensing into a fox. A red fox? An arctic fox? Harry doesn’t know the particulars, but it’s a rather small fox and really fluffy-looking, and if he hadn't known it was Malfoy, he would be tempted to grab it and cuddle with it.
Harry thinks it’s not so much Draco’s voice he’s hearing than his… thoughts. There is no actual voice to his words, and it’s only after much contemplation that he realizes what he actually hears is the whirlwind of concepts—and, pictures, for lack of a better word. But because he’s confined to this mind and this body, his brain automatically puts words to things he otherwise would not be able to comprehend.
No, focus. Step one, survey the damage. He rushes forward, dropping heavily to his knees besides the person. Now, look for injuries and check for a pulse and—
It’s just not enough. It’s not fast enough. He needs to be in control. He needs other people to take him seriously. For
So under the vast sky with stars he’s never seen before, in this town at the edge of the world, he doesn’t feel lonely at all.
Even through the haze, Harry senses the gravity of the situation. He’s never seen Luna this serious before, and despite not quite understanding what she’s getting at, he knows he ought to be careful. So he nods and gives her what he hopes is a reassuring smile.
Malfoy pauses, his mouth open with unsaid words before he had been cut off. Harry takes the moment to take in Malfoy’s appearance. Jeans, another oversized hoodie, and his disheveled hair gave indication to having just been woken up, if his sleepy gaze didn’t say anything.
The sky goes from a yellow-orange to a pale purple and still, he sits. He sits until it’s dark and he can see the sporadic lights from the other houses illuminate the small patch of land that Grasmere occupies. And beyond that, it’s dark. It’s dark and black and it’s as if a void simply exists in the space between the horizon and the sky. It’s different from London. So different. London is like a galaxy of stars and comets, going as far as the eye could see. A city that never sleeps.
“Okay okay hold up,” Robards raises his hands then faceplants into them. “First of all, you weren’t here yet when the notice came in, so I gave it to the first group available. Second of all, you know this sort of thing is more for the detectives. And as an auror, you’re very… rash, impulsive, and
Then with the slightest bit of guilt, Harry rushes after the group, leaving Victor to deal with the write-up. He’ll have to buy the boy a drink some time.
Harry shrugged. “I get that, sir. I’ve made mistakes. Stupid mistakes that could cost us the war, even. All we can really do is to admit that they were mistakes, and apologise, and try to make amends. Anything else, and you could wake up one day to find yourself doing a whole lot more harm than good.”
Draco snorted. He began stripping as soon as his door was closed behind them, working the delicate clasps to his robes with an ease of dexterity that Harry envied. “You really are the oddest mix of Gryffindor and Slytherin,” he said, and Harry’s eyes snapped back up to his face guiltily. Draco smirked. He let his robes fall carelessly to the floor, and then took his time pulling on a pair of positively indecent pyjama bottoms. “Woven of the finest silk spun by Golden Orb spiders in Africa,” he said, offhandedly – but with justifiable pride, Harry thought, hoping he didn’t look as stunned as he felt. The pyjamas hung low on Draco’s hips, revealing just a hint of that fine dusting of blond hair that led in a triangle downwards, clinging to his legs like a second skin, showing off every lean curve of muscle, every… bulge.
