Now what? The two people are still wrapped in Harry’s magic - his magic, now - and he can either sink it into their skin to make them alive, or he could experiment, play a little. There’s not enough magic for both.
To put it simply, Harry is confused. When he’d agreed to join Hermione for another year at Hogwarts, to give him time to decide what he really wants to do, he’d never considered the possibility that the ferret would return too. Why should he have? Malfoy had done so much to disgrace himself that the chance he would come back should be non-existent. Facing problems head on to apologise is never the Malfoy way; Harry has plenty of experience with that. So why? Why is he sat there with his pointy little face shoved into the Slytherin table?
“Thanks for the tea.” Harry mutters, then curses himself for saying such a stupid thing. “I’ll… I’m going to tell McGonagall what I did. Thank you for helping me in the forest. You’re… you’re a decent guy, Nott.”
“Pansy…” Hermione sighs, wishing she had hands to reassure the girl with. “It isn’t anything like that. Draco’s just… He doesn’t want you to worry about him.”
Harry rolls his eyes, standing. “Ok, I’ll see what I can do.” His hand goes into his pocket, fingers dancing over the singed letter inside.
“We- we’ve overc-c-come challenges no oth-other year group-ps have ever had to d-d...do.” Draco repeats, cringing as his stuttering voice amplifies to the crowd.
He steels himself, closing his eyes.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Harry, heart pumping, rips out his wand from his pocket and throws a spell, any spell, at them. In the end, it doesn’t even come out as a spell, just a raw wave of magic that throws the four away from the one in the centre. They yelp, crunching against walls and skidding across floors as Harry rushes forward.
Which has been your favourite chapter (if you can't remember exactly, just describe your favourite scene.) and why?
“I apologise. Truce?”
“I only said that they shouldn’t be most annoyed by the rooms…” Ron grumbles.
“How long did it take you to wake up?”
“That’s it! Keep going! Keep pulling!” Theo encourages behind him, voice breathless.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Longbottom, Neville
Two questions for you:
“I’m hoping for a new one. Imagine if he was left with… that.” Harry gestures at his forearm, grimacing. The image still haunts him whenever he closes his eyes, but the hope that Draco can come back stops him from panicking. He isn’t dead, not really.
Hermione’s forehead wrinkles as she leans on one arm. “Ron, you shouldn’t get so angry at them. I’m sure they’re just trying to survive this year without fighting, like us.”
Harry’s heart sinks. Lost his wife, so now he’s trying to regain his friend? It’s impossible. Sirius is dead. Harry has to - no, Remus, Remus has to accept that.
The silence is deafening, everyone expecting him to declare his intentions. His silver eyes flick over each person's face, trying to gauge their reactions, until he decides against heading to Pansy. That would take him past Buck-Teeth and towards the weasel, and judging by the hard lines around her mouth every time Pansy’s wand nears the weasel, the Muggle spawn would cast an incredibly nasty hex. No, not that way.
There’s no response. Pansy huffs, worry bubbling into irritation in her stomach. Draco had hid in his room for two whole days now, refusing to answer anyone coming to the door. When she’d asked Theo about it, he’d given a noncommittal shrug and said they’d broken up, then wandered off with that dumb flat look of his. She’s starting to regret ever letting him join them on the train.
Question time!
“Three.”
Ron stares after her, bread still in his hand. "Why would I hit someone?" He questions Hermione, baffled.
“What’s wrong?” Hermione whispers, a crease in her forehead.
He opens his eyes, squinting out at the blurry world, but the light is too bright and burns him. “Saint Potter.” he mumbles, then falls with relief into the darkness.
Ginny and Theo burst into laughter, making Neville sink into his hoodie further, face beetroot red. Harry can feel his own face heating up, but tries to laugh it off too.
“Well, not exactly our last hope, but clo-”
He drops his quill, smirking up at her. “Whatever it is, Pans, the answer is no.”
“She says she doesn’t want to see you. I would tell you where she is, but she doesn’t like to be interrupted when she’s sending her letters from the owlery.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“On the contrary, the program you are part of is to prevent ideas of blood purity lasting into your adulthood.”
Ideas or questions or anything else you want to talk to me about, please do! My door is metaphorically always open. It can't be physically, however, because that would be both creepy since you'd know where I lived, and against the government restrictions.
With that said, enjoy!
“Blaise! Do it!”
“Or they could be looking for a reason to lock him up.” Hermione adds. “People will be angry that they put dementors near their children for an entire year to stop a criminal who, as it turns out, isn’t actually a criminal. There was widespread panic when he escaped Azkaban, and finding out it was all for nothing - most people won’t be impressed. If they lock him up now, they can say they were right all along.”
- E.D.
Enjoy!
Harry blinks at her in confusion for a few seconds. Then his face lights up and he pats himself down, eventually pulling the wand, Draco’s precious old wand, out of a pocket. “I forgot about this! I was going to give it to you when I found it, but… it must have slipped my mind at some point. Here.” Potter sticks it out towards him with a grin.
“Sorry. I wasn’t thinking.”
Of course Malfoy wasn’t going to apologise and fall in love again with Harry. His crucio didn’t work, and Harry’s veritaserum did. Harry was just doing too much wishful thinking. Although… Malfoy’s crying in front of him, right now, so maybe Malfoy isn’t the one who’s supposed to apologise.
Tug. Tug. Tug. Draco shakes his head, trying to step back and pull against the force. Is this one of those gods the muggles are obsessed with? Were they right all along?
“Branch. Never mind that, what did you find?”
Cream, cream, cold cream… and strawberry. There! He grabs the faint trace of magic, Draco’s magic, and tugs.
Trelawney? No. Yes, Trelawney is a seer, and Pansy adores her flair for the dramatics, but everyone knows she has almost no skill at all. Besides, Pansy doesn’t want to know about the future, she wants to know the present.
WARNING: MORE GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION -- If you would rather not read this, ignore all text in brackets. It isn't really important, it's just Harry remembering what had happened, so you won't miss anything by not reading it.
Harry flicks to the next page, only half concentrating on the words now. This is the best thing for Draco. Something that is guaranteed to make him happy, for longer than one night.
d) Change the story so both Gakushuu and Draco are the main characters (this may make it longer)
Wait...how did Luna know? She doesn’t exactly listen to what other people say, never mind hear about it before Ginny.
Woah, no! Another ball of paper flies over his shoulder. He doesn’t want his mother to worry about him too much.
If anyone has any requests for things to happen in future chapters, please tell me!
There are a few moments of tense silence where Gobsy pours out two cups, handing them to their respective owners.
It’s the Pansy girl, Draco’s friend. “Hello Pansy.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry grins at McGonagall, who returns a stiff yet affectionate smile. The four of them, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and himself, settle on a bench together. It seems that only three or four eighth years have returned from each house, all from a single friend group.
“There’s a hole in the wall.” The weasel finishes off elegantly.
“Well, as long as she’s happy with Blaise, right? Plenty of other fish in the sea for me.” Hermione puts a smile on her face, clipboard out again. “She’s just so irritatingly attractive. Anyway, I’ve got donations to collect. See you!”
The portraits twitter around him as he sets off into a sprint, abandoning his bag with Luna. It’s only when he’s halfway there that he starts to question her blind panic, wondering if this is actually just an elaborate prank. Real danger, or prank? How can he tell? Either he goes there and risks falling into a prank, or he doesn’t go there and risks someone getting hurt. Without realising it, he’s slowed his pace, doubts falling thick and heavy.
The world twists around him, knotting his stomach, and then it’s all noise and lights and movement and people, so many people chatting and laughing and pushing past him that he can’t breathe, it’s all too much-
They make their way through the common room, passing Neville’s many boxes of house plants, and through the hallways of the castle. It’s eerily quiet, without the younger years chasing each other about. Harry misses the noise. Soon, however, the chatter of voices reach them as they approach the Great Hall.
Harry stalls, dropping his head and letting shame push down the frustration. “Sorry. Is it going well?”
“You two!” Hermione sighs in exasperation. “You’d think we’re a gaggle of first years. Draco, put down the paintbrush and cast a drying spell. Pansy, tell me how on earth I’m supposed to fix this.”
His heartbeat slows, calm replacing the rushing flood. He’s fine. Breathing out a sigh, he turns to the problem of his creased robes. The cloak itself seems redeemable, thanks to the fabric, but his trousers and shirt are ruined. It’s bad enough being who he is, without looking like he slept in his uniform.
Pansy: >>:(((
Question time!
With this, he could tear them apart. He could separate their atoms, one by one, and put them back together again. He’s almost tempted, until he feels the natural reversal of the spell call over something dark and twisted that winds itself around Draco’s arm, ready to complete the undoing of the spell fully.
Harry hates the feeling. He wants the casual joke, like with Ron, where nothing will ever annoy, not anymore, because they can laugh it off far too easily. He wants the gentle smile, like with Hermione, where they can talk about anything and everything, and the other will know exactly what to say. He even wants the awkward shrug, like with Ginny, where they know every shade of hate and love, so fall into the on-off structure. At least then he would know that no matter what he does, at some point he will be accepted again.
Personal note: My sister is improving, now she's at home with her family and old friends. She's defintely less under stress, and thinking about different ways open to her, which has helped get her out of her trapped mindset. Your concern about her and me is really sweet, and I appreciate it so much, especially when you don't have any obligation to help me.
My sister has depression. The place she's at has sent her home to us so she can get better in a calm, familiar environment, and this means that I have to be there to look after her when my parents are busy.
“Well, since Jaebo be alive, sir, Master Draco must be a moving painter maker!” Jaebo smiles, throwing his tiny arms in the air and doing a little jig. “Jaebo be Master Draco’s first moving painting! Jaebo feels so happy!”
“Anyway.” Theodore shakes his head. “Vizzini was famous for creating grand spells that always went wrong if the slightest thing happened. Usually, a mispronounced word makes a spell puff out some smoke or not work at all. In Vizzini’s spells, a mispronounced word could send a building crumbling on top of the caster. You see how specific every part of this spell was? Some think she loved to be the only one who could cast her spells.”
The spell! He’d given the book to Theo that morning, before heading off to the Manor. How had he found something already?
“H-harry?!” One of them, Harry is too furious to recognise faces, stands. “But- but- they broke the points jar! And they-”
- E.D.
For him? This is all because Harry doesn’t want to hurt him? Draco shakes his head, guilt burning in his stomach, hoping to get through that he doesn’t want Harry to give up magic because of him.
She couldn’t help herself. She can suffer through everything they do with a smile, but she will be damned if she’s going to keep her mouth shut. They murdered her husband, and let hate spread so far her son was killed in the mess. Slipping in a few bitter remarks is all she can do about it.
“Finish the spell, please.”
His forearm is pale marble, a long jagged scar searing down where the black mass used to be. Draco stares at it, lifting his fingers of his other hand to trace down the strange line. They told him what had happened, with uncomfortable glances away from his arm. He doesn’t blame them. When the flashbacks came, he almost threw up.
He can’t help himself.
He can’t let her slip away too.
He’s breathless when Harry (who kissed him, he kissed him because he likes Draco too, and he isn’t alone) pulls back, adrenaline ripping through his veins and leaving him weak in the knees, clutching Harry (Harry Harry Harry) like he’s the only person there.
“Isn’t Draco better for that?” Blaise whines, glancing wistfully towards the circle.
Fred’s absence was like a gaping wound. George was so much quieter, and didn’t pull one single prank throughout the whole meal. A sheet was thrown over the clock at some point, thanks to Draco’s constant glances towards it. No one sat in Fred’s chair, even though there was barely any space for the large number of people. Draco couldn’t help but feel guilty, a lump in his throat that wouldn’t go away when he swallowed.
-- FOR THOSE WHO WOULDN'T LIKE TO READ THE OTHER SECTION --
Draco tilts his head. ‘No, it’s not. You’re going about it the wrong way.’
Pansy is going to hex that psycho to oblivion.
He shakes his head, picking up the slice of plain bread and biting into it. The taste is identical to sawdust as he chews far longer than he should, struggling to swallow. Three mouthfuls later, and he sets it down, stomach roiling violently. Goyle would have eaten the entire thing in two bites. Crabbe would have eaten it in one, just to show he was better. He shoves his plate away, guilt adding to his queasiness.
He can’t die. He can’t die, he can’t die, he can’t! His breath hitches, body desperately kicking and pulling away from his death. He can see someone in there, multiple people, milky faces staring through and waiting for him to join them.
“What? Remove the stick up Zabini’s arse?”
“Are you sure?” Harry glances between the staircase and Draco. “I don’t want to force you up there.”
“I’d like- I’d have l-liked to stand h-here today with m-m-my head-d held high, decl-claring that I’ve d-done the b-b-best I could h-have.”
Pansy’s arm snakes around his, and he lets her lead him into the castle, away from the source of his aggravation. The castle is too bright and warm for the dreadful weather, presumably enchanted to make the students feel more welcome. By tomorrow, the corridors will be just as grey and sodden as the outside world. Chattering students skim around the edge of their bubble of Death-Eater-ness, heading to the Great Hall.
Forcing his hands not to tremble, he gradually lifts them in a placating gesture above his head. Don't hex me. Merlin, don't you dare hex me. Thankfully, no spell is cast, and they allow him to stand. Even if they don't lower their wands.
“It’s cruel, really. I became his godfather, promised to take care of him if Lily and James died, and then I only ended up knowing him for little more than two years.” Black sighs, oblivious to Draco’s growing anger. “I wish things could have been different. I wish James and Lily were still alive.”
“Trust me, the heeled boots are the least extravagant things in my designs.” Blaise chuckles.
Isn’t thinking straight?! This is the most he’s thought since year fucking six, where he was branded with the dark Mark! Finally, he’s doing something good, and now this stupid man is stopping him!
I- no, I can’t- It’s too loud! Stop it!
Harry, one. Neville, two. Ron, three.
In, out. In, out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fuck.
“But I thought it didn’t have any healing properties.” Neville is saying as he approaches, frowning at Luna.
“And I’m your last hope for saving Draco?”
Anger boils hot in his stomach, creating a twitch in his jaw. It’s almost a habit now, after seven years of it, to grow furious at any mention of his father, despite the fact that he agrees with the weasel. No! Not agrees. He would never agree with him. The confused swirl of emotions he is incredibly unprepared for make him turn rapidly, marching off swiftly before… before something bad happens.
“Of course. Down the corridor and to the left, Gobsy will show you-”
- E.D.
His back slides against the wall as he sinks to the floor, aware but uncaring of the number of germs that must be rubbing off on his clothes. If his mother was here she would be appalled. If his father was here… if his father was here he wouldn’t have done it in the first place. But he isn’t, so he can, and why is that man even in his head anyway? He’s gone. Buggered off to waste away in Azkaban.
Potter winces. That’s it.
“You could tell him you like him back.” Luna suggests. “I’m pretty sure he’s straight, even though he did kiss Draco once.”
“What do you want me to do?” Blaise interrupts with a fond smile.
“Right.” Harry bites his lip, finger tapping rapidly against his leg. Nerves. Blaise supposes even the Saviour of the Wizarding World gets nervous. At least Blaise is keeping up a calm front, chin tilted up and waves of arrogance flowing from him. Arrogance gets the job done. Nerves don’t.
The two groups split once more, eyeing each other suspiciously as they sit in their previous places. Harry collapses into an armchair, still puzzling over why Malfoy hadn’t spoken.
He shakes his head, clutching the blankets around himself tighter. ‘Not there.’
Draco nods, motioning for him to go on. He’s not willing to risk getting worked up if his smoke words still aren’t working.
Oh, this. The snake in the common room had told Sir Pedlington, who had translated it to Aryana Griffith, who had whispered it to Red Hawk, who mentioned it to Luna as he was chasing Light Breath. Luna likes Light Breath more than Red Hawk, but she would never tell him, or he would stop telling her what he hears. It’s interesting. Especially when he tells her what Grendel Rouge, an expert in love, sees.
Enjoy!
“So, you’re saying they would want to be free if they knew they’d be in a job?”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
As soon as he’s left, Draco rubs his eyes wearily. Far too much is happening today for his liking. All he wants is to be back in his room in the Manor, curl under the covers, and sleep until it all goes away. Heaving himself to his feet once more, he grabs his robes from his trunk and steps out into the corridor.
“Are they sure?” He whispers, hope soaring in his chest. “Can they… can they get him back?”
- E.D.
So I've seen some writers do this thing where they can put the name of another work in their notes, and you can click on it and it will send you through to that work. This would be incredibly helpful in my recommendations, so if anyone knows how it's done, please tell me! Thanks!
...so therefore, Kingsley Shacklebolt is under the charm of a veela. It’s so clear to Luna. The wall against her back is cold, seeping through her shirt. Perhaps she should stand, walk around a little, chat to Madame Flowerbury on the wall next to the Charms classroom. Or maybe not, considering Flowerbury is so full of nargles these days.
How could he have been so blind? The silence, the malnourishment, the bruises under his eyes. Harry reads over the letter again, mind frozen in shock. He hadn’t known. It wasn’t Harry’s fault, right? If Malfoy had fallen, it wouldn’t have been Harry’s fault. It couldn’t. Harry was busy saving the entire wizarding world.
Even so, here's the new chapter. It'll be a little slow at the beginning, it's just cause I've skipped over a month of time and the situation needs to be explained. For the drarry shippers reading this, I swear they'll actually interact again soon! I just needed Theo and Draco together so that he improves a little, and now that he has, I can start working on the drarry.
“Sorry?!”
Pansy sighs. “You really want to bring him down here? Into a noisy, crowded room with drunk people?”
No. No, no, no - he can feel it like an amputated arm, the power shrinking away from him and back to the source. Desperately, he reaches his own weak power after it, but it slips through his grasp and then-
But it was war. It was a time where even the best of people could do the worst things. His father is by no means a good man, but the echoes of Draco’s childhood can’t let him suffer alone. The admiration and awe he’d held for his father, the years of clawing for a scrap of love from the man, it hasn’t just disappeared. Hearing these words, even when they’re falling out in a blubbering mess, it fills a hole in Draco’s heart that he didn’t even know he had.
Enjoy!
Back to my question at the top:
“Oh, Harry, don’t let this become like sixth year…” Hermione sighs, forehead creasing in worry. She’s been doing that a lot lately.
“I love you.” Harry whispers against his ear, sending goosebumps down his spine.
First question:
McGonagall's voice snaps him from his rage. “Whilst you are studying seventh year material, you will not be in seventh year classes. This year will mostly be independent study, with lessons spread out through the week, where the professor will take you through the material and leave you work to do in your own time. Some may invite you to join a certain seventh year class, but be warned, this is likely a sign you are falling behind.”
“Harry! I feared you would have already gone to bed.”
“I heard that the Hogwarts house elves are increasing in number. All the purebloods having to let them go, y’know?” Pansy interrupts the quiet one afternoon, picking at the edge of her skirt.
If you haven't read the notes at the top, please quickly go through them.
The grinning. The smug sniggering every time one of those words floated past, turning another Gryffindor red. He’d seen this coming for a while, just didn’t want to admit it. Theo’s mask doesn’t mean he’s calm. It means he’s planning how to get revenge later.
I would be a Fwooper, although I wouldn't like to be kept as a pet with a silencing charm over me. What's the point of having a twitter that makes people insane if you can't use it?
As for the recommendation of the week, I've gone with... the series 'Comes and Goes (In Waves)' by hujwernoo. I've just finished binge reading it and I actually physically cried at multiple points, which is very rare for me to do even in real life situations, so I have no doubts about recommending this. It is about if Klaus came back as a ghost when the apocalypse happened, and his misadventures with Five and Delores. It's long, but well worth the read!
“Try not to spike his drink this time, yeah?” His traitorous red-haired friend snorts, as his sister turns to him with a confused and slightly dangerous expression.
Thank you so much for all the comments! There was a load of them last chapter, I really love reading through and seeing your opinions. Theo will be the focus of a chapter soon, just to explain why he said the things he did, but for now he's going to be put to the side. After all, this is a drarry fanfic.
Harry winces, watching Ginny and Luna exchange a knowing look. Yes, the lack of press or media anywhere near Hogwarts may have made him more biased towards getting it, but he wanted the job anyway. He doesn’t necessarily have to do magic, only say the theory and show them the spell a few times. It’s one of the few places in the world in which he can trust everyone there, and the only place in the world that’s ever felt like his true home. Plus, the taste of teaching during Umbridge’s reign made him feel important and worthwhile, helping people through teaching instead of fighting all the time.
“Bring me that book, please. The one with the spell you cast in it. And… I don’t hate you. You did what you did, and I’ve done what I’ve done, and if you can still think I’m decent after that, I can give you a chance too. Call me Theo. Just don’t cast stupid spells again.”
‘The Votum spell, or the fairy godmother spell, is used to grant the wishes of the intended target.’
Further away from the main huddle, Neville is chatting quietly with Nott. Pansy almost becomes interested, until she sees that there is a plant in between them. Of course. Nott nods seriously, then reaches out a hand and strokes the plant, which shivers. It’s strange seeing him so gentle and tender, considering his actions in the war. Still, Pansy isn’t about to judge anyone for what they did back then. She herself behaved like a coward, and is still deeply ashamed of it.
Harry flushes, looking away. “Well, you don’t have to if you don’t want to, I just thought that since we, uhm, kissed, you might like me in the way that I like you? It’s fine if you don’t, I get it, I just had to ask, because-”
Sorry if you voted otherwise, I'll try to include anything else you mentioned you wanted.
(Pale blonde hair, surrounding his face like a halo. The picture of an angel, floating up to heaven, except his skin is cold and his eyes are ice and there’s a drip drip dripping of blood-)
I've just wrote this, and I'm updating early so that I don't have to read through it again. This one's tough. It's probably harder to write than it is to read, but... if you've got invested in these characters... be warned. We've hit the climax.
“Blaise, you can stop now.” Pansy reaches out a hand hesitantly, face worried.
He would have been angry, would still be angry, if his giddiness at being alive and suddenly so free wasn’t whizzing through his mind still. Later, he knows, the full weight of his manslaughter will come down on him and leave him breathless and furious. He wishes his emotions weren’t so unpredictable.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't ask me, mate. McGonagall's the one who put that up."
Finally, Terry heads down, Ron close behind. Harry kneels down in front of the grate, preparing himself, but before he can stick his own head through, one pops up in front of him. Remus’s startled face stares into his, and cracks into a grin.
Oh, Merlin. Draco falls back, head landing against his pillows, and rubs his eyes tiredly. Merlin, why? After all this time, and everything that has happened, he’d thought he’d gotten over it. Especially after the Veritaserum, and the Sectumsempra. But, no, because fate just hates Draco more than he had thought.
The old woman’s gaze softens as she leans back in her chair, regarding him. “You say you’ve thought about this a lot?”
As always, any ideas or questions or random comments are always appreciated! It's great being able to talk to you and see what you think of what I write.
He draws it out, carefully dragging only the purest parts into himself.
Fuck.
It waves a tiny hand back at her, scrambling to hang onto a huge letter S as she picks the paper up.
But then Malfoy had faced him in the Room of Requirement, and Harry had saved him then. Ron had saved Malfoy again from another Death Eater, so it wasn’t fair to say he hadn’t tried. It was just Malfoy being a git throughout all of their school years that meant he couldn’t understand. It wasn’t Harry’s fault.
I love you.
Stole was a strong word for it. Draco hadn’t exactly fought very hard to keep it, and now he had doubts as to whether the wand would even respond to him anymore. It was rotted with dark magic the last time he’d seen it, and by rights it should be completely Potter’s property now. He’d won it in a fair fight.
“It’s ok. That sounds amazing, Hermione. Well done!” Harry grins, holding up his hand for a high five that she gives with an eye roll. “Soon you’ll be running for Minister, no doubt.”
Harry stares at the name. Crabbe, Draco’s lackey, who died in the fiendfyre. He remembers Draco, tears running down his face, screaming that Harry should have saved Crabbe and not Draco.
“Why-... oh.” Harry winces, glancing up. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t thinking.”
Yes, maybe this question is a little for my own benefit, but I really can't decide. He can't be locked up or killed, but other than that the floor is open to any ideas you might have. Let the jury of the comments section decide!
Harry frowns slightly as ginny launches into an enthusiastic rant. She’d moved on too quickly. Normally, she would ramble on about whatever creature she’d mentioned for ages until someone stopped her, but she’d just turned and forgotten about it. He hates to suspect his friends, yet Harry is certain that Luna had lied to him.
The castle is quiet, except for a few adventuring first years he comes across sneaking into Filch’s office. He almost knocks over a stack of books in the entrance to the library, thanks to his poor eyesight, but eventually makes it into the forbidden section unscathed.
The letter clenched in one hand, he climbs over the railings. One step.
Not for Remus, though. Having only Andromeda’s place to go, Remus had decided he would do Harry a favour and renovate Grimmauld Place. What he truly meant was that Andromeda reminded him too much of Tonks. And so, they switched places. Harry stayed with Andromeda over the summer, looking after Teddy, and Remus holed up in Grimmauld Place with Kreacher. The Burrow had been no place for Harry, still isn’t, without Fred’s laughter lightening it up.
The new voice slams into his ribcage, forcing him to fall back to the floor with gasping breaths. A tall thin man stands a little way off, platinum hair streaming down his back like a shining stream of gold, hair that Draco remembers sifting through as a child.
Draco snickers, imagining the many awkward breakfasts that might follow. He remembers enough avoided eye contact from when Pansy slept over at his house. That was enough for a lifetime, and the two of them had only played truth or dare and gossiped about cute boys (carefully avoiding the topic of Harry).
Enjoy!
‘Father’, Draco writes, then winces as cold rain falls down from the words.
Thrusting out the magic, he envisions it like a hand, and reaches out towards the whispering concoction of intertwined magic. There’s some startled muttering and scratching of quills behind him from the Unspeakables, but he drowns it out to concentrate, scowling. The Veil hisses eagerly as the hand delves into it, shifting through the clawing magic to search for the distinct Draco inside there.
This is so mad. I was supposed to be doing my GCSEs this year, but I guess not! I hope everyone is staying safe, washing their hands and surviving isolation. I myself am fine, as I'm a huge introvert who adores hiding in my room with many books, so I wish everyone else the best. Maybe I'll update more often, now that I have too much time on my hands, and you can fend off boredom with this!
“And I’m sorry for it, I truly am. I never wanted to do what I did. I’ve made some horrible decisions, yet somehow, I’m still here.”
Slowly, he warms up to it, joining in with Harry’s words, their voices speaking at jarringly different speeds. Harry slows down, rubbing his thumb across Draco’s hand in a soothing motion.
S.P.E.W. club!
Instead, he lifts his head and flips to the next page of the book. The candle beside him flickers dimly, making the words on the page dance.
They all nod, except for Luna, who’s now whispering to her pocket.
Shaking his head, he dismisses his unease and stops in front of the gates, memories of the last time he was here flooding his mind. Hermione screaming. Bellatrix’s laughter. Dobby’s-
“Give it up.” Blaise drawls from the corner, nose buried in a newspaper. “It’s gone. Kaput. Flown out the window. Buried itself in a hole and died there.”
Enjoy!
The ministry worker laughs uproariously, then stops hesitantly when he sees Harry’s face. “You serious?”
“Ahem.”
Now, days later, Hermione wishes she’d talked to Parkinson about it at the time. The girl’s face is rapidly turning sour, a disbelieving curl to her lip. “Worry about him? Is that the best excuse you could come up with? Granger, darling, I’m more worried when I’m not seeing him. So if you’re done trying to make me go away, I suggest you let me in and take the curse off of him, before I cast a really nasty hex on you.”
Two metres from the gap. He carries on walking. The Gryffindors gradually pull to a halt, confused.
“I’m alright, I don’t think Pansy wants to see me either. I’ll see you around.”
Limbo is quieter than what Draco had expected. He and Black are the only ones there, drifting between life and death, although Black has said that he expects Draco will move on soon. Apparently many people have passed through here.
The glass teeters, then falls over and smashes on the ground. Not so much as a single shard comes flying towards him.
Oh no. Please don’t say you’ve changed your mind. He turns, fingers wrapping into a fist, nails digging into the soft skin of his palms.
The knot in his chest constricts more at his words. Lovely. Blaise just had to give a bloody challenge. A few moments of expectant silence follows, interspersed with whispers, but no one takes the bait. Spinning back around, Blaise marches to an empty carriage, scoffing as he goes.
“So what is wrong?”
He isn’t surprised, honestly. The three of them only came back because Hermione wanted to, and Neville had needed to if he wants to apprentice under Professor Sprout. Hogwarts is a place stained for them all, now.
“Vizzini’s son brought people out of Limbo. Blaise might be able to do that. He can get both Sirius and Draco out of there at the same time!”
He creeps closer, one hand clutching the edge, one hand tentatively reaching out. His fingertips fade right as a tingle of magic rushes over his body. So, there is actually a spell there. Emboldened, he prepares to step out when he makes the fatal mistake.
Theodore nibbles at his lip. He nods, face resigned, knowing the consequences.
“Fine, fine. You win, Blaise.” Harry throws the other boy a galleon, the third one this week, which is tucked neatly into a hidden pocket of his robes. “Anyone want a butterbeer?”
“Yes.”
“I’m not begging- Oh, Merlin, come on.” Harry huffs, marching out of the room with Blaise trailing behind him.
“Your wand? Oh, yes, it is a bit troublesome, I suppose.” With another flick, the stack shoots into a drawer where they now store all his schoolwork. “I could ask McGonagall for permission for us to visit Diagon Alley. What do you think?”
He remembers the silken feel of the black fabric, cold and warm all at once, his seven-year-old back pressing into a bony leg. The cloak, his vampire cloak, shuts out all the screaming and whispers. He’s safe in the cloak. Sev’s hand, long fingers just like his one day, ruffles his hair. And then, as he peeks up to catch a glimpse of his face, the whole scene fades away, and he’s left alone, listening to Potter’s voice outside.
“Mr Lupin.” She curls her lips upward into a stiff smile. “A pleasure to see you.”
“Malfoy’s been staying in his room, professor. I don’t think he’s feeling that well and, uhm, you have to have seen what’s been happening. He can’t step outside without being hexed!” Harry bites his lip, praying Flitwick will let this go.
“We are.” Harry grins. “It doesn’t matter where we are, Draco can still paint and sell his art, and I think he’d prefer staying at Hogwarts too. His mum and my da- I mean, Remus and Sirius are already happy together at Grimmauld Place, they won’t need us there too.”
He smiles gently at her, heart swelling at her praise. It feels like a lifetime ago that he lay in the Manor, unable to move or eat, rotting away in his thoughts.
The group looks startled, all except Luna, and gather around closer to stare at the tiny house elf drawing.
Draco stabilizes himself against the wall as a gust of cold air sweeps from the gap, clouds practically on eye level from their height. Argus is actually going to stroll straight off the building!
“I’m not as stuck up as the others, if that’s what you’re thinking.” Nott glances at him. “I don’t care about any of the pureblood stuff. If Hagrid lets me work with him, I don’t have any reason to hate him. Half giant or not.”
“Shut up!” Blaise roars, magic sparking and flicking from the well, his frustration and annoyance rearing up and latching onto anything close by. Including Harry’s magic.
“Jaebo is happy to have a name, miss.”
Draco did that.
Gotta love those cliffhangers. I didn't intend for Remus to look so bad in this one, it just sort of... happened. He's not a bad person though! Really! I'll put him in a better light next time he comes up.
“Thank you.” Theodore stands, shaky with disbelief. It worked. Despite his anger messing everything up again, despite his terrible speech making, it actually worked. He allows a small triumphant smile to slip onto his face as he reaches the door.
She scowls at him for a few seconds, then continues to chatter away. Draco remains silent, unresponsive apart from the odd shrug, causing her to become increasingly hysterical. Eventually, she storms out to recover in the bathroom, leaving him and Blaise in silence. A few moments pass.
With that, he turns to shuffle out again. The students hurriedly stand, gathering their friends, and follow him through halls they remember off by heart. Harry keeps pace with Ron and Hermione for a bit, before the space becomes too tight, and he’s forced behind. He starts to move to Neville, but he’s engaged in conversation with a hufflepuff girl. Baffled, Harry walks alone.
“He likes you.” Luna smiles, remembering how excited Grendel had been when she told her in person. ‘All those looks he gives her, all those looks she gives him! It’s delightful! Oh, how I wish I could be young and in love again…’
Harry stares, feeling the tension dissolve into the air. There are tears streaming down Malfoy’s hollowed cheeks, actual tears, reddening the outline of his eyes and dripping steadily onto the floor. One thin hand comes up, covering his gasping mouth to stifle the sobs wracking his body. For a moment, the two of them simply sit there, Malfoy desperately trying to stop himself, Harry gaping back.
“...I’m not even going to ask.” Blaise mutters.
Lupin had ducked into the common room briefly, only explaining that he thought Harry was ready to know. The letter he’d passed through is wrinkled and smudged with dirt, most likely from the battle. The edge is singed, bringing unpleasant memories of the heat and panic of the Fiendfyre. Crabbe had died in that fire. Harry remembers how angry Malfoy had been telling him about it, how he’d wished Harry had saved Crabbe instead because…
Hermione winces, and rapidly backs out again as Parkinson’s shrill squeal threatens to make her ears bleed. She’ll give it a good ten minutes, perhaps twenty.
“I don’t!” Harry protests, cursing himself. “I just thought it might hurt.”
“Not many people around who would or could write such a thing.”
“What?! No!”
There’s no response, the darkness shrouding Draco’s bed, only showing the faint outline of his figure.
“My name be Jaebo, Master Draco.” It says after a moment of silence. “Miss Luna says Jaebo should speaks to you about being alive. Tis very strange, sir.”
“They have to suffer EVERY day for what we did!”
There’s a tugging in Draco’s chest. He sits up, startled.
If you could be a creature from the wizarding world, which creature would it be?
There it is. Merlin, Potter, you really love to walk in on the worst moments, don’t you? Draco’s surprised that he wasn’t there when that snake was branded onto his arm.
“Not a clue.” Ginny shrugs.
They’re sat by the column again. Draco’s head in Sirius’ lap, tears dried up and sobs died down into the oppressive quiet of Limbo. He doesn’t think. His vision is webbed, blue waves rushing over his eyes at the harsh light, but he doesn’t care. He can’t care when he can’t think. He can’t feel sad or lonely or desperate if he can’t think.
‘Then, once the meal is rejected, the spellcaster must taste the meal themselves. This will begin the spell, and they should waste no more time before asking the intended their wish. They must respond within thirty seconds.’
Gently, Harry places his wand on the floor, letting the light dim, and wraps Malfoy into a hug. For a moment, he’s worried he’s done the wrong thing. Malfoy tenses, body shaking, but then he relaxes and dumps his head into Harry’s shoulder. His tears leak through Harry’s jumper, but he doesn’t mind at all. A snotty jumper is a small price to pay to make the person you love feel even a little bit better.
“I don’t need your pity, Potter. I’m fine, and I’m smart enough to know that you don’t care about me at all. What are you actually here for?”
He looks down.
Since they started dating, Harry’s brain supplies unhelpfully.
“It is alright.” She smiles. “They need to feel useful.”
“I spent the last of my money getting this done.” He says, letting Harry trace the circle in astonishment. “White magic, specially created to withstand dark magic. It’s rare, impossible to find unless you know where to look. My mother did. I went through her journals, and found a white tattoo artist, who did this for me. The dark magic inside the circle is contained, and can’t do any damage outside of the circle. Therefore, it can’t make me feel pain, or make me think about the Dark Lord, or tell him where I am if he ever does come back.”
He lets out a huge sigh of relief, a beam spreading across his face. “Merlin, thank you, Professor McGonagall!”
“Hermione?”
They know he’s alive, at least. The house elves in the kitchen, overhearing their conversation, told them they deliver food to him every day. Apparently, they’re the only beings he lets into the room, despite the fact that Potter and Michael now have nowhere to sleep. They’ve been jumping around the other dorms for the past few nights, but she can tell Michael is starting to get annoyed. Potter is curiously quiet.
‘I don’t know how it works.’
Draco nods, gulping hard and taking in a deep shuddering breath.
His legs ache from climbing, but he’s almost there. Gritting his teeth, he makes it up the last few steps, and gazes out from the top of the Astronomy Tower. Dumbledore, the bias manipulative old fool, died here. His body fell from… there. Draco leans over the railing, eyes roaming over the destruction, and focuses on the exact point the body hit the ground.
The Saviour, true to his nature, rushes forward to grab Argus, but it’s too late. The old man’s foot goes straight over the rubble and off the building.
‘Wonderful.’ Draco spells, and he means it. Everything else may have completely gone to shit, but his wand still accepts him. Carefully, he shoots a wingardium leviosa, and the chair he aims at doesn’t shoot to the ceiling and set on fire. It lifts, gently, carefully, precisely, just like his spells used to. It feels both familiar and foreign, but it feels absolutely wonderful. A smile rises onto his face.
“No, I know, it’s a big thing.” Harry turns fully to him, swallowing. “I’ll use magic if I absolutely have to, but I need to do this. I want to learn to help without just throwing magic at things. Please, Draco? I promise I won’t take it too far.”
Hesitantly, he nods, still regulating his breathing. For Nott to find him here, like this… He doesn’t think he can quite get over the humiliation. He’s the Saviour. He’s supposed to be the strong, unshakeable one, not the one breaking down in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
His wand couldn’t be saved. That is his price for having the Dark Mark destroyed, so he can't be too upset about it. The poor thing was struggling anyway. Without it, he now has to master using magic without words or a wand, which would be near impossible if Sirius didn’t have as much time on his hands as Draco. During the long days in the ward, he and Draco have been practicing their magic together, offering each other tips and comfort when they fail. Apparently, being trapped in Limbo for years on end restricts magic somewhat.
Then the news had spread. It’s hard to keep a secret in Hogwarts, now, especially when Harry’s involved. So he’d walked through the corridors, avoiding the disgusted glances of eighth years and the disgusting celebrations from the younger years, which made his skin crawl. How can they be happy that Draco is dead? How can they congratulate him for killing an innocent boy?
Lucius swarms forward, pulling Draco into a tight hug he isn't sure what to do with. His throat is clogging up. He wants to say something, needs to spill out all of this emotion, needs to tell his father everything he’s been holding inside since he learnt how to hide.
Relief fills Harry’s stomach as he repeats the words in his head. He didn’t kill Draco. He didn’t, because Draco can be saved, and the stupid spell and the blood and his blank eyes don’t mean anything because Draco can be saved, he can be alive, and his death won’t be on Harry’s hands. He can smile, and laugh, and live out the rest of his life, because they can save Draco. They can save him.
“Only around thirteen days, Miss Luna.” He pipes, now sitting on top of a T. “How old is miss? If you don’t minds me asking.”
Nott pulls down his sleeve again. “Better to be safe than sorry, right?” With that, he pushes open the door to Hagrid’s hut, and heads to the kettle.
Harry flinches, shoving the image away as he examines the room. It must be Draco’s. No guest room would smell this strongly of him, and his parents room would not have an empty wardrobe. Well, almost empty. Robes hang there, green and black and silver. Harry wonders why Draco never wore anything but muggle clothes under his cloak.
“Hello Luna.” Ginny grins, now almost sitting on a furiously blushing Neville’s lap. “Why aren’t you sitting with the Ravenclaws?”
“I- uhm…” Harry slumps in his chair. “Remus, I… I killed Draco. I didn’t mean to. It was a spell gone wrong, and I somehow sent him to Limbo, but Blaise is descended from Vizzini and so can fix it. It’ll be fine. It’ll work out. We can fix this.”
Theodore picks up another cup, dipping his finger into it with a small smile and taking a sip. “Yes. We can save Draco.”
“I’ve read up on the creator of the spell. It’s a witch named ‘Halosydne Vizzini’.” His dark brown eyes rest on Harry as though the name should mean something to him. It doesn’t.
‘Life without magic must be so hard.’ Draco shrugs, lifting a hand to pet Harry’s hair.
They sit in relative silence, all too caught up in the dread that it was only the beginning. Draco is grateful for it, sliding back into the haze where time passes him by without any emotions, good or bad. Head resting against the leather back of his seat, he stares listlessly out of the window, watching the first drops of rain begin to fall.
“I always thought you had an unhealthy obsession with that boy.” His father sniffs, rolling his eyes.
“Harry!”
"Try not to hit someone, Ron." Luna smiles sweetly, letting Ginny pull her into the stream of departing students.
So. Potter told the whole school then. No doubt he told everyone how pathetic he had been, mumbling nonsense and just accepting Potter’s help. Defeated, Draco shakes his head slightly, wincing at the throbbing of his head.
He chooses to just put the cloak on over his current outfit. Tucking the rest into a ball, he walks out of the bathroom and towards his compartment. Blaise and Pansy have both returned before him, along with a more surprising addition. Theodore Nott.
“You’re no better than HIM!”
Black watches him, a concerned wrinkle in between his eyebrows. “What are you trying to do?”
Harry nods wordlessly, trying to remember where he’d seen that outfit before. Green silk, silver sash. Stitches careful but a little too large, done by someone inexperienced.
Theo stumbles back as Draco’s yelling punches inside his mind, smashing every barrier like a mallet to sugar.
“Jaebo can’t leaves, miss.” The house elf shakes its head sadly. “Jaebo has to stay, or poster will be thrown away. Miss Pansy says so, she does. ‘If this house elf weren’t here, this poster would be terrible. I’d have to get rid of it’.” He mimics Pansy’s voice.
As ever, any questions or ideas you have about future chapters or fanfics, please tell me!
Distantly, Harry takes in her swear word, brain fixated on the strangeness of her voice using it. It rolls over in his mind, repeating in her voice, then Ron’s, then Pansy’s, then Luna’s, then Harry’s own.
“He has to be. We don’t have a choice.”
Pansy jumps to her feet, pointing her wand at Theodore. “Out, this is private!”
“Thanks, Pansy.” Harry takes the paper, stuffing it in his pocket. “I’ll make it up to you.”
“Whoops.” Blaise sniggers, then tuts as Hermione’s breath hitches. “I’m joking, Front Teeth, no need to get your knickers in a twist. It’ll make them hard for Weaselbee to get off.”
“Liberacorpus!” Potter yells, landing hard on the floor yet stumbling to his feet again quickly, wand in hand.
It has been far too long since I last updated... and this chapter is basically like 'I've forgotten all my plans, let's make a new one'... and this was the best title I could come up with... things are not going well.
Harry picks at the edge of the table, flushing. He has more money than ever before now, with all of the presents and awards and paid interviews from saving their world. Even before that, his parents had left him enough money to not have to work ever again. For Nott, a pureblood who he’d always thought looked down on him, to not have enough money to eat seems unbelievable. Purebloods are rich and arrogant and fascist. Nott doesn’t seem to be any of these things now.
“Aren’t you going to eat the rest of that?” Again, he shakes his head. “Darling, you need to eat something. Have some carrots at least. Or some pasta.”
Fuck.
“Draco, darling. Are you in there?”
He nods slowly. Maybe he was overthinking this. Harry doesn’t have the capacity to be as subtle as this in rejecting him, and that saving-people-thing is too deeply ingrained into him to humiliate Draco in front of all of these people. He’ll wait until later, reject Draco in private.
“Running away again? Yeah, thought so!” His voice taunts from behind, forcing Draco to spin to them. Opening his mouth, he prepares to yell at them to leave him alone, that they have no idea what he’s like, that he wouldn’t run from them. His voice sticks.
So… this isn’t a hallucination?
“That’s why I recommended the painting set and canvas.” Luna clarifies, looking at the rest of them. “I told you he did very excitable artwork.”
“Really?” She frowns. “I thought you’d want to work with potions.”
“Oh, Harry, I’ve got some news you might want to know…” Remus jumps in, smile spreading once more. Harry suspects he’s just trying to avoid another argument, yet he lets it slide.
“I used to think that I didn’t deserve to be here, when so many better people than me can’t be. I’m sure many of you would have agreed with me. Over time, I realised that I was looking at it all the wrong way.”
“What are you staring at?! Luna may not move too quickly, but I am Sir Leofwine the Rapid! Onward, boy!” The knight speeds off, hollering and blowing a trumpet.
Something’s wrong. There’s another magic there, something familiar but not quite, wrapping around Draco’s magic and resisting Blaise’s increasingly weak attempts.
She snorts. Not like that would happen. The relationships of this year are a far cry from the desperate, clingy lust of the last. Having their lives in danger made many reckless, including Pansy. Now, she wishes she’d waited just a little longer.
“A painter maker, sir.” The house elf finishes for him. “Did Master Draco not know he was one, sir?”
- E.D.
This time Harry’s own hand raises, a sudden thought whizzing round his brain.
“Malfoy! What the hell?!” Potter splutters, struggling to his feet. Draco doesn’t give him time to recover.
“Malfoy…” Professor Lupin (no, not a professor, not anymore) reads over the short letter once, then again, as though he can’t believe what he’s seeing. “Why?”
Draco doesn’t understand. He’s too young, with a brain already foggy with dreams, and not enough experience of the world to understand.
Enjoy!
The Veil stands before them, rippling and whispering, the stench of magic so strong that Blaise has to cover his nose. It’s not like other magical smells; there’s a mash of scents, of different people’s magic battling each other for domination. He can smell the Malfoy’s magic, and the Black’s magic, and Potter’s magic, and a whole host of other unrecognisable ones.
Harry watches Malfoy from the other side of the Great Hall. He’s dropped his head on the table, platinum blonde hair falling messily over the wood.
Then he realises his father is still watching him, and a jolt of panic shoots through him. He never told his father he was gay. He’s the only heir of the Malfoy household, the only one that can carry on their bloodline. He can’t be gay. Not only that, but there would be no way he would have told his father he was with Harry Potter, the Slayer of the Dark Lord, the one who had won the war and ultimately destroyed their chances of a better life.
Draco. The room smells so strongly of Draco that memories flood him, clawing for his attention.
“They’re new, Remus, they-”
“I won’t, I promise. Oh, I really should talk to you more often!” Pansy squeals. “Anyway, what has that got to do with Draco?”
A sigh, exasperated but calm.
Woop! Finally, the ship is happening! It's only taken a total of twenty nine full chapters...
Draco doesn’t, at all, but he nods anyway. He’s lived his whole life with magic, and he’s always thought about what he does, weighing up the pros and cons of every decision. Except for where Harry is involved. Harry has always been the exception.
Terror and fear become his companions once more, and it’s only years later…
Portraits whisper to each other as they pass, grinning at the Gryffindors, sneering at the Slytherins. Further on they go, memories passing them like fading laughter, until they reach a dimly lit corridor with slits of windows. At the end is a large gap in the wall, as though a giant has stuck his fist through it. Filch doesn’t seem to have realised his mistake, however, as he carries on walking towards it.
Ah, well. She’ll have to ask him about it when he’s alive again.
Theo? No, he’s broken up with Draco, he wouldn’t know about him now. Unless Potter made Draco do something to push Theo away? If that is the case, perhaps Theo would be the best person to talk to. Even so, she would rather go to someone else. Theo’s face is overwhelmingly punchable right now.
Then there’s just Harry, hovering by his bed, and Black absorbed in his ghostly motorcycles.
“We’ll find them. We have to.” Harry sighs, glancing out of the window. Hagrid is fast asleep behind them, rumbling snores undisturbed by their bickering, and the whole of Hogwarts seems to be asleep too. “How long do we have?”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Granger? She would know about everything that’s going on with Potter, and she’s been sitting with Draco in the library. As irritating as that is, being replaced by the Mudblood, Pansy can see that Granger must at least feel more sympathetic towards Draco. Yet talking to Granger would mean Granger tells Potter, and if Potter is drugging or cursing Draco, he would try to get rid of Pansy. Not good.
“Did he seem happy?” Black’s face is twisted in worry, hands in his lap tense.
He motions for the house elf to come closer, then tries pushing himself to his feet once more. The creature’s hands steady him by his waist, wrapping around it and letting him grip the emerald silk on its shoulder for support. Draco, the old Draco, would have felt disgusted by this. Needing a house elf for support? Pathetic. This Draco is far too tired to care.
Draco shrugs, dropping his slender arms to tuck his hands into his pockets. He’s still skinny, but he’s nowhere near the skeleton he was all those months ago. Harry supposes his posture helps to make him look less dead - the slight slouch in his shoulders is gone, replaced with the confidence Harry remembers from their younger school days. Somehow, his annoyance at it has gone since then. He feels more happy about it than anything else.
McGonagall lowers her quill, peering at him over her spectacles. “I see. Mr Nott, I hope you understand that the Ministry has put very strict rules over your-”
“I don’t know.” Theo flips a page over. “I don’t know how this is going to work, whether he’ll go back to his body or create a new one.”
“Sorry, headmistress.” Theodore huffs, reigning his anger back in and trapping it under a stony mask. “But what I’m trying to say is that they wouldn’t really care if I wasn’t going to lessons. They’d actually be happier if I was with Hagrid every hour of the day, because it’s far easier to keep track of me with him. Plus, I’d be staying in Hogwarts for the rest of my wizarding career, and so would have no ability to go out and do Death Eater things. Please, headmistress. At least talk to them.”
“Draco’s dead.” She whispers, and Harry falls apart.
Draco grins at him, mind full of (iloveyouiloveyouiloveyou) racing thoughts. He chokes on his words, so much to say and not enough time to say it, and all that flies from him in smoke (white smoke?) is ‘Hi’, because he’s an equally absolute idiot.
“Just wait, maybe the paint isn't dry yet.”
Pansy has slowed her pace to let him catch up, but quickly realises he’s hanging behind deliberately. After so long alone, having her constantly around him is… uncomfortable, to say the least. Not that he doesn’t love her anymore. She’ll always be the only one who gave everything she could for him.
“You’re the Malfoy boy, aren’t you? Narcissa’s kid.” Black walks forward slowly, looking remarkably clean and healthy for a dead man. “How did you get here?”
“What the hell?! Potter? Granger? Why not me?!”
Filch, Mrs Norris at his heel, hobbles forward. It’s amazing that the cat has managed to survive this long, considering her age. Harry’s surprised to find he doesn’t feel disappointed by this. Perhaps he’s developed a soft spot for her and her owner, considering that they’ve been consistently there, unchanging, throughout all his years. What a horrid thought.
The whispers that spread throughout the hall are louder this time, taking at least a minute to die back down again. The four of them exchange looks. If one of these vigilantes was searching for a perfect group to attack, they would be the ideal candidates. Theodore swallows anxiously, throat bobbing and fingers clenching the table edge.
Crackling yellow spells attract his attention to a dining room, door open yet sealed off with magic. He can feel the pulsing heart of dark magic inside of there, hear the screeching frost stabbing into him, and knows he could walk in that room and let himself be ripped apart by it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you want to go out with me?”
He should be glad that the war is over. He tells himself this every night, just before he falls asleep, trying to overcome the helplessness. But he’s not, he’s really not, because without the war he isn’t the Saviour, or the Boy Who Lived, or the head of an army. He’s been given a pat on the head, and now the world has spat him back out as a nothing.
Sure enough, entering fifteen minutes later with three cups of tea, she finds the two of them slogging through the mountain of work. She joins them, passing out the tea and settling down on a cushioning charm. Parkisnon mutters a reluctant thanks, and they sit quietly. Time ticks by. Eventually, Parkinson sighs, and holds out her hand to Hermione.
How are you all? Good? Great. I'm fine, thanks for asking. How's Draco? Not so great. I have kept with the theme of every chapter being uneccessarily dramatic and painful, on that front you will never be disappointed. Fluff? Not in this one, unfortunately. Soon, I promise.
“I’m sorry, father.” Draco sniffles. “I only wanted to be like that bird. It looked so free and pretty…”
If this smoke spell could be cast on a book of your choosing, which book would it be?
“You better.” She sniffs, lifting her nose. “Bring Draco back, or I’ll make sure your nose stays broken next time.”
Scowling indignantly, Parkinson marches over to Malfoy’s side, away from Zabini mouthing 'Great job, Pans!' with a shit-eating grin on his face. Malfoy lifts his head, hazy eyes drifting over the scene, and Harry is struck with how gaunt his face is. In their brief confrontations, he hadn't had time to properly see him, and during dinner the discomfort at Malfoy even being there had distracted him.
“Do you like it?” Luna sits on his bed, gazing at him hopefully.
“Limbo isn’t exactly death, but I guess you could-”
“Harry stalked Draco, Gin.” A dreamy voice supplies from behind Ron, who jumps and curses as he splashes himself with gravy.
‘What’s got you so happy?’ Draco trails out of the chair and collapses into his bed, almost groaning in plaesure at the softness of it. He wishes he could lie here forever and never get up.
"Pansy, Slytherins can't be given special treatment. You're not going to need wards or a wand during the night, don't be so melodramatic. Sit down."
They all hold their breath, crammed together around the painting, Draco nervously biting his nails. Pansy had told him to stop it, since it was a ‘disgusting habit’, but after the fifteenth time she’d given up. Besides, the waiting put everyone on edge.
Harry’s puffing like Slughorn by the time he nears the corridor. If this does turn out to be a prank, he won’t have the strength to fight it off, but he turns the corner anyway.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
It’s cold outside, the sort of day Wood would declare perfect for quidditch. All the students are in lessons, however. He should be in his lesson. His legs stall, wondering if he should turn back and apologise. Then the horror creeps in, pushing him forwards.
In that moment, he hates Malfoy more than words can describe. This disgusting boy had made every interaction hell, had fought on Voldemort’s side, and now to make it all ten times worse, he is making Harry feel pity for him.
It’s unrecognisable. Fairy lights dance around in the air, blue and gold and silver, and the floor is covered in soft multicoloured rugs. Every exposed piece of metal has been charmed a different colour, and strings of dyed wool link together and hang from above. It’s a mad mix of clashing visuals, but Draco loves it, because it overwhelms every bad memory that had tainted this tower.
“Hey, that’s our poster for… Didn’t you draw that, Draco?” Pansy asks, eyes wide and shocked as she turns to him.
Perhaps they were, because this force is stronger than him. His heels dig into the ground as he’s towed forwards, towards the arch. No, no, he doesn’t want to die.
‘Freedom. Pans, remember the House Elves Enslavement Act of 1244?’
“Of course.” He bites out immediately, standing and fumbling with his wand. “I’ll- I’ll just be leaving now. I’m sorry, Narcissa.”
Hermione shrugs, tearing her eyes away from Pansy. “I know. I don’t even think she likes girls anyway. But… at least I can be her friend, right?”
Without another word, Theo wanders past a shocked Poppy to the door, and leaves. Draco doesn’t stop him.
“Draco?” Sirius frowns, watching him.
She spins back around, narrowing her eyes at him. He’s looking back down at his work, cheeks dusted pink, hand clutching the quill a little too tightly.
He flinches, the arms around him warm and unnatural. He hates it, he wants the man far away from him, but he can’t tell him. He can’t say one single thing, so he dumps his head on the man’s shoulder and nods weakly. Another few seconds like this won’t kill him, really.
- E.D.
“You don’t have to say it right now.” Harry rubs his cheekbone with his thumb, soft and gentle and so much better than Draco could ever be worth. “We have all the time in the world. Even if you never manage to say it, I will still know it. It doesn’t matter if you can’t say it. It doesn’t make it any less valid. I love you, and you love me.”
“What do you mean?” Pansy questions, a breath of air passing over his soaked skin as she turns to him.
He doesn’t want to be some sort of figurehead for those stupid ideas. He doesn’t want people to think he meant to do it. He hates the admiring glances, hates the pats on his back and the small notes they pass him. It’s only been two days since Draco died, and yet he feels like he’s going insane with all of the attention, getting whiplash from the extremes of good and bad.
Harry huffs, sparing the shattered glass a glance before moving to help. Recharge, that’s what Hermione says. Harry can’t help but think that this is his punishment from some higher power for daring to mess with fate.
Harry sits in the hospital wing, clutching a broken nose, and regretting every decision he’s ever taken.
They sit there for a while. Harry doesn’t know how long, yet the feel of Malfoy curled up in his arms makes the time irrelevant. Neither move, except for Malfoy’s weakening sobs. It’s… nice.
Hermione must know, if she’s been thinking about it. Harry glances to her, and realises she’s lowered her wand. What? Why? Her face is resigned, pitying, and her gaze is directed to Malfoy, whose hands are now clenched in his robes. Oh. She’s fallen for his trick.
Harry brings Draco breakfast, and finds that he has died. His wand is destroyed, and his dark mark has been removed from him physically, with a mirror shard. Hermione sees after Harry, then another person who screams, which brings the rest of the eighth years over to see. Pansy checks on Draco, announces that he's dead, and then Hermione makes everyone leave. Harry is frozen for all of this.
Hermione’s face flames red as Pansy contains her snort of laughter. Harry shakes his head, trying not to get that image stuck in his head. “Blaise, please, let’s just go. We need to work out the specifics.”
“Oh, it wasn’t serious.” She reassures, smiling back at the giggling pixie in the portrait behind her. “At least, not for Blaise. Draco told me they’d laughed it off, since they were both drunk and high at the time.”
“Me and Harry want to become professors.” Neville explains, bouncing with happiness. “Me in Herbology, Harry in DADA, obviously. I can’t believe she actually said yes! Snape didn’t even get the Potions position until three years after he graduated!”
Draco’s dead, and Harry is completely certain it’s all his fault.
He shifts uncomfortably, hand adjusting his glasses. “Well, I was wondering why you and Malfoy- I mean, uhm, Draco - aren’t talking anymore? You were really close, and then…”
“Draco! Careful with that paintbrush, darling!” Pansy squeals, jumping away from the accidental flick of paint flying her way.
“Here.” Harry pushes forwards, giving the boxes to their respective people. To Black, he grins as he passes it over, receiving a vigorous hair ruffle in return. To Draco, he smiles in an awkwardly shy but hopeful way, cheeks flushing as Draco returns it. Draco’s heart does a little flip at the expression, mind racing with ‘how could I ever deserve that face’.
Draco steels his nerves, cold fury hardening around his heart as he makes to pull away.
“I don’t think we need bother with formalities. You are all grown ups now.” McGonagall seats herself among them, placing her hat on the tabletop. “Eighth year isn’t something we’ve ever had to do before, but Hogwarts will always have a place for those who need it. Unfortunately, physical space is something rather lacking in your house dormitories, so we are using a spare wing for you to share, three or two to a room.”
He wouldn’t show anyone, right?
Wiping any pained expression from his face, he pulls himself to his feet and unseals the door, dragging it open. His torso is instantly wrapped in Pansy’s arms, sending stabbing pains through his body at the pressure. Behind her, Blaise stands, arms folded and chin raised, looking as neat as ever. Of course he does. He hadn’t been through the war.
Along with this, any questions, ideas, or random babbles are very much appreciated.
a) Write a lot of short one-chapter fics during that time
“So stay out of my business, Potter.” Nott spits, voice trembling ever so slightly. “Stay out of my business, and I’ll stay out of yours. Permanently.” Tucking the shivering plant under his arm, Nott shoves Harry’s shoulder as he storms out.
“Yeah. Oh! Yeah, in there, it said that every house elf who becomes a slave must be kept fairly, with bedding and nourishment. Before that, house elves were sort of like strays. Any house elf brought in could easily be replaced, so every one was in fear of being kicked out and left to starve again. That’s why they made the HEEA.” Pansy nods, then scowls. “I hate knowing all that. Makes me sound like a weird bookworm.”
“I’ll go get Ginny.” Blaise sighs. “Harry, Hermione, it’s been wonderful knowing you. Please don’t drag my fashion line through the mud by wearing the clothing wrong if you buy some.”
Eventually, like everything in his life, his temporary happiness is abruptly cut off by the screeching of brakes. He groans in annoyance as she lifts his head off her, complaining about her pins and needles.
Harry shivers. Something about the way he says it makes the hairs prickle on the back of his neck. Maybe he was right to try and help, to try and cure Draco of this sickness Gobsy thinks he had.
“But I can’t. If things were different, maybe I could have. But I can’t, because I’m ashamed of a lot of things I’ve done over our time together.”
“Narcissa…” Harry hates this. He hates this with a burning passion, but he has to do it because this was his fault, and these are the consequences. “Narcissa, Draco is dead.” He forces himself to meet her eyes at this.
“Sit, Gobsy. We’re both guests here.” She sighs, patting the seat beside her. The house has changed from what she remembers, although she supposes that is the point. Ridding the house of the remnants of her family is entirely why she is here.
Harry groans as Blaise’s knight cuts off his king’s head. “Again? How? I thought I was getting better!”
“Draco?” Luna’s honest blue eyes gaze at him, and he knows she would never lie. If she thinks Draco would want to hear this, he should, right? He trusts her, even if he doesn’t trust Theodore anymore. Slowly, he nods his head.
‘My wand.’ He spells, the action now as easy as breathing.
“Bye.” He turns away as she trots off, seeing McGonagall in the corner and heading over.
A soft thump startles him from his thoughts. He directs his wand light at Malfoy, who’s sat down heavily, watching the wand in his lap with disbelief. Black wisps of smoke are trailing around his head, forming into words and sentences which scatter as soon as they form. Harry holds his breath, unwilling to disturb the opportunity to read his thoughts.
A sinking starts in Draco’s chest, fingers of dread dragging his mood down even further. Today really can’t get any worse.
Enjoy!
Harry crouches in front of him, taking his hands gently. Malfoy flinches, taking in a huge gulp of air, right as the smoke vanishes without warning. Grey eyes flick up to meet green, guilt flashing across them as sharp as a dragon’s tooth. Malfoy looks so vulnerable, so ashamed of what he’s done, pinched face twisting with disgust at himself. Harry recognises that look - he saw it in the mirror every day as a child. But he doesn’t feel pity; he feels a rush of hope and excitement, because Malfoy is about to apologise.
- E.D.
‘It’s been an hour already.’
Thank you for giving this a go, and enjoy the new chapter!
“Mrs Malfoy.”
What fandoms do you like reading about on here? Or which fandoms do you think you'll start reading about?
“Before you came here, did you see Harry?” Black breaks the silence, words a shock in the still quiet.
Thank you so much to everyone who sent those lovely comments to me! I'm really grateful to know how much you support me and I hope I can pay you back sufficiently with my writing. You have all been kind and are such nice people to have reading this.
Thud. He lands on the floor, eyes blown wide up at the person hurrying so fast they didn’t see him. They’re male, and as he turns hastily, an apology written over his face, Draco sees the black hair and green eyes and those ridiculous glasses and knows he’s screwed.
“So?” Theo folds his arms, scowling. “We did what we had to do, we shouldn’t have to suffer for that. The war’s over, like McGonagall said. What’s done is done, and I refuse to spend the rest of my life regretting that.”
“Uhm…” Harry glances at Theo, who rolls his eyes.
He doesn’t know why he writes it, but some part of him yearns to go outside. The other parts scream resistance.
Smiling weakly, he turns back to the half-unwrapped box, trembling fingers ripping away more. What if it’s just a sign saying ‘I don’t want to date you’ from Harry? What if it’s a little more subtle, like a poem about an ignorant peasant who falls in love with a prince, and ignores every sign that the prince actually hates him?
(I’m sorry. I failed you, and your mother.)
“Listen up!” Pansy’s voice cuts through the low bubbling of conversation. “There’s a party in here tomorrow, ‘kay? Bring firewhisky and anyone else who isn’t here right now. Except for Theodore, Justin and sixth year or under, obviously. Oh, and you either gotta pay to get in or donate time for making flyers and posters, cause we’re raising money for a charity. Got it? Good.” She flicks her hair and saunters out, leaving Hermione with a sign up sheet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“HOW can you say that?! I regret it EVERY waking moment, WHY should you feel NOTHING?!”
One finger of his right hand lifts. Pansy, one.
“But that isn’t what you called me for, right?” He tilts his head, revealing the smooth skin of his neck, and she digs her nails into her palms. Not yet.
‘Sorry.’
His father looks around at them all, painted features shifting from the warm smile Draco had painted him in, to a bewildered sort of awe. That’s when Draco knows it isn’t his father at all. He’d tried to focus on the memories of before the war, when it was just him, his mother and his father against the world. But even then he wouldn’t have revealed his emotions so clearly.
“It was my idea.” Harry grins. “Theo told me about it, so Blaise helped Pansy cast it before we wrapped the books. I would have asked you, but that would have spoiled the surprise.”
“Better. Now tell me what you’re going to do to improve.”
“Luna. Luna Lovegood.” She says, reaching out to pet the lion’s head. “How old are you, Jaebo?”
She picks up her quill, and begins writing again. “I don’t think you are talentless. It takes a unique person to lose a war and still have faith in their decisions. Hogwarts will be honoured to have you looking after it.”
“I won’t!” Harry promises, fingers crossed together behind his back. “Thanks, Remus. You’re really helpful. I’ll send over some chocolate from Honeydukes next time I visit.”
He flushes bright red, shaking his head. “Nevermind, it’s nothing.”
Abbott, Hannah
“Are we ready?” Harry glances around the group. “Is this it? Is the plan finally done?”
Luna hums, thinking. “Was it… Draco?”
(See the end of the chapter for
His fingers clutch the railings, knuckles whiter than his face, refusing to let go. Somewhere in his mind, a desperate little voice pushes out, begging not to die. He’s so scared. His heart is thudding in his chest, but he wants this! If he can’t be killed fighting, the story still needs a conclusion. He needs to die.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I am going to update this once a week, but I got far too excited about people actually enjoying my work. Thank you so much for the kudos! Here's another chapter as a reward.
Parkinson must have snapped. She’s got that feral look in her eye, the one Ron had when they destroyed the locket, and Hermione’s hands are too full with schoolwork to grab her wand. What is she supposed to do? Talk Parkinson down? If not that, she could at least distract her enough until Draco is done, then he can step in and stop her. Parkinson always listens to Draco, right?
“Sorry, guys, I’ll talk later.” He says to them, taking Draco’s hand and walking away. They each call a goodbye after him.
“Quidditch. Holyhead Harpies.” Ginny recounts, small giggles slipping out. “I’m gonna play chaser when they’ve finished my training.”
Harry looks over at the person shaking on the floor, and his mind stops functioning. He’d recognise that beanie anywhere.
“Ow.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fuck.
“But it’s not time, yet!” Theo says, hurrying forward and leaving Hermione to shuffle through notes. “He needs to be fully through before your magic is needed to break the spell. If you use your magic up now, he’ll stay a ghost when he comes through!”
Next chapter finally done! Really hope you enjoy this one - it's been completed tiny bits at a time so may have become a little jerky.
"Death Eater Scum! You should be in Azkaban!"
“Hm.” Pansy raises an eyebrow noncommittally, not bothering to look over from where her and Hermione are working on… something. Harry isn’t quite sure. “As long as I get a new necklace, and a new Draco to do my hair for me. You’re useless at it.”
All he has to do is find Vizzini’s descendant.
“I’m not entirely sure that’s a good thing for the Ministry to be doing, but I’m happy for you too.” Hermione chimes in, sliding next to Blaise with a clipboard in her hand. “Any of you donating?”
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck-
“Who’s Red Hawk?” Hermione questions, eyebrow raised skeptically.
Any other suggestions are greatly appreciated, I'd hate to leave you with nothing from me to read for the duration of the fic.
- E.D.
(Vincent. His name was Vincent.)
“I don’t know. I left that to Hermione.” Ron mumbles, suddenly serious, and Harry winces. His guilt had never truly vanished. Most days after the battle, he’d stared at the ceiling every night, wondering how many people he could have saved if he’d just done something a little differently. Luckily, he’d had so many wonderful friends to help him through it, and now he manages to stop the spiralling thoughts.
“Is that really you?” His father crouches down beside him, reaching out a hand to touch Draco’s cheek. He flinches back, the blinding pain of a crucio flashing through his mind. His father falters, uncertainty passing over him, and Draco can see the lines in his face deeper than they’ve ever been before.
Pomfrey tends to his broken nose quickly, roughly, and then speeds away again. He wonders whether she loved Draco too, in the end. She’d healed his arm, when Buckbeak attacked him. She’d tended to his sectumsempra wounds. She’d been there to heal the bruises when Draco was attacked and Harry brought him here. She’d looked after him after the boggart incident. For him to be dead, after all that care and attention…
Draco sighs. “Y-yes.” His voice is a whisper, strained and choked, but it’s there. “S-stop- stop wor-worrying.”
Warm arms wrap around him, lifting his body away from the cold floor. Pain stabs into his ribs for a moment, making him hiss in pain, but then it fades as the arms adjust him.
He nods, slowly, and hugs Harry back when he moves in. He wishes things were different, that he could say what he means and express himself without choking on empty air. He wishes he could bring himself to believe Harry. He wishes he were better, happier, stronger, and he wishes he hadn’t been so stupid in the first place.
A choked sob escapes him, so he lets it all out and screams. The sound echoes through the trees, primal and raw, fueled by horror and guilt and pain. He shouldn’t have done it. Draco was getting better. He’d wanted to help, he’d wanted Draco to do everything he ever wanted. He wanted Draco to speak. He wanted Draco to tell him how grateful he was, to tell him he loved him.
“Aw, was poor darling getting scared?” Blaise snorts, earning a smack from Pansy. Inbred.
“Why was this the first place you went?” Harry asks, turning to follow the house elf. He isn’t sure why he asks, exactly, he only feels there has to be something significant about it. Surely a house elf would automatically go to the kitchens, or their living area.
“I said ‘that’s true’. Only you could be as fabulous as a phoenix, Pans.” He mumbles, not daring to meet her eyes.
But Harry can’t see the future, so he can’t be certain. He never thought he’d end up with Draco, after all.
“Yes, thanks.” Harry nods, hands twisting nervously together. “Professor, have you thought about what I said yesterday?”
The main girl screams just as the clock Harry had set up chimes eleven. Harry suddenly sits up, making Draco whine at the cold, and pauses the film.
None of these things happen.
He doesn’t want to die. He might be already dead, but he doesn’t want to go, not yet. He wants to wait here for his mother, however long that takes.
“What?!” Hermione’s head flies up, eyes wide and panicked.
“Well, well, well. Isn’t that a surprise.” Theodore tilts his head, narrowing his eyes at the book. “Then again, he has the same arrogant streak as Vizzini, even if he doesn’t have the same amount of power. You think he’s up to it?”
‘Why doesn’t he just lock the door?’ Draco flicks the comment into the air, letting it drift over the projection and dissipate.
Unfortunately, Draco hates the other professor on sight. He’s a sandy haired, disgustingly attractive, blue-eyed fool. It’s obvious in the way all the girls, and some of the boys, cheer when he flashes them a bleached-white grin. Making an annoyed hiss, Draco scowls at him. Doily. Yeah, that suits him. A man as unnecessary and frilly as him should have a name like Doily.
“Saint Mungo's?” Neville asks.
“Well, neither am I, mate.” Ron snorts. “But at least I know when I’m an Auror, I won’t be prancing about in bloody heeled boots. You know how impractical those things are?”
In the end, he should have just stopped himself slipping so far.
Reluctantly, Ron drops his wand to his side.
Draco weaves his way over to her, taking in the theme of purple, grey, and white, as well as the shifting animals across the walls. A snake - its scales unnecessarily shiny - hisses at him from above the mantelpiece, before slithering after a badger snuggling a lion. Abbot is tracing her finger over the wings of an eagle, which fluffs its feathers proudly.
‘No. I can’t.’ Draco places down the cup, a painful twisting in his gut. ‘I don’t hate you. But I can’t love you, not like this. Goodbye, Theo. Good luck.’
...that he realises the werewolf still has the letter.
“What would it be Master Draco is wanting, sir?” It squeaks, gazing at him with round, watery eyes.
The front doors are already open when he reaches them, but no Narcissa greets him. He steps inside nervously, looking around the large entrance hall. Portraits look back, murmuring to each other, a few with hideous scratches along them. Werewolf claws, by the looks of it. Greybeard.
There’s some elements of his father to it. If you had only met Lucius once a week, or had known him as a colleague, the impression would be startlingly realistic. You might even be convinced that it really is him. But for Draco, who has grown up knowing every inch of his father, he can see that the painting is nothing more than a copy, a bland clone of the real man.
“S.P.E.W. actually.” Hermione huffs, feeling the familiar anger rise up in her. She still can’t understand why everyone was so against it. Even her own friends! Especially Ron! “And before you say anything, I’ve stopped it. I know ‘the house elves don’t want to be free’, ‘they’re happy as they are’, et cetera, et cetera.”
A choked gasp, and nothing more. He tries, pushing all of his energy into it, battling against the sudden spikes of guilt and shame. Still nothing. Again. His throat rasps, burning the skin inside of it, blocking up and ripping open when he coughs. Nothing. Over and over again, there’s nothing.
Malfoy started getting up. The 20 minutes Hermione stands outside is to let him get changed before she comes in. After she leaves, he’ll go straight back to bed, but it’s an improvement. Harry can’t help feeling a little miffed that Malfoy makes the effort for Hermione and not him, but on the bright side it shows he’s relatively comfortable around Harry.
“What happened in sixth year?” Ginny leans over Neville, who protests weakly.
Malfoy, Draco
I promise this won't happen again.
Gradually, he regains enough of his balance to walk unassisted, yet the house elf insists on staying by his side, ‘just in case youse is gonna falls, sir’. He doesn’t change, not quite yet ready, so they make their way through the empty halls, Draco’s eyes fixed on the floor, until they reach the kitchens. The house elves don’t shoo him out politely like they used to do. The dining room is a closed off area now, crackling yellow spells across the doors as though they could hold in the nightmares of that place. Even if any of them could steel themselves to go in there, the stench of dark magic and death would be enough to drive them out.
Blaise blinks, wobbling on his feet as he stares at the mess of people around him, who stare back.
“Draco, darling. Are you in there?”
“Parkinson should lower hers first.” Ron interjects, eyes narrowed.
The Great Hall has been decorated with bright colours, banners strung from every wall and plates of food floating through the air. Originally, this was supposed to be a relaxed event to say goodbye to everyone, but Hermione had somehow managed to commandeer the whole thing into a F.H.E. event (Free the House Elves. Pansy had flat-out refused to keep calling it S.P.E.W.) and now boxes for donations and sign up sheets are everywhere in sight. Ron had been skeptical, until Blaise had drawn him into an idea about house elf themed wizarding chess. Now their prototype chess board sits by a wall, a group of seventh years poking at the figures.
Oof, I can't write romantic stuff. Sorry if that was awful... I'm better with angst.
He can just hear it, the subtle way his father tells him how proud he is of him. At least this copy didn’t miss that. Draco’s sight suddenly becomes incredibly blurry, so he buries his face in his arm and wills away the tears. As usual, he feels Harry’s arms wrap around his waist the second he does so, Harry’s chin on his shoulder, muttering reassurances.
“Don’t thank me yet.” She holds up a hand, a pleased twinkle in her eye. “You’ll need approval from the Professor’s Association, and you’ll likely be sharing Theodore’s quarters between the three of you for now. I don’t see why Professor Heartstringer wouldn’t agree, but she might decide not to accept you as her trainee assistant.”
“What are you going to do?” Luna hums, settling on the floor and turning to him as though she hadn’t just witnessed his first ever breakup.
Draco backs up quickly, mind racing. Had someone cast a hallucination curse on him? This can’t be real. Black fell through the Veil, so he’s dead, he can’t actually be walking towards Draco, he can’t be!
A snide smirk.
“I’ll call you… Jaebo.” She hums, sitting by the fireplace.
It doesn’t matter.
Mine would have to be Luna. My second is Newt, because he's just too adorable and nice, but Luna does what she wants and does not care one bit about what other people think, which I adore. Plus, she's really pretty, so...
The veritaserum. All to know the truth from Draco, so he can exploit every weakness he learns. Then he pushes Draco into Theo’s arms, knowing that they would eventually split up and Draco would be sad and vulnerable. Finally, he casts Imperius, knowing that with Draco’s lowered defenses he could overpower him easily. The Imperius lets him control Draco, do what he wants with him. Now he’s in Draco’s room, with Draco under his control, and Potter fucking likes him.
Pansy raises her eyebrows. “Uhm, that’s not what I was going to say. I actually think it’s quite good.”
Pansy. He wishes she would leave him alone. It’s harder to focus on dying when she’s there, reminding him of all the pain he will cause.
Luna is the only one who sticks around. She invites him to talk to the thestrals, to collect herbs, to knit scarves and sew outfits. He thinks about how she’d greeted Draco at the start of the year, all kindness and smiles, ready to forgive him for everything, and he feels sick to his stomach. She reminds him too much of Draco. Her long blonde hair is light and fluffy, like Draco’s halo of hair, and her pale skin and quiet manner sparks images of Draco on his good days. She smiles, a smile that Draco used to receive, half pity and half love.
Move. Pounding heart, aching legs, clawing at his stomach. Tense muscles. His glasses slip, sticky with sweat which really shouldn’t be coming out of him, he’s not running, but his hands are clammy and it’s definitely his because he’s thinking about it again.
It’s worth it.
Harry falls silent, the most important but most awkward question on the tip of his tongue. “What… what about Teddy?”
“Harry!” Luna’s voice, sharp and urgent, snaps at him from behind. He turns, frowning, to find her dreamy expression twisted in concern. “You need to go to the fourth floor corridor. Now! Don’t ask questions! Go!”
‘Jaebo.’ He draws out, smoke faint and blurred from shock and exhaustion. ‘Did I make you like this? Am I’ At this point, the smoke fades out, his magic (Harry’s magic, Blaise’s magic) too turbulent to keep it up.
Fuck.
And today's recommended writer is... Gwendee! For anyone who loves the very niche fanfictions of Asano Gakushuu from Assassination Classroom, gwendee is the perfect person to follow. There's everything from mildly traumatic distress to hilariously over-the-top reactions. Best of all, the characterisation is so believable and entirely human (well, human as in human emotions... there is supernatural Gakushuu thrown in there).
But Malfoy is not like Ron, or Hermione, or Ginny. Malfoy can’t joke without a voice, can’t smile after years of scowls, and can’t shrug when he doesn’t leave his own bed. Harry is left fumbling, trying to edge around difficult topics that he hadn’t realised were sensitive.
Thank you very much to the person who pointed this out to me, I wouldn't have realised otherwise!
Spell after spell is cast, hexes and jinxes and counter curses flying everywhere. Draco can feel the bruises and burns accumulating, slowing him down, but he refuses to stop. He can’t let Potter get away with all the pain he’s caused. He has to make Potter pay. But he’s running out of things to throw at him, and this feels far too much like sixth year for his comfort. The only thing that has changed is that he’s not a pathetic child anymore. He’s been through a war, and the curse he tried back then for the first time has been cast many times since. He can do it now. Then Potter will suffer.
“Anything for you, fair maiden.” He simpers, tucking his wand back into his trousers. He’d designed the pocket there himself, fully warded and disguised. Smart, really, but Pansy is more appreciative of the uninterrupted view of his ass.
“This is my final question, I swear.” Harry sits back, hands sliding to intertwine with Draco’s. “What was up with that sweater? Near the start of the year, you wore… my sweater. At least I think it was mine. I never got to ask you about it.”
Harry snorts. “Oh, it’s fine. Let him hide it away in the attic until he decides it really isn’t worth the space.”
“It might take three years to be up to a high enough standard, though.” Ginny points out. “Still, sounds cool! Less publicity, too, I’m guessing.”
I love you, he tries.
“Yes, my beautiful?”
“Ignore them.” Ron shakes his head. “We only need the stupid blonde git, right?” He glances at Harry, who holds onto Blaise’s wrist. No, it isn’t for support. That’s unnecessary, Blaise doesn’t need support. Theo insisted he do it, to make the transfer easier.
“Why do you think I took it out about five minutes ago?”
“Sure you were.” Blaise winks at him, blood-red shirt styled to casual elegance. “Ron and I were discussing potential Auror robes designs. Care to contribute.”
Pansy scowls at her, folding her arms. “Oh, you can’t be serious. He cannot. That’s just not possible. He’s hexed me fifty times every month!”
‘You won’t have known about it. It’s just something purebloods learn about as a kid, since they have so many house elves running around them.’ Draco drops his arm, exhausted from all the writing.
Harry sighs, dropping back into his seat. Ron and Hermione offer him sympathetic looks (well, Hermione’s is more of a ‘what have you done now’), and walk out together. Parkinson groans in exasperation, flicking her hair over her shoulder and lounging back in her chair. He’s surprised she doesn’t glare at him, seeing as that has been every interaction they’ve had recently, but he supposes she’s thinking about Zabini again. Oh, great! Now Luna’s got him thinking about who likes whom.
“Why is everyone calling him Draco now?” Harry groans, head sliding onto the chessboard, the pieces wailing as they fall to the floor. It feels like all the years of hate and distrust are falling away far too easily for everyone but him. First Luna, then Remus, then Hermione. What next? Ron?
“Ronald Weasley!” She tuts, letting Harry relax. That’s the only benefit to them fighting all the time; Harry doesn’t have to answer difficult questions. “Anyway, you haven’t answered my question!” She pokes him, and he groans in despair.
Why can’t he just go home?
A chuckle ripples through them all as they surround them. Poppy is eying the hoard with an unimpressed look, but she doesn’t move to shoo them out like usual. Apparently coming back from the dead has its perks.
Draco nods, suppressing the fluttering in his stomach. The last time he saw Harry, the man had kissed his forehead. He reaches pale fingers up and brushes them over the spot, recalling the soft press of lips to his skin.
“It hurts!”
Also, Happy New Year!!!
“I would suggest that Potter pays for it, but he needs to send his money to dear Weasel Hair, who is buying wedding rings.” Blaise drawls, examining his nails.
“So much for Gryffindor bravery. You’re only brave when you have the advantage, and then you pretend you’re outnumbered.” Zabini scoffs, his irritatingly perfect smirk in place. “Lower your wands, and stop embarrassing yourselves.”
Draco doesn't understand. He hates Potter, hates him with every fibre of his being. He wants to see Potter punished, which is exactly what this spell does, so how does it fail him now? How can it work on innocent muggles, yet refuse to make the man who destroyed his world do more than wince?
A knock comes from the doorway. Harry turns, smiling as he sees Draco standing there. His muggle jeans are a light shade of blue, the sweater over them a deep purple. His beanie from the beginning of the year is tucked over his hair, loose strands of pale blonde messy under it. Harry walks over, running his fingers through it to try and get it to stay down, which it does, unlike his messy mop. Draco does the same for him, although it’s unfortunately in vain.
Draco cringes, remembering countless conversations about his weak health. His father says it’s made Narcissa dote on him too much, but Draco knows it’s made his father think of him as a weakling, some puny skeleton that can be trampled easily.
Draco lifts a hand to his forehead, lightly pressing his fingers on the wet spot. Yes, Harry James Potter, the Boy Who Lived Twice, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, had just kissed him on the forehead, just like that.
Now, onto the chapter! Enjoy!
When Harry suggests getting together with both of the groups on New Year’s Eve, Draco almost blacks out at the thought. One household was overwhelming enough. So instead they decide to have a quiet night in their dorm, a muggle movie and some popcorn to fill the time. Neville is the only one who isn’t going elsewhere, and after hearing of their plans, he tactically decides to spend the evening with Theo and Hagrid instead.
“Reading? Afraid I don’t know the word.” Black sniggers, examining them.
“On the way in? Careful, you don’t know what you’ll find in there.” The ministry worker chuckles, punching his shoulder lightly. “Might be some stray curses from You Know Who! Still, I’m sure you could stop ‘em. You are the Saviour, after all!”
“Oh no.” Neville suddenly whispers, face white. They all turn to stare at him.
Theodore wanders over, face in that flat expression that Draco has come to recognise as irritation. “They’ve separated us.”
“Now, if you wanted.” She casts a tempus. “Yes, they should all be downstairs. You should come with me.”
“Who’s that?”
“Jaebo doesn’t know when he was made, miss!”
“There’s nice buttery croissants, and warm pain au chocolat, and tea with heaps of sugar, just how you like it.” Harry coaxes, certain that the smell will wake Draco up.
He waves his ticket lightly in the air, the material creased from the amount of times he twisted it, and gestures towards the train.
“So, you’re saying I’m descended from an incredibly powerful witch?”
“Good point.” Remus nods at her. “I just hope that they decide to drop it and keep this on the down-low. I don’t want to have him back only to drop him straight back in there again.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Tears sting his eyes, ripping him from the shocked calm. Draco opens his mouth, shame and humiliation filling him, but he can’t say anything. What could he possibly say to make the man let him fall? Oh. There is that.
From his pocket, he pulls out a crumpled letter, singed with Fiendfyre. He’s lucky he didn’t die in that place, for the letter would have been burned up there. Now, at least, his mother and father can know his final words.
(See the end of the chapter for
For the second time in his life, Theodore didn’t know what to do.
“Had you just fallen asleep?”
“Oh, another thing.” Harry looks a little sheepish, rubbing at the back of his neck. “When this year is over, do you… want to stay at Grimmauld Place? It’ll be a little crowded, with me, your mum, Sirius, Remus, you and sometimes Teddy, along with all of the house elves, but… it housed the entire Order of the Phoenix at one point, so…”
The argument from that lasts less than three hours. He sends a note after Harry, apologising and begging forgiveness. He doesn’t deserve it, but Harry returns with teary eyes and tight hugs, and they’re back to the hesitant relationship they’ve been cultivating. Not that everything is suddenly perfect. Harry’s magic sputters and spits while Draco’s explodes, and he’s not oblivious to the resentment in Harry’s eyes whenever he casts a spell. Hermione jokes that it’s Harry’s punishment for doing that stupid spell which started this mess. Draco thinks Harry secretly believes her.
The Dark Mark is gone, just like Draco wished for, but Harry didn’t think it would be anything like this.
Harry frowns at the thought, a little disturbed. It’s the same feeling he had when he learned his wand was Voldemort’s wand’s twin.
“Will we be able to play Quidditch?”
Enjoy!
“Well you’d better eat a lot at the feast tonight, I can’t bear to-” She cuts off, suddenly noticing his outfit. “Draco! What in Merlin’s name are you wearing? Is that...muggle…clothing?” Her nose wrinkles up, and she not-so-subtly shifts away from him, as though afraid it might stain her clothes.
He can’t.
Graduation consisted of three days in total.
“Anyway.” Harry catches their attention again. “This is it. Everyone know what they’re doing?”
So it isn’t just him who feels it. “Gobsy, what do you mean he needed help with everything? He can walk fine.”
Here he is, trapped in a school of people who despise him, and the only person he’s opened up to in years attacked him. It was only a prank. He was only trying to defend himself, because Merlin knows he needs to. All those bruises and cuts didn’t form by themselves.
Black is on his left side, snoring away in the tangle of blankets on his bed. He hadn’t managed to stay on his feet for long, considering the ecstatic welcome he’d received from Harry and his friends. Even Lupin had showed up mere minutes after the message had been sent to him, hugging and crying and laughing in a mad mix as Black had patted his back with an overwhelmed expression.
“...branch.”
Then he finishes the painting.
Gradually, the other three return to their conversation, and he rests his head on the table to block it all out. Pansy’s fingers run through his hair again, gentle, soothing him into the comforting illusion he’s at home, in bed, with his mother singing softly.
“Parkinson, Potter, Corner. Stay behind please.”
“The Unspeakables have been researching the Veil again.”
‘Levicorpus’
Four figures, cloaks abandoned, are tightly packed around something on the ground. Wait, no. Not something - someone. Two of them are laughing, spitting, yelling. The other two are mostly silent, throwing out the occasional insult, but they are pummelling the person curled up on the ground as though it’s Voldemort himself.
“You did kill him using expelliarmus. Like, not even some awesome powerful spell. You chose expelliarmus.”
Sirius tries grabbing his hand, eyes wide, and Draco clings back as though Sirius is his last lifeline. Which he is, Draco supposes. This thought makes him grip tighter, a whimper escaping his throat.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“In a hundred years time, they’re not gonna believe how much of an idiot you were, you know? Our grandkids are gonna think we were either lying about the spell you used, or just that we were complete idiots for praising you to the high heavens.”
“I’m sorry for being an asshole and saying you should have been given to him. Even if it turns out you’re a clabbert’s pustule and deserved it. I was being selfish and a bit of a bitch. See you!”
Perhaps he could own a little potions shop, with strange mixtures in jars like Snape had… Then again, he’d need customers. Customers who’d buy from an ex-Death Eater. Customer’s who’d buy legally from an ex-Death Eater. Unless he wanted to go into selling illegal potions, he’d go bankrupt in less than a month.
(I don’t want anything! Can’t you understand? I can’t eat it I can’t eat it I can’t I can’t because I’m wasting the food when Crabbe should have been here Crabbe should be the one eating and laughing with you but he can’t because he’s dead and it’s all my fault!!!)
(See the end of the chapter for
No! Draco wants to scream. No, because you and the rest of my family didn’t ever give a shit about me! I was branded, used, abused, and then thrown aside because none of you ever cared! Even my own father couldn’t protect me, wouldn’t protect me! Why can’t you see that?!
Her face crumples again. He was that worried about the pranks that he was refusing to even see them? Isolating himself because they would get hurt? If this proved anything, it was that Draco had changed, for the better.
They are approaching the seventh floor now, and Draco’s hands bunch tightly in his robes. The Room of Requirement is just around that corner, where that damn cabinet was, where the Fiendfyre licked at his heels, where Crabbe died.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry knocks lightly on the door, a tray of food in hand. He’d woken up earlier than usual, filled with nervous energy and excitement. Draco doesn’t have a Dark Mark. Draco will be happy! All because Harry had spent sleepless nights pouring over books, and had found a cure. Hermione will be so proud of him when she finds out!
Malfoy starts crying.
He strides across the room, ignoring the growing whispers, and stops in front of Nott. “Hey.”
The room is silent, entranced by the pure energy in his voice. A soft white glow outlines his body, slips from his tongue, winds around the room and brightens every expression in there.
“Something- There’s something there!” He bites out, teeth gritted and sweat dripping down his face.
“I thought you meant ‘exciting’.” Hermione shakes her head, one hand pressed to her temple. “This is giving me a headache.”
It resists slightly, confusion souring the cream and dragging out the coldness, a musty scent of moldy parchment stinging his hand. Blaise can feel his forehead dampening, the strain of battling with pure magic making him sweat.
“You’re so cruel.” Blaise sighs, turning back to a hopeful Harry and Theo. “Alright, alright. Of course I’m going to do it. He is my best ‘bro’, after all.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hermione ducks as the paper birds shoot over her head. “Looks like you’ve got that spell. Why don’t we take a break?”
He vanishes.
c) Not do much with Draco, just finish the Gakushuu one so another long Draco one can start soon after
Harry steps back, feeling as though he’d just been slapped. He hadn’t thought about that. Yes, he knew Draco had been attacked verbally and physically for it, but… Harry had thought if he was with Draco, he could protect him from it. He’d never considered that it might cause him harm too.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
The second day was a little better, even when they saw the article from the previous day. A small group of them had a bonfire for each newspaper in the morning, then headed down for the events of the day. Over the last few months, they had gathered together a portfolio of their work over their last year, and each of them had a small corner to display their work. Prospective employers wandered around, chatting to students who were hoping for last minute arrangements. Employers who’d already accepted students came to check over the work, assessing them for the job as well as taking in others’ work.
“Very well, Nott.” She smiles, face lined with a type of sad happiness. “I shall speak to the department. In the meantime, you should speak to your teachers, and Hagrid. I’m sure we can arrange for your own rooms in the castle, so you won’t have to traipse to the top floor and back down again every day.”
“Yes, I know, the spell went wrong. What does this have to do with anything?”
Draco laughs, the sound escaping him like a bubble popping in his pure joy and relief. Harry cuts himself off at that, mouth twitching upwards as Draco laughs, and stretching it into a huge grin as Draco nods furiously. Would he like to date Harry Potter, the Saviour, the Boy Who Lived Twice, the stupid scarhead who he’s been obsessed with since that dumb rejected handshake eight years ago.
He’s saved from Blaise’s retort by the arrival of food. As always, the Slytherin table consists of a healthy variety of food, unlike the calorie disaster that arrives on the Gryffindor table. All attention turns to salvaging a decently matched meal, apart from Theodore, who seems to absorb any food without a single consequence for his weight. He reminds him far too much of Crabbe and Goyle, except they steadily grew larger. Not any more. With one dead and another in Durmstrang, it’s hard to focus on eating.
Enjoy!
Anything to not focus on the mound of hacked out flesh, a pale, scarred snake tattoo winding through a skull, the blood around it creeping steadily towards Harry.
Draco wakes up alone. Everything hurts, despite the soft wrappings, and Draco prays that Poppy will return to give him something to stop it. The potion to help him sleep, preferably. Nothing can hurt when he’s asleep.
“Let’s go back to the common room, then. I’ll clean it up tomorrow.”
His father had turned into a twisted, desperate man. He’d grasped at broken beliefs, molded them until they could excuse what he did, and then dragged his family along into it. He’d dragged Draco, sixteen and naive, into murder. He can’t ever forgive him for that.
Ending might be a little rushed, since I had to wrap it up pretty quickly before going out, but hopefully it still works.
Michael's face turns the shade of a Salamander's tongue; that is to say, incredibly red. Unfortunately, with only a small number of them, sniggering is out of the question. Harry settles for covering his smirk.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It hadn’t been so bad, at first. McGonagall had looked disappointed, upset, making Harry sink in his seat, but her punishment had been light. Monitored magic use, along with the job of telling Narcissa her son is dead. Harry isn’t looking forward to it, yet he knows it could have been a lot worse. He has a feeling McGonagall didn’t want the Ministry involved. They can’t do anything to Harry without public protest.
He needs to calm Pansy down, but her back is almost completely turned to him. Speaking is the only option.
“Why did Blaise tell me I was fabulous?”
Scowling, he gets to his feet, earning an even wider grin from Blaise. They collect their trunks, and then, the moment of doom arrives. Inhaling a shuddering breath, Draco follows them out of the train.
Vote time!
(See the end of the chapter for
You can guess what this chapter will be about. It's been a long time coming, but... here we are. I've stuffed as much as I could into this, although I may have forgotten a few things which will be addressed in later chapters, so if anyone notices something that I've hinted in earlier chapters but never explained, please tell me!
Broomstick polish. Wet grass. The smells Draco hated, then fell in love with, then hated, and now… is falling in love with again. He should hate it, but it’s… nice.
No, it’s not ok. He hurt Theo… No, he’s Theodore, now. Or Nott. Draco doesn’t love him, he knows that, or else he wouldn’t have made him bleed. But neither does he hate him. Perhaps if they hadn’t kissed each other, then they might have become each other’s support to get through difficult times. Friends are always far better than lovers. Besides, attraction isn’t the same as love. Just because Theodore has a nice face and muscles doesn’t mean Draco loves him, not at all. They should’ve stayed friends. If he hadn’t accepted Theodore’s kiss, maybe he wouldn’t be feeling like this.
- If you wouldn't like to read this, read only up to the ~~~ at the end of Draco's section. I'll explain in the end notes what has happened in the other section.
A hand, clawing out the darkness even as Draco’s high scream fills the air, even as Harry slumps down beside him. He drags out more power, more energy, crushing the darkness in a fist, shattering it and banishing it completely. There. All gone.
“Yeah, ok, I’ll do that. Thank you, professor.” He nods enthusiastically, heading towards the group in the corner, how with Ginny.
Except he doesn’t. The second morning of his return to Hogwarts life, he comes into the common room to find Pansy, Hermione, and Blaise standing over a pile of burning letters. He doesn’t say anything. Neither do they. He’ll thank them, at some point, when the white smoke doesn’t constantly turn into rain when he feels emotional.
So, chapter 5. Enjoy!
The man’s eyes fly to him, a mixture of emotions whipping through them. He seems stunned, speechless, as he should be. Draco’s a monster. Draco kills and tortures and destroys lives. Maybe the werewolf is seeing that now.
Fuck.
Leaving his room. Draco digs his fingernails into his palms at the thought. He hadn’t been out for Merlin knows how long, and now Hermione is suggesting he leave just like that? As though it isn’t as hard for him as going up to McGonagall and punching her in the face.
Except he won’t die. He can do this. If some old wrinkly ancestor of his can do it, then surely he can save one measly soul.
The words give him an abrupt spike of determination, enough to make him open his mouth to try and choke out words. “I-” He starts, hope and excitement filling him at managing it, but then it comes crashing down as the air blocks up his throat.
Enjoy!
“Shh...It’s alright, Draco…” His voice is soft, too soft and caring for the boy Draco has become, and the sobs only wrack his body harder. No one has been that gentle with him since… since… he doesn’t know. It’s all too much, all at once, and when his father eventually finds them, he’s relieved. Mask back on. Tears wiped away. A sharp look threatening the werewolf to never, ever, mention this to anyone.
“Draco?” Luna drifts to stand next to his bed, spiralling gold earrings clinking with the movement. “Are you going to open yours?”
“Sickness?” Harry stares at her, remembering Gobsy’s wobbling speech. “What do you mean?”
It’s hours later, when everyone else is sleeping, that Harry firecalls Remus again.
‘Art therapy’ is what Hermione’s calling it, when she and Pansy visit. Together, they’ve begun campaigning for magical therapists, dubbed ‘Mind Healers’ in the newspapers they’ve contacted. So far, the movement has gained a lot of support, thanks to her popularity and the increasing need for such a thing. Luna is training to be their test subject, using the Ministry to jump in and out of various psychology lectures, gathering information on as much as she can. Every time she drops in, her random facts are more aimed at helping him and Sirius improve, rather than her usual comments about plants or creatures. Draco finds himself examining every negative thought now, correcting every flaw in it so he doesn’t spiral down into a whirlwind of self hate.
“Hey, Luna.”
Instead, he pushes to his feet and runs away from Black, praying that Limbo really is endless and Black won’t ever find him again. The man calls out after him, but he keeps running, his floating body never getting tired. Eventually, Black’s voice fades away, but he keeps running and running, wishing he could run into the abyss and not have to feel anything anymore. It seems that even in death he can’t be free of the thunderstorm in his head.
I'm so sorry... I hope you can understand.
Pansy watches them leave, giggling together, and shakes her head. She’d never thought Luna and Ginny… but something must have happened. Luna isn’t easy to get to know.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Master Draco, yes, yes. Poked Jaebo awake, he did. Nasty wand poking Jaebo.” Jaebo grumbles, rubbing his side.
Nott is silent for a while, brown eyes staring at Harry blankly. “How?”
“I’ll kill them. I will.” Theo’s face darkens, grabbing Draco’s hand and holding it tightly. “No one hurts you without feeling the consequences. They already took everything from us, why do they need to hurt us too?!” He drops the hand, standing and starting to pace furiously. “It was a stupid prank, smashing up their precious little house points, there’s no reason to fucking attack one of us! Those Gryffindors had it coming. They’ve been torturing us the second we got here, and the professors have done nothing! Why is it so wrong to take it into our hands?”
Black sighs. “Damn cowards. Draco, is it?”
McGonagall. Why would she do that? There's no way they're going to survive a whole year without killing each other now, even with that Michael person in the room. Perhaps the stress of becoming Headmistress has finally made her snap.
‘It’s fine. We can go up.’
When Pansy broke his nose, he was almost glad. She hadn’t said anything, just marched up to him in the middle of a group of gushing fifth years and punched him. They’d all descended on her, of course, but her and Blaise cast enough hexes and jinxes between them that the entire group of them ended up in the hospital wing.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“That’s great!” Harry claps him on the back, his own stomach sinking. The Auror hadn’t asked him for his grades, just offered him a position with minimum training. He’d turned it down. He’s done with fighting, especially if he’s not going to use magic for a while.
“Hey! I think I see something!” Harry gasps.
Time to stop rambling. Enjoy!
Oh no! I'm sorry, I didn't realise deleting the chapter would delete all your comments... I still remember them, though, thank you.
“Narcissa.” He pauses, words clogging up his throat. They don’t seem to want to leave, and he thinks he finally understands why Draco could never force words out. “Narcissa, there’s something I have to tell you.”
See. It’s true.
He shakes his head, snorting. Competition? Please. The only competition for attractive, smart boy is Blaise, who’s already won by the state of Draco’s entire being. No girl is attracted to a black mess on the floor.
Three to one.
This doesn't mean I can't continue writing this! I will still find time when I can, so you will get updates, they just won't be predictable or regular in any way.
Draco groans inwardly. First day, and they’re already in a fight. Blaise can’t calm Pansy, not when she’s like this, and soon they’ll be kicked out of Hogwarts into Azkaban for attacking the Noble Golden Boy.
“Theo, he can do that, right?” Harry turns to the anxious boy, his chest sparking in anticipation. “We can get them both out at the same time, and then we can all live in Grimmauld Place when we’re done.”
Shake.
Macmillan, Ernie
Strangely, Jaebo must have absorbed some of Draco’s artistry when he was created, as he constantly advises him on what colours to use or which brush stroke to make next. It’s soothing, in a way, to get lost in the colours and delicate flicks of painting. Not long after he started, a vague shape of a face can be made out, pale skin against a dark green background. He doesn’t know how to control his sudden ability, so he’s decided to at least paint someone useful.
This time, I'm leaving all my notes at the end.
- E.D.
But that was Malfoy’s problem. If Malfoy had done it differently, then things would have changed. Harry hadn’t known at the time, so it wasn’t his fault.
All of your pets sound adorable! A lot of cats, which I strongly approve of. As always, questions or ideas or just random babblings are forever appreciated.
“Draco?”
“I know the feeling. Becoming Mrs Malfoy was a little bizarre for me, after so long as ‘the youngest Miss Black’.” She picks up the cup again, fingers rubbing against the handle like it is a talisman. “Although now I suppose I shall become ‘the widow, Mrs Malfoy’. How things change.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I suppose we have opposing views, then.” Theo whispers, cheeks flushing. “I’m sorry. I won’t bother you again. Goodbye, Draco.”
Pity! The damn Death Eater (Ex Death Eater, whatever) is a fucking coward. He only got what he deserved, and it's not like he's in Azkaban! He's in Hogwarts, with both of his parents alive, and a ginormous Manor to top it all off! Pity. Pity is only for those who need it.
“Harry doesn’t have-”
Not Blaise. Not Michael. Not the weasel. Not any of the teachers. Not Loo-...
Again, any ideas you have for future chapters (or even ideas for one-shots, I'm thinking about writing more of those), please put them in the comments. Thank you!
Yes, Theodore has apologised, and Draco can’t hate him, not really. Yes, a part of him still loves those broad shoulders and that caring personality. Perhaps some of his heart is still yearning to be wrapped up in those arms and just forget about everything, if only for a moment. But…
“Don’t!” Theo growls.
Easy for you to say! You were always- always better at controlling everything. It all went your way!
“Idiot.” Remus sighs fondly. “You love motorcycles and pranks. I don’t know what you’re complaining about. Besides, you should open it and start reading if you’re going to make a judgement on it.”
“Not then, sir. Too much lying in bed. Gobsy stayed to help young master Draco and mistress. Don’t know what they’d do without Gobsy, sir. Gobsy stays because young master Draco was always a little weak, sir, always ill and in bed. Snakey man never good, infected poor manor, and young master Draco always caught everyone’s illnesses. Young master Draco infected, Gobsy thinks.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is it?” He stares down at Draco’s chest, then back up at his face. “I don’t see anything.”
And yes, maybe his future self will be cursing him to the high heavens, but he had to do it, and he doesn’t regret it one bit right now, even when they both fall to the floor in a mess of exhausted limbs, giggling madly.
It’s frustrating. He hides the visits, saying he’s going to study in the library, and ends up having to do exactly that when Malfoy turns his back. Time and time again, he avoids Parkinson’s suspicious glares, Ron's hurt eyes, and Nott’s bitter resentment. All for him to say some small thing and be met with petulant anger.
Can you guess who did it???
The woman who had lived through a war, watched her students die, accepted the post of Hogwarts Headmistress, and been Harry's head of house (that one was probably the most exhausting), rubs her eyes as though Parkinson's refusal is the most wearisome thing she's experienced.
“Harry? Are you o- FUCK!” Hermione stumbles back, turning and hurling onto the floor beside him.
“Yep!” Ron grins. “The guy from yesterday said they’ll let me in even with lower grades than normal. What with the stuff from last year, and all. Apparently helping destroy Voldemort is better than getting Exceeds Expectations in Potions.”
Slowly, he writes DECEASED next to the name and carries on, hazily registering each DECEASED, each name passing by, until-
“I had no idea you-”
Instead, it’s Theo who comes first. He runs in, bag swinging wildly from his shoulder, and drops into a chair beside Draco. His stony face breaks the second he knows no one is watching, worry and fear in his eyes. “I heard rumours but I didn’t think they’d actually have- I’m so sorry, Dragon! Who did it?!”
‘I wish that I didn’t have the Dark Mark.’
Fuck.
Harry's POV this time.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Vincent Crabbe.
Then it’s Draco’s turn. He swallows, fingers shaking as he grips the bottom of the lectern, reading over the words on the page. This is it. This is what he’s been working towards for the past few months. He clears his throat, opens his mouth-
Harry makes a face, and Nott snorts with laughter, as though he and Harry have been bosom buddies all this time. For the moment, Harry lets it go. After what Nott has just done for him, he doesn’t think he has the right to start giving the boy the cold shoulder. Besides, Nott is working for Hagrid now, so he can’t be as bad as Harry had thought.
He can’t do this. Merlin, he can’t open it and find out that he’s too late, or never had a chance at all. The forehead kiss was for the damn spell, it didn’t mean anything, and he kissed Harry in front of all of these people, all of his friends, when Harry didn’t want to be kissed.
“Wait- Draco’s in Limbo? How-”
“Praising me to the high heavens? I’d rather you do that, please.”
No, Theo was right. Magic only made everything worse with Draco. He should have kept far away.
“Two times this month.” The portrait behind her whispers, and she repeats it to Pansy, who suddenly looks gobsmacked.
“Oh really?” This time the High and Mighty Lord of Lions steps in. “That’s not what Parkinson’s wand is telling us.”
And chokes.
Right. The spell. Blaise dips deeper into the ocean of might, winding it around the bubble as he starts reciting the words. He can see it now, with his eyes open, the wave of pure liquid magic streaming from him. It’s beautiful. It feels incredible. His soul is suspended in a galaxy of sparkling magic, and he never wants to come down. He can do anything with it.
Should this be only these three doing all the work together, or should they set up a group of them to work together on this? And if you think the second, who should be in it?
With that, the man disapparates, leaving Harry reeling. Dead? Lucius? Surely he misheard. It would be wrong for both Draco and his father to die at the same time. It’s too much of a coincidence to be real.
“Thank Merlin.” Theo mutters. “I don’t have that kind of money.”
- E.D.
She means that he is hiding with the only people who won’t punch him, of course. Knowing her, she’ll adopt him as her new pet to protect, and Draco can’t help but want to demand Nott leave and never return. Instead, he shrugs noncommittally, and sits. Instantly, Pansy pulls his head down to rest on her lap, where it stays for the remainder of the trip.
- E.D.
- E.D.
It’s more of a shudder than a tingle this time. He cracks open his eyes, and registers he’s standing in the common room. It’s about the same size as the slytherin common room, yet lacks the cold, regal manner, instead opting for being cozy. There are a few chairs mimicking the stately style, however their grandness is diminished by the overstuffed sofas surrounding them.
“It’s amazing, Harry.” Black closes the book, eyes wide. “Honestly, you could make a business selling books like this.”
His blonde curls bob up and down as he nods triumphantly, a small smile gracing his lips. Pansy shoves aside the pile of paper and claps her hands together, a determined expression on her face. “Forget all of this stuff. Granger, Draco, we have more important work to do!”
Hermione yells, starts ordering people to move, pulling Pansy away from- pulling at her and at Harry’s arm, telling him to not look at- telling him to move away from-
He opens the door, fire filling his lungs, breathing life into his corpse. He can’t let him get away with this. Potter doesn’t deserve to live happily ever after, not after everything he’s done. Especially not with that letter, and especially not after the attack earlier in the year.
Draco nods again. Why would Harry not be happy? He’s the Saviour, the Blessed Baby, the Boy Who Lived Twice. The stupid scarface who has been riding a broomstick of success from the minute he survived Volde- the Dark Lord’s killing curse.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“One.”
He can feel the wispy strands of sleep creeping up on him, coating his mind in a fuzzy haze. His father’s hand on his hand slows, silence drifting over them for a few seconds, letting Draco slip further into the comfortable darkness.
“It’s been a difficult few years for each of us.” Harry starts the speech, squeezing Draco’s hand, then drops his voice to a whisper in Draco’s ear. “Just say it with me, ok? Just like we practised.”
Instead of risking telling them himself, he leads them to the board. There are two staircases leading downwards, originally meant for a gender split. Now, they just lead to the same corridor. Harry wonders whether this place has been used as dormitories before, since Hogwarts rarely changes its skin for new purposes.
He tilts his head slightly, raising an eyebrow, and it’s the most expression he’s done in a week.
He watches the red liquid drip to the floor in horror, the red haze draining away to leave a hollow fear.
“Look at me, spilling my heart out to the Boy Who Lived Twice.” Nott smirks, slipping into the seat opposite. “If I’m giving you some blackmail material, you may as well give me yours. I can’t exactly hold a panic attack over you without feeling dirty. Come on. Spill, Saviour.”
For now, they sit in silence, both leaning against a column. He doesn’t know how long he’s been here - the light never changes from bright white, and his body feels like it’s floating. Does time even exist in Limbo? He isn’t sure.
Any requests, please leave in comments section.
Harry glares at the ferret's bleached halo of hair, shooting as many violent thoughts towards him as he could until he peeks up again.
Draco keeps his eyes down, tugging his beanie to cover more. Pansy joins Blaise in glaring, imperious, evidently hoping fear will make the students leave them alone. Theodore stares straight ahead, as though oblivious. The only sign that he's noticed is his clenched jaw and fist.
That was far too easy. He didn’t pose Harry anything resembling a challenge, and Malfoy never backs down from a challenge. Never. Especially against Harry. So Harry scowls at him, watching him for hours from the corner of his eye, waiting for him to do anything else suspicious.
He caught her soft look, unfortunately, and shook his hand, gesturing at the paper as though to say ‘Stop moping, Granger, we’ve work to do’.
“Nothing!” He winces. If Remus knew he wanted to fix Draco’s self-loathing with magic, he would probably assign Harry to a ward in Saint Mungos. “It’s a research project. Since we have so much time now, without trying to kill Voldemort.”
He shudders, stuttering breaths trying desperately to follow the steady noise of the figure beside him. In. Out. He needs to breathe. Slower, gentler, until the world comes into focus. The hand reaches out hesitantly, so he grabs onto it, feeling the firm skin beneath him like an anchor to reality.
Parkinson and Zabini glare at each other, challenging the other to speak up first, while Nott's face is stoic. Harry snorts inwardly at their perfect sense of Slytherin preservation - to challenge McGonagall would be either very brave or very stupid indeed. His eyes rest on a mass of fluffed blonde, which has replaced Malfoy’s face. Harry's amused expression morphs into annoyance. He's not even paying attention, head resting on the table again.
Therefore, 'The Tip of a Wand' and 'Stuck In Limbo' were the wrong way around.
- E.D.
Perhaps he should do as she asks, though, for now. With a wave of his hand, the magic sinks into the two people and they fall to the ground.
Harry sighs, turning away and trudging towards the lake. All he wants right now is to sleep, but he can’t bear the thought of walking inside his room. Too many reminders of draco lie around every part of the castle, even by the lake, but at least he won’t be disturbed there. In late december, not many students will be around outside to ogle him.
- E.D.
Parkinson’s whine carries across the room as she sidles over to Blaise. The four of them watch her, and Harry can’t help noticing the frustrated twist on her mouth. She’s come from the dormitories, which means she was trying to talk to Malfoy again. This is the third time today.
Enjoy!
“My son.” She says, voice barely more than a whisper. “You came with news about my boy. Harry, please… please tell me without any twisted words. I want to be clear what has happened. Since he is not here himself, I’m afraid I’m starting to imagine the worst.”
So he gets rid of it.
ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS
“I lo- I lov- I l- I-”
Fuck.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
This is why I envy people at Hogwarts, cause yes they did go through a war, but they only had to learn how to do cool spells and potions! I would kill to be able to say a word and make someone puke slugs.
Nott doesn’t respond as Harry stands, sorts out his clothes, and walks to the door. Just as he’s about to leave, he finally speaks up.
Draco opens his mouth a fraction, to retort or apologise, he has no idea, but his voice snags. Lowering his head, he snatches his trunk from the floor and climbs into the train, all too aware of the whispers caused by their confrontation. They only continue down the train, faces glaring at him from inside the compartments, until he finally finds an empty one and collapses in it, sealing the door with an anti-alohomora locking charm and conjuring a curtain over the window. Silence. Breathing out a long sigh, he rests his head back and closes his eyes, praying for a restful journey. Unfortunately, life has other plans. Only a few minutes into the train ride, sharp rapping yanks him from his stupor.
PLEASE READ
Except… sixth year. In Myrtle’s bathroom, he’d almost killed him, right after seeing him break down. He could’ve cast a different spell, or not cast a spell at all. In hindsight, he knows Draco’s cruciatus wouldn’t have worked. Harry could have let it hit him, and tried to talk Malfoy out of it. Perhaps then the cabinet wouldn’t have been fixed, and Dumbledore wouldn’t be dead, and none of it would have happened.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Even so, I’m really grateful you decided to try.” He holds out his hand, which she shakes. “Have you told Neville yet?”
“Good.” Lupin nods, watching the liquid swirl as he moves his cup. “Busy. How about you?”
Looking betrayed, Ron glances to Harry. “Mate?”
Both girls turn to glare at him, and he holds his hands up defensively. ‘Didn’t say it was wrong for them to want to be free. They’re just scared.’
After they’d accidentally transformed a curtain into a snake which rampaged the area for a day or so, Poppy refused to let them practice much without supervision. Therefore, Sirius mainly stuck to his books and chatting, and Draco focused on his painting.
Maybe he’s trying to make them pity him, so he won’t be attacked. But… there was the train incident. Ron had brushed it off, saying the ferret had finally realised he was lower than them. Hermione… had gone strangely silent, staring after him with a thoughtful frown.
“Ask Potter, professor. He’s the one who’s been sneaking in there every day without telling anyone.” Parkinson sneers, fingernails tapping against the desk.
- E.D.
Dun... dun... duuuunnnnnnn!
Pansy gasps. “What? Why?!”
As always, any ideas for future chapters or other fanfics, I'd love for you to put them in the comments section.
Harry gags, frozen in place, unable to rip his eyes away from the massive chunk of skin hacked out, the blood and muscles and bone merging into a huge bloody mess. His wand, that stupid wand that Harry had kept for so long, lies in splinters on the ground. He can see a unicorn hair poking out, silvery and white, so different from the stained shard of mirror lying next to it.
“Hey, hey, calm down.” Black stops moving, holding his hands out as though he’s taming a wild animal. “It’s ok, I’m not going to hurt you. Even if I wanted to, which I don’t, I couldn’t hurt you in here. Do you know where you are?”
She appears similarly confused. "I don't know. I suppose it's just Luna being Luna." Satisfied with her conclusion, she frowns at the food hanging in his hand. "Ignore her, and eat that bread. You look like you're trying to sneak it out!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“What’s wrong, ferret? You look like you’ve just been dragged through a hedge backwards.” He snarls.
I'm dying... my cold is killing me...
Pull. Pull. Pull.
Draco feels a panicked clenching in his stomach as he tries again. This doesn’t make sense. A lucid dream usually lets him do what he wants, even if he’s being followed by Vold- the Dark Lord. Magic is always there, just like it is in life, because a world without magic is unimaginable. Black is getting closer now, wariness tensing his muscles, so Draco opens his mouth. If the dream won’t let him use magic, it could at least let him speak.
“That’s fine. Thanks, Harry.” She smiles at him, tucking the money away into the donation box. “Hopefully some people will start listening if they hear you’ve donated.”
“I hope you are all aware of how utterly atrocious this is. The war is over. I’m not asking you to forget those you lost, only that you do not ever think it is alright to attack another innocent person who almost certainly had nothing to do with their deaths. Revenge is never the best path.”
Oof, that's been far too long of a break. Still! New chapter, new mysteries (kinda), and new relationships blossoming! I always hated that S.P.E.W. was never mentioned in the films, so I'm bringing it in here, because why not.
Enough is enough. Pansy needs to find out what’s going on, both with Blaise and with Draco. Who would know?
Bones, Susan
“I’m not really into fashion, I doubt I’ll think of anything good.” Harry shrugs.
Draco stares at him. Blaise drops his gaze, uncomfortable, and stands. “I’d better get changed. We’ll be arriving soon.”
But then the party had ended, and the next day was the same as ever. Harry had become better at avoiding bad subjects, so Draco no longer refused to look at him when he opened his mouth. Yet the next day he’d acted exhausted, as though the party had taken every ounce of strength he’d recovered.
“Catch me.”
“Be careful, Harry Potter!” The man seems to get over his initial shock, pulling out his wand and readying it. “I doubt she’ll be so friendly now that her husband’s dead.”
~~~Edit~~~
“Right.” Harry nods, a puff of air escaping his lips.
His skin starts to prickle. Perhaps he should drop the potion, pretend it was an accident. Let his mind twist up in itself and maybe they’ll put him down, out of mercy.
“We’ve overcome challenges no other year groups have ever had to do.” Harry continues.
Draco watches hazily as Blaise drops like a stone into Pansy’s arms, the brilliant light gone from his eyes and hands. He isn’t dead. His arm and head ache like hell, but he isn’t dead. He isn’t dead!
As always, any new ideas or suggestions for future chapters are much appreciated! (I'm publishing as soon as I finish writing every chapter, and I have little planning, so anything you want to see in here probably will appear if you comment it.)
Fuck.
Hermione rolls her eyes exasperatedly from the other side of Ron, opposite Harry, evidently struggling to hold in the protest that nargles don’t exist.
As ever, anything you would like to say, be it questions, ideas, or just random thoughts, please leave in the comments! I love reading what you think of the chapters.
Blaise tenses, nose sticking in the air defensively. “Nonsense. That brat should be left to fend for himself.”
Oh. She’s jealous.
This needs to stop. No matter what Remus said, Malfoy needs to know that Harry doesn’t hate him, and so does the rest of the school. Harry has to talk to him.
Theo pauses, anger melting into the face of a dog caught stealing food. “I... You’ve seen how they’ve been treating us! It isn’t right! I can’t just sit there and take it, that isn’t fair, that isn’t what a Slytherin should do. We fight back.”
If you could only cast one spell from the wizarding world, what would it be?
Weasley, Ron
“I suppose that’s fair, she did give you that broken nose. Bye, Harry.”
Draco’s dead. His mother, with her sallow cheeks and red-rimmed eyes, has to carry the consequences of Harry's stupidity. He can’t do this, can’t lay the burden of more death onto her already heavy shoulders.
When he wakes up, the hospital ward is quiet. His body aches with the foreign magic running through him, the smell of wet grass and broomstick polish intermingling with Blaise’s scent of fine wine and honey. He won’t be able to shake it off. It’s part of him now, as deeply cut into his body as the dark mark had been.
His father loves him, and Draco has always loved his father, even now. He can at least allow him this moment of peace in his death.
Enjoy!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Narcissa, Draco is-” Again, the words stick, choking him as his throat tightens with guilt. He can’t do this. He just can’t. “I’m sorry, do you have a bathroom I could use?”
“Alright, I think that’s enough. Any more questions can be addressed to your head of house. For now, Filch will lead you to your dormitory.”
Fuck.
1. Should Sirius and Remus still be alive?
“However,” Lucius continues, “they won’t be counting on your agility and your smarts. You will study hard, Draco, and you’ll think more about what you do. When you’re older, you won’t break your arm going that high. But it will take time and hard work. You will be the best, so you need to think about what you do. You can’t do silly things like fly higher than you’re supposed to.”
“I love you, my sweet child, I’ve always loved you and been so proud of you! I never meant to hurt you like this. I’m so sorry!”
Rolling his eyes at how stupid this is, he crouches until his feet are covered, and waddles across the room. Merlin, why is he cursed like this? As if the war wasn’t bad enough, he now has to waddle across the castle to help an ex-Death Eater who doesn’t even like him.
Would you like a more spaced out layout?
Draco slams the bathroom door behind him, anger and humiliation still coursing hotly through his veins. Why had they even come back? With their oh-so-holy reputations, all three of them should have been accepted anywhere without having any knowledge. Unlike certain other people.
Question time!
Hermione and Ron are curled up together on a loveseat, closest to the fire, while Neville is sitting on a beanbag. Apparently, he has one at home.
He looks up sharply, meeting her concerned gaze. “What?”
Two days later, and Narcissa stands outside of Grimmauld Place, Gobsy and her house elves separating her and the three Aurors they sent to escort her. As if she needs it. Most days she feels too tired to walk, let alone try to escape the country.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Want to practice?” He asks Draco, who nods nervously, fingers tight around his. “Ok, we can find an empty room. You have nothing to worry about, I’ll be here the entire time, and you can do it whenever you want.”
“Harry.”
The tears that sting his eyes from that statement are perfectly justified. Not too long ago, he was dead and thought only his mother would do more than simply shrug at it. Now, Harry bloody Potter is hugging him and saying he would do anything for him.
He gestures to his chest, letting out a choked gasp as the tug becomes a yank.
“What happened to your cheek?”
“Hey, Granger.”
“Yes, father.” Draco mumbles.
“Draco.”
“I want to show you something.” Harry stands, holding out a hand. “Although you might want to take the blankets, we’re going outside.”
“Ok, everyone ready?” Hermione calls.
For me, it'd definitely have to be 'Halo' by Zizou Corder. This book has been my favourite for years, and a huge inspiration towards my love of the Ancient Greeks and Romans. It may not be that impressive as I get older, but the way it manages to combine so many of my favourite ideas in books will always make it special in my eyes.
“So, uhm, Ginny, what are yours and Luna’s plans again?” Harry quickly changes the subject, even though he already knows exactly what they’re going to do after this year.
“Use mine. Blaise, now!” Harry mutters beside him, hand tightening on his wrist.
“What music?” She shrugs, blocking the hole in the wall. A burst of laughter comes through, despite the enchantments. “I don’t hear anything. Maybe you should go to Pomfrey, hallucinations aren’t a good sign.”
“I’m picking you up now.”
The battle is over. Draco saw the Dark Lord die, with his own eyes, and a sense of calmness washes over him as he thinks back. It’s fine, now, to leave them. No one will miss him anymore, being such a disappointment, such a waste of space. In all the panic and desperate reunions, no one will care that a Death Eater is gone.
Remus shakes his head, dropping into an armchair. They’d all congregated in the eighth year common room, the rest of their year group migrating to their rooms so they can have some peace. Remus and McGonagall are in the process of madly trying to convince the ministry to not let the newspapers grab hold of the story whilst also trying to agree how best to handle the situation with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. All in all, it's been a hectic night.
They slip into the silence again until Black speaks up. His voice is little more than a mutter, rambling to himself rather than actually addressing Draco.
The ringing begins in his ears then. It stabs through his head, right to the centre of his brain, drilling into his thoughts until he clamps his hands over his ears to try and shut it all out. But it’s too late. The name bounces around his brain, in whispers and in shouts and in screams, in the hiss of the man himself and in the choked begging of his own voice.
They step back, hands up, utter confusion on their face. “I’m s-sorry?”
At the start of the year, he was little more than a ghost. Now, he is living, properly living, and has people there to catch him if he falls again.
“But the aesthetic!” Blaise groans, gesturing at his own heeled shoes. “Pansy agrees with me. Plus, you’d be so much more intimidating. I don’t mean to offend, weaselbee, but at your height, no one will take you seriously when you go to arrest them.”
Perhaps he’d misunderstood it all. Malfoy is a Malfoy, after all. As Ron said, Malfoy was a dick from day one. He isn’t going to change, even if he is little more than a ghost.
“Well, it’s more of a question.” He settles down closer to the fire, knees curled up to his chest. “Are there any spells that fix people’s heads? Like how obliviate makes people forget things, but I don’t want him to forget it, I just want him to see it differently.”
b) Begin a new story centred on Draco (if you prefer this, I would love some new ideas if you have them)
Would you prefer a more spaced out layout? For example, I would split the paragraphs up more, and leave larger gaps between sections.
Pansy can’t help but feel hurt. She’s been at that door every hour she can over the past two days, trying to convince him to just speak to her (metaphorically, of course, considering his worrying muteness), and yet the second Potter asks to come in, Draco lets him. Has he been drugged, again? Or under a spell; the Imperius? She wouldn’t put it past him.
It's not often I'll do this, but I think I'll start recommending writers or specific fanfictions to you. (I really just need something to do or write about, and I've seen other people do it, so I thought, why not?)
“Wait! Malfoy!” Potter scowls after him, but he doesn’t see, he doesn’t see because he’s definitely not looking, he’s not looking except he is, and he’s stopped, and now he can’t pretend he’s just a stranger because those stupid green eyes are glaring at him.
Theo visits. He brings a glowing white flower with him, setting it by his bedside table and leaving a small jug of water with it. They don’t talk. After half an hour, he leaves again, tending to the grounds and the creatures lurking in the forest. Draco’s glad he’s found something to dedicate himself to, other than killing and torturing innocent people. He has to remind himself that he and Theo were similar, once, and then he spends the rest of the next two days thinking about every gentle touch they shared. It hurts, especially when Harry comes and tries taking his hand.
Jarfin Kindlewald. DECEASED.
Dazed, Harry returns to Ron.
Why are they confused? They shouldn’t be confused. All the other Slytherins have run away from him or yelled something about unfairness. Harry lowers his wand, racing mind calming enough to see the red trimming of their jumper. It’s a Gryffindor, not a Slytherin. A Gryffindor, beating another person up. A group of Gryffindors, beating up a defenseless…
“I have enough! I have enough, I swear! Blaise!”
“I am feeling quite alright.” She reassures him, and for once, it edges on the truth. If she ignores the crushing despair of losing her son, and the black hole in her heart at losing her husband, and the crawling loneliness of only having house elves for company, she does feel lighter.
He was wrong. Today can get a whole lot worse.
Draco is on his back, staring blankly at the ceiling. The blankets have been shoved out of the way of his body, arms hanging loose over the sides of the bed, the left one… dripping…
Draco nods tightly at the ginger, feeling his pulse rocket. The noise in the room dims a little as everyone turns to stare. A Malfoy with a muggleborn. He supposes it’s a rare sight to see.
‘Nothing.’ He spells, and takes the wand. There’s a tense moment where he fears his doubts were true, but then a rush of magic shudders down his spine and he senses the wand welcoming him as an old friend.
