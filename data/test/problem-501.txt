Draco then smiled, Harry didn’t like that look one bit, he looked at Harry through his red eyes and said, “i must have forgotten to mention but I’ll make sure Regulus stays with me. What with you being unable to even remember him. I’m sure I would have no problem at all. And don’t even try otherwise. Consequences would be deadly.” Harry shivered at the words but still, didn’t understand who Regulus was. The only Regulus he knew was Sirius’s brother and he was long dead.
“and who would you be to comand me that?” harry challenged, like seriously what right did the poncy git have?
Harry was dressing when he left him in the room, he casts a tempus charm just outside the door. It’s almost noon, Salazar knew why Harry didn’t even bat an eyelid at his late morning.
“You are nothing what they tell about you. You hear me. All your life, you had followed what was told. What kept up your image, what people thought. You’re free now, you get me? You, Draco Malfoy, are
“Ah yes, why are you here? and where?” Dad says with amusement, then answers himself, “Well answer’s quite simple. You’re in the connected mindspace of both of you. That’s why you’re together. And you’re here because Death wanted a glimpse of their masters and we wanted to meet both of you.”
Contrary to what people might say or think, it’s not Draco who wants to follow all traditions. Merlin knows he has had enough of those in his entire life. But Harry is hell bent on following each and every one of them and well, it’s not like Draco could ever say no to that fucker. And maybe, he likes them just a teeny tiny bit but no one is ever going to know that.
Draco smiles fondly at him and places a light kiss on his lips before snuggling up. Harry hugs him tightly as he remembers the day it all started. He is grateful to himself for not using Sectumsepra even though it was on the tip of his tongue that day almost two years ago.
“Could either of you just call him? He is my Healer so he must be here, right?” He asks hopefully, something in their eyes tells him that he is very very wrong. They are excused from answering him when Zia enters. She is an assistant to Draco and under his wing, one of his best students.
as far as harry was concerned, he had last played in hogwarts, although he did still participate in some of the impromptu Weasley weekly sunday matches but he doesn’t think Draco knew about that. harry’s words seemed to stop malfoy in his tracks. he frowned at harry, then he stared into his eyes for a long time before harry looked away.
Draco snickers and Harry can’t help but join in as he thinks about the look on everyone’s faces. But first he needs to tell his friends.
It’s not until Harry has had his third orgasm in a row before Draco finishes at last. It had been intense and had made his mind blank out of everything but Harry. But now the guilt slowly makes it way back in, and he can’t breath.
“Agender and asexual.” Luna declares next and this is someone all of them knew since Luna was the only one to officially come out to everyone of them.
“Can I have some more cookies?” Teddy asks through a yawn. It’s almost 9 o'clock, but they hadn’t been able to put him to sleep still.
” Harry makes a poor impression of Sirius and smiles as he thinks the scene which is hopefully happening in some other world.
“Yes, you can visit. Just for a couple of minutes, not more. Just reach inside yourself and you’ll know how to.” Dad says and smiles at him and he grins back at the idea that maybe being The Master Of Death isn’t so bad, if he actually gets to visit his parents.
Something clicks inside Draco as he stares at Harry for long moments, then he asks quietly, “What right do I have to…to make them see-” He wrecks into more sobs that make Harry’s heart clench.
“But I don’t wanna sleep! I don’t see you more, I want to be with you!” Teddy exclaims and Harry and Draco share a look.
After he finishes the second story, he looks down beside him to find Reg fast asleep, he slowly and carefully gets out of his bed and tucks him in properly then starts towards the door.
“I’m proud of you then,” Draco replies and there’s something in his voice that halts Harry for a second.
Slowly, he thinks of pulling away even if he can’t bring himself to actually achieve that. It’s Draco who makes the first move, he always does in these situations. Draco might break first, literally and metamorphically, but he never shows it outside. Not when they are out, and he is vulnerable to the world.
“okay so it’s 2011 and I have somehow forgotten ten years of my life. So what’s up with me right now then? Senior Auror? Please don’t tell me I went for Minister!” Harry tried to joke, it wouldn’t do good to panic now afterall. “and however did I end up here? Malfoy mentioned something of a game?”
“Hermione reads to know stuff, whether muggle or magical. I read for fun. There’s a difference there. My stories are fiction, hers are of law and Magical theory.”
“Yeah. Where’s Draco?” he asks directly, she will probably give him a viable answer, but she looks distinctly uncomfortable so he feels the need to clarify, “You know, your boss, my husband and my healer?”
“I needed to claim all the Malfoy estates because Dad reckons he hasn’t got long and well I was tired of that particular argument.”
son.” malfoy closed his eyes and took a deep breath, “and don’t even try contacting him by anymeans before- no even after you have gained your memory back. Because trust me it will, and it won’t be pretty. I don’t want my child to go through anything that would cause him trauma, and trust me when your own dad can’t remember you, that’s going to fuck up anyone’s mind real bad, especially for a one and half year old.” Malfoy spat out.
“Draco…” Harry gasps, and his eyes widen. Maybe this was a bad idea, well it’s too late now anyways.
Nothing to think over or anything. So what they were just fuck buddies? Fuck buddies can provide support in extreme cases and yeah, that’s it. He should get up and see what’s Harry making. Maybe he would get some? He stayed the night, Harry should offer breakfast and be gracious and all that.
“I’m so sorry to throw this upon you both. I know how busy you both are,” she says as she gets up from where she had been kneeling infront of Teddy.
“Alright, both of you. Stop laughing at my expense. I know the irony of the situation.” Ron says at last.
“Talk to me, dammit! Shout at me, scream, tell, punch, hex whatever you want to. Just- just don’t keep so quiet, it’s so much more hurting than the others, please Draco.” he snaps after almost two minutes of complete silence.
“It’s fine, love. Don’t get worked up. We did infact, vow to share everything. I consider this my honour.” Draco squeezes his hand lightly and really, what did he do to deserve this thoughtful and wonderful husband, again?
“Thank you. I need to get going now. Goodbye.” Draco says, his parents murmur their byes and he apparates directly to Grimmauld Place.
“Why, Daddy? I’m just getting ready for the party.” Harry tells him and again gives him a sweet smile.
“It’s just that…the press, they will be out for blood and you know what type of stories they will be printing when they-” he stops abruptly because maybe the words won’t be perceived in the way he wants them to.
“No, you don’t need to look at me that way, you git. I know it was my idea to come out and I’m just being anxious about this but-”
After some tears are shred and affirmations of love are spoken, Draco clears his throat none too subtly.
sound before he slowly leans forward and suddenly he sitting sideways in Malfoy’s lap. Ron might have been okay with Harry and Malfoy dating but that doesn’t mean he wants to see them doing that! He likes it as much as Harry likes watching him and Hermione.
“I think we can forgo them just this once. Nothing’s more important than being with you and I felt suffocated and couldn’t sleep in that room anyways.” Harry mutters into his neck and Draco smiles dreamily and wounds his arms around Harry’s.
“Goodbye, darling.” He says as he kisses Pansy’s cheeks and takes Harry’s hand. They bid their goodbyes as they walk towards the appration point.
“Really, Draco? What did you think? I would just announce I’m bi and not tell them that I have a fiance?” Harry snaps angrily because clearly Draco is being ridiculous.
“So what should we do to you, Harry? Put a plug inside you or should it be a cockring this time?” Harry shivers in response, Draco smirks at him and leaves it for now. Maybe after they get back…
“Mipsy is here to greet Harry Potter. Who does Harry Potter like to meet? Master Draco isn’t here today.”
“Alright, bed time now.” Draco calls after an eternity passes with Harry listening to Reg bringing him up-to-date with everything that going on in his life. It seems very important.
As they pull apart, someone behind them mutters, “Fucking finally!” And then all their friends are there, yelling out congratulations in various degrees as they come out from wherever they were hiding.
Thus, starts the process of decorating. Teddy wants to whip the buttercream and he wants five different colours and two different types of sprinkles. And of course, both Draco and Teddy bat their eyes at him so Harry has to go out to get them. Not that he minds.
” Draco thunders out and Harry flinches slightly at the anger in his voice. “Well, once a Death Eater always a Death Eater.” He says with resignation and Harry opens his mouth to protest but Draco stops him.
“Where’s Draco?” That’s the first thing that comes out of his mouth. Hermione looks pained, so he turns to Ron and he has an almost identical expression. And then all of it crashes down on him.
but when he finally opened his eyes, there’s no red or bushy brown hair in sight. just the pale blond one which belonged to the prat he hated the most. Draco Fucking Malfoy. and for some reason he looked relieved to see Harry. that couldn’t possibly be right. because draco hated harry with passion and he would have been happy if he died-
“Sure, mate.” Ron shrugs and Hermione starts to get up so as to provide them some privacy, no doubt but Draco has no problem with both of them knowing and is currently with his friends announcing the news on the other side of the common room.
In the last, Draco agrees on a goth look with a short dress and mesh slacks. Harry with golden eyeliner which Pansy says would look godlike on his brown skin, so Blaise is going to do the same. He decides on wearing just his flag colours, with clip-on earrings and everything.
“harry was just asking about his job, and … other prospects of life.” Ron said, looking back and forth between Harry and Malfoy.
“Well, you all know I’m Trans and probably a demisexual. Not really sure about that,” Neville says next and then adds as an afterthought, “I like boys though.”
“I missed you. Dada said he didn’t know when you be back.” Reg mumbles into his neck, it’s mostly gibberish but Harry understands one and half year old pretty well, as he hugs him still, then he looks into his eyes with slight tears and says seriously, “Dada was so sad,” and then he hugs him again.
“Pray tell why you are sitting here examining one?” Harry asks as they come and stand infront of him. Ron then notices Hermione sitting in the chair infront of Malfoy, effectively making her almost invisible to anyone who enters.
“Don’t remember really, twenty years I think. If not more, time has been slow.” Draco replies wistfully.
Harry frowns at him for a moment but stands up and faces Draco. He really hopes Hermione and Pansy can see them and start-
“Yes I know. I’m- I’m proposing Harry tomorrow.” He announces and he is confused by their identical expressions of surprise and then repressed mirth. He didn’t except that.
He doesn’t understand why they are still talking as if nothing has ever happened, like those few years after the War didn’t even exist.
He comes out after several moments and in his hands is a small jewelry box, with intricate golden work over the black satin. The man opens the box and shows Harry the ring, it’s perfect with its platinum and gold band and a heavy diamond in the middle of it, he checks the inside and yes, the inscription is just how he had wanted it to be.
“No, Daddy.” Harry says, and Draco pulls back. Harry shoots him one last defiant glare before he walks off to their playroom.
“Hmmm, it’s just six in the morning though.” Draco replies and gives him a sleepy smile. “I’m nervous. They all thought I was- what if-” Draco starts confessing but Harry’s hearing none of it as he shushes him with a whispered
He had been shocked when he met Lucius as Draco’s boyfriend for the first time since the war, it had been after two years of dating Draco and he had been invited over. Gone was the bigoted, slimy bastard he knew, this Lucius was still as much of an arsehole but not the same one. They were not friendly exactly, but he liked to think that he and Lucius got along nowadays. Well it’s almost been eight years so he guessed with time anything was possible.
The three of them sat in silence for thirty more seconds before Hermione got up, mumbled something about
"Could you, y'know, protect him?", asked the black one quiet. He wasn't sure whether this was going to work but at his words the stag lay down, surrounding Draco's body, so fragile and yet Harry knew which strength it possessed, shielding it. And maybe it was just Harry's imagination, but he had the feeling that Draco's breathing became calmer and deeper as if he was finally able to sink into a deep and resting sleep.
"And if I were you I wouldn't try that." Harry directed at Mr. Malfoy who had try to get near his wand. Harry shot a spell at it and it flew to the other side of the room.
And there he was, like a young Greek God, skin like marble, eyes like Ice. Hair, soft and glamorous as Silk and these Lips... Every word that Harry had ever thought up on his way here vanished. He just could say his Name: "Draco..."
Harry wondered what to do. He didn't think that asking would do any good, if Draco didn't want to tell him there was no point persuading him. In the end he just wrapped his Arms around the blond and caressed his Head with slow soothing strokes. But as he looked forward to the holidays, his heart sank and an unfamiliar fear, like a foresight of coming terror clenched his heart in a tight fist.
" Up until a Year ago, you two despised each other. Have you forgotten everything he said about me? About Ron, your best friend? Have you forgotten what his father did to me in my first Year? How can you forgive him just like that? How dare you bring him here, and show off your... your... Thing that you have together!"
"Last time they did.", he reminded Harry. Of course, he was talking about the wild chase scene Harry had invented to get him the food. The Griffyndor shifted uncomfortably. He didn't want Draco to know, but he could have escaped Uncle Vernon with ease. He chose not to do it, because it would have meant leaving Draco alone. Harry could've just jumped over the fence and make a break for it. Usually, when he came back after something like this, of course he would still be punished, but by then the temper of Uncle Vernon had calmed down again, which made the punishment less physically violent. Draco hadn't been able to see that Uncle Vernon had give him a good beating once they were inside the house and the neighbours couldn't see. Always somewhere where nobody would notice. Harry had suppressed any kind of noise at that day. There was no point in worrying Draco at all.
Five Minutes later, they stood in front of one of the great fireplaces in the Atrium. Draco had become very still again, but he didn't look as scared as he had done before the hearing, more worried and a bit unsure.
"Don't leave me." ,he whispered pleadingly. Harry shook his Head. He'd rather die. Mrs. Weasly took a look at them and stood up. She worked as quickly and carefully as possible, removing the bandages, applying the potion and putting the new bandages on. The whole time, Harry was holding Draco's Hand in one of his, pressing his forehead against his lovers and caressing his cheek with his other, trying to wipe a away the tears of pain, that rolled down them, as Draco whimpered and even gave two or three little screams during the Procedure. When Mrs. Weasly was done, his chest were heaving and small sobs escaped his throat. But he was still conscious, which made Harry very glad. He continued stroking his face and Hair, whispering soothingly into his ear. Mrs. Weasly looked at them with a mixture of extreme sadness and pure anger, then she lay one hand on Harry's shoulder and left the room. Harry stayed where he were, his forehead still against Draco's who's sobs slowly subsided. When the Slytherin looked up, he looked tired, but better and more awake than before. He rose Harry's hand to his lips and kissed it.
"Thank you.", he whispered, his voice still hoarse from crying. Harry smiled and sat himself next to Draco, careful not to touch his back at all times. He kissed him softly on the mouth and smiled. Mrs. Weasly came back into the room, in her hands a bowl with hot Chicken soup. The sight brought Draco to tears again. He began to eat slowly, then as if his body was suddenly realizing how hungry it was nearly drank the bowl up. When he was done, he looked at the bowl and then pleadingly at Mrs. Weasly.
They went up to Harry's bedroom, Where he started to put everything into his trunk. The Dursley's really hadn't touched anything, which he was very glad for and immensely thankful to Mr. Weasly.
He was also more sensitive, having had so little sleep he was very easy upset, cumulating in him shouting at Mrs. Weasly for trying to comb his hair. It only lasted a second and he looked so aghast and scared right after, when he swung around and ran from the kitchen that Harry was stunned for a moment.
"They were from her you know. The letters always said things like 'To keep a smile on your face', 'to get you through the day', 'to make you feel better'. She knew I was hurting. She knew and she tried to console me, the only way that made sense to her. Giving me sweets, Presents... anything but the one thing I needed. But I think she meant well. She really did. I think... she didn't know any other way herself.", he finished looking a bit forlorn. Harry squeezed his hand.
"But please... my mother... it's not her fault. She has been... depressed a lot. I'm not even sure he has noticed it. Please, don't judge her."
"Now, Draco, tell us your side of the story please." She said and Harry was sure now that her voice had become softer.
There, in front of him stood Draco. But what a shape he was in! He was wet, small cuts went across his face as if he had been dashing through the bushes and trees, his shirt was torn in various places and he had wrapped his arms around himself, shivering visibly in the cold night air. For a second, Harry was too shocked to say anything or react in any kind of way. Then he ushered Draco in, closing the door carefully behind him and leading him up the stairs, warning him of the first step.
Then there was the actual transfer of Narcissa. Draco and Harry went with the St. Mungos People to pick her up from the Mansion. At first she made a fuss, saying that she had to stay home in case her husband came home from work. It was only after Draco had sat down with her and again explained that Lucius wouldn't be coming home for a long time and that she was going someplace nice and friendly and that he would visit her as often as possible that she finally agreed. Draco had used the family fortune to make sure that Narcissa had everything she needed and would not want for anything. Harry still could have sworn that he heard his heart break when they took her away.
Draco looked confused and worried. "Are you... mad at me for... you now... being together with Harry?" He asked scared. Harry really hadn't seen him ever this subdued. It saddened him.
"Of course he didn't. Do you think I can't see that he is just frightened? I know that feeling. You are so scared that anyone might see how near to the breaking point you are, that you just lash out, on anyone available." The sadness in her voice and eyes deepened and Harry asked himself when she might have been that frightened. And answered the question to himself immediately. Back then. Bill Charlie and the Twins were all older then him, so that meant during the time Voldemort was in power she not only had to fear for her life and the life of her husband, but already for the life of her then four children. He could imagine her, trying to be all tough, lashing out at her husband and kids for little slip ups, just so scared that every one could have been there last.
"That settles it then. Harry, a tomorrow is Saturday, I won't have to go to work, so we can go than, all right?" Harry nodded and Mr. Weasly strode off into the Kitchen to ask his wife how dinner was coming around.
Three weeks before Term started, Harry couldn't take it any longer. When Draco woke that night, Harry took his hand and let him down the stairs and into the living room so that they could talk without waking Ron.
"She isn't a bad person, you know?" He said quietly, when they stood in front of the enormous Mantelpiece. "I think she expressed all the love she could in her own way. Remember all those Sweet Packs I used to get from my Parents at Hogwarts?"
Harry couldn't believe it. After all this Lucius Malfoy was still trying to worm his way out. But not this time.
The second was that Harry hadn't taken any of his Hogwarts things from the Dursley's that meant he would have to go back to Private Drive before the Start of the term to get it. Then it occurred to him, that Draco hadn't gotten any of his stuff either. It probably would take quiet an effort to get those. But for now, Harry didn't worry. At least he had his Wand, which he always kept on his body. It was his most important possession. A wizard without his wand was about as useful as a door without a handle. And he had more pressing matters at hand.
"High Court! This is absolutely inappropriate! You are laying suggestions into his..." "Mr. Malfoy, You will sit down and be quiet as long as I am questioning the accuser!"
"Mr. Weasly, could we talk to you?" he asked the man in a low Voice. Ron's father looked at him with a mix of curiosity, worry and relief. He seemed to understand immediatly what this was about.
In the evening Harry slumped on his bed, feeling completely exhausted. He had worked for ten today, the way his arms and back felt. Also, he had been right about the sunburn. His back felt, raw and hot, like the skin was too small for him.
"I might have." Draco continued. "If Harry hadn't stopped me." He looked back at his lover and a sad little smile crossed his face.
But Draco came. Harry showed him the Room of Requirement and for the first time they both let their masks fall. Harry found that the real Draco was much more fragile and vulnerable then he looked, shuddering at Harry's slightest touches.
"Well... this is it. My House." He looked as if he wanted to say ore, but instead shook his had and added quietly: "It seems even bigger then last time...", as if speaking to himself.
Most of the time, Harry sat next to his bed, wiping his feverish forehead with a wet cloth. Mrs. Weasly came in once to change the bandages and apply more of the potion. Draco stirred again but didn't wake. Harry's Heart sank even lower.
"Yes, High Court, Of course I deny them!" , said he now, sounding now quiet appalled. "I mean, you can't really think these were true, can you?" He smiled again, sickly and sweetly, like an hypnotic snake, lulling it's Victim in a false sense of security.
"I think Mrs. Weasly, we could all use another Mug of tea... and those cookies you were talking about sound lie a very good Idea too."
When they arrived at the Burrow 2 Minutes later, it was to find Mrs. Weasly waiting for them, pulling them both into a gigantic Hug, the second they had stepped out of the fire.
They broke of, still gazing into one another's eyes, when they heard a little knock, behind them. Draco, who was facing the doorway looked up and went slightly pink.
"Great!", said Ron, rubbing his hands excitedly. "Well, I hope you're better than Harry, because to be honest, there is no fun in playing if you know you are winning!" He grinned and Harry frowned at him. And Draco... giggled. It was the most wonderful sound, Harry thought he had ever heard. His Heart felt so much lighter and he gave Ron a look of deep gratitude, who grinned and went of to get his Chessboard.
The black-haired boy woke up the next morning, to find Draco still cuddled tightly to his side. He himself must have slipped into sleep somehow, sometime. He craned his neck, trying to catch a glimpse of his clock without waking the other up. His Heart made a jump. It was 8 o'clock. He should have been down, making breakfast half an hour ago. If he didn't turn up immediately, Petunia, who was always the first one to stand up would notice he hadn't and she would come up here to wake him. He couldn't let that happen. Careful, trying not to move too much, he pulled his arm out under Draco's body. The other stirred, but slept on. Harry could only guess how long he walked to get here. He still hadn't had an exact Idea how he did it at all. But it seemed that he really needed the sleep.
When Harry had waited that night, he feared that Draco wouldn't come. Or worse, that he had put Filch on his heels.
For a moment there was silence, then Mrs. Weasly said quietly: "I can make sure that the others won't find out. I'll burn this and I burn every newspaper that comes in the next few days!" She said it with a cold fury.
Draco stood there and watched her leave. Harry got up and put his arms around him from behind. Draco grabbed them with his hands.
Then Mrs. Weasly sighed and said since they were all awake anyway She would start making breakfast right away. Harry stretched and Draco nuzzled near him, keeping close contact. Harry lay one arm around him and kissed him on the head.
"I... no, I- that is not what... I..."Lucius Malfoy couldn't seem to string one single sentence together. He fell back on the floor where he sat, kind of blank eyed, but with an expression of utter Horror on his face.
Harry hadn't heard Draco utter a single word about his mother up until now. But he had seen how Draco reacted to Mrs. Weasly motherly attitude towards him. No, his mother hadn't been there for him. He wouldn't say it to Draco, who clearly wanted to protect her from harm, but he thought that she had really missed out on her duty's as as a mother. Weren't mother's supposed to give everything to protect their children?
"Sorry, as you can see, we haven't been given so much space... Oh, that is Perkins, by the way, my Co-worker." An old man with fluffy white hair smiled at them and said "Nice to meet you"
"Have you seen him In there? No, I am pretty sure that he is genuine." His Voice shook a bit. Ron shook his head. "No I haven't. But I know I have also never seen Dad and Mum look so serious and, quiet frankly, furious, so it must be really bad, mustn't it?" He shrugged. "If he's not trying to hurt you, I think I can live with it. Though it really is a little shock...", he murmured, but smiled. And Harry smiled back, though weakly, glad he didn't have to choose between his best friend and his boyfriend. He sighed heavily.
"The hearing will be next week on Wednesday. That means we have 5 days. There isn't much you can do, really, except getting mentally ready and when the time come, telling what happened. I also got a warrant for your... for Lucius House. Members of the Ministry will go there and collect all your stuff." He told Harry and Draco. Then he looked at the black-haired boy.
He had raised his hand, as if to caress his face, but stopped dead, as if he was realizing what he was about to do.
He waved his wand to make room and nodded towards a two small stools while he sat down on the only chair.
"Draco, I have to ask this question but if you want, you can nod or shake your head. Did your father rape you?"
"The Person... the person who used it on me... it was not the first time. And it was not... not..." His voice seemed to fail him. Harry took his hand and squeezed it. Draco looked at him and Harry nodded softly. Draco swallowed again.
"It's ok, I'm not going anywhere..." Harry hold the clothes towards Draco and this time, the other took them. He looked at them with a kind of confused look.
"Draco, it's me. Harry, you remember? I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. I just want to give you these clothes. Don't you wanna be warm and dry again?"
"C-could I..." he began but she interrupted him, taking the bowl out of his hands smiling. "I'll be back with a refill in a second, dear." She said and huddled out of the room. Draco looked after her in a mixture of shock, amazement and something that Harry identified as guilt a second later.
"Happy Anniversary" he heard Draco whisper and it was the last thing he heard before drifting peacefully to sleep
Mr. Weasly still hadn't said anything. He just looked at Draco. Then he came forward and, leaning down on him, he hugged him. Harry could see Draco stiffen momentarily with this unusual display of emotions towards him. But then he patted Mr. Weasly on the back. The man let go of him and took a step back.
"Your Mother?" he asked tentatively. Draco nodded. Harry took a deep breath and decided that now, as Draco had already brought her up, he could as well ask.
Mr. Malfoy had half stood up, his hands outstretched towards his wand. It only seemed to dawn at him now, that this might not have been a good Idea.
, you know?" he tried to imply the truth without saying it out loud, but Ron just looked at him with puzzlement. Harry sighed.
"Hey... I've brought you something to eat." , Harry said softly, placing the plate on the Desk. Draco looked at the Toast with a mixture of hunger and revolt.
Mr. Weasly led them up to the second floor and through a corridor. I front of a wooden door, which stated: "Magical Law Enforcement, Court Room I" Harry's heart pounded. Mr. Weasly checked his watch. "5 Minutes. I think you'd better get in." He lay one hand on Draco' shoulder who turned around, his eyes wide and his complexion now definitely greenish.
His mother looked at him for a long time, not saying anything. Then she stretched out a hand and cupped his face with it.
" I think she knows,", he said slowly, thinking about it, "but I don't think she cares. Right now you are a boy who is wounded and needs help, that's all. That's just how she is." Harry saw Draco taking a deep breath as Mrs. Weasly came in again with a refilled bowl in her hand. Now he tried to take his time and Harry thought that he also tried to show some manners. When he had emptied the bowl he said. " This is very delicious Mrs. Weasly. Can I... ask you for a third one?" The last words came out very quiet again and Mrs. Weasly smiled
Harry hoped so. The Griffyndor had worked hard to gain Draco's trust and hoped that it was enough for the Slytherin to tell him his worries.
Harry crept through the dark corridors. His invisibility Cloak might protect him from being spotted right away, but if he ran into a teacher, (Snape, for instance) he'd still be facing the Detention of a lifetime at best, especially, when he would never be able to explain why he was outside bed.
His love opened his eyes slowly and though they were still very foggy he looked at Harry and smiled weakly. The dark-haired boy knelt down next to his bed and began stroking his head.
"A neat little trick isn't it? You'd be amazed what you can find in the library if you know where to look..." He said with a gleam of laughter in his eyes. Draco smiled too. " You have to teach me that one someday..." He said, letting his Hands wander around Harry's still dressed Chest. Harry waved his Wand again and his own clothes disappeared too "Why, you don't need it, Love.", positively grinning at Draco's fake pout, which turned into a smile as he started wandering his hands over Harry's now naked Chest.
"You won't hurt him." Harry's eyes had found Mr. Malfoy's again an he was staring at him with all the burning desire to avenge, to hurt, to make him feel, that he had had when they had entered the room.
Lying on his stomach he dazed a bit at his wall. Tomorrow was supposed to be as hot as today. He would have the choice between sweating in a t-shirt or burning his back even worse. A deep sigh escaped his lips. With a last thought of Draco, without even taking of his glasses, he fell asleep.
They were standing in a marvellous hall, big, with a high ceiling. In it's middle stood the grandest Dinner table Harry had ever seen outside of Hogwarts. It looked dark and old. In fact, everything looked pretty dark and old. Harry looked around and saw that there were high windows on the walls, but all of them were hanged with thick black curtains so that the only light came from the Chandelier hanging on the ceiling. It was huge and Harry had the distinct impression that those Diamond drops where real.
"Now then, grab my Arm, boys!", he said and Harry took Draco's Arm who looked up kinda shocked that his surroundings were still there. "Hold tight, okay?" Harry said softly and Draco nodded and put his hand around Mr. Weasly's wrist. Harry grabbed the other Arm and the next second they were pressed through the rubber tunnel.
But Ron laughed. "Naw, they're just joking. Sure Ginny's a bit shaken, but it's not as if there was ever anything between her and Harry and really, how often does it work out with your first crush? No, she's gonna find someone else, no doubt. Jut not to soon." He added hastily in a kind of dangerous undertone. Draco relaxed a little.
His voice had been getting louder and more intense. When he was done she stared at him, trying to hold his burning gaze. After a while, she dropped it.
"We are going to apparate a bit but we will have to go also by Muggle transport system because you two have got to go through the Visitors entrance.", he answered and smiled reassuringly to Draco, who didn't seem to have heard a word.
Mrs. Weasly's smile faltered a bit. And then she pulled him into a hug, one of her warm motherly hugs that Harry knew to be the sole essence of comfort and security.
"Yeah. I'm serious. We've been together for about nine month' now. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, okay? But Draco asked me, not to do it right away. We were going to wait, see where our relationship went... Believe me, this,", he pointed at the closed door, " was not how I planned you finding out."
"I can't go back to the Burrow just yet. I have... I have to go and see my mother. She is all alone in that house now. I'm a bit scared for her. And I have to think of something for her and me anyway..." He looked a bit deflated. Harry put his Arm around him and Draco gladly took his hand. Mr. Weasly nodded.
They were woken by Ron's loud shouting the next morning. Harry stirred and tried to get what he meant. Ron was running down the stairs and stopped dead when he saw them huddled together on the couch. He went very pink and stared at them.
"I'll be eating in my room, then you don't have to put up with me." he just said. The others said nothing, going back to ignoring him how they usually did it when Harry was around. He knew nobody would stop him. The Dursley's were glad when they didn't have him sitting at the Table.
They walked through the hall to a door on the other side. It led into an Entrance hall where two staircases went upwards in a kind of spiral. Up they went through a long Corridor, lain with a red velvet Carpet and plastered with Portraits of old Malfoy Ancestors, who all looked disapprovingly at them, but didn't say anything. Finally they stood in Front of a high wooden door, dark as everything else in this House. Draco took another deep breath, and knocked.
He looked at the Patronus. "Harry, you're not supposed to do magic outside school." , she said, but it didn't sound as if she meant it.
Harry hold himself upright, not wanting to crush the fragile body beneath him and slowly slumped to the side. There they lay, both panting and catching their breath. Then Draco turned his Head and smiled.
"Draco..." Harry was shocked. It had looked as if the touch of Harry had scared Draco out of his wits.
"Well... I thought the Weasly's could help. Their Dad works at the ministry... I don't know..." he paused for a second.
In some ways, it was worse than Harry had expected. But only in some. When he rang the bell, there was first no sound from inside the house.
"That does sound like an excellent Idea, indeed." Madame Bones said. She flicked her wand. "Accio Lucius Malfoy's wand!" The wand soared through the air and she caught it neatly. Then she directed her own wand at the tip.
Up until this Day, Harry was sure that Draco would have backed away if he hadn't grabbed his hand. Without thinking about what he was doing or what consequences might follow, he pulled Draco in and kissed him. At first he felt the other stiffen and for a horrible moment he thought he done the wrong thing. That Draco had only come here to tease him somehow, and now he was making a fool out of himself. But then the lips against his softened and Draco returned the Kiss, though unsure, as if they both didn't know if they weren't half dreaming anyway. When they broke the Kiss, Draco backed away, a look of Shock on his face. He turned but Harry got hold of his hand again.
"They tried to cheer up Ginny for days. Honestly, I think they are making it worse by the minute." He looked at Harry. " She really liked you, I think it came as a real shock for her that you are swinging the other way 'round." He grinned a bit.
"Oh, get a room you two!" Sounded the Voices of the Twins suddenly towards them. Harry broke the kiss and Draco looked kind of scared, as if he was expecting a scolding, but Fred and George grinned.
Draco kissed Harry on the cheek. "Don't worry. I'll be there the whole time. And if they try to do anything..." His voice was getting darker and Harry smiled weakly
For a while, non of them said anything. Then Draco raised his head and even though there were still tear trails on his face, his eyes were dry.
Harry tried to imagine it. Cooped up in a house with a Father he feared and a mother, to fragile for the world. No one he could have talked to, no one, he could confide in.
"Draco, my dear boy. Why don't you tell these people what really happened? I know, we all get our rebellious phases, Merlin alone knows the sins of my youth," Here he stopped for a moment to laugh pleasantly. And with a great Jolt of horror, Harry heard a few of the Court members laugh to. They started to believe him. They really began to thought that Draco made it all up.
"You two are free to go now. I am very sorry for this incident. Mr. Malfoy on your request we will not charge your mother. But the fact remains that the Mediwizards in St. Mungos deem her not fit to care for you, and as you are under age, you can not live alone with her, at least without anyone checking on you on a regular basis. It does not have to be decided today, but I will contact you soon about the matter." She turned around and let the room, together with the other wizards and witches, who inclined there heads when they passed them. Then the doors closed and they were alone.
Harry looked up at the Calendar. Today was the 4th. Only today, and tomorrow they would be out of here and Draco would be safe. Only today.
Hello people, It's Saiyasha. I deeply, deeply apologize for the very long wait! 'bows down' but I ad something that we in Germany call a krea-tief. It is a wordplay. 'kreativ' means creative. And if you spell if krea-tief, it stands for 'creative down/low' because 'tief' in German means 'down' or 'low'. So what I wanted to say is, I was pretty stuck and I do apologize If this chapter isn't as good as the others were maybe, but I have the distinct hope that it is going up-hill from here on. Thanks for sticking around
"Please... please, Harry... help me..." the Boys heart sank. Dracos voice sounded hoarse and as of he was in pain. What happened?
It took Harry only a second to cross the Distance between them, laying a deep, deep kiss on Draco's Lips. They were soft and warm and Harry's heart seemed to burst with the feeling of skin on skin, with the way Draco was holding tight to him, with the rhythm of Draco' heart beating steadily against his own. It was perfect, he thought. One of those moments you want to fill in a bottle and preserve so that you can take it out on the rainy day's of life.
" That's... it...boy..." the red-faced man panted, clearly trying to catch his breath. "I will lock you in your room for all eternity!" Harry let him pull himself away. He had caught a glimpse of Draco on his Window, looking shocked and hoped that he would be wise enough to hide himself and the food when Uncle Vernon was shoving him into the room.
For so long Draco had pretended that this wasn't real, that his Parents where loving, caring people, that he was proud of his lineage, even that his family was better then other due to there bloodstatus. And even though Harry was sure that Draco made the right decision in this, it could not be easy to see your whole world crumble around you until only the rubble was left.
"Sorry, but...", he started as Draco finally rose his head. His eyes were puffy and his face completely wet, as tears continued to stream down it, and he sniffed.
Harry didn't believe his ears. It couldn't be true. Draco was Lucius Malfoy's only Son. He loved him, right? He had to! Because that's what Parents did, they loved their Children. Harry's Mother even died for him. Her love for Harry had left such a permanent mark on him that it created a physical Barrier for Voldemort.
"It's just... Summer Vacation is only two weeks away, you know... and... I don't...I dontwantogohome!", Draco suddenly blurted out and Harry needed a moment for his still awakening head to form a halfway sensible sentence out of this.
"If you want, I can make you breakfast. But if you want to be alone for a while..." She turned to leave and Draco went darker. He hadn't really spoken with Mrs. Weasly, mostly hidden in some corners since the day he had screamed at her. Harry smiled at him and kissed him again, a short, sweet kiss, this time. Then he looked at him. "Breakfast?" , he asked and Draco nodded, still pink, but looking a bit more relaxed now.
"Wait here a moment, okay? I'm going to get Mrs. Weasly. Maybe she can give you something against the pain." He kissed Draco's forehead and hurried to get her. He barely had uttered a word when she strode past him, a jug of water in her one, bandages and the potion in the other hand.
Ron seemed as uncomfortable as the Slytherin, standing there for a while without saying anything. Then he cleared his throat.
Harry hadn't paid attention. Why hadn't he paid attention? Why taken his eyes from Malfoy Senior for even one second? He looked up now, to see both guards standing totally still. They did not look at Mr. Malfoy. Or Harry and Draco. In fact they didn't even seem to notice them. Harry's Heart beat fast. Behind that door were more people. He couldn't, could he?
And so, when Hedwig came swooping in on the fifth day, he was so relieved, he nearly cried. He had to hide Draco beneath the cover now, whenever Uncle Vernon came in to let him out for toilet, because the blonde couldn't get up any more, even if he knew where he was.
"I can't, " he said apologetically. "I have to ask him first, if I can tell you. It's not my place to decide." Mrs. Weasly looked very sad, but not, thought Harry because he wouldn't trust her. She probably guessed that there was more to this than just a beating.
"Hey." he simply said. It was weak, he knew it, but he didn't know what to say. The hearing was only two days away and Harry just couldn't come up with anything that would be really comforting.
"Merlin, you mean it!" he gasped, shocked. Harry looked away. It hurt to see Ron taking it so hard, even though he had expected it. Ron was never really good with changes.
"Go away, Mom, I'm fine. And if it is you, Fred and George, stop mocking me! You have no Idea how I feel!", Ginny yelled from the inside. Harry ignored her and opened the unlocked door. Ginny sat on her bed, her back towards him.
Over the course of the day, Harry realized two things: First, Everyone seemed to take the news that he and Draco Malfoy were a Couple pretty lightly, which was probably mainly thanks to the way they arrived here. It was probably hard to despise a person that lay deeply wounded and unconscious in your living room. Well, that was, everyone, except Ginny, who seemed quiet shocked at the news and after that always had a very sour look on her face whenever she saw Harry.
"Oh Harry, that's a good one! You nearly had me there for a second, you..." He stopped, his glance falling on Harry, who looked serious.
First, nothing happened. Then Harry could hear footsteps, slow and soft on the other side. The door opened slowly and there stood Narcissa Malfoy.
"Come on you lot!", Mr. Weasly called to the rest. He ushered them out before him and went through the door only when they were all out. Then he followed them and they went a short way up the street until the nearly couldn't see the Dursley's house any more. Then he turned around to them. Go ahead," he said quietly. "Go to where we've apparated, I'll be there in a minute." They nodded and proceeded towards the spot where they had appeared only about half an hour ago.
They had been in Potion, when there was a loud smashing sound. Goyle had obviously dropped a glass viol. Harry could see Draco's face contort in pain for a second. A large Drop of blood, ruby-red and strangely contrasted to Draco's white skin had appeared on his cheek. Harry had no Idea how on earth Goyle had smashed the viol but somehow one of the splinters had managed to cut Draco's cheek. The blond frowned and raised his hand to his face to feel the damage. When he saw the blood in his Hands, he grew white. It was only for a split second but Harry was sure he swayed a little. Then he blinked and hit Goyle over the Head.
"Well...", he started, not quiet sure how to start. It hadn't occurred to him that Ron thought Draco and he were just friends. How would he react when he found out the truth? But there was no use in hiding it any more, so he could let the cat out of the bag anyway.
Harry told her everything. He stopped only when he came to what Draco had nearly done and tried to think of a good way of brushing over it, but Draco got there first.
The whip never left Scars. How often had this already happened? How often had Lucius Malfoy tortured and abused his son? Harry's stomach made a sickening jolt when he thought back to the last time they had been together at Hogwarts and wished he had pushed harder back then, gotten Draco to tell him what was going on. Could he have prevented this from happening? Send him to the Weasly's right away? But Somehow he knew, that Draco wouldn't have done it. His pride was to great, his masquerade to perfect. The fact that he didn't mind having help from the Weasly's was a sign how damaged he really was on the inside. Harry was scared, that he might never recover again and swore to himself to do everything in his power to help him.
But as grand and pompous it looked, it all had the air of a place that no one lived in, as if it was an abandoned House in which kids would break in for a thrill or a challenge, only haunted by the ghosts of those who had lived here long before.
"There, my dear. That should do it, I think." Mrs. Weasly said smiling after she had finished. Draco turned around and looked at her, for the first time since that argument.
"Draco, what exactly do you want?", He then asked slowly. Draco looked at him, puzzled. "What do you mean, 'what do I want'? Isn't it obvious?" Over the Past to days, Draco had regained a bit of his self-consciousness, even if it was only a shadow of what he had been before. Funny, it seemed that locking them both in here was the best thing Uncle Vernon could have done. It allowed Harry to concentrate on Draco completely.
How far they had come. Tomorrow they would go down to Breakfast together. Not seperate, holding hands and everything. No more hiding. They would take a seat next to Ron and Hermione, who had taken the whole thing quite well, Draco now often sittig on the Griffindor Table.
"I understand. Then I will send you back to Malfoy Manor first and you can get back home with Floopowder from there, is that right?"
Mr. Weasly looked shocked. And Draco hadn't even dropped the biggest Bombshell yet. Even though his voice was still soft and sympathetic, Harry could see a vein pound on his forehead and could imagine the fury inside the man.
“So who all are going tomorrow?” Harry asks his usual friend group. Everyone responds with a yes and how is that possible?
“Why are we still a secret?” Draco asks after a moment of silence and Harry, he feels himself freeze.
Harry is panting by the time he finds his lips. His wand vibrates in his pocket at the slight reminder that it’s their anniversary.
They are still chuckling as he discusses the details of the date he had set up for tomorrow. Nowhere public because neither of them liked that, so instead he had picked up a picnic spot for tomorrow night. It would be great fun to propose in the middle of night with only the moons and stars providing them light.
“what about them?” Malfoy inquired and Hermione asked at the same time Hermione cried out, “harry, can you please
Neville is going in his usual wool sweater and trousers and his flag around his shoulder. Theo is matching with him.
“Well we can’t right now and you know, good boys don’t start stuff they can’t finish. You know what that makes you, Harry?” Draco questions and tilts his head.
He goes back to bed, he cradles Harry’s face and shushes him. “It’s alright, I understand. I’ll stay.”
And that’s that. He stays the night, for the first time in almost two years. He would be inhuman not to, not when he saw Harry’s face. He had been inhuman loads in the past, not anymore. That he had promised himself, that summer of 1998.
“We should really thank Hermione and Pansy for this, don’t you think?” Harry asks as they finally sit down on the picnic blanket. The sky is bare of any clouds and they can easily see all the stars.
“Shut up, Blaise.” The six of them, him, Draco, Hermione, Neville, Theo and Luna say in unison and it’s a pictureworthy moment.
“I still don’t like you going away from me,” Draco grumbles as Harry takes his washroom kit and places a soft kiss on Draco’s lips. And then he gives Draco a tight smile before leaving the room entirely.
“MUM! DAD!” Harry exclaims and he runs towards them, he vaguely thinks if they’ll be solid or not. They are.
A shiver runs down Harry’s spine and Draco grins slyly, even after a decade Harry has the same reaction. Honestly, it’s good for his ego.
“Dracoooo,” Hermione slurs and that astonishes Draco because Hermione never drinks a lot. Just a glass of wine or maybe two mugs of lager but not so much to get drunk. Just ‘happy tipsy’ she had called it when he had asked years ago.
He opens the box and Draco looks up at him, “Yes, you idiot. I was planning on asking you tonight but no you always have to compete me.” Harry huffs and then Draco starts laughing.
“I missed you too, my reggie-teggie. But guess what I won’t be going anywhere now and we would have so much fun, won’t we? We’ll ride on the broom again all around the house while Dada goes to work, innit?” Harry asks and Reg beams at him, “And I’ll try to make sure Dada isn’t sad anymore, yeah?” And he nods enthusiastically.
shines through everything at last, crystal clear- thanks to Fred and George’s handiwork. He gets down on one knee and takes out the ring box and holds it open.
“Well, I’m just going as an ally. Mostly for Ron but all of you are going to be there anyways so I took a day off.” Hermione says and wow, Hermione and off days. That’s almost unheard of.
“Which part really? Because I had known Harry wasn’t straight for a long time.” Ginny adds in and Harry levels her a look.
Malfoy finally gestured at his left hand and he say it, a solid but thin band of gold with small diamonds encrusted. It looked perfect. Just what Harry would have wanted for himself. Did he choose the ring himself then? Not detered, he slid the ring out of his finger. It was with some struggle but it came out atlast. But malfoy was still standing with his hand open.
“No, Harry. You know it’s true. That’s what the press would always believe no matter what I do, no matter how much good work I do, it will always be there. I have accepted it but that doesn’t mean you have to as well. The implications of being with someone like me would be a lot. I understand, I truly do.” Draco sighs and no no no Draco is understanding this all wrong.
“Oh he won the first one. He said you both were in a actual relationship. I said you were just tired of fights and were being civil for our sake. Everyone had different answers.” Neville answers and wow they got
When they finally arrive there, Andy is telling Teddy to be a good boy and not trouble him or Draco.
Harry frowns at the words in the sky for a moment, then opens his mouth to say something to Draco and freezes when he sees him on knee.
Harry could still hear some words ringing in his mind. Child? He had a child? He was a dad? He had to-
“So you got the parents blessings then?” Pansy asks as she takes a sip of her firewhiskey mixed coffee.
“Strip out of your outer clothes and go wait in our room.” Draco orders but Harry defiantly rolls his eyes.
“So, well- why aren’t you both reacting in any manner?” Harry asks, a tinge of frustration in his voice.
“Never,” he looked at Draco’s face, and couldn’t help joining him. The absurdity of the situation wasn’t lost on him, laughing with Draco Malfoy over books before breakfast and being happy.
He trusts Harry to be like this infront of him. Harry feels awful for the warmth that blooms in his chest.
“Harry, baby! Your friends are abusing me!” he whines and Harry tuts mockingly which gets him a glare.
The first thing Harry notices when he enters the common room is Malfoy. It’s always been that way, noticing the other or searching for them when they enter a certain classroom or the Great Hall.
Smiling sleepily, he looked beside him to find it empty, that made him frown. He knew Draco had no shifts today, not until 4 o'clock anyways.
“oh, and if we are actually married. I would like a divorce, immediately if possible. You can take whatever you want from my vaults if you want, if money is what you have been after. Reckon you wouldn’t need much, what with your family fortune but I guess some people are never satisfied.” Harry taunted because that’s what he knew best, even if Malfoy looked like he was on the verge of crying.
“Hi…” Harry breathes, as he arches his neck in a silent request. Draco places sweet kisses all over his jaw and neck, sucking new marks and biting the tender skin now and then.
“Draco no, they don’t matter. No, look at him,” Draco refuses to turn his head towards him, “LOOK AT ME!” Harry bellows and Draco looks up at last.
It’s true afterall, after their jobs took a turn, neither of them had been visiting Teddy or most of their friends much. They should fix that.
Harry goes home early that day, there’s no one, just the empty house and him. He screams and cries his heart out, just like he had done twenty years back. He wishes to never meet Draco in this life ever again. His heart wouldn’t be able to survive that.
When he woke up again, he was staring at the same white ceiling as always. His head is pounding, he scrunches his face slightly and looks to his left expecting his exasperated husband as always. He finds Hermione instead, with Ron on his other side.
“nothing of it. Regulus is my son and he’ll be known as such from now on. I would like to see you try otherwise.” Malfoy basically growled. Then he gave one mock salute to Harry and turned his back to them and strode out of the room.
by some unspoken agreement, whoever gets home first would shower and if the other still hasn’t arrived, they will floo into the other’s house. most nights it’s harry who arrives first because of his regulated auror hours but when Draco has an early shift he is waiting for Harry to get back with tea already made.
“Oh you want me to prove it?” Zabini asks Draco and both of them look at Harry. Harry nods his head minutely. Now’s a good time as any and well if his bestfriends are actually correct then well….
“Let me go, you prick. Utter prick, with no fucking-” Draco says against himself and Harry shushes him gently.
It’s tradition to call each other names when wishing the other on a special day and at this point, it’s quite adorable.
“We are in my mind,” he replies and Draco arches an eyebrow at him. Yes he knows how barmy he sounds but its the
“Here you go, son. I’m sure Harry would be quite delighted.” He hands Draco the ring and engulfs him in a rare hug as well. Draco can’t believe it, his parents approve. Not that he didn’t know that, but it’s different to know that so explicitly.
“Because it’s bloody fucking obvious, that’s what it is. We have known for months now.” Ron gives Harry a judgement look as if he is the one who is behaving abnormally.
He asked him to sit down beside him, and instructed Kreacher about more breakfast before getting back to his book. There were only a few pages left to it. So Harry thought it wouldn’t take him much longer to finish.
“Draco, you know I don’t mean that. And- and I didn’t mean any of the shit I said after waking up,” Harry tries again, he knows it’s futile somewhat but he can’t just give up. “I should not have accused you like that. My last self was a number one arsehole.”
. and it was true because hermione had threatened to do exactly that if he landed himself in the hospital yet again.
Malfoy who was still the pouncy, posh git. Who still insulted him and taunted him but all of it felt ….fond.
“Yes, it was. Come here,” Draco says and tugs Harry close. He snuggles closer and Draco places soft kisses against his neck.
“Oh hey, good morning!” Harry calls when he finally sees Draco and he takes that as an invitation to come in.
“Because today is the first day in weeks that we both are off and I like spending time with both of you.” Harry replies and gives Draco a small smile.
“It’s going to be a real shocker to our friends as well. Do you think they know somehow?” Harry asks because it’s weird how Hermione who always is perspective in most things and Ron, who might look oblivious but was so observant all the time had no idea. He didn’t even think about Blaise or Pansy or the rest of their friend group because it would transform into a headache and he was enjoying his rare day off with his fiance.
“I love you too, love.” Draco replies and then he is out. His last thought as he goes to sleep is that he is blessed.
It had taken a lot of courage and almost a year and half of dating each other when Harry finally wpilled his darkest secret in the darkness of the night when he couldn’t see Draco’s face. Draco had taken it all in, nodding for a quick second before he changed the subject and Harry was relieved. He hadn’t wanted any more questions, not that night and Draco, bless him, understood that.
They talk a bit more, standing there about Harry’s life before Harry suggests getting coffee. Draco hesitates for a second before agreeing.
Harry, who has been relatively quiet, stares at him for a moment before he blurts out, “Why do you always say things which make me want to kiss you so fucking bad?”
“…yes, I did, you know to ask for their permission. How did you-” Draco doesn’t get time to finish because Harry is onto him.
“Everything alright?” harry whispers and draco shakes his head silently, he can’t talk about it now. It’s too soon and he doesn’t think he’ll be able to say the words out loud.
He loves giving out punishment as much as Harry loves getting them and tonight is going to be delightful. He already has plans ready for the evening in his mind. It’s only a matter of very less time.
“Mate, just know that we are here and you’re more than welcome at ours if Draco kicks you out or anything yeah?” Ron assures him after he tells them that he is going home. Hermione just hugs him one last time before he apparates away, fervently hoping that Draco hasn’t locked him out of the wards. The result of apparating inside while being locked out, especially of their customised wards aren’t great.
“Nothing, nothing will make them see it except time and effort. Promise me, Malfoy, you’ll do everything to make them see,” Harry asks fiercely and thus Draco promises.
“You thought it was Krum he was jealous of at the Ball but it turned out to be You!” Harry joins in and both of them stare at each other before bursting out loud at the situation.
“We can,” Draco stretches out the second word and tilts his head slightly, “but whoever shall decorate these? It’s quite a big job.”
“I always knew this dream would break, mione. I’ll be fine. I have reg.” Draco sighed before he came to stnd directly infront of Harry.
“Yes, yes. All of you are bigshots and we are grateful for so much security among us. Can we proceed then?” Pansy asks and Harry blushes slightly at the implications.
“There’s a difference between thirst for knowledge and loving story books. Not that I would expect someone like you to understand.” Draco rolled his eyes before he got back to his book.
“But Weasley, just think about it! We might have had Krum with us tonight as your partner and not Granger.” Draco says and scrunches his nose in mock disgust and the couple sends a stinging hex each and Draco yelps.
“Yes, we agreed to keep it low, until the press had calmed down from the breakup. It’s been four months since they stopped printing about you and Weaselette. Don’t you think it’s time?” Draco inquires.
“Oh? I have something to ask as well. You can go first though,” Harry offers and smiles charmingly at him.
“Because that’s not going to happen,” Draco continues, he meets Draco’s eyes with all his guilt and regret and he feels Draco’s barriers snapping, “What to know why, Harry? I don’t care because I’m going to tell you anyway.” Draco says casually and Harry prepares himself for it.
“Yeah, right. So what’s the real shit?” Harry snorted because malfoy might have a humor but this was so fucking far from the truth that it was downright ridiculous.
“Malfoy, what the fuck are you doing here? he asked, annoyance clear in his voice. and because he couldn’t help himself he asked the other question which was burning a hole in his brain, “what game are you talking about?”
Kreacher was cooking behind him, he actually looked happy these days, getting to serve not one but two people. One of whom was a direct descendant from the Noble House of Black. He didn’t even grumble at Harry’s requests these days and wasn’t that a feat.
“That’s right! Ron saw Krum a few months back, he was in Berlin for the new shop there and he came across there and I got a floocall taht very evening, he came through and told me through his haze.” Hermione smiles at her husband and messes his hair slightly, “Just imagine my shock-”
“Let’s go, swwetbean.” Draco says and leads the way towards the center where Pansy and Ginny are standing.
Harry ignored her and lifted his eyebrows at malfoy again, “well if you take away the ones I had. It’s only fair, I get those back.”
He wakes up to the warm midwinter sun caressing his face and the smell of bacon being fried. He smiles slowly then he looks around and realises it’s not his room. Then the last night comes to him and
Draco growls lowly in his ear and catches his earlobe between his teeth and gives a soft bite, “You’ll be the death of me.”
It kills him, just a bit when Draco smiles at her name and says, “Yes, of course. The marriage is great, our son, Scorpion will be six this year. Really, marrying one’s bestfriend is the best thing-” Draco stops suddenly because he realises what he just said.
“Oh then….you know what give me a vodka and peach drink. I deserve it after spending an entire afternoon with two Malfoys.” Harry says. The waiter suppresses his amusement and goes to get his order.
“Yes, if everything goes well. Otherwise I would be vanishing from the face of the Earth for the next decade or four.” Draco jokes, not really. Ron chuckles and they hang up.
“We had placed numerous bets of course.” Hermione replies as if this is something she does on regular basis.
Harry serves them both before taking his seat directly infront of him, smiling before he devours it.
He had been surprised when he noticed that they both had chosen almost identical rings for each other, except for the size of the diamonds. He had kissed Draco very inappropriately when he had noticed, much to Ron’s horror. Seriously, the dramatics never stopped when it came to Ron and Draco.
He stops breathing as he slowly enters the room. Draco doesn’t object so he is fine. When he stops a feet away from Draco. He looks so frail like this, like he hasn’t slept or eaten properly in days, he probably hasn’t.
“Is that so?” Father says as he tilts his head, “Very well then, I’ll go get it.” He leaves the room and Draco is left with his Mother.
How Harry never went to St. Mungos, how every scratch, every wound was healed overnight and by itself. How he never got ill or caught the seasonal flu. He suddenly knew a myriad of healing spells, none which he consciously remembered but whenever he had to heal someone, he just
Just as they reached the door to his new room for the year Harry stopped, hating himself for a moment as he spoke. "We should hang out soon, catch up."
"No," Harry said quickly, running a hand through his hair as he tried to find the words. "But don't you think you should?"
"Can we not talk about this?" Harry cut in quickly, ignoring how desperate he sounded. "I'm ready to talk about literally anything else."
"What does your Weasley think about you chasing me around like this?" Malfoy finally asked, though his voice lacked it's usual bite.
"That's not what I want to do," Harry cut in, stepping even closer to him. They were probably past the limit of what was considered a normal amount of personal space now, but Harry couldn't bring himself to care.
"Study with me," Harry heard himself ask, feeling as confused as Malfoy looked by the time he reached the end of the question.
"I don't know," Harry went on in a rush, "I just thought it could be different now, but I guess not."
Zabini just blinked at him, like he couldn't have possibly heard Harry correctly. "Just so I have this right," he said slowly. "You are talking about Draco?"
He wished he could follow his lead but Harry couldn't even bring himself to move from the bed, laid out watching the ceiling as he ignored the two essays he had due that weren't even halfway finished.
Zabini hummed, tapping the end of his quill against the desk. "Still, no great secret plans for the chosen one at work?"
"You look so good," Harry said mindlessly, with hardly any air left in his lungs at all, hearing and feeling the shudder that went through Malfoy at his words. "God, I want you so bad."
"That I care all that much," he said quietly, letting his eyes fall to Malfoy's mouth knowing full well the other could see it. "I can't seem to care about much of anything beyond what I want anymore."
"Right," Harry said dumbly, unable to stop himself from gaping at him like a fool. Malfoy looked the same but somehow different from a few weeks before, not quite as tired maybe, like a tension was gone from his shoulders Harry hadn't known was there to begin with. It looked good on him. "You look good."
Neville was quiet for so long after that Harry finally turned to look at him again, taking in the odd look that had settled onto his face. "You should try again."
The view from the top of the tower would be quite nice right now, though the thought of going up there set something off in his chest, suddenly feeling like he'd just woken up again. That alone decided it for him and Harry turned, taking the stairs to the top two at a time.
Malfoy looked back up at him, something like amusement touching his eyes. "You don't even know what I was going to ask."
"Do you really want to know?" Zabini finally asked in a sly voice. "I'll tell you if you tell me why you want to know."
"Malfoy," Harry said in a rush, only to watch in disbelief as Malfoy turned back walked away on quick steps before he could even really look at him, like Malfoy hadn't heard or seen him at all. In just a moment Malfoy was lost to the crowd, leaving Harry standing there alone, like he'd been that way from the start. He wasn't sure how long he stood there staring at the spot Malfoy had disappeared before he heard the first whistle of the train's arrival, feet moving him back on their own to where Ron and Hermione stood.
"What if he hadn't come back? He made it seem like he–I wasn't sure if he would even be here." Harry swallowed, looking down at his plate as he willed away the expressions from both of their faces, like they knew exactly what this was about when he still didn't have a clue.
Harry was just a step away when he realized he'd fallen into his same old past mistakes, with no idea what he would say just as Malfoy started to turn, catching Harry out of the corner of his rapidly widening eyes.
"You care Potter, you actually, genuinely care about other people." Malfoy looked as shocked by his words as Harry felt, but he didn't stop. "I don't think you realize just how rare that is."
Malfoy's steps faltered for a moment before he pressed on even faster than he had been walking before. "If everyone didn't talk about every mundane aspect of your life like it was riveting gossip I wouldn't."
"Can't wait to hear it," Harry said through a brittle smile, feeling like a walking talking pile of garbage.
Harry opened his mouth only to pause, trying to actually think for once in the face of the endless distraction to his brain that was Malfoy. "Eighteen last time I checked."
"If I could have everyone's attention for a moment," Magonagalls voice rang out across the hall, blessedly pulling all their conversations to a halt. Harry wasn't sure he'd ever been happier to hear her speak. "Just a few things before we send you off to your rooms."
"Do you?" Zabini asked. "Because there is generally only one reason someone wants to know if someone is single, and I can't imagine it's why you want to know."
"Is Malfoy single?" He asked instead, waiting for lighting to strike him through the window the moment the words left his mouth. Talk about subtlety.
"A bit," he said after a moment, tilting his head to the side as he watched Harry, doing nothing to hide the amusement in his voice. "Why?"
Harry stepped over the bench and threw his bag over his shoulder, looking up to see Malfoy disappearing through the doors to the great hall. "Just not very hungry tonight, I'll meet up with you guys later."
"Tell me," Malfoy pressed when all Harry did was stand there, his grip tightening as a look so frightened came over his face that Harry couldn't help expecting the smell of damp bathroom tile for a moment, lost in every way.
Harry finally tore his eyes from the other side of the hall to look at Ron, who looked like he knew exactly what Harry was doing and couldn't decide if he was amused or annoyed.
He was almost tempted to ask her why she thought he'd gone, if only for any hope of figuring it out himself. "To give him his wand back."
"Right." Harry finally slid the wand from out of his sleeve that he'd scarcely been able to think of since he'd put it there. "This is yours."
"Potter," Malfoy began, instantly ruining Harry's efforts the moment he spoke and pulled Harry's eyes back to his face, in no way ready for Malfoy to be looking at him the way he was. "Why do you..." Malfoy trailed off, looking down at his lap, brows pulled tight over his eyes.
Both of Malfoy's hands moved to Harry's shoulders as he pushed up onto his knees, pushing Harry onto his back as he straddled him, thighs warm along the outside of his hips as his hands slid down to rest along Harry's chest.
Harry didn't believe him and found himself saying as much, watching with some distant kind of thrill as Malfoy finally turned to face him again. "What exactly are you implying?" Malfoy asked in his most tight, uppity voice, eyebrow perfectly raised.
Harry leaned in closer still, reaching out to hold Malfoys wrist as he turned to look at him again. Malfoy didn't try to pull away, just looked at Harry with disbelief in his eyes. A blink and he closed off again, pulling his arm away as a hard look came over his face. "You should think before you talk, you might realize how you sound."
"What's number one?" Harry asked, endlessly curious what it could be, what about him would land the number one spot on Malfoys surely lengthy list of his flaws.
Malfoy pulled his hand out of his pants and Harry cracked open his eyes, watching Malfoy pull a face at his hand before reaching over to grab his wand from his robes, casting a cleaning charm over them both before leaning back to sit along Harry's thighs. The charm tingled over Harry's skin, like Malfoy touching him all over again for a brief but intense moment. Harry felt sated like he never had, that same endless feeling still vibrating just beneath his skin.
. Even worse than his tear soaked eyes in the stained bathroom mirror, than his face twisted with pain against the cold floor, laid out in his own blood. Even worse than when the only thing Harry had been able to feel in the world besides fire and smoke had been Mafloy, clinging to him almost as desperately as his voice had sounded.
Harry took a bite of his roll just to give himself a moment before he had to respond, truly hating his inability to just not talk for once. "I just thought you know, new year and everything. Might be nice."
"What are you doing here Potter?" Malfoy asked in a quieter voice than before, his hand rubbing his forearm over where Harry knew his mark was hidden beneath his long sleeves.
Harry realized Malfoy looked genuinely serious just as his own nerves settled in, the conversation taking a turn he hadn't thought to prepare for. Suddenly this didn't seem fun anymore, and more than anything Harry wished he could take the words back. He wasn't sure he would ever be ready to hear whatever Malfoy was about to say.
"Please," Malfoy said desperately, thighs tightening around Harry even more as his hands moved up to grasp his hair, pulling him down into another opened mouth kiss. "Please," he whispered again, with hardly any space between them to form the words, lips dragging against lips.
All at once Harry realized just how much he was intruding, showing up unannounced and demanding things from Malfoy that he had no right to. "I'm sorry, I just came here to give you back your wand." Harry couldn't help wondering at how easy it was for him to apologize now, when for years he would have rather regrown his bones than do anything even resembling saying sorry to Malfoy.
Harry just shrugged. "Yeah, but there's pretty much no hope for me in Potions. Sometimes you're just shit at something."
But Malfoy just kept watching him before turning to look out the window again. "You can stay," he said softly, his words so unexpected Harry couldn't quite be sure he'd heard them at all.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow expectantly, leaning into the wall as he turned his body to more fully face Harry. The top two buttons of his shirt were undone just like they had been over the summer, leaving the edge of his collarbone exposed. Harry wondered if his skin flushed like that all over.
Malfoy didn't answer, he just looked at Harry, visibly swallowing before his lips slowly parted. His hair still fell in that infuriatingly soft wave over his forehead, coming down to just touch his eyebrows. It felt like he would never get tired of looking at him.
The moment he closed his eyes all he could see was Malfoy flushed and glaring, his hair looking infuriatingly soft, like it was begging Harry to reach out and touch it.
Malfoy had looked gaunt, somehow worse than Harry had ever seen him. Even worse than last year, his face collapsing in on itself as he choked out
Malfoy nodded and then left him alone, making his way down the hall towards the kitchen. The kitchen he was going to make him and Harry tea in, and from the lack of the house elf at the door it seemed it would truly be Mafloy making it. It was so quiet Harry had to assume they were completely alone in the house, already knowing that Malfoy's mother had left for France and his father would never see anything outside of Azkaban again. So it was really just them.
"Nothing," Harry said slowly, biting back a laugh but not the smile he felt around his words. "I just know you, you've known my schedule every year we've come to school."
"Potter," he breathed out, the word seeming to fall out of Malfoy as his eyes darted over the length of him before quickly looking away again.
Ron was off with Hermione studying, which left Harry alone in their room with Zabini. Harry hadn't been sure what to expect from him as a roommate, but besides the occasional off handed joke at one of their expense he mostly kept to himself. Half the time it was easier to forget he was staying with them at all, he was gone from the room so often. This was one of maybe three other times all year Harry could remember seeing him actually sitting in their room studying.
In only a moment Malfoy opened his eyes again, traveling over Harry in a lazy movement before he pushed him to the side and then onto his back. In one movement Mafloy was straddling him again, hips just far enough away to give his hand room to work open the button of Harry's now painfully tight jeans. Harry wasn't even sure he was breathing as he watched Malfoy slide the zipper down, his eyes half lidded as Mafloy slid a hand inside and wrapped around him.
Malfoy scoffed before moving to stand again and Harry let him, dropping his hands after one last quick squeeze. He sat up and crossed his legs, watching Malfoy fuss about trying to make himself presentable.
Malfoy shook his head, finally giving a half hearted tug of his hand. "You can't," he said quickly, visibly swallowing, eyes darting away and back to him again like he couldn't quite believe this was real, like if he looked away from Harry for too long he would disappear all together.
Forcing his steps to be steady Harry walked over to where Malfoy sat in the corner, sitting next to him with his back against the wall. He was probably too close, but Harry never could quite help himself when it came to this. Malfoy didn't look at him, just kept his eyes on the sky, legs stretched out and crossed in front of him. His hair was mused with sleep, falling in uneven waves with the odd piece curling around the edge of his ear.
"Still," Harry pressed, ignoring the irrational urge inside of himself to reach out and touch. "We could study together, once we do."
Harry finally caught Malfoy three days later, literally chasing after him down the hallway after dinner. He'd hardly been able to catch even a glimpse of Malfoy out of the corner of his eye all day, so the moment Harry saw him he hadn't been able to care what he looked like, he'd just taken off after him down the hallway.
Spinning on the spot Harry turned to see Malfoy leaning by the door behind him, arms crossed over his chest with an expression on his face Harry didn't look at too closely. "Malfoy," Harry said dumbly, like it needed to be said at all.
Malfoy finally paused in whatever it was he was doing, dropping his arms to his sides as he turned back to face him. "Don't act like you don't get off chasing me around," he said quickly, holding eye contact just as long as it took him to speak before turning his back to him. It was still a painfully good sight.
Harry stood up from the table, giving up on looking like he was doing anything but running away from this conversation. "Sorry, I just remembered I have a meeting."
"So full of yourself," Malfy mumbled as he turned in his arms, laying his hands against Harry's chest as he watched him with a raised eyebrow. "What makes you think I'll let you catch me again?"
"There shouldn't be anything for them to listen in on!" Malfoy said in a rush, throwing an arm out in front of him because he apparently really couldn't stop being so dramatic.
"Sure," Zabini said distractedly, eyes back down on his parchment with his quill in hand. In a moment he dropped it to the desk, spinning in his chair to face Harry again. "Okay," he said quickly. "Just so I'm sure I'm getting this right, you, Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world wants to shag Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater and general menace to society?"
"I just mean–" Harry all but stuttered out, cutting himself off as he rubbed a hand through his hair, going on with no real idea of what he would say. "It's good that you're here, I'm glad you decided to come back."
"Right." Harry took another drink just so he had something to do with his hands. Malfoy had made no move to pick up his own cup, openly watching him though Harry could hardly bring himself to meet his eye in return.
"I want you to," Harry said simply, only really registering the words when he took in the look they brought to Malfoys face. He pressed on in a rush, ignoring the burn he could feel beneath his skin. "That–I mean don't you need your N.E.W.T.s?" That was a normal reason to have right? Harry was almost proud that he'd managed to think of it. "I know I still need them."
"Not really, no." Harry said easily. Shame didn't seem to factor in, not when it got him here, finally next to Mafloy and actually talking with him. It seemed there was shockingly little he wouldn't do to get here anymore.
Their eyes met once, for the first and only time that day when Harry was walking down from the stand, and even then it had only been a moment before he'd torn his eyes away again. Harry hadn't been able to stand it, Malfoy looking at Harry like he was some unreal thing, like without all that anger Malfoy could only look lost, eyes screaming out for answers Harry didn't have to give, especially when the same questions were ringing out inside of him.
Harry pulled him down against him again, so close to the edge he could hardly think straight, like all there was was Malfoy on top of him, moving against him, hot and hard and unreal. It was everything he'd wanted and more, but still it wasn't quite enough. Making the decision all at once Harry slid his hands out of Malfoys pants, ignoring his noise of protest as he grabbed his hips, leveraging him with his own as he flipped them over, quickly moving a hand up to cradle Malfoy's head before it could hit the stone floor.
Harry just blinked at his hands, mind scrambling for any one thing to say. Did Malfoy really never talk about him? If he did mention him, what did he say? Did he think Harry was completely mad? Did he actually want to talk to him, even just the smallest bit?
Harry hadn't realized they talked, though it seemed so obvious they would now he couldn't believe he hadn't thought of it before. "Do you talk a lot, you and Mafloy?"
Malfoy had actually met his eye at breakfast this morning, purposefully, without breaking away the moment it happened. It was such a small thing, hardly anything really, but Harry couldn't fight back the urge to smile every time it came back to mind. He wasn't sure what would happen to him if Malfoy actually came up and talked to him at this point.
Malfoy scowled at him, crossing his arms over his chest again. "You do remember we're not friends don't you? I seem to recall you hardly being able to stand me."
"I knew yours too," Harry went on, apparently giving up on the last shreds of dignity he still had. "I know you're going to Binns right now."
Harry looked down at the wand in his hand, searching inside himself pointlessly for the words to make this make sense to someone like Malfoy. Finally he just gave up and shrugged. "It's yours, it just felt like I should."
His answer seemed to take Malfoy off guard, his expression somehow becoming even more closed off as he went on. "Well, here I am."
Harry stood on unsteady legs outside the front doors at Malfoy manor, heart beating incessantly against his chest. He made no move to knock, just like he hadn't done for the last five minutes he'd been standing there. As hard as he tried Harry couldn't seem to make himself move, knowing that he only had himself to blame for finding himself in this situation. Not even Ron or Hermione knew where he was, not for a lack of trust and more for the simple fact that Harry was still no closer to explaining it to himself.
Malfoy went tense all over the moment he saw it, almost like he was bracing himself for an attack. It made that same strange point in Harry's chest ache, to know that after all this time Malfoy was still so afraid. The fear shifted into shock but Malfoy made no move to reach out and take it, just looked at it in Harry's hand like he couldn't believe it was real. And then against all reason Malfoy shook his head, glaring at Harry from across the table.
"I wonder if he got a new wand?" Hermione said from her seat next to Ron, joining the conversation for the first time. "I've read that it's rather tricky to find a new match, especially the older you get. Some wizards never find a match that feels anything close to their first."
Face burning Harry simply nodded his head, watching Hermione elbow Ron in his side. Shooting a quick glare around them Hermione turned back to Harry, leaning closer against the table as she spoke. "Why did you go see Mafloy?" She asked quietly, though Harry suspected that more than anyone else she already knew, better than even he did most likely.
It took half a moment for Harry to realize what had happened, and then it was all he could think of, burning up inside what the knowledge that he'd actually made Mafloy feel that good.
"What's it like," Harry began, breaking his eye away from across the great hall to look at Neville eating beside him, "rooming with Malfoy?"
Harry couldn't breathe for a moment after that, watching Malloy's lips as they silently formed his name.
Harry slowed to a normal walk when he reached the top, eyes instantly going to the window and the seemingly endless sky beyond. It was a testament to how tired he must have been that Harry didn't notice Malfoy strait off, sitting off in the corner against the wall already watching him. For maybe the first time he didn't look angry the moment their eyes met, Malfoy just kept looking at him in the silence with his painfully tired eyes.
"I can't believe he's an even bigger idiot than you," he said in a faint voice, still just shaking his head like he couldn't believe any of this. Harry found he could relate.
"Yeah," Harry said when they broke apart, his breath heavy. "I think you'll let me catch you again."
Ginny whirled around and stared at him. "What are you...? Wait, how I make him feel? Are you kidding me?" She rose up, her eyes glittering with fury.
And so, when Draco's lids began to flutter at about 11 in the evening he was so relieved that he nearly cried.
"I will inform the inquiry," Mr. Weasly said slowly. "Now if you excuse me, I really have to go to work." He lay one hand on Draco's shoulder, who flinched, but didn't back away.
After they got Harry's Stuff back, they days seemed to melt. Draco went quieter and quieter as the day of his hearing drew nearer. Harry saw with worry that he tended to draw himself away from everyone, hiding out in small places, just staring at one point and not talking. He even seemed to draw away from Harry. The only times when he seemed to absolutely not want to be alone, was at night when he tugged to Harry so close and held his hand so firmly as if he feared the boy might vanish at every second. He had also started to get more frequent nightmares again, something that had somewhat subsided during the past weeks, though not vanished.
So, in the end, I decided to do it. It gives the ending a slyghtly bittersweet feeling But I can live with that.
Harry rolled his eyes and attempted to throw a pillow at them. The Twins grins broadened and they ducked.
During his speech, Draco looked to the floor. Harry could see his figure shaking slightly. He was so scared.
"No, mother. He went to the ministry today, that is true. But he will not come back. They arrested him. They brought him to Azkaban. He is never going to come back."
"What are you sorry for, Draco?" In his heart, Harry wasn't sure that he wanted to know, but he could see that it would be important for Draco to say it.
"Draco... What is your relationship with your mother? I mean, I can't seem to fit her into the picture somehow." It was true. He had thought about it. Draco had said to Mr. Weasly that his mother possibly didn't even know about all that had been going on. But how was that possible? It had happened in her house, didn't it? Surely, she must have had an inclination. Then why hadn't she acted? And why was Draco trying to protect her, when she had possibly let him down more than anything else, in neglecting her duty to protect and shelter him?
"Draco Malfoy, huh?" Ron's voice suddenly sounded behind him and Harry turned around. His best friend looked at him with a mixture of anger, curiosity and worry. Harry understood the anger. He had known that he had to tell Ron and Hermione sooner or later, but Draco had practically begged him not to do so right now. So he only shrugged. There wasn't much he could say.
"She doesn't mind. She knows you didn't mean it! We all know that you are under a whole lot of pressure. I mean, Mr. Weasly hasn't told them what the meeting is about exactly but... they know there's the hearing and so..."
It was silent in the room. The kind of deadly, deafening silence that you had before a storm. Draco still trembled and Harry could feel his heart eating through his hand, hard and fast.
"I want to tell Mr. Weasly." Draco whispered in the end. The fear was still lurking and Harry didn't think that it would ever go away completely. All he could do was keeping it at bay. He nodded and kissed Draco, again and again, until both their tears had dried and they fell asleep on the Sofa, closely cuddled onto each other.
"You know that you are always welcome at this house, my dear, don't you? Don't hesitate dropping in any time you want", she said, still smiling.
With a jolt, Harry came out of his memory. Hermione was looking at him with an expression that told him he wanted his opinion on something.
"Draco, dear, Daddy had to go to the Ministry. Daddy is an important person... But he'll be back. He will always be back." The last sentence was so clear that Harry wondered how far away she really was. There had been no real fear in her voice but an air of given up home and grim acceptance.
Ron seldom noticed Draco waking up, the Slytherin never said a word. He never screamed, just whimpered sometimes. Harry thought that he stopped screaming probably a long time ago. People who liked to inflict pain on others usually where edged on by screaming and pleading, Harry knew that from his experience with Dudley. He could only imagine that Draco had come to a similar conclusion with his father.
They had landed on a spot about five minutes on foot to Private Drive, in a group of trees so that they weren't spotted by Muggles, appearing out of thin air.
Mrs. Weasly had put two spare Mattresses into Ron's room, which made it very crowded and small but she thought it would be better for Harry to stay near Draco and they couldn't put another bed in the living room if they were to use it.
"Draco." Harry's Heart stopped. Lucius Malfoy had turned and looked at his son. Harry saw that there was practically no colour left in Draco's face as he stared down on the floor, unable to look at his father.
"I never would, Harry, dear. Tell him that when he wakes up" She took out her wand and said "Expecto Patronum" A Fox erupted from her Wand tip and curled up next to Harry's Stag. He looked at her, then smiled. She smiled back, turned and descended the stairs.
"Next time you are left in the room to protect the victims from the criminal, please make sure that you pay attention when he draws his wand." She said coldly and the men winced as if she had hit them.
"Let me go!" the blonde yelled, tears now gushing out of his eyes. "He deserves it! After all he's done! To say he is... To think he'd still be..."
The words "my father" which he had used so often before just wouldn't come out. His struggles became weaker and after a while stopped, as he hang limp and sobbing in Harry's arms.
"I can only hope,", he said through gritted teeth, "That the high court is able to distinguish between the story's of a fifteen year old boy and the truth."
They had noticed that when the Person on the other side didn't object to a special Person coming in, the Door would budge. If the one on the other side didn't want anyone to come in, it didn't appear.
He nearly ran down the stairs and had just entered the Kitchen when he heard the door of Aunt Petunia's and Uncle Vernon's Bedroom open and close again. He had about 10 minutes, while she was in the bathroom, to gather up something. He cramped out the frying pan, Toast, Bacon and eggs, nearly dropping the last. Wishing the stove would heat up a bit faster he had just begun to break the eggs into the pan when aunt Petunia came down. She spotted him at once.
"Ron, I love Draco. I hope... well I hope that you can understand that. Please try to accept him, would you? He's been through a lot...", Harry's Voice faded, still shaken by what he had found out about Draco's past. He looked at Ron again, who's face had changed to thoughtful.
But now, he had them every night again, sometimes woke up several times in one night, every time looking as if all he wanted to do was to curl up into a very small ball and vanish completely.
"Well, you found me know. Better late than never, isn't that what they say?" said softly and kissed Harry.
But Harry had meant what he said back at the Burrow. Out of this rubble, Draco would rise again, stronger and more beautiful then ever. An he would be there, all the way.
First Harry thought Draco had felt offended, because he usually avoided physical contact with everyone, except Harry. But then he saw his eyes and it was as if he was looking I the mirror. In the Slytherin's eyes shone the same emotion that he had felt the first time Mrs. Weasly had hugged him and kissed him goodbye on King's Cross to send him of to Hogwarts. It was the deep and desperate wish to have her as a mother. To be able to feel this love everyday and call it his own. And for the first time Harry understood, that you could be very lonely even if you had a family. And he asked himself if Draco's mother had ever hugged and kissed him in all his life.
, said the voice. He put the badge on and then suddenly the telephone box began to move, deep beneath the ground, into the Ministry of magic.
With a last laugh they vanished through the door just as Ron came back, throwing them an exasperated look.
"So.", he said after a short pause. "I guess... you are going to tell me what happened, will you?" he looked from one to the other with a serious face, and his eyes came to a hold on Draco's face.
Harry of course didn't and Draco wasn't to be persuaded, even though Harry could see him wince at the smallest movements.
" I haven't forgotten anything, Ginny. I know exactly who Draco Malfoy is and was. But I also know, that we can't be held responsible for the sins of our parents for instance, so don't you go and accuse him about that Diary! You have absolutely no Idea what he has gone through. He has suffered, Ginny, more than you could ever imagine. I won't let you treat him as if he has done something horrible to you. I'm very sorry that it didn't work out for you the way you wanted, but what do you want me to say? That I love you, even though it's not true? Do you really want me to pretend that we are in a relationship, when in truth all my thoughts are on him all the time? Is that what you want, Ginny?"
"Let's go home?" He phrased it as a question, because this was Draco's home, or at least had been. But Draco seemed to understand, because although his smile still held some of the sadness at seeing his Mother, It was a smile nonetheless.
Draco nodded. "He... hit me. With a whip. But I can't proof it. There are no Scars. It doesn't leave scars." He told the Court this with much more courage. Harry knew that this, the physical pain was nothing against what he had had to endure emotionally. It had never been the whipping that had broken Draco.
With that, the witches and wizards at the high table stood up and left the room, leaving Harry Draco, Mr. Malfoy and two Guards quiet alone with each other.
"... we will let Mr. Weasly handle it, OK?" he finished the sentence. "I wouldn't want you get hurt again over something like that. I've been running away from the Dursley's my whole life, believe me, I have experience enough. They would never catch me." He grinned broadly to convince Draco who still looked worried.
"Not these, she can't." She said in a low voice. "I know that kind of whip that made these wounds. It was used a lot back then..." Her Voice got lost a bit and Harry knew that she meant the time when Voldemort had been in power, before Harry's birth. Mrs. Weasly blinked and returned to the Present. "It is a magically enhanced Whip, called the 'Flesheater'. It's wounds heal very slow and are not to be mended by magic. But they never leave scars, which makes it impossible to see that it has been used once the wounds have healed. It was a very popular instrument of torture back in the day." She shuddered slightly.
"How can she be so nice? Doesn't she know what I've done? What I've said about her and her family? How can she..." He gulped, the words seemed to have fled him. Harry kissed him again.
"Since when have you to been friends, really? And why, for Merlin's sake didn't you tell us? I fell bad now for making mean comments about him in front of you!", the red-haired boy said, beckoning Harry out of the living room, so they wouldn't wake Draco up. Harry threw one last glance over his shoulder to the curtains around his bed, then he followed Ron, closing the door behind him.
"Mrs. Weasly... Please, whatever you read about the hearing in the papers... don't think any different of him. I know he would like you not to know, but I don't think there's a way around it once the Prophet gets a hold of it..."
Harry wandered deeper with his lips, kissing Draco's Chest and his fragile thighs, slowly nearing the spot where Draco wanted him the most. When Harry's lips touched Draco's member the Slytherin yelled in pleasure and his hips rocked forward without control.
"Draco, dear, what is it? You know, you are not supposed to disturbed Mommy. Daddy my get angry with you..." Her voice trailed away. It was as misty and unclear as her appearance, and gave the impression that she was somewhere else entirely with her thoughts. Her gaze fell upon Harry now.
The next 5 days after Hedwig had gone, Draco's condition worsened. Two days after, Harry noticed that his temperature was rising. He now insisted that Draco let him take a look at his back and the other gave in at last. Harry saw his darkest fears confirmed. Some of the wounds had become infected and it was likely that Draco were on the brink of becoming very, very ill. When Uncle Vernon let him out for toilet again, he managed to sneak a wet cloth and one bandage into the room. He tried to clean the wounds as good as possible, ignoring the painful grunts and hisses from Draco as he did so, even though they made Harry's heart bleed. It didn't do much good though and Harry just tried wrapping the bandage around the worst of it so that it wouldn't get infected any further. Then he could only wait. He grew more impatient with every day, seeing as Draco got weaker and sicker, his fever rising from day to day. On the fourth he began hallucinating, which Harry feared was not only due to the wounds and fever, but also to lack of real sleep and good food. He needed Mr. Weasly's reply fast.
"I can't believe someone has used it on a child. I didn't even know there were some I the possession of private people any more. After the fall of he-who-must-not-be-named, they were forbidden and all known once were destroyed. But it seems, someone has kept one." She looked sharply at Harry again who saw away quickly, asking himself how much she guessed. Then he looked back at Draco.
It was a circular room, with Windows all around and a high ceiling. A bunch Wizards sat on the other end of it, on a high table. The Witch in the Middle looked up as they entered.
Mrs. Weasly sighed and stood up, somehow looking suddenly very old and tired. Harry wondered if she had mended wound like these often during the dark times. It was in moments like this that he remembered that there had been times when Mrs. Weasly probably hadn't smiled much and where she had to fear for every single one of her children every day. She swung her wand and a Curtain appeared around the bed, blocking the unconscious Draco from view. She patted Harry on the Arm one more time and left the room.
"not... Uh-hm, not fair." he managed to croak when Draco waved his wand and a second later Harry was as starkers as he was.
"Don't thank me to soon, dear. I have to change the bandages now and I cannot guarantee for the effect of the Painkillers in that situation." She said, her Voice sounding sad. Harry saw fear in Draco' s eyes and hurried forward. Draco took his hand and pressed it firmly.
"Mrs. Weasly, I was at that trial. Whatever is in there, cannot be worse that what lies behind me." There was that sad smile again. Mrs. Weasly's eyes filled with renewed tears. With shaking hands, she lowered the Newspaper and handed it to Draco. He turned it around and started reading, his eyes unfathomable. Then he sighed and laid it down on the Table.
