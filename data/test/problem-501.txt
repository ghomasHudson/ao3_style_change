“What are we spying on?” a voice whispered quietly from behind Draco, and he nearly jumped into the shelves in shock.
His own mother didn’t want him anymore, why would he think that Potter would be any different. He’d already failed at this relationship, and it wasn’t even real.
As if sensing his thoughts racing, Pansy stepped up beside him and looped her arm through his. Even flanked by her and Blaise, Draco’s legs felt like jelly as she pulled him swiftly towards the train.
Finch-Fletchley had a small freak out when he found Draco’s collection of Versace silk shirts. He picked out the purple and gold medusa print for Draco to wear tucked into white jeans. Draco sat on his bed and carefully undid all the little plaits, combing out his hair gently with his fingers. It fell to his shoulders in little ripples, and he loved it.
“Definitely a poodle. I’m very intelligent and highly strung.”
“Theo?” he called down the table.
“I don’t know, you’ve just always been Granger.”
“But I want to apologise properly,” he continued stubbornly.
“I don’t understand,” he slurred mournfully, all the confidence and focus bleeding out of him.
“I’ll be fine,” he muttered into her hair.
Boot suddenly had an uncertain look on his face, as though something hadn’t gone to plan. Draco guessed that he expected begging or something, some plea for mercy so he could deliver whatever threatening speech he had planned.
Inside the castle was warm and bright after the freezing trek in the dark night. Neither of the Professor’s spoke as they walked purposefully up the marble staircase, travelling the well worn path to the third floor.
I’m so sorry this is later than planned. I’ve had the chance to work up in Edinburgh for a few weeks, and guys, it’s the most magical city. I can totally see why it inspired so much of the Harry Potter world. While I’ve lost my respect for JKR in the last few years (her recent behaviour has hurt me on all sorts of levels) my love for Harry Potter can never die. ~Kisses~
She nodded and turned back to Potter.
They piled into the room, and there sat McGonagall behind her desk, her hands clasped tightly in front of her. The deep frown on her face spoke volumes without her needing to say a word. Beside her, behind the desk, standing tall with his huge arms folded across his chest, was Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister for Magic.
That’s when Draco saw the camera.
At some point he wandered down to breakfast by himself, collected a giant mug of coffee and a pastry from the almost completely empty Hall, and went back to the common room. It was Saturday, and still too early for most students to be up and about. He fetched his books and settled at one of the big round study tables, spreading his notes around and finally cracking open the homework he couldn’t start earlier. He felt oddly peaceful. His body still ached but his time alone and his run in with Potter had calmed him somehow.
“Is this some sort of 12 step program thing? Bigots anonymous?” she asked sceptically.
Pansy alternated between ignoring Padma, and trying to engage her in passive aggressive conversation. Draco tried to jump in and save Padma as often as he could, and she smiled gratefully at him when Pansy was distracted with her drink.
Her head snapped up to look at him. He met her gaze, keeping his expression carefully bland.
“Right, well, thank you, but I have some things to do...” he said nervously, waving a hand vaguely down the street, in the opposite direction from the school.
“He said it’s his last chance to spend Christmas here.”
“If you think you’re going to get out of telling me how you ended up being blasted down a flight of stairs today, you’re loonier than everyone says I am.”
“Fine,” Draco rolled his eyes, “but you’re coming with me to be my glass carrying bitch.” He shoved Blaise, who grinned and started taking people’s orders.
“Well then why are you talking to me and not off somewhere with her?” he asked.
Pansy elbowed him sharply and Draco flinched. She’d caught him right in a fresh bruise he’d gotten in a nasty fall that morning. Fifth years thought knock back jinxes were so funny.
“We’re cousins Draco. My mum was your aunt.”
She spluttered as he started working, grinning over at the little incredulous noises she kept making through her nose. There wasn’t another chance to talk in the studious quiet of the classroom, without every single other person overhearing. He wished he could have caught her in Charms, which had been utter chaos, or Potions, but Potter was in both of those classes with them.
Potter looked uncomfortable and he rubbed a hand across the back of his head
Luna sat down happily beside him and began to pour a selection of different juices into one glass. Pansy was staring at her like she was an exotic animal in a zoo.
She was in the navy dress. She was drunk. Her usually impeccable red lipstick was smeared across her cheek.
Draco’s heart skipped. He thought Potter was going to kiss him, but instead he ghosted his lips along Draco’s jaw, his breath hot. Draco’s skin tingled. He pressed a soft kiss under Draco’s ear, before dragging his lips down Draco’s neck, pushing his hair back and pulling the collar of his jumper aside to press his face against him. He breathed deeply, drinking Draco in.
Draco hopped up to close the door behind her, to avoid Pansy flashing any passers-by. He turned to look at her, his eyebrows raised.
Draco could only speculate, but if he had to guess he’d say that Granger especially did not approve of Potter’s current choices. A rift appeared to have formed in the Golden Trio.
So the plan is that I'll be uploading every week on a Wednesday, because Wednesday's are rubbish and it'll give me something to look forward to. I'm writing this mainly for myself to prove that I can, but I'm more than happy for anyone to come along on this party train with me! I hope you stick around.
He sat on the bed and reluctantly shrugged out of his uniform. He avoided her eyes, but he still saw the way her lips pursed when she spotted the patchwork of half healed to fresh stinging jinx marks all over his torso. He was still researching a way to get rid of them, but hadn’t been successful just yet.
He felt absolutely nothing.
Two weeks later, the first snow fell on Hogwarts, and Hermione sat down next to Draco at lunch. Students up and down the table stared at them in confusion, including Weasley, who was at the other end of the table and looked like he had been waiting for her. Pansy’s spoon was frozen half way between her mouth and her soup. Draco elbowed her in the side, and turned to smile quizzically at Hermione.
“What did they say?” Draco asked hesitantly, sitting up straight. He wasn’t sure if he really wanted to know.
He took a big step away from Potter.
McGonagall looked at him sharply and he shrank a little, blinking at his own outburst.
It was the last weekend before the Christmas holidays. The following Saturday everyone would be leaving to go home. Justin told Draco that Finnigan had tried to arrange another party for the Saturday evening, but it hadn’t worked out. Draco privately believed that the reason the party wasn’t going ahead was because of Potter. He’d seen Potter and Finnigan arguing in the corner of the common room on Thursday evening, over a game of exploding snap. Justin heard that it’d been decided that there would be a New Year’s party when they all got back at the start of the next term instead.
“Oooo! Never have I Ever!” cried Tracey, jumping up and gathering alcohol to bring back to the circle for easy access.
When everyone confirmed they did, Blaise made a little circle with his wand, his lips moving soundlessly. Draco felt the familiar warmth in his fingers from the spell.
“That’s the spirit.”
“So stop trying to help him,” he insisted.
“Really? None of you have realised that I’m gay?”
At the edge of the crowd that had gathered was a young man, grinning from ear to ear as he took picture after picture of the fight.
Potter sat back a little, and Draco could practically see his internal panic and indecision, before he glanced at the menu again and gave a small, jerky nod.
“I do not need to know what you do with Weasley,” he replied quickly, and she laughed.
She grinned, knowing she had won.
“Wait, what do you mean family?”
Draco cringed. It was always worse when it was personal revenge.
“Oh I’m fine. I’ve been studying for hours and I’m a bit overloaded.”
“Even if I wasn’t gayer than a rainbow striped Dr. Marten, Draco is like my brother. Not in a million years.”
She looked at him with her knowing eyes that told him she knew exactly how long he had been listening.
Draco rolled his eyes and grinned at him, before registering that he was genuinely amused. MacMillan was watching him closely, but clapped his hands in an encouraging way.
“I wouldn’t worry about what Weasley thinks.”
He groaned.
Potter looked at him then, his eyebrows quirking up in surprise. There was a studded bar through his eyebrow today instead of his usual ring. Draco stared at it.
Weasley and Draco both stared at her in surprise. Weasley turned to look back at Draco with renewed interest.
He went back to searching through his wardrobe, a little more calmly than he had been before.
“Don’t you dare Finch-Fletchley. Blaise is a big boy who can fix his own problems.”
Life settled into a routine over the next few weeks. He endured harassment from the Hogwarts student body. He spent time with Luna. He danced around the dorm room with Justin. He even studied with Granger and Patil on a regular basis.
When the feast was over, McGonagall stood from her chair and stared around at the students with patient authority. It barely took a moment for a respectful hush to fall around the room, the students sitting to attention. Even Potter stopped flicking profiteroles at Finnigan.
“Don’t start your bullshit with him Kingsley! He didn’t do anything wrong, he was trying to help!” he shouted angrily.
On Friday evening the snow was falling steadily, swirling in the darkness as they tramped into Hogsmeade. Draco ducked into the Three Broomsticks, dragging Pansy behind him, shaking snow from his cloak and out of his hair. Pansy shrieked as she was sprayed with freezing droplets, and Blaise laughed, following them into the pub. Justin bounded in last, almost completely concealed in a huge fuzzy coat and a knitted hat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can’t remember half of the things you said were on here,” he said with a sigh.
“Sure,” Draco replied, shrugging.
“What?” he called back. Draco sighed and moved to sit next to them.
He gradually became aware of a whispered argument on the other side of the curtains. Curious he sat forwards, straining to pick out the words.
“What happened old boy? Are you alright?” he asked nervously, stilling when Draco entered the room. He was twisting the hem of his jumper in his small hands. For once, the record player was silent.
Potter’s face was relaxed in sleep, and Draco was lost for a minute, mapping the planes of his face with his eyes. He really was beautiful.
His mouth opened and closed silently as he grasped for a way to respond to that. He absolutely would do anything as a favour to Hermione, but this was asking a lot.
“I can take care of myself,” he huffed.
“Um, yes, sure, if you’d like?”
Ah. This wasn’t about their schedules.
She just raised her eyebrows at him innocently.
Draco agreed, and left before he got any more wound up. He didn’t want to analyse why it made him feel better to have a plan to make a plan. He preferred structure, but he did wish he could be more laissez-faire about life.
He went slowly back down to the common room. In his chair by the fire he suddenly felt terribly alone. It shouldn’t feel any different to the many mornings he had spent here, up so early before everyone else, but it did. He felt the absence of his sleeping classmates like a void. He was alone in the tower. The castle loomed huge around him, almost deserted. The expanse of the dark forest through the windows disappeared into the distance, still and desolate.
It started on Friday evening.
“Salazar’s sake Draco!” Blaise burst out, pulling his arm away from Draco’s grip. “Is this really still a thing? If you won’t do anything about this obsession you have, that’s on you, it has nothing to do with me. Practically every guy in the castle with even the slightest queer leaning has gotten into Potter’s pants but I’m not allowed? How is that fair?”
She shot another hard look at Potter, and walked away.
He ignored her for a few minutes, finishing his train of thought in the essay he was writing for Charms. She huffed in his ear and flicked the plaits in annoyance.
There was silence on the other side of the table, and then Potter muttered, “Is this in French?”
“Keep up you two,” McDonald shouted from down the street, shattering the stillness of the night. They both jumped.
Pansy burst out laughing.
“I’m not asking for your forgiveness Granger. Honestly I don’t deserve it. I just wanted you to know that I was sorry. That’s all.”
“Are you alright old boy? You look a bit het up,” Justin asked him quietly.
“What’s gotten you all excited?” he asked, curious.
Only Blaise drank and everyone sniggered.
“You put yourself and Mr. Malfoy in unnecessary danger.”
He leered at their stunned silence.
Potter looked surprised, like he’d expected Draco to throw a fit. He relaxed a little.
Patil came and took the armload of books from her.
He shot out of the archway at the top and was halfway down the corridor before he heard the voice call out behind him, and he stopped. He turned slowly.
He did a bit of window shopping, and bought some new quills. He killed an hour in the bookshop, but didn’t buy anything this time.
Pansy grinned and looked thoughtful.
“That’s the problem! I’ve gone through practically every eligible guy in school who’s age appropriate, and I’ve burned a lot of bridges. None of those guys want to DATE me.”
Howard staggered up and charged at Potter, fists swinging. He knocked Potter backwards, and he fell heavily into a table covered in empty glasses. Shattered glass sprayed from the table, slicing through Potter’s bare forearms. Without a pause, Potter righted himself and swung for Howard. They grappled back and forth before Potter’s head snapped back from a blow to the face. He floundered, then slashed his wand back around. Howard was forced off his feet again, slamming backward into the floor. In a blink Potter was straddling Howard’s chest, raining punches down on him, while Howard tried to shake him off.
“Just stop it,” he hissed at her.
“I was being purposefully antagonistic towards you, and I got you involved in a bar fight,” he said slowly, his words sounding carefully practiced.
Potter stared back at Weasley, and after a moment spread his steady hands.
“Is that your blood or someone else’s?”
Potter rolled his eyes.
It was her turn to stare blankly at him, before she closed her eyes and loosened her defensive stance. She came and sat back down at the table, resting her chin in her palm.
“Draco...”
“Creepy blonde waif twins you mean,” said Blaise, before returning to his newspaper.
“I mean I was beginning to wonder if this was your whole diabolical plan. Forcing me to have lunch alone, how dastardly,” Draco smiled a little.
“He was funny, and very nice about it,” she continued, looking down and twisting her hands in her lap. “I was terribly sorry to hear about what happened Ron.”
Draco nearly fainted before he realised he was holding his breath.
“Look, I’ve thought about it OK? It actually works out better that it’s you. What’s going to get more attention? Me dating fucking Bradley Knox, who’s sweet but so stupid, OR me reconciling with my former childhood rival? The articles write themselves. You and me together? They’ll eat it up, and that’s all I care about. Plus, as much as I hate to say it, you being a Malfoy helps with those fuddy-duddy old bastards at the Ministry. The ones who are complaining about me are the same ones who still care about things like blood purity, no matter what they say otherwise.”
“What did you order?” Potter asked curiously.
“Harry,” he said sternly, his deep voice a rumble in his chest, “your behaviour recently has been erratic and self destructive.”
Draco didn’t want anything to do with any of it. He just wanted to figure out who he was. If he could be more than what he had been raised to be. Better.
Draco stared at her.
What the fuck was he doing?
She sniffed.
“Ahhh a tale as old as time,” Pansy sighed.
“Has Potter had a breakdown?” Blaise commented snidely, “I mean what does he think he looks like.”
He laughed.
That definitely wasn’t right.
She tapped her lip, her dark gaze becoming calculating. He had a feeling that she wasn’t going to let this go.
“Yep... oh,” she said, resigned, rubbing her hand over her eyes.
Outside of their Arithmancy class he had a brief, silent squabble with Padma, before firmly seating himself next to Hermione. She froze in the process of taking a quill from her bag. He watched her coolly. Her frizzy curls were loose and full around her face today, but not one brown curl even twitched until Draco started to calmly remove his own things from his bag. She huffed out a little sigh and pulled out her completed homework. He didn’t know if she’d expected him to start yelling, but he ignored her until Professor Vector was finished outlining their winter project for the holidays.
Never had the sex life of a student been so closely documented.
Potter hadn’t let go of the Ravenclaw boy and was bringing his fist back to hit him again, when the other boy got an arm around Potter’s neck, wrenching him away and down.
Pansy and Blaise were both watching Potter like they had front row seats to the most fascinating play in town. Draco was staring at his coffee like it would tell him the secrets of success. He really didn’t know what to think about the exchange.
Draco snorted. He was unsure why Potter had started this, but he was certain that it wasn’t because he liked him. He would find out why. That was the main reason he’d agreed to go today.
“Don’t be ridiculous darling. It’s the body in the dress that drew her in.”
“I think I’m fine, but Potter is getting a verbal assassination from the Headmistress and the Minister,” he replied, as he kicked off his shoes and hung up his cloak.
Draco didn’t really know how to answer that, even though he had been expecting that sort of question. All the eighth years were obsessed with finding out what everyone’s plans were. Like it mattered what Draco’s plans were. He could make a million plans, but his options were not the same as his classmates. Hearing last week that the Minister had offered Potter any job he wanted had stung. He’d always be viewed with suspicion, so he couldn’t just get any job.
“Speaking of Weasley’s...?” he said slowly, meeting Justin’s eyes across the room.
The eighth year Ravenclaws gaped at the unlikely group, but Finch-Fletchley blithely offered jovial greetings to anyone within earshot and got on with buttering some toast. He then continued to describe to Draco a muggle sport called ‘fencing’ that Draco thought sounded a bit ridiculous. He sat opposite Finch-Fletchley and MacMillan, and reached for the coffee pot. He noticed Granger sitting alone at the end of the table with her head in a book. He was struck again with how unusual the behaviour of the Golden Trio had been. A quick glance up and down confirmed that Potter was absent, but there was still plenty of time left for breakfast.
“Why can’t you do that?” Potter asked.
He was getting more annoyed with her by the second and he couldn’t fully grasp why. He only knew that he felt viscerally opposed to being social.
“You saw that huh?” he said tightly.
“Go on Pans, I’ll see you next year,” he said softly, with a grin.
“It works for me.”
He’d been banned from the library in Malfoy Manor until he was 14, and even then he had restricted access. He’d had his own books in his room, any he’d wanted, but the family books were off limits. He liked to pretend that his father went in there to read a collection of trashy romance novels, but deep down he knew there was a darker reason he wasn’t allowed.
“It doesn’t matter Pansy! No one is going to care.”
“I thought you were spite personified, you can’t be both Pansy baby.”
He wished he could remember the event she described, but knowing he had met his aunt, however briefly, was oddly comforting.
“Don’t feel like you have to Hermione, Blaise won’t let any go to waste. He drinks like a grindylow,” Draco reassured her, sliding the trays onto the table and unloading the full glasses.
“I was just in the hospital wing, there was a small accident at quiddich practice,” Weasley replied slowly, still looking between Lovegood and Draco as though she were trying to figure out a puzzle that had a missing piece.
They stared at him, and he fidgeted in his chair.
“Oh, I have no idea,” he said airily, like it was no big thing, “I thought I did, but so much has changed.”
Ravenclaw Patil was up next. She looked flushed and nervous, biting her lip.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy raised her eyebrows at him when he sat back down.
Pansy rolled her eyes.
She pulled another, much larger jar from her other pocket and handed it to him.
She looked up at him with round eyes.
Lovegood gasped, reaching her hands out to clutch at Weasley’s shoulders.
“They live in water so one would assume that they do, or at least absorb water through their skin,” he answered thoughtfully.
Draco made a mental note to tell Pansy that Ravenclaw Patil was flushed and looking at her lap.
Draco looked up at her with a small relieved smile.
“Sooo... there’s a party tonight apparently. Are you both going?” he tried lamely.
Potter was chuckling as the starters arrived. Draco was trying to contain how thrilled he was at having made Potter laugh.
“You don’t have to know, it just is,” he said softly. “Have you tried talking to her about how you feel?”
“Well Malfoy? What is it?”
“Well you best get it done, you might be busy this weekend,” she said, smiling wickedly.
“Maybe,” she said so quietly that Draco almost missed it.
“You should be in a double cell with your pathetic Death Eater father Malfoy. You shouldn’t be allowed to walk around free with all of us,” sneered a sixth year Gryffindor, grabbing a handful of Draco’s hair and wrenching his head back.
“So what happened?”
“Connie Cuffe! That sly bitch,” Brown ground out.
Granger kept looking up from her work and glancing between Draco and Luna with a quizzical expression. He could tell she was burning with curiosity as to what they were doing together. Eventually the curiosity won, and she put down her quill.
Slowly, he flipped his arm over in his lap.
“Miles Beckett has graciously left his senior Auror position to become our new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.” The wizard beside Amelia Smith gave a curt nod to a second round of applause, and Draco briefly wondered if the position was still cursed now the Dark Lord was gone.
Draco rolled his eyes. Blaise was well aware of this. He still preened like the peacock he was before standing to leave again.
“Get into the bed Potter,” Draco instructed gently.
Draco slid closer to her on the bench and pulled her against him, putting his arm around her. She leaned into him, hiding her face.
“Your concussion. Drink up.”
“Do you have game with any other girls?” Draco asked innocently.
They walked into the Hall and up to the eighth year table side by side. Several students turned to stare at them in confusion. When they reached the table, Granger nodded at him and went to sit next to Weasley, who was staring at her incredulously. Draco dithered for a second before going to sit with Justin and his friend Hannah Abbott.
Pansy glanced quickly at Draco, and then back up to Blaise.
As she fussed with her bag, he glanced up and saw Padma watching her from across the common room, an unbearably soft look on her face. He gave a small wave, and she flushed. He didn’t want to get up any hopes that she would be able to sort her family problems out over the holidays, but he wished for a Christmas miracle anyway. For Pansy’s sake.
“Uh huh,” hummed Beckett calmly.
Pansy lamented drunkenly for a full half hour about what it could mean. Draco felt drowsy, but he let her ramble. Merlin only knew how many times she’d listened to his drunken monologues.
He was still feeling too raw and his mind was immediately sucked into awful memories. The Dark Lord’s taunts. Aunt Bella’s raging tantrums. Mad punishments for being related to traitors and monsters, as though he had any control over it. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, forcing himself back to the present, pressing his nails into the flesh of his palms. He did feel ashamed for consciously never thinking about that baby, but he hadn’t thought he’d needed to. His cousin was better off without him.
Draco stared at him, before turning on his heel and walking tiredly back into his room. He climbed back onto his bed and sat cross-legged in the middle of the mattress. Potter stood uncertainly in the doorway, before following Draco inside. He glanced around the room with interest, quirking a small smile at Justin’s posters.
They sat quietly for a minute, lost in their own thoughts, before he turned back to her.
“Thanks for noticing Weasley. Have you come dressed as a baby lesbian?” he shot back just as sweetly.
Potter looked away, and suddenly he seemed upset. He started pacing again, away from Draco.
Nothing.
Draco stared at her, before rolling his eyes, chuckling a little himself at the thought.
“Aren’t you usually the one with a diabolical plan?” Potter said, and Draco winced.
Ernie MacMillan was lounging on a sofa in the common room when they got downstairs. He shot to his feet when he saw Draco and his face contorted into the same suspicious squint as Longbottom. Finch-Fletchley tugged Draco forward by the arm and he realised he had stilled under MacMillan’s scrutiny.
Draco looked up to see sadness flash across Potter’s face, before he forced a blank expression.
“I’m sorry,” she burst out, as soon as they were deep within the shelves.
Blaise’s handsome face was crestfallen as he sipped his coffee.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ummmm... what I mean is, it was a set up,” he forced himself to continue, “That man in the pub said all manner of horrible things to Potter with the purpose of getting a reaction out of him. He was working with the camera man.”
“How did you come to that conclusion? Just stop acting like a slutty alcoholic with a death wish,” he gasped incredulously.
“Never have I ever... lost my virginity to a Weasley.”
“Fine... there’s not a lot to tell really. I’d had a crush on him from afar for a few years, but then in fifth year I joined the DA and I got to spend so much more time with him.”
“To answer your question, sort of?” Justin hummed thoughtfully, “Everyone else seemed to know before I really did, but I’ve always just been me. When I told my parents they pretty much said ‘we know’ and carried on with breakfast.”
Theo looked confused by the question.
Potter flushed, looking down at his hands on the table, and Draco regretted saying anything when he saw the dejected look on his face. They were silent again.
“It’s possibly the best thing I’ve ever eaten,” said Potter very seriously.
He tipped her off his lap and onto the floor, where she struck a dramatic pose and cried loudly, “How dare you treat your lover in such a manner,” before dissolving into further laugher. People all over the common room looked over at them in confusion. Draco just smiled down at her, happy to see her happy, before he slid off the chair to sit cross legged next to her on the floor. She stopped laughing and lay on her back, looking deep in thought before she screwed her face up and craned her neck around to look at him.
He wondered if he should try and get Potter out of his jeans, but thought it was probably safer not to.
“Why on earth didn’t you silence your curtains?” Pansy sighed. She and Draco knew how much Blaise valued “beauty sleep".
Justin slid into the booth with a bright exclamation of greeting. Pansy followed him silently, shooting very obvious glances at Padma.
When Justin had laughed himself into exhaustion, he stayed sprawled on his bed and watched Draco curiously.
“Ginger Newt,” she said clearly, and the gargoyle sprang aside.
“I’m well aware. I shared a room with you for 7 years,” Draco reminded him icily, “What do you want me to do about it? I’m not going to come and put you to bed every night to do it for you.”
When the waiter cleared the bowls away, Potter leaned back in his chair.
“Well obviously I don’t,” he shot back pugnaciously.
He wanted to know about this brave woman who had grown up like he had, but had managed to leave the Malfoy restrictions behind her and carve out her own life.
He read the letter calmly over his omelette and black coffee, finishing with an eye roll so exaggerated they could probably see it over at the Hufflepuff table.
“Of course old boy. I’m a locked vault,” he answered, trying to straighten his face so as not to seem too interested.
The last week of lessons before Christmas break flew by.
“Ginny! What are you doing here?” she rushed out, looking down at Weasley and going a little bit pink.
There was an awkward silence.
He climbed up onto his bed with Pansy, and she immediately crawled into his lap.
It was too late to pretend to not be here now.
Potter was mostly quiet, just chatting to Luna and Hermione, and helping Blaise to polish off the tray of shots. He spun the small empty glasses on the table top absently.
It was also empty.
Draco sprang out of his seat and dragged her along with him, pulling her away from the now much busier common room and into the deserted stairwell.
Pansy coughed across the table and muttered, “Hello pot, it’s kettle.”
Her mouth was open in a small o of shock.
Brown gave a sudden shriek of joy when the song changed and the music got louder. She grabbed Patil and starting to dance aggressively. Pansy laughed and joined in, dragging Draco with her. Neither of them had any clue what was so particular about this song, but the beat was intoxicating and Draco was dancing before he even realised. Other people crowed into the space that had been cleared in the common room to join in, and Draco was quickly sandwiched between Pansy and Blaise, laughing and letting the music wash through him. The song changed but they kept dancing. Draco twirled Pansy around to a song about ‘common people’, and ‘saw the sign’ with Justin bopping around him.
“You poor old thing. Do you want us to take you up to the hospital wing? I had a cousin who was having dizzy spells and it turned out he had a parasite in his brain that he picked up in South America. Mother forbade me from ever visiting a third world after that.”
“You know, I can buy my own booze,” Potter muttered, drumming his fingers against the edge of the bar. His fingernails were black and gold, chipped along the edges. Draco briefly wondered how many colours of nail varnish Potter owned, and if he painted them himself. He just couldn’t picture Potter painting his own nails for some reason.
The sound Potter made when he tried a spoonful went to the top of the list of Draco’s favourite things. Potter didn’t seem aware of anyone else in the room as he inhaled half the bowl, and then looked up a little guiltily as though remembering that Draco was there.
“Too harsh Draco. We all lost someone. You’re not the only one who misses Vince.”
“You could do essays in bed. You have enough books up here in your mini library,” Justin smirked, glancing over at Draco’s overflowing bookshelves.
“All you need is positivity!”
He’d be full to bursting with half a potions cabinet at this rate. He downed it quickly. This potion tasted refreshingly like peppermint. His headache receded to nothing and he stopped feeling dizzy.
“Well some of us like to be social, and not drink alone in the dark. Don’t be a bore Draco, it’s Halloween! The seventh years have been invited this time as well, so it’ll be much more lively.”
“Girl Weasley I mean, you like her.”
“Well, I didn’t have much choice. My father believes that any wizard who can’t speak Greek and Latin isn’t trying hard enough. He also made me learn Gaelic. The French and Italian were just for fun.”
The world outside the window was white and grey. Snow fell thickly from a steely sky. He couldn’t tell what time it was.
Not really familiar with any muggle music.
Everyone sat in silence for a moment.
He woke up in the grey light of morning, covered in blankets, Pansy still wrapped around him. He lay still for awhile, listening to her breathe and mutter in her sleep. He dozed in and out, but the dim light remained the same every time he opened his eyes. Eventually he had to get up, so he slid out of Pansy’s grasp. She huffed in her sleep and rolled over, murmuring about peanut butter pancakes. Draco smirked.
“Pansy baby, why don’t you kick us off?”
Blaise looked surprised.
There was Potter too, he reminded himself with a mental shudder.
“Yes, sorry, I don’t know what came over me,” he said, not meeting Potter’s gaze, “It probably won’t make any sense, but... bad memories.”
Draco looked over to see Potter was on his feet again, his arms wrapped around Hermione, getting streaks of blood all over her pale blue jumper. His hands were shaking.
He didn’t want to think that she was involved with this, but he knew that she must know about his stupid crush on Potter. He didn’t hide it very well. Maybe she had mentioned it, and Potter had decided to pull this stunt for his own amusement.
Potter was grumbling to himself as Draco pulled back his blankets, and forced Potter to sit on the edge of the bed. He picked up one of the discarded mugs, vanished the contents, and cast a quick scouring charm over it, before filling it with water from his wand. He pushed the mug into Potter’s hands, and crouched down to take off his boots.
Draco blushed from embarrassment, his face hot.
“You can call me Draco, if you want Finch-Fletchley?”
The Headmistress stood slowly from her chair, her gaze locked on Potter, her eyebrows raised in imperious disapproval.
“Never have I ever done something I regret, that hurt people,” said Potter flatly.
“That was my estimation as well Headmistress,” supplied Beckett, with an impressed nod at Draco.
She shoved him.
“Stop being difficult,” he muttered.
Draco thought the overall effect was quite charming. The only draw back in his opinion, was the shelf that ran around the circumference of the restaurant, just above head height (for most people, for Draco it was at eye level, which might be why he took so much issue with it). Displayed on the shelf were countless little wooden carvings of dragons, in various poses. He’d found out a while ago that the owner of the restaurant made them, and was very proud to show off his work. Monsieur Scintille cared about three things: his wooden dragons, his head chef Raphael, and bringing French Cuisine to a tiny Scottish village.
“This doesn’t change anything Pans” he said, meeting her eyes finally. “I just want to get through this year.”
“It’s not completely hopeless. I’ve been doing research on memory charms, and I’ve written to a few experts in the field. Unfortunately the mind is a tricky thing, and my original spell went quite deep,” she indicated the stack of books beside her, and Draco saw they were all focused on the study of the mind.
He sat up with a start.
“What happened Draco? I heard a bang, and then a lot of bangs.”
“No games tonight then?” Draco half shouts back.
Pansy threw a sugar cube at each of them. One of them hit Draco on the shoulder, but Luna caught the other and popped it into her mouth with a grin.
“I don’t know.”
In the end they picked out straight, dark grey jeans tucked into brown leather boots, with a tailored white shirt layered under a caramel coloured cashmere jumper.
“Never have I ever popped a surprise boner in Transfiguration over Professor McGonagall,” Finnigan said gleefully.
They both heard the soft footsteps heading towards them at the same time, and looked up. As though he had been summoned, Potter appeared around the corner. When he saw the pair of them on the floor he paused, but he didn’t look surprised.
As though reading his mind, Potter continued, “I don’t get a lot of letters from her, so that was unusual enough, but all it said was to please come as soon as possible, and that she needed to talk to me urgently. All I could think was that something had happened to Teddy, which is my only excuse for tearing out of here and not leaving you a message or anything.”
He glared at her, but that only made her smile wider.
“Good to know.”
He stared at it.
Draco whipped back to look at him, his eyebrows raised in quiet outrage. Before he could open his mouth, he saw that his reaction caused a flash of triumph to burn deep in Potter’s eyes.
“None of this is in any way your fault. If you want to blame someone, I’d recommend the Dark Lord. You know, the guy with an inferiority complex who started a war.”
A day late sorry, but this chapter is extra long so please forgive me. I didn't want to cut off mid date so I just kept going. I warned you it would take a while to get there, but we finally have some fake boyfriends, hurrah ~Kisses~
Draco lay very still, listening to the sounds of the two boys as they left the room, and then waiting a bit longer in case Blaise changed his mind and came back.
The three of them made it up to the forth floor in a clump. Draco was really starting to hurt, and not just from his leg.
“Hermione, let’s not talk about this now,” Potter said wearily. “You could actually talk to me any time, if the child over there let’s you that is,” he looked pointedly at Weasley.
“So it’s true then. You two are related?”  she asked bluntly.
“No way. Maybe this is an incentive for you to actually practice silencing charms.”
“Look,” Potter started again, “I came to find you to ask if you wanted to go out with me on Saturday... so I can apologise?”
I take an enormous amount of hilarious joy in thinking about Draco and Luna walking around the castle looking like the creepy twins from The Shining, with long blonde hair. This chapter was important to me because I really want to make sure Draco is fully on his path to redemption before anything happens between him and Harry. So sue me... or don’t because I have no money, but I can offer you another party in the next chapter instead. ~Kisses~
“I don’t blame you Draco. It wasn’t your choice to keep me there, and there was very little you could have done.”
He stood over Potter to make sure he drank all the water, then he refilled the mug and put it beside the bed. Potter looked drowsy now. His blinks were slow, his eyes staying closed for longer periods of time.
“I’m working on Ron,” she said quietly, the fake cheer gone from her voice.
“Are we disturbing you Malfoy?” she asked politely.
Her eyes had widened in panic and she cut him off quickly.
“I believe she’s down in Lavender’s room,” he answered, as Pansy seemed to have been broken.
“What happened anyway?” Draco asked boldly. Those three cocktails might have been stronger than he thought.
This was definitely an argument they’d had before.
“But why would Malfoy...?” Brown started, but Daphne cut her off quickly.
Luna gave Potter a stern look.
There was an awkward silence. Potter picked his menu up again, stared at it like it was something offensive, then looked back up at Draco.
“Well I’m not going if Padma is, it’ll be weird.”
On Saturday morning he woke up early as he always did, but this time he cursed his internal alarm clock. He didn’t need the hours and hours stretching ahead of him to fret. He stayed in bed, trying to go back to sleep to kill some time, willing himself to have a lie in just once. To channel Pansy’s affinity for sleep.
“No! What?” Potter said shakily, “Nothing... I...”
“Now go forth and embarrass yourselves!” he cried, downing his shot, causing several heads to turn their way. They all followed suit, tipping the burning spirit down and coughing roughly.
She sat quietly for a moment, amazed.
“Does Potter really leave the castle at night?” he asked without any preamble.
Hermione was avoiding him. He did really want to be mad at her for not explaining what was going on herself, but then he had been the one to tell her not to take responsibility for everything Potter did.
She nodded and smiled shyly at him, a genuine smile, and he felt the last of the numbness from the night before bleed away.
“Were you sleeping?” Potter asked, curiously.
“And you thought this year wasn’t going to be any fun.” He forced out a laugh, hiding his face by looking through his bag for a book. Any book.
There was absolute silence in the Hall. Students and teachers bowed their heads respectfully, and Draco tried very hard not to think. Not to think about his father in Azkaban, not to think about his mother all alone, not to think about Vince being swallowed by flames. After a few minutes McGonagall looked up with a sad smile and cleared her throat.
“Malfoy, stop running away,” Potter huffed.
“Would have saved time if you’d just talked to me,” he muttered.
“Don’t think you’re getting out of this. All the eighth years will be there. It’s a welcome back celebration.”
“No, no, let’s keep going. I’m sorry Ginny but Draco’s broken his leg and he needs to see Madam Pomfrey right away.”
He rubbed his temples.
“You could say that.”
“I’m not giving you the gory details,” he said coyly. “It was a thing that happened. George can be an incredibly serious person, but only about 2% of the time, so it didn’t last. I don’t have any regrets about it. I think that’s the most important thing. I just wish that Ron didn’t know. He’s so squeamish about his family.”
She blinked.
She fixed his leg first with a very complicated incantation, and he was a little relieved he hadn’t attempted it himself. The relief from the sudden lack of pain was almost sickening, his stomach unclenching when he hadn’t even realised it was. He hadn’t registered how much pain he had been in until it was gone.
Blaise smiled and returned to his melon slices. Luna was staring at Pansy with wide, panicked eyes.
“Butterbeers are not conducive to the evenings festivities,” Blaise continued, pointing to the only drinks on the table. “What will everyone be having? The first round is on Draco.”
“Wow,” he said with a smile, “that’s really... cool.”
“No one ever does, especially not reporters,” she muttered darkly.
“How is it possible that he doesn’t realise how massively queer we both are?” she gasped incredulously to Draco in between chuckles.
“Errrrggh fine!” he ground out, and she relaxed.
The longer the ceremony went on, the louder Potter’s circle was getting. They banged their cutlery and performed little Mexican waves as each tiny new Gryffindor stumbled their way to the table. It didn’t take long for Draco to figure out why when he saw the flash of a silver flask being passed from Finnigan to Potter.
How did people even make friends anyway? Knowing Pansy since birth didn’t really count.
“Ernie, you remember Malfoy I’m sure. He'll be joining us this morning,” Finch-Fletchley said as though he were introducing them at a garden party.
“I have no idea how the Gryffindor’s and Ravenclaw's lived in towers for the last 7 years. These stairs might kill me. At least it explains why Patil has such a spectacular arse.”
Finch-Fletchley was impressed with the plaits. After a bit of begging, he sat on Draco's bed and wiggled around excitedly while Draco crafted two French plaits out of his messy curls, joining them up at the back. In return Finch-Fletchley brushed glitter over Draco’s eyelids and cheekbones. In the end Finch-Fletchley decided on bright yellow dungarees over a sheer mesh vest. Even in his platform trainers he barely came up to Draco's shoulders. He shimmied around the room, making Draco laugh. The more time Draco spent with Finch-Fletchley, the more he genuinely liked him. Historically Draco had very little patience for nice people, but Finch-Fletchley was like a tiny ball of sunshine.
“I shouldn’t have said anything,” he said ruefully, finally putting the cigarette he had been playing with between his lips, and lighting it with his wand wordlessly, “I came over here to flirt with you and I’ve failed miserably.”
Finnigan and Blaise cracked up. Draco was impressed with all the pointed shots this evening.
“Well that’s a completely different story darling, but I think you’ll agree that both our families can go fuck themselves.”
Draco snorted.
He chuckled, making a mental note to warn Pansy that Hermione was holding a grudge.
Draco had all the same NEWT classes with the two girls, and he’d already made his peace with the fact that he’d never come top in any of them. When his father had been on the school’s board of governors he’d been furious to find out that Draco had been beaten in every class by a muggleborn. Every near impeccable test result had been met with scorn, and the occasional severe punishment, because he hadn’t managed to outrank Granger. He had hated her for it. More than the simple hate he had been taught to have for all muggleborns, Granger had seemed like a personal thorn in his side.
Honestly Draco had so many other things to worry about, like making it through the school year alive, the right time might be a while off.
“I don’t want to fake break up,” he said softly, smiling crookedly through his sadness, “I do really need this Draco. I promise I’ll try to do better. I want to be better.”
“What the fuck Potter?” he gasped.
Potter stuck his cigarette between his lips, and shrugged into his leather jacket. It was a little too big for him, but he wore it well. They hurried up the slope to the edge of the village, catching up with the Professor’s.
He’d just settled in bed with a book, when Justin shot back into the room looking giddy. Draco looked up at him startled.
“Hit it off? With Potter? Where have you been for the last seven years Hermione?”
Longbottom threw a cushion at him.
“Well I don’t mind telling you that I slept with Fred in fifth year,” said Turpin calmly. Weasley stared at her, stunned.
His nervous behaviour was making Draco anxious. He gritted his teeth, breathing deeply through his nose.
Madam Pomfrey whisked a curtain around the bed he was leaning against.
Potter collapsed backwards onto the mattress, still half off the bed. He didn’t move again, and after a moment he started to snore softly.
“That’s not my problem. That’s not what I wanted. I gave up everything to win the war, and I’m not doing it again,” he said hotly, completely unconcerned that he was half shouting at the most powerful man in wizarding Britain.
“I’m on Tracey's team!” Daphne demanded, “I’m not playing against her and her Chaser aim.”
Draco held up his hands in surrender.
“Yes, I believe so. I had zero plans besides my potions essay.”
Justin bumped his shoulder against Draco gently, an amused smile on his face.
Draco, who had talked about his day with Justin while giving him a French plait the night before, huffed a laugh at the mental image of Theo and Potter doing the same. He turned and tugged a copy of the Prophet out of Tracey’s hands, ignoring her cry of annoyance, and handed the front page to Theo. He scanned it, then frowned and read it more carefully. When he looked up his eyes were round with shock.
“Me too,” said Blaise grinning, and they high fived over Pansy’s head.
Then he’d met this scrawny boy, with enormous frightened green eyes, baggy clothes, and a smart mouth. It was rejection, and anger, and self doubt. It was throwing himself into the role he’d been born to play, and finding himself on the opposite side to his childhood hero.
She turned wide eyes on him, before grinning knowingly.
Draco rubbed his jaw, thinking how to say this.
He got out of the shower, dried himself with magic, and pulled on his pale grey pyjama bottoms and black t-shirt. He was officially beyond exhausted.
Potter was late.
There was an awkward silence as Draco moved into the room, looking around. The purple theme had been continued into the dorm rooms it seemed. Unlike his dark mahogany four poster in the dungeons with it’s green and silver hangings and snake carvings, this four poster was a lighter, honey coloured wood with flowers carved to climb up the posts. The curtains and bed spread were both deep purple, with cream sheets, and pillows piled up. It looked very comfy and Draco was suddenly very tired. His black and silver trunk looked out of place at the foot of the bed. There was a wardrobe and a set of drawers to one side, and a desk under a window. Draco was caught up for a moment starting out of the window at the dark forest and the thousands of stars clear in the sky. He was so used to the greenish black oppression of the lake through his room windows in the dungeon.
“Do you think there will be any more games?” he asked hopefully.
The more time he spent with Padma, the more he wanted to meddle. She would be a great match for Pansy. He loved Pansy dearly, but along with all her wonderful qualities he knew she was high maintenance, impulsive, brash, and sometimes mean. Padma was patient, gentle, and easy going, but he’d also seen flashes of her steely core. She wouldn’t take any shit from Pansy, and she was quick witted enough to give as good as she got. He saw her mould around Granger’s strong personality, without diminishing or compromising herself.
His wild, unruly hair was long across the top of his head, but shaved around ears which were now studded with silver hoops and dangling chains. There was another silver ring through the dark slash of his eyebrow. His glasses were gone, and his fringe fell over one of his brilliantly green eyes.
“Spice Girls,” Draco corrected before he could stop himself, avoiding the fact that he would have just waited for Blaise had Finch-Fletchley not asked him.
“Don’t you remember? It was at some Ministry event. We must have been six or seven, all dressed up in our formal wear. The Lovegood’s were there. I only remember because Mr Lovegood got thrown out for accusing the Minister of some werewolf conspiracy cover up in front of everyone. You fell over when we were playing and skinned your knee. Pandora saw you fall and came to see if you were OK. She healed your graze and then she stole us both extra cake from the dessert table. Your mother came over though and dragged you off. I guess now we know why.”
“That’s bullshit. You should have hit them harder,” he said faintly.
“Paisley curtains.... nooooo,” Pansy snorted quietly in her sleep.
Central Tower had been almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Hogwarts, but it had been rebuilt better than before. When the password was spoken to the tapestry, it parted down the middle like a pair of curtains revealing a heavy wooden door. Beyond that a winding staircase led up to a large square common room, which was decorated in shades of cream and purple. McGonagall had really made an effort to ignore House colours. By the time Draco, Pansy, and Blaise made it up the tower most of their classmates had already dispersed, disappearing through an archway which seemed to lead up another staircase. Draco could hear the clamour of distant voices as people began to discuss the evening. Potter was no where to be seen.
Potter shrugged, and held out his arms by way of explanation. Blood was still slowly oozing from some of the deeper cuts.
He let out a deep breath, watching the stream of white mist that filled the air, and jumped when a large Eagle owl landed heavily on his shoulder. He grunted in pain as Ulysses dug his talons in to steady himself, and pulled at a chunk of Draco’s hair. He loved the owl dearly, but Ulysses was a bastard.
Draco’s blood ran cold. Without a thought he threw himself forwards, skidding on pieces of broken glass. He grabbed hold of Potter and dragged him backwards.
Draco felt stunned. He’d never registered that magical ability would be an abnormality for muggleborns. His father had always raged about how muggleborns were diluting magical bloodlines, and ruining proper wizarding society. He’d never thought about the potential life which was taken away from a muggleborn when they found out who they really were. Everything they thought they would have in their future, everything their parents had hoped for them, all gone. Would Justin have preferred to live the life which had been expected of him, if he could choose?
Patil looked up too, surprised, and glanced between Draco and Granger with a worried frown.
“You’re doing Charms right? Want to meet up in the library later and compare notes on atmospheric magic?” he asked gently.
“I’m sure. I didn’t believe him myself at first. I thought it was a strange attempt to torment me, but he didn’t seem to care if I believed him or not. He looked at me like he’d seen a ghost. I look a lot like my mum. Over the summer I confronted my dad about it. He said Mum hadn’t wanted me to know about her family, so he had honoured her wishes. I wanted you to know. Its just been me and Dad since I was 9, I’ve never had any extended family before.”
Blaise looked at him coolly, looked around the table at everyone’s half full glasses, and back at Draco. He met Blaise’s scowl in flinty silence.
“Honestly, I don’t mind,” muttered Draco, “I owe you enough as it is.”
Draco lost track of time, but after a while Blaise pulled him over for another shot and another glass of the blue cocktail. Draco was feeling pleasantly fuzzy. Judging by the volume of people’s voices and the goofy smiles on a few faces, he wasn’t alone. Blaise was looking around with a satisfied smirk. He’d had more to drink than Draco but he had an amazingly high tolerance for alcohol. Drinking was practically a sport in Slytherin.
The only time Pansy broke her resolve and asked him to speak to Patil for her, he told her emphatically that he would not be put in the middle. In all honesty he probably would speak to Padma. The whole situation was getting ridiculous, and he could tell that Pansy was upset because Parvati wasn’t speaking to her either.
“Draco people don’t trust any of us right now, and we haven’t given them any reason to. We acted out of fear last year, but we’re already braver just by coming back. I know I’ve done a lot of terrible things, but I’ve grown up and realised that people aren’t so easy to predict. How are they supposed to know that you’ve changed unless you show them?”
“Harry, just leave it,” he breathed.
“W... what?” she stuttered, shooting her gaze quickly at Luna and then away.
Draco didn’t know if he was dreading the idea of another party, or just dreading all the extra people that would be in the common room. Whoever had thought about inviting the seventh years shouldn’t be allowed to have any more ideas. The only silver lining was that he would get to spend the evening with Luna.
Seeing Snape in the Headmaster’s chair the previous year had been jarring, but seeing McGonagall in the same seat didn’t seem so strange. There were several new faces at the faculty table. A strikingly beautiful black woman was seated beside McGonagall, her curls bouncing as she laughed with Professor Flitwick. Further along the table a serious looking older wizard with a full dark beard and long salt and pepper hair was in deep discussion with a plump young woman whose cropped hair was almost as blonde as Draco’s own.
MacMillan groaned as he was forced to drink.
“I don’t know if I... if I am... am...” Luna fumbled.
“I... That’s... This has nothing to do with me!” he stammered. “I just think you should be a little more sensitive to the fact that Justin still likes you. It’s cruel.”
He hummed thoughtfully.
Justin hummed.
“There’s going to be a party,” Pansy declared, when she caught him coming back into the common room from the library.
“Go ahead Lav,” said Weasley gruffly.
“Get the fuck out of this school Malfoy, or I’ll force you out.”
“I can speak six languages Potter.”
Longbottom narrowed his eyes at Draco  and his chest tightened. He wasn’t ready for this confrontation just yet. After seeing Longbottom hack the head off that foul snake, Draco found him rather more intimidating. He tried to look innocent, but he needn’t have worried as Longbottom didn’t do anything. He watched them as they descended the stairs, but let them go without a word.
“It will with that attitude. Try to be positive,” she said cheerfully, poking him.
“Drink that water,” he commanded without looking up.
Hermione squirmed a little uncomfortably, but she tried to sound cheerful.
“Oh, that could be fun,” Tracey piped up, craning her neck to look over at Thomas cheering while Brown chugged back whatever was in the glass.
“I highly doubt that,” Draco scoffed.
Draco threw the sugar cube back at him, but Blaise lifted his paper as a shield, laughing.
“She’s mixing it up this time, he’s some rich muggle so he’s no idea who she is. She wants his penthouse in Manhattan. She doesn’t have any property in America yet.”
Potter had snorted derisively at the mention of Draco’s father. Draco gritted his teeth, and huffed quietly.
Then he remembered the comments that had been made about Potter in the Daily Prophet, and in the Headmistress’s office last week. Potter relaxed slightly at his response. He bit his lip as his eyes moved from the wine list and away, around the restaurant.
“Yes,” he said simply, and she squinted at him, annoyed.
“Would you go as a favour to me?” she asked sweetly.
He slid an arm around her to steady her. When Pansy was drunk, she lost all ability to control her volume, or her limbs.
She frowned.
“What are you talking about?”
“Why wouldn’t you Draco? It’s just one date. You never know? You might hit it off,” she said optimistically.
Draco stared at her, impressed.
She couldn’t avoid him in class though.
“I told Blaise it was nothing,” he said hurriedly. “I tripped, that’s all, being clumsy. Blaise doesn’t need to go all mother hen on me.”
“What do you mean?”
Granger was watching him thoughtfully, but he bent back over his work, not wanting to push his luck.
Draco kicked her under the table.
“I care,” she said sadly, “who was it?”
“It’s like 8pm,” Potter sounded mystified why anyone would be in bed so early.
Draco could see in his eyes that he knew what the question would be.
Ooooooo shoot and a miss Hazza ~Kisses~
Potter’s eyes widened slightly, his gaze shifting over Draco’s face.
Draco laughed. He told Potter everything he knew about Monsieur Scintille and his dragon obsession.
“Don’t forget infuriatingly smart,” sniggered Draco.
He’d grown up in a family run by hatred and fear, where all that mattered was the perfect persona they showed to the world. Their fragile power was built on the assumption that they were better than everyone else, and anything which threatened to pull back the curtain and reveal the bullshit must be stamped out quickly.
Potter looked away.
“I mean is she ashamed of me?” she asked a half listening Draco in horror.
“What?” said Blaise loudly.
“Well if you change your mind, you’re welcome at any time. Even if we’re half way through Christmas dinner. Especially half way through dinner, can you imagine my mother’s face. Priceless. That would make Christmas for me,” she rambled, still hugging him.
He glanced over at his desk. There was one thing he needed to do, which he’d been putting off.
The evidence of that was embarrassingly obvious.
Her calm, steady gaze watched him carefully.
The Minister regarded him coolly, standing at his full height.
After sending the letter and grabbing a light breakfast, he headed back to his room. He needed to start the long, agonising process of choosing what to wear.
“There’s nothing wrong with waiting for the right time for you Draco,” said Justin kindly.
“Right, sorry. Hmmmm... Sources inside Hogwarts have confirmed that Potter has been spotted with no less than 9 boys since the start of the school year in September. Unconfirmed rumours suggest that number to be higher. Potter is frequently absent from the castle at night, skips his classes, and is often drunk and disorderly. At a recent party on school property, Potter reportedly beat two seventh year boys senseless in an unprovoked attack.
“In this made up hypothetical situation that will never happen, of course not baby,” Blaise said, still looking confused.
Hermione and Padma chipped in their opinions, while Pansy just looked confused.
“Blaise, would you be ashamed to kiss me?” Pansy demanded right back.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wanted Potter fiercely. He wanted to know him, know all the dark corners of him. He wanted to be with him.
Potter frowned and moved towards him, but Draco planted his hands on Potter’s chest and pushed him back again.
“Can I please, please, write to your father and tell him what excellent use the Malfoy fortune is being put to?” Pansy asked sweetly.
The room was as disgusting as it had been the last time he’d been in there.
As Pansy shoved him up the step onto the train, Draco glanced back again. Potter was in the same spot, and Draco briefly wondered why he was stood alone. Surely Granger and Weasley were returning to Hogwarts as well.
Draco had never realised that watching someone eat a French pudding could be a kink he had, before now.
“Why are you beautiful people hiding in the corner?” he demanded.
When he was about to leave, Justin gripped his hand, stopping him before he reached the door.
“George Weasley is gay?” Draco said shrilly, before he realised he sounded like Pansy and coughed a little.
“There’s nothing to get your wand in a knot over Pans. We’ve talked a few times, we study and we work really well together. She’s just trying to move forwards.” Draco replied huffily.
She gave him a little wave, and moved over to sit with Weasley. He immediately engaged her in intense conversation, gesticulating wildly with his sandwich while she calmly sipped pumpkin juice. Draco could guess what he was worked up about.
Weasley made an aborted noise of protest. Granger had put her hand on his leg. He sat back looking petulant.
Draco was very sure that Finch-Fletchley was not happy to see him. He’d heard that the muggle born boy had been forced to flee the country last year to avoid being arrested.
Blaise turned to his left, smirking evilly.
There were a few nervous titters and blushes as people felt the effects of the spell compelling them to tell the truth.
Draco thought his heart might have stopped, before he realised what Potter was saying.
Technically there hadn’t been much for the Ministry to charge his mother with. She never took the mark. She wasn’t a Death Eater, and it wasn’t a crime to be married to one. She’d only been allowed in meetings which happened at her own house as a courtesy. She never hurt anyone, or took part in missions. She had been following her husbands wishes, and trying to do what she thought was best to keep her son safe. She’d been arrested along with Draco after the final battle, both of them confined to Malfoy Manor under guard. While the Ministry fumbled around trying to find something they could convict Narcissa Malfoy for, Harry Potter had come forward to say that without Narcissa’s help, he would never have been able to defeat the Dark Lord.
“It won’t be weird, you should come! Go out, get some drinks. I bet Blaise will come, and Justin, you like Justin,” he said quickly, attempting to distract her.
“That was amazing,” he said dreamily.
Pansy was dithering about in her underwear, stuck between a silky navy slip dress and a black velvet mini dress. Draco had already told her he preferred the navy, but she liked the black, so he was ignoring her monologue about fabrics and flicking through an old copy of Witch Weekly, when there was a knock at the door. Before either of them could react, the door swung open. Padma Patil stood in the doorway, her light brown skin flushed with warmth as she zeroed in on Pansy, who was mostly naked.
“That’s preposterous. Justin doesn’t like me. He’s the one that broke up with me!” he said indignantly.
Whatever he had been expecting Draco to do, it clearly wasn’t that. Finch-Fletchley’s firm expression softened in surprise, and then his manners kicked in automatically as he bounced forward to take Draco’s hand and shake it vigorously.
“Your girlfriend interrupted, and it was just getting interesting,” Potter said, squinting at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s grin widened. He was surrounded by hopeless queer girls.
“Well I...” Potter stuttered to a stop, clasping his hands together to still his fingers.
“You’re right. I’m sorry... again.”
“... and I cheated on him,” Blaise continued sheepishly, rubbing the back of his head.
“Please stop toying with me Potter,” he said tiredly, “What’s this really been about?”
He deflated instantly, the annoyance bleeding out as fast as it came. He sat down heavily in an armchair and covered his face with his hands.
“Charming,” he chuckled. “ At least it’s pretty clear that she fancies you. That should make you happy.”
“It wasn’t a planned look, I was just bored this morning and took out my frustrations on my head.”
Draco marvelled at how it had become so tense so quickly. Must be some sort of dating record.
Pansy laughed then.
“Oh yes, let’s celebrate,” Draco snipped, “Let’s celebrate that we’re not one of the 6 kids from our year who died.”
