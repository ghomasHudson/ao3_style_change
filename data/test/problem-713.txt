Both let out a puff of air as Draco leaned against a tree, searching for something. Something to piece everything together. Why did he want to do this? What made this relationship so important to him? He use to hate the git.
Draco was so focused on the substantial changes that he almost missed the long black fox ears hiding in Harry’s hair until they moved.
“You just left me after this?!” he gestured angrily at the collar, “After I protected you, saved you!” He closed his eyes trying to calm his boiling blood. “I understand you didn’t know what it was at the time, but after all these years? I thought you would have figured it out by now. I can't, I haven’t been able to do anything with my life because of this!”
Ghost seemed to roll his eyes and made a scoffing noise, like he couldn't believe Harry thought he was on that level.
That made LeFay laugh and he stepped away from Draco to lean on the door. He put a hand to his chin as he looked Draco up and down.
"I guess it's off to Professor Snape's office now," Harry stated softly as he stopped at the next corner. Draco looked up at him, confused for a moment.
“Lots of people have been saying that, even the last few days when I didn’t have the fox legs and tails, etc. I guess I can understand, but I mean, even people I really thought I was close to. I mean my dads didn’t seem to notice. But Hermione, Neville…,” he trailed off.
“Nice place you have here," Draco said aimlessly, "Cozy.”  Draco observed that two of the men had bright red eyes like the woman, while the third's were a dazzling blue. He headed over to the fire and knelt, warming up his hands.
"Your cold..." Draco mumbled, leaning away from Harry. Harry frowned and took his hand back as his single eye fell the barrier beneath them. "Why are you cold?" Draco's voice shook.
“I’m still going to have a tough time really settling into this new acceptance of who I’ve become, but I hope that you’ll be willing to ride this out with me,” he sighed. Suddenly Harry fell back, the large body behind him disappearing. He let out a soft grunt as the back of his head hit the grass, and he had a hard time seeing what was above him till a shadow fell over him.
Remus put the book aside and placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder as he stood up from the seat he'd taken. “I don’t know what to think, but I’m sure we’ll find out more at the will reading,” he stated in an uneasy tone.
"Sorry Ghost," Harry said, startling Ghost enough that he jumped. Harry stopped and leaned against the wall, smiling sadly. Ghost's ears flicked back and he turned his body to face Harry, tilting his head. "Herm and Ginny have gotten close since I broke up with Ginny, and it's," he trailed off, biting his lip. Ghost bumped his hand with his nose and then lightly grabbed it with his mouth before starting to pull on it. Harry actually smiled then and shook his head. "You probably don't care, your just wanting to eat," Harry chuckled. Ghost let go of Harry's hand then and bounded off a short ways, his mane bristled and tail wagging. Harry laughed rather loudly then and started jogging after the bounding albino striped hyena.
Harry let out a yelp as something solid ran into his side and caused him to fall into the wall. Still unused to his fox limbs he toppled over easily and hit the floor with a thud. Something other than Ammit landed on top of him and caused his breath to leave him. Harry was on the verge of blacking out when the heavy object rolled off him followed closely by the sounds of a very angry Ammit.
“You okay Charlie?” Bill asked as he stopped beside his brother and placed his hand on his shoulder.
Harry wrapped one arm around Ghost's neck, grateful for the warmth the albino creature provided. He was also grateful that the comfort the creature was offering felt true, not like when Hermione or Ron tried to comfort him. Though, he didn't blame them.
"Professor Snape and I have been discussing ways to keep you protected when neither of us are around, with Voldemort back, you need all the help you can get," he paused and motioned to the animal sitting in front of him, "With help from some contacts, Professor Snape has managed to find the perfect bodyguard."
"It wasn't what you thought you heard back there," LeFay added quickly after hearing the dragon scoff at him.
"Does it have to do with the man that came in earlier today?" one of the other table mates inquired.
“Now!” LeFay bellowed, his magic starting to form solid tendrils around him, “Cadmael, were is he?!”
Draco nodded and placed his mother’s shrunken chest with his own before following Kreacher down the hall. “Are our rooms close by?” Draco asked Kreacher while moving Bubo moved to his shoulder. The Eagle Owl eyed the house-elf as Kreacher turned to answer.
Draco's hand moved unconsciously to the collar at his neck while he spoke, “Anonymous tip about a vampire hive in the forest along with a picture. You really should be more careful, seems like you're getting a bit sloppy after six years,” Draco sneered. His gaze was fixed on a mirror hanging on the wall. In its reflection was Harry, as to be expected, but beside him was the creature from before. A massive shadow, which Draco now recognized as a Kitsune, with glowing green eyes that wanted to swallow him whole.
“Harry, what is it saying?” Bill asked as he stood up after making sure Severus, Charlie, and Sirius where all alright.
Harry woke the next day feeling highly refreshed as he stretched. Today was a new day, but a day he would have to do something about what happened yesterday. He had gone straight to his room after the Draco incident, both because he felt guilty and because he felt like Draco had agreed with the ambassadors. He hadn’t spoken to Sirius either. Well it wasn’t only his fault for not talking to Sirius, Sirius didn’t try to talk to him either.
The group walked towards the middle counter, glancing around as they went. It seemed like almost everyone in the wizarding world was here! “What can I help you three with today?” the counter goblin stated as he sneered down at them. Sirius cleared his throat and motioned Harry forward.
“Dragon, are you sure you want to? After all the others, I can’t stand seeing you come home again looking like that. You're going to hurt too much one of these times and... I'm worried for you,” his mother said, turning to him. She put her tea on the bench, a hollow look upon her face as she thought about all the suffering he was going through. "That collar-."
“I’m guessing you’re done chatting,” Draco muttered, glaring at Potter. Harry nodded slowly and then looked over at Theo, bowing slightly. Theo seemed surprised before looking back at Draco. “I’ll see you in class then Theo. Oh, who are you paired up with?” Draco asked, he hadn’t really thought about the fact Theo seemed to be by himself.
“Albus, he used me as a distraction, while I was contesting he planned on abducting the Blacks, including Lady Malfoy. He’s probably already got them by now,” he pleaded with LeFay, “Harry, I didn’t, I-.” Cadmael bowled over, his stomach cramping and his head feeling like it was going to tear apart. He dropped back to his knees, the chains holding him in place rattling.
The arrowhead pendant that acted as a master key to Draco’s collar felt heavy around his neck. He admitted that when he heard the collar hadn't shattered he'd felt a sense of pride but...
The man watched him, eyes narrowing in on Draco. Draco felt his blood run cold as he stared at the man, swallowing.
“Thank you Severus, for your insight.” LeFay said as he stood, pulling his robes in around him a bit tighter. “You’ll get a pass for today, I needed to hear what I needed to hear,” he stopped, biting his lip, “If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to go think on this, and I’m sure Draco will be happy to see you,” LeFay stated with a slight smile.
"Meet you're new partner in crime. Harry meet Ghost. Ghost, this is your charge, Harry James Potter."
,” Harry said, and Ammit nodded. Sirius came to the back of the store then and stopped in his tracks.
“So, that was three dress robes; two silk in pine green, one with black trim and the other with silver, and then one mix fabric in black. Then four long sleeve, two green, one red, and one black. Four short sleeves in a low v neck style, same colors, and eight pairs of jeans. Four of which are in a slim style and the other four in a boot leg cut,” she smiled, “I’ll make sure to get the measurements right so they fit your legs and don’t pull your fur. Now, last but not least your school robes and four shendyts.” Her smile grew bigger as she typed everything in. “I’m so glad you went with my suggestion on those. They will look absolutely great on you; the Egyptian pharaohs wore them all the time. Though I definitely suggest either going topless or wearing a thin tank top with them. That reminds me do you want to add anything like that?” she asked as she looked up at him. Harry blushed and nodded.
Groaning he let his face land on the desk, his hands moving up to rub the back of his head. He couldn’t get the stupid nightmare from last night out of his head. Six years and the events that day still haunted him. The creature, the ashes, him and the faceless Harry.
In one swift movement Draco had cut him off as he placed a kiss to LeFay's lips. He felt a shiver down his spine as he made contact, and arms wrapped around him; holding him tightly to Harry's body.
There was a bright green flash and Draco had to cover his eyes, yelling Potter’s name. The wind around him almost blew him over, his ears rung with the sheer force of it all.
"I think you're trying make me out to be more than I am," LeFay smirked, "You don't know what it was like."
Turning slightly to the left he saw it. A well beaten path cutting through the growth around him. Harry hoped down and jogged through the trees; the humming growing louder, and louder as he jogged down the path.
Harry lifted it too his eye, his mouth going slack when he did. A net of blue covered Draco the dragon, along with a few yellow-green, and red strings of magic. There was a purple and green twisted cord that lead from Harry to Draco as well and it drew his attention. He reached out to touch it but it simple faded through his hand. Harry handed the glass shard back to Charlie.
Severus stepped forward, pouring it into a thin cup and then tipping it to Cadmael’s mouth whole took it without too much hassle. He gagged a bit, growling quietly.
"Yes it is," he barely said above a whisper. "If I had listened and not left class by myself, if I'd taken up Theo and Herm's offer, none of this would have happened. You wouldn't have that damn thing around your neck, and you wouldn't be stuck with me. You'd be able to live your own life Draco."
Upon seeing Harry’s realization, and hearing blood start to race, Remus got down beside Harry and turned his face gently away from the mirror. “Hey, listen to me. There is nothing to panic about, you are still you," Remus said sternly while keeping eye contact with panicking fox-man, "What you are seeing is not permanent, it’s just that your magic went haywire and your creature side had to over compensate. The fact you had so many blocks on your magic just made the problem worse," he continued to explain slowly. He could feel Harry's pulse start to slow, "Once your creature inheritance settles the features won’t be as prominent, just like with Sirius." Remus gestured behind him to Sirius and his dog ears.
Harry nodded, more to himself than the voice. He laid down on the bed and sighed, starting the breathing exercise Hermione suggested.
“Wait, what are you doing?!” LeFay shouted weekly, Hisashi chuckled and flicked once of his tails in a shushing motion.
“Do you want us to walk with you back to your room. I mean since I’m guessing that’s where you were heading.”
"Well, everyone...Hermione. Maybe a little help here on what to do," Harry stated. He felt Tatsuya chuckled in his head and he scowled. "I mean you're an animagus too right?" he asked.
Charlie nodded slowly. “Yea I think so. The reaction to Harry as a Kitsune just startled me. I know a lot about dragons but not dragon wizards,” He sighed.
“Well, it looks like Harry might be the only one that can get close to him. I don’t know if that’s him recognizing you, or recognizing your kitsune side. So, it looks like you might be staying here with us,” Charlie stated as the group headed back to the camp fire. “Tomorrow, Remus and Sirius will take Parvati back to the school while we start working on figuring what exactly happened to cause this. Severus, you should stay. If he is recognizing people it’ll more than likely be you two that he’ll end up trusting most.”
Tom's nose wrinkled. "While you have a point, I think mine still stands. The have at least enough 'love' for each other to make you," he stated, making his own air quotes. "Honestly, I'm glad they did."
Harry sighed and then headed on his way. He was almost to the tower when he rounded the corner only to stop in his tracks as he spotted a group of people in the hallway. Quickly he hid behind the wall and then peaked around it to see what was going on.
However, these two stories will definitely be continuing and getting new chapters. Yay! When you might ask, well, as soon as possible really. Yet, this fanfiction piece did not have an outlined plot with it like my other one. So, it will probably be the harder one to pick back up, even with it only being 5 chapters long right now. I do want to get a chapter out on my other story first, because it's a month behind this one, before I work on the chapter for this one.
LeFay woke with an unfamiliar weight on his chest, a surge of fear sprinting through his body till he looked down at the other man's sleeping face. A small chuckled rose from his chest as he smiled down at Draco, shaking his head. He'd never thought this was how it was going to end up. He really hoped that Draco didn't end up taking back what he said.
Ammit hissed angrily as he got into striking position. Ammit was positioned half on top of Harry and half curled around him protectively. Harry on the other hand was just able to see Draco before Ammit lunged.
“Yes, but I don’t know what type… That’s one thing Sirius told me to work on while I’m here.” Harry smiled at Neville, the one friend that knew everything about him. Even more than Hermione and Ron. “What about you Luna, how are you?”
“Turning you in will make me rich!” Seamus stated as he pointed his wand at Harry. There was a loud boom behind him, causing Seamus to look up. The horror on Seamus’ face was the last thing Harry saw as something giant and black flew over him, knocking Seamus to the floor. Harry sighed, closing his eyes even as he tried to fight off the darkness.
“You don’t have to panic, he’s not dead. Just close to it, its paralysis spell I’d been working on that not only works on the body but the soul as well. Something that would hopefully work on magic resistant creatures like him and me,” Draco wheezed out between raspy coughs. With a lazy wave of his wand he reversed the spell as Cadmael sucked in a huge breath, coughing violently. “It has pretty bad side effects but he’ll live,” Draco told LeFay before turning his attention to the barely conscious beastman.
"Hmm, oh. That," he looked down at his arm and rubbed the bandage, smirking slightly. "Fine. I can now say that I've been bitten by an African beast though," he chuckled. There was a pause of silence as Tom inhaled, staring down at Harrison. "I'm guessing that Lucius has filled you in?" Draco nodded. "How are you doing? It wasn't just Harry that we'd lost there for a bit." Tom turned his gaze to Draco as he spoke.
Harry came to a stop, the look on the boys face worried him. He looked disgusted, fearful almost. Quickly he reached a hand to his face to try feeling what the boy was looking at and remembered how his skin felt. How it must look. Quickly he turned away from the boy, his lips pursing together. "Go away!" he sobbed, arms reaching around his shoulders. He couldn't bare that gaze.
Harry has to cope with the troubles of his knew appendages as well as the other many changes in his life, and shopping for a new familiar is one of them. Hopefully he can hold on till school starts, or there will be a lot more than just friction between his new family members.
Harry nodded and then made sure Ammit was safely snug around his shoulders and torso before moving. “Let’s go,” Harry said.
“Ahh, Lord LeFay, I’m so glad you could join us,” Snape stated, his hawk eyes watching Harry’s every move as he stepped through the doors. Harry blushed a little, still slightly uncomfortable when anyone called him by his title.
Draco snapped awake, his ears filled with the sounds of screams and sobbing. He also could feel something struggling beside him. Sitting up quickly he looked around for the source of it, ready to defend himself till he realized the source of it all and relaxed slightly. Potter was struggling against his blankets, screaming bloody murder and apparently still asleep.
Kristian broke him out of his thoughts as she came bursting in with a load of clothes in her hands. “Try these on!” she hooted with a big grin on her face.
“Well at first I was going to do it by hand when I remembered a bit of wandless magic Hermione taught me for stitching. I don’t remember the incantation or anything but when I thought about it hard enough it started working,” he proudly explained.
Harry was stunned. He didn’t get a chance to say anything else because Remus called for them up at the front and Bill turned to go ahead. Harry stood there for a moment, staring at the ground.
Bill chuckled and patted Harry on the back before steering him into the middle of the room. “Before we get started explained everything to Lord Potter, we should make sure he is actually an animagus,” Charlie stated as he sat in a chair, watching Harry. Bill scowled at him.
“Hey Harry,” came a soft voice. Two people plopped down on the other side of the table as Harry lifted his head. He smiled at both, his ears springing forward as he recognized Luna and Neville.
Harry glared at him, unwilling to back down but Sirius stormed out of the hallway. “What is all this racket out here?! Knock it off,” he glared between them for a moment, “Besides you two need to go get some sleep. We are leaving early for Hogwarts. The Head Mistress wants all students with creature inheritances there three days before everyone else,” Sirius grumbled. Both Draco and Harry glared at each other before leaving and grumbling about how annoying interruptions were.
LeFay stood there, glancing down at the dragon that now looked up at him in almost a concerned fashion. Harry lifted one of his paws and set it down gently on Draco’s snout, causing both of them to shiver. Closing his eyes again he dug deeper into the threads, leaning more on the one between him and Draco. He let his magic rest on it again, stroking it with his own magic, trying to think about what Hisashi had said. Sighing, he looked down the thread, deciding to follow it this time. It didn’t take remarkably long for Harry to find, what he guessed anyways, was Draco’s core. He smiled as the warm magic washed over him in waves, but he wasn’t sure if he’d really found what Hisashi wanted him to look for. Gently he placed his hand on the cord again, only this time he could feel it humm under his hand. He was surprised, and pressed further down the cord till he felt the connection point between Draco and himself.
The wizard, Douglas had been thrown out of his family for practicing dark arts not to long ago, and he had quickly earned LeFay's trust. Enough to put him along side LeFay's generals at least.
Slowly Draco stood, placing the letter to Hogwarts in his pocket. “Why are you telling me?” he asked.
“Thanks for having some faith in me,” he said while he hugged Draco before letting go and heading out the door to his last class of the day.
"I am NOT a pet," Skoll snapped, slapping the back of his brother's head, "Excuse my brother, he has no manners."
Just for the sake of argument; the Hebridean Black is roughly the same size as Saphire from the Eragon book series, and about 30ft in length based of potter universe wiki entries. So maybe a bit bigger but for scaling imagination wise! Does it really matter? XD
“All the things you said. I won’t deny it, your right. But what does that make you? So desperate that you went to the very man who ruined Harry’s chance at a normal life just because you couldn’t be patient enough to let him heal from a previous relationship. Who here really is the selfish one?” Draco mutterned, kicking a small amount of dirt towards Cadmael. He looked over to LeFay, who averted his eyes, his hands clenched in Cadmael’s fur.
Draco wakes up, still bound in his animagus body, yet, he doesn't remember how he got the wounds covering his body. Nor does he remember why he is so panicked when Harry is no where in sight.
It was another twenty-five minutes before they were finished, and Harry was standing at the counter, paying for his order. With his glamours in place and his tails hidden away he felt ready for anything.
LeFay pulled the arrowhead charm out from under his shirt, rubbing his thumb over it, "I can't put into words how I feel about you Draco. It's too complicated. Between lingering memories of the Harry you knew, and the personality that is really me now? There is always conflicted thoughts."
Harry snorted, “In your dreams maybe. I just need some rest. Between you and him, you’ve both sapped up most of my magic.”
“Well, Bill, you should go talk to Padma. Since you’re a werewolf she might feel more comfortable around another creature. Charlie, you and Snape should get some potions together. The dragon’s last sighting was heading towards the Dark Forest. From the student’s description, it could be injured or partly stunned, so be careful. Any beast, when injured, are more likely to lash out. If it is a juvenile it probably won’t be able to produce a flame yet, so at least you won’t have to worry about it,” Minerva stated as she got up from the bed. “One of you tell Harry’s parents they can come in.”
Years later, Cadmael lay in what seemed like a hotel, letter in his hands as he wanted for his ‘savoir’ to meet him. While he’d been communicating with the man via letter ever since he’d been reunited with the man, this would be the first time meeting him in person since he was little. The reunion went well, they chatted, laughed even. Then, he was asked to do something odd for the man. It would seem there was a new threat in the world, and Albus wanted him to look into it. What else could he do but agree, after all, the older man had done so much for him in his youth.
“I’m sure he had a reason.” Sirius assured before clearing his throat. He turned and left the room, leaving stunned silence. Remus followed closely behind and left Harry alone in the kitchen.
Harry smiled at the couple and then looked over at Draco, only to find that he wasn’t there. He couldn’t have gone off on his own already! Even after what McGonagall just said?! He looked around the Great Hall only to find Draco sitting with Theodore Nott at the other side of the room.
“So you finally made your move on my mate to-be did you? It really pissed me off when I heard you’d shown up, right when everything had possibly started coming back together with me and LeFay and you had to ruin it,” Cadmael spat out between fangs.
Thinking about it now, it still amused Potter. The culprit now however was the letter that lay by Harry on the bed. Draco continued to pace as Harry picked up the letter and read it over again. It was a threat, simply put.
Lefay crossed his arms on the balcony’s stone wall, “Because of that mad man he left Lady Magic unbalanced," he explained, "Magic is falling apart at the seams, and there is little more I can do about it, " he sighed as his gaze passed over the group below and landed on Draco, "It was going okay while I was working the underworld but there is a new power threatening to uproot all of our work.”
Draco could understand that. He just wished Harry hadn’t used Voldemort as an example. “Well, your behavior is pretty ill mannered…,” Draco mumbled under his breath, thinking Harry wouldn’t hear it. However, he did, and Draco ended up with a face full of peanut butter and honey.
Draco didn’t seem to care. He watched LeFay sit still for a long moment, and Draco guessed he was having a conversation with his 'other half'.
Harry just stood there, his eyes looking out onto the courtyard. His face was stone, but his head and hear ached. He'd known Draco was there but he'd said it anyways. This was good, Draco could move on...
“Lord Potter, if you would,” Minerva asked politely, smiling at Harry as she got up from her seat. Harry nodded, glancing around the room a bit before he started. To his surprise both Remus and Sirius where sitting in chairs behind Charlie. He bowed his head towards them for a moment before closing his eyes.
"Let me know when you want to go again," LeFay joked, a smirk on his face. Draco blushed and then returned the smirk as he rolled, pinning LeFay under him.
The words LeFay had spoken still hung in the air between them, and Draco's thoughts lingered on them while observing Harry.
Harry swallowed and then sat up as well, looking at the others still sleeping in the morning rays. “Didn’t what?” he asked as he stared at Draco. Draco growled again. “The collar?" Harry asked innocently, "Both Charlie and Snape said it would help with the curses and spells you where under. Perhaps even on your memory at the time. It seems like it worked on both,” he explained. Draco glanced over at the sleeping form of his godfather.
Draco dropped his hand from it and laughed crudely, “I guess so.” He didn’t look up at LeFay as he continued, “I always felt your magic from it," his body trembled, "And since it never came off, I knew you were still alive. That there was hope.”
Next was the Gryffindor and Slytherin rings which seemed a lot picker. They took around a minute to settle on their individual fingers, the gold and silver bands glittering side by side. The emerald and ruby in both seemed to be trying to outdo the other which caused Harry to smile. He could almost see the personalities of the first people to wear the two rings. Last was the LeFay ring which he slipped onto the same finger as his Slytherin ring. At first Harry wasn’t sure it would resize to his finger. Both Remus and Harry frowned as the wait lengthened. Sirius even walked back into the room moments later, adding his own anxious stare to the mix. Harry felt the ring testing his magic as well as the other rings. He smiled as, after five minutes, it finally settled and started morphed on his finger. It blended itself with the Slytherin ring, mixing the silver metal with a soft blue hue and creating a design that had everyone in awe. When it was finished taking form a blue-grey fox with emerald eyes sat on his finger, and in the coils of its nine tails was a white diamond that seemed to be blazing with an inner fire. When the magic from all the rings settled, Harry felt a shiver down his spine and what felt like a weight lifting off his chest. His face tickled and he reached up to touch it, surprised when he felt smooth skin.
"Yea, Neville told us that much before we got up here," Ron huffed, his eyes narrowing in on the creature as it passed by his bed and moved onto the next.
“He called himself LeFay before he vanished,” Draco said quietly. “He wouldn’t even respond to his name when I tried-,” Draco stopped to take another shaky breath.
Harry nodded vigorously when Ammit spoke about Kelpies. Oh yes, he had heard quite a lot about them.
“I can’t believe this!” Harry shouted angrily into the emptiness of his room. He had planned out this year so perfectly, and now all of this!
Tom cleared his throat as he sat, his arms resting on the sides of the chair. "Let's start with where I came from. Dumbledore found me at the orphanage, yes?" Severus nodded. "I didn't know any of my family, I was only hell bent on making sure no one ended up in the position I found myself in as a child. However, what I didn't know was that I had family. Not until I took an inheritance test under the advisement of the goblins. They assured me there had to be something connecting me to the magical world or I wouldn't have any abilities. They told me of a past where muggles and wizards lived peacefully together once, and bred together on various occasions till the idea of purebloods came to our world. Every muggle born can be traced back to a line, Severus. Each and everyone of them. The power just hibernates till it finds the best match. Salazar knew this, but he also knew that muggles feared us and our powers for good reason. It wasn't because he didn't see muggle borns as equal, he couldn't keep watching them die."
Draco stood on the balcony over looking the training yard. Those below where in the middle of a break, passing out water and food; it astounded him just how well they all worked together. The mix of creatures and wizards below him made his head spin. Those that he'd been taught were dark seemed to be the most common sight but what surprised him most was just how many wizards and witches were helping.
Harry felt really sick now and wrapped his arms around his stomach. Snape glared holes into Bill’s head. “What? It’s the truth. I don’t know why you two are so upset about it, I mean look at you two. You guys honestly couldn’t have scored anything better. Especially with the workmanship in that collar!” Bill continued. Charlie hit him over the head and berated him on his manners. Harry closed his eyes, breathing deep and slow as he felt his magic teetering on the edge of blowing.
“I’m here for my parents’ will reading. James and Lily Potter, as well as an inheritance test,” Harry told the goblin. The goblin was quiet for a moment as he shuffled through various papers and folder.
Harry slammed the table with his fist, splintering wood. "I asked if it would save him?!" he snapped.
“Sirius!” he snapped, croaking and coughing, hurriedly grabbing a napkin to wipe his face and the spray from the table.
“Shibee has nothing to do with bed Mister Malfoy. Hogwarts chose your room for Headmistress,” the house elf stated, cringing slightly.
Draco turned back to the door, his eyes lingering on the room for the moment. He'd just reached for the door handle when it turned and opened, an irritated LeFay standing behind it.
"Draco no! The phoenix tears could only close the wounds so much when in contact with Nagini's poison, you'll tear them open!' Severus panted as he got to his feet and ran after Draco.
"It's too late to be thinking about that now," he muttered as he bit into a sweet roll. OInce it was done it was done. Even with a time turner you could only do so much.
Once Potter was done showering the two headed down to the common room while everyone was still sleeping. Draco doubted the lazy Gryffindors would get up an earlier than they had to, and especially take advantage of not needing to wake up at all on the weekends. Surprisingly enough when they got down to the Gryffindor common room, there was actually a few people up as early as them. Not so surprisingly one of those people was Hermione Granger. Draco eyed her warily through beady predatory eyes, he had not forgotten what she had done the previous night when she'd taken Potter's book. Currently however she was talking to Ginny Weasly.
“What are you looking for?” Herm asked, Luna nodded and stepped over to the desk. Neville shrugged as Harry starred at Theo’s back.
Harry nodded at the empty air where his godfather had been and cast a few quick glamours. One on his face to shift his features a bit, and another on his legs to change the color of his fur and make it a bit coarser. Concentrating hard he was able to dissolve his tails before stepping into the floo. Hopefully his concentration would last long enough for their shopping trip. “Diagon Alley!” he said determinedly.
Had planned to write more for this chapter, but I wanted to give it to you guys faster so here it is!
“Thank you so much for everything Kristian,” he said and bowed his head. It was Kristian’s turn to blush and she waved her hand in front of her face.
LeFay nodded, "Yes, it does confuse some of the residence, but they get use to it. In time I'm sure you will too."
Hermione turned brighter and thumped him over the head, causing him to smile as he rubbed the new sore spot. Luna smiled and Neville looked rather intrigued.
Harry asked, starting to get a bit excited from what he was hearing. This stuff was pretty interesting. Unknown to him, something deep inside was starting to stir and was also listening to Ammit speak as well.
"What is so wrong about that! You can not deny we have a connection, or this," he gestured angrily at the collar, "This would not have stayed on. You said so yourself that a part of Harry was probably what kept this magic alive! You're magic hasn't changed, its stronger now but it is the same, you can not deny it!" Draco roared at him. He was sick of beating around the bush, if anything Lefay seemed more oblivious than Potter was.
"It's hard to keep myself focused on work when you are around. That is why I didn't want you here. Even after putting the distance between us... I didn't want you to get hurt Draco, especially after what happened? I wasn't confident I wouldn't hurt you while piecing myself together." LeFay watched, hesitant about Draco's response.
Draco squirmed a bit in his seat, he felt antsy for some reason. Maybe it was just being stuck here?
“It was what we had to do,” Narcissa said, looking exhausted as she sipped at her drink. “Thank you for the tea Remus.” He nodded and then glanced over at Draco who was petting his large owl, looking very disinterested in starting a conversation. Narcissa frowned at her son, she truly felt horribly about moving her son from their home and seeing him like this made her heart bleed. “Draco,” she murmured. Draco turned his attention from his bird.
"Potter, do you know the implications-." He was cut off by the fiery and determination in Harry's eyes.
"It's alright. We understand," Severus said as he finished shaking hands with the last healer. He dropped the last few chocolate frogs and flowers onto the table beside Harry's bed, a delicate smile forming on his face. "You're just like Lily. Always had an eye for those damn frogs," he chuckled softly as he shook his head. "You better be thankful when you wake up," he said as he turned to look over the boys sleeping face. He reached up a hand to brush some of the hair out of Harrison's face. The glamours Harry had been using had finally worn off and you could see the full extent of his scar now. Severus had been adding a cream to it so it was only a thin line starting from his bolt scar all the way down to his lips but at least it wasn't red and angry looking anymore. The rest of the scaring across the child's body, along with his false eye, would have to wait.
Draco’s wings immediately curled around him as Cadmael fired off the first spell, it slammed against his scales and Draco could feel a sudden stinging pain and warmth, but it seemed his scales were able to reflect most of the curse. Gritting his teeth Draco opened his wings wide, lifting off the ground and creating space between him and Cadmael as the beastman rushed at him. Firing back his own spell he could see it catch Cadmael in the chest and there was a sudden arcing spark that flew from him. After it cleared Draco groaned as he saw the slight glittery sheen to the beast man’s fur. It was just like his scales, there was damage but it seemed spells were only going to do so much before being deflected.
Charlie seemed to see the expression and chuckled. “You where naked so Bill gave you some of his extra clothes,” Charlie explained. Draco tried to smile at Bill and thanked him. The group started getting ready to leave, packing up their things and loading them onto their persons. Bill was in the middle of pointing out the way back to Charlie when there was a loud explosion that came from the direction of Hogwarts. Sharing a startled glance in between them, both yelled out for the other to turn into their animagus forms. If the explosion did come from Hogwarts they needed to hurry. Bill took lead as he leaped forward, landing gracefully as a ginger wolf with a brown bear loping at his heals. Snape gave out a long groan before chasing after them.
"You really made a mess of things by coming here. It took a lot for him to start looking at everyone with an equal eye after you left him."
Tatsuya's silhouette took on it's smokey form in front of LeFay. LeFay stopped mid shuffle of papers, his eyes straying to the arrowhead pendant necklace on his desk. Tatsuya caught the slight movement in his eyes and chuckled.
August clearing his through, "I suggest continuing conversations like these while not in the presence of our host."
Eureka moment! So the story isn't going to go exactly how I was planning it out, I had a really good idea so I'm going with it. Hope you guys like it! SO Hold on for the ride guys!
Draco was at a loss of words as he stared at the, mostly, nude Potter in front of him. He had a point about the scars but they were sharing a bed! “I’m guessing that means you’re wearing that horrific thing to bed,” Harry stated and gestured at Draco’s pj set. Draco glared at him, tempted to throw the baggy at him.
Harry's hair cradled his face as it floated around him, suspended in the dark waters around him. Draco could see him, and he moved closer slowly, tears starting to fall down his face but he didn't know why.
Breakfast seemed to drag on for the five of them, especially for Harry. Though he had to admit, his mind was other places. Would he really be able to face a dragon? Voldemort had at least been…Human-ish.
All Severus could get from Draco's mind where a chaos of images covered in blood, and a mass of arms, something screaming. It was Draco screaming Harry's name over and again. Draco had to find Harry. He didn't know why, he just knew he had to find Harry.
For parseltongue dialogue I have changed it to where its just '***' and italics rather than stretching out the s's as well. Since there is going to be a lot more of it, it's easier on my fingers. Don't judge =(^ . ^)=
“I suppose that means we will be running into some other type of creatures as well. Splendid,” Severus mumbled before he lifted the side of his coat to pull out a short vile. He uncorked it and drank it before putting it back into his coat.

Draco stood at the attic door, wondering why Harry had ever chosen to live up here. The boy-who-lived was definitely insane. He knocked and waited for a response, only to get a muffled few words. He heard Harry shuffling over to the door and crossed his arms over his chest as he waited. He froze when the door opened, completely stunned. He couldn’t help but stare, his eyes wandering from Harry’s face to his bare chest and the scars that lingered there. Draco’s mind instantly wanted to fill in the blanks. What or who had made them?
“Remus and Sirius want you down stairs in twenty minutes, I thought we could go over our schedules and decide on which classes to take while waiting,” Draco tried to keep his eyes on Harry’s face and not on his chest. He heard a scoffing sound come from Harry and then watched the raven-head turn and head farther into the attic.
He could have sworn they were on when he'd headed down stairs, everything even seemed to be in perfect definition. Finding his glasses, Harry pulled them on only to have everything he looked at become ridiculously fuzzy. He stared at them for a moment as he pulled them off his face, even cleaning them before trying it again. When he got the same result, he put them down and sighed. “Stran-nge,” he drawled out before looking at himself in the mirror. He stood up and stepped in front of it, catching himself in the full-length mirror. Along with his eyes seeming to be fixed themselves they seemed to be bit brighter. Harry noticed a few other changes as well. He'd gotten a bit taller, and filled in. He touched his cheeks and felt his cheek bones. He didn't remember them being so prominent before either.  Even his eyebrows had changed. They seemed thinner, more delicate, and his hair! When Harry noticed it, his eyes whipped to the reflection of his hair. The strands were so silky now! He was suddenly very caught off guard but then Remus and Sirius hadn't noticed. Maybe it was best he didn't ask. They had been pretty preoccupied with each other lately, and the sudden changes to his appearance weren’t all that extreme. Possibly, he thought, if they were staring at him long enough they might notice something was off, but that was about it.
Sirius stepped in and motioned the other two towards the floo. “Well come on then, let’s get moving.”
Harry looked between Severus and Draco, utterly confused. His magical core was connected to Draco’s now? “Wait a second, what’s happening now? I mean I didn’t sign up to share a core with someone,” Harry stuttered out. Charlie and Bill looked guilty at each other but remained quiet.
Remus watched from the side lines along with Narcissa and the two shared a knowing look for a moment. “How about we postpone the lessons and meetings for today. I think it would be a nice day to go out. We need a few new ingredients for your extra potions lessons with Snape and also set up a few things at Hogwarts,” Remus stated.
There was a moment of silence while Hermione shrunk and her clothes fell around her. After a minute all that remained was a pile of clothes where Hermione once stood.
Harry sat next to the still unconscious Draco. His eyes never leaving him for more than a second while Charlie took notes in his booklet furiously. Harry thought that he might be writing about dragon inheritances, and habits of those with them. Sighing he looked back at Draco, brushing the pale locks away from his sleeping face.
LeFay rounded the corner and started; left, right, left, right, right, straight, left, right, left…It took a full twenty minutes before he stopped in the middle of the maze. A small meadow of clover and lavender surrounded him and in the middle sat an ordinary looking white fox. It blinked at them as LeFay stepped forward to kneel at the bottom of the hill; which the fox sat on. The air became heavy with magic for a moment as a breeze surrounded them, the white fox shedding its disguise. Standing before them now another Kitsune. This one, having achieved its ninth tail, was a sparkling silvery-white with golden eyes.
"Of course," he turned to leave and paused, "Tom may come in later. He is Harrison's great uncle after all."
“Hey! Hey! Over here!” Harry yelled at it. The Nagas turned with an aggravated hiss before dropping back down onto its belly and making its way towards him. “Yea that’s it,” he mumbled.
Harry took the collar back and jogged over to Charlie. “Can this help? I know it has protection charms and loads of other ones on it,” Harry asked. Charlie’s mouth tilted as he lifted the collar from Harry’s hands. He placed the shard of magical glass over one of his eyes to inspect it and slowly a smirk formed on his face.
Harry bit his lip, thinking for a moment. He remembered the angry hissing and guessed that a dragon probably wouldn’t make that noise, so Parvati must be a snake of some sort. Sirius looked over at Harry for a moment before turning his attention back to Minerva. “Do to the fact that you and Remus are comfortable with the Forbidden Forest, you will help Charlie and Bill. Snape will provide any potions that the five of you will need, and accompany you in case you need any others,” Minerva paused to make sure everyone was following along, “I must also inform you all that you may find more than just a dragon out there. There have been reports as close as Hogsmead of former Death Eaters attacking people, and with the influx of creature inheritances there are also a number of bounty hunters that aren’t against killing to get there pay.”
Tatsuya said quietly as he stretched in Harry’s mind. Harry smirked a little before closing his eyes, letting the feeling of Tatsuya wash over him. He could feel the muscles bunching and stretching. The way his ears and tails moved. The way his head felt with the heavy set of antlers. Harry opened his eyes slowly, finding his point of view shifted. He tried to take a step, only to fall forward with the unexpected weight on his head. Shaking his head, he blinked, only to find that his friends where staring at him. Looking down he looked at his paws, which sported black fur and devilishly long claws that where tinted green. He turned to face his mirror and tilted his head.
"You better not get me into any trouble you here? I have enough on my plate, and no destroying anything in the dorms," he grumbled as he walked side by side with the albino animal.
"Torturing him?" Harry sat completely up then, getting to his feet shakily as he spun around. "HELLO?" he yelled into the darkness around him. For some reason his heart was pounding in his chest.
Hermione smiled and nodded. "Glad to help. I think we'll need to find something written about Hyena's though. I still find it odd that they chose this creature rather than something else," she stated. Ron groaned.
LeFay sat down on this thrown, nails clicking against the arm rest in irritation. Ammit should have been here by now.
“Now Harry, those are all good suggestions, but what do you want it to look like?” Regulus asked, “Did you have anything in mind?”
His smoky silhouette surprised Ammit, causing him to hiss and grumble before laying his head back down on LeFay's shoulders.
The Eagle Owl flew to his master’s arm and settled there for a moment as Draco stroked in between the large creature’s ear tufts. As Draco turned to leave his room the owl moved to his shoulder. He headed down stairs where his mom was waiting impatiently. Seeing the look on her son’s face made her soften. “It will be alright. After this all passes we’ll come back. I promise,” she tried to say comfortingly. Grabbing hold of his hand they apparated.
LeFay could feel the wind tugging at his fur as they slowed their pace. Damn it, how far did that git go?
“You do?!” he squeaked. Harry’s tails reappeared as he started to panic a little and lost his concentration. The dresser reached up for his arm when it looked like he might bolt.
“Sirius and Remus really?" he laughed, "If they truly ‘loved’ me, then they would have stepped up to the plate of parenthood far before Albus got his hands on me. Besides they have a legitimate heir now,” LeFay scoffed, “The others never knew the real me. As so I have had no reason to contact any of them.”
Draco woke with a start and quickly vomited over the side of the cot he lay on. Coughing, and sputtering he tried to breath but something squeezed his chest to tightly. He felt his claws slide on the thin fabric as he struggled to get up, panting hard. His head ached and pounded against the back of his eyes. He almost snapped the hand that touched him clean off before he heard Severus' voice.
The group crouched in the bushes ready to move but Snape seemed stuck. His eyes pacing the ex-Death Eaters, and his face paler than normal.
Harry found the clothes he was looking for and smiled, since they didn't have class today he went ahead and pulled the muggle clothes Sirius had gotten. A green and black long-sleeve and grey denim jeans. Ghost inspected the clothes, sniffing them and then pulling back his head sharply. He gave Harry a look that only could be read as 'really?'. Harry shrugged, "What? You're not going to act like a pure-blood and insist I wear robes everywhere I go are you?" Harry asked. Ghost only huffed, turning his head away. He looked a bit like he was pouting.
Harry turned and started walking backwards, watching his friends talking. It made him happy. Though, Theo wasn't really his friend, was he? Harry stumbled and then fell on his butt, drawing the attention of Hermione and Luna.
He must be really out, Harry thought to himself. He stood up and placed his hands on the cool scales to steady himself as he balanced on his toes, trying to look at the dragon’s back. A large spear stood in the air, almost like it had been stabbed down directly into Draco’s back. Harry settled back down onto his heels and glanced around to try and find something to step up on. He settled for using the dragon’s elbow to step up, dragging himself onto the dragon’s back. He was surprised to see that the ridges down the dragon’s back had a bit of hair like material growing at the base of them. Stands of the material spilled down either side of the ridges but the actual growth stopped only a few inches from the ridges before turning into Draco’s scales.
"So, what is this thing doing here? We saw you talking to Snape and Dumbledore at supper but, Dumbledore cast a silencing charm around you guys," Ron asked.
Hermione nodded, "It's not like students to receive a familiar until there last year at Hogwarts, even then some aren't compatible with one. It really rare these days."
Harry was too busy hissing away with Ammit to notice the purple starting to bleed into Draco’s eyes. He took a step towards Harry, eyes narrowing in on him. The way he was leaning on the wall was just soo-.
With no one in sight and no roads nearby Draco let out a defeated sigh. He must have been thinking about the forest too much. He growned and started to prep himself to try again when something caught his attention in the trees.
“You heard her, it’s not her fault," Harry butted in, "It’s just what was available, I don’t mind sharing." He chuckled, “As long as you’re not a bed hog that is.” Harry set his trunk down and tapped it with his wand.
August smiled sickly, his eyes stripping down Draco to his core. "You're mates right?" August asked. Draco nodded slowly, his eyes flashing a deep purple for a moment. "Looks like you'll be fulfilling your duty sooner than you expected."
The silence was deafening for the next ten minutes or so as neither said anything to the other. "Well, this is awkward," Tom grunted.
Draco paled and his smirk faltered. He couldn’t bring himself to look up at LeFay now. This might be the real Harry, but what he just said made Draco’s stomach roll. If that’s what LeFay thought, then hadn’t Draco played a bigger part in the way things ended up?
"Since my recovery I have started to try collecting my soul fragments, however Dumbledore has beaten me to it. Add on top of it that I was still as mad as before, I suppose I was not thinking correctly. When Lucius faked his family death I knew you had something to do with it and sent Nagini to attack you. It would seem Dumbledore had taken that into consideration and attacked me, first destroying all of my horcruxes and then raiding Malfoy manner. By destroying the items that held my soul they should have vaporated, however, they've returned to me through the grace of Lady Magic while I lay dying," he started explaining, "Dumbledore had made a mistake though, he didn't count on Draco saving you from Nagini. Or Potter saving Draco."
Harry stayed frozen to the spot as the dragon slowly stood, a bit wobbly, as a low rumble started in its throat. Almost as slowly as it stood, it dropped its head to Harry’s level. Its mouth and nose inches from Harry’s face.
Draco fidgeted in his seat uncomfortably as he watched Voldemort move closer. His eyes fell to where Tom cradled his arm and then back up to his face. Voldemort was to focused on Harry to notice the gaze. "How is the arm?" Draco asked quietly.
Draco sagged to the ground as the world came loose. Tears spilling down the sides of his face as his hands met the ground. He stayed there: unwilling to move, unwilling to believe any of this was real. He watched as the ground below him was flooded with tears.
Draco sighed as he sat down at his desk, going over the notes he had written. He was trying to get ahead so that during first quarter he could reconnect more with his friends, along with sending letters back and forth with Pansy. Mostly just telling her about how his summer was going and how excited he was for eighth year. That was until he’d come to Black Manor of course. As if on cue, Bubo swooped in through the open window and landed on his desk with a letter. Draco smiled and patted his owl’s head before giving him a small treat. Bubo flew off with it to his perch and began preening himself before falling asleep.
He stopped, shaking his head. No, now wasn’t the time for fantasizing, he needed to talk through everything with LeFay, if he could just get him in between tasks maybe.
,” Harry spoke softly as he stroked along the spine of the snake. The snake lifted its head from Harry’s arm and faced him, flicking it’s tongue out at him.
"You going to eat that then?" Ron asked as he pointed to the jello beside Harry. He shook his head as Ron grabbed the food up greedily, spooning it into his mouth.
Albus looked up from his desk to see Severus stepping through the door, closing it gently behind him. "Good afternoon Severus. I'm glad you could make it," Albus' eyes twinkling as he spoke.
Or has he? Something's going on here and Harry LeFay Potter has a feeling everything with this betrayal may not be what it seems.
"It would seem every time he tried to get help Dumbledore intervened, accused Harry of lying, or memory wiped Harry and those he turned to," Nacrissa added.
Harry laughed, "I don't know, I think it's kinda cute," he said as he looked over his shoulder in the hyena's direction.
Harry finished pulling on his pants and then glanced around for a second, sighing slightly as he looked at the collar and arrowhead. He grabbed both and stuffed them into his pockets before grabbing his coat and headed out the door.
Harry said, still chuckling quietly to himself. Ammit hissed at him, displeased with his master’s antics. ‘
“Who’s this pipsqueak?” the man asked, stroking the short goatee on his chin. The three men shrugged and continued their conversation they'd been having when Draco walked in.
He found himself staring at Potter while he worked, watching the way his tails bounced around as he walked. He really was getting much better at walking around on those spindly legs. “It’s not really about sharing the bed,” he mumbled under his breath. Harry’s ears twitched, catching what he said and causing Harry to face Draco.
“Great.” So, he wasn’t going to be close to his mother. He was used to that, but being on the opposite side of the house did make him feel a little vulnerable.
“Harry?” Bill said softly. The Kitsune’s ears flicked before it shook its head and returning to its normal position, stopping a few feet from them. The glowing they hadn't noticed faded from Harry’s eyes.
Harry stared blankly as they moved forward, and with his next step he tripped and fell. Draco turned, his head cocked to the side as he picked Harry up off the ground.
"Not without you!" Draco snapped, grabbing Harry's shoulder and spinning around him. He leaned in quickly, his lips smashing into Harry's. As Draco pulled away he could see the startled look in Harry's eye, and the tear spilling from the socket his other eye should have been. Suddenly Draco felt a tugging at his gut, and his head snapped to his stomach. He felt like he was being torn through an apparition hole. "Harry!" he yelled.
Finally, Harry headed downstairs. It had only taken him another hour to figure something out but by that time Sirius and Remus where up as well, drinking tea and coffee while reading the Daily Prophet.
"Draco!" Snape yelled, watching Draco back disappear around a corner. There was a loud crack, and Severus could see the massive new for of Draco disappearing into the clouds.
“I take that as a while,” Harry scoffed as he picked up his robe and slipped it on over his body, finding a spot to lay back against the dragon. “I’m not sorry,” Harry started as he pulled his knees to his chest, “What Cadmael said, while rash, was true. It was how I was feeling at the time, but I also knew it was my fault. I believed that I was this monstrous thing, that everything that had happened up to that point was entirely my fault. And then suddenly finding out I was actually this creature, and all the memories that were no longer stolen from me returning, and suddenly the Headmaster being the bad guy in all of it. I was so confused at the time, and even as I aged, this whole creature inheritance that I knew so little about disgusted me. To be a part of something so dark, and having been told all my life by Albus and those he’d used that those dark creatures were inherently evil,” he paused and leaned his head back against Draco’s cool scales, “August changed everything. He was one of the first people I met after leaving Hogwarts. He spotted me in a backwards part of the alleys while I was looking for answers. I’m sure he’d had plans to eat me until he realized what I was. He took me under his wing for a while; introduced me to more of HIS people. The ones I’d always thought were just out to hurt others, or were cursed in some way. Then I realized that they were just as much people as everyone else was, that they deserved a life just like everyone else. That’s when I invited them to the LeFay Manor, and started to really dive into the research. The more I read, the more I heard the angrier I got. I hated myself for letting myself become so swayed by just someone's words and promises rather than actual facts. That I wasn’t strong enough to break Albus’ spells and plots. There would have been so many people I could have saved,” he stopped and laid a hand on Draco’s large scaly arm, scratching the scales gently and pulling a few bits of old scales and skin off. “In the end, I recognized that what I’d been told and raised with was all wrong, but that didn’t stop me from shoving everything about my true self to the side. That I was still a monster, and all these instincts I had were still wrong,” he started to laugh softly. “Cadmael tried so hard, then Albus had to go and ruin it,” Harry growled, his hand digging into the scales. Draco didn’t mind at the moment, he was finally breaking down walls Harry LeFay had been holding up for so long.
Harry stopped reading and looked over at Remus, confused. “Weren’t the wills supposed to be read a month after my parents’ death?” he asked. Remus returned the confused look and nodded.
Ghost laid at Harry's feet with his head on his paws, seemingly very relaxed and unbothered by the magic. He only lifted his head when Harry's shoe touched him. Harry motioned for the hyena to come up next to him on the sofa, only to have the hyena huff and put his head down. It only had been a day but still, Harry was a bit confused at the rejection. If only he could communicate with Ghost the way he'd read in books about familiars. Thinking about that made him lift his eyes to meet Severus' intrigued one.
"No. I knew the risks of this happening. We all knew," Draco said sadly. He sniffed deeply, standing and shaking himself as he smacked his lips. Trying to re-wet his very dry mouth. "What are we going to tell the others? How are we going to explain everything?" Draco asked.
Draco is forced by his mother to accept the truth. They will have to move into the Black Manor to make ends meet. At least until everything blows over. Draco's plans are to stay in his room till school starts, but we all know how plans like to fall apart.
Ghost didn't respond with a noise this time; only walking beside Harry as the two started up the steps to Gryffindor Tower.
LeFay grinned as he stood and heading over to the shelf to pull the book down. He looked over it and showed it to Tatsuya who nodded.
"Did you know?" August snapped, his eyes floating between Draco's. "Did you give them any information on our plans?"
Harry hadn’t ever really told anyone but he loved the forest, almost as much as he did flying. Of course, he did feel a bit tied down by the fact he couldn’t see the sky, but the sun spots through the trees' leaves were gorgeous; absolutely stunning.
Harry sighed as he moved his bag to his shoulder and twisted around on a single paw. “I’m used to it that’s why. I’m used to being targeted in school and outside of school. I thought it might change with Voldemort gone but it hasn’t,” he answered, staring defiantly at Draco now.
Severus leaned back and sighed as he sat down on the floor, his eyes floating over to look at the bed Harry laid on. Or at least what was left of him at this point.
“Severus went over some of it, but basically he pointed out the fact I haven’t actually embraced being what I am, what we are,” Harry stated, looking up at Hisashi.
They finished the transaction and Kristian gave him the estimated time for their completion before disappearing into the back room with another client. Harry made his way back out, only to run into Sirius.
“No,” Hermione said quietly. Seeing the hollow look on Harry’s face she reached over and squeezed his shoulder. “They could have gotten out of the way and just haven’t been found yet. The castle is enormous, they could have gotten lost if they fell down into a catacomb,” she suggested, trying to make him feel better.
Draco winced before taking a deep breath, staring at Harry. How could he convince him that this was different? He probably couldn’t, definitely not with how Harry was now. Harry continued to stare him down too, one hand moved to his hip with his kilt stuck to the one side he had most of his weight on. His student robes actually fit him nicely so they weren’t baggy like they had been the first-year Draco met him. Perhaps, with the fact he looked more mature, he would act a bit more mature about the danger he was in.
The last person to come in knelt below LeFay; signalling everyone to stand again and take their seats.
Harry nodded his head, swallowing loudly once Snape had stepped away. He glanced at Ghost, only to see that the hyena had a smug look on his face. Harry scowled and grit his teeth before walking past him, making sure to run his leg into the animal's shoulder. Ghost huffed, his eyes following Harry before he started after them.
“What is it then? if isn’t really about sharing the bed, then what's bothering you?” Harry’s eyes flared. Draco swallowed a nervous laugh before crossing his arms over his chest.
Harry wasn’t listening as the conversation continued. He stared at the dark shape of purple and black in the darkness. Getting up slowly he crept away from the group and towards the dark shape. Keeping the blanket wrapped close around his shoulders he shuffled over to the side of the giant. Staring into the water he bit his lip and then dropped the blanket onto the grass before wading into the water slowly.
“I can’t believe we are doing this,” Draco growled out as he stood there watching Bubo shake out his feathers. His mother flicked him in the head before she turned back to the door and knocked, smiling when it opened. Kreacher looked up at them with narrowed eyes from the doorway before stepping aside.
Harry moved down the steps from his throne rapidly, followed closely by Draco as they moved to look over Cadmael. Cadmael coughed and Severus was busy feeding him another calming draught.
Draco wrapped his arms around LeFay's neck, kissing it gently as he felt Harry lift him off his feet.
“That could kill him depending on how Draco reacted! He isn’t himself remember!” Bill snapped, uneasy when he thought about either Harry or Draco getting hurt.
LeFay looked to the north, trying to keep his antlers out of the branches above. Even with magic surrounding them to make a path, the snow still held them back. Bowing their head they pushed forward, all the while LeFay was hating himself.
"Draco, that's not you talking and you know it. Get a hold of yourself and think logically," Severus knelt not to far from Draco now, pleading for his godson to look at him. He need to make sure Draco's mind was still in contact. The powers they where playing with right now where older. Much older than even the first recorded magical history. This was as old as the universe itself, not something to take lightly.
"I couldn't keep my mind off you, LeFay. Even when I started working for Sev," Draco paused, looking down into his cup, "I couldn't stop thinking about you. Being able to feel you through the collar, that was what kept me going. I know you deny it, but I know deep inside. We are meant to be together; I know we are mates."
Ghost, or rather Draco, couldn’t help but grin a little at hearing that. This way he wouldn’t have to worry about transforming with the collar on!
“That there is a hybrid between your average Water Python, and a more mythical snake species called a Metal-Mane. Though they are known to be quite aggressive, this one is a big sweet heart, unless you’re like the last few people that bought it,” the man huffed. Harry turned his head to look at him, confused. “Well, you aren’t exactly just a wizard though huh,” he added as he eyed Harry’s legs.
LeFay felt the stir of sorrow, the pang of a broken heart, as the arrow head charm he wore around his neck came to life. He’d only worn it to remember but…
Draco gasped, both arms wrapping around himself as he clutched his sides, “I said you’re right. I didn’t do anything for him, but I want to change that. You’re right, I’m not worth it. He deserves so much more, and I should have been stronger for him,” he managed to get out between ragged breaths.
“Cadmael Greyback, what is your relationship to Albus Dumbledore,” Harry asked, his eyes never leaving the form of the shaky, sweaty man in front of him. He had to do it, not matter how much it pained him too.
“It’s a collar that appeared yesterday before I went to see McGonagall. There was a note in the box it came in that simply said ‘take care of him’,” Harry explained. He handed the collar to Severus. “It has a shrinking charm on it, along with a few other charms and a portkey, I have the other half of the portkey as well, but I can’t help but think it was meant for Draco,” he added.
"It wasn't until the prophecy that I had started to understand what was happening, I tried Severus. I tried to turn back what I did....Lily," he stopped, a look of deep regret as he looked over at Severus.
That was crazy to think about; someone being able to see his memories. After he finished getting ready Shibee popped into the room with a plate of food for Harry.
“I will have nothing to do with anyone that insults and belittles others. Especially when they don’t even give a chance to know the people they loath so much!” Harry yelled back over his shoulder and slammed the doors behind him. Draco lifted a brow as he watched the angry Kitsune kick the door before turning and heading in the same direction Draco was headed.
Harry wiped the blood off his hands with a rag graciously given to him by one of the med witches. “No August, he’s just been used like the rest of us. You’ll understand when you talk to him next,” Harry said, “Right now I need to talk to Lord Malfoy, do you know where Snape took him to treat him?”
he asked his snake. Ammit shook his head, telling Harry that he was exhausted from watching over him for so long. Harry understood and lifted Ammit from his bed and into his glass tank.
"Harry, you know you should be focusing on what we are doing right now in class, these books aren't going to help you," she stated. Ghost stopped his sniffing around the room, his head tilted to the side. His eyes where trained on the book Hermione was currently putting in her bag. Draco though that Hermione would have been pushing Harry to read books like that. He couldn't believe what he just heard her say even. He stayed frozen for a long time, eyeing Hermione suspiciously.
Ammit explained and started to move off him so he could stand. Harry stretched, yawning loudly before turning and looking into the full-length mirror near the bathroom door. He stopped to stare at himself, smiling slightly. His ears, and legs had returned to normal; his tails gone. He would probably miss them but he was glad to be normal again.
Draco narrowed his eyes, "That isn't what I meant, and you know it." Was this man ever going to give him a straight answer?
Draco didn't look at Severus but he did nod as his hand reached for the elegant collar around his neck.
Cadmael grinned, reaching down and grabbing Draco by his shirt collar and lifting him up off the ground. He sneered in Draco’s face before looking up at LeFay. “You hear that, he admitted all of it. And you’d still choose him over me?! This waste of space that is a smear on the magical creature community that did so much to bring you and our community into the fucking dirt!” Cadmael said hotly as his eyes met LeFay’s.
The goblin didn’t look too pleased that Albus was present either as he spoke, “Albus was the one that had the will closed, by default he has to be at the proceedings as the will holder.”
“You were right, his psyche is tearing itself apart, there’s only so much I can do and his magic is still recovering,” Severus stated as he tried to stabilize Cadmael. He’d been doing so well, and now this. He wished Harry hadn’t taken it this far but he understood why. Cadmael needed to know, and the others needed to see that he hadn’t betrayed them willingly, that he’d fought Albus every step of the way.
“No. Father said that it wouldn’t be safe, even with Neville there. The left-over Death Eaters have been more active recently from what I've heard. He doesn’t want to take that chance that I’ll get hurt,” Luna sighed. Neville nodded and then put an arm around Luna and pulled her close.
Draco had ceased calling him Harry after a long rant from Severus about proper etiquette. Pointing out that Harry might as well have been dead as well since One Harry Potter never truly existed. At least that’s what Severus kept repeating.
Draco nodded, understanding. 'He wanted me to know that there is more to him than just what people want him to be, or what everyone says he is.'
Six years after Harry's disappearance, Draco, Sirius, and Remus still search non stop for him. After breaking into hive of vampires deep in the Forest of Rothiemurchus he finds himself running for his life, only to stumble into wards that feel familiar to him.
If it wasn’t from fighting Voldemort, then who? As if knowing Draco would ask for more Harry stood and pulled off his shirt before turning around. Draco inhaled sharply, choking on air when he saw Harry’s back. His back was completely covered in horrible wounds, many more than those on his front. The raised, burnt, scarred flesh made it almost impossible to imagine how the skin must have looked before.
“People may feel better with you-know-who gone but everything hasn’t quite settled yet, and with some of those death eaters still roaming around free,” she shook her head and looked up at his face, “Honestly a group like that was bad enough with him leading them, but now they are either pushing their own agendas or attacking at random just for fun.” Harry frowned. It seemed like everything almost got worse.
The man working the desk hummed and looked over the desk at the albino striped hyena, he pulled a bit of a face but then shrugged. “Well, a familiar? That's impressive young man, not many people have a full familiar at your age. What were you thinking?” he asked.
Draco walked ahead of Harry as they stepped into the drawing room, his eyes falling onto the alter in the middle of the room. He glanced at his mother who smiled at him but remained standing off to the side with Remus.
Had it been just a wizard duel anything close to deadly would be illegal but since they were both magical creatures the laws didn’t apply. He felt a deep understanding for the godfather, he could only imagine that his fear mirrored LeFay’s own. That Cadmael would win and take the chance to eliminate Draco for good. He didn’t look all that strong, but there was a reason beastmen like Cadmael were seen as great warriors. They had the advantage of being both man and beast at the same time, those like Harry and Draco didn’t. It was either one or the other, there was no inbetween. Even those that were closely linked to beastmen like werewolves lost their human logic to a point during their shift. Beastmen didn’t.
Draco sprinted towards it his heart racing again. He started recognizing the song, it was the that poem for his book.
If you'd like to see an image of the rune, you can find it on my Deviantart page. The link for it is on my profile.
“That’s not Harry!” she yelled at Sirius as her voice cracked. Theo pulled her into a tight hug, trying to calm her as she started to sob.
Once they got to Severus' quarters he motioned for Harry to take a seat. Tea already sat ready for them as they made themselves comfortable. Severus flicked his wand, causing Harry to shiver as he felt wards fall into place. Something felt off as he noticed one of the charms falling around the room was a silencing charm.
"You know, it's really weird seeing you without the ears and all harry legs. Yet, it seems like you're even more clumsy now," Theo stated as he put his arm around Hermione.
“It is theorized by the council that both the death of his wife, and what he believed to be two of his sons drove him to insanity,” August stated, answering Skoll's question before he could form the words to ask. He watched his werewolf friend wilt, and a pain of sadness and grief for the man formed in August’s chest.
“Draco, we have to do this,” his mother said tiredly as she dropped her hand. Draco looked wide-eyed at her and paled for a moment before his face turned hard and he spun around to leave.
"It's just Snape," Harry muttered before sitting up and turning his body. He froze in his seat after spotting what accompanied their potions master down the isle.
"Well," Tom started as he moved to a more comfortable chair by the fire, "You already know about the horcruxes. How I split my soul into six pieces, technically seven."
"My'Lord, you need to get that looked at, Severus," came Narcissa's voice. Voldemort shook his head as Narcissa went to drag Severus to his feet.
Draco snorted. "You aren't getting jealous are you? I know you and my mother are together now, but you do know that those two only married out of duty right?" he asked as he pulled some white grape juice out and set it on the counter. Tom scowled.
Harry was startled by the doors opening and seeing McGonagall and Professor Snape walking over to his bed, he was surprised to say the least. There were footsteps behind them as well, and Harry had to peak around them to spot I very out of breath Charlie and Bill behind them. Lifting his brows as they formed a circle around his bed, he was starting to feel like he was about to be interrogated.
“Tatsuya, what’s happening? How can I see you?” Harry asked as he looked in the mirror, turning his head and body. The slightly transparent Kitsune shifted beside him and chuckled.
“Well. It would seem your brother Regulus left you a note attached to the block," Baxeka stated as he moved the paper around, "Let me see. Ah."
“Sounds like it may have been over stimulation,” Neville mumbled as he tried thinking it over. Theo bit his lip a little and then stood up suddenly. Neville jumped a little before settling back and scowling at Theo.
Harry entered the room, and upon seeing the scene laid before him slapped a hand over his mouth and turned away. After a moment he spoke, "That's Nagini isn't it?"
“Well, for one. You come in here quite often with another werewolf, and I’d rather not cross another of my kind. Plus, you’re Harry fuck’in Potter,” she laughed and smiled at him. When he didn’t relax, she released his arm and ran a hand through her hair. After a moment she crossed her arms over her chest and looked at him determinedly. “Fine, I’ll swear an unbreakable vow not to reveal that Harry Potter is a Kitsune,” she stated. Harry blinked, surprised.
Draco nodded as he stepped in, closing the door lightly behind him. He set the book down on a table to the side before approaching.
Sirius and Remus where basically bouncing in their seats before McGonagall nodded in their direction. Both stood up and walked over, almost jogging before stopping right in front of Harry. “Harry! I thought you said you were only the size of a pony!” Sirius stated, thinking back on the fire call they had last night.
Draco's eyes snapped into focus as his arm wrapped around Harry's and they both swam for the surface. Harry was the first out, pulling himself and Draco up onto the sharp edges of the clear barrier he'd shattered. As Harry finished climbing to safety he turned, tugging Draco the rest of the way up.
“Well, not exactly. I’m sure a lot of creatures won’t recognize the sent like I did. You just had bad luck.”
Draco groaned, he could hear her laughing at him right now. He’d told her repeatedly that it wasn’t like that, but she didn’t believe him. Not for a second, and during the Ball she was even less convinced. At some point he'd admitted to finding Harry attractive during fifth year, but then everything went to shit and Harry had almost killed him if not for Snape. He sighed and continued reading.
“You may be in awe now, but whatever spells he got hit with, or cursed with, is keeping him from returning to normal. If he stays like that for too long, like any other magically inherited creature, he’ll stay like that forever,” she snapped. The group went quiet, most of them staring off into the fire.
However when Hermione went to sit on Harry's bed Ghost's head shot up and he started to growl. Taken aback by the growling animal Hermione jumped away from the bed. "Harry?" she questioned, looking from the albino striped hyena to Harry.
Harry sat up then, still looking up at the eyes with a slight smile on his face. He was absolutely ready to leave, ready for what waited for him next yet.
"Of course, we won't need it after this, though. It is such a waste," LeFay smirked as his finger nail slid down the front of Draco's amethyst collar. With a resounding crack and an angry roar both Harry and Draco were on each other in an instant. As their mouths moved over each other they could feel their mentors circling each other, claws, teeth and horns classing as they fought for dominance, much the same as the couples tongues pushing again each other.
Draco was panting now from the exertion it was taking to try to stand on all four of his furry legs. When he felt Severus' hand on his shoulder he had half a mind to take it off at the joint, but the look on Severus' face made him instantly relax and he sat back down on his hind quarters.
“We’ll see you later Harry,” she said as she started to walk away. Theo stayed for a moment and looked Harry over before reaching into his pocket and then handing Harry a bay leaf.
Draco was at a loss for words as August lead him away, the collar around his neck scolding his skin. He could feel the pure rage and sorrow coming from LeFay in waves, it made him nauseous enough to be sick until the reached a further distance. "Is he going to be okay?" he asked August, looking over at the vampire. August didn't answer as he continued to lead Draco further away from the main hall. The swiftly entered a side room and Draco was pushed into a chair roughly. His eyes went wide as he was suddenly being held down with fangs barred in his face.
“Yes my Lord,” August turned to Cadmael with a look of both disgust and pity, “Cadmael has been both accused of, and admitted to, helping and spying for the enemy. He has given them information on our movements, as well as our safe house locations which were then attacked; leaving few survivors,” he paused, glancing Cadmael up and down, “However, it has also come to our attention that Cadmael has been, or may have been under several compulsion and suggestion charms. As well as having his memory whipped, or tampered with greatly,” he stopped a moment to let it sink in, and he could see the confusion spread across Cadmael’s face.
“If he doesn’t wake up by the time this potion is done brewing then I’ll start really worrying. For now, letting him rest. It might be for best,” Severus stated. Harry could tell the Professor was near the ends of his rope. His mask was down and Harry could read the emotions on his face as plain as day. Bill sat beside Charlie and peaked at his notes before his attention turned to Severus’ brewing.
“Can’t you chill?” Harry asked in-between taking another bite of his food. All he got back was, what he thought was, a tail thump. Harry rolled his eyes and finished eating, stretching and glancing around his room.
“On my mark, present,” Severus bellowed, using his wand to amplify his voice as the two combatants approached each other before bowing.
“While I’m not a fan of sharing,” he growled, “It isn’t unheard of people like us to take multiple mates. Even just as wizards it's still seen as vaguely normal. Obviously in pureblood lines it's frowned upon, but even then once there is a solid heir it isn’t unheard of for someone to take another partner. Unlike muggle society it isn’t illegal to be married to multiple people, though each one's marriage is still held separately financially unless all the partners are linked together by magic bonding, like us two are. I am, however, disappointed by your taste in men.”
“But, I made him,” LeFay couldn’t help but gag a little as he felt the satisfaction waft over him again.
LeFay watched Draco, his gaze never leaving him as the wizard looked around the room, stopping just a few feet from the steps up to his throne. He felt his stomach turn.
“It’s none of your business,” Draco replied, “Besides, you don’t need to know. It’s just considered the polite thing to do at ceremonies so that the other person has an idea of what they are getting into,” Draco explained broadly.
“What!? I was horrible to him as a wizard! Bloody hell I tried to kill him even!” LeFay threw up his hands.
Everyone in the room stayed quite as Sirius finished with a frown. He turned the letter over in his hands before taking a seat. His hands went to his face as Remus and Harry looked down at the table. The house-elves having already cleared away the dishes while they'd been preoccupied.
Something shot through Harry, so many emotions at once. "Soul vow," he whispered, slowly turning. He stepped towards Draco, seeing the blonde's eyes light up.
Severus' eyes narrowed at that. What had the man expected him to bring in? Something more akin to his Gryffindor house? He scoffed at the thought of having a lion wandering the halls. However, he had always planned on making Draco take on the role of Harry's familiar. Draco hadn't liked the idea and honestly he didn't either but he knew that if those two could get along they'd be a force to behold. So in the end, it was just based on what Draco's animagus form ended up being and what Snape could come up with to support that animal. "Do tell why you had that thought," Severus asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Hey,” he stated as he leaned against the frame of the kitchen doorway. Remus looked up from his tea only to have it shoot out his nose.
“Check his wounds,” Charlie whispered. Harry nodded and stepped around the head of the sleeping dragon. He was surprised to see how many wounds Draco had. Charlie must not have seen all of them because there was a lot more than what Charlie made it sound. Harry squatted down by one of them to inspect it further. A stump of an arrow shaft peaked out at him and Harry wrapped a hand around it, tugging on it experimentally. When Draco didn’t move, Harry tugged on it sharply, freeing the arrow head. Draco twitched but didn’t wake.
"You okay there?" Neville asked from across the room. Harry slowly held a thumbs up before pulling the curtains around his bed closed. He stretched slowly, careful of his chin now before grabbing his wand and casting his usual silencing charm around his bed. Ghost tilted his head as he watched Harry before the hyena shrugged and laid down at Harry's feet. Harry snuggled down into his blankets and set his wand to go off early so he could shower without any one else around to bother him in the morning.
Harry eyed the box warily before setting the letter aside and opening the box. Inside was a collar, and Harry was stunned by its craftsmanship. It sported Amethysts all around it with a large metal loop in the middle of it. It seemed to be made of the same black metal as his Black Heir ring, which he found intriguing. He looked for more information in the box but only found a small slip that told which charms where on it.
Sirius transformed back in the middle of the room and smiled as a huffing Remus came over to lean on him. “Harry, you’re up. We were just about to come wake you and tell you to get ready. So we could head to Gringotts. It’s better to get it out of the way now then later,” Sirius stated with a sly smile. Remus growled.
“He said my name. Well by one of the titles I have now. He called me LeFay in parsletongue before flipping out,” Harry explained as he stood beside the sleeping dragon and put his hand against the smooth scales.
LeFay was at the end of his leads, and Ammit hadn't come back from Hog's Head. It was starting to worry him, Ammit wasn't a snake that took his orders lightly. Being a familiar LeFay could feel him, but it felt off. Wrong some how, but he didn't have the time right now. And then there was this, he looked down at Draco again, swiping hair from the mans face.
Harry could feel Tatsuya’ irritation as they burst from the trees and what they saw was pure chaos. Quickly the group reverted to their wizard forms, watching the battle that unfolded near Hogwart’s gates.
Harry turned and looked back up at the dragon, only to have it as it turn itself and headed towards the water. Harry noted that the dragon still limped on his legs and the sun shimmered on his scales enough to light up the many wounds and scares littering the dragon’s body. Two more spears even poked out of the dragon’s hind quarters. There was also a couple feather tufted arrows in Draco's neck as well. The rest of the wounds, however, looked like they were healing well.
Snape’s shape morphed as he ran till a little black fox tailed the other two. Harry and Draco exchanged a look before Harry shrugged, morphing into his own form. When Harry opened his eyes he turned his head to look at Draco, noticing how the pale boy's mouth was hanging open as he stared at him. Draco didn’t have enough time to take it all in though as the Kistune form head butted him. Draco hurriedly climbed onto Harry’s back and grabbed hold of the neck fur.
Soon enough they were finished and Regulus, Harry, and Ghost made their way down Diagon Alley. They had already stopped at the tailor, and that been interesting to say the least. Regulus looked down at Harry, remembering just how nervous he had been while being measured. It also made him angry when Harry said he was fine in the clothes he had. The boy honestly felt like he didn't deserve them. It made him upset enough that Harry had thought he’d done something, and it took Regulus several minutes to convince him it wasn’t because of something he’d done, but what others had done to him. Ghost had helped by pulling Harry’s attention at the end, but he still couldn’t fathom what Harry had gone through to make him so fragile. If he ever had a chance to meet those muggles, he would destroy them himself. He was sure he wasn’t the only one that felt that way either.
The room turned silent. LeFay's eyes locked with August first, and the ancient vampire simply nodded before opening his mind. He could feel his Lord sifting through his thoughts. The steps of something more ancient then himself echoing in his mind. He could catch glimpses of his Lord's true form in his minds eye, however, looking directly at him was impossible. Even as one of the few vampires to live as long as he had, LeFay still had enough power to force August's gaze elsewhere even within his own mind. These mind numbing interrogations went on for hours as LeFay jumped from one person to the next, checking everyone for leaks, even ones they might not even know existed. Finally, he stopped, seeming to mull over everything he'd gathered.
Draco's eyes dropped as he tried to stay awake. His head resting on top of his arms as he rested everything on the side of the bed.
Soon the group came around the ex-Death Eaters. Spells fired off from either side of the fight, causing Draco to flinch when a stray spell passed over his head.
Hermione, along with the rest of the group, were pale. “Then, all these years…” Herm stopped, the thought was just too much. She wrapped her arms around herself as the weight of everything come down on her. “LeFay…” she whispered.
“This will only take a few moments,” Ulkalb said as he noticed Harry and Ghost cuddling up on one of the chairs, “I’m sure your charge is drained,” he added, addressing the four adults in the room. They nodded and then sat around the table, fixing accounts that needed to be rearranged as well as planning their next move with the goblins. The goblins had enough push with the rest of the wizarding world that Lucius was happy to use their help in the lawsuits and criminal actions they were about to file on both Albus and the British Wizengamot.
"Yes Ron. It's better to know then not to know. Now Harry, did Professor Snape or Dumbledore tell you anything else other than him becoming your familiar?" Hermione asked, still trying to figure out the puzzle.
Harry stopped reading, blinking a few times before looking up at Draco. “That was weird. It was almost like I could see the pictures, like the cat,” he paused and noticed Draco was laughing quietly. “What!?”
LeFay had his back to the wall, pinned between it and Severus. Yet, even in that position, LeFay seemed to be the one on the offensive and that Severus was the one trapped.
Draco was having fun as he chased the poor boy up the stairs and into the dorms, snapping at Neville's heels. They burst into the dorm room, and rather than head for the bathroom like a smart person Neville fled to his bed and pulled the curtains closed around it. Draco chuckled to himself as he rounded the corner of the door, peeking into the area of beds. Lifting his nose he sniffed deeply. Draco grinning, thinking about how scared Neville must be right now; he'd honestly never get a chance like this again right?
“Dinner is ready. Master LeFay asks you to come to his study for dinner. He will be there shortly after,” the house elf stood till Draco nodded and then bowed before apparating.
Everyone's eyes were still on the odd pair, and those closest tried to eves drop on the headmaster's conversation. Yet, as their conversation wore on the hall started to regain the volume of conversation it had before, the fascination of the hyena starting to ebb.
Skoll stepped into the light of the sun, a grim smile on his face, "Hati, what are you doing? Don't tell me you are pestering new-." Skoll stopped when he caught sight of Draco, eyebrows lifting. "Lord Malfoy..."
Dark hair. Fair skin. Pointed, sharp, and yet graceful features. Draco could see why six years ago everyone wanted LeFay, but he knew something they all didn't. That man had baggage. Lots of it, and it was a mess.
August stood back for a moment, his arms crossing his chest. The brat wasn't lying, but he still didn't think this was a good idea. LeFay wasn't in his right mind right now, and bonding to this, this, barely hatched egg wasn't going to go well. August cursed under his breath, he couldn't believe he was going threw with this. "Look, without Ammit..." he paused, looking over Draco in one last effort to possibly convince himself to forgo LeFay's sudden plan, but he couldn't. The crazed man had some reason for choosing this child and it wasn't his place to butt in. Perhaps if Draco'd shown up later, but now?
Harry stood up after closing his chest as quietly as he could and then turned, about to walk towards the bathroom before stopping. He tilted his head at Ghost and then gestured at the bathroom. "Are you coming or what?" Harry asked. Ghost tilted his head from side to side and looked kind of puzzled before jumping down from the bed and following Harry into the bathroom. "I'd rather not leave you out there to terrorize everyone in their sleep," Harry stated as he walked down to the open air showering area. Ghost made a noise that sounded a lot like human laughter before head butting Harry's leg. He gave Harry a look that just said he was up to no good. "Besides, you can be my look out rather than me putting up tripping jinxs," Harry added.
Draco shook his head, "You're right. You aren't Harry, not the one I've known for seven years at Hogwarts. Not the one they knew in the war. Not the one Albus shaped to fit his own special mold," he paused to take a breath and removed his hand form LeFay's mouth.
“Come on in. I’ll get some tea going to warm you up,” she said soothingly. Draco stepped past her, taking in everything about the house all at once. It was very small, maybe only having three rooms. He headed into the front room were three men stood up when he entered. “This young man got caught out in the storm,” the woman said from behind him. Slowly the three men sat back down, eyeing Draco as he stood there while the woman went into the kitchen.
Harry was furious, seven blocks? Was Dumbledore trying to kill him?! He was glad the old goat was dead. He couldn’t believe he had cried when the bastard died! Harry could even see that in Sirius’ eyes his godfather felt the same. No one hurt his godson and got away with it. Yet this man had?! This man that he had trusted with Harry’s life. Sirius growled. “Enough with that,” Remus said as he rolled his shoulders and then pulled out a box with a letter on top of it. “You asked if we had gotten the Hogwarts letter yet. We have. You were out for about a month and a half, give or take the few days you were awake but out of it. We took the liberty of starting to gather your required class items, but we still need to get you a new familiar. Hedwig was a great owl and won’t ever be replaced but you need to find another familiar. Since we have the family owl and my own I would advise broadening you choices when we go out rather than worrying about one that will be able to send mail back and forth. We also, with the goblin’s permission, gained copies of your inheritance test and family tree along with these rings.”
Harry continued to stare at Ammit and bit his lip before he leaned back, laying his head on Ammit’s body and curling up with the snake.
Over the past six years he had been able to make a new name for the Malfoys; claiming his rightful place as Lord along with moving back into Malfoy manor with his mother. Sirius and Remus came over to visit often with their son Teddy, as well as Snape when he was in a good mood. When he stepped into the room he found Narcissa talking to a very excited looking Sirius and Remus while Teddy was playing with blocks on the floor. Snape sat in a seat not too far away, shaking his head.
Draco glared at Harry’s back before looking over at the four-poster bed. It had curtains to keep the heat in, so that was nice, but he wanted to gag at the idea of sharing a bed with Potter. How was he supposed to sleep in the same bed as that mass of fur. And those damn tails! He groaned and then sat down on his chest.
“Who was that anyways?” Draco asked out of curiosity. Harry shrugged in reply and popped another slice into his mouth, crunching happily for a moment.
“How did you find me?," Lefay asked in unison with Tatsuya; their voices' vibrating together, "I’m awfully curious."
“How do you feel about all of this?” Harry asked, turning his head to look at Bill for a second before concentrating on a bramble that had snared his leg.
Draco started at the fox man in front of him in shock. Hearing him say his name had startled him out of his rage and he just sat there. The man hissed at the snake and it hissed back before lowering its body from its striking position. Draco was sure that if the snake had lunged he wouldn’t have been able to free himself. Then it finally clicked as he remembered the earlier conversation. His eyes narrowed. “Harry.”
'I understand you felt like you didn't get a chance to live your life to the fullest, and I promise you, I will keep looking for a way to separate our consciousness. To give you you're own body, but right now? Right now I need you to let me live my life. Lately you've been tearing the controls right out of my hands and it isn't fair. Just because you don't feel like you got your full life, doesn't mean you can take mine from me.'
Harry skidded to a stop, having to use his arms to steady himself as he almost hit the ground. There, in a small halo of light stood the boy from before. Harry stared at him and took a step forward, splashing red water onto his leg. "Draco?" he asked softly and his voice seemed to echo. The boy didn't turn around, only continuing to yell Harry's name. "Draco! Draco, I'm right here!" Flashes of memory went by as he started walking, then running to the other adolescent. "DRACO!" he yelled louder, this time the boy turned. Slowly at first till he saw Harry over his shoulder and then his eyes widened.
There was low whispering and something scrapping across the ground but nothing came towards him. Slowly Draco stood, squinting into the darkness.
“The Wizamgot gained quite a few new seats and kicked out a few members that had been sitting in others. When they went to look at the Goblets, Mister Potter’s name was inscribed on them. That was before the seats all morphed together and left only one. The Black seat however was obvious. It would also seem that Severus has followed suite after hearing about Black being able to claim his title. He now sits on the Prince Throne. Speaking of Lord Black and Lord Potter, where are they?” Narcissa stared, both eyebrows raised.
Harry started giggling. “It would seem that having your animagus form mistaken for the Grim wasn't as off as we thought it was. Makes a lot more sense now,” Lupin snickered. Sirius frowned and was about to say something snappy at his lover when he felt his ears move. His hands shot up to the sides of his head as Harry's giggling grew louder. There. Sitting atop his head was two delicate darkened wolf-like ears. Thankfully they blended well into hair.
"Are you sure about that?" Hati's eyes shone gold for a moment before someone came jogging up to the balcony's entrance.
Draco noticed but didn’t say anything, already deeming himself the one that should watch their backs. Mostly because he had more control of his inheritance.
“We have a plan, but we are going to need your help, with him like this we’ll need someone to bear as a witness since we won’t be able to do the full ritual,” Draco stated as he pulled out the small bowl and knife they’d brought, along with a long vile filled with a potion Severus instantly recognized.
“Knew what Severus. What are you two talking about?” she squeaked, “Explain yourselves this instant, we have to find Potter!”
Narcissa set her cup down after she finished her tea. The small talk with Remus had been pleasing, and after laying out the ground rules Narcissa was overall very pleased with the situation.
"Nope, just me and this guy," Harry stated as he patted Ghost's back. Ghost let out what sounding like a human grunt before he opened his lazy eyes to look over at Ron and Hermione. Harry watched the hyena snort and then close it's eyes again, completely ignoring his two friends.
After they were cleaned up and changed, Harry headed to the sitting room to talk to Sirius and Remus. He wanted to know who was dropping him off at the train before it left for Hogwarts in a few days. Instead he found Draco there, sitting on the love seat and drinking tea by the fire. The horns he had sported were gone, instead he held a book in his hands. One Harry hadn't seen before. He also noted that Draco’s nails where a bit like his own at the moment. Yet, Draco’s were curved like talons and almost completely black except for the tips. Against the white cover of the book Draco held, they were stunning. Harry wondered why he hadn’t noticed them before but decided it was probably do to Draco choice of outerwear.
“So, Kristian. What are you thinking?” he asked as he looked down at her from the stool he stood on. Kristian tilted her head as she finished her circle around him, holding up her fingers like a camera frame. It had been an hour since they had started and it almost seemed like they had gotten nowhere. He hoped Sirius was taking his time shopping.
“Too obvious,” Remus stated, “Though it doesn’t really matter since everyone pretty much knows what Harry is.”
Harry explained to the disgruntled snake. Slowly his familiar calmed and rested comfortably on the bed. Harry sighed and went over to sooth Ammit, stoking his scales.
“Harry! I’m terribly sorry, he is young and still coming to terms with his responsibilities.” Sirius sounded stressed as he spoke. There was a loud bang in the room and a few loud gasps before the doors flew open. Harry stood in the doorway huffing for air, startled by the fact Draco was standing outside.
Harry came skating around the corner, dropping the vials and jars a little to hard on the table. "Shouldn't we change him back?" Harry asked, his eyes scanning the bloody fur.
“Alice Longbottom, Frank Longbottom, and Albus Dumbledore,” the goblin spoke. Severus sneered and looked over at a very angry Sirius and Remus, positioned on either side of Harry.
Neville spoke up, a smile on his face. "I was telling Seamus about how Ghost chased me into my bed and he told me that only a coward would be afraid of a beast like Ghost. So to prove his point he went over and tried to hug Ghost, Ghost didn't like it very much," he stated, his eyes lighting up quite a bit when Ghost seemed to grin at him.
“Basically, you’re like a prince in both the wizarding community and creature community,” Sirius stated proudly, earning him very quick glare from Remus.
“However, if your familiar is to attack anyone unprovoked, and/or with the intent to kill, you and your familiar will be expelled. Is that clear?” Mistress McGonagall looked at Harry, narrowing her eyes. She could still recognize Harry, but his new appearance shocked her. Even more so was the fact he hadn’t yet been able to control his magic completely. She could feel it even now; the overwhelming presence in the room and it prickled at the back of her neck.
“For the most part. Ashliegh is late, but she almost always is. Skoll and Douglas are bringing in Cadmael, I plan on questioning him with veritaserum, brewed by Severus so there shouldn’t be any wiggling his way out of it. Compulsion charms or not. Severus will also be present, but more so to deliver the rest of Cadmael’s potions. I have a feeling after this last round he’ll come to really realize what he’d done,” he paused, “Which is why I need you here.”
“I bind this vow,” Harry answered as his voice faltered and added the Knotweed. The fire went out in a puff of blue smoke and sparks as he felt the magic cascade over him. He watched Narcissa shiver before smiling at him and leaving.
“I just thought you would have felt the magic in the book. It’s enchanted. All the poems in the book are made like a muggle movie. While you are reading it, it creates a picture in front of your eyes,” Draco explained. Harry frowned at the book and then handed it back to Draco.
“Bloody hell, what it this collar meant to fit on!” he cried. It was massive, taking up the whole top of the desk with part of it even hanging off the side. There was a knock at the door that startled him and he hurriedly shrunk the collar back down to its original size. “One moment! I’m getting dressed!” he called.
Draco felt Potter tense up beside him and stop. Looking up he then followed the raven-haired wizard's gaze to Ginny who stared back in the same stunned fashion. "Hello Ginny," Harry stated as he started towards them. Hermione frowned at the approach but didn't say anything back.
“I want to help,” silence. “I want to help look for the dragon and find Parvati and Draco. I know you said I shouldn’t blame myself but it’s my fault for putting both of them in the position that I did,” Harry kept his voice hard as he spoke. There was a moment of silence before Remus and Sirius started talking at once.
Severus grimaced. He already knew Dumbledore had used them, and this only gave life to what he'd witnessed and didn't want to believe. "Tell me more," he said softly.
He'd completely forgot about Harry's 'tutoring' session, and Draco's stomach turned at the thought of it. Snape planned on telling Harry everything; Draco's faked death and that he was Ghost. It only had been a day but Draco felt he'd made a connection with Potter in such a short time as Ghost. Thinking about how Harry would react made his stomach sour, and the idea of how many hours of progress he made with Harry made his mood worse.
Tatsuya smiled as they walked down the hall. Every mirror they passed in the hall held a glimpse of Tatsuya in all his terrifying glory. Those passing by either stopped to half bow or gave LeFay an extra-large gap of room. Ammit slithered along the ground behind them as they walked, hissing at those that didn’t pay attention.
Well as close as he could get. His hair still trailed down to his thigh, along with his features still being predominantly sharper.
“If it was easy to find me I’d have Reeta Skeeter sniffing around all the time,” LeFay said as he sat down onto the throne. He kept his eyes on Draco as the man stared defiantly up at him.
Feet slapped against wet floors again, but it didn’t last long as he peeked out from the darkness into the light. He stepped out onto soft grass and he could feel it under his bare feet. He looked down, only to realize they weren’t feet, but delicate large paws. He tried to get a better look, only to realize he wasn’t controlling himself. He started to panic a little as he heard a loud roar coming from the forest in front of him. His view shifted and he felt himself moving forward, moving his head as if it would get caught on something. There was a loud crash and another loud roar and the trees shuddered. He looked wide eyed at a giant purple eye that opened between the trees. He felt himself look directly at it before his mind was filled with screaming. He started running from the thunderous roar, slipping and tumbling. The last thing he saw was jaws closing over him and what, sounded like, Draco screaming his name.
LeFay stared at him, taking in the startled looking dragon man in front of him. Apparently he didn't know the extent of what his magic really did to Draco, and he felt the sudden pain of guilt when he caught the look of fear in Draco's eyes along with something else. "You do deserve a chance, especially if what you are trying to point out is true," LeFay stated quietly, slowly nodding. "If you really want to peruse this, I won't stop you. Now I need to tend to the other events of
Lucius frowned, "He's stable, but hasn't woken." Draco cursed, pulling the blankets tighter around his arms. "I'm sorry, but we don't know that much about anima reddetur votum. Soul bonding has been lost to the sands of time, I'm not even sure how Harry knew about it."
“There should be clearing up ahead where we can take a rest at,” Remus stated and pulled ahead of the group with Sirius close at his heels. Charlie followed with Snape, striking up a conversation about the potions he brought.
“Yea. Since I work here all the time I’m already use to how you smell, and I’ve run into a Kitsune before," she half shrugged, "I don’t really remember how it happened because I was young, but the scent I remembered. So… I pieced two and two together.”
Ghost let out a low woop, and started sniffing the collar before sitting down and proudly exposing his neck. Harry chuckled and as he held the collar up to Ghost it already started to change size to fit the hyena perfectly. The charms dangled around his neck, along with another tag in the shape of a little snake appearing on the collar, scrawled on the front and back of it appeared Ghost.
Draco stiffened a bit before relaxing. It must have gotten close to the point Harry told him about. He felt bad for both Cadmael and Lord LeFay. To get the others to trust Cadmael again, LeFay, Harry, would have to air out all his dirty laundry.
"How have the two of you been getting along so far?" Severus asked slowly. Ghost's head picked up quickly and he seemed to shake his head vigorously no but Snape ignored him. "I have to say, I didn't think you'd warm up to him so quickly," he paused then mumbled under his breath, "This could be a problem."
Harry was wide eyed as well, holding his hand close to his chest as his heart pounded. "No, he didn't. But he surprised me. Why don't you guys just sit on Ron's bed," he suggested. Hermione nodded and then sat down on the bed next to Harry's, Ron eyes the beast warily before sitting down as well. Ghost eyed the two before laying his head back down on his paws. Harry let out the breath he didn't realize he had been holding and then closed the book he had been reading and sat up.
“It’s dragon hide. From an Antipodean Opaleye. It’s pretty rare to find one of that quality,” Draco stated. Harry was surprised and gingerly opened the book to the multi colored shimmering ribbon Draco left when he closed it.
Severus nodded and took his seat, a house elf appearing with tea as he did. He thanked the house elf quietly before looking over at Lucius, his face blushing ever so slightly when he met the other man's eyes. "Yes, I do believe I need answers. This is all too confusing, and I know that I know some of it, but not all. Only what Lucius was able to tell me just after the incident."
“Your mother understands what needs to be done!” Remus growled. Draco snarled as his eyes flashed purple. Narcissa stood up and put a hand on her son’s shoulder, her grip tightening when both men looked like they were about to leap at each other’s throats.
LeFay glanced around, making sure no one followed before looking up at the large hedge maze ahead of him. In the darkness the deep purple flowers mixed with blue covered the sides of the maze, creating a sense of longing for something when LeFay gazed at them.
“I thought the trail would be easier to follow since the dragon was quite large, but it seems like something might be helping it cover its tracks,” Charlie stated, looking concerned. Snape looked a bit put off by that comment as he sat on the rock.
Severus swallowed, he still wasn't use to this new appearance. "I underestimated the strength of their ties. I apologize, it won't happen again."
The changes happened slowly: at first the room started spinning and then Draco felt himself starting to sweat.
LeFay seemed to have slipped into a thin long sleeve shirt and tight jeans and the clothes made Draco smile.
“Yea…Headmistress, the castle is warded from letters getting in that are not immediate family correct?” his attention turning from the table to McGonagall.
“The man that left today. LeFay. He is the real one. I reckon he has a lot of grudges now from being held back all these years. All that he endured while being silenced,” Draco's face fell.
At first, Sirius read silently; starting to read aloud when he noticed the importance of the letter.
Harry blinked, nodding slowly as he stared at the ground. The words Draco spoke seemed to spark something in Harry as he shrugged off whatever had been bothering him.
Draco couldn’t believe his mother. He'd said he would deal with it yet she'd still gone and wrote a letter to that damned Potter. He sneered at the thought. A Malfoy taking handouts from a Potter, never.
“He wouldn’t, he was like a father..” Cadmael mumbled, his head starting to hang as his knees buckled and he knelt on the floor.
Tatsuya's mind was stunned, giving LeFay a chance to gain control again. He could feel blood flowing down their back and Harry braced himself for the next attack only to hear a loud roar above them. Looking up he saw something block out the moon just before it landed on top of them; he was sure they would be crushed.
"That would have been Lord Malfoy, and I am astonished that not even the vampires in the room seemed to piece the hair and outfit together."
LeFay frowned, his nails digging into his arms. “I need you to check Albus’ grave and report to me about what you find.”
“Down,” LeFay stated, gesturing with a tail for Draco to lower himself completely to the ground. The dragon chuckled at the request, his tail flicking as he eyed the small demonic looking fox below him. Did he really think he’d give in that easily. Harry really didn’t know anything about what they were, did he.
Sighing, LeFay leaned back in his seat as he watched the smoky silhouette of Tatsuya continue to book browse. LeFay couldn’t stop the small smirk from forming across his face.
“I bind this vow,” Harry spoke softly, his eyes locking onto Draco’s. They shone hungrily with the same hue as the deep violet fire between them. Harry quickly dropped in the Knotweed, watching the fire go out in a puff of purple smoke and sparks. Draco’s eyes faded back to their original color as he left.
Tatsuya pointed out without hesitation. LeFay growled quietly and leaned back in his seat. He had told Draco quite a bit already...
“Well, Remus is out of tea so I thought I’d get more while we were out. I’ll head there after I swing by Slug & Jiggers to grab the rest of the ingredients you need for school. Maybe something for Snape too. I have lots to make up for,” Sirius paused as he went down the list with his finger, “How about you head over to Madam Malkin’s and get some new clothes fitted so you aren’t cutting up the ones you already have. Plus, you should get some new dress robes; since we don’t have to worry about money as much. Don’t go crazy though! While she’s getting the robes ready for you, go ahead and head over to Potage’s to get two new cauldrons. It says here that one should be brass and the other a normal pewter. Afterwards we’ll meet back at Malkin’s before heading to Menagerie so you can choose a new familiar.” Harry nodded and then started to head off to Malkin’s when Sirius grabbed his wrist to turn him back. “One last thing, be careful,” he said quietly, his whole face still.
“No, we aren’t,” they both stated together. The emerald eyes shimmered as they smiled. “We just didn’t expect this, nor his request to get to know us better.” Harry and Tatsuya exchanged a knowing look in their mental room while in Kitsune form.
“Easy Draco… It’s Harry. Remember me?” he asked, keeping his hand pressed to the damp scales. Draco sniffed him, the air coming from his nose causing Harry’s clothes and hair to fly around. Harry could have sworn he felt a sort of happiness from the dragon before it lifted its head to turn to the approaching group. Draco hissed at them, his head twisted and lips peeling back to reveal killer teeth. Charlie stopped, spreading out his arms to stop the others.
Harry sighed, flicking a rock in no particular direction as he thought about all that transpired. Tatsuya seemed to be regarding him silently before he stood up and started to walk away. He could feel the vibrations from his Tatsuya's steps even when he was a good distance away. The power that radiated of the Kitsune was massive.
"Am I interrupting anything?" he asked as he closed the door, eyes switching between the other three in the room. Tom, Voldemort, stood from his desk and shook his head.
“What's with the faces?” Harry asked as he finished shifting back and straightening his clothes. Severus was just about to speak up when Bill cut in.
Minerva sat down on the bed and patted Harry’s hand. “It’s not your fault that Parvati and Draco are missing, I want you to know that,” she said softly before looking over at Bill and Charlie. “Does any of that help you two, Snape?”
Hermione smiled at him, though in the back of her head she was worried. Would Harry really pull this off?
The goblin patted the papers and then pulled out a few keys, each of them floating to the respective recipients. “First, there is the matter of the secret keeper. As listed here in the will, the secret keeper was indeed Peter Pettigrew, and not Sirius. It would seem the reports and investigation on Sirius Black would be wrong. Though, we’ve had enough evidence now for a while since most death-eaters were dropped off at Azkaban, including Pettigrew, not too long ago,” Ulkalb said, glancing over at Regulus with a knowing look. Regulus nodded and he could just make out the anger and Albus’ face.
"Im saying you're selling yourself short. You're forgetting that the real you was there the whole time, just taking backseat. The moment I saw you again after the war I didn't even recognize you. When we bumped in the hall back at Black Manor that day," Draco paused as he saw Harry close his eyes.
Hisashi smiled, “Those that then abuse that trust, and don’t listen to their followers are the true monsters. Now, I’ll leave you two alone,” he snickered before disappearing in a flurry of flower seeds, blowing across the maze before settling and leaving the two men by themselves.
A vampire hive had been seen camping out in the Forest of Rothiemurchus, and along with them there had been sighting of the new Dark Lord, Lord LeFay, meeting with. Draco’s breath caught in his throat as he flipped the letter over. Stuck to it was a moving picture of said Dark Lord entering an abandoned looking cabin.
“Harry, are you okay?” came a worried voice. Harry squinted in the bright light, and looked up at the face of a very worried Remus; Sirius coming close behind him like a worried hen.
Severus could feel his emotion bubbling to the surface and he had to turn away. "You were not yourself," he stated quietly.
Snape's brow lifted as though Albus had just started speaking Gobbledegook. "So, you are accusing me of possibly putting him in danger with something he couldn't handle on purpose just to hurt him?" Severus questioned, though it was more of statement.
“We should get him to bed. He’ll be confused when he wakes up, and we’ll need to explain everything to him when he wakes,” Draco said as he squeezed Harry’s shoulder.
“Come in Lady Malfoy… Master Remus is waiting in the drawing room for you." Narcissa stepped inside and nodded in acknowledgment as Draco glanced around the Manor behind her. “This way,” Kreacher grumbled as he started towards the hall. Draco watched his mother follow, but took his own time to admire the decor of the house. He was surprised by the fact the place seemed, tasteful.
Streaks of dirt replaced the tears he wiped away, glancing at the place Harry once stood. He could still feel the power radiating through him from the blast; and that creature...
“I second,” Snape sneered. “No use in telling him everything if he can’t pull it off.” McGonagall sighed and rolled her eyes, something Harry had not seen before.
Draco cut him off quickly, "And I said that's not what I wanted," Draco sighed. "The purpose of getting to know you better is so I can figure out my own feelings..." LeFay's eyebrows rose as he looked over him.
“If he is not in his grave, then go here. Ask for Douglas and tell him the phoenix resurrected. Now I’m late for a meeting with one of the centaur tribes,” LeFay said as he started for the door. Draco got up quickly, grabbing one of Lord LeFay’s wrists without thinking.
“I don’t know how she plans on getting any of the money or ‘support’ she talked about. Dumbledore stated that because of Regulus’ disappearance I wouldn’t be able to claim the Lordship. Since the ring disappeared with him that is,” Sirius stated. Harry’s eye brows furrowed.
Draco understood though. He understood full well what Sirius was hinting to. This was the real unbound Harry LeFay. The real man he would have known if Harry's inheritance wasn't locked away for so many years.
Sorry about the wait, and because of how short it is. Also excuse the writing, I know its not on par with what I normally write. Hopefully it'll get better as I go forward. Thanks so much for everyone that's stuck through with this.
The first thing Harry heard when he stepped out of the floo was a very angry Remus yelling at the other end of the Manor. Sirius was already gone from the sitting room, so Harry guessed that Sirius had already gone to try and remedy the situation. Harry shook his head in amusement before turning down the hall and making his way to the attic. That was until a very flustered Draco Malfoy stormed out of a room and straight into Harry Potter.
Snape was finishing putting the potions together when he heard a knock on his door. Sighing, he popped the potions into his carrying bag, and then went to open the door. He opened it, surprised when he was face to face with LeFay. He took a step back into the room, casting a quick glance around the room.
Just then something made a noise to his right and Draco looked up from his day dreaming. A door he hadn't noticed before creaked open; peaking his interest.
Remus continued. “The others where on specific abilities; including your creature inheritance, animagus abilities, and parseltongue abilities. Which by the way, you’re parseltongue ability did not come from Voldemort like Albus said. You are in fact related to Salazar Slytherin. Distantly… but it’s there.”
There was a long pause in the room as the keys and chest floated over to their respective owners. Severus gritted his teeth for a moment before speaking. “Who were the witnesses to their wills?”
Severus shook his head before holding out his hand. Two potion bottles where held out to him and Draco took them hesitantly.
“So, you see, the collar was the best we could do. It helped repel the curses still clinging to you and boosted your own magic’s defenses. It may not be under the best circumstances but Lord LeFay’s magical core is keeping you in balance right now,” Professor Snape ended.
"HELLO?!" Harry tried again, this time cupping his hands around mouth. He ignored the eyes above him watching him as he listened.
Tatsuya agreed, and the two turned from the pensive before heading down the hall to where Cadmael was currently being treated. He nodded at the nurses as he passed before stopping at the foot of the bed. “August,” he said politely, greeting the elder vampire. August nodded at him from his position at the top of the bed, setting down the book he’d been reading.
the dragon hissed. Harry stiffened, green pupil-less eyes widening as he saw the recognition in Draco's eyes. He took a step forward and touched his nose to Draco’s. The dragon pulled its head back after a moment and shook its head rather valiantly. Scaring Harry and causing him to panic as he looked back and forth between the dragon’s suddenly spasming muscles and the way Draco tossed his head.
Tatsuya laughed in Harry’s head. Harry rolled his eyes. It was no time for jokes, they needed to get back to Hogwarts!
Harry headed up to the attic after goodnight hugs from his two fathers, he was so happy he felt like he was floating. Grinning stupidly, he closed the attic door behind him and made his way across the room. Soon he’d be turning eighteen and headed to his 8
A hand feel onto Harry's shoulder, and he heard a hiss of pain as the hand was removed. "Tell everyone that I will be indisposed for the remainder of the night," LeFay stated quietly, his eyes darting to the double doors were Draco stood, his face pale. August nodded his head as he rubbed his hand, looking down at the acid burn he'd received just from touching his Lord in his current state.
“Not exactly. I remember changing and it was all fine up to before Bubo pushed the window open,” he sighed and gripped the cup a little tighter. “I didn’t hurt anyone, right?”
Harry pushed his hand away and then shrugged as he turned away and headed over to get his books for the next class period.
Draco blushed, turning to watch Harry leave and then clearing his throat. “Mother was definitely right about him maturing nicely…,” Draco muttered, then caught himself, “Stop it Draco, that’s gross. And he is straight you know that,” Draco chided himself as he got everything ready for his own class and headed out.
“I hope you remember me from earlier Lord Black," Baxeka Dragoon stated before looking over at the other goblins, "Here we will be doing the inheritance tests, along with any Pureblood houses that appear and need to be filled. First, we will do you, and then Professor Lupin. Potter will go last since he is the youngest." Baxeka paused for a moment as he shuffle through some papers. “Since these inheritance tests will affect your vaults and any other archived information you have here at Gringotts each of you will be tested by your own private vault keepers.” He went on to introduce the two other goblins; Zalex Cogdigger, who oversaw the Potter accounts since Griphook had been killed, and Ypxie Kneesprocket, a female goblin to Harry’s surprise, that oversaw Lupin’s vaults.
"Then do it." Severus nodded and moved, collecting what he needed with out thinking. The blood from Draco was easy to get and as he reached out for Harry's hand he met a startlingly mature gaze.
William was one of the two vampires currently sworn to LeFay. (Well, them and all of their bloodline as well.)
Harry stared down at the letter with a mixture of embarrassment and awe. An inheritance test? That sounded pretty important. Maybe he could find out more about his family! He looked over at Remus and tried to keep a straight face. “They have inheritance tests?” he asked.
Sirius was at the alter setting everything up, he wanted everything to go right for Narcissa's and Draco's vows.
Tom, Severus, and Lucius would hang back for most of it, saying in the other room for the will reading and hanging back while they shopped. This way Albus wouldn’t start piecing anything together. They wanted this to look like just one man behind the will reading, Regulus. A man suddenly back from the dead that was claiming Potter as his own. They couldn’t let Albus know there were others, or he might become threatened and try something too soon. No, they still needed time to set everything right.
After paying they made their way outside; Harry using his own money to buy a few other things for Ghost before they finally left. Now Ghost had his collar, a few sweaters Harry had bought for the colder months, and some booties for the snow when it came around to it. Ghost, Draco, wasn’t so fond of the sweaters, but he had a feeling those dog booties would be a lifesaver once it started snowing.
"I'm sure that is true... I just, knew him, Fenrir, personally," Draco explained, "Draco Mafloy," Draco added as he extended his hand.
Everyone's attention turned to the side door where a dark shadow appeared. It moved slowly towards them, a small sigh of disappointment coming from as they entered the lighting of the room.
“Sirius was able to fix the internal damage from staying with my Uncle; broken bones, torn muscles, punctured organs. Everything that my magic was holding together,” Harry trailed off, “but he wasn’t able to get rid of the scars. I used to wear glamours all the time but with my magic all wacked out, it’s hard to keep them up. So, I gave up the third day you were here. I didn’t think you’d ever stumble on me without a shirt on.”
He sighed and then handed Harry a shard of glass. “Look through this, Bill was able to enchant it to see different spells and curses,” Charlie stated.
“Sire?” Douglas asked as he looked up at LeFay, “Has something happened? You stopped mid-sentence.” Douglas stayed kneeling but, like the other three in the room, their heads lifting from being bowed when Douglas spoke.
“My mother! I knew she was up to something!” Draco practically shouted. Both Charlie and Snape snapped to attention with their wands drawn. When they noticed what the situation they put them back into their respective holsters.
“Now, Harry… About the blocks, you had more than a couple," Remus bit his lip, "And honestly we aren't sure how you've survived,” he said flatly, pulling a paper out of his pocket. Sirius’ expression turned dark when he glanced at it. “Any normal person would have died, but it seems that your Kitsune inheritance was, thankfully, able to soften the blow.” Harry stared at the floor for a long moment as he took in the information. It had been that bad? “There were seven blocks! One was on your core which is highly illegal!” Remus snapped angrily, slapping the paper with the back of his hand before looking back at a startled Harry.
“In a way, yes. I-I was suggested to visit a mind healer, but with Tatsuya’s presence,” LeFay trailed off.
"Fine, but only for tonight. I still want to get to know you better first," he yawned as he crawled into the bed. LeFay followed suite, banishing most of their clothes before crawling under the covers.
Rather than Hogwarts being nice and fluffy like Harry thought it would be after having the war over, it has turned out to be extremely stressful. Between Draco sharing a room with him and the new classes, along with the over headed feeling of being watched by everyone, how is any one suppose to focus.
The woman clapped her hands together, drawing him out of his thoughts as tape measures flew at him. “Enough of that, let’s see. What did you want today?” she asked him as he stepped onto a slightly raised platform so she could measure him better.
There was a small noise in the door way that drew his attenion jsut as Harry's eyes flickered open. "Snape?" Harry said softly, very confused as to why his professor was standing over him.
Harry’s grip tightened in Draco’s hair, and Draco could feel the wave of pain and worry hit him through their bond. He kept his eyes on Cadmael as the man’s eyes suddenly widened, and he could see the panic and fear start to blossom on the beastman’s face. He was shaking valiantly, looking like he was on the verge of either vomiting or passing out. Draco could feel Harry’s grip tighten even more as Harry readied himself to speak again.
Dragoon laughed loudly, “Of course it is, and its a lot more important than you'd think!" the goblin wiped at the tears that had formed from laughing, "Typically, they are mistaken for animal spirits but are based more around what Americans would call a hellhound. Yet, they are more like griffins; asked to protect treasures or areas of significant importance. Like temples. Though, the legends of seeing a Grim and dying soon after are half true, being, that is, they are on the darker side of creature inheritances. They are able to alter peoples luck, or rather curse them with bad luck which often results in their death,” he explained.
“Well, when we did the inheritance test the goblins said I had blocks on my magic. When they removed them my creature inheritance tried to right the damage. Trust me, it was a lot worse before I put on the Lord Rings,” Harry explained and then showed his friend his hand. Neville smiled and inspected them, his attention was caught by the fox one.
Skoll, one of Fenrir Greyback's sons; having joined after his father's dead, spoke, "Speaking of which. You said you had new information last time you sent out orders."
“I’m sorry we didn’t tell you beforehand Lord LeFay, I honestly thought you had already known. Especially with your creature inheritance, I'd thought Black would have gone over everything with you,” Severus explained. “You see, collaring is something very common in the wizarding community, especially among those with creature inheritances. Some will do it for protection, while others do it for-,” Severus paused trying to find the right words.
Without warning they where launched into the air and LeFay found himself almost falling off if not for his claws. Draco didn't even seem to notice them digging into his scales as the got settled into flight.
Draco hits a bit of a snag in his plans, he never thought he'd actually find being around Harry Potter pleasant.
"You couldn't have known Severus. You were too young, and I was already too lost," Tom stated quietly.
Big violet eyes narrowed at him before the dragon snorted. Harry smiled sheepishly and chanced a glance at Charlie only to have the dragon growl at him. He looked back at the dragon, still half smiling. “Charlie...,” Harry hissed quietly.
LeFay grumbled and then glared up at Draco, grumbling to himself at this impossible feat. “Well, you heard him,” LeFay shouted.
“Harry! Try your animagus form!” Charlie hollered. Harry lifted his head from his knees and stared down the dragon before standing up. He stood there thinking for a moment as the dragon eyed him warily.
“No,” Cadmael replied sharply, “No, that was my choice. I fell in love with you, and I tried to convince him you weren’t evil, that what he thought wasn’t true!” He gagged sharply again as another wave of memories triggered, vomit spewing out between his hands as his stomach lurched.
Lefay hissed back to the snake. Draco watched silently, the hair standing up on the back of his neck as he listened to the parsletongue. Why did he find it so intoxicating?
“Winky I want you to deliver this letter to Snape. Make sure you aren’t followed,” Winky took the letter, bowed, and left, “Dinky, why don’t you take Lord Malfoy some tea and a few snacks before dinner and make them meaty. I’m sure with the stress he’s been under these last few years his diet has suffered."
Wait what?! Draco reversed his train of thought. Did he just admit that Harry bloody Potter was attractive? Only one day and the half-blood was already infecting him. Draco gagged slightly and shuddered. Harry Potter wasn't hot-er attractive. He was a gangly, short, scroungy haired, mangy mutt looking half-blood Draco assured himself. There was nothing attractive about him, not even the stunning emerald eyes that had always haunted him. Especially after he'd almost died.
Remus was about to explain when Narcissa cut in. “A Kitsune, or fox spirit is a very old creature that originally came from Japan. However, as the wizarding community expanded westward so did many of the magical creatures, including ones like the Kitsune. You see long ago many of the magical creatures we know of today either blessed families with magic, or were the start of a wizard’s bloodline. So, it made since that magical creatures like the Kitsune would spread as wizards did. Of course, there was also magical creatures that already inhabited areas that wizards spread to which inevitably added to those bloodlines. Every so often these inheritances, or characteristics, will resurface in a wizard’s bloodline. Which you well know Draco,” she finished.
The ebony creature stood at the same size as a horse. It’s glowing green eyes watched every one of Harry’s movements, with slits underneath them that surely held another pair. It had no mouth, or at least none that Harry could tell, and the giant antlers that hung heavy on its head where covered with long vibrant moss. Its fox like features made Harry step back, sucking in a breath as the nine tails fanned out behind it. Moss covered its back and top-line, attesting to the ancient age of this creature.
"Yes Draco? I'm right here, keep looking at me. Get your head on straight and start controlling your emotions. You'll be no use to him if you keep yourself in this state," Severus stated softly, trying to sooth the wild look in Draco's animalistic eyes.
Shaking his head Draco sat up, panting from the effort it had taken to run through the snow. Which to his surprise, had all disappeared. Instead surrounding him was a bed of green moss, and he lifted his gaze from the ground his jaw dropped. Stone walls stood before him in pristine condition.
“There’s no need for that,” he sighed, “people will know eventually. They always find out honestly,” he stated and watched a slight smirk form on her face. “I mean, if I can’t hide it from a werewolf I’m sure I won’t be able to hid it from a lot of other creatures,” he added. The woman shrugged and leaned back against the wall.
“What happened with the last people?” Harry asked, ignoring the man’s comment. The store employee shrugged his shoulders slightly before grinning.
LeFay smirked and stepped further into the room, pulling the door closed behind him. Draco looked uneasy as he stepped back again, bumping into a dresser.
“Yes.” Remus smiled, “For one, you didn’t think they’d let you bring in Ammit without some kind of agreement, did you? He’s far too large just to take him in as a normal pet for your classes. We have to get paper work for him.” Harry shifted in his seat. “Two, we need to get you set up with a private room, for your safety. Sirius, Narcissa, and I have talked it over and we think it would be best if you and Draco roomed together, separate from the normal houses. You would still go to all the classes you had with your respective houses, but it will be safer for you two to stay together,” Remus explained.
Well you better suck it up buttercup :P cause this one is also my favorite child and I also want to work on this one first. But you gotta be fair to your children people. That means equal treatment for both.
Severus watched, both in awe, and secrete terror as the man before him melted into an elegant fox-like creature. He'd forgotten just how much the monster had taken over the man.
“It was the only way we had to reverse the effects,” Severus started to explain. Slowly he enlightened Draco on all the details of the last few days. It was long and rather tedious but Draco didn’t interrupt during any of it, only seeming to become less and less aggravated as he spoke. At the end, Draco looked over at Harry, something stirring in his chest as he did. Harry had become an animagus in just two short days? Just for him?
Draco watched him, moving to the side when LeFay got to the last step. He felt a lithe hand reach out pulling him close and holding his jaw close to LeFay’s face.
"Did I mention that you're huge now?" LeFay asked as he grunted, swinging himself up near Draco's shoulder blades.
LeFay stiffened, looking up sharply as Skoll approached the other side of the bed, glancing down at his brother. “I didn’t realize there was anyone else here,” LeFay growled.
“Careful, we don’t want you breaking your neck now,” Sirius smirked playfully as he took up walking beside Harry to keep an eye on him. It took him a bit, but Harry finally got the hang of balancing on his toes. He went to sit down on one of the love seats only to have Remus yell at him about being careful with his hind end. It was late however and vase fell  none the less. Causing Harry to spin around quickly to figure out how it had fallen, causing yet another item to fall and break. Sirius busted out laughing as he sat down, his arms crossing over his torso and leaving Remus scowled at their son.
Both Tatsuya purred in satisfaction as Draco shuddered when they spoke, but it hadn't been quite what LeFay was hoping for.
“I’m coming,” Harry stated as he got up out of bed, running a hand though his hair to smooth it out. He hesitated in front of the mirror when he realized he only had his kilt on before rolling his eyes at himself. It was probably just Remus telling him that supper was ready. He yawned and squeezed his eyes shut as he opened the door, only to stand frozen, surprised by who stood on the other side. “Draco?”
Draco's ears twitched, a small smile on his hyena face. 'Night Potter,' he thought to himself before yawning. Maybe this wasn't going to be so bad, though being bonded to Harry as a familiar was definitely bothering him (a bit less than he thought it would though). He really hoped his Godfather knew what he was doing. Especially since now he was stuck with the wizard that had tried to kill him just a month ago.
Draco pulled the leaf from the roof of his mouth, gagging slightly. "This is disgusting," he muttered under his breath.
“It’s okay, just means we are going to be a bit longer than I’d hoped,” Sirius sighed, “Well come on let’s get going. Remus is going to have my head if I’m not there in time for our guests.”
Harry stiffened in the middle of putting his own class list away. “No,” his voice was hallow and Draco noticed that the intense gaze Harry had faded.
"I'm not giving up on him! Harry! Wake up damn it!" the voice was hysteric now, and Harry suddenly found himself running, splashing through puddles as he did. Draco, Draco...he remembered that name. A feeling started to well up in his chest. Guilt, grief of his own, loss. Regret.
LeFay’s nails dug into the arms of the seat, his whole body tense. He’d tried so hard to move on after Draco, fought hard to create a new life but he’d never been able to get those purple-grey eyes out of his mind, and now he was about to lose them again. Standing below him was Cadmael, a man he’d once loved, and honestly still did in a way. It made him hate himself even more to think about what he was suddenly putting Draco through, what he was putting them both through. The golden jaguar werebeast god of a man currently stalking back and forth beneath him and the sleek powerful dragon man that was to face him.
"Well, I'm going to head back. The healers should be just about done now," Draco said as he got up from his seat. Tossing his glass into the sink as he passed by it. Voldemort watched him go, resting his chin in his hand. He was glad. Even with everything that happened, he was glad. This little blonde nit wit was a godsend. Without the little snake he honestly doubted Harrison would have made it this far. Even if they were enemies at least having Draco around had kept Dumbledore busy. To focused on keeping the boys from ripping out each other's throats to do more harm to Harry than he'd already done. Though, as he thought about it the one he really should be thanking is Severus. The man had done so much for his nephew without him ever knowing, and if he kept going down the list the real one he'd have to thank was Lily. If she hadn't captured Severus's heart none of this would have been possible. He sighed, if only he hadn't been so blind to what was happening around him, he could have stopped all this from happening.
"Technically the Maltese is a spirit animal. Kind of like the Kitsune is a spirit fox. Why do you think there isn't any real pictures of them? The ones on the muggles internet are just artists’ renderings of past descriptions," Theo said with a small smirk. Harry grinned a bit as well. It made sense now.
A low moan erupted from Draco as LeFay bit down onto his neck, his teeth easily piercing skin as he marked his mate. The blood that flooded his system reminded him of dark chocolate, licking his lips as he continued kissing the fair skin of his mate. He pulled away the robe that kept Draco barely covered, tossing it to the side as he pushed Draco down to the floor of this darkness. Draco growled, snapping his head up as he flipped the two of them, teeth sinking down into LeFay's neck. Another roar resounded and echoed throughout the darkness as Harry's blood met Draco's tongue, his wings suddenly bursting from his back, stretching far over both of them as both moaned in ecstasy.  LeFay's eyes rushed open, lips parting, as he felt the next rush of magic snapping into place and his hands moved to the horns now sprouting from Draco's head. He could feel every heartbeat between them, every breath, every touch.
Ammit was cuddled up in the blankets Harry’d added a heat charm too, purring as Harry ran his slender fingers down the large snake’s head and neck.
"Harry! Are you okay?" Hermione asked as she tried to suppress her giggling. Luna was outright laughing and both Neville and Theo looked down at him confused.
Severus' lips twitched. He hated when Albus presumed to know him. Though, he was glad that his acting was paying off and the old goat hadn't caught on to how he really felt about the boy. Though, admittedly it was probably not that different than what Albus thought. "You asked me to get the best for Potter, and I did. Now is there anything else Albus? I would like to get back to room and prepare for tomorrow," Snape ground out between his teeth.
Ashliegh simply shrugged slowly before going to her seat, sliding into it gracefully. The faerie smoothed back her hair as both William and August glared.
Severus rolled his eyes, "It doesn't matter. He's doing well, and you need to rest still. Ghost made it through all of this because you two share cores now. If you don't get enough rest he won't get better as fast," he smoothed out his robes and straightened himself. "Now, I have other matter's to attend to and a lot to talk about. There's food and water to your left," he said, and then patted the bed. "Make sure you stay in bed." With a quick turn Snape made his way out of the room, closing the door behind him with a soft click. Sighing he turned to look at the distraught blonde sitting on the ground.
Draco was confused for a moment, wondering what exactly he meant until it clicked. "No," he answered honestly. "But I have to start somewhere," Draco stated.
“What are you yelling for?” Harry grumbled as he finished cleaning out one of his ears and then crossed his arms over his chest.
Draco stopped at the opening of the showers and sat down. Tripping jinxs? Why would Harry need to do that? Draco had been focusing so much on thinking that he didn't notice Harry had started stripping in front of him. Then the answer to his question was clear. All over Harry's back where scars, some more recent looking than others and it made Draco's stomach churn. Now he also knew why the Golden Boy never took his shirt off during the really hot spans at Hogwarts, and why he didn't sleep without a shirt like many of the other wizards in the dorm did. It made more questions come to his mind about where he had gotten them.
“Just a few scrapes and bruises,” Neville smiled reassuringly. “What was the very last thing you remember doing?” he asked.
"Nothing here has given me any reason to doubt any of you. However, I suggest all of you create copy's of your memories, along with strengthening you shields," LeFay stated, "Especially those without creature blood. If Albus is trying to wipe out everything, there is no doubt in my mind that he will use everything within his power to achieve it. Even if that means leaving him with a brain dead wizard to bury."
He let out a slow breath as he felt Draco move down his body, his eyes rolling. This, this is what it felt like to be truly hole. This is what he'd been missing.
Harry looked around, his eyes resting on a knife. "What about the familiar bond?" Harry said just barely above a whisper.
To the people gathered there they would see his eyes starting to glow a brighter green and his hair prickle. “It was Seamus, Dean, and another student I didn’t recognize in the hall. They had Parvati Pali pinned between them and a wall. They kept shoving her and calling her a freak, telling her to tell them what she was. Seamus punched her in the diaphragm when she refused, and that’s when I pulled my wand on them. I should have gotten help instead, but I think if I had they might have really hurt her. Anyways, I knocked Dean away with my wand when he grabbed Parvati and was countering a spell Seamus was throwing at me when I was knocked back by the third student’s spell. I didn’t even know he’d cast anything till it hit me. Parvati tried to warn me but,” Harry stopped, driving his nails into the palms of his hands as he sucked in a breath and tried to stop the tremors that had started. His magic was starting to lash around angrily, causing the two Weasly’s to look around a bit nervously.
“Hello, my name is Ladon, Ladon Wing. I seemed to have gotten separated from tourist hiking group and then the storm came down-,” Draco paused licking his lips, “I’m freezing.”
“What’s wrong with you freak!” Seamus snapped at her and punched her in the stomach. She doubled over and coughed, trying to suck back in the air she had lost.
“Malfoy,” the black-haired man spoke. The power behind the voice alone caused Draco’s knees to feel weak.
Breakfast ended up being great, and Draco surprised himself when he found out how much he enjoyed raw meat. The bloodier the better it seemed. Harry however looked a little green watching the hyena eat. Oh well, food was food, and Draco was to hungry to care what he looked like while he was eating, or the growling and odd chattering-laughing noises he made while he was doing so.
“Did you say something." Draco asked, frowning. Harry had a firey look in his eyes that Draco didn't like. "Harry, are you okay?”
“Severus, calming draught now!” Charlie snapped. Severus rushed over and handed it to him which Charlie instantly loaded the syringe with. Harry stood frozen to the spot, long Kitsune ears flattening to the back of his head. Charlie finally got the thick needle in between Draco’s scales and injected it. Sighing Charlie sat down as the dragon settled down, giant eyes closing.
As they left the reading room all three of them were escorted into a larger room by another goblin and then left there. For the time being it was quiet as the three looked around, admiring the stone work and runes carved into the floor and walls. As Harry was eyeing a part of it suspiciously it opened and three goblins stepped in with arms full of papers. As they started setting up Harry recognized the golbin from early coming up to them.
Sorry for the short chapters before this. I was trying to make a worthy lead up to this chapter. I've been working on it for weeks now trying to get it right. I apologize now if any one finds it hard to follow.
Minerva set her hand on top of Harry’s and squeezed it gently. “It’s okay, they aren’t here right now. And I’ll have them expelled after we finish this conversation, but I need you to tell us what happened next,” she said softly, glancing at Snape. He handed her a calming draught from his cloak which she gave to Harry. He drank it in slow sips before letting out a long sigh and closed his eyes for a moment.
Charlie was pleased when he noticed the open wounds didn’t look infected. He was however worried about the spears in the dragon, along with the arrows. Centaurs sometimes liked using poison on trespassers.
“You’re going to be very surprised when you see him. Which is something else I need to talk to you about, but we’ll wait till Sirius comes back,” Remus stated and smirked. Narcissa would have a heart attack when she found out about Harry.
“Weaslys. I think we have something else to worry about…,” Severus whispered, standing a ways in front of them. Both men looked up at Severus, face paler than normal, who motioned behind them. Bill turned his head, as did Charlie, both men stiffening when they saw what was there. The Kitsune version of Harry stood a few yards behind them, head low and teeth bared. Slowly it started stalking towards them in a low crouch. A low humming growl emanated from the Kitsune.
