“Do you need help with anything?” Harry asked.
He knew what Malfoy was like – he was condescending, self-absorbed, arrogant and cruel. Self-pitying too – Malfoy was excellent at feeling sorry for himself, it was just ridiculous that Harry had started feeling sorry for him too. Because he had. And he had allowed some part of himself to want to see him, had allowed himself to like him. He would have liked to pretend that he hadn’t, that he hadn’t been worried when he was absent and relieved when he came back, but here he was, feeling disappointed and betrayed. And he felt like an idiot for ever believing in any of it.
“I’ll take it back when you take back all the times you’ve called us mudbloods.”
Mrs Weasley leads Draco to the attic, the only available space in the Burrow at this point. Harry has helped clear some stuff out of the way, helped her make up an old bed, set up a lamp and a dresser, so it’s sort of like a room. He doesn’t go up there with them when Draco arrives. As soon as they have passed the first landing he has no chance of hearing what they might say, but he has already made up his mind that he will not hesitate to kill Malfoy if he shows even the slightest sign of ingratitude.
“Why not? Why else would he tell you something like that?”
“But not to you, right? I know I’ve done some fucked up things, and I never expected you to forgive me, but then there you were, telling me you didn’t blame me for Dumbledore’s death, and yesterday you were practically making out with my Dark Mark, and for a second I thought… For a second I forgot that you sent my father to Azkaban and that you tried to murder me, and I thought that maybe you cared. But then you fucking left anyway.” Draco looks away. His hands are curled tightly into fists and Harry watches his chest rise and fall rapidly, watches him swallow hard.
They nodded.
Potter reached out and squeezed his shoulder.
Malfoy was drinking his whisky with much more practice and grace than Harry. He seemed perfectly relaxed, almost like he was enjoying himself, and Harry was wondering when they would get to the point. His expression was impossible to read.
Ron nodded to himself.
He walked past Neville and reached for the door.
He should have waited, Harry thought. This was not the right time. But if he had waited, he probably would have lost his nerve.
“Have you ever heard anything about wizards not minding… that they don’t mind
“Draco!” – Someone gripped his shoulder and almost pushed him over.
“Right, well that’s ok as long as you’re outside the walls and on the topmost storey where we are now. But as soon as we enter the prison – close that door behind you – as soon as we enter the actual prison you have to stay close to me. Even if you don’t see any dementors, you need patronus protection down there. Don’t look into any of the cells either, that’s my advice. We keep the Death Eaters all the way at the bottom, so it’s quite a walk. Down the stairs here.”
“Wow, I don’t know, maybe because his father is in Azkaban and he wants to help him break out? Maybe he’s trying to get revenge by tricking you into a life-threatening situation and then stabbing you in the back once you trust him? I can think of a hundred reasons why Malfoy would lie to us.”
“Narcissa,” said Lucius hoarsely.
She turned to Draco:
Draco blinked. He saw the dark figure of Blaise standing by his bed looking down at him. He had pulled back the draperies around the bed. Draco could make out Nott behind him. They both looked worried. The mad bird in Draco’s chest was flinging itself against his ribs. His body still didn’t feel entirely under his control when he tried to sit up again, this time with more success. He had no idea what his face looked like, but hoped that the darkness hid at least some of the terror he was feeling.
“Oh, I’m not saying you’re not trying.”
Ginny scoffed.
“Yes, I’m bloody sure, Potter. Merlin, you’ve gotten paranoid.”
“I was there. I should have at least tried to do something. To stop her.”
“Okay, I’ll tell you when we’re meeting again, yeah?” he said stepping towards the door.
“Here.”
He told them about the girl who had talked to him. The werewolf.
No, the guy had asked him who he was staring at.
They did. Daphne went this time, and Draco poured himself a generous glass and things got easier after the first one and even better after the second. The anger still swirled in his gut, but it became harder to keep a hold on it as his thoughts became slow and slippery. He managed to forget the pricking of eyes on the back of his neck and the noise from the Gryffindors became indistinguishable from the general clamour of the pub around them. He tuned into Pansy's gossiping and Daphne's pearly laughter instead and at some point, he started sharing a couple of anecdotes from his new insight into the muggle world, and he remembered how much he liked having his friends' attention, so he kept going and it was funny and he was in control, and Blaise looked like he was in risk of choking when Draco tried to explain rugby, and for the first time since they left the safety of Pansy's house, it was actually kind of nice.
“It does not.”
Potter looked at him.
“Where did that initiative suddenly come from?” he hissed.
He sighed.
"Malfoy…" he began.
Harry shrugged.
“You think it would work at all?”
“Hey, what did Malfoy want?” she asked.
She gave him a long, reproachful look.
He felt a violent flash of anger towards the calm, dignified woman across from him, who was so old and claimed to be so good, but who didn’t care about this evil just as nobody else cared. Just as he knew they wouldn’t.
“Because all the rest of us already know it. We learned it when we started Dumbledore’s Army back in fifth.”
“I was awake.”
Harry started and looked back over his shoulder. A second later, Draco felt it too. A ripple. A chill. They were huddled with their backs to the wall where the wizard had sat and they could still feel the stones emanating heat like a fireplace, but on their faces, despite the protecting light of Harry’s patronus, they felt a biting chill and all around them they could hear the rattle of dementor breaths. The fog had thinned.
When it was time to go back down, Draco got up and stretched out a hand to Harry and pulled him to his feet. And then he kept hold of Harry’s hand and held it all the way to the stairs in a cool, determined grip.
There were no voices from downstairs anymore either. They heard the distant crack of faraway fireworks.
“Do you know why it’s a stag?” he asked suddenly, without looking up.
Harry handed it over.
“She won’t. She doesn’t want me to move out. She’ll never let you out of the house either, Ginny.”
"Should we pull up another table or something?"
“I guess you will.”
He sounded proud of this. Harry had a hard time seeing the advantage to having allies if they were willing to abandon you without hesitation over something like a fight.
“It used to be a werewolf,” he said.
“I don’t care how it makes you feel.”
"Do you know any other places around here?" Harry asked.
“As a joke.”
Malfoy pulled out his wand.
The tips of his shoes were still hitting the topmost leaves. Malfoy looked down at him.
“We have to do something, right? She’s going to tell someone, and then they’ll tell someone else. Everyone’s going to find out.”
The other two began moving, but Draco was still staring at his watch. It was an expensive one. Goblin made, silver with the Malfoy crest engraved in it. It had been running perfectly for four generations.
“Why not up here?” he asked.
“Sorry,” mumbled Harry as Dracos’ hands disappeared into his pockets.
“Well,” he said. “That explains a lot.”
“Do you know if it’s safe, Harry?”
They walked as a group towards the gates. Draco longed for his bed and the blessed promise of exhausted sleep. Now that the excitement of it all was over, he could feel how tired, beaten and cold he was.
“Just because I wear well doesn’t mean I’m not suffering. I think I had a whole bottle of firewhisky entirely to myself.”
“There,” she said.
then? Because that’s something we do?”
he cried.
Harry looked up at Malfoy and felt anger seeping back into his blood. Malfoy was looking earnest and composed and somehow that made him even angrier.
, honestly, I don’t know why Hooch even bothers...”
“Pretty sure, yes.”
“Oh, cool,” said Daphne.
"Did you?"
“Before I was made a Death Eater.”
"Honestly, when it comes to Potter's reasons for not thinking well of you, I think your poor taste in pubs ranks quite low."
The corners of Potter’s mouth twitched as if his face couldn’t decide which folds to fall into.
“Theodore Nott?” continued McGanagall.
He keeps a hand on the door though.
But Draco’s expression was vacant, he lowered his wand as if he had suddenly forgotten the use of it, and gazed up at the dementors, his breath forming white clouds in the freezing air. In the back of his mind, Harry could hear his mother screaming.
“Well, runes can be used for channelling spells,” said Granger, standing up. “It’s much easier than altering the spell itself, and runes of protection would probably be compatible with the patronus charm, so
“Draco!”
“Maybe you missed out. It does sound very much like something they would do, don’t you agree? To demonstrate their bravery.”
He glances back at Draco but looks away again quickly.
“Sure, piss off, Malfoy.”
Draco turned on his heel and headed for the stairs.
“You made it,” she said.
“The rest of what?” Harry asked.
“Probably… most of the classes are in English, but I might have to anyway. Some of them are at a muggle school, they have this whole system of enrolling wizards for certain parts of the muggle curriculum without the muggles noticing.”
”They don’t grow on my face,” he said, shuffling around on the sofa.
“Right.”
"It's not as if they'll be here any second," he said.
“So what did you want to say?”
“That’s not how it works. I know it’s fine, but you’re still not looking at me.”
"Impressive you've been able to keep it a secret."
Potter let out a breathy huff of a laugh and Draco's heart caught in his chest. Merlin, he was pathetic.
“Oh, hello. I didn’t hear you.”
year, Draco would know where to go from here. They had an easy script back then, one that allowed for a simple way around all the things they don’t need to talk about.
And then Luna had suggested that Malfoy liked him. He knew he should feel repulsed by the idea, just like he should have felt repulsed by the kiss. Seamus and Dean could do whatever they wanted, but Harry wasn’t like that.
He had thought a lot of uncharitable things about Malfoy over the years, but never that he was odd. Cruel, yes; petty, cowardly and pathetic, absolutely, but never odd. It was a word he would have used about someone like Luna Lovegood, who was kind and lovely but did always seem as if she had just come from another world.
“No,” he says. “I didn’t.”
Potter turned onto his back. He had an arm draped over his face to shield his eyes from the harsh reality of morning. Or something like that.
“I said some stupid things. And he was an idiot.”
“Sorry. Hermione wants me to talk; you know how she gets that look in her eyes? And she wants a therapist available at Hogwarts.”
Draco raises an eyebrow.
. Honestly, I don't know how you missed it, I thought Daphne made it her personal mission to tell everyone at Hogwarts the second she found out."
"Okay, I had extremely good reasons for-"
“He had an invisibility cloak? All this time? And then that map…” He looked at Pansy. “You see how everything is starting to make sense?”
She sounded so calm. Draco stared at her and tried to look past that, tried to see the girl he had talked to in the secret room just a few days earlier, who had been fracturing under the pressure of the secret and the quest. He couldn’t imagine why she would tell them in this way, or why she hadn’t asked him or Lovegood to do it instead. He caught Lovegood’s eye, but he couldn’t read her expression. All the others looked perplexed.
“I was thinking it might be a good idea if we left them back in the secret room,” she said. “Then we’ll both have access to all of them all the time and if we find something new we can just leave it for each other up there. We’ll avoid having to talk to each other where people might notice, and we also won’t have large stacks of suspicious books on dark magic lying around our dormitories.”
He closed his eyes for a moment when he had finished reading. He was so tired, but his body felt restless. His mind was overused but it wouldn’t stop whirring. He recognized the feeling from past nights of insomnia and knew he wouldn’t be getting any sleep.
Draco raised his wand. He knew that if he wanted to, he could cast his patronus as soon as Potter turned the handle, before the power of the fake dementor could even reach him. He knew Potter would pretend not to have noticed it if he did. But he would notice, and then they would both know, and there wouldn’t be a third chance after that. He had to remind himself of Azkaban. Azkaban was what was important.
Finally, he ended up with Hermione in the comfortable chairs in Gryffindor. She was reading, he sat across from her and tried not to think about the night before, which meant it was all he could think about. She seemed completely undisturbed by his brooding. He watched her turning the pages and probably read an entire chapter in the time it took him to gather enough courage to ask her the question. He knew he had to, to get rid of that tiny “if” that was nagging him and getting in the way of his righteous anger.
He shook his head.
"She's upstairs, wanted to go over some papers or something."
“I can’t believe you’re making me use this thing. Why don’t you just get a floo-connection?”
The patronuses were still solid and shone brightly. They were a barrier between them and the dementors, but the patronus charm was not a perfect shield. Draco could feel the cold tendrils of the darkness boring into his mind, his sanity creaking like a frozen lake in winter.
His phone was in the small kitchen area of the flat. He hadn't switched on the light, he stood in the dull, streetlit half-darkness feeling like an idiot for talking aloud in an empty room. He still wasn't used to muggle technology.
Harry hesitated only for a moment before following.
“That’s none of your business!” he snapped.
, and I get that, I really do, but that just makes it fucking unbearable that you won’t leave me alone, when clearly all you want is to get married and make little Weasley-babies with your pretty girlfriend!”
“Language, Ron,” says Mrs Weasley.
Half an hour later he watched his owl soar soundlessly out of one of the owlery windows. The sky was black and starless, and he quickly lost sight of her in the dark.
Blaise slid gracefully into one of the empty chairs.
the bottom, because the dark down there was moving too. Waving. Breathing. A cold chill ran down his spine. There were thousands.
Draco scoffed.
“And the punishments were bad. Unpredictable. If you did something wrong, they might punish your friends or your siblings instead of you. We would have been punished just as hard as anyone else for getting out of line, but we couldn’t expect help from the ones already fighting. I mean, imagine if Pansy had stood up to the Carrows, do you think they would have let her into the room of requirement to hide her? Or hide me or Millicent or Evelyn or someone else that Pansy cared about who might have been hurt? So I think that’s why she doesn’t think she has to feel bad about it.”
“No,” said Ginny firmly.
“Perfect,” he said.
Potter snorted.
Harry heaved in a long, thin breath and nodded. He wiped his mouth and looked from Irie to Maya to Malfoy.
“Sorry,” he said.
“Sure, but it’s
“Of course not,” he says instead.
The cold gnawed at Draco’s flesh, there were drops of water in the air that stung his face like needles. He didn’t remember how long the boat ride had been from the mainland to the prison. It had seemed endless, but he was starting to fear that they might have gone too far, that they might have missed it. How close did they have to be before it became visible? He wasn’t sure about that either. He glanced back at the dark shapes of the others flying behind him. They might have to turn around and start over from the house on the coast. Fly out again and hope they had better luck. If he had been alone, he would have turned back already, now he didn’t dare tell them. It was too early for failure. He tightened his grip on his broom. They were wasting time. They could spend the whole night flying back and forth and still not find it. And even if they did find it, how likely was it even that their plan would work out? There were so many ifs and maybes.
“Sorry, you said you were tired. I’m going to go to bed.”
“You know, Seamus has something that helps with sleeping.”
“Lumos,” whispered Draco.
Harry glanced out the window. It was pretty dark, actually. He hadn't noticed.
“Why are you going to Azkaban? What’s your reason?”
She shut her mouth abruptly when the door to their compartment was pushed open. A tall, red haired boy stuck his head inside.
He’s still on his bed, his clothes tangled, his hair probably a total mess, watching Potter pull away from him exactly like he used to, and Draco feels just as small and humiliated and ridiculous as he did when he was fifteen.
“Really?”
“I’m coming. I have as much first-hand experience with dark magic as the two of you. You might need me.”
"Watch yourself, Harry," said Maya with a smirk. "You don't sound as posh as Draco, but your shock is starting to get a little offensive, don't you think?"
"Can you take this seriously for one second?"
“I never said that was what I was doing.”
“Don’t look so angry, Malfoy. Just because we curse you, it doesn’t mean we’re not on the same side, remember?” said Neville Longbottom.
“No, I’ve never been there. I’ve just heard a lot. Pass me the bottle.”
“Why?” he asked.
Malfoy scoffed.
came slower, almost too late.
"But she's gay, then?" said Malfoy airily.
“Yeah, it’s Harry’s,” she said.
“Do you think boggarts might be relevant?” he asked.
He nodded.
It felt terribly wrong to go towards the source of the deadness and the cold instead of running away from it, to safety, but he made himself move forward, the others pushed through after him and Longbottom pulled the door shut behind them. They crowded onto the topmost gallery of the prison, all of them with their wands out, all of them facing the door, Draco's heart pounding hard in his chest. A second passed and then another, and no aurors burst through the door.
Harry stared at Hermione, who had just almost died, and was now looking away like she had no plans to answer Ron’s question. Harry looked at Ron.
"What's wrong?" he asked, managing to sound fairly nonchalant. "Are you overcome with homophobic revulsion? Some manly Gryffindor urge to save me from my immoral ways?"
“No thank you.”
if you’re-”
She raised an eyebrow.
"Because everyone was too drunk to apparate and they live right around the corner."
Of course it depended on how you looked at it. Of course it wasn't actually very long ago. Harry still had nightmares about Voldemort, he still slept with his wand next to his pillow, he still sometimes thought of things he wanted to talk to Lupin about before he remembered he was dead. This wasn't about that. This was him telling Malfoy as politely as possible that he would rather not look at it at all.
His partner turned, catching sight of Harry and her eyes widened in disbelief.
“The smalltalk, just cut it out and get to the point.”
“We really need to talk about that.”
Harry hates himself even more afterwards. Maybe that’s why he does it.
“Which sections?” he asked, tilting his head to read the titles on the spines on the books in her stack.
He disappeared through the door without even looking up.
Weasley shook her head.
"I'm going to pretend it never happened, Potter. I suggest you do the same. In a week you’ll be over whatever meltdown it is you're having right now and you'll probably tell all your friends anyway, and you can all have a good laugh about it."
Draco raised an eyebrow. He felt cold all the way through.
“You were a Death Eater too.”
They had known each other too long for Ron to be fazed by Harry's anger. Harry took a step back down the stairs. He leaned against the wall.
There was a scramble as Blaise got up from the table. Alain turned to look at him.
“What are you on about?”
"You're leaving?" she asked.
“Well, my new place isn’t connected to the floo. And I assumed you wouldn’t open a letter from me so…”
Slytherin had Transfiguration with the Gryffindors this year, which was still taught by Professor McGonagall. Apparently they hadn’t been able to find another teacher, or maybe she was just sad to let it go. It had happened before that the headmaster had been teaching a class as well, though Dumbledore had been too involved with his politics on the side to have time for it.
Harry shook his head again.
“Neville’s parents,” said Harry quietly.
He probably could as soon as his heart settled down. Potter’s hand was curled against his chest. He wondered if he could feel it pounding.
Malfoy’s smile was bitter and reluctant. He emptied his glass of whisky.
“Right,” he said raising his wand.
There was a beat of silence.
“So, what did you want to say to me?” asked Potter
He doesn’t see Draco the whole day. He stays in the attic and doesn’t even show up for meals. Harry doesn’t know what to make of that.
"Good for her," she said.
Harry wiped his face with his sleeve to dry the water off.
At four they were in a circle on the floor, too tired to move. Their voices were low, the conversation slow and drowsy. Luna had her head in Ginny’s lap and Ginny was braiding her hair. Ron had his arms around Hermione; Seamus slumped against Dean, his head resting on his shoulder. Neville had his back against Ginny’s bed and was fighting hard to keep his eyes open. It was still completely dark outside. They could see the light from the room reflected in the black glass. When they spoke it was with frayed, hazy voices.
“I think they’re trying to distance themselves from their parents. I mean, I think the Slytherins are by far the most serious students in my mugglestudies class,” said Hermione.
"Of course I've got a wand, I was pardoned, remember? Got a new one after the trials. Not from Ollivander, of course but… well. It’s perfectly adequate."
He followed Blaise and Nott to the common room. Pansy was waiting for them there and they all walked together to the Great Hall. The other three made small talk about nothing in particular and Draco drifted along behind them. They came up from the dungeon and passed a window overlooking the grounds. Rain was drizzling from a grey and overcast sky. Draco stopped. The rain shouldn’t have surprised him. It was February after all, and since all the windows in the dungeon were under the lake, it wasn’t like he had had reason to expect anything else. And still, he had thought there would be sunshine. There was a lightness humming through him, like the one that comes with warmth and bright weather. He turned away from the window, hurried to catch up with the others and settled back in step behind them. He watched their backs and tried to determine if perhaps they were walking a little straighter. He felt as if a burden they hadn’t known they had been carrying might have been lifted. He wanted to ask Pansy about it, if perhaps she had noticed it too.
"Did they have silly names?"
She stirred, then straightened up and yawned as she shot him an annoyed look.
“This isn’t a very good place to meet if you wanted to be discreet,” said Harry quietly.
“I can’t believe they did that.”
She hesitated.
“Tonight,” he said.
“And he’s… you’re…
“What?”
“I need to get into my common room.”
“I can’t help you with that,” she said.
“We were pretending to be friends,” he said. “We were pretending to be friends to improve my social status and to satisfy your saviour-complex. But we’re not pretending anymore.”
"Where are you going?" he asked, wheezing and gasping for breath.
“Draco? You need to eat some chocolate.”
Malfoy gestures to the open door.
“Potter!” he called out as soon as he recognized him.
“You’re drunk?”
“It’s not about that, it’s – I’ve been thinking about it all the time since I came back. It’s not evil in a conscious way, but it’s still evil and I think it makes our whole world darker. It makes people darker, not just the ones who go there or go near it, but everyone. I think it
Hermione looked up from the chessboard.
”You’re incredible, Harry. How can you not have noticed? I mean, they’re not clingy, but you
Potter gestured to the bar.
"You've seen it?" she asked.
“Good,” he said. “That’s fine.”
them,” she added.
“Hello?” he said, picking up the receiver.
Harry winced. He looked up from his breakfast and met Ron's grim expression.
She frowned, but then nodded.
“I’m just trying to figure him out.”
“I know everyone feels unsafe with Slytherins out after dark,” he drawled, “but I just had detention with the headmistress and I am headed back to the dungeon right now, so you don’t have to worry. I do appreciate that you’re taking time to patrol the hallways, though. We all feel much safer knowing you’re watching over us at night.”
“Why?”
But he didn’t really believe that. He had noticed Potter watching him quite a few times, and when Draco looked back at him and caught his eye, he would smile before he turned away. Draco wondered if anyone else noticed. Part of him wished they did, despite Potter wanting it to be secret and Draco knowing that he was right that it was better that way. He knew it was vanity, but he wanted people to see the way Potter looked at him – see that Draco Malfoy was wantable, worthy of a crush. And not just by anyone, by Harry Potter, who could have had whoever he wanted, but had chosen Draco for his hungry eyes.*
“Nothing,” he said. “He just passed me in the hall.”
! I can think of a million other things it would make more sense for you to be scared of!”
Pansy stood up too.
“You’re not being expelled.”
Harry flinched.
“I don’t know, it was just a thought. Might be fun.”
“Thanks, Hermione,” Harry muttered.
, Potter!”
“What about you?” he asked, not because he actually wanted to know but because staring at Malfoy in awkward silence was actually worse than listening to him talk.
“The hat offered me Slytherin.”
“Draco, look at me, did they get you?” Harry tried again, but Draco didn’t answer him and so there was nothing for Harry to do but walk with him, his familiar patronus to his right on the other side of Hermione, Draco and the strange patronus to his left.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Fine. Where is it?”
“Do you want to go flying again sometime?” he asked.
“Yes,” he said coldly. “He testified at my trial, you know. In my defence.”
"No," Malfoy snapped. He picked the teabags out of the sink. "Oh, Draco," he said in a loud, simpering voice, as he dropped them in a pile on the counter, next to the half empty box. "I can't help but wonder, why are you living in this extraordinarily shitty flat in a neighbourhood with a name as unbelievable daft as
Malfoy started and turned around.
Ron stared at him disbelievingly and Harry looked away. He hadn’t wanted to tell Ron, but it had started to feel like a secret more than something he just hadn’t bothered to mention. And that just made it all worse, the kisses and the talks, made it feel much more illicit than it actually was. Luna had to be wrong, Harry had just misread the situation, and the only reason he felt bad about it was because he was keeping it from his friends. And the only reason he kept it from them was because he worried they would get angry, but it wasn’t like he had done anything wrong.
Granger kept track of the floors as well as the time.
“Mrs Malfoy, if the boy’s awake, I think it’s time for you to leave.”
“We also have a responsibility not to fuck it up by being underprepared,” she snapped.
"I don't," he said. "It's Blaise's birthday, I couldn't very well turn down the invitation, but believe me when I say I would prefer to be somewhere else."
?" he read.
"He's a Death Eater!"
"They're humming."
Potter was already striding across the room, heading for a great, wooden wardrobe in the back.
“We’ll wait for them here.”
“Didn’t you? Because from where I’m standing it looks like you came up here again, in the middle of the night, and I don’t know if you’ve managed to get yourself obliviated since last night, but I haven’t. And I couldn’t care less about your
from despair. Or misery, or tragedy, they all use different terms… So I suppose even if we did manage to destroy all of them, with all the prisoners there, there would just be new ones created in probably a matter of hours. And for all we know, the
“We should leave soon.”
And then Granger’s otter twisted slightly and Draco flinched and Granger gasped as they all saw it at the same time when the light flickered over the face of the dead wizard and caught in his eyes – because they were eyes, not empty sockets as they had seemed at first, only they were mirror-black and had looked like empty holes until the moment they reflected the light. Now they did see the eyes, the face of the corpse looked a lot less skeletal. He looked a lot less dead.
“That he should try casting it with an actual dementor there. That’s what I did when Lupin taught me. Except it wasn’t really a dementor, it was just a boggart, since my boggart is a dementor. And I’d found a boggart in this old classroom, so that’s how I got the idea, and – actually, none of that’s really important. Anyway, so we were in that old classroom down in the dungeons, right before I came up here, and it… It didn’t go well. I mean, it worked at first, but then everything went wrong, which seems to be how everything in my life generally goes. I hadn’t warned him what we would be doing, and apparently the dementors hit him really hard, so even though it wasn’t a real one, it was still pretty bad. And I panicked a bit, so instead of casting
"Do you know what they are?"
“Sure.”
“Bit to the left.”
“It’s weird that we won’t be at Hogwarts next year,” said Seamus.
"Looking for an apparition point. There's one a couple of streets over."
“He said
He put down the note and took a closer look at the book. It was a thin, cheaply bound volume. There was no title or author printed on the cover, which was probably why it had been misplaced. He turned to the title page. He didn’t recognize the name of the author, but the title, printed in spindly letters above it, was enough to send a rush of excitement through him:
"Exactly. But in all seriousness, are you alright?"
Aberforth gave Harry a quick glance before walking over to check if the crumpled man was still conscious.
He nodded.
"Part of my sentence. It'll be lifted again in a year if I don't fuck it up, but until then I have to play by the rules."
“That’s good,” she said looking down at her notes. “I didn’t get all of it, so do you think you could write it down later? As well as anything else you remember. Maybe draw some of it for us too, that might be useful.”
It felt like it had been days since they left Hogwarts.
“Just tell me what you’re doing.”
while she ate.
Draco nodded.
She went through his stack of books and picked out a few of them for herself. They began going through the indexes. Once or twice he would ask her about a section or a chapter. She looked at him strangely when he did – not like it bothered her, but as if she was slightly surprised by the question, or maybe just by his presence, as if she had forgotten he was there.
Malfoy glared at him.
“Who do you think he is?” asked Harry, not looking away from the shrivelled wizard.
“Shit,” he muttered.
“We’ll make it work out,” he said.
She sighed.
“Did it never even cross your mind to wonder why
Malfoy's boots had hard heels. Each step he took was underscored by a sharp clack, making his walk sound determined and purposeful, like someone important striding towards his destination. Harry's worn sneakers were nearly soundless on the pavement.
The youngest of the aurors threw down his cards and stood up.
Hermione shifted her bag onto the other shoulder in a half-shrug. She didn’t say anything until the others had gotten a few feet ahead, and when she did she spoke quietly.
Malfoy huffs impatiently.
“You should have said so! We walked right past the bookstore earlier,” said Padma.
“No,” he said bitterly. “The important part definitely isn’t how I feel about it.”
“Potter – hey, wait!”
“Why are you like this?” she was still almost whispering. “Is this because you aren’t sleeping? You look tired all the time.”
She looked up.
“Look, I’m not saying any of this to offend you, it’s just that the houses of Malfoy and Black have donated about half the books in there, so she has a lot of respect for my family and usually just lets me go in there and take what I want.”
He poured the tea, which was still too thin, and handed Harry his cup.
Draco had invited Pansy along on an impulse. He had run into her right after speaking to Potter, and the idea of having her with him had popped into his mind as an excellent way to make the whole thing more bearable. He thought it would be easier to deal with a heroic quest of these proportions if they had her cynical scepticism to ground them.
She put the sprout in her mouth and chewed it carefully.
“There’s a sink over by the wall, dear.”
"No. I took a hangover potion."
Nott smiled slyly.
Draco is the first one to pull away.
Draco almost laughed. It was so typical of Potter to feel entitled to stick his nose in other people’s private business. Not that it would stay Draco’s private business for long - he knew what Blaise and Tracey were like; the whole school would probably know about it before lunch the next day.
Ron shrugged.
“Bastard,” panted Harry, “you absolute prick!”
He wouldn't have believed it was possible to add another chair to the table without using some kind of space-warping magic, but by the time he came back, there was a narrow opening between Malfoy and the stringy, white boy to his left. Harry sat down between them, trying and failing to keep a reasonable distance between them. His shoulder would brush against Malfoy's, but when he tried to lean away he found himself leaning into the boy on his other side.
Harry forced a laugh. It was odd how two years ago he would still have interpreted the sarcasm as spiteful and the words as an insult. He reached his hand out again, just the back of his fingers brushing Malfoy’s knuckles, and this time he didn’t pull his hand away.
The darkness returned. He lay back down and closed his eyes. Restlessness clawed at his chest. He concentrated on his breathing, almost drifted off to sleep, but then jerked awake when he felt the dream starting over. He wouldn’t get any more sleep that night. Slowly he drew back the hangings around his bed, letting in the sound of rain pattering against the windows. He pulled the Marauder’s Map out of his trunk and crept back into bed.
“Doesn’t the fact that he wants to go back to Azkaban prove that he’s not as much of a coward as he used to be? The place scares him shitless, but he still wants to come, even though he could just have pulled a Pansy by now and pulled out.”
Harry turned around to look at the Slytherins. Once or twice, he had spotted a person in green sitting down at with the Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs, but there wasn’t a single person from another house sitting at the Slytherin table.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry thought he saw Malfoy flinch.
He didn’t sound certain that it was the right name.
A second passed and then another, and then there was a static crackling from the little plastic speaker.
Malfoy hesitated.
Harry grinned as he reached out and touched Malfoy’s hair.
"Uh.…yeah," Harry said.
“I don’t know, he wanted to quote the stupid speeches at me or something.”
Their table was too close to the Gryffindors for Draco to be able to relax. He had his back to them, but they were loud, their voices carried. He couldn't hear what they were talking about, but he could easily make out Potter's voice, Potter's laugh amongst the others. He had the prickling sensation of being watched, but he couldn't turn to look in case he was right.
Draco’s gut wrenched. Four days was nothing.
"They're wyverns, you uneducated-"
“Is that clear?” he asked when he was done.
“No,” said Harry, a bit too forcefully.
house. There was no way he was turning around to go back there, so he just kept walking. He felt drained, exhausted. The cold had seeped into his bones and he just wanted to curl up in his bed and sleep forever. He was pretty sure he was sober by now. That didn't make any of it feel more real.
“So,” said Draco, still slightly out of breath. “That went better than last time.”
He looked down at their hands as he threaded his fingers through Potter’s fingers. Because he was an idiot. He was a constant disappointment to himself. When he looked up, Potter was watching him again and his face was so close. Draco stared into those startlingly green eyes and tried to read the expression in them. Potter leaned in.
Harry shook his head and forced a smile.
"I-" he began - he did remember her mentioning it now, he hadn't
“Can I try something?”
“It’s fine,” he said. “I need to talk to Malfoy about the patronus charm anyway. I’ll meet you back in the common room.”
It was a phrase they had been repeating to each other since the first morning after Voldemort’s death. The first time they woke up and looked at each other it had been relief. Later, it had become a reassurance for when they couldn’t feel the relief they were supposed to, or for when it felt like it wasn’t over or that what they did hadn’t been good enough. Right then, Harry could hear himself putting too much force into the words. It sounded like he was trying to convince her.
She took the glass away. He looked at his hands in his lap. They twitched.
“Well, that certainly makes me want to ask."
“It’s nothing,” he said. “Just this… really fucking strange incident.”
He leaned in close to her.
“You too,” she said to Malfoy.
!” cried Weasley slashing her wand downwards.
“Yes,” said Harry. “He was my godfather. And he was still a person.”
“Potter’s patronus is a bloody
The pub was a small, unassuming place, but nicer than the one he had met Draco at last time. There was football playing on screens behind the bar, a couple of men watching it intently and quiet chatter around the room. Harry looked around for Malfoy's blonde hair and spotted him in a corner where two tables had been pushed together and a group of young people were squashed closely around them. Malfoy had his back to the door, but Harry had spent so much time following Draco around Hogwarts, he could pick the back of his head out of a line up. Harry headed towards them and the girl across from Draco seemed to notice. She perked up in her seat and said something to Draco, who turned around.
“Pansy isn’t with you?” asked Ron.
“How did it go?” asked Neville.
Draco nodded.
“I’m… going upstairs.”
“Just go, Harry.”
“What?”
Harry wasn't sure how long they had been walking, wasn't quite sure where they were either. The neighbourhood had changed while they walked, the buildings becoming shabbier, fewer people in the street.
“Then it’s here.”
“I didn’t tell anyone. I was just testing to see if I was right, and I wasn’t. It’s not like it was anything important, I would’ve told you if I thought it mattered.”
“Well, thank you for bringing your son back, I hope he enjoyed the holidays. It’s past curfew now, so if you don’t mind, I think professor Hagrid and I should escort him inside.”
Pansy finally stopped for breath and there was a long, tense pause while Ginny regarded her coldly.
It’s clumsy, Draco hasn’t done it before. It doesn’t matter.
“Yeah, I didn’t see it coming either. It’s definitely in the top hundred of completely unexpected things that happened in the last year or so.”
Draco grinned and Potter’s face split into a smile that sent a jolt through him. He had almost forgotten that they could be like this around each other – relaxed, easy, just talking. It felt like one of their flying trips, except with the exhilaration of flight replaced by the calm and warmth of the room that was turning golden as the sun sank and more light filtered through the window. He could see the shadows of the mullions drawing dark patterns across Potter’s skin. He looked so relaxed as he stood there in his crumpled shirt, watching Draco. He didn’t look like Harry Potter, saviour of the world, he just looked like a boy with a nice smile and terribly messy hair, and Draco thought how nice it would be if it could always be like that.
Ron sighed.
"Draco, if you're fucking with me-" she began.
“A little over a week ago,” said Granger.
"Your stupidity. You're clearly useless without Granger there to save you from yourself."
“Pansy, wait-“
"What did he apologize for?" asked Ron.
And then there was silence. The rain wasn’t hammering as hard against the roof as before, but it was still pouring down out there. Harry took a gulp of whisky and tried not to grimace at the taste. Malfoy was swirling the remaining contents around in his own glass.
“What I don’t get,” said Ron, “is how he managed to avoid Azkaban.”
"Okay then."
“We should have locked the door,” said Harry quietly.
“Plotting? Are you serious? I’m done spending my time doing stupid shit just to piss you off, alright, I’m not a kid anymore. And the war is over, I’m lucky to not be in prison, you think I’m about to throw that away on some stupid revenge-scheme?”
“Fine with me.”
“He just said he wanted to talk.”
"How can it be my turn? You haven't been up there yet, Blaise hasn't been up there."
Potter looked away as if he didn’t know what to say. Or maybe like he was working up to an apology. Draco sat down again
Harry looked away, down towards the lake where some frustrated Hufflepuff-kid was trying to teach his classmates how to play football. He hadn’t told Ron and Hermione much about Malfoy’s trial.
“I mean, why does no one know? As far as I know, no one has seen you in… I don’t know, the last year?”
“Potter,” he said loudly. “You awake?”
“Why not?” said Malfoy, sounding almost earnest
mastered
“I only took the titles that seemed the most promising, but I’ve noted down everything else that we might have to check out later. It’s not prioritized, since I just wrote them down as I went around, but they’re ordered by section, so they’ll be easy to find again later.”
“I understand that you want to acknowledge his redeeming qualities, but why do you have to turn him into a
Draco jerked his head back and Potter stepped away from him so fast he wasn’t sure he didn’t apparate.
"You're going drinking
“I don’t know!” Harry snapped. “Maybe I just like talking to him, and maybe I want to do that without having to think about how that affects everyone’s feelings. Why does
So she had seen them, then, she had just hoped he wouldn't. A second later, Blaise and Greg caught up with them.
“God,” she said quietly. “I just… I really don’t want to have this conversation with you, alright? I… appreciate what you said, but I just can’t.”
“I’m the one who brought it up in the first place,” he said. “And I haven’t really been doing my part of the heroics these last few years. It would look pretty bad if I tried to pull out, wouldn’t it? I can’t imagine the Weasleys letting me get away with that.”
“What’s happening?” she muttered.
“It doesn’t matter.”
The snake reappeared, it threw itself at the dementors, a rotten hand reached out and dragged through it like it was only mist.
“No, not really.”
“Well that took you long enough,” said Blaise, standing up as soon as Draco came through the door.
It only takes a couple of days for his head to become a weird space to be in. It does odd things to you not to talk to anyone or write to anyone and having so little contact with other people. Then he feels sorry for himself and then he gets mad at himself for feeling sorry for himself, it’s a wonderful little cycle. He can keep it going for hours.
"Quarter past five."
“What are you doing?” Ron demanded, staring wide eyed at the foam that now appeared around Hermione’s fingers and soaked into the sheets.
,” said Ron to the portrait of the Fat Lady.
He felt like shit. Potter had kissed him, and he felt like
He didn't tell Pansy about Potter's surprise visit. She might have sensed that there was something he wasn't telling her, but it was easier not to cave under her pointed questions when she was just a voice on the phone.
Draco rolled his yes.
“You don’t look happy.”
“Do you want to go back to the others?”
Ron found him in the kitchen, where he was making bacon and eggs.
Then they would get caught.
"Why would you do that?"
“Right,” Malfoy says bitterly, “you came here to
the holidays. Do you think he has been plotting this since before Christmas?”
“No. I don’t know. Maybe.”
“I suppose I should go back to Ravenclaw now,” she said. “I’ll see you later, Harry. Enjoy your pie.”
“Alright. Goodnight, then,” said Blaise.
Harry didn’t see Draco on the way from the castle to the gates either. They did pass Hagrid, who was managing the thestrals and helping the younger students with their luggage. Harry, Ron and Hermione had been by his hut for tea the day before and had said their goodbyes then, so they only waved to him before they climbed into their own carriage.
Harry stared at the dark shapes in the living room around him, at the shadows between them. His body was still braced for news of someone’s death, and it was only somewhere beyond that tense anxiety he registered the name and put a face to the posh voice.
The burial itself was over very quickly. The aurors helped levitate the coffin into its designated space in the mausoleum and then the ministry official sealed it off. They had asked the official not to make a speech or anything like it, so he only offered his condolences and then a house elf escorted him off the grounds.
And Harry had kissed him.
“Draco!” someone called and he started, every nerve in him screamed
“Ginny and I broke up,” he says.
Malfoy dropped a teabag into the pot. Harry waited.
“What?” asked Draco.
“Yes, I know.”
"Well, the muggle solutions work fine," Malfoy said with a shrug. "And you know, I might want to have muggles over one day and still be able to offer them a cup of tea or smoke a cigarette if I want, it really pays to know how these things work, Potter."
Draco had heard him take that tone with Snape in potions, with Umbridge in fifth year, the resigned sarcasm of Potter deciding to be nothing but stubborn and stupid and unreachable. It meant Draco would end up hitting him again.
“Me too. I already found some books, you can use them if you need to.”
“I think I’ll head back out for a bit, actually. I’ll just fly a short trip around the grounds.”
“I know this is just you trying to be
“Goodbye,” she said.
“So why haven’t you?”
“It’s pretty vague…”
“Why are you asking me to help you?”
“That’s not what we agreed-“ Harry began again, about to protest, but she cut him off:
“So we’ll be able to find our way back.”
was not your decision.”
Ginny was out of breath and off-balance, but they had all seen Pansy’s first spell miss; they had all seen Ginny cast the shield in time for the second one.
“Is that an invisibility cloak?” asked Pansy, pointing Draco’s attention to the piece of cloth folded in Granger’s arms.
Ginny crossed her arms and looked expectantly at Potter.
"Do you need help?"
“Right,” he heard Potter say, but by then Draco was already hurrying down the corridor.
“There’s no reason they would check our beds. We’ll be back before they even wake up tomorrow. And if we’re not, Dean and Seamus are going to be the least of our problems.”
“I kept expecting him to pull some shit on me, or to start with you or Hermione or do something like what Parkinson did, but he didn’t, and I’m starting to think he’s really just a mess in the same way we are.”
!” said Hermione turning around to face him. “And
“Well you see, that’s how it works with fights. Before the fight people get along and afterwards they don’t,” he explained.
“Malfoy?”
Neither of them moved.
“I don’t know. Why does that matter? We have to do something about it. Now.”
Harry pulled his hand back.
Harry hesitated. He had thought that was what he was doing, but now that Malfoy pointed it out, it was true that he didn’t need much mental preparation to cast his patronus. That time he and Dudley were attacked by dementors, he hadn’t been thinking at all.
“Yeah, I’ll believe that when he apologizes for all the shit he’s done.”
at him, isn't that weird?"
Harry feels like his heart is trying to crawl up his throat, his mouth is full of bitter acid and Draco’s words are still echoing in his head:
“And whose fault is that?”
"Boyfriend?"
“Him and Ginny’ll be up in a second, they were right behind us.”
“Then why do we do it?” Harry asked.
But despite the angry protests of Ron and Ginny, of Fred and George, and the increasingly tired faces of the adults, there isn’t anything they can do about it. And the next morning, Hagrid arrives, a polyjuiced Draco and two black dragon skin suitcases in tow. Ron leaves the house in anger, slamming every door on the way and is gone for hours.
“No, she’s off somewhere fighting your sister.”
“I won’t be able to brew anything in the same room as that evil git.”
"I'll appreciate it when I get off work, but the weather might as well be shitty if we're trapped in here anyway - hello, how can I help you?"
He closed his book and put it down on the table. Pansy looked up at him.
Draco walked to the restricted section at the far end of the library. It was roped off so people didn’t wander in there by mistake, though it was unlikely anyone would – it felt different than the rest of library in a way that was impossible not to notice, like some of the darkness and some of the power sealed in the books had seeped into the air and made it prickle against the skin.
“Well, that is strange.”
“Why?” he said.
Harry almost breathed a sigh of relief at the insult - at least that meant they were done with the apologies.
Draco knew without looking that Pansy was rolling her eyes.
Draco opened his mouth and closed it again.
Malfoy straightened in his chair and finally stopped fiddling with his glass.
“Did I wake you up?” Draco asked.
“He said he wasn’t angry about anything,” Harry continued quietly. “But he obviously
“I haven’t seen you in months! It’s so nice you’re back and that you’re doing alright, you have no idea how relieved I am, but it would be nice if you would at least acknowledge that you have been ignoring my letters the whole summer. I was worried about you.”
“It is,” she said, reopening her magazine and flipping back to her article. “I can’t believe it’s actually working out for you. I honestly never thought Potter was that dense.”
He pushed open the door at the very top of the tower and stepped out into the sunshine. It was quite different up there in the daytime, the view of the grounds a watery endlessness of toned down colours this time of year, when the grass below was muddy, the sky pale and the Forbidden Forest mostly black and leafless. Draco stood up when he saw him, the wind grabbing hold of his robes and tossing his hair across his face.
"Bad memories?" Harry asked, turning the suggestion back on him. Which was a dumb thing to do. Malfoy had started it, but Harry didn't want to have that conversation. He knew exactly what bad memories Malfoy had of Hogwarts. Bringing it up felt like pushing the fragile peace that currently hung between them towards an edge - their conversation at the pub had been lurking in the corners ever since Harry had stepped into the flat, but they were both skirting carefully around it, keeping it casual, keeping it light, avoiding the serious shit that would make spending even half an hour in the same room unbearable.
The silver stag erupted from his wand, filling the room with light. It looked much bigger when it was cast indoors like this. He couldn’t help imagining what it would look like to Malfoy, who had never seen it before; who had possibly never seen a patronus up close at all. And he knew it had to be impressive.
"What about you, then?" he asked. "Do you have some secret girlfriend hidden away somewhere?"
!” she grunted as she stepped forward, herding it towards the wizard.
“I don’t know what made you think we would want to cooperate with Slytherins about anything,” she said, “but anyone who was able to laugh after one of those classes-“
“It’s the middle of the night.”
“I didn’t know what the spell did,” he says finally.
“Oh come on, Ron," Hermione said. "Of course he should go. It could be important! It’s not like Malfoy would contact Harry just for the company.”
He had lost his father to him.
“You’re sure I can’t convince you to drop it?”
Neville nodded.
“This is nice,” he said. “I can’t feel anything.”
“What, you still think we’re bringing him?”
"I mean… It's nothing. It's just something he got when we were 16."
“Shit,” he said.
“How are things with you and Ginny?”
“Sorry I’m late,” said Draco quietly as they headed for the exit. “Nott kept moving around, I wasn’t sure if he was asleep.”
“We’re fighting right now!”
“Right. Good,” he said. “Are you still flying that
“I thought it was here,” he said.
He fished it out of his pocket and handed it to her.
“Hey,” said Potter, his voice a bit gravelly.
“It can’t be that difficult. There ought to be books on it in the library. And Ron, you should really get your mother to teach you.”
“It’s just… We’re…” he trailed off again.
Then she turned on her heel and the left the room, slamming the door behind her. Pansy stood frozen. She looked like she would curse the first thing that moved. Then she hissed something that sounded a lot like “Gryffindors”, before storming out the room just as Ginny had. When the door had slammed shut, Hermione let out a sigh and stood up.
“Thought you didn’t need my help,” mumbled Potter without looking at him.
“Yes.”
“I think we stand a decent chance. You should’ve seen how we flew today. Ron will be bragging all night, he saved everything Dean threw at him and he’s not going to miss a chance to rub it in. Oh, but Ginny is worried about Ravenclaw, she says the captain smiles ominously at her, but I think she’s just being paranoid…”
“Oh, it was my turn this week, wasn’t it? I completely forgot, I’ve been so busy-“
“Remember how we talked about cutting the dementors off?” she said. “How they thrive on misery, so what would happen if you could keep them from feeding on anyone?”
He waited. A second passed and then Malfoy’s voice was there again, repeating uncertainly:
Harry had been called in as a witness for the trials of both Malfoy and his mother. He had told the Wizengamot how she lied for him when Voldemort thought he had killed him. He had also mentioned how Draco had lowered his wand in the Astronomy Tower, before Snape killed Dumbledore, and had been surprised he even remembered. His statements hadn’t seemed to matter much though. The heaviest argument had been how young Malfoy was when he took the mark, that he was underage when he committed most of his crimes, and that he had been pressured by his family into joining the Dark Lord. It had been almost even how many had voted for and how many against pardoning him. He remembered how long it took to count the raised hands. Malfoy had been three votes from a life sentence to Azkaban. Not that he had seemed to care; the boy at the hearing had been almost unrecognizable to Harry. His skin had been dull, almost grey, his eyes sunken in their hollows and the cheekbones jutting out like they were about to cut through the skin. It had reminded Harry of how Sirius looked when they first met. His hair had been matted and dirty, far from the smooth silk Harry remembered, and all the arrogance and confidence that usually emanated from him had disappeared. Before them had sat a frail teenage boy with slack mouth and dead, unseeing eyes. His voice was monotone when he was questioned, and Harry would have thought he was completely indifferent towards his sentence if it hadn’t been for the way he winced whenever the dementors were mentioned, more a physical than a conscious reaction to the word.
"Okay," he said. "Sure. Why do you live here? I thought you got your house back."
Malfoy rolls his eyes.
"Public schools," she muttered.
this time. All Draco’s pent up anxiousness, his fear and anticipation, was spilling over in relieved, triumphant laughter, and the boggart retreated into the darkness of the wardrobe. Potter stepped forward to push the door closed behind it, then he turned to look at Draco, grinning broadly at him.
“There’s also the issue of the aurors,” said Neville.
“Yes,” said Malfoy.
“How can you say that?” said Ginny.
that had seized him – Harry started awake, the jolt of being tripped and falling. His heart was pounding. He breathed deeply. He stared up into the darkness for a couple of seconds as the euphoria ebbed out of him and was replaced by slow, sinking worry.
“I don’t want a fuss,” he says quickly. “Really, Mrs Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine… it’s the day before the wedding… please, don’t go to loads of trouble.”
Harry ignored him. He dropped the dried poppy-petals into his cauldron and looked at the instructions again. He had to let the potion simmer for five minutes before doing anything else. He let his eyes wander down the page, looking for other ingredients he could prepare. He had to slice his mandrake root. He found a knife and cutting board and went to work.
He sounded tired.
Blaise nodded.
“You should be a DJ, Luna. We’d hire you for all the Gryffindor parties.”
, and then different circles sketched around it.
He stood.
They had gotten the message from the Gryffindors the day before. Draco’s fight with Pansy had gotten in the way of him telling Harry what they had found out about the dementors and he hadn’t talked to him since. So maybe Granger had told them, or maybe they had no reason but simply felt it instinctively, how it was all looming ever closer, the way Draco did. No matter the reason, they had decided that they ought to practice their duelling before heading to Azkaban. They no longer had access to the room of requirement, so they would have to get off the school grounds to stay unnoticed.
Pansy stood in the doorway. The door was open to the corridor, her hand still on the handle, lost in the middle of movement and she was looking at the two of them with an expression like she had just eaten one of the more unpleasant types of every-flavour-beans.
“Anyone else hear that?” asked Ron.
“I said I was going to
“You’re looking skinny,” – maybe she would say that instead.
“Ron and Ginny aren’t here yet?” asked Neville.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
He nodded again.
He was outside and halfway down the street when his brain finally caught up with him.
“So you might have defeated the Dark Lord,” he said, “and sent my father to Azkaban and stolen my legacy. You might have stopped muggleborns from being murdered in their homes and Death Eaters from terrorizing the school, but it’s still the same elite group of people who hold the power in this country, which means that everything is just as it’s always been. You might receive an Order of Merlin and your friends might become aurors, but one day my children will be sorted into Slytherin along with the Parkinsons, the Selwyns and the Zabinis and they will continue to rule.”
They walked down the corridor outside the portrait.
“What?” she said, like she hadn’t noticed anything.
“Good,” she said. “Uneventful, apart from… you know, all the mess.”
“You don’t have to pretend that this is about my grades, professor,” he interrupted.
It wasn’t a real letter, just a rolled up piece of parchment. When he got it loose, the owl took off out the window and Hermione closed it again as Harry unrolled the note.
“Well, this was a disaster,” he said when Potter didn’t say anything.
"Shit," he muttered. "I'm still not entirely sure you didn't leave half my guts behind."
“It’s stopped raining,” said Malfoy.
“You were in the inquisitorial squad,” he says tightly. “You were a Death Eater.”
“What?”
He wondered if the swear would still work if it wasn’t true when you said it. He honestly couldn’t remember if he had ever used the map without going against either school rules or with the deliberate intent of not following someone’s advice. He tried not to think about what Hermione had said and he tried not to feel silly. He wasn’t being silly – he just couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t sleep and the creeping sense of coming disaster had returned. He felt that if something did go wrong this year, it would be his fault. If Malfoy was plotting something or if Death Eaters were breaking into Hogwarts or Voldemort was somehow coming back to life, he was the one who had to stop it. Not that he really believed any of those things were happening, it was just a feeling. He knew what Ron and Hermione – and Ginny and probably everyone else – would say if he told them. But it didn’t matter that it wasn’t rational, it didn’t make it go away. So he found the Slytherin common room on the map and he checked and double-checked, and his heart rate picked up when he realized that Malfoy wasn’t in his dorm. Since all the other students were clustered around the common rooms, it didn’t take long to find the dot labelled Draco Malfoy, which was on its own, out of bounds and headed towards the owlery. Harry took a deep breath and for a second tried half-heartedly to dissuade himself from what he knew he was about to do anyway. Then he swung his feet over the edge of the bed, got dressed in a hurry, and left his dorm with the marauder’s map in hand.
“Thanks,” he said. “You do too.”
He had beat up Malfoy. That had been a pretty stupid thing to do, he knew that, but if he ever saw that smug look on the bastard’s face again, he would probably do it again. Even thinking about it now sent new jabs of anger through him – he had been such an idiot. He knew Malfoy. He had known him for years; he shouldn’t have believed for one second that he could have changed.
“She’s not dumb. She would have figured it out eventually anyway. But I talked to her and she won’t tell anyone. It can still be a secret.”
“We’re good, just go on. And be careful down there.”
"You actually came," he said when Harry reached them.
He didn’t feel light. He was tired. Tired and more disappointed than he cared to admit. Not that it had been awful exactly, but the whole thing, seeing Potter's face again, trying to navigate what he could and couldn't say, it had just felt…
“Out,” he said, pushing Draco towards the cell door.
“Ron was angry about him even coming with us, and that’s, what, two weeks ago?”
“Why?”
He sounded slightly shaken. Draco nodded. He swallowed.
“Thanks,” he said.
Draco led him up the stairs. He stopped on the second landing.
“Nothing. You want to have a look?”
He followed her up the stairs and into the Entrance Hall in awkward silence. The hall was only dimly lit this time of day and it was a second before either of them noticed the figure sitting on the stairs waiting for them.
"Can it wait five minutes? I know you're not feeling great right now, but Hermione wanted me to ask you if you apparated home last night, because-"
“If you’re so tired then go to sleep, Longbottom.”
“Malfoy,” he said finally, flatly.
Lovegood looked up at her.
“I’m aware of that,” he said coolly. “You also left my friend to die.”
“What? No, the directions were fine, I just got lost on the tube.”
“You think I wanted to do it? Really? I’m a
It happens a lot after that. Always the same way, Draco discretely slipping Harry a note or whispering to him a time and a place for them to meet and Harry crumpling the paper in his pocket or pretending not to hear the whisper. He promises himself he won’t go, but then he watches the clock anxiously as the time draws closer and at the last minute he goes anyway. He hates himself for going, maybe that’s why he’s so rough. He never really knows if he’s going to beat him up or kiss him when it starts. Then at some point Draco will get on his knees and push Harry’s shirt up, open his trousers for him, and Harry likes that part way too much. Sometimes he gently kisses the skin on Harry’s stomach and Harry tells him to just get fucking on with it, and he usually does.
“I didn’t
Harry shrugged.
"Well then. It was nice talking to you, Potter."
“Blaise, calm down,” said Draco, trying to sound bored. “They’re
It was an opening like the ones of the cells upstairs, except it looked much deeper. Harry waved his patronus forward and the stag walked a few hesitant steps into the darkness.
“I don’t think you need to worry about that,” he said, which was when Harry noticed the faint blush creeping up Malfoy’s neck.
“I’m not having mood swings, I just wasn’t staring at anything.”
the whole time, understand?”
“So I heard. Professor Slughorn seemed worried that you might spend too much time goofing off.”
It was the first Christmas after the war and of course it would have been impossible not to feel the emptiness left by all the people who had died. But the burrow was still full of people, there were guests in every bedroom and Mrs Weasley kept everyone busy with cooking for and cleaning after everyone, with entertaining guests and running errands for her.
They were on their way down another broad staircase, they couldn’t even see far enough to make out the wall to their left and only saw glimpses of the railing to their right.
“We can’t. We talked about this, we can’t apparate into Azkaban, so we have to go to the coast, and he’s the only one who’s been there,” said Hermione.
“We’re friends,” he said, which wasn’t discreet either, but they hadn’t prepared for this, and the easiest lie to pull off would be one that was at least somewhat close to the truth.
“You told them or..?”
“No, we don’t know if any of last year’s members still have theirs. We’ll make new ones, find a way to get them to the Slytherins.”
The last word came out reluctantly, with the slightest hint of a sneer. The kettle clicked and Malfoy poured the water into the pot, and Harry realized he couldn't keep hovering by the door much longer. Reluctantly, he left the safe, neutral space by the shoes and the coats and crossed through Malfoy's living room to join him in the tiny kitchen space. Malfoy glanced at him, but his eyes quickly returned to the teacups. He reached out and turned one of them, his fingers resting on the edge.
“Doesn’t he seem a bit… off to you?”
“No,” he said.
“Yes, but how is that enough to get him off for attempted murder, cursing and probably torturing people, being pals with Bellatrix Lestrange and having Voldemort hanging around his house? If I were on the Wizengamot I would be thrilled at a chance to lock him away.”
She looked up.
“Sure,” he said and grabbed a handful of flowers for her.
Harry’s stomach did an uncomfortable flip. He knew that wasn’t what Ron meant, but it still sounded too much like what Luna had said. He continued:
!” he cried.
“No? It said so in the
"It's uh… I suppose they were mostly white," Harry floundered, "but they weren't… Most of them weren't like… Draco."
“No, Draco, this wasn’t-“ Harry mutters, not even sure what he’s saying. “No, no…”
“Perhaps some place more… discrete?”
Draco turned to leave.
In the glow from his wand, Harry watched Draco unfold the pamphlet and the light jumped over a detailed map of London. Draco put the tip of the wand to the paper.
“Okay,” he says.
Draco pushed open the door to an empty compartment and Pansy levitated their suitcases onto the rack. He sat down in the seat by the window and looked back out at the platform.
“Sorry.”
“How’s Ginny doing as captain?”
“You’re such a Gryffindor, Weasley,” said Parkinson before Ginny could finish her sentence or Harry could think of anything to say. “You love simple stories with shiny heroes and terrible villains, but that’s not how the world works.”
He flicked his wand and his trunk landed neatly next to theirs when he joined them. He draped an arm over Harry’s shoulders, sagging heavily against him.
“Sure. Fine,” he said and decided not to mention that apart from giving the Slytherin students a private place to talk, Aberforth had also been smuggling food for the DA through his inn. Or that he was Dumbledore’s brother, which Malfoy didn’t seem to be aware of either.
"What did he want?" asked Blaise, looking towards the bar.
"Huh. I just woke up."
Harry could hear waves. The air was tinged with the salty smell of rotting seaweed. He was still holding on to Draco’s arm.
“I think if I had had friends like that, I might have… some things would have been easier. I might have done some things differently.”
It only lasted a moment and then everything was quiet except for a distant ringing in Draco’s ears.
Right. He had forgotten that Potter- that Harry had probably just told them where he’d slept.
“I don’t know what I was thinking,” he said.
"Had to check if Ron was burning the kitchen down."
Ron’s face went completely wrong. He looked at Harry, horrified.
“And you said
“Fine. What about the rest?”
"Where's Malfoy?" he asked.
He shook his head.
“So do you know what the others are finding out?” he asked.
“Well, I’m glad to hear it. It’s only healthy to take a bit of time to decide what you want to do. But I want you to know that no matter which direction you decide to go in, there will always be a home for you here at Hogwarts.”
She grabbed at Harry who hauled her back on her feet as Draco disentangled himself from her. She glared at him.
He has his back to the door, Draco can’t see his face.
It was a thin excuse, especially since Draco hoped desperately he would be able to stay mostly out of any fights, but he was curious. They turned to watch the duels going on around them, the loud cracks of magic and flashes of light seeming closer now that they weren’t duelling themselves anymore.
Draco nodded and she led the way.
She unfolded the newspaper and let her eyes run over the front page. She had just begun flipping through it when Draco caught sight of Harry over her shoulder as he entered the Great Hall and headed for the Gryffindor table. He reached it and was halfway down the side of it before he seemed to notice that his friends weren’t there. He stopped and Draco watched him as he turned around and scanned over the other tables. He looked over Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, turned back to Gryffindor and then to Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw again. And then, slowly, he raised his head and looked towards Slytherin. It wasn’t like it was hard to spot a Weasley head in a group of non-Weasleys, and Harry’s eyes found them quickly. He hesitated, but only for a second. And then Harry Potter walked resolutely away from the Gryffindor table, across the Great Hall to the Slytherins at the opposite end.
The shrill call of the whistle pierced the air and both of them looked up.
But of course Potter would assume it was something important when Draco had sent a bloody patronus to get him like this was the Order of the Phoenix. Or maybe he had come because he felt bad about what had happened in the dungeon the other day - Draco had just assumed that it was all good, it had seemed like they were on the same page about it when they split up. But of course he could have read that wrong –
Potter grimaced and Draco immediately felt bad for saying it. He didn’t need to defend Pansy from Potter. It was stupid to fight him just out of habit when he really didn’t want them to be fighting.
“So do all your friends know about us now?” he asked.
“Yeah, you’re spending a lot of time with him, aren’t you? I feel like I’ve hardly seen you lately.”
“I saw them and asked Harry about it. He asked me not to tell anyone.”
“You’ll be fine. You’ve done nothing but fight him for the last seven years, and you still managed to get him into bed with you.”
"You robbed a bank?"
When he reached the pub, the soft drizzle had turned into heavy rain. Harry ducked inside and slammed the door behind him. He tried to shake the rain out of his robes and unwrapped the scarf from his head, which had kept his hair mostly dry. The pub was almost empty and of course Malfoy wasn’t there. Harry could hear the rain hammering down on the roof and ricocheting from the windows when caught by a particularly strong gust of wind – trying to get back to the others at The Three Broomsticks would be ridiculous. He would just have to stay until the rain stopped and hope that Malfoy had only gotten cold feet or regretted his invitation and not bothered to tell Harry, and that this wasn’t some stupid trick meant to get him in trouble, like the things he had pulled when they were younger. Feeling both irritated and immensely stupid, Harry went up to the counter to order a butterbeer.
It was two days before Harry got a chance to speak to Draco again. It used to be so easy to get a hold of him, to hang back after class, slip him a note in the corridors or just run into him by chance in the Owlery or the library, but now it felt nearly impossible to even come near him without being noticeable. Maybe it had always been like that, but he hadn’t really noticed the difficulty before, when it was just about Azkaban, and he hadn’t wanted to get a hold of him
“I have detention with McGonagall tonight.”
Harry rolled his eyes. He had sliced more than enough mandrake root, but he needed to keep his hands busy, so he took the knife again, picked out another root and started over.
“I know.”
“Alright, we’ll wait a bit.”
“Right”, said Harry.
“Right, well, I do.”
“You would be surprised how many of your housemates have accepted the offer.”
Draco took a step back.
“It shouldn’t. You don’t need to be his pity-case. We don’t need them.”
“Is Dean with you?” he asked.
next year. Just came back through the Floo.”
“You’re not a girl,” he mumbled.
“Oh, come on-“
It took a second before Malfoy noticed what he was looking at.
"I'm sure we passed one just- ah, there it is," Malfoy said, before disappearing into a narrow alley.
The phone was on the floor, halfway behind one of the couches - a result of a long and tedious process of figuring out a way to squeeze muggle technology into a house as soaked with magic as Grimmauld Place. Harry took a deep breath before reaching down to pick up the receiver.
Hermione sighed.
“Don’t be silly, Harry.”
Actually, Draco had meant to ask her about them. As far as he knew, Granger had taken just about every boring subject available at Hogwarts, and he would have thought her unable to stay away from something as dry as ancient runes. He was also a bit surprised to hear her admit so blankly that there was something she didn’t know.
“That’s enough, Alain!”
how to feel about it. And this was just… a free fall, a tumble of things that were completely out of his control. He wasn’t even sure whether to blame his house or his family for the fact that he had already envisioned every single possible scenario in which this could be used against him.
“Maybe not. I know lots of people who could have advised you on how to handle the media better.”
Draco hesitated. Potter wasn’t just telling him to fuck off. There was real curiosity in his voice, and also something else, something that made him feel immediately sick – pity. He did not need Potter to feel sorry for him.
"Fuck," Potter muttered, dropping his keys.
“No, I guess not. But of course it’s different. You’ve heard what it was like with Snape and the Carrows. Sometimes I feel terrible that we weren’t even here – I know it wouldn’t have changed anything, but still. It really worries me that they haven’t hired a psychiatrist, but apparently wizards aren’t big on therapy. I think the professors are just trying really hard to get everything back to normal as smoothly as possible, but even they must have some trauma they need to work through. I’m going to talk to McGonagall about it. I mean, many of the kids have been
"You know I'm always here for you."
"It's Saturday."
He nodded down at his plate.
"They were the ones who offered, when you wanted to stay longer."
He had stopped just inside the door and didn’t move to sit down. Draco cleared his throat.
In three quick strides Blaise had reached the boy and caught his arm in a tight grip.
"I guess?" he said.
The fire was a chimera, a phoenix, a dragon; predatory muscles of white-tinged flame that moved beneath its shoulder blades as it turned its massive head to look at him. There was only the one creature, and it was still leashed by Granger’s wand. Her face was wet with sweat.
“Several of your teachers have shown concern about your performance in their classes.”
“Azkaban isn’t a very nice place,” he said gravely.
“Good,” Lucius managed hoarsely. “That’s very good.”
Blaise just rolled his eyes.
Harry opens his mouth and closes it again when no words present themselves. For a second there is just silence as this new truth hangs between them, as the words reverberate in Harry’s skull, reshaping distant memories of slips of paper, whispered times, empty classrooms.
It was Friday afternoon and Harry, Ron and Hermione were lying in the grass by the lake near an old willow tree. It was the end of September, but autumn hadn’t quite set in yet and this was another warm day with sun from a clear blue sky. Ron had brought wizard's chess with him and Hermione had finally conceded to let him teach her how to play.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
of October, Harry was waiting for Malfoy down by the quidditch pitch. He sat on one of the benches, his elbows resting on his knees and his Firebolt propped up next to him. He was watching the sky above, a great mass of grey, rolling clouds that misted the air with fine drops of rain. He could see heavier and blacker clouds on the horizon, but he figured they would be back inside before the heavy rain reached them. From the castle, a small figure was making its way towards him. The dishwater light of dusk made their meeting feel sinister and secret, a dark contrast to the golden light streaming out of the windows from the Great Hall where the feast had just begun. Malfoy was carrying his broom over his shoulder. The black school robes billowed around him in the wind and the white blond hair was whipped out of place across his haughty, handsome face. Harry stood and picked up his broom.
“That girl in the cell.”
There were a few rows of desks along the walls, but the centre of the room was empty, except for a raised dais probably intended for duelling demonstrations. There were scorch marks in the wallpaper and dust on every surface. Draco lingered in the doorway.
Ginny sat down in the grass and the others followed. They formed a small, irregular circle of teenagers with tired faces, still recovering from the shock and relief from the duel, still with adrenaline pumping through their bodies. After all the noise of their spells, the night seemed completely quiet. Draco could feel the cold air drying the sweat on his neck.
“Oh. Yeah you can, I hadn’t seen that.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows.
Maya laughed even harder.
“This is not…” Draco began, but stopped himself, because he really didn’t know what he had been expecting, even if it wasn’t this.
“I don’t-“ she began, still in her business-like tone.
“We need better light –
"Boarding school, right? Isn't it all rich white kids there?"
“I don’t know alright? It’s like what we talked about, how it’s weird that he’s still here after all that happened, and the war and his trial and I didn’t like that we still ran into him, but then I don’t even know him, it’s just this dumb thing that started when we were 11, and it seemed stupid to keep it going.”
Potter started. He looked around, taking a second to place Draco’s voice and spot him in the darkness. Draco sighed inwardly. Running into Potter alone at night could happen twice and still be a coincidence. Three times, and it began to look ridiculous.
“Just go ahead,” she said to the other Gryffindors. “I’ll meet you up there.”
She didn’t look up from her book. She didn’t look like she was trying to read it anymore either.
”Draco, he’s a hero and a Gryffindor, probably the most Gryffindor person in all of Hogwarts. You know what they’re like. They don’t think. They don’t look at things and try to understand them, they just decide “this is good and this is bad”, and then they rush in head first and try to kill the bad thing. And it’s even better if they don’t even have to decide it themselves, if someone else can decide it for them. That’s why there are always Gryffindors all over the place in wars, because they just love to have someone pointing them to a battlefield saying “that’s the evil thing you have to kill.” You know Potter is like that, so you did your thing and made him trust you, and then you pointed to the bad thing and asked him to kill it for you.”
“My point is that maybe we should give it a bit more time. See if we can get closer to a solution for the pit before we tell the other’s what we’ve found out.”
“Pomfrey said you should rest.”
“All of them?”
"And I wanted to apologize.”
“I know,” Potter says. “I saw you lower your wand.”
“I am, I’m mad about everything, that doesn’t mean I want to be a hero. I don’t want to die and I don’t want to go to prison, I just…”
Another long pause. Then Malfoy spoke, very carefully:
Draco’s wand was already tucked away in his forearm holster, so disarming really wasn’t necessary. Potter looked down at his own hand as if he hadn’t been aware of the wand before.
“This is the obvious route that we’ve all taken the last two times, right?” she said. “And the first alternative would be to go down the east staircase from here instead…”
Harry sat down on the edge of the couch.
“I’m sure. Come on, Potter, quit stalling and let’s get it over with.”
“What?”
Harry shrugged.
Dean turned to look at Seamus, who was already in the bed and was grinning rather smugly at them. Dean threw his pillow at him.
“I haven’t had that many opportunities to drink.”
“What are you getting at?” she asked.
Pansy grinned.
“Don’t be a git, Ron,” said Neville.
Potter groaned.
She reached out her arm to them and Pansy took it.
“Ron, why would he be setting a trap?”
“Please Potter,” he drawls. “I know this was never anything other than some sort of masochistic… I don’t know, ‘fuck you’ to all the things people expected you to be.”
“Mrs. Malfoy and her son are here,” he said. “Can one of you take them down to Lucius Malfoy’s cell for their visit?”
“So… last year we defeated Voldemort, and we thought that was the end of the war - no, it was the end, but now there’s something else out there, and I think we have to stop it, because no one else is going to try this time. It’s not a dark wizard. It’s something the Ministry is responsible for. That’s why Malfoy is here. He asked me to help him with this, and I said I would.”
It was only halfway true. He was an excellent occlumens. His mother had taken it upon herself to teach him during the war when their home had been open to Death Eaters and to the Dark Lord himself, and it had turned out that Draco had inherited her natural talent for it. He was never quite as good as she was, he never could have lied to the Dark Lord’s face the way she did, but he was good enough. Legilimency on the other hand, had only been a minor point in his training, so that he would know what he was defending himself against. He had only ever done it to his mother.
Draco wished he had thought to apologize for putting him in that position. He hadn’t even considered the consequences for Potter if he tried to build a bridge between his friends and Draco. He remembered that Potter had not spent Christmas with his muggle family since he was eleven, how appalled he had looked at the idea of reducing friendships to alliances, and how many of Potter’s people were dead. He wanted to apologize and then he wanted to leave because, he had asked for Potter’s help, he had not asked him to risk his friendships.
. It had seemed important.
They stayed up there until the sun started to set and the air became too chilly. They didn’t talk about Harry’s friends or what would happen if they were caught or how hard it was not to look at each other in class, how hard it was to know that they couldn’t touch each other or speak to each other when anyone else was watching. They just talked about dumb things, funny things, things people had said and done during the week.
“Harry trusts you at the moment, so I’ll work with you,” she said. “I think you might be on to something about Azkaban, and that is the only reason I’m going along with any of this. We’re not friends. I don’t trust you, and what I said to you before the holidays still stands. If you give me any reason to think that you might be trying to hurt one of us, then it doesn’t matter what Harry thinks, I will get you kicked out of here so fast you won’t even know what happened.”
Little remembered bits of conversation were clicking into place in the back of Harry’s mind. Small things were making sense, most of them drowned out by the noise in his head as a major part of his world view was trying to shift, cranked by the cynicism that was Hermione’s unconcerned voice.
Pansy nodded.
return my books on time, too. I’ve never damaged a book either and I’ve used the library more than anyone else.”
Shrugs and nods around the scattered group and Pansy made as if to follow Weasley and Granger. Draco grabbed her sleeve.
He didn’t know why he said it. It wasn’t something he told people. He had spent all his years at Hogwarts trying to sever every tie he had to Slytherin. They had become secrets and things to be ashamed of. He had hated that house because he hated Malfoy, and because everything that tied Harry to Slytherin had also tied him to Voldemort.
Draco quickly wiped a hand over his cheek. He hadn’t noticed.
“I’ll be at Ron’s house.”
“Nothing, really. Just wanted to check that everything was alright.”
“What did Granger want?”
He stood rigidly, the knuckles where white on the hand that clutched his wand.
“You know I thought about that. Don’t they say that dark wizards can’t cast a patronus?” asked Ron.
“She’s not stupid,” he said. “She’s just mean.”
He had noticed Theodore Nott at the station earlier and it looked like he had arrived without his parents, just as Draco had. That had been somewhat comforting. He thought he had spotted the Greengrass sisters and Blaise Zabini, but they must have disappeared into the train by now.
Draco didn’t see him again the rest of that day.
Pansy was on her feet and had snatched Granger’s wand – her curse missed Weasley by mere inches.
“We are. I’m just giving the others a bit more time,” said Weasley.
, doesn’t it?”
“I haven’t thought any part of this was a good idea since we started.”
“No one is angry, Harry. It’s fine, alright.”
“Why does it matter if they’re here?” he snapped. “Didn’t you listen? It’s not about them, it’s not about what happened during the war-“
“You think you changed something, don’t you?” he continued, knowing he was being an idiot, but he had been wanting to shout at someone for months.
There was a pause while he drank with theatrical commitment. He put the bottle down too heavily on the stone floor between them. Harry picked it up. He didn’t really want to be drunk, but he also didn’t fancy being the audience for Malfoy’s dramatic descent into drunken self-pity if he was to be sober himself. Malfoy looked approvingly at him.
“Don’t be mean, Ginny,” said Hannah.
Sleep still feels unattainably far away even after Malfoy has come down and gone back up, and Harry lies awake, eyes open, looking at the dark ceiling, debating whether or not he should go.
He tries to push it down, to forget about it. He left, that’s the important part. He left and nothing happened.
“Sure.”
She closed her book and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.
She grinned triumphantly.
Harry crossed his arms.
Draco sat in the back of the class and watched the airy temple pillars of dust swirling lazily in the light. He was two rows behind Potter. He could see his shoulder move when he took notes and the way the light got caught in the embroidered gold on his Gryffindor-uniform. The light played in his hair too, seeming to outline the edges of the messy curls, like Potter was emitting his own soft glow. And messy wasn’t really the right word, Draco thought. Usually Potter’s hair was a bird’s nest and he clearly never even touched it after getting out of bed in the morning, but sometimes the mess managed to look
Malfoy fell silent. They were all silent as the horrors of his story sank in.
“What do you want from me?”
Slughorn nodded.
Malfoy scoffed.
“But I’m glad we talked.”
“Yeah. I’m glad to know that. It means a lot,” she said stiffly. “Thank you for telling me.”
The way her voice dropped on that last word that sent a cold, trickling shiver down Draco’s spine. No one would say it like that unless they had been attacked by a dementor and knew exactly what it felt like; knew that
"Where are we going?" he asked.
He waited for a second, but she didn’t elaborate.
“Crates are quiet again,” he announced. “I’ll drop them by the store on my way to work. If they blow up they should do it there-”
Harry didn't say anything. He supposed it was meant to be a jab at him, but it was sort of true. Historically he hadn't been very good at keeping out of the media's searchlight, though it wasn't for lack of trying. They had probably just been lucky. Lucky that it had been a quiet break up, that neither of them had found other people in the time after, that they had enough friends in common that they had still been seen together fairly often. That last part had been a bit weird too of course. Thankfully, their friends had known how to keep their mouths shut about it, but when all his friends were Ginny's friends too it was hard to really talk to any of them about it. And he couldn't talk to Ron either, obviously, and Hermione would probably feel awkward about it too, so he just didn't bring it up.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
He shrugged.
!” Harry cried, and the red light caught the auror in the chest and threw him back against the wall.
Fucking Potter had looked absolutely perfect when they met - a bit ruffled, a bit awkward, his hair had been an awful mess, but somehow that had just added to the square-jawed heroism of his overall appearance, that he could be that careless and still look that good.
He didn’t recognize the neat handwriting and it seemed such an odd message to receive from anyone at Hogwarts, let alone Draco Malfoy, that it actually took him a few seconds to figure out whose initials they were.
Quidditch was one of the great things about being back at Hogwarts. Most of the Gryffindor players had had their quidditch-privilege revoked last year, but everyone had been catching up over the summer and by now the team was getting really good. Harry felt lighter and happier as he walked back up to Gryffindor tower after practice. He had hurried to leave the locker-room afterwards and had pretended not to notice Ron’s questioning look when he left. It felt like the pleasant lightness would be disturbed if he had hung around to listen to the noise and chatter of his teammates.
The second time it happens is in the quidditch changing rooms. Harry has been out flying and when he comes back, Draco is there getting changed, about to go out. For a couple of seconds, it’s quiet and awkward, the two of them staring at each other, alone together for the first time since the incident. And then Draco starts saying shit. And Harry pushes him up against the lockers, and maybe he hadn’t meant to kiss him, but he does. Draco tries to lean forward, but every time Harry slams him back against the lockers, and he likes the noise and he likes how it feels like a fight. Then Draco reaches for his trousers again and puts a hand on Harry’s chest, and Harry lets himself be pushed gently back so Draco has enough space to get to his knees.
“But it should be quite obvious. The actual Death Eaters were either as mad as Bellatrix Lestrange, or they were desperately old fashioned and pathetically naïve about the Dark Lord’s intentions,” Blaise continued, now looking directly at Draco.
Potter shrugged.
Harry looked back at him. The look on Malfoy’s face was urgent. He cast a quick glance around like he was embarrassed that he had called out so loudly.
“What did you fight about?”
“What is it you think I know?”
,” Draco said.
“You’d punch him in the face if he tried.”
Draco shrugged.
Harry shrugged.
There was another sound. It could have been someone moving about up in the guards’ room. It could have been the wind outside. It could have been a door opening or someone coming down the stairs after them. Draco gripped his wand tighter.
“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she says, and then she is kissing him, and Harry is kissing her back, and for a moment she is the only thing in the world, and everything seems alright.
“It’s not a big deal, just a minor set back. And it was humiliating.”
“Sure,” he said. “I’ll start calling you Harry as soon as you start calling me Draco. See you Monday,
“Seriously?” asked Ron, looking almost betrayed.
Malfoy opened his eyes and looked at him with a smirk like he had guessed exactly what was going on in Harry’s mind.
“That’s nice,” he said.
” he cried, taking a quick step back.
impossible? Here I am, graciously supporting your death wish, and then you don’t even thank me?”
“And when I tell you that I’m proud of you, I want you to know that I’m referring to this year as well as every one that came before it. Don’t think I haven’t noticed what you and your friends have done for the school this year. There were some things I thought even years of peace couldn’t mend, and to see the relationship between Gryffindor and Slytherin change so much in a single year has been nothing short of miraculous.”
“Alright,” he said and glanced back at Potter.
“Drink the whisky, Potter, I promise it’ll make all of this more bearable. And remember, this is not a condition. I’m still going to keep the promises I made you earlier, whether you accept my suggestion or not, but I also propose that we get to know each other. You don’t have to publicly declare anything about me, though of course if an incident does occur where we have to interact in front of others, I hope you will be civil with me. It won’t be public, but it’s also not going to be a secret.”
Harry nodded, the knot of guilt loosening, but the confusion lingered.
The atmosphere in the room was tense. Granger and Longbottom had greeted them with polite hello’s, Ronald had just nodded stiffly. Ginevra arrived later with the Lovegood girl, who floated in and glanced vaguely at them, but didn’t say anything. Draco didn’t know her well enough to say whether her strangeness became more pronounced when she was uncomfortable, but it seemed possible. Pansy had been vicious to her when they were younger, and even though Draco hadn’t had anything to do with her when she was kept at the manor, that episode probably didn’t make her like him any better.
Blaise watched him. There was something hesitant about his figure. Draco would have asked him to go away, except he wasn’t sure he wanted him to. He didn’t want to be alone.
for any part of it, who would never be able to understand… he wasn't sure he could do that.
“I just said it wouldn’t be the same thing,” said Harry, trying not to sound annoyed. “You make it sound like we did something wrong when we started it.”
"No one's here."
Harry was laughing again, overjoyed with flight, rushed with adrenaline, it sounded maniacal even to his own ears, but he couldn’t have cared less.
Time dragged by and Draco was no closer to falling asleep. He had taken off his school robes and tie, feeling suddenly silly for wearing those in the middle of the night. He sat down again in just his shirt and trousers.
“But I also… You’re not right about all of it,” he said. “I don’t think it’s as hopeless as you’re making it sound, and I just think… I want to believe that we’re allowed to be more than our houses. I’m a Slytherin, I still am and I’m not forgetting what that means now, I promise. But that shouldn’t mean I can’t be anything else.”
“It’s not working.”
“Alright?”
Ron looked embarrassed.
“No, I’m doing fine.”
They walked together to the stairs leading from the dungeon to the upper levels of the castle. Neither of them said anything. They stopped by the steps and Harry turned to Malfoy.
It had started out good, when they'd first moved in. Ron had been helping out George and Lee with the jokeshop as much as possible, until he and Harry had joined the aurors. Hermione had been contacted by the Ministry about an internship the second she’d passed her Hogwarts exams. The three of them had moved in at Grimmauld Place and the routine of living like that had come easily. Everything had been surprisingly smooth for a while, surprisingly normal. Hermione had left for the Ministry ridiculously early in the morning and Harry and Ron had made their way to auror training at more reasonable hours. They’d taken turns shopping and cooking, joking about how it felt like they were pretending to be adults. They still did that, even though it didn’t feel much like pretending anymore. Harry still had nightmares, he still didn't sleep enough, but for a while he'd been pretty sure it was the same for Ron and Hermione. He'd figured they all just needed time.
