“If it’s Ron, tell him to fuck off,” Draco yelled back as he fought the urge to kick the frame of the portrait. The only reason he didn’t was because it was imported from Greece and it was
Lovegood cleared her throat, causing them both to peer at her curiously. “Are you alright? You seemed tense when talking to those girls.”
As the sunset of the night left and lanterns light up outside, they knew their date was coming to a close.
“Uh-huh,” Ron said, eyebrow arched and tone doubtful. “Is that why when he came into the breakroom last week you clammed up and looked seconds away from lunging at him?”
“It’s for the celebration,” Blaise said as he hugged them briefly despite being still wrapped together. “Hermione let us use some kind of Muggle burners, Ron’s got food cooking.”
Draco shook his head as he placed a hand over the one still touching his cheek. “Sirius’ love. Before, I had nothing serious for love when developing him. Not a single person that I talked to ever mentioned any serious relationships he had, and
Blaise didn’t look at him, his eyes were on the fireplace and his lips were curved in a soft smile. “Yeah,” he whispered. “I do.”
“I’m sorry, it’s just, do you honestly think that Lancashire of all teams will win? They have been performing horribly all season. Not to mention the Portrees are 5th in the league. They don’t even have to
“Is that—” Potter bit his lip, eyes glancing up at Draco hesitantly. “Is that why Sirius had never gone mad in Azkaban?”
Harry didn’t understand it fully but as he apparated away, he was confident that Ron and Hermione would arrive as well.
Broken swings, bent monkey bars, seesaw cut in half and a carousel off the track upside down. To others it might seem sad, to see a once lively park destroyed, but to Harry that was the whole point.
One of Draco’s eyes closed. “My father doesn’t like to talk about his past much. Rarely brings up the Dark Lord but I don’t think he was too bothered with how it ended.”
“What’s the difference between the two?” The flipping of a page taunted him, and he really hated the damn thing.
Draco’s hands stilled as he looked at Potter curiously. It was hard not to look down or revel in the naked glory that Potter was, but he resisted.
“No,” Harry said, tone firm and hard. “You’re going to leave the forest and you’re going to live out the rest of your life. Maybe even find someone else.”
Ron’s grin grew bigger before he smirked at Draco, as if he knew something Draco didn’t—the annoying git.
They stared at each other for a long time before Amos looked behind him towards Cedric. Draco wasn’t sure if he just wanted support, or if Cedric helped in the decision process.
Harry tilted his head. He had never paused to think what others would use when discussing him. He figured they all thought similarly to the Daily Prophet article, assumed they thought he was just another Dark Wizard.
“There was no correlation,” Harry continued, ignoring Draco completely. “He’s gone by now. No way he stuck around after you pulled all the records, there had to have been plans set up to be on the lookout.”
“And not only that, but can you fathom what kind of position you put Lupin in. If he had harmed Snape while as a werewolf you would have caused him to be removed by the Ministry and potentially locked away. You took his condition and used it for your own selfish reasons. The guilt would have torn him apart, and I think we both know that.”
He couldn’t tell if Draco really meant that or it was just teasing. Either way, Harry felt his cheeks grow warm.
“As long as I’m beside you and not behind.” Draco was no follower, never one to listen to other people well.
“No one cared about the lives of criminals.” It was the sad truth, and Draco couldn’t deny that. “There were movements, but it wasn’t until things became more progressive that changes were implemented.”
“You are an absolute tosser, a piece of rubbish not worth the bin I’d have to place you in, and I’d rather kill you then help you but not everyone gets what they want in life, right?”
colours there, a lot of red, that much he could discern. But there was a mix that was hard to tell with how blurry it all was. The aura moved quickly, reminding him of when someone lied. But that didn’t make sense. The man wasn’t saying anything to have lied.
cleaning charms on them. It wasn’t as good as a bath, but he was too tired for that. “I think it’s the other way around.”
“Does it look like I care?” Thestral stared at the man as he finished off the rest of the drink, one brow quirked and an eerie smile on his face.
“I can hear you thinking from here.” A drawling voice had Harry peering over at a boy close to his own age. Harry must have been angrier than he realized if he had walked in and missed
Small nibbles that turned into harsh bites, pecks that turned into more—deep sucking kisses that lit Harry’s stomach on fire.
“Life,” Potter shrugged. “Sirius was always so full of life, even when upset, angry or disappointed. Even at 13 I wanted to know more, badly enough that I let him tell his side of the story and that was enough for me.”
“Another time.” Harry pushed two fingers past his rim, eyes closing and mouth parting. He almost wished Malfoy was going to fuck him, but Harry really wanted the dildo.
The silence that followed was a bit awkward and he knew it was his fault, but wasn’t bothered enough to fix it. Harry knew his friends cared, but caring wasn’t what he wanted. Caring was just a reminder.
“When I was in Hogwarts, History of Magic was boring, useless and never presented in a way that was easy for the children to understand.”
“Well we did get married,” Hermione said quietly, a pink hue staining her cheeks. “We realised after a year that we wanted different things. We married so young. We were 18 and thought we knew everything.”
“There was a funeral?” Draco didn’t understand. “I know she didn’t die because Hemlock sent me to break up a Werewolf rebellion a year after I died.”
Draco was captivated. He had never known someone like that, never seen anyone with such a personality. He frowned at his notebook and he wished for the millionth time that he could have known his cousin, even briefly.
With that, Minerva stood up and walked away without a single glance back. The sound of Sirius crying could be heard over the sound of her heels as the memory faded.
Harry pulled at a loose thread on his trousers. It reminded him of the case, a loose thread with nothing to link it to.
A splash of water greeted him when the next memory started. The Black Lake. He looked around and caught sight of Lupin and Sirius skipping rocks into the lake.
When he looked to Draco he wasn’t as surprised as he should have been to see a hungry expression that bordered on greedy. He curled one finger, beckoning Draco closer.
“I have three small stones and I will drop them one at a time in the water. I want you to not only observe the path of the stone, the path the water takes as they meet, but I also want you to observe the water itself.”
“You’ll what?” Harry asked, eyes wide and tone filled with faux shock. “I’m not the innocent people you harm on the daily. I’m not going to just take your shit. You don’t scare me, nor have you ever come close. I see right through you, and Merlin it’s an ugly sight.”
had him smiling too if it wasn’t for Nott slamming his hand on the table, startling several people, including them.
“A break might help,” Blaise offered, and he could he hear the twinge of desperation in the plea, but it wasn’t enough. “You could use—”
Harry let his eyes close as he took a deep inhale, let Lucius’ essence enter his body and wrap around his lungs.
Draco frowned briefly before he ignored the interruption. “—and Sirius is the next piece I’m working on.”
“I wanted to,” Potter promised and for whatever reason, his eyes were on Draco’s and there was an intensity there that he didn’t get.
The Magic that needed to be reapplied, a single core not enough to maintain it. The similarities between the door in the Department of Ministries, the spider web of Magic that
“What does it matter? He doesn’t have a chance, not with the Tornadoes being 7th in the league. They are one spot away from being knocked off. The ENB hasn’t taken someone lower than 5th in decades.”
“They should be,” Draco declared haughtily, running a finger along the glass once before turning around and heading out of the room.
Perhaps the most frustrating thing about humans was the inability to control them. It didn’t matter that Harry was having a complex, didn’t matter that he was drowning in his emotions, struggling to come to grips with the idea of Draco.
“Opened the containment void and let the explosion enter there. Next time that opens it’ll be a bloody disaster. Probably nuclear bomb levels of destruction.”
Because, yes, Malfoy’s kitten disliked anyone speaking negatively of others. Which was honestly ironic considering the cat
“I don’t want to be a saviour.” Potter’s eyes were glassy. “I just want to be me, and I want you to be able to be there next to me.”
The urge to look intensified but he refused to give Harry the satisfaction. He wasn’t sure how Harry knew, but he didn’t care, not when lips moved lower and lower until they were right where he wanted them.
That was a big word, one filled with way more responsibility than he was prepared for. Harry was only 16! He didn’t know what to do with a courtship. Did he even want that?
“Upstairs.” Draco waved a hand towards the door, and the sound of it locking was loud. “You might need to carry me.”
“Thank you, Harry. That means a lot.” There was a small satisfied smile on Dean’s face. No matter how revered Dean’s work became, he’d always be humble, and Harry loved that about him.
“Can we move this along?” Dean talked over whatever comeback Seamus came up with. “I don’t have any naps scheduled but I do have to be at the museum later.”
“How did you meet each other?” One of the twins asked, confusion on his face and in his aura. Someone in the makeshift arena that had been set up was going over a list of rules for the contestants, but no one paid them any mind.
Nott licked his lips nervously as his eyes looked around the room. “I thought you’d grow to love me as I love you. I thought you showed your love in different ways. I thought—”
“If Potter is coming back for the ball, who do you think will be his date?” Abbott asked as Draco sighed heavily, a few seats away from her in History of Magic.
“Oi!” Ron kicked him in the shin. When Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, his shoulders slumped. “Okay, I was going to tell you but—wait, why is it my fault Harry didn’t tell you?”
“Several of them,” she replied, curiosity making her nose scrunch up. “Are you writing something? An autobiography? Because if so, I hate to break it to you, but your life is too depressing to be put on paper.”
“I promise.” Relief filled him, and he scrambled to get up. He knew where the attic was and didn’t wait for instructions before he pulled the hatch down and climbed up.
The painting was still shaking his head, hands folded across his chest accompanied with a harsh sneer.
Sirius gasped as he covered his heart with his hand dramatically. “You wound me, I shall never recover from this betrayal.”
“My home is you, Harry. Whether you choose to stay or experience something new, either is okay, because I have you.”
“I told him the Thestrals don’t judge those who can see them. That despite seeing death, the Thestrals aren’t something to be upset over.”
That made things significantly harder for Draco, and he knew he’d have to talk to Potter at some point, but he didn’t want to.
Muggle things weren’t that complicated. If Potter could master them, then so could Draco. Refrigerators were a godsend and whoever invented the telly was a genius. He had figured out the function of a light bulb instantly, it was the electricity itself that he still hadn’t fully grasped. Where did it come from?
He had always had an intuition when came to people. With Muggles it was easier to write off. Just a lucky guess, he used to tell himself. But when he came across wizards, it was obvious that they were different, that something wasn’t quite right.
Draco’s fingers tapped against his leg restlessly as he tried to tune Potter out. If he didn’t listen, then it wouldn’t affect him.
He had been played. Draco slammed the side of his hand against the wall of the passage and swore at both the situation and the pain it caused.
Merlin, that wasn’t smart. It really wasn’t, but why did the mere thought make him harder than he was before?
Draco gestured around the room. “Because this a catacomb, at least by a Muggle definition. They considered them ritual burial grounds. Mazes of tombs that sometimes held traps.”
A little baby that was undeniably himself sat on Sirius’ lap as James chased a tabby cat around the house while Lily watched fondly.
A chorus of ‘Thank you’ echoed around the room. Harry had to try twice to clear his throat, but he couldn’t.
With a deep exhale, Draco sealed his studio closed with wards, quarantined the room and decompressed all magical residue in the air before he pulled out a blank canvas.
“Yes,” Draco agreed with a shrug. “The injustice will never leave. Sirius died before his time, he was too young and still had a lot of life in him. His death is an injustice, and no amount of time will ever make that disappear.”
Odd jars filled with floating body parts on shelves were a bit disturbing, but he was entirely fascinated by them. Were they victims? Odd strangers that happened to enter their house? Or was it something that they had bought from a shady dealer as a decoration piece? He kind of wanted to take one with him.
Humans liked to surround themselves with others like them, shared experiences and all. Perhaps he was just being human…
Sirius paused, one hand on the table as his arse was poised over a chair mid movement to sit down. “Pardon?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Seamus’ voice was higher pitched at the end and the outrage might have been humorous another time.
“But—” Potter frowned as the hand that had been on his own reached up to place a stray strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “
. His tongue licked his lips on instinct as the heady buzz of the silencing charm fell and all that remained was Magical residue. Dark Magic was his favourite kind of Magic, but there was something special about Potter’s. Something sinister under the surface that always tasted just right.
When the running grew the loudest before tapering off, Harry squared his shoulders and turned to face the intruders.
“You thought about my mouth, but what about yours?” Malfoy asked as he began to move his fingers in and out of Harry’s mouth. “Did you want to suck my cock too?”
If such a thing as a creator existed, Draco wanted to pray to it to ensure that at the very least, he could walk out of Gringotts without having to see their lead Curse-Breaker and resident twat: Harry Potter.
“Shut up, Parkinson,” Blaise sneered as he leaned against the wall, clearly still winded by the crooked way he stood.
As his magic settled in preparation for sleep, it was obvious that it was less than it had been before, but it was still there, still standing.
Nervous wasn’t much of a tell. The temptation to take some of Snape’s soul was pretty strong, but that would have to wait. There was only enough time for a whiff, and it wouldn’t be Snape’s that he took.
“No, thanks,” Harry said in a rush when it looked like she might move forward. “I’m here to see your boss.”
Harry glanced at Sirius. “I told you, the Minister asked for Dementors to protect him.” He had seen their path, knew where they were and how to find them.
The anger had been replaced by a brief flash of hurt, but Draco couldn’t take it back, couldn’t fix what wasn’t a lie.
“It just doesn’t make any sense,” Hermione exploded, hands moving to emphasis her words. “If they were real people would have seen them, there would be books about them that dealt in facts and not just suspicion.”
“But not tonight,” Malfoy finished as he started to kiss his clavicle, tongue following each press of his lips before light marks were sucked into Harry’s skin.
Draco spared a minuscule moment of guilt as Abbott sounded positively miserable. But it was for the best. He knew how this would end. And
Parents that didn’t get along, the fights Lupin was forced to listen to through his bedroom, being bitten—an act that ended a marriage. Mind-numbing pain endured once a month only for the mind-numbing emotional scars as society pushed a villainous status on his kind.
As confident that he was in their mating, it wasn’t guaranteed that Harry would live as long as him.
“When the Life Magic takes me, I need you to put the stone in the containment void, and then you have to get the fuck out of here.”
Harry hummed as he tilted his head side to side a few times. “Sure, it’s not against the rules. Sure, the league can’t do anything about it. Sure, your team is still in and the Tornadoes are still out. But you know what I can do?”
Draco ran his tongue along the edges of his fangs. They had elongated on their own in his excitement. Killian deserved
“I’ll work on it,” Harry looked at Luna, but he was really talking to the both of them. “It’s all I can offer.”
Malfoy harrumphed, but gestured them forward with his hand. “Finnigan, you first, followed by Longbottom. Thomas and Weasley, you go in together next. Harry and I will take the rear.”
When he opened his eyes, he was met with a tilted head. The creature had stopped taking from him. He was pretty sure he was being observed just as he had done. The grip on him lessened until he was placed on the ground far gentler than he had anticipated.
“I thought we could look at the inspection vault where the stone first disappeared from.” Not a bad idea. It would give them a chance to see if there were any lingering traces of magic.
Sirius looked up and his eyes were unreadable, Lupin matched the stare and Draco wished he knew either of them enough to decipher any of it.
“In fact, I’m pretty sure I almost died right there,” Harry pointed to the spot underneath a new chandelier. “Almost died on those steps too, and I might have bled over there on the ground.”
When Harry started to move, hips going at a fast pace, Draco threw his head back as his mouth parted in silent pleasure.
“Fake couple of the year, huh?” Malfoy teased and the smile in his voice was just as present as the one Harry could feel on his skin.
“They used him as a test subject?” Dolores’ tone was horrified as she looked at Sirius with soft eyes. “I hope you spoke with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement as well. Animal abuse cannot be tolerated.”
“Please what?” Malfoy’s nose rubbed against Harry’s cheek before he pressed a kiss to the corner of his lips. “What is it you want?”
Teasing would have been his go to, but his cock ached too much to keep teasing. He pulled Malfoy closer to the edge of the counter before guiding his cock right where he wanted it. More kisses were placed on pale skin as the head of his cock pressed against Malfoy’s hole.
“I don’t know,” Malfoy whispered, voice barely audible with his lips still against Harry’s skin. “I just think you should.”
“And you think that makes it okay?” Harry asked, eyes narrowed, watching the way he squirmed. “House Elves were
It still bothered him. What had Dumbledore been thinking keeping a thing like that in a school? A school where children resided. If the stone had needed replenishing, what would have happened to the kids? Would they have started disappearing too? Had Dumbledore’s mission in getting rid of the Dark Lord clouded his morality? Was the risk of a few kids the price to pay for the rest of society? Did Dumbledore risk potential deaths as long as the Dark Lord died too?
“Maybe I left it in the till?” Draco mumbled to himself. That would explain why he hadn’t seen it; not like he had a customer any time soon.
“Explain.” Draco was sick of not being in the loop. Weren’t mates supposed to share secrets with each other? Not that he had ever followed that, but someone as morally righteous as Harry should have.
“For what it’s worth,” Potter began, hands moving restlessly as he sat up straight, wand twirling between long fingers. “I did believe you. It’s hard to get Goblins to do anything wizards want. With nothing tangible to show them, nothing would have happened.”
“Sure,” Potter agreed easily. “But the books themselves were incomplete and missing so much. History is always written by the victors and it shouldn’t be that way. So much is left out, so much so that I could fill a dozen books and still have things left over.”
When the pain lessened enough that he could blink open his eyes and all that remained was a dull ache in his head, Harry sat up to the sound of someone talking.
Potter looked nothing like Draco remembered, didn’t look like the boy who had won a war, didn’t look like the teenager that walked away from everything, and he certainly didn’t look like the rumours people gossiped about. Potter was taller than Draco remembered, his hair was long and tied into a bun, his glasses had been replaced by ones that framed his face and weren’t too large. Potter held himself rigidly but that could’ve been the situation itself. The beard that shaped Potter’s jaw was prominent and it was probably the one thing Draco was shocked about the most.
“The horns and scaly body make it difficult for spells to penetrate, as with all dragons, but Hungarian Horntail in particular. It’s a defense mechanism.”
“You act like it will be easy,” Murphy said with a nod at Jackson. “You’ve already looked through the books in the library and came up with nothing.”
Before Harry could say that, Draco leaned forward and kissed him. Gentle, barely-there pressure and over far too quickly.
“Malfoy,” Potter whimpered and there was so much sorrow in his voice that Draco already knew what he’d say.
“Control yourself!” George ordered, shaking Fred’s shoulders harshly. “This isn’t the end of the world. We can make a comeback.”
The atmosphere around them grew cold and Draco tried not to shiver at the pure rage emitting off Potter. Waves of anger that had him sitting up straighter. He wanted to look at Potter’s magic, wanted to see if it was moving angrily too, but he was locked in a stare that felt like a battle. One he didn’t want to lose.
Indignation clawed at Harry’s skin and he bristled angrily. “No. I will have you know that I sent Carrow to the hospital. The bloody idiot just attacks anyone who appears to be weaker than him.”
“Alright.” The whisper was louder than it should have been, but Harry didn’t mind, not when he was comfortable—well, as comfortable as one could be stretched over a bar stool and half on top of someone else.
Harry sat back with a surprised, ‘oof’. He ignored the insult entirely. “Is this recent? I haven’t heard anything in the papers.”
It was fascinating. Potter didn’t know Dark Magic, but yet he still saw the world differently. Draco wanted to know what else he saw, wanted to know what the world looked like through his eyes. Would it be just as beautiful, just as scary?
When Draco Flooed into Blaise’s house, he could hear laughter and the sounds of their combined enjoyment would always improve his day.
Harry has spent the past thirteen years grieving for Sirius, he has spent every day missing him. Harry actually
“Why do you think that?” Draco asked as they were ushered into a dirty kitchen that hadn’t been cleaned in decades. There was Magic in the kitchen too, which led Harry to believe there was Magic in every room that had never left. When a tendril reached out to him, he frowned only to realize that it
Harry startled enough that his foot slipped, and his trainers splashed into the shore and the marble almost fell out of his hands.
“I don’t know why you test people so much,” Harry said, pulling him closer. “It’ll backfire one day.”
“You really don’t know the charm you have over me?” Draco mumbled as he picked up his robes off the ground. The trousers weren’t important, but the
“I’m glad my embarrassment amuses you,” he drawled, glaring when several Goblins’ mouths widened enough for their jagged teeth to poke through.
There was a ghost of a smile on her lips. “Pansy always knew she had to maintain her status. There had been talks of who she would marry. I know her mother wanted a union with the Nott family.”
“Just because you’re a tool doesn’t mean I am too. You had him and lost him, and that makes you a joke.”
“I’m not sure,” Harry finally answered after several long uncomfortable moments. “There are times I think I hate you, and then there are times when I wonder why it has to be the present and why it can’t be four months ago when I loved you so strongly.”
It was flashes and gaps missing, but the gist of it was, “We were in a vault and I told you to leave.”
Every time I post a new ficlet to Tumblr I think about how far behind I am on this one. gah. At this rate, the one I just finished won't be on here for forever. Lol, I'm going in order of completion. And this one is months behind today and yesterdays. *sighs* That's alright. It sends me back each time I re-edit it, and makes me all gooey to see them again.
Potter only nodded, words unnecessary, and Draco wondered if they were more similar than they thought. If Draco could see things, then maybe Potter could feel them.
Harry moaned, loving the way it brought curses and a snapping of hips. There was no denying how much Malfoy was enjoying himself and Harry let that fuel his own desires. He relaxed his jaw when Malfoy rubbed a thumb along his cheek. The dildo inside him had slowed down to a slow pace, one that was easy to ignore.
to fight a Troll, no thanks. It wasn’t the notoriety or the whispers or the attention he wanted either. Being infamous was a hell of a lot better than famous. The latter drew too many eyes.
“I hate you,” Ron whispered miserably, he ignored the sound of Harry scolding Draco. It wasn’t going to be of any use.
Harry shrugged. “In a lot of ways they didn’t, but I was league behinds in everyday Wizardology and the way things were run. Everyone might have been on even ground when it came to spells and the basics of them, but I didn’t know the history of the world I was entering. I didn’t know the fundamentals of their society at all. And Hogwarts doesn’t teach you that, it’s something you learn on your own.”
Brown sat down across from him, gesturing for Declan to do the same. “You expect me to believe that? Why would Harry send you? I can’t imagine he can tolerate you.”
“Leon's body was found stuffed in a Boggart Cupboard, naked by the way, in a destroyed building in the middle of a Muggle forest in Scotland and you’re trying to say it was an accidental death?”
Harry stood up and moved toward the fireplace. “His last journal entry mentioned that he wanted to quit going to her. It said she didn’t understand about his need to change and talk to those he has hurt in the past.”
A weak chuckle left Draco and he opened his eyes to see a softness to Harry’s eyes that reminded him of the way Lupin looked at Sirius and he hated that his emotions got to him again as tears formed.
When Malfoy realised who it was on the other end, he froze a few feet from the counter, mouth parting in a small, ‘oh’.
Potter’s arms dropped from Longbottom as he pulled out his wand and… remained immobile. Sirius’ body curved as it fell backward and through the veil on the dais. The laughter had disappeared in the last seconds and all that remained was peace, and even as Draco’s eyes stung at the way Potter yelled Sirius’ name, he couldn’t help but wonder if it was the first time Sirius had been at peace since his escape from Azkaban.
Malfoy had several boxes in his hands that he passed off to an employee behind the bar. There was a small smile on his face, and Harry didn’t like that either. It didn’t look right on his face. Surely smiling pulled muscles for him.
As Draco stared at the happy boy who looked at the camera with wide eyes, he couldn’t help but wonder if Wormtail knew, if he knew that he didn’t truly care for his friends. How could one if they sold them out so easily?
“Erm.” Harry winced as he looked around to make sure no one was listening. “Professionally, I have no opinion.”
Harry waited patiently. Draco had been going to a mind healer and one of the things that had been suggested was for him to name 5 things that he liked about himself every day. Some days it was hard, and Draco was only able to list a few, but it was a start and Harry was proud of him.
Walking out of his shop—with a nearly healed ankle—next to Potter caused stares, he knew it would. Mrs Crooks winked at him and gave a thumbs up—senile old bat. The stares in Knockturn Alley were
There wasn’t a difference in the level of pain, but Draco trusted Potter enough to know that the stone was in the containment void.
“Sort of,” Goyle laughed. “He’ll tell me to eat, to drink water, to go to sleep. His orders now are always about my health.”
The energy that filled the room wasn’t his own—it was enough to have him relaxing and eyes heavy-lidded.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, chin resting on Harry’s shoulder. “They move randomly throughout the day.”
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” A lady dusting off some rugs in the doorway of a storefront. “The castle sure is a beauty.”
Draco opened his eyes before rolling them as Harry’s head rested on his chest. “I don’t know why you do that. My heart doesn’t beat anymore.”
Harry threw his hands out and a loud booming crash shook the ground. He couldn’t escape them. The memories kept pouring in.
Harry hadn’t been sure what would happen when the wards fell, but he hadn’t expected them to fall with a loud broken wail. The aching scream filled with a pain that he could feel in his bones.
“I’m curious,” Draco said, eyes on the mirrors they passed by, which showed Potter rolling his eyes. Prick.
Harry wasn’t sure what to think. Part of him was proud of Ron, but the rest was disgusted. The Aurors were
“I’m here for a lot of things,” Harry whispered, eyes moving from Barty to Fudge before settling on Dumbledore. “I want information from Barty about his Master. You see, I’ve got a bone to pick with Voldemort and I’d just
“It is,” Draco shrugged. “It’s something that takes practise. When people first realised that illusions harmed paintings, they moved onto portraits because then there was no need for an illusion. It took decades before any real improvement was done and that was
“I really do love the purple,” Draco said, fingers moving Harry’s bangs slightly. “Looks good on you.”
in parseltongue. The snakes weren’t the only ones who jerked. He left with a wink when Skrewt’s eyes widened and her mouth parted.
“That sounds like blackmail,” Declan leaned away from the table, face twisted in some kind of disgust.
Draco’s head was already shaking before he thought better of it. The crackdowns were whenever Potter wanted information and Draco ratted them out.
Draco’s fingers fidgeted, pulling at thread hanging loosely from his robe—a nervous habit he didn’t seem to be aware of.
“I always wanted some good in me.” The sarcasm was teasing in a way, and he didn’t think Malfoy could be so intriguing.
it. Shacklebolt might be a great Minister but the Minister is a figurehead. Rich men in power are the problem.
As Draco looked over the railing, mind not fully seeing the landscape as his distracted thoughts took over, part of him wished he did give a fuck. Because the person staring blankly at gaudy untrimmed hedges was a mess. A distinguished mess, sure, but a mess nonetheless—one he didn’t appreciate seeing echoed in his reflection when he could no longer hide from the lies that others believed so easily.
“I asked you first,” Harry countered before pressing his face against the bars, trying to subtly inhale.
Greed mixed in with power was dangerous, but Harry didn’t think Wizards had the morale to win a war. Could they band together long enough to put up a fight? Would the Light and Dark Wizards put aside their differences?
“I’d say you must tell all your patrons that but uh,” Harry grimaced as he looked around at the men still fighting to get closer to the girls. “You might have bad taste if that was the case.”
As Draco looked around the room, he eyes widened at how the Weasleys had utilised the limited space they had. Pictures hung on the wall, nearly every available surface covered as well. The Manor had paintings, but never photos, that was too personal, that would have suggested they were a family. Small happy children waved in each photo and Draco could see a little Ron happily chasing an older sibling. It was easy to spot which ones were new additions as he could see Fleur holding a little boy while a girl who looked just like her ran around the room. From every surface, he could see the love they had for each other so clearly.
“Wait!” Ron pointed a finger at him. “That’s why you always take forever. It’s never busy like you say, is it?”
“What was the war about?” It was a bit murky in the Dementors’ memories. They cared little what humans did as long as it didn’t affect them.
The Werewolves left in a flurry, dragging the woman on the ground with them, who was still thanking Harry. The Goblins left after them, dark sneers on their faces, but what else was new?
Lucius sent one more glare at Draco before facing Harry with a slight grimace. “Hogwarts employs House Elves, at least a hundred of them.”
The sound of dozens of glasses breaking preceded several screams as people tried to figure out the cause, but Draco didn’t have look to find the source.
“When I was imprisoned, the warden revoked my privileges to reply to letters. I could receive them, but not write back.”
“Excuse you.” A hand was placed one hip. “I will have you know that Divination takes patience, requires discipline and the craft has been passed down since the beginning of time.”
“Ha! Well, we aren’t dating!” There was a victorious gleam in Draco’s eyes. “She is completely wrong about that one.”
Baxter arched a brow, inching forward. “Rogers doesn’t care about the poor. She takes office in a few days. Since Robinson was fired, the Wizengamot is of the belief that there are no more corrupt members left in their numbers. You get that petition drafted, Rogers will see to it that it gets passed.”
Harry straightened Draco’s tie before pecking his lips. “I gotta get back, I was supposed to bring Jackson some records an hour ago.”
Harry clenched his hands before he forced himself to relax. “That I’d be lucky to have him in any capacity.”
There was another grin pressed into Harry’s neck, and Harry couldn’t help but return Ron’s sentiment in his head.
“The trouble we can get into,” Draco whispered, there was an excitement to his voice that had Harry’s smile widening. “A King and a Wizard.”
“Alright,” Draco continued in the same tone as the whispers became far breathier. “I’ll help you catch a killer.”
“Our magic intertwined last night. At some point, we pushed our magic into each other at the same time.”
At the mention of Dark Magic, Potter stiffened and looked at the runes in disgust. Ah, ignorance seemed to be his only personality trait. How disappointing.
“I was hoping you’d offer more than that,” Harry said slowly, a hand gesturing toward her. “Who treasures me?”
Noise was all around him. Wading through it enough to make sense of it was hard, but he tried. Was someone talking to him?
Ambarella and Harry stared at each other for a long time—far too long. Draco wasn’t sure what it was about, Veelas were strange. He didn’t want to have to look at Hemlock at all, let alone do whatever the hell Harry was doing.
“There are varying degrees,” Harry said, hoping Ron wouldn’t look deeper. “Some smell worse than others. Some are tolerable while others make me want to vomit.”
“I don’t know if I can.” He wiped his nose on his sleeve and placed his chin on Blaise’s shoulder. “I’m at a dead end.”
“I haven’t looked at them yet, I wanted to know more about him first, so that it wouldn’t muddle my research. I’m already biased, and I need to be less involved to ensure accurate results. I’ll watch them before I begin painting and then give them back.”
the war he was cute, hot even but now? No way. Not with the disgusting mark on display. As if he is proud of being an ex-Death Eater. I’d die of shame if it was reversed.”
She was silent for a while, well past what seemed appropriate. He thought about changing the topic but before he could, Narcissa leaned forward.
Minerva cleared her throat and only Dumbledore looked up; Sirius’ eyes were still on Dumbledore, narrowed as they showed a contempt not many looked at Dumbledore with.
Draco winced, upset that he gave himself away so quickly. Honestly, it was rather pathetic how much Harry could weasel himself into his defenses. Marriage shouldn’t have softened him this badly.
“Malfoy,” Harry whispered as he turned on his side, to see Malfoy already staring at him. They were inches apart. “All night you’ve told me what you were thinking when you laid eyes on me, do it again.”
He tried not to laugh as Draco whined when Harry removed the duvet with a snap of his fingers.  The laugh quickly died in his throat at the sight of Draco naked. He wanted to explore the body laid out before him, but that would lead to distractions. Dildo first, restraints second, and then Draco was all his.
Draco shook his head. “Not once, and I stopped trying after a while, when I realised that my father was just like them, that he learned from his father and so forth. They were the examples and my father was the by-product. Despite that, they fascinated me. Not who they were but
“I want to give you the love you deserve,” Draco whispered, blinking rapidly, willing himself not to cry. “You deserve to hear it just as much as you give it. And I’m sorry I don’t do that.”
Harry looked up, eyes on the Dementors floating above them protectively. “Sometimes souls become unstable.”
Draco placed a finger against angry lips before shushing him. “As much as you hate your status and fame, you reap the benefits of it. The Ministry might sneer behind your back, but they treat you with a respect that the rest of us Magical Creatures don’t get. Wizards will revere you but shun us in the same breath.”
“It’s how they eat. They need souls to keep going. Which is why the Ministry is stupid. Confining their food to only little bits from prisoners will only end bad. They’re hungry, Potter. Eventually the hunger is going to get too much for them, and they’ll revolt.
“I may still not know all of my emotions, but I know what I want, I know that I want whatever mess that you are.”
Zabini’s hand stilled, champagne glass near his face as his now widened eyes looked around the room.
“They’ll take care of you,” Ron promised Nott right before two arms grabbed hold of him and they apparated out.
“Obviously,” drawled Draco. “Or I wouldn’t have spent years sending you gifts while you never gave anything back.”
“And you didn’t need us?” Ginevra asked. He wasn’t sure what to make of her tone. It wasn’t quite accusatory, but it was close.
“What prison did you work at prior?” Harry asked as he examined the parchments. Disappointment filled him at the
“Do you know how restrictive that is? Society sees me as someone who saved them, they see someone who can’t do any wrong and to them, I
“I know,” Draco said, hands coming up to move the tournament cup to the ground before pulling Potter into a firmer hug. He didn’t need to know the finer details, didn’t need a play by play. It was obvious what happened.
“Likewise,” Draco said, eyes watching the way Potter watched him. It was almost nostalgic in a way, and his mind flashed to simpler times, when it was glances, glares and narrowed eyes across the Great Hall.
Harry pushed the Dementors aside, letting his fingers linger on them, letting them feel his gratitude, even if they hadn’t needed to interfere.
“So, it’s what petty revenge?” Ron asked as he scooted closer to Neville. “You want to steal from Nott because he hurt you?”
“So I hear.” He knew she wanted a reaction, they all did, but he wasn’t stupid, and he certainly wasn’t as open as Lorian had been.
Looking around, Harry didn’t think it was that big. Bigger than Privet Drive, which was a modest home, but it was no Malfoy Manor either.
“Don’t give yourself a complex,” Lucius snorted. “Since I prefer to be alive and kicking, I’ll take your
“Shut up,” Draco said, ignoring the way Ron sat up straighter. “You’re smart, Hermione. You retain information in ways a lot of people wish they could. But have you ever stopped to wonder what happens if your information is wrong? What then? All that’s left is misinformation shrouded in a cloak of false pretenses aimed to educate the masses. That’s dangerous.”
Draco said through gritted teeth. “It doesn’t need to come in contact with anyone for things to start happening.”
Draco shrugged. “When the minority objects the majority, the odds are never in their favour. The status quo provides stability while also maintaining grief. Changing that opens things to the unknown.”
“If Snape told them that you’re the Azkaban Killer then they’re going to know it’s me with or without a cloak.”
That was kind of sweet. Harry looked down at his notes as he tried to wrap his mind around the mystery that made up Malfoy.
A snort and twitching lips had Harry trying not to smile. It was strange how at ease he was. The boy was weird, and Harry was still concerned with the massive amount of red in his aura, but he was still at ease.
“Azkaban was meant for criminals, not innocent people. Black didn’t belong here,” Kennedy whispered, and Draco couldn’t agree more. “Take a look at the walls.”
The lack of faith in his abilities wasn’t encouraging, but Draco couldn’t disprove the opinion. What kind of painter indeed.
“I’ve got you, little one.” The nose pressed against his cheek felt normal, no longer tiny. “It may take some getting used to.”
He expected a chuckle, a small laugh or just amusement in general. What he didn’t expect was the hold on his waist to tighten.
“I thought it suited you. Giving all you can plus some into helping others. How noble it is, how that Gryffindor trait never left. That’s when I wasn’t sure what was happening.”
Malfoy didn’t reply but he did wrap his lubed hand around Harry’s cock and the touch was enough that precome pooled at the tip.
“I agree,” Hermione said, fist on her palm. “I’ve never understood why Wizards treat a lot of Magical Creatures so poorly. Like House Elves for instance!”
Harry tugged Draco closer, wanting to feel more of him. “I don’t like people talking about you negatively.”
Hands travelled down to his cock that had softened slightly and stroked him back to full hardness. He couldn’t arch his back, not with the way Malfoy was sitting on him but his muscles tensed and the restraint of movement itself was a turn on. The things he’d let Malfoy do to him.
“If you think I am hurt by your petty words and ignorant attitude then you will be sorely disappointed. Trust is the foundation of our relationship. You can flaunt yourself right up to him and I won’t bat an eye. Because at the end of the day, he is with me. You can flirt, tease and even ogle him but it won’t change a thing. He is mine and I am his.” Draco paused for a moment as he looked between the two of them.
Fingers tapped the pole, and heels clinked against the ground as Malfoy walked around the pole slowly, eyes narrowed on Harry.
When he closed the door, he felt more than saw the magic seal the entrance back to what it had been. His eyes were still on the door when a muffled scream had him pulling out his wand as he spun around rapidly, prepared for a fight.
Draco was beginning to hate the way Potter spoke. Had he taken lessons with Lovegood? Was there a Uni lesson in ‘speaking in a mystical airhead but somehow intelligent manner’ that Draco had missed?
Harry watched Voldemort study Horcruxes, trick people into providing information and more importantly, he watched him
“Earlier you said you liked my eyes,” Malfoy began as his arse settled firmly on Harry’s lap. “Would you like to know what I first thought of when I laid eyes on you all those years ago in Madam Maulkins?”
is a tool that we can use to our advantage. We examine the path of the rocks and relate it to our own paths. It might not show you what you seek, but it will always give you an answer.”
There were a lot of things that Draco didn’t want to do, and sitting across from Hemlock in a dusty office topped the list.
Harry clenched his fists. “I don’t have time for this. I’m sure there’s a more tactful way of going about this but I don’t care.”
“He’s about this tall.” The hand demonstrating this came close to Potter’s own height. “Blonde hair slicked back with ungodly amounts of hair care product. Grey eyes that are sharp but kind if one knows what to look for. Soft lips that are usually in a sneer but say sweet things when one knows how to listen.”
“Where are the professors?” Lucius questioned through his Death Eater mask, snarling at a few people who remained in the halls. “All these kids left with no one to protect them?”
Draco walked to Harry’s chin before placing his hand on Harry’s nose in an attempt to boop it. “I’ll always be with you; you must know this.”
“Is this because I accused you? You have to know I wasn’t entirely serious. Sure, you could be behind it if you wanted to, but I don’t think you are.”
“I just have one question,” Harry said, holding up his hands when it looked like she was going to deny that too. “You told the Aurors that you think he might have run away on his own.”
“I know.” It was said so sadly and Harry regretted calling at all. “I got to get back to work, call me soon? Please. It’s been too long.”
“I want the best for you,” Malfoy said, voice cracking. “You deserve that much, deserve someone who matches what you offer. I get that it’s not me, and that’s okay.”
“Now that you are all here,” Malfoy clapped his hands together. “How about we continue with the plan?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “They do, to an extent. But the way you look at me, the way you move, the way you act is far more than desire. It’s something potent.”
Ron scratched the side of his head a few times as his lips pursed. “I’ve got a lot of questions about you.”
When Brown, Declan and Nayden hugged each other, Draco felt as if they were intruding and it was quite uncomfortable. He looked at Harry and mumbled, “You want to make out or something?”
There, on the dirty floor of the library, Draco had his first—second, third and too many to count—kiss. It lacked decorum—propriety be damned and yet; he wouldn’t change a single thing.
As Harry walked towards the centre of the room where Malfoy was on the floor and the students were fanned out in front of him, he became curious.
She huffed before sending him a look. “I recommended a vacation, he was always so stressed and cooped up in his flat. I told him that leaving the country might help some.”
Draco didn’t want to think about what she was like in her youth any more than he wanted to think about a younger version of his parents. Some things were best left unsaid.
Draco's journal was a lot. Emotional for sure and it showed his progression as a character. Ending it with a final entry seemed fitting to me. But again, don't fret, there is still an epilogue that will follow this. Even if there wasn't, I do think this chapter said a lot of what I wanted to end the story with. But then again, I am a sucker for epilogues and there's some shit I want to get into lmaoo. Excited for the epilogue but also sad to know that it'll be last one.
Harry stilled when he thought back to the Magic he had felt last time they were there. The familiarity of it.
Harry’s lids felt heavy and he knew it was a combination of too much magic in the air and Malfoy’s presence entirely.
“It’s not fair,” Draco said, voice quiet as he looked over Harry’s face. “You know more about me than I do you.”
When the door opened and Lucius Malfoy walked in, Harry didn’t just regret the decision, he regretted his entire life existence. Because surely, karma hated him.
Malfoy lowered his head, lips a breath away from the tip of his cock. “Mutual, Harry. You’ll get me.”
“I’m not a reporter, Minister Shacklebolt. This doesn’t get told to anyone, it’s only for my research.”
“No,” Harry closed his eyes tightly as he stepped further away from Draco towards the door. “I won’t. I refuse. I’m not going through this again.
Draco gave his full attention to the portrait, something he hadn’t done in days. He arched a brow when the cracks along the edges grew deeper. The life of the painting would end soon, and he still didn’t know
There was an odd tilt to Malfoy’s lips as he turned Harry’s hand over before frowning. “You’re hurt.”
“Do you want me to stop, Harry?” Malfoy grinned when Harry said nothing. Loud breathing could be heard, and he knew it was Bandit, the breath was hot on his arms, far too hot to be normal.
Potter was in his element. Posture rigid in a way that carried power, stance as firm as a control Draco hadn’t realized Potter had mastered was fully on display.
Harry shifted Malfoy so that he blocked the line of sight to Ron. Brave didn’t mean cowardness was always absent.
what I’m getting myself into. I have spent years with the comfort of undeniable certitude of the world around me. I know how things work, and then how they don’t. What I don’t understand is easily learned if given the inclination to change. Learning is the beauty of life, and my methods might be rigid and old, but they work for me. I don’t know how to turn that off, to go against everything I have ever been taught.”
Harry shifted from side to side, something the boy took notice of. How was he supposed to explain what he could see? He was pretty sure a, ‘Sorry to pry but you’re drowning in depression, and I don’t think you’re aware,’ would go over swimmingly.
“What was it you wouldn’t tell me when we had sex?” When Draco’s cheeks reddened further, he knew it wasn’t from the cold.
Harry’s eyes closed as a his Magic detected a particularly happy memory that had seeped into the park bench. It was pulling him in and who was he to say no to such a tempting snack?
“Don’t worry,” Gnat said, eyes glancing over Draco’s shoulder. “Standard procedure. Hasn’t been any mutations this side of the alley in at least a year.”
Fleur and Ginevra tried to muffle their laughter but not very well as it could be heard around the silent room.
Draco looked down at the ground as his brows furrowed and a frown formed. Potter was convincing, that much was clear, but he still felt as if something was missing, a key explanation. Why was Divination so complicated? The lack of factual evidence still got to him, it still left him uncomfortable.
Perhaps Jessie was right, but Harry didn’t think so. In the end, it didn’t really matter what his plan was or how it happened, the important thing was them and their relationship.
The longer they stared the more Draco released his scent. It was embarrassing to be so obvious, but he wasn’t brave enough to say what his body was already so willing to do for him.
The wards were persistent, not wanting to buckle but as with anything, once you add a little pressure, it’ll come down. Harry was powerful, but he’d need help if he was to tear them down.
“I don’t blame you,” Draco hedged, hands up when her grip on the knife tightened. “I wouldn’t be here if we weren’t desperate.”
Ron let out a hollow laugh. “It’s a slow process. Me being the chief was an unexpected help though. They are getting closer to making a case. There are so many of them under investigation, it’ll take a while.”
The chuckle wasn’t appreciated as Draco twisted around until he was lying the other way, with his head on Harry’s chest.
A second brow arched, and Harry sighed. Nosy git. He leaned back in the chair, feet resting on the desk; much to the horror of painting-Malfoy, who’s mouth parted, forehead wrinkled harshly, and an angry finger pointed at him.
“Is it always so loud?” The barely heard complaint caused Harry to smile as he pulled out his quill.
The sentiment was nice, but that was usually said by people who already had a lot. He wasn’t embarrassed, never had been, not when his situation was out of his control. Warning Potter was the least he could do.
The Department of Mysteries truly was fascinating. The Magic he encountered as he followed Lucius’ drew him in. He wanted to know more. Harry could spend years down there and still find something new.
Malfoy did grin at that and it was Harry’s favourite thing to see. “You’re the one who likes to sleuth, an expert if I remember our school years correctly.”
Malfoy smirked over the rim before he downed nearly all of it in one go. “No. I wanted a business, something that was mine, something my family had no claim over.”
Despite her demeanour, Leandra was frightened, he could tell. Her hands shook every few minutes and her eyes tried not to look at the crowd. A few people looked at her with kindness, while others openly jeered. It was clear the room was divided.
Dean cleared his throat. “I don’t care what he’s wearing, I just want to know why Malfoy called us here.”
Flashes of friendship, laughter, love, and family cycled through Harry’s mind. But the recurring person in each memory was a man who looked familiar. Not in the way Harry would have ever seen, but familiar in the way that he could see little pieces of himself in the features of the man in the memory.
legally take Sirius’ titles, property or money, otherwise, they would have to face the Goblins and they
It always amazed him how easily Ron could get him to cave with one stern look and a hint of disappointment.
Over two years ago, Harry confessed to having feelings for him, and back then, it was unwelcome. They were friends and that was
This one is kind of old. It's from when I first started my tumblr. I'm not sure how I missed it when adding to this.
Nott’s voice was barely heard over the sound of dozens of people talking at once. It was deafening and Harry felt as if they were the centre of attention even more than they were before.
“Did you ever truly think he could be killed?” Lucius asked, curiosity overtaking his tone, eyes on Sirius. “Your little group tried so hard and for what?”
“We’ll have to find out, together.” It was said like a question and Harry melted at how hesitant Draco still was.
“Hard but not impossible?” Draco asked in a vain attempt to keep the theory in his mind. Divination required such a deep thought process, one he wasn’t used to.
“That’s the hardest part,” Harry admitted. “Most of the time it doesn’t bother me, I can cycle through them fairly easy.”
Part of him was flattered, but the ramblings were proof that he wasn’t doing enough if nonsense came out. Draco renewed his efforts and increased the pace and pressure of his grip.
“Ah,” Malfoy lifted his head, eyes bright and wide. “That actually poses an interesting question. We are told in school that summoning charms summon what is already there, but they never specify how exactly that happens. Summoning water in areas there is none still works. So my theory is that it takes water from an existing area outside of the given perimeter.”
“Say it one more time and it might sink in,” Harry teased as he shrugged off Dean’s grasp. “I’ve got a date with Malfoy, yes.”
it to. He refused to look at Potter as he gripped the now hard cock with one of his hands and wrapped his mouth around the tip, only the tip. It wasn’t until he swirled the head several times that Potter grew impatient enough to urge Draco to do more.
“Because it’s a bad omen,” Luna said slowly, overemphasizing the words. He threw one of the cards that had landed at his feet at her.
It was clear that his mother considered friendship as a weakness and that spoke volumes to his own childhood.
“Did you lose a fight?” The boy gestured to Harry’s right cheek that was already bruising. Carrow had gotten in one clean shot before Harry had taken control.
The innocent expression on Malfoy’s face faded as Ron asked, “Isn’t it illegal to tamper with a patronus?”
“Oh.” A lady with long blue hair and kind eyes smiled at him. “I was hoping to buy some books from you.”
A loud blaring alarm boomed around them, and Draco wasn’t ashamed of the yell that spilled from his mouth.
“Your cock is thicker than I imagined,” Potter continued as he tightened his hold on Draco’s prick for a brief moment. “I can’t wait to taste it, feel the weight on my tongue.”
With a deep breath, Harry knocked on the door that led to the MLE department despite wanting to turn around and not come back.
him. Do you understand that? Do you understand the gravity of your actions? Even if Snape had survived, he would have been a werewolf. You
“Ah, there you go, now you’re getting it,” Draco said, pressing one more kiss to his nose before returning to Harry’s hair.
That was it. Ron had no patience left. What kind of karma did he have in life for this to be his reality? He had always been a decent wizard, stood up for others and made sure to be kind. Surely, that should have warranted him a pass to
“I can imagine,” he whispered, and he could. Life after the war wasn’t pleasant for anyone, no matter which side. But for those on the wrong side, life was hell. A deserved hell, but hell nonetheless.
He didn’t think she knew who he was, but that didn’t matter. Something was telling him it wouldn’t be a good idea if Dumbledore knew he was around. Dumbledore had been too involved in decisions that had nothing to do with him. Had too much of a hand in Harry’s life.
Must have been a lot of money, Draco mused. He couldn’t imagine a predicament bad enough to give up such a book.
“No, you don’t,” Draco argued. “Not all Dark Magic leaves a visible trace. Dark Magic isn’t all flashy like the Dark Lord made it out to be. The majority of it is subtle, barely detected but there, taking root and corrupting what’s left. You know
Draco glared at her over the top of the paperwork. “Finish signing up Gnat for a house special, will you?”
Ron’s fingers played with Draco’s hair at the back of his neck as he chuckled softly. “It would be the right thing to do.”
He really did hex him that time. Draco ignored the pained cry from Potter as he picked up the ruined painting and set it in the trash. Blaise would kill him over the frame, and he’d probably have to pay for it out of his own pocket, but he didn’t regret it. Not really.
“Perhaps you should save it for those who need it. Wilkins may have broken the rules, but did you see her use of the charm?”
“They were enlightening, breathtaking and stunning. I found what I was looking for.” Which Draco knew that his boyfriend had been hoping to find the wonder in the world that he had been lacking his whole life and himself in the process. “But I was missing something important.”
The painting winced and so did Harry. He truly didn’t have any good memories of Malfoy, and it was startling to see the same event through the eyes of someone else.
The irony of appreciating what he had before it was gone was not lost on him. He had taken his senses for granted and now he was wishing they would revert back. It was irreversible, the Healers had said. What good was magic if it couldn’t fix shit?
“Can we get back to the point?” Harry cleared his throat and held his hands up ready to block anything Malfoy could attempt.
A glance at Declan showed that he wasn’t listening either if his glazed eyes and drool on his lips was anything to go by.
Fingers were replaced with Malfoy’s cock and Harry widened his stance, breath leaving him when he was slowly entered.
“Who says he has to have a date?” Macmillan asked with a scoff. “I’m going stag and there’s nothing wrong with that.”
“Um,” Harry flushed before looking at the ground. “I wanted to get you a gift, but you could buy anything you want. So, I thought that I would make you something instead.”
“Any time,” Malfoy promised as his arms tightened his arms and the last thing Harry thought of as he fell asleep was that it was nice to be the one being held.
“Take out his source of income and there’s no one left to hire him,” Brown nodded, and this time she was
Lucius, and Sirius shks I don't even know what I think of them. They were barely in this chapter but they still make me laugh. Love them.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Your hypocrisy astounds me.” He paused by the entrance to his classroom and held open the door for the few students who had arrived early.
They both groaned at that. What was supposed to have been Draco Flooing before they were to meet Ron and Hermione for drinks ended up with Harry getting bent over the kitchen table. They ended up being two hours late.
Harry had always known Draco had a fascination with his magic, hard not to notice. He was going to give his boyfriend exactly what he wanted.
“Sentimental,” Harry corrected as he ducked down, grinning when Malfoy rushed to brace himself on the counter. “That’s a sentimental thing to say.”
Harry’s shoulders slumped. He’d have to hear that forever, wouldn’t he? He opened his mouth to tell them to shut up, but words escaped him when he caught sight of what surely was Hogwarts.
No one was behind the counter, but that wasn’t a surprise. Malfoy was the only employee outside of the department head who rarely helped sort anything. He rang the bell several times, knowing how obnoxious it came across.
With a lot of strength that would have disgusted who he had been emotionally even just a year ago, Draco moved across the room toward the balcony—ignoring everyone who made space to talk to him, knowing it would reach his mother come morning but he had long ago lost his will to give a fuck.
“Do you want to go to the Three Broomsticks for a pint?” It was the usual invitation, nothing out of the ordinary for their friendship and that was the problem. Draco didn’t want regular anymore, he wanted dates and romance, wanted to see Harry’s smile and know it was for him, wanted to see Harry and know that he was his.
When the folder was handed to him, Draco mindlessly flipped through the pages, eyes focused on the words,
“I can choose to use Divination. I can choose to look into the future. I can choose to change things if I desire. I can choose to do nothing and let nature run its course, or I can try something else. Divination is all about choices and how we use that information for our own decisions.
“I—” Harry scooted back at the look in Luna’s face, it was unnerving. “He doesn’t talk because he can’t.”
Hello! It's been about a week since my last mini update on Tumblr which means it's been even longer since the update for here, sorry about that! Half of this was beta'd by the beautiful Snortinglaughter. All mistakes are mine
Draco sighed as he looked away for a moment, not sure if he was disappointed or not with the lack of response. “He said that there was no way that he could come between you and I when we are
“Almost a year ago,” Parkinson whispered as she sat on top of a desk. Her eyes were on her hands that began to fiddle with her robes. “When we eloped, we took a long vacation away from here. Almost didn’t come back.”
The retort had Draco tilting his head back until it hit the door. Potter’s eyes held something dark amongst other things he couldn’t figure out. He had never been able to understand Potter, never able to get what made his mind work, and the chances of that changing were slim. Maybe Potter
“The spell makes it possible to turn a place into a secret. A Magical secret that is tied to the soul.”
He closed his eyes before placing his head on his knees. Every time he talked to Luna, he walked out feeling introspective. Harry was tired of looking within, tired of thinking about himself and tired of examining his emotions.
The warmth of Potter’s hand on his cheek was nice. Reminded him of the night before, and he wished he could go back to that, go back to when the only thing he had to worry about was money and things changing between them.
“Uh, just a second.” More pockets and nothing but spare pieces of parchment. “I could have sworn I put it in here last month.”
Which is why when the two were caught out of bounds attempting to duel each other, she knew it was time to reach out to the Scorpius' father. Hopefully, he could be the one to talk some sense into his son. Because detentions, docking points and extra homework was doing nothing. Scorpius was determined to keep up the animosity, as well as young Elizabeth. If she really did want to keep the peace, things needed to be straightened up around here.
“I missed you,” whispered Harry and that’s when Draco’s fingers clenched, and he closed his eyes tightly.
Perhaps he didn’t have the best family by blood, but who was to say that was the only family that mattered?
The grey spread until it was several splashes and that just amused him. He had never been responsible for someone else’s colours, it was dangerous in the way it could become addicting. Harry wanted to see what other colours he could cause.
Side note, please tell me you laughed at Bare Sorcery too. I can't be the only one. Whew, I crack myself up.
.” Malfoy looked up and the pleading in his eyes was just as visible as it had been in his voice. “Don’t patronize me, don’t lie to make me feel better. We both know that if Lancashire wins against Pride of Portree then we’ll be out of the running.”
Harry stepped closer until they were almost chest to chest, glass object being the only thing separating them.
It was a lie, he knew he needed Potter. There was no way he could do it without him, but Draco would be damned to let Potter think he controlled any of it.
“I love the smell of your perfume,” a lady said to the woman next to her. “I thought about making my own but I’ve never been good at that kind of thing.”
There wasn’t a smile on painting Malfoy’s face, but it wasn’t emotionless either; a step in the right direction.
Heartbreak wasn’t something Harry had ever seen until then. Watching love bleed black at the sight of Sirius only for it to be drowned in a deep dark red was beautiful to see.
It fell off the tongue quickly; a gut reaction to deflect from the glaringly obvious. He wasn’t fine and the only one who knew the truth was the same one who stared back at him in the bathroom mirror every morning.
Draco cut off when Harry marched toward him, eyes still intense. His mouth was still open, ready so say something, but nothing came out when warm hands cupped his cheeks.
His thoughts slowed the longer Malfoy was gone and by the time he returned, Harry was nearly asleep.
“Drizzle,” Draco hummed as the sound of his quill could be heard. “What would you say the diameter of the raindrops were? Larger than normal?”
“Ulnok, why are we going through the emergency entrance?” Potter asked as Ulnok’s hands touched the ground. The floor began to expand until there was a hole barely larger than a Goblin to fit.
Part of him wasn’t sure what that was, wasn’t sure what it was about Draco that drew him in and made him want to stay. But he was going to find out, he was going to give them both a love that they deserved and when Draco squeezed his fingers lightly, attention still on Hermione, Harry knew that Draco would do the same.
Draco couldn’t decide if it was ironic or sad that someone so powerful was afraid of a bloody Dementor.
“I know that, and you know that, but society doesn’t view it the same way. There will be those that think like us, but they are the minority and unfortunately, the majority is what speaks louder. I think Brown left to preserve who she had once been.”
Draco tilted his head back in surprise. An author? That hadn’t been what he expected at all. “But if you write history books, wouldn’t that be common knowledge? I haven’t heard anything about this.”
“I said that too.” Potter shook his head and dragged Draco towards the entrance Granger and Weasley were manning. Great.
“Potter,” Draco whispered, his tone a breathy hiss. “If you don’t get out of here, a blizzard will be the least of your worries.”
Draco fought against the hold enough to take in a ragged breath. Fuck, who knew Potter was so strong?
Harry took one last look at the building before he apparated away. The more answers he got, the less he felt like any of it made sense. Everything in his gut said Malfoy was in danger, but everything factually implied that he ran away.
“Diagon Alley would’ve made more sense,” Draco mused. “Your shop is right next door to a bookstore.”
“I don’t know how to be a parent but I will learn and as long as you know that I am trying, I think that is what matters the most. There is a fear inside of me that says no matter how hard I try, that I will end up like my father and that scares me.” Draco shook his head rapidly, his soft hair brushing up against Harry's stomach.
Clearly, Goyle wasn’t much of a talker, but that had always been the case—at least from what Harry could remember.
It wasn’t surprising that she was angry. Harry was too far away to know what they were arguing about but based off her partner’s emotions, he was pretty sure her anger was justified.
Harry allowed Malfoy’s self-confidence to fill him and he nodded his head firmly. “Right. We got this.”
“Sort of. When divining, you can’t only look to the future, you have to take in account for the present. The current state of events must be observed
“Not only were they enslaved but their language was stripped from them as punishments doled out if they spoke even a word of Gyrarr in the presence of a Wizard. It’s gotten to the point that younger House Elves don’t even know their own native tongue, forced to only speak what Wizards would understand.”
“Sounds like you all need some rules to abide by, to ensure you don’t anger the evil cat,” Luna sing-songed on her to put away a book.
“So were we!” Harry yelled, hand tightening around Fudge’s throat in his anger. “What of our children? What of the children that Wizards slaughtered? Is our loss not comparable? Is our loss not the same?”
“I want you to come after me.” It wasn’t a command, but the tone was just as powerful as if it had been one.
“Sounds like Hagrid,” Hermione said, a soft smile on her lips. “He always says dragons are misunderstood.”
“My Veela isn’t separate from me, I told you this hundreds of times.” Malfoy slammed his fist into his palm. “It’s not like a Werewolf that only makes its presence known during the full moon. My Veela
A lick to his hand startled Harry, his sneer melted into a scowl as he wiped slobber on the top of Sirius’ head. He never should have let him come, whether he was in animagus form or not.
closed around his nipple, he couldn’t help the loud keen that escaped him. Sometimes he liked to play with himself, but it wasn’t the same. Never could match the sensations.
“You didn’t answer my question.” The sneer in Coil’s voice held so much hatred that Harry would have welcomed one of Malfoy’s from their youth. At least that was just pettiness.
Fred let out an outraged noise and threw off George’s hands. “The title of Master Prankster. We took over the title from the Callum sisters three weeks into our first year. Not to mention held our ground when Flint thought he could challenge us during our second year.”
“If you think I am wrong for him, well, that’s your opinion. If you feel the need to voice this, then please tell it to the source.” That was what bothered him the most. It was easy to talk shite behind his back but only cowards do that.
“Sorry,” Ron said between low chuckles that quickly became guffaws. “You ran out last week because you got an erection?”
Wizard books didn’t really interest Harry much. He abandoned the library and instead moved on to a drawing room next door. The dusty space was not a surprise, nor was the weird movement in the couch that he was pretty sure was a Doxy infestation.
us anything we wouldn’t have to gossip about you,” Blaise retorted with a haughty tone that irked Draco’s ire further.
“Where did you come from?” Harry asked, fingers trailing above the portal but not touching. It was a stupid question, but he had been hoping there was even a sliver of a chance that he hadn’t done that. Because if he had done that, then Uncle Vernon lied.
“Technically, I didn’t break the rule,” Filius pressed on. “But now that you mention Harry, I hear he’s giving a lesson near the Black Lake.”
“Not exactly. Bellatrix was imprisoned, and Andromeda was disowned. With the premarital contract my parents signed, nothing from my paternal side could come forward in the marriage. I was discounted to inherit the title of Lord of the Black family.”
He already knew his morning was going to start out well, being with Malfoy in the shower would lead to needing another one. He let Malfoy go and watched him head to the bathroom, eyes on his red arse.
Draco shook his head, eyes on the fingers still touching Harry’s cheek. “He had some simple ones. But when I mentioned mine, the look he gave me was the same look my father gave me when I told him I was going to the Ministry to get emancipated. Disgust. That’s what he looked at me with.”
“Still,” Draco pressed. “A shield in itself would react to the elemental magic. I imagine an explosion of some kind happened.”
A hand rose to flatten his already flat hair, and it was kind of endearing. Draco wasn’t normally so nervous. The guy must have caught his attention, hard.
Draco’s brows furrowed when Harry pulled out. Before he could say anything, two fingers were shoved inside him.
“It’s a Sprite,” Harry said, eyes narrowing on Lucius. “If you aren’t careful, I’ll sick them on you.”
Draco didn’t know what the future held, didn’t know how the appeal would turn out, didn’t know how the rest of the community would take him being in a relationship with Harry. And whenever the public did find out about their mating, he didn’t know how that would go either.
The memories had been a lot to take in and his head swam with so much additional information that he almost didn’t realise the flashes bled into another memory.
“Like he cared about you?” Red saturated any of Sirius’ colours and it was intoxicating to realize how much he could change someone else’s emotions. “Left you in Azkaban to rot. Never once visited you. Never once asked your side of it. Never once—”
The longer Draco glared at Longbottom he wondered if he’d be able to manifest his magic into a stinging hex with just his eyes.
“Fuck.” That only made him go faster, deeper. Malfoy wasn’t allowed to do that and not expect a reaction.
“I’m not,” Seamus mumbled, eyes on Malfoy’s arse that was still perched on Harry’s lap. Neville reached over Dean to smack him on the back of the head.
“You really want to court me?” Harry asked, not entirely sure what it was about him that attracted Draco to him.
Harry didn’t doubt it, not with the way the temperature in the room spiked and Malfoy’s jaw tightened. It was chilling but way too amusing to back down.
Potter leaned down, his smile melting into something softer, and his were twinkling again. “I could always ride you.”
This was a prompt, they wanted me to do a ficlet on a song from my playlist. I'll wait till the end to tell you the song. Enjoy!
Harry watched Lucius lie through his teeth, managing to spin a wild story of a stray dog being on the wrong end of a group of rogue foreign Wizards.
Draco craned his neck to see the champion’s tent. Indecision was enough to have him biting his bottom lip. Reckless had never been a descriptor for himself. Potter? Absolutely, but never himself.
“Hold on,” Draco soothed as he shook the vial of residue close to the painting in the hopes that it was enough to calm Sirius down. Too much activity without any kind of finishing seals or protections could lead to a portrait corrupting or cracking. One last stroke and Draco put down his brush and took a step back.
What the fuck was wrong with him? What kind of father did that? If Lucius could be so callous over that, then what else had Malfoy suffered through? What other things did Lucius do to him for the sake of being the Malfoy heir? No wonder Malfoy didn’t want to forgive his parents. Some parents they were.
“I don’t understand.” Potter’s hands began to wring the duvet. “You’re the one who’s an expert in Dark Magic!”
Narrowed eyes were the only warning he got before he felt a pinch to his skin. Ahh, what a lovely reminder of their youth.
“I wish your riddles weren’t frustrating,” Harry joked to cover up the uneasiness that settled. He didn’t think she was talking about Malfoy at all.
“Well spotted,” Sirius said, shoulders tense. “I thought you might sense it. Welcome to number 12 Grimmauld place.”
“I know,” he whispered, both hands running along her scales as he moved closer to her head. “It’s not right, it’s not fair. They had no right to use you like that.”
Love. Was it as magical as Dumbledore said? Harry had never quite bought into that and when his heart had been shattered, it certainly hadn’t felt magical. Loving Draco, however,
Harry nodded as Malfoy wiggled again and dug deeper. A noise could be heard, and he wasn’t quite sure what it was. It sounded displeased but it
“It’s called preparation,” Harry argued, ignoring Sirius’ snort. “I have to prepare myself for human interaction.”
“I didn’t get jail time, but when the Ministry stripped me of my wealth, home and possessions, they also stripped my wand of its core.”
This is not the last chapter, so don't worry. I have more coming, no way I could end it like this. Let me know what you thought, and I'll be anxiously waiting for any input 😬 Until next time.
Each one meant something, and it had taken him days to figure them all out. The bottle caps had meant affection, rocks fell to fascination, the crumpled leaf was vitality and even the broken quill meant eagerness.
“Well.” Ron looked into the closet with a grimace that was probably supposed to be a grin. “This could be a silver lining.”
Draco looked over the top of the Daily Prophet, legs swinging back and forth on the desk he had claimed as his own. They were in an unused classroom down in the dungeons hiding from Peeves who thought it was funny to pester them any time they walked together.
Harry and Draco shared a look before glaring at Lucius. Next time, he’d be staying behind. Who needed him?
“Sirius was rarely seen without his friends. I don’t know if that was a flaw or done by design. His dependency on them was always obvious, even in the later years his duels were predominantly in defence of his friends.”
Once Potter had cleared the table and they were in the living room, Draco relaxed. Perhaps Potter’s bland home was comfortable after all. He looked around the room and tried to resist the urge to comment on the styling choices. When his eyes landed on a book on the end of the couch, his curiosity was too high to ignore.
wizards realised that portraits could remain after the person was deceased. There were a lot of problems due to the artist implementing only their magic into the portraits and
Harry had mourned, been mourning for years. But as he wiped his eyes one more time, he made a promise that it would be the
Of course that would happen, of course it would. “Is there anything you can tell me about the artist? Things you can tell from just looking?”
“Maybe you grew up.” Draco slid fingers in Potter’s hair and gripped tightly before forcing his head back.
“That’s exactly what we’re going to do,” Harry said, a slow smirk forming at how frustrated Sirius became. “I
Harry opened his mouth to ask what and who they were talking about but a bored, “Next,” pulled his attention to the line. He smiled in what he hoped looked apologetic as he approached the bouncer. She was… something, that’s for sure.
“No, that’s a different evil. I would say it’s a branch of Soul Magic. Not a Soul Bond, people tend to confuse the two.” Not that Potter would know anything about that.
as his neck cracked a little. Draco’s eyes were wide, his chest was heaving and he was focussed on Harry’s hand, the one that was resting on top of the letters Lucius gave him.
“I’m never alone,” argued Harry, one brow arched as he looked to Draco. “I once told you that what the Dementors know, I know. It’s true, but it goes both ways. We are one.”
When Harry held out a hand, the park grew dark; light dimming into nothing, and the air grew cold, chilly and all that was visible was their breath.
The only reason Harry went digging into the box he kept on his nightstand was because of how serious Draco sounded.
Ashwood folded her arms as she looked at him with narrowed and judgmental eyes. “An office. You want your own office?”
The sound of cameras going off intensified, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to care. Not when Draco nipped his bottom lip and a delightful tongue intertwined with his own. Kissing Draco was distracting enough that he didn’t care that they were in the atrium of the Ministry. He didn’t care that they were making a spectacle of themselves. All that mattered was the hands that were slowly making their way towards his arse and the deepening of the kiss.
Greyson laughed, and it sounded deranged to Harry. “You think I didn’t notice the way you’d look at him?”
Potter closed the book, set aside the parchment and Muggle technology, placed the quill behind his ear in a look that was reminiscent of Lovegood and then looked at Draco expectantly.
The more they kissed, the more he realised that it wasn’t just Potter’s groan that was addicting, it was
Blaise snorted into his cards and the sound accidentally set off a domino effect of explosions as each one blew up.
Giggling was the first thing that registered as the next memory began and he had to squint to see anything. It was dark, far darker than he expected.
Being an Auror had its ups and downs. Ups: He liked helping people. Downs: His boss, his coworkers, constantly fighting criminals—everything else.
Harry was good at tracking, definitely better than the majority of the Aurors. Being a P.I. with zero law enforcement help, meant he had to hone his skills and get good at some kind of tracking.
“I hated you in school, hated everything about you, even your looks. So why is it that all I could think about when I first saw you was how good you looked?”
“Aren’t you the one in charge of the sports articles?” Ron asked with a biscuit halfway to his mouth. “Shouldn’t you know everything about them?”
Their gazes were locked, but Harry was seeing through the eyes of the Dementors as they attacked the Wizards.
As they walked out of the lift, Draco swung their hands back and forth and the action was endearing enough that Harry felt less angry.
“They won’t tell me.” There was a smile on his face, and Draco wondered if there was a story behind that.
Harry closed his eyes as he took several deep breaths. It was his own fault. If he had just killed Sirius back in Azkaban, none of this would have happened.
“Even if you spin this false narrative, so what? There are no rules against throwing matches. The league can’t do a damn thing about it. Really, all you did was nothing.”
“I only know about him on the surface,” his mother continued, a slight frown on her face. “If you want to know more you’ll have to talk to those who knew him.”
There was no clean-up, no covering up the remains of the body, nothing to hide that someone had been there. The absence of something could be far more suspicious than the visible evidence.
Draco didn’t interact with Harry in public often. Once every few months, that was it. No way Killian detected anything then.
“I know enough,” whispered Harry, eyes still on Moody despite Snape speaking to him. Moody was panicking. Why would that be?
“You’re entertainment has arrived!” Seamus yelled as dust from the door breaking apart kicked into the air around him and Neville hesitantly went after him.
A smile against his lips had him falling harder and he wasn’t sure his mind could think of anything but Draco. His name echoed in Harry’s mind and he didn’t want it to stop.
As Harry stood in the entrance to a Dementor Den, hand in hand with Draco, he couldn’t help but be reminded of the scrawny five-year-old who only let desires exist as a horrible secret that only the night got to witness and never made it out come morning.
“That’s our final stop,” Lucius promised with a grave nod. “I’ve always been a firm believer in doing what is right. I couldn’t not step in.”
“Shh,” Potter whispered. “I could honestly listen to you talk all day, but right now I’d prefer if it wasn’t you complaining.”
“That you were working on a new painting.” She looked up from the cupboard she had opened and peered at him sternly. “I have to find out from my sister that you were doing a piece on Sirius.”
“So what?” Greyson shrugged, a broad grin stretched his lips and the sight made Harry want to punch him.
Harry shut the door on whatever Sirius was going to say, uninterested in those two, and unsure how he ended up with another idiot on his trip.
Draco looked down at the card and wondered if Potter meant that or if it was another joke. Either way, he pocketed the card.
“What about it?” Potter’s eyes were on his fingers, and it was obvious he didn’t really want to talk about it at all.
Draco laughed hollowly. “Of course you are. Why not shorten the stay? Wouldn’t want to restrain you to a life you so clearly hate.”
“I’m not in the right headspace.” It was hard to admit, but Ron had been right about his mental health and Draco couldn’t ignore it much longer. If he stayed in the studio reminded of his failures then nothing would change, nothing would get better.
“She taught me a lot,” Malfoy whispered as he watched Rosmerta fill several orders back to back easily. “I saw how much she puts into this place, the care, the love and seeing people give it back made me want that too.”
With the lingering magic still in the air, it made it hard for Draco to step away. Each drag of his feet was a struggle when all he wanted to do was stay.
“See?” Brown threw her hands in the air. “What is one person going to do? If we get involved it won’t end well.”
Goyle’s fists clenched. “You don’t get to say that. You don’t know either of us, so don’t assume anything.”
When he let out another sigh and turned to leave, one of the girls from before said, “I told you that you weren’t cute enough.”
walked on the other side of the street when they saw him, saw how he was charged extra or given less for his money in shops. He had never been attacked, but Draco wondered if that was
“Ententes are for Magical Creatures,” Draco said slowly as if Harry was stupid. “Yearly meetings and treaties to keep the peace. They wouldn’t allow a Wizard entry.”
“No.” Harry really didn’t want to wear them. He wasn’t sure if it was the principle of the matter or if he was just petty. But either way he wasn’t going to wear Wizard robes unless he had to.
“You rip the soul by acts of murder,” Harry whispered, heart weeping for the soul that had once been whole. “A Horcrux is the housing that holds the piece of soul. Protects it from damage, prolonging the life of someone should they meet death’s door.”
“I try not to listen to you at all,” Draco drawled as he dodged several charmed silverware that Filius threw his way.
“Does it matter?” Brown’s tone was harsh, but she didn’t intimidate him. Nothing did except for Harry in a full Veela shift while angry. He arched a brow in response and watched her roll her eyes.
Praise—however indirect it was—gave Harry goose bumps and he hoped he didn’t appear as affected as he was.
Draco regarded Harry intently and for a brief moment Harry thought he saw a splash of dark coral—concern—but the colour was too close to the red that seemed to permanently surround Draco.
“On the days I actually sleep more than 5 hours, yes. I like working at my own pace, and I like doing something that
Harry tried to think of what he could say as he waited for Ron to show up. He could take Hold out easily, but he couldn’t catch the painting at the same time. As his mind cycled through arguments, he froze when her words registered.
There was a shuddering breath before he looked up. The sadness in his eyes was piercing and Harry’s heart went out to him.
“I can make that happen.” Harry bit his lip as he tried not to snort. “I am now the owner of a Ministry broom closet. Just say the word.”
Astoria looked down and Harry got the impression that she might have already been half-way there to loving Malfoy.
“Who cares about the person, am I right?” Draco said with way too much sarcasm, something Harry chose to overlook.
Harry narrowed his eyes and Draco fell silent. It wasn’t often he was on the receiving end of a look like that.
“Put that away,” Ron said, eyes on a folder as he walked into the room. “Your magic won’t work in here anyway; your wand is suppressed until you leave St. Mungo’s perimeters.”
“I thought about it. People tell me I had the potential to teach the next wizard generation, that I could teach them what I learned, but I didn’t want that. I wanted to help those in ways I was never helped.”
“But what if I hadn’t lingered in the corridor?” Draco asked curiously. “What if I had continued with the patrol and left the area?”
“Oh hush,” she admonished as she pulled him into a hug and pressed a kiss to his cheek. “I’m only teasing. It’s nice to see you, but Teddy isn’t here today.”
“I’m going to release the body bind,” Harry said, watching the way Hold’s eyes tracked him, the only thing she could move. “And you’re going to tell me how to get him out of there.”
. For a while, it had been almost too easy to deny it. Maybe he had been having an off day, maybe Potter’s magic was just normal, maybe it was him who had lost it.
The way she bridled and stood to her full height amused Harry. But he was generally curious. She didn’t stand a chance.
A hand pressed to the wall, before the wall disappeared allowing them to enter freely. When the Dementors swooped down to pick him up, he let his hand fall away, already missing Draco’s touch.
And he did, repeatedly. Warmth must have been a synonym with Draco’s name because all Harry felt standing in the snow was warm lips and a heated energy that he only ever felt around Draco.
So had everyone else. Draco pushed Harry’s hand aside and placed it around his waist so that he could hug him, which garnered a laugh, a laugh that he had missed.
left him when he fell into an invisible barrier that stopped his fall. When he opened his eyes, another yell came out at the sight of a dozen Goblins surrounding him.
It was spat out, every word punctuated by a dramatic pause. He arched a brow as he looked to her aura. The dark copper mixed into her indignant outrage disagreed.
“I want your mouth on me.” He paused when Potter’s hands started to knead his arse cheeks. “On my body, my cock, my arse.”
Okay, thoughts on Dumbledore? Curious on which teachers didn't make it? I wanted to go into more with Lupin but there wasn't enough time or opportunity to explore that during the Hogwarts scene.
This one isn't even a prompt. I had an odd idea in my head... and here we are. This one was actually beta'd by @carpemermaidtales, so another thank you for that.
“I didn’t encounter any,” Draco argued. “I don’t know what happened to them, but there weren’t any there.”
He winced slightly as he looked at his students. Impressionable youth meant he had to curb his tongue, and that was something that took a lot of patience.
The silence that followed was stifling and it made him uncomfortable, but he wasn’t sure how to change it. That was the exact reason he didn’t like social interactions, the pressure to say the right things was always too high.
Malfoy’s hands were a distraction he didn’t need. Lips were parted, determined to make Malfoy see reason but all that came out was a choked noise as hands cupped his cock through trousers.
“Oh,” Ron leaned forwards and pushed away his plate. That alone made Harry pause. “Then, in that case, I heard that the England National Brass is looking to put Malfoy on the National team.”
“Oh,” Hold’s demeanour changed as she sat up and invited him in with a polite smile. “Is it about one of my clients?”
Despite the light drizzle that interrupted his lessons, Draco was in a decent mood. The progress of his students was up for the year and when they did well, it made him feel accomplished as a teacher—the one goal he always aimed for.
“Sirius was just so full of life. Always ready for any outcome, good or bad. If things were good then he approached life with such acceptance and such ease that I envied him. Where others might have proceeded with caution, Sirius just took it in stride. He could be cynical and sarcastic, but he did it in a way that was subtle, in a way that was still shrouded in a happiness that was just unique to himself.”
The silence that followed was stilted and uncomfortable. Potter wouldn’t meet his eyes and Draco wasn’t sure what he had said that as wrong.
“Mine was intentional,” Draco reminded him. “Intent is a property of Dark Magic. I sought it out, so the residue is stronger.”
Another demand, but Draco had never listened to Potter before, and he certainly wasn’t going to begin anytime soon. He ran his tongue along the underside of Potter’s cock and felt the bitter tang of precome in his mouth.
“Would you believe me if I said it was because I love you?” Draco tilted his head back enough to peer up into Harry’s eyes.
“No,” argued Draco as he folded his arms and eyed Filius a little condescendingly. “You just like statistics and you want me to do the work for you.”
Part of him missed the hunts, tracking down targets, enjoying the thrill of the chase. But anger had been the only thing fuelling him then. Now? Now he enjoyed a simpler life. One where he could brew potions, experiment with his Magic and be home in time for Harry to get off work.
“I used to wonder if Malfoy ever knew how much of a bully he was, wondered if he ever truly understood the things he’d say. But the more I read his journal; I realize he knows exactly what kind of person he was.”
She looked around the room warily before settling on the wrecked table and destroyed dishes. “Something came up, I had to attend to it.”
The temptation to run his finger along the book was almost too strong. If he wanted to acquire it, he’d have to appear uninterested.
Malfoy raised his hands, magic extending from both all digits. “You want to finish that sentence, Weasley? I’ve got the time.”
“Ah!” Draco jumped as the light illuminated the walls of the passage. There were mirrors along every inch of the path. He could see both himself and Potter in so many different angles. It was startling and disturbing.
I have read so many of y'all's theories and I'm so curious if they are the same as before or if they've changed any since the last chapter. I can't confirm or deny any theories, but it is fun to see what the guesses are. I'll answer any past comments when I wake and any new ones as well!
it was Pansy, it was obvious that Blaise had Flooed her, but he didn’t want to talk about it. Didn’t want to hear the comfort smashed between well aimed insults.
“I’m honoured to be part of that love. To know that he could care about me a fraction of what he feels for others is overwhelming. I know he loves me; Merlin knows that I do. How could I not? He doesn’t just say it, he shows it. And I just wish that he knew how much I loved him too. I know I don’t say it enough, and I try, I do, but I had hoped that he could
When Draco entered their flat, he expected it to be empty, he expected to have a few hours to himself but what he hadn’t expected was for Harry to be waiting for him just beyond the doorway.
Despite the uncomfortable chair, the uncertainty over the immediate future, the issues regarding the sentient magic and the vulnerability of starting a new relationship, Draco knew he was right where he wanted to be.
“Because he’s talented,” Harry said slowly, far too slowly for Greyson to not know that it was an insult. “Because he’s worked for it. Because he trained for it. Because he deserved it.”
Harry leafed through the journal, noticing that it was nearly completed, only a few blank pages left. With slight trepidation and mainly curiosity, he read the first entry.
He rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. She wasn’t wrong. As much as he loved Teddy, most of his hours were spent in his studio and that didn’t leave room for babysitting.
Harry turned to look at the person who spoke and was surprised to see how similar the man looked to Draco. Definitely a familial resemblance.
The sound of her heels on the marble floor could be heard long before he saw her. Draco waited impatiently for her to walk down the stairs and he knew her slow gait was calculated—everything she did was calculated.
to. Was it that simple? Could Draco have been in Gryffindor if he had wanted to? Not that he ever would’ve
“No,” Harry said, tightening his hold on Draco, not liking the way all eyes were on him. Made him uncomfortable. “I’m only here for Draco.”
A small smile curled his lips as he thought of them. He had thought there was only one, when he had encountered the Dementor years ago. Weeks of moving from destroyed place to destroyed place with only the comfort of a
“We know,” Cooper said, shoulders tense. “It’s out of our control and Mister Potter says it shows their true character and not ours.”
“Next week, you are going to petition for a change in your department. Put forth a bill that charges each household for the right to floo.”
A mock gasp was accompanied by a hand to Draco’s chest. “I can’t just visit my handsome boyfriend? Do I need some kind of excuse to see you? Honestly, I am hurt.”
At such a young age it was easy to get distracted by petty fights and silly drama fueled by jealousy. The reality of what stood before him was lost on eleven-year-old Draco. Back then, all he saw was competition, someone whose magical signature could rival his own.
“Keep your hands to yourself, tip generously, and respect the dancers or who knows what’ll happen to you.”
Harry groaned with Malfoy when the pace slowed down but the thrusts became harsh. A hand gripped his shoulder and it brought more of Malfoy’s scent forward.
“My mother,” Draco mumbled as he sat down and placed his chin over his outstretched arm. “What did she say about me?” His mother’s relationship with Andromeda was rocky at best and he knew that time wasn’t enough to fix it, but they tried even all these years later.
Back in the Great Hall, whispers echoed off the quiet hum of the room as Draco’s focus was entirely on Potter.
Shaky hands reached forward and for the first time since Lucius walked in, there was a glimmer of hope in his eyes.
Panic seized him as the unsettling feeling from before kicked in stronger. His magical core was fine, and he could still feel his magic like normal except…there was something else.
“My beautiful Dementor.” There was open fondness on Draco’s face as he wiped the corner of Harry’s eyes.
There was an almost mischievous twinkle to his eyes, but his smile was soft and that stood out to Harry the most. Draco wasn’t a soft fairy.
“Everyone has Magic, but not everyone has the ability to wield it. Yes, Magic is sentient. Yes, Magic chooses who can wield and who can’t. A Half-Blood must be someone with a Wizard parent and a non-wielder. Which would mean a Pureblood is someone who only has Wizard parents. Leaving a Muggleborn to be a Wizard born to non-wielding parents. Which… is still a Wizard.”
Pride. Harry was proud of Malfoy, and as weird as it was to be proud of his partner in crime, he was.
Emotions in general aren’t something most people can control. Love especially. A lot of people fall in love as easily as the wind blows, overcoming the downfalls to move onto the next person. While others take longer to love, whether it’s the emotion or the idea of falling into such a feeling, he wasn’t sure.
Harry could tell Draco was crying and he wanted to pull him away, but he couldn’t. Draco needed Lucius.
Lucius sneered. “He’s pathetic. A snivelling waste of space. The Dark Lord must be desperate if his only help is Wormtail and
Harry felt like he was missing something. This hadn’t happened before. A very uncomfortable feeling began to settle in his stomach and he didn’t like it one bit.
Draco startled at the parseltongue. It had been a long time since Harry had last used it around him. He shifted a bit when the hissing sounds from Harry’s mouth grew softer. Fuck. It was
They broke away when a Magically enhanced voice declared it was dinnertime. Harry hadn’t realized food was served at dances. Tables appeared from the ground in another show of Magic that
“I don’t think he’ll ever guess, at least not for a long time,” Draco continued, nose scrunched up in thought. “But when he sees past the illusion only to see the same thing, well, it buys us time.”
Draco didn’t bother waiting to hear what they had to say on the subject. He had said his bit and that good enough for him. He turned around and made his way towards his friends. If Lovegood could ever be classified as such.
And wasn’t that just sad? It shouldn’t be like that. House Elves should be able to be together in their own communities, to have a comradery outside of Wizards.
A shrug was uncomfortable with their positions but that didn’t stop Seamus from doing it, repeatedly.
It was amusing to have gone from being the boy-who-lived and all around coveted public figure, to someone most avoided at all costs. It wasn’t his fault there were so many people who couldn’t do their jobs as they should. If they wanted an atmosphere where the higher-ups could continue as they had during Voldemort’s reign, then they were in for a rude awakening. There was no room for corruption in the Ministry, not on Harry’s watch. The government was something that the people should
Oh. Harry’s nose scrunched up. Not somewhere of interest then. A confined space full of bratty Wizard children, yeah, that sounded like a nightmare.
Hold looked away as her fingers clenched. “We both know I’m not walking out of here a free woman. What’s it matter if I kill him if I’m going to be arrested regardless?”
Harry wanted to keep searching but he’d already looked a lot and if he kept going, he might as well just take her soul.
“Right,” Dolores said, eying Lucius a little strangely. “I wouldn’t expect anything less. If anyone says something to you, just send them my way. I’ll take care of it.”
Even. Is that what Potter really wanted? Could they ever be even? They came from different circles, walked different paths and had been on opposite sides of a bloody war. He wasn’t sure ‘even’ was attainable when it came to them.
“You got a hot breakfast date?” Harry teased, watching Draco nervously fix his hair—the same hair his fingers had been tangled in as he rode him last night. “You look cute.”
“Which is why father does it." Scorpius' voice held mystery, as if he was giving away a treasured secret.
Draco knocked Potter’s hand to the side as the sensitivity grew too much. “You’ll be the death of me. I know it.”
“Then take it,” shrugged Harry. He took what he knew of Draco by force, he’d let Draco do the same. “I won’t stop you.”
He blinked rapidly, wondering if it was all an illusion, but when he opened them wider, it didn’t change anything.
Draco threw in Floo powder as Blaise spluttered and when he stepped in, he stuck his tongue out at him as he was whisked away.
“I don’t know why you don’t just talk to him,” Ron said before swearing as one of the memos got him instead of Harry.
“It took me a few years to really understand that. I learned a lot about myself.” A small genuine smile quirked at the corners of Potter’s lips. “I can’t necessarily change the future; every circumstance is different, but the choice is still present.”
“It wants to come out,” Draco whispered, and Potter knew what he was talking about because he nodded, a whimper escaping.
A tongue came out to play and Harry held his breath, hoping that he’d get more. Malfoy’s tongue was skilled, he was sure of it, but he was so far-gone that no skill would have felt good.
“I know what you’re going through.” It was whispered so quietly, something that didn’t fit in with who Seamus was. Quiet was out of place when all he was used to was sound.
Harry’s nose wrinkled as he looked down at Sirius who hung his head, ears pressed flat against his head.
A pale eyebrow lifted as Harry was scrutinized once again. He fought a shiver as those silver eyes darkened for just a moment. “Well, that explains what you are doing here. Can’t say that Carrow didn’t have it coming to him.”
“Oh!” Ron brushed aside papers and discarded parchments on his desk. “For tomorrow’s edition, I was going to include a fight that took place in the Three Broomsticks last night. Greyson Day started a fight and one of the witnesses says it started over mentions of the ENB.”
When Draco’s brows furrowed and he was about to ask what the hell a contamination void was, Potter expanded.
“He proposed to Greengrass with the ring I bought him,” Harry whispered, hands unconsciously falling to Malfoy’s hips.
‘Boyfriend,’ Ron mouthed. “Never thought you two dating would be the least insane thing I’ve heard today.”
Silence. He was used to silence, used to having no one to talk to but himself. But as the Goblins stared at him, words non-existent, he wished for noise.
“What brings you here? It can’t be the welcoming atmosphere.” He shot a look at the secretary who was glaring at them in a suspicious manner. As if by just existing, they were doing something wrong. Harry always thought that Filch was a horrible face to greet parents or students. Try calling in sick to that man. It was nearly impossible.
Reluctantly, Harry was impressed. For a brief moment he wondered what his life would have been like if he had been raised to be a Wizard. Would he have liked Hogwarts? Would he have been in Slytherin with Draco?
“I’m not so sure you are.” It was more than a taunt; Harry genuinely wasn’t sure. “But the thing is, you don’t even know.”
For some reason this had Harry blushing as he looked down at the table. This wasn’t new to him. He had been hearing things like this from fan mail for years. People loved to think that there was more under the surface but they were all wrong. Right?
When he moved toward the painting, intending to ask for clarification, he could see shoulders shaking and that was when he
was absent as Harry looked around the room—and he preferred it that way, crowds would never be in his comfort zone.
“Fuck,” Draco swore as Harry sucked on his rim. The grip on his arse tightened and if it bruised, he was going to kill him.
“I need you to listen to me,” Draco said, voice sounding as tired as he felt. “You’re going to throw one of those jars into the passage behind us.”
The head of each delegation was going to kill him. He wasn’t following their plans like they discussed. Harry could already hear Amethyst’s bitching and feel Alyss’ disappointed stares. He was so screwed.
“The brigade vaults are six vaults connected through passages that stretch dozens of kilometres. There are little subsidiary vaults that hang off the main branch as well.”
“I want you to put yourself in his position,” Minerva said, and for the first time she wavered in her anger. “I don’t want you to think about your feelings on the matter. Just put yourself in his position and tell me how you would feel. To know that duels had been traded in for whatever horrors
Sparks’ smile was too bright, too kind and too open for his liking, but she was company and that was all he could ask for. Perhaps not as good as Harry but it was company, nonetheless.
“Potter quit!” Draco laughed loudly, trying to evade the spoon full of food the brash idiot was attempting to force feed him.
“Fuck,” Harry slammed his hands on the desk, adding to the mess on Draco’s desk. “I knew something was off about the guy, but I didn’t think it would have been connected to Hitchens.”
Potter snorted before he sat down next to Draco instead of on the sofa like he had done last time, and the closeness was almost
Draco looked up at the castle and hated that the last time he saw it was when it was damaged, cracked, broken and during the midst of a battle. Despite the fact that Hogwarts had been restored to the pristine condition it had been in before, he couldn’t shake the memories that refused to leave.
Malfoy frowned as he rested his back against the pole, his breathing was quicker, chest moving rapidly and sweat rolling down his chest.
Harry usually closed his eyes when he used Dementor Magic, but he wanted to watch Draco’s reaction. Would he whimper like others? Would he cry? Beg?
“I wouldn’t say that if I were you,” Luna chimed in mysteriously as she skipped by with a small wave.
Kreacher!! I wanted to embody Kreacher as close as I could to his original character but also keep him in a what if category. He doesn't like Sirius and he never will, check. He is a little lost on reality, check. But when it came to the important, 'were you happy' I had to think about that. Even the Kreacher in the books, I don't know if he was ever happy. Even when Sirius' mother was alive, I have to wonder if he was happy then too. I think he was happier than he was after her death for sure, but happy in general? I'm not so sure. Also, I like to think that House Elves DO have a language of their own. That makes sense to me. I've always wanted to play with that. So I used a made-up language generator and merged several of them to create that.
“Horcrux,” Lucius said, a horror taking over his face as he stepped backward into the hall. “The Dark Lord created a
“It’s chasing mine.” Draco closed his eyes in an attempt to focus. “I can feel it circling, touching, merging, separating, and then chasing again.”
“Wait!” Draco called out, ignoring Harry’s smug smile. “Don’t you want to consider this some more? Harry’s idea is just horrid.”
“I am in a generous mood and feel like I should repay my own personal saviour.” There was a wicked glint to silver eyes and it had Harry quickening his pace.
“Draco…” It was said on an exhale and he had to grip the edge of the mantle piece to stop himself from turning around.
It had to be a routine statement. Two and a half Dementors and a prisoner didn’t make for those who carried wands.
“And yet,” Harry said, tone a mockery of the innocence he pretended to be. “You’re still a low-level Vampire.”
Potter closed his eyes tightly and shook his head quickly as if to dispel thoughts or even emotions.
“That’s the thing,” Kingsley mumbled as he sat up. “We never really classified anything as a relationship. We were self-aware enough to know that it wasn’t long term. We were just existing
Harry was sick of the conversation already. He stepped forward, ignoring the warning bark from Sirius before holding out his hands and darkening the alley as he called his Dementor Magic forward.
Draco wiggled until he was able to sit on the back of Harry’s hand. There was a somewhat sad smile on his face, and Harry didn’t like it.
Before Harry could suggest which Dementor Den to go to, he was stilled immobile as both Dementors reached for his hands, skeletal fingers entwining with his.
“Peace of mind,” he offered. “Your mental health is important, and letting the Dark Lord win even after death doesn’t seem fair either. Sounds like a double injustice to me.”
Prompt was, 'Hey can you write a Drarry fix where they have an established relationship, but because Draco is the only one from Hogwarts who knows where Harry is, no one else knows, until now. Because Harry decided to meet everyone again!'
He got affirmation in a half nod from Malfoy and that was all he needed before he gripped Malfoy’s head harder and thrusted up. The noise Malfoy let out wasn’t a groan, it was half surprised wet moan and it caused his cock to twitch.
I debated about putting this here, because I do intend to add more to it. I don't know when, but I did want to write more.
“Does Webb have a big clientele? I think I saw an article about him in the Daily Prophet last week. Why would people continue to go to someone that doesn’t put in the effort for paintings done right?”
“I can tell,” Filius said as he sat down on a log next to Draco. “Why are you out here in the middle of a thunderstorm?”
had reported six sightings of wanted Death Eaters that hadn’t been round up yet. Sure, they weren’t comparable to the Dark Lord, and the savior had gotten rid of
At first glance, the vault didn’t seem to be that much different from the customer ones. The spacing was spread out to where there were more vault doors just like the others. But it wasn’t until he looked closer that he realized the vaults were all connected, and each door was a different entrance.
When the last vault had been looked at, Draco was left with a vague idea, but too many missing holes to do anything with.
“I can’t go hard like this,” Harry whispered as he tried to thrust, but the lack of grasp made it difficult, he needed to touch, to grip, to hold.
The warning sound of his floo went off but Harry’s focus was solely on Malfoy. He tried not to think of what else Malfoy would bite.
Silence settled around them, but it was comfortable as Harry hummed every so often. Draco knew that he was thinking, and that was alright, his own mind was too active as well.
“Don’t insult my intelligence,” Draco snarled. “If I wanted to kill Lorian there wouldn’t have been a body, a whisper of his disappearance and there certainly wouldn’t have been any evidence left behind.
“My wards are strong, Draco. If the magic in the weather is sentient, then it’s separate from my magic and I don’t think it would have merged enough to let you in.”
The pride in Harry’s voice made him feel warm, warm enough that he wasn’t even bothered by Brown’s muttered, ‘I bet’.
Draco waved his wand, transforming a rock into a small kitten. He maneuvered it in his path, watching the way Garnett turned around and sighed in relief at the sight of an animal.
I don’t have the required experience.” The Ministry wanted at least 15 years experience in the field to teach trainees.
It was, in the beginning. Back then it didn’t make sense. Why would Draco be drawn to his magic like that? It wasn’t until the end of their first year that he realized Draco could
“I’m open to floor sex,” Draco panted against Potter’s lips. “But perhaps not when my foot is like this.”
When one is in need, it makes them invisible to kindness. Why is it that the people who need it the most never get it? Why did caring for others come with stipulations?
“I just have a suspicion that you might have something to do with the extreme weather we have been experiencing.”
There were only a few more days until the hearing and with each new day, Brown grew restless and antsy. Which then made Declan and Nayden restless too.
“I would know, wouldn’t I?” Potter said, hands on his hip and a slimy smile on his face. “Head Auror and all.”
“You deserve to be happy in the world you helped save,” Luna said, eyes on something behind him. “But that’s not something that can happen until you see it too.”
Kindness in Azkaban seemed like an oxymoron and Draco wasn’t sure what to do with it. He tried to smile gratefully but he was sure it came off as a grimace.
Draco’s eyes closed. Fuck. He could fight it. There were plans already in place. Potter didn’t find shit—not really. But if he wanted it to remain that way…
Draco held out his hand and watched the snow melt on his skin. He had never been granted the chance to play in the snow before. As more snow fell on his hands, he couldn’t help but smile.
“I probably don’t make much sense, do I?” Harry asked, eyes going back to the journal. “I confuse myself every time I think of your counterpart.”
The sting got worse and Draco had to wipe his eyes. As he walked out of the room, he felt more knowledgeable in one aspect of Sirius’ personality, but also felt worlds lonelier.
The man’s hair certainly did get longer. The length seemed to tame the unruly locks just a little. It was hard to tell but Draco wondered if Potter had gotten taller too. He seemed to have aged inwardly in his time gone. The stance was solid, his smile was firm and the way he talked was easy.
“Can I?” A swirl of Malfoy’s tongue had him pausing. When Malfoy’s eyes met his own, he could see the arched brows and tried to ask again.
“I don’t have the answer to that,” Hermione said softly. “There are hundreds of Muggle advancements that wizards know nothing about. Wizards
No, that wasn’t it. Harry wanted to point out that he meant the Magic wanted to know more. It may have originally been casted it by a Wizard, but the Magic had evolved over the years. Sentient beyond control. But before he could say anything, the door opened on its own.
“No you don’t,” argued Goyle. “Draco is the closest person to me, the only real friend I had outside of Vincent. I went from talking to him every day to nothing. I haven’t heard his voice in over six months. I feel like I lost him, and I can’t lose him too.
The moment the jar broke, Draco let go of his wrist and extended his other hand, calling forth the cold magic inside of him, and raised another protection spell.
with a frown. He had always told himself he’d never step foot in the place, no matter how praised or renowned it was. He didn’t care for the business much, but it was the owner he disliked even more.
An impulse decision had Harry cracking the prophecy on the edge of the shelf. The glass remained intact, but the hairline fracture was enough for a white cloud of
Malfoy didn’t say anything; his hand was still gripping Harry’s and there was a peculiar look on his face.
Harry wasn’t sure what he had expected, but the painting turning his back on him was not it. Had he overstepped? Had he said something wrong?
Why should they get what he never got? He was never loved; he was never happy like that. He didn’t experience black once, never got to feel what pink was like and he certainly never had white filter through him.
The question had Draco sighing in relief. A lecture was what he had expected, but this was a pleasant miscalculation.
“Absolutely. Beginners who are too eager to learn, those that think they know what they are doing but don’t and even seasoned professionals who don’t pay attention. Mistakes happen, and the beauty of art is that you can just do it again. Either start over or fix what you have and make it work. There’s always a solution.”
“How did it go?” Harry breathed, eyes bright with a childish glee. “What did it feel like? Did you use a third eye? Or was it minimal and only felt a renewed sense of energy?”
“Life Magic went into each and every attempt at creating a Philosopher’s Stone. Life that was harnessed from
Running feet sounded thunderous, and Harry knew it was Ron, but he couldn’t take his eyes off of Malfoy. What did that mean? Someone had to always be inside it? Did that imply that it could be switched?
“I don’t know.” For the first time since it all began, Harry sounded lost. “I’m so used to doing what’s right for everyone else that I’ve ignored what I want. We deserve to be able to love freely, Draco. So does anyone else. My morality has to be shelved. I’ll worry about it when everything is over.”
“Why?” Declan asked as his eyes lit up. Draco was reminded of Granger. Someone so keen to know more.
“What I meant,” Potter continued, a finger trailing up Draco’s arm. “Is that I wasn’t able to detect your magic until you taught me. What if I can’t feel it because my magic isn’t compatible?”
A cry of pain echoed around the room, but Draco didn’t bother looking at Barnes, didn’t particularly care that the Alpha might have been hurt.
Draco set aside the letter as he wiped his eyes on the back of his hand. He hadn’t expected to see something that personal from the lockbox. Siblings were a territory he didn’t understand, not fully. He wasn’t sure opposites in a war could come in second to a sibling bond.
“You know what?” George began to tickle his sides and Draco tried to squirm away. “There’s just no pleasing you.”
I didn't want to call it an epilogue because it wasn't really one. I just wanted to show a small glimpse of them, to show the love we already knew existed, show some growth and show some friendship. As for the teaser for the next instalment, I'm not a big fan of proposing as an epilogue. It's cute but sometimes I feel like people put marriage as the happily ever after when and that's just not it. So my goal is to give you a story, give you love, give you a potential marriage, but also give you a happy ending that's not in correlation to a ceremony. Idk, we'll find out together just what happens.
“Harry.” The sigh was sad, and he didn’t want that. He hated being sad and hated when others were sad—he never did figure out how to comfort people properly.
“You imply that there is something amiss within the court,” Hemlock arched his brows. “That’s a bold statement.”
Malfoy chose stools at the bar versus a table and it was probably for the best if they wanted to avoid seeing all the stares, but confrontational wise, it wasn’t good—their backs were turned and undefended.
Harry tried, he really did. He wasn’t one of the strongest wizards for nothing. Only, his cock appeared to be stronger.
The kiss ended just as quickly as it began. As he pulled away, he could see the confusion on Potter’s face, and it matched his own, he was sure, but there was no explanation.
A bright-eyed teen with hair so long that it could have rivalled his father’s when alive stared at him with the same awe that Declan had.
“I told myself that if we were meant to be, I’d have to wait. So, I did, and I don’t regret it. I found myself along the way and that was worth it.”
The sound of someone clearing their throat had them turning toward the door. Ron was no longer alone and was accompanied by Coil.
“Or maybe,” Draco mumbled against Potter’s neck. “You allowed yourself to see me beyond your hatred.”
The hold on him lessened, as if it was a reflex or even an exhale of relief. The Magic grew warmer and that home feeling returned. What was it about the fairy that made him want to hold on?
Harry shook his head rapidly. “Don’t give away my best secrets. A Gryffindor never reveals battle tactics.”
“Leandra Prudence, you challenged the court for the right to marry someone outside of your delegation. Despite the by-the-book outcome, you are seeking to appeal the decision. This hearing will decide if the court thinks it has any merit. Should you get the majority vote, then and only then, will you be able to appeal the original decision. Should that happen, a new court date will be decided, and you can make your case.”
This time, there was no smirk, there was only a smile, but it was empowering to see, Harry thought. “Let’s define ourselves.”
The noise of several people talking could be heard, and he assumed they were in the dining room. He surprisingly didn’t hear any children, and that had been one of his worries of the night.
When no one said anything and just stared openly, he wasn’t sure what went wrong. “Any artist can, if you’d prefer someone else. But I’m sure they’ll charge.”
Harry could see the bags under Lucius’ eyes, could see lines on his face that hadn’t been there the last time he patrolled. He pulled out his wand and noticed a slight wince from Lucius. Foreboding filled him as he cast a simple vitals check.
“No, they weren’t,” Harry said, lips curling in a snarl at the way Dumbledore’s aura moved. “You just didn’t
“I have and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forget it,” Harry stepped away when Malfoy moved to comfort him. “I don’t like hurting people and I played a part in tonight. Part of this is on me.”
“Fidelius Charm,” whispered Draco, tone impressed, and eyes awed before turning to Harry and squeezing his hand. “No wonder you could feel it.”
Seconds. By the sound of thundering feet, Harry knew there were only seconds before they met whoever was after them. It was enough time yank Draco’s green robes off and give him his cloak.
What I do want to know is your thoughts on painting-Malfoy shksks. Gosh he's a lot of fun to write and I think even silent, he could give his counterpart a run for his money. Trying to picture them both in the same room makes me laugh. As for the friendship between Ron and Harry. They will always be friends, but there are some things that can't be overlooked. This is something Harry feels that strongly about and it's something that'll take time for them to talk through and understand. There's no bashing, there's nothing like that going on. It's just friends who aren't seeing eye to eye and need a break
“I have a lot of work to do,” Draco declared as he stepped away from his desk and ignored Blaise’s whining.
talk to his aunt, but he was rather hoping to avoid that. If he went to her she’d wrangle a week’s worth of babysitting out of him, and as much as he loved Teddy, he didn’t have the time.
“You’re beautiful,” Draco mumbled between pecks as he pressed a kiss to Potter’s cheeks, then his forehead, eyelids and then finally his lips.
“My runes bring that back to life,” Draco said before his nose scrunched and his lips pursed. “Well, that is as long as the customer is good enough at Necromancy.”
“And wouldn’t you know it, I just happen to be the press.” Harry grinned when Greyson’s brows furrowed harshly.
This was an anonymous prompt, it said, "Draco flipping his shit when Harry gets hurt somewhere and vowing to get back at the person who hurt him."
dangerous. Someone who believed they were right to the point of refusing to see the truth was a danger to others.
When Draco pushed his magic into Potter, he was surprised to feel precome on the stroke upwards. Looks like he wasn’t the only one affected by the exchange of magic.
.” Potter elbowed him, hard. The Goblin that hadn’t been friendly looked murderous, silver eyes shining bright. He inched closer to Potter.
Where his magic had once caused the scars, his tongue now traced over every inch of them. Goosebumps touched his lips, causing him to smile. Even in sleep, Draco was sensitive. Impatience spurred him to move downward; there’d be plenty of other times to give Draco’s chest the attention it deserved.
“Is that so?” Draco asked doubtfully as he folded his arms. He had a hard time seeing Potter as anything but the annoying git he had always been.
It was peculiar how quiet Nymphadora was. The feistiness that he had faced back in Azkaban was gone. Only her eyes held some kind of fight to them.
So he’d wait until Draco wanted to stop with the riddles and speak openly. It didn’t matter when that was; as Draco had said, Harry would always be there.
Would there be those that missed Potter? Draco was beginning to doubt that anyone would, not if they had had the pleasure of meeting him.
Draco shook his head. “I’ll gain magic in other ways throughout life, but I won’t get that specific magic back.”
The ding of a register startled Sirius as he barked. The man behind the counter slid a visitor’s sticker toward Draco who frowned at the bolded, ‘child’ that he was to pin to his robes.
“Malfoy fascinates me,” Harry admitted to both Luna and himself. “The way his mind works, from his disastrous flat to the lengths he goes to research things.”
Draco’s mouth moved but no sound came out. “None of this has ever been recorded. The books, the stories, the tales, none of them even
“Lucius’ boy?” Sirius’ hand rose to scratch the side of his head as he looked at Draco closer. “I suppose I can see it. I hope you aren’t as much of a tool as he is.”
Tears, both in the present and in Lupin’s memories. Lupin had cried when he found out about Harry’s parents, cried when he found out about Sirius, but that’s all he did, cry.
He waved his wand and watched as the student dove to catch them. “Wilkins, you know better than to use magic in the corridors, don’t make me take points from Hufflepuff.”
“No one here,” Harry murmured, brows arched at all the portraits that they passed that were doing awful impressions of someone asleep.
She had her knees pressed to her chest, back against the wall as she rocked back and forth, hands over her ears as if that would protect from the bad memories reverberating in her mind.
Not going to lie, drunk Draco is everything lmao. I had a lot of fun with this and I hope you did too! I can't decide which part of this chapter was my favorite. Either drunk Draco, learning more about his business or the end. I had a lot of fun writing the end and had to restrain myself from doing more. What was your favorite part?
An arched brow shouldn’t be so hot, but Harry had known years ago that he was whipped for anything that Malfoy did.
Malfoy let go of his jaw slowly, far too slowly to not take notice before he stepped forward and placed his forehead against Harry’s.
Death wasn’t meant for him. Voldemort wouldn’t let it, wouldn’t allow such a thing to become his fate. Not when he had worked so hard to get where he was.
When Malfoy’s hand went lax, Harry gripped Malfoy’s shoulder harder in response. He wasn’t sure his message was received but he wanted Malfoy to know that he wasn’t going anywhere.
It still burned. The injustice of it all. It wasn’t fair. Harry had seen Sirius’ memories, knew how hard he had worked to be different than his family, how he struggled to gain the respect of those who only saw his family, only saw a Dark Wizard in name but not spirit.
Sirius. Azkaban and Sirius isn't something that can be separated from. If Harry went there then he would have to see Sirius, that was a given.
“Your suffering calls me,” whispered Draco as he pat Harry’s hand in an uncharacteristically kind gesture. “My job is to heal. I will heal your pain until you no longer hurt.”
“I’ve been a little curious about something, but wanted to ask you instead of researching it,” Potter said a little hesitantly. “I’m not that knowledgeable in the subject and I wouldn’t have done it justice.”
Draco shrugged. “You didn’t. Do I think he knew? Yes. Dumbledore learned the little bit of Alchemy he knew
“When I was little, I didn’t just want to be loved by my relatives, I wanted to love them too. But they hated me, and the feeling was mutual. I wanted to love someone just as much as I wanted to be loved. And I guess I say it so much as a reminder to never forget that. I love you, Draco and I can’t help but say it over and over again.”
Most of the people they sent him after weren’t good, but in the end, did that matter? He wasn’t so sure. Right and wrong had blurred long ago and all he was left with was a wall of grey in the middle.
Something was happening and Harry didn’t know what to do. There was a rumbling of the room as his cupboard shook. Was it the house? Was the house broken? Harry threw his ratty duvet over his head and tried to block everything out.
“Hold? I’m not supposed to,” Ron said, and Harry could hear a file cabinet open. “But I’ll do it. I just have to find it.”
The pressure on the intercom slipped as Draco let his hand drop. He hadn’t wanted to start over, he had
Draco tensed before he forced himself to relax. Neville was kind, but ruthless in his observations; he would have made a great Slytherin.
When Dean shrugged, Malfoy leaned forward. “But I want you to know that I would protect you. I know what those people are like. Not in the same way you do, never at the hands of their cruelty, but I know them. I know how they work, and I promise you, you’d be safe.”
much Magic. Hundreds of years old, a lot of it sentient. “I’ve never seen so much Magic in one place.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Harry laughed, unsure how Snape and the rest of them didn’t understand. He shifted his hold on Fudge enough to keep him upright with one hand as he threw out his free one at the same time ten more Dementors flew into the room.
“So warm,” Potter whispered, and a breathy laugh filled with wonder caused Draco to smile. Had he ever looked at magic the same way?
As the band fell and Potter’s hair fell loosely down to his shoulders, Draco couldn’t help but run his fingers through it. The strands weren’t as thick as they looked, but they were wavy, the unkempt nature it had been in their youth hadn’t been tamed but the length mellowed it out some, and he was captivated.
was an expression Draco hadn’t seen on Potter since they were in their own school years. A red hue stained Potter’s cheeks and he wouldn’t meet Draco’s gaze. A hand rose to rub at the back of his neck and he shifted on his feet.
“Okay,” Lucius whispered, fingers wiping Draco’s eyes. “I will. But you should talk to your mother again before she leaves.”
When Draco opened the door, he sidestepped another knife. “You better make this quick. I intend on fucking Harry in the next half-hour whether you are here or not.”
The incredulous look sent his way had him shutting up. Leave it to a moody teenager to know too much for their own good.
“And miss all of this?” Pansy scoffed. “I haven’t seen you this messed up since the first time we stole your father’s Elvish wine.”
“I like you too.” Months of repeating the same thing would never get old. He liked Harry and his heart did too.
“You’re fighting a losing war, Lucy,” Sirius snorted. “Those two are already gone. Might as well accept it.”
Draco laughed despite himself and settled back down into Harry’s embrace. He was rather comfortable after all. He could look for the Diricawl tomorrow… that is if he can avoid Harry’s suspicions. How could he be expected to ignore all of the wonderful creatures out there?
There was no name on the spine and the cover itself was basic and dull. Before he could open it the books was snatched from his hands and the edge gave him a paper cut.
“It’s called bisexuality,” Draco drawled, looking to Corner. “Something you should look into. Either for your own ignorance or perhaps because Boot has been in love with you for months.” Really, were people blind to reality these days?
Harry moved until his mouth was pressed against Barty’s ear just as Minerva pushed her way forward, coming closer.
Honestly, he should have done that from the beginning. There were so many books on fairies, the different types and some of the many cures for when wizards befall their curses. It turned out that there was a meaning behind the trinkets.
Flashes were going off in the background and the sound of several Quick-Quotes quills had Harry sighing. This would make the evening edition, he just knew it.
Fear wasn’t an emotion Harry had felt since his cupboard years, and if he ever did feel the emotion again, it certainly wouldn’t be due to a Wizard of all things.
“Begging is a nice touch,” Malfoy said before he pressed more open-mouthed kisses onto his stomach. “Keep that in mind for later.”
There wasn’t much emotion to Lucius’ face, but he did arch a second brow, so that had to count for something.
“Fuck,” Draco swore, and he had to dig his nails into his palms to regain some kind of control over his mind. “As long as you bring them back, I don’t care what you do to them.”
The Dementors didn’t just invite him into their den, they kept him. As one of their own. And when they did, they allowed him into their hive. And that’s exactly what they were.
“Be nice to him.” Painting-Malfoy might be a bastard, rude, and too snarky for his own good, but he was also vulnerable and sort of kind—maybe.
Just the tip was in and it was already too much. His cock pulsed the deeper the dildo went. Masturbating alone was pleasurable but it was nothing compared to mutual masturbation. Part of him wanted to just do that, see how long they could last. When his eyes watched Malfoy’s fingers still moving, the squelching still prominent, he knew that he had to fuck him.
“He told me he wished I would tell him I loved him more. I told him there was no point. Which in hindsight, I’ll admit was a mistake. I don’t take it back, mind you. But I wish I had explained better before he left. I meant there was no point in saying it more if I could tell him through actions. Which I have been doing since I realized I loved him. I thought he knew. I thought he could see how much I love him.”
Harry was an expert in ignoring people, and now was no exception. He sidestepped raised hands, brushed past greetings, ignored the stares and sneered at the glares. His reputation at the Ministry had tanked after his… explosive exit. Truly his shining moment.
“You can see them too?” Luna’s focus was on him, eyes on his hand as several Sprites began to fight each other over the right to stand on Harry’s thumb.
He could spend the rest of his life in the vault and not make a dent. Draco’s eyes couldn’t focus on one thing for too long; eyes roaming from golden framed paintings to gold, jewels, weapons, crowns and more.
He wasn’t wrong. The blast destroyed more than just the building. It destroyed some of the prisoners too.
“Even when things got bad and we all joined the Order, he still approached things with an attitude that was hard to muster due to the times. Raids, deaths and a despair surrounded the atmosphere, and yet Sirius was the morale in many ways. People gravitated towards him, whether it was just to talk or to look for comfort.”
Against his better judgment, Harry pulled Ron into a hug. “Thank you.” Ashwood wouldn’t have suggested the switch in a million years, that was all Ron, it had to be.
“And Sirius?” Draco looked pointedly at Sirius who was licking himself. Probably the first bath he’d had in years.
Deja Vu time. It's nearing midnight, my ass is numb from sitting for too long. It's time for bed. I know I said last week that I was going to try and respond to comments, but I had a horrible week and that didn't happen. If I have the energy in the morning then I'll reply to comments for sure. Sorry about that.
“Or you’ll kill me.” Lucius snatched his arm back as he pushed himself upright. “Lovely choice of partner you got yourself Draco.”
Draco rubbed the back of his neck when they all stared at him. “Sorry, I’m not used to my clients not knowing all the details. I thought Ron had explained things.” He glared at Ron, who was purposely looking elsewhere.
“Still the same then,” Draco said, an interested look in his eyes. “I like the differences, it’s definitely you.”
“You think I didn’t know when I got this what a colossal mistake it was? You think I didn’t know I had chosen the wrong side? You think I didn’t know that it would follow me for the rest of my life? Of course I did! But I had to survive, Thomas. I had to make it out of there and joining was the only option I had.”
of being behind the algorithm that overrides the anti-cheating software in the computers. They believe that I am selling this algorithm for a price.” A smirk let Harry know that it was probably true.
“When I came here, Hold had the portrait half in the fire. She admitted to what she did and that’s that.”
Potter’s mouth parted, but no sound came out as he came and that alone had Draco groaning out his name. A few small jerks before nothing, and Potter stilled to catch his breath.
Harry rubbed the heel of his shoe into the ground and he knew his ears were red. “Maybe we can keep doing it?”
Sometimes he wondered how Harry could be so naive and innocent. Draco tried caressing Harry’s face to smooth out the wrinkles left behind from anger, but he wasn’t as good at it, and it felt like the pressure was too hard.
“I don’t understand,” Draco whispered to himself as he sat in the Great Hall, eyes on Potter—always on Potter.
“I should have done better,” Draco said quietly as he tightened his eyes harder till it hurt. “I felt like something was missing and kept going.”
“Where are the students?” Sirius asked from the pantry as he searched for something to eat, as if now was a good time for that. “Did the Dementors eat their souls.”
Draco jumped in surprise as he tried to hide the potted plant behind him, but it was too bulky, and it knocked over a file cabinet that shouted in fright and spit out all of the files in its panic.
“It’s lucky I was able to meet up today,” Seamus said as he downed whatever was in his flask. Harry liked to think it was Firewhisky, but Seamus refused to say. “Been real busy.”
“We didn’t do it,” Parkinson said at once. “Whatever it is you want to pin on us, you’ll have to speak to our lawyers.”
“I’m not the boy who was too afraid to say no,” Draco whispered, voice hoarse. “I’m not the decisions of my past. I will
There was a warning in there, and Harry could see malice in the form of a light green edge into Lucius’ aura. Perhaps there was a reason for Draco’s fear.
Harry knew that word. The memories of Wizards rounding up Dementors and shackling them in spells to keep them chained to Azkaban had filled him at the word. The hive buzzed angrily just hearing the name and he wondered which Dementor borrowed the emotion.
“I knew something was wrong with you,” Harry whispered, eyes leaving the portrait when grey eyes met his. “The years I had spent watching you, waiting for whatever stupid thing you’d do to me and my friends, it let me see your routine. You didn’t just stop doing your usual stuff that year, you also looked like shit.”
“Ignorance is never an excuse,” Malfoy snarled. “You knew who I was when you came to me. You knew what I was capable of and did it anyway. Don’t play clueless, don’t play the victim. Anything I do outside of the plan will reflect on you too.”
Harry winced as he looked over his shoulder. He couldn’t see them, but the yelling was loud enough that bystanders were looking at him in alarm. He never should have given them his real surname.
“Don’t break my heart like that, get that expression off your face,” Sirius ordered, fingers wiping more wetness away.
Harry clapped his hands twice. “This is what’s going to happen. You all get to walk out of here alive, and all you have to do is leave behind pinky over here.”
Harry furrowed his brows in confusion. What were they all talking about? There was no sexual tension, no chemistry and certainly no looks that spoke of something else.
He quickly put it on speakerphone so he could take notes, just in case. “Why are you calling when I’m at work? I had to floo out of my office to get away from lingering magic.”
A hand on his back soothed him, and he felt his magic settle. For some reason, Potter was an anchor to him, something that kept him grounded.
Even now, almost two years later, his heart still beat fast when they locked eyes, and when Draco laughs—really laughs, nose scrunched up and eyes crinkled at the corner—Harry can’t help but love him just a little bit more. But it was always with a disassociation. To move on, he needed to
As a stunning spell whooshed past Draco, he was thankful that Harry had loaned him his invisibility cloak. Made his job a hell of a lot easier.
When Harry’s hands began to roam, fingers trailing along any part of Draco he could reach, Draco leaned away, a flash of white before he was biting his lip.
When people began to grumble suspiciously, Zabini continued, one hand raised complacently. “Mother’s last husband—may he rest in peace—left behind
“Been awhile,” Thestral said as he poured several drinks at once, eyes never leaving him. “I assumed you’d come around more often, what with you being Glitter’s boy toy and all.”
“Is your magic still connected?” George asked. Draco knew George had been fascinated when he had found out, thought it was similar to how he and his brother had been connected.
do it better than most of the people in the little tellies. He had the charisma that they didn’t, he had the charm, the looks, the better smile. And his life was much more interesting than these people. Those with boring lives shouldn’t talk for an hour unless their aim was to put people to sleep.
that,” Hermione said with a huff. “I was married to Ron, and even though I don’t like Quidditch I learned about it. He sure talked about it enough.”
When Nott let out a tiny groan at the heartbeat thrumming underneath his fingers, Harry wished he could snort.
“You mean a date?” Malfoy said slowly, so slowly that Neville glared. “Unless you are implying something, Longbottom, and if that’s the case, please continue. I’m all ears.”
Reminding him that he didn’t have memories like that, that there was nothing to spark that kind of emotion. Happy memories were a reminder of what he didn’t have.
The lift jerked to a stop and thankfully, there was no one around as Harry pulled Malfoy up. It was a struggle trying to get the wandering hands off of him.
“Yes, Weasley,” Draco sneered, nose lifting in the air. “He’s my boyfriend. Do you have a problem with that?”
“Yes,” Kingsley laughed, hands behind his head. “Sirius rarely took himself seriously, despite the namesake. I didn’t have to study around him, didn’t have to do more, didn’t have to think, really.”
“Shut up, I’m a Pureblood.” It was panted and said through gritted teeth—held no amount of intimidation.
“That feels too easy,” Potter contradicted as his hand fell off his face to land on his lap with a thump. “It’s easy to blame Voldemort when he’s not around for the consequences. Letting it go to Voldemort or even Bellatrix means that there’s no reason for it to linger, no placement for the anger that is still here,” he pointed towards his chest.
“A little small,” Lucius sniffed as he entered the room, robes a bit more rumpled than before and he did
“Oh.” There was a pleased glint to his eyes, and it was pretty, so pretty. “I left Thestral in charge.”
This time he was prepared for the jarring stop and didn’t need the arm Potter wrapped around him, not that he was going to say anything.
Harry looked over his shoulder at Dumbledore. “That’s your own doing, headmaster. If you thought for a single moment that I would allow House Elves to remain in your control after you’ve been siphoning their Magic to keep the spells of Hogwarts alive, then you’re out of your damn mind.”
Time. I am aware I still haven't said much on Harry's age or what year it is at all. No worries, it'll all come out on it's own. As you've seen, things are different in this story and that includes the timeline. In canon the prophecy happened 5th year. I'm not saying it's not 5th year but I'm also not saying it is. So there's that lmao.
“All of that,” Draco waved a hand over a wide expanse of space. “Needs to stop. I’m not feeling that at all.”
Harry was more nervous than he thought he’d be. It was the last day he’d spend at Hogwarts. After Dumbledore’s funeral, he’d be gone. Today was his last chance to leave a gift for his fairy.
Yellow had caught Draco’s eye when Harry had woken up. A light hue that he hadn’t seen on the wings he loved so much.
Potter’s nose wrinkled, and the look he gave Draco was the same look he used to give Trelawney when she started her delusional rants. It was probably the same look Draco gives Crooks now.
Nerves about what he was about to do were non-existent; all that was left was excitement. Somnophilia had never been something that was on his radar until Draco introduced it to him. It wasn’t Harry’s kink per se, but over the years he had grown to love it. Being able to pleasure both of them while Draco wasn’t aware really did something to him.
There was a searching gaze as Draco looked at Harry, for what, he had no idea—just let him look his feel. When Draco moved his lips enough to suck in the thumb, Harry’s entire world shifted.
Malfoy groaned as his eyes closed and teeth worried his bottom lip. “I might be into exhibitionism occasionally, but not while at work.”
Draco shrugged, red still there but black slowly growing. “I’ve said far crueler things to most people here. I’m not a nice person, love.”
Draco would like to think that he was a good person, one who didn’t take pleasure in the humiliation of others, but he had never been a good person and he didn’t think he’d start anytime soon.
“What the bloody hell are you doing out here?” A voice yelled over the high winds and thunder raging.
“Oh…” The first girl spoke up, he didn’t recognize her in the slightest but she appeared to be a few years younger than him. “We were just…” She trailed off looking to her friend for help.
“No,” he waved away Blaise’s concern and tried to narrow his eyes at Potter but ended up closing them completely. “I want to hear what he has to say.”
A groan left him as Harry put the dildo back inside him. He probably should have muffled it or aimed for silence, but being quiet had never been his thing—why start now?
“Ew, sap hours,” Draco teased before he pulled George into a hug. “You’re mine too,” he whispered back.
“We were talking about the judicial system and how it’s lacking, right. I was explaining some of the things that I, as the Department Head, still need to work on and she brought up this fascinating take on—”
“His methods are flashy,” Draco murmured. “They draw attention but that’s all they are worth. He was given 1st place but when the painting began to warp a year later, it was pulled and given to me.” The award should have been his from the beginning, and he would always be bitter with the Art District for not realising poor quality when it was under their noses.
Harry startled when the lift came to a stop, his mind too active to pay attention to much. He had to look around to make sure it was the right floor before he walked into the Department of Records.
Harry’s jaw clenched and Draco hated that this is what it all boiled down to. They always argued about partners. Harry didn’t want one after he switched jobs but that was non-negotiable. All Aurors needed one and it didn’t matter how special Harry thought he was, a partner was required.
“If he is to be himself, then the girl will clearly say no.” Draco continued, not caring about how his words sounded.
“Voldemort planned to get his body back at the end of the tournament,” Harry said, watching Barty closely for any reactions. “I imagine that’ll change now that Hogwarts has no more students.”
“I told you,” Potter’s fingers traced Draco’s wrist. “I don’t want to be a saviour anymore. I chose you over them.”
Whew, this one got to me a little bit. Was a tad bit emotional near the end lmao. It's weird understanding both sides of Harry and Ron's situation. Like I can't fault either of them, personally. But it's a complicated mess, one that I don't think there are clear answers for anyway.
“Merlin no,” Seamus blinked rapidly before he scooted closer to Harry. “What good what it have done? He would have rejected me—kindly—but still let me down. He would  have emphasized that he’s straight, emphasized our friendship and then things could have gotten weird.”
It wasn’t until Draco’s face was inches from him that Harry kissed him. As their lips moved, Harry let his hands roam. It was a new experience to feel someone else pressed against him, but he liked it.
“I heard your sense of smell was heightened. I didn’t quite realise what that would entail. I talked to a few of your coworkers. They said you told them they stink, quite rude of you.”
on her?” The tone of Colin’s voice was so offended that if Luna had been a real person, Harry probably would have felt bad.
Harry jerked at Malfoy’s voice and almost let go. “You didn’t even try to go to sleep, did you?” He could feel a smile pressed into his skin and it had him rolling his eyes.
“How horrible of me.” The sarcasm was thick, but it had Draco smiling, and that was always preferable. He didn’t bother waiting for a response before Harry brought their lips together, relishing in the quiet sigh Draco released.
Harry blew out a breath, eyes on the journal and his heart heavy. Part of him wanted to reread it, but this entry was very personal, and the guilt of reading it was hard to ignore. He placed his head on his hands and let his mind wander.
Draco wanted to scream. What did Potter actually know? How did he get so far in life with nothing noteworthy in any kind of education?
Harry tried not to laugh, he did, but it all just seemed so ridiculous to him. He laughed harder when he was met with a glare too.
. Draco’s mind supplied, but he wasn’t drunk enough to say it. Infatuation was all it was, if he were sober, the thought wouldn’t have happened.
“Gunnar Pierce,” Draco said. “He was an amazing artist and also my mentor.” A pang of pain went through him at the thought of Gunnar. He would always cherish the moments he had with him. “I broke that record right after he died.” Gunnar had never gotten to see Draco’s proudest moment, never got to witness the moment the painting went active.
“I actually didn’t come by because of the robbery,” Potter said, making Draco still. “I caught wind of your signature by the alley on the way here and took my shot.”
“This is my ex-boyfriend, Harry.” Harry grinned widely at the introduction before he kissed Draco’s cheek.
magic was enough to have him writhing. Was it supposed to be so intense? Was it supposed to be so consuming?
“I love how you look too,” Harry whispered against Draco’s neck as he placed open-mouthed kisses in a trail down his skin. “I’d love how you’d look if you could age as well. I’ll always love how you look.”
