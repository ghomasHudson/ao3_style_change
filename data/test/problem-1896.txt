Autumn in the Lake District arrived early that year and appeared anxious to push summer out of the way. It seemed everyone had just folded away their jumpers and coats, only to unpack them again so quickly.
In the evening, just before dinner time, Draco closed the shop. Once everyone had left, he locked the door and drew the curtains closed. He took his wand from the locked drawer under the till and cast spells to clean the coffee pot and dirty mugs, straighten the cushions on all the chairs, and return any estranged books to their shelves.
, Potter! About
Draco surely enjoyed a slow, sensual night of sex, but tonight wasn't one of those times. Perhaps it was learning that the threat to Harry was much closer to home, but something in the last two days had ignited a fervent, deeply rooted need within Draco. He wanted to be as close to Harry as possible. He wanted to feel him and see him vulnerable and unable to contain his pleasure.
Draco stepped onto the landing and knocked on the door, panicking. What was he doing here? It felt like an entire lifetime passed, but then, at last, the door opened and there stood Potter, silhouetted in the light.
Draco's mouth hung half-open as though he were trying to force words out. He shook his head lightly. "I can't believe this is so difficult." He looked up at the ceiling.
"They wouldn't. They shouldn't, at least."
He picked up the tin from the side table and walked out. Somehow, between the time Harry had arrived at St. Mungo’s and now, the lid had become dented. Outside, nobody bothered to stop him or ask if he needed help. They were all too busy rushing around, going about their business. Somehow, that was still possible.
In the next minute, Draco felt the uncomfortable sensation of being jerked forwards. He shut his eyes as his feet lifted off the ground and a force pulled him around his navel.
By the time Draco arrived and sat at the kitchen table, Potter had already begun eating. There seemed to be an odd tension in the air. Draco spooned potatoes onto his plate and shook his head. Perhaps Potter was still upset about the crosswords.
There was just one thing left to do.
Draco felt a surge of triumph. He knew the break-in was related to this, somehow.
"Nothing," Draco said. He tried not to stare as Potter placed their shopping on a moving surface. The stony-faced man furrowed his brow..
"I'm afraid I can't share them with you. As I said, it's a special case."
"Honestly, get out. We can handle this," MacDonald said. She turned to swat Jennings with her quill and added, "You should've Obliviated him."
"Death Eaters weren't responsible after all, were they?" Potter gave a small smile.
"I need a nap," he announced to the cottage, but Potter wasn't there to take pity on him. Draco had forgotten he was meeting with Rosemary. Something about the catering preparations had fallen through. Already.
because Potter had said he liked Draco's jumper. It was because he'd received a new 5000-piece puzzle in the post - his second.
"That depends on what you have to offer."
"Draco -"
"Nobody else needs to, trust me."
Too late, he redirected his attention at Pierce, who now had his wand aimed at Draco.
"All right then." Draco sat back in his chair and crossed his arm. "What's your theory?"
"Just fuck me already, will you?" Draco whined.
It seemed to last forever, and it took a moment for Harry to regain his senses. He saw Draco watching him, catching his breath. "Well that was -"
Without thinking, Draco aimed his wand at Harry.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "So I'm still drawing the trick wand."
"The ceilidh won't be so bad," Potter said, and his footsteps echoed as he left.
Draco had lost friends, too. Once again, Potter only thought he was special.
Potter sat up and yanked his jumper and shirt over his head, tossing them on the floor. He kicked his shoes off and scrambled out of his trousers and pants. "Your turn," he said, taking his erection in hand and stroking it slowly.
Draco hardly remembered the date, but he read the entry.
"I'm going walking in the morning," Harry continued. "Why don't you come with me?" He gave a sheepish grin. "I promise it won't be as miserable as last time."
"Erm, well, see you around."
"I see him from time to time."
Draco didn't want to go home. He didn't want to deal with it.
Harry screwed up his face in thought. "Three. I started with Winstanley, but he resigned after a year due to injury. Then I was with Pierce for three years. And then Lawrence. Not sure who they'll partner me with once we return."
"D'you have any idea when you'll be finished with your assignment?"
"Are you sure it's nothing serious? You've been looking this way for a while."
He slammed the wardrobe door shut.
"Oh right, right. I forgot."
He sat and went over the details Potter shared with him about the morning Lawrence died. He had done this several times over the last several days, and whilst it felt as though he was missing something, he still couldn't put his finger on it. Draco had vague ideas about who the culprit might be, but the possibilities were endless.
Potter ignored his jibe. "Is this your shop, or do you just work here?"
"Not sure. Bill and Barbara said they'd come, but they're flaky." Jeremy took a long drink from his glass. "What's new with you two? How's Bonfire Night coming?"
Nights were difficult because he hated to fall asleep, hated to have so much time pass in the blink of an eye. But staying awake, watching the clock, was its own form of torture. Each tick of a minute rolling by registered as a keen loss in Harry's heart.
"No, thanks." Draco bit the inside of his cheek.
And if they did, they shouldn't have sent him to fetch it.
"You need to leave," Jennings said in a flat voice.
Whitby smiled. "Exactly like a house call."
He remembered that tonight was, in fact, her birthday and halted in the middle of the pavement.
Draco nodded. "All right, then. Let's go. It'll be best if you notify Robards, though. I doubt he'd respond to an emergency call from me at this hour."
Draco stepped out of the car, relieved that they'd come to a halt. He had to admit, Potter's driving had improved, but he still hated this horrible Muggle death box.
His heart nearly stopped when he saw Potter grinning up at him. It was a ridiculous, bashful grin, as though he'd been caught off guard.
Still. It could drag on for months. He patted the resignation letter still folded in his pocket. Perhaps he should just tell Robards to ask Perry to do this instead.
He tried to keep his breath steady. "That might be nice."
Draco let out a heavy sigh. They were going to be here forever.
"You didn't. What do you want?"
"I don't think so, Potter," Draco panted. He began sliding his hand up and down both their cocks, a delicious friction already building. "Eyes open. And don't you dare come on my jumper."
"That man you saw me with that night," Draco began, "he's - he's not just a friend. Not really a friend, I guess. He's my," he paused to bite his lip, "Healer."
Draco had to hold Harry back from attacking Pierce.
"Work?"
Draco looked up, and his face fell. "It's nothing."
"What if he crashes? He'll kill us all."
In retrospect, he should have noticed it sooner. But he was out of practise. He had been caught unaware. And he never would have believed he had reason to imagine Potter might come to regard him with anything approaching... fondness.
Draco's mouth hung open. Was Robards in on this, too? He couldn't imagine why someone would be so unwilling to listen to the truth. Or did he hate Draco that much?
It wasn't enough.
"Potter, wake up."
He was trapped. She and Potter looked at him expectantly, and there was no way out of this.
"How did you acquire the safe house locations?" Draco asked.
"Someone like me? I'm going to be running this place one day."
Draco's mouth opened and closed, but no words came out.
Draco sulked in his chair. He stabbed his fork into the centre of his pasta and twirled it. But he had lost his appetite.
"I said," Robards leant forwards on his desk, "good. They have their orders, and you have yours."
It made one wonder.
Potter tossed his pen on the table. "Fine. I'll just file it in my report once this is over."
"What the—Potter?
"I take my potions."
"Are you a wizard or not?"
"Plenty of people at the Ministry can easily find out what cases we're working on at any given moment," Potter said. "Unless it's a classified thing like this."
Draco turned, scanning the crowd for a face he recognised, but there were so many people, and the sun shone in his eyes. He was in an uncharacteristically good mood.
"You've died before." Draco bit his lip.
"That's right." Draco wasn't in the mood for any more nonsense.
He paced the perimeter of the shop, pausing outside the store room, finally withdrawing his keys to unlock the door and push it open. A desk took up most of the room, with a blue leather notebook resting in the middle of it. Harry sat down in the chair, just as Draco must have done everyday, and started opening all the desk drawers, one by one. Each held at least a dozen bottles of different types of potion. The rest of his supply for October, he realised. He had no idea what all the potions were for. Draco didn't even know - he'd often said he just did what Whitby told him to do, as that was easier.
"No—I mean, yes. Look, it doesn't matter. It's an Auror!"
"What does that mean for you though?" Potter spoke slowly, thoughtfully. "I mean, aren't there potions that can help manage the effects of it?"
"Yeah. Jeremy invited me." He smiled. "It's quiz night."
He forced his left palm to rest on Potter's shoulder, then took hold of his free hand. It was difficult to focus on anything. Draco didn't dare look at Potter, who led them around with lumbering steps. But he didn't want to look at the crowd either. He settled for Potter's chin.
"It's really not—"
"No," Draco mumbled into his chest and burrowed closer to him.
"There was only one bag," Potter said. "I used it about an hour ago."
"Thanks," Harry said. "Nearly had a disaster there when the caterers wanted to serve only one kind of soup."
"Harry," he breathed, turning his head to look around. "I'm still here."
"Really? Not 'Draco'?"
"You're my patient. We've been working together for four years."
He wanted to sleep. He didn't want to spend a day with Muggles. What had he been thinking?
"You realise I'll be breaking into MacDonald's and Jennings' desks, right?"
"I do."
"I don't—I mean, no. He's been called away on emergency. Solicitor business."
"Want to make things easy for me and just give me the Apparition coordinates to your family home? I might even advise the Wizengamot to go easy on sentencing."
If only he knew. "I'll be fine." For some definition of 'fine'.
Potter groaned beside him.
"But I will die."
"Good for you."
"I'm sorry—what?" Potter had risked everything for a quick chat with mates?
"Just shut up and fuck me," Draco said, pulling Harry's head down to quieten him with a kiss. He could feel Harry's mouth curl into a smile against his lips, and one hand traced a path down Draco's side to squeeze his thigh.
It was surprisingly easy to say. But then, Harry made everything easy.
"He's all right once you get to know him."
"Would you actually tell me if you weren't?" Harry placed the handful of pieces onto the coffee table, right side up, and joined Draco in flipping all the other pieces over.
They stood watching the flames crackle and dance. The group of children ran past them.
"If you're just going to laugh, then get out." Draco wet a sponge. "I hate Lister."
Draco's curiosity got the better of him on Thursday afternoon when Potter went out, and he began tinkering with the Muggle appliances. Potter seemed to enjoy watching the tele-thing, but Draco couldn't make it work no matter what he did. Surely there had to be
"More what?" Draco couldn't help it. Potter was a sight to behold in this state.
Draco had also learnt the name of the mystery programme he liked to watch—Midsomer Murders—and had started listening whilst pretending to read whenever Potter watched it.
It was not a good weekend.
"I told you not to play cards with him," Anne said. "He really knows magic." She gave Jeremy a knowing smile. Her gravelly voice didn't match her diminutive figure, and she carried herself with a nonchalant grace.
"Perhaps he's gone to all the other locations first and just hasn't got round to paying us a visit." Draco threw his arms up in the air. "How should I know?"
"Nice to meet you," Potter said. "I'm, erm, Henry." Nash's glance flicked to Draco and Potter added, "And that's… David."
Harry tossed the card on the bed, then hopped over a row of shoes and fastened his arms around Draco's waist. He leant in close so that his lips ghosted over Draco's ear. "How long have you been carrying
Robards gave a heavy sigh and drummed his fingers on the desk.
"Seriously?" Potter said.
"You're going to lose again," Draco said in a low voice, so only Potter could hear him.
"Well, I do! You could get me sacked!"
Especially when, on Thursday night, he sank to his knees in front of the sofa, where Draco sat reading. He ran his hands up Draco's thighs and pushed them apart.
"I was wondering when you'd wake up."
As they burrowed under the blankets and held each other, Draco watched Harry drift off to sleep. It hardly seemed possible that it all came down to this, that everything was near its end.
And here he was, still a junior Auror and getting ditched in the middle of dinner by prats like Lewis Edgecombe.
It was just the reluctant welcome Draco had been looking for.
Harry helped Draco up and onto the sofa, then sat beside him and kissed him lightly. "That's better," he said. "Let's think. Did anything significant happen on the 2nd of September?"
Not when he'd just realised how much he loved Harry.
"I don't know. He seemed surprised. I think whoever it was must've created the log entry themselves. Rutherford never knew anything."
"They're all too nosy for their own good. And why the hell did you agree to go to that ridiculous dance? You could have asked me first, privately."
"But it makes sense," Draco said. He was determined to get to the bottom of this. "Either someone bribed you, or—"
"D'you want to open your gift?" he asked.
"Does it matter?"
"Well?" Potter asked.
Potter blushed. "What do you want?"
"Well, yeah. I was planning on coming back." Potter smiled. "I hope you like Chinese food?"
Well, that was disappointing.
Most nights were spent laying awake until absurd hours hating the sofa and staring at the ceiling until exhaustion overtook him. Now and then, he could hear the bed frame creak when Potter shifted.
Home.
Leaving sounded appealing. He no longer had any appetite, even though he had only taken a few bites of his dinner. Part of him wanted to stay though, if only to prove he was unshakeable to these people who didn't matter.
Harry laughed. "I can do that."
Harry frowned. "What? Why?"
Potter stared at him with an odd expression. "Do you know how to cook?"
Harry pressed his mouth against Draco's neck and shifted, aligning their cocks before rolling their hips together. Draco let out a soft moan, and Harry felt his knees go weak. He moved, pressing Draco back against a bookcase. With one hand gripping a shelf and the other on one of Draco's hips, Harry closed his eyes and began a slow, steady grind. Draco's hands
He was right about one thing though - when he felt miserable enough, it was impossible to hide.
The last thing he wanted to do was talk.
He exhaled. "Afternoon, Browning."
It didn't seem fair. Draco had planned for death, not this. Whatever 'this' was.
"This stuff is so awful they didn't even want to take it with them when they moved."
"And you want me to help you."
Draco could practically see Jennings' thought process play across his face.
Draco frowned. "You mean like a house call?"
"Potter, I don't really care. And frankly, I'm not interested in going to a nice restaurant
The waiter appeared with their food. Draco stabbed his duck breast and began cutting it into smaller pieces, pointedly ignoring a glob of sauce that fell onto Lewis's robes as he tucked into his own food.
Draco nodded again and felt his smile fade.
"It's a curse that poisons the blood with a life-threatening infection. You lost consciousness because your body went into shock from the infection."
Draco stood in his socks and underwear whilst he read through his resignation letter the next morning for the fifth or sixth time.
"I'm just—"
He could be so petty.
For a moment, he considered going inside and setting everyone straight, but he knew that wouldn't be prudent. They'd only have more reason to make fun of him. It was best to just leave them alone and pretend he'd never come here.
Draco was dimly aware of Potter pressing a kiss to his forehead, and he flopped onto his back in a content heap.
"What do you want to do?" Potter looked at him in a way that made Draco's mouth go dry.
"Everyone has their role to play. Just keep Potter safe."
Draco shifted in his seat. "Maybe a little."
"You haven't even told Barclay?"
That was an embarrassing thought.
There were no slow, heavy breaths against his chest.
"There must be hundreds of bookshops in this country. Why are you haunting mine?"
"'David Crabtree'."
After he finally regained his senses, Potter pulled Draco to lie down on him. He laced his fingers through Draco's short hair and kissed him.
Merlin, Harry was such an
He snatched the entire tin and went into the living room to lie down on the sofa and read the
"Not until now," Harry finished. He pulled back to look Draco in the eye. "It's going to happen soon, isn't it?"
"There's been a break-in just now," Barclay said, breathless.
"How would I find out who tampered with a file?"
"Well, it's about -" she paused when Draco stepped into view. A satisfied smirk spread across her lips. "I see. Good morning indeed."
Draco hastily tore his own clothes off—he didn't want to take his eyes off Potter for a second longer than necessary. He pushed Potter down and climbed on top of him, making sure to press their erections together.
"Isn't this 8 Newtons Orchard?"
Draco didn't blink as Harry turned onto Newtons Orchard, and he flung his door open as soon as the car halted in front of their tiny cottage.
"Us, unless you want to crash."
Jennings smirked. "Not too bright, are you?"
"I don't know if I can do that," Draco said. He watched Potter trace a finger over the bones in his hand. When had his skin become so waxy and translucent? "I'll just be thinking about how much I'm going to hurt you. You've already lost so many people."
And something had happened just before that, Draco suddenly recalled.
"We'd be dead if you were."
"Speak for yourself." Draco set his plate on the tray and stood. "I'll be in the bedroom."
"Did you murder the people who infiltrated the Ministry, or were their deaths an accident?" Robards asked.
"Fine."
"A month! Goodness, I remember what that was like," Emily mused, and a wistful smile spread across her face. "Don't be shy now—I want to see your wedding photos." She glanced around the room as though to see if any were hanging on the walls.
After an especially dreary spell of rain, spring graced the Lake District early that year. Flowers weren't shy about pushing up from the ground after the harsh winter, and it didn't take long before they saturated the paths and fields with a spectacular array of colour.
"Instead of shopping?"
Draco snorted. "Is that even possible here?"
"I was doing what
Potter snorted and left to answer the door. By the time he returned, the delicious smell of chicken, ham, and vegetables permeated the kitchen, and Draco's stomach grumbled.
Harry thought back to that day, over five years ago now. He remembered the fear, the flash of green light, the surreal out-of-body moment just before. But that was it.
"The light switch is here," Potter said behind him. Light flooded the room.
"Stop! Stop!"
Draco frowned. "Pierce was
Potter thought for a moment and shook his head slowly. "I'm really not sure. I don't think it has to do with our case, though."
"There's nothing you can help with."
"That's what happens when you sit in a draughty corner." He gave Potter a sidelong glance and saw he wore a loose, charcoal jumper. Why did he never have clothes that fit properly? He wasn't that skinny any longer. He looked much healthier, more fit. Draco made haste in throwing a few logs onto the fire and turned to leave. He decided not to tell Potter about the blankets he kept behind the counter. His regulars knew about them, knew to ask for one if they needed.
"I don't know what to do though," he said. "Robards won't listen to me."
He took one of Draco's hands, lacing their fingers together, and angled his hips upwards. Draco's heart raced as he worked Potter's cock, and he finally let out a loud moan as he came, still grasping Draco's hand.
Draco shrugged. "I doubt he's going to get reprimanded for any of it. If it had been me, Robards would have sacked me." He waved a piece of fish at Potter. "I still don't understand how you could work with him."
"Who do you think attacked you?"
When Potter came into the shop the next day, he hung up his soggy, sleet-covered jacket. Instead of nodding at Draco, pouring himself a cup of coffee, and disappearing to the rear corner nook like he was supposed to, he approached the front counter.
"There is no problem. I just slept late." He was starting to wish she'd leave.
Only in retrospect. And only because Potter kissed him.
He sat at the counter day after day, slowly making his way through each book. He hadn't been so engrossed in a subject in quite a while. But it still wasn't enough to distract him completely from the fact that Potter had remained conspicuously absent from his shop for the last several weeks.
Draco glared in return.
He restored it to its original size, but neither of them picked it up.
"Why do you care so much?"
Sometimes Potter asked Draco questions about his life, and they weren't simple enough for a 'yes' or 'no' response. In the interest of not spoiling the civility that had emerged between them, Draco kept his voice even and gave bland answers.
"At work," Potter blurted.
Draco ran his fingers through his hair and took a deep breath. "There was a break-in at the Ministry today."
It took considerable effort on Draco's part to keep from touching himself. He downed the rest of his tea and cleaned himself as quickly as possible. He didn't bother putting clothes on and instead wrapped a towel around his waist.
after so many years? Draco cast about for words. "I - um. This. Well." Complete sentences. "I'm getting new coffee. Later. This week." Well, that was close.
Dorothy laughed. "That's not what I heard. Got into a bit of a tiff with old Drinkwater down at the bookshop already! Mind you, he could make a stone angry with him."
"Remember that when they're burying me." He went to the living room and sank onto the sofa for another miserable night of sleep.
"True," Potter said, and he took a sip of his tea. "Someone obviously got into that room—whatever it's called—where all the restricted substances are held."
was posted on a sign when he reached the fourth floor, and he pushed the door open, holding his breath as he rushed down the corridor, past the place where Draco had last told Harry he loved him.
All the blood rushed straight to Draco's groin, and he stared hard at the cards Jeremy shuffled.
"Sure," Harry said slowly. "That'd be lovely."
"I mean I don't
"Unless there was anything else you wanted to discuss," Robards said.
"Bring back something nice for me."
Someone at the Ministry. But everyone loved Potter.
"I'm sorry I forgot my Galleon," he said.
Draco rifled through the envelope, pulled out a crisp stack of banknotes, and began counting them. "If I go to the shop with you, we need to stop somewhere to buy clothes, too."
But there was nothing there except for the tiny entryway with dusty framed prints hanging on the walls.
"Come on, I think we should go home," Potter said as soon as the quiz ended.
The room felt so empty.
Draco frowned, but then his mouth curled into a smirk. "I didn't know how much you liked it." He ran a hand down his chest.
It took Draco a moment to recognise that someone was calling them. He never had got used to their fake names. He looked over his shoulder and saw Jeremy headed their way, waving.
The shower turned off, and after ten more minutes and four puzzle pieces, Draco walked into the living room. He paused by the coffee table and crossed his arms. "I thought we agreed, no puzzles in the morning. I can't be late for work."
Takeaway was tempting. Very tempting.
"Shouldn't be too much further, but I had to stop. I'm bloody starving."
"Henry."
Potter halted, and Draco nearly collided with him. He turned to face Draco and said, "I don't remember much after that. As soon as I realised the potion was an explosive about to go off, I told Lawrence to hide. I think I got out of the room in time. I—I sent a distress signal afterwards, and… That's all. That's all I remember. There were Healers, and Aurors. Then Robards spoke to me and told me I'd be sent away until this was solved."
Draco looked out at everybody one last time and crossed his arms. "Yeah. All right."
Probably.
As they approached Draco's cottage, Harry noticed something odd.
He was a regular here, too.
"How certain are you?" Harry asked. "You've said so yourself you don't know him well."
Mostly, he was afraid that Potter would laugh and turn him away, and Draco hated admitting that to himself. Potter
He locked the door to the store room, the shop, and retraced his steps from the morning back to Primrose Cottage, where there was no primrose.
Draco saw people around them turning their heads, and he shut his eyes against them. Potter pulled him closer, and Draco realised they'd stopped dancing. Yet somehow the world kept moving. Perhaps that was why he clung to Potter so tightly.
"It's only a matter of time," Draco muttered.
"If there's anything at all I can do for you..." Whitby said.
"I'm already involved!"
He had to take his damn potions, he realised, as soon as his cottage came into view.
He set the deck on the table.
"No you won't." Potter grinned. "You need me to drive."
But they didn't advertise that.
He'd thought about possible culprits and decided it must be someone with a personal connection to Potter. The problem was that Potter knew everyone.
"Come again?"
They didn't trust anyone.
"What are you going to do instead?"
Not that there was much to take in.
Draco knew the truth, at least. And he had to make sure Potter was safe.
Even though it had been months since he'd last set foot inside, Harry still felt compelled to visit everyday, still felt a pang of sadness when he realised he couldn't, that it hurt too much.
As he turned onto the main street, Draco's shop came into view, and sudden doubt brought Harry to a halt. Maybe Draco didn't want him in his shop. He'd said he needed time away from Harry, after all.
And a bit desperate, if he was being honest with himself. Seeing Draco the day before had fuelled a rush of desire that was impossible to ignore. Harry had to see him.
"Nothing. A summary of the investigation into your case."
Pierce's face twisted horribly, as though he was trying to swallow his words, but they came out despite his efforts.
Next morning, Draco awoke exhausted and tried to get out of going on the walk.
Of all the Chocolate Frog cards available, it seemed cruel that Draco would get Potter's. All his sterling achievements were listed in the biography, as though anyone needed reminding.
He put everything away before returning to the cards and letters. It amazed him that after so long, people still insisted on contacting him. When were they going to figure it out? When were they going to just bloody give up already?
As though Harry
"His father died."
His spoon clattered into the bowl. "What the hell is that?"
"I'd never come here just to trade barbs. Give me the case file."
"Why couldn't you tell me that?"
"You have no idea what I've been through," Potter said, his voice trembling. "You have no idea how much it hurts to lose a partner. And you have no idea how difficult it is to track down a criminal who really doesn't want to be found."
"I can't help that, can I?"
It was an unassuming little house composed of bright red bricks and surrounded by an overgrown garden. All the other homes looked remarkably similar. Muggles had no imagination.
Fortunately, Robards was in his office. As soon as Draco knocked, the door opened.
Potter ran a hand through his hair and sat on the sofa. Draco couldn't help noticing that he seemed fine. He didn't look as though he'd spent the entire day worrying in a makeshift shack, at any rate.
Whitby left him to lean against the door while he picked up the keys. He nudged Draco to the side a little so he could lock the door.
Somewhere in that routine, Potter started to
Harry stood and put two fingers into the exposed waistband of Draco's pants. "Bedroom," he commanded, then tugged Draco along with him and pushed him onto the bed.
The rest of the week dragged.
Potter shook his head and stared off to the side, unfocussed. He seemed to be in a distant place in his mind. "Lawrence got a tip about our case the day before. There was to be a meeting at some place early the next morning. We went to spy, to see what we could learn and if the people at the meeting could lead us to a larger ring of criminals."
"Can we at least go back home?"
"I don't know." Harry shrugged. "I know him. We were partners. Wasn't Pierce also the one investigating the break-in?"
Potter continued adding to his list. "What name did they assign you?"
"Oh, did something finally happen between you two?" She picked the knife up from the table and scooped up a dab of butter for her own toast, smirking at him over the top of her glasses.
"Maybe that's the problem." The twinkle in her eye reminded Draco of Dumbledore just then, and he felt a little faint.
"Well, is he going to be back soon?"
"He won't be there. His girlfriend left him, and he's trying to avoid her right now."
He pulled Potter close and kissed him hard.
Draco felt a rush of adrenaline and kept his eyes focussed on his porridge. "You're an awful negotiator."
He paused to look around the kitchen, taking in the hideous appliances and faded curtains, then thought about the bedroom and the living room. And that awful conservatory. Perhaps he should cast the spell a few more times.
"I doubt it's Barclay," Draco said on a rainy Thursday afternoon. He lay on the sofa with his head in Harry's lap, occasionally popping a Chocolate Bourbon into his mouth to munch.
"You stole my cup," said an irritated voice behind him.
"Sit up and drink."
Harry didn't know where home was. That word held no meaning for him any longer.
"Are we there?"
Mrs. Wilder gave him one look and scowled. "Aren't you a sight for old eyes."
Draco bit the inside of his cheeks, but kept his mouth shut. Of course Potter was right. That didn't mean he was going to admit it.
Sun shone through the trees and cast odd shadows across Potter's face, but it was easy to see how perturbed he was. Draco stepped closer to him and brushed a leaf from his shoulder.
"Who the hell comes knocking this early on a Sunday?" Draco murmured. He pulled the quilt over his head.
"I don't know what to say, sir." Draco could hardly believe it. He wasn't used to things working out in his favour.
He cast a spell to smooth out the wrinkles in his trousers and put on his red jumper again. He even made sure to wear matching socks.
Draco sat back and tore open the envelope. He pulled out a small plastic card that had his photo on it and frowned.
Draco withdrew his wand and held it out in his shaky fist. He hoped he was ready for whatever was behind that door.
"You don't know that. I could question Potter and possibly find some important—"
For some godforsaken reason though, he had chosen to bequeath his cottage to Harry. As though it made sense for anyone to own two homes in the same village, on completely opposite sides. Just what was he supposed to do with
Harry picked it up and went back to the living room, where Draco was thumbing through a book. "What's this?" he asked. There was a knot in his stomach, though he didn't know why.
"Are you?"
wants to kill Potter!" Draco shouted. "Or have you forgotten?"
"Didn't you move out of the Manor?" Potter snorted. "Don't tell me you have a house-elf in a flat."
Potter chewed on his lower lip for a minute. "Sure." He stood aside.
Draco looked around. "This is pretty much it. Jigsaw puzzles and books are in that cupboard, kitchen's over there, and the bedroom and bathroom are there," he said, pointing to each.
As members of the Wizengamot funneled out of the courtroom, Draco stood unmoving and silent. He and his family had just gotten away with murder. Sort of. It had been difficult to pin specific deaths on the Malfoy family, but nobody could deny their hand in supporting the Dark Lord - a point that had caused their trial to drag on for days.
"Took a bit of convincing, but Anne's coming tonight," he said with a wide smile. Anne was Jeremy's girlfriend. She was wealthy, she lived alone, and she was something of a recluse.
The world fell into darkness.
As January slipped into February, the snow turned into a slow, relentless rain. It made for muddy grounds and uncomfortable treks through the village.
Draco briefly entertained the idea of landing a solid punch at him. How could he want to fuck and hit Harry simultaneously?
There was one last sequence of clapping and dancing, and then the music stopped.
"I'm going to kill you for that," Draco said. "I said no come on my jumper." But he kissed Harry anyway.
"I went to see Ron and Hermione."
"Surely, for the Boy Who Lived though—"
"We should leave," he said.
And how much it hurt to lose.
"Whoever used to own it, I guess," Potter said.
"I promise it'll help," Potter said. He looked so earnest that Draco felt an odd pang in his chest.
Draco nodded and smiled.
Draco furrowed his brow.
"I'm fine." The water was lukewarm.
Everyone except Potter.
Draco screwed up his face in thought for a moment. He looked a bit flushed, but that was probably from the shower - he liked the water scalding hot. "All right, fine," he said. "I'll get our breakfast then."
"Not for another two hours," Barclay said, grinning. "Do you know where it is?"
Draco blinked. "But I'm fine now."
Draco suspected that Potter would try again with a dinner invitation, and he was right.
"Hmm? Oh, yeah." Harry furrowed his brow and smiled. "I didn't know whether it was okay to come here. I know you need time. I just -"
After the walk, they all ate dinner at the pub. Harry's words kept playing through Draco's mind, and he pressed his leg against Harry's as they devoured their food. The sun had set by the time they arrived back at their tiny cottage. It was a clear night. The moon hung heavy and full, and the pleasant chill from earlier that day had developed an ominous bite, so it was a relief to shut the door against the night.
"I told you I'd find out who it was," Draco said.
Draco pushed himself out of the chair and strode from the office. He left the door open.
It wasn't very late. He didn't want to go to sleep yet, but he still felt rattled from the evening. That horrible date. And seeing all his former friends, who no longer needed or cared about him. He needed to do something to occupy his mind, but nothing seemed appealing. His flat was already clean as well, so he couldn't even tidy up.
Until he pulled the card out.
"You are aware that Cartmel is famous for its dining options, right? And that your shop is between
People rushed about the Atrium, speaking in hushed tones.
"Erm. Well, I'll see you tomorrow," Potter said once he'd put everything away and got ready for bed. He crumpled his bag and tossed it in the bottom of the wardrobe.
you been doing lately then? Oh god, I should have asked that first," Potter moaned. He buried his face in his hands.
Five years. "Right." Five years was nothing. "When can I start taking these potions?"
"Not if we get Kingslake to do it. He's the best."
Draco took several deep breaths before continuing. "One minute, I've convinced myself we should go our separate ways. The next, I just want you to pin me to the floor and take me, like you were about to do a few days ago."
"What do you want with one?"
"I'll be fine." He nodded at Pierce. "And at least we got him. Well, you did."
He didn't understand why Draco had never done that himself. Probably, he just liked having something innocuous to whinge about on occasion, since Harry had always quieted him with a kiss.
Draco sighed and bit into a biscuit. "Six years."
Draco's heart suddenly beat much faster. "You don't?"
Possibly ever.
"Excuse me?" Draco said. "The Ministry actually wastes money on that sort of thing?"
Potter collapsed back against the sofa. "That's why you cut everyone off."
That decided, Harry grabbed his journal and left for the bookshop.
He ripped the rest of the buttons on Draco's trousers open and pulled everything off in one swift motion. Harry's clothes joined Draco's on the floor in quick succession before he launched himself at Draco. His hands raked up Draco's sides, catching on his jumper to push it up and over his head, and then  he crushed their mouths together. In desperate search of closeness, he curled his tongue around Draco's.
This couldn't be good.
Barclay was summoned on a Saturday for an assignment? And he had a girlfriend? Had the world turned upside down?
Draco bristled. Ah yes, that was what he needed. Potter. "I've met him. He's," - what to say about Potter, hm - "not really my type. Of friend." Heat rose in his face, and Mrs. Wilder eyed him over her coffee mug.
Harry loved him.
But Potter strolled in each afternoon, much to Draco's dismay. He hung his wet coat to drip all over the rug and poured himself a cup of coffee before disappearing within the shelves.
"It's great," he panted. "Touch me more, though."
So it was Pierce all along.
"What do you feel like having for dinner tonight?" Draco asked through gritted teeth.
"I guess not," Potter said, then thoughtfully chewed on a chip doused in vinegar. "We get on all right."
"I'm sorry, all right?" Potter shifted closer to look him in the eye, and Draco decided he believed him. "I didn't realise how worried you'd be," Potter continued.
Draco glared. "You don't expect me to believe you've come all the way out here for coffee," he spat.
The entire situation frustrated him more and more, and he was tired of feeling useless.
"Bye," Draco said.
He pressed a kiss to Draco's clammy forehead, and grey eyes fluttered open.
Potter returned and frowned. He added a small bottle to the mountain of biscuits.
"What? No."
Winter was harsh that year. It was a universally agreed upon truth in the village.
Draco snorted. "Nothing, I imagine. Never did manage to open it today, did I?"
That night, it was impossible to fall asleep. Draco flopped this way and that on the bed. He eventually sighed and heaved himself onto his side to watch Harry. Usually, the rise and fall of his chest could soothe and coax Draco to sleep if he had difficulty doing so.
Except Potter was special. He was easy to talk to, and he was a good storyteller, and Draco hadn't laughed with anyone like he had with Potter. He made Draco
"I wanted to see if you were still around," Draco said lamely. "I haven't seen you in a while."
"Charity," Draco repeated flatly.
Potter spent a lot of time watching the tele-thing. Draco tried to determine what he did to turn it on and change the picture. It was loud and annoying, and Potter's laugh rang throughout the room sometimes, which jarred Draco from his books and crosswords.
"You won't be saying that once winter sets in. Not up here."
The heady rush of pleasure almost erased the worry in Draco's mind. He rolled onto his back, pulling Potter on top of him, and angled his hips upwards to press into Potter's hardening cock.
Time slowed down, and he could only watch as a swirl of scarlet robes rushed past him. Several flashes of light went off all around the room.
Draco struggled not to roll his eyes. "Right. I wonder whether we could speak in private."
"I need to check on the fire," he said, hoping he sounded authoritative. Or at least in command of his faculties.
"And what about the cottage?" Harry asked.
He turned around and searched for an empty alleyway, then Apparated back to his flat.
"Kiss me," Potter said, and Draco was happy to oblige.
Situated along the main thoroughfare through the village, the squat bookshop stood between two restaurants and overlooked the River Eea. Rows of tall, walnut shelves crammed with books occupied the bulk of the shop. Mismatched, squashy armchairs populated various nooks where shelves wouldn't fit. A coat rack and a counter stood immediately to the left of the entrance. Next to the counter, there was a small table that always boasted a fresh pot of coffee and a tray of pastries. A stone fireplace stood in the back, warming a nook in the rear corner that offered a splendid view of the river.
"Nobody will be there tomorrow either." Potter reached across the table and took Draco's hand in his. "Besides, there's something else I'd rather do tonight."
As soon as the bookshop came into view, Harry locked his gaze on it and didn't blink. His breath hitched as soon as he realised Draco was staring out the window. He must have been following Harry all the way up the street. The thought made him giddy.
"And what sort of tasks require the least amount of work?" Draco asked.
Draco bit the insides of his cheeks as he watched a sandy-haired man in wrinkled navy robes nearly stumble into his chair.
"Brilliant." Potter positively beamed, and Draco was slightly taken aback. "How long do you think you'll need?"
He stuck his hand out across the table. "Malfoy, right?"
On Tuesday, they had dinner with Emily and Philip down the street.
"A word in my office," he said, and he was gone in a swish of crimson robes.
"Your house?"
Draco looked over his shoulder and saw Potter standing behind him. He held a Chocolate Frog in his hand and set it on the table.
"What do you want?" He glanced aside and saw Barclay standing in his cubicle with an eager look on his face.
That sounded good. Dreamless Sleep. That was where Draco was - in an endless, dreamless sleep. He needed to be there, too.
Harry made to press a kiss to his forehead, and he halted.
"How can you say that? They're
Draco said nothing. He refused to play this game.
"I've been coming here everyday for almost two weeks," said Potter, and he leaned one arm on the counter.
Whitby shrugged. "More or less. I wouldn't recommend strenuous exercise, but you can have a mostly normal life."
He had no idea what to wear. His wardrobe seemed to mock him as he stood there, gaping for several minutes before giving up with a hopeless sigh. He never cared about this kind of stuff. Besides, Draco had already made whatever decision he was going to. What Harry wore wouldn't change that.
He sighed, dropping the stack on the ground, exactly as Draco would have done. He took out his wand and pointed.
He pushed himself off the sofa and followed Potter into the kitchen, then slumped into a chair at the table.
Time passed too quickly.
Draco tried to pry Potter's arm away, but that only made him grasp Draco more tightly. He tried to wiggle free, but that was a mistake, because Potter thrust against him in response.
Potter still looked sad. It was almost pitiful, and Draco wondered if perhaps a good slap to the face would knock him back to normal.
When Whitby finally put his wand down to make some more scribbles on his parchment, Draco crossed his legs and asked, "So how much time have I got left? A week? Two?"
"Oh." Jeremy took a step back and thought for a moment. "Tell him I'm sorry to hear that."
Draco's heart pounded as he stared at the crowd. The fairy lights overhead no longer seemed soft and friendly, but harsh and uncomfortable.
"And you want me to listen to you?"
"We're a mess," he said. "Let's shower first."
"Honestly, I thought it was because he's partnered with you."
"No offence, but have you looked at a Muggle map before?"
If he had to pick a word for it, it would be 'friendship'. But it was so unlike any of his other friendships.
He shut the door and sat down, then waited for Robards to finish writing on his parchment.
Barclay emerged from between a row of shelves and held his arms out. "Well, this is it."
The noise grew louder, with several shouts for getting drinks after work. As though Potter needed to be celebrated more.
"Erm. You know."
Whitby settled himself into a chair next to the bed and gave a tight smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "How are you feeling?"
"It's not everyone, just her."
Harry looked over at the clock. "Half eight."
A hand snaked down his chest to cup his erection, and the next thing he knew, Draco slid to the floor on his knees, pushing Harry's legs apart.
"Yes, you too, dear! Good night."
"I looked for a place that wasn't surrounded by busybodies, and this was the first one," Draco said. "Terrible name though, Primrose Cottage." He turned the key in the door and pushed it open.
It was a new week, and he decided to start it off with a fresh pot of coffee. He splayed his notebooks and papers out on the dining table again to work while he sat there, sipping. He pulled a yellowed photo album towards him and began leafing through it for about the thousandth time. Mrs. Wilder had given it to him shortly after he'd moved in. It was a welcome gift, or as she called it, a "welcome back" gift, since the cottage had belonged to his grandparents. She'd known them. Going by the photos, she'd known them quite well. Harry loved looking at them, at how his grandfather had knobbly knees just like his, and his grandmother had a nose that wrinkled when she laughed, exactly like his.
"Oh, this is a fine afternoon. A fine afternoon," said Whitby by way of greeting.
Usually, he went home after meeting with Robards. Lately, he'd been staying a few hours afterwards to help Barclay audit reports and try to catch MacDonald or Jennings to ask about Potter's case.
Draco placed a heaping serving of pie onto his plate.
"Find anything interesting yet?"
They stared at each other. Harry couldn't make out his expression. Draco was always so bloody impossible to read. He felt his own eyes go wide, and his cheeks heated when someone bumped into him on accident.
Harry's hand stilled. "That's not funny."
"Oh. Well, not much. I usually just go home."
Draco's mouth hung open for a moment. "Oh. Well. Sure." He gave an apologetic smile in return. "That's a good idea."
Harry gave him a look that said
"I, erm. I mean, we've only done it once. It's not—Well. We had to."
Draco managed a weak smile in return. He needed time. He needed to think about this when he wasn't drunk off the feeling of Potter's hands on his. "Let me think about it."
Draco locked the door after him and drew all the curtains. He got out his wand and went through his evening routine. He took his potions. He put his jacket on and walked through the wind and rain back to his poorly named house.
He didn't know what he was so afraid of, now that he knew Harry wanted him, now that he stood here looking at Draco like that. The words were on his lips, but he bent to kiss Harry instead. It was easier to show Harry how he felt, and Draco tightened his hold to pull him closer. Harry's breath hitched, and Draco felt a cold hand cup his cheek as they broke away to look at each other.
To Draco's relief, Nash was a man of few words. He nodded again and focussed on making all of their food ring, then tucked everything into flimsy plastic bags whilst Potter counted out banknotes to hand over.
"What?"
"That's - yeah, I understand," Harry said, breathless and not understanding anything in that moment except a burning desire to rip all of Draco's clothes off and fuck him right there against the books. He pulled away, ran a hand down the sleeve of Draco's jumper. "You know, that really is a nice jumper. It makes you look, well..." Fuckable. Very fuckable. "It really makes your skin look nice."
"What if I still want to be with you?" Potter finally asked. He sat up and took one of Draco's hands.
"Yes," Harry said. "At least through Bonfire Night. Please."
"I don't want to go to this stupid party tomorrow," he said.
?" Draco scoffed. "I'm the one trying to maintain civility! Perhaps you don't understand since you grew up with Muggles, but it's not easy for me here. Half the time I try to use one of these Muggle appliances, some kind of disaster happens, like an explosion, or a flood—"
A distant crack through the air rendered them frozen.
He'd first arrived in Cartmel three years ago, having purchased a small cottage sight-unseen. It was an impulsive decision he'd made shortly after being released from St. Mungo's. Apparently the purchase created some bad blood between Draco and certain prominent inhabitants of the village. How was he to know the former owner of the cottage - who the hell even
He made sure to shut the door on his way out.
"You're my boss. You're supposed to help me reach my career goals. Frankly, I don't—"
Draco waved a hand. "Don't believe everything you hear."
"So take them." Harry tossed the covers back. "I'll see you in the kitchen."
Draco tried to think of what to say. "I think I need a drink. I'll meet you back at the manor."
That had been bad enough. Of course the damn press had followed Potter and snapped a photo as he left. Draco supposed he should be thankful that whoever had stalked Potter had avoided coming inside and discovering him as well. Probably frightened off by the presence of so many Muggles. Perhaps there were benefits to living among them, after all.
"I suppose that isn't a get well gift," he said to the Healer who entered his room.
"If it's someone in the Ministry—"
"What happened then, the day of the explosion?" Draco asked.
"Potter," Draco barked.
"She suffered!" Pierce yelled, eyes wild with rage. Even his hair, which was normally tidy, stood out in disarray. "I've got to blame someone, and you were the one who deflected that curse at her. Her death was slow and painful, and yours will be, too."
"Would that be all right with you?"
Potter perked up, surprised. "Oh - erm, how about fish and chips?"
"You're Gilbert Wimple?"
He glanced over at the side table, on which perched a lamp and a framed photo. It was one of the photos Harry had taken on Draco's birthday. He'd set the self-timer on the camera and perched it on a stack of books, then ran back to throw his arms around Draco, just in time to flash a smile at the camera.
After a while, the caller announced the dancing would come to an end. "So let's close things out with another waltz, yeah?" And he signalled to the musicians behind him, who launched into an appropriate song.
"Course I do."
"I'll just have a look around," Whitby murmured once inside the shop. He disappeared among the shelves without waiting for a response.
Harry smiled. He slowly withdrew his fingers and sat up on his knees, reaching for the lubricant again.
Everything seemed to move in slow motion as Draco raised his wand, but he was too slow.
He poured a glass of orange juice for Draco while his coffee brewed. There were blueberry muffins they'd brought back from the bookshop yesterday. He put two on a plate and left everything on the kitchen table.
"I dunno," Harry whispered.
"What, like financial records and stuff?"
He kissed Potter hungrily and settled into a slow rhythm with his hand, taking time to caress Potter's cock and give it an occasional squeeze. Potter moaned and let his head roll back against the pillow, and Draco shifted to take advantage of the exposed skin at his neck. He couldn't get enough of Potter's scent, which was clean and almost sweet.
"You're going to make me wait until you close the shop, aren't you?" Harry said.
They nodded.
And there it was again all over Potter's face. That forlorn look. "You never mentioned him before."
"Just listen to me."
Draco felt as though he'd been punched in the stomach. He stared at Rutherford, taking in his expression. But he truly didn't know.
With nothing else to do, he was getting impatient. And irritable. His parents had been there when he woke up a few hours earlier that morning. Seeing them did little to improve his mood, and eventually, the Healer suggested it might be better to leave Draco alone for a few hours.
"That's ridiculous, and you know it!" Draco shouted. "It's been years since the war, and everyone knows I'm an Auror! Nobody's petitioned to have me removed."
Harry's confidence faltered slightly. "I… No. But it's still two against one. When we get home, let's just assume he's there. Let's be prepared to attack Pierce. Or
Draco tried to take his time finishing his log entry, but there was never much to write.
And there was nothing in the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom, or the bathroom.
Except it was.
"I don't want bananas," he said as Potter set a bunch into their trolley.
Harry grasped Draco's arm. "You've got to find out where the safe house records are kept. You've got to check whether they've been tampered with."
Of course, there was no doubting the prestige of the assignment. It probably wouldn't take very long to find the culprit either—everyone still leapt at the slightest hint of danger towards Potter, even though he was more than capable of protecting himself.
"It's all right," Harry said again, quietly. He laced his fingers together in his lap. "Maybe we can talk about something else first."
"Wouldn't have guessed you were so easy to please." Potter smiled, and Draco stared after him as he left.
"It will," Potter said, and he looked away. "It helped me, you know. To talk about Lawrence with you."
Potter blinked. "I don't mind. It's your shop." Well at least he understood that.
Damn him. "It's someone at the Ministry."
"Then we'll know the other person is in trouble and can Apparate to them." Potter ran his thumb around the edge of the coin.
"Poor Mrs. Wilder never got her coffee. Did you know she's had a cup at nine o'clock everyday for the last 60 years?"
"Potter. Hi." His heart sank when he saw that Potter wore the same expression he'd had when sighting Draco with Whitby the evening before.
"We have to go. People will notice if we're not there."
Whitby stood when Draco began putting on his jacket. "I'll go with you."
"It's all right." Harry wanted to ask what he meant by 'this'. Rejecting people? Crushing their hearts?
"Emily," Potter said. He tossed an envelope on the table, removed the pie from the cooker, and brought it to the table. "She wanted to drop off tickets to the ceilidh."
"Erm, yeah. I slept late. I'll just get the fire started, and -"
Draco groaned and closed his eyes as a new Muggle grabbed his hands, and they started dancing.
"—inviting you in!" Potter's voice came from behind. "Erm, good to meet you. I'm Henry." He pushed Draco aside and stuck his hand out to shake hers. Her face lit up with joy, and Potter led her into their cottage. "Why don't you prepare the tea, David?" he called.
"Rutherford," Potter said. "Tell him I sent you."
"You don't need me after all," said Whitby, grinning.
He got ready for work and tucked the neatly folded letter into his pocket, then Apparated.
But the cool breeze that drifted in through the windows coaxed Draco to agree eventually, and soon enough, they fell into the habit of taking daily walks together.
"Anyway, I had to stop taking it," he continued. "It was causing one of the others to be less effective."
Whitby squeezed his shoulder and handed over the keys.
"Well, I'm Dorothy," the woman said, and held out her hand to Potter. "Dorothy Frances." She glanced at Draco.
"But the reports—"
"Fine."
"We have breakfast every Sunday," Harry said, sitting up. "She's my neighbour."
"Bye," Harry echoed.
Lewis's face turned red again. "That's not fair. I was looking forward to tonight."
"Draco is fine." He reached to shake the man's clammy hand. "And you'll be Edgecombe?"
"I murdered them," Pierce said simply. "They had to go."
Draco felt his cheeks warm. "Do
"We, erm, eloped," Potter said. Draco could tell Potter felt just as panicked as he did. For once, it was not a comfort.
"Erm, how do you want to do this?"
"I can't believe this is it," Harry said as they ate breakfast.
Admittedly, Draco had been as well, and now that it was about to happen, he felt giddy and almost nervous. He grabbed the bottle of lubricant and squeezed a good amount into his hand, which he promptly wrapped around Potter's cock and began stroking.
"Well, we have two options then. You can take the train here and back, but I think you'll find that quite exhausting. I can also come to you every month."
Potter's trembling subsided slightly. "How long?" He finally blinked, and tears rolled down his cheeks.
"I can't wait to read Potter's report once this is over."
Draco thought he'd rather have dragon pox than listen to Potter lament over his dead partner.
"I do," Potter said.
"Good?"
Potter looked surprised. "Great. Well, in that case, let's go now? We can have dinner there."
"Oh, sure," Harry said. "I'll erm. Well, I'll head back to the cottage. Goodnight."
"Unfortunate, isn't it?" Robards traced his mouth with a finger as he thought. "Well, think of this as a character-building exercise."
Potter's brow furrowed. "Your - are you sick?"
Harry shrugged. "Exhausted. Sore. But I'll be fine."
Harry was so busy with Bonfire Night and Draco was so concerned with trying to solve the case that the subject of their relationship kept getting pushed aside. Their time together was spent tangled in each other's limbs or trying to discern the identity of the rogue Auror.
"The bed is big enough for two," Draco pointed out, though his mind immediately went to all the times he'd walked through to the bathroom and seen Potter sprawled all over the entire bed.
"What do you want me to do?"
"London," Draco said. "We're solicitors."
"Why do you care so much? None of this—none of these Muggles are going to matter as soon as we go back to London."
"Who was that man with you?"
Of course he was. His feet weren't getting trampled.
"Are you sure this is all right?" he asked as Harry sat down with a plastic tray laden with food.
"I've already told you I don't."
Multiple owls, in fact. Harry stared at them all in horror, wondering if he should let them in. It seemed that an owl's magic didn't register whether a letter's recipient had died. They'd probably just keep returning, piling up, haunting him, like everything else in the house surely would.
"And what about yesterday?" he asked.
He got dressed and went to the dining table to decide whether he felt like working on his book or attempting to expel his misery into his journal.
"Give me one good reason not to." Draco could swear a tinge of fear touched Pierce's eyes.
Potter nodded. "Take all the time you need."
Thoughts of the recent information about Potter's case surfaced. They had a lot to discuss.
He unfolded it, gawking at how large it was. "This is ridiculous."
"I never said that."
There were times, of course, when Harry allowed the truth free rein in his conscious mind. Always at his discretion, in the shower, because there at least it was easy and almost natural to confuse tears with water droplets. It was easy to convince himself that
Draco led them towards the dimly lit interview room with measured strides. MacDonald directed Pierce's floating body onto a wooden chair and cast a spell that affixed his bindings to it.
"A week." And what a long week that promised to be.
Draco frowned.
"Sorry," Potter muttered.
It was the Chocolate Frog Harry, Draco realised. He pressed his lips together.
"Right." Fun.
"So what's it like to be an Auror?" Lewis asked once they'd ordered their food.
Draco glanced at him quizzically. "Did you spend so much time on the grounds?"
Potter shrugged. "I knew you would've said 'no'."
He breathed a sigh of relief as he closed the bedroom door, grateful to be in the comforting blanket of darkness. He flopped onto the bed and fell asleep almost immediately.
"So what do you normally do after work?" said Potter.
He took the bottle and downed it in one swallow.
"I'm surprised you didn't see your parents this week," Harry said between spoonfuls of soup.
Perhaps he could just stop with all this nonsense and let himself die. It wasn't like he had much to live for. He couldn't even have caffeine any longer. It wasn't like his family or friends would know. When he passed, nobody would miss him. And wasn't that exactly what he wanted? Why he cut everyone off? It was the only thing that had helped him feel comfortable with death, knowing that he wouldn't be missed.
As soon as he stepped inside, rain began falling.
They arrived at a clearing that overlooked a broad expanse of land and paused to take in the sight. Harry snaked an arm around Draco's waist.
Unfortunately, Draco hadn't considered that Potter might want to stick around and continue talking once they'd finished cleaning up. He still had to take his potions, which had become a much more involved process now.
"Stop looking so suspicious," Potter whispered in his ear.
"I think that's everything," he said.
Draco scowled after Robards as he marched towards the lifts.
Draco frowned, but Robards pushed an enormous mug across the desk. "Make it strong, make it sweet, and don't take your time."
"I never get the chance!"
Someone bumped into Draco, knocking him from his reverie. He shuffled towards the pub with a mix of excitement and dread in his stomach. When he peered inside through the windows, it was like looking into the past.
It was a good day.
"Are you?" Draco retorted. "You're in over your heads. You could use my help."
At least the celebratory mood had broken up. But Draco no longer cared about that. He took several deep breaths, shoved his fists into his pockets, and went into the kitchen. He'd just located his favourite mug from the cupboard when he turned around and saw he wasn't alone.
"You always have a choice."
Everyone watched in rapt attention as Potter dealt five cards each to Jeremy and himself.
He didn't need to be told twice. It had been almost two months, which was ridiculous.
At last, after three failed attempts, he found the tiny space on a shelf with the boxes he was looking for. There were only two, and they were old and covered in dust. That seemed like a good sign.
"I've always liked Orion, myself."
"Right." He didn't know anyone who worked there. At least, he didn't know anyone who worked there and liked him or owed him any favours.
Harry was astonished at the sight that met him. He had to pause in the middle of removing his shoes to look around and take everything in.
"I'm tired."
Draco frowned. There must be something else Pierce wanted if he hadn't killed Harry yet. Or Draco, for that matter.
"I am leaving. I
He crossed his mind every now and then. Whenever he made coffee in the shop. Afternoons, as the time approached for Potter to make his appearance. Evenings, as he wondered what they'd be eating later. Nights, when he had trouble falling asleep, and he wondered what time Potter went to bed. Occasionally on the weekends, when he wondered what Potter did on Sundays. Perhaps he visited with friends, or had them over for Sunday roast.
Harry nodded. Draco had explained this to him before, and he heard the words again. Some of them even registered. His mind scrambled desperately, as it had done numerous times already, trying to come up with some sort of solution. How had he managed to survive Voldemort, survive the Killing Curse twice, and something as simple as this couldn't be helped? His eyes went to the tin on the table. It was bright red and had a faded, smiling girl on it, holding up some sort of chocolate.
"Sorry," Harry said, even though he wasn't very sorry at all. In fact, it felt like he was marking Draco as his own, and he rather liked that idea. "That's why there are cleaning spells."
They went out for an early dinner at one of Cartmel's nicest restaurants.
Well, he wouldn't be the first one.
"Harry," he said, and that more than anything brought Harry's focus back. "I know we've been avoiding the issue, but I think we need to talk about this. About what's going to happen to me." Draco reached for the tin and placed it on the coffee table, then pulled Harry to him.
Draco's stomach growled again.
Draco watched whilst he worked and poured himself another cup of tea. It was rich of Potter to assume Draco was okay with people hating him wherever he went. He certainly wanted friends. But these were Muggles.
Potter nodded. "I know. Non-tradeable substance."
Against the backdrop of the grey sky, Harry's green eyes shone even more brilliantly. "I think I love you," he said.
"So," Rutherford said, "Auror Potter sent you, did he? Where is he?"
The only good thing—aside from Draco having the bed again that week—was that the animosity with Potter had settled to bland civility.
"I'm not sure," Draco said.
The whole world seemed to slow down. People scattered, their mouths open in terror. The man moved his mouth as well, but Draco didn't hear anything.
Funny how life worked.
"Fine," he said. "We can do whatever you prefer."
He hung his jacket, and the door to the disused conservatory slammed open.
Draco frowned. "Very amusing."
The ride home was quiet, and Naomi bid them good night as they got out of her car. "Make sure you drink water," she said before driving off.
"What was I doing in your book?" Harry asked. There was a trace of amusement in his voice.
Jennings screwed his face up in thought, and Draco knew he had said the magic words. He needed to remember to abuse Potter's privilege more often.
Whitby nodded and looked around. "I expect it has. Where is your journal?"
"Just give me the damn map!"
"Let's ask this bloke for directions," Potter said.
Potter had said they'd talk about
Whitby took it and began flipping through the previous month's notes Draco had kept. He paused on a page and nodded. "Yes, all right," he said to himself, then flipped a few more pages. "So, we can increase your dosage of this one as long as we no longer increase that one." With one hand, he clamped the book shut and handed it back.
had a tough morning. I've had a bloody difficult
It was impossible not to notice things, and Draco had unwittingly learnt a lot about Potter in the month they'd spent together. He knew how Potter slept, which soap he liked to use in the bath, how much sugar and milk he took in his tea, and how he walked on his toes if he wasn't wearing socks.
"He's a smug prick."
"I might've dressed better for someone who wasn't a Death Eater," Lewis sneered, and his eyes narrowed into a glare as he stood from his chair. "I don't have to take this, you know. I can do much better than you." He threw his serviette on the table and left.
Potter raised an eyebrow. "You need to do it everyday though? In a separate room?"
But everything was still the same. Nobody was there, and Harry sank blissfully into his favourite armchair closest to the fireplace. He took a deep breath and shut his eyes for a minute. It was good to be back. It was like coming home after a long day. The smell of books and coffee and the fire eased into his lungs, comforting him in a way that he hadn't realised he'd missed so fervently.
"You're welcome to join us."
"Yeah, it was all right."
. Careful what you say where people can hear you."
"Listen?"
"I have to believe it. And so do you. Otherwise you'll go mad."
Then Potter said, "What if I helped you get it?"
As soon as Pierce's body froze, Draco hurried to undo the restraints around Harry's wrists and ankles. It hurt to see the raw skin underneath, and for a moment he knelt over Harry, taking in his appearance.
"Why not? She's our neighbour," Potter said. He picked up his own plate of cake and shovelled a large forkful into his mouth.
Draco swallowed and felt himself flush. Honestly, of all the people he could have seen out here. He tore his gaze away from Potter and turned on his heel to begin walking back to his cottage.
"Oh, how delightful! Childhood sweethearts."
? Draco had never felt anything like that in his life.
"Yes. And whoever the culprits were, they died." Everything truly was too perfectly aligned to be a coincidence now. But there were still pieces missing. Why did Pierce want to kill Harry
He grinned when he felt Draco shiver, and watched him scramble off the sofa, never taking his eyes away from Harry's. His hands trembled as he undid his trousers and let them fall around his ankles. One hand rubbed the bulge of his pants, and Harry felt his mouth go dry, felt his hands reaching down to undo his own trousers and move them out of the way. He tore his jumper off and threw it on the floor, determined not to miss a moment of this erotic display.
Except this time, the files glowed green.
"Maybe. Yes." Potter laughed. "It's not funny. I thought I was going to die today. I'm still in pain. I hate to think how much worse I'll feel tomorrow."
They drove along what appeared to be the high street, but all the shops were dark inside.
"More," Potter said. "God, you feel incredible." He grabbed Draco's hips and began driving into him from below.
He wasn't in the mood to talk, so he went to take a bath and read. When he opened his book, the Chocolate Frog card fluttered to the floor. He really needed to find a new bookmark. It was disturbing to see Potter smiling at him every time he decided to read. Especially in the bath.
Draco paused to fish his Galleon from his pocket, held it close to his mouth, and muttered, "Draco Malfoy is an arse." He never did remember to make Harry change it.
He was in the Atrium when he remembered—he'd meant to make a copy of the case file in Lawrence's desk. Thankfully, everyone on Level Two had gone home already, so it was trivial for Draco to break into Lawrence's desk and duplicate the thick file.
"Nothing."
Barclay poked his head out from the shelves.
"No we wouldn't. Lister just hates me. And you listened to him."
Potter sat next to him on the sofa and grinned. "So you do like it here then."
Draco tried to swallow around the dry, spongy mass that had once been his tongue. He wasn't used to Potter being so close. "I guess anything." He didn't really know what was around.
"That doesn't mean anything to me. People have visited this area for three or four weeks in the past."
"You shouldn't have sent me then."
Potter groaned. "Don't tease me," he whimpered. "Not tonight. I want to be inside you."
Voices jarred Draco from his reverie, and in the living room, he saw Harry speaking with Emily.
It was the first time Harry had ever seen him look so vulnerable, and his breath hitched in spite of himself.
He shifted, rolling over onto his side and running a hand through Draco's hair, inhaling.
"And? I'm 83, I don't have all the time in the world, you know."
Lister handed thick envelopes to each of them. "Here you are," he said. "Papers, keys, some money, and Muggle identity cards."
After a mercifully quiet dinner on Sunday evening, Draco gave his parents a stiff hug and a kiss farewell.
Whitby sighed. "If you insist on putting it that way, yes. But you can manage this as well, with another potion."
"Oi, Malfoy."
"No."
Draco's father had given him an Invisibility Cloak one year for his birthday. It was a gift he treasured for years until the Demiguise hair turned opaque.
"We should pack," he said.
When Potter emerged, he said, "Come on. Today's the day."
"Yes." Draco kept his gaze on his tea and stirred slowly. "Robards hates me. I'm still at the junior level."
And frowned.
"I'm in Hell," he muttered, rubbing his eyes. Birds chirped outside.
Draco didn't want to say anything.
. He reached a hand behind Draco's head and pulled him close to kiss him hard.
A tall, gangly wizard in orange robes strode in. He had a weak chin and scraggly grey hair, and his eyes were fixed on a long sheet of parchment held in front of him.
Already.
He rolled up the parchment and locked it away in his desk drawer for another week.
He shut his eyes and prepared to die.
Wimple cocked his head and frowned. He looked like a steer trying to do a maths problem.
on all his letters every single time an owl came pecking at the window.
Barclay flashed a wry grin. "Not quite. We've got to go to the Confidential Records Office. We'll be auditing those files."
"I do. Well, Robards does."
At last.
Potter let out a tired-sounding sigh. "I already gave my statement to MacDonald and Jennings. They're the ones investigating, not you."
Draco's heart clenched. This past week had been one of the happiest he could remember. Still, he blanched slightly at the idea of living amongst Muggles. But it hadn't been so bad. He'd learnt how to use their contraptions, and he'd even found a telly programme he enjoyed.
Draco took a seat and reached for one of the boxes. "I had to meet with Robards."
"I will be once you start fucking me." Draco couldn't believe how insatiable he'd become around him.
Much.
They moved to the sofa. Draco propped his feet in Harry's lap and flopped backward onto a pillow.
"I don't know."
Potter swallowed a mouthful of potatoes. "'Draco Malfoy is an arse'."
He laced their fingers together on the walk back to the poorly-named Primrose Cottage. It was the kind of day Harry wished could last forever. The evening sun cast a golden light over everything, and flowers spilled onto the path. Tourists and villagers were out in force, but their numbers dwindled as Harry and Draco approached the small, blue cottage.
Draco dreaded going into the office all next week. He couldn't bear the thought of being trapped in that dark, soul-crushing room, performing the same task over and over, with no end in sight and only Barclay to talk to.
"Are you all right?" he asked.
And it wasn't. It was just a small, sharp reminder that this was all just a dream.
It was a simple life, but Draco had come to appreciate the space he'd carved out for himself, far away from anything and anyone he knew.
"Just a few," Harry promised.
"I do." Potter knitted his fingers together. "At least, I thought I did. Maybe you should look at it first. I'll, erm, make tea."
He lifted it from the compartment as though it were fragile.
"Come on, I want to get there before the sun goes down," Harry said.
Draco took out the post from his pocket and enlarged it with his wand. Two letters for Potter from his barmy mates, and one for Draco from his parents.
Harry woke up groggy the next morning, just as the sun began to peek over the horizon.
It would be a nice surprise if he lived long enough.
"Why?" Robards blurted.
"Really," Potter said, "what could I do to convince you to go?"
"Erm, I don't think there's another."
Draco raised his head. He looked at Harry and ran a finger along the side of his face while he thought. Harry felt he could look into those shining grey eyes forever.
"Talking helps, you know."
"Not every case is simple."
"You're joking."
"Not really."
Harry wasted no time in bringing out his new camera. He left Draco to finish his breakfast while he fetched it, and snapped a candid shot of him spooning cereal into his mouth.
Draco sat up in interest and craned his neck to take in all he could. Not that there was much to take in. The road was narrow, with trees and overgrown shrubs dotting either side.
"And they think someone killed him?" Perhaps Potter's would-be killer had done this.
Potter had strode through the door like he owned the place. Shock froze both of them as their eyes met, and as realisation hit, Draco felt his face contort into a rictus of horror. Before he could say anything, Potter cocked his head and gave an uncertain nod. Draco did not return it, nor did Potter seem to expect it. He disappeared amid the shelves. God, the nerve.
"He's probably right. It's almost impossible to obtain the seeds otherwise."
"God, are you still thirteen?"
If only Potter's sympathy could fix anything.
"But that wasn't Pierce," Harry said. "I thought it was some other people."
Liar.
The door to the shop opened. Draco flinched.
Whitby caught up and reached for Draco's arm. "What's the rush?"
Then again, it wasn't his job to understand him. Draco only had to keep him safe. Alive.
"I don't believe you."
"I don't know either."
"Why are we at the pub?" he asked.
The man gave an exasperated sigh. "I'm looking for Henry."
The Chocolate Frog Potter continued to smile at him.
"Happy birthday," he whispered into Draco's hair that morning.
Potter looked him in the eye as he drew a piece of paper from his pocket and slapped it down, right on top of Draco's book.
"You won't need it."
"Pardon?"
"Oh," said Harry. "I..." His mind was suddenly all over the place.
"Yeah. But, he's been back for over a year now. We don't talk much though."
Another long silence filled the air. The fire crackled merrily.
"What do you do in here while I'm gone?" Potter asked, handing a styrofoam container over.
The man was close. Draco started moving towards him, then stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the man pull out his wand.
," and a duplicate appeared on top of the original.
"I think we're lost," Potter muttered. "Again."
Potter frowned. "But I want to be involved."
"Who would want to kill you?"
"What?"
Draco could sympathise.
"Come on," Harry said. "We'd better leave."
Then he remembered everything—Pierce cursing Harry, then Stunning him.
"This is nice." Draco took a deep breath and squeezed Harry's hand. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt so alive.
"Maybe… Do you want to sit? Or… lie down? Did something happen?"
Someone had accessed these files.
"Nothing." He gave Draco a look that suggested he was offended. "Robards called me in over the weekend…"
"Brilliant." Harry's hand closed around his shoulder and tugged him close. "Now let's go to sleep."
It was quite obvious Potter didn't think Draco would enjoy whatever this was. "Where?"
a mistake to come here.
Should he quit? Was that really the only option he had left?
"So long as you didn't bring any of your friends from the press," Draco said in a low voice. He clenched his fist under the counter, crushing the Prophet article and shoving it in his pocket.
"Hmm?"
Draco tried to open it anyway and was dismayed to find that Potter was right. He took out his wand.
"Why?"
for me?" Draco's anger was tempered by a stab of satisfaction when he saw Potter's face flush red. So. This was it then.
close to him.
More rolls of parchment were unfurled. The Healer dragged a chair beside the bed and sat down. Even though a scraggly, grey beard covered much of his face, it looked full of bad news.
Potter raised an eyebrow and began kissing and rubbing Draco's inner thighs. Draco shivered at each press of lips to his legs, each gentle caress of fingertips against his skin. It was almost too much. He bit his lip and tried to urge Potter along by squeezing his legs, but Potter ignored him and continued with his teasing.
"You owe me," Barclay said. "Once you come back, you owe me. Robards has got me auditing the departmental budget reports."
Draco slept late the next morning.
Draco jerked his head around and saw Potter. "Sure."
"I'm writing," he said with a smile. He held up the thing propped against his knee, which turned out to be a black leather notebook.
The book of crosswords on the bedside table caught his eye on the way back to the living room, and he brought it with him.
"Why?" Potter asked. "I want to go."
Jennings looked over. "Work will always be there. It's not every day someone gets promoted."
He looked up at the sky, scanning until he found the familiar three stars that formed Orion's belt. The rest of the constellation came into focus, and he cocked his head. There it was - the harbinger of winter. Draco had said Orion was also called The Hunter, and that the stars depicted a figure bearing a sword and shield. To Harry though, it looked like a figure brandishing a wand in one hand and waving with the other.
"Brilliant. Can't stay to chat, I'm afraid, so I'll see you later."
Draco read the summary twice.
It was maddeningly slow for how badly Draco wanted to come, and he felt almost dizzy with need. He looked down to watch Potter's hand sliding up and down his cock, and he didn't think he'd ever seen anything so erotic in his life. It felt so good and seemed so natural that Potter's hands should be on him, and he leant forwards to kiss him.
He shrugged. "I can find the 'Draco' constellation, but that's it."
"We've got to have one last fuck before we leave," Harry said, and he took Draco into his mouth.
Once they were alone and cleaning the dishes though, Potter gave him a strange look.
"I hate thinking about that day, that case. I hate reliving it."
Whitby shrugged. "I can Apparate."
Draco groaned. "Don't tell me we're auditing more budget reports."
"I told you," Draco said. "I knew you'd lose it. That's why I've got it." He patted his left trouser pocket.
"Thanks, Malfoy," MacDonald said. "I needed that today."
Except Draco wasn't there when he opened his eyes. It was only the pillow. Harry rolled over and planted his face into it and inhaled.
"It's too cold for ice cream," Draco said..
Nine o'clock, Sunday mornings. They'd been having breakfast together for so long by then, Harry couldn't believe it had slipped his mind. He let her in and shut the door against the cold, grey morning.
Wind whipped against Draco's face, and it was so strong he had to squint. He was in a wooded area beside a lake. There was a fallen tree nearby, exactly as Potter had described. He walked fifty paces in what he hoped was a westerly direction and found it—a tiny, one-room shack.
"We knew each other at school," Potter said.
"But you need to think about it. This could be useful."
Potter tugged Draco's arm again and led him down the steps and into the centre of the floor. "How do you want to do this?"
"Malfoy."
Draco tutted. "It never ends. Every day, I learn something new about Muggles that makes me glad I'm a wizard."
"As if I wanted to drive. That's servant stuff."
Lewis leant forwards and said, "Do you work with Harry Potter?"
This was all he had left.
Draco ran a hand through Potter's messy hair. He couldn't believe this was about to happen. "Show me what you like."
Potter looked at Draco then with such desire that his breath hitched. He wondered if his own expression mirrored Potter's and groaned as Potter began bobbing his head in earnest.
Draco's hand shook as he pulled out his keys. All the blood seemed to rush from his head then, and he winced at his sudden light-headedness. The sound of keys hitting the ground dragged his gaze downward, and the world seemed to spin. Whitby's hands gripped his arms the next moment, and Draco found his back being gently pressed up against the door.
"That's not fair," Draco shot back. "They've all decided they hate me before even getting to know me. They've been listening to Potter." He sneered. "And so have you."
Harry stared. Draco was wearing the dark blue jumper - Harry's favourite - the one that made his skin look great and his eyes shine nearly silver.
"What?"
Draco slumped back in his chair. "This is such a waste of time."
Jennings returned with the Veritaserum, and Robards administered three drops into Pierce's mouth. He nodded at Potter, who pointed his wand at Pierce and said, "
"Why does Robards want to know where I was on a Sunday?"
"Did you talk to Robards?" Harry asked.
"At least go to the kitchen!" he shouted over them.
come."
Whitby gave him a look, but didn't say anything until they stepped outside. "Shall we have dinner somewhere?"
"All right. And I'm supposed to care because…?"
"You usually get up earlier than this."
Draco barely remembered to squeeze Potter's arm and say, "I'm coming," before shutting his eyes and letting his head fall back against the sofa as wave after wave of pleasure crashed over him.
"I know." Draco didn't know what to say.
Real Auror material, this one.
Draco stood eating a baked potato and watching tiny Muggle children chasing each other near a table that held a large cake.
Harry nodded slowly.
"Ouch! It's hard when you're stomping all over me."
Oh. Right. "Yes. Erm. He's not here. What do you want with him?"
"Oh, well that's - that's great. I mean, we all need friends."
Draco made to take his jumper off as well when Harry said, "Wait, what are you doing?"
Some kind of possessive feeling tore through Harry as he thought about how long it had been since Draco had been intimate with anyone, and that he had chosen
The truth. Draco contemplated which version of that to tell him. "Civil."
Draco looked as well. Foliage arrangements and colourful banners bearing the names of businesses that had sponsored the dance decorated the walls, and fairy lights were strung up all over, giving the place a soft, airy glow. The tables were adorned with sprigs of herbs and wildflowers, which carried the heady fragrance of late summer throughout the building.
"They've mentioned it."
At his desk, he leafed through stacks of parchment until he found a blank piece, then sat down to write.
"Why?"
Potter smiled.
. I didn't know how much soap to add to the washing machine. I didn't think one could add too much, and—why are you laughing?"
Draco stood and helped Harry up.
"Yes,
He concluded his morning routine by checking the letterbox and placed a thin stack of envelopes on the kitchen table to read later. Post occasionally arrived from owls as well. Less often than it used to, but more often than Draco would have liked. And sure enough, an owl soared in that morning. He'd had a feeling. He removed the letter and watched the owl flap away, then took out his wand and cast
It still felt right.
"But didn't Rutherford realise something was wrong?" Harry asked.
The radio went silent, and Rosemary stepped up to the microphone. Draco excused himself and went to the toilet whilst she spoke. He didn't have any interest in what she had to say.
Once she left, Harry slid his arms around Draco's waist. "Let's go down to the pub for dinner. I think Jeremy should be there tonight. We can meet him again."
Potter ignored him and began sorting his clothes into piles.
Robards hadn't rejected their request to return to Kilmington, but he hadn't been enthusiastic about it either. And it was good they approached him when they had, two weeks after returning to London—the cottage was scheduled to soon be designated an official Ministry safe house.
"Actually," Robards said, "I've chosen to spare you the letters I continue to receive demanding that I sack you." He paused to let the words sink in before continuing. "I also want to reiterate that professional conduct is essential. Do you know how many complaints your colleagues have lodged against you?"
"Did someone bribe you not to log details of that tip?"
"Glad you asked," Potter said. "Someone asked if I'd like to help organise the Bonfire Night celebration, and—"
"Finally," Draco muttered. He stuffed the banknotes into the envelope and followed Potter out the door, ducking around the overgrown rose bush.
It was late when Draco yawned and finally decided to get ready for bed. Just before turning the light out, he tucked Potter's face into his book and set it aside.
"Don't," said Draco. "Not yet." He moved to lock the door to the shop. "Help me draw all the curtains, first. Can't have anyone see what we're about to get up to." Potter's eyes went wide, and his mouth quirked into a smile. Draco turned quickly to begin with the curtains.
Draco glared at him. "How soon you forget that I've been cursed and -"
With a heavy sigh, Draco said, "It's a portkey. If I ever - well, when the time comes, it'll take me to St. Mungo's."
Harry.
They never should have started having dinner together in the first place. Potter had been getting too close.
"I remember."
He sat for a long time.
"I am." He set down his quill. "What do you need?"
He turned his head and saw she held out a small bottle of Dreamless Sleep.
"I can do that," Draco said.
"I'll give you the map if you let me drive."
Draco closed his eyes. "Do your worst."
Draco rested his chin on his palm as he half-listened. It seemed to take forever, and he couldn't even distract himself with his drink since a fly had landed in it and died. At last, Rosemary announced it was time to hand out assignments.
"I'm going to have to report this, you know."
"No." Draco had never been there before.
Food, it seemed, made conversation flow a lot easier. Or perhaps Potter came prepared with topics he wanted to discuss. Either way, it was not the stilted, awkward affair Draco feared it might be. And when they finished, Potter helped to clean up around the shop and suggested they leave together.
"Malfoy!" someone called.
"It's me," Harry said, smiling and holding something up.
Grudgingly, Draco agreed to let Harry drive the rest of the way, and as they approached, his heart sped up at all the familiar sights.
"Get over it. It'll be good to get out and get to know these people."
Draco pulled his gaze away from the chaos and met Harry's plaintive expression. "Do you think we're coming back?"
"Usually, when your lot come around here asking for my help, it doesn't involve asking where I was two months ago in my spare time."
"Oh?"
A thousand thoughts ran through Draco's head. He felt giddy. "Why didn't you tell me earlier?"
"Great! It'll be fun, I promise."
His heart rate returned to normal, the shock of the cold faded, and when Draco opened his eyes again, the world had righted itself. Mostly. He let out a sigh of relief. He always hated this part. Even after three years. But for today, it was over, at least.
Then again, everything felt that way.
"Muggles."
"The Kilmington Ramblers," Potter said. "It's a group of people—"
It rained every single day.
He looked over the list of suspects, feeling a pang of disappointment over how long it was.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "They have nothing, do they, sir?"
clothes. The only Muggle things I've got are the ones I'm wearing."
"How do you feel?" Draco asked.
He talked at length about Lawrence and how much he'd learnt from him. He talked about Lawrence's wife and three daughters, none of whom were old enough to attend Hogwarts yet. He talked about Lawrence's house, and the times he'd had dinner with Lawrence's family.
"And what if I don't?"
The pub was dim, with low ceilings, dark walls, and a vague air of neglect. Dusty sconces dotted the walls, and about half the tables were occupied when Potter and Draco arrived.
But this was important, too. This was for Potter.
That fucker. Draco struggled against Pierce, but he was obviously at a disadvantage.
The door swung open.
He thought he heard Harry say something, but whichever part of Draco's brain processed speech had gone on holiday. He could only respond with a groan, but that seemed to be a good enough answer, because Harry added another finger, and another, and he began fucking Draco with them whilst continuing to suck his cock.
And speaking of relationships.
"We have one last item to cover before you're ready to be on your way," Lister said. "Follow me."
It was no wonder Muggles lived such sad lives—so much of their time was wasted fiddling with all these complex gadgets just to do basic tasks. God, he was glad to be a wizard.
Draco shoved his hands into his pockets and trailed behind Potter and Lister. They went outside, and for the first time he could take stock of their surroundings. The air was still that day, and there were no other houses around. A small black car sat nearby. It looked old and boxy. Of course. Muggles really liked their boxes.
"I saw him skulking up the road yesterday evening." She took another sip of her coffee and said, "I knew he wasn't coming to see me."
certainly wasn't part of his duty for this assignment.
Draco curled up next to him and kissed his cheek.
It was a sloppy kiss, because Draco had a hard time focussing, and he couldn't stop moaning once his mounting sense of desperation became too much. He clung to Potter's shoulder and thrust his cock into Potter's hand, no longer caring if he knew how much Draco wanted this, until finally his pleasure crested and he came hard, spurting onto Potter's stomach.
It was early, but the Atrium was already full of Ministry employees milling about. Level Two was a lot less crowded. Draco knew most of the other Aurors would show up in a couple of hours, including Robards.
They had changed into Muggle clothing and were ready to leave for their new home. Draco hoped it wouldn't be quite so drab and hideous. He threw his bag into the boot next to Potter's and shut it.
Draco didn't know what to say.
As if he were a regular.
He looked up and a wave of relief washed over him at the sight of Potter's confused face. He sat curled on the sofa, watching the telly.
Potter cut into his chicken so fiercely that his knife scraped against the plate and made a horrible, tinny sound. "It always has to be about you, doesn't it?"
"Of course I'm back. It's been nearly 40 minutes." He looked... well, not angry, at least. Confused, maybe.
He counted slowly.
"I'm getting tea," Draco announced sometimes, and Potter would ask for a cup as well.
Thank goodness for Extension Charms on their bags.
needed comforting? God, how selfish and needy could he be? He laughed at the absurdity. Tears began running down his face, and his laughs became sobs. He collapsed onto his side. What a mess he was. A disaster. It was better that Draco had left, that he didn't see him like this. If he could see how much pain Harry was in already, there was no chance he'd choose to be in any sort of relationship. Not when he'd constructed his entire life around trying to avoid hurting anyone.
"Hmm."
Draco watched him put his jacket on and step outside. He watched until Potter had disappeared from view entirely before he made his way to the store room. He sat for a moment before lining up potion bottles and uncorking them. What was wrong with him? He frowned. It was foolish to be making attempts to salvage this friendship. Not when he'd let all others whither away into nothing. Potter wasn't special.
Arms wrapped around Draco as soon as he appeared in the cottage.
Draco opened his eyes and saw the ceiling. He was in the living room, on the ground, on his back.
Draco blinked. And panicked. "I'm not - there's no way I'm moving to London. No way." Not with Diagon Alley there, and so many of his former friends and acquaintances.
