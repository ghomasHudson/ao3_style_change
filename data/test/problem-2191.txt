He hooked a hand behind my elbow when I turned off the water, not waiting for me to dry my hands. Maybe he also noticed how pale my face was getting. I certainly did when I glanced into the mirror.
“Well, there you have it, then. You’re more than welcome to come around the others, too. Like I’ve said many times, my home is a safe space. I can control what happens here, and I make sure that everyone is comfortable. I have no issues asking people to leave if needed.” The treacle tart had cooled enough, so Draco cut a slice and set it on a plate with a healthy dollop of custard. He cut himself a thinner slice and picked up both plates, motioning for Harry to follow him to the living room again. “Grab two forks, will you?”
Merry Christmas to those who celebrate, and Happy Holidays to the rest! I know it's been MONTHS since I've updated; life has kicked my butt lately but I am BACK. This entire story has been plotted and I know exactly where it's going, so hopefully I'll be able to get chapters out on a better schedule.
Turning his attention to the front of the store, he quickly set the regular and decaffeinated coffee to brew with an absent flick of his wand before returning it to the receptacle and meandering back into the kitchen. He turned on the Sony radio he had found in a muggle shop, listening idly to the radio host talk about sports scores before throwing a song out. He knew most of the songs; they were muggle, but they played so often on this channel, it was easy to discern what he was listening to.
“Like… like this?” Harry breathed, beginning to move with Malfoy, his body brushing against the blondes. Malfoy threw an arm around his neck and brought his mouth right against Harry’s ear, making him shiver.
“I didn’t… what are you…” Harry paled. He hadn’t put up a silencing charm, and he definitely hadn’t tried to be quiet.
“Draco?” He watched Draco pull on the oven mitts and remove the treacle tart from the oven, setting it down on a trivet.
Ron became Head Auror and noticed that when his Aurors went on raids, the novice Curse Breakers were sent, even when the raid called for a Dark Arts Specialist. Draco was the only Dark Arts Specialist in the British Ministry, and he rarely got any field time. After some digging, Ron discovered that Draco was shunned and shuffled to the back, rarely allowed to leave his office and was more often than not stuck doing paperwork.
—” Harry began to protest, but was cut off by another squeeze to his leg. Draco looked at him and smirked, shaking his head.
“It truly is a goth club, at heart,” she had said, happily stringing some cupcake-shaped charms onto the bracelet she was making, “but they cater to all sorts. They even have BDSM nights sometimes!” Harry hadn’t been too keen on that; he was, after all, just trying something new for the time being.
His eyes fluttered closed and he shifted in the chair, crossing his long, elegant legs beneath him. I watched hungrily; it had been a long time since I had seen anyone - or anything - so beautiful. His platinum blonde locks had grown, and I longed to push a stray strand behind his ear, but I held back.
PS. there is a POSSIBILITY of an epilogue at some point. Not anytime soon, mind you, but the possibility is there!!
“One month while he was conscious.” Blaise waved a hand. “You starred in his Hogwarts wank fantasies, and now that he has you, he’s going to get you out of his system and then go back to how he was before. Draco isn’t the white picket fence type, Potter. You ought to know that by now.”
“It already smells so good,” Harry moaned, his face resting on his hands, looking longingly at the oven. “You let Neville in your kitchen?”
“James,” he got out finally, “I’m James. It’s nice to meet you.” Malfoy’s grin widened and he used their joined hands to pull Harry in close.
“Yes, but when those two came in, you got this faraway look in your eyes.” Harry insisted. “So, what are you thinking about?”
“Ginny had a last minute practice she had to go to! It’ll just be Neville, Ron, and Hermione. And us, of course.” Luna indicated the three of them in the kitchen before grabbing her bag from the ground. “I really must be going, Draco, I just have to help set up a few more things. Think you can find something to do for the next thirty minutes?” Draco chuckled and threw his cleaning rag at her.
Bidding farewell to Hermione, Ron, and Neville, he and Luna apparated back to his flat to discuss the day and to lay out a plan for the next week.
Draco would come back, Harry was sure of it. He dawdled around the kitchen, cleaning up the mugs and fixing himself a small breakfast of beans on toast. Confronting an angry Draco on an empty stomach wasn’t his idea of a fun time.
The cafe opened up exactly a month later, in a lovely open plot at Number 24 Diagon Alley. Luna had picked it out after yet another dream had revealed to her that “Two plus four was six, turned upside down is nine, and the square root of nine is three, and three is a very powerful number, didn’t you know, Draco?” He had gone with it, and she was right - it unquestionably was a beautiful spot for the shop. The English Ivy climbing up the brick was a wonderful addition to the sign Luna had put up, the very same one she created when she and Draco had first talked about it.
Sorry this took some time! I definitely wanted to get a chapter out sooner than this, but it is what it is. We're almost at the end of the line! Thanks for sticking with me through this journey <3 I hope you like this chapter!
Without raising his eyes, Draco flinched, but nodded slowly. “I… remember that I had to keep it to myself, and I’m not sure of our relationship beyond ‘roommates’, so I just wanted to be clear on everything in case I overstepped my bounds.”
A small falter and Draco was back on his game, making a point not to glance towards where the man with green eyes was standing.
He had forgiven Potter, of course. Having spoken at his trials, providing his memories for the Wizingamot to pardon Draco and his mother from a more intense sentence, and even giving his wand back with a wry smile after his house arrest had ended - Potter had done more than enough to deserve his forgiveness. That didn’t mean they were friends and met up for tea every week though; oh no. It only meant that when they saw each other in public that they were civil and exchanged a nod and possibly a few words in greeting. They weren’t tripping over themselves to chat.
Harry ignored him, focusing his energy on Blaise. “You have no right to touch him.” He took a step forward. “No right to touch him, or speak to him that way. As his Healer…”
Harry shook himself out of his thoughts and took a gulp of his drink, eyes training back to Malfoy. He moved with a sophisticated grace, never off beat, always either smiling or singing along with the songs that played. It was enthralling, and all too soon, Harry realized the set was ending. Had he really been staring at Malfoy for a full hour?
Draco’s face flashed from surprise, to annoyance, to anger. “So we are dating?” he demanded, standing to face Harry. “Why wouldn’t you just tell me?”
“I’m sure our schedules won’t coincide that much,” Harry began plating the fry-up, giving each of them a healthy helping of toast, eggs, sausage, and beans. “We won’t have to see each other all that often…”
“Erm… Snowball?” Harry winced as the ferret nipped his finger. “I don’t know, Hermione. I just got him. I’m sure I’ll come up with a name at some point.”
“Luna…” Draco said warningly, but was met with a warm laugh and the strong scent of lavender as she came through the door.
“Harry,” Draco murmured, “you’re having a nightmare. You’re in my flat, you just need to wake up, alright?” Harry thrashed, and Draco pulled his hand away. He knew better than to try to subdue someone who was still mostly asleep, even if he meant it as a reassuring pressure.
“Oh, and these cups!” She withdrew three different sizes of cups, all the same brilliant turquoise that seemed to be alive with how the light and shadows caught the curves. They were cups, alright - and while Draco wasn’t sure of the color at that moment, once the cafe was put together and everything in its place, he had to admit that it had a certain charm.
“That’s because you know me.” The explanation shocked Draco. “I could drop it as soon as I came through the door because that lady left and then it was just you and Luna. I don’t need to hide from you lot.”
“Bye, Harry!” Hermione called as he shut the floo connection, standing gracelessly and stretching out his sore muscles. He turned to the entrance of the sitting room, facing the sleep-rumpled Draco, who at least had the decency to look sheepish.
Steeling himself, he approached the bar and made eye contact with the bartender, who smiled at him in acknowledgement before finishing with her current customers. She leaned towards him and shouted near his ear, “Hey darlin’, haven’t seen you here before! What’ll you be having tonight?”
“Well that one makes no sense, I’ve been asleep haven’t I? I can’t taste anything beside my own mouth… which is disgusting, by the way.” A laugh bubbled out of Draco, relief flooding his body.
” He began to slowly gyrate his hips, willing Potter not to bolt. He could feel the other man’s discomfort, but hopefully the liquid courage he had been drinking before would kick in soon. Alyce’s drinks were very strong.
Ginny liked to brag that she was the reason the cafe had so much success at opening. She had been bringing leftover muffins and scones to her team practices for so long, the entirety of the Holyhead Harpies - including the reserve players - had shown up on opening day to show their support and get their fill of scones and muffins. Draco was slightly intimidated, but dutifully made coffee after coffee and warmed up all the pastries as they were ordered so that by the time they closed at 2pm on that first day, everything was sold out and the day had passed by in a blur.
“Yeah well,” he huffed, “You make it hard not to.” He felt Harry place a gentle kiss on the back of his neck.
Luckily enough, Draco wasn’t one to keep his mouth shut when he wanted something, so after a solid sixteen months of Harry pining, he was surprised and delighted when Draco asked him out.
Not all of them were nice, but then again, there were some jerks during the week too. Today, he had a lady who nearly threw her coffee in his face when he informed her, regrettably, that he had just sold the last of the pumpkin scones. The other customers more than made up for it, however; each of them wished him happy birthday and a few even chastised him for being at work. Being the only person manning the front line was laborious, but he managed well enough. He knew that, besides Luna, his friends wouldn’t be in today because they were at his flat preparing for the not-so-surprise party. He served with a smile, and was nearly sold out of all the scones by the end of his workday.
“Harry, mate, wake up!” Ron shouted, slapping a hand across his back, “This is a momentous occasion! Draco Lucius Malfoy is no more!” He threw a hand across his forehead dramatically. “No, my friend, the blond git you see before you is none other than Draco Black; no middle name because who needs them?!” Draco was beaming with such an un-Malfoy like expression that Harry went along with whatever they were playing at. He settled Ron on his couch, and offered Draco the spare bedroom to sleep the liquor off.
The first time Luna brought Ginny to his flat for their Sunday baking day, he thought the floor would open and swallow him whole. He stood in his kitchen, the oven beeping at him incessantly, as he stuttered out a hello, his face red as the strawberry jam he had simmering on the stove. Luna may have forgiven him, but he wasn’t so sure about any of the other witches and wizards he used to know. Ginny had surprised him, though - she gave him a tentative smile and held out her hand to shake, and when he took it, her face showed nothing unpleasant - no repulsion, no disdain, just curiosity and something Draco couldn’t quite put his finger on at the time. She had sat at the kitchen island with Luna, chatting animatedly about her summer training with the Holyhead Harpies, while Draco canned the jam and made more and more scones. The girls tried one from every batch he made, and praised him and his skills at baking. He had felt something that day he hadn’t felt in a long time - pride.
“That is a violation! You don’t touch his chart! Only Harry and the other Healers can do that.” Her voice softened. “Do we know
If they did, there’d be a lot more people in Azkaban. A lot more regulations and control; protection for those who are being hunted.
“Why would I want your weak ass coffee anyways?” Ethan spat before turning on his heel and storming out the front door. Draco listened to the tinkling bell die down before walking to the door and locking it. It was about ten minutes before the time he normally closed, but after a confrontation like that, there was no way he’d be able to deal with any more customers.
Harry chose to ignore the quip. “Looks like you were marinating some lamb before you were in St. Mungo’s. Statis charm is intact, so it should still be good.” He glanced over his shoulder. “Feel like some lamb shanks? I can make them.”
“Potter… Harry, can you breathe with me? Let’s do something together now, okay?” Harry’s breaths were coming faster and faster, and Draco had to think quickly. “Harry, listen. What are five things you can see?” His eyes remained shut tight. “Harry, please,” Draco lowered his voice, “open your eyes. What are five things you can see?” Harry cracked his eyes open, finally, and Draco breathed a sigh of relief. “Come on, Harry. Five things you can see?”
“Cheer up, mate. We’ll get through this.” Ron rested his chin on his hand and thought for a moment. “You know, I could ask the Unspeakables if they know anything about these kinds of mind curses. I think they have a specific room where they learn about and test things like this…”
As he was bleeding out, he sent a Wingardium Leviosa at my knife and dropped it right onto my leg. The blade embedded itself into my femur, and nicked my femoral artery.
Harry knew it was too soon, though he knew what he felt for Draco was nothing short of love. He wasn’t keen on ruining their new relationship by saying it too soon, so he kept it to himself. Draco seemed to be the same way, not wanting to take their physical relationship too quickly. “I want to court you first,” he had said, his hands curling into Harry’s hair as he brushed small kisses over the full expanse of his face. “I want to do this one thing right.”
“Stop touching my patient, Ron.” Waving him away, Harry conjured a stool and sat before Draco, who was eyeing him warily.
“I think you already know what it’s going to be, Harry, and you’re not going to like it very much. Rule three - don’t even think about getting involved with Malfoy while wearing a Glamour.”
Harry smiled. “One month. Well,” he amended, “two months, technically, but you were in the coma for a full month, so we weren’t exactly… together.”
I was. I shook myself and stood, tugging the pajamas back up as I nodded. I managed to get to the sink and rested my palms on the cool marble, taking several deep breaths before I washed my hands.
It took him a moment to clear his throat before he was able to speak. “I didn’t realize I was invited. I know you said Ginny would be there, and I really don’t want to cause any problems on Malfoy’s birthday.” Luna waved off Harry’s intrepidation.
Draco thought about that. The blueberry lemon scones had grown quite a cult following, and they had sold out before the end of the day every day this week. He planned on making them a staple on the menu, though he hadn’t told Harry that yet. He wouldn’t technically need to know about the espresso machine malfunctioning, but...
Draco cleared his throat. “She… you don’t have to stay if you don’t want to, Potter,” he sighed, “I’m honestly very good at time management, she just…”
“Honestly, ever since we got here, I’ve been thinking about the cafe.” He admitted, glancing at the bakery cabinet that showed all of the different croissants the little shop sold. “And that child was talking about Nutella, which I’ve never heard of, so I was making a mental note to look it up and see what it was about. Maybe we should start selling actual food at the cafe, I’m not sure.”
Draco really hoped he would have dropped the question by then. “You asked me when I got off work, but I am, unfortunately, unavailable. Now, if I could just grab your order…?”
“She said that when I saw her on Tuesday too.” Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck, and Draco imagined his face had turned beet red. “Said something about us being good for each other.”
“I certainly hope so.” Hermione finished her coffee and stood. “Giving himself his own autonomy was one of the major turning points in his life. He changed for the better. We can only hope it’ll come back.
He took a step towards Draco, who hugged himself tighter, still staring at a spot somewhere beyond Harry. “Hey,” he said gently, reaching out a hand and rubbing it soothingly along one of Draco’s tense arms, “Why don’t you go home, yeah? I’ll meet you there in a moment.”
So that was it. Harry was uncomfortable being paid. It had nothing to do with spending extra time with Draco after all. He strode over and wrapped his arms around Harry, giving him a quick peck on the lips. “We’d have to pay you if you were here for longer than 8 hours in the week. But!” He held up a finger to silence Harry as he opened his mouth. “Instead of giving
“Honestly, you act like I’ll blurt your secrets to the whole world, both of you. There!” She gripped her book tighter and brought it closer to her face. “Treasure Mapping. Specifically designed for children’s treasure hunts.” Harry frowned and Hermione smirked. “No, Harry, it wouldn’t have been useful for Horcruxes, because it was only invented three years ago.”
Harry rolls his eyes; he can’t wait until Draco is done with his exams, since it means he’ll finally stop complaining about them. It’ll also take some pressure off his shoulders. Potion Masters are a rarity.
Biting his lower lip to prevent himself from chuckling, Draco nodded, in awe of Scorpius’ wisdom. Draco didn’t always feel pride in his past actions; truth be told, most of the events of his teenage years brought him nothing but shame. But his son? His baby boy was his greatest achievement, and having raised him so well must mean that Draco wasn’t that much of a failure after all.
It hurt Draco to see his jaw tensing when he sketched the cupboard, and it saddened him to know the size of it. He was pretty sure it was appropriately scaled. Spending so long in a small place left traces, and just like Draco would never forget his Azkaban cell, Harry’s cupboard wouldn’t go away. Unlike Harry though, Draco hadn’t spent ten years in it, only a brief stint for a few months after the war.
Draco knows that; as a teacher, Harry is allowed inside, and he spilt the secrets of every House in a letter a week after he took the job (he also reported finding Draco’s bed and the engraved “Potter Stinks” on the bedpost). “Of course you do. No one else could be trusted with weapons. The Ravenclaws would try to study the sharpness of the blade, and can you imagine what would happen with the Gryffindors?”
—little boy, who looked so much like his dad, who would one day go into the world and carry the stigma of his father’s past. He thought about Cho’s unborn daughter, understanding why her mother clutched the swell of her abdomen. A familiar burst of outrage burned within him.
A house like Grimmauld would be scary for a kid. If Draco hadn’t been living in terror for two years during the war, he might have been uneasy here, even without the distinctive decorations and cursed objects Mother had talked about. He guessed that Potter’s childhood had been too miserable for him to care much about the place, aside from making it safe for Teddy. At least Draco’s room had been fully refurbished and was brightly lit, if old-fashioned. He didn’t care for the view, however. In his life, the sight from his bedroom window had shown him the wonders of a luxurious garden, the strange and wonderful world below the surface of the Black Lake, and the enchanting riverbed behind Aunt Andromeda’s house. Seeing another row of townhouses beyond a small fenced garden had no appeal. Draco knew he should’ve been grateful, and he was, of course, but still. London was ugly. What would it take to convince Potter to ditch this place and move in with him once the Manor was rebuilt?
For the fifth time, Draco entered the chamber that his ancestors had built for purposes he didn’t approve of. He did have to thank them, though, for giving him the perfect place to destroy Horcruxes without endangering anyone or anything. A spiral was carved in the rough stone floor, runes etched around it.
“Master Draco is not fine, what is Master Harry thinking, Master Harry should have brought Master Draco to Kreacher earlier, poor Master Regulus would be appalled, Master Harry has no sense of logic—”
“Yes, love, I have not forgotten, but you should think about an heir. Your proclivities aside, Astoria is a lovely young woman.”
Draco kept his gaze locked on the text and reminded him to use a Glamour. The ones they’d chosen to hide themselves were subtle: the shape of their eyes, the colour of their hair—a shade darker for Draco, a ruby undertone for Harry. It was more than enough. Harry had abandoned his obsession with round-shaped glasses a few years back, and with his long hair and beard, he wasn’t his father’s mirror image at all. Draco, with his short, artfully ruffled hair, pierced ears, elegant borderless glasses and full sleeve tattoo concealing the Dark Mark, didn’t look like a Pureblood prat anymore, so Glamouring himself was almost too much. They were safe.
Harry takes the hand lingering in his hair, and brings it to his lips. “And you?” He doesn’t need to ask a clearer question; it’s part of their routine.
They were so different, but that made it all the more interesting. Malfoy was still prickly and haughty because that was just who he was, but he was no longer condescending or cruel. He hadn’t been in a long time, honestly. The biggest fights they’d had since third year were often when Malfoy was genuinely angry, not because he was poking him to see how long it’d take for him to break. Without him, Harry wasn’t sure he’d have appreciated his stay in the Chamber that much.
The air entering his lungs reminds him of all the times he held his breath underwater to empty his mind. The colours of the world surface again. He has his glasses on; they’re crooked. A hand straightens them, and Harry tilts his head up and lets out a watery giggle. It’s not even funny, but he can’t help it. Malfoy is crouched at eye-level with him, because Harry is sitting on the pavement and resting against a wall like a rag doll. He doesn’t remember how he got there.
“The young ones will listen to your orders if you only try it once, as they don’t belong to any specific human. Afterwards, they start to wonder who you are, so it doesn’t really work more than once with the same owl. We used to breed them at the Manor.”
Both of them were now pouting, and it would be funny if it didn’t happen so often. Thankfully, it never lasted: they were both helpful, even if Sirius could be quite pig-headed. He was still struggling with the effects of the Dementors and the reality of a Malfoy sleeping with his adult godson. Said Malfoy did get him a trial and gave Pettigrew to the Aurors, but grudges were hard to get rid of.
Potter grinned, as if he thought Snarky Draco was funny. Since the world had turned upside down, it wouldn’t even surprise him that much.
He thought about it for a second. Yule was on the twenty-second, and it was a Saturday, so he’d be busy celebrating in bed, fully expecting Harry to comply with his wishes. The following day, perhaps? Yes, that would work. He said as much.
Pinching the bridge of his nose under his glasses, the Man-Who-Lived let out an exasperated sigh, before locking eyes with the older wizard. “Can you prepare the documents for that? Just in case.”
“Of course. Just try to use the door next time. Hogwarts will show you where it is.” Slytherin crossed his arms. “But you need to live, both of you. Face your future and become someone you can be proud of. Do it for you—not for your family, your friends, or anyone else.”
“So,” Harry declared with that wry grin Draco loved so much, “Bacon, eggs, milk. We can make an omelette.”
He waved his wand at the paper, circling “Dealing with the Dursleys” wordlessly. Draco crossed his arms. This was probably the easiest part of their endeavour, but he wasn’t sure how to pull it off yet. It would be easy to bespell the Dursleys, but the Ministry would notice—oh, no, they wouldn’t. Draco gasped and snapped his fingers. “The trace!” he whispered with a shark-like grin on his lips. “He’s nine, the trace isn’t active!”
publishes a picture of his tear-stained face? Mrs Weasley would swoop down on him like a mama bird and never let him leave the Burrow. He contemplates the idea of going home, but he’s not sure he can Apparate yet. He’s still a bit wary of his stomach. So, he stares at the pub, located where Borgin and Burke’s used to be. The facade is decorated with hundreds of fairy lights from a Christmas ornament contest two years ago. Nobody questions why the owner chose to keep them there: it turns the Brewtiful Mandrake into a beacon in an otherwise unwelcoming street. If the sight is supposed to bring some Christmas cheer into Harry’s heart, it’s failing, and not only because it’s early March. He’s so bloody lonely.
Said Slytherin had a wistful expression when they reached a small hilltop, and Harry found his attention diverted from the admittedly gorgeous landscape to Malfoy’s delicate features. A snowflake was stuck on his long, dark brown eyelashes, and the tip of his nose was pink from the cold. He had the aristocratic facial structure of a Black, more obvious now that he was older—and while his grey eyes often reminded Harry of Sirius, under the pale sun, they were adorned with specks of blue, like dots of paint swimming in liquid silver. Harry had to look away before he made a fool of himself since Malfoy had developed a sixth sense to detect when Harry was staring.
It’s been 18 months since the Battle of Hogwarts. It took a year to rebuild the castle, to make the grounds safe again. In September, Draco walked through the massive doors, fully expecting a steep road ahead of him. He wasn’t wrong.
He could’ve left it at that. Could’ve discarded the idea that had sprouted in his brain after hearing his family history—after learning that he owed his olive skin tone and unruly hair to ancestors who’d dwelt far from England. He’d almost done it; he’d nearly forgotten his plans. But he didn’t, not entirely.
Draco snorts. “Aside from all the sand in my hair, and eating too much calamari, it’s a good day.” He pauses, and exhales slowly. “We should fuck in the car.”
“Malfoy, I’d have left you in Turkey if you annoyed me.” Wondering what happened to bring doubts to his friend’s mind, he reached out and squeezed his wrist, marvelling at the softness of his skin. “What brought this on?”
Draco sat on the couch, flushing a little at the memories of what they’d done on it so many times this week, and he watched the lights on the tree blink on and off. His feet were sore from standing around so much, and his head hurt a bit because Teddy had been so noisy when he opened his presents. It was over now, and wasn’t that kind of a relief? Merlin knew Draco loved his family, but an entire afternoon at Andi’s house with a kid running around with too much sugar in his veins was exhausting. Still, he’d often disliked the moment where the party ended. There was something sad about the sudden silence once everyone had left or gone to bed. Something lonely. Melancholic. He felt a hint of that right now, but he could hear Harry moving things around in the next room, and it kept those emotions at bay. Draco focused on that, then replayed the holidays in his head.
So, it was a bleary-eyed Draco who discovered their next destination in the morning, when he happened to glance at the map stored in his half-full suitcase and noticed the brand new contours of another country.
“You’re fine, Malfoy.” He watches the fire’s erratic dance and scratches his head, turning his hair into an even bigger mess. “I was supposed to be in Slytherin. Begged the Hat to sort me elsewhere.”
That was a glaring loophole he’d only noticed after realising he didn’t have a wand anymore: while he was asked to live outside the Magical World and surrender his wand (which actually belonged to his grandfather and wasn’t the one he’d gotten from Ollivanders at eleven), nothing said he couldn’t practice magic if he wanted to. Since it would require visiting a wandmaker and thus, the world he was exiled from, he just decided to get used to doing things by hand.
“I tried that already, you know. They can feel your presence. So we’ll never know if they’re really alive like in the movie, or if they’re just toys.” Teddy’s lower lip wobbles. “Do you want a biscuit?”
Life goes on peacefully for the next forty-eight hours until Scorpius somehow inverts gravity in his room. In a panic, Draco attempts to get him out—what if the spell stops and Scorpius falls from the ceiling?—but as soon as he steps into the room, the world turns upside down, and he almost retches all over his son’s toys. Shaking, he crawls towards him, noting that the lampshade would benefit from a Cleaning Charm once in a while. Scorpius is pouting, cheeks puffed up and lower lip jutting out.
"Happy to help." Draco fingered the edge of his glass, distracted, then dug in at his stomach's loud protest.
Harry’s entire face lit up and made Draco’s empty stomach twist pleasantly. “You’d do that with me?”
“That wasn’t a kiss, Potter.” Draco waves his wand, and the cigarette disappears. The holster at his wrist is equipped with a concealment spell, so his wand is gone in the blink of an eye.
At some point, both Draco and Potter were laying side by side under the duvet, comfortable in each other’s presence for the first time.
There were countless memories he wanted to forget. He told Slytherin how walking with Potter in the Chamber was the only bright spot in his life at the moment.
Draco was beautiful. Was it okay to say that about a boy? Harry didn’t know, but he couldn’t believe his future self was married to him. He was so lucky! Would he end up marrying the young version of Draco when he grew up? Would they be friends?
He gets another hideous Weasley jumper, a book from Granger, sweets, and a tiny cactus (he laughs and says he can’t keep plants alive, so Longbottom chose well). He also gets a preserved cucumber from Lovegood. Not a surprise. She believes many vegetables have pest-repelling properties. If said pests exist is another story.
An exaggerated nod was his answer before his big grey eyes widened as he took in the room. “Ooooh, pweeetty!”
He’d also remembered that, as far as he knew (and when it came to Malfoy, he knew a lot), Malfoy hadn’t reacted to her either.
“Okay,” Harry continues, batting his hand away, and he’s grinning like a madman, the prat, “get ready to be covered in muck.”
He touched the sink, taking it all in. It looked even more beautiful now; he was in awe. Reverently, he admired the designs on the tiles, seashells and fossils that made the bathroom look like it came straight from an ancient Roman home. Harry remembered it because they’d just learned about mosaics and past civilisations in school. He couldn’t wait to see his room.
, and Draco knew that if Lucius had ever seen the warden wearing it, the man would’ve been a permanent guest in the dungeons, at best. Draco couldn’t care less if the jumper was too big and distasteful, it kept his upper body from turning to ice. He ignored Potter’s thoughtless comment and closed the door behind him.
Sneaking a glance at Malfoy’s thigh, Harry scratched the back of his head, once more ashamed of their fight in Myrtle’s bathroom. “How do we get back out?”
He knew he wasn't hallucinating: Harry had become more tactile lately and his eyes often lingered on Draco's body. But Draco didn't want to deal with the awkwardness of a one-night stand, and he wasn't quite sure what to do. He couldn't forget that Harry had been hard when he'd hugged Draco in the desert, and the sizeable bulge intrigued him, but what would be the point if it was just sex? Draco wanted Harry to himself all day and night, forever. So what if he was possessive?
“Okay. Okay, I’m in.” He breathed out and let out a watery laugh. “I—Magic would take your land’s history and your tastes into consideration, so it wouldn’t look shabby. We can have a dog, and, maybe we can do something with all this space. Like, fruit trees and a Quidditch pitch. And another Winter Wonderland. But not next year, because we’re going to the tropics, and I’m rambling, please stop me.”
When Scorpius’ energy started to decrease, the young man picked him up, swung him around and kissed his round cheeks, filled with so much love that it was almost painful. The dog was already on the way back home, so he followed him, keeping Scorpius close.
With a quick nod towards the elf (who still worshipped Harry as the avenger of Master Regulus), Harry handed him the ice cream. “Hi Kreacher. Those should go into the stasis cupboard, please?”
“Brats and cauldrons making life difficult for Kreacher, what would poor Master Regulus say,” Kreacher muttered.
Detaching his eyes from Malfoy’s long legs, Harry shakes his head. “I can only take so much bagpipes before going mental, so I’m taking a break.”
A sudden popping sound erased any stray thought from Harry’s mind. Warrington and Lavender held the torn half of a cracker with childish glee.
. Very interesting result.” Malfoy looks at his nails, and back at Harry. “I had no idea it worked on humans.” He rubs his hands on his trousers (black jeans this time) and stands on his feet. “Can you get up?”
“Santa” didn’t stay for long, and Draco doubted he was standing guard in front of the door to catch him, so once there were no more giggles and footsteps from his coworkers, he left his hiding place and straightened his robes, before sitting on his chair and typing the beginning of a sentence. Why was it so hard to concentrate? All he could picture was a dishevelled Potter with his legs spread as Draco buried himself deep inside him, or a grouchy Potter who hadn’t slept too well and burrowed his face in Draco’s shirt. Both enjoyable images, but not helpful. Not to mention, Potter would pick him up after work for their first Friday night as a couple, and time had decided to slow down just like on the eve of a holiday. While Draco was no longer writing about Quaffles, this week’s article was due in a few hours, and he hated every word of it, so his brain clung to any available distraction.
“Will you let me find out?” he asked, and Scorpius nodded with enthusiasm. “Great! So, for tonight, do you have anything else?”
“Sorry, were you asleep?” Harry’s attempt to sound like he hadn’t gone through a terrifying situation failed as his voice sounded so pitiful. His sleep had been mostly free of nightmares, but when they happened, Draco always cared for him. His expression now was quite unusual, however.
Draco’s lips formed a pout. “No, I can do it.” He’d make the best damn quiche in the whole world and Harry would never see it coming. That’d teach him to doubt Draco’s abilities. “Just read the recipe to me.”
His Godfather perked up and dragged Remus away under Mother’s unamused glance. Draco stifled a laugh, and when Mother was busy sharing tales of his childhood’s shenanigans with Aunt Andromeda, he laced his fingers with Harry’s and started walking away before Dumbledore could bother them. After discovering the truth about Number 3, Privet Drive, which had become necessary when the shade of the Dark Lord had forever been banished to the realm of the dead, the Headmaster kept trying to invite them for tea.
, Harry thought. Far above them, a light moved, and Harry smiled as he remembered Draco’s story about the slow comet. “Kiss me? No one’s watching.”
Muttering a reply, Draco fished a bottle of water out of his bag and drank a few large gulps, almost choking when his eyes met Salazar's. The Founder was grinning like a loon. They'd forgotten to put him back into the bag and he'd probably seen Draco drooling on Potter's shoulder all night long. Ugh.
Malfoy carefully unpinned the parchment and handed it to him, but Harry quickly realised he couldn’t read any of it. “Is that—”
Two hours is too long. If it’s already that bad, Harry definitely doesn’t want to see how it’ll be later today. Cho must have noticed his unease, because she tells him to use the Apparition point between Whizz Hard Books and the
Oh! He had so many questions, now that he knew his parents hadn’t been drunks! He fidgeted, and older Harry chuckled.
“Remember what you said you’d show me if I was good?” Draco purrs, feeling the pull of a smirk at the corner of his lips.
“I’m sorry.” And he was. He clung to Draco, unwilling to let go, until Draco mentioned ice cream, because when Draco was uncomfortable or emotional, he craved sugar. That hazelnut flavour he bought yesterday woke his hunger. “Let’s go home.”
There weren’t many ways to introduce Little Draco to the Muggle world and hold his interest. He was already following Lucius’ footsteps, knowing absolutely nothing about what lay beyond Malfoy Manor and believing his family was superior to all others. Draco could work with that: familial superiority was better than blood supremacy. That part came during his first year at Hogwarts when Granger kept beating his scores. He still had some time.
Draco often thought he could write a book about Potter’s infuriating habits and turn it into an instant best-seller. It’d read like a scientific paper, mainly because Potter’s brain came up with genuinely baffling ideas that no one in their right mind could understand. Even Granger couldn’t. To start with, Harry arranged the few books he possessed in the wrong order; he didn’t group them by author or genre like any sane person, or throw them on the shelf in messy piles like Draco, no; he lined them up in reverse-alphabetical order. Timothy Zahn should not be first, no matter how much Draco enjoyed his stories. Harry also had a hard time throwing away chipped ceramics, bought low-quality spoons that hurt Draco’s lips, and stocked up on those ridiculous 2-in-1 soap/shampoo bottles For Men (all right, they smelled amazing, but
today, and Teddy is obsessed. He places all the toys Harry bought for him in a circle and observes them with an adorable pout. Harry ruffles his purple hair.
Harry counted seven flashes in the five minutes since he’d walked away from the Apparition point. These paparazzi must have a sixth sense because they hadn’t been that bad in a while. Did they know they were about to see something juicy? A few years ago, Harry would’ve bolted, or yelled at them, flipped them off, and hexed them. After Skeeter went to Azkaban and even when she came back (and kept her job!), they left him more or less alone—his life lacked gossip fodder when he stopped dating casually, and he had too many satisfied customers to see an impact when his business was attacked. Not to mention, they couldn’t do it openly without losing their funding and risking fines for defamation.
The Weaselette answered one of his silent questions, nodding at the pictures of the toddler. “This is Teddy. Harry’s godson.”
“That thing looks nothing like a fruit.” Draco squinted at it. “Not even if a cucumber mated with a pineapple. What is wrong with Muggle scientists? Imagine if Scorpius had developed an interest in them when he was younger. The confusion would be traumatic!” He’d chosen not to introduce him to the platypus for this very reason. A sentence caught his eye, and he leaned forward, pushing Harry’s hand away from the page. “What do you mean they have lungs inside their—they breathe through—no.” He crossed his arms on his chest, and Harry snorted. “You’re having me on,” Draco insisted. “You’ve Charmed those books.”
Draco filed the information in the corner of his mind, resolving to ask Harry later. He hadn’t seen his cousin often, even after his aunt and Mother reconciled when Teddy was five years old. “Perhaps, but there are many other possibilities.”
“It still looks like you just moved in, Harry,” Hermione said with a disapproving frown, grabbing a fresh lemon biscuit from the tray on the kitchen counter. She bit into it and moaned. “Gosh, Kreacher is going all out, isn’t he?”
Draco opened his eyes with a soft gasp and twisted his body to make sure it wasn’t a dream. Then he scoffed. If he’d been dreaming, Harry wouldn’t have globs of drool in his short beard. He was so scruffy in his sleep. Merlin, but Draco loved that prat. And he wasn’t scared, which astonished him since he’d always been terrified of opening himself to others, of letting them see him. But he’d never had that issue with Harry; he’d shown him the worst of himself, the darkest parts—was that why he was okay with this? With being vulnerable? Draco pushed people away before they could know too much, but that wasn’t a problem with Harry, was it? Draco had nothing left to hide from him.
He’d gone through most of his playlist and three chapters when his timer indicated that he should add his sliced gurdyroot to the cauldron. As soon as he did that, the liquid seemed to freeze. The recipe called this step hibernation, an odd result when gurdyroot and moondew were combined in the correct order. The potion would mature over the next few hours without requiring supervision. Satisfied, Draco left to take a shower, keeping the monitoring spell in place just in case. He scrubbed his skin with his favourite soap, then applied lotion on his whole body and another in his hair—potion fumes had terrible consequences on hair follicles and could clog pores. Draco refused to turn into Snape. Not to mention how much Potter despised the smell that clung to Draco when he’d been brewing. It was a persistent scent, quite similar to cigarettes. Only a few products made it disappear completely.
He left Diagon Alley and its early evening crowd and entered the much quieter Horizont Alley, which was less about shopping and more about eating and having a good time. Well, his favourite bookshop was there, too, and he only liked it because they didn’t treat him like royalty, but to be fair the shop could use some cleaning charms. He glanced in the window when he passed by, noting the lack of decorations and wondering if he should move H.E.A.L.E.R. to this street. He’d have to research it first; perhaps the local business owners had another association breathing down their neck. Did Knockturn Alley have one? Requiring each shop to be as dusty and sinister as possible? Creevey and his goonies weren’t that bad, though. They’d accepted his stance against Boy-Who-Lived-related Halloween decorations without any fuss, at least.
Draco’s heart leaps in his chest. It takes a second before he realises that he’s tall again, and Harry is grinning and squeezing his hands, and it’s his Harry, twenty-four years old and in love with Draco. They’re kissing before Draco can say anything, grasping at each other’s clothes and crying, and Harry takes Draco’s face between his palms and brushes Draco’s nose, cheeks and eyelids with his soft, slightly chapped lips. “I’m so proud of you. I love you so much, and you did it for me, you survived. I’ll never leave you again.”
Harry huffed and crossed his arms, but changed his mind when he nearly lost his balance. He climbed down from the barrel he was sitting on, still glaring at Malfoy, who was busy trying to call random House Elves.
It was Harry’s turn to stand up, and he looked at the sky, his determination growing. “Sal, are we on a timer here?”
Mother would love her new scarf and Andromeda would be grateful for the set of cutlery—she’d complained that her current one had sharp edges and bent too easily. Teddy would, hopefully, fall in love with his Apprentice Potioneer Kit Volume II. Harry—well, there were a few enchanted lubes and massage oils Draco would give him in private, thank you very much, but Draco had also asked the Hogwarts Headmistress if she could send him every detention slip from the Marauders, minus Pettigrew. He’d bound them into an entertaining book he’d titled Almanac of Mischief. Harry didn’t care for
Lines appeared, weak, flickering, drawing crude dunes and rocks and smoke, then vanishing, and sketching jagged lines until a continent formed—Africa. Draco flicked his wand at the parchment, and the drawing switched back to the landscape it had first shown. If Harry had made this map, Draco would’ve had more than one scathing remark about it. Instead, because it was Hermione and Draco’s work, Draco focused on improving its accuracy with a stubborn look.
“I wasn’t ready, you know.” He messes with his hair again, which really doesn’t need any help in Draco’s opinion. “Gin understood that. She never pushed.”
Malfoy interrupted the snooping by catching him in the act. It resulted in a bargain, followed by an agreement, and now Harry worked for his childhood nemesis and fetched him ice cream every week. And kissed him. Quite a lot. How the tables had turned.
“Is that for me?” he whispered, and the reptile nodded. Nervous laughter escaped him, but he quickly smothered it, fearing his family would hear. When he took the paper and read it, he could only blink, as if it would help shatter what must have been an illusion.
“You thought wrong.” He rolls his sleeves further and Harry looks closely. His inner left forearm is solid black, covering the Dark Mark. It’s black all around, really, but the ink contours his skin on the other side to form three flowers. Above, the ink gradually fades, and as the sleeve goes all the way up, it reveals a complicated design on his deltoid. It looks like the round stained glass inside a church. It’s gorgeous. His other arm is simple in comparison: it depicts black smoke swirling from his wrist to his shoulder. It’s realistic and Harry wants to see more. “I’m not sure if I want to keep this arm like that or add something in the smoke,” Malfoy explains. “I’m not showing you the other ones here.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the number of decorations and lights marking the entrance of the Drunk Thestral Inn; they made up for the bare establishments of Horizont Alley, for sure. If this were a Muggle pub, the electricity bill would be outrageous. They even had a life-sized Santa climbing up and down the wall.
Muggles weren’t inferior; he knew that. If they were, no magical being would ever have been burned at the stake. But they scared him, and he wanted to protect himself and his world. If that meant sealing wizardkind away, he thought it would be worth it. Muggleborns were a liability who made no effort to learn anything about the culture of the world they were entering.
He ended up hugging the pillow to his chest and staring at the wall. Back in their time, he could spend hours daydreaming, content. This bed wasn’t comfy enough for that, but tomorrow, they’d live at Number 3, and their new bed would have an expensive mattress, luxury sheets… he couldn’t wait.
Alright, that was stupid of him. He stared up at Malfoy, whose white-blond hair formed a halo around his head with the sun shining behind him. His attraction for him worsened, and he pushed it aside to make sure he wasn’t walking into a trap. Salazar’s portrait had taught him enough to protect himself, and his career at Hogwarts helped him daily. Designing and teaching a brand-new curriculum destined to do more than bring students through exams? A breath of fresh air. Harry’s students were already competent in Defence by the time they reached their O.W.L.s. His lesson plans included bits and pieces from Auror training material; detecting danger was now second-nature to him. It played a significant role for his third-year students, so if he got taken out by a trap because he was too busy flirting with Malfoy, he’d deserve the humiliation.
“Draco darling, please explain why the Headmistress Flooed me, fully believing you’ve kidnapped Harry Potter.”
“I just paid you a compliment! You’d better savour it, Chosen One.” Draco leaned down and caught Harry’s lips between his teeth before slipping his tongue into his mouth. He moved his hips gently, focused on the hands caressing his back and cupping his arse, and reached beneath the fabric of Harry’s pants to free his cock. Languid strokes matched the rhythm of their kiss until Harry came all over Draco’s fist.
Draco closed his eyes and basked in Harry’s affection. His left hand found its way under his shirt, and the feeling of Harry’s ring against his skin grounded him. He let out a sigh. “Yeah, I’m good.”
Honestly, the only problem with sleek, clean, minimalistic décor was that clutter was even more noticeable. Draco's brain whirred as he attempted to remember what Harry would find, and all he could do was frantically eye the place in search of underwear or sex toys that he may have left somewhere—like on the coffee table. While he did his best to conceal his growing panic, the tension in his shoulders gave him away.
and found three Disillusioned wizards and one witch much closer than they should be. The witch, dressed in full Auror regalia, dropped her concealment charm and walked up to the gate, stopping when the wards vibrated. Draco’s stomach dropped.
Before he opened his mouth, Draco squeezed his hip. “We can get out with a lantern. If we can’t grab the one we need, another will do the trick.” Another squeeze, followed by a kiss behind Harry’s left ear. “Come on. You’re the Gryffindor here; don’t be a wuss.”
Harry dragged him away from the Furbys because he didn’t want one of those things in his house. Hopefully, by the time Draco got his vault back, he’d forget all about them. “Draco, there’s a really cool Lego statue by the escalator—”
When he put Scorpius to bed for a nap, he wondered what to cook for supper. He wanted to make something for Potter. He’d fixed himself and Scorpius sandwiches for lunch and had noticed that the fridge was full, to his delight. Some roast with butternut squash? He knew many recipes but had never been able to truly enjoy cooking for someone else at the hostel. And Scorpius was a little monster when it came to vegetables, so since Draco didn’t believe in forcing him to eat something he couldn’t swallow, he made sure to cook with ingredients his son already liked. If he was feeling adventurous, he’d give him a bite of something new and see what he thought about it.
When Ron Weasley, left on his own in their original compartment, found Harry again, Harry apologised for leaving and invited him to sit next to him. The compartment was crowded, snide glances were exchanged, but each time someone said something nasty, Hedwig screeched and looked ready to murder them. It was an effective method.
Harry broke the kiss and fumbled with Draco’s pyjamas bottoms. “Fuck, let me—” He groaned. “Why are you wearing those?”
,” Draco advised, not that Harry would. The thought of the entirety of wizarding Britain trampling on the grounds amused and horrified him in equal measure. “No need to trigger the panic wards.”
Draco sits up, reaches into the bag Harry hadn’t seen him carry, and hands him a can of cider. Wizards don’t use cans; Harry is fascinated by the idea of Draco going shopping at Tesco. He sits cross-legged, takes a sip and decides he has a new favourite brand.
“I’m delighted you find this funny.” Draco’s hold on him was strong, and the tone of his voice hid his emotions well, but not enough to fool Harry.
He expected the usual polished stone, almost black with a shimmer of silver, but he was instead met with the most gorgeous fire opal. The Malfoy Crest shone in its centre.
The gleam in Hermione’s eyes makes him groan, as she seems to read his mind. “Are you afraid of Ron?”
Harry’s relief was overwhelming, and as soon as Draco was out of the water, he hugged him, smiling at Draco’s startled protest.
Harry laughs until he’s wheezing, and Malfoy joins him, going as far as hiccuping. They settle and the grass behind them rustles as a gentle wind blows. The longer Harry watches the stars, the bigger the sky seems. It’s almost like falling, except he can feel the cold ground against his back.
In the halo of light cast by his wand, the remains of the Lockhart-induced cave-in brought back memories of helplessness and betrayal that Harry fought to keep at the back of his mind. Occlumency would be useful if only he’d ever managed to learn it properly. He took a few deep breaths and rose to his feet, looking for something to focus on that would help with his scattered thoughts.
Draco sniffed haughtily. “You underestimate my talent.” He had, after all, redecorated their house after they got married.
Harry had talked about the insane House Elf who sometimes agreed to buy food for him but explained how unreliable he was and why he often asked for help from his friends. Kreacher liked him now, since he’d gotten to keep Regulus’ locket, but it didn’t mean he wasn’t a taciturn little shit. For his basic needs, weather permitting, Harry used Sirius’ motorcycle to go to the village, but the local Tesco was small and lacked many ingredients he liked to cook with. Malfoy’s relief when he’d told him he had a bike as well had made him grin: overprotective Draco wouldn’t let Scorpius climb on a motorcycle until his fifties. He also lacked a license, so the bike meant he had some measure of freedom in a part of the country that had no public transport whatsoever.
He rolled his eyes and extracted the relevant memories once he found his wand, which had fallen between the bed and the nightstand.
The fact that Potter had produced two Patroni in this state was nothing short of a miracle. The wand-movement alone—Draco shouldn’t be surprised: it was
With a long-suffering sigh, Ona bumped her shoulder against Warrington’s. “Being a Slytherin was hard in those days.”
Draco shuddered and pushed him away, tucking himself back into his pants. “You’re the worst!” Then, he remembered the first picture he saw. “I wonder if Transfiguring your—”
’d one of the books he’d taken with him through time, a 2008 release of banned runic rituals only certain Unspeakables had the clearance to read. It included time travel, but also powerful concealment magic that could make a Dark Lord’s plans very easy to realise. With this and the invisibility cloak, the Ministry would never notice anything.
Damn, thank Merlin there was no alcohol involved tonight. Why was he such a blabbermouth? Was it the Malfoy effect? Or perhaps Harry was just too lonely. That was more likely. Neville had teased him about his tendency to talk too much when he spent long stretches of time on his own. On the other hand, it was funny to see the Prince of Slytherin so gobsmacked.
Draco’s initial reflex was to correct the falsehood. “Scorp, cucumbers are vegetables. Don’t you remember picking them up from Grandma’s garden?”
“Or you’re not dating?” Hermione gasps and puts her teacup down. “I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed, I keep forgetting casual sex is a thing, with everyone around us being in a relationship. Is that why you didn’t tell us? Or is it too fresh, and you didn’t want to jinx it? Oh, is she a Muggle?”
The next day, Potter sits on the couch with Draco to work on his Potions essay. Draco can’t help but take a discrete look at what he’s writing, and when he sees some sort of nonsense about the properties of Ashwinder venom (it does
Harry could barely hold onto it, and he was getting flustered. As much as Draco enjoyed teasing him, he knew it wouldn’t be fair right now. Instead, he took back the vial, uncorked it and brought it to Harry’s lips. He then helped him wash away the taste with a glass of water and waited until the set of his shoulders relaxed. “Feeling better?”
The owl doesn’t let Harry ignore it, hooting and extending its leg. Harry takes the piece of parchment and unrolls it while Draco closes the window.
Draco rears back. “What, you think I’m a law-abiding citizen who would follow an arbitrary set of guidelines aimed at keeping roommates out of each other’s bed? I’m shocked, no, I’m wounded, Potter!” He pecks Harry’s lips. “Unless you’ve suddenly decided it’s a bad idea, I do hope to fuck you until you forget your name.” His grin grows and Harry’s face is on fire, then Draco slides off his lap and slouches, the back of his head resting against the wall. “That’d be quite a feat, and maybe it’ll deflate your oversized ego. Imagine the headlines: Harry Potter, Defeated by the Sword of Slytherin.”
He was reminded of Kreacher’s absence when his stomach let out a loud and undignified growl as he was sprawled on the couch, enjoying Harry’s fingers toying with his hair. He sighed and squirmed, then met Harry’s amused gaze and rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potty, I’m starving.”
“You can have it.” Draco wants to hug him and jump up and down. He doesn’t do it, because the floor is slippery and he sees such an endeavour ending badly. “Can I ask for a small share? Gin deserves it.”
As he turns around, he’s forced to follow the movement. He knows where they’re going; they’ll walk past the Leaky, to the newly built entertainment district. Harry wonders if he can even get to the pub, or if he’ll be carried before he can touch the wall. He’s two seconds away from blasting his way out of the crowd with a curse, when he’s shoved into a lamppost. He loses his glasses — and that’s when he realises he can’t breathe. His chest is stuck in a vice and there’s a thudding in his ears.
The door closes, and Draco hears Scorpius babbling, an endless stream of words muffled by the walls.
Her eyelashes are still wet when Hermione speaks again. “You tried to tell me, and I didn’t listen.” Her voice sounds tiny and defeated. “I thought if I pushed you, you’d come to your senses, but I didn’t see—” a shuddering intake of breath interrupts her, followed by a huff, “I didn’t realise what was happening to you. I thought, if it worked for me, and Ron, Ginny, George, Seamus, Dean, everyone we know, surely it’d work for you too. Oh, I was such an idiot!” She sniffles. Her hand is holding his so tight it hurts. “Is M—Draco seeing that?”
The eggs were doing something weird. Maybe Draco shouldn’t have broken the shells? In potions, eggs ended up dissolving, but he didn’t think milk and flour had any property that could do that. It was getting quite lumpy.
He’s away into Magical London right now, looking for books on household and home maintenance spells so he can fix the pipes, while Harry has his godson over for the first time.
He threw the covers onto the floor, stumbled out of bed, his scream still on his lips. His stomach cramped. He didn’t reach the door, instead collapsing and letting out a gut-wrenching sob. He muffled the noise by biting into his fist.
What came out of Harry’s throat was an odd wheezing breath and he nodded. “Yeah, that—that sounds good.”
Potter had perfected the art of “eyebrow arching”, as he demonstrated in response. “Why, Professor Malfoy, how generous of you. Perhaps you’d be willing to read to me?”
“Spent enough time in the hospital wing to have some idea. Don’t blind me.” He blinked to erase the white spots from his vision.
Malfoy was a wreck. The white light of their wands accentuated the gauntness of his features and made the scars on his left cheek and down his neck shine; whatever had made Malfoy so bloody smug before the war was gone, and Harry felt a twinge of sympathy for him. This tended to happen a bit too often since his trial.
Merlin, Potter’s hair looked messier than ever, and Draco wanted to pull on it. He cleared his throat. “Good evening to you too, Potty. I have a mystery to solve.”
“To answer your question, no, I still live at the Manor.” Draco looks like his nose picked up a whiff of something nasty. “I do not have the means to seek another place.”
Harry’s hair was a disastrous mess and he was only wearing a pair of pyjama pants. Draco was too distracted to feel anything at the sight that his younger self would have killed to witness (his current self as well, to be perfectly fair). He still noticed the multiple scars littering his skin. There were so many of them. Harry also had Muggle tattoos - yet something he would most likely ask about later but couldn’t really bring himself to care about right now. What caught his eye most of all was the vial of potion in his right hand.
Harry’s smile is weak, but his affection for the cranky elf calms him down. “Yeah, I’ll do that.” He takes a sip. “Thank you for the tea, Kreacher. You’re a good elf.”
Draco didn’t realise what he meant until he and Harry, still dripping wet and wearing sweatpants, followed him back to the kitchen.
Before he can ponder this more in depth, Malfoy raises an eyebrow, and Harry croaks, “Er—hi?”. He can’t see much on Malfoy’s face with those lights blinking in and out, but he makes out his smirk.
Now Harry was biting his lip and clasping his hands together. Draco shrugged; what did Harry know about French cuisine, anyway? “Is there something funny?” he asked, pushing the tart in the blazing hot oven.
As they walked together, Harry kept casting subtle spells to keep him warm because Malfoy didn’t want to expose his hands to the elements to wave his wand. It delighted Harry that Malfoy had swallowed his pride to ask him for help, but it said a lot about his desperation since Malfoy was so hung up on the Fiendfyre life-debt and hated owing anyone anything. Especially Harry.
Draco will have to add magic to Scorpius’ tutoring, and it’s a bit scary—Draco is no teacher. But he can’t expect Harry to come home from work just to teach even more, so he’ll learn. At least, Teddy will be more than happy to do it this summer. It’s not like they care about not using magic outside of school.
Draco’s heart was beating so fast, it was a wonder he wasn’t dizzy. He heard Scorpius babbling to his toys just below his room and tried to focus on his voice, until Harry came back upstairs, holding a wooden box.
Slytherin smiled, soft eyes only confirming that Harry was absolutely, completely gay. “You can do anything. I’ve seen it in the past few days. You boys have so much potential. Never doubt it.”
They don’t leave the dorms until a worried elf comes to check on them. They go back as soon as they finish dinner, their presence reassuring the staff that the Golden Boy didn’t get murdered. Draco is jittery, impatient and aroused, and Harry isn’t much better if the way his hands touch Draco’s arse is any hint.
“What about cleaning and cooking?” At Harry’s raised eyebrows, he rolled his eyes. “I can do both. I’ve lived as a Muggle long enough. Turns out cooking is a bit like potions.”
Harry, instead of offering his hands, stepped forward and hugged the man. Sirius shuddered against him and embraced him so tightly that it almost hurt, but Harry let him. He knew Sirius needed hugs. He’d lost all his friends and had just gotten out of a horrible prison. And the embrace brought a familiarity that made Harry relax instantly and burrow his face in the crook of Sirius’ neck. He didn’t remember any detail about his time with his parents, but he recognised
“Oh, I didn’t see that. I’ll help you rebuild it, don’t worry.” This is the oddest part of this ridiculous situation: a few toys have left their spot on the carpet and followed Scorpius on the ceiling, some taking the fall better than others. Most toys, though, stayed put. The rug itself and the furniture haven’t moved, luckily. Scorpius could’ve been hurt. “Did you fall?” Draco asks, breathing a sigh of relief when his son clings to him and shakes his head. He still checks him over but doesn’t find any bruise or scratch. “Hold onto me, baby.”
“Would you blame them? I’d have thrown a tantrum if Mother had done that to me.” The thought makes Draco shudder. At fifteen, his trunk was home to more than chocolate frog cards.
. Scarhead, with his ridiculous hair and otherworldly eyes, was about to enter his bedroom—no, bedchamber, that was how it was called.
Teddy cuts Scorpius’ pancake in half, and continues, “Accidental magic stops when you get a way to channel it. So, wand.”
They passed the curve of the tunnel and found a split straight ahead. Choosing to head left, they noticed carvings on the walls, most of them snakes. Harry hissed at them, asking for directions. They didn’t reply but turned their head as if indicating they were on the right track. Or sending them to their death. Malfoy hesitated, but Harry pushed him forward (and got his hand slapped in return).
is teaching him things he didn’t know, opening his mind to traditions and old practices that are part of his heritage. He tells him how idiotic he is for choosing Divination and Potter laughs and replies that he’s aware.
“So do I.” Draco picks at his nails. “I hoped to welcome you in a more attractive part of the house, but I’m afraid I was unable to reach my room in time.” He hesitates, and when Harry doesn’t reply, his voice softens, and he adds, “There are too many memories here, and I’m not always quick enough to go upstairs.”
It startles Draco, who was probably expecting a few questions about what led him to cower in the corner. It’s bloody weird, how their roles are suddenly reversed.
“She wants to know if you keep me hostage.” She was part of the group of people who couldn’t get over Draco’s acquittal for a long time. After the elimination of the Dementors, she grudgingly agreed he wasn’t all bad, but she now acted like a nosy relative worried about Harry’s well-being despite having barely interacted with him for the entirety of Harry’s life. Hell, the longest conversation Harry had with her was an exchange of stilted greetings and well-wishes at Neville’s twentieth birthday.
George had been granted access through the wards so he could decorate the remaining trees and shrubs, or Conjure new ones. His magic was strong enough; they’d last for about a month. When word got around, Harry received numerous requests from friends and acquaintances who had children and hoped to bring them there, likely forgetting whose Manor used to stand on that snowy field. Most of Dumbledore’s Army wanted to participate, which was highly ironic.
Ron squeezed his forearm, smiled, and walked away, but suddenly stopped and turned around. His voice called out to him: “Oh, by the way, I’m grabbing some lunch, want to join me?”
Harry lets go of his arm, which he’s been holding a little too long. “Did you have plans? Mine are ruined.” Harry wanted to spend some time at the beach — there’s a small one he could Apparate to. It’s not accessible through land, and that makes it perfectly quiet. The town is a popular holiday destination and at the moment, it’s quite crowded. Harry might be feeling better, but it doesn’t mean he has the strength to mingle with hundreds of people.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek, laughter bubbling up in his throat, and in another Gryffindor move, laced his fingers with Malfoy’s. He made no effort to stop him, even under his mother’s gaze.
Harry learns about Draco’s food preferences, and Draco buys Harry’s favourite brand of coffee. If Harry wakes up screaming, it’s always followed by a polite knock at his bedroom door, and a sleepy, pyjamas-clad Draco brings him some tea, before going back to bed. They still don’t talk much, or even do much together, and when Harry receives a letter from Ron asking if they’ve killed each other yet, it makes him ponder their new reality. That reality is that Draco was a missing piece in Harry’s life; he brings him comfort. Harry is determined to do the same for him.
And she says “Hogwarts, dear?” and Draco knows, and he turns around so fast he almost falls from the stool. And Harry’s there, small and shy, messy hair taking over his head and baggy clothes hiding a body way too small for his age. Draco opens his mouth just as he sees a gleam in the little boy’s eyes. He holds out a shaking hand.
Officially, Malfoy was registered as a researcher of Non-Human Spiritous Apparitions, like Remus’ dad had been. And he did research them. He’d helped get rid of the Dementors by sending them back where they came from—an impressive achievement. But his true calling was offering his scrying services to those in need. Those who sometimes noticed that door in Carkitt Market.
Kreacher drew himself up and gasped. “Master Regulus would be honoured! Kreacher knows! Kreacher will go get Master Regulus clothes, yes, and he will be so happy that the beautiful Malfoy boy is wearing them!” With an excited and sinister cackle, he disappeared again.
“Ah, bliss!” Sitting in the shade, Malfoy rested his head against the wall of the canyon and pointed his wand at the sky, conjuring a parasol. “Next time, shall we head to Antarctica?”
They don’t attempt to kiss again for a while, but the tension between them is electric. On the second day of September, three days after Harry started work, Draco receives the confirmation of his Potions Mastery. Harry loves to see the relief on his face, the joy in his eyes, before he excuses himself to Floo-call his mother. He goes to France for most of the day, which is just as well, because the need to kiss him is unbearable.
. Everything else made it a different nation. Wizarding traditions shouldn’t be replaced by Muggle ones to make them feel better; at the very least, they should have the opportunity to celebrate both. He wasn’t sure what the solution was, but it wasn’t his father’s, it wasn’t Dumbledore’s, and it certainly wasn’t the Dark Lord’s.
It takes hours to cancel that spell, and Scorpius is too excited to sleep. He giggles until it’s well past midnight and Harry and Draco are exhausted. Teddy, who has always been a great kid, decides to bring Scorpius to the basement to spend the night. They’re hoping it’ll calm him down.
The gasp he lets out pains him. He blinks back tears, letting his vision return to normal. The wind blows his hair away from his forehead, but as there’s no one around to see his scar and ask for an autograph, he’s not bothered. He’s outside, far from the noise and the heat. Everything is fine. Well, the ball in his throat is still there, and he knows what’s coming next. He needs to sit down. There’s a short wall to his left, a few steps from the establishment, hidden in the shadows. His entire body is stiff as he walks there and hoists himself up on the wall, letting his legs dangle. The concrete is like ice under his thighs. It brings the weather to his awareness, and he shivers. The constriction in his throat tightens. He’s no longer about to pass out, he knows that, but now he’s stuck in a whirlwind, and all he wants to do is cry.
Clutching the box, Harry wets his lips. “I’m not worried, I’m just surprised. Why are you doing this?” Why do you care is not uttered.
Fawkes had a few feathers by the end of the week and didn’t leave Scorpius’ side unless Harry or Draco happened to be in the kitchen cutting up fruits. The bird would steal any fruit he could put his crooked beak on. The first time he’d done that, Harry hadn’t paid attention to his presence, focusing on rolling the dough for a tart. Fawkes ate every berry on the countertop in just a few seconds. Since then, fruits were watched closely.
When they had been called into Head Auror Robards office earlier that week, Harry was sure it would have something to do with the illegal love potion ring that had been buzzing around the Ministry rumor mill. What he didn’t expect was being greeted with a blown up headshot of none other than Draco Malfoy, scowling at him.
“Well yes, it was tasty, but that’s not the only reason we stay around.” Hermione looked earnestly at Draco. “You know that, right?”
“We should open a coffee shop.” Luna’s soft voice drifted across the garden as Draco took another round of blueberry scones out of the oven. “Your way with the french press is divine, and if other people could taste your baked goods...” she hummed in delight as she popped another morsel of the flakey pastry with clotted cream into her mouth. Draco let a slow smile cross his face as he maneuvered the tray of hot, fresh scones onto the cooling rack before brushing his hands off on the tea towel tucked into his waistband. He never imagined that he and Luna would become so close, but here they were at Draco’s gardenside flat, enjoying each other’s company and indulging in the fruits of their labor.
They weren’t spared a second glance as they stepped through the pub and out into Muggle London, and for that Draco was grateful. He just wanted to get home, to see Harry with his friends - their friends? - and then maybe, just maybe, he’d see a glimpse of the old Harry Potter he knew from school. Draco was well-aware that he, himself, was completely different from how he had been in school - he had been humbled by his probation and had done everything he could to become a better person - but he felt that his own change made sense. The quiet Harry Potter that was following him like a lost puppy, on the other hand… there had to be something to it.
” Harry was now nose to nose with Blaise. “You have no right to coerce him into something just because you believe that he’s incurable.”
I am so terribly sorry it's been so long without an update! And to end on a 'cliffhanger'... I planned on that, I won't lie, but we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. Potter in the next chapter!
He felt Potter stiffen, and drew away from him, eyes yet again sweeping from head to toe. Blowing a kiss, he turned and disappeared through the bodies on the dance floor, hopefully leaving Potter with something to think about.
“And why can’t you?” Hermione countered. “Your patient is there, unsupervised, and you need to ensure his safety. I believe that overrides any etiquette that you feel you may be breaking.”
With his last mouthful gone, he cast a Tempus charm and saw that an hour had passed, and Draco was still nowhere to be seen. He set his plate in the sink and rested his hands on the cool stainless steel, preparing himself for what he was about to do. Draco had told him very little about Blaise, only that they were friends and sometimes had dinner together. In the month that they were dating before Draco got cursed, he had seen Blaise once for a formal dinner that Draco had returned home early from, slamming around the kitchen and refusing to talk to Harry about why he was upset.
To his surprise, Ron nodded along with his words. “It would probably be good for both of you,” he mused, “I’ve noticed that he’s not on the top of his game when he’s spent an extended period at the Manor. And you’re lonely, but you won’t admit it.” Ron grinned at him as Harry glared over his shoulder. “He has changed, for the better. He’s still Malfoy, but he’s more Draco now.”
How many was it now? I thought back to the numerous people, the articles in The Prophet, the ones whose bodies I hid so well that they’d never be found.
Harry finally laughed. “I got rid of those ages ago. Couldn’t stand the sight of them.” He walked over to the sink and washed his hands, shaking the water from them before turning back to Draco. “I bet Kreacher has already started dinner. We won’t have to order take away.”
Harry couldn’t argue with that. They had spent countless hours in his room, even before they started dating. It just ended up being a comfortable area for them to relax, have tea, and discuss their days.
“I doubt it’ll come as any surprise to any of them, but yes, let’s make it official tomorrow.” Giving him another soft peck, Draco detangled himself from Harry and set about carrying their empty stew bowls to the sink. “After you left, everyone was giving me shit about you spending the night.” Harry laughed, coming to rest his chin on Draco’s shoulder, watching him rinse out the bowls. “Let me see,” Draco pretended to think hard. “Ron and Hermione were appalled that we shared a bed. Who knows what they get up to on their own time, but Merlin forbid anyone else to do anything slightly scandalous. Ginny was happy that I was, ahem, ‘getting some action.’” He felt Harry tense behind him, but continued on. “Neville, always the mediator, said he was sure that there was a reasonable explanation, and Luna - lovely, loony, Luna - told me that the Wrackspurts had all but disappeared from you.”
“I know your surname starts with a P, has two syllables, and that’s what I call you.” Draco glared daggers at Harry. “Are you even qualified to heal me? Where are your credentials?”
He had taken himself out of his pants before his brain caught up with his thoughts, and with a few rough strokes and a twist of his wrist at the tip, he came with a groan, dirtying the floor in front of him. His head fell back against the door with a sharp crack, and he willed his breathing to slow down. This was only a minor setback. He and Draco had been intimate like that before, and Harry’s body was simply responding to the stimuli it was receiving. He had not willingly tried to molest Draco.
“He’ll be with me the whole time!” Harry rushed to interrupt. “I don’t trust him alone at Grimmauld since I just got him. I don’t know what he could tear up or get into. There could be some unknown dark object that he could get his little ferret-y claws into…”
He was so caught up in trying to remember what SOCKS stood for that he almost ran into Holly when she stopped outside of a large sliding glass door. “Master Blaise is through here, sir.” She gestured. “I’ll be taking my leave now. Have a lovely visit.” With a curtsey, Holly turned and began walking away, her tray held high.
An appraising look swept Harry from top to bottom as Draco looked him over. “Pity.” He stood, dropping his napkin onto the table. “Are you quite sure? You look rather flustered.”
He awoke with a start, his neck feeling stiff. He sat up and rolled his shoulders, looking around his dark flat with sleep-filled eyes. He couldn’t have been asleep for that long, but something had woken him up.
“You can use the bathroom mirror,” Draco gestured to the rear of the store, “Or if you don’t mind it, I’m not too bad with Glamours if you tell me what I need to do.”
“No,” Harry said quickly, “the Unspeakables creep me out, and I don’t want them crawling through Draco’s head.”
Two years of being roommates with Draco Black. The entire situation was odd, but they had made it work. It had started, strangely enough, with Ron and Draco’s unusual camaraderie.
“I’m Alyce,” she smiled. “I expect we’ll be seeing you Fridays from now on?” Harry barked out a laugh.
“Well, James, first things first, I know you’re a wizard.” The eye contact still hadn’t been broken, and Harry felt incredibly overwhelmed. “The magic you exude is extremely powerful, especially around so many non-magical beings.” Malfoy closed his eyes and leaned closer, his breath ghosting over Harry’s ear, making him shiver. “Second thing… I saw you last Friday watching me. I saw you run away. And I can
“I’d like you to come.” Draco declared, turning around and crossing his arms across his chest. He decided to try to play off of their old back and forth from school, to try to get a rise out of him. “If you’re comfortable being around a Death Eater, that is.” Harry furrowed his brow and looked down, scuffing his shoe against a non-existent mark on the floor.
That was all it took. Harry may have been dead on his feet, but he always did have a thing for saving people. “Move in here,” he blurted out, “with me, I mean. You can see I have more than enough room. This room can be yours. You can do whatever you want to it, and the rest of the house within reason.” Rubbing his eyes, his mouth split open in a jaw-cracking yawn. “This is the ancestral Black home. You’re Draco Black now. Sirius may have left it to me, but it’s just as much yours as it is mine.”
He appeared in the sitting room of Grimmauld place, his magic still crackling around him. It startled Draco, who was sitting curled up on the couch with a cup of tea in his shaking hand.
“If we can’t figure something out during my sabbatical, then fine. You can talk to them.” Harry sighed. “But not before then! I have three months. I have to figure something out.”
“I don’t believe I asked for your opinion!” Draco was glaring at him again, but Harry was used to it. He stared back calmly, waiting for the moment when Draco would back down. He blinked, realizing his glare was doing nothing, and flushed slightly, turning back to the paperwork.
He arrived at the Castle early, scoping out the crowd. It didn’t seem different than any other Friday, and he thought he saw Potter speaking with Alyce at her main bar. He stealthily walked around the perimeter of the club, and almost laughed aloud. It was definitely Potter, but he had to be wearing a partial Glamour. His hair was recognizable, even with the Glamoured eyes and the non-existent scar. Draco narrowed his eyes, watching as he spoke with Alyce easily, acting as though they were old friends.
“I need a sabbatical,” Harry blurted out before the nerve left him. Coughing, he glanced at Healer Douglas, who was looking at him with a knowing look in his eye.
Draco loved dancing at The Castle, and enjoyed the attention he received. But of course, Potter had to come along and ruin it...
“I should have dealt with mine.” He resumed picking at the pillow, a nervous habit Draco recognized. He squeezed the knee where his hand sat.
“Of course I do,” he scoffed, “It’s Draco Lucius Malfoy.” Harry’s face fell, and he shared a look with Ron and Hermione.
“Madness.” Draco gripped his arms tightly in front of him. “I didn’t expect to sell out of everything, even with the Harpies being here, but there were so many people, it was hard to keep up…”
“It’s in the fridge, behind the…” Draco faltered, “behind the cabbage.” He stared at Harry, wide-eyed. “How did I know it was there?” He whispered, looking alarmed.
Now, Draco was relatively well-adapted, out of his father’s shadow, living his life the way he pleased. He was still a snarky arsehole, but he was in no way a predator.
“You’ve done nothing wrong.” He said firmly, “They shouldn’t have been pressuring you to answer questions, and they know it. My mind healer was always very outspoken about limits and pushing past where someone is comfortable. Luna has been good about not pushing me, but Ron and Hermione especially were not good at accepting my personal limits. We’ve come to a certain understanding now, but since you’re their best friend, I’m sure that they feel like they shouldn’t have to tiptoe around you. Neville, I really don’t think that he meant anything by his question; he probably didn’t even think before he spoke. I’m sure you know how he is.” That got a smile from Harry, finally. “Bottom line is, my home is a safe space and they all know that. They pushed too far, and I sent them out because of that. You are not to blame for that. My flat has very specific rules, just like my kitchen.”
“Where the fuck are you, you menace?” Harry looked under the couch and the armoire, but it was like the ferret had disappeared. Standing still, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, willing himself to calm down and think like a ferret. He heard a slight rustling, along with the ripping of paper. “What the…” he opened his eyes and glanced at the coffee table, where the ferret was busy ripping up the latest issue of Wizards of the Pitch, his new favorite Quidditch magazine. “You wanker, I haven’t even read that one yet!” His cheeks flushed as he saw some of the ripped and scratched up pictures: Beaters and Chasers topless and winking suggestively. He hoped that Malfoy’s ferret brain couldn’t put two and two together.
Allowing himself a few moments to calm down, he took a deep breath and reached for the Floo Powder. Kneeling in front of the fire, he tossed a pinch in and called out “Granger Grotto!” before sticking his head in the flames.
Draco followed him down the hall and stepped into the room Harry indicated. Harry’s room wasn’t messy, but it didn’t exude elegance like Draco’s did. It definitely looked lived in. Harry’s bed sheets were a brilliant gold, and the sun shining through the window made it look as though they were glowing.
“He’s not so bad when you tell him exactly what to do. Plus, he’s helped Luna with the gardens, so he likes to hang around and make sure the plants are well-tended to.” Twisting the timer on the stove, he turned back to Harry. “It’ll be done in about 30 minutes. Do you like it with custard, whipped cream, ice cream, or clotted cream?” He walked to the sink and turned the water on, beginning to wash the dirty dishes. Harry hopped down from his chair and grabbed a nearby towel, holding his hand out for the clean dishes. They stood together in relative silence as Draco washed and Harry dried.
Once he had located not-Potter, he hurried to find Carl to discuss the set he had planned for the night. The stage was set and ready; all that needed to be considered was the music and color of the lights, which was quickly rectified.
Making a last minute change to his set wasn’t unheard of, and Carl was more than happy to oblige Draco - he was, after all, the reason why Fridays suddenly became more popular.
“I was just wondering if you’d like to go out sometime?” Ethan batted his eyelashes and leaned against the front counter. “I know the cafe closes early, so maybe we could just…?” He was interrupted by the front door opening, bell jangling wildly as a windswept Harry Potter burst through. He must have been in a hurry; he had forgotten his Glamour.
“I’m a new generation elf, sir. The older generation may have had a different speech pattern than myself and my generation, but I assure we’re just as devoted to our wizard families.”
“I already made friends with the bartender,” he confessed, “I was thinking of just covering my scar and changing my eye color for the most part. I don’t want to cause too many issues.” Ginny hummed in agreement and turned back to her full length mirror, adjusting her crop top.
“Can’t you skive off?” Harry pleaded. “This is so important, we have to figure out what happened to Draco so we can put him back to rights…”
It was an unfortunate truth in his life. He had the worst luck. Voldemort living in his home, leaving behind dark, tainted magic that seeped into the walls of the Manor, making it nearly unlivable. His parents both passing away within a year of each other - his father in Azkaban, his mother in the Manor of a supposed broken heart. And of course, arguably the worst luck, was Harry Potter snuffing him at eleven and then the subsequent years of their unbridled rivalry.
This chapter is a bit longer than the others, but I ended up stuffing a bunch in! I hope you all enjoy Harry and Draco's "Friend Things" in this chapter xD
“How much cream  do you like?” Harry asked eagerly, holding up the pitcher he was holding. “And do you put sugar in yours? Or did you want to try the treacle syrup? I already put some in mine.” Draco watched in amusement as Harry put a splash of milk in the red mug.
“I suppose,” her voice drifted out to him from their back garden, “but you have to wear this!” Something large and round was suddenly flying towards Draco, and, though his seeking skills were rusty, he managed to snatch what ended up being a badge out of the air. He examined it and flushed; it was a rather large button featuring an Antipodean Opaleye, breathing fire that rearranged into the letters spelling out, “It’s my birthday!” every few seconds.
“Oh…” Harry rose to his feet and placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “No, love. Not like that. Nothing like that.” He raised a hand and wiped the tears from Draco’s face. “Even before we started dating, when you had dates and such, you never… you were never explicit with them.”
Shaking his head, Draco sighed and deepened the kiss. “I still want to figure that out on my own.” He said as he pulled away. “But this…” He kissed Harry again. “This is okay for now.”
After they had parted ways that first time, Luna had given him her Floo address and told him that he was welcome to call at any time. Draco hadn’t been sure of that, but a fortnight later when he had awoken from a nightmare that was worse than the others he’d been having, he threw the Floo Powder into his fire and called out the address she provided. He was whisked away and into an extremely round room, full of all sorts of different plants - and had found Luna curled up on a fluffy couch with her arm around a rather large fern, reading the Quibbler upside down. She seemed unsurprised to see him, and patted the spot next to her that wasn’t taken up by the fern. He had sat next to her and she sat with him, quietly humming, as his heart rate returned to normal and he was able to breathe easier. “I have them too,” she spoke quietly, “the nightmares. I know what it’s like. You don’t have to be alone.”
“No, but I’ve been there, done that, and I’m still learning. If I can give you the knowledge I have, then I will.” Draco leaned back and looked towards the door, which had opened with a happy jingle of bells. It was an older gentleman accompanied by his younger child, who was excitedly bouncing and chattering away about a croissant filled with something called Nutella. Making a mental note to look into this Nutella thing, he turned his gaze back to Harry, who had narrowed his eyes and was looking at him scrutinizingly.
“Draco…” Harry tried again, “You usually ask for me to be your Healer. We live together, for fuck’s sake!” He was quickly losing his professionalism, and he tried to reign it back in as he dropped this newest bombshell on Draco.
Harry felt his anger rise anew. “You know nothing of the situation.” He struggled to keep his magic in check. “You know vague facts and you’re putting together a puzzle that you don’t even have all the pieces for.”
As the night was finally winding down, Draco yawned and laid back against the pillows. “I don’t want to go back to the Manor,” he admitted to Harry quietly, the room so dark that Harry couldn’t see his expression. “Sure, mother is there, and I love her dearly, but I don’t feel comfortable in the place that he… that Voldemort claimed.”
“That would probably be a good idea.” He smiled and grabbed Harry’s hand, allowing himself to be pulled up the stairs. He felt a lightness in his chest that he hadn’t felt in years, and recognized it for what it was - hope. Grinning, he sat next to Harry on the overstuffed couch in the sunlit sitting room, watching Harry talk animatedly about their mutual friends and how to best tell them.
“You liked it and are going back in two days.” Damn it, she heard. “Don’t think for a minute that I don’t know you, Harry James Potter. You know why we broke up.” Harry cringed. He hated talking about it and absolutely refused to bring it up.
Being lost in the music, it seemed sudden that the last few notes of his final song were playing. He swept himself into a low bow and blew a few kisses to the crowd,and watched as Potter made his way to Alyce’s bar - exactly where Draco wanted him to be.
“I told him I wouldn’t be going with him.” Draco said calmly, picking up his tea and sipping it. “He told me I was being foolish, and that he and Violet could take care of me better than you could.”
“You.” His voice sounded like a child’s now, the fight he had been giving the bed all but abandoned. He stood frozen and trembling, arms curling around himself in a protective stance. “You’re not the real Draco Malfoy.” If Draco had been expecting anything, that was not it. He knew about nightmares and had them himself; plenty of nights he woke up gasping, thinking he was still in the Manor and Voldemort was still a few rooms away. He assumed Harry would be having similar nightmares, but saying that Draco wasn’t real? What in the world…
After waving the last of the customers off, Luna locked the door and whirled to face Draco, positivity nearly radiating off of her. “I told you!” She said triumphantly, “I told you this was a good idea!” Draco shook his head and smiled, motioning her towards the kitchen. A knock and a shout at the door made them both turn, and Luna unlocked the door to let their friends in. Ginny had to go to practice, but Neville, Ron, and Hermione had all arrived to assist with the clean-up of their first day.
“No, it was brilliant.” Draco answered honestly, grabbing his rag and beginning to wipe down the counters. They worked quietly; Draco had full confidence in Harry to get the scones prepped and didn’t need to babysit him in the least, which allowed him to deep clean the coffee carafes and other machines around the kitchen.
Harry meandered away from the bar, navigated through a few dancing bodies, and came to a stop closer to the stage area. It was then he noticed a cage suspended above him, and this must have been what the bartender was talking about. Looking around, he noticed a few posters stating, “THE CASTLE PRESENTS DRAGON: GO-GO DANCER. EVERY FRIDAY AT 9PM”. The posters had a close up of bright, grey eyes, and Harry found himself pondering them longer than absolutely necessary. They looked vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t place where he’d seen them before. He didn’t spend a lot of time around Muggles, so he shrugged the thoughts away. No way he could know this ‘Dragon’ character; it was his first time at the club.
“Well, now you’re taking ten steps back, starting over from Draco Lucius Malfoy, Royal Prat with Daddy Issues.” Ron laughed, vanishing his coffee spit with a wave of his wand. “Think he’ll go back to being Draco Black without a struggle?”
Draco could feel his throat tighten. “Do you agree?” He asked, turning off the water and shaking his hands off. “Do you think this could actually work?”
“I… I don’t think I”m ready for that just yet,” he whispered faintly, “First time, you know?” Alyce threw her head back and laughed.
“Pepper, I demand you answer me!” Draco was getting flustered. Harry knew he hated being ignored, but he hadn’t done it on purpose.
This song was a little faster than the first song Harry saw Malfoy dancing to, but it was no less erotic. Malfoy was wearing a tight pair of pants patterned with skeleton legs, and they made his already long legs look that much longer. He had foregone his fishnet top and was simply wearing a leather vest, the front open and showing off his pale torso… there were no scars there, Harry noticed, his shock evident. Maybe he was also wearing a Glamour? There was no way that Sectumsempra didn’t scar him; there was so much blood…
So let them see me coming out of the bar, out of my home, going for a walk in the park. What will they say? ‘Saviour Stops to Smell Silver Sage’ - headline news, let me tell you.
The whistling kettle brought Harry out of his reverie, and he quickly poured the hot water over the tea leaves and let it steep as Draco liked. A splash of milk and three sugars later, he levitated the steaming cup and went back upstairs to find that Draco had fallen asleep on his bed, curled around the same pillow he had thrown at Harry.
“You did what you thought was right. I’m not discrediting mind healers; in fact, I am an advocate of going to one… but you need to make that decision yourself. You can’t have your friends, family, anyone else tell you how to take care of yourself. You know yourself best, you know what you can and can’t handle.”
“You think my name is Popcorn?” Harry wanted so badly to be amused, but in truth, he was heartbroken.
Draco felt Potter’s eyes on his, and decided to take action. Cocking his head, he held a hand out, grinning. “I’m Dragon, but you knew that.” Potter took the hand automatically, but took a moment before responding.
“I’m asking you on a date, you dullard!” Ethan’s face grew red. “I’ve been flirting with you every time I’ve seen you, I thought you had noticed.”
“It’s not that I don’t like them.” Draco blew across the top of his hot coffee, and took a careful sip, allowing the smokey, bitter brew to roll over his tongue before swallowing. “In fact, I do like them, rather a lot, and that’s why I try to limit my intake of sugary drinks. The average coffee shop drink is pretty high in sugar, especially the ones with the specialty syrups.”
I stood and swayed, but whatever he did to heal me seemed to have taken. I was a bit light-headed, but it wasn’t unbearable. I took several slow, shuffling steps towards where I remembered the ensuite being, before the blackness started creeping into my vision again. I reached a hand out to steady myself on the bedpost, but found Draco’s arm around my waist before I could grip anything.
He wanted to Apparate me to the Manor - I told him it would leave a Magical Trace, and just told him to leave me. He gritted his teeth and removed the knife, wincing as a stream of blood shot out. He tore a piece of my shirt off to press against the wound. “Pressure, Potter.” He muttered before scooping me up and carrying me back to the Manor.
“Ethan,” Draco began, tucking a few stray strands of hair behind his ear, “I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t tell everyone about Harry working here. Or about our… relationship.” He frowned, but Ethan was one step ahead of him.
“‘Mione?” He called, looking around the empty room. Usually around this time in the morning she’d be curled up on the couch with a book, but there was no sign of her.
Seeing Draco up and dressed in his immaculate clothing gave Harry pause as he peeked around the door frame. Draco was standing in front of the window, hands braced on the sill, staring longingly out at the enchanted mountains. As Harry watched, the mountains changed to a dark forest, then a Quidditch pitch, before it finally settled on a vast field of wildflowers.
A finger to his lips, and the crowd quieted down enough for him to speak - it wasn’t like he could use a Sonorous in a Muggle club. “How’s everyone doing tonight?” He called, and as he thought, the crowd went insane. Another finger to his lips, and the crowd grew quiet again, allowing him to continue. “Well, that sounds good. As you can see,” he gestured upwards, “No cage! What’s up with that?” He pulled on his most picturesque pout, and noticed Potter shiver out of the corner of his eye.
“Why don’t I come by the cafe on Saturdays right before your end of shift?” Harry blurted out, “and then we can walk back to your flat and do… friend things and then you could walk me home at night?” Draco considered this, and began to smile. Having something to look forward to after work on Saturdays would be good, and Harry could possibly help him in the cafe’s kitchen before they went back to his flat.
“Tell me what you want to know.” Harry whispered. “I’ll tell you everything, anything you want.” He tugged Draco to the bed and pulled him down onto his lap, holding him close.
“Y-yes, I think so. Yes.” Looking up at Draco, he smiled and Draco returned the look, spreading his arms to the side.
“Well you’re in luck!” He held up the jar triumphantly. “I just made custard the other day.” Setting the jar on the counter to loosen up, he beckoned Harry into the living room where he sat on the couch, putting his feet up on the coffee table and motioning for Harry to sit down as well.
“Give me my chart,” he demanded, “let me see what it says.” Harry handed it over, watching as Draco’s eyes flew along the paperwork. His brow furrowed, and his lips moved silently as he read the words, ‘cursed,’ ‘unknown reaction,’ ‘stabilized but unconscious.’
Tomorrow was going to be an interesting day, and with Harry by his side, he knew that no matter what happened, they would get through it together.
Robards chuckled. “Oh, I’ve heard plenty about the schoolboy drama. It’s one of the reasons I chose you three. Do you have any further questions?” The three men shook their heads - it did seem rather straightforward - and Robards stood again, motioning to the door. “Then you are dismissed. Actually…” he paused, eyeing them speculatively. “There is one last thing. I suppose since I have you all looking for him, it’s rather pertinent than you know. Draco Malfoy is an Animagus.”
I could only handle being an Auror for so long. Everywhere was corrupt. My partners were corrupt. Ron was corrupt; though who could blame him? He lost so much in the war.
“Sir,” Neville hesitated, “We all have history with Malfoy, back from our Hogwarts days. Do you really think it’s the best idea to have Harry and Ron looking for him?”
“I’m sorry.” Ethan ran a hand through his hair, which didn’t look as styled as it had every other time he had visited. “I was out of line on Saturday, and I know it.” He grimaced. “I told my mum and she said if I didn’t get my ‘skinny white ass’,” he raised his fingers into air quotes, “back here to apologize right away, I’d get my arse whooped. And even without that,” he hurried to say, casting a glance at Harry before meeting Draco’s eyes again, “I know I said things I didn’t mean. You don’t owe me anything, not an explanation, or even a coffee if I was a paying customer. Though…” he stared at the espresso machine wistfully, “Your hazelnut macchiatos are the best I’ve ever had.”
“A ferret.” Harry and Ron were struck mute, and Robards grinned at their stunned silence. “Dismissed, gentlemen. Good luck.”
“Could we… could we plan something? Weekly?” Harry seemed reluctant and took another bite of his pastry. “Like how the others have Sunday? Maybe, if you had time, I could…” he trailed off, and Draco nodded slowly, pulling himself out of his baking mindset. Harry deserved to have his full attention.
Finally, Draco met Harry’s eyes, and Harry could feel his heart thump painfully in his chest as he saw the tears reflected there. “Grimmauld Place?” He whispered, and Harry nodded, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead.
?” Hermione asked incredulously, staring at the brilliant white ferret perched haughtily on Harry’s shoulder.
The first time he went out, he didn’t bother with a Glamour - this was a Muggle club, after all, and came highly recommended from none other than Ginny Weasley. They had parted ways amicably, both having realized that they weren’t what the other needed. She only went on what was referred to as Kandi Kid Wednesday, and Harry, after seeing the pictures of her outfits and watching her make the colorful beaded bracelets one day as they hung out, decided that part of the scene wasn’t for him. That’s when she brought up the darker, goth nights they had on the weekends.
“You were the one who was here on Saturday too,” he said, his voice infused with awe, “You’re Harry Potter!”
“Excellent!” Draco picked at the food on his plate, delicately spearing a bite of eggs and inspecting it before popping it into his mouth. “You’ll be able to pick me up a pastry when you come home in the morning, and I’ll be able to bring you dinner when I get off. Seems fair to me.” He took another bite of eggs, larger this time. “Potter, where did you learn how to cook? I mean, a fry-up isn’t my personal breakfast choice, but these eggs are divine!”
“Oh Harry.” Hermione shook her head and tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. “You have to be careful so the lines don’t get blurred. He’s still not mentally healthy enough to process these things!”
“Draco, wait,” Harry panted finally, placing a hand on Draco’s chest and pushing him just far enough away so that their lips were no longer touching. “I don’t want to… I mean, I haven’t, and I don’t want to… yet…”
Harry ventured further into the house with Draco trailing along behind him. Harry was glad to see that Ron or Hermione managed to take down any ‘couple’ pictures that had been displayed, though the house felt oddly cold without them. It had been Draco who insisted on putting the pictures up, declaring that if they were dating, everyone should know and that they should be reminded at every turn. Harry’s heart clenched as he saw the one picture that was left behind - a group shot of Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Draco. Draco had noticed it too, and walked over to it, picking up the delicate frame and studying the moving image.
“It can take time, but you have people who support you, and you can do what you see fit. I could help you find a Mind Healer if you wanted, like Luna did for me. Or I can just sit here and listen to you and be your friend.” The timer sounded from the kitchen, and Draco stood up, motioning Harry to follow him.
“Stop it,” he chided himself, wrapping a towel firmly around his waist and swiping the condensation from the mirror, “Something like this was bound to happen. Draco didn’t make a big deal about it, you did. Stop your shit, get dressed, and go face the day.”
Horrified, Harry met Draco’s sleepy grey eyes staring back at him, pupils blown wide.  “I knew it,” he whispered, moving his hips in a circle against Harry’s clothed cock and moaning. “I knew we were more than just roommates.”
Something in Draco’s chest clenched, and he turned on the faucet and slowly ran his hands under the water, still listening carefully to the other’s conversation.
Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, he made his way to the bar and waved to Alyce. It took her a moment to recognize him, but then a wide smile and a nod told him that she’d be over in just a moment.
“Blaise,” Harry greeted the tall man, drawing his attention away from Draco for a moment. “Draco’s just woken up, and he’s a little confused. Can you please keep your voice down?”
With a sigh, he decided to let Draco sleep. If he had fallen asleep in the short amount of time it took him to make a cup of tea, he obviously needed it. Pulling the sheet up around Draco’s shoulders, Harry tucked him in and left the room, feeling lost.
The mixer was on, filled to the brim with batter, and Harry was bustling about, grabbing different ingredients from different places for the mix-ins. “Plain, apple, chocolate chip, blueberry, and ham with cheese.” He rattled off, not looking at Draco. “I’m sorry for being late, but I can get this done fast.”
“Draco saved the last blueberry one for you!” Luna enthusiastically grabbed his hand and pulled him back towards the kitchen. He trailed along behind her, still taking in the cafe. He noticed the sign above the kitchen door before Luna pulled him through, and hurriedly grabbed his wand from his back pocket to place in the receptacle. Draco stared - he usually had to remind his friends to put their wands there, and here was Harry sodding Potter, following rules like he had been to the cafe dozens of times before.
“I guess that’s fine.” Harry sighed. “I still have a lot of work to do, mind you. Don’t expect miracles.”
“Alright?” Ron exclaimed, clapping Draco on the shoulder and waving his wand to enchant the broom to begin sweeping the floors, “How was it today?”
“Are we friends?” Harry looked as though he would be crushed if the answer was no, and Draco swallowed.
“Do you want us to be friends?” Picking up the jar of custard, he twisted the lid off and stirred it with a long wooden spoon, if only to have something to do with his hands. Harry’s face flushed pink as he stared pointedly at the tart.
“So…” he fiddled with his drink, “Harry. What brings you out?” The kitchen went silent, except for Luna’s absent humming. Harry shakily set his drink down on the counter and looked miserable.
He danced with the finesse of someone who had been doing it their whole life. Music was his kryptonite, and always had been. Even as a child taking ballroom dance lessons at the Manor, he knew how to move and sway to many types of music, classical or otherwise.  He knew what he looked like and how certain moves would elongate his elegant limbs, and did everything he could to enhance himself. He lost himself in the music, almost forgetting his plan of enticing Potter, as the beat grew heavier and the music fluctuated.
Harry spluttered, choking on the last of his coffee. “Luna,” he said uneasily, “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea… I mean, you literally just accused me of distracting Draco, how would it be if I was here all the time?”
Maybe eating before Flooing wasn’t the best idea, Harry thought to himself as he tumbled out of the fireplace and into a large, high-ceilinged anti-room. His stomach turned and he took a moment to breathe before straightening up and looking around. He knew Blaise lived in a Manor that nearly rivaled Malfoy Manor, but he hadn’t been expecting to Floo into a completely unoccupied room.
“Well, mainly I’m friends with Luna and she forced the others to be around me enough that they started sticking around,” Draco responded conversationally, “And I can be an arse if I really want to, Potter.”
“Of course he does, Ron, remember that time you forgot to put your wand away at his flat and the Soufflé he was making started sparking and ended up as a puddle instead of rising?” Hermione to the rescue, Draco thought, as he lugged the large mixer bowl to the counter and divided the dough into five relatively even blobs on the floured surface. Ron had the decency to look slightly ashamed as he turned to wash his hands with everyone.
“I dreamed of it!” Luna turned and her large, blue-grey eyes stared into his silver ones. “It’s such a good idea, Draco. There’s not a good coffee shop in Diagon Alley, and all you do is stay at home…” she trailed off, looking serene even as Draco’s face hardened and the Malfoy Mask attempted to come to the surface. He felt it and did his best to relax - that wasn’t him anymore. It was 2004, for Merlin’s sake. The war was over, he had made his peace, he even had friends… okay, maybe acquaintances via Luna, but it was still more than he could have ever hoped for six years ago. No one outwardly hated him anymore, and that was as good as he could have wanted it.
“So… Poison isn’t it, either,” he said weakly, and Harry shook his head. Draco sighed in defeat. “I’ll get it one of these attempts.”
“…and while I understand that tea is a perfectly lovely breakfast item, you would think that some people would have the common decency to wait until all parties are awake to begin the brew…!” Draco paused in the doorway, hair disheveled, glaring at Ron and Harry.
“Tastes just right.” Harry didn’t break eye contact with Draco right away, and Draco could feel himself reacting to the tension between them. He leaned forward and gently brushed his lips with Harry’s, but as he did so, the oven timer went off.
After the war, because of his status as a known Death Eater, he found it hard to find employment, or anyone who would look at him without scorn. With his father in Azkaban for the unforeseeable future and his mother living in France, as she couldn’t bear to be without Lucius, he was left alone in Wiltshire, at Malfoy Manor, with no one for company. Draco couldn’t stand being alone, and the house elves were little to no comfort. He had enough in his personal Gringotts vault to live comfortably for many years, so he had decided to move to London, closer to Diagon Alley. Sure, he could have stayed at the Manor and been safe from the glaring eyes of the wizarding world, but he found he truly didn’t want to be so ostracized. He’d face those glowers with his head held high; he was a Malfoy, after all. He found his small garden flat down the road from the Leaky Cauldron, and as it was owned by a muggle, he had no issues putting money down and moving in as soon as he could. That was about three months before he met Luna.
These establishments were new to Harry; only recently feeling the need to get out of his comfort zone and just live and let go, instead of going through the day to day motions.
Harry desperately wanted to go up behind him and hold him. Draco looked so small and fragile in that moment - not only because of the weight loss he experienced during his coma, but also because the look on his face was desolate.
Luna didn’t make him feel that way, however. Luna’s friendship had come as a complete surprise. One day, he was window shopping in Hogsmeade, thinking about buying his mother some of the Chocoballs from Honeydukes she liked, and Luna had all but ran headfirst into him, claiming to be “following a Demiguise”. He had caught her arm and helped her regain her balance, and when she saw who he was, she didn’t lurch away in fear or disgust. She simply smiled up at him with her wide, knowing eyes and exclaimed, “Draco! It’s been a while. How are you doing?” Draco had spluttered out some nonsense about being fine and really needing to go, but she had linked her arm with his and proclaimed loudly that she thought his mother would
Blaise downed his drink before sweeping past Harry to sit back down on the couch, one long leg draped carelessly over the other. “You just like to ruin things.”
“Why didn’t you tell me we were dating?” There was a note of desperation in Draco’s voice. “Why couldn’t you have told me? After I woke up from the coma? After this morning…” He swallowed. “I thought that I had done something wrong, that maybe we had been dating but then you didn’t want me anymore…”
“I’ll meet you there in a moment.” Harry repeated, and Draco nodded stiffly before walking to the fireplace and grabbing a pinch of Floo powder. Without looking back, he threw the powder into the fire and stepped through the green flames, leaving Blaise and Harry behind.
“Busy with what?” Ron interrupted, “He doesn’t do anything. After that day we waited for him at the Ministry for Auror training and he never showed, he wasn’t interested in going or doing anything with us.”
As he watched, Blaise moved closer to Draco and draped an arm casually over the couch behind his shoulders. Harry saw Draco stiffen, then relax and Blaise continued whatever conversation they were having.
Draco sat down primly at the table, brushing invisible crumbs away. “If I was the one marinating the lamb, wouldn’t it make sense that I would be the one to cook it?”
What didn’t make sense was Malfoy sliding up right next to Harry, bumping arms, and smiling at Alyce.
?” She indicated her outfit, which was a myriad of neon colors. Harry pressed his lips together and shook his head slightly. “That’s your answer, then. They redecorate for different nights, Harry. I don’t go to goth nights. I only suggested it because you thought that this,” she gave a little twirl, “was too
Harry stared. He had no idea Draco knew so much about St. Mungo’s scheduling and training. “Yeah, a bit.” He sat down and tucked into his food, not waiting to see what the other two did. “I could be doing overnights, though. I may be coming in when you’re going to work.”
“Friend things.” Draco repeated, amused. “Sounds good, Harry.” Finishing the last of his own tart, he stood and grabbed Harry’s plate and went to put the dishes in the sink.
“That’s absolutely brilliant.” Harry could feel his mood begin to brighten. “When can we look at it? Tonight?”
“Which Weasley, specifically?” Harry prodded, flipping to a fresh page on the medical chart. “There are seven Weasley siblings. Which one was that?”
“He’s right,” Luna spoke up, hopping down from the counter, “Harry’s got so many wrackspurts around his head, it’s no wonder he can’t think clearly enough to answer questions. Do you want me to take you home, Harry?” She reached out to him, but he shied away from her touch, bringing him closer to Draco than he had been before. Thoughtfully, she drew her hand back and tilted her head to one side. “No, you’re right. You should stay here and we should go. Draco, we can come back tomorrow, if it’s okay?” Nodding to herself, she herded the rest of the group towards the front door. Hermione managed to break away and stood in front of Harry, arms crossed.
“No, Blaise, I don’t know why he’s acting the way he is. I don’t know why you’re acting the way you are, either. If you didn’t remember, I have amnesia.” Draco sniped, arms crossed and glaring into the fire.
“Harry.” Draco cut him off. “You are what I want, and I have no interest in anyone else. I didn’t have an interest in anyone before you reappeared in my life. You have nothing to worry about.”
Harry watched as Hermione walked away, and as soon as she disappeared with the telltale crack of apparition, he turned his full attention to the animal around his neck. “Could you be any more obvious, arsehole?” He hissed. “Maybe try acting like a damn ferret instead of His Royal Highness, King of Gits.” The ferret blinked it’s grey eyes and surveyed Harry coolly, as though to say, ‘
Draco looked at him as though he had grown another head. “You, obviously, Pistachio. Do try to keep up.”
“His body is normal and he doesn’t appear to be in any pain, thankfully. It’s just his memory that’s affected.”
“You think he’s willing to settle down with the Wizarding World’s Golden Boy?” Blaise placed a finger on Harry’s shoulder and gave him a sharp push. “You think that what you have to offer Draco is better than what we have to offer; that is to say, the life he deserves and wants to live? You live in a moldy old rundown house that could do with a few centuries worth of cleaning charms. He deserves to live in high class society, not to shack up with the washed up boy wonder.”
“Au contraire, Potter,” Draco was smug, “I work a terribly boring nine to five, and while your schedule may be hectic during the training days, I know that you’ll probably end up working four days, twelve hour shifts, with three days off a week. Does that sound correct?”
Draco had babbled the entire time Harry was gathering fresh sheets, so by the time the bed was made and ready for sleeping, he was wide awake. He sat at the foot of the bed, listening to Draco prattle on about how the raids had been going and how much he enjoyed his job now that he was allowed on the field. He asked Harry questions, too - why he had wanted to be a healer, and listened with a serious expression on his face as Harry explained that he wanted to be someone known for something else than the defeat of Voldemort. “You were always just Potter to me,” Draco said seriously, “except when you saved us all. You’re still just Potter, only a lot more fit.”
