Harry kissed him on the mouth, and then kissed his crumpling mouth again, and then kept on burrowing kisses everywhere, to his upper lip, and his bottom lip, and the corner of his lips, and his wet cheeks and jaws and neck and shoulder, blindly and desperately kissing every part of him that he could get his mouth on until Draco fumbled to wrap his arms around him tightly, shoved his face into his shoulder with one hard, gasping sob and then cried and cried and cried. Harry held him tightly by his hitching shoulders and the back of his head and whispered,
"I mean, I like it. When others do it. But I always feel a bit like I don't know how to react. So I just go a bit still, like if I move, I'll make it weird."
Harry scooted his head closer on the pillow.
"How about a game?" Harry asked, smiling slightly, mounting the broom again.
Harry knows he should say something. He knows he should tell her... he should tell her he's with somebody else. He should tell her he no longer feels—
"I want to know."
"Stop before all this comes off again?" Harry asked, stopping, laughing, and Draco huffed too, noses and foreheads pressed together. He was watching his own fingers play with the button of his collar, in the little space between them. Harry tilted his chin up quickly, gave his lips a hard kiss again. "Stop looking like that then."
Warning for one line that deals with passive suicidal ideation, allusions to Draco's past abuse in one letter
Draco doesn't seem sure if that isn't another attempt at humour. "Do you really?"
Harry balked, all humour draining out of him instantly. "Wait. WHAT?"
He thought of Malfoy, hunched over alone in corners or unpartnered in classes over the last few months, sunken eyes blankly staring at nothing. He had looked painfully lost and lonely, and Harry had wanted to reach out, had thought of doing it everyday, just going up to him and sitting beside him and trying to talk to him. He'd sit close by to him, even go into libraries to find him, and then he'd watch him in quick glances and stares, trying to convince himself to go and talk to him.
"Because I want to, Potter. Now switch." Malfoy rounded over, pushed Harry to the other side by his back towards the other chair, and sat down as he tugged the chair out.
Hell do we even have homework for Christmas hols?" Ron is asking, and then Hermione is explaining to him the merits of it, with their NEWTs coming up and how everybody will slack if there isn't any pressure—
"It's gone."
It came when they'd been having dinner, with only the sound of clinks of fork and spoons against the plate. Malfoy asked, casual and soft,  "Was it worth it, Potter?"
Malfoy's eyes flicked up at him from under the lower of his lashes. They curled, slightly, having left a feather dust of shadows high on his cheeks. Harry glanced away quickly, down at his drink. He wasn't sure if he was imagining the lingering of Malfoy's gaze on him, but he was much too aware of the haze of him in his peripheral vision.
Harry looks down at him, and is tender in a corner of his heart. He smiles. “Yeah. I will.”
he said.
He watches his shoes, the way they misplace soil under the nettles of grass. She continues on walking, then, prompting Draco to as well.
"Hm?" Draco said, a soft sound of inquisition. He sounded very content.
Draco stills, coming to a slow halt. Luna stops with him.
Bill, to his credit, hardly reacted, and Harry only understood a while later that he wasn't even surprised, and he learned that, apparently, this sort of thing was there in nearly every kind of bond. He took another thread of their magic, asked all his questions, and then took his leave with a reassuring hand tapping down on Harry's shoulder.
As she slid to him his tea, Harry gave her some story about the curse acting up, Draco not willing to leave the party and settle it down.
It took another fifteen minutes to conjure a stag, translucent white and lissome, shooting up from his palm, pressed up against Malfoy's spine. It flew through the wall, rushing towards St. Mungos, and then the Department of Mysteries.
Harry  made his way to the counters. "Yeah. Anything I can do?"
It's all silent until Potter smiles slightly. Draco eyes him until Potter notices and looks up at him. In response to the inquiring raise of his eyebrow, he says, "nothing, it's just—" He fumbles for a moment. "you'd never have—you know. You'd never have done all of this before."
There was a certain way that Harry looked at him, and then shied away, that Draco must recognise by now.
"No. I'm having fun," Draco said, with a shrug, reclining sideways against the arm of the couch in a relaxed, lazy posture, an elbow on top of it. He had his glass in that hand, and he was flushed, clearly well on his way to being drunk as well. He shooed him away. "You can go on. Be boring at home on your own."
Harry lifted his head. He didn't understand it, the first second, but he did right when he'd found himself asking, "What?"
"Nothing, just — that stunt you pulled in the match to get the snitch." Ron was smiling a little, a small huff, remembering it. "She was proud of you."
"Yes, actually," Luna says, a little too innocently.
"Why, because you were the Gryffindor in school?" Draco said, with a raised brow. "You don't think I could be the brave one?"
Malfoy hummed, and then stopped too. And then his eyes flicked over to Harry, like he had just been caught red-handed with his hand in the cookie jar. His pale skin grew flushed around the neck and ears.
"Harry," Draco whispers to him, smiling back. "My Harry."
He falls asleep to the sound of them.
1) Both parties were well-aware of the level of risk and uncertainty involved in this procedure, and that if anything were to go wrong, it was agreed that the curse-alterer and the medimagical staff would not be held responsible or liable to charges.
"That Harry Potter must be the most terribly ridiculous person to ever exist."
Malfoy's gaze was going far away again, like when he sat alone in corners or unpartnered in classes, glazed and distant, and he noticed again just how sunken in his eyes still were, and how pale and thin he still looked, and after all the laughter of the day, he remembered that it was going to be a long time before Malfoy would really be okay again.
the hell does he want from you?"
I have the next two chapters written down for the most part, so hopefully they will not be too far behind.
On the somewhat better days, Narcissa had him curled around her, lying his head on her lap. Andromeda came with Teddy in tow, often, or left him with somebody else if it didn't seem like a good time for Draco, but whenever Teddy did come, he seemed to be the brightest beam in a grey, day-lit room, his wide-eyed innocence and babbled stories in the silence, playing at the foot of their bed. Draco, watching him quietly, from where he was half-sat against Harry or the headboard, with a blatant, tired sort of affection.
Harry wasn't sure why he'd still been keeping an eye on his ex-nemesis, really. It wasn't even as if he thought Malfoy was up to something wicked anymore. While not someone he would ever trust with a blade behind his back any time soon, he didn't think Malfoy was capable of anything evil anymore. Not after everything. Harry had seen the way he cried in the bathroom to Myrtle, terrified as he told her Voldemort would kill him and his family if he didn't do what he demanded of him, showing his reluctance towards committing the horrible deed so very clearly. Malfoy had refused to identify he and his friends at the Manor, and in return, Harry had saved his life twice, once at the Fiendfyre and then during the Battle from a Death-Eater, and spoken up in his favour at his trial.
"And whyever would we put ourselves in such harm's way, Molly?" Narcissa snarled. "If we had such schemes in mind, surely we would not be so obvious about it, and surely we would not risk our own lives as well for it."
"You're my comfort," is what he says.
Draco shook his head, quickly, still grinning, staring out into the distance ahead. The sun was setting, glowing golden from between the tree branches.
He knows when Hermione told them, she was thinking of both of them, even Draco, in some way.
"No, no, not a secret room. It's just a normal room with a lot of po — chemistry stuff in it."
"What—"
"Get out," is what Draco snarls to that, with a flare of his nostrils. "If that is all you have to say after ignoring me for weeks, then spare me the rest of this conversation. I have better things to do than to listen to you."
On the weekends, Harry's at the Manor, having spent dinner with Narcissa and Draco when he comes into the room. In the green fire is Pansy's irritated face, and she's saying, with measured patience behind it, "Draco, what happens if… if the memories start coming back? Because you're around him all the time and things start coming up?"
"Hello," Draco said. His lips twitched, just an edge of a mellow, abashed smile. His eyes lowered to Harry's throat, fingers tracing the line of it there.
"Oh," Harry says. "Oh yeah. You can just, you know, improvise, find something similar to potions. Like, uh...like a muggle chemist?"
References:
"I…" Draco pauses. A knot of muscle tightens at his jaw, jumping with the convulsion of his throat, peeking from the wrap of his black rollneck. "It can't be good for her. To be alone in a place like that all the time. But—" He stops there, blinking. His breathing quivers through his nose, close-mouthed. "Well. It's not quite a place anyone should want to return to anymore."
And Harry always liked the way Draco would mindlessly grab for the wrist or sleeve of his free hand, jostle at him to get his attention, pull him along to something he really wanted to see or shop at or go into. He liked the way he would turn around into the camera with the crescent-moons in his cheeks, a crinkle lighting up his eyes, and the wind in his hair playing up as he walked backwards, hands in his coat pockets, and told Harry about an old childhood memory here, a fascinating fact of history there.
it almost felt like
had described as, I quote,
And it was in the face of this terror, and the wind so cold and raw on his nerves and his skin and in his lungs, the feel of his own pounding heart, that Harry felt wondrously, horribly alive—here where they sat watching over a world that looked bright and sharp and overwhelmingly vast, like all the colours of a painting have deepened themselves to look more vivid to him. And the two of them, so small.
His past is there on his body, all on full display, and though Blaise does not give away much of a reaction at first — that well-practiced cool and collected expression — the way his jaw goes tight and his breathing goes all wrong, gaze fixated on his torso, is enough of a reaction.
"No," Draco rasped, unmoving. He cleared his throat, quickly. "No. Fine. Go back to sleep."
— nothing at all but to kiss that mouth of his, soften away the hard muscles around the tightness of his jaw. "Hello," Harry says instead, dumbly.
It is at the Great Lake that he sees them. Potter, standing uncertainly by a tree, Ginevra taking his hand in her own, stepping a bit closer to him. Potter's eyes lift on her, brows twitching into a frown. Draco's heart is twisted ugly, on fire, and he turns around, doesn't look back.

When Neville is gone, Harry opens the box.
"No," Ron said.
really started to like the Slytherin, more than perhaps anyone should in such a short time when they had a bad history between them. It seemed to be the only plausible answer though. He forced himself to ask anyway, "Why me? Um, why—why with me?"
If he looks up, he will see the daylight streaming in, blazing yellow and white over the room, casting shadows beneath objects. Outside the window, there's greenery on the plains and prairies, the white of clouds, the distant grey-brown of mountains. He can see colours, but they all seem interspersed with an empty, dim grey. All his other senses seem to have faded as well, like everything has a hazy film over it that he can't reach through. Everything was so bright and vivid there, in his Dreams. It's like nothing here can ever come close.
After, Draco reaches for the box a little further away, asking, "What's in this?"
There's a chorus of a shuffle, a scatter of confused grumbling, and then quiet.
"Don't tell him I told you," Harry tells him. "But Ron likes to call this 'their song'. He likes to replace 'Caroline' with 'Hermione' and serenade her when he's drunk."
"As if I would let anybody have their eyes on
His grey eyes seemed to bore into him, then. He was sitting very still, his face unwavering.
"Neither did I," Harry said, only because he didn't quite know what to say either. They hadn't spoken much for about two years now, not through Eighth Year, meeting eyes in passing. Not through this year.
Harry looked up after a long moment, slow and furtive from under his own brows, upon the blurry movement of Malfoy's head, a slight turn of it. A quirk was at one corner of Malfoy's lips—all crooked canine, the hint of the fold of a dimple. He was studying his parchment, quill still against his mouth. Then he straightened, shoulders rising, and began to write again.
But Draco, the pathetic fool that he is, ends up at Potter's door with breakfast one morning, when everybody had emptied out of the commons to head for the Great Hall. He'd known Potter would be staying behind because of the infamous Love Potion incident that's left him averse to eating around other people.
And Harry began to breathe, thick and watery, eyes closed. He could feel himself steadying, his body relaxing against Draco's. He could feel Draco's eyes on him, in the silence that followed, thumb on the hollow of his cheek. The way it came to wipe over a wet streak.
Ron brought in the cake, covered under a bubble charm to save it from the ash and green powder. Molly brought with her a bag full of groceries, hugged Harry tight with a free arm and gave him a kind, wrinkled smile, then made her way over to the kitchen to get started on dinner. There was Hermione after her, smiling as she kissed his cheek, not able to do much else with her hands full of gift-wrapped boxes, and then Ginny came through, and George, and Luna, and Andromeda with Teddy, the rest of them also with a handful of everybody's presents, piling them onto the coffee table for the time being.
Not after having loved Ginny. Crushing on Cho. Imagining a future with a wife and children, craving it, dreaming of it in a lonely forest when he didn't believe he'll ever have it.
"I tried to," Draco says. He smiles at Harry a wry sort of way. "I couldn't do it."
The following day, Draco took his hand and dragged him into the bathroom, where a bath was readied.
He breathed, tried to turn a little, his body sore and stiff. His head hurt, strained by the effort to recount the last two years, that felt like two decades all on their own some days. He settled back against Draco's back, the warmth that was only his body's. It was strange, how comfortable he'd grown with it, how well he knew it.
"And what if… what if something does go wrong?"
"Stop. Breathe," Malfoy urged reposedly, silver staring intently into green, grounding hands on his neck.
And then the touches fell away altogether.
Harry must be quite drunk now, feeling the strange swoop in his stomach. When Ron came to ask him, "Why the long face, mate?" was when he realised he wasn't doing a very good job of hiding his dour mood, seeing Draco laugh at something George had said, brows raised as if he was surprised by it himself. He was thinking of what Ginny had said, had implied.
Luna ties the ribbons of her magic around his hand.
"I think it took me a while to understand what it was that I said, but I get it now, you know. They weren't just dreams. They were real to you, and they helped you survive."
He couldn't seem to stand Harry anymore.
Harry tried to reign in his anger. "I can't
There was Draco, painted, caught mid-laugh with lines folded at his cheeks, and his eyes lit, crinkled. There was Draco, standing in the blur of golden lights of a charity gala, fairy lights in his hair, and much healthier than he looked now, in front of him. There was Draco in a burgundy tuxedo, head turned a little over a shoulder. There was Draco, in his most mundane moments, sitting in a kitchen chair, in his satin robes on the edge of a bed, in the orange firelights playing his violin. Harry was watching him take them all in, quiet. His gaze finally tore away, lowered down at the tiles on the floor, swallowing.
not leave this godsforsaken world until I have ensured that and — and so
Hermione held Harry's hand tighter, grounding in the midst of all the chaos and outrage, the battle for things to tide over in one side's own favour, in Harry's or Draco's, until an arrangement had been accepted, grudgingly so by the compromised. The drawing room was emptied out of all Ministry members, then, leaving the two families alone. Immediately, voices rose again.
"He loved me too."
Draco slips his hand into hers one day, and it startles her enough to spill her coffee all over her magazine. And when she looks at him, and sees his eyes fully focused on her, she presses her lips together, quivering, her eyes going red and teary.
"Wait, he's back?" Ron asks, brows up to his hairline. He looks at Harry. "Really?"
"Hm?"
He glanced away, nodded. It took him a while to speak again, mouth opening, his mind hazy. "How long — how long does he have then?"
"You don't have to," Draco says, an edge of desperation to his words. He hardly knows what he's saying, just saying whatever he thinks Potter would want to hear. "It happened. It's over. You don't have to do anything about —
He turned the doorknob, walked into the bedroom. He paused in the doorway upon seeing the silhouette under the blankets, the flash of bright hair in the dark. The pillow was back in the middle of the bed again.
Sometimes he catches Hermione eying Draco some way, whenever he, Luna and Neville join them at the pub. If Harry wasn't painfully aware of him before, he certainly is now, of the heat of him, the little space between them, of the brush of their arms and knees under the table. Maybe they sit too close, or Harry looks at Draco too much, smiling, his attention lingering on the sight of Draco's, or just on the sight of his face. Harry makes a conscious effort to do a lot less of that.
"Yeah." Harry shifted in his seat. He shrugged, glancing down at his hands on the table. His cup of tea. "Well. Now we know each other's favourite colour."
"How is he?" Hermione asked.
"It was stupid. I know. I stopped using the book I found it from right after."
"Yes. It seems you're
Harry had a hard time wrapping his head around that. "Really?" He sounded skeptical, trying not to be too hopeful. "It can't really be that easy."
After, they go back to their designated alcove, where Harry holds Draco back against his chest, one leg pressed up against his side, Draco's hand on his leg. He watches him with a chin on his bony shoulder, trying to listen to his explanation on the applications of Shrivelfigs, but all he can pay attention to is his face, and his intelligent eyes moving fast and bright with thoughts, that he uses a lot of hand gestures. Harry kisses his cheek.
He kissed the back of her hand in greeting, as in the customary greeting to show utmost respect and affection for a lady, and rose to a straightening of his back, smiling up at her as he did.
Draco pushed at him again. "Get the fuck out! I don't — This is — " His breaths shuddered, his face contorting fully. "Fuck you. You did this to me. This is—this is all your fault—" His voice was thick and wavering again, and he was breaking apart again, and he was breathing hard, laboured. He looked so very sick, hurting.
"Why didn't you come back after the obliviation, if you still felt... I mean, you didn't send any letters after... I spent months believing you erased me entirely, and I..." His voice goes a little strained, trailing off for a bit. "I think I felt like I was going mad for a while."
His smile fades, slowly, flickering out like a candle. A wisp of its smoke is left behind at his lips, still trying to hold.
, the warmth of his hand just like this. He thought of passing out drunk in couches, waking up in beds. Thought of meals on the counter, under stasis. The Calming Draughts in his medicine cabinet.
"A fiendfyre fighter."
Ron is clearly disappointed, but he sighs. "Yeah, alright. I get it. Not going to be the same without you, though." Ginny smirks, and exaggerates an

"Hm?"
Pansy snorts at whatever he must look like, pressing her fingers at the corner of her mascara-smudged eyes, blinking. She moves it away, looking at them, when she says with a wry sort of smirk, "Second to Fourth Year. I had the worst crush on you."
, was what came to mind,
Better, however, did not necessarily mean good, and certainly not enough for Harry to believe that the Malfoy name should ever regain any sort of status or power ever again. Status and power changed people, and Malfoy was not someone Harry had enough faith in to assume he would use it well.
Harry couldn't help the way his own smile came at that. Draco's eyes drifted away, then, turning his head. He raised the bottle to his mouth again, but the hint of a smile lasted, still, around it.
have invited you to my home if I knew. I swear."
But Draco's face is changing, from merely listening to something else. His brows are furrowed, his mouth parted, hovering over his next words. "Sorry. What—what letters are you talking about?"
Draco is passing by his mother's room when he hears the sounds. The sobs muffled behind the closed door.
* * *
Harry spent much of that day closed up in his room, faintly listening for the violins playing down in the drawing room. He was searching through a book on Bonds for anything related to his predicament. He found a section of spells, growing so bored he was only paying half of his attention to it. There was one that managed to freeze the flow of magic for a short time, another that reversed it, and another that exchanged the state of magical cores. It was all useless to him. He came out only to make himself a sandwich when he grew hungry.
But Malfoy didn't say anything about his tardiness, when Harry did arrive in his drawing room. He sat with a wine glass in hand, facing the fire until he noticed Harry come in.
Harry's heart is racing, full in his throat. He can smell the shampoo in his hair from here, floral and sweet. He lets go of Draco first, a bit quickly, but he grabs his wrist immediately after and drags him off towards the exit, Draco stumbling, following after him. "Let's go for a fly," Harry says. The warmth of Draco's body still lingers against him, and Harry releases his wrist just as they're out of the commons, warm up to his face.
Harry swallowed down the lump in his throat, ducking down to look at his hands. He lifted his head after a moment of silence and smiled slightly to lighten the atmosphere. "Viktor Krum."
Draco is taken captive on the orders of Voldemort as punishment for not fulfilling his task and is severely abused. Severus seeks rewards from Voldemort and uses them to be allowed to see Draco. Upon learning of the severity of his torment, he slips Draco a vial of a potion named Alucinatio on his next visit. This potion gives the drinker vividly realistic dreams of a bright and wonderful life consisting of all that they desired but leaves them comatose in reality, the cure of which is the tears of those the user craves the love of. Draco dreams of a life where there is no Voldemort nor Death-Eaters, where his family is happy and he has certainty of his father's love for him, and where he begins a friendship and eventually a relationship with Harry.
"With me of all people?"
Draco's head snaps up.
Harry smiles slightly, chagrined. "Oh wow. I really should write to her then, shouldn't I?"
"I'll be making paintings of you the rest of my life now."
Harry glances down at his plate of food, poking at a sausage. "I'll think about it."
Having clearly noticed the loss in his mass and the fact that he couldn't remember the last time he had seen Malfoy eat in front of his own sight, Harry could hardly refuse him that without feeling like an arsehole, and he didn't want to either. So he sighed, waited as Malfoy tickled the pear on the fruit bowl (and shuddered with a mutter of,
Malfoy's last day in this country, in the place he grew up and where laid everything he had ever known, and he spent it with Harry of all people. Why?
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy moved forward, tried to angle their mouths together for a kiss. Harry turned his head away, jaw clenching around a lock of muscle, even as arousal weaved sharp down his spine, coiled at the root of him. Harry wanted to think it was not his own. "What are you doing?" His voice sounded hoarse, strained to his own ears.
Hello!!
"Are you sure?" Harry asked, slowly, throat convulsing. His fingers were still there, resting against the flat, soft belly.
Everybody placed bets on who would cry first, or more, and most of them did bet on Ron, and they were right, because Ron looked at Hermione as she was walking down the aisle like he could hardly believe, even years later, that he was lucky enough to have her. But he mixed up the word,
It was an underlying thing, more than anything. Even Draco would have seemed almost entirely the same as of now, if only that Harry saw more clearly all the things he had missed before, the reduced energy that had made Draco miss his classes, and the mild quiver of pain passing through his face whenever he used the floo, and how it took him a few tries to cast any of the more complicated spells. There were other things, like how he ate relatively less now. Like how he would be leaving the house in his coat and gloves, wore something thick even in July.
Softened silver met green, then, Malfoy's face strangely mellow, and the upturn of one corner of his lips even more so.
we had!"
"I like seeing you like this," Harry finds himself saying, without thinking. His brain is woozy, somewhat afar, from slumber trying to creep into his body.
The next day, Harry was much more sober when he'd stopped at the sight of a flower shop.
"What, for old time's sake?"
"Not usually so?"
He doesn't
"Do I?" Malfoy said. He sipped a spoonful of his soup, and swallowed. "Haven't been sleeping much, I suppose." He smirked, then. "What's your excuse?"
It kept Harry half-awake at night, kept him floating back to the surface of lucidity every hour or two, and eventually every half an hour. By the time morning would come, he was left feeling as if he hadn't slept at all.
Harry blinks, but settles down. He huffs, shaking his head. "Right." He feels too awkward, trying to argue over something so trivial. He laughs, trying to soothe the uneasiness in his chest and the dull racing of his heart. "Since when did you become so…?"
"But—
, not necessarily that everything would be okay, but that it would be okay even if it wouldn't be, just because they were all there right outside that door.
"It was."

Draco stared at him for a moment. Harry thought he wouldn't answer him.
Malfoy couldn't seem to rip his sunken gaze away from the waters, his hollow face ashen in the moonlight.
is death. And oh, I don't mean only one, Mrs. Weasley. I mean both. There will be no emission of unstable dark magic if there is no living magical core for the curse to act on. Now only one may die, but the other still remains, and now the curse is no longer split into two parties, but doubled in one, taking many more with him that much faster, until he, too, eventually passes away."
It's soft and tentative at first, all clinging and damp lips, Draco's upper lip between the closing of Harry's kiss. It isn't much different from kissing girls, not like Harry had thought it would be — only rougher lips, a stronger jaw under his hands, and it occurs to him that he knows this. He knows this already from a goodbye kiss next to a hospital bed. Except it wasn't quite like this, wasn't quite as raw and aching and sweet.
what could happen, Potter. Why can't you understand that?"
"Emelie, you know," Dudley said. He swallowed, hard, crossed his arms over his chest uneasily. "She's magic too. Just like… just like you."
"No?" Potter says, his dark brows drawing together. "I mean, I thought, after everything at St. Mungos…" After he'd spent months at Draco's bedside, keeping him sane. Potter leaves it at that, however, a bit awkwardly. It is a small mercy. Draco has no desire to think about
"Hello," Harry said, smiling down at him, and then that breath pushed out into a slightly thick, half-laugh.
Draco's brows jumped, quick, and then his cheeks folded into a huff of a laugh, his eyes crinkling.
"Do you mind?" Harry asked, upon seeing the scattering of notes and potion-related things on the kitchen table again. He was holding his plate and mug in hand, his book under his arm. The little space that Malfoy had been leaving him was gone again.
"I kept telling you the opposite of what I felt, trying to protect myself. You couldn't have known. It's not either of our faults."
"What happened to you?" Blaise asks, as he's following after him into his room. He closes the door and moves towards Draco, where he's sitting himself down on the edge of the bed. Blaise has never been one to push for conversations like these, didn't in Sixth Year either. But he does now, kneeling at his feet with his hands hovering over him desperately, uncertainly, curling into fists because he knows he can't touch him.
) or to wish him luck for the game (
"You don't have to tell me, I suppose," Ron says. Harry's been quiet too long. "I mean. Not until you're ready. So I'll just, you know. I have to go back and paint some walls. You'll be alright?"
"I've missed you so much," Harry murmurs. He runs a thumb over Draco's cheekbone. "I wish I'd... I wish I never made you leave."
There, Harry's hand takes his. He breathes, not looking at him. They stay like that for a long minute, until the turmoil in his chest settles somewhat. There's a shift of Harry's hand down his wrist, fingers on his arm, trailing at the hem of his folded sleeve.
Harry figured he might as well just go ahead and tell him the rest of it.
"It's alright," Potter murmurs. His hand is tentative and light on his arm, the warmth of him grounding. "It's alright. You're alright."
It was good. So good. It was
"Oh." Harry said, and then snorted, and then maybe sort of kind of giggled at the whole new context of the situation.
Harry looked ahead, down at the bottle in his hand. At the waves of water below, moving unhurried. "Ever wish you could be with somebody you wanted?"
That night, Draco touches the curl of Harry's fingers, sleeping soundly, gently, beside him. He whispers, "My home is here, with you."
"Do you want to come over for dinner?" Dudley said, a little blurted out. There was only silence.
Harry's chest loosens, and he laughs. He stops walking, then, already wanting to be at the alcove looking at Draco's name and footsteps. "Alright. So, see you guys at Quidditch practice after, then?"
"Do you still feel that way a lot? With your family?"
He let Harry step up closer to him, press a kiss to his cheek. Behind him, the flashbulbs went wild, the crowd louder.
Lovegood and Longbottom get onto the Thestral carriages. Draco stares after him,  unmoving for an infinite moment, his stomach tight and his heart erratic, pushed out of place within his skin. He vaguely hears Lovegood, calling for him to come onto the carriage with her and Longbottom.
but his hands are beginning to tremble anyway, and he remembers a dim and grey cellar. He remembers Greyback and Rowle, hands on him, wands over him. He remembers things he doesn't know if he can ever speak of.
Harry realizes he's been staring at him, his gaze coming to rest on his lips for a split-second, before they dart away.
By the window where the storm roared outside, they danced in a deliberate swaying of shoulders and waist, so that they rotated around in circles of small steps. Draco was laughing inwardly in his chest, cheeks folding in with it, their foreheads together as he dipped his head. Harry took him in closer, so that they were cheek to cheek instead, Draco's arms coming around his shoulders, the two of them still swaying, turning, in the circle of a dance.
Harry stills at that, staring up at him. His lips are half-formed around his surprise, eyes wide.
Draco was laughing at the viewer, soundless, his chest and shoulders moving with it. "It's on video, if you really should know. So I didn't just
the dorm? Until I realized it was a spell. Not sure which one, but I guess some constellations spell. It was all kind of too refined to look real. Don't know what that's about, but...yeah."
"Sixth Year," Potter says after a moment. He coughs awkwardly, looking like he's not sure if he should be discussing this. Draco isn't so sure either. "I noticed in Sixth Year. It was almost the only thing you ate that year."
"I'm getting really fucking sick and tired of you, you know that!" Harry shouted after him, infuriated and petty, wanting the last word.
Draco stood up only when his breaths steadied almost completely. He left the room and came back with a glass of water.
"Draco," Harry said, stepping forward, reaching for him again.
The first night with the coins, Harry is the one that calls Draco first. "Draco? Are you awake?"
Dudley huffed an awed sort of chuckle. Emelie was dragging out a
Dudley spoke to him normally, as if old acquaintances. He asked him who the bag was for, and Harry told him it was for his spouse. Dudley was telling him that the bag in his own hand was for his wife too, that it was her birthday, and Emelie told Harry that she was the one that picked it out, smiling broadly at him, and Harry smiled back at her.
On a Sunday afternoon, Bill dropped by, as Hermione had forewarned, but he dropped by without a firecall and at an extremely inopportune moment. They quickly jumped away from each other when they saw him there. Malfoy, standing a considerable distance away with his palms on his hips, burning his own mortified hole pointedly through the ground.
"Yes. Quite," Draco agreed. "So you keep saying."
Harry has read them so many times, when he could bear it, before he thought Draco would forget him. They are almost ingrained into his mind.
It's his name. Just his name in a hushed voice. And then the voice registers in his mind and he stills, so still that all he can hear is the sound of winds, the sound of rustling leaves. The sound of soft kisses, of wild dancing and unbridled laughter.
focus? Not even being the Saviour of the Wizarding World can give you instant knowledge on anatomy or how to perform magical surgery."
Matthew gasps, clutching his chest and looking at him with hurt-filled eyes. "You poked me!..."
"What would people
* * *
"I don't—it just started—hurting—" Draco choked out, as Harry was maneuvering himself around him, pulling him back against his chest, in the cradle of his legs. Draco was heavy against his sternum. He pulled him tight, wrapping his arms around him, putting his cheek to his forehead.
“But it doesn’t change anything. I’ve watched you, Harry, all these years and it… honestly, I don’t know if I’ll ever be sorry enough.”
brushes Draco's hair from his temple.
"You can't force yourself to be with her," Draco says, coldly.
, Draco thinks, droopy eyes roving up over wild raven hair—down to the slight crook at the bridge of a nose, and the lashes on cheeks, lining the edge of closed eyes, and him, swathed under dim blue lights. Potter's chest is a gentle heave of slow, steady breathing against Draco's chin, face so close their noses were brushing, his arm warm and loose around his waist. Draco's eyes burn, gritty with fatigue, locked still on the sight of his comfort.
"I hope they'll tell you about me," was what Harry heard Draco murmur once, just between him and Teddy, as he was coming into the room. "If nothing else, I hope they'll tell you that I loved you very much."
There's something else brimming along with his anger.
Silence came over them, long and uneasy, fear and uncertainty coiled up in a corner of the room, and they were all looking away, trying not to acknowledge it.
"It's why when I saw her walk into your compartment in the train, I was terrified of how she'd feel, seeing you there."
Near the end of November, Harry receives another letter, this time from Narcissa.
Draco doesn't say anything, only clears his throat again, as if deeply embarrassed. There is a long silence, then, Harry looking down at the silver of sheets between his fingers, listening to the sound of winter winds outside and Ron's loud, even inhales and exhales in the room, the utter hush between him and Draco besides their soft breathing. Dwelling in the heated tenderness low in his stomach.
"What are you reading?" Draco asked, having settled next to him on another weekend night, leaning back with his open bottle.
He was angry at first. He was so angry, over the layer of his hurt and grief, that Draco just left like that. That he
Harry finds himself dawdling around on his own instead, wondering why he can't seem to get himself to bridge this distance between him and Ginny these days.
It's only when Potter's fingers touch his cheek that he feels the dampness of his own grief, the force of his own love mingled with it. He hears the tremor of his own breathing.
Draco's visible grey eyes crinkled against the weariness of them. He shrugged. "He wasn't getting it."
"Would you really?" Hermione said, smiling.
"Draco."
"I—" Draco licks his dry lips.
He made his way down the stairs. Draco was still sitting on the couch by the fireplace, still in the clothes he'd worn to the party, his coat over his arm. He was just staring off into the middle distance, a furrow between his brows. He was quivering slightly, his fists in the knees of his trousers, the curse perhaps having acted up for him for a good while now.
. There was a beat of a pause. "Well. Did your parents know? About you two not wanting
Draco made that same little scoffing noise. He turned away fully, then, back to clinking things, pouring things from one place to another. He added some shapeless lump, that Harry couldn't tell whether it was stone or wood, to the beaker, upturned it into his cauldron once it dissolved. Harry's mind fixed on the line of that lovely jaw. "We won't even call each other by name."
"Potter..." Malfoy sounded distant. More than anything, he sounded weary. "When I'm gone—if you ever think of me... try to remember me as who I was on this day, okay?"
How long had he felt it coming, Harry wondered. Draco must have known something was wrong, for a long time now. He was too smart not to.
Harry frowned, bemused. "No. I don't think you're…"  He thought of some sleepless nights in a tent, a forest, watching the rise and fall of Ron and Hermione's chests when he couldn't stave off the fear, wishing he could have everybody he loved in front of his eyes again. "I understand."
Draco's gaze came back to Harry, away from his thoughts, and his brows twitched. Then a corner of his lips quirked, and he made a sort of noise in his chest, a quietly wry laugh but not quite. Harry couldn't tell if it was mockery or not.
Hermione raised an eyebrow. "You're both in a similar situation. I think that gives you plenty to talk about."
So they stay, and it's a nice morning, spending it with three of his favourite people in the world. It's nice to see Hermione get into a conversation with Draco about her cursebreaking and his potions mastery, to see Ron try with Draco, awkward and fumbling as he is at times, making jokes, and to see Draco trying back with them. There are memories between them — that are difficult to speak of, that only three of them now remember with any clarity. But eventually something falls away, and things flow easily, and in that moment, everything is almost just right in Harry's world.
Draco seemed very distracted by the pictures he was going through.
"I didn't know this would happen," Harry said, after a few seconds, not knowing what else to say.
Malfoy's face was right there in front of him, half-hidden behind the pillow, asleep. Harry closed his eyes, trying to sleep too.
He'd say, huffing, walking backwards.
Draco's eyes were on his face. "I wanted you to be more motivated to…" He paused. His throat shifted, subtle. "to help me."
When he turned around, it was to the sight of Draco on his back, his head near the edge of the bed, about hanging off of it. In his hands, up high over his own face, was the camera turned backward, blatantly recording Harry in all his bare-arsed, naked glory. Draco rolled over to his stomach, until his elbows were on the mattress, flipping the camera between his fingers back upright. He was smirking, his brow cocked, legs amidst white sheets, clad in pants and Harry's pale blue shirt.
face?"
A heartbeat, two. "It doesn't matter anymore," Draco says, slowly. "You don't need to..."
"Why, too good for it, Malfoy?"
Harry smiles, shaking his head. "Sorry. I just… I guess I just can't believe it. That you're really here."
"Damn right it was a shitty thing to do, Harry," Ginny hisses. "Did you think I'd rather you do
Harry drew back a bit, looking down at his face. They were pressed together, half-sat against the headboard. "Yeah?"
"Around every ten hours, give or take."
Harry finds the idea confusing and difficult to grapple with. It seems a distant thing, for the most part, and to test out the thought feels like a mere recited fact that he understands nothing of, like rehearsed words detached from his comprehension. And the memory, returning in sporadic moments, but still too surreal and dreamy most of the time, impenetrable to the film of uneasy skepticism over his mind.
It took a moment for Harry to really understand what he was trying to say. When it sank in, Harry's face furrowed, and he was left voiceless for another moment, mouth working. "Draco," he whispered. "Come on."
Ginny looks up at him. Her eyes are red-rimmed. "I didn't expect you to."
They shared a slight, tentative smile, Draco's so light it was a mere apostrophe at the corner of his mouth. He looked warm and tempting and lovely like that, looking back down at the frypan with his shower-damp hair and still that sweet apostrophe smile. He looked like somebody Harry wanted to wrap his arms around, tuck his nose into the hinge of his jaw, kiss his neck.
But Harry was anyway, before he even realised that was what was happening, before he could even try to stop his face from twisting ugly. His chest was jouncing in dry heaves, and the tears finally fell out of his control, and Draco was curling a hand gently into the back of his hair, an arm folded above himself, leaning his head down to press his lips against Harry's, dry and chaste.
"I'll want somebody who's trying to be better over somebody who firmly thinks himself to be any day."
Harry's eyes burned, and he blinked furiously as he reached for his face and touched his cheeks very softly, whispering, "I know. I know. I'm sorry. God, I'm so sorry—"
His mind is clear, when he looks at him now. He is awake, and they are real. Draco lifts himself up on an elbow, over Harry's face, shifting closer as he pushes back his hair behind an ear. Harry blinks, lips parting, eyes falling down to his mouth. They stay there, full with a quiver of a desperate emotion, and there's no question of the way he still feels. The way he looks at him. The soft way he touches him.
"Harry?" Everything sounded too loud, Hermione's whisper, the scuffle of Ron's footsteps as he came into view beside her, closer. He was a blur of red-hair until he placed Harry's glasses onto his face. The lights were much too bright overhead, shadowing at a side of their faces, highlighting the frizz of Hermione's hair.
, it said.
There was a moment, where he seemed to struggle with what he wanted to say.
Draco shook his head, kissed his wet mouth and brushed his hands over his face again, his hair, over and over, saying, "it's going to be alright now, Harry. It's all going to be alright." Harry was shaking his head, still crying terribly into his skin, not trying to stop at all this time. Draco tilted his face up towards his own with that hand, another at his jaw, and Harry looked up at him, blurry-eyed. Draco was leaning his face over him, achingly tender in a way he'd never been. "Because I'm in love with you. And you're in love with me."
And then he noticed what Draco had been staring at.
Potter's brows furrow. He shakes his head. "I'm not trying to bother you. I just… I didn't think I'd ever see you again after…" He stops, a flicker of something passing through his face. He clears his throat. "I just want to know how you're doing."
to get better."
With his mind a warzone, fear and pain hot and pulling his chest taut, Harry clambered up on the couch, whispering, "I don't know, Merlin, I don't know, I
Malfoy was flustered and speechless at his mishap. Harry held back the snort of laughter behind tight cheeks and lips, a restrained smile playing on his lips.
Warning for a somewhat intense depiction of illness in this chapter
Harry stood up, left them to give them privacy, and stood outside the kitchen full of quiet grief, feeling his own heart weigh down to his feet. He rested his head back against the wall, closed his eyes.
Draco frowned, looking at him as he moved his book a little out of the way. "Why not with you?"
"Then as I told her — we will deal with it before it gets worse."
"Is that your Draco camera?"
Because Harry had loved him with an impossible effortlessness and fervor, and in a life like this, it doesn't seem possible indeed.
"How long?" Harry asked, brushed his fingers at his temple, pushed a lock of his hair behind his ear. Draco's hair was hanging in his face, tilted over Harry's, elbow atop Harry's chest. Harry smoothed a hand over it, brought it up to Draco's wrist.
Far off over her shoulder, there's Ron in all his Quidditch gear, flushed red and grinning. He's glancing at Angelina next to him as he says something to her, throwing the two of them a glance again.
It was only after the pain and malaise had soothed to a phantom that the pull in his chest relaxed, that clarity shone through, breaking them out of their haze.
. He'd only wanted to not be at the Great Hall. But he thinks saying this will make Draco less likely to believe him anyway.
"Explain to me why we still address each other by surnames?" Harry says, lifting his head from his Transfiguration book to look at him.  "You
"No," Harry says. "No, I get it now. Why you did." He pauses, fingers tapping at his knee. "I was angry at first, yeah. But then I… I got it. I mean, I don't think I can even imagine — maybe the closest I can ever get is, you know..." Harry looks up at him, swallowing, "The letters. But even then, I'll never live through them, will I—"
"Fuck!" Draco hurled his glass far off to the side, which was followed by the violent sound of shattering and clinking. He leaned forward onto both his hands, head bowed between his shoulders. He was breathing hard, only lower teeth visible. His eyes were closed, face flushed. "That bastard!" he bellowed, slamming a hand down on the bar.
"Oh," she says. Her face doesn't change beyond an apologetic twitch of her face. "I'm sorry for presuming. He must care for you, if he cried for you."
"Good," Malfoy interrupted. "Meet me outside the kitchens tomorrow at lunch, will you? Come alone."
"It means he will erase everything to do with his dreams," is all she says, but Harry understands what she doesn't say with the way she's looking at him.
, Harry can't say, because it's been years and things are different and Harry doesn't really know how Draco feels about him today, even though he has his hopes.
"I like them," Harry said, frowning.
But Harry couldn't bring himself to talk to Malfoy. He wasn't sure why, beyond that the idea of having a civil, healthy discussion about trying to build a better 'relationship' and, moreover, that it would go down well with Malfoy just seemed
"Fuck," Harry gasped out, nearly a sob, into his neck. He was grappling for him, pulling him close by the waist, trying to breathe through a terror and grief that hadn't happened, that only lived within himself. "Fuck."
One evening, Draco came striding out of the floo and into the drawing room, heading straight towards the bar at a clipped pace. He was fuming, clearly, hands shaking as he poured himself a drink.
"Good," Harry said, shortly. He picked up his drink from the side table, turning his head away to watch the fire in the hearth, dancing around the logs, feeling strange and uneasy.
The day after, Harry tags along with Draco when he goes to see Luna at her place.
"Give or take," Bill said, and then sighed, shook his head. He looked haggard. "But just because the lifespan of the curse is twenty years doesn't mean it
your life, and she may consider herself too dignified for it but today I say it is finally time to invoke—" But then he clamped his upper lip over his lower lip, tight, as if in restraint, looking away. He breathed, slowly, and spoke again only when he was calmer, "She had no part in any of… Surely you agree that—that she deserves better than this.
The thing about his dreams was that nobody was ever sad. Nothing ever hurt. Nobody ever had to hurt unless it was because of something as certain as loss.
"I'm not like that," Harry said, but his voice had faded a little at the end, somewhat confused over whether that was a lie or not.
Draco still hadn't woken, his face so close on the pillow to his own that Harry could see his flaxen eyelashes settled against the skin beneath his eyes. Timelessly, he watched him, observing everything of his beauty as the two of them laid buried under blankets up to their shoulders. He visually outlined his cheekbones, much more visible now than they used to be, and the fairness of his skin, and the full, pink lips parted to breathe in his sleep. He reached and traced it all with his fingers, stroking cheek to mouth, thinking of how close he came to never seeing any of it again. His fingers trembled.
Harry let the conversation derail, and told him another secret, when he thought of one, that time he inadvertently sicced a snake onto his cousin, which did make Draco laugh. Draco asked for another, so Harry told him another, and another, until it was too hard to come up with any more.
Draco laughs, catches his mouth in a kiss, quieting, stilling in the dance. There's only the low rise of a song into the vast space of the night, then, and the quiet sounds of the movement of their lips, and when it breaks, with their foreheads pressed together.
"Draco—?"
it's a touchy subject."
The moment settles a bit later, and Draco draws himself away with his hands running down his face.
Draco had said.
They had made their way over to the Slytherin common room, where there were far less people to face, and then to Draco's dorm.
But then he always remembered Draco saying,
Harry thought it would be a while before they get to this. But it's almost a relief, the prospect of getting it all out of the way, to make sense of their story together.
He stood to his feet, slightly wobbly, and walked Draco over to where all the people in love were dancing together, laughing with their faces close together, speaking in low, intimate voices.
A lot happened, and then Draco happened.
But there wasn't much Bill knew either. There wasn't much anybody knew about this damned curse.
made this?" He sounds somewhat incredulous about it.
It's a bit strange at first, even if Harry likes it all very much — but it feels a little off-kilter, trying to relearn the way they were, only now there's another layer over it that allows them to kiss behind statues and in alcoves, and fall asleep close and warm under invisibility cloaks in the corners of towers, and sneak in and out of each other's beds some particularly courageous nights and hold hands hidden between their bodies at the edges of lakes.
He was also fairly certain Malfoy often stared at Harry like he was the bane of his existence, when Harry wasn't noticing it. He'd caught those bored, half-fronded eyes fixed on him once, jaw supported by a hand. Harry's gaze had lowered before darting right back up to him, frowning, hand faltering around the knife he was lathering the cheese on his toast with. Malfoy had promptly sneered at him, hand moving out from under his head, turning away, leaving Harry to stare at his back.
"We're going to get us a Mind-Healer."
Harry stared at him. He didn't know what to say. He didn't know if he blamed him for something he was just as much a victim of. He didn't feel, at a visceral level, that the reason for his outburst last night had much to do with any of that.
badly, Potter." He uncrossed his arms, pulled his silver ring out of his finger with one swift tug of a hand and then held it up, shining it in the light for Harry to see. "A fake proposal."
The alteration did work, was the thing, and now the curse would die out in exactly five years from the day it happened. They would be twenty-four by then, and what Harry was realising was that twenty years was unimaginably long, but five years was still an overwhelmingly long time.
"Your hair would never cooperate enough for a mullet," Draco said, with a wave of his hand, still seeming amused. "Come now, we have to see the Taiwan Pavilion."
Slytherin has forty points on Gryffindor as of now. The Golden Snitch hasn't yet been seen by either of the Seekers. In a time-out between the game, Potter pulls his broom to the right, swooping down and flying over towards Draco. He lowers down a little, coming to a floating still in front of him.
Jenny calls his name shyly, and Draco leans close so she can ask him a question that Harry misses, Scorpius still clinging to him.
And so like that, they fall asleep, close and warm.
"Why'd they let
"Er, right. Yeah." Harry lifted his hand, somewhat bemused. It hovered for a second. Two. Then, hesitantly, he slipped it over Malfoy's. He was cold. "Goodbye, Malfoy."
Harry half-smiled feebly, nodded and ducked his head down again.
Just to do something with his sweaty palms, Harry reached out and grabbed the menu. He opened it, flipped a few pages to a random one, and nearly balked at the prices.
When they were young, Draco would fold his notes into origami and send them flying in classes to see Harry smile at them. Stupid, silly things, ridiculous drawings, sarcastic quips and comments about certain classes, mainly History of Magic and Divination, that he'd think Harry would find funny.
"Um. I
So he finishes up his drink in a quick gulp for an extra push, and then stands, excusing himself as well. He distantly hears Ron ask him where he's going, and Harry tells him just as distantly something vague, the loo, but probably was too low to be heard under the music. He moves through the crowd of dancing people, apologises quickly for accidentally spilling somebody's drink over, and then towards the door of Draco's dorm.
It took awhile for the words to sink in, so bewildered he was. "I'm… I'm married. If you forgot that."
, Draco thinks. He carries it through the day with him, and the way it feels separate of him, not him at all, because he has somewhere to go back to now.
Harry hides a smile behind his fingers, one arm folded across his chest. Draco somehow manages to catch him anyway and glares, that scowl of his that Harry's noticed Scorpius take on at times. Harry wipes it off quickly.
"Just another act, mate," Ron told him. "It was all an act."
"HARRY? OH THANK GOD—wait... what." Ron stared at him for a long moment. His face scrunched up. "Harry?"
Christmas came around nearly two weeks later, and the party was, as with every year, held at the Burrows. The Malfoys were invited as well, both Draco and Narcissa, who Draco said was uncertain about it at first, but ultimately gave in to Andromeda's insistence.
The first thing he saw was bushy hair, and a blurry, frowning face over him, Hermione's. She was pushing back the hair at his temple.
"Is that the highest praise I can get from you?" Harry asked, with a somewhat amused smile.
"You'll just make yourself miserable, and you're a coward if you can't tell her you don't want her to her face. You're a coward for letting those Weasleys dictate anything of your life.
said something, but then he was waking up again, trying to sort through his delirious thoughts. A hazy memory of Hermione and Ron's faces came back to him. It was night, and there was nobody there but him now, in what looked like the same white-painted room, just greyed in the dark.
He was trying to hurt him. He knew that was what he was doing. Harry swallowed, once, twice, closing his eyes again, until he felt like he could open them again without losing his composure.
Harry nodded, seeing himself floating above the grass.
That Draco had called him
Touch by Sleeping At Last
There, he stays with Pansy and Blaise, with plans to get a job and save up money and build himself a life of his own. The distance and time was there between them at first, but eventually they bridge the gap. Eventually, the three of them come to be as they used to be, teasing him, a chaos of banter that they always pull him into, and maybe Draco does manage to act enough like the person they seem to be looking for, as if his body has its own practiced will. It helps him, just a bit, to not think about all that he left behind, to keep himself here and awake.
But he's being a coward, and he knows it.
Mingling with it all was that burning throb in his chest again, the one that kept trying to force his hands and body into something imprudent and unwise, the one that had kept coming back over and over all throughout the day, that was now overwhelming his entire body with the urge that gnawed at him from his skin to his bone. The one he thought he could never give in to.
"Harry." Draco stops with a sigh, seeming to struggle for words, shaking his head slightly. "She's just—"
by his collarbone, to remind himself that magic was still beautiful. That he can feel it now, again.
“But I guess in a way,” Harry says, swallowing. He shrugs. “In a way, Draco needed to be away from me. That’s what he said too. And I’d rather have him with me as he is now than...than how he was before. Because that's when I was only hurting him without knowing. And then I... did hurt him, knowingly. And I don’t know either if I’ll ever be sorry enough.”
"Do you want to go home now?" Harry asked, when he awoke a half an hour later.
looked at him." She scoffs, shaking her head, leaning back against the headboard. "I tried to ignore it for the longest time, but — eventually I did realise there was no chance, because you weren't even into girls."
"When I was six and listening to all those old fairytale stories, all the princes, the knights, I had always imagined me and you there instead. But then I met you, of course, and I… well, I had to repress the fact that my six year old self ever did that."
"Fucking bastard," Potter says, still with that rough, uneven rasp.
They had changed into hospital gowns, thin and loose, legs covered under blankets, laid on twin beds. Malfoy was ashen, his mouth small, his brows creased. His eyes darted down at his hands, before he seemed to remember himself and straightened, all haughty composure. Narcissa had been due to return from France just two days before to be at her son's side, but an outbreak of Dragon Pox in her area had the borders closed down, restricting all travel by Portkey.
"This is so
There is a terrible sort of dread swelling up in Harry's chest, overtaking him at the thought of Draco's mind lost in dreams that kept it safe, slowly killed his body on the outside, his eyes blank and unseeing, his body unmoving and sprawled on the floor of the Manor, of the cellar, on a hospital bed. At the thought of a world where Draco was never saved, like so many others that Harry held dear. A world where Harry came for him too late, and Draco wasn't right here next to him, where he never brought him sweets and sent him ridiculous drawings in class and fell asleep under a sky full of astronomy with him.
In Eighth Year, Harry had tried his best to steer clear of Draco Malfoy.
She leaves, when he huffs exasperatedly and slumps back down. Then comes somebody else through the curtains.
It meant something entirely different, hearing it from Malfoy, that he deserved to live even after how much he had failed, after how many people had died in a war that was between
you would likely have resented me for all of it, for being a coward and not taking our only chance out, for keeping both of us stuck. And that didn't sound like a very appealing life for myself, of course. But I didn't want to choose something just because I was afraid, for once."
There was a pause, a long one, before, "Yes, I
Draco hummed, affirmative and soft.
But there's him — Draco, and then it's hard to think of anything but him. How much Harry wants.
"I don't know. That's what I'm supposed to be finding out when I go," Harry answered, sounding as frustrated as he felt.
"Why you awake?" Harry mumbles, slumber-thick and running together. It's still dark outside, near the beginning of dawn.
Harry laughs, and then it fades, because Draco's eyes are still red-rimmed, and then he's blinking as he turns his head away, hands still trembling around Harry's biceps. Harry doesn't think he entirely understands why he looks the way he does, wants to ask but he knows Draco doesn't like to talk. So he just draws him in against himself, tugging his face in against his shoulder by the back of his head, brushing a hand up through his hair.
"Alright?"
"Yeah. Sorry. I'm not trying to sound like I'm… let's just talk about something else—"
In the comfortable silence that followed, Harry remembered all the secrets kept close to his chest, that he could no longer tell Draco. He could not tell him of what Harry had known since the beginning, because telling him now would mean bringing in all the doubts that they'd been trying to avoid, that would irrevocably hurt him and put him in danger. He was still riding on the waves of certain emotions, maybe, the terrifying clarity of near-loss and grief and finality, how it had lied under the surface of every passing minute.
Career Day comes around. The parents enter the classroom, introduce themselves and talk about what they do for a living, and leave to the sound of the kids' applause with a smile.
His home is not a tainted Manor where his entire childhood was spent. His home is not a dusty, ancient school he grew up in, brought ruin into. His home is not a beautiful green-eyed boy who once danced under the stars with him and laughed with him and brought him lunch, held him while he fell asleep. Who smiled at him soft and kissed him hard, told him he was in love with him. Who could not see enough in him to choose him.
* * *
Draco huffed, turning his head away, that private edge of a laugh. He lifted his head again, meeting Harry's eyes with his own, smirking back. They seemed so bright in the squint of daylight. "Alright," he said, low, as if accepting a challenge.
looking quite nice right now, isn't he?"
, Draco whispered into his mouth, only just louder than the crackle of fire, and the rest of it,
Draco went inside for a moment, announcing his greeting to Andromeda and that he was going outside along with Teddy, before he came back out, clicked the door shut, slipping his hands in his pockets and moving down the stairs.
"Babe," Harry said, squinting, half-certain Draco might accept this one.
Draco smirks. "Was? What, you're not anymore?"
"Viktor Krum. I say, he was quite dashing."
Harry nodded. And then stopped. He frowned.
"That's not really a secret," Harry said, laughing. "You made fun of it like, all the time."
Malfoy walked in front of him, pulled a chair back from under the table with one hand, the other in his pocket, and then paused. He stepped back.
"Are you okay?"
"Will you teach me?"
"No," was all Malfoy said to him, plain and simple, cutting him off in the middle of his riveted explanation. Harry stopped pacing, turning to look at him where he sat upright on Harry's couch, his shirt untucked and missing a top button, sleeves open, fingers at one wrist working on buttoning them. He looked bored, ruffled up, his hair a wavy tousle behind his ears, ending where a flush always lingered at his neck and jaw after sex.
"You might guess where it came from," Harry said, letting out a wry breath, as Draco touched it beneath the centre of his glasses. It was slight, hardly noticeable unless somebody looked very closely.
"—MALFOY, OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR RIGHT NOW BEFORE I HEX IT OFF—"
"I don't hate you," Harry says. "But honestly, sometimes, I wish you never said anything."
It seemed that these days, all Harry did was look at him, at breakfast from over the rim of his cup while taking a sip, from under the bow of his head over the plate at dinner, quiet in the doorway sometimes as Draco stared into middle distance, drinking just enough to seem a little more distantly calmer, from the rug of Andromeda's drawing room as Draco watched Teddy, gave him half-smiles that wore at the edges and spoke to him in too low of a voice, brushed a hand over Teddy's curls and seemed lost in thought around him.
close to leaving if you don't—"
if you—" He stopped, breathed, feeling agitated and antsy. He then moved closer to him. "Come on, Malfoy."
on the announcement of her passing. Scorpius would have only been a few months old, at most.
She stills at that, her hands stopping as well.
He steeled himself for Draco shutting down on what he said next.
The first time anyone tried to teach him was Ron who, bless him, spent many patient mornings in First Year trying to explain it to him, doing it for him to show him all the steps. For whatever reason, Harry's brain never quite managed to catch on to most of it. Ron left it alone only when he managed to succeed in making it into a somewhat passable imitation.
"Yeah," Harry said, just as low, and then smiled. He still felt dizzy and warm from the kiss. He laughed, and then Elias laughed. "Yeah. Let's go inside."
After a while, Harry mustered all his courage, and looked up at him, and he forced himself to say, "I can't get you out of my head." His voice broke off a bit at the end, and he breathed a tremulous sound, a helpless flick at his lips. "And I'm in love with you. And you don't have to—to say anything, or do anything or worry about—I wasn't going to…" He swallowed. "but I have loved you for months now."
, you know. Make me laugh. I think — I think he was the only one that I wanted around me then. George too, but even he sort of held back, and I didn't want anyone to hold back. I just wanted everything to keep going like it had before so I could just
After a quick charm wiped Malfoy and his hand, he pulled Malfoy's pants and trousers up, watched him closely for changes, but he was still shivering, just the same. Malfoy's brows twitched, and he looked confused, shifting on his back a little. He made a rough and strangled sound.
He trailed off, eyes straying. His throat convulsed again, hard.
"And look how it turned out!"
happen?"
Still, a song from the party throbs through the walls. Harry worries that somebody might be looking for him, but is also half-certain most of the people who'd want to would be passed out before they could. Except for Hermione, maybe. He isn't sure how Draco feels about other people knowing, but Harry is still uncertain if he wants anybody to know yet.
"You're mad, you know that?" Harry told him, with a huff. Draco bounced his brows at him, smirking. Harry broke into another laugh, and then sank down onto that hot mouth again, closing into daylight between them.
"It's just... it's interesting. I've been reading up on it." There's something strange about the way she sounds, her voice light and careful. Harry looks up at her. There's something strange about the way she's holding herself as well.  "I've read that the person the user craves is the one that features most in the dreams. And, more often than not, if there's a romantic one, then it's that person mostly. Not always. I suppose it depends on the person, and what they value most, but for loads of people, it'd be that person they'd spend a good part of their lives with."
Harry thought of him, eighteen years old and curled up and lonely against the side of a couch. The way he'd straightened upon seeing him, a flush in his cheeks, eyes red-rimmed.
At the reception party, after the dinner and Harry's best man speech (through which Ron began to weep again), Harry had taken Draco to dance as well, Draco leading it. He brushed his fingers at Draco's hairline.
"Where are all your friends from school?" Harry asked, after the second time he got the bottle back. "I mean. You never have anybody over except your mum now."
Like a tidal wave, Potter comes crashing back into his life once more.
"Oh, alright." She shook her bushy hair out of her face, pausing at the mess on the table, and then dragged one of the chairs over to the counter, Harry doing the same. She put the book down on the countertop. "Well, so. I brought this
It is something that overrides this lifetime of his father's shame and disappointment for Draco's display of emotions. It's hard to care in that moment, to even remember when his head is already so full of another lifetime, to have it rise above the intensity of his feelings.
"About the dreams," Potter says, then, and Draco's hands go numb, his heart jolting painfully, kicking up towards a violent storm. "You dreamed of me."
Draco tensed slightly against him, though his face stayed very much maintained on the smile. He glanced at Harry, quick, quicker to look away. "It wasn't quite ideal for either of us at first, as I'm sure you might have heard, but…" He trailed off, and the pause went a little too long, and he seemed a bit nervous. Harry thought, again, of the last time they'd been somewhere like this together, his own shameful lack of control as he'd snapped. The quiver of hurt in Draco's eyes, throwing the papers under Harry's face the next day.
Hermione was frowning, bemused. Ron was worrying on his upper lip.
Malfoy's calculating stare or studious frown on him whenever they were doing the necessitated contact, flicking away whenever Harry caught him. Harry stopped looking back at him, afraid of what Malfoy might see, afraid he'd somehow read all of the truth there. Malfoy was often the one who'd come to Harry first, because it always came on faster for him now than it did for Harry.
Luna is still here when he has to set his jaw hard against the tremors moving down to his is hands and shoulders, against the burn making his face and eyes warm. She is still here when his breaths hitch dangerously, when he begins to dry heave sobs.
"Sorry," Harry said, quickly, removing his fingers. "Sorry. Go back to sleep."
to be something like that. This was a world of magic, after all.
Harry leaned himself against the doorway, folding his arms over his chest. He was watching Draco bustle around in his lab, working on whatever it was he was working on these days. He never answered Harry when he asked, trying to talk to him, shamefully desperate for him to.
" He broke off, panting heavily, his face now doleful and distressed.
Ron and Hermione still don't know about his escapades with Draco, and he isn't sure how they'd feel about it either.
Draco smiled slightly. "Anything I don't know."
Harry shook his head, corner of his mouth squinching up.
Ron's gaping a little, and then breaks into a huff of a grin, deflating back against the booth. That's Ron, the kind of friend who gets happy purely for him. "Harry, that's — "
"Ah, but see." Potter inclines forward and down, hands wrapped around the broom, to lean his face close to his, a smile setting his face alight in the day. "The game isn't over just yet. Wish me good luck?"
A day later, Harry shows up with two coins.
"Hello to you too. You aren't eating or sleeping."
"Nothing," Harry said.
When he reached the fruit bowl portrait, he found Malfoy sitting up underneath the portrait against the wall, one leg up and an arm hanging off his knee. He was staring at the ground, his gaze rooted to a spot, unaware of Harry's presence. He still looked as if he'd hardly slept last night, scarlet circles around his tired eyes that made something deep inside Harry's chest ache.
Draco thinks, and then promptly whirls around, preparing to make a getaway.
"Why not?"
in the world that would ever..." He doesn't finish it, but Harry's face is already twisting, and Ron is coming back inside, closing the door. He's crossing the room and settling back beside him, hugging him by the shoulders.
"I think I may know what you're here for, Harry," is what she says after the pleasantries, the lapse into silence. "I'm afraid I can't give it to you."
Potter pauses, looking at him. The surprise seeps slowly into his face first, and then pleasantly so a moment later.
* * *
"Not really, no." Harry throws him a remorseful glance. "Sorry, mate. I know we've been planning it since like, Second Year, but I just…
Harry tries to look as serious as possible. "Yeah."
So Harry gets off his bed as soundlessly as he can, gets out of his room. The coin in his hand speaks at the stretch of his silence, cracking, "
"I used to spit in my cousin's late night snacks," Harry said, instead, just the closest thing at random his mind could grasp. "Because he would wake me up at like, two, for a sandwich."
Harry kept them all shrunken in a box under the bed until they exploded back into their full sizes one day, crowding their room. Draco had to consistently badger him to throw them away.
Harry did not know that. "He was?"
He goes with Hermione and Ron to a pub every weekend. They come in sometimes with a suggestion of somebody they know or the other, a co-worker, cousin of a friend, this one bloke they've heard a lot of good things about, trying to get him to move on without telling him that's what he has to do.
His wand was out by the next second, and he lurched forward toward the man, ready to stride over and—
They had sex whenever they felt able, though it was more a chore these days than anything. Some days neither of them, or one of them, just didn't want to, so they didn't. So they just dealt with it every six to eight hours, irritated and tired and sick of it and each other.
Malfoy had hardly raised his gaze from the ground the last couple of months, so this was a change. A good change, Harry supposed, but also a curious one.
There's a fester of a sickening feeling spreading through his skin and chest. "Don't
"Well." Naborowski gestured between the two of them. "Who fell in love first?"
Nothing was said for a long time. Draco was unmoving, his hair still in the way of his face, with his face turned towards the paintings, but he wasn't really looking at them anymore.
"Your notes and stuff," Harry says, right as Draco is pulling it close and taking off the lid. "From school."
What if Malfoy
Maybe he is just in love with a dream now, more than anything, and Potter deserves better than somebody that can't wake up.
Malfoy had gone silent for a moment. His gaze flickered with something, an almost stunned sort of pinch, and then quick to evaporate with a blink, his face cementing. Then, slowly pressing the pads of his fingers against the tabletop, he leaned forward to meet Harry's eyes coldly, "The feeling is
most of the time."

close to throwing you into the lake, you tosser.
"Why, we have to get him drunk then," Draco says, seriously.
"Wait for me," he whispered, a brush against Harry's mouth.
"I know." Narcissa brushes her hand over the side of his hair, pulling it back. "But I hate seeing you here as well."
"I… my husband, I had to…" Harry was saying, trying to explain in a habit long forgotten and left behind, rising back to the surface. He was six and eight and ten again, after his magic had gone off in an explosion of his emotions, trying to explain to his aunt and uncle, apologising over and over. He realised then what he'd said, thought of Vernon's long-winded rants about
"Yeah," Harry said, stroking his hairline, resisting the urge to break through the knots in his hair. Sometimes he would do that whilst he was asleep, very gently, trying not to wake him. "I did."
"I came back."
One night, fairly drunk together again in front of the fireplace, Harry said, "Will you play the violins? I'm always showing you my paintings, but you've never shown me your violin — your violin playing — "
The plot of Part One as goes:
"It feels like you're never really
on the ink, faded blue stains still left behind, and then repairs the shattered bottle. He puts the box under his bed, charmed to disintegrate if anybody other than him ever touches it. He stands up from his chair, abrupt, grabs his coat on his way out of the room.
Draco's silver gaze fixated on him, remaining fixated for a moment. Perhaps he was trying to gauge his honesty.
Harry snorts a small laugh. "Really?"
It's about two weeks later, at a New Years' party in the Eighth Years Commons, that they finally speak again.
"Your father used to come and speak to me, did you know."
Harry halts there, finally looking up at him. Draco’s eyes widen, terror travelling through him. He  has no idea what he must look like to Harry, a whirlwind of emotions reflecting on his face. He knows Scorpius sometimes ends up listening to Draco talking about Harry to Pansy, but he's still reeling frantically on,
Draco hummed, lips bitten back on the edge of a smirk, looking away.
"Only if Mrs. and Mrs. Oakley say it's alright."
"I do."
He's never noticed these things about a boy. He hasn't noticed he's been noticing them about Draco. Or maybe he has. Just hasn't thought much of what it meant for him to be.
He certainly would not have held doors open for them. They could open their own doors for themselves, thank you very much.
. That is, a form of muggle transportation—"
Draco's breaths are shallowing in his chest as he stares at him. He blinks, finally, a quiver running through his face. He keeps himself still, but for a convulsion of his throat.
"We're not," Harry said, coldly, cutting him off. He stood up, abrupt, the chair screeching backward. "We are
"Not too far off from what you are then," Draco says, breaking into a tremor of laughter half-way through when Harry shoves at him, laughing too.
They drink their coffee in silence after. Harry lets it go on, so Draco can settle down some, and thinks back through these past years. He thinks, again, of all the things he has been wanting to say, that he used to say into a coin that had nobody on the other end. There were so many things, and yet now, finally sitting here in front of Draco, in the surreal wonder of a moment he once waited and hoped for desperately, they've all seemed to become vapour in his mind. He wants to ask him so many things —
somber, maybe. Black. Something much less mellow than shades between red and pink. He'd known his favourite colour was green and silver in school, all Slytherin pride.
"It's okay if you like blokes, you know," Ron says. "If you felt...feel that way for... Malfoy. I was just angry because you hurt Gin, and you need to seriously make it up to her for that. But there is nothing in the world,
He can't ever stay here.
"That's not for you to worry about. I've got enough of that."
in against a wall, hands hot and heavy up his abdomen and scraping nails on his skin, asking Harry in a whisper, a breathy murmur over his mouth,
In June of 2002, a summer party that took place at their own flat, Hermione proposed to Ron in front of all their friends and family.
"Oh fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck—" Malfoy grabbed Harry's hand, spun them both around so hard Harry nearly tripped on his own feet and
He is a lovely child, with his father’s signature white-blond hair, but his curls and dark gentle eyes are all hers. That's what Scorpius told Harry,
"Can I see them?"
, but as of now, I believe the priority should be on saving lives rather than weeping over lost love lives."
"Goodbye, Potter."
Potter swallows. He looks at him, or tries to, only he can't seem to do it fully.
He doesn't understand how his mother does it. Live here. Forced to live with the ghosts of their past. Forced to live in a place that no longer feels like her own. He knows he can't ever.
"Outlining," Harry said. He didn't always get him fully right in his paintings.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry smiled slightly at that, and it only just soothed a little of something horrible and hollow in him.
"Oh, I took this one," Draco said, showing him a picture of Harry. There was wind in his hair, his face a little bemused. "Remember? At least
"You don't have to leave everytime we come around," she was saying. "I mean, I'm… I would be alright if you stayed with us."
Another year and a half later, Harry finishes his training at St. Mungos, gets his first ever job.
"What happened?"
He receives the note back some moments later, when he's long stopped anticipating any response.
"I've made up my mind already," he said, softly insistent. "I can't—I can't go back."
The Healer had said that the symptoms would be fatigue and weakness, magical sensitivity, erratic magic, nosebleeds, nausea, body pain, chills. He couldn't think of anything at first, but then he remembered Draco trying to cast the animation spell, and he remembered Draco looking tired and skipping his classes, and he remembered Draco sometimes seeming to need a minute after flooing in or out of anywhere, and he remembered Draco disappearing into the bathroom in some haste, the back of his hand under his nose, coming back looking strange and troubled.
There was Molly, and Hermione sat against his other side, her bushy hair on his shoulder. Bill was standing outside, talking to Xavier and Healer Francine, hands on his hips. Ron was there trying to make him laugh for all the last ten minutes, murmuring just between their group, Hermione throwing a short, hushed quip in with a smile every now and then. Molly whacked Ron on the shoulder with an admonishing word when he said something that was too much.
"Why?"
Luna jumps up from her seat when her eyes catch Draco, sliding through people and over to him. She is seemingly insistent on calling him over to their group, despite his protests, and then she swirls a thread of magic around his hand, smiling woozily, pulling at him. He's still protesting, annoyed, but his words die out right when he sees Harry, flicks to somewhere beside him. Quieter, to Luna, he says, "I have homework."
with a relationship right now, you know? I can't be what you need me to be right now."
The grip of fear and grief around Harry's heart soothed of its own accord, the tremors up his face smoothing slightly, just as Draco was letting him go. His eyes were still closed under clumped lashes, his breaths slowing, even if a little unsteady. He pressed his temple against Draco's, could feel his gaze boring into him, and all he wanted was to kiss him again and to keep kissing him until something in this sick and damned curse gave, and gave Draco back to him.
He withdraws it from her. She stares at him for a moment. "Sorry. I don't…"
Luna's face lights up on seeing Draco. She stands from her deeply, unsightly couch, and she runs across the distance, flinging herself right into his arms as he catches her. Draco is laughing as he stumbles back, holding her tight. Harry thinks of the way he used to move away from everybody's hands, and how he's told Luna in his letters of forgetting those memories of what had happened to him too.
Malfoy shifted his jaw, looking away, and then down at the hat in his hands, as if he was feeling too exposed and vulnerable and uncomfortable about it. "It's just one day," he said quietly. "You won't have me anywhere near you again after this, Potter. I promise."
Ron frowns, bemused, and then narrows his eyes. "Do we want to know?" He looks over at Harry, and then turns to Hermione, who looks equally puzzled and unsure if she's interested. Harry, on the other hand, may be more curious than anything.
Harry frowned at the odd question. Coming from Malfoy, at least, it certainly was. What did he care about that?
The light from the window is bright through the kitchen, yellow through the transclucent curtains. Their old wireless is playing a song from the table, and Harry pulls Draco off the counter, into a dance, grinning at him.
Harry untangled himself out of bedsheets, finding his pants and trousers on the floor by the door.
"Oh, I'm, uh," Harry said, gestured vaguely. "Well, I'm just taking him out for a bit, to the park nearby."
" Narcissa is mumbling, crying. Draco shushes her, burying his nose into her shoulder. She swallows hard, composing herself. She touches his upper back, drawing back from him. "Draco, I
One day, in one of the owls, Draco sends him a Galleon, with a note telling him to call when he gets it. These, he made himself,
Harry walked inside only then. "Hello," he said in general, moving over to kiss Draco chastely on the lips. Draco seemed a bit dazed by it, flicking a glance over at Ron and Hermione.
There was complete silence then. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed with intrigue, snow-blonde head tilted slightly.
"Draco said my magic would go away," Harry said, not quite sure why he did. It seemed a strange thing to imagine, a distant idea that he couldn't entirely grasp, like most things now. He hadn't been able to entirely grasp the war happening, and this curse happening, and now he couldn't entirely grasp Draco dying, his magic going away. Like it was all too big for his mind to take in.
There are footsteps, then, nearing towards him. Harry lifts his head just as Draco's nimble hands reach for his tie, draws Harry to face him with a small tug on it, unknotting it completely.
Now he wondered if it didn't matter, if Malfoy had maybe just needed someone. Anyone. Even if it was an ex-childhood rival he hardly even liked or wanted around him.
Scorpius is standing next to him, whispering something to him. Draco gently pushes him to go sit down, and Scorpius does so in the back of the class. The children's hubbub of conversation settles down after Harry's calls for silence.
Harry smiled at him on the screen, at the turn of his face, behind the camera where he could not see it.
There was no hiding it, and maybe it didn't matter in the end anyway, because now that it was out, Harry could think that maybe it was better that Draco knew now, here, when he was still here, that Harry had loved him when he was.
Once they were out, thankfully unnoticed and unrecognized any further, Harry turned him around, and then wondered if that unbidden touch would offend the Slytherin. It didn't. Malfoy just moved with his touch and rolled his eyes, as if he knew what was coming.
But he didn't have a phone or anything. He just had his wand. Olivia directed him into the kitchen for privacy, and Harry went.
Draco's eyes widens slightly. He draws it away and looks down at it. He murmurs
"There's a lot on your mind today, isn't there?" Luna says, her head tilted. "I can see a lot of Wrackspurts around your head."
Draco huffed, a little quavering, his smile small. He shook his head. "Years. Even before the… I've wanted you so long."
Draco walks inside the room, soundless but for Longbottom's breaths too loud in his sleep. He closes the door behind him, casts a wandless Lumos with a wave of a hand as he heads towards the bed. He slides the gloves off his fingers by the middle, throws them aside onto his trunk as he passes it by, and drops down onto the edge of his bed to tug his shoelaces off. He puts his shoes aside, and then looks down at the coat, still draped over his arm.
Draco looks up at him, shifting his jaw. There's too much to the answer of that question. There's not much that he can say of it, and Potter's staring back at him, waiting for it. Draco's vision focuses on brilliant green eyes, thick black lashes, and he is so very beautiful, the only thing still as bright and beautiful as his dreams—the dreams of whom kept Draco as sane as he still is, somehow, after everything.
That night, laid facing each other on the bed, he told Draco all of it — the way he grew up, locked away in cupboards and starving through nights for missed chores or retaliations, treated like a child slave. How it felt to be unwanted until Ron and Hermione and all his friends, who were the only family he ever had, who had given him everything without letting him feel like he had to be deserving of it.
The answer had to be delayed, because Malfoy started laughing all over again.
it's an old and comprehensive book on bonds that's very hard to come by. The amount of strings I had to pull! Also, Bill's learned some things in the last month. Everything I tell you, pass it on to Malfoy, will you?" She waited for Harry's nod, and then continued, shifting around on the chair to get comfortable. "Bill wanted to come by and tell you all this himself, but he's been swamped up in cases. He's been running himself ragged researching on the curse in his free time
"A lot happened," Ginny says.
On the closest edge of slumber, Harry's mind swims with faint and afar thoughts of holding his hand, or holding his waist. Of touching him somewhere warm and real. His fingers reach across the space between them, the tips of them brushing over the soft skin of Draco's wrist. He feels the beat of his heart at its innerside, feels the life of him, reminding himself that he is still here.
Harry went back to reading.
"But you didn't do it. Why?"
There was a jolt up Harry's arm when Malfoy touched him back, a swift rush of energy flooding into his body, laced with a strange mixture of malaise and warmth. Harry jerked his hand out of his grip abruptly, like he'd been burned. Malfoy blinked, turning his own hand over in front of him, looking at the back of it.
Harry remembered the ball party from last year, that he'd been forced to tag along with. Draco never asked him to come to such functions after that, always just came home earlier.
"I don't want to go." Ron looks like a kicked crup, walking up the stairs to the third floor alongside Harry to begrudgingly meet up with Hermione at the library. "Merlin, save me."
"Wait, I — I do have more to say," Harry says, quickly slipping inside and clicking the door shut behind him. He pushes his hands into his trouser pockets, looking down at his shoes. "I was an absolute tosser for ignoring you, and I'm sorry. I just... I needed time."
"Draco, I've been
"I'm not—very good with pain," he whispered, terrified. His breath hitched. Harry moved his hands up and down his hair, the nape of his neck, his spine.
There are days when he's somehow calmer and more comfortable and open, more at home with Harry somehow.
, and it's only the start of the term. She's easier on Ron now, after hearing of his plans to help George at the shop after graduation, but only marginally so because
There was nothing then. There was just the sound of night winds whipping past his ears in the silence, rustling grass and leaves and clothes and hair, and Harry thought, maybe he didn't want to know. Maybe he shouldn't have asked.
"I know," Potter says, quietly. This time, when he looks at Draco, he does so fully. His face seems to grow years older with the words. "Draco, I know."
Harry yelped, quickly putting his trousers up in front of himself. "What are you—did you just try to take a picture of my—"
Draco steps back with a scoff, crossing his arms. "Nevertheless, you understand that this calls for vengeance?"
Draco blinked, hard and fast, and then he was gritting his teeth, turning swiftly past Harry and pacing back and forth, furiously declaring that —
Harry goes home with his own voice distant in his ears, and he doesn't sleep well for weeks.
Harry shifts at this, releasing a soft, snuffling breath through his nose, brows furrowing into a frown. His arm is around Draco's bare waist, tightening, Draco's fingers having paused at his movements, and the way his eyes open half-mast and meet his own.
"Yes. I was five years of age. Terrified of those muggle metal contraptions. Oh, shut up Potter!" Harry tries to quell his laughter, barely managing to tell him to go on. "It was horrid to my child brain, I will have you know. I had assumed that the people inside had been eaten by these creatures. It was only when I grew up that I'd learned they were called
"Ah. Low blow?" Potter then asked, slightly chagrined. He then tried to compensate by asking Draco what he thought
"Hardly," Harry says, swallowing hard. Staring at his mouth. "No more than you."
Harry has been teaching Scorpius Malfoy for months now. He’s never met Astoria Greengrass before, but he’s seen her pictures in the papers; all grace and black curls and a pretty, clean smile, her hand on Draco's bicep. He saw her pictures spread all over the
Neville stares at him, and nods, arms folded over his chest. He looks down at his shoes, away. "Yeah. Okay. I'll… I'll come back, yeah? To check on you."
The ongoing commentary is background noise, the rest of the game a blur, for the way Draco can't stop looking at him. He flies beautifully, as he'd always had, with the wind whipping his hair wilder, colour in his cheeks and the sun swathing him as golden as itself, the determined focus of his gaze.
Harry hums, agreeably. "Your mum's strong. I think she just needs you to keep in touch, is all. I'm sure that helps."
Malfoy had seemingly changed much from what Harry remembered him to be. While still having many of his git moments, it wasn't in any infuriating or offensive way. Most of the time, it was even endearing and funny. He was good company for the most part. He listened well and closely to much of what Harry spoke about, and responded with equal interest, even if he was very moderate and casual in his expressions. He was an excellent story-teller, with hand gestures and expressions and vocal mimicry that contributed to his skills even more.
He turns away, breathes, rubs at his eyes. "Look, I… I'll tell her I don't… feel that way for her anymore. I will. I just…"
They had to make a few more trips to St. Mungos, going through further diagnostics and tests to see if anything else showed up.
Some implied sexual content in this one!
. And then Harry Potamus. Which, admittedly, is the worst of them all, but Potter laughs all the same, the soft and sweet sound buried under the rest of the noise.
He dusts off his trousers, the back of his coat, pushing up to his feet in a haste. He adjusts his own knitted hat over his head, pushing it over the front of his hair, pulling it back again, adamantly not looking at Draco's tensed figure below him.
It takes her a while to get herself to speak, as if she's forcing her voice out. "Why did you try to do that?"
Draco can do nothing but stare at her for a long moment, perched on the edge of his seat, hands tight around the arms of the chair. There is hope brewing in his chest, even against all the odds, that he most likely can't afford such services, or the trek of searching for someone who can help him in such a way.
and a evil madman, how many died for him. Harry knew Malfoy would only tell him straight up and honestly what he deserved.
Harry closed the door behind him, turning away. He pulled his jumper up over his head as he made his way over to the wardrobe, threw it aside and changed into a plain shirt. He was painfully aware of the man behind him, in his bed, as he sat down at the edge of the bed and pushed his trousers off, left in his boxers.
Draco had been jealous of it all once, watching him with something ugly and aching in his chest underneath something else entirely, something rawer. Now that he's more detached from the competition, he can see it in all its wonder.
inked into his own wrist. They curl together, face each other, when he holds Draco's hand.
"Draco
Harry stared at him. Kept staring at him. He turned fully to him, with a step of each foot. "Did you not hear me? The curse could last
"With my cousin, sure. Not with me."
Except that the rest of him hardly seems concerned. Except that the rest of him is more interested in the way Potter feels like a home that is an intangible universe away, and the way he holds his face and tries to make him laugh through his horrible, overwhelming tears, and how that rises high above his father's shame overlapping with his own.
"Yeah," Harry said.
"Tosser."
Ron was the one that came in, brought them lunch. He stood on the side looking uncomfortable for a moment, before placing the plate down on the nightstand. It was light — just sandwiches, his own special recipe. He looked like he wanted to say something, but didn't know what. Harry was thinking if he should sit up, let go of Draco, except that didn't feel right either, and it felt like his only comfort, the only grounding he had.
They both stop. There's a tug at Harry's mouth, but he rolls it back, trying to duck his head to hide it until he catches the corner of Draco's lips twitching as well. They're looking at each other, and then there's a laugh breaking out of them at the same time, Harry still so desperately, horribly in love with the cresent moons of his cheeks and the light of his grey eyes, and they are almost,
"I did tell her," Harry says.
There's a stretch of silence. Hermione chews on her lip.
Ron had then said, grinning, pleased by the idea.
Harry draws away, quickly, letting go of his mouth, muttering a worried, "Draco?"But Draco is shaking his head, seeming unable to speak. He'd pressed his forehead against Harry's just as the kiss broke, and his eyes are closed as his hands, trembling, run up over his biceps, his shoulders, back down. There's a very slight smudge of water under his eyes still, clinging to his lashes when he looks up at Harry after a very long moment, a hint of a quivering, slight smile at the corner of his mouth.
things that have happened today?"
"Impatient, are we, Potter?" Malfoy snorted. "Well, I'm bloody famished, so I'd much rather we talk over some food."
Malfoy's pale eyebrows arched, appearing surprised.
2) The curse-alterer and medimagical staff were legally mandated, to the best of their ability, to take any and all measures in order to ensure both lives were secured. It shall be prioritised above all.
Only, when Harry was around Malfoy, it was difficult. He was angry as it was, without clear reason beyond how his life had turned out after everything that had already happened to him, his brain stretched taut, like bubbling acid in his throat. Harry tried his best to keep it down, for the most part, but for a snapped word here, a short, clipped response there, no different from Malfoy's own constantly slipping temperament.
When the haze of illness faded, so did the surrealism of it all, and Harry was left only with a deep, aching fatigue in his muscles, a terrible, bright clarity of what had happened. The way his life had changed all in the matter of two days.
She calls for Mimi and requests for lunch. Draco surveys the interior of the vast manor as he follows after his mother, familiar and strange all at the same time, full of his father's absence and drenched in something black, suffocating, as if perhaps they'd all left their sickening energy behind in every corner of the walls. He keeps one hand in the pocket of his trousers, hidden and detached. His other hand runs over the rough wood of the stairway railing, traces over the old paint of the walls, the tips of his fingers tentative and distracted over it all.
He pulls Harry's hat onto his face, deliberately, and when the hat lifts back up onto Harry's messy hair, it clears his way to vision of the quirk of Draco's grin, crooked canines hooked over his lower lip. Harry doesn't know what he looks like, but it must be as ruffled and exasperated and fond, achingly fond, as he feels. He's certain much of the rest has slipped away, left behind only the warmth in his chest by the way Draco's smiling, all crescent-moon dimples on cheeks and one raised than the other, as he pushes Harry's hair up into his hat with his fingers. He pulls Harry in by the scarf, kisses him. He likes to do that, Harry's noticed too. He likes to take Harry's hands and warm them inside the pockets of his own coat, when Harry is cold and they're alone. Harry likes that too.
Malfoy's eyes grew tinged with remorse with the briefest moment, before quickly becoming controlled and impassive.
Malfoy had grabbed his wrist again, tightly—Merlin's
"I do feel strange," Malfoy said, threw him a quick glance, a brow raised. He was leading him up the stairs, to the left of the first floor, towards the bedroom. "But not quite like you yet, I suppose."
" Potter's voice is thick and breathy in the high wind of the tower, like he has a cold. He laughs, shaky, and more than anything, he just sounds terrified, and this is everything Draco has been terrified of himself, unfolding right before his eyes. "There's this way that you look at me, like you... and I didn't understand it before, but I understand it now...
. Said,
Afterwards, Harry recorded the room again, roving slowly upon every person there, and zoomed onto Draco, speaking to Molly, as he helped her clean up the table alongside Ron, caught Molly's full-bodied laughter, tapping Draco's cheek as he was turning to carry the dishes towards the kitchen.
"Could this… could this be a threat to his life?" Harry asked, staring wide and fixated down at the desk. "If it went wrong?"
It was supposed to be okay because
They continue a silent walk down the street. The plan was to stop at the sweets shop, first, and then the pub.
"It's nice to sleep next to somebody, isn't it?" she says. "Comforting."
"Do you feel it?" he asked. Draco hummed, a warm hand splayed over Harry's ribcage.
He would ask every night, or he would ask about his outing when he visited Ron and Hermione or the Weasleys for short hours, or he would come into the drawing room for a drink while Harry was painting and ask him what he was working on.
Hermione flooed in next Friday night.
The initials of Harry's name, etched into his skin. He smiles softly, turning his head up to glance up at Draco. He brings it to his lips, feels Draco's thumb trace his brow.
It was then that he turned slightly, throwing a glance over his shoulder, and with it, it cleared the way of vision, and Harry could see a bit of himself, asleep on the bed underneath blankets.
in this damned revolting Manor with little to do outside of gardening! I have too much time on my hands and so all I do is think and worry about
oh, Harry, no, it's
* * *
Draco gave him that slight slanted smile, shaking his head as he laughed and he scooted forward, folding his arms around Harry's neck. He kissed the corner of Harry's mouth, pushing his temple against his. "Okay."
"Um. Thank you, really," he said, awkwardly, holding it up for her. "But I don't know if I can… it's too expensive, Luna. I'm really the last person you should be spending that much money on."
And eventually taken up by the tumultuous waves of his own foolish feelings, Draco finds himself growing completely lost to the deep, blinding pull within himself, something that shuts his eyes and mind to imprudence and rationality after a particular point.
But Harry shook his head, grabbing Draco's wrist, delicate and thinner and paler with illness, putting his nose to the inside of it, and suddenly he was crying before he could stop himself, his face crumpling hot and tight.
"They did that to you?" he asks. Something in his voice is making it uneven, a rough rasp.
"I found myself on the edge of their balcony, Harry." He's quiet, his voice nearly taken away by the wind. "And my friends... they saved me."
Once it's arranged that Draco will come pick Scorpius tomorrow at nine in the morning, he kisses the top of Scorpius' forehead, waves at him and Annie and her parents, and watches them drive away. By now, the parking lot is almost emptied of cars and people.
Harry slung an arm over the back of the bench, rubbed a hand over his curls, watching the two of them, smiling faintly.
"Okay," Pansy says, nodding, still shaky. "Okay." Her hand stays around his.
"I'll stay for a while. I need to think."

having said whatever you did to Smith has made some of them rather cross with you for… '
he didn't even..."
Draco woke up a bit later, with a stir of his narrow hips and legs that caught Harry's attention. His eyes were open, so very grey, softened by the frown of slumber right after waking. He woke fully, and was then locked in gaze with Harry for a few seconds.
"I… I mean..."
"You did it to save us," Ron said, in a low voice. "You can't blame yourself for wanting to be free."
"Did they, um… did they know you liked men?"
"Oh. It's very recent," Luna waves off, and does not take his bait for diverting the topic. Draco isn't sure if this is deliberate or not. "So who was it?"
and Draco, the screen all fumbling black and tussling noise as he stole the camera from Harry, turned it onto Harry's own face to say,
The worst came, one night.
"No, it shouldn't be too long," Draco said. He was buttoning up his sleeve in front of the mirror. "I'll be back within the hour."
Harry was looking at Draco. Draco was looking at him across the room, looking away and down at his drink, seeming a bit distracted. He kept looking at the person talking, but didn't entirely seem to be there, and worry curdled at Harry. "Yeah. See, things can change."
Harry doesn't see Draco the rest of the day, stuck at the celebrations for Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup, but he's all he thinks about through it, and it's only in the dead of night, through a coin call, that they meet again on their Astronomy Tower. Draco's standing by the parapet, leaning into his elbows atop it. He must have heard his footsteps, because he's straightening, turning around, and Harry is moving towards him, a quick, desperate pace.
"You Gryffindors," Malfoy said with a scoff. "Always with the violence. Don't you know the art of subtlety can be utilized brilliantly when it comes to vengeance?"
"I just wanted a good day," Malfoy said softly. "Just a good last day, you know? Sounded boring and lonely as fuck, the thought of spending it all alone."
There was that time Malfoy had hovered stiffly beside him some feet away, stood in front of a bookshelf. He'd been standing on the toes of his shoes, head tilted upward, eyes pointedly roving over the spines of the books as his fingers slid over them, the touch unbreaking. His lips had been moving, shaping around the title names as he read. Harry had moved aside to allow him to keep looking, leaning back slightly on the shelf behind him.
Scorpius raises his head back to look up at his father. "That's what you sound like when you—"
One night, Potter draws him into a dance on the Quidditch pitch.
It ends with Draco kneeling over him, knees on either side of his waist to keep him down. It ends with Harry letting him pin his wrists above him—long fingers circled around them, pressing them into snow—because he is laughing, platinum hair peeking out of his hat in soft messy waves and falling into his crinkling grey eyes, pinked cheeks raised and folded in a dimpled grin.
And he is so infuriatingly beautiful that it makes Draco want to scream. And he understands it now, all these years later, why this man has always been a wonder to those around him.
"He was my godfather," Harry said. "Sirius Black."
Harry frowns. "Has anyone bothered you? Since Smith?"
"I imagine that's better than the alternative," Draco says, carefully, throwing him a quick glance, a raised eyebrow.
They learned to identify the beginnings, the smallest of signs. They learned that, if they managed to take care of it right from the start, before reaching the breaking point, it was better that way.
It's a certain thing that Potter says, something painfully familiar and echoing of his dreams. It's a certain thing he does, or a certain way that he looks at Draco and smiles at him. Even if they don't hold the same meaning, it's all the ways that he's never done before.
for it, and others afraid to even look at him wrong, from what Dean's told me. And I mean… yeah, you know. You did sort of go barmy on Smith."
"Anything I don't know."
"Oh, Draco! It's so pretty," Luna says, her delighted smile beaming up at Draco.
"But I know you don't like that house. It made your nightmares worse."
"You've got your concert. What else do you need me here for?"
"There's no need," Harry says in a breath of a laugh, trying not to think too much about the gesture. To react like he may be thinking much about it at all underneath his words, the tone of his voice. "I'm not… you don't have to…"
"Salazar!" Draco said, feigning outrage. "And then what did you do? Did you tell him off for it?"
he had been very strangely taken in by it, seeming to contemplate the concept of movies and shows for a while after. Harry hadn't known that was what was happening, when he went quiet. Five minutes later, he was piping up with a question,
"It's alright. It's not your fault," Malfoy murmured, a mirthful inflection in a near-whisper. Harry didn't have to look at him to know he was smirking, all that arrogance that Harry knew so well. "I know what I look like."
Harry halts to a stop, turning to him. "Did you see him, Ron? When Smith was shoving at him? And then, last night—"
"Then let's start now. If you want that."
When she told him what was happening, Harry felt very much like he was hearing her from the end of a very long tunnel. It was something about his
"It won't be like that," Draco says. "Things are different now."
He watches Potter leave for his classes from behind the statue of the knight, with his heart still in his throat, slow and erratic.
Malfoy slapped down the menu, crossed his arms over his chest as he leaned back, and said with a wry smile, "Alright, if you want to know
"Nothing," Harry said, quietly, turning it around his finger. It was small, a simple band of metal around the knuckle of his finger. A noose on his neck, keeping his life at a halt. "It's just an accessory."
"A legal investigation," Xavier said, the tone of his voice sounding like
so what now?"
When Harry showed up to the gala that evening, it was to a whole host of flashbulbs from metres away, the reporters held back by a transparent barrier. He could only see dark spots and nothing else, blinking hard as he turned and made his way towards the entrance, the loud, distorted chorus of people yelling and speaking over each other from behind him.
"What happened?" Draco asked him, once he'd drank it down. He took the glass from him, put it on the table behind him, taking Harry's hand when he turned back.
"I've spoken to the Headmistress
"She also said there were many recent pictures of his sleeping face."
They're learning Transfiguration now, which is much harder in wandless magic. Wands are what focuses magic in order to cast a spell. When one is only using their hands, and even moreso, their mind, it should take a greater deal of concentration and energy to focus that magic by themselves. Transfiguration takes extra effort in this case.

Hermione looked at him. "How long has it been since you read the papers, Harry?"
There's a long silence, but somehow it doesn't feel so much like a closing of the conversation, but an opening of one, leaving him space to fill it. She looks at him again, but doesn't say anything further.
It was nearly five songs later that Harry lost himself in it, unaware of his own swaying and the subtle, rhythmic head movements and tapping fingers on the biceps of his crossed arms to the music until he caught Malfoy's eye, watching him with an unfathomable look in his sharp moonstone eyes, that didn't look as sharp at the moment, for whatever reason. He stilled, suddenly feeling flustered and awkward. One pale eyebrow cocked up as it roved over him, his lips curling up into that bloody smirk again.
unhappy. And I wasn't to tell anybody about it, and I was not to let it hinder my sense of responsibility as a Draco heir."
Harry can tell Draco has tried his best to put it in simple words for the children, but he still uses words that he forgets to explain, and kids have to ask the meaning of them. He drags the explanations too long, trying very hard to make the children who asked understand what he meant to say, but Harry can also see when they lose focus, their eyes going distant.
Harry thought of Malfoy's face again, ashen in the firelight. "Yeah. Yeah, maybe."
didn't make fun of mine either. Shut up and let me finish," Draco said, pushing a soapy, foamy hand at his shoulder, then back again in his hair. "I hated it because it was unfair, how good you looked with that mess of a bird's nest atop your head. The fact that you wouldn't even bother combing it! And then there were
"Breathe, Potter," Malfoy repeated, still calm and collected. "Don't let him get under your skin."
Harry lifts his eyes to him. "No, of course not. Why would you even — I'm in love with you." He can see the look on Draco's face. It's impassive, indecipherable, but it has a clear meaning
"He was also hosting charity galas, apparently," Hermione said, going back to reading through the papers again.
He got himself another broom, flew alongside them.
"Since...you know." Since the whole thing with Malfoy started, and the papers were just filled with a lot of bollocks, a lot of bollock opinions, a lot of bollock advice and bollock conspiracy theories
"Why don't you find Ginny, then? Take her out somewhere?" Ron asks, tying his tie. He frowns at the orange tie polka-dotted with purple, turning to Harry. "Looks kind of stupid with these robes, doesn't it?"
"Fuck, Potter, would you just stop trying to run away!" Harry felt cold fingers around his arm,
Malfoy didn't say anything to that, thankfully. He threw him the green and red cap. Harry caught it on reflex, and then glanced down at it, not sure what he was supposed to do with it.
"Hello. Your name and tickets, please?"
Some days are like these, where his restlessness and hunger feels like it will never be satisfied — where all he wants is to go back.
" His eyes twitched down, over the rumpled state of him, and then with a flick, back up to Harry's face. "cavortings."
Draco went silent. He spoke after a moment, when Harry had turned back to the canvas, brushing it up, leaning closer. "I see. He seemed… familiar." His voice was slow, cautious, and Harry suddenly wished he hadn't told him Sirius' name.
It would be the day after that Harry would know why he'd looked like that. Lucius Malfoy had been given the Dementor's Kiss. Malfoy hadn't been there in the Great Hall, or in their classes together for the rest of the day. He hadn't been anywhere for weeks after, showed up only for his NEWTS two weeks with grief sinking his eyes in. He hadn't bothered showing up for the graduation ceremony either.
It was confusing, overwhelming, exhausting. All of it. Trying to meet the curse's demands, each other's needs due to it. Trying to live a life, see the people he loved, especially on the days that one or both of them just didn't want to bother trying with sex, even to afford themselves time.
When the waitress left, Malfoy's silver gaze turned to him, remaining for a moment, before he said, "Look, if you're worried about your heterosexuality sensibilities getting offended… let me just tell you, I don't give a damn."
"What?"
It was sure to be good news with her, unless Merlin forbid she had gotten an E on one of her subjects, then it depended on what her idea of
"Guys, it's alright," Harry pacified. He shook his head at his friends' overprotectiveness. They could be quite unreasonable at times, no matter how endearing. "You two go on."
"You're terribly saccharine," Draco said, though he didn't seem to mind it all that much. "Can we get up now?"
Draco made a sort of noise, a scoff that jounced in his chest. "See, I don't believe we're much capable of working any other way, Potter," he said, poured the vial into a beaker, sounding half-distracted and insouciant. Something lilac bubbled up to the top. "We were two of the worst people this curse could have happened to."
"Oh yeah, he really looks like a Mr. Beetle," Harry says. Scorpius nods vigorously in agreement.
Some of Draco's hair had gotten loose from his half-up, wavy tendrils falling at his temples, and his eyes looked more silver than they ever had, in this haze of inebriation, the warm lights of the burrow. He had taken his burgundy suit off, folded it over the arm of the sofa, left only in his trousers and black shirt.
She followed him to the couch.
"You mean something to me."
"I'm sorry," Harry blurted, suddenly. The room went silent. A second. Two. "I know it doesn't matter, because it—" But it took the wind out of his lungs and instead he just went silent, throat burning. Still, a few seconds after, with no response from Draco, he breathed and said, "I'm sorry, for pushing the alteration on you."
"You're going to be so loved." Harry brushes his lips against the baby's forehead. He's fallen asleep against his chest. They were the same, Harry and Teddy, but they won't grow up the same. "I know you'll grow up one day, and you'll miss them very much, but you'll never be anything short of loved, Teddy."
"Don't know what…?" Ron straightened, his eyes narrowing. "Did Malfoy do something?"
But they had stayed here long enough anyway. Harry looked at Draco, cocked an eyebrow, as if to say,
“I didn’t think it would lead to that,” Hermione says. “To him leaving. You know.”
