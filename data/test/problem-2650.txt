“Why are you still up here? James has the field trip today and he has to be up early,” Ginny huffed as she moved across the room towards the door to the hallway.
But Harry was still looking at the picture of the quidditch pitch. As Ida reached for it, Harry bent down and grabbed it.
“Wait…” she grabbed the paper from Harry, “Where was he sitting?”
“Not right now, you don’t,” came a frantic voice from behind Harry. He turned around and was immediately confronted by a thick scent of strawberries and a face full of bright red hair.
“Yeah, mate,” Ron said cheerfully.
The six of them pulled out their wands and apparated to the side of Seamus and Dean’s building. Harry quickly gulped in bouts of air as he steadied himself: no matter how many times he apparated, Harry always felt put off by the tightness in his chest and the weariness his body experienced once he reappeared. Despite the fact apparition would never be his favorite, Harry had no doubts in his mind that it was the most practical way to get from one place to the next and stuck with it for daily commutes.
“What does that mean?” Harry snapped heatedly.
The five of them stood in silence at Ida’s words. Harry wondered how long the Healers in the canteen were forced to fight before someone notified the Aurors. He wondered if Kareach did anything to the rest of the building that prevented them from contacting the Ministry, like altering the apparation wards or the floo network. Whatever it was, twenty casualties was a lot. And that was in a hospital. Who knew what Kareach was capable of if an attack in a hospital led to the death of twenty people.
“Precisely,” Draco declared, standing up to pace the room, “This is monumental information. We can’t risk letting Kareach know we are onto them. And there is no bloody way not a single person in the ministry isn’t involved in this.”
“Well,” Ginny said softly, “I’m going to go make sure the kids made it to their own beds.”
With that, she whipped around and cast a spell straight at Draco’s face. The gash that already occupied most of his face grew to reach around to his other cheek.
“But...” Harry interrupted frantically only to have Padma cut him off.
“So you think it’s Kareach?” Harry asked, locking eyes with Aviary.
“I love you all, too,” Ginny said from the doorway, “But I need to get to the pitch!” she turned to look at Harry, “You have a study thing today, right?”
Then, in typical Seamus fashion, he shook himself and began to cast silence charms around them. He began to speak, much angrier than Harry had anticipated,
“I know. I’m relieved we’ve found one source of the attacks, but clearly this case is far from over. I think you were right, Harry. This was done by a group of people, and I don’t just mean Brayan and a bunch of mindless followers. I mean a real group… not necessarily Kareach, but… possibly? Who knows at this point,” Ron sighed, “Harry, I really thought this was over. I’m starting to think it will never end. I’m already constantly worried about my wife’s health. What’s next for her? Will they just try to kill her?”
“Brayan had a dark past, Harry. Once we gave him truth serum, it all came out,” Ida said.
She stopped, thankfully, before the blood could consume Draco’s whole face. Ida turned now to her cousin, a question forming on her dark red lips:
“Oh, Draco! A Black! I thought this day would never come. I know your parents would never have raised you to join that awful Potter and his friends! You are certainly here to take back the house, aren’t you, my dear?” she gushed.
He opened the door and breathed in the stinging winter air. His face was flushed and his pulse was racing; he felt out of control. He couldn’t believe Ron and Padma. He thought he could trust them to work with him and Draco. This was going to destroy everything Draco had been working on and it was all his fault.
“Really?” Ginny asked, appearing in the doorway, “Why would he ask for a trainee to come back so late at night?”
“It never is,” Hermione said, “But when has that ever stopped you?”
“No worries, Molly, I’m not here to dwell on what happened. I understand Christmas Eve isn’t the time or place for  worries,” he paused and beamed as Lily removed herself from Arthur’s lap and went to wrap herself around Seamus’s legs, murmuring “Uncle Seamus”.
“You could change the mind of the most stubborn group of people in the Ministry?” Malfoy finished for him.
Then suddenly, she began to cry in a way Harry hadn’t seen in years. She was shaking uncontrollably as Harry reached for and gave her a hug, He assumed she was just as worried about telling their children as he was. He couldn’t believe she was telling him all the things he had been thinking for the past couple months. Somehow, the person who understood his need to get out of his marriage most was his wife.
“Harry?” Dean asked softly, lowering himself down besides Harry, “Luna says you want to talk to us?”
“Once again, Lily is smarter than all of us,” James said admiringly.
With that, he apparated out of the house, straight to the Leaky Cauldron.
Ida groaned, “He’s the absolute worst. If Puddlemere wins this tournament I will have to move out of England.”
Blaise’s expression faltered at this, while Draco looked away. Harry wondered what he had said.
“Just last week,” Ida said from her perch on one of the armchairs, “He became furious at me for not coming to help out at one of his practices! Apparently, Puddlemere needs someone to help with setting up for practices and keeping the players hydrated. He told me he thought I would be honored to fetch water for his team, the wanker!”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw a flash of black. Someone was moving behind him. A moment later, the black silhouette began moving forward. From the back, he recognized the completely black clothed figure as a Kareach member. They were still wearing their mask, so as they turned around to face Harry, he couldn’t identify who it was. To his surprise, the figure gave a hearty laugh and bent down to pick up something else from the floor. Harry’s heart sunk when he realized what the figure was picking up.
“How could you?” Ron asked, “When she was pregnant with Rose she told me I’d probably look better if I wasn’t a ginger.”
“I told you the smoke was pointless, now didn’t I?” Ida’s voice was so casual, as if she knew she knew she had the upper hand. Harry’s blood boiled at the mere sight of her.
Harry laughed; he was beginning to like Blaise’s boldness, despite himself, “Yes, that would be the reason. He immediately insulted my wife, so that wasn’t a joyride.”
“Wait!” Harry insisted, but Malfoy was rushing across the bar, pushing his way through drunken couples to find his friend and escape Harry.
“That’s terrible!” Harry exclaimed.
“Well, he was an ex-Death Eater,” Ginny said softly, “That doesn’t exactly scream healthy choice.”
Aviary eyes grew wide as Harry sat up quickly and made his way to the door.
“What?” Harry stared at his friend, “No you don’t.”
“And you love it,” Harry joked.
“The face you made. It’s the same face you make whenever you realize anything,” Draco explained. If Harry wasn’t mistaken, he thought he saw a blush creeping onto Draco’s cheeks. At that moment Harry fully registered this was the first time they’d been truly alone since the kiss. Knowing it wasn’t the time or place, he said to Draco, “When you read off the things you learned in Cambodia about Chann, you said something about victims that were already pregnant, didn’t you?”
With that, he ignored Walburga’s angry screams as he pulled the curtains shut and turned to Aviary and Harry, who were still standing at the doorway.
“I should have tested it no matter what,” Draco said angrily, “Immediately! Everything I did, rushing off to you and then the pub, was all a rookie mistake!”
“Blaise is great!” Al announced, “He’s got a cool job and he’s best friends with Draco.”
“I know it’s hard,” Harry looked up into Draco’s eyes, intense and dark with an anger Harry hadn’t seen in him in a long time, “But we need to focus on stopping this.”
Dean nodded and made his way with Seamus back into the house. Harry watched them go silently, then turned to Draco, who had his head in his hands.
“I’m so sorry, Darius,” Harry said softly.
“Never mind,” Harry muttered. He turned back to the fireplace, deciding not to push the topic any further.
And with that, Harry said goodbye and Brayan disappeared out of his fireplace.
Not knowing how to argue with that, Harry said, “I’ll be down in a minute. Is Lily fine?”
“Yes,” Ida stared at him, “How do you know about that?”
“Then why hide it?” Ron questioned, still angry.
“Gorgeous,” Seb chimed in from Aviary’s other side. He had a hand on her shoulder.
“What?” Harry said. He knew Draco well enough to know the gasp wasn’t for something bad, but for something surprising, He followed his fiance’s wide gaze to the dance floor.
Seamus and Dean smiled back in gratitude as George plopped down into the seat next to Harry.
Harry bristled slightly at this. He happened to believe he had a fucking great reason. But with that said, he really did feel sorry.
“She does?” Harry said, surprised, “I had no idea. Is she a healer?”
“Al, don’t retaliate,” Ginny said firmly, as Harry said, “It’s a meeting where I go and talk to a nice person who helps me talk through any problems I have.”
After a while of lying like this, Ginny pulled away. Al and James moved to sit on either side of Harry. Lily stayed curled up at his side, a constant reminder that nothing had changed. These kids were still the most important thing in the world to him.
Harry trailed off as he pictured the kind and hardworking kid that Harry had seen only hours earlier. He was so young. So full of life. Certainly he wasn’t dead.
“I think Remmins is a brilliant Auror,” Ida insisted.
James looked at him in alarm, “Why? Were you really so upset with mom for cheating?”
Ida looked like she was fighting down a few choice words that would get her fired just as quickly as telling Harry about cases. “But sir” she gritted out, “Surely there is someone else I could work with? I actually talked to Remmins about being my partner and he seemed interested.”
“Because you were laughing so hard?” Blaise asked.
“No,” she seethed, “I don’t want to hear anything you have to say right now.”
“Before you ask me if I heard any of that, the answer is no,” Harry admitted, “But it’s due to my inability to be a good conversationalist, not my dislike of your stories. I find you quite interesting.”
Scorpius laughed, “I can’t promise that, but I’ll surely try!”
When they pulled apart, Harry moved aside so that Draco could lie down beside him. They lied there for a moment, catching their breath.
Remmins shook his head. He was clearly trying to fight back tears as he nearly whispered, “I’m not sure my partner is going to make it. His name is Hector Youll. You would have liked him, Harry. He was a great guy.”
“Yes,” he agreed, “No work talk.”
“Accio glasses,” Ginny called. He heard a whoosh as his glasses flew into Ginny’s awaiting hand. She then thrust the glasses into his hand. Harry put them on wearily.
“I couldn’t agree more,” Aries beamed. Harry had never noticed how menacing his smile looked, “Where to begin?”
“You,” she said in her shrill voice, “Look exactly like the respectable man my dear niece Narcissa married. You must be little Draco!”
“Not as good as he was as an Auror,” Servant countered confidently, “His natural instinct to be calm and productive in a moment of threat is all Auror.”
“Forcing quidditch opinions on them at a young age, eh?” Harry noted.
“Harry, what’re you…” he broke off as he spotted Malfoy, “Oh. What is he doing here? Did you have another interview with him?”
To his surprise, Seamus dove for the wand and grabbed it off of the ground. Harry had no time to wonder what he was doing there, because Ron, Padma, Neville and Ginny appeared moments later. Ron and Neville both cast a stupefy on Aries, knocking him out cold within seconds. Ginny aimed her wand at Ida, casting a Petrificus Totalus.
Ida came back in moments later with two full glasses of mead. She handed one to Harry and then took a large swing of her own.
“Yes I am,” Harry said defiantly, “Is there a problem with that?”
With that, she turned on her foot and walked back towards the lift, red hair sailing behind her like a flag.
Ginny started, “Bloody hell, Harry, you’re awake? I thought you were asleep.”
“Yes,” Molly answered.
Ginny looked surprised at her daughter’s deadpan answer.
“Oh, yes, plenty, Mr. Brayan,” Malfoy said, trying his best to look pleased to continue with the interview, although Harry could spot the clear annoyance blooming behind his facade of a smile, “I’m sure I can fit whatever you have to say about Mr. Potter into my story.”
Harry's eyes flickered to the Head table where Dumbledore was speaking to Lothair. About what, Harry could only guess. He was curious to know what the old man was up to behind the closed doors of the order. His thoughts briefly drifted to the information that Saeya had uncovered already.
Rosalind sighed. Here she was thinking he'd gotten over his stubbornness. Taking a moment she thought about it for a long moment. "The werewolves have very strong personalities," she started, eyeing the deep bruise she was currently dealing with, "who have tempers that are just as strong. When it comes to your bond, depending on how much these characteristics manifest, we might see a change of dominance."
Harry really didn't think it was going to be as easy as all that, particularly since his ribs still hurt from the landing he'd just suffered through. Finding himself standing in front of the statue once again, he sighed and hesitantly reached out to place his hands on the cool stone once more. This time, he let his own magic wrap around him for longer before gradually releasing small amounts toward the larger entity that was Hogwarts. He could feel the electricity in the air, but nothing connected with him. Keeping a firm image of what he wanted in his mind, he gradually and very carefully reached out.
Silence again. Draco couldn't blame them. He was having a hard time processing what Potter was saying. He'd heard of a Horcrux. His family had a penchant for dark magic, after all, but he'd never found anything on how to actually create them. To create one was insane. How many had that bastard created?
Harry flushed. He'd have liked to argue, but what she'd said wasn't entirely wrong. He was pretty bad when it came to using a bow. He just couldn't wrap his mind around the distance and adjusting for the wind. He still heard Gwynn's cackling whenever he even glanced at a bow, nor could he forget the stinging snap of the bow's release when he hadn't been holding it properly. If he never had to hold another bow in his life, he'd be happy.
furious, even several hours later. It seemed that every time he interacted with Potter it left him in that very state. It also didn't help that a snide little voice – that suspiciously sounded an awful lot like Pansy - had crept into the back of his head had asked him why he'd stopped referring to the other male as "
Draco glared, steeling himself for the interrogation that was surely to come. Potter would notify all his Order friends and the Witch Hunt would begin. He shook his head, pulling together his usual sneer and prepared to tell Potter and his bloody Order of the Phoenix right where to go. The words never left his mouth, as his undivided attention was distracted by long strands of almost white blond hair falling over his shoulder. "What the-" his fingers wrapped around the long strands and he tugged, finding said strands attached to his own head. Fumbling with the locks, he kept pulling until he found the ends of the strands. What the bloody hell was going on? The thought was almost frantic as his eyes moved from the ends of his hair to the pair of legs stretched out in front of him. Those were not his, of that he was positive. He didn't have that sort of definition. He wasn't a bloody runner and Quidditch didn't give you this sort of definition. There was only one thing that had not changed.
"Yes, my Lord. I have several reliable contacts within the Jade Manor who are working on it as we speak."
Potter and Gwynn chose that moment to arrive and he spared a moment to shoot them a glare before Lothair was speaking. "We do not interact with the human world. This is an unprecedented situation," with that said, he shot Harry a dirty look, who was smart enough to at least look a little embarrassed by it. "We will be keeping our presence to a minimum. Those assigned to guard will be unseen by the Wizards at all times." There was a chorus of nods from the group before Lothair's attention shifted to him and Harry. "You two will be creating a glamour spell before we leave this realm."
"Also," Lothair continued, "Keep in mind that these bracelets only conceal your magical abilities. Your physical abilities are still quite present."
"Two days." Soren replied. Two days was enough time to get everything organized and put the precautions in place. "Tell them we will meet them in two days time at dusk."
Harry watched unnoticed from the doorway as the one named Gwynn flushed with annoyance, her knuckles turning white with the tight grip she had on her bow while the quiver on her make shifted as she tensed. "You know full well that I can make that shot, Terrak. I've done it a million times before!"
That was something, at the very least, Draco thought. Even still, he felt numb at all the information he'd taken in. His life had been completely turned on it's head and now, it had been spun around. He didn't know which way was up anymore. Elves, werewolves, wizards, death eaters. Where the bloody hell did he fit in among them now?
Draco had already broken away from the group to go and investigate the various doors. Opening the first door, he glanced inside and let out a low whistle. It was a large room full of every sort of weapon he'd ever heard of and probably some he hadn't. Turning away, he glanced back to Harry and raised an eyebrow. "What in the hell were you imagining that included an armoury?"
Soren sighed, his eyes closing as he allowed his mind to run through the information and possibilities. There was truth to Lothair's words that he simply couldn't deny. Harry was nowhere near capable of handling a war and that was definitely Roland's goal. He wanted to see the Realm torn apart and that was the most sufficient way to go about it. "Ilaria," he finally replied, drawing her attention. Above all, he trusted her opinion on these matters. She wasn't the High Lady of the Southern Lands for nothing. Each one of them had their talents. He had his flair for internal and external political affairs. Lothair, while having a volatile temper, was a master of healing and magic. Ilaria's talents lay in war. Each of them sat at the top of their field and each had an opinion to be considered. "What do you suggest?"
Draco’s smile lit up his whole face, which Harry quickly turned away from. Draco didn’t seem to notice; he quickly went into a dream he had last night that made him think about another possible member of Kareach. Harry listened intently, talking Draco through all of his new ideas and theories. Although Harry had made quite an issue of it, he didn’t really mind missing an afternoon at the Burrow for this.
“What’s your plan?” Harry asked as he and Aviary walked to sit besides Draco.
“That’s great news!” Hermione said. She was sitting in the chair next to his bed. Ron was sitting on the floor in front of her with his back propped against her legs. The two of them had been in the room for the past ten minutes. They had been in plenty of times the day before to see Harry, but they had promised to come back the following day to spend some time as just the three of them. Maybe this time it hadn’t been the three of them saving the day together, but without saying they knew they needed this. It always came back to the three of them.
Harry didn’t want to ask, but he couldn’t stop himself, “What about the Room of Requirement?” he said this so quietly that he hoped maybe Draco didn’t hear.
“Harry,” Ron whispered, “You could have died.”
“She has a point there,” Harry agreed, thinking of Theodore Nott, who was also working as an Auror for the Ministry. He was nothing like the vindictive and judgemental boy Harry had known at Hogwarts; he was a hardworking and kind man Harry had admired as a fellow Auror.
On the dance floor were Pansy and Padma, dancing in a way that was much more than friendly.
“The stupefy wore off at Aries. Don’t ask me how…” Ginny began to answer.
Harry shrugged and gave a small smile. “Sometimes what’s easy isn’t what’s best for us.”
“Draco, they’re trying to kill you!” he whispered fiercely as sounds of yelling and fighting commenced around them, “Did you see how many killing curses were shot at us immediately? It’s a miracle we are alive! I can’t let you leave this shield!”
“Are you implying we have no control over our children?” Harry joked, “Because while you may be right, let’s just remember that your daughter just took off running as soon as you arrived.”
“Shambles?” Harry inquired, “I read your article, and you're a bloody good reporter. Why would your career be in shambles?”
Hermione sighed again, but gave Harry a soft smile, “You’re right Harry, of course you are. I just don’t want any Ministries to think we aren’t doing everything to prevent more attacks.”
“You love me?” Harry asked.
“On that note,” Harry jumped in, as Angelina began to laugh, “Where is Albus?”
“The issue isn’t Diagon Alley this time,” Ida looked around again, then continued, “This attack didn’t happen in Diagon Alley. It happened at a muggle shop in Yorkshire.”
“I’m not the only one you need to apologize to,” Ginny pointed out, “You yelled at three of your friends last night for no reason.”
“Well said, Molly,” Fleur said, “Did I tell you all about how Louie received full marks on his last spelling exam?”
“No, I have something to say,” he asserted, “I’m not going to lie to you. Being an ex-Death Eater is something that taints who you are. There’s no way around that. But Draco, just because the past exists doesn’t mean it has to define who you are going to be. I have never, in my entire life, met someone who cares so much about atoning for the wrongs they committed. You work every single day to bring justice to our community. I can easily say no one impresses me more. Draco, I was the person who hated you most while we were growing up. I saw you as nothing more than a devious child who would soon aid to the Dark Arts. But, as a think back, that’s not all I saw. I was also intrigued by you. A part of me always knew you were more than you let on. You were so quick to defend yourself, so quick to hide anything real about yourself, that it made me wonder who you really were. And now I know. The real you, the one you defined all by yourself, is the most extraordinary person I have ever met. Yes, you’re defensive. And confusing. And bloody complicated. But you inspire me everyday with your compassion and your relentless drive to fight for what’s right. Draco,” Harry finished, almost out of breath, “You are so much more than your past. The people that matter will see that.”
Harry was taken aback by how waspish Malfoy was being towards him. He had expected the interview to go a lot more smoothly after the way he had seen Malfoy talk to his son and wife. Of course, Harry reasoned, Malfoy would naturally be nice to the people he loves and cares about. Harry was nothing but a bitter reminder of schoolboy rivalries and cruel interactions.
“I saw his arm move, mum! He’s alive!”
“I know,” he said solemnly, “It’s what I do for friends.”
Harry jumped. It had been a while since he had dealt with a classic Reyes sneak up.
“No, of course not,” Draco huffed, “He’s still with Astoria. We all were at her parents’ house for Christmas Eve.”
Harry dropped his nephew’s hand and moved past his friends and family into the yard. He barely made it to a bush before he hurled directly into it. His head spinning, he sat down on the porch steps and began to sob into his hands. He was with Dean when the attack happened. He could have stopped all of this. What if Seamus and Dean had already had sex? Then they couldn’t use either of their sperm. He knew adoption was an option, but he absolutely hated having to take their desire to use surrogacy away from them. With his usual irrational behavior, he reached for the phone in his pocket and began to dial Draco’s number from memory. He needed to talk to someone that would understand his pain completely. Sure, Ron and Padma were inside, but he didn’t want to talk to them about how to handle this. Draco was the one who knew what to do and what to say.
"And? It's cheating! If you don't tell them, I will!" Harry threatened, but Draco just smirked at him.
The hint of fear in her normally collected voice was more then enough to snap him out of his frozen state. "What's going on? What are you doing?" Draco asked, pushing himself out of the bed. He had a sinking feeling that he already knew, but he needed to hear it from her. He didn't understand. This wasn't the role she was supposed to play.
"Damn it!" he cursed, his hands coming up to catch himself, effectively scrapping his palms on the rough stone beneath him.
"Sorry, sir," Harry offered, fixing a slightly sheepish smile to his face. "Everything happened so quickly."
"Who is making these demands?" Soren asked, calmly.
He huffed and slumped his arm back over his eyes. "He's an idiot."
"I'll partner with him!"
"He was hit with some sort of magic."
"He's not exactly mortal. Or at least, not in the sense that you mean."
"Oh, yeah, sorry!" Before they could add the last ingredient the potion had to remain under a stasis spell for fifteen minutes. Why? He had no bloody idea but he'd learned not to ask questions.
"No."
"But Soren-"
"We need to talk!" Harry insisted.
It could not be said that Harry no longer feared what the future had in store for him. Too many varying obstacles still lay in his path for that to be true. The terrifying presence of Roland and the continued pressures from Voldemort were enough to have him worried. He couldn't escape the fear of what the unforeseen future held for him, however, the future wasn't what he feared the most. What he feared was the lurking possibility of failure. He didn't want to remain forever trapped within the confines of
It had been three days since he'd been in the same room with Potter. He hadn't bothered to seek out the idiot and Potter had not bothered to seek him out. Draco, for his part, hadn't dared to. He had no idea how Potter had managed it, but the brunette had been able to slip into Draco's mind easier and faster than Draco was comfortable with. Living with Voldemort wandering the halls of his home, Draco had strengthened his own mental walls. They were ironclad. Not even Voldemort had been able to pry his way in at the end. Somehow Potter had just waltzed right in as though the door was wide open.
"To get a sword, obviously."
"That depends," Harry's eyes had remained downcast but when Soren spoke it drew them upward to meet his own. "What is a failure but a lesson learned?" Since they had entered the library Soren had remained relatively quiet, which Harry had assumed was a means to give him some time to digest the information he was being presented with. As Soren reached for another volume from the shelves Harry realized that he had arrived at the wrong conclusion. "I am under the assumption that you have never before heard the name Alethea Caroline Durham, am I correct?"
Harry barely had time to get the sound of Soren's name from his lips before the Elf had raised a hand, apologized for a third time and disappeared down the hall, leaving Harry standing alone in the overly large hall looking just as small as he currently felt. "Well that went well, didn't it?" He muttered, more than a little sarcasm slipping into his tone. Taking a moment, Harry glanced around taking in his surroundings. There were several doors leading in various directions. He had no idea where any of them went and he certainly had no idea where he was suppose to go. Soren had said that he could go wherever he pleased, but Harry still felt slightly like he was trespassing. As it were, he figured he had two choices. The first was to stand around looking ridiculous in the entrance hall or move forward into the Manor. At least with the second option, he didn't think he'd look as awkward as he currently did. If he was honest, he was a bit hungry. Perhaps if he wandered he might stumble across the kitchens. He hoped he didn't have to tickle a pear or something equally as ridiculous. The last thing he needed was to have Lothair find him tickling various paintings.
"Ah, I must do a better job of recalling that you were raised in the Wizarding world," Soren responded, frowning as he made a mental note to do just that and removed his riding cloak. The moment the fabric was in his hands, an individual, whom Harry had not previously noticed, stepped up to take it from him with a respectful bow of his head. "There will be many things that you will need to learn, but for now you must remember that everything has a life force."
"Right then," he muttered. It didn't matter, he supposed. Tomorrow they'd be back in classes and he'd be able to see the full extent of the patrols. He might still be able to make it work without drawing attention to himself. He hoped so anyway, otherwise, this whole thing was a giant waste of time.
"Harry." Ron supplied, shooting Hermione an annoyed look, "But someone doesn't seem all that interested in the fact that he should have been here by now."
"The swordsmith?" he asked, moving to follow after her, his curiosity peaked. "Why do we need to go to the swordsmith."
It did not, however, stop the entire student body from gawking at them and Harry could feel the flush creeping up his neck like a warm blanket. His eyes shifted to Draco and the idiot was practically preening beneath all the attention, earning him a dark glare from Harry. He must have felt it burrowing into the back of his head because he turned to look at him, an eyebrow raised with that all too familiar, haughty attitude.
Besides, he wasn't entirely stupid enough to wake someone up in a pitch black room he wasn't suppose to be in. Even Potter (or maybe especially Potter) was likely to hex first and ask questions later. Draco wasn't entirely looking to have a hole blown through him all because he'd decided Potter needed to be useful for once.
"Oh? So Malfoys sneak into peoples rooms in the middle of the night?" Harry really had no idea what was going on. After Draco had told him to go and heal his face, the two of them hadn't really interacted outside of the lessons that Soren was now making them take together. Harry had been giving the other man his space since he still seemed quite on edge.
"It has nothing to do with poor behaviour. You're an elf," McGonagall said plainly. "Your increased senses and speed give you an unfair advantage over the other students."
Gwynn just blinked in response. That was the second time he'd said that and she still couldn't wrap her mind around it. Harry said it as though it was something that happened everyday. Sure, perhaps blood transfusions in the Wizarding and Muggle world were no big deal, but this wasn't either of those places. There blood wasn't the same as Wizards and Muggles. There was so much more to it and she was positive that Harry didn't understand what he was doing. "You've got to be kidding me? Soren agreed to this? Rosalind agreed to this?" It just didn't make sense. There was only one time in an Elf's life that they shared their body or blood and this didn't exactly seem like a bonding ceremony … at least none of the ones she'd witnessed. This was just … wrong.
"Harry!"
Within his chest Harry could feel his heart racing, his blood singing as it was pumped through his veins at an alarming rate. His mind was caught between the cool sensations created by the gentle touch and the confusion surrounding what was taking place. He couldn't remember how he had come to be within this particular circle of arms but he knew, with every part of his heart, that if he pulled away he'd be physically pained. He belonged there and the thought of leaving was no longer an option. What surprised him the most was that even with every thing he was feeling, Harry could still feel the pulse that beat beneath the pale skin of the arms that held him: each beat echoing his own. Every time his heart skipped a beat Harry could feel an identical pattern pulsing against his shoulder blade. Whoever it was, their heart beat with Harry's.
Lifting a hand, Lothair held up two identical bracelets. "That's why you shall be wearing these," he commented, tossing them each one. The band was made out of braided leather and had a small opal secured in the center. "Each of us has one and it will suppress the full extent of your magic. Which means you will only have access to a limited amount of power. You are not to remove them unless it is a matter of life or death. Understood?"
Then there was that interaction with Gwynn in the kitchen. Harry could explain that even less than he could explain Draco actually seeking him out. Whenever the two of them happened to be in the same room things tended to end poorly, especially for him. Hell, the last time they'd been in the same room, Draco and beat him into a bloody puddle.
"Nothing," he responded, forcing himself to stop the movement of his hand. It soothed the ache within his chest, but the last thing he wanted to do was draw attention to it. For all he knew, the strange ache was nothing more then a strained muscle for all the sword swinging. Gwynn would never let him live it down if that was the case. He didn't even want to think about the possibility of Lothair finding out. That was one sneering face he really didn't want to deal with.
"Clearly not all students otherwise I'd be in the dorms," Harry responded with some exasperation. He didn't really know how to explain it without going too far into information that he did not wish to share.
"It's not you they're looking for," he snapped, realizing his mistake when Draco's eyes hardened. "I just meant-"
For the third time Hermione's warm brown eyes lifted from the page of the thick text she had balancing precariously on her knee, the creases of her forehead but one of the many signs that she was severely annoyed. "Do I think
"Why not?"
His only response was a low growl that had the hair on the back of his neck rising. Harry's attacks where coming faster and faster, which didn't leave Draco with much room to use either his sword or his magic. He could still feel Harry's magic building. He didn't know where Lothair or Ilaria were. He'd lost track of them in their fight. He briefly let his mind shift to locating them and that was all the invitation Harry needed, side stepping Draco's sword, Harry brought his own sword up holding it horizontally in front of him, the flat of the blade pushing back against his outstretched palm. The scent of blood zeroed Draco's attention back on Potter just in time to see the blood well up over the edge of the brunettes blade as it dug into his skin before all that magic Harry had been building within him exploded outward in a wall of air.
Ignoring the almost painful desire burning within his overly warm body, Harry put all of his focus on discovering that name. He needed to know who it was. He needed to say it. Harry wasn't entirely sure why, but he did know that only the name was important. His lips parted in a hopeful attempt to let the name slide off of his tongue but the sound that escaped him was not what he expected.
"Then I'm going, as well," Draco commented, crossing his arms and daring them to argue.
Despite the general conversation and the brief mention of himself, it seemed as though he was intruding on something that he was not meant to be a part of: a connection between the three High Lords that, in no way, included him. He had to fight the sensation to take a step back and give them their privacy. It was the same sensation that he felt at the Weasleys on occasion. He was both inside and outside of the current events. Before his instincts could take over completely, Harry found those brilliant blue eyes return to him, pinning him once again to the spot. There was something about the Lady of the Southern Lands that set her apart from the others. There was something that commanded his constant respect and attention.
The sound of the door clicking softly as it shut, had him glancing back over his shoulder. Rosalind offered him another small smile, this one tinged with what he assumed was worry and that made his blood run cold. So there was something wrong. Was he going to die after all? "What is it?" he asked, wondering if he really wanted to know her answer. He wasn't entirely sure if he was going to be able to handle whatever it was that she had to tell him.
Harry frowned, glancing away as they continued to walk. He didn't want to let go of the anger that had gripped him. A part of him wanted retribution. The deepest part of him wanted blood and that part scared him. He'd gone through so many changes he had assumed there was nothing left to change, but he was starting to feel like he was losing even more of himself; piece by piece. "What do you want me to do then?" he asked, his tone a little sharper than he had intended.
"Guys!"
"Finally," he grinned, guiding Erebus into step beside her chestnut mare and heading back to the group without glancing back to Saeya behind him. "I thought I'd die of old age first."
Her nose wrinkled as she turned to see if he was serious. "That sounds disgusting."
Taking Hermione's advice, Harry had headed to McGonagal's office once classes were over and, if he was completely honest, he deeply regretted having gone.
Draco still hadn't turned around, instead choosing to scowl darkly at Gabriel's quickly retreating form. He was going to kill that idiot. Wolves or not. Stealing himself with a variety of ways to accomplish said feat, he finally turned to find Potter glaring at him, emerald fire flashing in his eyes. He supposed that was better than the cold wall he'd been getting. The brunette, however, was not alone. Standing to his left and a few steps behind was Gwynn who looked like she was trying to disappear into the shadows.
"Shakespeare was not the only individual to find her enchanting," Soren smiled, his tone was one of fondness and respect. "She was an amazing individual, powerful and very wise."
"I understand that you mean well,"Soren continued, cutting off the conversation between the two and allowed Draco the chance to shift his eyes to the Potions master standing behind the Headmaster. The slight turn of the man's head told Draco that Dumbledore did not know the entirety and that barb had been the extent of the man's knowledge. It also made him realize that Snape knew more, which meant he needed to find an opportunity to speak with him. His attention shifted back to Soren as the Elf continued. "But your concern is no longer necessary. Harry has found his place in the world and revenge is not something that he needs in order to find himself at home."
"I love you, Draco," she responded, as he felt the very familiar tug behind his navel. "Don't let them catch you."
Harry turned to glance at Ron and raised an eyebrow in question. Ron, for his part, just shrugged and said. "I think overestimating our interest in our education helps her refrain from murdering us in our sleep."
"If what that letter states is true than Harry is no longer a Wizard. He is a magical creature and the law will treat him as such. No matter how we may disagree, Harry is no longer bound by either our legal or educational systems."
Draco had to fight the urge not to shift in his seat. Blaise had always had a way of making you feel like he could see right through you and given the fact that the only thing keeping him from seeing the full extent of Draco's changes was a simple glamour spell, Draco was a little less than comfortable.
"Silly me for thinking you might have matured over the summer," she responded dryly.
"Yeah, yeah," Draco muttered, glancing up and down the hallway they were in. So far, he could retrace his steps from the Royal wing to the kitchen, the library, and the infirmary. There were still plenty of places to locate, at least of the ones he was aware of. He wasn't familiar with the place in order to know all that it held within it's walls, but he had a good guess that there was far more than even he could imagine. "Where's the armory?"
"He infuriates me all the time!" he hissed back.
Whatever Draco was going to say was interrupted by Lothair calling everyone back. He waited for Draco to haul himself off the bed before heading out and back down the hallway. "There are enough bedrooms for everyone down there," he commented, jerking his thumb toward the hallway where Draco was just emerging from. "Furniture included."
It wasn't a bathing room. It was a bloody hot spring paradise. Maybe he wouldn't stick his nose up at the use of it ... so long as Potter was busy elsewhere. It seemed like less of a paradise if he had to share it with the git.
Ilaria's peal of laughter echoed across the room even as Harry flipped him off.
"This is never going to work."
There was a moment when Soren truly felt a sliver of disappointment but it was immediately brushed away by the seriousness of his task. There was no point in feeling disappointed. The error could and would be corrected. "I suppose this is but another example of the inadequacy of Wizarding education," he sighed, the main focus of his attention turned to flipping through the pages of the second book. "They will teach you how to levitate a feather but when it comes to truly important aspects of this world they are sorely lacking." It took another moment before Soren made a pleased sound and his hand stilled. Shifting forward, he turned the book and placed it over top of the first volume. "Alethea Caroline Durham. This is where your story begins."
The comment had not come from any of the men, but contained a soft tone that had previously been absent from the group. Along with this voice came the sound of light footsteps echoing through the hall. Soren, Lothair, and Harry all turned their attention to the new arrival. For Harry, the moment was a bit surreal. His eyes found themselves focusing on identical blue irises surrounded by a delicate line of black eyeliner and thick, dark lashes. Soren had done a proficient job creating Harry's disguise, for he was almost an exact replica of the woman standing before them. As she came to a stop in front of him, Harry's eyes met hers and they shared a gaze that seemed to isolate the two of them for the briefest second. When she looked away, only then was the bond between them broken, leaving Harry with the strange sense that he had just been released from restraints rather than her gaze.
She certainly wasn't the first one to have ever said it. Hermione used to try and smooth it out from time to time, though she wasn't quite so blunt with her opinion on it as Gwynn. Eventually, she'd just sort of sigh and accept it as it was. She never could get it to settle.
Various sets of eyes shifted around the table as Draco stiffened in his seat. There was no way that he could have forgotten about these results, but he had assumed that he'd have more time to prepare himself for the potential answers it provided him. He felt Potter's eyes on him but all he could do was stare at the healer as she moved to sit in the chair Soren had summoned for her. She literally held Draco's life in her hands and he felt like a ship set adrift in a storm.
Harry's eyes snapped open. The sharp sound of something tapping against glass had cut across his mind like a newly sharpened blade, scattering the images of his dream and once again burying the name he so desperately needed.
The bond between the boys was something born of nature itself. In order to further it's stages, they would need first the approval and cooperation of the elements as well as their heightened strength. The magic at the core of each Elf, while significant, was no substitute for the natural magic of the world.
"You know what I mean!"
"It's not impossible," he argued, even though he wasn't entirely sure if he could actually dampen them completely.
As though in response, Draco felt the draw from his own weapon. In contrast, his own core seemed to respond to the lack of his own emotions. That cool calm that spread through him was what drew his element to him. As it spread through him it added a chill to the wind that was curling around his frame. The cold emanated from him but it didn't bother him. He barely felt it. The fact that Lothair had been able to contain his own elemental magic and build it up was something Draco couldn't contemplate entirely. His own had just started to move through him and the pressure was already immense.
Lothair rolled his eyes, that all too familiar disdain back on his feature. "No. They won't."
Every attempt to logically explain the situation was scattered with every cool brush against his skin. The fingertips that had been exploring the lines of his stomach had moved and become much more substantial as they dipped beneath the edge of his waistline and smooth palms rested securely on his hips, firmly holding him in place. Another low moan escaped with effortlessly as cool lips found purchase on the curve of his neck, sending a pleasant chill throughout his body. The contrasting temperatures, rather than being an inconvenience, made Harry's heart race all the more. It left him breathless and wanting more.
It was his sense of smell that returned first, filling his nasal passages with the nauseating stench of blood and causing his stomach to clench and roll violently in an attempt to expel what Draco knew wasn't there. The sharp movements caused by his body's dry heaves served only to remind him of his injuries as pain flared through his shoulder, a low groan escaping through his abused vocal cords. Through the haze of pain, he did manage to do a quick inventory of his injuries and was relieved to discover nothing he hadn't already been aware of. His location, however, took much more time to determine. The last thing he could remember was Professor Snape forcing potions into him. There had been a certain level of pain moving through his body, but he couldn't be sure that he could associate the pain with the potions. He'd been in pain prior to ingesting them.
Lothair's attention shifted to Akkar. "Circle back and look for any foreign traces of magic."
Coming up beside the redhead, Harry nodded in greeting, her intelligent eyes having watched his approached and not missed a single movement. "Thanks for joining us," he started, somewhat awkwardly. "I appreciate your willingness to help."
"Mum just sent me an owl," he explained shoving it at her until she had to pull back in order to read it. "Says he's coming back and Malfoy's with him!"
"Are you finished with your pissing contest?" Lothair asked, dryly. Frankly, he didn't care what the idiots looked like so long as they looked human.
Slowly removing his hand from Harry's arm, Lothair took a step back and the sound immediately cut off with Draco's eyes closing once again. Turning to look at each other, Harry and Lothair shared a surprised look before they separated; each one taking a different direction. While Lothair moved from the room to locate Rosalind and the other two High Lords, Harry instantly moved to Draco's side to get the first look at the changes that had befallen the blond.
"Gwen," the blonde scoffed, the word falling off his lips like it was the most vial thing he'd ever spoken. "Did you bind her to you as well? Did you go behind her back or am I just special?"
Harry, despite his previous annoyance at being treated differently, felt the flush start to work it's way up his neck until it stained his cheeks and colored the end of his pointed ears. He hadn't meant to have Ilaria lecture them on their responsibilities. That definitely hadn't been his intention.
"Ah, Harry, my boy," he stated, "I'm glad to see that you're well. You gave us quite the scare when you went missing from your Aunt and Uncles"
Snape made a face and made a motion with his hand to dismiss the comment. "Showcasing his usual idiocy, of course."
If either of them had been expecting to end the night without a confrontation, Harry and Draco were sorely disappointed when they both received a memo near the end of dinner informing them that they had been summoned to the Dumbledore's office. Harry had internally sighed but had gone without complaint when Lothair had come to collect him. He felt distinctly like a child being led to face the consequences of his actions.
"Harry!"
"I'm not. Sharing your blood with someone, particularly a human, is not something to be taken lightly."
Grinning, he took a big bite of his eggs before he realized the other two were looking at him. Glancing up, he found both of them glaring at him. "What?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
When Harry glanced up, he found his eyes immediately locking with Dumbledore's and the hair on the back of his neck rose. He could feel the magic in the air, tingling over his skin as though warning him of impending danger. Dumbledore's eyes remained on Harry even as he responded to Lothair.
Finally managing to push her off, Harry broke the surface coughing up some of the water he'd swallowed in his surprise. "Alright, alright," he grumbled, pushing his now soaked hair out of his face and pinning her with a glare of his own. "I'm sorry. I don't see what the big deal is anyway! We're just relaxing."
He wasn't sure why, but Draco was positive there was a smirk resting on the corner of Potter's lips that the blond had never seen there before. His eyes locked on it, narrowing further when Potter's dueling partner tensed, a clearly visible flush stealing over her pale cheeks. The red of her flush could have just as easily symbolized the rush of angry heat that stabbed through Draco as it had her own embarrassment. He didn't know who this woman was, but it was quite clear that she was connected to Potter in one form or another.
“Involve me!?” Harry whispered harshly, “Are you kidding me? This is our case! Mine and Draco’s! We trusted you by letting you in on the poison, there’s no way in hell you are going to kick off Draco.”
“So,” Ron continued, “Remmins and Aviary watched Savant’s memory together after the initial interrogation. I wasn’t there, but Aviary told me everything. She said Remmins began to freak out only minutes into the interrogation. Apparently, he had realized that the way Brayan was acting unusually. He told Aviary he believed that Brayan was under the Imperius curse while he was speaking under the influence of truth serum!”
“Will Rose be there?” Albus inquired eagerly.
“Yeah, but we always wanted to save a child from a bad situation as well,” Dean murmured, “We can make a family, no matter what. It’s just… so hard to believe we have our right to reproduction taken away from us.”
“I’m sure Fred loved that, Rox,” Harry said. Turning to Angelina, he continued, “Perhaps I should’ve warned you about this one. James and Al didn’t talk to one another for a couple days after our last family game of Sorry.”
“Draco! What is the meaning of this! Certainly you can agree mudbloods should not be in our house!” Walburga screamed.
“No, god forbid,” Harry joked. His voice was light but he doubted Draco couldn’t tell how nervous he was.
Harry nodded, “I’m a secret keeper.”
He looked longingly at the pie, “If you don’t mind.”
By the smell that immediately fell over him as soon as Ginny walked in, he could tell she had had a large amount to drink. However, Ginny looked just as composed as ever as she flopped on top of her side of the bed. She could hold her liquor better than anyone he had ever met.
Harry nodded in agreement. Parvati and Lavender were having their first dance. Lavender had chosen a floor length white gown with plenty of lace, while Parvati was wearing a shorter fitted white dress. As they held close to each other, Harry could see the clear love and adoration in their faces. They really cared about each other.
Draco nodded, while Blaise piped up, “So I’m good to go? Because I need to get the hell out of this hospital. No offense or anything. I’m sure your job is fun.”
“Of course!” Harry exclaimed, “Angelina said she was always confused about how Reyes seemed to buy so much stuff for the team and yet they were still short on basic things, like spare clothes, at practices!”
.	“How? How did you… how?” Harry asked, “He was my mentor. My friend. I trusted him.”
“No,” Harry said firmly, “There’s no way.”
“They have a point there, Mum,” Bill said to Molly, “We can tell them what we know, which isn’t much.”
“I know,” he whispered.
Harry ran towards Remmins, “What’s going on?”
“What? No, of course not! Listen, your mother and I are not on bad terms.”
Ginny shook her head, “I can’t believe this. All this time I’m pining after Blaise, worried of what my family will think, when you were developing a crush on Draco Malfoy!”
“Harry, dear,” she asked tentatively, “Is everything okay?”
“Not gonna say anything? That’s a new development?” Draco’s voice was light, but his tone was dark.
“Ida, we will take Harry’s statement after he sees Dean. He deserves to see he’s alright for himself,” Ron turned to Aviary, “Av, could you and Remmins take his statement? Since Youll is out of commission, he’ll need someone to take the statement with him.”
“With Kareach?” Harry demanded.
Ida appeared on the other side of their shield, blocked from her fellow Kareach members.
“Exactly,” Molly said, pointing her wand at James, Louis and Harry’s finished piles and transporting them through the air to a pot on the stove, “No reason to bring down Sunday lunch. Ron and Hermione may even be by later, so we will not fret.”
“We will,” the three of them answered.
“This isn’t some phase, Malfoy'' Harry scowled, “If you had given me the chance to actually talk to you, I would have told you that Ginny and I are getting a divorce. That neither of us have been happy in our marriage for a while. I would have also told you that I like you. That I don’t just tell every person I meet that they are the most extraordinary person I’ve ever met. For you to think that I would only want to be with you in secret, behind Ginny’s back, is just cruel.”
Harry’s head shot up, “What!”
“Draco?” Ginny finished, “You seemed really off after James brought up Draco. That could have just been because your own son was accusing you of cheating on your wife and because your best friend pushed you to the ground, but I got this feeling,” she turned to look directly at Harry, “Did you two start something?”
The door swung open, revealing a clearly exhausted Draco. He was still dressed in the clothes he had worn to the quidditch match, which were now tattered and dirty. This was the first time Harry had ever seen Draco in anything that wasn’t spotless and somehow gleaming (he hadn’t known clothes could gleam until he met Draco). When Draco realized who it was, he shook his head and began to shut the door.
“No ‘I’m sorry I left my partner alone to stakeout some Russian wizard all by himself’ or ‘I’m sorry I take three fucking days to get over myself in order to talk to you again, Draco’,” Draco said as if Harry had not spoken. He crossed his arms and fell gracefully onto one of his couches as he looked at Harry for an answer.
“Daddy!” the door flung open to reveal Lily, followed by James, Rose, Al and Scorpius.
“It’s Ms. Weasley,” Ginny shot, “And I will gladly leave. Just one last thing,” she stared at Harry with venom in her eyes, “You are not welcome in my home! Do you hear me? It’s time to do what you should have done years ago and get your own apartment!”
“Apparently not,” Harry mumbled, pressing his finger into a crumb on his plate.
“I’m sorry!” Harry nearly shouted, his anger rising, “I overreacted! But you cannot sit here and tell me you don’t want me to be a part of this investigation! You know I care, Draco. I was just being a prat for one day.”
“Sorry,” Ron said sheepishly from behind Harry, “A lot on my mind.”
“I was going to clean it first.” she mumbled apologetically, using her wand to move all her things into the corner of the room.
“So you think Kareach is real?” Harry asked, interest peaked.
Ida sighed and threw her arm around Harry, “Typical Harry bloody Potter. Never listening until the conversation is about him.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, “Now I’m starting to think you do hate Weasley. Should I write a story on that?”
“I didn’t sign some kind of binding contract, now did I?” Malfoy pointed out, signaling the bartender once again for another glass of wine.
“Starting to feel that way?” James joked.
“Okay. We can start the interviews,” Ida said.
Draco laughed, the sound light and freeing, “I love you, Harry Potter.”
Draco was pacing. Harry could sense his panic from here. He felt his own dread and guilt rise in his throat. He wanted to flee, get as far away from this situation as possible, but he couldn’t. Dean and Seamus deserved that much. Harry moved to speak when Draco knelt down in front of him and grabbed his arm.
Al obliged, glowering as he threw James’s scarf at him and encouraged Scorpius in another attempt to get a triple back flip as Rose rolled her eyes at the lot of them.
Brayan shook his head, sending a little flare streaking past Harry’s chair, “No. I would be one of the first to know, so there is a slim chance anything new has been uncovered. Now Harry,” he continued, giving Harry a slightly belittling look that caught him off guard; this was the look Brayan usually reserved for the less talented trainees, “I know you want to do everything you can to help out. But we have the most clever and well-accomplished staff of Healers at St. Mungos that are doing much more than looking through history books. While I admire your attempts, I would recommend you use your time more wisely and prep for your upcoming exam. You haven’t always been as accomplished at test taking than as you are at the practical parts of healing.”
More than once did Ilaria have to snap at him, once they had entered the city. He hadn't yet left the castle and the sights that greeted him on the bustling streets were something he'd never have imagined. It reminded him vaguely of the first time he'd been to Diagon Alley. Back then, he'd been amazed by the magic. Signs of it had been everywhere from floating packages to moving bricks. This, however, was something else entirely. Everything was so open and lively that Harry was constantly stopping to stare. There were houses that seemed to have sprung up from the Earth itself, shops of all sorts, scents wafting from windows that he'd never smelled before, and no one seemed to be in a hurry. Everywhere they went, elves were going about their business, chatting with each other, nodding in respect to Ilaria as she passed, and even a few sent him a wave as he trailed after her. They likely thought he was another would be warrior under her care, but Harry couldn't be bothered to correct them. He'd be whatever they thought he was. He was too busy taking in everything around him to care much about titles.
"And?"
His insistence on joining this group hadn't been anything quite so noble as wanting to be a part of it or even wanting to protect that idiot behind him. He'd insisted on going because there was the possibility that Snape would be present for the meeting and he might then get the chance to confront him and determine whether or not he could be trusted.
"All the more reason to keep them involved. Children hear everything."
Pausing as though to take note of the situation, he held the door open longer than he would normally in order to allow Akkar to slip inside. "Professor," he greeted, watching as the wand slowly lowered. He supposed it made sense for the man to be cautious of him.
Once again Harry found himself blinking stupidly. He knew he was doing it and yet there was absolutely nothing he could do to stop it. Over the course of the past few days he had been given more information than any sane individual could possibly process. What was terrifying to note was the simple fact that there was still so much more for him to learn. "I don't understand," he admitted, not at all feeling ashamed to do so. "If they don't classify my parents as Elven relatives than why are they documented in this book?"
"I'll support your decision."
As much as these thoughts had been plaguing Harry's mind as of late, he couldn't hold on to them once Gwynn lunged forward with Ilaria's nod of acceptance, her sword held firmly in her hand and dangerously accurate. Harry's mind was now focused only on not falling prey to sharp bite of Gwynn's sword. His own weapon, after several days of intense training, had finally started to feel comfortable in his grasp, but it certainly wasn't wielded with as much skill as his counterpart. Having had barely enough time to defend against her attack, Harry hadn't been able to retaliate. All he could do was continue to block her attacks and hope that her strength would wane and put an end to the strong vibrations that ran through his arm with each blow.
The first potion was familiar. The heavy texture and oily taste were clearly characteristics of a blood-replenishing potion. If Lucius wanted to keep him alive, then Draco needed to have the blood he'd already lost replaced. It did nothing for the pain, nor did it heal him, but it served its purpose in sustaining Draco's current existence. The second potion, however, was strangely unfamiliar. The slight numbing sensation that spread through his fingers explained why the pain he'd been feeling was dulled. Whatever the potion was it was laced with a mild pain relief. It took the harsh edge off the pain without signalling Lucius as to its effects. What baffled Draco the most, however, was the slight hint of carnation and comfrey; the former symbolizing protection, strength and healing, while the latter symbolized safety during travel. No matter how hard his feverish mind worked, he simply couldn't formulate a potion that acquired both of those ingredients. Separate potions, yes, but not one that combined the two.
Hermione just snorted and glanced at Neville who turned a bit pink about the ears. "Sorry, Harry," he muttered, looking more apologetic than Harry really thought he needed to be. "She asked how the class had gone."
Since the guards were stationed at the gate twenty-four hours, Draco's first thought was that perhaps it was a citizen taking advantage of the hour and the lack of occupants the grounds would have. It didn't alleviate his suspicion. It certainly didn't explain the odd sensation he was feeling. It was almost like an electric charge lingering in the air and Draco, if he was honest, couldn't think of a reason for it's cause.
Draco didn't bother saying anything. He just stood there arms crossed and his usual look of disdain on his face as he waited for Potter to clue into his presence. It took a few moments before the brunette turned his head toward him. Finding his legs first, Harry frowned slightly before lifting his eyes to meet Draco's very familiar grey ones. After a moment, realization clicked in and his eyes widened in surprise.
What ever it was, it was more important then even he realized.
After a tense moment, Rosalind's hands slipped from their firm position on her hips. "A discussion it is," he nodded, turning and immediately leading the way back toward her office. If they were going to be going through with whatever ridiculous plan her mate was scheming, she was at least going to be preparing while he tried to explain himself. A blood transfusion and the initiating of such a high level bond wasn't easy work. She was going to have her hands completely full and there was very little that would keep her from being completely prepared for the responsibility.
"Simple," he returned, "I don't want to."
"Alright, you two," Ilaria clapped, motioning them toward the middle of the training area. Harry glanced back feeling somewhat wasn't like he hadn't trained with other people. He trained with Gwynn all the time and Ilaria let him join in on the training sessions for the younger guard members. It was just that ... well ... he was a little nervous to be facing off against Draco when the other had a sharp object in his hand. He couldn't ignore the fact that Draco had a much longer reach and a drastic advantage when it came to physical strength. While Harry had gained a more wiry strength, Draco had gained strength beyond that.
The larger of the Wolves let out a loud growl of anger, taking a step toward Harry before both Lothair and Ilaria's swords were restricting him from moving any closer. "You can not ban us without council, Dark Prince," he responded, his tone picking up a mocking tone when he addressed Harry's title. "The law decrees that we may not hunt Elves, but it has no other stipulations. We can and will hunt humans."
No further explanation was needed.
"I see no crossroad," she returned, her voice still soft and light.
Harry glanced up to find Draco standing beside him. At some point, he'd put on the baldric and his sword was rested safely against his back. As he stood there, arms crossed and watching the small battle between the High Lords, Harry felt a bit of tension leave him.
Glancing back toward the seemingly empty courtyard for a brief moment, Harry sighed softly before turning and following Ilaria back into his new home. Unbeknownst to him, a pair of deep violet eyes followed his path. She had been curious enough to risk disobeying a direct order from Lady Ilaria herself in the hopes of discovering the identity of the new arrival. For this particular instant, her daring had certainly played off.
Draco felt a deep ache erupt in his chest at the thought of Narcissa. When he'd woken in captivity, Draco had demanded answers regarding his Mother's location but had been rewarded with nothing but a sneer and the strong backhand of Lucius Malfoy. His father's response had not left him with much hope. If Lucius treated his only heir with such distaste, Draco could only imagine how he had treated the woman he'd simply married to produce an heir. Draco had a very distinct impression that he would never see her again. It was an impression that left him feeling horribly alone. He'd though he'd known what that felt like, but up until now he'd only ever guessed at it. Now he truly was alone.
. His family – or what was left of it – considered him a freak for the very abilities that classified him as a hero in the eyes of the general Wizarding population. This sense of heroism had always been based on an action he could never claim as his own. This new possibility granted him the ability to step outside the ever-frustrating circle of misrepresentation and prophecy that had, for the past six years, surrounded him completely. His role as Dark Prince was something that he could embrace honestly. No matter the outcome he was responsible for crafting this new image of himself. He was alive because of his Mother's selfless act but the legacy he would leave behind was finally of his own making.
Said storm, however, didn't so much as stop to notice the difference. Without a word or a backward glance, Harry continued his walk forward, turning down the corridor that Draco knew would lead him back to his own suite and disappeared from sight.
With the lid gone, Harry's sword was bathed in the light. It was much shorter than Draco's and darker. The blade was deep obsidian, flashes of silver flickering across its surface at the spots the light hit it. It was edged on both sides, like Draco's, but it did not have the same markings across the blade. In a way, Draco felt any markings to the blade would tarnish the perfection of the blade. The hilt was another point of difference between the swords. The hilt of Harry's sword was not beautiful in its simplicity. It was beautiful because of its intricacy. Vines spread out across the cross section, before winding up over the grip to create a nest where a large emerald lay, the ends of the vines reaching up to hold it securely in place. The entire thing was darkness given physical shape and Draco found himself thinking it was particularly apt.
"You what?" Aranel hissed, eyes narrowed. Apparently, he was well informed on how Ehlark should have responded.
Had the discussion not been so serious, Draco might have laughed outright at the various looks of surprise. Soren's eyebrows had disappeared into his hairline. Lothair was just blinking and, if he wasn't mistaken, there was a pout tugging at the corner of Ilaria's lips.
"Rosalind?"
At this, for the first time in years, Severus felt a tendril of fear wrap around him, "Without assistance, Draco won't last the night."
The very last thing Draco remembered was his Father's scream of fury and the smell of fresh grass as his abused body hit solid ground just before his tortured body finally allowed him to slip into the welcomed darkness of his mind.
Gwynn shot him an amused smirk before releasing his hand, which Harry hadn't even realized she had been still holding. The scowl remained on his features as he watched her disappear into the rows of students. He still wasn't entirely sure if Gwynn was making fun of him or actually being genuine. He had the feeling, however, that she was one of those individuals who could smile, tell you that you were completely useless, and you'd still think it was the best compliment you'd ever received.
There were several ways in which an individual could wake. One could wake as Hermione did, energetically to the sound of a trusty and punctual alarm. Then there was Ron, who only woke after being pushed, prodded, and threatened until he stumbled his way groggily to the loo. Harry, even before his change, had found himself comfortably located between the eager riser and the late sleeper. The only time he faced a discrepancy was when he was woken by the sharp pain and horror of being connected to Voldemort. Even then, waking from such a thing was a gradual experience.
"Why?" he asked, his hands clenching back into fists as they hung at his sides. Potter had made the decision to save him before the influence of the bond, so what was Potter's reason for it? Why had Potter been so determined to force him into this. Why was any of this happening?
"Unacceptable!" Ilaria barked, the familiar authoritative tone dripping from every word. "As future members of the Royal Guard you are under oath to follow through on the orders given to you by your superiors. While the Prince is in this training environment he will be treated like an equal member of the guard!"
Ilaria frowned, but nodded her agreement. "He's not wrong."
His screams were like nails digging into his skin and Draco had to force himself to remain where he was. He watched silently as the four elves held their hands out over Harry's spasming body. They began chanting quietly at first before their tones gradually rose over the sounds of Harry's screams. They continued this for what felt like hours before Harry's screams were cut off and his body stilled.
"But, your Highness-"
If he didn't know better, Harry would have thought he was jealous.
After the fifth time of having to turn around and fetch him from whatever had captured his attention, Ilaria grabbed him by the back of the neck and pushed him along ahead of her. "By the mother, you're worse than an infant," she grumbled, earning amused chuckles from those within hearing distance.
"We will absolutely not be going to the hot spring," she spluttered, shooting him an irritated look. Harry always seemed to bring that up whenever he wanted to distract her. There had been rumours after that incident. The thought of those whispered speculations still made her heat up with embarrassment. "Besides, it's not like you can afford to miss practice anyway."
"That hum?" Harry muttered, focusing. It seemed to be coming from a variety of directions and he couldn't understand why no one else could hear it.
"And what of your coronation?"
Harry shot the blond a look. He seemed intent on fighting and a part of him was concerned about what Draco was going to do once he returned to the Wizarding world. If he acted before Harry was ready, all hell was going to break loose. There was a part of Draco's mind that was darker than he let on. Harry didn't know how deep it went but he didn't need to be a Seer to know it could be a problem. There was a part of Harry that didn't want Lothair to teach them anything just yet. The larger part of him, however, argued that the stronger they became the harder it would be to kill them. Draco, in particular.
“That’s how Aries got so wasted he told our Lola that she was ‘uglier than the average naked mole rat’” Ida commented disapprovingly.
“I’m here to get you in. But before we do anything, you all need to know the plan,” Ron’s words tumbled over one another as he spoke.
“What!” Aviary shouted as Draco said, “Never mind that! What the hell happened today!”
“Great work, Harry,” Draco said gently.
They all rushed towards the fireplace, coming to a stop on their knees.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said, forcing himself to look directly at Draco, “I was in a weird mood last Friday and I acted like a wanker when you came to Mungos. “
“I knew it was a bad idea for you to befriend him! And know you are throwing away your whole family just for him!” Ron yelled. Before Harry knew what was happening, Ron shoved him. Harry landed on the floor, shocked.
There were plenty of grumblings, but slowly the group said their goodbyes to Hermione and told her reassurances (assuming her tears for solely trauma from the attack). Soon, the only people in the room were Ron, Harry and Rose, who was now lying on the bed, curled up in her mother’s embrace. Hermione was gently stroking her daughter’s face. She didn’t say anything. None of them did. They didn’t know what could be said.
Ron hesitated long enough to make Harry’s nerves skyrocket.
Harry nodded as he sat down beside her. He reached for her hand and grasped it tightly.
“Of course!” Remmins nearly shouted.
Ginny raised her eyebrows, “How, exactly?”
Harry realized as he stared at Aviary that whatever anger he was feeling towards Ida was nothing compared to what Aviary was feeling, “Aviary, I’m so sorry,” he whispered.
“Wouldn’t we all,” Ginny mumbled. She had finished her toast and eggs at rapid speed and was now gathering up her quidditch gear that was spread across the counter.
“What?” Both Harry and Aviary shouted, breaking her silence.
Malfoy smiled at his son, “I’m sure Potter would’ve loved to hear about your scholar- level knowledge of hippogriffs, but I’m afraid I see your mother.”
To his surprise, Draco didn’t say anything else. As Harry pulled out his wand and prepared to leave, new tears building in his eyes, he whispered,
Ron shook his head, “No. Well, at least not yet. There isn’t solid proof that Brayan was even under the Imperius curse. The only person that heard Remmins say any of this was Aviary, and while we all trust her, we can’t place our head Auror and two of our best Aurors on trial for something they most likely are not a part of.”
James rolled his eyes but grabbed Lily’s hand and led her over to the large group of cousins that was growing as more and more families arrived.
Harry shuddered at the thought. The idea of losing any other innocent people made his body stiff with anger and fear.
“So what happened?” Harry asked, now highly intrigued in what derailed Malfoy’s investigative career. Now that Harry thought about it, Malfoy had written many of the articles the Prophet received praise for for being above the superficial and altered stories that had once defined it. Although Harry had never worked with Malfoy when he was an Auror, he now recalled some of his colleagues working with Malfoy to see what he had uncovered. Hannah Abbot had gotten useful information about a drug ring from Malfoy. At the time, Harry thought it was easier to blame the eventual spell damage Hannah suffered from due to the fact she went into the place Malfoy thought held the drug ring alone. Harry now realized that Malfoy had given Hannah crucial information that no one really took seriously due to his past reputation. He felt a sudden pang of guilt at this realization. Maybe doubts like his and Hannah’s was what was costing Malofy his job now.
Harry sat down on the floor in the room with his back propped against the bed. Aviary sat down next to him, her eyes wide as she took in the decor of the room. Draco sat down reluctantly opposite of them, his back against the wall.
“Okay,” Ida pulled a hair tie around the end of her braid and looked at him, a concerning look of determination brewing in her dark eyes, “I have a friend. We almost dated, but nothing came of it because he’s not my type. Too cheery, you know? Wouldn’t work with my admittedly darker stance on life.”
“Murr? That’s adorable!” Harry chuckled, “And the name “Roger” for a corgi puts our pet naming abilities to shame. Our lab’s name is ‘Padfoot’.”
“One more minute, Dad!” Albus called, causing Harry to roll his eyes in exasperation.
“Thanks sir,” Harry paused, then decided to add, “I’m actually reading up on what the poison could be that’s been used in all the attacks. Do you know if there have been any new ideas?”
“How are you?” she whispered softly into his ear. Harry hadn’t talked to her since his confession a few weeks before. He had been secretly dreading seeing her again. Harry had put his crush on Draco and his unhappiness in his marriage so far from his mind for the weeks leading up to Christmas that he was starting to think the idea of leaving Ginny was anything but realistic. He had a family; that was something he was beyond lucky to have, what with all the families that would be nonexistent because of Chann. He shouldn’t trade that for Draco.
“I love you,” he murmured, to break the silence that had fallen in the room.
Draco turned to look at him, “Of course not. But it never has been. I can’t stop now.”
Harry did just that, going through the fire and standing in Draco’s living area seconds later. The effect of Draco’s apartment was amplified as he stood within it.
“Your whole body freezes and you can’t move,” James explained.
“What?” Ginny gasped, “Are you telling the truth? How on earth could bloody Malfoy know that?!”
Harry doubted they would be able to sway each of them to their cause, but that was fine. Soren had explained that the decision did not have to be unanimous. In reality, they only needed to convince three of the five. Furthermore, if they could convince Aranel than his agreement had the potential to sway Ehlark to the same opinion. The third option was likely Kolvar. Originally, he had hoped to have Draco's help with that sell. Harry had little experience with the wealth of the Wizarding world. Nor did he know much about their imports and exports. As a Pureblood with a plethora of connections, Draco would have been the likely choice for tackling that front. As it stood, however, he wouldn't ask for his assistance.
She nodded, unfazed by what he was saying. "The High Lord has told me the basics. I am already prepared for the first objective."
It had seemed like forever, but Soren eventually straightened and turned his attention to Ilaria. "I'd like you to accompany me, Ilaria. The Wolves must not be kept waiting. Hospitality is the only thing we currently have to smooth over the current situation, which is something we must do prior to the council with Harry. It is a complicated matter that neither party completely understands."
"No, no, it was definitely Draco calling you an idiot."
Harry's head snapped up as his eyes immediately searched out the figure of Soren. The instant he spotted Soren's much smaller mate coming through the door behind him, Harry forgotten all about Lothair and his poor attitude. At the moment he was insignificant and would remain so. All Harry cared about was seeing Draco and making sure that the Slytherin continued to breath. Despite his desire to press the matter, he knew better than to go rushing forward. He stayed where he was, his body taunt as he waited for the okay. There were muscles tensing that Harry hadn't even known he possessed and all of them were hell bent on finding their way to the Manor's new ward. It seemed like ages before Rosalind's soft smile told him what he'd been waiting to hear. Draco was alive. It only took half a second for his body to move after that, the tension in his muscles turning to energy and pushing him forward until he disappeared through the doorway. He let the heavy door swing shut behind him and didn't bother a glance back..
Harry laughed, “I agree. All the articles on me are pointless now. My life has become quite mundane,” he paused to look at Malfoy, “I understand where your frustration is coming from, and I don’t blame you for being upset.”
“I know what you are thinking,” Padma supplied, “But it’s not Zabini. It sure does look like him though. And although I hate to admit it, Zabini is a fine bloke. My ruddy sister was right,” She shuddered at this and took a swing of her butterbeer. Padma wasn’t much of a drinker.
“Yes,” Ida agreed, “But not our priority at the moment. We could be closer to finding a solution to stopping all of this.”
“We are going to be entrusting them with a serious investigation,” Draco huffed in response, “I think I could start using their first names. Maybe not in front of them, though. Not if it’ll get this reaction.”
“Because this whole fight is ridiculous and I’m just going to bloody tell you how the stakeout went before I explode,” Draco stated.
“Who are you rooting for, Uncle Bill?” James demanded after he pulled back from a hug with his uncle.
“This seems like a very roundabout way to tell me something,” Harry said softly, a grin forming curling up the edge of his mouth.
He pulled his son into a hug, holding on tight,
Harry shook his head, “Ida, what in the world are you saying? You’ve always told me that you will never do what your parents want, that you are your own person. Now you’re saying Draco isn’t able to make his own decisions?”
Ginny sat down on the bed. Then, without warning, she burst into tears. When Ginny cries, like really cries,  it isn’t a small scene. She wails and gasps for air as if the world is crumbling around her. Harry bent down to comfort her.
Harry decided not to speak as he looked at Aviary expectantly. Ron and Ginny were frozen in their positions at each side of him with expressions of alarm and concern as they waited for what Aviary had to say.
“My thoughts precisely,” Blaise agreed, “But I’m rather happy he decided to hit me. Because immediately after, he lost his balance, as no doubt he wasn’t used to making good shots, and fell and broke his arm.”
Harry shushed him gently and continued to seal up the large cuts across his face as Seamus held him steady. Once he had healed the gashes the best he could, Harry began to clean the blood from Draco’s head and face. He then did a routine check on Draco. When he was sure Draco would be fine, he pulled back, his heart hammering as he fell into something behind him.
“Thank you, Ida. But,” Hermione declared, “As head of IMC, I should know more languages.”
“Number 12, Grimmauld Place is located between Number 11 and Number 13.”
She turned to Malfoy and laughed, “You act as if seeing me is a death omen.”
“So he wasn’t here for you?” Dean asked as Harry sat down next to him again.
Luna then launched into a story of how her father once told her that the bats in central Europe started a protest against the implications of the Bat-Bogey hex, in which Harry was finding himself wishing were true, just by the absurdity of the thought. Not long after, the group turned its attention to Dean, who had begun telling a rather bizarre story of a patient he had treated this week who had a garden growing out of his chest. Dean had just finished telling them “he rather liked the cucumbers, but the radishes needed work” when a knock sounded at the door.
It took only a moment before the three of them moved into action, grabbing their things and moving swiftly towards the door. Once outside, the three of them apparated without speaking, appearing a moment later in front of the phone booth.
Harry squirmed a little at the term “wife”. It felt wrong to still associate him with Ginny when they both had spent months thinking of other men. But he re-engaged in the conversation to hear Seamus explain how he was not going to root for either of the teams, as he respected both for their hard work and dedication to the league.
“I have something I need to say,” Ginny stated, the small waver in her voice the only thing giving away the fact that she desperately did not want to have this conversation, “Something I’ve needed to say then longer than I’d like to admit.”
Seamus sent Dean a half-hearted glare as Parvati exclaimed, “What gossip chain? I’ve been missing out on Ministry gossip for years. The Department of Magical Transportation has next to nothing interesting going on.”
“Hello, everybody,” he whispered.
“Ron?” Harry blurted, “What are you doing here?”
So Harry floo-ed into the Weasley-Granger living room, not knowing quite what to expect. Only Rose was in the room, coloring a picture on the floor.
Ron snorted as he appeared from the front yard, “It’s true. Rose was the easiest child in the world. I wish I could say the same for this one,” his whispered as he nodded back at Hermione, who was leading their son Hugo towards the group.
“Draco, that’s not true…” Harry began, but Draco cut him off.
Harry strode back into the Burrow through the kitchen door. Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Al, Rose and Fred were all helping put the finishing touches on lunch.
“Harry!” Aviary hissed.
“You as well,” Harry said, shaking her hand, “Your son was telling me you work in the hospital as a magical creatures expert. That must be an exciting job!”
“What…” Malfoy started again, but Harry cut him off.
“Hermione, you know more languages than anyone I’ve ever met,” Harry countered.
“Bye, Ida.” Harry replied, watching as she pulled out her wand and apparated from the spot next to him. As soon as she left, it occurred to Harry he has never gotten the full story of what had happened in Yorkshire. Despite the fact he was no longer an Auror, Harry was very curious as to what would happen with the case he, Ida and much of the Aurors had been working on for months before he left. Three terrific attacks had occured in Diagon Alley over the course of the past eight months. Evidence suggested that owners of three shops: the Apothecary, Eeylops Owl Emporium and Trustins Cafe, had been put under the Imperius curse and had been forced to sell poisoned merchandise to customers. To make matters worse, the only wizards and witches impacted by the dreadful purchases had been muggleborns. Luckily, the Aurors had been able to save most of the wizards and witches poisoned, but numerous casualties had forced the Ministry to put Diagon Alley on high alert security measures for months. The measures had only eased in the past few weeks as threats seemed to have become nonexistent. Harry was terrified to think what could happen now that the attacks were not only resurfacing, but occurring in muggle communities. Feeling bad he wouldn’t be around to help solve the case, Harry hoped Ida and Ron would keep him in the loop as much as possible. He wanted to do anything he could, even if it was from the sidelines.
Harry stood up abruptly as Malfoy moved to walk out of the cafe, “You bloody well will not! I may not be an Auror anymore, but I care what happens to wizarding society! I'm not going to sit back and let you do this on your own when I can help!” Harry finished, breathless, and refused to look away from Malfoy as the man stood stunned in front of him.
Without another word, Draco and Harry made their way side by side to the lift. When they reached it, Harry pressed the button and waited for the doors to open. They shot open only moments later, but not to an empty lift. Ron was standing in the lift with a group of people. He instructed them to leave, then turned frantically to Harry and Draco.
Ida laughed at this and waved a bartender over, “We are going to need some vodka shots,” she said determinedly. Turning to Harry, she said, “I can't stop you from being Malfoy’s friend. But I can stop you from leaving this pub without enjoying my company. Let’s not talk about this anymore.”
This immediately drew in the attention of Ginny, Angelina and Seamus who launched into a conversation about quidditch faster than a snitch moved across a pitch.
Aviary slammed her fist into the floor. Harry watched as he knuckles began to bleed, but she didn’t seem to notice or care. She continued to pummel the floor, tears coming fast and hard to her eyes. Harry sat back in shock, his own grief and anger over Ida overtaking him. He watched absently as Draco moved across the floor and gently pulled on Aviary’s arm. She stopped trying to smash a hole through the floor and turned to look at him. She then threw her arms around Draco, who held her as she cried and cried into his shoulder. Harry watched in amazement as Draco comforted someone he hardly knew as she cried over the murder of her boyfriend and the betrayal of one of her closest friends. His heart surged for Draco, which was a completely unhelpful thing at the moment.
“What happened, Harry?” Hermione worried from above a pile of carrots, “Should I be back at work?”
Draco stared at him for a second, expressionless. Then he said forcefully, “Come through before I change my mind.”
“So Blaise is gay!” Harry said, shocked.
Malfoy winced slightly at this and sighed.
“Ida, please listen…” he started as she walked towards the door, collecting her papers with her wand as she went.
Ron dropped the blanket he had grabbed for Hermione and stared at Harry with a look of complete petrification on his face. Hermione, however, didn’t look nearly as fearful.
There was a particular sense of surprise in the room as the sliding of chairs and shuffling of bodies filled the air. Never before had the High Lords requested a strict audience. During the years without a ruler all decisions had been made by means of the group. By the looks and muttering of some members he knew that many did not like the sudden change, but Soren wasn't going to risk the safety of the realm simply because certain individuals believed that they should be included. Once the door had been firmly sealed behind the last elf, a strong locking and privacy spell fell into place. Outside of those in the room, no one was to be aware of what their decision would be.
Daemeon nodded in agreement, flicking considering eyes to Harry. After a moment, he pushed away the counter and moved to one of the display cases. After a moment, he returned with a sword in hand. Just by looking at it, Harry could tell it was well crafted. The metal gleamed even in the low light and he didn't need to touch it to know the blade was sharp enough to split hairs. When Daemeon held it out to him, Harry glanced briefly to Ilaria before taking the weapon in hand. It was different than the shortsword they had been using in training. It was a bit longer and somehow lighter. Despite the fact that he had never held the likes of it before, it felt strangely comfortable in his hand.
"It's just human magic."
"Unfortunately," Lucius started again, completely unconcerned with the way his son's jaw was hanging loosely. "I've not been given the order to kill you. The Dark Lord would like to claim that honour for himself and I cannot begrudge him that. He was rather looking forward to having you serve him and is quite displeased with your attitude. You will be made an example of, Draco. No one refuses the Dark Lord."
Draco didn't have a chance to respond before a responding crash rattled the door on its hinges. Whether or not Draco had questions, they were out of time. His numb fingers could barely keep purchase on the smooth surface of the locket once Narcissa had removed her hands from his, a warm tickle of magic ghosting over his skin as he sensed the portkey within it. He vaguely recognized the locket as the one that always hung around his mother's neck, but the thought didn't hold for long before another replaced it.
"I would like to, however, speak with Professor Snape regarding my return. He is my Head of House, after all."
lurking!" Draco shot back, a slight flush on his pale cheeks. "A Malfoy doesn't lurk. It's not my fault you sleep like the bloody dead."
"Just get up!"
That being said, I realize that things with Draco and Harry are still not resolved and that we haven't had any more information on the bond between them. Don't fret. We are finally back at Hogwarts in this chapter. More information on the bond is coming soon. Promise. There's a lot going on for the boys these days!
"The Lichen continue to patrol the Western border," only if one listened closely could they hear the brief shiver of fear that had lingered beneath the gruff tone of the Scout. "Their movements do not reflect an alliance with the Realm, but they have remained adamant about maintaining possession of the hunting grounds at the base of the mountains. Even the most persuasive of our measures has not been successful in flushing them out."
Harry had been stunned by the sheer size of the room when he'd first seen it. He'd wondered why any one person would need so much room, but the answer had hit him not long after. It was not meant for one person. It was meant for a family. The thought had hit him hard. He didn't have a family to share this with. Sure, there was the Weasleys. They were the closest thing to a family Harry had ever known...but he wouldn't be able to share this with them. He'd done enough reading on his own to know that Humans were not permitted to enter the realm under any circumstances. Unless they were all changed, Harry would not be permitted to share his new home with them.
"Yes, we were informed of your intentions for Harry," Dumbledore nodded, acknowledging the previous letter, "But I'm afraid you don't understand Harry's importance in our world. He has a duty to fulfill that was put into place by his parents before him."
"He comes with us," Harry ordered, his eyes narrowing in on the cowering wolf. "Until punishment is decided upon."
"Then so are we."
Desperately searching Severus' face, Draco felt the last bit of his hope slipping away from him. There was nothing in the man's expression that suggested he was anything more then a participant. Snape raised a hand to grip Draco's neck, surprisingly mindful of his injured jaw. With Draco's head tilted back, two vials appeared in his free hand. Draco knew the man's brilliance when it came to the subject of potions. He could only imagine what form of torture he'd be subjected to with the ingestion of those potions and his weak struggles did nothing to loosen Severus' steady grip.
Releasing Harry's shoulder, Lothair began the walk forward toward the Head table. As they moved, Harry could feel every pair of eyes in the place following them. He scanned the Gryffindor table for any missing faces but found them all sitting there. Moving to the next table he did the same thing until he reached the Slytherin table. They, too, were all in attendance. As they walked by Pansy was batting her eyelashes at Draco and offering him a playful wink, which sent a shock of annoyance through him so strong that he nearly picked up one of the Goblets and threw it at her. A hand at the small of his back pushed him forward before he could fulfill that desire.
"Get him into the kitchen," Lothair ordered, moving aside so Draco could pass him. Only moments later, Gwynn appeared, leading a group of six students behind her, Akkar following up behind them. "Report."
His eyes lifted, narrowing as recognition registered. Potter. Even with the smoother tone, Draco would know that voice anywhere. How many times had he heard it? How many times had it incited his anger? Already that cord of irritation was threatening to wrap around him, joining and fusing with the anger already boiling within him. The last person he wanted to see was Potter, but his steps led me on, closer and closer.
For a moment there was nothing but a thick silence, Lothair meeting the eyes of both Soren and Ilaria respectively. Ilaria nodded immediately, something in her stance told him that she already knew of what Lothair was referring to. Perhaps it had started before they had arrived or perhaps she simply could read the other Elves far better than Harry could. He barely knew them after all. Lothair for his part held out longer than his female counterpart. After a long moment of silence he nodded as well, an impatient sigh slipping from his lips. He didn't like being interrupted. "Very well, then."
Harry dared a glance to Gabriel to see his nod of acceptance. "Right, well, anything further questions can be directed to Soren." Frankly, he was pretty sure the Elf beside him was more qualified to deal with the entire thing. Pushing back the chair, he stood. "Excuse me." Before anyone could say anything else, he moved to the door and disappeared out of it, leaving the rest of them to stare at the spot he'd just vacated.
Soren nodded, hiding his smile as he turned. With Harry's resolve, he was sure that no matter how rocky the next few weeks were, they'd all pull through. He was certain that this was part of the overall plan. Harry could use an equal, someone to strive to do better for, someone who could push him forward more than any of the High Lords could. More importantly, he needed a connection to his old life. Harry would never fit into his role if he couldn't combine the two parts of himself into a coherent single. This mortal, no matter who or what role he had played in the past, would prove to play the most significant role yet.
"Creatures of the Earth, made from the very elements of Mother Nature," Soren continued, glad that Harry seemed to be piecing together what he was saying. If he could understand the nature of the world around him than everything else would come easily. "We, to an extent, represent Her. We have our own souls and our own will, but we are her children and everything that is created from her carries with it a sense of her. A signature, if you will. Magic is that signature."
Harry and Draco continued to glare at each other but nodded all the same.
The look on her face said he was clearly missing something. "You should probably go and talk to McGonagall."
"What did you see?"
Draco cast a glance back to Harry's prone form. Saeya had taken up a spot at the end of the table to keep watch, which didn't really put him at ease. Regardless, he turned and followed Lothair back out into the main room. In the middle of the room stood the rest of the group, Elves surrounding them. All of them were pale-faced and tears were streaming down Granger's face. When she spotted Draco, she took a step forward but halted when Gwynn lifted her sword and held her in place.
"YOU'RE DOING WHAT?"
This time Lothair's eyes narrowed further. "It can be arranged," he finally nodded, a part of his mind immediately shifting to the individual he would ask for such things, "but not until you explain exactly what it is you're planning."
"Oh," Harry paused, flushing slightly. The colour stained his cheeks softly as his eyes remained hidden behind the fringe of his hair. What was he suppose to say? That they hated each other? He highly doubted she was going to appreciate the fact that he was binding himself to an enemy rather than a friend. "Well, we go to the same school. He's a Slytherin and I'm Gryffindor, rival houses and all that. He plays Quidditch, like I do. Same position and everything. He's a decent player, but he'd be better if he focused more on finding the snitch than showing me up." He grinned at that, shifting to pull his feet up onto the bottom rung of the fence he was sitting on. He had to admit that he rather liked the way they tried to outdo each other. It made the win all the better if he'd had to earn it. "He's a pureblood, of course, and he takes great pleasure in making sure everyone knows it."
At the insistence in Harry's voice, Soren's attention finally returned to him. "I apologize, my Lord, but I'm afraid the tour will have to be put on hold for the moment. This is your home so you are free to go where you will. One of us will locate you once the meeting has adjourned."
His thoughts drifted to the blonde again as Blaise went about preparing and adding the ingredients at the appropriate times, leaving Harry to continuously stir the potion as was instructed. They were definitely bonded, but he wondered if he had altered it during the blood transfusion. He'd done his best to focus on making the connection equal but he'd been so worried about Draco dying that perhaps it had shifted. Draco didn't seem to have the same sort of response to the bond as he did. Either that, or he was much better at hiding it than Harry was. Though, given the strength of some of the backlashes, he had a hard time believing that the blonde was capable of that.
"I wasn't playing house! We were just training!" he exclaimed, trying to calm Draco down. The accusation that he'd ruined Draco's life had hit him hard, leaving him with a strange numbness spreading through him. It really shouldn't have bothered him. He knew Draco was going to be angry. He knew the other man wasn't going to like having the choice taken from him. It had been Harry's decision and he'd willing robbed the other man of the choice. He deserved the anger, which was the very reason that he didn't raise a hand to prevent the second punch Draco landed.
Much to Harry's surprise, the group training sessions helped both Harry's skill and his confidence. Not only was he trying harder in order to prevent looking like a fool; Harry was also able to see that perfection wasn't expected. It was expected that each individual learn from his or her mistakes. If you were caught with your guard down it could be guaranteed that it wouldn't happen a second time. Of course, as much as Harry was learning from these sessions, they did have their downfalls. He could only accomplish so much with independent study. It simply wasn't the same as working with a sparing partner and that was where the problem lay. Harry had gone through three different partners and he was still faced with the same problem. Even though they were quite competent, none of the fifteen seemed to be willing to be the one to throw the Dark Prince to the ground or get their weapon beneath his defenses.
Of course, with the way Ron was shovelling food into his mouth, it was hard to tell he was anything but devastatingly hungry. Having decided that he wasn't going to tell the redhead about the piece of chicken stuck in his teeth, Harry's eyes shifted across the hall to the familiar head of blonde hair.
"You two can fight with elemental magic, right?"
"Perfect," Pansy snarked, arms crossed, "He's finally lost it."
"Ha!"
Harry ignored her, eyes closed and listening. There was something wrong, he could feel it. He just couldn't pinpoint it. His eyes snapped open when there was a sudden point of pressure before it was released directly at them. Reaching out, he shoved Draco back as whatever it was hit him square in the chest.
"Seriously, Harry!" Ron whispered, loudly, "Where the hell have you been. Dumbledore gets some crazy note about Elves, you disappear for weeks, and now suddenly you're back with a bloody make-over!"
"I'll partner with him." She repeated amongst the disapproving murmur of their fellow classmates. It was clear that they did not think it appropriate that she willingly offer to play the role, which only added to Harry's annoyance. He might be royalty but he still needed to learn. In this aspect he was just like everyone else and he really wished the majority of the group would accept the idea.
"You need to stay in bed," Lothair's voice snapped Harry's attention from the prone form on the other bed as he frowned down at the strong grip that now held his arm. "Strict orders, I'm afraid."
"Surely they do not need all three of us."
Travelling through the Manor certainly wasn't as easy as one would have thought. Not even Hogwarts contained so many twisting corridors. It didn't help that the landscape of one corridor very rarely changed as he moved to another. After only fifteen minutes he had completely lost all of his bearings and now had no hope of finding his way back to he entrance hall. Soren had said that one of the High Lords would find him when their meeting had been complete and Harry just hoped they could keep their word. If not it was going to be a long time before he saw any one familiar.
Harry frowned at that. "Sorry?"
Despite the fact that his plate was full of food that he'd placed there himself, he had barely touched it. Instead, Hermione kept shooting him sympathetic looks every time he viciously stabbed a piece of food. Of course, he couldn't exactly tell them that the giant ice ferret was going to still play Quidditch despite the advantage while he, himself, had to suffer in the stands. They simply thought his discontent was due to not being allowed to play.
There was a surge of confusion that came up and wrapped itself around Harry's irritation. Realizing too late that the confusion wasn't coming from him, Harry pulled back quickly, releasing the hold he hadn't realized he'd had on the other Elf. He'd influenced Ehlark. The look of surprise and slight horror that flickered across his face was enough to tell Harry that he had hit the mark.
"I guess we'll figure it out soon enough," he sighed, reaching for a piece of chicken. Now that they'd arrived and he was once again surrounded by the familiar feel of the castle, he had realized just how hungry he actually was. "We always do."
Reaching the second floor, they came to a stop outside of the girl's lavatory and Draco snorted. "Your bright idea is the girl's toilet?"
True to his previous commitment, Harry had followed through on his promise to learn what was expected of him. He wasn't simply a new member of the realm. His responsibilities would far exceed that title. The moment it was presented to him, Harry had done everything in his power to keep up with the lessons he was being given. It seemed as though every member of Jade Manor was aware of the limited amount of time set aside for those lessons and the halls were often filled with whispered concerns or, on rare occasions, quiet words of encouragement. The tension that seemed to linger around his presence was something that he certainly didn't enjoy, however, it was something that he was learning to accept. Only once he had proven himself as competent would the tension begin to fade. Unfortunately, he wasn't quite ready to do that.
Potter was no Prince, of that he was certain. Potter was a stain on Draco's very existence; a plague. Cool grey eyes remained narrowed as he watched the two interact, his presence going by unnoticed in the long shadow of the entrance way.
Glowering at her lack of answer, he snapped. "Why do we need a sword? Isn't there a million of them in the armory?"
Gwynn was hard pressed to imagine any of the High Lords fawning over anyone, let alone some recently turned mortal. The thought would have been entertaining had it not been the serious look on Harry's face. His insecurities were surprising. She had assumed that he'd moved past it, but perhaps all he had done was hide it within himself. She watched him for a moment before she rolled her eyes, reached out, and smacked him upside the head.
a student!" she shot back indignantly. "Elves mature more slowly than humans given the fact that our lives as longer lived. We're not even considered mature until one hundred twenty four."
She supposed that wasn't all that crazy of an idea. "Without Harry what reason does Voldemort have to spy on the Order?" she countered, raising an eyebrow. She knew the answer she was going to get and went back to her essay when Ron confirmed that he had no idea. "Harry's coming back. Let's just wait and talk to him ourselves."
Draco began inching away again as the wolves growled and barked at each other. Whatever they were communicating about was lost on him. Not only did he have no knowledge of how to read the inflation or deflation in the yips and barks, he was much more concerned with keeping himself alive. At least if he reached the water he could allow the river to carry him downstream, which would allow for his scent to be lost in the water and, hopefully, allow him to slip away.
With a hesitant look to Soren as he rolled up his sleeve, Harry climbed up onto the spot beside Draco. As he'd assumed, the spot was not nearly as large as he'd been hoping. As he settled back against the pillow, his left shoulder was flush against Draco's. With the changes his inheritance had created in him, Harry noticed that rather the two of them were now roughly the same size. Before Draco had towered over Harry's smaller stature and now the only difference between them was the slightly wider set to Harry's shoulders. As he settled a part of him hoped that Draco's appearance wouldn't change too much. He didn't want to go back to being inferior. He liked the idea that they could be equals both mentally and physically.
"Honestly, Draco, I thought you would never show up," she complained, "Do you know how boring it's been around here without you? I had to keep giving those two something to do."
"Tell me exactly what happened," he demanded, moving to examine Harry.
All eyes in the room seemed to shift as one to land of the blond sitting at the end of the table, silver eyes flashing for a moment before settling into bored acceptance. "He's an idiot. You'll get used to it."
