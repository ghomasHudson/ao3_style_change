"You know who this is?" Ron said, gesturing. "It's Harry sodding Potter; you won't give Harry Potter your chair, after what he's sacrificed for us?"
"What the fuck do you think you know about my arm, Malfoy?" Anger was so much more comfortable than shame.
Ron and Hermione, it turned out, had been only half-right. The semester was flying by, but Harry did, in fact, have time to miss them, and he went into disproportionate agonies when they sent him an owl with a photograph of Rosie displaying a brand-new bottom tooth. He made the trek all the way to the Herbology greenhouse to find Neville and show him.
"Here," Harry said, and flicked his wand to dry Malfoy from head to toe, adding in a little warming charm at the end. Instead of thanking him, Malfoy stared as if he'd just turned a backflip.
"Here we go, love," Ron said, reaching out for his daughter. He gripped her beneath her armpits and tugged, then frowned. Tugged again. She wouldn't budge. "Harry, did you put a Sticking charm on my child?"
“Well,” said Kevari cheerfully, “now we know what happens when you flout all advice and completely overextend yourself. In bad weather, no less, which hasn’t helped matters at all.”
Neville gave him a slightly misty look, and Harry, flushing, tried to distract him by adding, “I’m more like Mad-Eye every day, aren’t I? Paranoid, crippled, half-barmy…”
“Hi all,” he said, forcing a smile as he lowered himself painstakingly down behind his desk. “Cold, isn’t it?”
Naturally, Harry regretted the argument as soon as he’d gotten a decent night’s sleep, but he did not know how to apologize. He felt that in order to make a real apology he’d have to explain what had gotten him so riled-up in the first place, which would mean explaining his feelings, which would mean admitting to Draco that he was falling for him.
She didn't blink, or ask why, or seem to mind at all. "Nah, no problem, it was just cosmetic, anyway. Okay so yeah I think it'll take about a week? You caught me at a good time, pre-Christmas season. In terms of payment, could I very daringly suggest a trade? Mona's gonna be back in late November, just in time for her birthday, and if you come over for dinner and show her your wand I will win the biggest Wife of the Year trophy – no, I’ll win Wife of Life!"
Panic bubbled up in his throat. The smell hit him like a curse -- damp cement, must, mildew, and for a moment he was flung back in time nearly two years, to another basement in another seemingly-normal home. He could feel the damp, dirty floor against his bare skin again, his arms and legs chained to the ground, alone except the leering faces that loomed above him every few hours and brought with them unimaginable pain. First his hand, the curse wrapping around his fingers, his palm, his wrist as he screamed; then his shoulder, his hip, his knee, as if his joints were being chewed up by a mouth of fire, teeth of acid, before they were spat back out -- dissolved, destroyed, aflame. The sound of laughter, the smell of rot.
Harry had already been dreading what he had to ask next, and this comment didn’t help matters. “I’m going to need help up to the road,” he said stiffly, eyeing the grassy embankment. “It’s too slippery for me to manage on my own. Do you mind? I’m sorry.”
"I hate when you do that," Harry muttered to Ron, unLocking his knee so he could sit down, and trying not to groan as he bent it beneath him. But he couldn't stay mad, because Rosie had screeched at the sight of him and was reaching out with fat, freckled arms. "Hello, pet. Oh, Merlin, you've gotten even cuter, how's that possible?"
“Bugger off,” Ron muttered, and slunk after his wife, casting dark looks over his shoulder as the two of them vanished around the corner again.
Then again, neither would he have imagined he’d be clinging to Draco fucking Malfoy because a significant percentage of his limbs no longer quite functioned.
"Betsy," she said, taking his hand in a competent grip before turning to Draco and throwing her arms around him warmly. Harry gaped. He'd never seen Draco hugged before, and couldn't have said why the sight was so transfixing. Then Betsy pushed him away and held him at arms’ length. "I'm so happy to see you!"
“Aah,” Harry said, one truncated syllable of pain escaping before he managed to bite it back. “Not – aah – not that arm, please.”
The office was roomy and comfortable, with a red leather sofa, an enormous maple desk and ornately-carved empty bookshelves. It was supremely professorial, with plenty of space for Harry's imposter syndrome to begin dancing around in it. This was an office for a professor: Harry was not a professor. Harry was good at chasing down dark magic and putting dark wizards in prison, not
Harry felt a pang at this, both at the word “friendship” and at the way it made him feel to be spoken of in this manner, as if Harry Potter were a construction of himself but not him
“It’s a rare occurrence, for good reason. I get quite – high-spirited. There’s often singing involved.”
Kevari was already squeaking a medical bag out of his expandable pocket, which he set on the floor with a thump before rummaging around in it. He came up with a glass vial of a familiar rust-colored liquid and Harry groaned.
Harry nodded, and put his good hand on the arm of the chair. It really was miraculously uncomfortable, and his hip was stiff enough that rising was going to be a bit of a production. He held his breath and gave it his best shot, which failed him. Malfoy suddenly found his stack of parchments very interesting again. Red-faced, Harry gave it another go, and this time he managed to get all the way upright. The potion he'd taken at breakfast was beginning its slow fade, reminding him of his primary reason for visiting, and as he turned he looked closely at the brass lock on the door of the wooden cabinet.
“Last document this quill wrote,” Harry said, pushing glasses up his sweaty nose with the back of his wrist. The effort of difficult spellcasting while standing upright had taken a toll on him and his vision was blurring slightly. “Read it aloud for us, would you?”
If everything went smoothly, he didn’t add, but Negasi shrugged and nodded. Then, preparing to apparate, he grabbed Harry roughly by his bad arm.
"Cane's in the trunk," Harry said shortly. And there it would stay. Even apart from having been in the papers, the injuries to his leg were impossible to hide; all you had to do was watch him limp across a room. Lesser-known, however, and much easier to conceal, were the injuries to his arm on the same side. He had no grip or fine motor control to speak of anymore and his shoulder waged war if he tried to raise his arm above the waist, which essentially only left him with one free hand -- which he had no intention of filling with a cane. If a situation came up, as it was sure to, he wanted to be holding not a cane but his wand.
She narrowed her eyes at him, suddenly suspicious, and his heart lurched. “You are a Squib, aren’t you?” she demanded. “Not a Muggle?”
“Well.” Draco winced. “Merlin, this is embarrassing. Well, my first year at Hogwarts, I was – having rather a rough time – adjusting. I didn’t have friends, and the school was bringing back unpleasant memories. Plus, as you know, it was just a deadly amount of work that I wasn’t entirely prepared for. I was… depressed, I guess you could say.”
“What could top this?” Harry said, already engrossed with repeatedly popping his wand in and out of the handle.
The morbidity of the question put him on edge until he remembered something. Muggles had portable phones these days, didn’t they? Quite useful-seeming, actually – none of this wondering if someone had gotten your Patronus or not. “Yes,” Harry said. “My phone. It’s… dead.”
This was his favorite staircase because no one ever took it, something that had seemed wonderful just yesterday but now seemed like a possible nail in his coffin. Maybe no one would ever come by, maybe he'd never be able to move, maybe he'd be entombed here and eaten by rats.
It was Hanna, of course it was Hanna, because she was the absolute last person he wanted seeing him like this; Hanna, secretly his favorite student, beloved daughter of the friend and former colleague who'd found him in that terrible basement.
“Excellent,” said Roberts, rubbing his hands together. “I’ve got temporary Floo authorization for the Debs’ fireplace, so we can go straight there.”
"Yes are you kidding?" Betsy was holding it against her cheek now. "This is like the wand all wandmakers learn about in our first year of apprenticeship! Oh god I can't believe I'm holding the wand that dueled Voldemort, twin cores, phoenix against phoenix, I'm holding a piece of history! The things this holly wood has seen! Okay I'm almost done, sorry Harry, but meeting this wand is like meeting a fucking celebrity. Which, I guess
Harry cracked an eye, alarmed. “I can’t stay in bed for a week. I have a job. You know, the thing that makes me money so I can pay gits like you.”
"Potter," Malfoy said suddenly, with an odd energy. "Let me know if you -- if you need --" He seemed to run out of steam, and finished limply, "More information."
Harry muttered a spell and flicked his wand and the front door snapped open, and with another flick he’d sent Dougie’s unconscious body sailing through it and onto the front porch. Negasi said, “Oh, come on,” and Harry said regretfully, “Sorry, mate,” then sent his friend flying after Dougie’s floating body as he broke the Muffliato and jammed his wand back into his cane. The front door closed just as a tall blond woman came out from the kitchen, wearing an irritated expression and full ceremonial witch’s robes in a lurid shade of turquoise. She stopped when she saw Harry but, to his surprise, did not look terribly alarmed.
Harry crossed the room to the chair, too-aware of Malfoy's eyes on him, trying very hard not to limp more than he had to. The chair was extraordinarily low and aggressively uncomfortable and the moment he'd sat down, he knew he should get right back up, but it was too late to do so without looking very odd. All the cabinets, he noted, had what looked like the same style of lock, which was vaguely familiar. Maybe they'd used them in the auror department?
,” said in such tones, was not a real person – it was a myth, a celebrity. He, Harry, standing here in the flames, was real. He only wanted Draco to see that, to see
? Oh, Harry did not like the sound of that. But he smiled and nodded and turned towards the door, hearing her footsteps retreating up the stairs. Stars, he hoped Negasi had hidden Dougie somewhere other than the front porch, or this would all go a lot quicker than he was ready for. He took a deep breath and went through the door.
"Curious," said Malfoy at their 6pm meeting on Friday. He was slouched elegantly behind his desk, one ankle on his knee, showing off surprisingly bright orange socks. Even his socks looked expensive, somehow. "And it was the same time every day?"
In London he'd be out drinking right now with the other Aurors, recounting the day's adventures, comparing notes, maybe flirting a bit with whoever seemed interested. If he was in the right mood, he might even pick up a Muggle who'd never heard the name "Harry Potter" and have a nice, casual shag with someone who had no idea who he was, what he’d done, what he’d been through.
It should have been easy. Harry had a prescription, and all he had to do was give it to Malfoy, the Potions master, and he knew Malfoy would have to make it -- but the idea of this was abhorrent to him on nearly every level. For one thing, that was like giving Malfoy explicit permission to poison him. For another, although he wished he could claim otherwise, the truth was that he was embarrassed by the limitations of his body and didn't want to broadcast his vulnerabilities to someone who would no doubt take pleasure in them.
"Did you hear," Neville asked him over lunch the next day, "that Draco's been getting Howlers every morning? It's why he's never got any mail at breakfast, he has it delivered to his room so he doesn't scare the students."
"I've increased the wards around my office and the caretaker is providing all-night security to ensure nothing else is taken until we find the culprit," Malfoy said. "I don't think I need to explain how serious it is to imagine such ingredients in the hands of amateurs."
Malfoy stared at him, and then burst out laughing. It was so rare to see him laugh that Harry could never help laughing along with him when it happened. "Considering you've broken into this very office,” Malfoy said, “I assume you know that's true. Dark or light?"
Harry showed her and a slowly calming Ron the quick-release mechanism for his wand, and they stood around for a while oohing and aahing, until Harry saw Draco shivering out of the corner of his eye.
to touch him -- it was because he’d needed more hands-on care than he ever had in the past. There were the Healers at St. Mungo’s, of course, who’d had their hands on him night and day, poking, prodding, lifting, patting; and then when he’d stayed at Ron and Hermione’s for that month after he’d been released, his friends had constantly been helping him on and off the couch, helping him get dressed in the morning and undressed at night, letting him cling to them on the small, shuffling walks he’d used to take around the block. Even nowadays that he was as healed as he was ever going to be, he was forever taking peoples’ hands to get to his feet, or leaning on offered arms to get up stairs, or feeling people grab him if he stumbled.
There was a silence, then a boy in the back called, "Bravo, Professor!", and there was a brief but enthusiastic applause. Harry, heart thudding, lowered himself back behind the desk. Galen Parkinson sneered at him; Hanna Seid, and most of the rest of the class, beamed at him.
of the room – the door, too, was boarded up – but when he followed that footstepped path through the dust of the floor he found it led to a blank wall with a tiny, hand-lettered sign taped to the blank expanse:
And THANK YOU SO MUCH for all your kudos and comments, I am absolutely thrilled you are enjoying the story, thanks a million to those of you who've taken the time to tell me. I am way behind on answering comments (see: election) but I'll try to catch up this next chapter.
say that, wouldn't he. You didn't go around admitting to being a Death Eater anymore, not unless you were in the right circles. But he thought of the Howlers,
"This is a lot of pressure," Malfoy said, when they looked to him. "Not to mention perhaps more psychologically revealing than I'd bargained for. What if there's a sex dungeon in there?"
"Oh," Harry said. Had he not spoken aloud just now? "Yeah, sometimes. When I'm not really thinking about it."
"It eradicates pain completely, and I do mean completely, for about thirty minutes. Sufferers of chronic pain tend to like it quite a lot, but I advise you not to enjoy the experience any more than necessary, because if you take more than one dose between two full moons, you'll drop dead pretty much instantly. Understand?"
Distracted from pouring drinks, Malfoy crossed the room and deposited himself in the chair. He shifted a bit. Extended his legs. Put his arms on the armrest. "Why has no one ever told me?" he demanded. "This chair cost 200 Galleons!"
But finally, finally, he was done. It was supposed to be a light, sunshine yellow, but chartreuse would have to do. It smelled as his other potions had, anyway, which was a good sign, wasn't it? There was no time like the present to find out. He'd brought biscuits as a food-buffer, and before he'd even poured it into vials, he measured himself out a dose and drank it down, then quickly ate a biscuit.
"I did, too," Harry said. They'd reached the stairs to the platform with the faculty tables and Malfoy paused to wait as Harry took them slowly. Aside from the hangover, he'd really been feeling all right that morning, and so it was a shock when, out of nowhere, his knee buckled out from under him. He reached frantically for something, anything, but there was no railing to grip and nothing to hold onto and it was happening, the thing he'd been dreading since day one, he was going to hit the ground in front of all his students and they'd never be able to look at him again without seeing him flat on the ground, and –
He heard rather than saw the enormous crash of the lamp and of Craig’s body hitting the floor, because he was too busy trying not to get strangled by Phil, who’d thrown his meaty hands around Harry’s neck and was avidly squeezing. Harry, unable to get enough breath for a spell, jabbed him in the eye with his wand, and when he howled, grip faltering, Harry gasped “Stupefy!”
Harry ran a hand through his hair, utterly flummoxed. "I don't know. I don't expect so. I use it because I've trouble with the stairs."
The potion took exactly two minutes to kick in, and Harry gave himself those two minutes to lie back on the bed and stare up at the canopy. It was surreal being here again, and even more surreal to think that at some point, it would be normal. How long would that take? A week? A month? A year, if he didn't get canned before then?
He vanished into the crowd and Harry took a moment to enjoy the scene. It was the first time in months that he wasn't outnumbered twenty to one by adolescents, and though he did spot a few of his students perched at the mismatched tables, it was a pleasure to be surrounded by grown-ups. He wouldn't have said no to a bit more eye candy, but Hogsmeade was a village of families, and young single wizards and witches made up a low percentage of the demographic. Actually, the bloke who'd given up his chair hadn't been half bad, but he'd gone off elsewhere. A shame; Harry longed for just five minutes of the kind of eye contact he never got at Hogwarts, the glance across the room, the mutual sizing-up, the fizzy feeling of possibility even if it never amounted to anything. Harry loved to flirt and the weight of his flirtation deprivation was only just now becoming clear to him.
Dishes appeared across the tables and Harry scowled at them. Too little, too late; where were all these sausages before his potion had started wearing off? But food was food, and he was hungry, and those potatoes looked excellent.
"Don't splinch me," Harry said, pronouncing his words very carefully lest he slur them. "I'm damaged enough without you taking off my eyebrow."
"Fine, take your time," Harry said. "I've only got homework to grade, classes to teach, stairs to conquer." Whoops, now it was his turn to flush. He hadn't meant to say that last part.
"Hanna," he said. "Stay back. Stay back, please." He tried to keep his voice calm. He didn't want to alarm her.
“Get out,” Harry said to Negasi. “If someone’s going to find us they should only find one of us, go outside and wait for the aurors.”
“Well – why not? As you said earlier, we do have to eat. Is there – is there anywhere you particularly like?” Now that he’d proposed the idea, Harry was starting to get nervous. Walking around Hogsmeade together was one thing, but sitting alone at a restaurant? That felt like something else entirely.
"Boo," said Malfoy. He was, to Harry's surprise, grinning outright -- perhaps the first real smile Harry'd seen on him. "I'm going to swim a few laps. Will you -- will you be all right?"
“It’s fine,” Harry said, though his shoulder was pulsing agony through his neck. He put his bad hand safely away into his pocket where no one would be tempted to yank on it and offered Negasi the other arm, cane dangling from his hand.
When they entered her shop they found Betsy busy with a customer, a very small mustached man who was speaking excitedly about his idea for a self-sorting bookshelf, but she waved at them with great enthusiasm and pointed them towards the back room. Harry followed Draco to the little room they’d been in before, relieved to have a moment’s sit-down before anything else. He lowered himself down onto the couch and bit back a groan of relief at getting off his feet, then dug into his pocket for a pain potion and downed it quickly, not meeting Draco’s gaze. He didn’t want to answer questions about how he was feeling, he just wanted to feel better. Draco didn’t say anything, bless him, and for a minute or two Harry sat back, eyes closed, waiting for his body to stop shouting at him, listening to the distant murmur of Besty and her customer and the soft sound of Draco moving around the room as the pain ebbed away.
Everyone was looking at Harry, smiling benevolently, and he would've been embarrassed about this attention but he was too delighted. No more stairs! Maybe he wouldn't even need to brew any more potion!
Harry fit the key in the lock and pushed the door open, blinking at the golden evening light that streamed through the large windows.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, that little diamond nose stud flashing, the world's tiniest, sexiest distraction. "It’s not actually the worst idea I've ever heard. I'll be curious to see how it works."
The second years were equally pleasant, but once he got to the third years things started getting tricky. He could smell the adolescence on them as soon as they entered the room, and the striations between the houses were more apparent, Gryffindors clustering with Gryffindors, Slytherins with Slytherins. They also seemed much more curious about him than he would have preferred.
Harry had known this on some level, but it was strangely painful to hear it admitted out loud. Malfoy still hadn't turned -- he was addressing the lake in front of him.
Harry swallowed. This evidence that Malfoy had been thinking of him was almost too much to bear right now. “That doesn’t tell us much,” Harry said gruffly. “Keep looking. I’m going to try something else.”
Harry began to make his careful way forward, relishing the feeling of the fresh water closing around his ankles, his shins, his aching knee, his thighs. Malfoy went in again with him, some meters away, and a prickle on the back of his neck caused Harry to glance his way. They were both waist-deep in the blue water, and --
The answer, it turned out was yes, he could stand – kind of. It took both Kevari and Draco to get him to his feet, but once he was up he found he could walk all right, though it hurt even through the strong pain potion. He took a slow, limping turn around the living room, trying to limber up, grip tight on his cane and one eye squinted shut so he didn’t get dizzy from the Barley-thorn. He studiously did not reflect on the fact that his resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody must be in even greater effect than usual.
Neville had raised the Floo idea with McGonagall, who'd brought it to the Hogwarts board, who'd brought it to the Regulation of Floo Networks, who'd promised to have an answer by the end of the second week, which meant for now, Harry was stuck running all over the castle and climbing so many stairs that when he demonstrated the Boggart lesson, his own showed up as a staircase.
“Okay so yeah just enjoy it and let me know if there’s anything that needs tweaking or fixing and futzing!” Betsy kissed them both and gave Draco an extra-long squeeze. “Mona says hello,” she said. “You should owl her, she’s bored shitless out there in the North American rain.”
“Hi, Healer Kevari,” said Harry, who was more than familiar with the man. Kevari had been his attending Healer at St. Mungo’s.
“No,” Harry said, “but thanks, really, Ron. One of my old colleagues – you remember Negasi? – he’ll meet me there, and two others should be headed to Goyle’s family home right now. Maybe it’s overkill, but again, I’d rather be overprepared than under.”
He ended up in a thestral-pulled carriage with two students -- a third-year named Griggs who'd been hit with a vertigo charm and couldn't stay upright but refused to miss the first Hogsmeade weekend, and a seventh year named Keisha who had ambitions to being an Auror and had clearly only been pretending to feel poorly so she could have a chance to pepper Harry with questions outside of school hours. He'd have minded more if the canny maneuver hadn't put him somewhat in mind of himself as a teenager.
It was almost the end of October, and the weather, which had been lovely and crisp, took a sudden dismal turn. It rained for an entire weekend straight, a cold, relentless rain that churned the grounds to pure mud and made the old stone castle feel damp and chilled no matter how many roaring fires one lit. Harry piled logs in the hearth and blankets on his bed but still he woke up wrecked, his hip and knee grinding like rusted hinges and his hand so stiff he couldn’t uncurl his fingers. His shoulder, which was usually the least of his worries, sent shooting pains through his back and neck every time he tried to move it, and pulling on his robes was sheer torture. He spent that whole miserable weekend alternating between hot baths and sitting in a chair pulled as close to the fire as he could manage without burning himself, trying to grade essays or work on his textbook but really just counting down the minutes until he could drink another potion.
"Your dad's an excellent auror," he said, trying to stay in the moment, trying not to slip back into that basement. "And Galen -- Defense Against the Dark Arts is, above all, about staying alive. I'm here, aren't I? I count that as a win."
Class had just ended, and Silvia Grupnik, Slytherin sixth-year, stood before him clutching her textbook. Behind her, two other girls waited.
He’d used to be so much better about intuiting these things. It did not help that most of his physical contact over the last year and a half had been with people trying to help him. He’d been touched a
“Come on, then, let’s search the house,” Harry said, resigned, and pushed himself away from the wall, staggering briefly as he tried to get his leg working well enough to walk again.
"It'd have been better if we were, oh, seventy year-olds," Harry said, grinning. "But yeah, it'll do."
"Exactly, good. And does anyone know the difference between the Leg-Locker Curse and the one I've got going now?"
After all these years, Harry knew when Ron was joking, and he saw now that Ron was only teasing, not realizing that he was edging towards an uncomfortable truth. "Yeah," Harry said. "I'm worried I might've told you about me and McGonagall."
“Think we’re – oh.” Malfoy actually stumbled, and for once it was Harry who had to reach out and steady him. “Oh.
,” Neville said, stopping so short that Harry nearly tripped over him. “That’s a terrible thing to say about yourself.”
“I’m not a myth,” Harry said. “I’m a person. And I want you…" He tried to be honest. "I want you, of all people, to see that person.”
Hurt, unmistakable, flickered across Draco’s face, and Harry felt a surge of impotent regret. That wasn’t what he really meant at all. What he meant was: I’m not your patient, I’m your friend. Or: I’m not your patient, I’m a grown man who
"Yes," Hermione said, "but it's one of the trickiest charms to get right at the best of times, and I can't even nonverbal a simple Lumos charm. I just love watching you do it, it's like going to a show."
“No,” Harry said, trying to smooth out his expression. “Only hungry, all of a sudden.” He managed a smile. “Fancy an appetizer?”
Gingerly, he took his left hand from his pocket so he could lay it across his left knee. He pressed the palm into the aching joint, trying to work out some of the tension, but stopped at the answering flicker of pain in his shoulder. Thanks to Chloé's dad. How had he not known the man had children?
“I can’t blame him,” Draco said quietly. “Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and push myself off a tower.”
“Why’s it have to be you that goes? Hermione’s in a court session for another hour and a half, but I can Floo her when she’s done and she’ll send –”
Draco glanced up from the menu and to Harry’s surprise, he looked grim. “It’s not the most flattering story. Not flattering to me, anyway – Betsy comes off looking lovely as ever.”
"Stop," he said, spluttering and wet, "Stop, I'm fine, no, don't call for help, please, I just got tired."
There, a few smiles. Merlin, they were young, and innocent, their eleven year-old faces as unformed as puppies. He sat at his desk, glancing at the parchment in his hand.
“I’m frightfully sorry to bother you. But I’ve run out of petrol down over that hill and I was wondering if I could use your phone to have a mate come and get me.”
"Harry," Malfoy said, and suddenly his hand was on Harry's locked and outstretched knee, his touch featherlight, so brief Harry thought he might've imagined it. Startled, Harry looked up. Those blue, blue eyes were fixed on his. "I know you have no reason to trust me," Malfoy said. "But I swear -- I swear that right now, I'm only trying to help you. I'm not interested in hurting you any further."
"Oh," said Malfoy. "Yes, I mean, I -- yes, it's interesting. I'll owl Betsy and let her know. How's 2pm?"
“You’ve had a rough weekend,” Neville said, “will you be all right to –” He visibly stopped himself and changed tack. “Take some extra pain potion with you,” he said instead.
Harry smiled weakly and Neville, on his other side, said, "Good job!", in the encouraging tones one might use for a child's indecipherable stick figure drawing.
"Hullo, Potter," he said -- same old drawl, but an octave or so deeper. It was amazing the difference an octave could make.
Harry stepped back fully into the flames. “Harry Potter’s bedroom,” he said loudly, and Draco’s face – tight and expressionless – swirled into nothing.
"Did he?" Harry found himself oddly pleased by this. Then he said, "Hanna? Would you -- would you mind teaching me the charm for those bubbles?"
The waiter was by their table suddenly, a quill and parchment hovering in the air next to him as he stood above them, hands politely behind his back. “Gentlemen? May I start you off with a beverage?”
"Hmm?" Harry said, idly attempting to saw a piece of rather tough steak with the edge of his fork. It had turned out to be quite difficult to eat foods that needed cutting if you only had working hand.
“Professor Longbottom!” she said, clearly thrilled to see him. “We’ve got a new baby, come and look!”
“It is not,” Gregory growled, “It’s –” and okay, Harry had seen enough to call this. His wand was out and he was shouting “Expelliarmus!” before Gregory had finished saying “—Harry Potter,” but Gregory’s wand was drawn and he was shouting a spell, too, and jets of light leaped out at the same time. Harry’s spell found its mark first, knocking Gregory’s wand from his hand, and he had a moment of hope before Gregory’s spell hit. It knocked him across the room, his back slamming against the wall, candles guttering in his wake, and only the small size of the room saved him from a concussion as his head thwacked concrete. He’d only been forced back about five feet, not enough momentum to do any real damage, but Harry was damaged already and the pain was so great that black began to creep into the edges of his vision. He was still holding his wand, though, and he had managed to keep his feet under him, and that was all that mattered.
Harry forced himself to look away, his heart still beating hard, his jaw tight. A picture was coming together in his mind and it was not a pleasant one. He took a deep breath and a big risk. “What’s the first spell you’d cast?” he asked Abigail. “If you got magic?”
It was warm inside, blessedly so, and he caught the faint, seductive scent of a wood fire; a smell that made his stiff joints cry out for heat.
Harry’s heart stopped. He took a shocked, stumbling step, and at his side Draco surged forward in a cloud of righteous anger, snarling “On what
"Looks like we're colleagues," Malfoy said. "For now." He flashed white teeth and Harry flashed his temper.
"Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor." Then, seeing the Gryffindors’ smug smiles and thinking of Hermione's admonishing face, he added, "Er, and ten points to Slytherin."
Now Harry was staring, because the braid had revealed Betsy's ears, which were not like any ears Harry had seen before. They were thin and long and very pointed. He saw Draco notice him noticing them, and quickly looked away as they were ushered out of the shop. He barely had time to babble a thank-you and be bone-crushingly hugged goodbye before they were on the street again, rain misting in Draco's hair.
“I didn’t mean give him physio tips,” said Betsy, thwapping Draco on the arm. “I just want to know if it’s the right size or if I need to lengthen it or what!”
"Snuck past her while she was watering her jade plant," Hanna said, looking him up and down. "You look much better than last time I saw you."
By the time Harry made it down the muddy road to the Debs’ porch, his borrowed pink fleece jacket was the only thing standing between him and complete saturation. The rest of him – shoes, pants, glasses – were soaked with a light but fast-falling rain. The only bright spot was that his hair, which normally had a habit of standing somewhat upright, was heavy enough with water that it was easy to brush down across his forehead to hide his telltale scar.
In his third year class, a very loud boy named Callum said, "Professor, I'm Muggle-born, and I came out with one leg shorter than the other."
As if on cue, Harry’s traitorous knee gave out. But it was only briefly, and Harry caught himself on his cane, giving himself a moment to test the joint before putting the barest amount of weight back on it. He wanted to Lock it, and would have, except Kevari had just warned him off the practice and he was still back there, watching everything, an infuriatingly skeptical expression on his little old face. Roberts, thank Merlin, didn’t seem to have noticed.
Maybe he should cry? Would he feel better if he cried? He wanted to, but it would probably hurt, so better just focus on his breathing, focus on believing that the pain would eventually ebb, the sick throb of the curses would eventually recede, eventually he'd be able to get up, not now, but eventually, soon, any minute.
"Good, yeah," Neville gulped, and turned back to his food. Harry would feel guilty later but for now he just felt tired. Tired of everything but especially of himself.
"Sorry I didn't think of it earlier," Neville said, releasing Harry as they reached the top of the stairs.
To his surprise, she raised it to her nose and closed her eyes. A moment later, they flew open, huge and clear. She was staring at Harry. "Phoenix?"
Harry looked down at himself. "It's a -- erm, a mixture of a ceramics charm for sculpting bowls, a landscaping charm for trimming topiary, and a bit of snow-plowing."
“I’m getting to the embarrassing part,” Draco said. “I’m just setting the emotional stage so you’ll understand what happens next.”
But Harry didn’t answer. He was grappling with the sight of the hallway, wooden-walled and candle-sconced, the scent of fire and magic and coffee permeating every corner, familiar sounds coming from behind familiar doors: little bangs, big rattles, someone yelling, someone laughing. The Auror department, where he’d come every day for nearly ten years, longer even than he’d been at Hogwarts; where he’d made a place for himself, proven himself over and over, risen through the ranks, had a second coming-of-age – turned into a grownup.
He cleared his throat. "That makes me feel --" he started. "I mean, I -- good. That you've -- changed your mind." If he really had, if all this were true.
Harry sighed. They were coming up to the greenhouse, now, and the ground was growing muddier beneath their feet from water runoff – muddier, and much slipperier, harder to manage even with the cane.
“This isn’t a problem,” Neville said. “It’s just a – a thing that is. And anyway, Draco’s not a Healer anymore.”
It was humiliating, letting Negasi see how difficult it was for him to climb such a short distance, but Harry tried very hard to ignore his own shame in favor of focusing on keeping his footing on the muddy ground. Negasi was solid at his side, easily holding them both steady when Harry slipped and nearly went down, and it didn’t take long for them to reach the firm flat expanse of the country road. Harry tried to step away, but Negasi held him for a moment longer, looking down at him, his normally cheerful brown eyes suddenly very intent.
"Keep going -- slowly! Yes, it's true, though we're only talking one or two students a year. Just because these types of -- of maladies -- are rare in the wizarding world does not mean that they don't occur."
"We must all be on the lookout," McGonagall said. "Double-check your own locks and wards as soon as you're able, and make certain that any valuable or potent equipment is well-hidden. The prefects will be going through the common rooms and bedrooms this evening to see if we can recover any of these stolen items. Now, third announcement: shall we allow armadillos as student pets? Discuss."
"She's identical to you when you were a baby, Georgie," Hermione said, and there was a brief silence, everyone thinking of and grieving the other person who'd been identical to George. Hermione let out a loud sniffle. "Let's have another, Ron, do let's."
This news was met with confused silence, and Harry took the opportunity to launch into the lesson. For the first time, Chloé Barnes raised her hand to very quietly answer one of his questions, and while it wasn't much, it felt like progress.
"Oh," he said. He looked around, as if he'd found himself somewhere unexpected. "I didn't -- no one's ever here."
He awoke a minute later to find all his students clustered around him, someone's hand on his shoulder, someone else yelling for help, someone else tossing water on him.
“You’ll go see Draco straightaway, though, won’t you?” implored Hermione. “You won’t let your history together get in the way of your healing?”
"So: emergency use only, don't enjoy it too much, move very carefully. If you do not trust me and choose not to take the potion, I can levitate you up the stairs instead, but I imagine that scenario isn't ideal for you, either, and would probably hurt quite a lot. Or --" Malfoy took a deep breath. "Or I can go get Longbottom and he can deal with you. Take a moment and decide."
“We’ll not get anywhere with that mudblood Granger in charge,” huffed the tall pale man. “No, if we want something done, we’ll have to do it alone. My eye’s on Narcissa, for myself.”
“Better,” Draco said. “And you’ll want to keep it perfectly in line with the ankle on your bad leg, don’t –”
Neville put on a record of a Muggle band from the 70s with a soulful female vocalist and Malfoy found a deck of cards. They bet drinks instead of galleons, and rather quickly, Harry was rather drunk. Twice in a week! Someone, hold him back! After several hands of cards, Malfoy and Neville transitioned to the billiards table and Harry sat back in an armchair, drinking another Malfoy original cocktail and planning to watch them play.
"Absolutely not, we're going to the hospital wing. We only have eighteen minutes left until this wears off, and we need to be somewhere we can keep an eye on you when it does."
"That isn't the point," Malfoy said furiously. "The point is, you need to take better care of yourself."
Harry had a vision of himself, suddenly, as Kreacher -- Kreacher as he'd once been, sneaking around in plain sight as if no one could see him, muttering obscenities and insults as if no one could hear him. He, Harry, was no better than a mad old house elf, thinking he was being so subtle, so secretive, when really he was broadcasting loud and clear to anyone around him,
Harry would have liked to have left the table right then and gone up into his own chambers where he could be frustrated and exhausted in peace – but leaving would cause a scene, and a scene would engender even more questions and staring and fussing, so he ate the bread quietly and managed enough dinner that Neville couldn’t complain and then, trying very hard to smile and seem perfectly normal, he pushed back from the table and said goodnight.
Malfoy was waiting for him under the awning of the tea shop next door, looking unnervingly young and hip in a pair of extremely well-fitting jeans, a black waterproof bomber jacket, and a bright orange watchcap. Harry was so used to seeing him in sweeping, expensive robes that it was odd to see him looking not like a regal professor, but like the thirty year-old man who had at some point decided to get his nose pierced. Harry felt glad that he himself had worn a little piece of his life-outside-Hogwarts life, too -- black jeans and a green wool coat several people had told him brought out his eyes. The effect was somewhat ruined, he feared, by his jolting gait.
"I wouldn't claim to know anything -- except that it's clearly been injured, and you clearly don't want anyone noticing."
The barkeep stopped shouting and glared up mulishly instead. He looked ridiculous lying rigid on the floor with his head still wriggling this way and that, but Harry didn’t have much sense of humor at the moment and couldn’t appreciate the absurdity.
"Fine, yes. Yes, you're right. Merlin's tangled beard, you know I actually thought I was subtle before I met you?"
Harry laughed weakly and Neville managed a tremulous smile. "They're fastracking the inter-castle Floo network," Neville said. "Should be ready by next week. The Daily Prophet wrote an absolutely scathing article, it --"
Although he had a sinking fear that Hermione was correct and Hogwarts would be no easier. All his fond memories of the place had recently turned into memories of how many bloody staircases there were.
“Glad we’re in agreement,” Malfoy said. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, back to studying for you – and Franny, you’ll want to turn that diagram the other way round. Remember what I said the other day? Purple on top –”
Malfoy's next batch of potions put Harry into a sixty-second nap at four-ten instead of four-twenty, but his students had grown used to it by now and it was at most a minor inconvenience. He'd been at Hogwarts a month already, September nearly gone, and he was settling into the rhythm of things -- the hectic schoolweek, and then the slow weekends spent grading papers, writing to Ron and Hermione, or going out to sit by the lake with a notebook and a jug of pumpkin juice.
On the landing of the fifth floor, waiting for Harry to catch his breath, Neville suddenly said, "Floo!"
Harry Potter looked around the messy living room of the Hogsmeade cottage where he'd spent so many of his nights over the past years, cataloguing everything he'd miss. There was the green velvet couch that had so sweetly cradled his head the nights he'd drunk too much to apparate home; there was the overstuffed armchair where he'd curled up on countless evenings, gossiping, joking, complaining about work; there, folded in the corner, was the cot he'd slept on for a month last year, when he'd first gotten out of St. Mungo's; and there, in the doorway, were Ron and Hermione, owners of the cottage, watching him with mingled looks of fondness and exasperation.
His shit knee buckled again as they were spat out into the Ministry Floo, but he managed to stay on his feet thanks to Draco’s firm grip, and it was the work of only a few seconds to regain his balance. Roberts and Negasi were waiting for them just outside the fireplace, and Negasi, who’d clearly seen him stumble, gave Harry a quick, worried smile as he limped into the hall.
A moment later, Chloé Barnes crept into his room and stood at the foot of his bed. She was so small, such a child, with enormous, watery eyes and a trembling mouth. She clutched a homemade get-well card in her hand, covered with flowers she'd clearly drawn herself.
Further observations were slow to come because he was too occupied with trying to pass out again, hoping to step right back into oblivion so he wouldn’t have to face the shrill screaming of his indignant body, but it was a no-go. He was conscious, and getting more conscious by the moment, unfortunately.
Ron had nobly agreed to be that evening's Appointed Apparator, so he switched to Butterbeer around dinnertime and was relatively sober by the time they were ready to go. He took his wife first, Hermione's arms twined around his neck as she sloppily attempted to kiss his nose, then came back for Harry, who'd been attempting to Lock his knee but kept misfiring.
Harry very nearly smiled. “We could go with an old standby,” he said. “I go round the front, you go round the back? My sneaking days are
"Sod his health," said Ron. "I want the gossip. What's it like working with Malfoy? Do the students loathe him? Have they made up any nasty rhymes about him?"
Maybe it was only morbid curiosity about his scars, maybe it was just the natural urge to compare one body to another, but Harry could have sworn that something in Malfoy's gaze, something about the way it lingered on his shoulders and dipped to his stomach was... appreciative. And that shouldn't make Harry feel so damn pleased, but it did.
If Malfoy had any reason to believe this was a lie, he showed no sign, just twisted off the cap and handed it back. The smell of blueberry pie grew stronger, sweeter, almost cloying, and Harry closed his eyes and downed the potion.
He and Ron did an awkward shuffle to exchange a one-armed hug, one of Ron’s arms busy holding a child and one of Harry’s arms busy being useless. Harry kissed the baby on her red-curled head and said morosely, "Goodbye, Rosie. Next time I see you, you’ll be enormous and I’ll have missed your whole precious childhood.”
Somebody kicked his bad hip. “Who the fuck told you we’d be here?” a gruff male voice demanded, but Harry couldn’t speak. He was panting, trying with every gasp to cling to consciousness. He could see Malfoy through the filmy haze of his vision, struggling wildly against the chains, all pretense at docility abandoned, and where the fuck was Negasi? Where was Nimpkins? Where were the Aurors? Here he was, in agony in another fucking basement, waiting for help that wouldn’t arrive, only this time it was worse because Draco was here too, and Harry hadn’t saved him. He could see his face, bloodied and bruised but still so handsome, his mouth forming Harry’s name as someone kicked him in the hip again, and even beneath the pain Harry felt his rage growing.
you; and I’m massaging it because I’m a trained Healer and I can feel how absolutely buggered your muscles are right now. Can’t I do both things at once?”
His first class of the day was Hufflepuff and Gryffindor first years, which seemed like a good, non-intimidating place to start, and considering his own first-year Defense professor had been possessed by Voldemort, he felt confident he'd be better than that, at least. He'd had a pain potion with breakfast and was much more mobile than the previous night, but he'd still misjudged the distance from the Great Hall and arrived a few minutes late to find a class of huge-eyed, silent students waiting behind their desks.
It was, overall, an excellent meal. If it had been a date, Harry would have said it was a very, very good one, but because he wasn’t sure it was a date, it alternated between being great fun and being great agony. He kept second-guessing every tiny interaction – was Draco flirting, or was he like this with everyone? Was he smiling at Harry, or smiling at the delicious curry? Did he mean to bump his foot against Harry’s foot? When he helped Harry into his coat as they stood to leave, was he being gallant because he was courting Harry or because he was a Healer and Harry was a pathetic sod who could barely put on his own jacket?
“Not at the strength level your diagnostic suggests you require,” said Kevari. “You know Barley-thorn’s the only thing that’ll get your muscles to loosen. Here, can you sit up?”
"That's a long story," said Malfoy. "But to make it short, I was offered this position, and I accepted. Here." He put out his hand and Harry gripped it, staggering upright. "Will you be okay to get around?"
Distantly, he’d known this for a while, but had avoided looking directly at it for many reasons -- most of which had much to do with the fact that this was Draco bloody Malfoy -- but also, Harry was coming to realize that he did not know how to have a crush as this new version of himself. He didn’t even know how to assess Malfoy’s interest, much less act on it. In his dating life he had relied heavily on the kinds of physical flirtation that led to one thing, and one thing only, and in point of fact he had absolutely no idea how to do that thing anymore. He trusted that he could learn, of course – could learn to navigate the limitations of his body in bed, just as he was learning to navigate them out of it – and thank god his mouth still worked just fine – but learning required a lot of patience from the partner upon whom one learned. Harry couldn’t expect anyone to stick around while he tried to figure out if he was good for anything but lying flat on his back, unmoving, wincing every now and then.
Harry propped his cane against the bar so he could dig into the expandable pocket of his jeans, and took out the photo of Draco and his mother he’d swiped off Draco’s deck. He passed it to the bartender. “Looking for a mate of mine,” he said, leaning on his cane again. “You seen him?”
"And you've got your cane?" Hermione continued. "I really think you might consider using it, Hogwarts is the safest place you could be, it's so heavily-warded -- but it's also
"Tour?" Harry said, palming the wall for balance as he started to limp after her. "I have been here once or twice, you know."
And now it was happening, what he’d been dreading all day: his body was giving up on him. All those ruined joints were turning sickly liquid like in his memories, his fingers flaring with pain, wrist spasming, shoulder hanging like dead, agonizing weight, his hip buckling, his knee –
“Fuck,” he said to the empty bar. Then he turned to the three Stunned, unconscious wizards and, just to be on the safe side, Petrified them as well so they wouldn’t be able to move when they came to.
Besides, even at his best he probably could not have beat Malfoy, who played pool with a kind of lean, focused intensity. Watching him made Harry feel oddly like he wasn't getting enough air. Malfoy was graceful as always, but there was a restrained power in the way he handled the cue stick, gently at first until he was certain of his target, and then with total confidence.
He said it as confidently as possible, trying to reassure Neville as much as himself, and it worked on both of them. They smiled at one another, the same fearful, determined smiles they’d given each other hundreds of times, before countless battles both tiny and huge.
Malfoy sat at the end of the table and Harry resolutely did not look at him again. His stomach was growling, and he realized with a jolt of horror that he'd forgotten all about the Sorting -- it would be at least an hour before he'd get a chance to eat. He cursed himself silently. He should've scrounged up something to take with his pain potion; if he didn't get something down soon, the effects would fade as quickly as they had come on.
Harry swallowed. “I’m sorry you had to find me at all,” he said. “I mean – I’m sorry you had to see that. What I did to those wizards.”
“Here we go,” he muttered. Malfoy gave him a questioning look that Harry pretended not to see, and a moment later, they were in the thick of it.
Hermione was, of course, at work when Harry banged on their door, but Ron answered after a long moment, Rosie over his shoulder and a visibly sodden diaper in one hand. He looked harried and put-out but he blinked in surprise when he saw Harry and stepped back automatically to let him in.
She didn't say anything, just sat by his bed for a while, staring at her knees. Then she rubbed her eyes, stood, and said, "I hope you feel better."
“Yeah,” Harry said absently, wand clicking back in place as he gripped his cane again. He went straight to Malfoy’s desk and began rifling through the papers and parchments there, spreading them out clumsily with his bad hand, but he could tell instantly that they were all lesson plans and essays so he propped his cane against the wall and sat down in Malfoy’s chair to start going through the drawers. Nothing.
"Oh,” Malfoy said, looking pleased, “I don't think I'd have trouble getting permission to accompany you, if you – if you wanted me to. I think you underestimate how badly McGonagall feels about how difficult your first few months have been."
“Yes,” Harry hissed in relief, dropping his wand and breaking the spell. “Excellent. We’ve got a time and a location, that’ll be enough to get started with.”
Harry himself knew no such thing. Hermione put her arms around his neck, and Harry was gratified to see that she did so less carefully than she might have even a few months ago, and he returned her embrace as she kissed his cheek.
Overall, however, his students seemed glad to have him back. The only real hiccup was during his fifth period, right after he'd taken his customary slow lope around the room, enjoying the new flexibility in his leg. He sat back behind his desk, still lecturing on defensive wand-motions, and then --
Neville finally tore his eyes away from the Cute Snakewort and settled into the other lawn chair. “Two of them were plants. Not these kinds of plants, obviously – the bad kind, people pretending to be ill to gain admittance to St. Mungo’s so they could get at Draco. Old… friends of the family, I guess. Angry with him for his betrayal of their values.”
It was not. He cracked out of nothing right next to a man at a urinal, and narrowly missed getting sprayed with piss when the terrified fellow swung around. Harry modified the poor man’s memory and suggested he leave the pub, then pushed open the washroom door and went out into a dingy, low-lit hallway. He took a moment to consciously try and relax, because his tension wasn’t doing his body any favors and his shoulder kept sending spasms of pain through his back. He rolled his neck carefully, shook out his right hand where it had a death-grip on his cane, and went into the pub.
"I eat here every day, just like you," he said. "And every fucking day I have to deal with this, every fucking day I come here and pray I'll get up these fucking stairs, and it never gets any easier. We're bloody wizards, we can turn tables into bloody teapots but we can't manage a simple fucking railing?”
Harry thought he should be insulted by this, but it was only the truth. He went round behind Malfoy's desk and sat down, enjoying both the sweet smell of lilies and the odd experience of being behind someone else's desk. He clanked around in his pockets for a potion and drank it as Malfoy came over with two glasses.
She gave him the sympathetic smile of a much older person and patted his shoulder. "Don't worry, Professor."
“—And go out to dinner, looks like,” Ron said, glaring at the bright sign of the restaurant they’d just exited. He narrowed his eyes at Harry. “Have a nice time, did you?”
to solve – and meanwhile Draco’s convinced you still think of him as a Death Eater and you’ve only tolerated his company this long because you’re bored and because he makes you potions and –”
"Bloody brilliant," Harry said, stabbing a sausage with his knife. The hangover combined with the near-fall combined with his stiff knee and the exhausting prospect of a day spent hobbling around even worse than he already hobbled around had turned his mood very sour indeed. "You?"
Another man had joined them, very tall and pale in dark robes. “To be frank,” he said, “I’m still a bit bewildered that we’re bestowing such a gift upon a
“Let’s get you sat down,” Negasi said, exchanging a look with Draco, who still had a hand on Harry’s back. “My office is just there. You might remember it, Harry, seeing as it used to be yours. I’ve redecorated a bit… more badgers, fewer lions, for one thing…”
And now it was just Harry and a pack of magicless Squibs, and it should’ve been an easy job, breaking free and getting to Malfoy, but the grip on his bad arm wrenched it even further, his shoulder screaming, his whole back seizing up, and he was in so much pain he was breathless with it, unable to get enough air to form the words for a spell. He pointed his wand at whoever was holding his arm – Abigail, it was Abigail -- and let out a nonverbal gust of magic that shoved her back and away, but though the pressure loosened the pain didn’t, and it was happening, the thing he’d feared most, his body was betraying him. His vision was swimming and every bone and muscle and joint was working in tandem to get his brain to shut down, to plunge him into blessed unconsciousness where nothing would hurt. Desperately, he pointed his wand at Malfoy’s chains just as people came at him from both sides, ramming into his bad arm, kicking his bad leg, grabbing hold of his good wand arm and pulling it down as the spell broke free, shot across the room – and missed.
Harry stood up every now and then to Lock his knee and take a turn around the pub so his traitorous body wouldn't stiffen too badly, and though his passage was watched covertly and followed by whispers, overall it seemed people had learned from the HOUSE RULES and did not try and approach him, over than to nod a little and smile when they caught his eye. Like Hermione, he appreciated it.
Despite the fact that he was running a bit late, he tried to keep his pace unhurried; difficult for someone who’d once hurried everywhere, but he'd taken enough tumbles in the past year and a half to not tempt fate. His leg ached unrelentingly, a dull throb twisting down the curse line from his hip to his knee, but it was doing a good impression of reliability today, none of the looseness in his knee joint that meant it might buckle at any time. Good; he didn’t want his first impression on his students to include going arse over teakettle in the Great Hall.
“I’m fine,” Draco said. “As predicted. Not even a concussion to show for my day of adventure.” He looked at Kevari. “Do you need to take him into St. Mungo’s?”
"I am," Harry said fiercely. So proud he couldn't say anything more on the subject without getting choked up. "And your old school friends? Have you kept in touch with any of them?" The wankers, he added silently.
“Dougie!” it called, imperious and female and muffled, far away, somewhere in the bowels of the house. “Dougie, what’s keeping you?”
Say what you wanted about Harry’s defensive tactics (plenty of people had), his expelliarmus was a brutal art by this point. Their wands flew out of their hands and across the room with such force that one of them splintered against the opposing wall, but Phil was already pulling back his fist for a blow, and Harry, knowing he’d be knocked down at the first threat to his balance, decided to get on the floor under his own steam. He threw himself at Phil before the punch could land, ramming him with his good shoulder and sending him crashing to the floor, aiming his wand as they both went down and shouting “Fragore!” at one of hanging lamps over Craig’s head.
“Here,” Betsy said, “walk it up and down the aisle before we actually put your wand in, so I can see if I need to make any alterations first. Really feel into the experience and think about how it’s working for you -- because no matter how nifty it is as a gadget, it’s trash if it doesn’t actually help you walk.”
“Nothing’s happened to me, I’m absolutely fine, just trying something new to help me get about,” Harry recited tersely, and sat as far away from her as he could. “Malfoy, pass the potatoes.”
"Let me walk you back to your room," Neville said, his face anxious, and Harry knew he was thinking of his promise to Hermione.
Harry was suddenly more interested in Betsy. He'd never heard Malfoy refer to anyone as a good friend before, and he was interested to see what Malfoy's friends looked like these days. You could tell so much about a person from their friends -- and even more from they way they interacted with their friends.
“Of course you are,” said Jacob. “We completely understand. Very official.” He winked extravagantly.
The windowseat was in sight, but Harry had no time to stop. He leaned heavily on the banister and picked up his pace, swinging his immobilized knee from a hip that was decidedly not made for swinging, eyes forward -- and even later he couldn't have said how it happened.
Shit. Harry had forgotten all about the meeting that afternoon, his first of the semester. He'd wanted to appear the paragon of professionalism, but instead he was going to look like day-old gruel. His watch chirped merrily and he quickly downed a vial of potion, then reached for a piece of toast. At least he wasn't in pain. But he'd have to break back into Malfoy's office and make more potion tonight, if he wanted to keep the relief going beyond tomorrow, which he very much did. Maybe his second try would be more up to snuff.
He gripped Neville's shoulder and let him take some of his weight, and together they made their way slowly down the brief stairs and across the Great Hall. By that time Harry's leg had limbered up enough to let him walk unsupported, and Neville ambled along beside him until they came to the wide, twisting marble steps that led to the sixth floor.
"But children..." Harry said. He was working something out and not liking where it took him. "Only powerful dark magic can make unHealable wounds. Who would -- who would curse a child?"
"Is it cheating if I ask you to hang onto my good shoulder?" Harry asked Malfoy. "Just to keep me up?"
Absolute silence had fallen over the students, and Harry immediately took the exit offered, giving them a wave and moving to follow Malfoy towards the faculty table. Another wave of giggling broke out in their wake and he heard Jacob sigh, "Absolutely fucking
"I didn't know what had happened!" Malfoy said. "I thought you'd passed out, or been hit with a curse, or had a bloody cardiac arrest, you just said my name and boom, you went down like a sack of bricks. I grabbed you and starting yelling my head off for help, and then --" Suddenly, unimaginably, Malfoy was giggling. "And then you started -- oh, Merlin -- you started
Harry knew what Draco would say about all this effort: he’d say it didn’t matter. That it was just Howlers, an annoyance, no harm done. But Harry knew how it must weigh on him to be screamed at every morning, another reminder of the past he’d tried so hard to overcome. It was beyond frustrating not to be able to find answers for him.
"Do you not remember what we used to get up to around here?" Harry demanded. "Sneaking out of bed at all hours, exploring the castle --"
But why should Harry care what Malfoy thought of his body? It's not as if he'd be looking, would he? Certainly not like Harry knew he'd be looking at Malfoy, but that was only because Malfoy was gorgeous; anyone would look. And the water looked so cold, so inviting...
He hauled himself up and stumped gracelessly to the stairs, where he had the horrible realization that there was absolutely no way of getting down them without some form of support -- preferably a
“Professor!” gasped one of his first years as he came out of the Floo – first time without stumbling, thanks to the added support. “What’s happened to you?”
Harry, who'd been sitting behind the desk, got to his feet, trying not to give away how agitated he felt.
"First announcement," announced McGonagall. "We have been approved for an in-castle Floo network and will commence construction immediately."
It was freeing to admit it aloud, and they all three retired to the sofas, Neville on one and Harry and Malfoy on the other. Neville began dozing almost as soon as he'd sat down and Harry, for the first time in hours, checked his watch.
It was made more intimidating by the fact that he, Harry, had recently undergone a rather serious life change, a change he hadn’t chosen for himself, a change he was still struggling with daily, a change that had rewritten huge parts of what he thought he knew about himself. Maybe that was why he bristled so when Draco called him “Harry Potter,” with all its connotations of power and heroism and able-bodied action. Ever since he’d gotten on the Hogwarts Express and sat next to Ron and realized that everybody knew who he was except for him, he had never quite felt like that image of “Harry Potter.” Now, even less so. Who even
“You don’t need to check on me,” Harry said, very sharply. “I’m not your patient, Draco – I’m your bloody colleague.”
“Yes. Not that I’ve forgotten what it was like working under you, but I thought this once we’d make a game plan before storming in.”
All across the room, people had thrown their hands up over their ears and students were cowering beneath the tables, but Draco just sat there, jaw set, waiting for the sound to die off. When it had, he picked up the slightly-smoking envelope, put it in his pocket, and stood to leave. There were two vivid spots of color in his cheeks but the rest of his face was deathly pale.
"Do you want to come in?" Malfoy was not a blurter-outer, and he did not blurt now. But Harry could tell he had not expected to say this. "In the lake, I mean. It's so hot out."
“Yeah,” Harry said. He took a long, slow breath and finally looked around at where they were. A drizzling grey sky, a rolling field of damp grass, clumps of trees, a dilapidated barn, and some ways away, a house. “Is that it, the Debs’ home?”
“Lots of arrests, is what,” said Negasi. “Sorry it took so long for us to come find you, Harry – Nimpkins busted into the wrong house at first, the idiot, had to memory-wipe an entire family of Muggles. Anyway, we’re waiting for the Healers. You both got conked on the head and we didn’t think it wise to apparate either of you just yet.”
Draco made a small movement like he wanted to lean down and touch Harry again, and Harry’s entire body thrilled to the idea; but Draco checked himself at the last moment, nodded at Kevari, and vanished into the kitchen.
"Yes?" Harry said, and she skittered back. He might have spoken too sharply -- he was trying in vain to get his bad hand to grip tightly enough to help him open a bottle of ink, and was forced to think balefully of Malfoy's comment about potion bottles.
She pulled him to his feet with a decent show of strength and then spent rather a long time measuring him, in ways that made sense and in ways that did not. She measured the length of his leg, which seemed apropos, but then measured the length of his nose, which seemed a bit beside the point. She made him stick his hand in a plate of goo to take an “impression,” then measured around his hips like she was fitting him for trousers. It was all very mysterious.
They went back out into the main pub and Harry said, “Secure the doors, would you? It wouldn’t do to have any Muggles popping in for a pint right now.”
The scars from the curses were terrible, thick and ropy and shiny, and they still moved sometimes like snakes winding under his skin. His kneecap was obscured by scar tissue, his hip no better, though his shoulder and the joints of his fingers weren't as bad. They blended with the other, minor scars he'd picked up over the years -- little starbursts from hexes, jagged blast-marks from jinxes, slash-marks and burns and whatever else.
Clearly, he was not going anywhere under his own steam. Even with his hatred of Mobilicorpus he'd have gladly used it on himself right now, if such a thing were possible, but at the very least he could send a Patronus to Neville, begging assistance. It was humiliating beyond all reason and Neville would probably report straight to Hermione and Harry would get a scolding, but right now a tongue-lashing from Hermione sounded like actual heaven compared to what was happening right now.
“Weasley,” Draco sniffed back. Then, to Hermione, in much nicer tones, “Hello, Minister. Congratulations on your recent Wizengamot win for mandatory house elf labor law.”
Draco and Harry both turned to find Ron Weasley standing on the corner of the road, dramatically lit beneath a wrought-iron streetlamp. His arms were folded and his hair was blazing like an avenging fire.
He sat there now on the last Sunday in September, revising some ideas he had for a new Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook. It was just a silly side-project to keep himself occupied, but he enjoyed the work, enjoyed thinking through the problems of how to explain things and in what order. Boggarts were a natural foundation for Dementors, but what would be a suitable link between the two, something that could be taught in the fifth year, perhaps?
Harry was still so attuned for insult that for a moment he felt himself bristling. Which was silly, because -- "Yes, it really has."
"Very few," said Malfoy. "Many of us went in... different directions. I'm closest with Blaise Zabini, if you remember him?"
Harry did not. Reluctantly, he slowed. Then he pulled up sharp. "Wait -- you knew? You knew it was me who -- who took those things from your office?"
“Draco,” he said, going limp with relief. He blinked at the blond blur over Negasi’s shoulder, and a moment later, Draco bent his face into view. It was the best thing Harry had ever seen – split lip, black eye and all. “Merlin, I’m glad you’re all right.”
Malfoy, for his part, did no more than glance at Harry, and Harry felt both relieved and obscurely disappointed. He knew he was nothing to look at, not anymore, but shouldn't Malfoy at least be curious? About the scars, anyway -- most people were. The complete lack of interest was disheartening. Which was a strange feeling, because usually Harry hated to be stared at.
“Dougie said you might come by. Couldn’t pass up the chance to see if the old magic really works, could you?”
“Say goodbye to your melodramatic Uncle Harry, who'll see you again before you’ve learned to shit somewhere other than your own trousers,” Ron told his daughter. She let out another hoarse cackle, her one tooth glinting. She'd be a terror when she got older, Harry thought happily.
Kevari looked deeply amused, and too-late Harry remembered that the Healer had seen them in a rather compromising position. “Is that what he is?” Kevari said. “Hogwarts must be a fascinating place to work, if that’s how one treats one’s colleagues there.”
It was decided that they would split a bottle of wine, and Harry tried not to read too much into this. But wine, that was date stuff, wasn’t it? If it wasn’t a date, they’d be drinking beer, wouldn’t they? Harry would, at any rate… but probably Draco always had wine, probably this didn’t mean anything, and if Harry had not fully admitted it to himself before, this panicked internal conversation would have convinced him: he
Immediately he thought of his students' ridiculous theory and wished he could take this back, but Malfoy didn't seem to register it as anything untoward. He only nodded, and picked up his quill, and Harry was dismissed.
"Hi," he said brightly. "Sorry to've missed class. Hope you took advantage and slept late for a few days."
"Yes," Harry said staunchly. "We've got this massive, magical castle at our disposal, but all we ever do is grade papers and trudge around the lake."
"My father had his wand in a walking stick for a time," Malfoy said. "Ornamental, but it was the same idea."
“Fine,” Harry called, surprised to hear how normal his voice sounded. He would have expected it to come out a croak. “Just the knee – you go on –”
“Oh, what now?” Draco said, but Harry could see that not-a-smile smile playing around his lips. “Are you going to accuse me again of playing Healer?”
Hanna stopped several steps below the landing, her dark eyes wide with fear. "Professor, are you all right? It's -- it's time for class."
He and Malfoy had come to a patch of ground uneven with rocks and roots, and Harry slowed, careful with his steps lest he torque his knee or trip. He felt Malfoy move closer and he gritted his teeth, suddenly irritated by the concern. He wanted Malfoy to move closer because he wanted to
Harry felt his neck get hot, and he took a hasty drink of his cocktail. "You mean see me get walloped."
"No," Harry said hurriedly, "no, that's all right, I'm sure I'll be fine." He'd figure something out, something that didn't involve Draco bloody Malfoy. In the meantime, he resigned himself to leaving early for breakfast each morning, early enough to accommodate five staircases and, let's face it, five little sit-downs between them. He could use a sit-down right now, but such a luxury didn't appear to be forthcoming.
"Yeah, but when I came to Hogwarts they fixed me up the first day. See?" He stood to demonstrate the height equality of his legs. "How come they can't fix you?"
“Besides,” said a different robed man, bouncing excitedly on his toes. “Once we prove this works, Azkaban is full of purebloods. They’re as good as dead, anyhow – I’m certain we can convince the Ministry to sacrifice them for the greater good of our wizarding lines. No one wants to have a Squib child anymore than we wanted to be born one!”
Malfoy shrugged, overly casual in a way that made Harry think he wasn't feeling very casual at all. "That's what it feels like. To have left that world. I know how it looks from the outside, but it's -- it's not easy to realize that everything you were taught, everything you were raised to think, was a hateful lie. It cost me pretty much everyone in my life, except mum. And Blaise. We lived together in France for a while."
He was supposed to meet Malfoy at Betsy's at 2, but the cobblestones were rain-slick and uneven and by the time he turned the corner and caught sight of Malfoy, it was 2:15 and every muscle in his body was clenched from the tension of trying not to topple over. He tried not to imagine how much easier this would be with a cane; he didn't want to get his hopes up.
For a moment he thought Malfoy might protest, might try and wait with him, but to his relief, the other man just nodded.
Harry didn't look at him, because he was currently leaning heavily on his arm and if he'd turned their faces would have been far too close for comfort. "In case you haven't noticed, I'm a bit paranoid."
“We are conducting business,” Harry said. “For the school. Very official, professorial business, strictly academic.” As he spoke, he realized that he was only digging himself deeper. Anything he said to these children was immediately seized upon and dramatically misconstrued.
"I think she'd let you go tomorrow," Malfoy said. "It's a medical reason, she can't very well say no. Betsy closes shop at eight so you'd have plenty of time after class."
“Draco,” Kevari said, “Healer Seidman will tend to you in the kitchen, if you don’t mind giving me a moment with Harry, here.”
"It's true what they were saying about brooms at dinner," Malfoy said. "About Nimbus's new comfort line. I think if you wanted to fly again you might try --"
“Pain potions are hardly healing,” Harry said, sidestepping the question. The answer was no: he had absolutely no plans to limp pathetically into Malfoy’s office and whinge about how much it hurt. He was, at least according to tabloids, the most powerful wizard of his generation. Surely he could manage a few simple pain potions to keep himself going.
The curse thudded in Harry's joints. He was in so much fucking pain, was so fucking tired, he had no energy for Malfoy's taunts and insults, no energy even to muster a reply that wouldn't humiliate himself further. He nodded.
“I love my brother too much to subject him to that,” said Betsy. She turned her beautiful eyes full on Harry, then, and said, “It’s lovely to see you again. How’s your wand?”
Harry ignored him, fumbling to get his jacket closed. He really had to find a zip-up spell. “Could I have a look at your network map so I can figure out where I’m headed?”
Harry, speaking thickly around his own pride, said, "That would... make my life considerably easier."
Harry was struggling to sit up against the arm of the couch but finding it shockingly hard. The left half of his body was a useless, agonizing throb. Someone had folded his bad arm across his stomach and it fell into his lap as he moved, entirely ignoring any requests he made of it; he couldn’t even twitch his fingers. He managed to get himself propped up on one elbow but try as he might he couldn’t manage to make it further than that. Negasi had a hand on his chest, trying to keep him down, though it was clear he was nervous to press too hard or be too rough and it was mostly ineffectual.
"He's perfectly all right, as you can see, Minerva," said Malfoy, in a slow, soothing voice Harry'd only heard from him once, on the other fucking set of fucking stairs he'd fallen down. "I'll give him a once-over to be on the safe side. Most helpful thing you both can do is give him space."
"Oh, for heaven's sake," said McGonagall. "I hope you told them to put their noses right out of it."
"It's a delicate subject," Malfoy said. "And --" He looked suddenly deeply uncomfortable. "All right. I think you should know, yes, that Chloé Barnes is the daughter of Gibson Ackley. Her mother changed their name for -- well, for obvious reasons."
He was in the foyer of a very Muggle-looking home, nothing magical anywhere that he could see. To the left appeared to be a kitchen, to the right a living room, and directly in front of him was a staircase leading to the second floor. He was standing very still, ears pricked for any sound, eyes skimming for any hint of where he ought to go first, when he heard the faint creak of a floorboard bending. He tensed, springing his wand again from his cane and shifting his weight to his good leg, prepared to strike.
But even as he thought this, he realized that Muggles and Squibs couldn’t cast rituals. Which meant there had to be another wizard present, after all.
"Your ego's big enough, Potter," Malfoy continued. "So don't let this go to your head. But I'd always thought of myself as cowardly -- and was always told I was cowardly -- because I'd never been able to bring myself to kill anyone outright. I always thought I wasn't brave enough to kill. The Room of Requirement, when you saved me even though you nearly died doing it -- it got me thinking that maybe I'd been wrong, about bravery. That maybe killing is in fact more cowardly, and mercy's the hard bit."
He took a moment to sight his target and aim, then he took a deep breath, and let the cue ball fly. It knocked into the 9 with a satisfying
"If you consent to the potion, you will have thirty minutes in which you will feel no pain whatsoever. It sounds nice, I know, but it's also dangerous, because pain is a good communicator. Any damage you do to yourself is still damage, whether or not you feel it, so although you're going to want to move quickly, it is imperative that you move as you normally would. Understand?"
It occurred to Harry, for the first time, to say, "Thank you for that. And thanks for fetching Mal -- Professor Malfoy."
“You’re blushing,” Ron said disgustedly. “I can’t believe I’m going to have to go on double dates with Draco bloody Malfoy.”
"You of all people, Potter, should know the depths of evil that can exist in this world. Careful!" He hissed the last word as they reached the top step and Harry began to stride in the direction of his rooms. But how could he be careful? It felt so good to move like this, to move as he once had, unthinking, letting his body carry him instinctually.
"You see, the damage, the weakness, it's still there, but you have no pain to warn you about it. So move very cautiously or you'll have more to deal with later."
He was in pain, and then he wasn't: hell, and then heaven. The change was so disorienting that his muscles briefly gave out and he began to sag like a rag doll before he caught himself. Malfoy was right, it was like no pain potion he'd ever had before -- the pain wasn't dulled, wasn't calmed, it was simply vanished. The relief of it was like a tidal wave, so enormous and all-encompassing that, to Harry's deep embarrassment, his eyes filled with tears. He visored his eyes with a hand and turned away, and nothing about movement hurt, it was as fluid and natural as it had used to be, back in the Before of this never-ending After. It felt so good not to feel bad. He drew a shuddering breath, thumbing at a tear that had forced its way onto his cheek. He couldn't look at Malfoy. He felt flayed open.
Sure enough, hundreds of letters arrived at his sickbed, outraged on his behalf -- one, predictably, from Molly Weasley, threatening to come to Hogwarts and fix things herself, but mostly from strangers of all genders who either wanted to mother him, fuck him, or both at once. There were also a handful of notes from curse-injured wizards who expressed their sympathy and said how glad they were that people were finally paying attention. Those were nice -- but less nice was the follow-up headline,
