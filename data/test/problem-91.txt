"And Draco understands?" Lee asked without judgment, with a journalistic detachment that was kind of jarring.
"Would you say working on the campaign brought you two together?"
"Ow!"
Malfoy stands up unsteadily. "Well then I'll be certain to break your rules, because I always move with grace and dignity, and I always treat you like shit."
"No, I have some of that cashew brioche. And before you complain, I also have the country sourdough you like from The Philosopher's Scone."
He breathed a sigh of relief and scrubbed a hand over his face. Hopefully that was the worst of it.
Harry gives her a
When Harry awoke the next morning, his body felt heavy and his eyes drooped. He had no desire to get out of his warm bed.
Harry noticed his trainer was fraying at the toe, where the canvas met the sole. He looked up and nodded at Penelope. “Okay. I’ll try.”
Harry frowned. Obviously that
The Muggle Mediation Measures was a programme run by the ICW to prevent the worst effects of what Supreme Mugwump Geneviève Chéreau referred to as "Muggle mismanagement of the Earth." (Well, she called it "mauvaise gestion non magique de la terre," but the British had landed on 'Muggle mismanagement' and 'Muggle Mediation Measures,' because the Ministry loved alliteration when acronyms weren't to be had.) The Triple M was tedious, difficult-to-organise labour—magical people in every country and continent had to work together to try to stop ocean desalination, animal extinction, deforestation, and so on. And it was thankless work—the Muggles continued to ruin the planet, making the Triple M (which Ron insisted on referring to as "mmmmmmm") seem ineffective when it was actually working, only against impossible and ever growing odds. No one wanted to pay for it. And yet, it was important work. If Britain left…
That's interesting. Harry's about to ask him about it, but his brain veers off. "Are people being shitty to you?"
Draco squeezed Harry's hand. "I saw the worst of the war, like Harry did. The only difference is that I was a coward while Harry was brave. I only hope the people of Magical Britain can accept my life's work as penance for all the pain in which I was implicated."
There's a buzzing in Harry's ears that reminds him of third year, when he used to be so affected by Dementors that he'd hear his mother's death scream. Only this time he's feeling all that, but also remembering that he and Ginny had created the beginning of a life, that they'd yelled and that now—he's alone again. He blinks. Being an orphan never stops being a flaming pile of shit. "Ginny and I aren't going to get back together. But it's fine that she'll be here."
sentient, or was Wilhelm using idioms? "I'm joking! If anyone's listening! I've never taken a bribe or a kickback!"
"You're mocking me."
Blue-Lens approached the barista. "I'd like a triple cappuccino—
Harry took a sip of coffee. "To be fair, I don't see anyone saying…that."
"Well I can't," Draco snapped back. "And I don't think you're being completely honest right now, either. You've barely said anything except to express a desire for things to keep going the way they've been."
. And some of the family you get is because of who the people you love love. The people you love, the people you choose, get to choose
There was a knock at the front door followed by the sound of Lorraine Apparating to answer it. Lavender and Parvati strode in a moment later.
comparable occasions," Draco said defensively.
Malfoy suddenly sat up straight. “We should have a party.”
"Oh shut up."
, for goodness' sake! He was the type of person who talked about things when they came up, because he knew how shitty things got when you didn't.
Harry couldn't find his favourite jeans. His head was buried deep in his wardrobe, and he was trying to avoid spelling the entire contents out of the wardrobe and dresser out onto the floor.
Draco hid a delighted grin behind his hand and crossed one bare leg over the other. “So you agree, then, sir, that Harry is the only one here who does not comply with the dress code?”
He looked up when he heard the door and smiled. "Good morning."
Harry leaned forward, something dangerous flashing in his eyes. Draco found himself leaning back. "Too fucking
"Have you ever ordered the Mood Mug?" Harry asked, gesturing to the sign.
to anyone who cares about the mellifluous flow of language and words."
"We'd been working together on Penelope's campaign, and helping Albus and Scorpius as they are trying to adopt a baby, and it just happened. I'm 55 years old. I'm not putting off happiness in my life anymore."
Malfoy was wearing a tailored set of business robes and looked like he was about to prance off to a corporate job where he would go about the daily grind of wringing every last Knut out of lowly peasants. He looked like the wizard equivalent of the man on the Monopoly box.
Now it was time for Rump to speak. He looked smug even in holographic projection.
much better than me. I promise."
"I mean, what are you doing
He never forgot the people who had previously held his position included not only Amelia Bones, but also Corban Yaxley.
“With this retrograde tripe the Ministry is passing off as a dress code,” Draco spat. “It’s one thing if it’s an old policy, but this is
"Honestly, because Veritaserum? For you to give this—us—the best chance its got. Also, I wouldn't say no to a blowjob. What do
?!” Draco hissed, his cheeks turning bright red. He was whispering, but loud enough for a mother standing near them to fix them with dirty looks as she ushered her children away from the cursing middle-aged men.
"Uh oh," Harry says, smiling. "That sounds ominous."
Luckily, she was a world-weary barista, and said no such thing. She looked like a struggling artist, Harry thought, with her tattoos and her artsy hair. He wondered at the difficulty of working such a low-wage job, and was overcome with a feeling of compassion.
them. There was so much in the world to be angry about, and Harry was tired of being angry. He really just wanted to do his job. He really just wanted to fuck around with Ron.
Lily rolled her eyes through a smile. Harry wasn't kidding, though. He didn't have favourites between his kids, but the memory of Lily's first smile stood out. Harry remembered being in a haze of sleep deprivation and toddler discipline and stepping on toy dragons, giving Lily a bottle, and she looked up at him with her wispy red hair and reached out for his face with her little hand and smiled at him. He'd cried. Well, he'd
Hermione puts her tea down and strides over, arms out, and wraps him in a hug. "No one acts perfectly all the time. Especially if they have lots of trauma."
Harry laughed delightedly, too busy watching Draco to catch Lily's reaction.
"You say that now," Draco said, thrusting a long finger into Harry's space. "But five years from now you may well need to…attend to personal business.
A Stinging Hex hit Harry's head and he sprung off the table, wrinkling his brow. "Ow."
"I'd watch out if I were you," Draco said, his nails scratching a very unthreatening line down Harry's scalp, "because there are two semantic uses of 'to take care of' someone, and I might switch to the other."
On the day of the party, Harry and Hermione have class, so Hermione makes them clean the flat and get everything ready the night before. Including the food, under Preserving Charms, and the music, a stack of CDs (the top one reads
“It was a heartbreaking story of growing up,” she said, pulling one leg up under her bottom, raising herself up in both intensity and height. “There’s this doll, Jessie, and she is now a collector’s item, and Woody thinks Jessie doesn’t understand what it’s like to lose a friend, but then Jessie tells him her backstory, because she does understand! And turns out Jessie used to belong to a little girl but the little girl forgot about Jessie as she grew up, and Jessie got kicked under the bed and eventually tossed into a box of free stuff that was left on the side of the road, Harry. Don’t you see? She understands. Because she’s experienced loss, too.”
Harry reached into his pocket, fishing around for some coins.
Draco nodded. "Well, not exactly. She just said that I would've won because I don't scare the moderates like Penny did. And then she added, 'If you were married to someone respectable, of course.'"
But the strange thing was that the kids stopped asking about Harry and Draco's new "relationship." It had worked—they believed it. At least, Harry thought it had worked. He was sure they'd have more questions and concerns about it in the coming weeks and months, but ultimately they all believed that Harry and Draco were in a relationship. That they were
Harry's skeptical heart thawed and suddenly all he could feel was happiness for his son's excitement. Why shouldn't he buy a home? He was plenty old enough—James was 32, nearly a decade older than Harry had been when James was born.
over and over even though you were thoroughly past the point of surprise.
Harry opened his eyes. "Hey! What was that for?"
He lifted his hand in a wave, smile in place, and ignored them. He walked confidently towards the lifts, nodding his head at the cameras and hoping that his smile looked at all convincing.
"No, don't—don't say anything that will make me feel better about it. I need to feel like a cock trumpet. My karma requires it."
As Draco's heart rate slowed, he realised with horror that he'd been waxing poetic (mentally, not aloud, thank Merlin) about testicles. Testicles, of all things! He was so gone.
The witch in front of Blue-Lens, whose iguana sat obediently atop her shoulder, was now ordering.
for this person.
Harry knocked, then shoved his hands in his pockets. The door knocker was boring. Harry allowed himself a moment of amusement as he imagined Draco's face if Harry installed his lion door knocker on "their" house. He loved his lion door knocker.
Harry looked up, face pained, and deflated. "Al, I—I'm so sorry."
Albus pulled a face. "I don't know, Dad. It's weird, but I'm not upset."
"Trying to," Harry replied, grinning. "Not sure if she can really take in the message while asleep."
up against Rump, it would make him look insane. I would be the logical choice for candidate."
. It’s strange to have a husband. I mean, I
Draco turned to Harry. He didn't want to talk about his feelings! But Harry was looking at him, open and curious, and Draco willed his feelings to come out as words. "My parents only ever gave me money or expensive, useless gifts I didn't want. What was I supposed to do with a 5000 Galleon model thestral that was made of crystal and meant to be displayed in a cabinet?"
He cleared his throat again, and waited until he had everyone's undivided attention. "Harry and I have something to say. We've decided to get married."
"My job is general curse breaking, so I deal with whatever comes up," Malfoy said, "but my favourite is sentient curses."
“See?! Anyway, it can only nominally be described as a first date, but I’m not going on it with your spasming fucking diaphragm.”
"It's just, you know. Wombs. You'd think we could magic them or something."
"I strongly object," Draco drawled, slurring almost imperceptibly.
Harry dropped his bag onto the floor.
"I just want to be sad. Sad that I wasn't a good partner to Ginny and that I was selfish. Sad that we accidentally made a pregnancy only to stop it. Sad that I've lost so many people."
“Ew. Dads are not allowed to talk about that. Besides,” James added, “no one writes personal ads these days. Everyone’s on Howlr. I guess I need to increase the banter-level of my profile.”
Malfoy sniggered. Harry frowned—was Malfoy laughing at him or with him? He wasn't sure which he preferred. It would be a bit much to bond over this "workshop."
"Calm down, Malfoy," Potter murmurs, and he's concentrating on the magic.
Harry barked an unamused laugh. "You—
"Is he still on leave?"
“Why do I feel like we’re about to do shots together?” Malfoy asked, crinkling his nose, which Harry couldn’t help but think was pretty cute. And Merlin, where had that thought come from?
Lily grinned, her face splitting with happiness, and she jumped up and gave Harry a big hug from behind, wrapping her arms around him. Harry reached a hand up to squeeze her arm, his heart filling with confused warmth because, somehow, all she wanted was for him to be happy.
Harry spluttered. "Draco!"
James grabbed another muffin and kissed Harry on the head. “Thank you both. Really. I’m going to sleep for like ten hours.” He turned and jogged up the stairs.
He and Lily were in the kitchen attempting to make the structural pieces of gingerbread houses, which was, clearly, the worst part of making gingerbread houses. They were using charms to shape the dough, but getting it to cook properly was still a challenge. Lily had flour on her nose and was singing carols, though, so really, Harry didn't mind the job. He had thought that his children would grow out of things like gingerbread houses, but it turned out that once a tradition was established in the Potter family, it would live on until the end of time—even if there were no small children present.
He shrugs. "I got tired of it looking like armour."
?! You can
"Investigation Brigade? I don't know. Whatever it was called. I thought I was signing up for a spot of school-sanctioned bullying, not to be a Death Eater. That came later. False advertising, it was."
“Would it matter if it wasn’t?”
"I say we go buy a bunch of saris right now," Lavender said, as angry as Harry had seen her in a long time, her grey curls bouncing with her indignance. "From the magical district in Mumbai, of course. They can't—"
"Gentlemen," he declared. "Are we ready to order?"
Draco tugged him closer, and Harry pushed Draco back, kissing him against the front door, the cold glass pressing against Draco's neck and the back of his head—and Draco
"Yah," Draco said. "It's my standard order for breakfast, but today I ate at home."
"What?" Ron asked. "It's good."
"Don't say you're not smart. I just mean, it's hard for us to find intimacy with people, after the war. How can people know what we went through? Sometimes I feel it with Ron, even though he was there for the vast majority of it. But the fact that he
For the first time that day, Draco's face lost its haunted quality. He grinned, apparently delighted that Lily thought she'd interrupted a morning after—with Harry in his pyjamas, no less!—without their even having staged it.
few words, but she could say "Pop" and she used it for Draco. How could he hate it?
Malfoy opens the door and his eyes drop to Harry's clothes and back up. He has a strange look on his face. "You came over to study Charms with no books? ...Wearing joggers?"
"Level with me, Potter." Malfoy leans a hand on the kitchen counter. "Are you really here to study? Because we can do that. I just—"
Al sighed. After a moment, he rolled his head to the side and caught Harry's eye. "Distract me. Tell me something new."
“For example,” Penelope said, “and I know this type of example does not apply to either of your cases so spare me your objections, imagine you didn’t get an invitation from some friends going out to lunch. You feel bad, your negative thoughts spiral: they hate me, they don’t want to be friends, no one ever wants to hang out with me. That’s what we’ll call the ‘negative automatic thought.’ The next step is to think about evidence that supports and does not support that thought. So while the lack of invitation supports it, the facts that you were busy with a project, your friends have invited you to other things, et cetera, all point to the fact that your friends don’t hate you. It’s in your power to come up with an alternate thought, different from your negative automatic thought. In this case it could be something like: ‘They didn’t invite me today, but I know I’ll see them this weekend.’”
Harry said nothing, eyes dropping to his coffee.
When they woke, it was to noon-bright sun and Lorraine holding the Hangover Potions. Harry took the potion and, no idea how to act in Draco's bed after all that, smiled embarrassedly and fled.
Harry shrugged, a face of resignation. "I guess? I don't know. Depends what you mean by obsessed. I used to track where you were on a charmed map. I mean, it wasn't all
Harry shrugs. He could obviously eat.
Harry sighed.
Harry watched, fascinated and a bit appalled, as Slughorn made himself comfortable on a velvet settee at the other side of the room, cocooning himself in an afghan and setting out a tin of chocolate-covered figs on the side table. He pulled out a stack of essays and a large purple quill and began marking.
Harry's eyes widen. "What?! No way."
Harry stared, unsure whether this was an elaborate tall tale.
"Would you like a Calming Draught?" Draco asked, rubbing one of his eyes. "I think I might have diazepam, too, if you'd prefer Muggle."
"Not the point, Harry," he drawled, and tossed an arm over his eyes. "And incidentally, threats of sexual violence aren't the done thing anymore."
"Are we going to skate?" Draco asked.
After they'd been there for an hour, Ginny sat cross-legged on the floor and pulled out a pack of Exploding Snap cards.
!" Harry insists. "You asked me what I thought
Harry buys tokens with a bunch of notes Malfoy hands him ("Will one hundred pounds suffice? I exchanged too much when I bought these clothes") and Harry lets Malfoy lead them around the arcade, looking at different games.
"What the fuck is
"Now trade, so you each have one of each." Albus still sounded way too happy.
"I try not to complain to Ron and Hermione," Potter says, and I tilt my head, trying to figure him out. "They're so worried about me, to begin with."
"You have my vote," Harry said. "Now can you get out so I can finish this pile of work and maybe get home before tomorrow is today?"
"Fuck you!" Harry burns with anger. "Yes! I'm allowed to have feelings."
Draco opened his mouth to utter what was sure to be a protest, so Harry leaned forward and kissed him, a big, loud peck on the lips.
Draco's shoulder hitched up. "They could do it any number of ways. Convince you that they will die if they don't sleep, so you have to come over and relieve them. Or they could prey on your childhood traumas, tell you that they're going to implement a cry-it-out policy, then stand back and watch you swoop in."
“It was never that long,” Draco drawls.
. That was strange.
James, ever the shit-stirrer, propped his chin in his hand and looked raptly between Harry and Albus as he sucked on a candy cane.
Harry's eyes flitted towards Draco, and then he froze—shocked to see the ghost of tears in the corners of Draco's grey eyes.
Draco held his hand out indicating Harry should go first.
There's nothing we can't do with this, boys.
But he's not an adult, either, so he's not sure where that leaves him.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Do something fun?”
Harry frowned. “Er, no. You don’t have to answer.” He dug his fingers into the grass, picking at the blades. “Do you ever wonder if things could’ve gone differently?”
"Our place is not
"Are you ready for this?" Draco asked, one leg crossed over the other, foot tapping in the air distractedly.
Hermione had a giant stack of pamphlets resting on her knees. “Healer?” she asked.
"I strongly object." Draco took the shoe, holding it somewhat gingerly, and handed Harry his own shoe, a handsome brown brogue. In his drunk state, Harry was tempted to put Draco's shoe on and affect a little play-acted Draco impersonation.
She flops down next to him. For a long time, neither of them say anything.
"It's signed by Lin-Manuel Miranda. We got it signed when we were in New York to see Hamilton. We took Scorpius. Remember?"
"The WCLU is already working on it," Draco reminded Albus. "The Ministry has no right to surveil people with a Taboo like that."
Ginny enters a few minutes later, and she gives him a weary smile.
Harry frowned, licking some chocolate off his finger. "What
"Nah, I'm off to make something super unhealthy even though Nico won't eat it because of the sugar. See you later."
"Harry, my boy! Your face doesn't quite match the brilliance of your ensemble."
"Well, no." Harry was old enough to not give a shit about this. He refused to be embarrassed. "Can you ignore me?"
"Okay," Harry says, pushing up to a seat and leaning next to Hermione. There's not really anything else to say about that. "We need to get a disco ball."
“Until the next time we meet, this is what I want you to do,” Penelope said, her tone gentle. “Go visit Madam Pomfrey sometime today. I will let her know you're starting a course of Serotonin Potions. If you find yourself having depressive thoughts—such as thinking that this school year is a waste of time, or thinking that the new Ministry is going to be, what did you call it? A bureaucratic, corrupt nightmare?—try to pause—”
He dropped to the sofa next to Albus. "I can't believe they're letting Cornfoot talk."
my fucking
Hermione rolls her eyes. "It just means that, if we feel like we don't know what to do, what path to take, what choice to make—we should, you know, trust that the things that bring us joy are what we should pursue."
"Just get the boys to check it for you. Or better yet, get Teddy to do it for you. Teddy's the expert on everything non-binary."
The Ministry rep from B.A.I.R.N.s
Harry snorted. "A
"And congratulations," Lavender said, placing a hand on Harry's arm and giving them an excited look that made Harry uncomfortable. "I'm
"Hermione?" he calls, peeking his head into the empty kitchen and then into her open bedroom door.
Draco’s nose wrinkled. “Don’t be sorry about him. He’s always like that. He’ll forget by Sunday brunch.”
“But—” Harry began, ready to rant about how plenty of young people were still prejudiced, how young people didn’t have political power yet, how they’d be constrained by the conservative nature of the Wizengamot…
, yes."
Albus was pacing; Scorpius was sat in an uncomfortable-looking chair bouncing his legs at an alarming rate. Ginny and Astoria stood leaning against the wall, smiling and talking.
Draco had been having thoughts about

"There's no winner, Dad—it's just for fun."
Hermione nods in concession. "He'd certainly know all about that."
Harry reached out and grabbed Draco's hand, threading their fingers together. "We're together."
Harry groaned. "Not a Howler, but based on them. Rump decided he hated the paper aeroplanes the Ministry uses because they looked 'girly.' He thought this fit better with his style." Having received more than his fair share of Howlers and Rumplers (as Harry called them, when safely out of earshot) over the years, he resignedly tapped it with his wand.
"Are you stalking him?" Ron interrupted.
Harry, listening, walked forward and sat at the table.
Draco reached an arm out and brought Lorraine and Harry into an impromptu huddle. “I need you to move all of Harry’s things from his room into my room. And his bathroom, too. James will be staying with us for a while, and we need him to think we were always staying in the same bedroom.”
Harry’s first thought (an unhelpful one, he was sure Penelope would say) was to roll his eyes and think how silly girls were for crying at fucking children’s films. But Harry ignored that impulse and just waited for her to continue.
Harry's not sure where his class is, and he isn't eager to continue sitting loudly
"Mostly it's a bunch of bullshit," Draco says, raising an eyebrow.
he?! What had Harry
The house was empty, and Harry was spiraling.
No winner. Preposterous. If he and Draco were going to play a game….for fuck's sake.
Scorpius and Draco stood looking down at Harry and Albus, on the floor covered in soot. In unison, they each held out a hand. It was like a scene out of some odd blond horror film.
Harry winces. He needs to just say it. "It's Malfoy."
"Oh, shut up," Draco grinned.
Harry takes a deep breath. "I keep dreaming about my parents, and about Remus and Sirius, who were like surrogate parents. And the dreams are nightmares, and they keep like, blowing up in flames or being snatched away, and it's so fucking cruel. I have
“Stop! Stop!” he cried. “I can’t!”
"That sounds nice," I say, imagining it, reveling in it. "We'd see each other years later and scowl at each other. Pretend that we didn't understand anything about each other."
Scorpius's big grey eyes slid to Harry.
Floo call. 5:15am. In the bedroom Floo, which only their children had access to, and which they never used because they worried about accidentally…. Which could only mean—
"Let me ask you this," Malfoy started to say, but his sparkling grey eyes were piercing into Harry's so intently that Harry, convinced Malfoy was about to cast
on a message to Fleur. "Don't you think people already know that you care about other issues? I mean, doesn't your record prove that? It's just that right now you're talking about this one thing."
Harry watched as one of them stuck its sucker thing into a chunk of mango. “Whenever I’m at the zoo, I wonder whether any of these animals have magic in them. They give me the same sense of wonder I get when I see magical things.”
Draco nodded. "I didn't—I didn't know. How are you not more paranoid about it? You don't seem to worry when you eat or drink in public."
Harry shook his head. "People suck. Also, I kind of hate the labels. That makes me old, doesn't it? I don't want to use any of them."
Hermione looked at him nervously over Goldie’s shoulder. Everyone always listened to Harry more than the others, which was preposterous because, really, this wasn’t even his thing, and yet the success of it would hinge on his retention of Hermione and Draco’s outrage.
James jumped out of his seat and high-fived Teddy. "Oh, brilliant. You're never going to get over how incredible I will be. I will be the new standard for all Weasley weddings."
Draco pressed his weight down again, and Harry whispered into Draco’s neck, “You have to admit, the skirt is pretty nice in this context.”
Harry picked at a thread on his jeans. He wasn’t an anxious person, but he always felt a bit anxious in here. “Happiness.”
Harry nods. "Sure." And the next minute, he's alone with a baby.
"You can ask me whatever you like." Draco stood and walked to Harry's bedroom door, reaching out to grab the moulding. He looked over his shoulder, said, "But I may choose not to answer," winked, and left.
"Of course they don't. Most people are mindless sheep. But we understand that, and surely Malfoy does, too." After a minute, she sighs. "But I guess this means I actually have to try to like, be
Harry's eyes widened. "He announced…his intention? Or announced that it's happening?"
"Either way," Draco said stoutly, internally damning himself for
"Excuse me," Harry said to the wizard who was bringing up the rear of the queue. "Are you waiting for the Azure Cup?"
Harry snorted. “Do you think I’m wrong?” he asked, head still resting in the hand propped up by his elbow.
“Imagine Greg learns to deal with his grief about Vince.”
Harry let himself flop back onto his pillows, looking up at the ceiling that, shortly after moving in, he'd charmed to mimic the sky, like the Great Hall. He'd also charmed his room to play the sounds of an English forest. It helped to keep him balanced, despite living in London, despite having a desk job that, more often than not, became awfully political.
like it, I think I might be offended."
“Hullo,” Malfoy said a minute later, entering the room. He looked tired.
Harry snorts, and rubs the back of his hand on his nose. “I don’t believe you.”
"Alright," Harry said. "Alright."
He just needs to make a decision, to find a place. Everything can fall into place once he decides on a thing to do. If he picks something, he can throw himself into that life; he can become a person who belongs there, wherever that is.
Nico's face fell like a sad Crup.
Harry, wondering how many '
For a brief second, it rankles. He's
"Second," Harry interrupted, "we need to get rid of all the 'he or she's in the party platform. It's offensive to all trans and non-binary people
He turns to look at her, cocking his head to show he's listening.
Draco shrugged, walking closer. "He belongs here when he needs you. They all do. But stop being so wet. It's a bad look on you, Potter."
Draco looked up, considered his location (passing the turn for the Rose Garden), then returned to composing his text.
you should show me where the item is that might be needed to save your life. Perhaps. If it's convenient for you."
“Is this a game in which all our ‘fun’ suggestions must start with the letter F?” Draco asked, amusement twinkling in his eyes.
“Stop looking at my arse!”
"Jelly-knees, fluttery stomach," he said. Something in his tone was raw, like he knew he was exposing himself.
There was a sign at his station reading, "Executive Order R.O.B.E.S.
Malfoy's fingers tighten, and Harry's head drops in pleasure to his shoulder. Maybe it's that there're no expectations. He doesn't expect anything from Malfoy, and Malfoy doesn't expect anything from him. There's no pressure to become a perfect family, to be good role models for the entire wizarding world. There's only orgasms. Or at least, presumably there will be orgasms. Not yet. Not right this minute, please.
"It made a difference," Hermione said, leaning forward. "We got everyone talking about the issues. We made sure people were talking about how racist and xenophobic Rump is." She frowned. "I have to believe it made some difference."
"Okay, what's going on?" Molly says, hand flying to her hip. "Is something wrong with my chicken? It seems fine to me, but Ginny and Harry are acting like it's undercooked."
Do you have any idea the people that ad would turn up? Sometimes I worry for your welfare. One of these days you’re going to write a memo and accidentally suggest to the entire Auror department that you’re looking for a golden shower.”
A tiny grin quirks the side of his mouth. "You don't get to say you have 'top marks' and then qualify it. You have top marks if you have top marks, and you don't. Hermione does."
"Harry," Parvati groaned, "what is up with these goras?!"
"Why wouldn't you just drink coffee if you want to be energetic?"
But Harry was overcome with laughter, leaning back on the tree, his sides hurting as he imagined a knowing, disapproving look on Narcissa’s face and Lucius collapsing onto the ground. Malfoy laughed with him. “Oh Merlin,” Harry said, reaching a hand up to wipe a tear at his eye, “that is the best thing I’ve ever envisioned.”
you fancy? What's your type, Harry Potter?"
"You think I would perform Legilimency, without consent, on the Saviour of the wizarding world, on the pavement in Diagon Alley."
Maybe he shouldn't have called her a bitch.

Harry rolled his eyes. There was no malice in Draco's words the way there would've been decades ago. "Yes, get on with it."

Malfoy started walking again, leading them up the stairs.
Harry slung his bag over his shoulder, said goodbye, and walked out of the classroom numb with the realisation that he didn’t have any wild dreams anymore. He didn’t have any dreams at all.
Harry was still in bed. “Yes, there’s a special outfit you have to buy. It has a kilt and a little matching jumper that says ‘zoo visitor’.”
Draco holds out his hand, wiggling his fingers impatiently. Harry hands him the paper and Draco sits on the sofa, crossing his legs and Summoning his glasses from the coffee table.
Harry blinked. “You made a real difference to this person.” The owl flew out with a farewell hoot.
“What do you think?” Draco asked, bringing a hand up to dramatically frame his face for inspection.
"Well, Voldemort's dead now, so…"
Harry peered over his shoulder to look at his arse, which had Draco’s handprints on it. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Draco’s skirt hiked up awkwardly on one side, and the letter on the sofa.
Malfoy heaves a dramatic sigh. "Well, there go my plans for the evening. How can I stay entertained without a Harry panic spiral?"
"Scorpius and Albus just Flooed—they're on their way over to listen to the Vow with 'us.' They assume we're listening together." Harry stared for a beat too long and Draco snapped his fingers. "So get your arse over here."
The Potions Imprimatur Grants and Injunctions Enumeration (PIGIE) was a piece of busy-work that had been assigned to Harry and Ron. They were supposed to update the list of registered potioneers and keep track of any questionable activity.
"You never do anything with grace," Draco teased. "But that's okay now that you're with me, because I have enough grace for both of us."
Potter, the noob, looks horrified. "
"Love doesn't wait for political timelines," Draco said, his voice sounding perfectly outraged that someone would question their relationship, despite the fact that their relationship was in fact a total farce.

) next to a silver stereo with a CD player and two cassette decks.
"Me?"
Draco stands, shucking his robes. "I didn't take lessons with Madam Thistlewaite for five years to be bested by a boy band dance. Rewind it, Granger."
Harry laid on the sofa staring at the chandelier. "I once watched Lee drink a cauldron of beer mixed with marshmallow fluff on a dare. I really don't think it matters how clean the house is."
"So did all of you," Ron said, grabbing his glass out of the air. "Cheers."
"Fat chance," Draco said, conjuring a chair and sitting. "But it's important to have it in writing, anyway." He leaned over Harry's draft and began to pore over it systematically. "We need to add a paragraph before you introduce this. Give me a quill."
“Yes,” she responded gravely.
"Because I know that every time you've yelled at me, I've deserved it." Malfoy holds his finger up to quell the possibility of interruption. "Which isn't to say that I was in the wrong! You always deserved it, too."
"To whom, exactly, does that make a point?" Draco asked, flopping into an armchair. "The great Harry Potter, beacon of the resistance, fighting evil by…not watching a Vow? Also, have you forgotten that they're showing it in hologram this year? We'll be watching, not listening."
"You weren't listening," Draco snapped, apparently annoyed at Harry's reaction. His foot was still, and Harry tucked away the observation that the foot tapping must indicate anxiety, not anger. "If we do this, I will
“Drooping already? Pitiful. You’re getting on in years.”
"We're in our primes," Draco objected with a genuinely aghast expression. "In the loo or like, hidden in an alcove or something? Or in your office?"
The problem with
Harry suspected his face looked the same.
“It very well may. Imaginative people always do seem to be sharers,” Malfoy said. “Good grief. We’re just going to have to embrace the chattiness, aren’t we? Unless you want to go our separate ways.”
That thought only lasted a moment, because his second thought was about yesterday's election. Rump had
wasn't
Harry rolls his eyes. "Yes, thanks for reminding me."
He stepped forward and touched Draco's arm. "I think you're forgetting that you're sleeping with the head of the DMLE." He had Draco's attention. "Help me figure out a way to make sure this doesn't result in prosecutions? I was thinking that, first, we can stall by saying we need a few months to draft a new policy. Then we can ask for an extension. Second, we can change the definition of 'reasonable grounds for suspicion' so that the use of foreign incantations isn't enough." Harry stopped. That was as far as he'd gotten. "What else?"
Harry spun around—Draco had just Apparated inside the front door.
Harry groaned so loudly he heard one of their owls squawk from the nook downstairs. "Please—
happy?"
"He'd
“Imagine something good happening to you. What first comes to mind?”
Parvati held up a finger. "Don't be judgy, Hazza; the porn industry pays really well."
“This is our first date!” Draco says, throwing a hand up.

He shrugs. "You'll never know."

"It's still matrimonial magic tying us together," Draco said, shaking his head. "What if it is changing our feelings? What if we don't understand entirely how it works? I can't—I can't be with you like this. It makes me feel like a piece of shit."

“I was always going to be a git, Potter. No potion can make me imagine otherwise.”
Draco flopped onto the sofa and said, beatifically, "You know, I think I understand it now."
There had been

Pomfrey puts a hand on her hip. “And how long has this been going on?”
“Auror Malfoy.” Robards stood. “For five years, you came to work wearing appropriate clothing. The day after the Ministry instituted a new dress code, you show up wearing clothes that, it is clear, were chosen
As such, Harry hasn't really had cause to consider whether the garments are attractive. Turns out they kind of are? And why has Harry been able to completely ignore the fact that he and Malfoy had

"What about Thompson?" Dennis asked, managing to look past Luna's feet and towards Draco. "Isn't he a
Harry picked up his cup and took a long sip. The coffee was complex, bitter but smooth, and Harry was sad that the cup was nearly finished.
"And when I was living here?" James asked, fingers tapping on his knee. "Because I can't decide if I was blind or if maybe you were, because you were so,
Annoyed, Draco dropped Harry's hand. "Long enough. Okay, Jordan?"
Malfoy deigns to turn slightly in his seat. "I imagine I'm here for the same reason you are: to continue my magical education."
"We hooked up in secret," Draco continued, "and we saw each other after in the course of our regular lives and it is currently in the process of slowly evolving into an actual relationship rather than just sex."
"Was it the clothes thing?" Scorpius asked, eyes wide.
"Alright," Lily said and clapped her hands decisively. "You've had your little fun. Now's the part where you laugh and we all guffaw about your prank."
In a way, Harry was lucky. There
Harry sat, content to watch as families and young couples and a grandmother with a toddler walked by. His mind wandered to the pregnancy for which Albus and Scorpius were setting up adoption. The baby was due to be born in the Spring, and Harry was so hoping that it wouldn’t fall through. He knew it was a tremendous disappointment any time a lead fell through. And a magical pregnancy in which the witch wanted to carry to term and put the baby up for adoption was
Draco's brow crinkled and he turned to look at Harry. "Which one?"
Harry thought for a moment. "Wag the Dog."
Harry frowns. Maybe he shouldn't have said that. Maybe this is a thing that sober Harry will not be happy about. "I said, have you ever kissed a boy?" Malfoy gapes like a fish for a moment, so Harry sighs and keeps talking. "I haven't. I think I want to. No, I mean, I definitely want to. But I've been pretending that's irrelevant for a couple years because I was fixated on Ginny. And Voldemort. Not that I wanted to kiss Voldemort! I mean, on not kissing him. On not getting killed by him, I mean. You know what I mean. It's just, now I have to deal with that too, on top of everything else." Why is he saying this to Malfoy?
The typical before-work crowd was queued up on the pavement, and Harry's eyes scanned the crowd for Malfoy's hair. Sure enough, there was Malfoy, near the back of the queue, and Harry walked straight towards him.
At least all this moving had distracted him from the uproar in the press about him and Draco dating. Even though Parvati's plan worked—that is, most of the response was excited and eager, rather than outraged or judgmental—it was still exhausting. Harry never liked being in the media spotlight.
Harry turned towards Albus and Scorpius in horror. "We are fifty-six years old!"
Harry shrugged. "I dunno, like the Muggles did in the '60s! Get a bunch of lovers to occupy the Ministry, making out? Just people snogging everywhere. Blocking the lifts with our lips. Throwing a…torque wrench in the works with our tongues. Obstructing oppression with our…"
"Sometime after he expressed interest and before we moved in together," Draco answered evasively.
Albus sent a message on his phone and they stood up, Scorpius giving hugs to Draco and Harry and Albus talking a mile a minute about when they'd next see each other. Then they stepped into the Floo and swirled away.
Molly's face turns from confused to concerned. "Was it a bad trial today, dear? Who was it—the young Malfoy, right?"
"I wanted to sit around doing nothing, playing a lot of Quidditch."
"Where are the kids?" Harry asked, passing out the sweets and Conjuring an apple for Draco.
"Don't apologise," Malfoy rasps, tugging him back down. "Do it again."
“Good grief, I should’ve worn a skirt years ago. The patriarchy would’ve been immediately clear, and I wouldn’t have had to do all that reading about feminism and miswitchgyny.”
, Draco. You're part of it. If I have to deal with making choices in the context of a bunch of shit I didn't choose, you have to deal with it too. The solution isn't to tell me that I can't make the choice I want now."
"If you seek beneath our floors, a treasure—" the goblin paused for effect, "or dragon! That was never yours. Thief, you have been warned, beware. We recognise your hair. We will escort you to your place, and never take our eyes off your face."
"It happens a lot when parents let themselves lose their identity. When they settle into middle age with kids," Albus said. "You let your interests go, then your kids leave and…you know."
"Shut up, Potter."
She lowers the parchment and looks pointedly at him. "Yes. That's no problem, is it? Unless there's a reason you're not telling me why we need to exclude someone."
"Hey, Mi?"
Hermione stood next to him, nodding enthusiastically. “I do not
Harry snorted and sat down next to Malfoy. “What about you? Isn’t that your problem, too? Not using enough imagination when thinking about how to deal with your parents? I mean, can you just imagine yourself saying ‘Fuck you’ to them?”
"Auror Potter to the rescue." Draco's sarcastic tone was sour enough to etch metal.
"We definitely need to ask your elves what that spell is," Harry says through a mouthful of tough lamb.
"Fine," Harry says, feeling helpless for about the millionth time in his life. "We'll talk after dinner?"

you?"
“Only because you were wagging it in my face all day, Potter.” Draco didn’t miss a beat. He never did.
Draco stepped forward, leaning over to inspect them. “They’re exquisite.”
Ginny put her hand on her hip. "Erm, I'm starting to feel slighted."
“Trying to build a case against Anouska Rump. Well, trying to build a case to show that she is making money off Daddy Norris’s Ministry.”
"Of course you can," Harry agreed, thinking of the entire bedroom that Draco had been steadily filling with baby items. When Harry had confronted him about it, Draco had testily replied that he wasn't buying anything for the baby
Potter's mouth twists. "He was using it to pull a boat out of a pool of Inferi."
fall in love with someone, but be stuck with me…for politics?"
Malfoy blinks. "It seems somewhat risky to engage in that sort of activity with someone who will be a classmate for the next few years. Because we'll need to continue to be cordial, no matter what happens."
"Malfoy!" Harry cried, throwing one hand in the air, which he immediately realised was probably more dramatic than he should be aiming for. He brought his arm down abruptly.
You're just intellectualising."
James and Lily.
Hermione and Draco each picked up a folder, no doubt filled with research and notes prepared for this very meeting, and marched promptly to Robards’s office.
Robards walked into the room and clapped his hands. “Attention!”
“Well it does no use to dwell on it,” Draco says.
doing it because of expectations."
"You know," she continued, "imagination is like a muscle. Often, with disuse, it withers as we grow up. All the weight of society's expectations of 'acting like a grown-up' beat it out of us. In your cases, you were forced to grow up even more abruptly than most people, because of the war. And sometimes, like Draco said, we intentionally keep it weak, like a defence mechanism, because if we don't dream, we can't fail to achieve our dreams."
! It makes me feel like I'm living in a hotel."
Diagon was crowded, but somewhat quiet. Harry expected that most of the people here had voted for Penelope. While the righter, wealthier, older, pure-blood magical people tended to live in country estates, coming to Diagon to shop and occasionally to dine or partake of the theater, many of the younger and more liberal magical people lived right in Diagon. It was the most leftist district by vote.
Draco looks at him steadily, then forks a bite of curry and holds it out for Harry. Harry bites the lamb off the fork and chews.
The rest of the group wasn't quite so convinced. They looked at Hermione and Harry with a mixture of curiosity, confusion, and bitterness. Draco supposed that one's children, in general, weren't as excited as one's best friend to learn of one's great romance.
Ron launched into a story about how Rose was reacting to the election, and Harry walked over to Draco to help him with the drinks. Harry supposed he could just imitate what Draco was doing. That'd be enough.
If there were any way to prevent the shit of the outside world from crashing in on his life, Harry would do it. He would do all sorts of inadvisable things, if he could get that.
Draco's face froze; he seemed to realise at the same moment. He searched Harry's face—for what, Harry didn't know.
Malfoy sighed, but pulled his and a quill out of his robe pocket. Harry had his parchment, but had to Conjure a quill. It would probably break two minutes into using it; Conjured quills were shite.
"Yes, you look smashing." Draco dropped his hands as he looked around the office. "What are you doing, packing up all evidence of your years of wrongdoing?"
wanted. And it made his skin crawl to think about starting a conversation only for Draco to tell him, "No, I just want to be married. I don't want to have sex. I don't want to be in a relationship with you." Would it even be fair to put Draco in that position, by bringing it up?
Then, brilliant light through my closed eyes. Sea air, relieved shouts in the distance, the voice of the house-elf.
them twice. And neither time I consumed a love potion ended in sex, so that'd be classified as 'attempted sexual assault,' which is included in that 2% of cis wizards you mentioned, right?"
"I was done!" Harry pushes himself up to his knees.
Harry rolled onto his stomach, burying his face half into the pillow and half into Draco's arm. "That was one of the worst things that has ever happened to me."
I gape at him. He's actually worried about the rat. I don't know whether to dwell on that, or the fact that he's just praised my Transfiguration skill. "Sure thing, Potter. I'll try not to hurt
"I'm leaving if you use the word 'sired' again," Hermione said, grinning, sipping her mineral water.
wants to be my friend!'" During this little speech, Malfoy bats his eyes a lot, like he's imitating a young girl with a crush.
"This has to be the most inane song ever written." Harry squints, trying to tell the difference between the two smaller brown-haired Backstreet Boys.
Harry’s heart thumped, and he felt his cheeks heat as he said, “Yeah. I’ll grab it for you.”
Harry reached into his bag and pulled out the parchment, handing it over at the same time as Malfoy. For the first time that day, they made eye contact. Harry wasn't sure what he'd expected to see there, but Malfoy just looked tired.
"And what happens at home is
The light changed, and they joined a group of people crossing the street, heading down to the path on the canal. “You’re—
"How can I shut up?" Malfoy squeals, spinning a lovestruck pirouette. "Harry Potter wants to be my frieeeeeeend!"
was that?" Draco asked, bewildered.
“Don’t bother.” Draco closed his eyes in resignation. “This way we know that the cardboard is Vanished properly. Plus, who am I to rob him of the joy of showing me the newest addition to his Martin Miggs Funko Pop collection? And his battery-powered massaging back pillow?”
I shake my head. "No. They said he's on another continent and it will take him a while to get back. He can't alert the authorities to his arrival, and you know how international borders are."
“Yeah, Potter. You know, me too.”
“I can’t believe you were going to go on a date with me while hiccoughing every five seconds! What were you planning to do, just hiccough forever?”
Potter catches my eye, then looks away. "Cheers," he says. The wry tone is characteristic of Potter, but here, now, it sounds resigned. I don't like it.
Harry read it three times. It was such a
He somehow manages to down a vial of Hangover Potion, get dressed, and survive breakfast with Hermione—she's giving him this look like she knows he had sex with Malfoy, but she refuses to ask, and Harry's sure his face is saying that he had sex with Malfoy, but he refuses to tell. So they sit there in a stalemate, talking idly about marmalade.
"Dittany's hardly rubbish," I point out. I used to beg my mother to buy me dittany to heal my acne, but she claimed it was too rare and expensive to be used for acne. I'd told her, what good is wealth, if it can't be spent? She held her ground but bought it for me the next Christmas.
Harry turned, Draco following closely, and Rump started talking, trying to get in the last word, but Harry walked swiftly out of the office, not slowing until he was out of the entire department. Out of breath, he paused, then felt Draco's hand on his shoulder, nudging him forward. Harry, ears ringing, allowed himself to be steered, overcome with anger and annoyance and absolute disgust that people had
Parvati looked back at them. "Don't mention it, Harry. This will be fun!"
"Just what everyone wants to hear from their lover," Draco drawled, pretending not to be amused. "That their value resides in their ability to distract."
"Will you shut up?"
Malfoy narrows his eyes. "You're making fun of me."
"Doesn't seem quite likely." Draco popped a cherry into his mouth. He didn't want to brood about his parents—Merlin knew he'd done enough of that in therapy in the noughties. "Anyway, how's the little light of my life?"
Harry isn't being careful with Malfoy.
They down their shots and Harry leads Malfoy back to the general vicinity where he left Hermione. He finds her leading a small conga line around the back corner of the room while the speakers blast Brandy and Monica's "The Boy is Mine."
“Huh? Oh, cause I’m bi,” Harry said. He almost didn’t say anything else, but then he had this vision of it maybe going well if he said what he wanted to, and he added, “Were you joking before, about being gay? Was that just you trying to list all the things you thought would shock your parents?”
"Oh, fuck you," Harry sneers. "You want me to feel sorry for you, for all that horrible privilege you have?"
"The one to crack the nut. The hard nuts that no one else can handle."
Draco's eyes scanned Harry. "Yes, I agree with you, it won't be easy. We're just going to act the part. Close your eyes and pretend I'm…whomever it is you fancy." He paused and cocked his head with interest. "Whom

Harry looks into the bag, pulls out a little modern clock and Levitates it to Draco's mantel. "I got you this because you're always needing to cast
"But what if my new favourite pastime is distracting you?" Draco asks, crowding against Harry's back and sticking his pointy nose into Harry's neck. "You get so adorable when you're annoyed."
Harry dropped to his left knee, still rubbing his right. "Okay Al, listen, first things first. If a baby doesn't stop crying when you've tried milk and nappy and whatever else, strip them naked and make sure there's nothing going on that you couldn't see—like a hair wrapped around their finger or something." Harry had once been traumatised by a photo of a "hair tourniquet"; it haunted him, which had the benefit of meaning he would never forget.
"Draco?"
bothering me? The world is going up in flames, and not the good kind of flames that once reduced an unethical rag to ash."
"What designer are you wearing, Harry?!"
The music stayed on, but everyone seemed to reach a temporary truce in which they would ignore it. Harry, looking pointedly at his gingerbread, grinned.
But Harry didn't know what Draco

But today, he was annoyed; he wanted to get home. He wanted to rant and complain to Harry. Today the crowds of holiday shoppers in Diagon felt like an impediment rather than a joyful backdrop.
? Draco thought, mentally berating himself. Who thought words like that? Good grief.
Ron turned, a wide grin on his face, and his eyes dropped to Harry's legs. He thrust a finger towards Harry and shouted, "You vixen!"
"What, like he just stood up and left the table without saying a word?" Hermione asked. "That is odd."
"Butter alternative. The puzzles are always asking that clue. Ridiculous, really."
“I’m imagining my parents weren’t such blood purists and you and I both got Sorted in Hufflepuff.”
"Too right," I agree, looking over at it with distaste. "We could Vanish it, I suppose, now we have your fancy chain."
For a few long minutes, no one spoke. Harry took a deep breath. These moments—waiting, the cusp of life—always shook him. Waiting. It reminded him of Sirius and the way time had seemed to slow as he disappeared behind the veil. It reminded him of waiting every time someone was injured in the war; waiting, every time an Auror was injured on the job; waiting, Ginny, holding her breath and pushing, and then James, sucking in the first breath of life; the moment when Snape's soul left his eyes; waiting in the corridor with Hermione waiting for her dad to die, comforting her as they stood waiting, waiting and listening to his rattling breath hold onto life a little longer; the time his and Ginny's old cat had gone to bed one night and, in the morning, there'd been five kittens in the bed with her; King's Cross station; the day Harry had pulled Lily out of the water and time had stopped as he slapped her on the back before she inhaled an enormous, shuddering breath—
Harry laughs, and shoves Draco hard enough to knock him over.
Harry was an

Harry reached up and threaded his fingers into Draco's hair, overcome with this reality. He wondered when Draco had started looking at him like that, but he couldn't remember. He wondered when
Harry snorted. "Yeah alright. It's late. We should go to—"
Rump's office looked much the same as it had when Kingsley had been in office, but the atmosphere could not have been more different. Everyone there always seemed to be walking on eggshells—a state of affairs Harry was proud to report never prevailed in the DMLE under his leadership. Rump, on the other hand, sacked his assistants so often Harry had never met the same one twice.
He grabbed his wand off the side table and Summoned his phone. It had taken him awhile, after receiving the phone as a gift from James a decade or so ago ("Because
He stood in the entrance hall, alone. Draco's house had never felt unwelcoming before, but then he'd never been here without Draco.
Harry was looking at Draco, but Draco didn't turn his head. "I agreed," Harry said quietly, "because he was right. That's what I thought—he's right. If Draco ran, and if he were married to me, I thought—he'd win."
"Hey," Bill said, pushing his seat back from the table. "Come look at this addition I just put on Dominique's room—you'll love the Quidditch mobile I hung."
"Oh, Harry."
Harry nods. "You'll be okay?" he asks her. He feels like he's doing something rebellious and wonders how badly Hermione is judging him right now for
Harry glared. "So the solution to having feelings is to run away from them? Is that what you'd tell Scorpius to do?"
Hermione had then shown up with a box of magical pride paints that would take on the stripes of different pride flags when you smeared them onto something. Draco grabbed the bottle with the bi colors, covered his hands in it, snuck up behind Harry, and pressed his hands onto Harry's cutoff-clad arse.
I sigh with some drama. I think of the last year, of being stuck in this house, worried that I'd get raped by Death Eaters, or bitten by a werewolf, or killed on the Dark Lord's whim. I think of watching Professor Burbage's lifeless body fall to the table on which I've eaten Christmas geese. Hating Potter is a vague memory, fading away behind all that. Like an old pair of shoes that I remember loving, but that no longer fit. "I don't hate you, Potter. Though you are, of course, eminently annoying."
"Good day," Draco said with Dickensian flair.
"Well, go ahead. This is the first I'm hearing that things aren't good between us. So let's be honest now." Harry was aggressive during conflicts. Draco knew this, of course, but it really had been a long time. "Also," Harry continued, "I think I've been pretty honest—before we got married, I
Draco snorted. “Have you suddenly developed an interest in financial graft?”
Teddy laughed. He worked at an LGBTQ organisation that worked to improve the social, political, and legal position of queer wix in Britain; he'd been teaching a unit on sexuality and gender to sixth- and seventh-year Hogwarts students every spring for the past seven years or so.
Harry pointed at Malfoy and started laughing. “Why can’t we shut up?”
“Tam kicked me out. It’s—it’s fine. It’s not a big deal.”
"Only clothes, nappies," Harry said, unable to help himself, "cot, Flooster, bibs, blankets, milk replicating kit and bottles, a bathtub, that magical mucous-sucker thing, magic-dampening mattress…"
Looking around the room, Harry asked, "Where's the mum?" turning towards the midwife.
Draco’s cheeks heat. “I’ve told you multiple times: I do not have a thing for the axe aesthetic.”

Harry tilted his head back, hoping that would encourage Draco to continue whatever he was doing to Harry's neck. "Look," Harry said, trying to affect a pedantic tone, "I only like to be impaled on knobs under the right circumstances, for example, with proper consent and forewarning, and preferably when it won't result in an accidental self-cleaning cycle."
Azure Cup. There's no article."
"Between you and your Mum, you did for sure," Harry said, lost in a haze of memory. It was strange—being here again, in a different role. It was exciting, but in a way where he wasn't sure exactly
Hermione and Draco had been paired as Auror partners directly out of training. Neither of them had been particularly happy about it at first, but Harry begrudgingly had to hand it to Robards—they were a perfect partnership. Harry could never be paired with either of them—they were both much too high energy. Hermione took extreme risks and would not listen to reason (Harry and Ron often reminisced about the time they tried to talk her out of making Polyjuice and she didn’t listen and ended up half-feline). And Draco was a ball of nervous energy, getting caught up on small details of cases that were completely irrelevant (most of the time; sometimes his obsessions solve cases) and refusing to do work as assigned. Together, they worked each other into frenzies, falling asleep at their desks and reading aloud from obscure Latin grimoires in the Ministry library.
Malfoy snorted, then took a sip of his drink.
"I'm not wearing a cummerbund again," Albus declared, turning to Harry with fierce eyes. "And I'm not doing anything with garter belts."
“Yes,” she said, just like that. “And you’ve each done good and bad things to each other, and you each suffered in the war. So you are each in a position to respect what the other is going through.”
"Can you come outside with me? I want to talk to you."
quickly. He and Hermione take to the dance floor and start dancing like idiots to Madonna's "Ray of Light." Harry normally isn't much for dancing, but he doesn't know anyone here, and he's got all this pent up anger and emotion to get out, and Hermione is doing some terrible disco moves, so Harry lets loose, laughing hysterically as Hermione spins him, his head continuing to spiral long after his body is stationary.
in my home?"
Draco winces sympathetically. "Did Ginny forgive you for acting like—that—about the baby?"
Jorgen paused, unsure what to do, so Harry yanked Wilhelm off the wooden base, allowing Jorgen to put the rest of the clock into the bag.
Harry jolted up in bed, heart pounding. He honestly couldn't believe it. They'd all been so sure that Penelope would win. The polls had all showed—
"I don't hate you, Malfoy," Potter says, eyes flitting around the cellar. "Everyone upstairs would kill me given half a chance. You wouldn't."
Harry felt an urge to defend Draco, but, not wanting to screw this up, he ran it through his mind first—is that what he would do if he were in love with Draco? Seemed likely. "Look, I know it's hard to believe," Harry said, concentrating his attention on Albus and Scorpius, who surely had the most reason to be upset about this. "And we're sorry if this causes any of you grief or worry. But it's really our concern, not yours."
Now Draco, Scorpius, and Albus looked down at Harry.
Harry, stoutly, ignores her. "I just—I thought we
Draco raised an eyebrow. "The fact that you just asked that question tells me that you're getting a better deal out of this farce of a relationship than I am."

"Would you like me to keep talking?" Malfoy exhales shakily. "I'm sorry for calling you a—an m-word. I should've intervened when Bellatrix tortured you. I didn't know how, but I should've done
"Dad!"
“Do you want a
"Oh, it's done," James said, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. "It's mine. They adjusted the wards and everything."
“No. Can you imagine me grading papers?”
Harry scanned the policy again. "They've written this so that I can't even talk to the press as Harry Potter with an asterisk clarifying that my thoughts are my own and not representative of the DMLE or the government. They've made it so that I can't talk as a public persona
"One hundred percent honesty, we said. Necessary for a real relationship, we said," Harry jokingly prodded. But then he seemed to have an attack of morality and added, "But only if you want to."
Harry scooched himself up and whispered, "Can I tell you a secret?" in Draco's ear.
The queue outside Azure Cup was a bit shorter than the last time he visited, and Harry fell into the queue, eager to see the place again and to savour his morning cup. The witch in front of him wore a tall pointy hat, the type that made Muggleborns snicker and say, "I'll get you my pretty!" She was Levitating a bunch of tarot cards in the air around her head. The cards danced around, changing places, until finally a card with two naked people on it that read "THE LOVERS" rose higher than the rest, higher even than the tip of her hat. At that, she swore, and, grumbling all the while, with a wave of her wand, collected the cards in a neat stack.
"Stop complaining and come eat some cheese."
Harry."
"Holy fuck, Potter," Draco whispered eventually, bringing up a hand to run through Harry's wild hair.
, Draco's mind supplied. But it had to be more than that, didn't it? Harry had been loved. That wasn't new. Draco squirmed.
this. He
"Because what good does getting thrown into a Ministry holding cell do?" Harry asked, but he already basically agreed with Albus—he was going through the motions of the discussion now.
"Not a bond, just a vow." Draco searched Harry's face for something. "I mean, if you agree."
When they returned, Ginny and Astoria were alone—Ginny looking nervous, Astoria stiff, as they stared at the closed door.
"Well, I could," Draco's green-flame face said. "Except Scorpius seems to think that we need to be there for each other in this hour of need, or something, and presumably you, as my partner, would also want us to be there for each other, in this, our hour of fucking need." He paused, then added, "Bring your work over, if you want."
Harry had tuned her right out, but he was glad her workshop had been before his so at least he had a general idea of what to expect.
Shout out to partialtopotter's
Shit shit shit shit, that voice was Draco’s. No one else in the office had that kind of posh drawl. Well, except for Macmillan and Smyth and Jones and Rogers—but none of them sounded like Draco.
like unwanted guests into one's home, knocking things over unrepentantly, opening cabinets and stealing. Potter, in contrast, walks in politely, waiting for me to wave him inside. I try not to be charmed.
The others sounded a cacophony of congratulations—James Summoned a bottle of champagne and popped it.
"I suppose that'll do." Draco crossed one leg over the other. "I thought you meant you were going to linger around me, like leaning languidly nearby me."
"Don't make fun of me!" Harry laughed.
Draco looked down at his clothes, horrified. “Oh Circe’s arse, he’s right.”
Albus turned to Harry. "No, she won't—she pushes it right out of her mouth with her tongue! What the fuck, right? Like, come on Aster, you need to eat to live!"
Draco pulled back and kissed him. It wasn't the first time, not by a long shot, but if you asked Draco about their first kiss, this was the one he'd think of, from now on. He hadn't felt this vulnerable in a long, long time. And not because he was on truth serum; he had no worries about revealing anything to Harry. Harry already knew all the bad shit, and the good shit, miraculously, didn't need to be hidden anymore.
Draco slumped forward over the table. "It's not the sex," he said, and once he'd started the thought, the Veritaserum dragged the rest of it from him, "it's the love. Or maybe it's the sex combined with the love. I'm not sure—it's possible I've been in love with you for a long time, on some level. But there was no intimacy there, so it was easy to hold the feelings at wand's length. But I'm only human! I can't keep it under control with you looking into my eyes while you orgasm all over me!"
Malfoy, after flicking his haughty gaze to Harry, sat even taller.
"Dad," Albus cut him off, "we can get whatever we really need after."
It wasn't until the next morning that Harry realised he'd made a mistake.
"What sex have you enjoyed the most?"
Hermione waved a hand. “Well, now you’re committed to the cause. So tomorrow—”
He intended to laugh, but what came out didn't sound right. A kind of nasal honk. "Yeah, I know. I just—" He sighed, running a hand over his face. "I know you didn't used to believe this, but I really have always hated the spotlight. I hated it when I was eleven and I hate it now. I hate when I have to do things—important things that I can't refuse—and the way I have to do them is by putting myself in the middle of everything. I'm much happier hanging out at the zoo, or sitting back and doing whatever Hermione delegates to me. I should be used to it by now, but, I guess…it always takes me a few minutes to gather myself."
“Yesterday at breakfast.”
"Was that Backstreet Boys?" Harry asks, momentarily distracted and trying to place which song it was so he can torture Draco about it forever. "You know what, nevermind." He needs to focus.
and he's going to
"Fuck if I know, Malfoy." Potter sighs. "I can't even figure out what to do with myself, much less other people. You'll have to decide."
"Thanks, Potter. Very helpful." Draco closes his eyes and casts, and Harry watches with interest as the fork transfigures.
"Albus," Draco said, beyond Albus's view, "come through."
She turns towards him, crossing her legs. "Go on."
"What do we do now?" Hermione asked, looking uncharacteristically lost. Harry understood how she felt.
It's not an apology. I can't ever apologise for what I've done.
Draco sighs and leans against the counter. He’s wrapped all the gifts, following Harry’s daft Hogwarts-house-colour wrapping scheme, he’s cleaned the kitchen, he’s organised a drawerful of coupons (how did they end up with dozens of coupons for Fortescue’s peppermint chocolate holiday flavour?). The shopping is done, the gifts piled into stacks based on where they need to go—one huge stack for the Burrow; one small stack for the Manor; one stack Shrunken and packaged to post to Albus and Scorpius in California; the rest of their children’s and grandchildren’s gifts—and Harry’s gifts—under the tree.
doesn’t mean Harry is in charge of Draco’s health maintenance and Healer appointments.
(Everything wrong with me, according to my father, is a lack of strength and discipline.)
Fuck, he would never fall asleep in bed with Draco.
"You want to go to the lake or the Quidditch pitch? Or just wander?" Harry asked, feeling incredibly awkward. He stuffed his hands into his robe pockets.
And not everyone is, not everyone survived—but this is a lot of people, and they're here, and alive, and maybe broken, but they're here.
"Say congratulations to the next Minister of Magic, husband," Draco said, face lit up with a smile, and clinked Harry's glass.
"Quite right," Draco echoed. "At some point you need to stop caring what other people think about you and do what makes you happy and fulfilled."
"I didn't mean—I mean,
"No, listen, Potter. I don't care about the baby. That baby was never a person, was never going to be a person. I care about
"I know," Harry says, and he's grateful for Ron's support, he really is. But he still needs to get out of here.
Funny how easy it was to slip into old family patterns—even now. Harry nodded. "Sure. Draco, come with me, you can pay."
Draco jolted away. "What are you doing?"
you haven't made potions in years, as far as I can see. I will tell Lils you're thinking about her."
"It's from algae. Or spirulina, or something."
Before Harry could respond, Teddy burst out laughing. When all eyes in the room turned to him, he started laughing harder. "I'm sorry—it's just—oh, Merlin." He pushed his curly turquoise hair out of his eyes. "It's just—I suddenly get it. You two. Together."
“What!?” Draco hisses.
"Do you expect me to hang that—that
Wilhelm pointed his little axe at Harry. "All I'm saying, lad, is that it's happening in ten minutes. What you do with that information is up to you, as always. All I do is give you timely reminders. No need to AK the messenger." He swung the axe onto his shoulder.
Draco looked up, either to scowl at the mistletoe or to seek strength from a higher power, then looked back down, took Harry's face in his hands, and kissed him.
Harry brightened. "But really the entire interview would be stuffed with political positions?"
. Harry's life was his kids, and the Weasleys, and his work. Mostly his kids.
The crowds are insane—long queues of people waiting for almost every game.
This motley group was an improvement over Harry's usual Ministry meetings, too. They were much more engaging. They weren't all career bureaucrats; many ages and viewpoints were represented. Before long, they'd made a list of the most vulnerable groups (magical refugees, immigrants, people with non-Western cultural ties, poor Muggleborns, people with housing insecurity, Squibs, non-English-speaking magical people, werewolves and other beings with "creature" status) and strategies for outreach to each group. Harry's input wasn't needed for any of this—it didn't involve magical law enforcement or require his Saviour persona. He listened raptly, though, at one point wrapping an arm around Albus's shoulder and taking comfort in the close press of his son.
Draco's foot paused. "It's
Draco cranes his neck to look at Harry. "I was waiting for you, you nitwit. Get over here."
"Hello," Draco said, still feeling like a bit of an intruder on these Very Potter Family Moments. (Though less than he used to, he supposed.)
but what is real. And I honestly thought that was the end of it." Harry's eyes sought out Lily's. "Because it was real. It's real now. I'm being me, Lils. It's so fucking real. Not lying to you."
"Quite right. In any case, how will we handle hypothetical…"
Harry laughed. “Why?”
Harry lets his cheek drop to his hand and, amused, motions for Malfoy to ask away. This is his life now: Muggle consultant to Draco Malfoy.
Draco blinked. "You…enjoyed kissing me."
For some reason, though, I can sense Potter's magic easily enough. It's like kneeling next to a sun, which pisses me off. I hate being outshone. He shifts and his shoulder presses into mine, and—I can visualise it. There's our magic, but then there's a bright conduit of magic in the wall. It must be some kind of nexus, where all the different strands of magic in the house intersect. I don't know anything about house magic. My father would laugh if he knew this would be the thing to doom me. He'd always tried to convince me it was important, and damn him for being right.
Of course, Harry had to ask it as a question. Of course, the Veritaserum made Draco answer. He looked at his hands; the truth serum, at least, couldn't compel eye contact. "I don't deserve happiness. I don't deserve to be with you."
“Awww,” Harry teased. “I’ve always found you annoying, too.”
? Just because we never went through a phase of infatuation and tearing off each other's clothes? Give me a break. We're adults. We've both been married and divorced. We both understand that infatuation wears off and what's left—what's at the core of a relationship—is simply being there, day after day." He paused for a moment, then added, "So there's no reason to think you're lying to your children."
"Well," James said. "At least this has been more entertaining than talking about politics, which is all anyone ever seems to do these days."
Draco gestured at the wineglass. “I already have a drink.” He peered toward the staircase. “Do you think James has plans this weekend, or…?”
Harry strode forward, a big smile plastered on his face. He was certain that he wasn't as skilled as Draco at making a fake smile look genuine, but he did his best.
Draco finishes the mousse before Harry finishes the pie, which doesn't seem fair, since Harry's dish is practical and Draco's is decidedly impractical. Draco then decides that the best use of his time is hovering over Harry's shoulder, asking dozens of questions about root vegetables and knife technique.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry watches a girl with emo hair grab Malfoy's arm and start dancing with him, which Harry finds intensely amusing. Hermione and Harry twirl each other around, jumping around the crowded dance floor like a pair of buffoons, while Malfoy slightly awkwardly dances with the Muggle girl in a Ramones t-shirt. At one point, Harry thinks he might fall over if it weren't for Hermione's hand on his hip. But then Hermione is pulling out her Nokia and walking away, frowning at the screen, taking Harry's hand off her shoulder and placing it on Malfoy's.
Hermione, wearing what appeared to be a burlap sack, walked in behind him.
"Hey, Harry?"
"I'm fine," I claim, sure I still look green from the nausea. "It was not pleasant, but I'm not dead."
"What's her name?" Draco asked, his voice cracking. "Or are you going to continue torturing us by withholding that information?"
"Restore it from what?" Albus asked, incensed already.
Draco blinked. He and Harry quickly glanced at each other, and Draco could barely think. He let out a shaky laugh, his heart racing. "Oh, but—"
"Yes, Potter," Malfoy announces, arranging his face into stoic determination. "Good grief. Let's go."
Draco's face flushed a bit. "Well. Yes, I suppose." He stepped up to Harry, put his hands on Harry's shoulders. "How are you?"
Draco waved a hand, unwilling to explain the mind-numbing intricacies of Malfoy estate planning to anyone in this world, much less Harry, whom he
Draco reaches for Harry's face and tugs him down, as if in answer to the question, so Harry takes that as his cue to gently knee him in the balls.
"Do you want our first time kissing to be in front of all our children as we try to convince them that we fell in love?"
"I wish I could tell him it's an irrational fear, but…" Harry trailed off and looked around the restaurant, at the people on the street. "Did you request this table to be most visible? Is this part of your plan?"
"Waiting for the other shoe to drop," Harry said, shrugging. "Is it on the Prophet app? I turned my phone off."
Harry didn't waste a moment, and it was a quick, awkward tangle of rotating limbs and dislodging, squelching, bobbing penises, and then Harry loomed over him—grinning, cheeks red, eyes bright, hair a mess—and pressed inside. Draco's back arched off the bed as Harry thrust into him. Draco liked being in charge, but—and he could admit this here, with Harry, in the bedroom—sometimes he liked it even more when he didn't have to be.
"Indeed," Draco said, without missing a beat.
It was mesmerising, watching the Muggles skating up and down, stopping at the top on the edge. Harry wondered what that edge was called.
That was the thing about kids. You had them, and then you didn't. They needed you, and then they didn't. They
"Oh, shut it. And yes, didn't you?"
Albus nodded, distractedly. "We'll see you this weekend?"
Harry deflates as the world comes crashing back in. He slumps onto the arm of the sofa. "Ron—" Harry starts, his voice tired, but Hermione interrupts.
"For fuck's sake!" Harry spluttered, getting crumbs everywhere. "No. Our goal is not to revitalise the porn industry."
"Be my guest." Harry spins around and whispers, "I love it when she does all the work" to Draco.
"I literally just told you."
Harry flips the canvas around. "Alright, open."
like angry Harry who killed the Dark Lord, and try to use me to forget about whatever's bothering you." Draco leans forward, eyes challenging. "Talk to me."
When they rounded the corner, Harry, then Draco, froze. On the sofa, facing them, were Scorpius, Albus, James, Teddy, Lily, and Nico. And then, really topping off the sense of impending doom, on the surrounding chairs sat Hermione, Ron, and, glaring daggers, Pansy Parkinson.
“No, the
Draco smiled, uncharacteristically allowing himself the tiniest measure of pride at his new position. Pride was toxic to the Malfoy constitution. Pride was like—like an addictive potion. Like heroin.
Harry stood in the vestibule staring at the place from which James and Lorraine had Disapparated.
Harry pours himself a cup of tea from the blue teapot they'd bought for £5 from a street vendor in Brick Lane and sits next to Hermione, who's curled up on the sofa with a book the size of a CPU tower.
"You are," Draco said, reaching to pinch his nose, "without a doubt, one of the most infuriating people I've ever met." He sighed and returned his gaze to meet Harry's eyes. "Thank you, I suppose. I enjoyed kissing you, too. Was there anything else?"
"Why did you run away yesterday?" Harry demanded.
"Scorp did," Albus confirmed. "Don't take it personally. You know how it is—sometimes you just want your mum. I think she was the worst grandparent to call, though."
Hermione stands. "How do you know, Malfoy? Maybe Harry's parents didn't die in the normal dimension. Maybe they travelled to another galaxy and are stuck there."
