cruel,” Harry agreed. “Cruelty came so easy to him and that worries me. It crossed a line in my own morality, whether it’s a hypocritical one or not.”
Hold folded her hands underneath her chin as she regarded Harry carefully. “I told the Aurors all I could legally and ethically divulge. Anything outside of that you’ll need a court order from the Wizengamot.”
“I love you too, Draco,” Harry choked out, eyes roaming Draco’s face, as if he was mesmerized by what he saw there.
Severus shook his head as he raised an uncertain hand. “I used to think that, but as we got older, it was clear that his problem with me was a mixture. Oh, I’m sure he was spineless enough to do whatever Potter wanted, but he didn’t like my family.”
“I don’t have much time, and it’s already wasted on you,” Draco drawled before he looked up at an arched ceiling where Lorian was levitating. “Quit the theatrics.”
Draco shook his head, the action slow and lethargic as the magic kept up a steady stream into him. “But that would mean—” he frowned; brows still merged. “You
“Tomorrow, Lucius wants an update and I’m going to have to tell him that I have nothing. Not a single thing to offer.”
“The only thing you care about is Grimmauld Place. You want a secure headquarters and that’s all I am to you, a means to an end. You know that if I denounced all of this, Harry would come with me.”
Malfoy’s hands moved upward on Harry’s chest and he mirrored the action. When Malfoy pinched a nipple, Harry gasped, arching into Malfoy and he knew he wouldn’t last.
It still blew his mind that so many people wanted to hear him talk about his life. He had known from the beginning that he could pull it off. Had always known he had more charm than everyone else on the internet. His little tellies were clearly superior.
“And just who might you be?” A new voice asked. It was gruffed out, tone managing to be accusing and questioning at the same time.
When Draco’s mouth trailed up to Potter’s ear and nipped it, he could feel a full-body shiver against him. Sensitive, he liked that.
“You can always blame me,” Draco murmured. He could handle the fallout, could handle the brunt of everything in the end. Better him than Harry.
“His healer?” Lucius sat up straighter. “Why would they suggest a painting? Surely, they knew he was afraid of them.”
“Your vital signs are good; the medicine we gave you seems to be working as it should. There were no long-lasting repercussions, and I’ve got a potion script for your headaches so you won’t have to be careless and use experimental spells.  Now, have you been experiencing any side-effects?”
“Can we make it quick?” Ron asked as he checked the time. “I’ve got a nap scheduled in about a half-hour.”
“It’ll be alright,” Fred whispered, and Draco hugged the painting closer to his chest as he crossed the threshold.
With the attention that he craved on him, Draco let out his scent in waves, stronger than he had done before.
Draco’s fingers twitched towards his wand before he forced himself to relax. He needed Longbottom’s help. Hexing could wait until
A small crowd of people surrounded the fountain, several of them with horrified faces as a few pointed at the disfigured statues. As the lift began to rise, Harry’s view of them slowly decreased. In the seconds before it would become too late, Harry raised his hand, fist clenched before fingers slowly extended outward until they were all spread out.
“No, that’s actually why Blaise isn’t here,” Ron explained as he led them both into the next room. “He said it would go smoother for your business if kids weren’t there for the first visit. So he’s watching them for the evening”
Neville grimaced and Draco hated the lack of confidence in his abilities. “Erm, that’s not a plan. What happens if it fails?”
“Do they not know?” Harry couldn’t help antagonizing when it was obvious that they didn’t. “They don’t know what’s inked on your skin?”
“I want you to fuck into my hand,” whispered Potter. “I want you to use my hand to bring you pleasure.”
Death was both his salvation and his damnation. Voldemort used death to pass the time, used it for his own purposes and to gain power over others. But when it came to himself, death was taboo. Death was meant for other people, an outcome of the weak, those not strong enough to seek power.
“Take down your wards and invite me in,” Draco ordered when Harry kissed the tip of his nose. “Tis the gentlemanly thing to do.”
“They also grow restless quickly. You might not have witnessed that during your stay here, but that would be due to the recent Safety Inclusion Act of 1997.”
“He can’t keep a secret, not even a little bit. All I did was floo him to see if I could come by and he blurted it all out before I could utter a greeting.”
“There is a difference in fighting for what you believe in and forcing others to think the same. You shame him for letting approval sway his decisions, but what is he supposed to think when the alternative is met with taunts, duels and being bullied? Of course people like Malfoy swayed him, they were the only ones nice to him.”
When Draco opened his eyes the first thing he noticed was Potter sitting beside him and that he felt weird.
The spluttering of Corner and the smirk on Weaslette’s face was the last thing Draco saw before gathering his things and leaving the library.
Harry’s lip was caught between his teeth and Draco wished he could bite it. Fuck. He wanted to nick them, draw blood and suck on his bottom lip. Just the idea had his breath coming in quicker.
Harry smirked widely. “Good. I am in need of something to cheer me up.” He loved watching Draco become embarrassed. Anything that brought a pink flush to pale cheeks was always a plus in his books.
“What evidence?” Harry asked. “I’ve talked to his friends and family and I have reason to believe he did
“Sounds lonely,” Draco whispered, eyes on his notes but unseeing. The thought of being forced into the Manor as an adult and never allowed to leave made his stomach clench.
“That’s not fair,” Draco mumbled as he put space between them before he folded his arms across his chest.
“I’m going to the kitchens,” Draco said as he stood up and his stomach growled. He didn’t want to talk about the weather, Potter, or anything else unless it concerned food.
He had wanted Potter to finish in his mouth, but the more he watched Potter writhe, the more he realised how beautiful it was. Potter was just as beautiful as the portraits he paints, just as stunning as the finished products. He couldn’t paint this moment, but he could be the subject of Potter’s paint, even if for only a moment.
When the door shut, Potter slashed his wand. There was no spell uttered but by the feel of it, Draco surmised it was some kind of silencing charm.
“And that’s alright,” Filius said as an arm wrapped around his shoulder. “But you can’t just ignore it and hope it goes away.”
“You, just you. The way you’d feel wrapped around me, whether it was your mouth, your arse or your legs around my waist.”
“That you were watching my magic? Yes.” Harry held onto Draco’s waist tighter. “Because I was watching yours too.”
“The stairs,” Harry said, eyes still closed as he pushed his Magic over the stairs. “They aren’t sentient. But I bet people think they are.”
Draco couldn’t take it, couldn’t take the wait or the suspense. The whispered words were nice, and they surely went straight to his cock—it wasn’t every day Potter of all people willingly offered himself—but they weren’t enough, they weren’t what he wanted. More, Draco wanted
“I got what I wanted anyway.” It was a dramatic exit, but he didn’t expect anything else from someone who worked for the Prophet.
Sirius walked out of the room and he expected a clang as the door shut, but it didn’t, only closed with a small snap and the sound echoed far louder than it should have.
Something was buzzing inside of him, but he couldn’t focus long enough to figure it out. All Harry knew was that he wanted it to stop. So, he pushed, and pushed until it exploded outward with a scream that hurt his own ears.
Harry froze at the mention of himself. He tried to find other memories like that but the only ones about him were in passing, as if his existence didn’t matter because he couldn’t
a powerful spell but it’s a temporary solution. They’ll come back without the spell. Not only that, but
“Nothing,” Harry mused as he tried to dig deeper. Most of the time memories came on their own, it wasn’t easy directing what he wanted to see. “You did nothing.”
“I would think very carefully, if I were you,” Draco continued, eyes narrowed, and hands clenched. “Just because you’re a nosy old bat of a senile Alpha doesn’t mean your shitty opinions have merit. A traditional relationship may have worked for you but it
“I knew I wasn’t saveable, but they were and me bleeding out on the ground was going to ensure no one else would be harmed by my hands.”
“I already thought you’d feel amazing.” Potter’s nose trailed along his cheek as he slowly lifted up. “But it’s nothing like I imagined.”
Harry needed more, just thinking of Malfoy wasn’t enough. His eyes tightened as his hand increased the pace. He thought of what would have happened if Malfoy had known he was hard. His fantasy showed Malfoy smirking in his stupidly charming way before kneeling down and sucking him off. He wanted to bend Malfoy over and fuck him, wanted to let Malfoy fuck him too. Maybe he could have pushed Malfoy down and rode him. He was good at that, Quidditch taught him that.
Not for a lack of trying. Years, Harry had seen years of Blaise trying to track his father down, but it was hard to find what his mother couldn’t remember.
“Is the Light lord of the man we oppose, fights for justice but is a lord nonetheless. Dumbledore abandoned me too, don’t forget that. A man so righteous, so morally profound but yet he let me be taken without a trial. He was on the Wizengamot and he watched me be chained, watched the guards take me and watched the Dementors flank me. Some Light Wizard, huh.”
That wasn’t a word Harry recognized. He frowned, eying his home with interest. “The only people who come down here are ones that never walk back out.”
“That I’d have to be desperate,” Astoria whispered before she covered her mouth and her shoulders shook.
Draco felt a smile against his lips, and it made him want to keep going, to keep Harry to himself for just a little longer.
“What happened?” Draco was curious, part of him didn’t want to listen to the portrait at all, not when he knew it wasn’t complete.
Harry groaned as he plopped back onto the shore. Getting information out of Luna was worse than asking Professor Snape to repeat instructions.
their magic, it led to a corruption and caused an imbalance. The magic did not fit what was painted and therefore couldn’t last long. Some paintings combusted, others just withered away after a while.”
“I can get you in no problem. Our attendance is going to draw a lot of attention, as amusing as that will be, it’s unwanted.”
“I don’t know,” Harry mumbled, eyes on Malfoy’s leather trousers outlining thick thighs—fuck he wanted those around him. “It’s whatever you use to clean yourself and then your natural scent. The combination works.”
“How messy you already are,” Draco jerked his chin towards Harry’s cock, that had precome trickling down.
Draco sat up; expression dubious. “Are we talking about the same Charlotte who has never so much as been late to a meeting let alone step a toe out of line? The same Charlotte who is a do-gooder with a stronger sense of morality than even you.”
Harry bit his lip as his eyes unfocused and his mind wandered. The ENB was pretentious at the best of times and went on rank versus the validity of someone’s skills when it came to selecting spots for the National team. Despite that Malfoy deserved a spot on the team, it really didn’t make sense. The Wanderers held the first spot, hell even the Chudley Cannons were doing better in the current season than the Tornadoes.
Malfoy didn’t look at her, he chose to watch Nott instead, so Harry did too. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for, but Nott’s eyes grew softer, the anger lessening the further she entered the room. It was a weird effect, as if she was calming him with just her presence. Clearly, Nott was far fonder of her than he’d been with either of them.
“Your own fault.” A pause as Draco smirked when Harry rolled enough to land on his highest property. “You owe me.”
Throwing their entire community away for money. Did she think the Ministry would let her go? That she’d be able to escape being tagged? Another one to be double-crossed.
Draco winced. “I’m sorry. It’s just that I know you, love. If I had told you about it, you’d have spent weeks dreading it, weeks thinking about it, weeks grumbling.”
“You’re going to save them,” Draco whispered against Potter’s lips, and he willed himself to stay strong enough to not cry. “And then you’re going to eat that dinner that you were going to make me.”
“You moron,” Ron shook his head. “Experimental spells are risky enough, but you should never try medicinal ones.”
“What can you tell me about Sirius outside of your relationship?” He ignored the mutterings of ‘it wasn’t really a relationship’.
“Not as well as I would have liked. I was only 5 years his senior, but my father tended to keep our families separated. Competition, really. There were rumours that Grandfather Pollux would choose one of us to take over after he died. My father chose to cut Walburga out of his life when her side was chosen.”
However, the majority of the students were too distracted to notice all of that. The appearance of Malfoy for his eighth year was overshadowed by his cat.
have been enough. Draco pushed the residual magic towards the keyhole and let the magic encase the box tightly.
Harry was still grumbling when he opened the department door and stilled. Everyone in the office including Ashwood were sitting in chairs lined up in a semicircle.
“As for being bugged? Not a chance. I sweep the place three times throughout the day. There is no way someone managed to best me.”
The grip on his shoulders tightened and he hoped that meant Malfoy was close to breaking, because Harry wasn’t sure his patience was strong enough to keep the small talk.
“Fuck if I know.” He hadn’t listened at all, not when Jackson’s scent muddied into a gross combination of several perfumes and some kind of aftershave—Harry had been more preoccupied trying not to vomit.
“So we did things a little bit differently,” Nott stood up straighter and looked at Astoria, who wouldn’t meet his eyes either. “Nothing wrong with that.”
. I could talk about all the things he does for me that I love. Like the way he looks at me, the way he makes me feel loved and whole. The way he holds my hand too tight, like he thinks I’ll pull away. As if I ever would. Or the way I feel like I’m high on liquid luck whenever we’re together. But those are selfish to point out. I don’t want to talk about me when I bring up what I love about him. That’s conceited.
“Oh, don’t lie to him,” Malfoy interrupted, his free hand resting on his hip. “We both know the end of that sentence wouldn’t have gone over well.”
Harry didn’t want to be the center of attention. He liked being in the background, it was much easier to plan to eat souls that way.
Harry walked back into the office and looked around the room with narrowed eyes. Malfoy’s magic was a little stronger in the room than the rest of the flat, but not by much. He closed his eyes in an attempt to detect anyone else’s magic. The potent feel of his own magic was a little embarrassing, he was over here too much.
Draco sucked in a sharp breath. That was a low blow. Using Lupin’s status as a werewolf now of all times was
to do anything. The power was in your hands but it’s easier to do nothing. After all, Sirius was an unknown. A risk that you couldn’t put faith into despite all that he did for you. Sirius is loyal, to the point that it’s a glaring fault, and you tossed that away—tossed him away.”
“You ever had a part of yourself die? Something you once embodied or loved. A piece of you that once was but has long since disappeared or been destroyed? An absence that you wonder about or even crave?”
“You know, like Plan A or Plan B. I’ll just keep going down the alphabet till I finally ask Harry out.”
“I think you like it,” Draco murmured between pecks and small nibbles, before biting Harry’s lip again for show, only this time he sucked on it too.
The question held merit. Colin worked in the same museum as him, but they never saw each other while working—something Harry was immensely thankful for. Colin was a little… much… and Harry was never sure how to avoid Colin altogether.
Harry lifted one of his fingers, a jagged smirk forming at the sight of black ink leaving Lucius’ body before he let it fall back down.
Taking opinions from paintings was tricky, and not reliable, but Draco was desperate. With so few people alive that knew Sirius, he had to get creative. The problem with trusting a painting was whether he trusted the artist who painted it. If the skill of the artist was lacking, then so would the painting itself.
To a lot of people, crime was despicable, it was a sight that made them uncomfortable, a sight that had unease rising to meet a morality that would implore an action to
Slow tapping, a rhythm of fingers lifting and falling at a tempo that most wouldn’t see as anything but random. But it was a test. Harry was testing the connection, slowly lifting his fingers higher each time, seeing how easily the mark moved.
“Looks like the perfect kind of skipping stone,” Lupin said as he pocketed it. “But I don’t care about that, I would rather snog my dumb boyfriend senseless, since he loves me after all.”
I just KNOW that so many of you are feeling vindicated after reading this chapter. I know so many of you had guessed it all early on, midway and even up until the last chapter. Y'all are smart. I do hope there's at least one person that was surprised lmao. There was some foreshadowing along the way and some of you totally picked up on that.
Draco had to quash the smile that threatened to come out. Severus had been obsessed and it was amusing.
Despite the back history the book provided, Draco was left uneasy. Where had the Unfinished Stone been found? Who found it? Did they know what they had? Why did the Goblins want to keep it?
“It sure was.” And he couldn’t help but laugh when Potter’s eyes lit up. Teaching Potter was thrilling but dangerous—he could become addicted.
Harry’s brows rose and he put a hand to his chest in mock offence. “That wounds me. It was my life dream to be attractive to you.”
“No.” It was whispered with a confusion that Harry felt was justified. Other people besides him should also suffer with their emotions. “Muggles are weird, their inventions are weird, and I still don’t get how they manage without Magic, but the hate? Never did find a reason good enough.”
“That’s illegal,” Harry interrupted, a frown in place and the urge to hex Lucius shifted to an urge to hex Crooks. “What if your lawyer sends you a letter? You have the right to counsel and the warden
Harry’s head lifted up with a frown. His lips twitched when one of Malfoy’s hands tried to pull him back down.
Wishful thinking had him imagining the hatred in Harry’s eyes dimming enough for annoyance to take over. While Draco was adept at handling both, annoyance was far easier.
“I have mine,” Lucius said, tone haughty as he placed a wand on the counter that even Harry could tell had never been used by Lucius a single time. Not an ounce of a Magical residue on it.
“He might not be willing to talk about it anymore,” Draco admitted as he worried his lip between his teeth. “I ignored him for over a week.”
“What I feel for Harry has nothing to do with us, it has nothing to do with the situation or why you would sabotage me.”
The tone in which it was said held some kind of inflection. It wasn’t exactly pride, but it was close.
There was no smirk, no twinkle to his eyes as Malfoy looked at him. But there was an openness to him that Harry knew was rare.
“I know.” And he did. He didn’t need to me reminded. The memory of the Dark Mark searching his body for the piece of Voldemort’s soul was still fresh in his mind. He’d never be able to forget it.
Before, Draco would have teased or even made fun of Potter, but there was a vulnerability in Potter’s eyes as they stared at each other. For whatever reason, Divination meant more than just a subject to him.
“I don’t like you,” Malfoy growled, but it lacked heat and when Harry returned the sentiment, he knew Malfoy could tell that he lacked heat too.
“Spot on.” Her tone was far dryer than Draco had ever heard from her before. “We also ended disastrously and in a very awkward manner. Which is a fact, just as yours was. But both have nothing to do with my relationship with Luna. Dating a man previously does
Duty brought another marriage as history repeated itself. He tolerated Narcissa, sometimes if drunk and able to confuse that with things it wasn’t, he could delude himself into thinking it was love.
Bad memories were all he could see, and he wondered why he was telling a painting them when he had a hard time explaining himself to Hermione. Maybe it was because the painting was silent, someone who couldn’t talk back. Maybe because he’d never know what the painting truly thought. No one to verbally judge.
Hermione made a contemplative noise but when he looked at her, her eyes were narrowed, and her full attention was on the match.
Draco smiled into the kiss but didn’t want to back away, not when he was reminding himself of what it felt like to be in Harry’s arms.
The Ministry held power, however fleeting it was, but power buckles in the presence of strength—something Harry had in droves. Standing alone Harry couldn’t win.
“I don’t know.” It was said far softer than the intense fire of Potter’s eyes and the dichotomy would always surprise him.
“Oh,” Draco murmured, eyes lighting up in delight as Potter’s magic slowly moved toward him. “Not just one Dementor, Potter. No, command them all.”
They shared stories and softer times of their childhood, the memories they didn’t mind speaking of. There was a moment when Potter noticed that he was more reserved than expected, but Draco knew why. How do you explain what you can’t even voice?
When hands roamed up his body underneath the nightgown, Draco broke away from the kiss, breath coming in faster.
“I said don’t!” The vials of paint on his desk shattered and a thick gust of wind blew back Draco’s hair. “I don’t know who that is, but it’s not Sirius.”
“I wanted to see you more.” Harry played with Draco’s fingers, noticing a new addition of rings. “Don’t look at me like that.”
“Only you,” Sirius’ hands entwined behind his head. “Funny how he gives you a chance and not the hundreds of other werewolf children. What made you so special?”
Harry ignored the pounding of his heart as he took a few steps toward Draco. “I’ve been right here. Waiting for any inkling that you felt the same.”
“Thank you,” Draco sighed gratefully. He licked his lips nervously before continuing. “Do you think that I could get a memory or two of Sirius?”
looked at him. The breath he had been holding rushed out in a noisy exhale that had a few people nearby looking at them funny.
Draco rolled his eyes before he hopped up on the nearest counter. He ignored the scandalized gasp of a house elf, he didn’t care about propriety when he was still half asleep.
“Yes and no. It’s the energy you release, I can read it. It’s not something easily explained. The book will help you better than I can.”
Beauty was objective, changed perspective at the drop of a hat. What Harry found beautiful would frighten others. As a child, he used to find beauty in the brightness of the world that he barely got to glimpse from the inside of Privet Drive. He could remember aching to breathe in the flowers he saw, nose pressed up against the window and wondering what they smelled like. That to him was beauty.
“No.” Draco whispered as he turned around, not willing to see the hurt in green eyes. “I’ll floo you later?”
Harry tried not to freeze, tried not to show how affected he was by Lucius’ words. If Lucius knew, then Malfoy did too, he
end up a good person. Sometimes, I think that Malfoy still sees himself as he sees his peers. They were once the same, they were once just as much of a prat and a bigot as he was. But for some reason, Malfoy doesn’t give himself the credit of his current actions. He’s not his peers, he’s moved away from that and is already something else.”
“You’re preaching to the Wizengamot, Potter. Nothing ever is fair, is it? Glad to know that being the Boy-Who-Lived can’t even fix love. Evens the playing ground for the rest of us.”
The impatient hand gestured toward him had Harry rolling his eyes. The artist sure captured Malfoy’s likeness that was for sure.
“Any takers?” He asked, a wide grin on his face and eyes lit up with excitement. “Can’t promise much, but we’d have fun, that’s for sure.” His brows waggled before he pulled out his flask and downed it in one go.
“And at times creepy,” Draco said, blowing strands of hair out of his eyes. “Not to mention you have this way of staring at someone like you can see their soul.”
“You are going to fuck yourself with that,” Malfoy said as his own hands trailed down his body. “And I’m going to finger myself while I watch.”
Draco sneered at Diggory before he shoved him too. What was with all the rudeness? Couldn’t they tell that he had something to do?
“Excuse you!” Harry said, tone affronted but a smile was on his face as he took off the rest of his clothes. Draco’s eyes wandered; he couldn’t help it.
Malfoy grabbed a discarded piece of parchment from the desk nearest to him and transfigured it into several cards.
Parents. Family. A complicated mess that Harry never understood. He didn’t want to see it from Narcissa’s point of view, didn’t really care. He wasn’t a parent, but he couldn’t fathom treating a child the way the Malfoys did, the way the Dursleys did.
Draco hoped his cheeks weren’t as visibly warm as they felt. “I’ve tried everything I can think of and he
The portrait looked confused, and Harry snorted. “It doesn’t make much sense to me either. I was comfortable with her, enjoyed her company but when I thought of marrying her, it felt safe. It felt more like I was doing it because it was the familiar—a routine—something I got used to, something that never went deeper. I think Ginny was more than an attachment, and I certainly don’t regret any time I had with her, but I knew that if I went through with the wedding, I’d end up unhappy down the road, and wouldn’t have left. By then, the routine would have been too solid. I know I would have stayed and that wouldn’t have been fair to her or me.”
“Fuck,” he panted, unable to keep his eyes closed as he peered at Potter, wanting more, always wanting more.
“What did you want?” Harry asked, already knowing the answer but wanting to make Draco say it anyway.
“That’s okay,” Potter hovered a hand near Draco’s face, not touching. There was a plea in his eyes, and Draco nodded.
His head was filled with buzzing, and he knew they meant well, they wanted to comfort him but didn’t they understand? He was angry on their behalf because the Dementors were
“That was almost a melody,” Blaise said with a snicker as Draco walked down the stairs into the office. “I think next week it might actually give us a tune.”
“Not sure where you all came from,” Draco said, a finger rubbing the top of one of the snake’s heads. “But you can come home with me. I know someone who’d love to talk to you.”
“The fresh air might help you,” Potter gestured towards the shot still in Draco’s hands. Normally, he would have licked the whisky just to spite Potter, but as he stared down at the alcohol, he didn’t feel like drinking it—didn’t want to numb whatever Potter was igniting inside him.
“More,” he demanded as he placed his hands on Harry’s knee and tried to sit up. A hand left his arse and pushed him back down and he found himself not wanting to fight it. Draco let Harry guide him and let the control he had slip away.
More than the weather was accumulating to his comfort. Potter was nestled into his side, fast asleep. It was strange that the boy who-he-once-detested was the boy who-saved-his-spirit. When he came back to Hogwarts, Draco never thought that Harry would become his friend. Not only that, but his best friend. But life is strange, beautiful and chaotic. It brought in a change to
Voldemort was a lot of things, but Harry didn’t think he was stupid. To come after an outed Death Eater who no longer had a connection to him?
He could do better, but as he watched Malfoy set a steady pace, he wondered if he’d ever get a chance to prove it.
When nothing happened, Harry stepped closer, lowering his skeletal hand to touch the spikes along her body, petting them. “Strong, such strong horns.”
“I ran away,” Harry said, amused at how much red began to seep into Sirius’ aura. “But I found who I was meant to be, I found my family, and I’m okay with that.”
“Are you saying his magic is still inside me?” Potter looked stricken and a few seconds away from being sick.
Harry blindly grabbed a folder and opened his current case. Every other paragraph he had to start over. The words were there in his mind but nothing was registering. The harder he tried to focus the harder it was to ignore his hard-on. That wasn’t working. Giving up was the only option.
“Shh, little one,” Draco mumbled as he climbed up Harry’s arm, making his way up to the face before he tried to stretch enough to wipe Harry’s eyes. “You’ll be my friend even after you no longer remember me.”
He had always swore to himself that his father would never break him, not again, never again. But as the words he had
“You’ve talked about how he treated his friends, but how did he treat those he didn’t know, or even those he didn’t like?”
“Why didn’t you tell us?” Ron asked. “We’ve done nothing but spend time with each other. Do you know how long you getting married to a fairy would have kept us entertained? I wouldn’t have had to listen to Hermione’s lecture on the three properties of Nightshade and its uses in potions.”
A snort sounded weird coming from a dog, but Harry’s attention was on the soft curving of Draco’s lips.
“Anyway,” he said, pointedly. “I think we both know that my life continued to change after my sixth year and to be honest, it’s never stopped changing.”
A tug on his Magic reminded Harry that he was supposed to be scouting. In a way, he was. Humans captivated him, and he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the ever-moving crowd of people. Most of them were the same. The same muddy combination of colours that didn’t differ from one to the next.
“Any last words?” Draco asked knowing that he wouldn’t be able to speak at all. “An apology perhaps?”
“I do, I really do. You should get a chance to meet him. I think he’ll like you, I know I do.” There was a slight pause as Harry bit his lip. “And maybe later we can talk about that night? About what happened and why I was upset? I want our communication to improve if this is to go somewhere.”
And just like that the nearly nonexistent hope dwindled and he was sure his scent soured as it stunk up the room.
“Are you close to your son?” Harry asked, sighing when the drops of ink had spread into a giant blob over the beginning of his notes. “Would he have talked to you if he had decided to leave?”
“—ver fucking do that again. Do you hear me, Harry? You’re bleeding for Merlin’s sake. I want to hate you so much, and maybe I do. I hate you, Harry, I hate you.”
“Your husband has said that the Aurors think your son ran away,” Harry began, noticing the way her face shuttered. “If he had, would he have said anything to you?”
“What are you doing?” He asked, unable to stop himself as he stepped forward and examined two students who were twirling repeatedly on top of some form of a diagram. The diagram had letters spread out in a shape that almost resembled a rune, but it was unlike any rune he had come across.
Painting-Malfoy scoffed before hitting a hand against the canvas. There was no noise, but the message was clear, he was not happy.
“I have to debrief them,” Harry nodded towards the door. “Do you mind entertaining them for a minute?”
If his mother loved him than she wouldn’t have died. If his father loved him, then he wouldn’t have abandoned his mother. Love did nothing but end in pain, death and misery.
The Magic spiked and tightened its hold. There was no emotion within the Magic but Harry felt like the fairy was angry.
Draco slid down the side of the bed until he was on the ground, knees to his chest and arms wrapped uselessly around them.
“My biggest regret was never getting a photo of Black on the wall,” Kennedy whispered. “I never got to see what he did with his life, never got to see what he’d do with another chance.”
“Tell me you aren’t going looking like that?” His face was pinched, lips in a cringe and eyes showing disgust as he gestured towards Draco’s robes.
More magic entered Draco and his mind was hazy, clouded, and all he could feel was Potter. It was too much at once, but he didn’t want it to stop, he wanted
The keyhole was thin, far thinner than it should have been. Magical lockboxes required magic to open them, but not just any magic, it had to have been done with a certain frequency—a code of sorts. The thin keyhole caused Draco to wonder if Sirius had altered the box in anyway, and if so, how?
Static of colors woven into uneven lines of energy. It wavered the more they stared, as if Potter’s magic weren’t sure how to maintain the power surge, because that was what it was—a surge. Quick to arrive and even quicker to leave.
“I don’t think current me understands what Hogwarts me was thinking,” Potter mumbled, fingers tracing one of the harsher scars.
actual attraction. That debate had only lasted till striking grey eyes regarded him for a few passing seconds and then reality sunk in. So
“I wanted to make amends,” Malfoy whispered as Rosmerta was flagged down for a refill by a patron. “I wasn’t sure she’d want to see me.”
He wanted to scoff, tell Potter his sense of humor was dismal, but it was said with so much confidence that Draco believed him.
“Did you know that there is an entire magazine centered around the two of us?” Draco changed the conversation faster than Harry was really able to keep up with.
Six? It had been scary facing one at thirteen. He wondered what a Boggart would have been for him at that age. Probably the Dursleys.
,” Draco begged, not bothering to turn around. He couldn’t look into her eyes, not now. “We both know that what I painted is
Instead of gestures, Harry let another groan be his answer. Malfoy pressed their foreheads together as his arse moved back and forth along his still very hard cock.
The threat didn’t scare him. Nothing of concrete had been said and it could have been interpreted in many different ways.
The urge to say yes was there, but subdued. If things were different, he’d have taken Thestral up on the offer. He knew exactly why he’d turn him down but owning up to that was another thing entirely. Denial sounded better than the truth.
Harry looked up to see someone, the face was familiar, but he couldn’t quite place it. The man was standing at the entry to a boarded-up storefront that hadn’t been used in years.
“More creatures?” Luna sat back as the sound of rustling parchment carried over. “I have a list of magical creatures the Ministry refuses to admit are real, but I just
Draco wanted Harry to finish first, so he grabbed the still bloody wrist and ran his tongue along the skin, knowing it would sting.
“I’m surprised you didn’t know what it was.” Another glare had him rolling his eyes. “Clearly, your counterpart is smart. The sheer number of books out there shows a vast knowledge in a bunch of shit.”
When Harry looked up, he wasn’t sure what he had expected but the mixed aura wasn’t it. A lot of people had multiple colours to them, and Draco’s father was the same. But what surprised him the most was that the dominant colour was black.
They laid there for hours, until they had laughed over pranks, cried over memories and the spell had worn off and all they were staring at was an old ceiling that needed to be repaired.
Draco nodded the best he could with the hand still on his face. If Potter wanted him there, who was he to back out?
Dementor Den. I hope that met any expectations. I'm a little worried that people would have wanted a more detailed description of the den but the POV is from Harry who sees it every day. To detail in the way of someone who never seen it and make it believable that it was still Harry thinking it was difficult. So I got as detailed as I felt it should be.
“I don’t have to ask you if galleons were taken, I don’t have to ask if items made out of gold are still in the vaults. Philosopher’s Stones transmute other metals into gold. Wherever the stone is, I’m sure there will be a massive pile of gold with it.”
“I don’t want easy,” he admitted. “I can do all of that with my eyes closed and my magic restricted. I
Harry tilted his head. He wasn’t sure what he should have felt. Anger? Sadness? Crippling grief? There was no attachment to his parents. When he was younger, he used to wish they could have taken him away from the Dursleys, that if they were still alive, they would have treated him better.
“Oi,” Draco cried as he tried so shove Ron off him. “Potter and I aren’t together nor are we going to be.”
A noncommittal noise left Potter, and Draco wasn’t sure what to make of it. Was Potter calling him out? Was he saying that Draco had overstepped when doing Sirius’ portrait? The longer he stared, the more he just didn’t
The look he got in return was almost pitying and if he could, Harry would hex the painting. “Not all of us can be as keen as you. I got there eventually but my eye-opener was a real person who got harmed. I know there are good Aurors, ones like Ron, but they don’t justify the bad ones. They don’t cover or make up for the harm done by others. My morals wouldn’t let me stay there. I refused to be around that, even if it was by proxy.”
“The plaintiff has the majority,” Hemlock said through gritted teeth. “Leandra Prudence, you have the court’s approval to continue with an appeal. You will be contacted when a date has been set. The Animatio Court is dismissed.”
“But what?” Potter prompted as he leaned forward. Up close, Potter’s imperfections were just as pretty as his perfections.
“Dumbledore!” Neville shouted as he wobbled slightly, and his face shone from perspiration. He pointed when Potter looked around in confusion.
how passionately Lupin had defended Sirius to Dumbledore, why not voice that? Or had his mind been changed along way?
Potter. He was hyperaware of his disheveled hair, paint-covered clothes and messy hands. Nothing about his appearance was presentable,
A strange noise had his eyes opening. Without his glasses, he had to squint really hard but even with blurry vision he was able to see a green shimmering light. Hunger took a backseat as excitement took over.
There was no response, but Draco didn’t need one. It wasn’t a surprise what Flamel had done, typical Dark wizard. If he had the affinity and lack of morals for Life Magic, he’d have done the same.
“Let’s go!” Lucius whisper yelled as he pulled out a wand, this time one that was definitely his. “We’ll have to listen to it at the Manor.”
A strangled noise came from the ground, the general vicinity of Lucius but no one paid him any mind.
Zabini lifted up the parchment higher, eyes squinting as he tried to read it. “Just says…” he trailed off before his shoulders tensed and his eyes closed briefly. When they opened, he locked eyes with Malfoy.
The yelling got louder, the cheers grew with it and for the first time in a long time, Harry felt hope.
Draco shook his head as he placed a kiss to Harry’s cheek and then his nose. “Don’t need to. I’ve learned a lot about love and relationships, and maybe I’m biased or only have a narrowed view, but I think we can just keep going.”
“You can always come back?” The hope he had tried not to make obvious in his tone was there and he almost closed his eyes in defeat.
This story features a character named Emily. Who is actually @staganddragon. Who I wanted to thank for being her wonderful self and wrote her in. Which was honestly fun.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry had hesitated asking, but his curiosity was too strong. “In school, you didn’t seem that close to him.”
Deciding whether to get on the train or go back wasn’t a hard decision. Not when going back meant Draco, not when going back meant his friends, not when going back meant getting rid of Voldemort once and for all.
“Whoever owned this vault wasn’t British,” Potter said as he stopped to look at a plaque of artwork that had faded to the point that it was hard to see anything.
“I’m going to ride you, Harry,” Malfoy whispered, breath warm and tickling against his ear. “But first, I’m going to finger myself and you’re going to watch me.”
“Sounds like a lot of work,” Bill said quietly, an arm around Fleur’s shoulder. “Thank you for this. If Ron didn’t pay you enough, let me know.”
The small laugh he got in response was almost his undoing. How was it possible that everything Malfoy did got to him?
of you, my message has been passed along,” Harry growled, voice low and angry. “Or you’ll end up like her.”
“You can’t prove your blood status,” Harry said, brows furrowing at how much that affected Blaise. It was stupid how much Wizards cared about something so trivial. Magic didn’t discriminate like that, so why did they?
“Don’t worry about them,” the bouncer said. “They aren’t the poisonous one.” An exaggerated smirk showed elongated fangs and her eyes grew even brighter.
“He could have stopped it, could have asked for a trial. The Ministry is corrupt, I’ve always known that, but this? This takes it to another level.”
He wasn’t sure what he had done in life to have a friend like Ron, but he was forever grateful. When they reached Potter and Blaise, Draco felt a lot better and knew he’d have to make changes, but it would be worth it.
“Cyclone?” Draco asked, his voice higher than normal as he looked over his parchment. “I don’t have a cyclone down here. Filius why don’t I have a cyclone?”
Draco took a step back, disappointed but not surprised. He ignored the walls and instead focussed on the items thrown haphazardly on the floor. Some were broken knickknacks or pieces of ripped up newspapers dated from the early ‘70s. Little bits of trash sprinkled in were easily ignored as he made his way to the bed.
“I’m so stupid,” Harry whispered. The signs had been there, of course they had been. His own pain had blinded him to what he wanted.
Sirius smiled, it was small and barely there, but it was visible. “You were ready to cry, I would have told you anything to make that not happen.”
Harry snorted, lips tilting up in a ghost of a smile. One that still caused his heart to skip a beat, followed by a jolt of pain with the knowledge that he had forgotten how beautiful it was.
have warned him through the intercom if he was going to enter. The worry that had taken root in his stomach mounted as he turned around and watched Harry enter his studio completely.
“Really?” Harry asked, tone colouring in a delight that had Fudge frowning. “A reunion then. Tell me, do they miss Nymphadora? If they’d like they can meet her, I’ll grant them that.”
Harry sniffled a bit pitifully as he looked up, smiling somewhat sadly at the Dementor holding him. The surprise from the Dementor echoed through their connection until Harry was seeing himself through their eyes.
“I wish I could be like you,” Draco admitted what his teenage self never would have. “Not just your characteristics, not just your bravery, but perhaps if I loved as you did, then I’d be able to move on. If I let my love get bitter or angry then it would let in distance, would let in reasons to change it.”
Harry held out the papers towards Crooks, the warden, without taking his eyes off Pashkov. “I know that Azkaban is doing better in recent years but clearly, not enough.”
“Wait, is that why instead of giving us a wedding present you just handed me 50 Galleons?” Ron wondered, a small wrinkle to his forehead.
“Who looked for me?” Surely it wasn’t the Dursleys. There wasn’t a chance in hell that they actually missed him. He highly doubted Uncle Vernon reported him missing—probably threw a celebration.
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry said as he stood up. He ignored the way malice burned into dark green. “It was nice meeting you Draco.”
“They like to make wizards feel uncomfortable.” The line went quickly, multiple Goblins sharing carts.
When Draco arched a brow, Harry rolled his eyes. It was a challenge in a way, and it reminded him of too many memories when they were partners. Part of him missed that and he always would but Draco was happy as HR and it was about time he stopped living in the past.
“Because you like attention, food and hog the bed. They obviously modeled the dog after you.” The glare Harry received was still worth it.
“I guess I picked up their habit,” Draco winced. “I tell Harry I love him… sometimes. I try to tell him more, but the words don’t come easy to me. My parents knew I loved them, and they certainly didn’t need me to say it. But I try to show Harry too!”
Harry looked down at the mood globe in frustration but mostly anger. The damn thing was confusing him. Goyle had said it was linked to Malfoy’s emotions but there didn’t seem to be another globe of its kind before. No books, no information, nothing—there was absolutely nothing.
But was that still what he wanted? What if Draco changed his mind again? What if he gave into hope just for it to slip away again?
For a moment, a brief moment, Draco had been able to see the raw power of Potter. He had felt it for months, since they met, but seeing it was entirely different. It made it all
His grip tightened subconsciously at not only the cheesy pet-name but also at the swift change in Draco’s demeanour as he was met with a sultry grin.
“I believe you,” he said, one hand raised placatingly. “It’s just that it doesn’t match up to my investigation.”
Malfoy stepped away, eyes narrowed and the warmth went with him. Harry held out a hand, wanting Malfoy to come back.
Maybe he wasn’t ready to be open for Divination. Believing in it and seeking it out were two different things. If he went to Potter and asked for help, then there was no turning back.
“I want to kiss you,” Draco said as his hand caressed Harry’s face. “But I want you to want to kiss me more.”
Potter didn’t respond, not at first, at least not with words. Feather light touches to his hand had Draco looking down in time to see Potter slowly circling his wrist, thumb moving in a way that settled his magic.
“The rest of them don’t have a Sensory Condition,” Harry said, not willing to back down. “You have no idea what twenty people smell like in one room.”
Harry placed a finger on Draco’s chin and tilted it back as Draco whispered, “You deserve the world, Harry. I did the minimum.”
“Not often. He was reserved in that regard, only ever talking about it if it was brought up by others, or if it was necessary for the conversation.”
Potter’s jaw clenched, and Draco was kind of proud of that. He was glad he got underneath Potter’s skin. It was only fair, just the sight of his stupid face was enough to get under his own.
He laid on his back and stared up at the ceiling. The clouds that had grown darker over the hours he had spent in the room were moving quickly and he knew it wouldn’t be long before rain came. It would be fitting of his mood, he supposed, at least there was that.
Pansy rolled her eyes as she righted herself. “No one calls you that.” She pointed out with a smirk when he glared. “You will always be known as the Slytherin.”
“You could have brought her,” Harry shrugged. “You know I don’t mind. She’s the best Weasley there is.” He loved being an Uncle.
“You’re just lazy,” Harry said, hands clenching around the folder. “You want me to do your work for you.”
Draco jabbed the intercom and took a deep breath when only silence surrounded him. He loved Blaise, most days, but he was a lot to deal with. Besides, what did Blaise know? He didn’t need Potter to help him with anything else and
“Lavender?” Harry asked, and Draco hated the hesitance and unsure demeanour. He wanted to comfort, but it wasn’t needed as Brown rushed forward and embraced Harry tightly.
When hands moved to Harry’s waist, he stilled, letting Draco set a brutal pace. He had to grip Draco’s shoulders when each slam grew rougher than the last.
put in stipulations out of spite. But 50 galleons a week was more than he had now. Part of him wanted to ask for more, but knowing Goblins, they would give him less.
Nymphadora’s eyes were wide as she looked for an exit. Her choices were to either go toward the Dementors or the opposite direction toward Harry.
“Can I?” Draco questioned. “Because so far there is no evidence of that. If you never give me a starting point, then I’m never going to be able to get it.”
And when Draco didn’t understand something, he observed. Took it as an opportunity to watch Potter. Not that he didn’t do that daily anyway.
“That’s enough,” Ron said, voice filled with authority. “Coil is here to get some questions and then he’ll be leaving.”
“He’s afraid of paintings,” Harry whispered. He had only experienced the portraits twice, he couldn’t imagine what it would have been like as a child. The yelling, the insults, the swearing. It would have been traumatizing.
Harry wasn’t so sure about that. From what he remembered from Lucius’ memories; Voldemort valued him.
“And what does that do exactly? The essence?” By the burns on the hands, Draco assumed it was Charlie asking.
“He’s constantly moving from one topic, project or task and it’s hard to keep up with. He might contact us repeatedly in a week and then nothing for several months.”
“You were right. This whole department is fucked up. I thought about leaving, Hermione and I had started a savings—we would have struggled but it could have been enough.”
“You can have me,” he breathed and watched the way Potter’s eyes grew heavy-lidded before looking down towards his lips.
The buzzing grew louder and louder until Harry had to come to a standstill and pay attention to something other than his anger.
When Filius didn’t say anything, Draco looked up from his research. Pinched brows and a frown drew his attention. It wasn’t often Filius expressed himself in such a way.
Harry bit his lip, unsure what to say. He honestly hadn’t expected to get a foot inside, let alone a full conversation.
He wanted to snort, but he knew Ron wouldn’t be so kind with the next slap, and he already had a headache.
Draco leaned forward to peer at Potter over the top of the notebook. Potter wouldn’t meet Draco’s eyes as he fidgeted with a loose thread on his trousers. He wasn’t sure what to say, wasn’t sure what could have been said to that. Was he supposed to offer comfort?
Emotions. His entire life Harry had fought against them, fighting their existence, pushing them down when they flared up, pretending they didn’t exist and shaming it all until all that was left was a warmth that only being numb could bring.
“It’s you, that’s what it is.” Her arms tightened around him and it was just as suffocating as it was comforting. “You’ll do what you’ve always done, never give up.”
and wasn’t that just disgusting? The thrum of life sang in his veins the more he took and as always it filled him with power. The power of another life.
The plus of Sirius being in Azkaban was there was no resistance. He couldn’t fight back. Normally Harry didn’t take from people outside of rundown parks, dark alleys and secluded areas, but there was nowhere Sirius could go. Nowhere to run.
“Oi!” Ron cried, face buried in a pillow and a blanket covering his head. “Leave me out of it. Swear on your own life you tosser.”
“Among other things,” Phineas said with a half shrug. “He wasn’t quite grieving, what with Sirius’ death having
Harry wasn’t sure how to answer that. He knew Wizards viewed soul sucking as a necessary thing that Dementors did. As if that weren’t their only source of food.
Music of whatever song teens were into played in the background as he added linseed oil to thin the paint which would help create shadow and structure for the flesh portions of the portrait. The music was catchy, and he couldn’t help but hum along.
When several memos flew into the lift bringing forward a gust of air, the all too recognisable smell was a sure sign that Karma didn’t just not like him, no, it detested him.
Harry was numb. Dumbledore had died right before his eyes. Witnessing death never got easier but perhaps he had become desensitized by it all because there were no tears, no feelings of grief—just a numbness that spread throughout his whole body.
“Draco,” Harry said firmly and with a conviction that shut his boyfriend up. “The Horcruxes have to be dealt with regardless of what I do with the soul pieces. Voldemort can’t die while they exist. What I do with them doesn’t matter.”
Harry flushed and he had to look away. Seeing Malfoy’s expression as whispered gratitude filled the air made an atmosphere that he wasn’t sure his heart could survive.
“He’s hurting,” Blaise stressed as his eyes softened. “As much as you want to know Sirius, Harry already did, and I can’t imagine the pain of thinking you could regain a piece of that for it to be ripped away.”
, are you mental? Why would you come to Hogsmeade? A breath away from Hogwarts. Dumbledore probably already knows you’re here.”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare Lottie, I was just trying to leave this for you.” He gently placed the plant on the desk. Wild colourful leaves were the first thing that caught people’s attention, but Draco rather liked the long billowy stem, it didn’t conform and changed shape daily.
Harry’s head jerked as his face scrunched up. “I wish you’d quit describing it like that. You aren’t dead.”
Harry stared at the dildo, debating whether he wanted to just jerk himself off over Draco’s stomach or listen to him.
That drew Draco’s attention. Neville had moved closer and the lack of outward emotions was the only reason he let himself be pulled into another hug.
“How do you know it’s in there?” Did Malfoy talk about what he wrote? Were self-portraits more aware if the person was still alive? He really needed to talk to an artist. Maybe they could give him some answers.
“Then they wanted it to be found. They wanted people to know that Malfoy had not only been bested but had been given a silent portrait.”
“What a shame.” Blaise’s arms were wrapped around Ron’s stomach and the smile on Ron’s face was dopey, the sight made Draco’s stomach curdle. They were gross. Gross and in love.
When the smile grew sinister, Harry could only sigh. It was his own fault. He was too nice, allowing just anyone to tag along.
“Mister Sykes, I have come to you regarding your second job.” If Draco wasn’t set in his lack of emotions, he would have snorted at the fright in the man’s eyes.
Love. Harry sighed, both at the notion and the idea of tackling it. Love had never worked out for him, it always ended in breakups, sadness and missed opportunities. Malfoy seemed to be all of them at once and he wasn’t sure that could be changed.
“Oh,” Harry whispered, voice echoing around the sudden stillness of the room. “You’re a Death Eater.”
“I’m going to find that guest room you mentioned, and tomorrow, we are going to implement the next part of the plan. All you have to do is follow my orders, but you’re good at that, aren’t you?”
“Please, Draco,” Blaise begged. For what, he wasn’t entirely sure. “I didn’t want to talk to him let alone see him. He’s despicable, annoying, entitled and rich.”
“Except the defining factors are from a right fucking bellend and we are more than his descriptions.”
“I’ll call you whatever you want,” Draco continued, nearly breathless. “As long as you call me by my name.”
“Will you do it as well? I want to feel you too.” They’d have to take turns; it was dangerous to combine magic like that.
The frown went away and was replaced with a barely-there smile. “And my magic? What’s it doing to you?”
Harry jumped, the instant oatmeal container falling to the floor. How long had he been standing there staring at nothing? Going back to bed sounded like a good idea.
“I find you interesting,” Draco retorted as he placed his chin on his palm. “You aren’t like anyone I have ever met.”
Harry had wanted to spend more time exploring Malfoy’s body, wanted to discover what else would make his forehead wrinkle, wanted to hear more quiet sighs but he gave in. The weight of Malfoy’s cock in his hand was an experience he had missed; it had been far too long since he had been with a guy.
“What does that mean?” Many ideas popped into his head and each one made his heart race with things he didn’t want to think about, it was too soon.
“Me too.” It had always been just a daydream or a fantasy but none of it had matched up to the reality. None of his dreams felt as real as the warmth of Draco’s lips against his own.
Harry kindly tapped on the side of Ron’s head. “Don’t listen to Draco. I am sure you are a lovely person. Probably full of charm.” They both ignored Draco’s snort of disbelief. “I think that you could propose anywhere, and she would say yes. Probably even here!”
Draco downed another shot of whisky before he narrowed his eyes at Potter, stupid Potter with his bright eyes and equally bright smile, his messy hair that hardly tamed over the years and his horrid clothes that he managed to pull off.
And the biggest thing, that I'm sure all of you noticed. I didn't specify age. How many years has passed since the first chapter? What year is it? what's been going on in Hogwarts? What's been going on with Voldemort.
It took a lot of strength to not blast a Bombarda at each bigoted painting. Why would anyone want to subject themselves to the verbal abuse?
Harry looked to Draco curiously. He wasn’t an expert on human attraction, but he was pretty sure he didn’t fit anywhere on the realm of being attractive, what with his skeletal hand and all. That and being a Dementor.
“That makes two of us,” whispered Draco. He wasn’t sure what exactly Potter had planned, didn’t want to either, but he was curious enough to give in to his idiotic desires.
Ron made a humming noise as he flipped through pages. “It looks like she had registered to be a Healer’s assistant before switching careers. Worked for St. Mungos for a few years.”
The grin on Blaise’s face was Draco’s favourite sight to see and he would forever love Ron for putting it there.
“No.” Malfoy’s fists clenched. “People don’t respect what I do, what the people who work for me do and it can be hell. Sex work is a valid career and it doesn’t get the understanding we deserve and it sure as hell gets treated like a dirty secret. What kills me the most is that some of the people who say shit during the day are the very people who come see us at night.
.” Draco seemed aghast at the idea. “I’ve already come up with several different ways to get him back for attacking you. Each one of them worse than the previous. Want to hear them?”
Potter tilted his head, mirth causing an actual smile to form—not a tiny ghost of one that Draco was used to.
“I talked to Lucius earlier,” It was Harry’s turn to squeeze Malfoy’s hand when he flinched at his father’s name. “And when I mentioned Hold, he said she was the last of the Hold line. And it got me thinking. I asked Ron to look into her previous job and it fit with some of my theories.”
Draco frowned, clicking a few buttons before he gave up and shut down the whole computer. The simplest solutions were for the best. He spun in the chair one more time facing the rest of their flat, wishing not for the first time that Harry hadn’t taken his happiness when he left.
“You were just speaking about my boyfriend and his wonderful taste in his partner.” He drawled rather unimpressed with the rubbish attempt at deflecting. Draco folded his hands across his chest and narrowed his eyes.
“I think you don’t know what to think. You’re confused, hurt, guilty and it’s easier to step away than to analyze it.”
Harry wanted to tell them, wanted to launch into an angry spiel about how the Ministry had chained Dementors to Azkaban, that the Ministry was the true Azkaban killer. But it wasn’t ideal to let out too much, especially to Dumbledore’s moronic group.
The silence he was met with would have been unnerving to other people, but it was familiar to Draco. Reminded him of home—stifling silence, stares that said more than words and a whisper of
Ron had his wand already raised and his other hand covering half of his face. Harry was tempted to pull out his wand too until Malfoy lifted a baby Niffler above his head.
“Busy doing what?” Ron said with a snort. “You’re still reserve, aren’t you? You sit on your arse all day.”
Harry bit his lip in indecision. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to read any more of this. It was clearly shaped in ways to show the two of them in manners that just weren’t true. But a pang in his heart at the thought had him continuing on anyways.
Harry knew he was beating a dead horse. Idealistically, that would make sense, but he had seen the way the Ministry laughed Lupin out of the office. They knew exactly what he was and didn’t care what he had to say.
Harry stood up straighter, fiddling with his glasses. “All you have to do is be yourself and the rest will come.”
“Tomorrow.” Potter’s eyes fell to his lap, and Draco felt like he was missing something. “That’s actually why I came here.”
“I suppose you wouldn’t know what happened to your alive counterpart, would you?” Harry asked as he stepped closer to the painting.
“No.” The finality startled Draco as it did Lupin who jumped a little and frowned. “He will live with his aunt and uncle.”
“So, we’re doing this?” Seamus asked, hand on his hip and a far too pleased grin on his face. “Wait, Dean, you haven’t—”
“Why are the headlines never about The Better One? It can’t be, ‘The Better One strikes again!’ No, it’s always, ‘The Chosen One saves Hogwarts’.”
Harry’s eyes were watching the proceedings, and Draco wished they would grant her at least a hearing to be able to get an appeal. The different councils were filling out the paperwork for the hearing. He already knew it would get denied, it always did.
“It’s the best method,” one of the twins argued. “The body is too rough; the eyes are their weakest part.”
“They are an omen for a reason. People only make silent paintings of those who they want to bring suffering to.”
“What are they for?” Harry was tired of not having answers. “Lucius keeps trying to put those on me and it’s not happening.”
“It’s almost time for Exploding Snap night and you haven’t left your studio at all. Have you even eaten lunch?”
The sound of a cheering crowd always calmed Harry. It was a distraction, it was something he could focus on and even lose himself to.
Harry wasn’t sure where they were. The room was darker than he expected, a green eerie glow encompassed the room that came from the windows.
“The rock was just one minuscule variable. If you look at the water, you can see how it is trying to reform as it once was. That is important to remember. It is important to realize that whatever happens in life, it is just fleeting, and you can always reform after. But sometimes…”
Life truly wasn’t fair. Someone like Crooks actually made a decent living but yet he was the one living in poverty.
Harry raised his human hand, letting his Magic hold onto the spell, the red light swirling around his palm.
Shrew pulled out what looked like a pair of glasses but there was a smaller version on top of those and then another small version on top of that and it continued until the last pair was too tiny to see.
Harry’s brows merged as he closed the notebook. He could see why she thought Malfoy had run away, but everything inside him screamed the opposite. Whether it was his intuition or just stupidity. Something told him that Malfoy didn’t willingly leave.
mourn with you.” He held out a hand behind him, knowing Draco was already moving forward to grip it.
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled, fingers gently petting her. “I’m sorry they harmed your eggs. I wish I could have protected you.”
“I hate you.” He went to remove his hands, but Blaise was quick to hold them in place and they both watched their friends continue to argue.
“No matter what happens, remember it’s just a match. You’ll have played to the best of your ability and I will be here for you, okay?”
you don’t have Exploding Snap? How are you going to host Exploding Snap night and not have any cards?”
Malfoy waited until Skrewt went back to her post before he addressed the crowd. “I apologize for the interruption. Thestral, give everyone 1% off their drinks tonight.”
Light at the end had them slowing down. It wasn’t until they were at the entrance did Draco cover his mouth.
Harry raised his hands placatingly. “I’m not implying he did. I have to cover all my bases, and considering the stance the Aurors have, I need to rule it out.”
As he stepped outside and began to walk down the path towards the Apparition zone, he eyed Potter discreetly.
Potter was high on the fumes of whatever shit the Aurors used to get through the day of overinflated egos that ruled their corrupted morality if he thought the Ministry would
“What do you want from me? To apologize on Draco’s behalf. We both know he doesn’t regret a damn thing. If you’re waiting on an apology from him, do hold your breath, it’ll make my day.”
“Nott’s face when we walk in together though,” Malfoy said softly, almost questioningly and that’s when it came full circle for Harry. He
He had to roll away from a playful smack, but he hadn’t lied. Charlotte was the kind of person who would be offended if work was cancelled. She could give Granger a run for her money.
Harry couldn’t stop the sharp inhale from escaping as he stared into the eyes he had loved all those years ago.
about what they could do. It was a group of people who felt the need to be special, who thought they were doing something in the name of the greater good. But what did they accomplish?
It didn’t matter that he couldn’t tell if it was a flobberworm or a disfigured Hippogriff, Harry had made it with his own hands and Draco
“He’s not like Voldemort though,” Sirius argued, there was no passion to it, no emphasis like earlier. He wasn’t quite defeated, but close.
Draco blinked rapidly, not liking the sound of this at all. “Pardon me?” It seemed nice enough, but his tone was demanding an explanation.
“Who is it?” Harry nudged Draco off of him, and he could see the chance of dick disappearing right before his eyes. Whoever was at the door better be dying, and if not, then they would be soon.
Harry sometimes used the internet to talk to Granger. There was a little camera on the computer. At least that’s what Harry
There had been a half-success once. Sure, most of it was attributed to the distance between them as Harry refused to approach the counter and instead yelled what he needed. While he may still have got hard, his mind wasn’t as distracted as it usually was. A miserable silver lining—Ron would be proud.
Everything became too much. Harry’s touch was too much, the conversation was too much, his emotions were too much, and he couldn’t take it. Draco stood up rapidly causing his stool to tip over backwards and the only other patron to look over.
“I didn’t know you were such a baby,” Sirius mocked as he stuck his tongue out in concentration and skipped the rock so hard it bounced ten times across the water.
The raised eyebrows weren’t something Draco was used to, not after the memories. He had been under the impression that it was hard to surprise him.
“Blaise Flooed a half hour ago and said they couldn’t make it. Something about you working him too hard and he’s too tired to do anything.”
“He’s not the only one,” Lucius said, shrugging when everyone looked at him. “A lot of Death Eaters are, or at least they think they are.”
“Ironically, Crouch was caught by Moody after the war,” Lucius said, lips curling up in a smirk. “For torturing Aurors into the whereabouts of Voldemort.”
When Draco’s eyes narrowed, Harry imagined he knew exactly what was to be said. “Don’t worry about it.”
“Well, I’m always willing to learn something new.” Did that count as flirting? Fuck. He hoped not. One touch of Potter’s magic and he was already going mad.
With nothing left to talk about, nothing left to drag on in the hopes of waiting for Ron, Harry knew he’d have to do something. The only question was what? If he lunged for Malfoy, then it would leave him vulnerable to an attack. If he attacked her, she could throw the portrait in the fire.
“I still wanted to help people,” Harry shrugged. “So I opened my business. I take cases that Aurors refuse to, or ones that never get reported to them. Sometimes I get some… questionable ones as well.” He couldn't’ help but snort at the thought of Snookums.
Draco took a deep breath when it was time to go on to the next stage of the painting, he had reached the area where the earlier attempts had failed at, but this time the inspiration was still there, this time he could do it—he
" Draco breathed, and he had to fight the urge to throw his arms around Potter and hug him… or worse, kiss him.
Draco let out a low whistle and the office owl flew down from her perch as he folded the letter into the envelope.
Draco snorted harshly. “Potter didn’t say. But I could hear your brother whining in the background about a lack of food in their tent and it was Deja Vu all over again and that if he had known he’d be reliving their youth, he’d have given the assignment to someone else.”
“And the last champion, the girl?” Harry asked. Her skills were nothing to write home about, but then again, pitting a dragon against children wasn’t a fair fight.
“That would certainly get us his vote.” But at what cost? There was no way in hell he was going to let Lane continue running the ring. They’d have to double-cross him.
Hello! It's been a hot minute, hasn't it? Sorry about that. Right after I wrote for Fanfair, I then had to write for Erised. Now that the latter has been turned in, I can get back to this story. I have no more deadlines, no other fests. So my attention should be able to go back to weekly updates for this story! I have missed writing for this world a lot. Hope you like it!
“If you want to be his friend, I won’t stop you. He could use more friends, we all could. If you want to admire his looks, do it. I sure as hell admire his toned body and deliciously tanned skin.” He had to shake his head to steer clear of
Before Lucius could reply, Harry held up a hand, amused when Draco took it and entwined their fingers.
season,” Harry countered, knowing it was useless to argue, he was biased, and everyone knew it. “Point of the matter is that Malfoy was the best thing the Falcons had, and he’s the best thing the Tornadoes now have.”
Screams filled the air and Harry relished in it, relished in their terror, their fear, the overwhelming emotions that made his teeth ache to
“I can’t do it,” he whispered to himself as the light from the half-opened curtains highlighted shadows around him.
The dark green anger marring Sirius aura had Harry rolling his eyes. Sirius was so easy to manipulate.
The words alone would have soothed him but the sight of several Dementors swooping down put him at ease. They picked Draco up, had him suspended midair before skeletal hands drew runes that Harry couldn’t see from the ground but could see in their mind on Draco’s body.
“No, we are just friends.” His hands were moving with his head and Draco’s heart sunk. The firm denial and panic on Harry’s face hurt.
The whoop of victory Blaise let out caused him to shake his head as he unlocked his studio and shut the door. The silence of the room was welcoming, and he was at ease away from prying friends or invasive questions.
“I didn’t realize you two were close.” His smile was forced, the attempt at remaining cordial was laughable.
Draco closed his eyes tightly from the sting and nodded quickly. Ron was right, as usual, and that stung but he appreciated the honesty.
Harry shoved Lucius out of his way as he marched up to a fountain. A hideous fountain that he was surprised he hadn’t noticed immediately. It wasn’t that it was ugly that bothered him.
Painting-Malfoy looked a bit disturbed, and Harry felt bad for him. He wondered what it was like to be a painting let alone know that the real version was missing.
“I don’t want your apologies.” Malfoy looked down at his lap. “They mean nothing to me. You mean nothing to me.”
And Harry would watch them burn. Would their emotions sour into nothing as their existence lessoned? Would the colours fade into dull splatters of hues that were once vibrant? Or would they remain the same, even as he took each and every last soul?
Draco gripped Harry’s knees tightly as a tongue breached his hole. Rimming wasn’t something a lot of guys liked to do, and he couldn’t remember the last time he had been on the receiving end.
The Manor looked as it did before, at least Harry thought so. His face had been so swollen that it was hard to see anything. As he followed Tazzy he couldn’t help but notice the decor; it was… well expensive—that was about it.
“Maybe you’ll have to earn it,” Harry repeated Malfoy’s words back to him. He had to look away from the knowing glint in Malfoy’s eyes.
They both froze in horror before looking up. There, sitting on a branch a few feet higher than Terry, was Malfoy’s cat.
“Ron, I think.” His forehead pinched as he tried to remember. “No, maybe it was me. I don’t know, does the truth matter?”
“Merlin, I had hoped by now you would have gotten a decorator to spruce the place up. It’s gaudy. I don’t know how you expect me to work in conditions like this. Can I site ‘blinding by ghastly interior’ as a reason to get workplace compensation?”
The boy looked around uneasily before leaning forward, voice lowering as he whispered, “What did the building look like to you?”
Harry’s mouth parted but his eyes sparkled in a way that Draco hated that he loved. “What are you going to do to me?”
“He’s been gone for 6 months.” Lucius glanced at the ceiling as he blinked rapidly and despite everything, Harry felt for him.
He could tell they were amused; they always were when it came to him. Harry liked to think he was their favourite.
There was no one to question it, sometimes the Dementors grew curious, but they were a hive. They knew what he knew, they already knew the answer. Because Harry couldn’t lie, not to them, not even if he wanted to.
Draco waved that away as he wiped the blood off of the runes. “Of course there is. No one would argue otherwise. Any magic can do harm, Potter. Don’t forget that. Dark Magic is less about what it can do and more about a lifestyle. When you practice Dark Magic, you are practising a new way of looking at the world. One where more than just what is visible can be detected.”
Sirius took a deep breath before he picked up the rock. “I told you I loved you for the first time by the lake.”
“If you don’t give me a galleon, I’ll take one off the ground and tell the Goblins you stole from them.”
you. Deep down, you don’t want to ask him. I can’t figure out if it’s self-preservation or if you are just scared.”
“I came here for him,” Harry jerked his chin toward Barty Crouch Jr. “But you, Minister, are a treat.”
Potter had never been good at keeping his emotions in check, not really, but Draco revelled in it—especially when it was in the form of deep groans and a hand in his hair.
Draco reached out a finger to trail along the invisible lines of magic. To anyone else it would appear as if he were touching air, but no, Draco could
A flash of green could be seen behind Seamus as Harry snorted at the confused tilt of his lips and furrowed brows.
They stroked each other, Harry’s hand loose, Draco’s tight, eyes locked. A wet sound echoed around the room as they continued to touch each other. Draco alternated which side of his lip he bit until the whole thing was red.
A telling and uncomfortable pause permeated the room. “Because, should you get me the information I require, I will grant you an extension on your loan.”
One photo, in particular, caught his attention. Harry moved toward it to get a better look. Malfoy had been asleep, head resting on his journal, ink smeared on his face from a quill held upside down.
The smirk faded into a genuine smile and Harry was positive his breath caught somewhere in his throat,
Harry laughed, surprised that he still could. Never felt like laughing much before. He ignored the look Sirius was giving him. The bloody dog needed to mind his business.
cooling charm, not after having already done three—Harry had only done one and Draco didn’t think his ego could take it.
The disappointment in her sigh hurt, but he was too far gone, too willing to keep going. He needed to do this, for himself.
He dodged a smack to the arm and wondered if this was what friends did. He didn’t think they were friends. Friends didn’t want to suck the soul out of each other.
Harry placed his hands on defined abs and raised his hips higher to be able to slam down as hard as possible. The pace slowed down the rougher the bounces got, not able to maintain both without his body tensing and arse clenching too tightly to move.
Potter closed his eyes in what Draco assumed was a look of concentration, but he honestly looked like a prat.
“You have some paint,” Potter whispered as his fingers came up to rest against Draco’s cheek. “Just right here.”
A wicked smirk. “Oh, I know.” Draco ground down and it had Harry letting out a low moan. “I can feel it.”
“I was of the belief that Potter had no one,” Phineas murmured. “When one loses the only thing they have, it leaves a lasting impression. They were close, of that I am sure.”
“War is a mood killer,” Potter said dryly with a wry smile. “Not only that, but the Order the first time around was massive, filled with so many people, talented people who died. The second time around it wasn’t even a fraction of what it had been. The manpower was diminished in comparison and that was hard to ignore.”
“You still read that trash?” Draco sneered. The Prophet was filled with mindless drivel and propaganda.
“Don’t patronise me,” Sirius said as he clenched his hands. “You want me there because you don’t want me elsewhere. You want me there, so I am under
“Don’t make me repeat myself,” Malfoy placed his hands behind his head and stretched his feet out until a footrest appeared out of nowhere. “Go on, pull your own weight here.”
“Here, this is a healing salve too. I wouldn’t add any dittany to this because my salve already has some in it, and we wouldn’t want a double dose.” Instead of allowing Harry to apply it himself, Draco decided to be a
Draco pulled out photographs of Sirius when he was younger and compared them to his mugshot and then finally to Order shots after he escaped. As he observed the proportions and the noticeable differences between the years, he committed it to memory before he picked up charcoal and began to outline what would be the most important piece of his career.
“But with the disappearances and the weird stuff happening, they’ve warmed up to the idea of needing help.”
the last of his money for the next few weeks. A customer or two would tide him over, but the chances of that were slim. Despite that, he couldn’t stop the giddiness from taking over as he sat on his bed and began to read.
“Porter Kent,” Draco began after a long silence. “He owns D3. Stands for Discoloration, Disfigurement and Defect.”
Malfoy’s hips stopped moving, something he didn’t like. When he glared, hands roughly pushed his head down further, until he was deep throating Malfoy’s cock, nose pressed against fine curls.
Draco’s eyes had stung long ago, and he had to blink away the tears. It was exactly what he had been missing. Love had such an impact on a person and every person he talked to hadn’t given
as that was, it was no match for Harry’s strength. He lifted Blaise up with one hand and slammed him against the wall, something crunched but Harry wasn’t feeling generous enough to care.
“You’ve got a lot of explaining to do,” Hermione warned before helping Harry stand up. “No way you’re getting out of it just because we almost died.”
“I can tell that Ron didn’t shower before he came over here.” He snorted when Ron sheepishly shrugged. “I can tell that you wrote a bunch of letters, the smell of ink and old parchment has lingered.”
“I have a publisher lined up when the next book is finished, but I need it approved by the Ministry to implement it into Hogwarts’ curriculum.”
Could he really go to Potter and ask for advice on Divination? His pride would be wounded, but that wasn’t really a concern. If that wasn’t a worry then what was? He bit his lip as he tried to be self-aware about it all. Growing as a person became limited if he refused to think openly.
Silence was his answer, but Draco was alright with that. Wasn’t bothered when Potter stood up and stormed away.
“Figures,” snorted Nott. “I almost died and you’re giving me nothing but empty and useless apologies.”
“If I let them take the blame, then that means I’m supposed to let it go, and if I do that, then what’s left?”
Magic was everywhere. Not just in the air but in the walls, paintings, statues, rooms and even inanimate objects like stairs.
Harry wasn’t sure what to do with that. There was a lot to unpack in their father-son relationship, something he’d have to look into later, but now was not later, and he’d like to push it off for as long as possible.
Morbid humour was his speciality. Part of him would always miss who his father could have been, but he didn’t miss the person who had existed.
Harry leaned forward, inches from Draco’s lips, eyes unable to not notice the way those lips parted on instinct.
Luna had been no help, Hermione was skeptical about the whole thing, Neville left whenever Harry tried to ask and Ron had nothing of worth to comment. So Harry did the one thing he rarely ever did.
“My name’s Harry,” he said after some internal debate. He didn’t want to pretend to be someone else, the illusions and dyed hair were enough as it was.
“I imagine a lot of people,” Luna said, tone pointed in a way that wasn’t usual for her. “Voldemort lived with the Malfoy’s for a time, didn’t he?”
Panic didn’t belong in Draco’s voice, but he wasn’t sure how to soothe it. “Draco, there’s a piece of Voldemort’s soul in me.”
“We could be,” Harry whispered, grabbing hold of every possible amount of courage that he possessed.
I enjoy this story. I find myself fascinated as I write it shks. The emotions are some of my favorite. Yes, I am aware I didn't explain all the colours. Especially yellow, but no worries, I will! Eventually lmao.
The silence that Draco craved after hours of listening to incompetent children was ruined by a horrible clang as the staff door collided with the wall. He didn’t have to look up to know who it was, only one person behaved with little dignity.
good, put me on a higher standard, one that he never matched. I was suddenly something made to be seen—a prize. I couldn’t have bad days, I couldn’t be something other than what everyone
“Sign here stating that should noticeable differences to your Magic whether it be temporary or permanent side effects are an understood risk and it is not the establishment's legal responsibility but instead falls to the consumer.”
“Yes,” Malfoy’s voice had an odd lilt to it and his were zeroed in on Harry’s face, narrowed and moving rapidly. “Come, Harry.”
Good. He tried to say that but wasn’t sure he succeeded. The last thing his mind registered before sleep took him, was Potter.
“I know.” And he did, he wasn’t a professional for no reason. “I’m not new at this, Potter. I know when someone can’t handle it, I know when it’s in my best interest to deny them.”
“They both are powerful—according to you—both of them command mini armies of people, both of them fight.”
“Fuck,” Harry panted, the pace of the dildo increasing the longer he thought of Draco. He could come like that, had done it many times before, but he didn’t want to. Didn’t want to come unless it was because of Draco’s own doing.
When Harry looked back to the fire, Luna was still staring. He had her full attention, which wasn’t something he was used to. Luna always had several things happening at once—it made him nervous to be the sole focus.
“Let’s just get out of here ‘Mione. I doubt he knows anything anyway. Gringotts isn’t exactly on the way.”
“I can’t condone what happened, but I do understand most of it,” he said, fingers pulling on a stray thread of his shirt. “I’m not okay with what happened, but I’m okay with
The sight of Sirius’ yelling at Dumbledore caused his lips to curl upward before Draco tried to remain unbiased as he watched the memory unfold.
Why the hell was he the only one concerned? And 'concerned' just pissed him off. Since when did he care about shit that had nothing to do with him?
“Whoa—” Nott pulled out his wand as soon as he saw him. “What the fuck do you want? Come to put me in a coma, have you?”
Andromeda’s eyes closed, and silence settled around the room. The longer he sat there the more he grew worried she’d leave him with nothing.
Draco wiped the specks of paint from his fingers on his trousers as he eyed the base of his painting. It wasn’t quite right, but that was the point, that was what his mother wanted.
. Happy memories that didn’t feature him came in flashes, some longer than others. It wasn’t just memories; it was also life. With each brief memory he felt more and more of whoever they had belonged to. With the life came energy. It filled his entire being.
“Okay,” Draco conceded, small twitch of his lips. “Just not in front of hundreds of witnesses, alright?”
Narrowed blue eyes filled with an anger that matched his aura. The bulk of Dumbledore’s aura was a mix of dark green, turquoise and red. Dumbledore walked through life angry, bitter and sad. Harry was itching to know why.
The harsh stance softened slightly as Potter stepped forward enough that they were within touching distance.
He didn’t want to get used to it. He wanted to have decent cases, interesting ones. Something noteworthy.
“Looks like it,” Potter said. There was an odd expression on his face, but Draco didn’t care. He was too interested in the contents of the vault.
When Draco wouldn’t meet his eyes, and began fiddling with the bottom of Harry’s jumper, he grew concerned. He covered Draco’s hands with his own, forcing pretty silver eyes to look at him.
Draco wasn’t sure what Harry had planned. No plan of his had ever worked well. Ever. But this was serious, this was their lives.
Harry didn’t plan to. They had traded bits of their hearts, both pieces unsure and a little battered but willing to keep going. He’d hold onto the pieces
“Because it’s an answer.” Harry’s hand clenched around his bottle and Draco focussed on that, it was easier than looking into his eyes.
“You look kind of familiar.” Furrowed brows accompanied the statement and Draco ignored the déjà vu feeling.
A gentle grip to his chin had him looking up. Harry’s eyes weren’t pitying or sad, but they held a lot of emotion, and Draco wasn’t sure what to do with that.
He pointed to the paper where Theo’s stupid fake smile was on the front page. “He’s having an engagement party next week and I’m going to crash it.”
Harry sucked in a sharp breath. Had Draco seen what he had? He knew they were connected in some way. But for Draco to see any of that… what did that even mean?
“Have you talked to Ginny at all?” Harry tried not to rub the back of his neck; he knew he was nervous, but he didn’t want Ron
“Like this?” Malfoy gripped Harry’s thighs before moving up slowly, inching towards his hips. “Is this what you imagined?”
Harry snorted as he kicked off his shoes, leaving them in the middle of the room where Draco has told him
you will sign a magical contract stating that you will cease all testing of your products on minors.”
When his mother leaned forward, there was a light in her eyes that he hadn’t seen since he was a child. It made him miss her, miss what they used to have.
“It’s so nice to see you.” Astoria left the table to approach Malfoy. “I had hoped you wouldn’t attend though.”
“And why would I give you that? What makes you above everyone else? There are plenty of them with more seniority than you.”
Harry smiled and for the first time in a long time, his heart was as happy as the rest of him. He could have gone his whole life as Draco’s friend and been satisfied, but there would have always been a little piece of him that wondered.
There was no lie in his aura, Draco meant what he said, and it was enough to have Harry ducking his head.
“Don’t leave it all in suspense!” Fred yelled, the silence of the room making it sound far louder than it was. “I didn’t suffer for months with you to be left in this bloody wrapping.”
“How do I do that? Just waltz up to him and say, ‘I know I’ve been a prat but your scent makes my dick swell. How’s your day?’”
“I’m waiting for the point.” Before Draco could arch his brows, he felt Potter tickle his sides and he tried not to laugh.
It had taken them a long time to get where they were at—the ability to lean on each other, the trust of comfort and the love to heal old wounds.
She repeated his question to him as if that was going to help somehow before he was brought to a list of options.
“Not fair,” Hold shook her head as her grip on her wand tightened. “You’re trying to lecture me on what’s fair? He chose to be a
“Oops,” Draco tsked as he got closer. “Looks like one of them was a little too high.” He poked the knife sticking out of Killian’s palm.
The paper fell off his cheek and landed on the table, and he wished he could drop Fudge out of his life just as easily.
Harry nodded and watched the way a light dusting of pink marred Malfoy’s cheeks. “It can be a trade.”
“I don’t think Pashkov is the mastermind, there has to be someone higher than him, someone with more brains.”
“You have a house elf.” Harry’s lips curled into a snarl. What was with Wizards and the need to shackle living beings?
“Yeah?” Lupin asked as he peered up at Sirius through his lashes, lip still caught between his teeth.
Draco’s face must have reflected some kind of emotion, because Potter huffed and pulled out a few bones as he knelt on the ground.
Harry opened the front door to step outside. There was no lingering magic at all. Malfoy never left through the front door. Considering the wards had been left intact, that wasn’t a surprise. Back inside, he walked through each room to gauge the strength of magic. The rest of the place was the same, just weak traces.
“Sirius why are you questioning this?” Lupin’s brows were furrowed, and his voice was higher than normal.
“Yeah,” Harry snorted, eyes on the subscriber count that was rapidly increasing. “All 3 million of them.”
Draco’s head snapped up and so did the parchment stuck to his face. “What? Is he insane? I can’t do a piece that far back. There is no one left alive to tell the story.”
“Your parting words were still true,” Malfoy whispered. “Marriage to either of us was never in your plans. You used us until it wasn’t beneficial.”
Years of emotions, thoughts and memories slammed into him, causing Harry to dig his fingers into the ground to remain upright.
Harry shrugged, not sure if he had a verbal response in him. He knew she was right, but it was just hard. Love always was.
“I will love you when they break your heart and you think that the world is ending. I will love you through the awkward stages of puberty and promise not to tease too much. I will love you when you fall in love for real and it makes you feel as if you are flying without a broom. I will love you when you graduate Hogwarts and leave home, even though I will dream of when you were still a baby and not leaving us. I will love you when I have to give you away to someone else, even if they still aren’t good enough for you. I will love you when you experience having your own children and I will love them just as much as I already love you.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Just because Djinn are the nightmares of your youth don’t mean they are fantasy.”
“I’m not showing any spikes in pain levels. Your heart is racing and your eyes—” Ron moved his hand to open Nott’s eyes wider. “Have you taken any medicinal spells?”
“I knew I was meant to help you,” Draco said, fingers fidgeting in a manner that was not like him. “And maybe I was meant for you too.”
“Why? I enjoy the ladies just as much as you would.” Her hands were crossed, and he raised his own in defeat. He hadn’t meant anything by it.
A scream reverberated around the room and Draco felt the pain in his heart as the magic died out and the painting fractured beyond repair. When he stood up, he had to brace his hands on the desk at the sight of the wrecked painting.
"Nice to meet you." She beams. He can't find anything to reply with, but thankfully she spares him the chance.
Draco smirked as he watched his and Harry’s latest video. In it, Draco had stood behind the camera and started twerking once Harry walked into the kitchen as a prank.
“Hello Kore,” he nodded, He was about to continue on his way when Kore stepped in front of him, glaring. It was a bit of a shock that the two of them were nose to nose, exactly the same height. Harry has naturally assumed that he would be taller than him, but this new development was the opposite of disconcerting. In fact, it was actually quite…
An hour later, he was deep in the thick forest that blocked most of the sunlight from kissing the ground. It was also chilly, and there were distant howls of wolves in the distance.
They walk to the counter. "Jade!" Harry calls out. A few seconds later, a lady comes out of the back room. She has a pink pixie cut, several piercings and tattoos on her arms. Draco only has one tattoo, which was on his ribs. It said 'Happiness can be found in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.' He didn't know who had said it, but it felt... personal for some reason.
He groaned and tried to press the wound with his cloak to staunch the bleeding, but all it did was send a spike of pain through his body so sharp, he passed out onto the dirt floor.
He stood up from his cushioned seat and stretched, wincing slightly as the ichor rushed to all the parts of his body. He summoned his cattle-skin sandals, the ones that had been dyed white and stretched up his calves. They would go well with his outfit.
"Sometimes I prefer being average." Draco shrugs. He wasn't going to talk about his father just yet.
Next was the olive oil. It was warm and freshly made, and he poured a generous amount from the pitcher into his hands before he rubbed it onto his face, over the honey. Normally, he would wait for it to set by itself, but there wasn’t any more time for that (thanks to
“Someone was just a bit rough, is all.” He said, trying to sound nonchalant. Harry didn’t seem convinced.
“It’s incredibly irresponsible, especially if you’re thinking about making money off of this by writing a tacky book about them,” Granger finished, gasping slightly for air. Jesus, she talked a lot. Draco would need to shake her off later, but right now he was only interested in one person.
Once he was sure that it was gone, Draco walked quietly into the room. He frowned. It was gigantic but empty. The only thing inside was a standing mirror with a strange inscription on its top. It wasn’t in any language Draco recognized, although the words looked oddly familiar.
you corrupt my son?” She screeched. She slapped him as well, her long gold nails digging into his cheek and drawing blood.
“Potter, if you surrender now, then I shall be as lenient as possible. The police are already on their way and if you resist arrest then- “
Draco nodded, and tentatively tried a sip. He gasped. It tasted like soda flavored with butterscotch and whipped cream, only stronger.
Finally, the lock clicked and the door creaked open. He peeked outside and sighed out of relief. The halls were empty, save the groans and the sounds from the other inhabitants of this horrible place.
Harry was wearing the same outfit he had worn for their first breakfast, only now the shirt was buttoned up so his chest hair didn’t peek through the top.
During the car ride, they had mostly talked about the final details of the collab. When they got to Draco’s house, Harry was amazed. It was huge, and it even had a pair of these big-ass iron gates in front.
“In a minute. Let me just…” He siphoned some dark magic from the depths of his robe, before flicking it onto the woman. The ribbons of dark magic wrapped around the woman, and the three kings started to sit straight in anticipation.
“Isn’t it weird to drink from you?” He asked. The left side of her cup raised and dropped, which Draco took as a shrug.
Harry stretched out his limbs after he left the court room, wincing as his bones cracked loudly. He had left court early, handing his seat over to Thanatos, who was more than used to this. If Harry had to be honest, he would admit that he wasn’t even half as responsible as Thanatos was, and the Underworld would be
Draco lets out a satisfied hum (which sounds almost like a small moan) and watches with a small smirk as Harry signs his arse.
Draco shook his head in exasperation. Honestly, he would never understand what went through the minds of the people he serviced. Like this one lady who had smelled of spoilt fish and had come to ask him to exorcise her cat.
Suddenly, her face paled, right in the middle of Draco’s rant. But instead of showing him to get out of wherever the hell he was, she just muttered “Oh god, Hades.”
“Sure. You can take care of the plants if you want. I’m sure Neville can help you out. He loves plants.”
They snuggled into the couch and watched their movie happily. And if they paused the movie halfway to make out, well, nobody had to know that.
They were fucking on the living room couch when Harry’s parents walked in. At first, Harry and Draco hadn’t noticed, but the shattering of a champagne glass brought them out of their sex-induced haze.
. It was short and barely skimmed the top of his hairy, muscled thighs. Harry could bet a thousand galleons that he wasn’t wearing anything underneath.
“Draco, can I talk to you?” He nodded and allowed her to lead him to an empty break room. When they got inside, she shut the door and locked it. Draco frowned.
And at the rate with which the glass was breaking, he had only a few months, if not weeks, left before… before the curse became permanent.
He could feel that the rotten parts had spread from his heart, and had covered most of what was a normally pure essence. Now, he was black and dark and
Draco sprung up from his lap, quivering out of excitement. He followed Harry to the dining room and gasped. It looked…
“Leave! Please leave now!” His father begged. His voice was coming from a tiny set of stone stairs hidden in a corner. Draco ran up them until he got to the top.
“Well, I’ve always been interested in more extreme personalities. They’re just more exciting, and more challenging than a normal patient. And, if I must admit, these criminals also possess a more high-profile presence. And more glamorous one, if I must say.”
Harry started thrusting even faster than before, sending Draco into a crazed, overstimulated frenzy. He whined loudly and shoved his arse back as hard as he could onto Harry’s cock, making the resulting friction feel
Draco scoffed. “Apollo is harmless, mother. I know how to handle him if he crosses the line. And please slow down, my new robes are getting wrinkled even more!”
The thought of his family made his hunger go away. He wondered with dismay how his parents would be coping without him.
“Yes. Yes, I am.” Draco murmured. It took him a moment to realize that his hands were still in the beast’s.
Draco shrugs. The Ferrari wasn’t nearly as nice as his Lamborghini, but he wasn’t about to bring his best car just for college.
Draco usually talks to his reflection whenever he sees himself in a mirror. His mother used to joke about calling him Narcissus instead of Draco. Of course, that would have been weird because his mother's name is Narcissa.
“Don’t touch me!” The man snarled and freed Draco to attend to his pierced skin. Before Draco could scramble away, the man punched him in the stomach, sending him to the floor and taking away his breath. His head knocked against a tree root and he groaned.
with him. And there was a time that I caught him leaving Potter’s room with a love bite on his neck. When I tried to ask him, he told me that it was just his boyfriend. And I believed him, somehow.”
Lucius snarled as he fought off the three wolves that had cornered him and his horse. They were vicious, biting at his leg and the horse, but even they were no match for the wrath of Lucius Malfoy.
“Well, you could set them up. Say that you want the three of them to hang out, but you never show up. They’ll be forced to talk to each other and eventually confront their feelings. And slow down there.” He said when Harry started filing a bit too enthusiastically.
One fateful day, while the Prince was taking a stroll of the land around his palace, he came upon an old woman dressed in rags sitting on the cobbled streets.
Draco also noticed that Harry kept on looking down at his arse when he thought Draco wasn’t looking.
.” He pressed his chest into Draco’s back and leaned forward, making Draco inadvertently bend forward as well.
The apartment itself is pretty. It has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a nice living room. It is small enough to feel cozy but big enough to be spacious. Plus, it isn't too far from his new college, Hogwarts Institution.
“Relax, love. Enjoy it.” Draco was pretty sure he was already enjoying it, but his retort was replaced with a garbled moan as Harry abruptly took his cock into his mouth.
. My father, he’s… he’s,” Draco couldn’t finish the sentence and shoved the mirror into Harry’s face.
“Hey Ron, Hermione.” He smiled, picking up Ron and Hermione to set them on the table while keeping Crookshanks in his lap to stroke him. At first, Harry had hated him, but now he was infatuated with the damn thing.
“Yes,” Draco replied, biting his lower lip nervously. Harry stepped out of the bathroom and Draco barely stifled a gasp. The flimsy cotton was stretched against Harry’s broad chest, and he noticed with red cheeks that there was a tenting in the lower part of it.
. He pushed the tip of his tongue right in the middle, flicking it softly and making Draco thrash and whine.
Draco’s arse isn’t just well-shaped; it’s very soft as well. Like a peach. A very soft, round, pale, pretty peach.
Draco smiled back and sighed. “Sorry about that. Anyways, here are the potions. Is there anything else you would like?”
And as confused, but delighted shouts started to fill the castle (no doubt everyone waking up from the curse) Harry swept Draco into his arms and kissed him again.
Harry shrugged. “Just wanted to. The people at my school are posh prats, and I want to talk to someone who I didn’t know.”
About half of the glass had fallen off the mirror, with cracks spiderwebbing around it. As Harry watched it, another small piece came out and fell to the floor, shattering.
response to this man’s request. Before he can come up with something to say, the man huffs and blows away a long strand of white-blond hair from his eyes.
Harry’s grip on his hip tightened. “Fine. Be like that then.” He started to pull out, but Draco stopped him.
Rufus Scrimgeour cursed through his teeth as he struggled in the restraints that tied him down to a rusty iron chair. The same chair he had been stuck on for the better part of an hour. His backside was aching, but that paled compared to the fear he was feeling at the moment. And the disgust.
Despite this, people still looked down on him and called him a Death Eater, which was most likely the reason why he was working in such a lowly job.
"You are an absolute beauty." Draco says to his reflection, pouting. "Nobody even comes close to you. You're just undeniably sexy."
Draco groaned as he opened his eyes. Everywhere was dark, the room only illuminated by a shard of moonlight that shone through the barred window.
. He stepped even closer to the man than before, his cattle skin sandals making the leaves beneath his feet crunch noisily.
“Do you, King Harry Potter of Gryffindoria, take Draco Malfoy to be your husband and your Consort King?”
They all stared in horror at each other for a second, before Harry quickly pulled out of Draco and wrapped him up with the blanket they had put on the cold sofa.
Before Harry could reply, Draco knelt down in front of him and yanked down his joggers and pants in one go, releasing his cock. Draco gulped. It was bigger than he had anticipated.
“You shall come down for breakfast in a half-hour.” Draco recognized the chilling voice. It was the beast himself.
Draco made his way over to a vine of grapes and plucked one off curiously. He popped it into his mouth and nearly moaned aloud. It was sweet and slightly sour at the same time.
“Love you,” he whispered. Harry nodded, and suddenly kissed him, ignoring the panicked shouts of the countless police officers in the background. The bomb would go off soon, anyway, and he needed to get Draco out of there. Quickly.
He looked around at the dark room until his eyes land on an entrance out of the room that certainly hadn’t been there before, covered by several thin, translucent curtains.
He decided to head out to the back of the house, where he knew there was a large garden there. It was warded off everybody but Aphrodite’s siblings and servants. It would probably be empty.
“Father!” He yelled. He didn’t care about himself anymore; if his father was here he needed to save him.
“Now, put your right hand on my shoulder.” It guided. Draco blushed and placed them, although he had to stretch a bit because the beast was rather tall.
Harry shook his head nonchalantly as he straightened out the stack of parchment in front of him. “I’m alright. Just terribly bored.”
With that thought in mind, he gathered all of his confidence. He needed to be as charming as possible to win Draco’s heart. Draco was a hard-to-get, and Harry loved a good challenge.
His brother looked a bit older than when Harry had last seen him, although to be fair, the last time they had met was over a century ago. His salt-and-pepper hair was in a bun at the back of his head, and his beard was as bushy as ever.
“How many times have I told you not to scream in my ear, ‘Mione?” He sighed, opening his eyes to stare at her. She was standing in front of his throne with her arms crossed and her hair a bushy, frizzy mess. Her eyes blazed with fiery fury, making her irises glow almost as brightly as the flowing rivers of lava that illuminated the dark realm.
Harry kept quiet for a full minute before he spoke up again. “Thank you for your time Zeus. Please leave me be now.”
The servant gulped audibly and trembled a little more. “Lady Aphrodite said that I should remind you of the favor she performed for you if you refuse the invitation. She also said to tell you that there’s no way you can avoid them anymore.”
“Asphodel,” he said. To be truthful, he hadn’t been paying attention at all to the woman, but Asphodel was where a majority of the souls he judged went to, so it was the safest option.
Her foolish pride had ensured her ultimate demise. Harry chuckled to himself at the image. After he had destroyed her willow tree, it was quite enjoyable to watch her slow, painful death.
As she scurried off, probably to find Ron, Harry laughed gently. It was good to know that some things wouldn’t change.
“I hereby curse every living creature in this palace into a mere household object, and you, Crown Prince, into a monstrous being. This spell cannot be broken except for true love’s kiss!” She shouted gleefully.
He hastily grabbed his cloudberry wreath as the wind spirits helped him put on his sandals and braided his hair into a messy plait that stopped at his waist. When they finished, he bade them farewell as he sped out of the house and towards the tall grass fields and the marble streets that would lead him to the market square.
Draco hid behind a pillar, watching as the beast walked out of the west wing. He looked strangely happy for some reason. Whatever was in that room, Draco mused, it must be important. If he played his cards right, he could get whatever was in the room and use it to bribe his way out. Not exactly a perfect plan, but Draco was desperate.
Harry couldn’t get the picture of the man out of his head. It had been some days (or weeks; he lost track of time when he wasn’t firmly grounded to reality) and he still couldn’t get think of anything but the beautiful blond.
Draco didn’t hesitate to answer. “Yes.” Not only because of his love for Harry (although that was a very big factor) but he knew that if he refused, Harry would have no choice but to kill him.
about everything he wanted to. At the moment, what was troubling him the most was the increasing number of people asking for his hand in marriage. Just over the past few weeks, several more gods had started to leave him gifts periodically in hopes of winning his heart. Not just Apollo, but even Hermes, Ares and countless other minor gods who had merely spotted him from afar. It deeply troubled him that even Ares was willing to leave Aphrodite in order to court him, and Hermes even offered him his sacred caduceus as a gift.
“Too dark for you. Try this one.” She pushed forward an emerald green long sleeve jacket and black leather trousers. Once he did, Draco had to admit it was beautiful. The shirt buttoned all the way down to his waist, where it split into a V and ran down open to his calves, exposing his legs. The trousers hugged his legs perfectly, and the black laced boots Pansy had given him completed the look rather well.
Draco was about to retort, but shut his mouth. Besides from the lonely nonsense, Harry actually had some good points.
“Rose! I told you not to go to the grand chambers!” A middle-aged looking woman, who had a striking resemblance to her daughter (or Rose, Draco supposed) appeared from at the entrance of the hallway where Draco had come from. She paused once she spotted Draco.
of cases. His partner had called in sick for the week (although Harry knew that he most definitely wasn’t) and now he was stuck with all of the grunt work. Gods, he
Draco was led into Mr. Dumbledore’s office. It was rather odd, with sculptures of mythical creatures about and paintings all around. It was just like Mr. Dumbledore himself, Draco mused. Odd, but comforting.
Harry eyes him suspiciously, but doesn't say anything. Soon, Jade brings their drinks. Instead of getting to know each other, they just sit on the bean bags admiring the silence and the view. For some reason, Draco prefers this to mindless chatter.
“Good morning.” Draco mumbled, looking away from its piercing green eyes. They were cold and calculating and made him shiver.
“Are you done with the wires?” Harry asked from where he was sitting on the floor of the Electrical Room.
Draco sighs as he pulls his hair out of the tight bun it’s in. His skull aches. He brings out a fine-toothed comb for his pocket and starts to comb it out.
“Greyback’s a werewolf.” It had said. “It was just a sprig of wolfsbane tied to a silver rod. Nothing better than that to repel werewolves.”
As he gets lost in his nostalgia, he fails to notice the front door opening and the sound of soft footsteps fill the quiet apartment. He only notices when the figure leaning on his doorframe clears his throat rather awkwardly. He immediately snaps up his head and instantly gets lost into those pools of fog swirling with specks of blue ink.
“Your choice, then. Malfoy.” He says pointedly. Despite himself, Draco laughs. Then Harry gives him a grin and walks out, leaving Draco feeling slightly happier.
Draco’s feelings towards Potter were changing. Granger’s black-and-white view of him wasn’t accurate at all. Potter was much more complex than either of them gave credit for, if he had to be honest.
house. It was a typical futuristic mansion (not that Draco had seen many after he had run away), but what amazed him was the
“If you ask me, Blaise is the suspicious one. He’s all quiet and mysterious and shit.” Theo snuffed, inspecting his nails haughtily as he talked.
Ever since they had started dating six months ago, Draco was sure that Harry was already used to his craziness. Now, Draco spent most of his time at Harry’s house (the one he had inherited from his parents) and was pretty sure that soon he would start spending
“It’s rude to me how bad they smell.” Harry was the one who had to smell them all day long, it was fucking torture. They could live knowing they smelled bad.
“Lucius?” Draco asked as he stepped forward and pulled out one of Blaise’s fancy frames. “Yeah, I knew him.”
Before Draco could reply, Potter had already stood up and was halfway down the corridor. He wanted to call out, ask him to stop or at least demand an explanation, but he chose not to.
Draco laughed loudly, a sound that was enchanting, but also upsetting that such a beautiful man could appear so perfect. It just wasn’t fair.
“Likewise,” Luna said, fond eyes on the Sprites as they began to fight over her leftover crumbs. “Take care of that one, will you?”
“When don’t I owe you?” Harry handed over the exact money and tried to keep his eyes open enough to continue. He knew that his money wasn’t enough to cover the next time he landed on something of Draco’s.
Potter’s lips quirked briefly before they thinned as he looked up at a stretch of dull houses before them. Draco didn’t see anything worth glancing at but if Potter was going to do it, then so would he.
Later. Did that mean he’d get to kiss him later? Before he could ask, Malfoy vanished his shirt too.
When he got a shake of a head, Harry wanted to scream. Getting anything out of a silent portrait was nearly impossible.
“Nymphadora,” Harry purred, taking a step forward, ignoring the wands pointed at him. “We meet again.”
“That doesn’t count.” Draco narrowed his eyes and tested the strength of Potter’s hold. “We’re still clothed.”
Six Patronuses and only two and a half Dementors didn’t make for a fair fight, which is why Harry pushed forward and took the Patronuses head on.
Harry was used to heartbreak, felt it many times over but he had never experienced it when the person had never been his to begin with. But as he stood there in his friend’s arms, surrounded by frustrated guests and confused Aurors, Harry wondered if it was deserved.
A sound Harry had never heard from Malfoy before had him glancing up again. Laughter. “Do it again.”
“Oh, absolutely,” Seamus nodded. “Sometimes when he mentions a date, my stomach clenches but then it eases because I still have him, just not in the way I wanted. But that’s okay, I’ve accepted that, no matter how much it hurts.”
“Sorry.” Malfoy grinned. There was a sparkle in silver eyes, and his nose scrunched in a way that was
Draco nodded once, unsure if that was enough, he didn’t want to interrupt anything, not when it was clear that it meant something to Potter.
“So,” Ron plopped down on top of Harry’s legs and put his head on his chest. “What did we interrupt?”
“No,” Malfoy moved Bandit away from Harry. “I wouldn’t advise that. He doesn’t like people to see him.”
“Never even got a trial,” Harry said, eyes opening, relishing the horror that encompassed the man, not just in his eyes but in his aura too. “I’d feel bad for you but you’re a Wizard.” He left out the, ‘I think you deserved it’ but thought it was obvious.
“I—” Draco cut off as he looked away from Potter and stared at the wall beyond him. “Both, I think.”
Flashes of life filtered through, stronger than a typical soul and he wondered if it had anything to with the rest of the soul inside him.
I do hope you enjoyed this chapter! Let me know your thoughts and which part was your favorite. As always, see you next time!
There would come a time when the laughter would disappear, the emotions wouldn’t exist, and the memories would be so faded that there would be nothing left. Silence would be the only survivor and that was the true beauty.
” George croaked out miserably. “This is going to take a lot of work. How do we narrow down the list?”
There was no point in arguing. Harry was just going to let Dean think he was right, less energy than the truth.
“He was,” Potter said just as quietly. “If I could have, I would’ve stayed with him. But I couldn’t, and he suffered, alone.”
“And hey,” she continued with a calculating look that didn’t match her personality. “It’s practice for the hearing.”
“I didn’t miss you at all.” His face was emotionless, but his eyes were twinkling, and Harry didn’t believe him for a second.
The treatment of House Elves would always make him the angriest and the saddest. What hurt the most was knowing that House Elves didn’t see it that way, the majority were
Harry leaned away in time to watch Draco’s eyes close tight, mouth part and his name fall from his lips.
It took far longer than it should have before callused fingers were placed on his, and he tried not to take offence.
“Well, there were a lot of curses besides the protection spells. Those were more typical to the time period. Curse-Breakers aren’t to touch objects unless they’ve been thoroughly vetted, so I put in a contamination void.”
Draco closed his eyes tightly and Harry wanted to reach out and comfort him but didn’t think it would be wise.
Sirius shook his head repeatedly, but his face was resigned with a sadness that screamed of something else.
The screaming grew louder. It was a woman and his mind wanted to draw upon an image, but it was hazy, and nothing made sense. Harry covered his ears, but it didn’t drown out a single thing.
“Light and Dark Magic is vastly different despite both casters being Wizards. One isn’t better than the other.”
Harry sighed as he flipped through the sections he had already read, hoping to find something of interest. His eyes narrowed when it came across ‘
He waited until Potter left before he placed his head on the table and groaned. He could feel grains of salt on his face, but he didn’t move to get rid of them. The silence didn’t seem as welcoming as it had before.
“You going to come for me, Harry? Give it to me. I want to see the finale of the show that you are.”
“Will you quit it,” hissed Harry as soon as she walked away. “We’re definitely the worst customers she’s had.”
Harry took a deep breath, eyes closed as he tried to inhale what he hoped was the things the creature was taking and not just air. He repeated it over and over, ignoring how with each breath he felt calmer. Things became clearer, less hazy and he hoped that meant it was working.
“Have you suddenly turned into the students we teach?” Draco asked with an arched brow. “Why are you wanting to gossip about
something to Draco, and he wanted it to have the same meaning, wanted it to be because Harry cared for him the same way he cared.
The more she sighed, the more he wondered if it was a personality trait. The sound of paper crinkling distracted him from the urge to down another shot.
The authoritative voice could only be Dumbledore’s, but Harry didn’t have the time for that. They would have to meet under different circumstances. He held out his hand behind him, knowing Draco would grab hold.
There were shapes on the other side of the portal, but he couldn’t tell what they were. Low murmurs of a conversation were audible, and his curiosity had him taking a few steps closer.
“That’s not his fault,” Harry whispered as he wiped his eyes. “Malfoy has done a lot of things that he’s not proud of, but he’s aware of them and is trying to make amends. You can’t pin her death on him, that’s not fair.”
Emotions he wasn’t sure should mix welled up, but instead of suppressing them, Draco let them out, allowed himself to
Harry reapplied the oil, the low heat nice on his skin. He had to wave his hand, using magic to lower the counter enough so that he didn’t have to be on his tiptoes.
“You must be Sirius’ mum,” Harry said, lips twitching at her disgusted expression. “I can see where Sirius gets his charm.”
Draco let out a soft gasp of surprise. He wasn’t the only one either. The crowd surrounding them began whispering furiously. He was positive he heard the snapping of a camera too.
There were a lot of sure things in Harry’s life. The Dementors were the first, his decisions the second, but Draco was quickly climbing the list, knocking down others.
“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t harm him,” Harry said before pulling the knife out. Draco felt a rush of foreign Magic encase his body. His eyes closed on instinct at the gentle prodding toward his Magical core. It always fascinated him how different they wielded Magic. Where he needed intent to guide his Magic into working, Harry only needed to
Draco closed his eyes. It was always so bloody difficult talking to Potter. Nothing was ever at face value.
“No,” Draco shook his head. “Not like that. They take some of it, enough to make people feel weak or lethargic but it’s not enough. They need more than that to live.”
I do rather enjoy writing this story and look forward to getting into the next chapter. I hope y'all like it as much as I do!
“Are you going to ask me the same questions everyone always does? ‘What was he like, do you miss him, was he
“Liar,” Seamus pointed an accusatory finger at Ron before rounding on Neville. “I just know it was your idea.”
“Well, that sounds like…” He read it again, and then one more time before looking toward the painting, who was still glaring at him.
His hand gripped the back of Potter’s neck as he pulled Potter on top of him and pressed his lips against Potter’s firmly and in a
“Not to mention their power is borrowed until their next fix,” Draco plowed on, ignoring him completely. “The magic to them is so weak, so laughable. I mean, I can
“I know,” Draco said as he picked at a spot of paint on his wrist he only just noticed. “And I appreciate it, but I’m fine.”
Hermione, while I like her, and I love her beliefs towards Magical Creatures, I couldn't ignore one of her most irritating character traits. Her rigid belief in books and what she perceives as facts. I never did like the way she treated Luna, even if Luna seemed crazy and outlandish. Who was Hermione to try and change her beliefs?
More than air came with the gasp—out came the soul that was easily sucked in by a Dementor as another one lowered Draco into Harry’s waiting arms.
“No, it’s fine.” Malfoy’s lips twitched. “This wasn’t what I had in mind, but it’ll do. Good job, Finnigan.”
Draco had no clue where to start. He thought back over the few methods he had witnessed and didn’t like any of them. Salt was out of the question, he still wasn’t sure how to make a Muggle card work, the rocks in the water were too much work, no way in hell he was about to touch any animal bones, nor was he going to look like an idiot as he spun around in a circle. There
“Lucky,” Potter repeated, eyes trailing over Draco’s face in a way that made his skin crawl. It was too deep, too searching.
The customer was wary as he stepped forward and placed a book on the counter. “I just want to sell this. The bookstores in Diagon Alley kicked me out for even trying.”
