As Harry was walking around Vernon the grumpy man grabbed Harry's shoulder softly then he whispered in his ear, "be ready for today boy." There was a long pause. Harry's eyes went wide, body frozen. Then the hand on his shoulder tightened and gripped him harder, "and don't you dare mess anything up boy." He pushed Harry forward not caring that he had made the boy drop to his knees. Only laughed at the pained expression.
"R-right" Harry nodded nervously and rapidly
"Please don't...." A few tears started to run down Harry's cheeks. "Please..." He whispered.
Both stared directly at eachother's eyes. Draco stared at cute emerald eyes as Harry stared at handsom Gray- silverish eyes. Harry realising what they had been doing for who knows how long, felt the heat go up his face as he started blushinf so he looked away. Draco realising this too, went back to pulling away the curtain. Mentally getting angry at himself.
"Oh right well we'll be off" Lucius said grabbing Draco's shoulder.
"No" Draco said as everyone turned to look at him "Luvano" he saw everyone's faces get filled with questions except his Godfathers
"Aunt?" Draco called out.
"Hmf" Draco walked away from the bed not looking to Harry's direction and walked out of the room. Harry looked worried. Maybe draco really didn't like him at all?
Harry feeling his body tried to move but since he couldn't he stopped. Harry could hear voices. He suddenly recalled what had happened before. 'Where was he? Was he safe now? Who were the people that saved him? Why couldn't he move? Why did his jaw feel sore but not broken anymore?' He suddenly asked himself getting worried. He tried to relax as he heard the voices getting a bit louder
"Draco?" Draco turned to look at his mother's disappointed face. Draco didn't care.
"Well we have news oh and they are very . . . " Sirius said stuck
In one quick movement, Uncle Vernon grabs Harry by the neck pulling him up from the floor again smiling at him too protruding that it becomes another burning memory. He laughed as he picked up his other arm and hit Harry right in the face. The impact burned onto his skin.
"Abro" said Lucius who had pointed his wand at him and said the spell
If Harry was lucky, 'aunt' Petunia wouldn't complain today, nor would Dudley suggest anything, getting away with only 15 lashes.
"What do you want?"once pushing his mother away he Finally realised the situation. He went to get his wand but he didn't see it only Harry's. He turned to Harry and saw his wand in the Gryffindor's hand.
Sirius smiled nervously going to Harry. Lupin had stayed too so he fallowed Sirius.
"What is it Malfoy?" Harry asked with a curious tone
"I will not repeat myself!" Vernon could hear the stomping feet of his son before he appeared by the door leading to the kitchen and living room door, stopping midway as he spotted his father.
"R-right" Harry stuttered, "what is it that you need?"
"Potter! You stupid!" He yelled kneeling on the floor with Harry. Harry seemed unhurt yet unconscious
'Cute' Draco thought 'Damn I can't think stuff like this! But then again he knows I'm good now'
"AVADA KEDAVRA!" Voldemort yelled
Aunt Petunia was upstairs bathing. Dudley was watching T.V and thankfully it was one of his favorites, so he was too concentrated to torment Harry, but it was almost 5:45. Harry sweated more than he needed to as he watched the time tick by. With his sweaty palms, he spun the spoon in the pot
"My lord!" Bellatrix said happily as he came in.
Harry looked saddly at Draco for moving his hand.
"You-!" When he saw Harry look up at him with fear, Vernon said, "you have been telling those- monstrosities about us?" Malice filled his voice like he'd gotten stung. "You ungrateful bastard! You've been living off of us like a sponge, infecting us with that ugliness of yours. You will pay for this. You will pay for this boy!"
Harry hearing a datk voice ooened his eyes. He saw Lucius' eyes and the man looked down. He saw where his eyes were pointing and he saw Draco's wand.
Snape looked at him annoyed "If you wish to know stop disturbing me and Listen" he said angrily staring daggers at everyone but Professor McGonagall, since she had been  listening quietly. "A heat is where the dominating one will have a trail where he would have to get to the submissive and mate with him." He stared at everyone making sure they didn't ask anything. Relaxing he started once again to explain. "When you mate, you have to have a sexual relationship with your submissive if you're the dominate one, which be careful because only the submissive one can get pregnant, which is why Potter's body is creating a womb." He sighed and looked at everyone's faces which were surprised and kinda blushing.
"Tell Draco what will happen once Mr. Potter goes into his monthly heat" Dumbledore said having already known everything
There stood his 'uncle' standing at the doorway red in the face, fat and ugly with sweat falling down his neck and forehead. Eyes glaring away at Harry. His wrinkled blue collared dress shirt and ugly brown suit, with his fake leathery case. Approaching him slowly and looking down Harry maintained his own trembling body.
Harry looked at her and sighed. All this time he had been sleeping in the room Harry was in, waititng for him to wake up.
“You kids have a curfew.” Filch took on the grave gravely tone that he loved to use when threatening kids with detention. It was a tone that should and use to bring a chill of dread down Harry’s spine. Now though, he felt didn’t less scared than just tired.
years who were more interested in talking to their coffees than relaying the tediousness of their latest 15-foot-long essay due in herbology.
Unable to handle restless tingling in his legs, Harry sits up, throwing his feet over the side onto the floor. Palming blindly, he snatches up his glasses on the nightstand.
floor. The grinding of stones started to bound off the cavernously tall walls as the stars start to slowly turn. Blessedly Harry makes it to the landing just before they decide to change, swinging widely to the right towards the west wing. He just caught sight of the edges of Malfoy’s robes as he turned the corner at the end of the long hall. Picking up his pace, Harry followed, wishing he had his map to make things easier.
Unfortunately, all of the Living Stones that could be found on the banks were plucked cleaning, meaning they had to get in the lake and search in the shallow shores. It is tedious, bodily work that left Harry’s mind with nothing to do but wander.
“And twenty more for the lip.”
“And he was acquitted. Really, Ron, vanity isn’t a crime.” Hermione was right, the situation was barely within his control, and telling another adult could easily spiral it out. The more who knew the more who would try to put their thumbs on the scale. The effects of which could destroy a lot of people’s lives. The courts so far had been accepting to look the other way when it came to death eaters’ kids, accepting that they were basically indoctrinated too young to know better. That didn’t mean though that there weren’t people still trying to get people like Malfoy kissed by a dementor, or worse.
Then taking a sharp turn around the corner he could start to hear someone talking. Dropping down his center of gravity he slowly crept up to the next bend in the path. Just around that corner, on the other side. At the other end was the burned remains of a massive antique, Chinese cabinet. The painted redwood was charred black with massive splinters caused by the inferno’s heat exposing the lightwood, and chuck of the mother of pearl inlay had fallen loose. Pressing his back to the cabinet Harry strained his ears to hear what was happening.
“I just don’t feel good.” He mumbles an in a very un-Malfoy way he refused to make eye contact while speaking. In fact, everything about his was very uncharacteristic of a Malfoy. He was slouching in his seat, trying to make himself look as small a possible, eyes downcast and disarray to his hair that on anyone else would look natural but to a Malfoy’s normally polished look a complete disaster. He did indeed look very unwell.
“I asked if you’re going to the library for your free period?” The first classes hadn’t even started and already Hermione had her old school habits in place, complete with timetables and color-coding notes.  She found comfort in that regularity and he was happy she could find that. However, he definitely didn’t want to join her yet. Just the thought of being stuck inside the tall bookshelves of the library made his skin feel tight. He felt cramped, hot, and stifled. He needed fresh air.
(See the end of the chapter for
The sun would be coming up soon and Harry knew that he wouldn’t be getting any more sleep tonight. It would just be best to conserve what little energy he was able to scrounge together. He just laid there on his back, counting the enchanted stars painted across the top of the bed canopy, listening to the excitable birds chirping from the world outside the castle.
Just like that it’s gone, like it was never there to begin with, no more real than Harry’s dreams about his godfather.
“Come on” Harry commanded, starting to walk along the shore, “let’s get this over with so we can head back.”
More unsettling though, it seemed like it was staring back.
“He deserves it for a lot more than that.”
“The last time I saw it Dumbledore said that men have wasted away looking at it.” That caught her attention, she looked ready to race to the library that second. Ron however simply sneered, looking like this conversation had already gone longer than he cared for.
He is trudging through mud. Harry literally feels as if he is completely submerged in a muddy trench and is foggy mindedly trying to walk through his day. He would be worried he was asleep on his feet if he had thought he had ever managed to sleep at all the night previously. Rubbing at his aching eyes, knocking his eyes askew, Harry enters the Great Hall.
In the first year, he had the slight glimmer of hope that sleep would come easier and for a while it was. But as the first year came to an end, the nightmares started up. Repeated and foggy images of snake eyes, green lights, and screaming. He thought they were terrible as a kid, unfortunately, they only got worse. Now they had evolved into full-blown night terrors, severe enough that Harry probably should have considered therapy or at least a good bottle of Fire Whiskey and an Obliviate to the face.
Malfoy was looking stormy as he marched down the hall. Even in the heat, Malfoy was wearing his full robes, every button in its place. Just looking at him made Harry feel stifling hot. However, it could just be the low-level anger that sparked whenever he saw Malfoys face.
Turning the corner, Harry skidded to a stop, nearly colliding into the other man.
Harry took a seat at the Gryffindor table, his hip giving a disturbingly loud crack as he swung his legs around the bench. Neville, beside him, gave an understanding smile as he chewed on some eggs. Across the table, Hermione was cradling a cup of hot tea, peering at a copy of the prophet, seemingly trying to ignore Ron who was content to play with the frizzy curls of her hair. The pair seemed attached at the hip… no closer, attached at the lungs since they seemed to breathe the exact same breath every second since the battle of Hogwarts. Harry was mildly surprised when he didn’t see rings on their fingers when he finally found them on the Platform.
There was nothing there. Well, nothing that Harry would call an illusion. All he saw was himself and Malfoy’s reflections staring back at him. Was the mirror not working? He looked back at Malfoy to see if he looked just as confused. Whatever Malfoy was seeing, though, actually had a smile on his pale pink lips. He looks completely at peace.
HOW SCARED SHOULD WE BE?
while sipping her tea. She was always there first thing in the morning and finished with her food by the time Harry and Ron managed to stumble in. She had the front of her hair tied up to avoid falling into her teacup. Whatever she was reading fully had her attention, eyes not even skipping a line as she bent over to accept Ron’s kiss to the temple.
Harry, ultimately turns around and heads back towards the stairs, ignoring the voice in his head urging him to keep following Malfoy. The trek back to the Gryffindor tower is a well memorized one, he could probably do it blindly now. The Castle put back so completely to the way it once was that some days harry questioned if anything the year prior had happened. The only traces of the last battle were the scars, physical, mental, and emotional.
The second day was worse. His thoughts wouldn’t focus on class, and every time he glanced around the room, he saw several people glance away. Malfoy never did. He always met Harry’s stare directly, but from across the classroom, across the Great Hall, across the sunny grounds, Harry couldn’t smell him. It bothered him. He couldn’t tell from Malfoy’s face what he was thinking, and for several seconds during Transfiguration, he wondered if Malfoy would smell angry again. If he would smell aroused. Harry refused to entertain that thought for longer than a split second. He didn’t
“Shut the hell up Malfoy.” He lurched forward, the heat was bubbling up, his heart was starting to race again. It had been so long since he felt this level of adrenaline, everything seemed clearer. Having more detail. He was ready to keep Malfoy from talking anyway he could. “Or else.”
“Don’t you have some helpless muggles to save from their own stupidity?” He rolled his eyes, even as a disgraced heir of a murders fortune and Malfoy still acted like he was the biggest Prat in the Northern Hemisphere.
“Malfoy could get in a lot of trouble if he is accused of anything.” Hermione, answered for him, already having the words that Harry had been struggling with for hours. “Especially if it's Harry doing it.”
“Come on Malfoy,” Harry tried again, extending his hand once more clearly into Malfoy’s line of sight, “we have been here for hours.” Malfoy ignored him, simply shifting to his right so that Harry’s hand was no longer obstructing his view, “You need sleep.”
“Couldn’t sleep,” Harry flatly said, feeling no need to hide what he was doing, “Taking a walk.”
Harry nodded, “Dumbledore did say he hid it so no one could find it.”
Harry was leaned up against the opposite wall, tucked into and barely visible alcove simply watching the windows. He was memorized by watching the dozens of windows, each with a mythical creature silently acted out the best moments of their idealized image. They were lifelike, similar to the portraits, but they were silent and didn’t gossip or call attention to harry as the chattier pictures could. They gave him the space to think and watch.
“They are having a riveting conversation.” Luna smiled, nodding her head like she could hear what was being said and agreed with them. “They have been quite talkative this last week. I’ve even seen Professor Davies speaking excitedly to them on the edge of the forest. They must have some wonderful stories to tell,” Luna added, sounding like this was a perfectly normal statement. Which they were, at least for her.
“My Gran has a tranquility portion if you would like to try it.” Neville offered, leaning away from the conversation he was previously in with Seamus. “It’s an herbal family recipe. I could have her send you some potions.”
He saw movement in the corner of his eye, it was his own reflection bouncing off the glass of the trophy cabinets. His hair was a mess, he looked like Teddy after an exciting day at the zoo that ended in an obsession with the petting zoo and peanut butter in his ear. The glare of his own reflection made him feel like a kid again and not in a fun way. It was in that way that reminded him of stale air and cupboard spiders. He looked as ridiculous as he was acting, chasing Malfoy in the halls like a first year.
On the ground, Harry noticed several overlapping smeared footprints in the ash. Someone has been here and more than once. All of them headed to and from the same direction. Whoever was here knew where they were going and what they were looking for in between the smoldering maze walls.
“I don’t know but I could hear him talking to someone.”
“Okay, Mate, see you later.” Ron waved him away, throwing his arm over Hermione’s shoulder and heading towards the entrance hall.
The few who still sat there, this morning, we're the ones who ignored it, were going to keep their heads down until graduation, the defiant ones, ready to verbally brawl with whoever gave a side-eye, and the first years, many who cried as the sorting hat announced their new house. He didn’t know how the year would go, and with it being his last he didn’t have much energy to care, but he knew that McGonagall would have an uphill battle with reuniting the four houses.
Malfoy stopped, wheeling around to glare at Harry. His face was flushed absolutely red and his breather was heavy.
“What is the meaning of this?” A raspy voice with surprising force questioned. Professor Mot was marching towards them, the brass of his walking stick clacking against the rocks. It was eerie to see him walking so easily, His milky eyes were staring straight out, blindly, but he never once seemed to stumble. Almost as if he could see perfectly well. He gripped the handle of the cane in a vice, the bones of his knuckles sticking out. With a grave expression on his face, he waited for one of them to answer his question.
Luna was over Neville; His lips were blue and skin pale. She was frantically waving her wand, trying to magically pull the water out of his lungs. Long disgusting steam of murky water came from his mouth and with a sudden gasp, Neville was breathing again.
Pulling out his wand, Harry pressed against the wall. Slowly he opened the door and pivoted to look through the small gap inside. The room was huge and he could see no sign of movement. Quickly he slipped through the gap in the door, clicking it close behind him.
“Excuse me?” Malfoy looked shocked and appalled.
Then, just as he was sure he would drown, an air bubble popped into existence around his head. Looking up Harry saw Luna, air bubble around her head, wand pointed at the creatures. He couldn’t hear as she said but suddenly a blast of stunning light hit the merperson on his right square in the chest. The creature let out a pitiful screech as its muscles locked up and it began to sink to the bottom of the lake, taking Harry with it.
“They would claim Harry is a Death eater if they thought they could get away with it.” Ron leafed through the pile of news that Hermione had already read, pulling out the sports section.
of a cm.
“Not till you tell me what you’re doing.”
“Please, I was flying circles around you since we were kids.” Malfoy actually laughed. A real laugh, it was excitable and jingled in the air like wind chimes made of seashells.
“You self-righteous… Go away!”
Silently they boarded the craft. As Luna set down, the boat lurched into movement, pulling away from the shore and heading back towards the castle. Harry felt nostalgic for half a moment, remembering his first experience seeing the castle, settled in a self-driving boat just like this one. He missed the air of wonder he felt seeing the twinkling lights over the lake.
“Ron.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bending over, Harry fishes it out from a small pile of ash. Cleaning it off against his sleeve he inspects the small trinket. It’s a glass teardrop-shaped pendant on a delicate, silver chain. Inside is the tiniest white flowers Harry has ever seen. The long stems bend forward at the end, giving way to white bell-like flower petals. They also seemed to actually be alive. The topper is an intricate magically formed silver piece of cascading flowers. Amongst them is the carved initials D.L.M. This is Malfoy’s. Pocking the necklace, Harry leads for the exit.
Why did he have to make everything harder? “Look just take it Malfoy.”
“And it’s in the Room of Requirements now?” Ron seemed gobbed smacked.
“It’s getting late. “Harry announced, stretching his back, a few joints cracking pleasurably, “We should head to bed.” Standing up, he offered a hand to help Malfoy up as well.
As Harry made his first of three passes over where the room of requirements would appear, he looked over at the opposite wall and froze.
The heating charm placed upon the stone floor guaranteed that Harry could comfortably walk the dark castle in nothing but socked feet. Making his sudden surveillance vastly easier, Malfoys own hard souled slippers aiding announcing somewhat where he was heading.
The man was far more self-assured and fiercer fighter than once perceived before the Battle but he never lost the sensitive edge to him. It was for the better; honestly, the world could use more Neville’s in it, for what Harry’s opinions were worth. The orange eyes were far too similar though to the Golden gaze of Hedwig’s. The ache in Harry’s chest chiseled into a chasm, he missed her. Her cage set empty in the corner; no amount of logic could stop Harry’s urge to bring it with him. Now it just simply set on one of his bedside tables, like it always had, door unlocked and open slightly. The memory of her body falling out the sky flashed before his eyes, followed cruelly by the image of blank open eyes. How many empty wide pupils eyed stares had Harry had to confront so far.
“Come on,” Hermione primly folded up the paper, tucking it between several textbooks. “We have to get to the Potions basement.” Pulling her wand from her hair, making the slightly frizzy curls cascade down in a way that made Ron’s face flush ever so slightly.
At the front of the hall, settled into their seat along with the head table, were the professors. Hagrid sat at the far end, making quick work of a massive stack of sausage, chatting boisterously with a cheery Professor Sprout and an elderly looking wizard by the name of Professor Mot. He had severe cheekbones with little to no fat on them, his body seeming to reject age, and the sagging wrinkles that usually accompanied it. Whether sitting or standing he always seemed to be leaning at a 45 Degree angle, usually placing his full weight onto a polished carved cane.
“Look at this.” Neville slowly rolled the body onto its side, along with the mermaid's back were three deep-set cuts, freshly made. The cuts were deep enough to expose the bone, but there was no blood around them, not pinking the water or dappling the shore. It was hard to tell what caused the cuts, they were definitely too smooth and organized for claws but the potential for magic or knives was up in the air. Whoever did it though had been prepared; this wasn’t some random predator looking for a quick snack.
(See the end of the chapter for
As they swam, he watched as underwater plants swayed in the current, lazily dancing. They were close enough to the surface that he could pop his head up every few feet and make sure the waves hadn’t knocked them off course. The light dappled through the waves, creating streaks through the water like stingless on church floors. It was almost beautiful in its own way but that didn’t mean the creatures within the waters were any less dangerous.
having spent the free time after dinner to fly again, Harry didn’t even bother to close his though, he was the last to bed. It was a fruitless attempt to try and exhaust himself into sleeping. Now his mind was muddy, racing and his limbs ached from overwork yet the inexplicable need to just simply keep moving.
Suddenly, scaring the heart straight into Harry’s throat, a person swiftly passed in front of him. Peeking around the corner he could see a set of dark robes skimming along the ground. There was a flash of chalky white hair, white enough to make the moon look dull by comparison A head of hair that Harry practically had a Pavlovian response to reach for his wand over. Draco Malfoy was wandering the halls late at night. Why would he be doing that?
Lurching forward, Harry grasps the Snitch between his fingers just in time to throw his weight to the side avoiding a collision with the other man.
“I mean,” He gasped one last breath before standing to his full height, “You’re a dick and I want round two.” Malfoy took a step back, out of Harry’s reach. He reached for his wand but Harry threw his hands up though to show he wasn’t going to hurt anyone. “Quidditch!” He nearly shouted, which made Malfoy freeze, looking completely shocked. “One round to settle the score.”
“I don’t know Hermione,” Ron admitted, throwing an arm around her waist. “I don’t like the idea that he is messing around in the Room of Requirements again.”
Seeing his window of opportunity slipping, Harry grabs Malfoy’s arm. Instantly Malfoy tenses up, yanking to try and slip Harry’s grip. Harry refused to let go. There was no way that he was going to let Malfoy a single step closer to the Room of Requirements, “How about we make this more interesting.” With his free hand, Harry digs into his pant pocket, pulling out the delicate little charm he found weeks ago. He held it up, enjoying the way the light bounced off the nearly translucent crystal glass. “If you win, I will give you this.”
He doesn’t know how long it takes to actually navigate his way out of the Room of Requirements, just that it takes long enough for him to question if the sun is up already, but once in the hall, he can see that night is still thick and the castle sleeps. Rolling the trinket between his fingers Harry heads back to the Gryffindor common room. He needs to dig out his map. Malfoy was still in the room and he was up to something. Harry needed to know what and for how long. Shoving the necklace back into his pocket he picked up his pace.
The ribbon with his name on it was stationary, no footprints around it, meaning that Malfoy hadn’t moved in a while, even within the room.
That last question was the one that always tripped Harry up. He asked it far too often in the middle of the night. In those soft morning hours, he would, with a foggy mind, circle around this question for what felt like years.
That’s when something glimmering catches his eyes, a pale shock of light against the murky waters of the lake. A large shone was blocking Harry from getting a clear view without getting closer.  Placing his bag of Living Stones, Harry walked towards the glimmer. It was hard to tell if it was alive, the waves against the shore made it sway back and forth. Rounding the sides of the largest stone Harry finally saw what was in the water. With a jolt, he pulled back, “Hey! Guys!”
“You know what that is?” Hermione looked surprised.
He had never been a good sleeper per se, living under a staircase can do that to you. Mornings were always a crashing shove into wakefulness as Aunt Petunia, as light as she was, would all but stomp down the stairs, blearily searching out her morning cup of tea and spot to peer over the hedge fence. At nights Vernon, who would stay up late watching the news, oftentimes falling asleep in his recliner, snoring like a great gagging walrus which Harry could hear with such vivid clarity it seeped into his dreams. Then there was his cousin, Dudley, who may have been a master at sneaking past his parents’ room, for a secretive midnight snack, but his hefty footfalls could never evade Harry’s attention.
“Piss off.” A small amount of spittle hitting Hary in the cheek. Suddenly Harry felt like a kid again, like they were back in 2nd year and toeing off in dueling club. Had really nothing changed? Why did that fact make Harry feel so down? He suddenly didn't care much anymore to keep up the front to fight. what was the point? Seemed like nothing was going to change.
Within ten minutes, he had a light sheen of sweat along his brow and the ache of tiredness was replaced with an ache of exertion. He catches and releases the snitch over and over, each time closing his eyes to give it the chance to hide again.
“There we are, right as rain.” He cupped the chirping bird, softly petting its feathered head. The bird gave a little song then took flight, only to then land on his shoulder to nip at his ear. Davies turned back to the front of the classroom and with a flick of his wand started inscribing the steps onto the chalkboard, “Now this potion will take multiple days to make. It is due next class but I expect to see you before then, tending to your work.” With that, he settled down into his seat and began reading notes. When none of the students made a move to start working, he yelled, “Well, get bloody started you don’t have all damn day.” In a flurry everyone stood up at once, making a dash for the ingredients closet.
"I had. Disappointed it wasn't permanent?" Malfoy sneered back. Harry struggled not to let his face show any disappointment, or the excitement that was suddenly welling up in him.
“‘S’fine. I’m fine.” Harry assured him, offering him a smile. Ron smiled back, his own nose able to tell him Harry was, indeed, fine.
“That’s… biting, right? Why’s that such a bad thing, anyway?” Harry asked, not wanting Malfoy to do it, but still curious. He thought maybe he should save his questions for Hermione. She was less volatile, less… naked. But Malfoy was here, under him,
me, and I guess… I like it a little rough.”
“Alright.” Harry agreed, though he hadn’t a clue how she expected him to make things hard for THEM. He’d be the one suffering, afterall.
“Well, there’s no help for it. You’ll have to suffer through your heat, on your own. I recommend cold showers and-”
“Cheers.” Malfoy replied, and lifted the glass he was holding in toast to Harry’s subversive pettiness. Ginny grinned, glad that they’d decided to get along. Harry knew she had no idea what she’d just done by inviting him.
“But… Can’t you just… Ask Pomfrey if there’s any other alternative to sleeping with
“Yeah. Me, Ginny, and Charlie. Does it suddenly bother you?” Ron asked, and Harry could see the tension in his shoulders, as if he was preparing for a fight. The tangy smell filled the space between them, and Harry rushed to calm his friend down.
the same way the Gryffindor dorms did.
“I’m fine. It was a bit… strong, yeah.” He licked his lips, and shrugged. Ron let out a laugh.
“Yes. A rather clever bit of charmwork. The door reads you as you approach it, and when you touch the knob, a bit of your magic goes into the room, and makes it just what you like. It’s the same at upscale wizarding hotels.” She waved a hand dismissively, but he and Ron shared a look. How on EARTH did she know what upscale wizarding hotels were like?
“Thank you. Any children of your own, yet?” Harry knew the slight narrowing of his eyes was an indicator of him fishing for something more than the answer to his question, Ginny glanced at Harry with a small, sad smile.
“You’re doing it again.” Ron informed him, and Harry offered him a tight smile.
The new door had the same handle as the door to the hall, and it revealed a bedroom. Deep ruby red sheets draped elegantly along a huge four-poster bed hung with equally rich purple curtains. At the foot of the bed stood his trunk, already brought up by the elves. There was a bedside table made of wood equally as dark as the previous room’s furniture, and a narrow desk against one wall, next to another door. Harry moved toward it, certain that there wasn’t possibly enough space between where his door had been and the end of the hall for so much space, and smiled to himself as he praised the magical work that allowed so many extra students to come back to school.
you might be able to actually help yourself.” She took a short quick breath and straightened her spine as if putting that bit behind her and facing the next sentence with dignity.
Harry felt himself relax as Malfoy spoke. It was almost like listening to one of Hermione’s lectures. Comforting, familiar, and gave him ideas.
Malfoy stood near the back, arms crossed, eyes flickering around the Eighth Years warily, as if waiting for someone to turn and curse him. Harry found it hard to blame him, and dragged his eyes away, back to McGonagall as she spoke again.
"I don't hate you. I just want you to leave." Malfoy said, looking away. Harry stared at him a minute, exploring the slightly aged face, the way he stood, the way his fingers picked nervously at his robes.
Ron grumbled, and looked away, but didn’t argue. Harry shot Hermione another grateful smile.
"I met his son." Harry replied with every bit of nonchalance he could muster. Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry gulped nervously. She couldn't know.
“But… I don’t really GET pheromones at all! So, Alphas smell good, okay. Omegas smell… However we smell, and those are ‘pheromones’, but that’s just like everyone has a smell! You can’t control someone just by smelling a certain way!” Harry fumed. Hermione sighed.
Draco caught up to the pair as Harry felt a stab of melancholy into his very soul. He hadn’t even realized that he had feelings beyond the sexual for Malfoy until AFTER he’d agreed to marry Ginny.
"Oh, really? You THINK you're in love with me? That's just sad. You THOUGHT you wanted to marry that redheaded bint, and before that, you THOUGHT you liked what we had going. Before THAT, you thought you hated me! I suggest you figure out your head, Potter. I have a child, now. I'm RESPONSIBLE for that tiny bundle of life. I can't afford to let you overturn my life, just because you THINK you have feelings deeper than a puddle."
His lips were warm, soft, and followed by sharp teeth. Harry hissed at the painful snap, but as Scorpius shifted in his arms again, he pulled away from the kiss. Draco frowned at him, and Harry smirked. He stood to place the sleeping infant back in his crib, staring at him a moment, filled with a warm love and hopefulness that he hadn’t felt in years.
“Really. We’ve both been unfaithful, and we want different things from our lives. A divorce is for the best.” He assured her, noting the shock in her eyes. She wasn’t sure how he knew about her own infidelity, but she wasn’t going to ask.
Harry leapt at that chance, unable to let the opportunity pass by. He snatched Draco by the neck, and brought their lips together, kissing him more fiercely than he'd ever dared to kiss Ginny. He drug his fingers through the long silky strands of hair, and grabbed handfuls of dark, expensive robes, pushing Malfoy bodily backward. The feeling of kissing him again, finally touching him, breathing in his scent, was a deep relief that seemed to sooth everything wrong in his life.
"I'm serious, Draco. I don't just want empty words." Harry declared. Malfoy glared at him, and shook his arm free.
all over you! I thought it was just a coincidence the first few times, some sort of pisisng contest, like you said the other day, with Smith… But I saw him! I SAW him leaving your room this morning! And suddenly you’re not in heat! You’re
makes me want to fuck you between classes, just to see their faces when they smell me on you.” He murmured right in Harry’s ear. Harry shivered at the low sound of it. The threat.
“Do what? Ask you to help me?” Harry asked, thoroughly confused.
~*~*~*~*~*~
Harry opened his eyes very slowly. He looked toward where the voices were and saw two men kneeling next to him. One man was young with blonde colored hair, the other an older man with also blonde hair. Harry looked around him. He couldn't see very far because his glasses were gone. In the distance, he could here only wind rustling the trees.
"I was talking with Dumbledore a few hours ago and until now we didn't comfirm it but Now that Harry can't stay away from Draco he'll be staying with us" Lucius informed them
He answered, but then added "I got it the day before yesterday, I couldn't bring them with yesterday for an unknown reason"
Harry had slammed the door shut in his room, but with nothing to lock his door from the inside had him sitting behind it. He could hear the thumping of his heart, his lip trembled as he heard the undeniable steps of his 'uncle' coming up.
He realised he had been taking long so he pulled out the invicible cloak his father had given him to give to Harry.
"Damm would have been Pansy! Thank you!" Draco said happily but then feeling stares he saw everyone staring "What? She forcefully kissed me, it actually surprised me."
"Ye-no" Said Snape interuppting Dumbledore, he stared at him seriously and said "There is no need for you guys to know at the moment. Now you guys can go"
"Potter! Potter wake up!" Someone yelled
Sirius Black was sitting in the chair in the living room of his lover's home, Remus Lupin. Remus walked into the room carrying snacks and orange juice, which Sirius liked to drink. "Heard from Harry lately Sirius? Sirius!"
"What is it Harry Potter Sir?" Dobby asked worriedly as he saw his expression. Harry rapidly pointed to the door
It seemed like she had been knocking at his door. Draco passed her smoothly without looking at her once.
"R-right" Harry blushed again. But before Harry can put it on the door opened
"Ya see Potter, I always get what I want and, right now, I want you" he nibbled on Harry's earlobe, moving his lips further up, pressing them against the shell of his ear before tracing it with his tongue, making Harry shiver.
"Potter do not force yourself if you're going to end up with a fever" Draco said upset still not moving from his spot
"My father old Dumbledore about the situation, so he ended up sendiding it to him. Then my dad gave it to me to give it to you"
Harry sat on the bed writing a letter, having found some paper in between the books. He writing and hopeing to send it to his uncle. He was very excited to attend there wedding once they arranged and when they clarrified Sirius' framing is when they had the chance to fully start plannung the date of it. He hoped to be the first to be able to hear about.
"Yes Sir"Dobby said as he went to go do just that
"No!" Bellatrix yelled "STUPID BOY YOU GOT IN MY WAY! I'LL HAVE TO REVERSE IT!!"
They both walk in, the room felt warm as they went in but the room looked dusty and moldy. Draco smiled "You might have hated him, but to me he was something special"
"You were the one that put the note in my palm so Harry or Ron could see it in 2nd year?" Hermione asked happily. Draco look at her surprised. Everyone else looked at her surprised. So she sighed "I would never rip out a page out of a book, at best I'll st- i mean borrow the book"
Harry heard his godfather and his fiance leave the room, while Ms. Promfey also left to her room. Thinking everyone had left he sat up but he caught sight of a man in black, so he gasped out shock.
"B-but" Harry tried to argue
"Look shut up and relax, you're sick right now!" Draco said getting annoyed
"Im going to respond to their letters" Harry asked confused since there was a sudden change in Draco's Character. He was so surprised he just stared at Draco while answering him
"When you go into the first heat you mark your submissive. The mark and everything you do as a dominanat gets you to have a bit of control over the submissive, even bringing them into heat if you wished it so. As for why Lily ended up with James is because, I knew she loved James so I let her go, my mark disappeared after Harry was born" Snape said saddly, everyone except Draco knew he loved lily and letting her go would have probably been his greatest regret.
"Give them" Harry said with pout trying to reach them
Sirius went ahead and explained almost everything he had heard from Snape. Sometimes Snape would barge in and add something Sirius missed. As Sirius said all this Harry stared into Sirius' eyes to make sure he wasn't lying. Blushing and taking it all in.
"Potter!" Harrry jumped at the sudden call and turned to look at the guy who had called him.
"Draco?" Harry asked
Draco laughed at the letter. The boys handwriting was so bad, it was a mystery how Harry could read this. Then again draco thought 'Potter's writing is just as bad'. Draco changed went to his Dresser and grabed his pajamas, he put the pajamas on. Went to his personal restroom and washed his face, brushed his teeth, and put his dirty laundry away. Once ready for bed he saw his eagle owl come in looking at the snowy owl, Dragon just sat next to Harry's owl. Dragon was also carrying an letter. Draco went to get his letter. He opened it up carefully and sat down on his bed laying down and getting comftorble.
"I don't know. He looked like he was beaten up good. Go." The man said trying to calm down
"What spell?" Madame Promfey asked
This was too much for Harry and as his head started spinning he could hear them asking him questions and felt himself being lifted. Once again, he blacked out.
He knew any minute now that an alarm would ring and he'd have to get up from the bed. The thought of leaving his bed to face his world, made him want to stick himself to the ground. Memories of his last days would pass through his mind as if he were falling down an endless hole. His feet twitched at the intense feeling of running. A feeling of finding a way out of the body he inhabits. He wanted badly for his body not to be his. He wants to be able to fly high in his broom with the wind in his face, fear of nothing, but that just isn't him. All he felt was hopelessness, salvation was something he needed to get on his own.
"Here" Draco said pulling out a smaller flask.
"Yes" snape answered
"Yes, but I mean you can still wear your glasses, except with no prescription" Draco adviced
"He knows" Snape said coldly "An if you want to know what he feels about it ask him yourself. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a class to attend to" With that Snape left without a single sound other than the door opening and closing.
He stared for little but at Harry's lightning scar. Then put the towel on Harry's forehead. Harry shivered at the coolness of the towel.
As Draco had watched him he saw Harry had slowly mouthed his name, it wasn't the usual 'Malfoy', no it was his real name Draco. He looked at Harry surprised this time though he didn't change as quickly as the other times.
"Well it is why only 2 people have been able to cast it. And uncast it" Dumbledore said
Harry feeling the long stare turned away with a blush and started speaking "S-so how do we do this?" Harry didn't turn to look at Draco since he saw how dark it had gotten, it wasn't the afternoon anymore.
"Agh!" Harry smiled happily not breaking concentration. And pleased at the dark man's anguish
Harry fell to the floor. He was breathing heavily. His stomach pain finally came back. The next thing he realizes is the blackness swallowing. The last thig he hears is his favorite voice "Harry!"
" . . . " Harry didn't know how to respond. It felt like it was longer than it had been, that he heard his voice.
"Bring it here Dobby" Harry said with a smile he then turned to Draco, "It's okay Malfoy, I need to start using it, plus your potion helps"
Your Best Friend,
"Be quiet boy! Hand me the keys!" Vernon snatched the keys and went out the door, after checking no one was out or watching. Throwing the body in the trunk, he got in and drove off.
"Well I'll leave you to rest now" Draco happily said he saw Potter move his hand to grab him like before, but before Harry could do that, Draco moved his hand making Harry miss.
"Go pick up my bags and the mailman should be coming soon, be ready for it," Vernon said letting a bit of spit out of his mouth.
"Am i invited?"
Draco came in.
"So what you're saying is that Me and Draco are to be mated and I'll be raped by my dominant because im a submissive and the reason why I'm having these stomachaches is because my body is creating a womb to hold the babies we might have?" Harry asked getting out of the shock he just got, summarizing everything.
"Alright" Harry had smiled nervously at the serious man. He left the room kinda like Snape would e nter a room.
"Mr. Weasly refrain your language please" Professor McGonagall said in a very sophisticated voice
Trying to hurry he went back downstairs to get the other 'sack' this time noticing that his 'uncle' wasn't there. He sighed in full relief even as his body trembled. Quickly he ran to get the other bag. Thankfully he got it done faster than the other because the bag was lighter.
"You finish?" He asked not saying hello or hi. Harry about to shake his head no was stopped by Draco's words "Why didn't you the bacon?"
"Lets get him to the room." The young blonde man stated as he walked along the other man.
bit of anger in his voice
Harry nodded but then had to asked dobby something. Dobby was grabing the food for Harry picling it up slowly and walking to the bed. He got help from Harry to put it on his lap. Dobby smiled to thank Harry and then saw Harry's eyes. Harry then taped his rist "Time?" Dobby asked
"Im sor- no need I remember him telling me he was ready to die" Malfoy stopped Harry from finishing. He smirked at Harry "Now if you'll excuse me I have some stuff to do, unless you want to treat me like a lover who doesn't want me to go."
Harry blushed feeling the tingling of Draco's breath. Blinking at the sudden sensation. They stood there for a few more seconds until Harry tried to grabb the papers "Malfoy given them to me"
"You'll have to stay here until your school year at Hogwarts starts" He said. Harry looked away to try to look around but there were curtians all around his bed and they were all pulled down. So he couldn't see anything. "I'll tell an elf to put those up later don't worry, you'll be alright, you're not in the safest place put we'll keep you a secret"
"obby!" Harry said, trying to say Dobby's name but it came out crooked.
"Guh!" Voldemort said as he felt the spell come back to him. But unlike Harry or Draco he didn't faint. "So Harry Potter you're awake" He smiled evily
"You mean you and Lily did that?" Lupin asked
Pushed down to the floor, Harry landed on the broken plates, but Harry couldn't focus on that. Even as blood spilled from his hands and back only small thoughts ran through his mind.
"I see one of them have a woken" Dumbledore said smiling happily seing Draco there.
From your dear Godfather,
"Harry?" Sirius asked looking at his godson
"Proffesor Snape?" Harry called out to him, a little nervous but still confident.
"So I was right!" The woman before then was grinning evily
Draco noticed Harry had not heard him enter. He smirked at this. Was he really comfortable being here or was he so distracted in his writing. So he decided to call.
^~*~*~*^
"You're right Dobby!" Harry said as he and Draco realised this. Harry smiled, "I just realised this" He laughed softly
"No!" Harry sat up waking up right away
"I could say the same for you" Lucius smiled
"Alright" Dumbledore said and lifted up his arm
"Well now that that's out of the way. I decided I want to take care of Harry" Sirius happily smiled.
"Yes but before that . . " Draco looked away from Harry and grabbed the potion. "I won't leave until you drink the drop"
"Bloody Hell" He laughed annoyed. It was the afternoon of the last day he was ment to be here. It was getting colder. He realised that each day the room got colder. Either the one holding it warm is loosing power. Or the person is lowing their guard.
Harry walked this time to the small kitchen, he then looked in the fridge. There was a treacle tart and some yogurt. He turned to look where the cabinets were and on the counter was a plate full of food, it was some strawberries, some waffles, and a bit of bacon on top.
"Snape please explain" Dumbledore looked at Snape smiling.
"Didnt I say something soft not a treacle tart" Draco mention getting annoyed
"Hmm then I'll shove down your throat" Draco argued
"Okay go ahead tell me" He smiled sheepishly as he saw Snape there too.
When Harry made a step forward to one side Vernon was ready. He blocked Harry, smirking. His large body blocked the whole entrance, he had only been trying to fool him
Draco's face changed into a very surprised face "What?"
"Now that I transported them out of this room lets talk about the Luvano Curse" Dumbledore said and then turned to everyone after snapping his fingers "There has only been 2 people that have been hit by the Luvano Curse before Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy"
Still in the restroom Harry kept looked at himself in the mirror. He kept thinking of the kiss and the way Draco had held him, it was rough and gentle at the same time. It felt warm, but cold. It felt sad, but lustful. He kept thinking not leaving the bathroom. He was suddenly pulled out of his distraction when he heard the door open and close.
"Ah my friend. Sirius" they said friendly as they hugged patting each others back.
Draco holding the towel with his right hand. Brought his left hand fingers to Harry's forehead. He removed the hairs and
When he was done getting ready his body instinctively stopped before grabbing the doorknob. He bit his lip holding in a cry as he remembered what
"Mmm" Harry stired opening his groggy eyes as he felt something heavy on his forehead
"Yes but this time try to drink only a drop of it" Draco advised, he looked outside and sighed. He turned to Harry, seeing him also see the moon.
"But Harry" Lupin said.
"Yes, how could someone do this?." The older man thought aloud as they neared their destination seemed to be only a couple feet away now. "It's time to get you out of here, Harry." The younger man said trying to be cheerful.
"So this Is how i won't be seen huh?" Harry said getting excited
"Dobby!" Harry said excitedly
The door to the hospital wing suddenly opened.
"Soon" Black answered
"Explain then" Draco said a bit impatient.
"Goyle's handwriting is as bad as his" Draco murmured
Harry without another second thought backed away from his uncle and let his fight or flight instincts take over. He was malnourished, but his reflexes were able to get him up to his room.
"Let Dobby sleep, You can leave the dishes here he'll take them when he wakes up" Harry said smiling as he Draco the dirty dishes.
"Well then it's best to explain" Madame Promfey said happily.
"Yes I remember there was a few months where you guys were inseparable and the days before that was very hectic." Lupin said scratching his chin
Draco looked at him surprised again, but like before regained his composure rapidly.
He stared at Harry looking at him sleep peacefully. He reached to remove a strand of hair that was blocking Harry's eyelashes, moving it to the side. Draco then traced his finger to Harry's lightning scar rubbing it slwoly. Harry's skin was soft and warm.  Draco's finger then slid down to Harry's cheeck. Opening up his palm and holding Harry's cheek in his hand he felt comfort. Then looking and putting his finger on Harry's plump red lips. Draco not realising that he was getting closer stopped.
When Harry knew that the food was almost ready he began to set the table, almost forgetting that anything can go wrong.
Vernon strode slowly up the stairs to the freak, and cracked the whip a few times to scare the boy, which he had gotten out of his pocket. Harry tried to back away further into his room going in successfully but not being ae to close the door fast enough. His back was then press up against the wall. He looked to the left but his uncle sensing what Harry was going to try to do, blocked the door leading out of the room.
"Um no I sent him a letter yesterday. I should get an answer today" His voice trailed off looking at the window. "Ah here's the owl now. . . . see Moony, I told you, and he sent me a reply quick this time around." Sirius said, as he opened the window to let the messenger owl into the house and took the message from him.
So as Harry was having his wand fight with Voldemort. The blonde boy once unconscious opened his eyes as he heard screams.
"Well Potter is probably having different reaction since he's male and a submissive, which means his body is creating a womb"
Draco caught Harry's eye and he saw him blush as he sat on the bed. Harry saw Draco wink at him which is why he had blushed. His stomach ache had stopped hurting as everyone stared at him.
Dear Draco,
"Yes and No. You'll be able to be with anyone you want, but As a submissive Potter needs your permission" Snape said to him and then turned to everyone "Harry won't remember what happened during his first heat just like the one's that had gone after his scent. He'll know it happened with his instincts. Also your 5 senses will increase, and I think thats all"
Old memories of tin men, spiders, and dust bunny friends crashing back to the forefront of his mind after years of pushing it back. The sounds of his cousins lumbering footsteps mixed with his aunt’s shrill screams. The sudden moment making Harry feel young, vulnerable. Nothing more than a scared kid in a cark hole in the wall unable to stop anything bad from happening to him.
“Your birds making a muck in the Great Hall.” Harry stepped up to him, crossing his arms, “Why aren’t you there?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy gave a cruel laugh like he heard Harry’s small admission. “Just admit it Potter” He took a step closer, getting into Harry’s personal space. The proximity made the depth of his tired eyes clearer, they looked bruised and bloodshot like he had been crying for hours, “You’re just mad because nobody needs you anymore.” His voice was cold and unnervingly even like he was stating simple facts. “You are upset because, after everything you did and everything you gave, no one gives a shit. You did your job, like a tool and now that you’re done, they are going to throw you in a cupboard like an old broom.” Harry’s heart gave a lurch at that.
“They already tried that.” Harry pointed out, remembering some of the more colorful illusions that Rita Skeeter was prone to use.  She deserved to lose her journalistic license if the wizarding world even had those. Unfortunately for Harry, she made the paper to much money off his name, she was more likely to get a promotion rather than a dismissal. Ron and Hermione kept up their conversation as Harry’s mind drifted away.
A mermaid, dead, limp against the rocks stared back at them. Murky eyes were placid, staring up at the sky in a way that meant the creature wasn’t seeing anything. The ripples off the lake lapped at the limp body, tail floating to and fro as if the mermaid was alive.  It wasn’t moving other than being pushed by the light tide waves.
Luckily, this plant wasn’t a hard one to harvest. It needed no tricks like the mandrakes or spells like Devil’s snare. It wasn’t dangerous, but a valuable stabilizer in certain potions, which was why Professor Davies had requested Sprout help him collect more. They worked quickly but carefully, gentle to make sure they collected the ones for class and even a few more with every possible root still attached. Neville states he wanted to re-pot a couple of them for his own personal collection. They stored them away in waterproof bags for the unavoidable swim back.
“What the hell is with Malfoy?” Harry had to instantly ask; something didn’t sit right with him about the situation. Malfoy was one of the best potion students in their year, Even Snape’s favoritism didn’t undermine that fact. Hermione simply rolled her eyes at him whispering a put out ‘oh Harry’.
His eye twitches, before suddenly something catches his attention. He pockets his wand turning on his heels, heading back the way they came. The clicking of his fine polished heels making it easy for Harry to gauge how far away he was. Waiting a few minutes after that just to be safe, Harry slowly peaks out from his hiding space. He kicks something on the floor, which rolls and bounces off a melted globe on the floor. It’s bright white unlike the rest of the room.
Fishing in his pocket, Harry pulled out the small delicate charm. With a rough thumb, Harry rubbed it over the crystal pendant, watching as the flower shifted inside. Slowly, he held it out, towards Malfoy “Here, this is yours.”
Waiting for just a moment Harry stuck his head out to look down the hallway. Malfoy was making a quick pace; he was heading somewhere with conviction and confidence. Harry left the alcove and started to follow.
Luna, stood on the edge of the bank, staring off across the lake at the opposite shore, “There might be some on the eastern bank, it's usually shaded by the forest.” She pointed to the area in question, a little jettison of trees the cut into the lake, creating a cove on the opposite side leading straight into the heart of the forest. Its shoreline was just visible through the mid-morning mist coming off the lake.
“Password?” She asked, lips reddened from her wine goblet.
Spiraling around the tallest goal pole, Harry feels his stomach curdle as the dizziness settles in.  At the top of the goal, the snitch suddenly turned to head towards the Ravenclaw bleachers behind Harry’s back. Without slowing his pace, Harry flips himself, flying upside down for several feats before barrel-rolling till, he was upright again.
“I… I don’t really remember.” Malfoy sounded genuinely confused like it was inconceivable that a potion dares to spoil in his presence.
Hello Lovelies,
“And this elusive Professor Davies.” Hermione confirmed, picking up her pace ready to ‘solve the mystery’ of the new teacher. “Harry, you are quiet this morning.”
That’s when Harry realized what exactly he had seen on the quidditch pitch, Malfoy’s imperfections. His hair was wind-whipped and ruffled from repeatedly running his fingers through it, freeing it from the hair potions that usually kept it trapped. With the loose bangs hanging around his cheeks, Malfoys face lost its cold sharpness. He still had the structure that made him a handsome man but now it was tempered by the fact that he was human and imperfect. He seemed almost more real.
Turning the corner, Harry sees six large radiating corridors… and Malfoy was gone. The hallway was empty, no sign of movement in sight, even the dust was moving in its casual wafting way as if it was never disturbed at all. Statues, suits of armors, and massive birdcages were at the end of each hallway obscuring anything pas them. Yet in all that dark hallway, of stones and ironwork there wasn’t the irritatingly bright shock of white hair to be seen. Gravely, Harry couldn’t hold back the growing he gave in frustration. Scanning for any signs of life, the frustration grows as there was nothing there to find.
He hears the sound of splashing behind him as Neville ran to Harry’s aid. As he came up behind Harry, he let out a shocked gasp “Is it…?”
those were The Prophets a few favorite adjectives for Harry, every colorful combination being slapped together in an endless stream of headlines. What the countless articles failed to ever mention though or even worse just write off was that those qualities were what kept him alive.
“Yup,” Harry confirmed with a smirk. The pair walked in silence all the way to the pitch. Opening the supply closet, he dug out the massive ball box. Flipping the lib open he pulled open the miniature gold French doors that hid the compartment with a Snitch inside. Gripping the small gold ball tightly, to avoid it from slipping free and flying away. Shoving the rest of the box back Harry came out of the closet, Malfoy watching all of this with a complete look of loathing on his face, “Alright, one round. Whoever catches the snitch wind. Sound easy enough?”
The door was already visible, the room was already open. There was no need to walk by three times because someone was already inside it.
Mermaids primped in a clear lagoon, Fae planted flower beds in spring showers, Phoenixes flew in the sun, Thunderbirds danced along with lightening and any number of creature Harry couldn’t name eat, danced, sang and celebrated their little glass life. They were lifelike, similar to the portraits, but they were silent and didn’t gossip or call attention to Harry as the chattier pictures could. They gave him the space to think and watch. He just stood there breathing in and out, his eyes even starting to droop in the moment of comfort
The next morning, Harry is tired but unable to settle the discomfort of last night. What could Malfoy possibly up too?  Is it his imagination or maybe his Paranoia. This year was supposed to be a do-over and here Harry is falling into old habits.
“Well, that was interesting.” Hermione started as they exited out of the classroom into the dank dungeon halls.
Every time he woke up feeling hot, but not in a cold sweat like his nightmares normally brought on. This was far more comfortable in its warmth and would almost feel good. Harry would lazily come into wakefulness, basking in the comfort of honeyed dreams.
“Awww,” His fake sympathy looked distorted and cruel as his eyes flashed angrily, “upset that now that the world is saved no one needs the Great. Harry. Potter. Anymore!” He neatly spits each last word, and then it was there, a sudden crashing wave of emotions Harry hadn’t felt in so long.
“I don’t think I have ever seen a dead mermaid before.” Neville marveled, kneeling down to get a closer look close for a better look. The pale pallor of mermaids, normal iridescent like mirky water in the moonlight, was lusterless grey and sallow. Wide eyelid fewer pupils were dilated, nearly complete black, staring up with empty nothingness.
Looking down the table he could see the morning feast that he remembered being so in awe of in the first year. Unfortunately, the awe was gone and with it his appetite it seemed. Instead, he just shifted his gaze between the chatting students at the four long tables of the hall.
“What do you want for it.”
Making a beeline for his storage chest, he dug out his map stashed between the pages of an old textbook. Slowly the crawling ink lines that scrawled across the page began to form the blueprints of Hogwarts, every room, passageway, and secret on full display for Harry to survey. On the fifth floor, he could see the small footprint path of Filch continuing his stalking, Mrs. Norris at his ankles keeping him company. A few stray prefects were finishing their rounds near their own dorms though there didn’t seem to by any students out to be caught, more importantly, Malfoy was still hidden on the seventh floor in the Room of Requirements.
Fed up with waiting, Malfoy opened the Room of Requirements door, slipping inside. Harry silently follows him, just watching as with each step the tension in Malfoy’s back seems to evaporate. As they came up to the mirror, Harry noticed for the first time the multiple blankets and musty pillows laid out in front of it. Malfoy tossed his bag aside and settled down in the center of the nest, just inches from the mirror’s glass.
New teachers and old rivalries. Somethings never change at Hogwarts... right?
“You most certainly bet I did Miss… uhh… Miss…” He snapped his fingers and gave a come-hither gesture in demand of the student’s name.
Without looking back, he turns and raced towards the door, behind him sparking curses flew by. “Confringo! Confringo!” Whoever was here was dead set on either scaring off Harry or setting him on fire. Taking every corner possible, Harry hopped to evade the flying curses and being seen by his pursuer. Idiot, he should have brought his cloak. Weaving almost blindly, everything looked like the same black, burned mush. Harry is desperate to gain ground. Up ahead he sees a small pile of burned destruction just tall enough to be an obstacle, but jumpable. Going at full speed, Harry easily vaults over the mass, landing with a clattering thud. A chain reaction starts as disturbed objects all fall from their precarious positions. Tossing up dust and ash as they fall against one another to the floor. With the noise and obstruction on his side, Harry quickly seeks out a place to hide. There in the far corner is what looks like a series of bookcase all falling into one another like long-forgotten gravestones. There is just enough space for a man to slip through.
They were both some of the several new hires needed for the year, with the death toll what it was last year several positions at the school needed to be filled. They still didn’t have any idea who their new Potions professor was outside of the vaguely bland name, Edward Edwin Davies, printed on their class lists. Even Hermione wasn’t able to dig up any information on the man much to her frustration.
Welcome to a new story adventure. I hope you have enjoyed the first chapter of my next big writing project. If you liked what you read I hope would stick around and please leave comments, I always like to hear what you all think about the story and any constructive criticism you could have.
It was one thinking to be practically haunted by the man during the day. Worse now, he couldn’t escape the man even when he did manage a few hours asleep. Now his dreams were all but invaded by the presence of Malfoy. Closing his eyes, he would be right back in the room, in front of the mirror, sitting in comfort next to Malfoy. He would just see his smiling face, the reserved imperfection, and probably the closest thing Harry had ever seen to unguarded joy.
“Malfoy.”
Flashes of the sixth year bombarded Harry’s memory, Malfoy looked almost, if not worse, than he did leading up to Dumbledore’s murder. His hands didn’t shake though as he pointed it back and forth as they did back then.
“He was using the Mirror of Erised. Actually, talking to it.” Ron and Hermione shared a look that to Harry seemed like they had a silent conversation in almost an instant. Ron leaned forward, dropping his voice a bit lower to avoid the eavesdropping ears that inevitably followed Harry.
“Fair enough, see you around.” Harry turned on his heels and headed back towards the door.
McGonagall, now sitting in the central Headmaster seat, was having a serious conversation with Renee Auguste, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. She is an elderly witch that was clutched fabulously to her youth, with short coiffed hair, and her square face is half covered by the enormous broad framed spectacles. Each day they were a different color, and always paired with a waterfall of beaded necklaces, earrings, and bracelets that jangled like bells as she moved.
“I’ll put an end to this.” Grabbing his bag, Harry quickly raced out of the library. Hermione tried to follow but couldn’t get her hands around all her books before Harry had disappeared through the double doors. If he was fast enough, he could cut Malfoy off before he gets to the Room of Requirements. He blew past confused students, a trail of whispers and gossip quick on his tail as he nearly ran down the halls.
“Alright, mate?” Ron asked from beside him, catching his sour expression. Harry nodded once, and let his features relax. He could pretend he didn’t hate Malfoy. He could pretend his room wasn’t warded to keep his scent contained if he failed to take his potions. He could pretend that he was just a normal student attending school. He wasn’t a war hero. He wasn’t awakened to his own screaming nightmares almost every night. He wasn’t an Omega.
“Well, at least you’re getting better at controlling your pheromones in public.” Malfoy drawled, eyes dark as his eyes swept around the room and finally landed on Harry. Harry wasn’t quite sure what that was supposed to mean, and decided not to bother asking. He could feel Malfoy’s pheromones against his skin, surrounding him like a blanket, and it did not make him want to talk. He grabbed the front of Malfoy’s robes and pulled their bodies flush together. His neck craned up and he pressed a sloppy kiss to Malfoy’s lips that the blond returned instantly. Hands circled his waist, and Harry felt his feet stumbling as he was guided blindly across the floor. Clothes were discarded as they went, falling to the floor, tossed to the couch, strewn along the foot of the bed. There was no shame, no self-consciousness. He knew Malfoy wanted him, knew he
Ron’s eyes went wide, and he leaned back, taking a sharp breath of surprise.
“You know why he’s absent don’t you? If you go near him right now, Harry…” Ron shook his head, his lack of words explaining the horror far better than he could have. Harry’s head filled with Malfoy’s words.
Harry tiptoed up to him, a smirk growing on his face as he approached. When he was close enough, he grabbed the blond, using one hand to cover his mouth, and the other to grab his arm, preventing him from grabbing his wand.
Harry shivered at the cold in the corridor.
“Please…” He breathed, not sure if he was asking Malfoy to hurry and go, or to stay and fix him. He knew he could fix it, too. He knew Malfoy could touch him and take the burn away, replace it with bliss, and end his horrible torture. Malfoy froze, his eyes locked on Harry, and Harry almost sighed with relief when Malfoy came towards him.
“You have NO control over your own pheromones, do you?” Ron chuckled, and Hermione glanced up, curious. Ron explained as if on cue. “Harry just reacted, nothing terrible. Younger Omegas do it all the time, if an Alpha tries to bully them with pheromones. It’s sort of an involuntary reaction.”
“You… what? But… You’re not queer, Harry. Just tell me what really happened?” Ginny denied. Harry sighed, and sank back into the chair he sat on, feeling as if the conversation were tedious, even though he knew it was necessary.
.” Ron said when he sat down beside Hermione. “I thought it was never going to end.”
By dinnertime, he was less sure. He was getting a bit of a glare from Zacharias, and Ron was sitting on the other side of Hermione, looking a bit strained. Ginny was at the other end of the table, sitting with Michael Corner, and even from where he sat, Harry could make out the traces of their Alpha pheromones mixing together from more than their proximity. Ron’s scent on Hermione was stronger, and Harry, despite not caring to know the information, was positive that when he’d been distracted with watching quidditch practice between classes that afternoon, they’d snuck off together, and most definitely had NOT been working on the Transfiguration homework they’d claimed to be doing.
"No more than usual." She said with a lifted brow. Her eyes flicked to Ron, and he shifted uncomfortably.
He hesitated for only a brief, breathless moment, staring down into an eager silver stare, and dismissed the stab of guilt he felt. THIS was what he wanted. He could sort the rest out after he’d fixed this. He absolutely could not let this slip through his fingers again.
"'And' nothing, Hermione. What are you on about?" He was afraid he already knew the answer though. Hermione sighed a long-suffering sigh.
*	*	*
“But I-” Harry clamped his lips shut, and looked away, cheeks going scarlet.
“Missing a fourth partner are we?” His high, squeaking voice called, while they had all been glancing around. Dean, Seamus, Neville, and Hannah Abbot had already formed one group, leaving no one any of them wanted to invite.
“What do they win?” Harry asked, and Ron laughed again.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was expected to apologize, but he didn’t have time to decide on the correct words before Smith stepped closer. He looked almost nervous. Harry found their gazes locked together.
“Malfoy!” He tried to keep his voice light, knowing that someone would hear, someone would be watching. There was always someone in a crowd, with their eyes on him. Malfoy kept walking, and Harry nearly let his smile slip as his face instinctively wanted to snarl. He had to keep himself in firm check as he took Malfoy’s elbow. “Malfoy. A word?” He made it clear it was not an invitation, but a demand. Malfoy shrugged, and let Harry lead him through the crowd. When Harry was forced to let go, he was surprised that Malfoy kept following, his face just as carefully disinterested as ever, though he did smile at a few people they passed.
“You’re a dad?” Harry asked, sure that it was the wrong thing to take away from his statement, but unable to refrain.
“Hello, Luna.” Harry greeted her politely, finding his smile came easier. He did like Luna, even if she was a bit odd. She was wearing turnip earrings and a sparkly headband that held her hair out of her face while she read. Harry inhaled her scent, and thought it reminded him of vanilla cakes. Sweet, soft, warm.
“One of the reasons I never liked git. Around third year, when he started producing pheromones, he would smell SO awful. And he’d fill up a whole room in seconds with his stupid scent. Put everyone on edge until he learned to control it. Then he, of course, did it on purpose.”
. Just… Well, since you're a dominant Omega, it's a bit overpowering. Especially since you were in he-" Ron suddenly clamped his lips shut, looking away. Harry was glad he hadn't said it aloud. Even Hermione's cheeks were tinged pink.
"It was… too much. I'd thought the pain would fade, like grief, you know? But… seeing him, being in that house… seeing Scorpius… it was… too much." He felt clumsy trying to explain, but Hermione just nodded.
Harry made a stop by the infirmary to let Madam Pomfrey know that there was nothing to worry about, but she took one look at him, and was forcing a potion into his hands.
“Potter,
His feet on the cold tiles was a small comfort, and he followed the short path to his door. The hallway was sure to be cooler, he thought. He crept out into the corridor and took a deep breath. He choked. The air was thick, engulfing him in the most delicious scent he’d ever smelled. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy was in the hall before him, or if he’d appeared from nowhere, but Harry’s eyes found him in an instant. His eyes were dark, mostly pupil, and got darker as Harry watched. The scent grew stronger, and Harry found it hard to breathe. His skin felt raw, his sex ached for release, and when Malfoy took a single step back, as if he was going to leave, Harry found his lips parting.
“Like cuddling.” Harry supplied.
Malfoy’s brows pulled together, and he glared up at Harry, hands flat on the floor on either side of his hips, and Harry could still smell his irritation.
“I… erm… I’m sure they told me all sorts of things, but… I didn’t really… hear most of it.” He admitted to his friends. He’d been too busy being horrified at the time that he was an abomination.
Seeing the pale body stretched out beneath him was like a shot of adrenaline into Harry’s veins. Malfoy was his, to do with as he pleased, his dark storm colored eyes watching as Harry sat up and looked down, as if looking over a tray of snacks he couldn’t choose from. Hands rested on Harry’s hips, squeezing, encouraging him to move, and Harry did. The position made his cock feel different, deeper than before, larger. Harry whimpered and tilted his hips back and forth, loving how it felt. It felt as overpowering as Malfoy’s pheromones, intoxicating. Harry licked his lips, looking eagerly down at bare skin, pink lips. He did his best to keep pleasuring them both, but
Harry let the comforting way Hermione talks about her books soothe his nerves, and smiled down at his breakfast. The next month, he thought, was going to be FAR better. Afterall, he has a whole month to plan for his next heat.
you will become uncontrollable. With your heats as unpredictable as they are, the pheromones of my rut would likely set you off, and if you went into heat while I was in a rut, and we had sex, there isn’t a contraceptive potion in exsistence that could boast even twenty percent efficacy against such strong fertility magic.
“Exactly. Whoever’s are stronger wins.” Ron agreed.
doesn’t worry me at all. He’s so wrapped around Granger’s finger it’s a miracle she hasn’t made him propose yet. Smith, on the other hand…” Malfoy’s face went dark, and he looked murderous. Harry felt the dark tinge of his possessive pheromones seeping into the room. “He should know better than to go around propositioning scent-marked Omegas.”
“Deadly?” Harry guessed grimly. Draco chuckled once, and shook his head.
"Are you really going to make me ask, Harry? Fine. Did you cheat on Ginny?" Hermione said it with an unwavering voice, her eyes searching his face, and Harry felt a chill go up his spine as he tried not to squirm. There was no way she could know.
“Those potions… they’re… temporary relief. Intended to give you time and space to set your affairs straight before the heat, not… NOT intended to entirely suppress it! And pheromone suppressants are for emergency use only! In the case of an Alpha trying to overpower you, for instance. Suppressant potions are not meant to be used DAILY!” She was nearly shouting by the end, and Harry grimaced leaning back.
“As it would be unfair to reduce the opportunities of our younger students, all Eighth Year students will not be formally included in the houses. This means you will not contribute to the House Cup, you will not be allowed to compete in the house Quidditch, Academic, or Accessory teams, except in a supervisory capacity. You will be allowed to sit wherever you choose at meals, visit the Common Rooms and Dormitories if you are staying there, or are invited, and you may invite visitors to the castle and your private rooms on the weekends,
“Where do you keep hearing all this from?” He muttered, more to himself than anything. Malfoy had heard him, though, and gave him a small smirk, before he turned to answer Harry’s wife.
Of COURSE it was bloody Malfoy!
“Stop…” Harry moaned, forehead falling to rest on the door between his hands. He felt Malfoy’s lips stretch into a smile against his skin. He hadn’t even noticed that he’d let go of the sheet and it had fallen to the floor, but he could feel Malfoy’s hard cock pressing between his thighs.
The warm body against his froze, and Smith stumbled back a step, appearing to choke on the air. Harry could taste it on his tongue before he even opened his eyes. Malfoy was standing there, glaring at Smith. The hall was stifling with so many pheromones. Spice, mint, and the spice was getting stronger. Harry felt his breath coming in fast pants, and he tasted Malfoy’s fury, and watched as Smith’s pupils contracted to tiny points, and he sucked in a shuddering breath, stumbling to catch himself against the wall as his whole body trembled. He and Malfoy had their eyes deadlocked, and Malfoy, it appeared, was winning whatever silent battle they fought. Harry found his own eyes pinned to Draco as the scent of him grew to a tangible saturation in the air. The mint was barely an undercurrent in the face of Malfoy’s wrath. He could taste Smith’s sudden surge of panic, the last rush of pheromones, and then, his scent was undetectable under the asphyxiating crush of Malfoy.
"Tea?" Hermione asked politely, sitting at the table, keeping her voice low as she rocked the sleeping baby.
“No. Don’t ask for help while smothering me with your pheromones and looking all vulnerable.” Malfoy answered, eyes cracking open to peer at Harry. “It’s hardly fair.”
“But you left last time.” Harry said, his voice more accusing than he’d intended. He wondered if, since Malfoy seemed to know everything else about him, if he knew it had left Harry feeling empty and cold.
“Yes, Headmistress.” The students rang out in unison. Her lips thinned in what might have been an approving smile. Harry was amazed. He’d get his own room. A small piece of the castle that was just for him. It felt like Christmas had come early. His eyes darted around the group, taking in the others’ reactions. They all seemed excited, grins plastered across nearly every face, except…
.” Hermione hissed, giving each of them a reproachful glare that had them turning their heads back to place, each with an amused smirk at her return to Prefect-like behavior.
." Hermione gave him a sympathetic look, and Ron, a commiserating one. "You're lucky, then, that it's not worse."
Harry sat quietly as they were sorted, cheering at the appropriate intervals, clapping for students sorted into other houses, and resisting the urge to boo the first time Slytherin was mentioned. He knew that Slytherins weren’t all bad, but it still chafed him a bit. He let his eyes wander across the hall to Slytherin table and found the head of bright platinum blond hair that was ducked, not watching the sorting, but appeared to watch the cutlery on the table. As if he could feel the eyes on him, Malfoy looked up, met Harry’s gaze, and held it. His face was unreadable, blank. Harry stared back, unsure whether to smile or frown. They were supposed to be putting the past behind them, putting aside their differences. Harry had even testified at his and his mother’s trials.
. So perfect. So warm. He was burning up, but the warmth of Malofy’s body was delicious, and just what he needed. Malfoy was manhandling him, teeth scraping against his collarbone as he pushed Harry’s legs out of the way. His fingers were hard and slender, and Harry groaned as one sank into him. Malfoy cursed something in a growling voice, and Harry could tell he was pleased. He
The promise sent a thrill through Harry, and he pulled Smith closer, deepening the kiss. He didn’t like hearing about Malfoy while Smith was kissing him. It did strange things to his insides, made his stomach feel all twisty and his heart pound erratically. He focused on kissing the blond in front of him, and couldn’t quite feel sorry even though he must have been practically suffocating him with Omega pheromones.
when you started developing?” Hermione seemed just as confused as Harry, but on a different subject. Harry felt his cheeks tinge pink as he recalled the lectures he’d had to suffer through.
“Find me irresistible do you?” Harry teased with a grin, feeling that same tingle of enjoyment in his chest at being able to
