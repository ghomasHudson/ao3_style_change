He went to sleep that evening trying to think of conversation topics, how he should act, what he should get to drink, overthinking everything.
Hermione narrowed her eyes like she was about to object, but seemed to rethink that and looked back down at her book.
“Double potions first thing in the morning!” Ron exclaimed, and shoved in a large bite of scrambled eggs. “Thish. Ish.” He swallowed. “Bloody ridiculous! At least Slughorn’s not as bad as... oh.”
He caught Draco’s eye and smiled tauntingly, forgetting he was not supposed to look into those deep pools of silver.
His stomach growling angrily, he headed down to the dungeons, murmuring the password and slipping inside the Slytherin common room.
“Erm, hello Pansy.” Draco said in a voice that was huskier than normal, and that Pansy desperately wished she could unhear.
Ron and Hermione were on one side, and from left to right on the other was Iris, Pansy, Draco, and Harry. As the hall filled and people found seats closer and closer to the six of them, they began to get more nervous.
He was walking with Ron and Hermione to a place in the shade, near enough to the Black Lake that they could feel the refreshing spray of the cool water. They were all so eager to get into the sunshine that they just grabbed a few pieces of fruit to share while watching the rippling water.
She smiled brightly and sat down. He stuck his spoon into the porridge, and put it in his mouth reluctantly, only to find that it was actually quite delicious. He scarfed up the entire bowl.
“Today we will be going over Amortentia again, but this time actually brewing it. I will give everyone partners, and you shall set to work brewing it. Same gendered partners and every house with another! To discourage actually drinking the potion you know... Oh yes! PLEASE do not drink it! Very important, very important yes... I don’t want to have students becoming utterly obsessed willy nilly now do I!” Slughorn chuckled.
Harry was grateful when the bell rang and it was time for dinner, he was starved. He, Ron, and Hermione made their way to the Great Hall.
𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑧𝑎𝑟 𝑤𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑠𝑜 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒 thought Draco, looking up at the chalkboard and trying to force back the slight flush on his own cheeks.
They got closer and closer, arms outstretched, and they crashed into each other, neck and neck as they got ever closer, arms side by side reaching out, neither one was going to get there first—
He found Draco and was surprised to see his gray eyes already staring into his own. Draco’s look of not-unpleasant-really-but-something-Harry-just-could-not-place to a rather forced looking sneer. Harry looked back down at his two bites left of a sandwich, his face burning.
He still could not stop staring as Harry ate, talked, and laughed. Harry threw his head back at something Hermione said, and Draco could hear his joyful laughs from across the Hall. It was quite adorable actually, and he smiled softly.
Harry half-heartedly tried to deny it, “I was suspicious! He did end up bringing Death Eaters in the castle!” But the attempt was feeble.
His hair was as messy as always, and his shirt was very unprofessionally untucked. Some old part of him wanted to make fun of him about it, but this uncovered part of him couldn’t help finding it just... 𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒. And he couldn’t stop his eyes from raking down his body to his legs, which surprised him by being strong and sculpted underneath a pair of tighter than usual jeans.
She frowned, but then got a mischievous smirk on her face. “Well who is it?” She inquired, one eyebrow high and arched.
This was exactly the problem! If he got distracted, he would lose the snitch to Malfoy and he would never hear the end of it! Get distracted by his whole body really... his paper white skin, his pale blond hair—perfectly styled yet somehow still so soft looking, his tall, lean figure, the hardened abs he could see when his shirt was pulled against him by the wind while racing by on a broom, the competitiveness in his eyes, his 𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒...
He ticked them off on his fingers dramatically. “Your actual dad, too weak to even fight long enough to let his family escape, that shame-of-the-family madman Sirius Black, lunatic Dumb-as-a-door himself, then that werewolf Lupin!”
“And miss Parkinson, I bet your mummy would be 𝑠𝑜 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑑 to see you with this... 𝑔𝑖𝑟𝑙.“ Pansy’s expression turned panicked.
Seamus rubbed his eyes and yawned. He mumbled something incoherent and laid his head down on Dean's chest.
Draco swore and flew higher and higher, blushing furiously. Ugh! How could he have let that slip so drastically! Number one he was nice to Harry, number two he was nice to Ron—eww, number three he meant the stupid Gryffindor version, which just, ugh.
"Pansy actually. She's not the absolute worst it turns out." Ron said, going over to his trunk and kneeling down by it.
Draco did NOT want to go to breakfast that morning, and put up quite the fight. But Pansy decided to be his 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟, and was forcing him to go down.
“Oh no! A Slytherin chaser has the quaffle, getting awful close to the goal posts, but a well-aimed bludger from Peakes causes him to drop it!”
Ron chuckled. "At least we know he won't bully you about it now." He said with a wink. "Are you two, like, dating now? Or what?" He asked.
In a hurry to change the subject, Draco asked, “So. Um. What’s your favorite magical creature?” Pansy quirked an eyebrow but answered the question, and they had an easy conversation once again. Draco let out a sigh of relief.
𝑫𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒐 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑰 𝒘𝒐𝒖𝒍𝒅 𝒍𝒐𝒗𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆! 𝑰 𝒄𝒂𝒏’𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒊𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝒔𝒆𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖! 𝑪𝒂𝒏 𝒘𝒆 𝒊𝒏𝒗𝒊𝒕𝒆 𝑯𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒚, 𝑹𝒐𝒏, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑯𝒆𝒓𝒎𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒆 𝒕𝒐𝒐? 𝑫𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒐 𝒊𝒔 𝒑𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒍𝒐𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒅!
Penny looked at her suspiciously, but her attention was diverted by a group of Hufflepuffs waving to her. “Can I go say hi?”
After several attempts to start conversation by Pansy and Hermione, minimal responses from Draco and Harry, and grunts from Ron, they dissolved into silence again.
“Ooh! Tell me all about them!” Penny said, her eyes lighting up as she snatched her bookmark from the coffee table and put it in her book, setting it down on the table to give Iris her full attention.
Draco looked after them until the door swung shut, then he couldn’t stand one more second of his mouth not on Harry’s.
"Maybe the Three Broomsticks? We could break the ice you know, loosen up over a warm cup of Butterbeer!"
He looked at her, the best (female) friend he’d had for so many years. The one he could always rely on. He decided to tell her.
She pulled his hand away from his mouth and her nose scrunched up, giggling louder. "Y-you—kissed—Potter!" She gasped out between bouts of laughter.
Hermione looked up from her book and smiled knowingly. “Yes, I’ve checked. We have every class with Malfoy today don’t we, except Herbology.”
After they had pulled themselves together, they meandered back up towards the castle, brushing shoulders and just talking like old friends.
Hermione nudged Ron’s shoulder and he nodded. They pushed their way to the entrance, Ron using his two inch advantage on everyone to signal to Iris and Pansy.
Harry reached over and grasped Draco’s arm, unbuttoned his cuff and rolled up the sleeve, exposing his forearm, and the Dark Mark on it. Although Draco flinched away, he didn’t yank his arm out of Harry’s grip.
She had just grabbed a small scoop of hash browns, a strip of bacon, a muffin, and a handful of cherries.
Pansy yawned loudly, which caused Draco and Harry to look over, slightly surprised that they weren’t alone. But her yawn caused a chain reaction, and soon Ron was yawning enormously, and everyone shifted to get comfier.
“Getting distracted by his—ℎ𝑖𝑠 ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑟 𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑏𝑦, ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑑 𝑒𝑦𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑, 𝑓𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑑, ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑙𝑦 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑛 𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑, ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑔 𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦, ℎ𝑢𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑏𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘... “ I mean—him.”
They sipped in awkward quietness until the bell above the door rang once again and a group of three people walked in.
Professor Slughorn wasn’t very happy with Harry when he found out why his incredible talent at potions had just vanished, but had took pity on Harry and his hardships and let it slide, and they maintained a good relationship, but Harry was no longer star of the class.
They stopped running when they got to the Hall, Hermione chiding them as they headed to their seats at the Gryffindor table.
He felt so comfortable with his arms wrapped around his ferret, his head resting on the chest of the person he couldn’t imagine himself not being with, listening to his steady heartbeat. It wasn’t long before Harry felt himself drifting off to sleep...
Iris found her book first, and plopped down on the couch next to Pansy, and rested her head on her lap as if it was a pillow. Pansy read the title and raised a taunting eyebrow, and Iris scowled up at her defensively. “What!? This author is actually really good! Romance is quite good literature sometimes!” Pansy smirked down at her as if to say ‘sure,’ and Iris rolled her eyes and opened the book to the first page.
“No please! Don’t tell anyone!” Draco pleaded. The leader, a seventh year Slytherin that looked much too big to be seventeen, just ignored him and shifted his gaze to Pansy and Iris.
Harry blushed deeper and looked back down at the apple, embarrassed by just the thought of if he said that out loud. He took another bite.
“Why don’t you invite them to study with you? The library is probably going to be empty, there aren’t any tests coming up.”
Harry scowled up at the pair, and Draco felt a pang in his stomach, from what he did not know. He was probably just hungry.
Thanks again to @TallGourami15 for beta-ing for me! They are the best and you should go check them out!
“Ay Potter!” He yelled across the Hall, everyone going completely silent. Harry looked away from his ‘conversation’ with Ron, and scowled.
They started heading up to the Great Hall, Draco dreading seeing Harry after yesterday, but also kind of... looking forward to it. Heat rose into his pale cheeks, turning his face tomato red.
Harry sighed, not very hungry anymore, and happened to glance up at the Slytherin table. He should really pick a seat facing away from it in the future.
"I doubt that! They just agreed to come! But either way, we'll have lots of time to convince them over Butterbeer." She stood up and clapped her hands. "Let's pick you out an outfit!"
“Ppfffsshhhhh... not that long... hahaha...” Harry said sheepishly, unable to look either of them in the eye.
Ron saved a goal spectacularly, and Harry cheered for him, almost falling off his broom because he raised both arms in the air and whooped.
Harry was shaken awake that morning. Quite forcefully, Harry might add. "Wha-who-what?" Harry said, surprised to see his favorite bushy haired friend standing over him.
Dean shook Seamus awake gently. "Hey Shay?" He whispered. "Hermione would like to borrow one of your shirts."
Harry seriously doubted that, but rolled his eyes and said, "How in the name of Merlin did you arrange that?"
“Well I just caught you staring at Potter, and I asked if you liked him.” She said matter-of-factly.
On the second sheet, she wrote an invitation to Hermione. She tied both letters to Hermes, feeling slightly bad about the extra weight, but he flew up a few inches without any difficulty. She told him the instructions and watched him fly back out of the window.
Draco rubbed his lips together in a small circle. The movement seemed familiar to Harry, almost as if he had watched this occur a million times—
But she was already riffling through his closet. (Draco had worked very hard to be able to transfigure his trunk to a closet and back, he had to keep his clothes hanging, wrinkles are unacceptable.)
Just then, Ron and Hermione burst in through the portrait hole, giggling profusely. They spotted Harry on the couch and plopped down next to him.
“OH MY GOSH IRIS! What a catch!” Penny interrupted excitedly. “Then what’s the problem? And may I ask who?”
"Oh Draco, I'm sorry." She said, trying to calm her face. "But, like, oh my god! Harry Potter! You!" She burst into another fit of giggles.
They found a group of three loveseats in a circle with a table in the center behind a bunch of shelves in the far corner, where they thought no one would find them.
The common room was full of people playing exploding snap, laughing, and generally making a ruckus so they headed up to the boys’ dormitories.
Malfoy’s glances at Harry. His neat handwriting as he copied the board, his face in a cute focused expression.
His face broke into a relieved smile. “Thanks Pansy. I’m glad I told you. But maybe not two steps behind...”
Harry grinned at him, visibly relaxing, and pulled Ron into a hug. “Thanks Ron. That means a lot.” He said, glad that Ron was still here for him.
Harry sure hoped he could focus on the match, keep his eyes on the snitch, away from the entrancing entity that was Draco Malfoy.
Draco watched as Harry broke the petals in fourths (to release their aroma and properly infuse the potion) and held out his hand for them.
Draco took notes diligently, and read his chapters quickly, eyes flicking about the page, but Harry only took minimal notes and seemed to zone out several times while looking at his textbook.
Draco stepped away and swore. Harry didn’t respond. Shit. He had been so sure Harry liked him back, but now...
Seeing his expression, she said, “Well go get him! I’ll be your wing-woman, two steps behind you, here if you need me.”
Hermione raised an eyebrow and glared at him suspiciously. “You are not getting out of this Harry. You ARE telling us after dinner.” She stated sternly, stabbing a green bean with her fork.
Harry watched as Draco scanned the shelf, his long fingers trailing across the spines and his face adorning a concentrated expression as he read the titles.
"We need your help with something." She said, standing over them. Dean awoke first and gasped when he saw Hermione. "Jeez Mione what is it?"
She walked down to the Great Hall with Penny, eyebrows drawn together in nervousness, and palms slippery with sweat. She had no idea what Draco and Harry had planned, and she was scared it would not go well.
Pansy heard whispers from inside. Eventually the portrait swung open to reveal a common room decked in appalling amounts of red and gold. She cringed almost imperceptibly, much preferring the more sophisticated and elegant green and silver decorations of the Slytherins.
He came out into the common room and was greeted by clapping from Hermione and joking wolf-whistles from Ron.
“The Chosen One and the Malfoy Heir, gay and together? I wonder what the whole school will say about that...” The leader of the group sneered at them.
They stopped at the entrance of the alley, quite disturbed by the startling image: Draco at Harry’s neck, hair uncharacteristically disheveled, Harry with his head back against the wall with an expression that Pansy did not wish to see again.
Draco got lost in the making of the complex potion, a bead of sweat on his forehead as he added meticulous amounts of powder. He stirred in a complicated pattern, and smiled when the potion got shinier.
“Hey! It’s the whole gang! How are you guys?” Seamus said cheerfully, looking at Iris, Pansy, and Draco.
They were sitting in awkward silence until Madam Rosemerta made her way over. “Would you like anything to drink?” She raised a questioning eyebrow at the five of them sitting at the same table, but didn’t say anything about it.
He hit his head on the table, hard. The loud noise sent heads snapping in his direction, looking at him quizzically.
What was he thinking!? He must just be a little jumbled in the head after all the trauma he had endured. But he looked across the lake at Malfoy, he just couldn’t help it, and was surprised to find his silver eyes staring back at his emerald ones.
Harry looked behind him discreetly. (Not discreetly, in fact it was pretty obvious.) There was no one behind him.
Draco chuckled quietly at that, and scooted back over to Harry. “Thanks.” Draco said softly. Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, and he rested his head on Harry’s. They sat like that for a few minutes, fingers intertwined, but got simply too drowsy to stay upright for much longer.
Just then, the bell rang announcing five minutes before first class, and they could hear the muffled sounds of everyone in the Hall scrambling to grab their stuff and get to class.
The Great Hall was chaos, people shouting and chattering, houses mixing in a mass of people; it was hard to hear anything over the ruckus.
“Captains shake hands.” Madam Hooch boomed. “Mount your brooms. On my whistle, three... two... one...” her whistle sounded, loud and clear.
He could hear all of the cheering and yelling from the Gryffindors, the slapping of backs, the high-fives, the whistles and the laughter. Many of the people in other houses cheered too. He wished the Slytherins got that when they won, but alas, the unfair judgment of the Slytherin house had not ended.
“Someone like you, what’s that supposed to mean?” She said, raising an eyebrow. “And besides, even if you ‘don’t faint’, you still need to eat something substantial!”
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, irritated. She threw everything back into the trunk except the jeans. She stared down at them in dismay, before pulling out her wand. She lightened them in patches and by the end, they were looking fashionably faded. She performed tiny abrasive spells and soon the jeans were carefully distressed.
Penny just laughed. “It’s okay I think we all already knew. Kind of a shame though... he’s quite a looker... and I’m really sorry, it must be hard to not be able to see her very much.”
Harry stood up and grabbed Ron’s arm, yanking him off the couch. Ron scowled and shook his arm off, but walked a few steps toward Hermione and intertwined their fingers. “Let’s get on with it then.” He said begrudgingly.
Classes that day went by much too fast for Harry’s liking. Before he knew it, he was in the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione, too nervous to eat more than a few mouthfuls of dinner.
They dashed out of the hall, hand in hand as they turned corridor after corridor. Once they decided they had gone far enough, they slid down against the wall, collapsing from relief and exhaustion.
They found a nice tree and sat under it, relaxing on the cool grass. Hermione brought some books out, as nothing was better than getting lost in a book. (To her anyway.) Ron had brought some sweets that seemed to always occupy the pockets of his robes and a pocket chess set. Harry didn’t bring anything, but was holding the fruit for all of them.
Iris tried to focus back on her book as well, but she was simply too anxious for Pansy’s response to register the plot at all, the words blurring on the page.
Harry grimaced. “It’s alright. We had agreed that it would be most believable, and I know you don’t really mean it, it’s just those wounds are still a little fresh, you know?”
Ginny had picked pretty much the same team as his sixth year, Demelza Robins and Ginny as chasers, Jimmy Peakes and Ritchie Coote as beaters, Ron as keeper, and himself as seeker. But they needed one more chaser since Katie had left. Dean had been a substitute before, and he also came back for eighth year, so he seemed like the obvious choice.
Draco was about to protest, but he was surprised to find that he actually loved it. It was the perfect mix of put together and professional, without seeming like he was trying too hard.
It looked to be a small tube of chapstick, the label bright green. He couldn’t look away as Draco swiped it across his top and bottom lip, rubbing it twice on a very small chapped spot.
Hermione looked at Neville and brought her voice down to a whisper. "We are going out to get to know each other better! We'll have so much fun."
It was a group of three seventh year Ravenclaws that Pansy recognized. Two boys she didn’t know the names of, and one girl that she did.
She pulled them open and found Dean and Seamus snuggling and asleep, but thankfully still fully clothed.
Harry hadn’t noticed him yet, and was still kicking that quill and humming, 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑧𝑎𝑟 ℎ𝑒 𝑤𝑎𝑠 𝑠𝑜 𝐶𝑈𝑇𝐸 Draco thought. And he just couldn’t handle it for one more second.
That evening, Draco skipped dinner, unable to look at Potter after what had happened in potions today.
She and Pansy had agreed to just pretend that their relationship had always been happening, and that was completely natural. They hoped that after whatever Draco and Harry planned to do occurred, everyone wouldn’t notice them, or at least think that it was small news compared to the boys’ shocking relationship.
“It’s falling, falling into the strong arms of Dean Thomas, looking quite good today if I do say so mysel-” Seamus, realizing what he just said, flushed brick red and coughed. McGonagall gave him a stern look, but with a quirked eyebrow and a small smirk.
The three of them walked down to the Great Hall and found seats at the Gryffindor table. Everyone joined them as if they had always been doing so, and Harry shared the plan.
Draco was practically skipping down to the dungeons when Pansy caught up with him. He stopped walking so giddily at once and cleared his throat.
There was a distinct smell of green apples, but underneath that was vanilla, fresh laundry, and... a (cucumber?) bath product of some kind, broomsticks, something slightly musky, and something sweet, maybe treacle.
Iris tied the letter to his foot and said “Slytherin common room, Pansy Parkinson,” while looking him directly in the eyes. He hooted in understanding and flew out of an open window across from them.
They fell into comfortable conversation, tongues becoming looser with every sip of Firewhiskey and gulp of Butterbeer.
Harry did not think the outfit was perfect, he hardly ever dressed formal if not in school robes and was not used to it. But he had to admit that it was not awful.
"You really need to clean out your trunk, Harry. And you have nothing to wear! Except this gray t-shirt and old pair of jeans... now that I think about it Harry, is that all you have ever worn besides school robes?"
They were training for the first match of the season, and unluckily this time it was with Slytherin.
“Yeah.” Draco said, looking down at his knees. Harry reached over and turned his chin to look in his eyes, and smiled softly.
Iris could have sworn actual hurt flashed across Harry’s face, and he jumped away from the table in anger. 𝑊𝑎𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑜𝑘? Iris thought to herself. 𝐼 𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑦 𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠! 𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑠 𝑎 𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑜 ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑠ℎ...
“Yeah. Beautiful.” But really the most beautiful thing was the person next to him, Harry thought, staring into his eyes.
He scribbled down the scents, and scooped up some of the potion into a bottle and labeled it, as directed. He brought up the vial to Slughorn’s desk and by the time he came back Malfoy had vanished the rest of the potion.
“Yes, Pansy?” He inquired, trying to hide the fact that he had just been caught intensely, 𝑙𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑦 gazing at a luscious green apple.
Dean was much too tall for his clothes to fit Harry, and while Harry's legs were longer then Seamus's, their torsos were around the same size.
That’s when he looked across the Hall, towards the Gryffindor table, to see the Golden Trio piling their plates full of breakfast. He couldn’t look away as Harry precariously put more and more food, pancakes, hash browns, a slice of toast, several strips of bacon, and a sunny side up egg.
Then Draco 𝑆𝑀𝐼𝐿𝐸𝐷. His face transformed into something so happy and perfect, his straight and brilliantly white teeth shining, outlined by the soft pink lips that occupied many a dream of Harry’s.
They walked in silence until they got to the outlook over the Shrieking Shack. The twilight was beautiful, light enough to see but with an pleasantly eerie blue film coating everything.
She arrived at the portrait of the Painted Lady. She knocked on the picture and yelled, "Granger! Weasley! We need to talk!" The Painted Lady scowled at Pansy, plugging her ears and stalking into the portrait to her left.
“Well no one has really done it before, but I bet the professors would be fine with it, they’re always raving about house unity and stuff... you know?”
“Who is it! Do I know him? Spill Draco the suspense is killing me!” She said, turning on to her stomach and facing Draco, her legs doing the stereotypical gossip-girl swing, her chin resting on her fists.
Draco pulled Harry close and kissed him. It was soft and slow, sweet and full of emotion. It somehow meant so much more than their other kisses; they somehow conveyed a million words with one beautiful kiss.
Ron mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like. "Couldn't be that good, I mean it was Malfoy..."
He looked around the room, and at Ron and Hermione, who had caught each other’s eye, and were blushing furiously.
Harry choked on his own saliva once again. He coughed. He looked at the ground. He did everything but look Ron in the eyes.
Harry just stood there, gaping. Ron nudged him and whispered, “You’re drooling,” with a smirk on his face.
She was wearing sandal wedges that made her calves look amazing. They made pleasant thunks on the stone as she walked.
He kept backing up until he met another shop, sliding against the bricks until they found an alley and stepped inside, Draco pushing Harry against the wall.
“Me too.” Was all Pansy could get out. She turned to look at Iris, and up into her big beautiful eyes. Iris was normally a few inches shorter than Pansy, but her heels made her a bit taller than Pansy now. It made Pansy feel slightly uncomfortable and small.
He was so nervous, it would be so awkward, there would probably be fighting, he had no idea how he was supposed to talk casually to Draco, of all people, it would be a mess. He was dreading it, but also strangely excited.
“Uhm... yes?” She asked like it was a question. She cringed. “Yes. I am Pansy. And you are Iris, right?”
Hermione, upon seeing his poor excuse for a knot, sniffed and went over to re-tie it. Once she decided it was acceptable, she clapped her hands and smiled brightly. “Shall we?”
He also wanted to feel the warm sun on his pale skin this morning, so he grabbed a green apple, like always, and set out toward the lake with Pansy.
Harry finished the last of his enormous breakfast, and headed down to the pitch with Ron, Ginny, and Dean.
"Alright fine, but Ron hates me! Hermione is better but we aren't exactly friends! I was a jerk to her for years! I should have never called her that foul name. And it made Ron madder than it ever made her, he will never forgive me!"
She slipped into a mock-formal voice and said, "I assume you two are aware of the happenings of this evening between our two friends?"
Potter and Weasley burst in about two minutes after class started, out of breath from running. They got five points taken away from Gryffindor, and found the only two seats left, right next to Draco.
She ignored him and threw another item out of the closet. She emerged from the closet, her eyes victorious and her smile maniacal. She held an emerald green button-up, a simple black woven-leather belt with a silver buckle, and a black tie with silver accents.
Hermione grabbed a small handbag and Harry gave her a few galleons to put in it for his drink. Ron just looked at her and grinned hopefully. She rolled her eyes at him irritatedly, but nodded. He grinned wider.
Their eyes met as tingles spread out from where they had touched. Potter sped out, and Draco could see Weasley shove him playfully and snigger.
“I can’t just ask him out! He obviously doesn’t like me back! And it would make things even worse between us, more of a cause for bullying.” Harry said miserably.
For just a second, regret crossed Draco’s face, and Pansy pinched his arm. “Nice one Draco!” Pansy said, her voice cruel in a way Iris had never heard it. Draco molded his face into a sneer again. “They all died protecting YOU! Why can’t you fight your own battles, huh? Too weak? I wonder why they put you in Gryffindor. Such. A. Chicken.”
She scanned the Ravenclaw table and found Iris sitting next to a blonde who was chattering profusely at her. Pansy caught Iris’s eye and she said something to the blonde, stood up, and walked over.
She was getting closer and 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑟 and she was still staring into my 𝑒𝑦𝑒𝑠 and oh my 𝑔𝑜𝑠ℎ she’s 𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 at me—
This made Ron's mouth drop open, staring stupidly at her, and made Harry made a terribly exaggerated gagging and retching noise, pretending to vomit.
He looked back at Harry, only to find the bright green eyes staring right into his own. They maintained eye contact for a few seconds, but then blushed and hastily looked away.
Draco Malfoy was more hesitant to come back to Hogwarts, but he wanted to see his friends and he needed excellent N.E.W.T.S. for a career worthy of a Malfoy. It was also a way to escape his house, with the terrible memories of being forced into service and the Dark Lord himself sitting in his dining room haunting him.
He and Ginny were really close, but they both had admitted that they loved each other more like siblings. And they were okay with that.
“Pansy, right?” She said. 𝐼𝑟𝑖𝑠 said. Her voice was clear and powerful and sweet all at the same time, and Pansy felt it caress her and the sweet-as-honey smoothness sent shivers down her spine.
They decided to meet back up with their friends at the Three Broomsticks. They opened the door and found it completely deserted.
Hermione laughed. "That's great Harry." Hermione said with a big smile. "Also we never went over the fact that he likes you back!?"
Hermione plucked an old looking book from the shelf with a triumphant look. She practically marched over to Ron and sat down next to him, blowing off the dust and opening the faded cover hungrily.
"Draco!" She gasped, out of breath from running. "Guess who's going to the Three Broomsticks with the Trio tomorrow!?"
He gasped exaggeratedly, and dived in the opposite direction. Malfoy saw and sped after him. He pulled out of it, and smirked when he saw that the snitch has disappeared again.
The prolific banners, crests, and loud colors bombarded her as she found an armchair and sat down, a slightly disgusted look crossing her face as she scanned the room.
Harry ate his food solemnly, hardly noticing the taste. Everyone was so happy! Hermione laughing with Ron, Dean and Seamus doing a bit for two other Gryffindors, Luna smiling at Ginny from the Ravenclaw table, Pansy giggling at something Draco said.
EEEEEE! I can't believe it's over! Thank you to everyone who has been reading, giving kudos, and commenting, it means so much!!!
He and Pansy walked over to the other side of the lake and plopped onto the soft grass. They started chatting about all kinds of things as they stared out onto the peaceful blue water.
It took a second before they realized that they couldn’t just have a full snogging session in the middle of the Three Broomsticks, even if it was deserted.
Hermione flipped it over. “It’s addressed to me from Iris!” She unfolded the letter and read aloud, “I convinced Pansy and Draco to come with me to the library to study! You three should meet us there!”
Draco bent down and sniffed the potion, and was overwhelmed by the AMAZING aroma. It was so good smelling! He tried to decipher the individual scents.
Pansy smirked and said, "Just alright, huh." Then an idea seemed to have sparked in her head. "You know what? I'm going to go talk to them. We are all going to be great friends."
Draco snapped his head up, towards Pansy but away from the apple, and suddenly everything seemed duller. The colors less vibrant, everything dimmed in comparison to that shiny green apple. He shook his head vigorously, trying to clear it.
Draco had scooted a few inches away, an ashamed expression taking over his features, effecting his posture.
Pansy hurried to catch up, meeting him on the stairs. "Oh Draco I'm sorry. I'm happy for you, I really am!" Then she got a mischievous look on her face. "How was it?"
“Wonderful 𝑃𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟.” He said with a sneer. “Aren’t we all just so GLAD that the chosen one is 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑒.“ He said sarcastically, though it pained him to do so.
She draped them almost lovingly across the back of a chair. Then she opened a drawer underneath the hanging space and selected a pair of black skinny jeans.
Draco rolled his eyes at her and stalked off to the entrance, said the password, and dashed inside and towards the stairs to his dormitory.
It was Harry Potter. Draco didn’t want to find another route to the common room, and this was the fastest. He decided just to try to ignore Potter.
When they had come back to Hogwarts, both Harry and Draco had stayed on their house teams, quidditch being an escape from all of the craziness. But Harry couldn’t deal with all of the pressure of choosing new members and everything, so he gave the position of captain to Ginny. She loved it, and he was glad not to have all of that responsibility. And she was a great captain.
Harry stalled in the corridors, dragging his feet, pretending to tie his shoe, using the bathroom. Eventually they got to the common room, but not for Harry’s lack of trying.
“You good Harry?” Ron asked, as Harry was usually practically skipping to get the delicious breakfast that the house elves prepared, but this morning he was acting like he would rather not go at all, which he did not.
She had a book in her lap, but was looking forward unfocused, playing with and cleaning her nails with her others, fiddling and tapping.
It was the trio, but Granger and Weasley seemed to fade into the background as his eyes landed on Harry.
“Oh I don’t know...” Pansy mumbled, looking back at the table of Ravenclaws... Iris probably. Harry followed her gaze and found Iris staring back at Pansy. Iris stood up. She walked over.
He hurried off to Defense Against the Dark Arts, still a necessary course, though Draco couldn’t see why those who had fought in the battle, especially Harry, needed it.
The boys startled and jumped away from each other, both beet red. Harry coughed and straightened his tie, re-buttoning his top button.
However, they decided it was best to keep their friendship a secret; they all hated to imagine the rumors that would circulate, evil Death Eater’s son with the Golden Boy, etc. Because of this, they could only meet up in the evenings or in places they knew to be deserted.
Harry Potter was glad to return to Hogwarts, the place he felt safest and happiest, especially after the whole Voldemort shenanigan.
“Yes. You have forgotten the rose thorns and petals.” He said, his mercury eyes staring into Harry’s.
Ron and Harry looked down at their plates, but were startled out of their daze when Hermione exclaimed, “Oh no! Class starts in two minutes!”
“You need your strength!” Pansy said. “For your 𝑏𝑖𝑔 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑒 against your 𝑏𝑜𝑦-𝑦-𝑓𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑑!“ She poked him in the side playfully, and reached out to pinch his check, when he smacked her hand away, hard.
Her friend Penny was sitting next to her on the couch, and she looked up from her own book at Iris in annoyance. “Stop making that sound! I’m trying to read! It’s the climax of the book!” Then she scanned Iris’s expression, and the irritation faded from her face. “What’s wrong?”
“I couldn’t see.” Draco said. “He blushed when we made eye contact after we smelled it, but I don’t know what that means exactly, maybe there’s someone—“
Hermione looked from him to Ron, and studied Ron’s face. She found it to be friendly and accepting, so she asked, “Can I tell him, Harry?”
She reached over and intertwined their fingers, grabbing her bag in her left hand. Ron grinned at her and grabbed his.
Harry frowned slightly, still rubbing the mark with his thumb, thinking. But then he smiled softly, and looked over at Draco, and when their eyes met, his entire face broke into an accepting grin.
Harry kissed back instantly, clearly just as eager and impatient as Draco. He could taste the Firewhiskey on Draco, tingling on his tongue.
Iris blushed and tugged at her sleeve, whispering, “Let’s just let them be!” But Pansy responded, “Go ahead, I need to tell them off.” Iris rolled her eyes at her, but let go and started back towards the castle.
“I am just to stressed out about our upcoming 𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ, I 𝑐𝑎𝑛’𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑠 on the ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘.“ He said with a huge wink, his face contorting with the effort as he found out that he could not, in fact, wink. Hermione groaned and put her face in her hands. Ron asked, “You good mate?”
Harry glared at him and stomped over, Draco striding over to meet him in the middle. “I can fight my own battles!” Harry spat, making his hands into fists. Draco grabbed his tie and pulled him an inch away from his face, still scowling.
Draco looked down at the apple, glistening in the sunlight. So bright. So green. He took a big bite, his teeth sinking into the sweet flesh. The moment he could taste the perfection of it, he was overwhelmed by the fresh, crisp, tart amazingness. He sighed, overcome by the deliciousness of the apple.
Pansy glanced at the staff table, and caught Professor McGonagall looking at the twelve of them and smiling.
Pansy got this goofy grin on her face and prodded, “Is it a giirrlll!?” She poked him in the side and giggled.
She hopped up the stairs two at a time, almost falling for the trick step but catching herself just in time.
He got slightly defensive at Pansy’s raised eyebrow. “What! I’m eighteen! And Butterbeer is too sweet for me anyway.” Really he just needed to calm his nerves.
He gathered a small bottle of powdered moonstone and pearl dust, a sprig of peppermint, and a handful of Ashwinder eggs, and made his way back to Malfoy.
But Potter could never like him back. They hated each other! Always had! Draco had gone to such lengths just to display his hatred! He climbed a tree, he complained about how terribly perfect he was constantly, he spent hours making pins with Potter's face on them, he made snide remarks in the corridors every chance he got-
Harry ran his finger along the faded black of the skull and the snake, Draco shaking slightly at his touch. His eyebrows were drawn together, afraid of being judged, of being pushed away because of the sins of his past.
They held each other’s eyes for a moment before they flew down to the ground, landing on the soft grass.
He laughed. He sighed. He looked up into those eyes, those kind eyes, those eyes filled with actual interest and excitement, the eyes of a girl who had stayed friends with him through everything. He broke down.
“Oh, he just— I mean... THEY just looked good today.” Harry said with a tremendous blush. He was NOT just about to say DRACO looked really good eating one today. Absolutely not. No way no how.
They both looked embarrassed and ashamed, but quickly snapped out of it. This happened often. Oh well.
Iris was quite antsy, her relationship with Pansy didn’t need to be as secret as Draco and Harry’s, but Pansy didn’t want word spreading because her family was quite old fashioned and homophobic. Even if they could be accepting for once, Iris was half-blood, and Pansy was certain that her parents would never get over that. She was anxious to see her.
Over the next few weeks, the six of them became quite good friends. Hermione and Iris had bonded quite quickly, sharing book recommendations, studying techniques, and other things that Harry found quite boring.
Harry scooted closer to the blonde and brushed his hand against Draco’s. It was freezing! But that just made him want to warm them with his own. He intertwined their fingers.
“Of course! They can’t just cancel classes because of two students!” Hermione said, rolling her eyes.
It was so full of feeling, and sent pleasant electricity all down Harry’s spine. It was so much more than what he felt when he kissed Ginny, and much more than whatever he had with Cho. It felt so different, so, 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑. So right, like where he was supposed to be.
Harry caught the tiny winged ball and whooped, throwing his hands in the air. He genuinely smiled at Draco, and his shock turned into a scowl, but Harry’s joyful face was just too much and he couldn’t help but smile back.
“Harry. You literally watched him for hours into the night on the map.” Ron said, and Hermione nodded.
His eyes caught on a certain Slytherin as he pulled something out of his bag. Harry squinted to better see what it was.
He glanced around at their surprised faces. "What, you think I could sleep through all of that? Or is it that I might be able to match clothing?"
“Josh? Oh.” She blushed again. She couldn’t stop her eyes from drifting back to the table of Ravenclaws. Hermione followed her eyes and raised an eyebrow at Pansy. Pansy shot her a panicked look so Hermione just took another sip of Butterbeer.
Hermione could tell that the pair wanted to be alone, so she whispered something to Ron that they couldn’t hear, and he nodded and stood up.
Draco let go of his book and let his palm lay open-faced on his thigh. Harry moved his thumb up and down his wrist in small strokes, and without really meaning to, his strokes got higher and higher, brushing the skin just under the cuff of his sleeve, and Draco jerked away as if he had been burned.
Pansy skipped down the corridor, giddy that Draco had found his man. She very well knew that it was after curfew, but she didn't care. She started to whistle a tune of a song that was in her head, but that she couldn't quite place.
Harry grinned, so happy for them. Ginny seemed to enjoy being with Luna much more than she enjoyed being with him, but Harry and Ginny had shared something special nonetheless.
“It’s Potter, Pansy! I can’t stand it, his stupidly perfect glasses, his annoying unruly hair that I just want to run my hands through, everything! And then on top of all that, I smelled him Amortentia today! Ugh Pansy, you know what that means!” He looked down and ran his hands through his hair, groaning.
Five minutes later, the Hall was packed of students eating, laughing, and yelling; the usual. Iris looked over at the Slytherin table, her eyes finding Draco and following his gaze, right over to Harry. Draco gave a small nod.
The bed next to him squeaked. He looked over as he saw a blurry Ron hopping off his bed, which was really weird, considering that Ron was NOT a morning person. Harry felt around for his glasses on the bedside table to his left and grasped them, placing them on his face.
“Happy?” He said, but she was still looking at him disapprovingly, with pursed lips and hands on her hips.
Classes went by far too slow for Harry. He was anxious to see Draco and all of his other friends; that afternoon's lunch was the most fun he had had in ages, and he couldn’t wait to experience that again.
"Draco Malfoy, embarrassed, without a single hint of composure? What happen-OH!" She squeaked, her eyes darting to his slightly swollen lips. She giggled. She couldn't stop giggling, in fact.
"Yes." Pansy said, acknowledging her with a nod. "Now I happen to know the Draco likes Harry very much, so I thought we should all hang out together! Join our friend groups! Make it easier for the couple!"
She threw shirts, ties, robes, belts, dress robes, and many things that Draco couldn't identify because they were flying onto his bed and covered by another item of clothing. It was an apparel hurricane.
Tonight she was wearing a white floral blouse tucked into a denim miniskirt. Her hair was curled loosely, shining slightly in the light. The blouse was feminine and loose, but somehow still clung to every curve. The skirt was torturously short, showing off her long legs.
“And it wasn’t just one sent about him, either. I smelled his chapstick, his hair gel, his robes, his cologne, HIM, what he had for breakfast... it’s ridiculous Hermione!”
Granger got there before Weasley and Potter, he wondered where they were. Wait, why did he care again? This was all just so confusing.
“Yeah she’s quite nice actually, once you get to know her, I think she’s just insecure, and was protecting Draco..."
Things finally started settling down when they got to the table and started piling food in their mouths.
It was sourer than he would have liked, but something about the tartness reminded him of Draco. What. Eww. He chucked the apple into the lake, only for it to be snatched up by a giant slimy tentacle.
He took a few calming breaths but his heart started to race again when he thought about Harry’s hair in the wind... his eyes determinedly fixed on the game... his taunting smile...
“You know, Harry, I haven’t seen Draco bully a single student this year. He’s changed. And before that, I think that all that was just what his dad forced upon him, and what he had grown up being told was okay.” Ron glanced at her, hesitated, but then nodded.
Harry decided that he could get his homework done later, that procrastinating one more day couldn’t hurt. He rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, and started to absentmindedly make little circles with his thumb on the dip of Draco’s hand where the base of his thumb and wrist meet.
Hermione and Ron stood in the opening, suspicious looks on their faces. "What do you want Pansy," Hermione snapped.
"Woah Pansy! You are making a complete mess!" Draco said with a slightly bewildered scowl on his face.
Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry. “Just focus on the game Harry. Just only look at the snitch, and you’ll be fine.” But the barely suppressed giggle and the look that said you-just-can’t-keep-your-eyes-off-him-can-you told him that Hermione was indeed making fun of him.
They got colder and colder as the night went on, and Iris at least had a curfew she needed to be back by.
There it was! A glint of gold! Draco raced toward it, as fast as he could go, hunched close to his broom, the wind messing up his hair horribly.
“Sorry, mate. I dunno what you’re going to do about it though.” Ron said, and went back to shoving food in his mouth.
Harry blushed furiously and looked at his hands, which were practically strangling each other in his lap.
Iris looked suspicious but nodded. “Actually, why don’t we all sit together at the Gryffindor table? That way I’m not the only one at the wrong table.”
Professor Slughorn went around helping the students who didn’t quite get it, and eventually the whole room was tinged with light smoke.
He did his absolute best not to look at the Slytherin table. 𝐷𝑜𝑛’𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝑎𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑚 𝑤ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑑𝑜... 𝐷𝑜𝑛’𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝑎𝑡 𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑜... 𝐾𝑒𝑒𝑝 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑒𝑦𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑛 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒... 𝐷𝑜𝑛’𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘... was running through his mind in a constant loop.
Ron said something and Hermione burst out laughing, joking and playfully shoving Ron, all with a huge smile on her face, but stopped abruptly and looked towards Professor Flitwick when the bell rang.
Ron turned around in his chair to face Harry and said, “Is it the homework? This essay on the effects of knotwood is so frustrating! I feel ya mate.”
Draco was thinking similar thoughts, how this was the first time he had really seen Potter decently groomed since sixth year!
Hermione smiled brightly. "That's perfect Nev! It really is best to match warmer colors with a blue toned shirt."
Harry was surprised to hear Neville's voice from two beds over. "I have a tie that would go nicely with that."
The entire Hall erupted in gasps and shouts. They were still kissing aggressively, clearly wanting to put on a show. Luna started clapping, and Ginny wolf-whistled loudly. They broke apart, gasping. They grinned and leaned their foreheads against the other’s, arms encircling each other’s waists.
Draco and Pansy got up from the table, but Professor Vector walked up and asked Pansy if they could talk about one of her essays.
A giant, jolly laugh erupted from the end of the staff table, dishes shaking as Hagrid slammed his dustbin-sized hand into the table as he wheezed. “Ya owe me three galleons, Horace!” He shouted down the table at Slughorn.
Harry flinched. “Yah, Slughorn isn’t as verbally abusive, but with...” he didn’t want to think about it.
𝐻𝑒 𝑚𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑠𝑚𝑒𝑙𝑙 𝑎 𝑔𝑖𝑟𝑙, 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑦𝑏𝑒. Harry thought. For why else could he be blushing. He blushed deeper and hated himself for it.
He averted his eyes and sprinkled the petals in. “Can you put the peppermint in while I stir? He asked, and started stirring counter-clockwise.
He chatted with them for a few minutes before asking timidly, “Hey, can I bring my girlfriend over?”
Draco and Harry tried to keep up the bickering facade in classes and in the corridors. They invented a little game of creating insults that meant other things, trying to get the other to break character and laugh.
“Since we cannot actually drink the potion, you will just be carefully cataloging the color and the things you smell. In case any of you forgot, it should smell like the things you love most, or what you are most attracted to.”
He grabbed the stick out of the honey pot and dripped a golden swirl of honey on top of the apples, and sprinkled a dash of cinnamon.
Harry could not stop looking at Draco. His cheeks were flushed from the alcohol and Harry found it just adorable.
“I, unlike Potter, do not faint at every slight mishap. Malfoys don’t faint-I mean-I don’t faint. It’s unbecoming of someone like me.”
"Erm..." Harry said, and Hermione narrowed her eyes. "Well, it was..." 𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒, 𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒, 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑜𝑢𝑠, 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡... "good, I guess."
They exited the castle, Harry wiping his sweaty palms on his jeans. They walked with long strides down the hill, and apparated to the Three Broomsticks once they were outside of the Hogwarts boundaries.
Penny sat back down on the couch and took the bookmark out of her book, her right thumb finding her way to her mouth to tap against her two front teeth as her eyes flicked across the page, a habit she had when she was focused.
They finished their dinner, Harry taking as long as humanly possible, Hermione scolding him about procrastinating and eating way too much. Ron just went with it as an excuse to eat more food.
“WHAT! No!” Ron said, incredulous. Then his face turned quizzical. “But now that I think about it... how long have you liked him Harry?”
She gave him a giant, giddy grin and said, “Well go for it! Did you happen to see what he what he smelled in the potion? That way we’ll know how to attract him... or who to eliminate.” She said, a huge mischievous grin consuming her features.
Draco eased out from under Harry gently, and shifted so he was laying horizontally on the loveseat, his head resting on the armrest as a pillow. Harry laid down next to him, snuggling in close and laying his head on Draco’s chest.
“Snap OUT of it!” Yelled Pansy. She took a deep breath, and sat down on the bed. “Draco, please tell me what it is. I’m worried! Can we just talk it out? Please Draco?” She made sad puppy dog eyes and an exaggerated pouted lip.
They floated over and landed on the coffee table. She wrote out a letter to Pansy and sealed it. “Can I use Hermes? I don’t want to go all the way to the owlry.”
Then Hermione dashed down from her dormitory, and said, “Sorry, just doing some last-minute studying for today’s transfiguration exam!”
Then Harry reached for an apple, almost identical to his own, out of a small pile of fruit. He watched as Harry broke off a piece of the apple and HOLY MERLIN.
As he was setting them down, he pricked himself on one of the thorns, deep ruby blood oozing out of the tip of his finger. “Ah!” He exclaimed, wiping the blood on his robes.
The boys smiled at her. Seamus cleared his throat. “So... are you guys, uh, nice now?” Dean gave him a reproving look, but Draco answered.
Dean caught Seamus’ eye and winked, and Seamus went an even deeper red, his ears and neck joining in the flush of blood. The entire stadium erupted in snickers.
“See you guys in a bit then!” She said, barely able to control her excitement. She turned back to Iris and walked out the door with her, Ron wolf-whistling after her.
He didn’t know quite what it was, but as he watched Harry bite into the crisp apple, everything seemed to go in slow motion.
Ron coughed and seemed to be remembering something from earlier. He couldn't contain his (slightly maniacal) grin as he tried to stare at the ground, but seemed to not be able to control his eyes as they went back up to Hermione. Hermione let out a small giggle and licked her top lip, taking her time, slowly and seductively tracing it.
He got off the bed and selected a maroon tie with gold accents from a small pile at the left of his organized trunk.
“Ahh!” Pansy said with a smirk. “You just can’t stand the THOUGHT of competing against your 𝑏𝑜𝑦𝑓𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑑!” She said, singing the last word.
She stopped abruptly at his words and icy glare, coughed, wiped away her tears, and sat back up on the bed.
Hermione mumbled something under her breath that sounded a lot like, "The correct word would be 'well'."
Neville walked over to the Hufflepuff table and tapped a curly-haired girl with pigtails on the shoulder. He said something to her that Pansy couldn’t make out and she whispered something to her friends, who giggled, and stood up. They walked around the table and sat down next to Dean.
Harry was shocked! DRACO FREAKING MALFOY was KISSING HIM! He was stunned, and just stood there, his eyes wide open in shock.
They were all quite relieved when Madam Rosemerta came back with their drinks on a tray. She set the three foaming mugs in front of the Gryffindors, and the two bottles in front of the Slytherins.
“...do you?” Pansy asked, and Draco sensed he should have been listening for a while now. He took a guess.
A cool wind swept over them and Iris shivered. Pansy stepped closer and put her arm around Iris to share heat. Delightful tingles spread from where they touched.
Harry tuned the commentary out with a chuckle. He scanned the field. He saw a glint of gold! But it’s all the way at the other end of the pitch. And about three feet in front of it, was Malfoy.
He also saw Hermione look at him slightly disgusted, and say something he couldn’t hear, but from Ron’s face he could tell that she was not very approving of his heaping plate.
She knelt down by the foot of his bed and opened the trunk. She took out the first layer of stuff, and let out a gasp of delight. She pulled out a royal blue button-up. She placed the rest of the stuff back in the trunk and stood up.
Pansy’s first two classes of the day went by too fast for her liking, and before she knew it, she was walking into the Great Hall for lunch. Draco was technically with her, but for all the words he said he could have just as well not been.
“Oh I don’t know...” Iris said reluctantly. But Penny’s face was full of genuine concern, and while being more popular than Iris, she was known for being excellent at keeping secrets. “Well I’ve been seeing this person...”
He stomped into the changing rooms and started to pull on his quidditch robes. He dressed rather clumsily, his mind elsewhere...
“He is NOT my boyfriend! And I have no problem competing against him! I just have a problem with losing!”
She looked at Iris, brows furrowed, to find the same expression across her face. They started walking towards it, both of them quite curious. 𝑊ℎ𝑜 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑏𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝐻𝑜𝑔𝑠𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑒? 𝑊𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑦 ℎ𝑢𝑟𝑡?
Ron opened the door and pleasantly warm air smelling of Butterbeer wafted over them. They stepped inside and Harry scanned the room, eyes landing on a table in the far left corner.
Draco looked skeptical, but had to agree that Hogwarts students couldn't resist candy and joke supplies.
They found their usual seats, and Harry scolded himself when he found himself once again facing the Slytherin table, but it would be weird to switch now.
"Pansy! I don't think that's such a good idea-" But she couldn't hear him. He groaned and walked back down the stairs, sinking into a poofy dark green couch. He would rather not watch.
𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡! 𝑁𝑜! Harry thought. Crap. He didn’t respond. He had to show him that he liked him back! Without thinking, he ran up to Draco, swiveled him around and pulled him in by the tie.
"WOAH MATE!" Ron said, throwing the nearest object, which happened to be a rather heavy book that landed with a tremendous thud. "DID YOU KISS MALFOY!?"
He pulled on his shirt and jeans rather reluctantly, thinking them both a little too tight. He tied on his tie rather sloppily, his hands shaking.
“We’ll see.” The Slytherin taunted, sneering. He turned around and headed out of the library, his cronies in tow.
He looked across the lake at Potter, who was losing, yet again, another game of Wizards’ Chess. He thought it was strange that he kept playing, even though he kept on losing. But with every game, Ron’s grin got a little bit wider. 𝑇ℎ𝑎𝑡’𝑠 𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡 𝑜𝑓 ℎ𝑖𝑚 he thought and gave a small smile.
"It's not that gross Harry." Hermione sniffed. "But we will stop." But then she winked at Ron as if to say 'for now'. Ron guffawed stupidly and giggled like a little girl.
"Oh gee... I don't know. We didn't... talk about it." Harry said, embarrassed. In truth, Harry wanted more than anything to date the beautiful blonde, but he would never say that aloud.
𝑀𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑖𝑛’𝑠 𝑃𝐴𝑁𝑇𝑆 Draco looked good, his tall stature and trim form accentuated by his outfit, his pale skin standing out against the black and green.
The four of them made their way to an empty classroom, breathing a sigh of relief to be out of the crowd.
“Robins has the quaffle, passes it to Dean, who passes it to Ginny and she’s trying to score, but the Slytherin keeper seems on top of it... OH! That was just a feint! She threw it to the hoop on the far right last minute! 10/0, Gryffindor!
Ron and Hermione stood up. “Hey Harry, is it alright if we meet you in the common room? We want to stop by the library.” Hermione said.
But Harry couldn’t pay attention, his mind repeating over and over 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑠 𝑜𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ... 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ 𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑒, 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑓𝑜𝑦 𝑎𝑛𝑑--𝑛𝑜 𝑛𝑜 𝑛𝑜 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ...
Harry took off his shoes slowly, taking his time with every little thing before reluctantly sitting on his bed. Ron and Hermione raised their eyebrows expectantly.
She raised her eyebrow but didn’t inquire further. They finished lunch, packed up their bags, and headed off towards transfiguration.
They pulled away, gasping for breath. Harry’s knees were weak. Their cheeks flushed, they started to head their separate ways.
Iris wiped her hands on her robes and speed-walked the rest of the way to the Hall. She found a seat facing the isle between the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw isles, sitting down and grabbing two slices of toast.
Draco and Pansy found a table in the corner. It seemed clean enough, and was one of the less rickety ones.
Harry was glad he could no longer smell the intoxicating aroma, and was even more relieved when the bell rang.
Draco walked back towards Harry and started to walk up to Gryffindor house. Harry reached for Draco’s hand and intertwined their fingers.
Draco couldn’t stop looking at Harry, either. Harry just kept smiling and laughing, and he couldn’t help staring at the way his eyes and nose crinkled when he was amused. It was just so 𝑐𝑢𝑡𝑒.
Pansy beamed and stood up to greet them. Draco just sat there, dumbfounded. Pansy smacked him in the arm and he shook his head. He stood up and put on a smile, glad he remembered to brush his teeth.
“Ooh! Yes! Thank you!” She wordlessly summoned parchment, a quill, and an inkwell from a table across the room.
“Ugh. Potty, Granger, and Weasel have taken our spot.” Pansy spat. “Let’s find somewhere else, shall we Draco? Somewhere... FAR away?”
"Well first of all only seventh and eighth years are allowed in Hogsmeade outside of I happen to know that both Honeydukes AND Zonko's are having crazy sales tomorrow! Nobody would come to the Three Broomsticks when they could get such good deals!"
“Yes Harry, I think subconsciously we all kind of already knew.” Hermione said with a knowing smile.
She sniggered and said, “I did see you making eyes at each other the whole match.” She winked. “What exactly did Potter say to make you stop racing for the snitch? It had to have been quite something, cost us the whole match!”
Little sparks of electricity tingled where they had touched, and he flushed. He looked up at Harry to find that he was also blushing.
Ron continued to chuckle as he dipped his quill in his ink and wrote his name sloppily on the paper. Harry found his potions book, slid it out of his bag, and began to read the page on the effects of different obscure ingredients.
“Oh it’s nothing.” He said, trying to keep his voice steady but unable to meet their eyes. He looked down at his plate and shoveled in a bite of mashed potatoes that was much too large so he wouldn’t have to talk anymore.
Before either of them could object, she turned and skipped out of the portrait hole, delighted all the way to the dungeons.
He was quite relieved to see that Draco was not there, and when the quite obvious expression crossed his face.
“Sure!” She jumped up and disappeared down the spiral staircase in the middle of the room. Iris barely had time to read another paragraph of her book before Penny came bounding back up the stairs surprisingly soon, a chipper looking tawny owl perched on her sleeve.
“How do you always know! It’s like you have a bloody internal clock or something!” Ron said with his mouth still half-full.
Hermione conjured a blanket to set the fruit and things on, but then quickly got immersed in her book. Used to this, Ron and Harry got out the chess set, Harry being perfectly content to just watch Ron’s miniature figures smash his to pieces.
He could practically hear the pleasant crunch. Smell the heavenly aroma. See the colors erupt in his head whenever he ate one. Taste the sweet, tart juice. Feel the apple between his teeth as he chewed.
“Yes! I would love that!” She stood up and brushed off her dress. She had just chosen a simple and flowy navy number and flats for the evening, and was now wishing she had chosen something a little more... fun.
Draco, Harry, and even Ron teased her and tried to get her to go over there, glad for the easiness of it.
He got distracted in their depths for just a second, but snapped out of it and managed to get out, “Oh. Sorry. I’ll get those now.”
“Well it’s just my parents. I’m sure a lot of owls will be going home tonight with news, and word will travel. My mom is a hopeless gossip; she will no doubt ask all the other parents if I made any progress with Draco, and when she hears—I don’t know. It’s fine. I’m an adult anyway, I can just move out.”
Hermes swooped in a few minutes later, and Iris hopped off the couch instantly and ran over to him. She untied the letter and read it:
“You two really need to grow up! Eighteen years old, full adults, you would have thought the racing to breakfast would have been long past, but noooo...”
“Ay mate! Why are you eating the green one?” Ron asked, gesturing at the apple in Harry’s hand. “I thought you preferred the red.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, scanning his face almost android-like, and zoned in on his bruised lips. She raised a suspicious eyebrow.
Draco and Harry sat down and adjusted until they were most comfortable, leaning against each other and gazing out at the beautiful colors.
They sat down in uneasy silence. Just then, the bell rang announcing the opening of the door, and Draco’s eyes shot to it instinctively.
He glanced up at Harry, who was smiling too. He looked around the room, but it seemed like they were the only ones with spiraled smoke coming out of their cauldron.
Draco started to grab an apple, as usual, but Pansy said sternly, “You cannot just have an apple for breakfast every morning! You’re going to faint and fall off your broom from lack of protein!”
Harry was dreading going to breakfast, but his stomach was growling, and he needed fuel if he was going to beat Malfoy.
Pansy and Iris were having a great time, once the conversation started it didn’t stop, easily joking and talking about so many subjects.
“Well get back to the castle both of you.” Pansy said, turning away from them, and ran to catch up with Iris.
Draco was getting closer and closer, because Potter was walking so slow and Draco was taller. (And very gay)
Weasley took the farther away one and looked at me with disgust, but then his eyes widened a bit and he smirked at Harry and gestured slightly with his head towards Draco.
They all had so much fun that lunch seemed to fly by; the bell ringing much too soon. They said their goodbyes and rushed off to their classes, surprised and delighted that they all got along so well.
He spotted Ginny land and Luna run up to her and engulf her in a embrace that practically knocked Ginny over. They laughed happily, the joy as they looked into each other’s eyes palpable.
Professor McGonagall stood up and raised her hand, about to stop them, when Draco pulled Harry the rest of the way, and kissed him.
"Hmm." Hermione pondered. "What shall you wear..." She went over to his trunk and started throwing stuff out. It was mostly full of wrinkled robes, extra quills, trash, and other trash.
“Girlfriend? Neville that’s awesome! Go ahead!” Dean said encouragingly. This was followed by cheers from the rest of the group, excited to have another member of their wonderful group.
But Harry couldn’t bear to break away so he stood up while bending over, Draco following. He stumbled backwards toward the door, almost tripping over a chair. He fumbled for the knob, turned it hastily, pushed open the door with his back, and grabbed the frame above him for support, stepping blindly down the two steps.
Harry was rather happy with the events of the evening; their friend groups got along surprisingly well, Pansy talked to the girl she liked, and let’s just say he was not mad about what happened after, either.
“Well they—she—“ She clarified. Penny’s eyebrows raised slightly at this, pleasantly surprised. “...is amazing. She is so hilarious and has such a sassy attitude and takes time to really get to know people, not to mention that she is goddamn 𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑜𝑢𝑠—“
She grabbed her book bag from the ground and said goodbye to Penny, who waved back, but seemed unable to take her eyes off her book.
Holy Merlin. Oh gosh. Oh no. No no no. His cheeks ignited, and he glanced at Draco, who was also flushed.
Draco found his book last, sliding a sleek black book from the shelf. He cracked it open to the middle, his pale finger following the words he was reading for a few lines, brows furrowed in concentration, until he apparently decided it was acceptable and snapped it shut, striding over to the loveseat Harry was occupying, and sitting next to him.
