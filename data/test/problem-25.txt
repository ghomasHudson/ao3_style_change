Malfoy has always been a constant. He has grown...aged...matured, as all people do. He has changed; had to change. But he is still Malfoy.
Looking up at his old head of house, he smiled. “Good so far. I have the last bit I just brought today to unpack, but so far I don’t have any complaints. It is admittedly good to be back.”
I hope you enjoy!
Harry did as requested, being as gentle as possible as he maneuvered the dead weight that was Snape in his passed out state. He did want to cause any more damage to the man than had already been inflicted that day. With a final grunt, Harry deposited Snape fully onto the infirmary bed before he stumbled backwards from the effort, the back of his legs hitting the bed behind him and causing Harry to sink heavily down onto the mattress, his balance shot.
The room before him was glowing in a soft yellow from the sconces on the wall, which he had earlier charmed to light whenever he entered the quarters. The glow was heightened by the fire crackling in the hearth, its warmth eclipsing the slight chill that had settled in the early September night air. With a wave of his hand, grateful for his knack at wandless magic, he reset the wards and added a silencing charm for good measure out of habit. Shrugging out of his robe, he hung it on the hook beside the door, bending down to remove his boots before setting them below the robe and then surveyed the room in greater focus.
Pushing through the protesting of his body at simply having to move, Harry pushed himself up, careful to not put any further weight on the man below him and began to quickly shove away the smaller debris surrounding the pair. What felt like a lifetime later, Harry finally moved one last small broken board, his eyes instantly falling to Snape’s battered face.
, Harry thought as he looked back over to the other bed, his heart rate jumping with worry for Snape as he seemed worse off than Harry seeing as Poppy was intently focused on the man. Harry’s mind was whirling. It was too coincidental that they both ended up here again after everything they went through yesterday, right?
Cornsilk? Sure, let’s go with that. It sounds delicate and soft. Soft like the hair I’m staring at.
- is still unknown. So far the Aurors have not found anyone that can give an adequate description of the individual.” Her face grim with the admittance.
“I’ll walk you out. You two stay put.” Poppy eyed both men. “We need to discuss a few more things before I am ready to let you out of my sight.” With that, Minerva and Poppy headed towards the door, heads together, their quiet voices fading with each step away from Harry and Severus, leaving the pair alone.
Turning back to Novalee, Harry gently prodded, “What else do you remember?”
Harry let his eyes fall closed once again to the sound of the quiet words now exchanged between Hermione and Neville, too tired to fight to still-present exhaustion, and was on the cusp of sleep when he heard Poppy’s voice laced with frustration echo around the room. “I just don’t understand.
Savior of the Wizarding World.
The fucking Golden Boy.
At first, the woman was silent, eyeing the pair with a practiced eye. Soon however, her stony features cracked and her face flooded with warmth as relief washed over her at seeing the two men still relatively in one piece. “Thank the Gods you are both alright!”
With another, gentler push from Minky, Harry decided it would be easier to not argue with the small creature and returned to his place on the sofa, but not before first stopping to select a book from his shelves since he wouldn’t be getting any classwork done after all. The cushion sunk around him as he situated himself and opened the heavy book in his lap, beginning to read Anatolus Anatoly’s
Just as it was when Harry was a student, the trays and platters of overflowing food appeared before his eyes until the tables were groaning under the sheer weight piled atop them, delicious smells assaulting his nose. Oh, he had missed this. Hermione may hex him five ways to Sunday if she ever heard him admit this aloud, but nothing beat the Hogwarts elves’ cooking. Even Mrs. Weasley’s cooking didn’t hold a candle to the spread before him.
Frustrated beyond measure, Harry tried to focus on his surrounding for a moment. He still had a heavy weight bearing down against his back. It was solid and did not feel like a body pining him down, so Harry didn’t believe that to be Snape. No, it felt too stiff, almost like heavy boards or something as equally sturdy. But how could that be? What actually happened?
Poppy was standing next to Snape’s bed, but her eyes were glued to Harry as he sat slumped forward on his bed, elbows on knees. “What happened, Harry?” she asked with an urgent, no-nonsense edge to her voice. “I do not want to risk running any diagnostics on either of you just yet until I know what I’m dealing with.”
Harry had left the Headmistress to think about his proposal and the idea had grown from there until she called Harry back to the castle the week before his birthday and very abruptly asked him if he would be interested in accepting a teaching position as the Board of Governors had been impressed with the idea of a companion theory course and whole-heartedly sponsored the course addition for the upcoming term. Harry had accepted the position the next day and since then, it had been a whirlwind attempting to get prepared for his first year of teaching within just one month.
into existence directly in front of the pair.
charm has a goal of producing a corporeal patronus is one thing, but understanding that at even a very base level, the charm itself means ‘I await a guardian’ helps to build the knowledge of the purpose behind the charm -- to produce a protective force. Diving deeper than that, the charm only works by the caster thinking of their happiest memories. Does anyone know why?”
A constant.
Fortunately, Poppy returned before Harry could argue further, so he pushed Snape’s comment to the side and focused on what Poppy was saying as she handed over several potion vials, more than ready to be out of the infirmary.
Harry nodded in understanding. “Yeah, I should too. I need to check my notes for class tomorrow.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Watching magic, when you really took a step back to notice all the minute changes in the air and the light was quite mesmerizing and Harry was entranced by the soft yellows, blues and white of the diagnostic charms. Harry would have been relatively content to just watch the flicker of one charm to the next, but a gasp from the mediwitch had Harry’s eyes snapping up in concern.
Admittedly, it had been awkward to say the least when both men started to work together. Old habits die hard, as they say. However, neither were the same man they were the last time they had spoken. Harry had grown up and had found a deep respect for Snape after viewing the man’s memories and Snape, well, he just had a new respect for life in general. Nearly dying in the horrific manner that he had was bound to change the man. They had quickly found a rhythm of co-existence.
Casting a
Fifty-two steps to my left is the exit; the exit I so desperately want to escape out of.
, which makes sense if she were going for a
“As you should, Potter. As you should.” Before Harry had time to open his mouth to retort back, Snape was leaving in a flourish of black fabric, leaving Harry staring at the empty doorway. Shaking his head, he went back to the book in front of him, diving back into his notes again.
The door closed with a solid thud in Novalee’s wake, leaving the three adults alone. Harry rubbed his hands over his face, falling back into the cushion of the chair behind him. “Well that was interesting.”
Harry was pulled out of his wallowing by a soft
(See the end of the chapter for
“You weren’t interrupting at all. I was just going over my notes for my next class.” Harry motioned down to the text and parchment in front of him. “Can I let you in on a little secret?” The girl nodded and stepped closer to Harry’s desk as he crooked his finger in her direction, motioning her forward. “I’m a bit nervous with this teaching business.” Harry whispered, not sure why he actually told the young girl this. Novelee’s eyes grew wide at the admission.
and I think people maybe expect a bit more from me.” Harry still wasn’t sure why he was admitting this to one of his students, but it was too late now to take it back unless he wanted to
Harry and Severus simply nod their understanding, neither willing to argue with the formidable woman.
Draco must have finally seen the pure exhaustion that Harry was sure was written all over his face and for that, Harry let out a small sigh of relief. “Fine, but you have a lot of explaining to do tomorrow, Potter,” his tone soft as he spoke, the undercurrent of worry still clearly behind the words contradicting the request. Draco’s thumbs gently rubbed along the lines of Harry’s jaw, running slowly and softly over the scabs and stubble. Harry leaned into the touch, letting it be the calm comfort he so desperately wanted in that moment.
“Now Severus, what does this mean?” Minerva asked again, but this time her tone left little room for argument or further delay.
The next day dawned much earlier than Harry would have hoped, light streaming across his eyes as he and Draco apparently had forgotten to draw the curtains the night before. He knew he was alone in the bed, mainly because long limbs were not splayed over him. Draco would probably deny it with his last dying breath, but the man resembled an octopus when he slept, tangling his long limbs with Harry’s at every opportunity.
Surprisingly Snape didn’t argue. He just kept the fabric pressed tightly against his head, eyes slowly surveying the scene around them. “What happened?”
Snape’s dark eyes bore into Harry’s and had this been another time, Harry may have actually been intimidated. But as it were, he was exhausted and couldn’t find it within himself to be cowed by the still-prickly man. “In my defense, it worked didn’t it?” he bit out.
“I tried to save you!” The volume of her words echoed off the stone walls, startling the adults. “I tried to cast a
“Of that, I am more than aware,” Harry replied, a genuine smile flitting across his lips for the first time since this ordeal began as he slowly bent to crouch beside the grouchy man. “I wasn’t rescuing you. I was rescuing him. I am well aware of your skills -- both wandless magic and curses of, let’s say, questionable origin. There has been enough drama and mayhem for one day, we don’t need you adding to it. Anyways, we should get back to the castle.”
Dark eyes blinked a few times while Snape tried to orient himself through his lingering daze from unconsciousness. “Poppy -” the name was slowly enunciated, “- why does it feel...as if my face...is tingling?” Snape asked, his voice sounding even deeper and rougher than normal.
though told Harry he was better off going to sleep and not bothering his boyfriend at the late hour.
His two grey eyes...no, grey isn’t right.
This isn’t part of his constant. He always fit.
The problem is, no one else has.
“You do realize it is Sunday, right?”
Harry was the first to speak up. “Not really,” he answered with a small shrug. “I just remember getting up, answering the door, hugging ‘Mione, and then absolutely nothing until I woke up here. I didn’t really get a warning before I blacked out.”
Draco let out a laugh that Harry didn’t think he could ever tire of, grateful the man had left the cold Malfoy mask behind him years ago. “Love you too, Potter. We will talk longer next time, I promise.” With that, Draco’s head disappeared from the flames and they returned to their normal warm glow.
Maybe it was the one-hundred and two other souls in this room with their two-hundred and four eyes watching...expecting...anticipating...somehow overlooking the broken man that I am.
“Harry,” a breathy voice called and soon Hermione was coming into almost-focus over him. “How do you feel?” the words rushed past her lips as she squeezed his hand.
The unreadable look on Poppy’s face wasn’t promising and it was quickly sending Harry’s heart rate speeding up, the  stress of the last few days and his already frayed nerves catching up with him. “What?! What is it?” he asked, the panic evident and rising in his voice.
“So strange...” Hermione muttered more to herself, although loud enough for others to still hear in the otherwise quiet room, giving Harry’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “I’ve never heard or read of a curse reaction like that, at least a curse that didn’t kill the recipient in a manner of hours.” Everyone was seemingly in agreement with that statement as there were five solemnly nodding heads around the room, Harry included.
This blast pulsed outwards, shattering the side wall of the Three Broom Sticks, burying Harry and Snape under the debris, and knocking down students and other patrons throughout the street with the shockwave. Novalee fell back at the force as well, a scream escaping her lips as all hell broke loose in the street.
Minerva cast a quick glance at the red-head, nodding in return. “Mr. Weasley.” However, her gaze quickly returned to Harry and Snape. “Will someone tell me what happened.”
Stepping carefully out into the foggy room, he toweled dry and shuffled his way back to the bedroom, pulling out a worn pair of jeans with holes at the knees and an equally worn oversized jumper. Comfort. That’s all he wanted right about now.
Giving the students a moment to finish up, Harry took another drink, happy his coffee was still warm thanks to the warming charm he had cast before he started his lecture. Setting the cup aside again, he noticed most of the students were just about finished up with their notes. “Let’s get into the good stuff now, shall we? Please open your books to Chapter 2,” Harry called out before diving into his first official lecture of his Hogwarts teaching career.
Harry could feel a slight blush heat his cheeks as he glanced back over the mess once more, embarrassed by the sight. “Er...can you help sort out the papers, Minky? It appears my magic is a bit, um, wonky right now.”
that echoed through the infirmary, silently praying to whatever Gods were out there that Snape would forgive him the action.
I do apologize for the bit of a cliffhanger, but I didn't like ending it at any of my other possible points.
I’m Harry Potter.
Twelve seconds I’m holding my breath watching Malfoy; watching the man watch me watch him.
Yellow and blue mixed together becomes green, but yellow will always be yellow on its own.
That was the first thing Harry became aware of through the darkness and haze that had settle over him -- a high-pitched ringing resounding in his head sounding like a flock of angry pixies. The second thing that Harry became aware of was a heavy weight against his back and a lump under him. He was alive though. Whatever had happened, he was alive because dying surely hadn’t felt like this before.
It just cannot be correct.Panic continued to bloom in Harry’s chest as he watched Poppy mutter charm after charm. He didn’t face down Voldemort, come back from the dead-limbo-whatever, defeat the snake-faced bastard, and become an expert in spell theory just to end up a casualty of some new magic that he couldn’t yet unravel -- something he was supposed to specialize in.
“Harry! Severus!” Poppy nearly squawked as her head snapped up from the parchment in her hands having heard heard the hex leave Harry’s lips, certain that Snape should not be taking any type of hex at this juncture, however minor. However, Snape just ignored her, instead continuing to stare intently at Harry.
“The -
Finally looking up from the results, first looking at Harry first and then Severus and then back to the parchment before her. “You’re pregnant.” The statement would be so unbelievable -- so impossible -- for the mediwitch if there weren’t four back-to-back scans to prove otherwise. “Both of you.” She looked between the two men once more, eyes then falling to the parchment grasped tightly in her hands once more. “But it can’t be. Wizards can’t get pregnant.”
“D-Draco?” Harry licked his lips nervously. “What are you doing here?” he asked, his voice shaking slightly with nerves or exhaustion or a combination of the two as he watched his boyfriend carefully. Draco didn’t move though. Or speak. He just sat stony-still in the armchair, eyes frighteningly narrowed, his face giving nothing away.
A rainbow of swirling colors.
The trio held their breath as the memory continued to unfold before them. The moment that Novalee’s spell and the killing curse collided, it was as if everything stood still, frozen in time. Novalee’s spell surrounded the pair in a bubble, much like a standard shield, but unlike a standard shield the bubble was opaque, obscuring Harry and Snape from view.
It surprised many, Harry most of all, that he found a passion for spell crafting and defense theory as opposed to practical application after the war, but it was true. Understanding how different magical elements -- magical energy, language of origin, intent, nature of crafting and so on -- could be combined in the creation of a spell and analyzing how one small
“Welcome to another year at Hogwarts and an especially warm welcome all first years. I do hope that you find your time here educational but memorable all the same,” the Headmistress greeted the room with a warm smile, standing in front of her chair at the head table. Since the end of the war and officially taking her post as Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall had softened, for lack of a better term.
Two bodies.
Snape let out another long pained groan at being vertical. Harry noticed that blood was still running down Snape’s face from the gash. “Bloody head wounds,” he muttered to himself as he grabbed Snape’s arm and pressed the fabric of the man’s sleeve against the wound in attempt stop the bleeding. “Keep pressure,” Harry instructed the other man, not willing to risk trying a healing spell with how worn out he felt. Knowing his luck, he would manage to cut off the man’s ear at best.
Poppy was clearly still doubtful of Snape’s request by the dubious expression she wore. However, despite her misgivings, Harry watched as she pulled her wand from her apron and began running charm after charm over the other man.
“Yes Potter, things always seem to end up being your fault.”
“So nothing stands out? Nothing at all?” Poppy asked again, the frustration with the lack of any sort of substantial information to explain what happened to both men clear in her voice.The room was silent, waiting on either man to speak. It was Harry that broke the silence with another small shrug. “Nothing stands out at out of the ordinary, at least given the circumstances of the last day. However, I guess I didn’t feel...right today. Really since last night.”
The Headmistress gently squeezed his shoulder. “We are very happy to have you back, Harry. I did want to inform you that each professor is assigned a personal house elf to assist them with whatever they find necessary, be that meals or cleaning in your quarters, assistance with delivery of items to other staff members and so on. Minky has been assigned to you, so just call for her if you need anything at all.”
The mediwitch fiddled with the wand in her hand, an uncommon gesture for the woman who always seemed to be so self-assured within the walls of the infirmary. “Ye-” she started, but bit back the rest of the word, letting her shoulders sag in frustration. “Honestly? I’m not certain really. I cannot get Severus to wake up. All my diagnostics show that he should be awake, but he is not responding to the rennervate.”
While he had rewatched the memory several more times with Snape and Minerva, trying to find any possible clues hiding in the dim corners of the memory, they all came up empty each time. It was frustrating to say the least.
Everything then snapped into place as the fog suddenly cleared in his head, setting in a bone-deep panic. Someone had cursed them! Hell, not just any curse by a fucking
Harry ran his fingers through his hair before he quietly responded. “Someone tried to kill us.” His fingers pulled at the clumps of his hair in frustration before continuing just as quietly. “I don’t know who or why or if they were aiming for Snape or me or both of us. All I know is that someone aimed the killing curse at us.”
This piqued Poppy’s interest. “How so, Harry?”
Poppy was not paying attention to her captive audience though, especially the stares of both Severus and Harry trained on her. Instead, she just kept running the charms, one after the other, brow furrowing  further at the results floating next to her. Without a word, Poppy turned, wand still held aloft, and began running the charms over Harry, the room eerily silent as if everyone were even afraid to breathe.
The silence of the room was nearly suffocating, wreaking havoc on Harry’s already shot nerves. He was near the point of crumpling to the floor, his legs shaking so hard that they could barely hold Harry vertical when Draco finally spoke, tone eerily even. “Harry.”
Shaking his head, still smiling towards the flames, Harry grabbed his tea again and switched topics. “How has your studying been going?” Harry knew the other man was probably running himself ragged with his studies still, especially since Harry wasn’t there to police him. Draco was nothing if not a steadfastly determined man and Harry knew that Draco felt he had something to prove not only to himself, but to the wizarding world.
The room fell silent for a moment, as everyone took in Snape’s words, mulling the potential of truth behind his words when all other factors were considered together. “Could it be the girl’s spell?” Harry turned his head quickly to the side at the sound of Hermione’s voice breaking the silence, before turning back towards Snape, waiting on his response.
Wrong side.
, Harry thought.
Harry heard his name called moments before a warm hand fell upon his shoulder. “How are you settling in?”
I also suck at maintaining verb tenses. I apologize for that too.
I can’t be broken, not in their eyes.
Harry realized that is exactly what was happening as the weight fully left his back and he was able to take a deep lung-full of air. The voices clearer now, just slightly muffled by the continued ringing in his head were now discernible as a mixture of yelling that Harry couldn’t quite make out and clear sobbing.
Harry paused then, grabbing his cup again and looking about the room. All the students were hastily writing notes, the scratch of quills against parchment filling the otherwise quiet room now that Harry has stopped talking.
Shrugging into his winter cloak and looping a warm, gray scarf around his neck, he left his quarters and headed down to the quad. Today was the first Hogsmeade weekend that Harry was chaperoning and he had the pleasure of chaperoning with Snape of all people. Not that Harry minded of course and he sensed that Snape didn’t actually mind either as much as he tried to deny it.
There were several beats of stunned silence before Poppy’s alarmed voice cut in. “What was the meaning of -” but her admonition was cut off by a long pained groan coming from the bed and dark eyes slowly blinking open. Before Snape tried to talk, Harry grabbed his earlier glass that still had water in it and slowly tipped it back against the man’s lips.
Harry felt a slight tug in his chest as reality sunk in that as of now, they actually were not, in fact, sharing that flat together. Instead, Draco was living in the flat and Harry was living here for the foreseeable future. They still agreed to visit each other as often as possible, but they knew both would be busy -- Harry with his classes and Draco with his job at St. Mungo’s and upcoming Healer’s licensing exam. Still, Harry felt empty at the thought of going to bed alone more nights than not after becoming so used to the other man’s warmth next to him.
Harry rolled his eyes at the backhanded compliment. Only Snape could praise you and try to cut your ego to ribbons at the same time. “I appreciate the vote of confidence, sir.”
“I...you’re....no, it can’t be.” Poppy just shook her head and then her wand as if that will miraculously change the outcome before running the charms once more, certain that something wasn’t correct.
“You’re done, Novalee. Go ahead to open your eyes.” Bright blue eyes blink open at Harry. “You did perfect,” he praised, smiling widely, receiving a tentative smile in return.
Ron was in front of Harry in an instant, steadying Harry with a firm grip to his shoulders, eyes wide as he looked his best friend over. “What the bloody hell happened?”
“Yesses Profess’r Potter,” she answered, nodding her head vigorously. Turning back to Harry with an oddly stern gaze, Minky placed a small hand and pushed at Harry’s shin with more force than Harry would have imagined, backing him from the room. “Yous go rest now, Profess’r Potter. Yous be needing your strength, yous do. Minky will fix this,” giving a small wave at the mess now behind her.
“He slapped you well and good across the face, Professor,” Neville clarified from the end of Harry’s bed where he was still sitting, safely out of direct striking distance.
Looking back, their relationship was actually one that didn’t surprise many people, at least those close to the pair, outside of Harry and Draco themselves. But somehow, with all of their tumultuous history, they made a relationship work and they were now sharing a flat and were still so stupidly in love four years later.
so she could be heard over the cacophony of the students, the Headmistress bellowed, “Quiet! Quiet everyone!” It took a few moments, but once the volume in the hall lessened to a satisfactory level for the woman, she finally said in a lower volume, “Let the feast begin.”
Poppy’s eyes went wide, her mouth falling slightly open in shock at Harry’s explanation. However, his brief answer was enough for her to jump into action, her wand weaving a complicated pattern of spells glowing a warm, pale yellow over the passed out man as a piece of parchment hung in the air recording results for whatever scans she was running.
“Very good, Miss Bishop. Five points to Slytherin.” The young girl blushed at the praise as Harry continued his lecture. “Yes, while a patronus can be used in other instances, such as sharing messages with others over distances or when face-to-face communication is simply not possible, the original intent of the charm was to repel dementors, among other dark creatures. Focusing on the dementors though, since their purpose is to suck out a person’s happiness leaving the victim to relive their worst memories, the charm is created by a burst of positive, happy energy essentially used to counteract the dementor’s power.
The woman clucked at him in response. “None of that now, Harry! You may call me Minerva. We have known each other long enough for first names, don’t you think?”
The picture on the right side was of him and Draco, sneakily taken by Ginny at Ron and Hermione’s wedding the year prior. The men had snuck out into the orchard to get away from the noise and press of bodies for just a few moments. They had found themselves by the old willow tree near the edge of the Weasley property and had taken a moment to snog each other senseless. Unbeknownst to them though, Ginny had quietly followed the pair and snapped the picture before sneaking just as quietly away.
“Finally, we have
In a somewhat rare display of brotherly affection between the pair, Ron pulled Harry into a tight embrace. “I don’t know, mate, but I’m happy you still are. We can figure out the rest later.”
The girl smiled brightly in return, presumably at Harry remembering her. “Yes, sir. Novalee Bishop. I just forgot one of my note sheets after class.” She motioned to the table she had occupied a short time ago and sure enough, a small piece of parchment was still on the top. “I apologize for interrupting you.” A light blush rose on her cheeks.
Brown eyes flew up to his face and Harry noted the brief flash of worry in them before Hermione schooled her features. “Oh hi, Harry. I was just dropping off some paperwork for the Headmistress and thought I would pop in and say hello since I was already here.”
He managed though, but would not have succeeded without surprising help in the form of one Severus Snape. As the Defense and Spell Theory course was intended to be a companion course to Defense Against the Dark Arts, the practical course which Snape had been teaching since he returned two years prior, the pair had to work closely to ensure the compatibility of their course structures and materials.
To escape from the one-hundred and three faces -- two-hundred and six eyes -- eyes all watching me, waiting for me to do...something...anything...I’m not sure anymore.
“Poppy, please,” he pleaded, the situation becoming too much him.
. This is technically considered an offensive spell since it incapacitates your opponent, but was still suggested as a defensive action and would serve that purpose brilliantly, preventing your opponent from cursing you by temporally taking away their ability to move, giving you ample time to further disarm and subdue them. What this shows is that defensive magic, what we will be studying this course, is made up of many different parts. There is no one set type of spell class that is the only thing considered ‘defensive’. Defensive magic includes both spells that do have a sole purpose of protecting the caster with little to no other ill-effects on the opponent, as well as offensive spells used to neutralize a threat. ‘The best defense is a good offense’ as the Muggles would say.”
Orienting himself now that he had the opportunity to look around, Harry realized he had been buried under the outer wall of the Three Broomsticks, judging by the gaping hole in the side of the building and the other boards and bricks scattered in heaps around him.
Snape was quick to respond with a shake of his head and a blunt, “No.”
“I’m fine,” Harry replied automatically, but deep down he knew he was anything but fine.
Waiting because I am broken. I’ve had enough time to myself to accept this fact.
“Precisely. I’m
Taking hold of Harry’s hand, the touch warm and familiar settling his nerves further, Draco lead Harry into the dimly lit bedroom, sitting him on the edge of bed. With slow, gentle movements, Draco removed Harry’s clothes with practiced care, banishing them to the hamper before doing the same with his own clothing, but not before removing a small vial from his trousers and handing it over to Harry to take.
“No, please don’t,” the words were quiet but rushed as they passed his lips. “He’s flooing over tonight after his shift. There’s no need to worry him while he’s working, especially since he is working with that asshat Anderson. Just please...I’ll tell him everything later when there is actually something to tell him.”
“Look at you being all prepared. I thought you were a Gryffindor, love. I didn’t know you knew the meaning of being prepared.” Even through the flames Harry could see the playful glint in the other man’s eyes and the underlying pride and pure love Draco had for Harry. That look did funny things to Harry’s insides and made his cheeks rapidly flush.
Harry laughed, not surprised that her password would be something feline related, just like Dumbledore’s was always very predictably sweets related. “Thank you, Headmistress.”
or another protective charm somewhere behind them in the crowd.
Turning towards Snape briefly, Harry quirked an eyebrow in question. “Have you ever seen a shield spell look like that?”
Platinum? No, not platinum.
The group watched as Novalee apparently made of up her mind and took a few steps toward the colorful storefront of Barlow’s before stopping in her tracks suddenly. The girl’s posture went rigid as her head whipped to the left, her focus going towards the dark alley that Harry could recall from his own memory.
Harry could swear he saw a shine in the woman’s eyes as if she were holding back tears. He didn’t have long to study them though because Minerva quickly pulled Harry into a tight, motherly hug. The gesture made Harry drop Snape’s hand as he moved to press it lightly to the woman’s back, trying to give her some sense of comfort.
Draco choked on whatever he was drinking on his end, eyebrows shooting up to disappear under his fringe.“What the hell has happened to the man?! I never thought I would live to see the day Severus Snape freely gave the Boy Wonder a compliment. You didn’t
“I’m perfectly fine, Potter,” Snape ground out, holding his glare. Harry snorted in response, taking note of the man’s still paler-than-normal complexion.
“So if you are both ready, I would like to bring the student in. ” Both men nodded in assent. “Very well. Mimsy,” Minerva called out and a moment later the house elf popped into existence. “Please alert Mr. Eliason -”
By this time, they had made it down to the village and were nearing the Three Broomsticks when one of the older Ravenclaw students flagged down Snape. The pair started to head towards the student and Harry was just about to tell Snape that he was going to go off towards the Shrieking Shack to make sure no students were causing trouble, knowing the older man despised the place for good reason, when he felt a building of light energy, like someone was getting ready to cast a
Glancing over to where Snape sat, back against the rubble the pair had been buried under and dark eyes glaring at the Auror trying trying to check him over, Harry sighed in defeat knowing that Ron was right. “Alright. Do me a favor though. Don’t let Hermione tell Draco,” Harry requested quietly, knowing Ron would tell Hermione about the events of the day as soon as possible seeing as Harry, curses and near-death experiences were all involved. “He has enough to worry about right now. I’ll floo him tonight once everything is settled.”
“What can Minky be getting Profess’r Potter?” the young elf squeaked out as soon as she appeared before her large eyes saw the state of the room around her. “Oh dears,” she breathed, wringing her tiny hands.
Quickly opening his eyes in surprise, Harry turned his head and peered back over to the other bed to see Poppy now leaning over the bed, nearly stabbing her wand towards Snape’s chest muttering the spell over and over with seemingly no success to awaken the older man. “Oh for Merlin’s sake --
“Correct! Five points to Gryffindor. While I was able to cast two corporeal patronuses, the differing level of positive emotion behind them was evident. The first, while visible was still very weak and would have been little defense against a dementor for long, let alone several at once. The second though was much more powerful, the shape more solid, due to the increased positive emotion I put behind it -- the happier the memory. So you see, knowing what a spell does is one thing, but understanding the theory behind the deeper purpose and overall spell formula can help to change the effectiveness and in the end, mastery, of it.”
Harry watched as the many of the students nodded in understanding, adding notes to the pieces of parchment in front of them. No one seemed to have a look of complete confusion, so Harry took that as a win so far. “Now, for the next part of the lesson, I want you all to imagine you are in a friendly duel with the person seated next to. Their wand is at the ready, pointing right at you. What is a spell you would cast to defend yourself; the first spell that comes to mind?”
The young Auror attempted to argue back, but Harry just shook his head at the man. “Trust him, believe me. Go find Auror Weasley. I got him,” Harry cocked his head in Snape’s direction, earning him an icy stare.
Harry stared a few more long moments at Snape really trying to sort out where this unorthodox request was going, but finally complied, swinging his own legs over the side of his bed so he was face to face with Snape.
The rest of the day flew by without incident, his fifth year class going remarkably well, and before Harry knew it, he was back in the Great Hall for dinner. He dished a bit of roast on his plate and dug in. As he was focused on the food in front of him, he heard the chair on his right pull out. Expecting Snape, a biting quip formed on the tip of his tongue as he looked up, but it soon died away. “Neville?”
With a similar skepticism, Minerva arched her brow at the grumpy man and instead directed her attention to the mediwitch that stood between the two beds. “Poppy, how are they?”
“Very good!” Harry beamed at the class and resumed his seat at the corner of his desk. “Now, let’s talk about these spells. The first spell --
And he looks as out of place as I feel.
Sitting up a bit straighter in her chair, she cleared her throat, the action reminding Harry a bit of Hermione. “Sir, a patronus is commonly used as a defense to repel dementors, which suck the happiness from a person. So if you are holding to a happy memory, they cannot feed off of you properly.”
His fingers traced the silhouettes in the picture with care before gently placing the frame on the nightstand.
, he thought as he grabbed his wand from the side table and cast the stinging hex as requested, enough power behind it that Snape should feel something akin to a very hard pinch on his upper arm.
Back in his rooms, he quickly changed into a pair of jeans and a well-worn jumper, putting away his books and class notes in the study. Casting a
Another fourteen seconds tick by, time passing around us...moving forward...leaving us broken and behind.
Harry mumbled out quite “sorry”, truly apologetic for slapping the man even if it
Mercury? Yes, mercury sounds right.
“Yes. She said
Before Harry let himself sink back into his woe-is-me thoughts, he decided to go about his nightly routine, brushing his teeth and changing into his favorite silky sleep pants while removing his shirt. Draco always preferred when he slept shirtless; ‘the better to hear your heartbeat’ Draco would always respond whenever Harry would ask why. He would then try to play it off as medically speaking, making sure Harry's heart stayed beating through the night, but Harry knew better. Draco had turned into a sap -- a sap that Harry was utterly besotted with.
Knowing his eyes were bigger than his stomach, but not caring in the slightest, Harry piled his plate full with pumpkin pasties, rich Yorkshire pudding, juicy sausages, roast chicken and much more. Digging in, he let his mind wander to the last few months while quiet conversation was going on around him.
“I felt nothing. Potter --” That, his last name falling past Snape’s lips, was all the warning Harry had before Snape’s dark wand was raised and pointing directly at him as the older man muttered the hex in return. Harry braced himself for pain, even going so far as to preemptively cringe into himself, but remarkably felt absolutely nothing. “Well?”
“Yes, unfortunately. I overheard him talking to Maribelle, one of the Medi-witches up in Spell Damage, that ‘the Death Eater scum wasn’t worth the air he breathed’. Wasn’t too hard to guess who they were talking about on staff,” Draco scoffed. “I always suspected it with the schedules and rotations Anderson gave me, but now I at least have it confirmed that he’d prefer me rotting in Azkaban or more preferably dead.”
No hands raised, which honestly didn’t surprise Harry. He had just thrown a lot of different information at the class and by the looks on some of their faces, they were still processing it all, while others were still calming their blush.
as a house elf appeared behind him. “Can Minky be getting Master Potter anything?” the small elf squeaked out, eyes hopeful as she smoothed the pillowcase covering her small form.
Snape drank greedily, allowing the water to sooth the dryness of his throat until there was nothing left in the glass. “Good?” Harry asked, gesturing to the glass in his hand and Snape gave a nearly imperceptible nod in return. Setting the glass back on the table, Harry took a step back to give the man a bit more breathing room.
That comment hung heavy in the air until Minerva leveled a steady gaze at both men. “Powerful indeed, but do either of you have any thoughts on how neither of you are dead right now?” she asked bluntly.
“Yesses Headmistress,” the elf replied, nodding wildly at the Headmistress and then grasped both men’s hands tightly. “Wees be going now.” With that, the trio disappeared with the faintest of
“Hiya, Harry,” the tall man responded with a wide, happy smile, clapping Harry on the shoulder before sitting.
Ringing.
Cradling the mug to ensure he wouldn’t spill, Harry shuffled his way over to the sofa, allowing himself to sink into the warn leather. Since he had a bit of quiet time before Draco would be returning after his shift, Harry figured he could work on reading through the research parchments for his advanced theory class, still not ready to try focusing back on unraveling yesterday’s events just yet.
While, Harry had gotten used to waking up alone more days than not since the school year started, he still wished this morning could have been different after, well, after everything. But he chose not to dwell on that fact, mainly because even thinking hurt right then, the inside of his skull throbbing with each beat of his heart.
Poppy shifted slightly, the small action drawing attention to mediwitch still stationed between the two infirmary beds. “Harry, Severus,” she started, looking between both men. “As much as it pains me to admit, I’m at a loss. Generally speaking, you both are as healthy as can be expected in light of recent events. With that said though, I insist that you both stay for further observation until we have some sort of idea of what caused your episodes and if there is a likelihood they will happen again. I’m sure the Headmistress will support my decision,” she finished, looking over to Minerva who is now standing at the end of Snape’s infirmary bed.
At this point though, all Harry wanted to do was get out of his clothes that still displayed dirt and flecks of debris as proof of the day’s events, down a vat of pain potion (or a more reasonable vial), and fall into his bed for the foreseeable future -- the rest could wait until the morning.
My right hand reaches out and now it is our two hands together.
“But I didn’t. Hey, look at me.” Harry paused, gently pulling Novalee away from his chest so that she could see him as he continued, although her hands still held tightly to his shirt. “I’m still here. Professor Snape is still here,” he said, letting his eye momentarily flick the older man in other chair before focusing back on Novalee with a warm smile. “What do you remember?”
He didn’t linger long and soon found himself at the door to his rooms at the base of the tower near the viaduct entrance. Like most of the staff, his rooms were not password protected like the house common rooms and instead set up with personal wards that only the particular staff member, the Headmistress and anyone else specifically approved were keyed into. Harry pressed his palm against the smooth stone to the left of the door, feeling the tingle of magic dance across his palm, and soon the door was swinging inward to allow him entrance.
Poppy’s hands smoothed over her apron in thought as she took in Harry’s words before turning her attention to the other bed. “Hmmm, Severus? What about you?”
Hermione mulled Harry’s word over before giving a curt nod in return, her thumb gently rubbing the back of Harry’s hand until his tight grip loosened. “Okay, Harry. ” She didn’t necessarily like Harry’s request, but she could respect it.
Happy reading!
They will have to keep waiting. Waiting for another forty-four minutes now...another two-thousand six-hundred and forty seconds.
Not physically or mentally ready to get into the details with Draco, Harry dodged the question, asking one of his own instead. “How did you know?” his voice barely above a whisper.
“Good night as well, Harry.” With that, Minerva walked out of the Great Hall leaving Harry alone.
“How was your first day, Professor Potter?” Draco asked, an easy smile falling on the man’s full lips and Harry wanted nothing more in that moment to pull the man through the flames and snog him senseless. It had only been just shy of two days since he had last seen Draco and he already dearly missed the comforting presence of the other man, among other things.
And now Malfoy is thirty-nine steps to my right. One face out of the sea of one-hundred and two others.
“You will get that wand out of my face or you find out just how adept I am at wandless magic. Do. Not. Tempt. Me.” Harry heard Snape snarl out as he finally made it back to the man’s side.
As the last student sat down, Harry set his cup aside and waved his hand to close the door at the back of the room. Taking a seat on the corner of his desk, he looked at the faces staring back, most with an expression somewhere between awe and rapt attention.
The Headmistress paused for a moment, readying herself for the last announcement she had to make, knowing all attention on her would be lost momentarily. “With that said, please welcome Professor Potter who has graciously agreed to oversee this new course.” At that, the hall erupted in chatter and cheers, with more than a few students stunned to silence, openly gaping at Harry as he sat among the other professors as if they hadn’t noticed him sitting there all along.
“What does this mean?” Minerva’s voice cut in from near the end of Snape’s bed, having followed Poppy over when the exchange of hexes began, her gaze shifting between both men. “Severus?”
Things did not go as Harry intended though. Instead of the papers gently floating into Harry’s outstretched hand, there was a muffled
“I don’t need a babysitter either,” Snape grumbled out like a petulant child.“Again, I’m aware. But I will have Ron after my arse if I don’t leave soon and Minerva will have my head if I don’t drag you with me. So we are going back together.” With a small shrug, Harry added, “Plus, Ron said they hadn’t caught the guy yet, so we aren’t exactly safe here.”
Hermione’s eyes drifted to the other bed as she spoke. “Professor Snape. Apparently he collapsed too. Neville found him outside the Great Hall and brought him in right after I got you here.”
Two-thousand five hundred and twenty seconds.
“They appear to be in perfect health considering -” her voice dying off as the
We are almost to the point where I can start speeding things up!
Novalee’s face took on a look of frustration then, creases forming as her brows drew together. “I don’t know what happened. My shield was there and then it wasn’t. I thought that it...that it didn’t work because it w-wasn’t there as a shield anymore.” Her voice grew distraught again as she continued talking. “It turned into ribbons. So many colored ribbons that were swirling around you. And then - then it - then you - EXPLODED!” Novalee sobbed out, burying her face tight against Harry’s chest once more.
Harry let out a long, shaky breath, trembling hands grasping at Draco’s forearms to steady himself as he felt himself start to sway. “It’s a long story and I’d...I’d rather not think about it anymore for the time being.” Draco opened his mouth to argue but Harry cut him off. “Please, Draco. You already know that I was attacked and I’m still standing, just a bit worse for wear.”
With another squeeze of his shoulder and that warm, motherly smile still firmly planted on her lips, she finished, “Best be going now. Tomorrow will be a long day and you probably need your rest. However, please do not hesitate to find me if you need anything at all, Harry. The password is ‘felis catus’.”
Draco had changed. Harry had watched it happen before his eyes and he was so proud of the man that Draco had fought to become. He just wished more people could see it instead of still lapsing into old prejudices, not being able to see past a few bad choices made by a young, terrified boy.
“I had a similar experience. The best I could describe the sensation I experienced would be a dulled but constant
“Humor me,” he deadpanned. “Please run any medical charm you can think of, even ones that seem unlikely to outright impossible. There must to be something we are missing to explain the lack of effectiveness of the active magic. The more passive magic -- the diagnostic charms -- appear to be working perfectly fine, but something is blocking the more active magic -- the magic tied to spells and charms and hexes meant to cause a physical reaction in the body.”
Harry looked around the room, as a good number of hands raised, pleased with the participation so far. This was going better than Harry could have ever hoped. “Mr. Mathis, what spell would you use?”
charm in our less-sson that it was - was like this translucent sil-silvery blue. Almost - almost like the color of a faded pa-patronus. But m-m-mine didn’t look like that.” A look of panic at the admittance flashed across her face. “Mine was more white, with flashes and swirls of other colors. Like a - like a rainbow.”
In the end, both were left in just their pants and Draco was soon gently pushing Harry back to lay against the pillows and climbing in next to him, pulling the blankets around them both. Harry felt the heat of Draco’s skin against his own, safe and comforting, as Draco pulled him against his chest and pressed a kiss to the top of his head that spoke volumes in the silence. “Sleep now,” Draco whispered into the darkness, his breath ghosting over Harry’s ear. And Harry did just that, in the safety of Draco’s embrace to the steady
With a snarl that would frighten any first year, Snape growled out a murderous sounding, “Fine.”
“Welcome to Defense and Spell Theory,” he said, smiling warmly out at the class. “I am Professor Potter and before we get started today, I want to make a few things very clear. I am here to help you all learn defensive magic. I desperately hope there will never be a true need for any of you to use this knowledge outside of this classroom or Professor Snape’s, but I am not naive enough to think there will never be the possibility. I am also here to guide you through the theory and hopefully lead you on your way to mastery of complex defensive charms. Finally, I am here to listen to any concern you have about your course work or related studies. I am not here however to answer questions about the war unless they pertain to our discussions and I am definitely not here to discuss my personal life.
Blood was running down the left side of the older man’s face from a gash along his hairline. “Snape!” Harry whispered loudly, hovering over the man to press the sleeve of his cloak against the gash in attempts to stem the bleeding. “Wake up, Snape! Please don’t be dead!”“Do cease your yelling, Potter,” Snape quietly growled out, followed by a long, pained groan. A pale hand materialized, hovered near the side of Snape’s head before unceremoniously falling to his chest.
No more than five minutes passed before Harry was watching as the Slytherin and Gryffindor second years filtered into the classroom. Even after four years away from the school, he was surprised that these two houses were still paired together for many of their courses. But then again, the dynamics of the houses appeared to have changed since he was a student, as was evident by the mixed seating arrangement the students adopted all on their own.
-- is considered a standard defensive spell because its purpose is to prevent your opponent from cursing you by disarming them, with generally very little physical impact to your opponent. Then we had the
Silver? No, not quite.
, Harry thought. Odd, and disconcerting that the spell was having absolutely no affect on rousing the man. Curiosity (and worry) got the better of Harry. He needed to know what was going on. “Poppy?”
“Impressive, Mr. Potter,” a deep voice called, dripping with mock disdain, but Harry could hear the actual masked praise behind it. He looked up from the book on his desk to see Snape leaning in the doorway to the classroom, arms crossed against his chest and obsidian eyes watching Harry closely.
Harry could have.
“What about the students?” Harry feebly argued.
Neville gaped at the older man, surprised by Snape’s sudden appearance and apparently still intimidated the man. Trying to break the sudden tension at Snape’s appearance, Harry spoke up. “Don’t mind him. His bark has become much worse than his bite. Don’t let him try to fool you.”
“Of course, Minerva,” Harry replied, wanting to sort everything out as soon as possible as well. Snape echoed his sentiments just a moment after.
September soon bled into October as Harry found a steady rhythm with his day to day activities. As the days worn on, he came to realize he hated marking essays just as much, if not more, as he hated writing them as a student. A necessary evil, as Minerva called them, especially for a theory course that had little other grading opportunities. But that didn’t mean Harry couldn’t grumble through them every evening.
It just had to be Snape. Harry couldn’t remember anyone else being that close to him when shit hit the fan.
Twelve seconds.
Poppy looked around at the other faces in the room, but everyone aside from Snape appeared just as uncertain as she was for where this demonstration would be heading. Deciding to trust the man she had known for countless years, she gave a quick nod and a quiet, “I suppose,” before beginning to giggle like a schoolgirl moments later, Snape having wordlessly cast the jinx.
from what she told us, so part of the intent had to be protecting Snape and I.” He paused, shaking his head briefly hoping the action would magically slot everything into place in his head but knowing there was no chance of that. “But something else had to be there too since any shield spell I have ever heard of before is worthless against the killing curse -- and that one clearly was anything but,” his hand flipping between Snape and himself as proof of the statement.
“I would like to know that answer as well,” Minerva’s voice cut in as the woman strode over towards the group, the infirmary doors closing noiselessly behind her. “You both seemed relatively fine last night. Understandably worn out, but I never would have assumed that either of you were under that level of pain or I would have insisted -” the word punctuated by an steely glare at both men, “- that you both be escorted to the infirmary as you left.”
Time passed in that odd way it does when you’re stuck somewhere you would rather not be, where it feels like hours have passed when in reality it had merely been just a few minutes. At some point, Harry cannot honestly be sure when, Neville came in with a nervous smile, although making himself comfortable at the foot of Harry’s bed. After a few questions making sure Harry was relatively fine, or as fine as could be, he fell into quite conversation with Hermione.
Turning next towards the set of closed doors at the back of the room, he opened the first door, his trunk obediently following behind him into the bedroom. He motioned the trunk to the settle at the end of the bed and as soon as it was, he reached in to gently grab the last item housed inside.
Hermione was silent for a moment, slipping Harry’s glasses up his nose instead of answering. It wasn’t until she took a few steadying breaths that she found her words. “You collapsed, Harry. You were hugging me and then you just crumpled to floor. Completely dead weight. I didn’t even have time to react to try to catch you.” Hermione’s face paled further, her teeth worrying at her bottom lip. “And I couldn’t wake you up. Nothing - nothing worked, Harry. So I brought you here to the infirmary. I didn’t know what else to do.”
“I agree with Professor Snape. You have done very well today, Ms. Bishop,” Minerva added in a warm, motherly tone. “You are free to head back to your common room now,” nodding towards the door at the back of the room.Novalee didn’t make a move though, frozen where she was on Harry’s lap as she looked at the other occupants of the room. “Go on,” Harry urged with a gentle touch to the girl’s shoulder. “You’ve had an eventful day. Go get some rest.”
Locating the trunk he had brought earlier in the day, he opened it and began taking out the last few items. Removing the large afghan first, a soft thing of gray and pale green yarn courtesy of Mrs. Weasley and her magic knitting needles, he draped it across the back of the sofa. Turning back to the open trunk and with a quick flick of his wrist, several pictures flew out and settled themselves against the walls and along the bookshelves and mantle while a battered, but well loved, tea kettle flew through the archway into the kitchenette in the back corner.
was a active medical class charm. Those types of charms should never be able to be be blocked. The medical charms were created specifically that way, the wand movements and enunciation very deliberately woven together so that as long as the person was still alive, the charms should have some impact.
“Good to hear,” Harry responded with a smug smile tugging at his lips.
The room was quiet for a long time aside from Novalee’s cries only disrupted by the occasional hiccup from the girl and Harry’s soft shushes. “You almost d-died. Oh Merlin, you - you almost died.” Her sobbing grew louder as she pushed out the words, burying her face into Harry’s jumper.
charm and misspoke in the moment. But that isn’t an incantation I have ever heard before and based on the how the spell reacted, that was new magic.” Snape shook his head, letting his astonishment clearly settle in his facial features. “Ms. Bishop will be a force to be reckoned with if she is creating new spells that powerful as a second year.”
“I -” Snape paused, his dark brow furrowing etching a deep line in his skin, “- I have never seen a spell react that way. Honestly, I’ve never seen magic look like that.” The bewilderment was clear in Snape’s voice, a tone that neither other occupant in the room could ever recall hearing before.
finally had an outlet. “Twelve bloody hours, Harry! Twelve bloody hours of no floo call...no owl...no damn patronus. At least I knew you weren’t dead or I would have been more out of my mind than I already was. Dear Merlin, I -” but the words died off and Draco was out of the chair and standing in front of Harry in a mere blink of an eye, his hands cradling Harry’s face as he turned it this way and that to catch the firelight, having finally noticed the disheveled state Harry was in. “What the fuck actually happened?”
With no argument, Snape downed the potion, albeit moving slowly to accomplish the task. As the last drop passed the man’s lips, Poppy plucked the empty vial from his hand, setting it on the bedside table before working on patching up the gash on his head now that the bleeding had finally stopped. It was several minutes more before she was satisfied that Snape was in no danger of immediate peril or death.
It was Snape that spoke up. “Now, I think we need to look at the memory. I have never heard of a shield react the way that Ms. Bishop described. That is just not how standard shields function.”
“Like hell you are! Snape’s still bleeding -” Ron let his eyes dart to the man still sitting on the ground behind Harry, “- and you both somehow survived the bloody killing curse! I think that last part constitutes as not being ‘fine’. And until we know who tried to kill you or why, it isn’t safe to stay out in the open like this.”
Constant things.
“Good, good! What else?” Harry scanned the room again, calling on another student. “Miss Price.”
Blackness.
Colors.
He held the large picture frame delicately in his hands and stared at the two pictures moving side by side. On the left side of the frame was the picture of his mother and father that Hagrid had given him all those years ago -- his first picture of his parents. He loved to watch them twirl and smile and laugh as they danced together. This is how he chooses to think of them -- carefree and so completely in love.
He then thought of a new memory, one of his happiest memories to date and called out the spell again. This time when his stag erupted from the tip of his wand, it glowed brightly and was nearly a solid silver form. Again, he let the animal prance around the room, nosing at different students until Harry cut off the spell again.
Anyway, I focus on steady things.
So...I suck at updating in a timely manner. I know this. I accept this. I wish I could say I will do better, but I would hate to lie to anyone. Because of that, please just accept my humble apologies for the delay and eternal gratitude if you are still here with me.
“Yeah, she’s a good kid. Brilliant really. She’s top of my class for the second years.” Harry smiled. “So what now?”
“We don’t know much yet, Poppy, but there are a few students that I plan to question,” Minerva interrupted, hear voice carrying through the large room as she swept through the infirmary doors, her facial features hard as she surveyed the scene in front of her.
Magic tickled against Harry’s palm as he waited for the wards to recognize him and the door of his chambers to swing open. Harry was exhausted, the events of the day weighing heavy in his bones and sore to the point that even his hair hurt, the deep ache having steadily increased throughout the evening, his prior pain potions from Poppy long worn off.
Harry gently squeezed the fingers that were back in his grasp. “‘s okay, ‘Mione.” And it was. From what he remembered, fuzzy as his memory was, there was most likely little else anyone could have done in the situation. Even he didn’t have any clue he had been about to pass out.
“I - I -” Novalee started, her eyes furiously blinking away the tears as her breath caught on her words.
“I am really just Harry Potter, a normal man with a not so normal past that surprisingly fell in love with magical theory and spell crafting who would like to share that passion and knowledge with all of you.” He paused for a moment, grabbing his cup and taking another quick drink.
Taking a few careful steps backwards until the bed hit the back of his knees, Harry finally sat down, swinging his legs up and settling back against the pillows. With practiced efficiency, Poppy ran her scans, warm yellow and blue and white light falling over first Harry and then Snape as the woman checked her two charges over, everyone else holding their breath for the results. As quickly as she had started, Poppy was soon lowering her wand, the warm magic lighting the room fading away.
Morning had indeed come quickly and before Harry knew it, he was showered, dressed, finished with breakfast and waiting in his classroom nursing a cup of strong coffee -- surprisingly Draco’s influence after the man developed a taste for the dark brew while balancing late night shifts at St. Mungo’s and studying.
“Harry!” the woman cried, spinning to look at him with wide eyes, wand still raised, although she quickly dropped her arm after the initial shock wore off.
As the time passed, Harry frequently found his eyes wandering over to the other bed, watching Snape sit eerily still, expression indicating the man was deeply in thought, most likely focused on trying to unravel this mess. Harry was hoping Snape was making more headway than he was, oddly at a loss for how everything -- the multiple, converging magics, the misspoken spell, the intense physical reactions -- fit together. It was a riddle that was frustrating to say the least, and one that was not doing any favors for the still dull ache in his head.
had surrounded Harry and Snape in a protective bubble a split second before the other two spells, but would be no match for the killing curse streaking through the air. It was only pure luck that Novalee’s spell, whatever it was, surrounded Harry and Snape the same moment as the killing curse landed on its mark.
Not long after, a quiet shuffle against the stone floor alerted him to a new presence in the room. Looking up, he saw the small blond girl from his second year class. “Miss Bishop, correct?”
As the door noiselessly closed behind him, Harry toed off his boots and hung up his outer cloak on the hook on autopilot. His fingers found their way behind his glasses to rub at his tired eyes as Harry took two unsteady steps forward before stopping dead in his tracks, gaze glued to the blond-hair-turned-golden in the dancing firelight and the grey eyes pinning him in place.
Minerva blanched at the information. It took her several moments to regain her composure. Clearing her throat and looking directly at Harry, knowing the young man was more apt to listen to her, she said sternly, “Harry, Mimsy will be taking you and Severus directly to the infirmary. You both will let Poppy do a complete check of you both and you will not leave until I have come back to check on you both myself. Do you understand me?”
Harry would not necessarily call himself and Severus ‘friends’ at this juncture, but they were pleasantly civil which worked well enough and for that, Harry was grateful. Making amends with Snape was something he had wanted to do since the dust had settled after the war, but the man had been a hard one to track down once Harry realized that Snape had not actually died in the Shrieking Shack as he had originally assumed. Harry had tried though, even convincing Ron to do a bit of snooping after he graduated from the Auror academy.
“What’s the meaning of this?” Poppy asked loudly, clearly startled by the men’s sudden appearance in her quiet ward as she appeared in the doorway to her office. Before Harry had chance even open his mouth in response though, Snape swayed violently on his feet and suddenly pitched forward. It took every ounce of strength that Harry still had to drop the man’s hand and instead pull Snape into a vice grip against his chest, preventing the man’s face from becoming acquainted with the hard stone floor beneath them. Harry struggled to hold the man upright; Snape was heavier than he looked. “Oh dear!” Poppy squeaked out as she quickly made her way over to the pair. “Put him down over here, Harry,” motioning to the nearest bed.
sounding from some corner of his chambers and no parchment to be seen. Setting his mug on the side table with a furrowed brow, Harry gingerly got up from the sofa and made his way towards the room currently serving as his private office.
Well, until yellow is lemon yellow or sunflower yellow. But then again, lemon yellow and robin's egg blue mixed together will still always be some sort of green and lemon yellow is still lemon yellow in the end.
Minerva’s face softened at Harry’s question as she neared the small group, although her posture retained a stiffness born of the intense stress of the last few hours. “No, no. I don’t suspect any of our students had anything to do with this. I just would like to understand the series of events through their eyes. How are you feeling, dear?” eyeing Harry closely as she stood at the end of his bed, hands grasping the white footboard as she watched the younger man closely.
Those sensations, simultaneously crashing over him, caused Harry to shut his eyes tightly again, bracing his hands on his knees and swallowing convulsively to push the bile back down, until he no longer felt like he was spinning wildly out of control. Blinking his eyes slowly open for a second time, he glanced over to his nightstand through narrowed slits and spotted a folded piece of parchment. With slow, deliberate movements as to not aggravate his body further, he grabbed the note, eyes skimming over the familiar handwriting.
of a descriptor.
That just didn’t make sense. While Harry obviously knew that there were types of magic designed to repel or block other magic, such as standard shield charms, a
All too soon the feast was ending, bringing Harry back to the present and he found he had eaten to the point of being nearly uncomfortable in his trousers, but the food had simply been too good and although he probably should have skipped dessert, he was not known for being able to turn down a good treacle tart when placed in front of him.
Pushing that thought away -- he would evidently have time to theorize about that later -- Harry focused again.
Someone calling Snape’s name.
“Potter, hex me. A mild stinging hex should be sufficient.” Snape’s voice was deep and commanding, cutting through Harry’s daydreaming.
With a glance at the older man, Harry asked, “Ready?” Snape just nodded curtly in return, but his hand tightened almost imperceptibly in Harry’s own. Before Harry and Snape could make their escape though, Minerva
Harry reached out again and this time Snape slide his hand into Harry’s outstretched one, a strange tingle passing between the two men at the contact. Harry paid no mind to the sensation, attributing it to whatever magical force kept them two of them alive when in any other magical reality they should be dead. Instead, he focused on using the little energy he still had in pulling Snape to his feet and supporting the other man and he regained his equilibrium.
Ten fingers.
Shuffling out of the bedroom and into the kitchenette, Harry turned on the kettle and started the tea steeping short moments later. The rich spice was welcoming as he grabbed the mug gently between his hands and inhaled the warm, comforting smell.
Snape let out a nearly undignified snort at Harry’s comment. “Of course I would. I need to know if you are adequately preparing them for my course. You have done, dare I say, passable.”
Harry cast a quick glance through the doorway at the small fire in the living room and wondered if he should floo Draco just to check in and see how the other man was faring. A quick
“Can we just leave it at that for now?” Harry pleaded, feeling like he was edging closer and closer to collapsing on his feet at any moment.
Snape finally turned his attention to the Headmistress. “I am not certain yet, Minerva. However, I wanted to test a theory I had been considering while Potter and I to be relegated to these beds for observation,” he answered with a hard gaze landing back on Poppy that spoke volumes of his feelings on the matter. “As you can see, despite the slight magical fluctuations Poppy noted in her diagnostics, the concern is not our magic. If it were, the tickling charm would not have worked on Poppy. Our magic is still functioning appropriately when called upon, which leads to what I had wanted to test. I believe that there is something, some force, continuing to provide a sort of shield for both Potter and I, which is why the rennervate cast on me earlier did not work earlier.”
