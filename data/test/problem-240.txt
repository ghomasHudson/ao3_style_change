wanted you too,” he says in a very low voice, licking his lips and looking somewhere next to Harry’s ear.
,” he hisses, a cold lump of some sort rising up his throat as the mental image of a puffy-faced Malfoy, asleep in the hospital wing, floats before his eyes.
He had since the start of the term and he’d never even admitted it to himself until now. But maybe Madam Pomfrey’s potions were bringing down his inhibitions tonight or something, who even knew. His heart galloped up to his throat and his stomach was a pool of something scorching hot and his cock was now properly straining against his pyjamas.
“I could,” Harry agreed, leaning forward and planting a disgustingly sweet kiss on his mouth before pulling away once more. “I want to meet your mother.”
Malfoy shrugs again. “It’s barely been eight months since Mother died,” he says lightly, “Pansy and Blaise are going to his parents’ and I don’t much like his new step-father – he’s younger than us and talks of nothing but Quidditch and Mrs. Zabini's tits. Father will expect me to come visit, of course, but I’d rather spend the day by myself at home than at bloody
Harry cut him off by catching his mouth, mid-sentence, in his. Humming contently, he immediately kissed back, pushing his hands into that messy mane and gripping, clutching tight, just like he’d so desperately wanted to a few minutes ago.
Harry had also gotten a golden snitch tattooed beneath the nape of his neck after losing to Draco at a Seeker’s match. Draco had been gleeful and extremely smug, not to mention relieved because they had made a bet that the loser would get the tattoo the very same day and Draco had been terrified at the very notion of having ink punctured into his skin and left there permanently. Personally, the only marks he liked having on himself were the ones Harry left on him.
“Hi,” Draco finally says, breaking the nerve-wracking silence. Harry lets Caesar bound out of his arms, tucking his thumbs into his pockets and bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet. “You look so much better,” Draco says, the wonder in his own voice clear.
was in there the whole time; me, Harry. So, it was just the matter of holding onto that bit of my consciousness and with each transformation...that bit of me got stronger and—” he suddenly snorts playfully. “It’s like taming a pet,” he says, grinning and looking rather proud of his ridiculous analogy.
Harry tore back into the living room and there... At least twenty dementors, bleeding into the house like solid black shadows. Albus stood in the centre of the room, looking like he was about to faint.
With a final noisy suck over his nipple, Draco straightens back up, breathing noisily through his mouth, throat rattling. Swiping his slick hand impatiently through his own crease, Draco settles into place, only briefly using his hand to line Harry’s cock up to his rim, finding the tip with an easy swivel of his hips and bearing down to keep it in place.
Harry’s head still swims lightly, the whiskey burning through him with every pump of his furiously thumping heart. His cock is oozing slick, wetting the front of his pants and seeping slowly through his trousers.
Potter had stared, his throat bobbing as he swallowed hard, his gaze dark as it roved over Draco’s face, his whole form, before nodding and saying, “Maybe you could brew me some more potions?”
His prick twitches inside Malfoy as he looks down, lifting onto one arm where he’s curled around Malfoy, both of them lying on their sides; his groin is pressed firmly against Malfoy’s bum, and his cock is apparently stuck inside Malfoy.
“Look me in the eye and tell me how you think I’m going to take this baby away from you,” Harry grits, fingers tightening around Malfoy’s wrist until he feels the bones grinding together. “You fucking
do you want from me?! Did you want to finish what these worthless shits came to do?! Should I roll my sleeve up for you, Potter?!”
“I doubt there’s anyone who wouldn’t try to catch a glimpse, Malfoy,” Potter says calmly. “It’s quite all right. D’you want to take a closer look?”
“Draco,” Harry’s mouth brushes gently over his eyes, his forehead, his cheekbones, “I haven’t looked at you in months. I haven’t
To Draco’s quiet horror, he is not annoyed by it at all, as he might have believed he would be to have a keen-eyed, fidgety, not to mention ruggedly (
“And you never thought to bring it to my attention?” I don’t bother masking the accusation in the question and she laughs.
Draco mouths like a goldfish at her for several seconds, deliberately not looking Potter’s way. “But...what does it even mean?” he asks once more, voice rather thin.
This time the silence stretched on long enough for Harry to believe they’d laid the topic to rest. He wasn’t going to force Malfoy to learn how to cast a Patronus.
Potter carefully avoids Draco’s eye, biting his lip and scratching his neck. Draco wants very much to kiss him.
“Are we friends with the bloke?” Ron asked weakly. Harry barked out a laugh before quickly clearing his throat.
“There’s nothing I’d enjoy more than taking you down, you overconfident ginger git.” Draco smirked as Weasley’s sister sang a low
Harry jerks his arm free and trips out of the pub. Outside, he’s digging through his pockets for his cigarettes only to remember that he’d finished his pack that afternoon and hadn’t bought anymore since.
“You...must be patient with me,” said Malfoy. “I realise I can be difficult. I realise we share an unpleasant history.”
“Always did know you were a hubristic wretch, Potter,” Lucius seethes, “Just like your father, from what I remember of that Mudblood-loving swine.”
“It’s just—He’s always around, isn’t he?” I scowl down at the bottle in my hand, aggressively peeling off the label with my thumb. “And now when he isn’t we’re still bloody
“What exactly am I doing, Malfoy?” Harry slams the tub down on the counter beside the quietly vibrating ice cream machine. It disappears with a slight
Harry’s on his feet quite suddenly and is radiating that same raw, undefeatable power that Draco had felt emanating from him that first time he’d walked into this house weeks ago. He remains frozen still where he’s sitting, looking up at Harry with a calmness he doesn’t really feel.
I genuinely hadn’t noticed him gliding over to my other side. He’s standing at my elbow, clutching a tumbler of what I’m sure is expensive scotch, and his eyes are not shining anymore.
Potter covers the few inches between them, planting his right hand on Draco’s belly and bringing his left up to cup Draco’s jaw. “I’m sorry,” he breathes earnestly, his expression soft and beseeching. “I should’ve told you before we—I’m sorry. It won’t—I won’t leave like that again.”
“Flourish and Blotts,” said Malfoy, deadpan. When Harry just stared stonily, he added, “It’s none of your business, is it, Potter? It’s not fucking illegal to own a sword.”
Draco just stares at him, his mouth hanging open, his chest aching with how quickly his heart expands with joy.
!” Draco screamed, tugging at his silvery grey robes that he’d dug out from behind the fridge. “These were a gift! You filthy little bastard! Let. GO!”
intelligent and that’s...well, she’d never admit out loud to something like that unless it were true. And he’s...” Harry hopes Malfoy can’t see his cheeks pinken in the gloom of the room, “you know, handsome. Really handsome,” Harry adds rather feverishly.
Draco, fucking into him with brutal force and speed, bending Draco’s spine inwards with his grip on his hair.
“I don’t understand, Potter, what it is that you want from me? A written invitation? A formal permission slip? I don’t get it.” Malfoy kept his face turned away and his eyes firmly shut as he spoke, his legs falling sideways from where they were folded over his chest.
“No, actually, I think I spotted him head into the gents’ with two half-dressed birds,” Ron informs us. “Bastard barely waved back,” he adds hotly.
Potter leans back and crosses his legs, gazing steadily at Draco as he picks up his own cuppa. “I think you’d submit to me either way,” he quips, mouth quivering before he takes a sip, eyes locked with Draco’s.
,” Ron says like that’s supposed to explain everything. “And you; well, you’ve been pining after him for months now.”
?” Malfoy’s scream fractures the brittle air in the enclosed, stone kitchen, no trace of warmth in the space despite the fire.
“If it hadn’t been for her, Scorpius and I probably wouldn’t have made it. She...spent all her magic in keeping them away. I...was trying to pack some things. When I turned around, it was already done.”
“I usually just sprawl out on the floor,” Potter says, as if he’s read Draco’s mind, and as Draco looks around, he sees a couple of books and the day’s newspaper strewn about on the Persian carpet. There’s a mug of tea, half-finished, on the glass topped coffee table, and several bunches of roses and peonies in mismatched vases and pots on various surfaces around the room, something that instantly reminds Draco of his mother.
“Harder,” Malfoy wheezes at once, the second Harry pushes back into him. “Potter, you inept bastard, harder—oh
“Yeah, so you said last night,” Potter deadpans. “People don’t usually say ‘I hate you’ during sex, you know?”
“Hi,” he said shortly, plonking himself down opposite Malfoy and carefully moving the stack of books out of the way so he could see him clearly. Malfoy looked completely startled for about three seconds after which his mouth pressed into a very thin line and he pointedly looked back down at the Runes he was translating.
Lip curling, Draco raises his sixth tumbler of scotch at Potter and downs it in a single gulp. Potter doesn’t even blink.
“No no, of course not,” Harry turns to her with a wry smile, “He’d have blown up the place, the touchy prat.”
under him, squirming on his elbows and knees, working his erection against the sheets and lifting his arse high.
“What?” he asks distractedly, standing on one leg, leaning back into the side of the closet, examining his foot while holding his wand angled to throw more light on it. “What’s golden?” he asks again, looking up.
Harry laughs so hard, he nearly drops Draco. Then he winds a hand around the nape of Draco’s neck and pulls him down, bringing their mouths together for a kiss so deep and so fiercely intense, that for one discombobulating moment, Draco wonders if this is in fact their actual first kiss, because that’s how thrown, how awed Draco is.
Harry’s mind was blissfully blank by the time he heard the curtains being pulled shut again, right before the room faded out and he was fast asleep.
“You will not touch him,” Harry rumbles warningly, looking straight at Lucius as the air around the room starts to crackle with magic. “You will not touch Draco.”
, Malfoy,” Harry says irritably, jabbing a hand towards the plate of food. “I’d like to leave the past as far behind us as possible and I
“Draco,” Harry breathes, staring unblinkingly at Draco’s cock, gently lifting his hips as though trying to get Draco’s body to slide down his torso.
“Is it a crime to want some alone time with my boyfriend now?” Draco’s voice has a bitter edge to it, so Harry places a very sloppy kiss onto his cheek.
Granger is scribbling away as she nods. “No fluctuating appetite now, I hope? Your nausea should be more or less receding by this point.” Draco nods. “Good. Any cravings? Mood swings?”
. He’s naked, Draco, and when he sits up and looks around again, he spots his clothes bunched together on the floor at the foot of the bed.
Then he’s bolting forward, crossing the space between where he stands and Malfoy’s room in less than a beat and watches as the door flies open for him. Malfoy, halfway across the room, whirls around with a hoarse yelp of shock.
Hermione draws her hand away, the corners of her mouth quivering. “And you’ve not engaged in...any form of sexual intimacy yet?”
His breath fogs in opaque clouds of white before him, almost exact in resemblance to the other opaque, pearly white forms prancing gracefully above their heads all around the courtyard. Draco pretends to watch his own breath-cloud as it forms, dissipates and reforms with each deep breath of frigid air he pulls in. It’s freezing cold and yet the courtyard resonates with shrieks of glee, bright, carefree laughter and bellowed, genial name-calling, all of it complemented further by the presence of over half a dozen silvery Patronuses with their warm, pearlescent radiance that dazzles them all.
Eventually, Lily’s hiccups die down, her red little face softening as Draco wipes it carefully and tickles her belly, grinning as she squirms happily, green eyes just like Harry’s and Scorpius’ crinkling warmly. Harry walks in after a few minutes, his t-shirt still bearing signs of Lily’s breakfast, and looks oddly guilty at the sight of Draco sitting there holding the bottle to Lily’s mouth.
He’s wearing a pair of soft, grey, terribly comfortable looking jogging bottoms, and has a towel slung around the nape of his neck, his chest and stomach gleaming with a thin layer of perspiration. He has a set of huge dumbbells on the floor beside him, and is drinking deeply from a bottle of water.
And when they’re not frantically fucking or desperately snogging, he and Potter take walks together, go to the cinema, go out to brunch or dinner, or very simply, just stay home reading or watching television – together; always together. Draco doesn’t think he’s spent this much quality time with anyone in the past, whether he was sleeping with them or not. It’s fascinating and also rather terrifying; fascinating because he actually finds himself enjoying it,
“No no,” Hermione smiles, glancing up, “There are potions now, of course, that facilitate wizards to bear children if they desire.”
“I...met a guy,” Draco says eventually, “It was about a year after the War; we were both taking the same diploma course – Potions,” he adds when Potter frowns enquiringly. “Richard and I—well, it was new for me, he was my first relationship and he was rather irresistibly charming and well...I slipped, I guess.”
Narcissa makes a slightly impatient, huffing sound and gets to her feet, plucking Lyra up from his lap and turning away dismissively. “I’d like to remind you that I probably know more about sex than you do, regardless of how adventurous you and Harry might’ve been. There’s something to be said of
“So there,” Malfoy sniffs, looking away with a huff, cheeks still blazing, “Save your apologies for things that actually matter, for things you actually
Hundreds of students seemingly held their breath as Harry Potter hurtled towards the freshly mown grass, the Ravenclaw Seeker’s panic palpable as he followed far, far too slowly.
quick smile. They both glance down at the headline stating the Harpies’ loss to the Magpies when Potter sets the paper down, and then suddenly Potter looks back up at Draco with a little frown.
I’ve remained surprised about this. I’d always imagined Draco to be loud and very vocal about his pleasure. This quietness that he practices makes me want to wrench sounds out of him.
“Come in, it’s unlocked,” Draco calls out and Potter slowly edges into the room, still in his grey joggers and Gryffindor t-shirt from the night before, hair an abominable mess that made Draco wonder if he rolled about like a dog in bed.
when word gets out that your grandchild is part Potter?” And then without a trace of modestly, Harry adds, “Have you forgotten who I am?”
When Harry joined him again the next evening, Malfoy looked up, blinked once, and turned back to his homework; when Harry sat down opposite him the evening after that, he wordlessly moved some of his books out of the way. On the fourth evening, when Harry’s quill snapped, Malfoy fished out a spare quill from his bag and handed it over with a vague hum.
If Harry notices Draco staring, he doesn’t acknowledge it. Draco takes his hand and they meander over to the clearing in the middle to join the others who are already dancing. Lovegood notices them over Blaise’s shoulder and smiles serenely at Draco.
Ron is staring down at my hand clenched in his jumper with a small frown which he then directs at me. “No. They broke up.
“Ah!” Draco rears up, coming to stand properly on all fours, knees spread wide. Panting, hair falling into his sweaty face, Draco cranes his neck to glance at Harry, whose chin is gleaming with saliva, teeth slightly bared as he stuffs his fingers in and out of Draco. “Fuck me,” Draco tells him quietly, bucking back onto the three stiff digits. “Fuck me, Harry.”
“You want romance, I’ll buy you bloody roses,” Harry murmurs, licking his way up Malfoy’s back, smelling the sweetness of expensive soap under the tang of his sweat.
He slaps a hand down onto the man’s shoulder, squeezing hard enough for him to flinch in pain as he turns to scowl at Harry. “Fuck off,” Harry says mildly, but there must have been something in his expression that’s not entirely mild because without even blinking, the man instantly raises both hands in capitulation and backs away, disappearing into the crowd.
mouth of yours run away with you, Malfoy.” His fingers tighten around the handful of hair and Draco winces as a few strands are snapped free. “Open,” he orders calmly. Once he’s pushed the head back in, Potter smiles a slow, promising smile at him. “Lesson one,” he murmurs. “When you’re given a choice between sucking cock and bitching,
His grip is unbreakable but not because it’s that tight, but because in the brittle silence between them, that hot, calloused hand around Draco’s arm seems to be comforting him
Potter’s groan is loud and decadent, a rich timbre that has Draco breaking out in gooseflesh as he tears his t-shirt up over his head one-handed and sinks his teeth into his throat, biting away at the taut chords of his neck. He bucks wildly, mindlessly, until Potter grabs his arse and sets up a slow, hedonistic rut, fucking Draco’s hand, grinding against Draco’s own seeping length.
Granger smirks slyly and it’s so uncharacteristic an expression on her that Draco is rather taken aback. “We both know you’re a smart man, Malfoy,” she says, still sitting slouched and at ease. “I think you know what my opinion is. Or do you just want to hear it said out loud?”
,” Draco’s hair tumbles down his back as Potter eases the thin elastic off, “when all I can think about, day and night,” Potter brings a section of the glossy, flaxen hair over Draco’s shoulder, lifting it and dipping his head to bury his nose in it, “is
“I can feel it sometimes,” Potter says quietly and quite out of the blue. He’s staring into the fire, eyes slightly glassy. “I can feel it trying to rise up in me, like it’s trying to get out.”
Harry swallows again, this mouth and throat suddenly dry, his cheeks slowly flooding with heat. “It doesn’t matter, really,” he replies, shrugging. “People will think what they want to think.”
“Ron can take care of himself,” Potter chuckles. “It’s not like he’s the kind who’ll shut up either.”
“Yeah, I’m used to working out with these two,” I dismiss, towelling my neck dry, and the man chuckles, a low, rumbling laugh that instantly has Draco standing up straighter and running a hand through his hair.
“I...” Draco is well and truly short of words now and can hardly stand the ache spreading across his chest.
Moody looked extremely startled. He’d apparently been arranging and burrowing into Draco’s robes and when he was suddenly exposed he went completely still, sitting up on his haunches to stare up at the floating fridge and then at Draco who stood there, panting and red-faced.
“Word spreads, Potter,” Draco says quietly. “Gnopf is well known and he didn’t bother keeping mum about it.”
And then one late evening, almost a month later, Harry found himself in the library with Ron and Hermione (not) doing his homework while (mostly) staring at Malfoy who was sat alone in his usual corner table by the window, from the corner of his eye.
Without much ado, he lines up, shoves into Malfoy and immediately starts an wild, unsparing pounding, rocking the bike dangerously under them as he ploughs over and over and over into the scorching clutch of his arse. Malfoy screams into one arm, one arm flying back so he can claw at Harry’s hip, rearing up and craning his neck to shoot him a fierce, burning glare when Harry pulls out for a moment to spell some lube around his cock.
“THAT’S MY NEW DESIGNER SHIRT!” Draco howled, flinging the book aside and charging at Moody, who upon realising he was being followed quickened his pace, scrambling away with the shirt firmly caught between his sharp little teeth. “GIVE IT BACK! GIVE IT
“This can’t be comfortable for you,” Hermione acknowledges, waving a hand at his crotch. “You look awful,” she adds, gaze roving over the dark half-moons under his eyes that plunge halfway down to his cheeks, the way he’d paled, his skin tinged with grey, the way his hair is almost frighteningly out of control.
Harry fidgets vigorously. “Er... Just, you know...gift ideas,” he clears his throat, “for my boyfriend.”
Malfoy obliges willingly enough, smirking into the flat, quivering plane of Harry’s belly, tongue running up along the trail of dark hair to his navel, which it then dips into. He applies teeth every now and then on his way up, leaving bright red spots behind, teasing one dark nipple with his tongue incessantly until Harry manhandles him onto him back once more, snarling into his mouth for another loud kiss.
Having no idea which way to head, Harry marched into the trees at random. Twigs snapped underfoot and his ankle hurt every time his foot rolled off a stone wrong. He realised that the gushing of the water was getting louder and presently, he trod right into the little stream that ran across his path.
Harry is throwing his whole being into fucking Draco, thrusting hard at a swift, pounding rhythm, Draco arse greedily gulping him in, lube and precome squelching out of him with slick, squishing sounds that only serve to further stimulate Draco, the crassness of it somehow immensely hot. He’s throwing his hips up onto Harry’s cock, baring his teeth and tearing his nails down Harry’s chest as he leans further over Draco, slinging his knees over his shoulders and bending him in half.
Then they’re both panting, completely winded, Harry’s hands slowly sliding up the cooling sweat on Draco’s back, Draco’s cheek plastered to Harry’s damp chest. The calm silence between them is somehow more significant than anything either of them could’ve said in the moment.
“Yeah.” Harry licked his lips slowly, staring at the way the wet cloth clung to Malfoy’s body, imagining what it would be like to peel the material off him.
“Oh,” Harry tilts his head, returning the same sly smile, “I didn’t realise you were available to pull.”
“I can tell you miss him, y’know,” Ron says wisely. I don’t respond. “Especially because you’re like...y’know? In love with him?”
, that’s just something I made up to stop the press from linking me with literally anybody I was seen with!”
Frigid grey eyes snap up to his and Harry hurriedly abandons his statement, pursing his lips and watching Malfoy shred tissue after tissue in staunch silence, the little pile of spontaneous confetti between the salt and pepper shakers and the grimy bottle of HP sauce gradually growing.
He cannot stop thinking about Potter. He cannot stop his mind from drifting back a week, recalling every little detail with painful clarity.
“Nothing,” Malfoy says innocently, trying and failing to feign nonchalance – he’s still shaking, Harry notes.
“I did not say that,” Harry says at once, short of breath for some reason, his head filled with deafeningly jangling of warning bells. “Malfoy, I knew you were worried about them and so I asked Ron to keep an ear out for their whereabouts.”
“Why didn’t you just move back in with your parents?” Potter asks after a pause, gentle but oddly desperate.
Malfoy had frozen still as the group passed by the alley, twitching involuntarily as Harry’s mouth had moved lower and lower until he was nibbling over his tailbone, shivering getting progressively more vigorous. Now, however, he’s gasping out sharp little cries, because Harry has slipped his hands under him and is relentlessly rolling his tightly beaded nipples between forefinger and thumb, mouthing at the dip above his arse crack.
I increase the speed on my treadmill and focus on breathing in and out as I wait for the routine bickering session that’s about to commence.
My hands are inching past the waistband of his ridiculously tight skinny jeans and he’s trying to turn around in the cramped space of this fucking wardrobe we’ve snuck into like a pair of randy teenagers and now his viciously pointy elbow is in my face.
So now, instead of taking it off, Harry simply rucks the jumper up over Draco’s belly and applies his mouth to the warm skin of his stomach, sucking moist little kisses and swirling his tongue into the shallow dip of his navel, Draco quivering under his mouth.
The heady, sweet scent of him washes over me and Draco’s hand is warm as he pushes it into my hair, fingertips pressing into my scalp, tugging gently at the roots, placing the nearly empty mug of beer in his other hand on the bar with a thud – I’d not taken Tristan’s mug from him.
“She’s beautiful,” Draco whispers, sneaking a look at Potter just in time to watch his eyes light up a bit behind his glasses, the bright flare of orange from the fire reflecting off the lenses.
Because when Veela mated, they mated for life, and Draco doesn’t know if Harry Potter, with all his noble, righteousness, will want Draco the same way that Draco wants him.
He has a dimple on his right cheek, the man, not quite deep as Potter’s own twin dimples (which always seem to make him appear
Granger is practically beaming at the pair of them now, hands clasped on her file, gaze flicking between them like she’s watching tennis. When they both stop and look at her, she lets out a loopy little sigh and looks back down.
Grinning, Malfoy permits Harry to nuzzle his cheek. There’s a brief silence again during which Harry simply breathes against Malfoy’s skin.
“I’m not very surprised, either way. Spontaneous pregnancy with Harry Potter, who just happens to be an Alpha werewolf, who then moved me into his best bedroom and bought me everything galleons can buy before unwittingly knotting me – this is just my life now.”
Looking very serious now, Malfoy said, “I would have to agree. You seem absolutely incapable of protecting yourself
“Didn’t we decide to hold off on knowing whether it’s a he or she?” Malfoy replies, eyes already falling shut again. “Read to your offspring, Potter; pick any other book you like. I’m likely going to be asleep before you open it anyway.”
Draco loved them all. He could spend hours running his fingers over each outline and silhouette, every patch of colour, every graceful curve and curl of ink. They all looked beautiful on the background of Harry’s tanned skin, each one telling its own story. When they indulged in leisurely sessions of lovemaking Draco always found himself pressing soft fingertips and softer lips over each one, watching Harry’s muscles jump and shift under his touches.
“Alright, so,” she thumbs through the pages again, “Your weight gain looks normal – you’re a little under actually, but your urine, blood and magical-signature scans look healthy enough so it’s nothing to worry about. I
--” Harry struggled, fidgeting with his quill. “I mean--! It’s not like it’s something standard, right?! Us having sex? The least he can do is
?” Malfoy grits furiously. “You’ll come barging into my house? Have you not a modicum of respect for a person’s
Malfoy reaches out with his free hand and wipes a smear of mousse off Harry’s cheek. There’s a puff of smoke and a flash of light and they both turn to see a reporter hurrying away, camera held high out of reach.
been real with each other, they’d been in the middle of a war, and they’d not had time to pause, to slow down, or to consider the meaning behind their words and actions.
“That just sounds like any other fight you might have with Malfoy,” she says, looking bewildered. “Why did this one result in you...”
Releasing his arse, Harry crawls over him, hunching down to murmur against Draco’s neck, “I see you, baby,” following it up with a loving lick up to his ear.
Harry laughs against Malfoy’s cheek, kissing it once again before pulling back. “Let’s see it,” he says cheerfully, turning to face him once more and settling cross-legged.
. The stooped old thing had still been yelling in affronted indignation at Draco in its grating, bullfrog like voice a few seconds later when Potter had barrelled into the room with his glasses slipping down his nose, wand drawn, wearing nothing but a thick, terry towel wrapped firmly around his hips.
Harry shrugs. “Felt like going out tonight,” he says lightly. “Besides, I’ll be there most of tomorrow anyway. What about you? Did you have to ditch plans to come here with me?”
dinner, anyway, and maybe you would like it if he made you some dinner as well, to maybe eat here with me or...you know--” Potter’s ramble takes on an increasingly helpless tone and he just stands there, looking vaguely horrified at himself until with a sudden
Later, many, many long minutes later, they huddle together on the sofa under the old patchwork quilt, the cooling sweat on both their bodies making them shiver and press closer, the wireless crackling softly, the sweet melody issuing from it stirring something in Draco’s mind to the forefront.
He laves over Harry’s nipples some more, biting hard into the skin around them and leaving stark imprints, already purpling by the time he finally licks his way down the taut, quivering muscles of Harry’s hard abdomen, dragging his teeth over the firmness of it and lapping at the sparse line of hair trailing down from his shallow little navel to his thatch of coarse black curls.
Potter is a ridiculous teacher. He’s full of garbage techniques like ‘focusing on happy memories’ and ‘emptying your mind of negative thoughts’. Half the time that they’re there together, pointlessly practicing something Draco feels he’ll never actually succeed at, Draco wants to ask Potter to stuff it.
Malfoy has the decency to flush although his chin does jerk up defiantly. “I’ll write you a list,” he drawls sarcastically and Harry feels something bubbling up to the surface.
“An advanced Wolfsbane Potion, yes,” Draco confirms, swirling his cloak on. “And I swear it’ll taste better than a lot of potions you’ve consumed in the past, Potter.”
! I—I mean--!” The album slides out of Potter’s lap as he goes purple-faced and shakes his head vigorously, spluttering wetly as Draco bites his lip to keep from laughing and narrows his eyes threateningly. “Not that I’ve
want?” Draco has snapped before he can stop himself – it wouldn’t do to push Potter too far past the point where his innate chivalry ran out though. Potter has stayed unnervingly silent about the whole thing and the last thing Draco wants is for people to know he’d gotten hard with Potter attempting to give him multiple fractures in combat training.
“Oh!” But Harry was already pulling out, breathing noisily into Malfoy’s damp neck as he paused with just the head inside for a second before thrusting back in.
He smiles – smiles, not smirks – and willingly comes over, eagerly tilting his face up for a kiss which I suck onto his pink pout. When he presses closer for more, kissing me back, I just
But Draco didn’t get to tell Harry that he needed to either get a new cage with a more complicated locking system or throw the ferret out entirely. Draco didn’t get to dramatically fling the bathrobe at him. Draco didn’t even get to
Harry looks around the cafeteria with affected curiosity. “Is the press here?” he asks, grinning when Malfoy rolls his eyes and kicks him under the table. “So, are we going to find a place together or what?”
“Your hair smells different,” mutters Harry and Draco blinks, leaning back a bit so he can look him in the face.
to realise that some things are beyond your control, love; you have to cut yourself some slack there.”
“For your birthday?” When he looks over he sees Granger frowning at him in puzzlement. “What’re you talking about?”
“Now’s a good time as any,” Hermione says shortly. “Besides, it’s not as if you have much choice. Might as well find all the happiness you can in this situation – at least for the baby’s sake.”
“Aren’t your knees sore?” Draco murmured softly, reaching up to straighten the black, square framed spectacles and pressing a quick kiss to the jagged scar under the messy fringe.
Grinning, Harry jumps to his feet. “Excellent,” he says happily and Malfoy looks more startled than anything else. “Thanks, Malfoy!”
sucking his cock now, fights not to buck up into his glorious mouth, forcing himself to lie flat and still, legs shifting restlessly on either side of Malfoy. For the first time in days, in
Running unsteadily down the hall and into the living room, Draco was just in time to catch a glimpse of soft terry gliding along the floor into the kitchen and whipping out of sight around the corner. He let out another yodel of furious distress and sprinted forward, barely aware of his bobbing and wildly swaying erection as he ran.
Draco, standing on his front step, had stared at him expectantly, a drumroll of sorts playing in his head. “Would you
to you, young lady, look at me!” The sleek ferret didn’t even glance around at him from where she was crouched in the sink, and continued drinking straight from the tap. “
"Um... Um. Okay. So, um. I live with Uncle Remus now because of why I get sick sometimes." He fidgeted, with his own fingers. "Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon got scared of me, and dumped me by the Leaky Cauldron. They got scared, because... Because I got bit." He looked down. "B-by a Werewolf. Lots of people think that means I'm scary and bad, or that they should be sad for me, so I'll understand if you don't want to be my friend any more..." His voice got very quiet by the end.
Harry stuck close to Draco, sensing his friend's nerves. "I bet Uncle Remus means Ron Weasley. He's okay, but he's got lots of older brothers, so he gets jealous easy. Just don't make fun of him, and if he makes fun of you, I'll yell at him. Because you're my best friend, and he's not."
Draco oohed and ahhed at the store's wares, curious as to whether or not they really worked and how funny they were. He kind of wanted to try them out, but he had no money to spend, because he was always told he didn't need any. Even though he spent most of his time alone his parents didn't seem to worry about him getting lost, or really think about him much at all.
"Can I go play now? Or do you need me here to wait?" Draco asked anxiously hoping he could go play with his first ever friend. Draco started to bounce up and down excitedly as he waited for Remus's response. Draco reached his hand out to Harry's so that the boy could lead him away once he had permission.
Draco and Harry settle into a rhythm at Lupin's and then Ron Weasley is dropped off one day. What will happen when a third kiddo enters the mix? Will adult fights stop friendships? Or will this duo become a trio?
"Um... so. Being a werewolf means that every month on the full moon, I turn into a wolf. But because I'm young, I turn into a baby wolf, not a grown one. Um... books say that werewolves are vicious and will attack anyone when transformed, but I don't think that's right. I think they're scared and confused, because transforming hurts a lot. Um. If I bite you as a wolf, you would become a werewolf on the next full moon. But I promise I won't ever bite you, because you're my best friend."
Draco giggled loudly at Harry's pose but joined him immediately. Harry was always fun to be around, and Draco enjoyed being silly with the other boy. Draco pumped his fist in the air and said, "Yes let's go!" As he practically shook with excitement. Draco loved these adventures and knew this one would be great fun as well. Draco smiled at Harry and Ron and then followed them out of Remus's and into Diagon Alley, towards Flourish and Blotts.
Harry was pleased that Draco enjoyed the food. He thought Remus made the best food, and he was just happy that he didn't have to try to learn how  to cook it. He loved living with Uncle Remus, and he wished that they could keep Draco with them, too. He was sure now that he and Draco would be best friends, forever and ever.
"So what is the goal for our adventure today Harry? Where are we going to go first?" Draco asked, grey eyes alight with excitement.
As they entered the shop Harry said, "In here, they use these things for pranking. It's like playing a joke, but on lots of people instead of just one, or a really big one on just one person, and not getting caught if you can help it." He held the blonde's hand, happy. He figured the questions about the shop were more important right now since they were in the shop, but he would answer the ones about Remus later.
Draco hugged Harry back just as tightly, and made a noise akin to a purr at Harry's words. "Yes best friends forever and ever!" Draco said in a voice that dripped with hope and excitement. Being hugged was very soothing and slowly but surely Draco felt himself calming down.
He enjoyed playing with the plushes, giggling when the cat flopped as well. His eyes lit up happily, aware that he was the one making things happen, but trying not to force it. He thought it was the very best that Draco could make things happen, too, and wondered if maybe his new friend could talk to his secret pet with him. That would be really neat, if someone else could do that, too. Then they'd have a secret language, just for them!
Harry was starting to think that maybe they'd been wrong on an entirely different level, as well. His Mind Healer had pointed out his obsession with Draco Malfoy throughout his Hogwarts years. She'd also pointed out that he tended to notice men in the room before he ever noticed girls. Harry quite thought that perhaps this was why his attempt at a relationship with Cho had been so disastrous.
Harry sees Draco for the first time, and decides that he looks lonely. An important decision is made.
Harry did his best not to be bouncy and to be polite. "Good morning." He chirped happily, his eyes bright with joy.
Despite all of this, Harry adored Cajetan. When Harry interacted with the bird, he was well behaved. Cajetan would sit for him, permitted Harry to pet his head, and generally showed much more restraint. The bird was a bloody menace to everyone else, though, and didn't seem to care one whit how many times Harry asked him to be nice to others. The only exception to this rule- to everyone's collective surprise- was Draco Malfoy. Cajetan seemed to love Malfoy almost as much as he did love Harry.
Draco looked at Harry wondering what they should do first, but happy to have Harry nearby in case things went south. Draco decided to be as nice as possible, though he was a little scared about Ron finding out who he was. But Draco figured that if he was nice, maybe Ron wouldn't care. So Draco was kind and happy, and did his best to share Harry's attention with Ron, so that he wouldn't make Ron jealous.
As he listened, questions formed in his mind, questions Draco quickly asked Harry when he paused to switch directions. "Who is Uncle Remus? I take it he isn't related to the Aunt you seem to not like? Well if you are sure you don't mind I would like to stick with you, for as long as I can at least. Eventually Mother will notice my absence. Granted I am sure she will be mad when she does...."  Draco shuddered at the thought before turning to follow Harry.
"And yeah that was my Mother...she doesn't like to be seen with me for some reason, so when we are out and about, she always rushes us. She usually just grabs my arm and drags me along behind her. But are you sure I can go with you? I don't want to be a bother. I also am not sure where my mother went, or if she has even realized I am missing yet."
Ron smiled brightly. "I mean, I don't mind learning... Mum just gets so busy about it, and my brothers need help more, 'cause they're going to school sooner. I don't mind waiting while you read. A-and I'd like to get better at writing. Maybe... Maybe I could come learn with you guys? That way Mum won't have to work as hard." He looked hopeful about it. "Only... maybe we could ask together, because Mum is really busy, and sometimes forgets to listen. She doesn't mean to..."
Harry listened to Draco's barrage of questions. He was a little afraid to answer the last one, because most of the time when people found out, they were either afraid of him or they looked at him with pity. He didn't like either of those things, but he didn't want to lie to his friend either. He took a deep breath before answering everything.
“Ooh it would be cool if you could have your party here! That would be super cool and there would be all sorts of ice cream for everyone to choose from! Annnd as for ice cream, can I have chocolate and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream? Like a little of both? Or is that too much to ask for?" Draco asked curiously. He always loved ice cream but he didn't want to be greedy either. Mr. Florian smiled at Draco in response and added a tiny bit extra of both types for Draco, to reward the young boy’s manners.
Harry was looking forward to it. He had noticed the blonde boy in Diagon Alley who had stared at all the people hugging. He had stared when Remus had hugged Harry as well. Harry wondered why the blonde had smelled and looked so sad, but hadn't had the courage to go and ask. He thought, maybe, if he saw the boy again, next time he would ask. Maybe the boy had been like Harry, and all he needed was someone to want to be his friend. Harry decided that he would talk to the boy, next time he saw him, and be his friend and give him hugs. He didn't want the boy to smell so sad any more. He knew what it was like to be sad and lonely, and he didn't want anyone to be that way again.
It didn't take too long for a nice looking man in funny, shabby clothing to find him. Harry thought the man smelled familiar, and he trusted his senses. So he went with that man, and was taken care of after that. There were a couple of rough months, where he would sometimes wake up and the man would be hurt all over, and himself too, but he never remembered the man hurting him and he smelled truthful. It didn't take him long to become aware on full moons again, and realize that he was changing into an animal.
Remus chuckled, happy to see them all happy. He had already adjusted his lesson plans again, to include Ron, and sent a copy of the new ones to Narcissa, only mentioning that there would be another boy learning with Harry and Draco, and that he would make sure it did not interrupt their learning or hinder them in any way.
Harry bolted after his friend, grabbed Wolfy, and snuggled up with him. He could tell that Draco was very upset, and didn't want him to be so. He hugged his friend and his Wolfy close, his eyes watering. "Please don't cry, Draco."
Cajetan hooted again, forgiving his human easily. After all, it was clear he hadn't meant the disturbance. He eyed the crumpled up piece of parchment on the floor, and waited for his human to head to bed. It didn't take long, and once he was sure not to be caught the owl glided over to the parchment. Near the top, he could see the name of the recipient of this oddly shaped letter.
The snake nodded in its own way in return, accepting his apology. It hissed happily as its scales were scratched, tongue flicking lazily. "That'sss nice. You do it very well. We ssshould keep thisss one, ssspeaker-pup." It preened happily under the attention, enjoying the warmth inside and of the boys' bodies.
Draco asked nicely, wanting Ron to go first if he felt comfortable doing so. Draco was just glad to be at Remus's house, surrounded by friends and love, something he had never really had before. Draco waited for Ron to answer, excited to be doing something with this new friend of his. Draco did search briefly for Harry though, as Harry had become a bit of a fixture in Draco's world at this point. Draco saw Harry was happy and completely engrossed in his book so Draco figured he would let his friend be, and work with Ron and Remus.
Harry watched Draco, noticing in him signs of what he had felt living with the Dursleys. He knew that was wrong, because Remus had shown him better, and he instantly felt like maybe Draco needed to be shown better too. He offered a bright smile, and listened intently while the other boy talked.
But Draco was finished with trying to meet his father's expectations. Lucius Malfoy had already ruined the name of his family quite well enough. Draco didn't need to go on following in his footsteps there. He'd ruin the name of Malfoy in his own way, on his own time. He was just grateful that his mother had supported him.
He suddenly sighs, throwing the robes onto his bed where several other sets of robes lie in a carelessly tossed pile. “Am I an idiot for hoping this works out?” he turns to me. “This thing with Tristan,” he adds.
When he finally caved and let his gaze lock with Potter’s, he regretted it instantly. Potter was watching him, his gaze soft and dark, his mouth curved in a loose, terribly distracting smile that could only be described as
Harry awoke to a small hand on his face and an instantaneous memory of the night before. Lily sat beside him on the ground, staring intently at him with her face inches away from his.
It was small, just a few months old, Weasley announced, and had pure white fur and its nose and ears were very pink and it made strange, squeaky chattering noises and Harry had instantly been delighted, carefully accepting the creature from Weasley’s hands and cradling it, cooing at it and kissing its pointy snout.
Draco shakes his head, his reluctant grin getting wider by the second. “Try not to do that at the altar, please?” he requests politely.
“Sure it is,” Malfoy says blithely, flapping a hand carelessly. “This is a huge responsibility you’re planning to take up, Potter.
“Look, just—just come in for an interview tomorrow? Level Two, 11AM? I’m sure he’ll hire you on the spot.”
It’s his fifteenth or sixteenth attempt of the evening and he isn’t even sure he’d expected or hoped for it to work but then he’s saying the incantation and his wand vibrates in his hand as a shapeless cloud of glowing silver puffs out the end and arcs across the little room.
“Have you taken off your glasses?” Draco asks, pulling a pillow close and pressing his burning face into it. “Can you not see me properly?”
I nod my thanks and look down the bar to see Ron entering the pub, waving him over as he spots us. As he begins winding his way through the tables, Draco takes position, holding the dart delicately between forefinger and thumb, the vibrantly pink tip of his tongue sticking out as he concentrates.
He’s holding still and is very quiet, and when I look up through my fogged up glasses, he’s breathing through his mouth, eyes fixed on the ceiling, hands clenched on the pillow on either side of his head.
filthy mouth, or does just any filthy mouth work for you?” Draco really doesn’t want to admit to the truth.
, the permanent blond fixture in my life who does not know how to shut his filthy mouth and insists on keeping his inherent kindness buried under thick layers of scalding rudeness.
But Harry places the book aside, firmly brackets Malfoy’s face with both hands and kisses him again, not pulling away for long, breathless minutes until they’re both red in the face and sprawled out flat. Wordlessly, Harry works Malfoy’s pyjamas off and circles his cock with one hand, swallowing Malfoy’s soft moan as he works his fist over it on torturously slow, leisurely pulls that soon have Malfoy’s hips arching high off the bed.
Two days ago, I’d bumped into Draco, who is no longer with Tristan, at Rosenfield’s and he’d smiled at me and talked to me like nothing was wrong between us and then he’d discovered, in the shittiest way possible, that I’m back together with
“Oh, look at this mess.” Ginny, tanned and more freckled than ever, clad in denim shorts and a sleeveless crop top, her flaming red hair cut up to her chin in a wavy bob, is suddenly at the kitchen door watching Ron attempt to clean up the mess with a huge grin. “MUM!” she bellows suddenly. Ron looks up with an angry hiss.
” my arms bend back with the weight and Ron suddenly lunges back to catch the bar, staggering backwards with a grunt, right into Draco who topples back with a startled yell.
out of touch?” he asks and I want to smack him across the head the way Draco does sometimes. “I mean, I thought you’ve still been keeping tabs on him and stuff seeing as you’re—”
“Come in me,” Draco murmurs back, drawing him down into a kiss. “Come inside me, Harry.” His voice is barely audible over the
Snatching his hand away for the second time in half an hour, Draco hurries out, wiping his hand on his robes as he gnashes his teeth and glares around at everybody present in the outer office.
Malfoy was licking his lips now, smacking them like one did when their mouth was dry, and Harry could picture them behind his eyelids – wet and dark pink.

Harry darts forward, easily picking up the trunk with both hands. “Didn’t I mention? You’re going to be sleeping on the sofa.”
“Really?” Potter looks surprised, stroking his hands through the long, satiny grey fur. “He seems to like it. I think he likes
“Off our suppressant, are we, boy?” Lucius remarks suddenly, steely eyes carefully perusing Draco’s inordinate beauty, his glowing skin and bright hair.
“I don’t know how people will react,” Draco admitted quietly into the silence. “I can’t know for sure that the news will be received well and I can’t risk--” He stopped talking abruptly and leaned back, rolling his eyes in a way he hoped made him seem unconcerned. “Whatever, Potter. Can we drop it?”
It’s not like I’ve forgotten the past – it’s what made us both work hard at transforming the equation between us into what it is today. And I’m in love with the git
But then Malfoy paused, one hand on Scorpius’ shoulder, and turned. When he saw Harry watching him, he tilted his head, indicating to the staircase. Then, abruptly, he shrugged and hurried upstairs, holding Scorpius’ hand.
“Both,” Harry confirmed, pulling gently at Malfoy’s shoulder, trying to get him to lean forward so he could help him push his other arm in.
Draco’s response only seems to egg Harry on further for he doubles his efforts, pulling his tongue out and gnawing gently at the thin skin of his rim, plucking at it with his lips until Draco’s hole is winking open wetly, dripping with Harry’s spit. Draco’s arse feels bruised where Harry’s fingers dig into it, clutching him tight enough that the dull pain comes as a welcome distraction from his otherwise imminent orgasm.
“You get grumpy when you’re hungry,” he presses the chip to my mouth and I stubbornly keep my lips sealed together, glaring at him, “and you’re ugly when you’re grumpy.”
I brush some of it away and lean forward again, closing my mouth around his as he sighs, leaning in and deepening the kiss, slanting his head so his hair falls back onto his face, some of it getting in my mouth – and in my nose.
“Look at this!” Draco seethed, stomping into the living room to wave his torn robes in a very startled Harry’s face. “Look at what I found in today’s scheduled inspection of that little shit’s nest! He got into my
“I’m free to Glamour this,” Malfoy gestures to his rotund bump, “and find someone who wants to take me home and pound my arse all night.”
“Let’s clear some things up, shall we?” Draco’s smile is dangerous now. “My instructions to my friend were to
“You can just ask if you want to eat me out, Potter,” Malfoy sighs, badly hiding a smirk as he adjusts the quilt over himself. “You don’t have to make up excuses for it.”
Screaming, Draco comes again, pulsing hard down Harry’s throat, his balls throbbing painfully where they’re drawn up against his body. Harry doesn’t stop sucking the whole time, only pulling off with a rueful smack when Draco drags him off his softened cock.
“Then why’d you move out?!” Harry snarls, not waiting for Draco to answer before tossing down his cigarette and crushing it out, roughly shoving past Draco on his way back inside.
He doesn’t meet Potter, doesn’t go looking for him like he did most days – doesn’t seek him out and goad him into giving Draco a raging boner.
There is none. Malfoy is so quiet and for so long that Harry automatically starts rubbing his stomach in slow circles in what he hopes is an apologetic fashion.
Draco shuffles his feet, absurdly feeling his cheeks grow warm as he looks down and shifts the large, shiny wooden crate he’s carrying from one arm to the other.
A breeze whispers through my hair and blows the ash off the end of my cigarette. I pull in another deep drag, holding it down, letting the bitterness sink in, watching the way the bright orange tip burns its way higher up the tube of paper, leaving behind another trail of ash hanging precariously off the edge.
The man simply smiles at Draco before looking over at Ron and me. “That ought to have pulled a muscle or two – you alright?” he asks me and something about the (what seems to be genuine) concern in his eyes
Stark naked and hungover as all fuck, Draco strides out into the living room, crossing it silently on bare feet and bursting into the kitchen with his wand drawn.
know,” he laughs, breath catching as Harry repeats the motion and buries his face in Draco’s neck. “I wish that slimy seaweed eater had stuck around to watch this,” he murmurs snidely, gasping as he’s then rolled onto his back in a sudden flash.
to look at Potter, not right now, when he’s (not) dressed the way he is, not when the current sight of him is making Draco’s heart race and, the hairs on his arms to stand on end and... Other things to start to stand on end too.
“Perfectly adequate, Malfoy,” Harry answers lightly, floorboards creaking under his feet as he slowly walks around the cramped room. “How—how long have you lived here?”
actually thought you’d say no,” he murmurs, brushing his lips down Draco’s cheek and nipping at his earlobe.
“Oh, because I’m the kind that’s likely to listen,” Malfoy scoffs, even as he cants his hips higher, lifting his bum eagerly.
Draco turns just as Harry comes lumbering into the room, looking like he might burst into tears any second as he slumps facedown onto the bed with a sobbed groan.
“I hadn’t heard from you in over two weeks and I got worried,” Harry snaps, finally looking at him, heart fluttering as he once again registers Malfoy’s
,” the senior Healer had finally proclaimed after fifteen minutes of droning on and on about the hex Harry had been hit with, nodding solemnly as he stared morosely at Harry’s cock tenting the sheets that were drawn up to his waist. “Terribly unfortunate, Auror Potter. Our deepest sympathies.”
First long (ish) chapter! Hope you enjoy it! Draco is written by Meowfoy of course, and Harry is written by the lovely JoellethePoe!! Remus is sometimes shared by Meowfoy and Poe Narcissa is Meowfoy only as she generally is only around briefly when other characters are around.
He still stood out in Britain, since his species was supposed to be native to Indonesia. His coloring allowed him to blend in a bit more, though, since it would take a trained eye in ornithology to actually realize that the bird was out of place. Harry like that, a bit. He thought he deserved a bird that blended in. After all, there had already been a Hedwig, and he didn't think that this owl was a replacement. Not in the sense that he would ever take her place in Harry's heart. Still, he was quite a handsome specimen and Harry liked his looks.
Harry wriggled a bit, but decided that, since Draco hadn't fully given his secret away, that it was okay. Besides, he wanted Ron to join the sleepovers. That would be super cool. Then they could have after dark adventures for midnight snacks. "Sleepovers would be really, really cool!" He looked up at the adults with his puppy-dog face again.
Harry gave Draco a quick, tight hug. "I bet she'll be fine. It was mostly reading today, anyway. Uncle Remus says we're ahead, so he needs a day to plan things. He was just going to have us work on drawing after, which is fun anyway!" He wriggled excitedly.
Remus offered Narcissa a polite smile. "I apologize for the wait. Draco and Harry were having quite a bit of fun, and didn't want to stop right away. Harry and Draco seem to wish to write to each other. I hope that you'll be expecting a letter from him soon." He squeezed Draco's hand lightly. "It was lovely to have you, Draco. I hope you can visit again soon, you made our small flat very lively."
When Harry woke up, he gathered up his letter and begged Remus to send it, hoping dearly that it would be accepted and that Draco's father had said that they could be friends. He bounced a bit, until Remus woke up enough to send the letter off. He spent the rest of the day being as good as possible, as if that would have some effect on what the Malfoys had decided to do.
Draco listened intently to Remus's words and felt himself calm more, especially as Remus's words sparked determination within him.
Harry hugged his friend one more time, tight, before walking down the stairs with him and Remus to say goodbye when his mother took him home. He wished Draco could stay, but was already planning to write him plenty of letters and invite him to come over again soon. Maybe Draco's parents would say no, but he would keep on inviting Draco.
Draco felt better at Harry's reassurances, but he was still a little worried. He decided to just follow Harry's lead and do his best to be friendly.
"Well like I said we can discuss it with your father and see what he says. But first let's head home." Narcissa reached up and grabbed floo powder out of the pot atop the fireplace and threw it into the flames. Then she grabbed Draco and pulled him into the fire with her shouting. "Malfoy Manor!"
Harry blinked a bit. He and Remus had managed to get a small apartment off of Diagon Alley, and they were out getting Christmas presents for everyone. Harry had forgotten something for one of them, and had been running back to get it when he ran smack into someone. He blinked when he saw the blonde boy from before. He hadn't forgotten about the boy at all, and had been hoping to see him every day from when they had started living near the Alley.
Once they were out of the shop, he fished his purchase out and handed the bag to Draco. "Here. This is for you. Because you're my first friend I ever picked for myself, and you look nicer when you smiled. These should make you smile. Happy Christmas." He beamed brightly.
Ron grinned at Draco, completely willing by this point to fight for their budding friendship. This was something his siblings could never have, and he wasn't about to let it go for anything at all. He didn't care about what his parents would say, either. Draco and Harry were including him and cared that he was having fun. This was the best thing he'd ever had! "That sounds like a cool potion! Mum doesn't have time to teach me potions yet. The twins keep blowing them up, and she has to stop and fix things." He grinned. "And then ice cream after, yeah?"
"Are you sure it's ok if I stay? I don't want to be a burden..." Draco said using a word he had heard numerous times in his life usually about him. "Also do you know my parents? Umm my last name is Malfoy...if that helps. And if Mother is mean to you about finding me...well I am sorry for that too. I am really glad I ran into Harry though. I don't really have many friends, because well I am usually at home by myself....So I am sorry if I cause or have caused you any trouble, but I am not sorry that Harry is my friend."
Remus received the letter and sent a brief reply, having received it well after Harry had been tucked into bed. His heart ached a little bit for Draco, who surely only wanted his parents to show him love. It was sad, when parents were too busy for their child. Remus wished he could start a daycare, though he doubted that people would trust him with their children, given his condition.
"Sorry about that, Cajetan. I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm going to bed now. You have a good night." Harry had never found it odd that he spoke to his owls. He'd talked to Hedwig. She'd been a great listener. Cajetan was pretty good at it too, though his opinions varied greatly from what Hedwig's had. Still, he appreciated the listening ear.
Remus received Narcissa's letter after Harry had been put to bed, and read it over carefully. He smiled a bit at the mention of Draco coming the next day, already thinking of what he needed to do to take care of two little boys instead of just one. He wrote back promptly, actually finding himself quite excited that Harry had made such a close friend so quickly.
Here's another chapter, come and gone. I swear, these will likely get longer as we get past the 'we're setting up story' stages.
Remus checked Draco's face over for him. "You missed just a small spot, there." He cleaned it off for him. "You did very well at getting yourself clean." He smiled his tone warm and friendly. He quite liked Draco Malfoy, and thought that perhaps he would be good for Harry as well as Harry being good for him. He was, however, quite resigned now to the idea that Harry was likely going to be in Slytherin out of sheer stubbornness if Draco was sorted there.
Remus gave them time to fix things up a bit. He didn't want to pry into their friendship, and hoped that Harry would tell him about what they'd talked about. He had Draco's gift from Harry in his hands, intent on tucking it into Draco's pocket before the boy left. When he got to the door, Harry had already settled the snake and was hugging Draco. He knocked on the door gently. "Boys... Draco's mother is here to take him home. Harry, you can write to Draco later. I'm sure he'd be happy to get your letters. After all, he is your friend." He made sure his voice was loud enough for Narcissa to hear.
Draco straightened up as Harry and Remus finished speaking. While following Harry to the bathroom Draco spoke to Remus, his fears once again rising.
Draco didn't really mind when Potter wrote. He'd grown used to the idea that Potter was straight and likely never would return his absolutely childish crush. Which was yet another reason that Draco had moved out of the Manor. His father had been livid to learn that his only son was gay and would not be making any kind of, "appropriate pureblood match."
Remus nodded. "I prepare everything a month in advance, so giving you a copy of the week's plans should be no problem." He gathered the ones she'd requested and handed them over. "Today, we're just working on some reading, writing, and basic maths. Harry is quite adept at maths, and I'm sure he and Draco will help each other to excel." He offered a small smile, genuinely grateful to have a chance to do what he truly loved, which was teaching. "I don't mind you taking them home at all." He appreciated her respect, though he would be much happier once she was away and the boys felt like they could relax.
"Thank you Remus, for everything. I have really enjoyed being here with you both." Draco said kindly to his Remus.
Lucius glared at Narcissa for having lost their son, her incompetence bothered him sometimes. But he didn't feel like yelling at her now because there was something better to talk about. He looked at his wife and said, "You really need to be more careful with Draco. I realize that you don't seem to have the mothering gene but this is unacceptable. However the fact that our son has made friends with the famous Harry Potter is interesting. I think we should let them be friends, hell let Draco spend as much time with Harry as he wants. This will eventually work out in our favor, I am sure of it. We can ensure that Harry becomes fascinated with the Dark Arts and either he will lead us one day, or he will help the Dark Lord when he returns. We will be revered for this act, so I say we allow our son to be friends with this boy, and do our best to play it in our favor. You will write to Remus to see when he is available to watch Draco. Hell pay him for it if you want, just make sure our son and Harry stay close." Lucius gave a self-satisfied smirk at his idea. Then he went upstairs to check on Draco.
Harry was surprised by how much he was talking. He'd never talked to anyone quite this much before, but he quite thought he  liked it. It was strange to him, though, that Draco didn't know what a prank or a joke was. He would have to teach the other boy, so they could try to prank Fred and George together. He just knew Draco would get along with Fred and George too. And wouldn't that be neat? All his friends, friends too!
Harry hugged Draco as soon as Narcissa was away, happy he was there. He gave a wriggle at Remus' suggestion. "Say yes! Please say yes! Mister Florian always gives me extra, and I bet he'd give you extra too, cuz you're my best friend!" His eyes sparkled with mischief and excitement.
"Uh oh. Uncle Remus is coming. I have to put my snake back out the window, Draco!" He scrambled up to do so, not wanting to get into trouble. He knew the mess would be forgiven, but the snake might not be and he didn't want to lose it just because Uncle Remus got mad.
With that he followed Harry to the bathroom, curious to see what dinner would be, only just realizing he was hungry as his stomach grumbled loudly.
One family in particular came to his attention during a hurried shopping trip to Diagon Alley with his mother. Narcissa hated bringing her son out in public, and so she dragged him along at a hurried pace. During this outing, Draco's eye was caught by a group of people with flaming red hair. Clearly they were all related and his mother stuck her nose up as she passed them, showing her disapproval. Curious, Draco had watched the group as he waited for his mother to finish her shopping. The kids all seemed rather happy albeit a tad shabby, and the mother's face glowed when she looked at her children. The father and mother were going to split up to shop with their kids, and before they left each other hugs were exchanged. Real hugs, full of love and comfort, something Draco could never remember happening in his household. Draco stared at the family longingly, but was dragged out of the store by his mother before he had gotten his fill. Draco trudged along behind her, barely able to keep pace since he wanted to watch the family some more and he kept looking behind him. Draco didn't know who they were, and didn't dare ask his mother about them based on her attitude, but he made a note of them and decided to always look for them when he was in Diagon Alley. Even though he was only four, Draco knew his house wasn't the loving place that he was beginning to suspect it should be…
Harry offered her a brilliant smile, one that could melt anyone's heart. "I would like that very much, if he can, Mrs. Malfoy. I do hope that Mr. Malfoy says yes." He was doing his very best to be charming, which he was very good at, because he wanted to get his way. Which was to have Draco over as much as possible.
Ron noticed how close they were, and wondered if maybe Draco didn't have many friends. That would be sad, he thought. Ron didn't have many friends either, because older brothers and a baby sister didn't really count as friends in the same way. Maybe Draco would want to be his friend, too. He didn't mind sharing that with Harry, as long as Draco wanted to be his friend. That would be nice, having a friend that his siblings didn't have. He offered Draco a smile, deciding to try to be friends.
Draco hugged Harry tightly, trying not to cry at the thought of leaving his friend and Remus and their warm home. He focused on his mother's words of "maybe they can do it again" to try to keep from crying. "I will write soon too. Maybe after I get your letter first though so I can respond. I am going to go home now and practice!" Draco said excitedly, as he was determined.
Draco was surprised to see the red haired boy be dropped off, he even recognized the boy and his Mom. They were part of that big family Draco had seen in Diagon Alley on the day he met Harry. They were a family that hugged, and looked happy to see each other. Maybe having Ron play with them for a day or two wouldn't be so bad, Draco thought to himself.
Which meant that Harry had to finally buckle down and pick out a new owl for real. One that was sturdy and reliable. The problem was that he just couldn't find the right one. He was getting desperate, and about to go looking up breeders when he finally hit a patch of good luck. He found an oddity, an owl about as odd as he was, and they simply clicked. It was almost the same as when Hagrid had bought him Hedwig as a gift. Or at least, it felt similar to Harry.
Ron gave a joyful cheer. "Yes! I want to, I promise I'll be good, Mum! I'll do my best to learn and do good, I swear." He hugged Draco as they danced. "Can I have formal invitations for my birthday, Mum? Only... Draco wants to come, and I don't think his mum will let him if we don't give formal ones. A-and... I've saved all my allowance, do you think maybe it's enough to have my party at the ice cream place?" He looked up at her hopefully, his eyes shining.
Draco giggled a bit as Harry led him quickly yet gently through the street, to his home. He enjoyed the difference just holding hands made when running through the streets. Harry was gentle and didn't pull him so much as guide him as they ran along. Whereas Draco's mom usually left bruises when they walked for too long... Judging by the outside, Draco could tell it was much smaller than his home, but somehow he got the feeling that it was still nicer, and had more warmth. Draco stopped outside Harry's door and hesitated, suddenly unsure of his welcome again. His parents didn't really seem to want him so why would anyone else welcome him in? Harry was nice but he seemed to be the exception, not the norm.
Draco had two helpings of lasagna, and felt nicely full for the first time in a while. The meal had been delicious, and he had only made a little mess on himself. Even though the mess wasn't that bad Draco felt self conscious about it. His mother would have yelled at him if she saw his face right now but Remus didn't seem to mind. Draco had eaten every bite of food put on his plate, and he did his best to eat neatly because that was how he was taught.
"I heard you met a new friend today, son. Harry Potter was nice to you? That is good to hear. Your mother and I talked it over and I think you should be allowed to see Harry as often as you can. What do you think of that, Draco?" He asked.
Harry ran up to his room to read Draco's letter. He flopped onto his bed on his stomach, and wiggled his feet in the air as he read. He was very excited about the part that said that they could be friends still, and that maybe they could play together more. Uncle Remus had told him that it would be up to Draco's parents how often the boy was over, but he was hoping it was lots.
Draco made a face at being told he looked like his father. It wasn't a rude face or disrespectful, but clearly the fact that he looked like his father bothered him.
"Ooooh! I would love to make potions with you sometime! When you have more things to make them with that is, and if I can visit again. And riding a broom would be an awesome thing to learn too! Maybe I could go with you to learn to fly sometime too.” Draco said all of this in a hurry, he was too excited to speak slowly.
Remus smiled at Draco. "I had guessed that you might be a Malfoy. You look a bit like your father. I think that it's wonderful that you're Harry's friend, and you most certainly are not a burden. You'll always be welcome in our home, Draco. No matter what." He didn't much care for Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, but their son seemed to just be a lonely little boy who needed a good friend. If Harry had picked him, there was nothing to do but make sure that Draco became part of their circle of friends.
"I am not scared of you Harry, but I am sorry that you have had to go through all this and that people don't always treat you nice because of it. I am not sad for you exactly, but I wish you hadn't been bit because you said it makes others scared of you. But I am not scared and I still want to be your friend. I don't know much about werewolves though, so I am a little curious. But I don't want to make you feel bad either if I ask the wrong question. So how about you can just tell me whatever it is you want about being a werewolf as we get to be better friends? Does that sound like a plan? I am glad that you found Remus though, he seems great and I can tell he really cares about you which is good." Draco finished speaking, pulled away from Harry, and gave him a smile.
"Well I am glad you have your Uncle Remus then, he sounds like a really good person. I think if we don't find Mother before we get back to your place, I would like to meet him. But Mother isn't always nice to people, neither is Father...so there is a chance your Uncle won't want to meet me. Apparently my parents are well known..."
Draco Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy Manor, among other things, grew up within the dark manor alone for most of his life. Narcissa, the woman he knew merely as Mother, seemed unable to love him or care for him. Narcissa rarely held him after he became potty trained, so Draco didn't remember the feeling of a mother's embrace anymore. He had seen some of his parents' friends hug their children, but Draco wasn't sure the reason for it. Was that just normal behavior? Or was it abnormal and that's why his parents didn't hug him? Narcissa would sometimes give him a hug, but only if Draco was seriously upset and refused to stop crying. Draco spent most of his days alone in his room, playing by himself amidst a mountain of toys. His toys made the few kids who visited envious for some reason. Yet when Draco watched those kids get love from their parents, it was he who was envious.
Harry spent the evening working on his letters and writing Draco a new letter. He talked about how he hadn't got caught about his snake, or at least he thought he hadn't, and he told Draco about all the things they could play the next time that they were together. Uncle Remus usually let him play anywhere in Diagon Alley, because there were always adults around who adored him. He often got free ice creams from Florean Fortescue, and thought that maybe Draco could get one too.
Narcissa went upstairs to her room and wrote Remus back, without saying anything else to Lucius who was still at work.
Draco's face lit up at Harry's mention of a book about snakes. "Oooh! That snake book sounds awesome! Though shedding your skin doesn't sound like fun." Draco made a face at that, the idea disconcerted him a little especially the eyes part. "Maybe we could look through your snake book together sometime?" Draco asked hopefully, he liked Harry's snake and was curious to learn more about them in general. Harry smiled faintly, relaxing a little as Draco giggled at his story and asked about reading his book. "Yeah, we can! I like the pictures and learning about snakes."
So Harry was sitting at his desk, thinking about what he would write to his first crush, at the first point where he should have realized that he had it. He'd tried to start a few times, crossing things out when they didn't feel right. He had decided to write his crushes letters. He was good at writing letters. He was pretty sure that writing his crushes essays about how he'd felt would not have worked out for him.
!” Harry bellows, causing Malfoy to splutter wordlessly at him, his blush spreading right up to his delicately rounded ears.
Malfoy’s eyes are gleaming now, and slowly, almost involuntarily, he bites his lip and lets his gaze rake down over him. “Well, since I’m asking so nicely...?” Malfoy trails off, their gazes back on the room.
“Quick, spell ‘birthday’,” he deadpans, and bites his upper lip to hide his grin when Scorpius looks mystified.
There’s the sound of ripping paper as Draco scrambles up, eyes narrowed jaw clenched, hair still wildly mussed from their frantic bout of snogging earlier. He looks around wildly until he notes that there is indeed a mermaid pressed up against one of the panes of glass, her ridiculously flashy, pink and mauve tail glistening in the dim lights as she preens at Harry, her red hair by itself enough to piss Draco off if not for the fact that despite the odd, pointy features merpeople were known for, she was rather pretty.
“I dressed myself,” he says proudly and Draco can only produce croaked sounds of horror for the next several seconds.
Harry runs a frantic hand through his still wet hair, rolling his eyes. “I don’t give a flying fuck about the bastard, and you know it,” he says flatly. “I can’t risk putting Draco through any kind of stress at this point. Just make sure they get back to that Manor of theirs by tonight and get them to lower the wards. I’ll drop in tomorrow and ask them to owl their fucking son. Draco doesn’t have to know about any of this.”
Harry doesn’t answer at once and so Draco is forced to look back at him. He’s still watching Draco, his gaze soft and unwavering on Draco’s face.
thing. I can’t read some of the bigger books. Father says I’m not old enough. He says they have longer words than I’m used to reading. But I don’t know if I believe him. You see, I think they have a lot of scary details about the war you won and he’s worried I’ll have nightmares.”
Potter laughs softly, rolling onto his side and propping his head up in one hand. “Unintentional, but I don’t have it in me to apologise for it now,” he says softly, running his hand over Draco’s stomach once more, expression soft and stupidly sappy.
And then Tristan pulls Draco closer with an arm around his waist, leans down and kisses him slowly, deeply – the kind of kiss you share with someone you’re comfortable and familiar with; the kind of kiss that hinted strongly at what they might get up to once they’re alone later in the night.
Potter laughs, a warm, deep sound that makes Draco feel slightly dizzy. “Yeah, it’s not Kreacher’s fault. I mainly keep to my room, the upstairs living room and the kitchen. Those are the only rooms I ask him to clean. My own place is in a Muggle area, and it didn’t feel safe to stay there anymore after— I only moved in here after I was bitten,” he finishes casually, and Draco twitches slightly at the blasé way Potter says it.
want to spend my birthday watching you both suck face.” Harry shoves his tongue further into Draco’s mouth, his hands discreetly slipping under his shirt. “
“Harry,” he whispers, cradling Harry’s head as it descends onto his shoulder, Harry’s quiet, heart-wrenching sobs moist and hot against Draco’s neck. “No. Harry,
“You want my arse?” Draco murmurs, twisting his hand right underneath the glans, rucking up his foreskin and bunching it roughly under his fist. “You want me to fuck your cock? Ride it till you come inside me?”
There’s an answer in the form of a vague, noncommittal hum, and when Harry waits in expectant silence, Draco sighs. “I didn’t...feel like spending Christmas back in that house,” he admits softly. “I didn’t even think I’d be celebrating Christmas this year, to be honest.”
Draco laughs quietly. “The whole damn castle smells like Christmas, Potter,” he says, one hand running through Harry’s hair the way they both liked, dextrous fingers gently combing out the tangles. Harry makes a low, gurgling sound and burrows deeper into him. Then, slightly wryly, “Don’t think I’m not onto your pet ginger and his bushy girlfriend, Potter. I know they’ve only stayed back here to make sure I don’t drown you in the eggnog or something.”
“In a minute,” Potter replies blandly. And then his other hand descends between Draco’s legs, closing around the uncomfortable bulge of his straining cock, and massaging it with a rolling tug.
strong womb,” Granger says approvingly, pointing around the shape of the baby at something neither he nor Potter seem to be able to discern. “Discontinuation of the suppressant clearly helped. Excellent maturation.” Unaware of their bewilderment, she addresses them jointly, “And I really was serious about the magical dependency. Veela genes or not, Draco’s magic
say if they saw you like this, hmm? If they saw what a fucking whore you are for my cock in your mouth?”
Pulling out of reach, Malfoy strides forward, critically eyeing the long sofa upholstered in silver and blue before neatly sitting down, clasping his hands in his lap and studiously ignoring Harry as he pulls out his shrunken trunk and places it out of the way next to the sofa before tapping it with his wand to expand it back to full size.
Finally, “How are you?” Draco opts to ask in reply. “How did this month’s transformation go?” he adds boldly.
But Harry’s barely listening; he’s eased Malfoy’s arsehole open with both thumbs, nosed his way down the crack, and shoved his tongue into the waiting opening as far down as he can get it.
When he steals a quick peek, Malfoy is staring at him with his mouth hanging open, looking completely gobsmacked. “
“It’s not the same thing!” Draco exclaims incredulously. “You shouldn’t be taking up a job you don’t want for someone
Jerking in startlement more than pleasure, Draco scrabbles to clutch Harry’s hair again, guiding his head in a slow bob down his length, rasping out hot, breathless gasps. Harry’s hands never stop moving over him, running over his stomach and chest and sides and nipples, the tip of his tongue fitted into the slit, his lips tight around Draco’s cock.
Harry bent over, his pyjama bottoms riding low enough for Draco to see the top of his crack, and with a tug produced Draco’s white shirt, now covered in dust bunnies and chunks of dried ferret food.
Harry can feel Malfoy’s breath against his cock, quick and warm, as it huffs over his shaft. Malfoy’s thumb lazily traces the ridge under the head, before pressing in an unhurried slide down the bulging vein, all the way to his balls. “Wow,” Malfoy whispers suddenly, lapping away a little bead of moisture that leaks out, wrapping his hand around and drawing the folds of his foreskin down. “Consider me impressed, Potter.”
She very young, barely just a couple of years older than Potter and he are, and Draco can make out, despite the grainy, faded quality of the photo, that she’s extremely pretty. She’s in a wedding gown, effortlessly elegant, red hair up in a chignon, stray tendrils framing her heart shaped face. She’s holding a simple little bouquet of red and white roses and looks positively euphoric as she smiles at the camera, gaze dipping bashfully.
“Thanks,” Harry mumbles sheepishly, as Malfoy holds out one mug and then nods at the armchair, inviting Harry to sit down. Harry accepts the mug and watches Draco pull out the rickety chair at the desk, steadying it before sitting down. “Sit here,” Harry says quickly, moving out of the way and pointing at the armchair.
“Harry!” Draco barely has to raise his voice to call out before Harry is ambling in hurriedly, scooping up a very naked, wet Scorpius over one shoulder – Scorpius shrieking happily and beating his small fists against Harry’s back – and extending his other arm to take Lyra. “You’ll take them both?” Draco asks, carefully tucking their daughter into the crook of Harry’s free arm. “Thanks, love, I’ll just be five minutes in the shower.”
The second landing was even rougher – his ankle twisted, broke, and Harry’s legs buckled, his hands tightening on his children.
Harry checks his watch with a sigh, pacing restlessly, stomach in painful knots. “Eleven thirty. But of
Draco does not swing by Grimmauld Place after work like he has been for the last couple of weeks; he does not feel as daring as he had the previous month, not after doing what Harry had explicitly forbidden him to do.
Another bunch of people exit the club, this time pausing right at the mouth of the alley, lighting up cigarettes and talking loudly among themselves. Harry doesn’t even bother pausing in his act of taking Malfoy apart completely as Malfoy bites down into one arm to stifle his moans, shuddering under Harry’s ruthless mouth and groping hands.
Potter doesn’t need further encouragement, apparently, because with a groan of relief he draws his cock out and fucks back into Draco, free hand cradling Draco’s arse he saws in and out of him on a wild, rather uncontrolled rhythm. Draco is screaming his throat out, scrabbling at and raking his hands down Potter’s back, pressing his heels into Potter’s tailbone and savagely nipping at his clammy throat, Potter’s hips pistoning away frantically, crashing roughly into Draco’s groin.
“That’s not how you were supposed to say it,” Draco says irritably, his hands already in Harry’s hair, teasing the loose curls open. “You aren’t supposed to say it during an
There are vases full of thick, colourful bunches of luscious, fresh flowers everywhere; on both nightstands, on the desk, on the little glass-topped table near the chaise, and on the mahogany vanity against the wall across from the bed, there’s a wide, silver bowl heaped with a variety of brightly wrapped Honeydukes sweets. The windows are wide open and the room is bright, airy, sweet smelling and flooded with sunlight.
“I could smell you when you Apparated into the yard,” he admits sheepishly, when he notes Draco’s surprise. “And I can’t find Kreacher anyway, so...”
Malfoy’s hair has grown rapidly in the few months since he’s stopped his suppressant and hangs past his shoulder blades in a shiny sheet. His cheeks are flushed from the heat, despite the chill of the full strength Cooling Charms he has up, and he’s wearing just a pair of flimsy, cotton pyjama bottoms. Harry’s gaze rakes up over his pale, half-naked form, hungrily taking in the pearlescent sheen of his skin, the jut of his collarbones, the way his neck arches gracefully as he tips his head back and gathers his hair with his thumbs, bringing it over one straight shoulder and leaning further back. He doesn’t look away even when Malfoy catches him staring and smirks knowingly.
“No, but still,” Draco mumbles. “You could’ve done something nicer. After the extravagant display you planned for my birthday, I mean it’s the le—”
And as Harry watched, Malfoy took his son by the hand and led him off to one side of the clearing, talking softly.
“Okay,” said James, wiping his eyes with the heels of his hands. Harry’s heart broke all over again at the innocent trust his children had in him.
Harry grins, Summoning his own little duffle bag and pulling out his towel. “Give Luna my love,” he says, wiping his messy face. “Haven’t caught up with her in ages. Tell her to drop by sometime if she likes.”
Harry let his head thump back onto the wall with a low moan. “Still have the lube?” He didn’t get an answer. “Malfoy?”
“I know,” Draco said tightly, sulky displeasure clear in his voice; he scowled at the teasing grin he got for that.
will be brewing you your monthly potions henceforth – privately.” Draco smiles now, earnestly and with promise. “I’ll sort out your paperwork for you, no worries. And I’ll be in touch soon.” He turns to leave, Potter still sitting there with his mouth hanging open, before pausing to turn back again, suddenly uncertain. “Wait, I’m sorry; I steamrolled my way into this. Are you all right with this? With me doing this for you?”
Just as Harry started to scribble out something, he wasn’t sure what, Malfoy said quietly, “Won’t Weasely and Granger mind?”
But Draco doesn’t say anything. He’s just looking at me, right at me, gaze unwavering, and seems to be weighing something. This by itself is uncharacteristic as fuck. Draco almost never thinks before he talks.
“I thought you wanted to...try to get along with me?” Draco says slowly, as he takes a few steps towards him.
“Right, and as it turns out,” Draco can feel the colour flood his own cheeks but continues anyway, “apparently all I had to do was
Draco doesn’t answer. He’s looking at me now and I’m tempted to look around for a Dementor because I am cold to the bone and feel like all the happiness has been sucked out from around me. The hopeful elation that had sprung up just from talking to Draco for a minute has just vanished, and I feel a gloom unmatched to anything I have experienced in the past three months settle over me. Suddenly, I just want to go home and be alone. Simon’s hand feels clammy and unpleasant in mine.
Draco lifts up onto one elbow, forcing himself to stay expressionless. “What like during Auror training?”
Drool leaks out the corners of his mouth, dripping off his jaw and down his neck. Potter tastes like soap and salt, his precome is bitter and sharp, and the head of his cock chokes Draco as he thrusts into his throat with a growl, holding his head in place with a handful of hair.
“You’re not allowed to fly during your third trimester, okay?” Potter says absently, pushing his glasses up his nose and turning a page before lifting Draco’s foot off his cock.
“Oh, that old man had issues,” Draco dismisses, cleaving out large slices. “He’d cursed it so only his daughter could open it. And
Something snaps inside my head. “Will you shut your face?” I bite out, not looking at him. “Seriously, just
Ginny finally appeared, holding two more trunks in the size of books and a Tesco bag in her other hand, bulging with things for the kids. Her freckles were stark against her white face as she silently handed Harry the trunks and drew her wand.
“Yes, okay, be sure to mop those up,” Draco replies coldly, wanting intensely to tear sharp talons across the man’s stupid, swollen face.
?” Harry stares at him for a moment before jumping to his feet, swaying for a second as his head spins.
Harry could feel Malfoy trembling under him – or was it Harry himself who was trembling? Malfoy was moaning roughly, guttural sounds of satisfaction as he bit down on Harry’s lower lip and stretched it out, letting it go and then nipping it again. He opened his mouth as Harry sunk his tongue back in, panting roughly every time Harry gave him a second to breathe.
“Er...” Harry stares in utter bewilderment at the book before looking up at Malfoy, waiting for an explanation. “Um, I don’t want to read about who Morgana fucked, Malfoy,” he says lamely, when Malfoy just stares back impassively.
“This is Prada!” shrieked Draco, waving the waistcoat at him before abruptly elbowing him aside and sticking his head behind the fridge.
“In all probability,” Ron agrees, nodding and grinning as he lifts his mug to Harry. “So, you want to put out an ad to help you find the arse that best fits your cock?”
And it was after that next time that Draco, being pressed up against the wall in the alley behind the restaurant they’d dined in, had asked, between furious, wet kisses, to see Potter’s tattoo. Potter had grinned and pulled his neatly tucked shirt out of his crisp trousers, pulling it off over his head and turning to show Draco the bold black lines of the outline that stretched across Potter’s back. The stag’s head, situated between his sharp shoulder blades, was tilted back proudly and its antlers stretched all the way up to his shoulders. On the stag’s head was a wreath of lilies. There was no colour or anything flashy about it whatsoever, but Draco was left breathless as he ran his fingertips over the lines of the tattoo.
Utterly beyond words, Draco flung the torn robes aside violently and marched away, heading straight for the bathroom and slamming the door. As he undressed and tried to decide if he ought to have an hour long hot shower or simply treat himself to a proper bubble bath, he heard Harry come into the bedroom, talking softly; there was a familiar creak of bedsprings and some squeaky chittering, and a second later Draco realised Harry was gently chiding Moody—in their bed.
“It’s half past noon,” Draco points out, heaving Lyra higher up his flank and meandering over to the coffee pot. “You could’ve woken me up.”
Eight fucking days spent in this forest looking for him, tracing him, leaving his scent around as bait, barely sleeping for how hyper-alert he had to be – and Harry was taken by surprise when he’d taken a quick moment to pull his dick out and take a fucking piss.
He doesn’t hold a candle to Draco, though. The very thought of it makes me snort. Simon is attractive in a way that when you look at him, you give him an appreciative once over. Draco is attractive in a way that once you look at him, it takes physical effort to look away.
There’s a soft snigger against his throat but it’s immediately followed by a slow, hard suckle, Potter slurping his way down Draco’s neck as if determined to leave as many marks as possible. Draco can’t bring himself to complain and so tilts his head as far back as he can on Potter’s downy pillow, moaning softly with each biting lap, staying pliant and soft but for the light shivers zinging up his spine.
“There used to be this disgusting collection of elf-skulls that I got rid of the second I moved in,” Harry says with a lame chuckle, Malfoy merely glancing at the empty pedestals Harry indicates to. Harry sighs, firming his grip on the trunk, and trudges on in silence.
There resulting click is deafening in the still, echoing silence and for a second or two, Draco just stands there, his hand on the doorknob.
of those matters.” He quirks another smile at Harry before going on, “I think I’ll reconsider my decision to move in here for the time being. And to answer your earlier question, Mother,” he blushes slightly as he steadily meets his mother’s gaze, “I’m...happy.” He looks back at Harry with bright eyes and Harry’s heart swells to five times its size. “I think we both are.”
He tugs me back up by my hair and kisses me again, clumsily mashing our mouths together and sucking. I’m helpless as I kiss him back, helpless as I reach down to cup his perfect little arse and squeeze, making him kiss me even harder.
“So, Malfoy,” she says, voice rather high, “How are we doing? Any new symptoms you want me to make note of or address? Excessive fatigue? Backache? Muscle cramps? Heartburn? Constipation?”
Potter hasn’t cast one though, Draco notices. He sits there and watches his friends muck about in the snow and spontaneously have their Patronuses race each other but he doesn’t join in. He’s sitting quietly, Potter, directly opposite Draco, and is watching with a happy, modest sort of pride as nearly all their classmates guide their respective conjured Patronuses around the courtyard.
“Fuck.” He stumbles back as I force my way in with a grin. “Why are you using my front door, you bellend?”
When Harry had come home one day with a tiny tattoo of the outline of a ferret on his left flank, Draco had nearly carved it out with a knife. He’d been with Harry long enough at that point to know about his love for tattoos and his random decisions to get inked with things that were meaningful to him. Over the course of their relationship, Harry had gotten so many tattoos that eventually accepting the little ferret hadn’t been a big deal for Draco.
Looking across the clearing, he saw Malfoy nonchalantly siphon dirt off his cloak with his wand. Eh, I’d probably let the dementors take this one, Harry thought.
Lip curling, Draco rolls them over before sitting up and flipping Potter onto his front. Potter yelps and flails wildly for a moment before lifting up onto his elbows and looking over his shoulder in shock.
“None of the Weasleys are ever going to harm you, Malfoy,” Harry says frowning as he rolls his eyes.
And then with a gulp that sounds like he’s un-sticking his throat, Malfoy manages to speak. “This is the moment you pick to say it?” he asks weakly and an enormous balloon of warm, undiluted happiness bursts inside Harry’s chest, flooding him with such intense joy that he’s leaned in and kissed Malfoy square on the mouth before he can reconsider the sudden raging need to, and when he feels Malfoy lean into it after a soft squeak of mortification, he cups his cheek and kisses him harder.
“Fuck!” Draco thrashes, high keens ringing around the room, “I’ll—I’ll come!” he threatens loudly, “I’ll fucking come, you idiot!”
“It’s the Finals tomorrow,” Harry pulled away and panted out of the blue. Draco blinked slowly, wet lips parted.
Draco snorts, lacing his fingers through Harry’s. “It definitely has a bigger head than mine does, sure.” He squeezes lightly. “I bet mine has a nicer arse, though.”
He’s hard; there’s a tiny wet spot in his grey underwear. I’m very pleased, although I don’t luxuriate in the feeling, and proceed to quickly roll his briefs off too. His cock springs free, pink and slender and damp, and I’m helpless as I let out a soft moan, crawling up between his legs to bury my face in the wiry blond hair at his crotch, inhaling the scent of his musk, licking and placing sloppy kisses on the base of his cock.
“Is it why you had to go off your suppressant?” she asks in a hushed voice, leaning forward to cup Malfoy’s face, “Because you’re with child? You’re so
Harry grins, pursing his lips and narrowing his eyes as though keenly considering what Malfoy’d said. “
“Then stop going there,” she tells him, not looking the least bit sympathetic. “You only go there because the mirrors are bigger.”
What Draco wants is to feel that burning, jealous hatred that had fuelled him through most of his childhood and young adulthood. He wants to peacefully hate Potter and not have Potter ruining everything by being careful and sweet with him. He wants to feel something more than the scorching, merciless shame and embarrassment that fill him every time he looks at Potter and remembers what he symbolises: peace, and love, and courage and freedom.
“’s my mum,” Potter says suddenly, after a long pause, his voice gravelly. Draco leans in, determinedly not paying attention to the horde of butterflies that gather in his belly when their shoulders brush, and looks at the woman in the photo Potter’s thumb swipes across.
“You—you were not,” Draco puts the ladle down – he doesn’t know if he can hold anything at this point without dropping it.
Malfoy keens softly, grinding into Harry’s hand, gasping with each little mark he’s bitten, crying out sharply when Harry’s mouth closes eagerly around one, tightly peaked nipple. He’s wracked with shudders then, his body undulating under Harry’s relentless mouth, his hands pushing and pulling at Harry’s head all at once. When Harry lifts off the swollen bud, Malfoy sobs softly, only to cry out again when Harry simply moves over to nibble at the other one.
trying, actually,” Potter says taking another step closer, staring intently at Draco. “You’re trying very hard and your focus is sharp as fuck.”
It’s a bit sloppy. The angle is all wrong and I’m weirdly short of breath and keep panting in his face. Still, he kisses me back, sweetly and steadily, and when I pull away to draw in some air, he smiles happily, looking so fucking perfect.
!” he repeats, grabbing her around the neck and roughly messing up her short, sweat-clumped red hair. Ginny shrieks and shoves her elbow into his chest, following it up with a head-butt that sends Harry flying back onto his bum purely out of surprise. “Gerrof!” he laughs breathlessly, struggling as she straddles his chest and tries to force feed him handfuls of moist grass that she plucks up with both hands.
Harry stared at the house. The back door was ajar and the place seemed eerily still and quiet. Half of him wanted to charge in there. The other part of him absolutely dreaded the thought of going in and finding Ginny’s unresponsive body.
Clicking his tongue irritably at Harry’s amused chuckling, Draco yanked him forward by the collar to snog him some more. Harry responded at once, curling his arms around Draco and holding him tight enough that his ribs protested, their mouths moving furiously together, wet and noisy. Draco began a gentle rut, grinding his stirring cock against Harry’s groin until there was a soft moan in response and one hand came down to roughly squeeze Draco’s right arse cheek.
It’s fucking weird without him in my life, I’ll admit that much. I keep telling myself to try and imagine what it was like right after the War; when he and I hadn’t pulled our heads out of our arses and become friends yet. It’s...
Why, my brain tells me to ask. “How?” I ask instead, because I am genuinely curious as to how he’d done it without getting arrested.

“Nah, it’s all good,” I interrupt quickly. “Just sitting back and vetting the guy, y’know? And on Monday I’ll probably go check if he has any records against him.”
futile date that would end in mediocre, passionless sex that left him feeling slightly nauseous. Developing a drinking problem is what he should focus on. Fuck soulmates – especially his own.
Potter turns away with a sigh, rubbing his face with both hands and pushing his hair back. “I...didn’t mean for us to...like that, alright?” he says without looking at him.
for his birthday and Draco doesn’t know what the appropriate reaction to this revelation is except that it probably involves a lot of hysterical screaming.
“Order yourself one of these fancy coffees, Potter,” Draco says gently. “Breathe in some fresh air; look around at...other human beings. Just
He looks incredibly, effortlessly handsome and Draco, absurdly enough, suddenly feels self-conscious and unkempt. He’d thrown on his flannel pyjamas of
.” He frowns as he falls back into his seat and puts his feet back up on my table. “It’s got some sort of archaic Protective Charm set into the tourmaline, and I thought why not, considering Weasley is probably the worst person to have watching your back out there.” He snorts and then suddenly drops his gaze to examine his fingernails in a rather exaggerated show of nonchalance. “And it matches your stupid eyes,” he adds with a small frown.
“I bought you new dress robes; they’re upstairs in your wardrobe,” Potter blurts out, looking mulish as Draco throws him a rather nasty glare. “I didn’t pick them out, so you don’t have to start about my appalling fashion sense or something,” he snaps before Draco can open his mouth. “The assistant at the store did and she said they’re currently...‘in’,” Potter says, making air-quotes.
Nothing sounds worse. “I promised Hermione,” I say vaguely. “I’m really sorry. I’ll owl you later, okay?”
He’s mostly useless after that, leaning heavily against Harry with his clingy trousers around his thighs, while Harry rights his own clothes, then rights
Harry moans roughly, thrusting madly as he comes, fucking his come into Draco with rough, jarring strokes that knock the breath out of him.
“What is it, Lily?” Draco asks softly, walking over and picking her up. She screeches hysterically at once, kicking at Draco’s chest and pounding her tiny fists into his throat as he walks over to the polished rocking chair by the window, Summoning the bottle of warm milk from the dresser as he sits down. “You’re
He’s bracing himself for Potter to look sad if not angry but Potter just shrugs one shoulder, mouth curling up on one side as he pushes his scrambled eggs around his plate. “I mean, sure,” he says carelessly. “I loved Quidditch right from the very first time I learnt how to play. It’s one of the few things I was naturally good at,” he adds, chuckling when Draco narrows his eyes playfully at him across the table.
Harry’s eyes shone with happiness as his gaze wandered down to Draco’s hand again. “Wouldn’t be the first time you learned to love someone you hated.”
to be paid attention to. Harry didn’t regret it yet, absolutely not. Far from it he, in fact, was rather obsessed with it now, and by extension, also a tad bit obsessed with
many, though, were there?” He sounds anxious but there’s a trace of petulance about the way he speaks. I half expect him to stick his lower lip out in a pout.
“I’m always glowing, I’m a Veela,” Malfoy replies arrogantly, putting his feet up and shoving a cushion behind his back.
She straightens up. “Yes, his Healer’s saying it might be some sort of infection but he’s asked two others to look in on it and they are unable to figure out what those things
“Isn’t there, perhaps, a parlour, or a living room, I could wait in?” Draco asks slightly hopelessly. The elf glares at him until Draco ambles down the stairs with a sigh.
He started when the phone on his bedside table started to ring, a soft beeping in contrast to the belligerent shrieking from the line in the living room. Harry reached out to the cordless receiver, his stomach fluttering excitedly for some absurd reason, and pressed the button to answer it.
Harry finally shuffled out of the bedroom, toothbrush in his mouth, toothpaste on the corners of his lips and one smear on his chin. His glasses were crooked on his nose and he was squinting against the bright yellow of the sunlight pouring into the living room. His hair was absolutely beyond help.
Harry looked up and around again. The sky seemed a clear, innocent blue. “It doesn’t look like rain.”
“Are you talking about one of those...magi-scanners that just checks your magical signature before—” Hermione scans the parchment again, “—before spitting out one of these?”
Clearing his throat, Harry raises his fist and knocks on the door to his left, holding his breath, one hand closing around his wand in his coat pocket.
One shoulder is lifted in an elegant shrug as Malfoy lifts his tumbler for another sip. “Everyone’s always asking you to bring somebody, or to find somebody or...” he trails off, rolling his eyes, not noticing Harry's surprised stare, “It doesn’t feel much like a party after a point when they’re all asking you if there’s someone worth mentioning in your life and you’re wondering how to tell them that the bloke you slept with last night not only left while you were still asleep but also stole all your soap.”
, Harry. You—you’re still saving more lives than half the bloody Auror force combined. Sometimes—some of them you...can’t save.” Harry’s shoulders start to shake again and Draco tightens his arms around him, words bubbling up unchecked. “You
He also ignores the steadily tightening ball of pain in his chest that was threatening to make him buckle at the knee.
Draco turns his back to the bar, resting his elbows on it, and looks at me with a secretive little smirk. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
She leaped off his lap with an indignant chirp and scurried away haughtily and before Harry could call out and coax her back, the goddamn phone rang again.
Tiddly and flushed with an odd sense of success, Draco feels himself slumping forward, landing on Potter’s sweaty back before rolling off of him and with a grunt. Potter is heaving beside him and it’s only after he hears that does Draco register his own whimpering.
“Hopefully not long...” Harry murmurs sheepishly, wincing and stroking Malfoy’s hip. “It won’t happen again, not unless we...during the full moon; sometimes not even then. I read about this way back when I’d just been infected – I didn’t even really
When Harry’s fingers moved up the inside of his thigh, Malfoy’s breath left him in a shuddering exhale and there was a soft
Draco had no sense of time or place as they kissed; all he was aware of was Harry, Harry’s arms around him, Harry’s mouth under his—and that diamond ring on his finger. They swayed where they stood, caressing each other as they kissed, Draco’s heart beating so furiously fast and hard that he worried for a second that maybe he was going to need medical attention. But as he ran his hands down Harry’s shoulders and arms and then pressed them into Harry’s chest, he could feel his heart racing too.
“What, like, you don’t think he’s fit or something?” Ron asks, still looking incredibly shocked. “How can
“Fuck! Potter, fuck!” Malfoy sounds almost panicked as Harry’s finger finds his arsehole, but the way he presses back into his hand doesn’t leave room for doubt or pause.
want you there too,” Harry added hurriedly. “I—I think Hermione knew that, which is why she...asked me to...ask you to...”
“Fucking tosser,” Ron mutters irritably as Malfoy saunters away, still chuckling. Harry discreetly grinds into the front of his pants, Malfoy’s pink cheeks and shiny eyes still dancing before him. “Oi, so are you meeting the cat-bloke again?”
He froze, wondering if the student was in pain and too weak to call out properly for help and whether he ought to go wake Pomfrey.
,” Harry beseeches, continuing to paint careful strokes with his tongue over Malfoy’s mangled, horribly painful looking nape.
Harry stares blankly down at the book, the cover a rich maroon with gold lettering, the pages creamy and stiff between his fingers as he flips a few. “Thank you,” he says hoarsely, nodding feverishly. “
“For staring at them or giving them to me in the first place?” Malfoy’s voice, soft in Harry’s ear, held a definite hint of a smirk to it.
“Yes, well, that’s all I meant,” Draco says at once, shovelling in forkfuls of bacon and cheese omelette, cheeks bulging by the time he stops for a sip of pumpkin juice. When he finally does look up, Potter is chewing slowly with a rather faraway look on his face. “Potter?”
Malfoy gasped throatily as he was breached, jerking so violently that Harry nearly fell right off him. His hands pressed into Harry’s back as he rasped out a garbled bunch of words that Harry literally could not hear through the rushing in his own ears.
From outside he heard the soft gasps of Albus and Lily and knew they felt the swooping sensation of the spell. But no other human being revealed themselves.
“I guess,” he finally says, shrugging. “I suppose a lot of events will be celebrated like that now – first winter after the War, first Christmas, first spring.”
on the dance floor, I'm gr—” He breaks off on a strange, gulping sound, cheeks going from pink to crimson as he clamps his mouth shut and takes a huge swig of beer.
“You—Kreacher mentioned you requested he bring you your breakfast in here so...” Potter scratches his shaggy head a moment, “I thought if you’re unwell, I’d call ‘Mione over or—”
Potter looks exasperated. “I’m only asking to know if it’s a powerful enough memory,” he says. “I had to switch a few memories before one worked.”
“Then don’t,” I say dismissively, looking not at him but somewhere just above his head – because I can’t, I just
“What; this is something that you ought to be shouting from the rooftops, Potter,” Malfoy says, a tad impatiently. “You don’t hide something like that. So, how good are you anyway?”
Painful erection momentarily forgotten, Draco just watches him, squirming when the baby kicks, his hands still lying next to his head where Potter had briefly pinned them down. He feels, absurdly enough, like he’s intruding on an extremely private moment; it’s a sight he isn’t sure how to deal with, Potter with his worshipful gaze and touch.
It didn’t take very long for Harry to locate the bedding and transfigure them a bit to make a decent little bed for the children to sleep on. He had the boys take their shoes off but leave their socks on and pull on an additional jumper each. As they both crawled into bed, he located a bag of diapers and changed Lily before bundling her up in additional warm clothing too.
Gritting his teeth and holding back a strangled sound of pleasure, Draco picks up the pace. Potter is meeting him thrust for thrust now, his crease turning wetter from the precome Draco leaks into it. There’s a soft slapping sound and Draco realises that it’s Potter’s cock bouncing against his own belly. He’s not come yet, Potter, and he’s been hard since they were in the alley. The fact that Potter doesn’t complain about this and lets Draco have his way nearly sends him flying apart.
Harry laughed softly, pulling his boxers off completely. “I saw her at the vet when Ron and I took Crookshanks. She’d been found injured and was really rather cute and I couldn’t help it.” Harry smiled at the tightly curled furry at the foot of his bed. “And Ron can’t name things for shit – but we both thought Baguette would be funny.”
Something much larger than your average biscuit toppled out of the folds of the t-shirt and Draco paused, scowling, as he flung the T-shirt aside and made a grab for it. It was a small, black, velvet-covered box and Draco turned it over and over in his hands for a few seconds, frowning down at it.
“Yes,” Draco admits quietly because Potter doesn’t look or sound like he’s mocking Draco for it. When Potter doesn’t reply, Draco looks up to find him staring at Draco like he’s trying to figure him out while waiting for him to continue. “I...wasn’t
He doesn’t have to open his eyes to know that Potter is smirking like an utter arsehole. “Yes, Draco?” he prompts gently, fingers dancing over the inside of Draco’s left thigh, tickling and stroking him through the silk of his trousers.
It’s still early, he realises when he peeks around the thick, velvet curtains, drawing them properly shut so there aren’t any gaps, glancing back at Harry’s sleeping form as he soundlessly pads out of the room.
“Okay...” Harry says bleakly, watching rather helplessly as Malfoy struggles for a moment with the doorknob, the potion bottles clinking quietly against each other in his arms, before he lets himself out and leaves without looking back.
He blinks blearily around his room now, the sunset painting the room ochre yellow through the crack in the curtains, his brand new eagle owl — yet
“Want you so much,” Harry whispers, his cock now properly painful where it’s straining against the front of his boxers, “Going to fuck you so good, Malfoy.”
We move simultaneously but it’s not a hard, messy clash of lips. It’s as though we’ve rehearsed this before. The timing is immaculate, the way our lips slot together is faultless. Kissing Draco still feels like a novelty and I greedily take more, slanting my face against his and kissing him deeply, not pulling away for a long, long time.
I smash my mouth against his, my teeth scraping over his lips still parted on that gasp, and sink my tongue into his mouth, one hand still holding him by the collar, my other hand holding his face in place. With my brain completely turned off, I kiss him so hard that he gasps again, his mouth automatically opening wider under mine, his lips easily slotting with mine.
Ron and I don’t often lie to one another. When we do it’s about whose turn it is to fill out reports and which team we think will win the season. When he’d asked me whether I thought it was a good idea to propose to Hermione two months after the War I hadn’t lied; I’d told him it sounded like a bit of a wild leap and that he ought to give it more time. When he’d asked me again five years after that, I’d offered to go with him to buy a ring to propose with.
Two days after Draco had moved in, Potter had disappeared for about an hour or so and when he’d returned, it was with an obscenely large sack full of Honeydukes candy – boxes and boxes of Cauldron Cakes and chocolate fudge, slabs of nutty, unimaginably succulent chocolate, enormous Chocoballs filled with strawberry mousse and clotted cream, Chocolate Dragon Eggs (each as big as a real dragon egg) filled with caramel and crushed hazelnuts, dozens and dozens of Chocolate Frogs and Peppermint Toads, little yellow and pink cartons of crystallised pineapple, jars of Pink Coconut Ice,  packets of Ice Mice, Fizzing Whizzbees and Glacial Snow Flakes.
Potter gives him a little grin. “I won’t spontaneously turn into a wolf and kill anyone if I miss a dose, Malfoy.”
Absurdly enough, Draco feels his face heat. He feels the blush spreading right down his chest as he sneaks a glance downwards, just in time to see Potter slip two fingers into his own mouth before prodding at Draco’s arsehole with his slick fingertips, licking around them.
There’s a dull, grating sound of wood on flagstones behind Harry and when he whips around, Malfoy is standing there, clutching hard at a chair he’s dragged out for support, grey eyes huge and filled with horrified fury, face whiter than parchment.
Draco’s nostrils flare, his joy vanishing in an instant. “Excuse me?” he interrupts icily, voice barely heard. “Care to take that back?”
The Invisibility Cloak came away to reveal the tiny figure of Lily crouched on the floor, face wet with tears, hands pressed to her ears. As the Cloak fell onto the floor in a puddle next to her, she squealed in misery and desperately reached for Harry.
” I want to angrily stamp my foot to punctuate the question but Hermione is looking at me with an expression that’s part quizzical and part careful consideration and I quickly drop it. “I mean, whatever, I don’t care... I just—”
Potter’s expression lightens again, his lips twitching in amusement. “But since you’re not afraid of me...?” He suddenly grins. “Unless you’re suggesting that
Draco doesn’t know whether it’s all the near incessant necking, or whether Harry had genuinely started to feel better after having started on Draco’s Wolfsbane, but he’d definitely noticed a very positive change in Harry in the two or so weeks that they’d been...
“Try not to instigate me on a full moon night, please?” Harry requests exasperatedly. Malfoy snorts and shifts against him, both of them hissing at the sharp tug between them.
The water’s too hot as it sluices down his body; yet he doesn’t move or make to adjust the temperature any. He stands there, head bowed against the jets, eyes shut, hair hanging into his face, his palms braced against the tiles, shoulders slumped inwards.
Breath catching audibly, Malfoy pulls away a bit, frowning at him. “Do you want this gift or not?” he asks flatly. “Limited-time offer, Potter.”
“Yes, it’s not my father you’re afraid of,” Draco says pointedly, lifting Scorpius off the counter after prying a tiny bottle of very expensive vanilla syrup out of his hands.
Draco doesn’t respond anymore, sitting in still silence for several minutes, his brain feeling sluggish and overworked suddenly as he recalls, in intricate detail, the astonishingly perfect evening they’d had on his birthday. Potter had planned and taken Draco out on a Parisian
“Here, in this dirty, stinky alley?” Harry asks innocently, still rubbing away at Malfoy’s fluttering rim. “Okay,” he says, before Malfoy can answer him, pushing the two fingers into him matter-of-factly, twisting them around until he feels the throbbing little nub of his prostate. “Still cold?” Harry asks sweetly as Malfoy lets out a wail, his spine bowing inwards.
Draco turns to him with a soft huff. “Why are you helping me?” he demands. “Why are you even talking to me?”
,” Harry grits out, straightening up, firming his grip in Malfoy’s hair, and riding him brutally hard, reaching down to pluck ruthlessly at his nipples turn by turn. Malfoy flails, reaching back and clawing at Harry’s hip with a yelled stream of profanities interspersed with long, debauched moans of encouragement.
“That can’t be pleasant,” Harry says amusedly, holding him tighter when he shivers, “Roses have thorns. Imagine getting a hundred thorns embedded in your cock and arse.”
Harry just takes it all in rather blankly, looking down Diagon Alley on his left and Knockturn Alley on his right before turning around on the spot once, feeling completely lost.
Harry had fisted his cock until it was chaffed and throbbed painfully, the foreskin bright red and sore, his balls
“No, I stayed on my suppressant and didn’t tell him,” he admits. “I came close a couple of times though...”
When Hermione asks, with genuine interest, “Harry, how’s Malfoy? Are you both happy?” Ron’s glare intensifies.
“Are vegetables banned on one’s birthday?” Draco retorts dryly, but turns his attention to Lyra, leaving Scorpius to vigorously push his food around, and out of, his plate. “One bite, come on,” he says, gently pressing a spoonful of mushy peas to Lyra’s chocolate smeared mouth.
When he abruptly grabs and squeezes Draco’s arse, roughly yanking the cheeks apart, Draco cries out sharply, falling forward to brace his hands against the wall, sobbing as he reluctantly pulls out, suddenly way too close to the edge.
From down the corridor, comes the sound of Lily’s shrill, furious screeching interspersed with long, throaty wails.
as he leaned back against the wall, hands in his pockets, and Lovegood suddenly pranced over to plant a very wet kiss on Draco’s cheek.
?” Draco laughs, unable to hold it back any longer, face so hot now that he can feel his hair sticking to his sweaty forehead. “Such a
“You shouldn’t have,” Draco mumbles, tugging at the ribbons so they flutter daintily to the table. “I don’t even care about any of my birthdays anymore, really. I don’t need anything more from you, Potter. I’m already way too deeply indebted to you.”
Potter pointedly turns the television on and Granger laughs. “We won’t be long,” he promises sheepishly, looking Draco straight in the eye with a small nod; in the absence of their present company, Draco imagines Potter might’ve squeezed his hand reassuringly or maybe gently stroked his cheek.
“Then why didn’t you?” Draco winds one hand through Harry’s wild mane and tugs, panting lightly as their gazes lock again. “Why haven’t you touched me in so long?”
Draco observes Potter in silence for a long moment, mind whirring. Finally, “I have a better idea, Potter. Go change into something that doesn’t have
“I doubt the general appearance of that place helps, really.” When Harry raised an eyebrow in question, Malfoy added, “Ruddy old castle riddled with curse marks. And that bloody Forest.”
“We’re not asking you to sit at home and wait for it to go away,” Ron says calmly now, looking up at him steadily, hands laced over his stomach as he lounges low in his chair. “We’re asking you to go out –
“I noticed,” he says pointedly, chuckling as Draco whimpers and rides his fingers. “You’re impossibly hot when you come, did you know?”
His orgasm hit with the same jarring force it always did when Harry fucked him. Completely overwhelmed and simply shocked into silence, Draco came with sharp, upward bucks, ropes of come flying onto the flat of his belly and chest, Harry now thrusting wildly, head thrown back and jaw clenched.
“Fucking hair,” I hiss, wiping my nose on the back of one hand, and he laughs harder, bending over in whatever space we have between us, drunkenly wheezing soundlessly. “Shut up,” I grumble and stagger forward, the toes of my boot landing right on his bare foot.
“Stop saying fuck in front of the baby,” he says at once, scratching his toned stomach with his thumb without looking up from the book.
Ginny rolls her eyes but pulls away from me and steps back anyway. “Oh fuck off, Malfoy. Like you don’t cling to him all day like a fucking leech yourself.”
!” Draco wailed, tugging at his hair with both hands. Harry now grabbed the edge of the fridge with both hands and heaved, moving it forward a few inches and craning his neck to peer behind it before heaving again and pulling it forward some more. “Is it there? Is it torn?” asked Draco, crowding up behind him, breathing down his neck.
Malfoy just huffs derisively and fastidiously adjusts his cloak to cover himself more thoroughly. “As if I give a damn,” he mutters, twitching out the hem and draping it over his lap.
“Look, you’ve been saying it for days,” Harry interrupts, “You’ve been asking me to get back out there and get my life back. I can’t possibly go back to work for the DMLE, not even if they ask me to themselves, but I
“Why would Ginny want to poison you?” Harry asks calmly, reaching over to gently buff a knuckle across his soft cheek. Malfoy just stares flatly at him like he’s an imbecile. “Malfoy, she and I dated ten
be coming along so we can ask your friend to examine me just because we fucked a bit rough,” Malfoy snaps in a rush. “You’re just going to have to take my word for it that I’m fine.”
“Astute observational skills,” Draco replies with an eyeroll, one corner of his mouth lifting as Potter, to his surprise, suddenly grins. “No, Potter, it’s not blue. And it doesn’t taste like death either.”
“Never,” I say at once. I dunk another biscuit in my tea. It breaks off and plops to the bottom of my mug. “Perfect.”
“He didn’t mean to, he didn’t mean to!” Harry yelled from inside, appearing a moment later with Draco’s favourite green boxers slung over one shoulder. He ran into the living room and looked around for a mess before running into the kitchen where Draco was standing with bared teeth. “What? What’d he do?” he asked.
upset when Draco left,” she says with a small frown, “but warding him out of his own home was cruel and you know it. I
!” he yells at once, stalking towards him, his voice cracking slightly. But Harry has already pounced.
“I cannot believe I let you talk me into this,” Potter mutters, flinching as one of the servers clad in a bright yellow apron prances up to them and hands them both menus. “Malfoy, I’m serious, I don’t want to be here.”
Draco considers that very carefully, still stroking his hair and nuzzling his temple. Then, very tentatively, “Let me be here with you. Let me come be with you when you...”
“Nothing,” Draco slams his ladle down and glares over at his cat, now settled comfortably against Potter’s chest, “You don’t have to entertain him, Potter, he’ll be fine if he’s just left to himself.”
Draco smirks. “Yes, Potter?” he teases, running the tip of his prick along the insides of his mouth but not licking or sucking.
Ron makes some sort of sound through his mouthful of food and so we wait for him to finish chewing and swallow. Eventually he says, “Has it ever sounded like he’s been in love with the others?” and dips his head to stare at me as though looking over the rim of a pair of invisible glasses.
“Oh, I’m fine.” Malfoy’s voice is nonchalant and slightly high pitched, his cloak swishing about his feet as he comes down, his hand trembling where it’s clenched around the handrail.
Scorpius’ eyes widened. “That was such a silly thing to say, Mr. Potter! I—I didn’t mean to seem ungrateful.”
Harry’s effortless displays of sheer physical strength during sex left Draco, each and every time without fail, breathless and wildly aroused. He’d been on edge for several minutes already and now, with Harry inside him,
against Draco, pink mouth falling open as he exhales on a short huff, grabbing Draco’s hips and pulling them together in a slow grind.
No, I don’t immediately down a whole bottle of Firewhiskey and lie in a drunken stupor for the rest of the night. I get home, undress and settle down in front of the telly with no real intention of actually paying attention to it, and choose to remain sober the entire time. It feels as though I have a stomach full of snakes, twisting and coiling around, stinging me from time to time so I can feel the venom course through me and renew the helpless misery I’m drowned in.
“’m fine,” Malfoy interrupts, twitching as Harry’s teeth move further up to graze against the sensitive little cranny below his ear, sighing as his earlobe is then suckled at. “Should’ve known you’d be like this in bed too.”
“I hate you,” Draco breathes blankly, burying both his hands into the wild mane of ebony again. “You’re such a prick.”
I’m standing here pretending that I didn’t just push his boyfriend off his broom in a fit of utterly
” He nearly threw the glass back onto the bedside table, coming close to knocking the little lamp right off as he hurried to turn it on.
“Wait,” Draco says, halting him by clenching one hand painfully tight in his hair. Potter sucks off his cock and turns his dark, slightly confused gaze up at him. “Open,” Draco says, pressing the tip of his cock against Potter’s lower lip.
Harry pauses on the second floor landing, looking between the flat on his left and the sheet of tarpaulin hanging over the doorway on his right to where another flat should’ve been. There’s loose rubble and several slabs of brick and concrete sticking out from beneath the tarpaulin, the place clearly undergoing repair or remodelling.
“Cast your Patronus,” Draco waves a hand in a vague gesture, “Show me once.” And, mischievously, “Let me bask in the blinding glow of your magnificent, legendary Patronus.”
“Beg me,” Draco breathes against Harry’s briny temple as he starts to sob hoarsely, hips flying up into Draco’s. “Beg me, love, and I’ll give you what you want.”
“I think Draco has a few questions he’d like answered first,” Harry says softly, offering Narcissa a small, tight-lipped smile when she looks at him. She smiles back, delicately wiping her eyes with one knuckle. “Good morning, Mrs. Malfoy.”
is something he can choose, actually. I mean, he does still have to be on Wolfsbane to suppress certain symptoms – that uncontrollable, aggressive rage, insomnia, tremors; there’s a list of those – but his Alpha gene means he can control the wolf in him enough that he doesn’t have to go through the transformations at all.”
“No fever now, I checked,” Harry assures him, cutting open a bag of flour and immediately wrestling Scorpius away when he grabs at it. “Scorp! No, Sc—!” He manages to pry off Scorpius’s small hands, with their incredibly strong grip, from the packet and carefully brings the ingredients to the opposite side of the island. “Stay there,” he says to Scorpius, flinging another oven mitt at him – this one shaped like a frog – and receiving a cheeky grin in return.
There’s an enormous, gnarled, slightly grotesque looking scar on Potter’s left shoulder. Draco doesn’t have to
I slowly turn to meet Ron’s gaze. He looks like he’s made a bold declaration but he has his head tilted in a way that says he wants an official confirmation.
After a moment, he starts moving again, lifting his arms in the air so his shirttails ride up, twisting around in Harry’s grip to press his back to Harry’s chest, gasping softly as Harry’s erection presses into the crease of his arse through denim and leather.
“More,” Draco pants, sharply slapping one hand down onto Potter’s flexing bum and dragging him closer. “More!
, Harry thinks as he stares at the derelict building in front of him, with its grimy windows and filthy, peeling plaster, the front door hanging off one hinge. A wizened old witch with a shock of grey hair around her wrinkled face sits at her window in the ground floor flat, picking at her yellowing teeth with one, deadly looking discoloured nail. A large, grey cat sits on the windowsill before her, scratching its face on one of the dead plants there.
So Draco drops to his knees, ignoring the twinge of pain from his left, half dragging Potter down with him until the idiot has the sense to release Draco’s wrist, and smirks up at him.
in front of the baby!” Draco says hotly, pointing to his stomach. “God, you’re an idiot of elephantine proportions. The baby doesn’t know what ‘fuck’ means!”
“When I first encountered dementors,” Harry said, “I’d feel...ill; for hours. God, the amount of chocolate I ate that year.” Malfoy exhaled through his nose in an approximation of a chuckle. “Lily’s a bit under the weather but the boys have managed to shake off any lingering effects.” When Malfoy still didn’t say anything, Harry said, “What about Scorpius?”
“I’ve missed you too, Mother,” Malfoy murmurs and Lucius shifts his gaze to watch his wife and son, expression still bland. As Harry watches, Draco steps away rather abruptly, Narcissa looking a bit bewildered as she stares around Draco’s midriff, carefully concealed behind his robes.
He didn’t know if there was anything they could do for Ginny in her state. She was a vegetable now, incapable of even holding a wand. But if she was alive – which she
I nod, starting to undo the buttons on my stupid new formal shirt. He sits up, rising onto his knees, and awkwardly edges closer to me so he can help. We’re looking at each other as, together, we slide my shirt off my shoulders. He smooths his hands over the curve of my shoulders, over my biceps and back up again, and then down my chest; he’s mapping out my skin, exploring and touching, like one trying to familiarise themselves with terrain they’ve always been curious about. When he gets to my midriff, he pulls my shirt out from where it’s tucked into my trousers, and gently pushes my shirt off, with a lot more care than I’d shown as I’d undressed him. He’s looking at me yearningly, eyes soft, mouth softer.
I think about it in flashes, every now and then, all day, as we watch TV, play Exploding Snap and kiss like seventh years. I think about it as I spread him out in front of the hearth later that evening and eat him open. I think about it as he watches me leave to quickly pop into my flat the next morning, his reluctance to let me go clear in his eyes.
Harry took Albus’ hand and tightened his hold on Lily as James wrapped both arms around Harry’s waist and wailed into his stomach. Ginny’s body vanished from sight as Harry’s vision blurred.
(Harry had fucked him so hard that night, Draco was fairly certain he was still bruised from it). And so when Harry gnawed a proprietary line of mottled red marks starting below his ear all the way down to his shoulder, Draco pushed a hand into the raven hair and bit his lip over a weak moan, because fuck, but Harry’s unabashed displays of possessiveness drove him into a frenzy like nothing else did.
With a burst of effort that drains me of everything I possess, I yank myself away from him. For a second, he surges forward, following my mouth. Then he goes still. He’s not pale anymore but flushed a frantic pink. His lips are pink too, swollen and wet, his eyes wide, dark with arousal and wondering. He’s panting, wheezing, through his mouth. I can see the bulge of his erection in his jeans.
And then, just as Harry is pulling down the tin of tea, Malfoy speaks again, soft and almost breathless with fevered suspicion. “It’s the baby, isn’t it?” he says, voice quavering. “You want to take this baby away from me. You want to keep it for yourself and throw me back in that hole. You want to take it away and have me thrown in

“What do you want from me?!” Harry slams his fist on a siren red button and fresh cream, full-fat, thick and yellow starts to pour into the clean vessel.
“What are you doing down here?” Ron scowls, climbing off the elliptical as Draco strolls out of the elevator, yanking open the Velcro on his kickboxing gloves with his teeth. He smirks as he walks over and deliberately rams his shoulder into Ron’s. “Can’t we even get a workout in without looking at your pinched face?”
But Draco finds himself unable to get over the insecurity that comes with weight gain. He knows Harry, knows that he’d touch and kiss and fuck Draco with the same enthusiasm as always. But Draco’s own self-consciousness is a permanent fixture at the back of his mind, hovering there and cruelly reminding him that he no longer had the same fit body that Harry loved and used to practically
“Shut up, you’re not on duty right now” he tells me crisply, stowing away his wand. “BLAISE!” he suddenly bellows making me jump.
Saliva collects under his tongue from the pain and yet, that is not what he’s focusing on at the moment. Because Potter is
“It was not,” Potter says, still unnervingly steady and calm as he prowls closer. “That was Timothy McGraw; he’s the manager for the Holyhead Harpies.” Draco is rooted to the spot, almost certain that he’s been stealthily Body-Bound, when Potter finally stands inches away. “He brought over my contract to sign; I’m coaching the team for three months.” There’s a pause as Potter’s eyes narrow, his head slowly tilting. “Do you genuinely believe I’m attracted to him?” he asks softly, his tone making it clear that he believes Draco to be fantastically stupid.
But the swooping joy that Draco had felt when that gleaming cloud had burst out his wand had dissipated right along with it. “Don’t patronise me, Potter,” he says quietly, temper suddenly flaring.
going to be an Auror, y’know?” he said, chest puffing out with pride as he elbowed Potter repeatedly. “Harry. Harry, show him your Ministry tag. Harry, c’mon. Hey, Harry, show him your—”
Hermione stands at the door, arms laden with files and several large glass bottles, looking completely aghast. Harry releases Malfoy and jumps back so quickly that he ends up yanking the thin, black elastic in Malfoy’s hair along with him, the pale hair quickly coming loose and falling around Malfoy’s face as he continues staring at Harry with his mouth open, cheeks and neck splotchy with colour, chest heaving, eyes almost imperceptibly glazed.
Because he really hasn’t seen Potter’s cock yet – and Draco is relieved and impatient and a tad bit desperate all at once.
,” he sneers, “but contrary to anything you both might believe, I have no regrets of having lived my life like this so far. I’ve been on that potion ever since I was five and while at a fete with my parents, had a gnarly old coot grab me up and declare that he was going to
Mouth watering, Draco ambled away inside, pulling off his stained robes on the way, his mood drastically improving at the thought of a hot shower followed by an unholy amount of shepherd’s pie. When he got to the bedroom the first thing he saw was Moody sitting up on his hind legs on the bed between their pillows and chewing determinedly on the corner of Draco’s pillowcase.
“Just leave me written instructions, why don’t you,” Harry murmurs against his throat, “Scheduled confessions of the heart that I can keep to.”
He meets Potter’s eye unblinkingly as the idiot stands there, shifting from foot to foot, scowling at the floor and looking as sullen as he looks sheepish.
Draco sits on the sofa with a miserable, sniffling Scorpius’ head in his lap as Granger waves her wand in soothing circles over the boy’s tummy.
Harry doesn’t remember Summoning the lube but when the tube smacks into his face, knocking his glasses off, he straightens up at once, squeezing out an unholy amount straight onto his cock and lining it up against Malfoy’s glinting arsehole, watching it fall open easily as he presses the tip in. He can hear his own panting, torn and rumbling out of his chest, and the sight of Malfoy trembling in front of him, with his pale, round arse raised in wanton offering, soft, pink hole greedily sucking Harry in, sends his mind hurtling through a void where there’s no careful control, no self-restraint; just Malfoy and his perfect, stunning arse and Harry’s indomitable need to simply
Draco steps inside as Potter flattens himself against the front door instead of just stepping back; Draco’s shoulder brushes against Potter’s front as he sweeps past him and for a moment, Draco has the bizarre urge to press further against him, into that heat Potter’s body seems to emit through his clothes.
,” he tries lamely. Malfoy looks like he wants to shred Harry apart with his bare hands. “You really are,” Harry says desperately.
“It wouldn’t go down, not until I got sexually involved with my...” Harry trails off, eyes going big and round, before eventually bulging slightly, “...soulmate.”
Potter meets his gaze calmly, like he’d known all along that Draco’s been watching him but couldn’t, until that very moment, be bothered to return his gaze.
I want to say to him. He stops and turns around halfway, the look on his face haughty and sharp. “I didn’t mean to snap,” I finally tell him. He doesn’t smile or relax his rigid stance, simply standing there in silence until I shift uneasily on my feet.
Harry’s sharp, choked cry is more grateful than aroused and Draco’s heart swells when Harry still doesn’t move his hands down to guide Draco’s head. Easing the stretched foreskin all the way down with one hand, Draco sucks lovingly at the head, briefly thumbing the slit open wider before licking into it, humming into the saline burst across his tongue. Working the tip along the insides of his lips a few times, Draco finally lets the bulbous, slippery head slide down his tongue, and then lower, pinning Harry’s body to the bed as he squeezes it with his throat, swallowing deliberately around it.
!” His feet stomp back onto the ground as Harry willingly complies and begins battering away at his arse, stroking the sweaty nape of his neck for a second before pushing his fingers into the tousled, white blond mess and grasping a handful, yanking his head back roughly. “Potter,” he moans, voice breaking as he slips down a couple of inches, at which point he starts stroking his cock in slippery ruts against the seat again. “
Then suddenly, quite literally in the span of a single second, Potter is scrambling away with a wild, horrified gasp, his hands and feet slapping onto the floor as he crawls backwards. When Draco turns around, startled and more than a little rueful at the abrupt disappearance of that greedy mouth, he finds Potter staring up at him with something akin to unbridled panic.
“No judgement, Malfoy,” she says liltingly, one arm hanging loosely over the armrest as she drinks her wine, posture and manner completely relaxed, face impassive as she turns back to the TV. “My opinion here hardly matters.”
“We owe you no explanation, Draco,” Lucius answers coolly. “Not after you’ve gone and lived in sin with that
“If you’re staying, sit,” Malfoy orders tonelessly. “Otherwise, you can leave. I’ll see you on Wednesday at Mungo’s.”
A moment later, Ron’s head pops in, his hair a complete mess and his face drawn. “Harry?” he calls out before he spots Harry hurrying over. “We found them. They’ve been taken in.”
Because the next second, Harry waved his hand in a broad circle over the mess and wandlessly cleaned it up. The newspaper still looked a bit damp but the furniture was spotless and the cream kitchen tiles sparkled.
“You’re pregnant,” he finally says softly. “And I wasn’t in control of myself last night. It was the full moon,” he adds smoothly before Draco can respond. “I was already on edge. It’d have been really hard for me to reign myself in and there was a chance I really might’ve hurt you had I not left.”
“Too bad, eh?” Malfoy rasps, his voice trembling. “I bet you’d have loved for them to have been escorted to Azkaban instead.”
Malfoy’s face remained empty of expression. “This is the courtyard. We go upstairs,” he pointed at the staircase, “where there’s a hall we could use.”
“Of course you’re not over it,” Malfoy drawls sleepily. “You’re very easy to...overwhelm.” He sighs and wiggles a bit once more. “Wake me up when your cock slips out of my arse, hm? I could do with some dinner.”
Harry twists in a second finger, sawing them back and forth, scissoring them inside him over and over as he licks at the rim around them with the tip of his tongue, flicking ticklish little licks at the sensitive, pinkened skin.
But I’m not listening anymore. I’d stopped listening as soon as she’d said ‘dark curse’. Because I know someone who is supremely skilled with dark curses; someone who
good thing. It’s highly unusual but nothing to cause worry.” Her finger singles out a small, oblong shape somewhere in the centre of the greyish stretch. “There,” she says softly.
Draco murmurs a spell and shuffles closer, dropping his wand aside and separating Potter’s arse cheeks again to watch the way the conjured lube thickly drips down his crease, gleaming in the light pouring in from the streetlight outside.
“Oh, let’s see.” Draco climbs onto the stool I’d just vacated, straddling it and tucking one foot under the rung. “Are you free, say, next
“Shut your Halfblood-trap,” Draco delights in snarling up at him. “I’m going to suck your Halfblood-cock now,” he notifies him flatly, lifting the hem of his t-shirt out of the way, pushing the round, flat button of his jeans back through its hole and yanking down the zipper.
“You’re insatiable, Potter,” Draco murmurs three hours later as he lies there pinned between Potter and his sofa.
Because Harry is now standing there and staring at Draco, and Draco can just about make out the bulge of what is most certainly an erection in his jeans.
“I—I thought it was...” he murmurs, turning away when his lower lip trembles. “I didn’t want you to be obligated to me in any way,” he finally rasps over his shoulder. “Noble arse like you; I didn’t want you to think you owe me anything just because—just
“For Merlin’s sake, Draco, it’s been four months!” I stab my fork viciously into each of the fried tomatoes on my plate. “Stop with the Simon-ing already!” I shake the shrivelled tomatoes off my fork and onto his plate.
“I just needed to know if something was wrong with me before I sought actual medical help, Granger,” Malfoy responds stiffly.
“That’s the bloody idea,” Draco breathes, tugging impatiently at Potter’s hair. “Can you get on with it?”
Potter’s hands move over Draco in a heated, desperate massage as they snogged, stroking his hair and caressing his sides and rubbing his thighs and squeezing his arse; Draco finds himself just lying there, gasping for air after a point, Potter’s mouth gnawing ruthlessly at his throat, his hand slipping slyly into Draco’s trousers to pull at his cock, tortuously slow, until Draco judders with orgasm, the room spinning around him.
Harry doesn’t really remember what life was like before he and Malfoy moved in together; before they became friends. Appearing together in public was more a habit now than an act and if this impeded Harry from having an actual love-life, he didn’t particularly care.
enormous fucking downside to doing this with you,” he mutters irritably. “You’re a goddamn basket case.”

) handsome werewolf sitting across from him at his workbench and watching with fascinated interest as Draco crushes winter cherries and chops up guelder roses and lazily stirs the chamomile infusion in his cauldron every now and then.
“Just show me once.” Draco steps back and indicates to where Potter’s got his wand tucked into his belt. “Cast your Patronus for me once.”
Draco doesn’t realise he’s giving Potter an incredulous, slightly pained look until Potter’s smile slowly vanishes and he leans forward, looking wary and worried all at once. Draco clears his throat and looks away, altering his expression into one of easily accessed impassivity.
“It’s Tristan’s birthday!” he says brightly just as we walk up to the birthday bastard who grins and nods at me.
Ron tosses back half a mug of beer and belches loud enough to make the people over at the next table look around in shock. “I don’t mind,” he announces, licking off his foam moustache and looking up at me hopefully. I gesture wordlessly for him to hand over his empty mug.
“Hello to you too,” Ginny blows him a kiss as she saunters in, kissing Hermione’s cheek and then flinging herself at me.
eventually need to be bolstered because the little one is going to be drawing most of it for itself. Here’s where your Alpha magic will come in handy, Harry; I doubt you’ll even feel any of the strain that comes with sharing magic.” She ends the spell and walks back to her seat as the lights come back on. Draco holds his breath as Potter and he stare at each other a beat, gazes wide and somehow
Hermione smiles and wipes her hands on the bright yellow apron she’d borrowed from Mrs. Weasley. “Malfoy. And you must be the much talked about boyfriend,” she adds, leaning one hip into the counter.
,” Potter says emphatically, dipping his head to stare flatly at Draco, glasses slipping down his nose as he grins crookedly. “Of
“I suppose, if you want to smell like a bloody patisserie. I hate Pansy sometimes.” His hands suddenly fumble with my belt buckle and he squints slightly in the semi-darkness, shaking his hair out of his eyes.
“Don’t be silly, Harry.” Hermione picks up her fork, rolling her eyes. “And go have sex with your boyfriend.”
“You know.” She waves her hand vaguely. “You get along brilliantly for two individuals who spent most of their teens trying to get each other killed.”
“Sure, let’s go get lunch,” Potter says smoothly, even as Draco pants up at him, stunned and jelly-legged.
“So let’s fix that,” Malfoy whispers, yanking Harry’s head forward with the hand still caught in his hair.
“What else does Hermione say? What is it that you both think about me and my alleged feelings for someone we grew up hating?”
He doesn’t seem to be able to control the way his spine bows painfully with every other thrust, back flying up off the bed as his prostate is pummelled. Potter doesn’t pause or slow down for a single moment and it’s all Draco can do to clutch at him and attempt to stifle his embarrassing, breathless little moans into his hair as he sets about bruising Draco’s neck well past the point of Healing Charms, hot mouth ruthlessly staking claim.
If anyone could make servitude appear smug, it’s Harry Potter. Draco can’t even bring himself to resent him for it, though.
“On your knees,” whispers Draco, holding his breath as Potter mulls over the instruction for a couple of seconds before slowly bringing his knees under him so he’s standing on all fours. Still stroking his arse, Draco looks right at him as he turns his head and watches Draco once more.
Harry’s gaze lifted and in the flickering light from his wand, there was a flash of, not silver, but gold.
Malfoy frowns but sighs and bites his lip, staring thoughtfully at the table for a moment. “Does he wear formal robes a lot?” Malfoy tilts his head, “That store, Bejewelled, on Phoenix Street has a spectacular collection of jewellery for wizards too; you could get him a set of cufflinks or something? Oh!” Malfoy’s eyes suddenly brighten, sparkling excitedly, “They have these
Something in Draco snaps. “I think I am falling in—” Draco nearly slaps a hand over his own mouth as he breaks off mid-sentence. Harry’s eyes are very big behind his mud flecked glasses, his breathing suddenly ragged and loud.
“What do you mean tired?” I ask sceptically, bringing one knee onto the sofa as I turn to face him. “Tired of what?”
“I had no need to, your father is a very affectionate husband,” she replies and Draco clicks his tongue in disapproval, earning a casual shrug in reply. “What I’m saying is, darling, that sex is important at every stage of a marriage, not just the early years.”
“I’ll make tea,” Ron grunts, ears pink, before wandering away to the kitchen, the sound of the kettle filling slightly jarring in the ensuing silence.
“Psh, no, he isn’t even gay,” he clarifies, rolling his eyes and picking up the menu again. “His brother is, though,” he adds casually, glancing up through his lashes at me with a completely debauched grin, grey eyes sparkling. “So,
Potter sobers up so quickly that Draco inadvertently stiffens in his seat. “No,” Potter says seriously, “I’d
Draco snorts, brushing his mouth over Harry’s scar, his temple, his cheek, his hand curled around Harry’s neck, his pulse a strong, rhythmic drumming under Draco’s palm. “Tell me truthfully – was last night at all even slightly more tolerable than usual?”
“Well, I suppose the half-dressed birds were a bit of a distraction.” I look around lazily before my gaze snags on a vaguely familiar face. “Isn’t that--?”
“Potter, how did you find me?” Malfoy asks suddenly, eyes narrowing to slits, head tilting slowly. “Nobody knows where I--” he breaks off, realisation dawning, “You tracked that owl,” he hisses.
.” He takes a step forward and Harry springs to his feet, wand in hand. Malfoy yelps in shock and struggles to his feet at once, grabbing Harry’s arm in a painfully tight grip and attempting to drag him back down.
Lucius is no longer smiling, instead looking off somewhere to one side; Narcissa is sobbing quietly into one hand. Malfoy is panting softly and Harry gives into the urge to reach over and firmly clasp his hand.
His eyes flutter open and the long, pale lashes are damp. With my heart thudding painfully, bitter guilt on my tongue, I watch as he clumsily straightens up and half-sits up against the armrest. He looks at me, mouth open like he wants to say something but doesn’t know quite how to frame it.
“Fancy,” he mumbles, slowly approaching and then sitting down at the table, side-eying the flowers and candles, the napkins folded into swans, and the brand new cutlery. Then he suddenly looks up at me as I bring over and pour the wine. “Are—are you wearing a new shirt?”
Nodding and swallowing past another infuriating lump that rises in his throat, Draco picks up the watch again, fastening it around his left wrist with a faint click. Successfully holding back more tears, Draco stares at it for a long time before finally looking up and giving Potter a watery smile, cheeks blotchy and eyes red-rimmed.
“This,” he breathes, when I’ve pulled away and pushed my face into the crook of his neck, immediately biting into it and sucking. “This
, likely the only one of his kind in the last century...stands there with all the sweet hope and excitement of an eight year old at the prospect of being friends with Draco.
Malfoy, to Harry’s vague satisfaction, looked utterly gobsmacked. Harry held his breath, waiting for something nasty and along the lines of
“Harry,” Draco strides forward, clutching a bunch of socks in both hands. “Harry, listen. I don’t have a single matching pair of socks.”
going to be starting you on some additional pre-meal potions, though, just a preventative so your digestion and bowel movements remain normal.” She pauses and lifts wry eyes when Draco splutters again, smacking a hand onto his face. “Relax, Malfoy. Your blood pressure is a tad high and you need to avoid stressing.”
“What happened to your hands anyway?” Harry freed one hand with slow care before moving on to the other.
Not that Harry even pauses. His erection is downright painful as he pulls it out, more actual pain than pleasure, and Harry is desperate as he slicks his fingers and swipes them against the soft furl of Malfoy’s entrance. “Fuck, please, Malfoy,” he coats his erection liberally and lines up, “please fucking let me, I’m so sorry, oh shit, please--”
He’s assaulted with vivid flashes of the previous night: the massive, black wolf, crouching in one corner as Draco entered, its low, rumbling growls making Draco erupt into gooseflesh; the way Draco had stood there for nearly half an hour, still and unmoving, hands raised before himself to make clear his wholly benign presence. The way he’d nearly screamed for Kreacher, his voice caught somewhere down in his chest, when the wolf had finally risen and lolloped over to him, limping slightly, stopping in front of him before butting its head against one of Draco’s hands.
he was with. But Draco only feels an overwhelming need to protect, to care for, what he’d been with,
irritably when Draco glowers at him. “It’s my word against Skeeter’s, Draco, of course it fixes things.” He pauses. “Somewhat.”
He’d not had the chance to wish Harry luck that morning before breakfast like he’d hoped to. He’d overslept like a fucking arsehole, before being jolted awake to Pansy’s shrieked
Tucking them in, Harry kissed his children an extra few times and made sure the blankets covered their feet. This time when he looked across at them, the Malfoys were lying down under Malfoy’s green cloak, Malfoy pointing up at the sky every now and then, drawing in the air, as though explaining something.
too long picturing this – Potter atop him, the two of them slick and slippery with sweat and completely out of breath – and yet, this is
“No, you did it for the baby, I get that,” Draco replies tightly, looking away. Potter’s hand on his knee tightens until Draco looks back at him.
Potter lives in no dearth of loved ones but Draco can't help but feel an inexplicably random rush of sympathy for the man. He's no Gryffindor, Draco; he isn’t one to live under the shadow of all the good deeds that people might’ve done for him – but it was Potter who had pulled him out of a burning room, Potter who had spoken in his favour at his trials, Potter whom he had to thank for living, not only as a free man, but as a proud Veela.
The mid-morning sun beats down on his head, his hands beginning to sweat a little as he stands at the edge of the overgrown front garden, staring blankly at the filthy front door, the black paint on it flaking off, the enormous, brass knocker in desperate need of polishing.
His wand rolls away noiselessly, wood bouncing across rubber before it comes to a halt several feet away, very much out of reach. Seemingly every inch of him is covered in sweat, his clothes plastered to his skin. His jaw hurts from gritting his teeth so hard and his body
Head throbbing, Draco blinks around the room. He hadn’t drawn the curtains the night before and sunlight is slanting into the room in broad, yellow beams, making his eyes
“Why d’you think she did everything she could to make Malfoy jealous?” Ron is grinning, looking rather proud of his sister. When I just look down at my plate again: “Malfoy’s been soft on you for years, mate.”
didn’t have to suffer through the process, and Hermione had watched Harry in alarm as if worried that he’d suddenly keel over and pass out because of his jutting boner.
“Would both of you shut your faces?” I pant wearily, slowing down to a jog and then hopping off the treadmill. I grab my towel back from him and pull my glasses off just as they’re about to slip off my sweaty nose, mopping my face dry – I can smell Draco’s cologne and sweat and vaguely wonder if it’s at all odd that I can actually recognise his scent distinctly. “Could one of you come spot me?” I head over to the weights, both of them trailing after me, Draco continuing to burrow his way deeper under Ron’s skin with next to no effort.
. I can’t imagine what life was like before Draco. That’s how I see life now: Before Draco and After Draco.
Another glance around the stone courtyard revealed that, other than on the Cloak, there was nowhere comfortable he could set her down. He looked at Malfoy who sat with his eyes closed.
Five minutes later, Draco is still thinking about the grin Potter had given him as he’d left his room. He’s waiting for him, Potter, his breakfast still untouched as he flips through the sports section of the Prophet, the daily news and gossip sections laid out next to Draco’s plate as usual.
Nostrils flared in quiet fury, Draco wrenches his hand back – only he can’t break Potter’s grip so it only results in Potter tightening his fingers around Draco’s wrist as Draco stumbles back a step.
The silence stretches on and on, turning strained and unbelievably tense. When the same house-elf from earlier pops in with a
His trials for the day don’t seem over yet because when he steps into his office, he’s met with the sight of Ronald Weasley lounging in one of the chairs in front of his desk, maroon Auror uniform left unbuttoned over his clothes, trailing onto the floor where he sits.
“Potter?” Malfoy sounds wary and yet, Harry hears the trace of smug knowingness in his voice, “Don’t just
“Oh, his cock is just fine,” replies Draco brightly. “He reported back to me after the deed was done and I lifted the curse and gave him a few more galleons because, after all, it
“You called me your boyfriend and promised painful vengeance to the next person who might lay his hands on me,” Malfoy says gently, hitching his bag higher up his shoulder, his left arm still in a sling. “If this had been anyone but you, they’d have been brought in by the DMLE.”
mug – and catches it as it mends and reforms, rising up smoothly. There’s a pan sizzling on the hob and the room smells of eggs, sausages, coffee and toast. There are two plates on the counter, waiting to be piled with food. And Potter is there.
Hermione perches on the sofa chair across from Harry and watches him worriedly. “Did you even go on the date?”
“The others won’t be here until noon, nobody managed to get an earlier Portkey,” Hermione says, carefully peeling an orange.
“Tristan!” I bellow back, covering my mouth to muffle the rather unmanly giggle that instantly escapes me.
“Well, we can still try not to say fuck so much,” Potter says lamely, frowning a bit. “At least not in front of the baby.”
as you want! I’ll—if you tell me what kind of foods you like I’ll let Kreacher know and he’ll make them for you! Or you could tell him yourself! You’re half-Black, he’ll listen to you!”
, you fucki--” Harry inhaled sharply – not at the impertinence but because there was something inexplicably
Even in the semi darkness, I can tell he’s blushing a deep rose. His mouth twists into a tiny smirk, eyes twinkling. “There are so many of them to beat, though.”
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco mumbles, biting the inside of one cheek as Potter chuckles and gives Draco’s knee an affectionate rub. “I’ve... I’ve been meaning to thank you, actually,” he admits quietly. Potter doesn’t say anything to that (nor does he move his hand) so Draco continues. “You...didn’t have to put me up here, didn’t have to make such an effort to make me feel comfortable. You’re...a good person,” he adds, slightly lamely, but resentfully sincere as he says it. Potter just smiles, looking a bit bemused. “I owe you a lot already, Potter,” Draco scowls, “and now this. Can you stop doing me favours already?”
. And Draco sometimes had to go to the loo and check if he had dried ketchup on his chin from when he’d been eating the chips that Goyle ordered that Draco had insisted he didn’t want.
Draco smiles softly, running his hand over Harry’s chest, palm grazing the raised buds of his nipples. “Let’s hope the crying isn’t a regular part of it,” he says softly, pressing his hand down over Harry’s heart when he feels him stiffen. “But you can always just ask if you feel like being bossed around,” he adds at once.
Hermione sags back in her chair with a weary sigh and rubs her eye with her knuckles. Ron looks rather queasy as he stares at me for confirmation and I suddenly realise that none of it even matters.
Harry grins, tugging his sweaty, mud stained t-shirt off and mopping his face with it. “I think it’s just a general consensus among them that witches have wrinkly, green skin and are fatally averse to water.”
Harry smiles weakly at her as she swaps his empty glass for a fresh drink, wondering if he ought to have stumbled to the loo first for a quick wank-break before ordering this round.
bint didn’t want to open it in front of her brother unless there were lawyers present because she was absolutely certain that he’d claim sole right over the contents. Anyway, I did my bit and ran before I could be dragged into all the family drama rubbish,” he says as he Levitates the largest slice onto a plate which he then sends floating towards Ron. “Here you go, you bellend,” he says almost fondly.
“So? Finally got what you wanted?” he continues sourly. “Can’t blame you, I suppose. Can’t blame anyone who wants to fuck a slut like that.” He pauses while my fingers tingle for my wand. “Wonder how long he’ll last with you before he gets bored of your heroic cock.”
