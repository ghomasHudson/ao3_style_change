“I’m not going to last. Oh goddess, tell me what you need Draco.”
He heard the door close behind the love of his life. Harry let out the scream of anguish he was holding in. He fell to his knees and cried.
Draco heard Harry telepathically and smiled as he realized his mate didn’t want his friend in their heat space.
Harry was drawn from his memories as he heard a car approaching. A black town car pulled to stop in the driveway and Harry watched as first Pansy Parkinson got out and then he watched as hair so blonde it was almost white became visible. Harry’s jaw clenched as Draco came around the door and was in full sight. The blonde looked so beautiful it hurt Harry to look at him. His was face was slightly rounded with pregnancy and his cheeks were rosy from the warmth of the car. Draco was wearing a green sweater and black pants that fit tight to his legs. His petite frame was pretty much the same except for his large rounded belly. Harry felt a flash of rage as he watched Draco put a hand to his belly when he saw Harry. Draco had been pregnant this whole time and not a word. Harry wasn’t leaving today without settling things with Draco. Draco was his and that was his child. He didn’t need to stay with Parkinson anymore. With that Harry made eye contact with Draco and crossed his arms over his chest.
“Yes, I just feel so full and I want…more.” Draco wiggled his hips and Harry moaned.
” Harry emphasized.
“I love him.”
“Thank you.” Harry hung up and continued packing the bag. He called the front desk and asked for them to arrange a car to the airport, that he would be checking out.
“Do you feel it? We made a baby.” Draco then looked up from their joined hands over his stomach and gave him the brightest smile. Harry nodded and leaned forward to lightly kiss the blonde.
“Bath first.” He said and turned to get in the tub.
Harry looked up at him with his emerald eyes. “Hello, Draco.”
‘Ex-husband.”
“Of course, my little Omega can have anything he wants.” Harry kneeled down and spread apart Draco’s cheeks. Draco gasped at the first brush of Harry’s tongue on his rim. He moaned as Harry licked around the outside. Draco moaned as Harry’s tongue pushed inside. Slick was pouring from his hole and into his Alpha’s mouth. Harry made love to Draco’s hole with his tongue until Draco was whining and trying to move forward to get friction on his cock. Harry reached a hand around and wrapped it around Draco’s small cock. The big Alpha’s hand was calloused and warm as he moved it up and down Draco’s cock.
“Pretty enough to kiss?”
“Alright sir, let me see what I can do.”
“Sensitive baby?”
Harry stared down at the phone. He knew he should have taken Draco’s calls and talked to the girls. But, the truth was Harry had been afraid if he talked to them he would get on a plane and go home. Draco and Harry had moved to America right after the girls were born so Harry could start his production company. Draco had dreams of going to Harvard Law and was accepted last year. Harry always felt like Draco’s dreams were bigger than Harry and the girls. Like maybe they weren’t enough?
Lucius and Narcissa made a striking sight as they approached Draco. Draco’s mother was a nymph like Hermione and was tall and lithe. Unlike Draco’s pale hair his mother had dark tresses that flowed down her back. His mother’s blue eyes shown with pride as she approached them. Lucius walked slightly behind Narcissa but looked no less proud. Draco inherited all his features from his father. Lucius had pale hair like Draco, gray eyes, and a wicked sense of fashion. Draco however, was petite in comparison to his parents and only came up to his father’s shoulder. But to onlookers, it was obvious they were a family.
“Harry…. It’s me. Please call me back it’s urgent. We need to talk.” Draco hit end and then looked into the mirror again. He groaned and dropped his head.
Draco didn’t know what to say. The look on Harry’s face was unguarded and he looked lost. The elevator dinged before he could form words and they stepped out onto the 5
“You’re not old enough to be kissed short stuff. Mom told me.”
“Hello Draco, how are you feeling today? I see you brought someone this visit.”
“My sweet child” his mother cooed and brought him in for a hug. Draco was comforted by her familiar Alpha pheromones. His father was an Alpha as well, and while they were able to have him, he was his parents only child given the rarity of an Alpha/Alpha union. Some were surprised when Draco presented as an Omega given his parentage but his parents didn’t care one bit and were insanely proud of their Omega son.
Ginny smiled at him and said “better than I imagined” in a dry tone. He watched as the Alpha’s blue eyes locked on someone behind him. Before Draco could turn to look and see who was there Neville stepped forward.
Draco ran with the swiftness of most Fae; his feet flying over the grass as he ran towards the woods. Draco was very aware of the large Alpha hot on his heels. He didn’t dare turn back for fear of losing his footing. The pounding of his heart was the only thing he heard as Draco focused on a tree at the corner of the woods. Draco was both exhilarated and afraid. What would Harry do when he caught him? Draco pictured himself caught in Harry’s large arms and the Alpha’s sensual face lowering towards his own. Draco felt himself leak some slick as he pictured Harry devouring him. Draco heard Harry growl and then his sensitive ears heard the Alpha’s words.
“Ugh!” Draco smiled as Pansy stuck her tongue out and slipped out the door. He was lucky to have people that cared about him around. Draco rubbed a tender hand over his belly, “we are going to be okay baby, I promise.”
Draco groaned and laid back on the bed. He rested a hand on his swollen belly and felt the baby move underneath his hand.
“Darling, I’m so sorry. I heard about everything. It’s going to be okay, I’ll be going home with you too.”
Harry chimed in through their bond.
Draco looked up at him from his bath and gave him a sweet smile. “Come here Alpha.” Harry went willingly as Draco looked beautiful and serene sitting in the bath. His pale features were practically glowing with health. Harry approached the edge of the tub and stepped in. He kneeled before his beautiful mate.
“Of course Harry.”
“Harry please.”
“You’re going to keep us in suspense?” Draco exclaimed and looked at his mom for support. “You’re a terrible tease Pansy Parkinson.” His best friend just gave him a teasing look and said nothing.
The blonde opened his eyes and smiled sleepily. “Baby and I need a nap now.” Draco smiled down at his belly as he rubbed his hand over it.
Draco moaned as Harry inserted another finger. He moved them in and out mimicking what Harry ached to do with his cock. Draco writhed on the ground as Harry scissored his two fingers to stretch Draco’s tight hole. Finally, Harry couldn’t wait anymore and withdrew his fingers to replace them with his mouth. He moaned as the first taste of Draco’s slick hit his tongue.
you.”  Draco was beginning to cry again.  “I’ve
“Can we just—” Harry reached for him again, cutting off when Malfoy again jerked away.
Yin blinked at him. “Wow. You have a
“Er mate,” Harry said. “You do know what a toilet is for?”
Harry spent the rest of the week at Rombe Pickle with Andromeda and Teddy, who didn’t seem eager to return to the Academy, but Teddy had never seemed eager to return to Hogwarts either. He never seemed eager to do anything in particular, but he never seemed un-eager, and every day at least four or five owls swooped in from the orchard bearing notes from friends who missed him.
Malfoy’s breath was becoming faster and faster, and Harry remembered the demonstration for Wandless Combat, how Malfoy had been afraid of him. Harry moved away, and Malfoy’s shoulders immediately shot up again as he moved out of the stance completely.
The trainees began to move—Bennet and Wan forming a pair, Moskowitz and Fairchild, Achar and Fuentes, all the expected pairs—except for Malfoy, who was still just standing about. He looked like he might not have moved since Harry had told him to warm-up. His eyes were still fixed on Harry.
“Harry,” Ron said, at his side again, hand on Harry’s shoulder. “It’s not the same at all. We were kids. Malfoy can choose for himself.”
“I told you he doesn’t really matter,” Harry said.
He wanted to lean in, to put his cheek on the straight, bony line of Malfoy’s shoulder, to feel his soft, thin hair brush against his own. He wanted to wrap his arms around Malfoy’s waist and press himself still closer. Instead, Harry shouted over the wind, and gestured at the crowd below. “Haven’t we better give them pamphlets?”
“The young Malfoy has qualifications,” Pillwickle said, “that could balance out certain
Harry hesitated, then tried to speak as gently as possible. “Because you were a Death Eater.”
“That wasn’t what I was thinking.”
Harry went to his hearth, opened the pot on the mantel, took out the Floo powder, and threw it in the hearth. “Granger-Weasleys,” he told the green flame, then put his face into it.
“I imagine that’s uncomfortable.” Doctor Yin gulped their smoothie.
Heloise, seeming to recognize Draco even in his younger form, flew straight to him, landing on his shoulder in a way that made Draco stumble back.  “Whoa,” Draco said, but Heloise just used her beak to ruffle Draco’s hair.  “What’s she doing?” Draco asked, patting his hair.
Whirling around, Harry pointed his wand at the taxi.  He only remembered one spell that seemed at all helpful.  “
Picking up a spoon for the sugar, Mister Malfoy made a disbelieving sound.  “What makes you think he doesn’t like you?  Sometimes he doesn’t want to play games your way?”
“Right, but the
Harry took a calming breath, then another. Robards was always like this. Harry wasn’t sure why, after four years, he had thought it would be any different, especially after what he’d said when he’d held the press conference about Travers’s punishment. Harry had told them that the Force had refused to intervene. Furthermore, Robards knew that harassing a witness was certain to agitate Harry—even if that witness was Malfoy. “You know what the memory contains,” Harry said finally. “We’ve been doing nothing but message about it for the past two hours.”
“I’m sure,” Harry said.
“What’s the critique?” Malfoy asked.
The thought came in Kavika’s voice.
“Yes.”
The man raised a brow, but not in a mean way.  He was in fact being very polite.  “You said your uncle would be worried.”
“Do it, Harry.”  Mister Malfoy laughed some more, and it was such a nice sound, nicer than anything Harry had ever heard before.  Way better than Take That.
“My good friend Andromeda is helping with traffic control down below,” Harry told the woman who needed to get to the city. He put his hand on Nyala’s arm. “Are you okay?”
Harry gave her a look. “Teddy says
on Fenrir? “Teddy—”
“And how did that make you feel?” Kavika said. “After what he said to you in May?”
Malfoy touched his wand to the cup, Banishing it. “Have a chocolate,” he said, producing a bonbon from somewhere in his robes. It was in a little paper cup, like a proper sweet.
“Harry, therapists are not your next-door-neighbour. You don’t have to suffer through anyone who doesn’t work for you; you can pick the one you like. Does it help to get to know someone and allow yourself to open up? Of course. But if someone instantly rubs you the wrong way, you have the privilege and the power to walk away.”
“Yes,” Pillwickle soothed, “and young Master Malfoy is the one who destroyed it.”
thought Muggle-Erik might infect me.  You’re worried I feel debased.”
“Harry,” Draco said gently.  “I’ve been working on it all week.”
“I wasn’t.” Malfoy looked pretty curious about it. “But now I am.”
“Not . . . particularly,” Harry said. “I’m okay, not loving him. It’s . . . comfortable.”
“I always thought Oliver Wood was the best-looking bloke at Hogwarts,” Harry said suddenly.
“I’m going to Obliviate him,” Harry said.  “After we get the antidote, I can get Kingsley back on our side.”
Harry realized somehow Draco’s arm was around him and his head had got on Draco’s shoulder, which was warm and firm and a little bony.  The fabric of his shirt was silky, however, and Harry thought it was much nicer than a real pillow.  Embarrassed, he made himself lift his head.  “If I do, you’ll float me off into your bed, and you won’t have a proper place to sleep, and then you’ll just go do potions all night.”
“Still,” said Harry.  “I never would have thought it.”
“He can’t have been trying all that hard.”  Harry took a step back.  “Uncle Vernon is in the telephone directory.”
“I’m not tired,” Harry said, yawning directly after his words.
“Good show,” Malfoy said, stepping away.
Harry took another bite of toast, speaking with his mouth full.  “I’ve a sleeping bag.  Are you sure about the bacon?”  Though Harry reached out for it, he hesitated.
“Really?”
“I think it will.  Your wand likes me.”
Crumpling the parchment, Harry shoved it in his pocket.  He had some swamp-things to track down.  Then he had to face Robards and tell him he’d not only violated his suspension but again broken the policy for which he’d been suspended, all so he could talk to Draco bloody Malfoy.  Those swamp-things had better be worth it.
“He barely passed the exam,” said Penelope, “and our policy is to train the next generation of Aurors to protect the wizarding world from corruption and crime. We really think Draco Malfoy is going to be a shining example of magical justice? Let’s go re-admit Dawlish, shall we?”
. You said—”
“All right,” Mister Malfoy said.
“Did you ever imagine fucking me?”
That didn’t mean a former Death Eater was necessarily behind all of this.  Several different brewers were involved, according to the case files, but Harry still hadn’t been able to figure out what connected them, beyond the fact that the source for key ingredients was in the region of the Gulf of Mexico.  This suggested that the common element was a supplier, not a brewer.
yet.”
“You weren’t in the war!” Savage thundered at Penelope. “You don’t even know!”
“Good.”  Andromeda was never particularly warm—a little too sharp, a little too honest to feel exactly motherly.  But you could feel it when she approved of you, and usually she told you exactly what she thought.  Except when she was visiting her sister, apparently.  Just now Harry could see that she approved, and for the first time when it wasn’t a holiday, he thought about hugging her.
“Harry,” Draco said, sounding so upset that Harry looked up, his mouth full of the toast.
“Right,” Malfoy said again. “You’re ‘trying.’”
“What did you imagine when you imagined you were in my bed with me?” Harry kissed Draco in his clumsy way—hard and probably too forcefully; he didn’t care.
“Because I’m such a good person?”  Draco made another face, and he looked younger then.  “Why not.  Lead on.”
Early autumn yellows bled into bright mid-autumn orange, the sky still sometimes startlingly blue against leaves the colour of fire, the scent on the air crisp with apples and the earth wet with dying leaves. Classes at Academy were not very much different than they had been the year before, but Harry felt different, less at ease with Teddy there, nervous for him in ways that even Kavika could not help him fully understand.
“Head Auror Gawain Robards,” said the goblin at the gate.
“I’m a cheapskate.”
“How do you like the book?” Draco asked, after another minute.
,” Draco went on, sounding irritated.  “I learned all those by the time I was five.”
“He loved you,” Draco added, his voice sounding unexpectedly urgent.
“Then let me take it off you.”
“Oh,” said Bickford. “Oh, dear, oh dear. I’m afraid we do, Harry! We know they dropped the wards on Diagon Alley this morning—terrible mess, I’m afraid. Terrible, terrible. People hurt, injured—Mug—I mean, non-magical and magical alike! A terrible mess.”
“Finish?” Harry asked.  “You mean you already started it.”
“Confirmed?”  The worry was beginning to sound like alarm.  “But—”  Cutting himself off, Malfoy swallowed hard.  “I don’t have a—”  Malfoy stopped again, his eyes widening.  He looked Harry up and down.  “I—we’re not roommates, are we?”
Uncle Vernon would definitely characterize this situation as “funny business.”
“Fifty?” Harry guessed, because all grownups were old to him.  At the man’s incredulous look, Harry said, “Forty-nine?”  Then he started thinking.  The year was 2012.  His parents had been dead nearly thirty years by now.  “You’re thirty-one as well, aren’t you,” Harry asked.
“All right,” Harry said, holding him close.
“If you even pass,” Astoria said, jostling him.
Harry still thought he was beautiful.
Harry swallowed.  “Well—I.”  He swallowed again.  “I haven’t kept track of what you do in your own time.  You’re . . . discreet.”
Malfoy wasn’t actually asking him a question, and Harry didn’t take it as one.  He wasn’t thinking of himself at all, because this had nothing to do with him.  Malfoy was a grown-up, after all.  “Why don’t you charge for consultation?”
“How dare you?” Fudge fumed, then Greengrass retorted. Bickford tried to calm them, and Pillwickle said something about Malfoy, and Harry couldn’t hear.
Malfoy pulled out his wand in a fluid movement, turning with it to cast—Notice Me Nots, Harry realized. He felt so grateful that he didn’t know how to tell Malfoy that no matter how many shrouding spells you cast, most people still noticed a whole tree, especially a famous tree that everyone knew was there.
“No,” Harry said.  “It’s just an extra precaution.  My Patronus will stay with you.”
25 years
“I’ve never met a woman I was interested in marrying,” Draco said finally, playing another card.
“You’re nineteen,” Harry said helplessly.
“I’m not going to tell you anything.”
“Come sit with me,” Draco said, charming the dishes so that they floated into places on the blanket, then sitting down on the blanket himself.
“I don’t actually have to,” Malfoy said, squeezing cleaner onto the table and then scrubbing even harder.  “Despite popular opinion, I still have my free will, even if you—”
“Yes,” he said.  “Time to myself.  I would like—time to myself.”
The problem was, Harry didn’t want to blame Malfoy. He wanted Malfoy to be himself, without memories of who they had been to stand in his way or hurt him. Hopefully today, Harry could help that happen.
Kavika stood, coming to stand with him at the window. “Let’s do the exercise. Pretend you did get Draco removed from the Academy. You go to the Board. You tell them about his poor performance. Perhaps you even tell them of your discomfort.”
“I think you’re nice,” Harry said, following him over to the hearth.
“No,” Harry said. “I’m central to your life. You were always on the periphery of mine.”
“And his wife—doesn’t mind?  About the ribbon?”
“But—”
? Over the Hearing Raid?
“What do you mean?” demanded Savage, coming back over to Malfoy.
“Fuck, you’re so hot,” Harry said again. “You’re beautiful, Draco; I want you; I love doing this to you. I love touching you. Do you want me to talk about that, how good your dick feels in my hand?”
“Not your own. Hire a band.”
“Yes.”  Then Draco’s hand touched his shoulder, but it was in a nice way, and Draco was looking down at him with his silver eyes and pale throat and nice mouth.  “We all have skewed perspectives.  I should not have dismissed yours, especially as it—it means a great deal to me.”
“Did you really mean it?”
“Which one?” the woman said, hand on her hip.  “In case you’ve forgot in the
For a second Harry remembered the child Malfoy had been and resented him thoroughly, but then the moment fell away. Huffing a sigh, Harry acquiesced. “This is a demonstration,” he explained to the trainees. “Malfoy is one of the best I’ve trained. We’re going to go through everything we’ve learned,” he added, turning back to Malfoy, who—inevitably—was blushing. The stain of it spilled all the way down his throat. “Take note of each technique you see, and how you might apply it in your own combat. Ready, Malfoy?”
“Er,” Harry said, not sure what Draco wanted.  “Do I have to read it?”
Draco’s head whipped over to look at him.
“Who else?”
Harry thought about saying, because these were the things Malfoy would have once used to say that they were similarly scarred. They weren’t similarly scarred. They didn’t need to be different sides of a same coin to work together; they could be different coins. Different coins could work together. Harry didn’t know how to say all that. Not with Malfoy still his student, anyway. For instance, he could kiss Malfoy right here, set Malfoy on his desk, spread his legs, stand between them, snog him silly—
“But it’s . . .” Draco took a step back, then another.  He back up against a column of the hearth, then looked up at it as though it had attacked him.  “It’s—it’s an abomination.”
Malfoy looked up at him in confusion.
Harry held up his wand.
It wasn’t a small thing Malfoy had done. It wasn’t a petty thing. It wasn’t something that had happened because Harry had been careless, because he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. It had happened because Malfoy had been cruel, and physically abusive; he had been someone who didn’t care about causing others pain. He hadn’t even cared about causing others death. He had laughed about it. He had been proud of it, Voldemort asking him to kill Dumbledore.
After Harry dismissed the initiates, Malfoy left, but a group still lingered. Harry knew why. He just didn’t want to have to deal with it.
found the person that worked for you. If I remember correctly, you were too busy saying no one would work for you to find someone who worked for you.”
“I’m feeling much better, really.”  Putting his glasses on, Harry made himself stand up.
Harry sucked in a breath.  The truth was, he couldn’t be certain that he would have liked twenty-four-year-old Draco in this way, had he got to know him.  But Harry did know that he liked him now, so that was what Harry said.  “I like you.”  He took Draco’s hands, prying them off his cloak.  “I like you so much.”
Only rarely had their social connections interfered with his therapy, but Harry still remembered what she had told him from the beginning. She was helping him because she knew his particular special circumstances, and because he had been in a very bad place when Hermione had first reached out to her. Kavika had warned him, however, that when their personal lives intersected, she might not be able to help.
“No. That’s not what I’m saying at all.” Realizing he had lost all the calm he had just gathered, Harry abruptly stopped.
Harry frowned up at him in confusion.
Penelope had said, then an Auror.
.  I’m the one you tried to murder.”
24 years
Draco looked disgruntled.  “It’s morning.  That’s too early for fish and chips.”
“Yeah, a brown one?  Or a white one, with black spots?  And it hasn’t seen thirty-year-old me in days and days, so it needs to eat?”
“The Order of the Phoenix,” Savage announced, with the air of someone announcing a dire threat.
“Only when you’re too busy showing off to take care of a victim who is obviously traumatized,” Harry told him.
Diagon was in chaos. A non-mag automobile had crashed into the Leaky; a non-mag stood in front of Flourish and Blotts in a full-body bind while another non-mag shook her, screaming at her to wake up. The sound of shouting duels filled the air, bats from a Bag Bogey Hex; something was on fire. Fenrir was standing on the kerb.
“An astronaut?”
“Only one?” Malfoy said, barely looking up at him. “Better than I thought.”
“Why not?”
“Quickly,” Draco whispered.  Still holding Harry’s hand, Draco led them back through the cubicles, all the way back to where Savage had been standing when they had first seen her.  This time she wasn’t there, and Harry understood the cracking sound must have been Savage doing the disappearing spell.
“When you’re an Auror?” Harry asked. “I don’t know, maybe!”
and had admired the way Photsi stood against the dictatorship of the Council.
“I’ll
“Draco Malfoy tried to visit here,” Teddy said suddenly.
Putting the letter from Malfoy away, Harry took out a parchment, a quill. The educational facilities had only been mentioned in passing. They would need faculty, staff. They would need actual facilities. They would need classes, or at least some kind of structure—something like the Academy.
Harry stayed out for longer than he should have, not thinking about Malfoy in particular, but thinking that he could get what he wanted if he demanded it. But was it right? Life had proven that getting what he wanted didn’t always make things easier. He’d got Ginny, and look how that had turned out.
“But.”  Draco’s eyes searched his.  “But we . . .”  He bit his lip.  “I must help you,” he said, settling back against Harry.  “I help you in school, don’t I?  I’m the one that reads to you.  Do you like it, Harry?  Do you like it when I read to you?”
“Where’d you get it?” the driver wanted to know.  “Is it new?”
Draco laughed, that soft nice sound that Harry liked so much.  “You’re so shocked.”
“You know it isn’t like that.”
“Don’t worry,” Draco said, his voice swift and rough. “I’ll get it properly filled. You’ll still be nice and tight once I’m in. Tell me if you want me to undo it.” Then he pointed his wand back at Harry’s belly and drew down a line to flick along the curve of Harry’s cock, which had wilted just a little without the encouragement.
“Right.”  Malfoy turned away abruptly, beginning to clear the table.
Harry shrugged.  “He’d probably handle it better than I could.  And anyway, he’d get to go to school with you.”
“You keep watching the entrance. Are we waiting on someone?”
“I did think that.”  Draco picked up Harry’s hand again, touching the scar.  “But you were clear about what you wanted from me.  You were respectful of me and my abilities.  You . . . praised them.”  Draco glanced at Harry quickly.  “I go quite weak for praise, in case you haven’t noticed.”
Harry sighed. “You say just because I went through all that doesn’t mean I can’t be anxious about other things.”
“Christ.”  Harry rubbed his scar.  He couldn’t remember the last time he’d talked so much to anyone.  Goddamn Veritaserum.
Instinctively, Harry looked about, but Malfoy wasn’t there to extract him, as Malfoy so often was. Malfoy was standing guard outside the Academy that had expelled him, telling non-magicals all about it and handing out pamphlets like the rest of them.
“Instructor Potter,” a voice called, and Harry turned to see a group of his trainees.
“Do people really do it?” Harry had asked, after Draco had shown him.
“Do you fancy
,” he said, and burped out a butterfly.
“You’re not actually trying to catch it,” Harry complained at one point.  “You just keep showing me stuff.”
Fuck.
“Yeah, you can.”  Harry grinned.  “Tuck in.”
“Oh!” Draco jerked, his spine coming almost entirely off the bed but for his head.
Penelope leaned across the table toward Spragg. “Aurors are a little busy protecting the wizarding world from dark wizards to question your political opponents,
“She believes in the cause,” Parkinson assured him, “but as ever, is disinclined to action.”
What Narcissa and Lucius had made him believe was far less fair.
“Why don’t you put on your glasses,” Mister Malfoy said, handing them over.  “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to lie down?”
“That’s good. One less person trying to poison you is always great. I meant, rather—are they safe for him as well? People don’t always help themselves in the best ways.”
Hermione smacked him, then turned back to Harry.  “I didn’t mean it would be hard for him to be with you specifically,” she said.  “I meant, he must have been so scared.  Did he ask for his parents?”
Harry was pretty sure he was going to get one, seeing as how he’d get to go to a magical school where he had friends.  But maybe it wouldn’t be happy if Draco wasn’t one of them.
“Yes,” Harry said again, and the terrier disappeared.
Harry demonstrated the next hold with Fuentes, who next to Malfoy was a star pupil. Meanwhile, Malfoy lagged behind in the practice set, standing there staring before Achar waved a hand in front of Malfoy’s face to get his attention. Harry recalled the way Malfoy had stared at him when Harry had walked in, the way Malfoy was staring now. What if Malfoy still hated him, and that was all this was? It made sense.  If Harry had thought Malfoy worth the effort, Harry would have hated him right back.
“Draco,” Harry said, reaching for him.
“Who knows what he would do?” Harry asked, turning back to look at Ron. “He got his friends to dress up with him like Dementors just to scare me. He spent half of fourth year making badges about my—my personal odour.”
“Yes.”  Harry held up the potion.  “It’s turned a nice colour,” he said, because the swirling storm in the glass had resolved into something almost completely clear, with just a trace of blue.  This matched the colours that adult-Draco had predicted, so Harry was feeling pretty good about it.
Enough people knew that Harry wasn’t keen on Vance that Harry knew he needed help taking Ludville’s statement.  That way, Harry could be absolutely clear on the fact that the witness hadn’t been tampered with.  Ron wasn’t around, and he was Harry’s best friend anyway, so Ron wasn’t exactly the objective observer required for such a situation.  Neither was Savage, but she could at least help, so Harry told her what was going on.
“Right,” said Ron. “But you don’t now.”
“What is that?” Malfoy asked, horrified.
Harry felt the side of his mouth curl up. “That’s what Ron always says.”
Harry felt himself smile, even knowing she couldn’t see it. “That’s not fair.” She knew even the faint whiff of coffee threw him off any other scent.
look past the war. I look straight past it into the thousands of Galleons you’re pouring to the Council and Wizengamot and Diagon Association to sabotage the Deal, and why? Because there’s no profit in Reveal, and that’s all you care about. It’s all you’ve ever cared about.”
Harry had to hide his own smirk.  He’d learned long ago that Malfoy was easily distracted by potions.  Like a crow with shiny things, Malfoy just couldn’t keep away.  “They’re calling it Slumber Slam,” Harry said, watching as Malfoy took the bottle of powder over to a table and tapped some of it out on a glass plate.  “It makes you sleepier and sleepier, but we’re trying to figure out what the point is.  I mean, I can see how exhausting someone might make them easier to rob or something, but that’s not how it seems it’s being used.”
Frowning at them, Harry picked one up. It seemed to have something green in it as well as yellow, and the crust was flaky. “Fuck,” Harry said, after the first bite, which melted in his mouth like spinach butter.
Harry flicked his wand again, an invisible collar slowly drawing Alby up on his toes, rising and tightening around his neck.  “Who else?”
him, and it had been so long since he had felt this way. Harry couldn’t remember the last time this had happened.
.” Harry could tell he had been grinding his teeth against anger; it wasn’t good. He and Kavika had had arguments before about expressing anger. She told him he needed to let it out; he told her he was tired of being angry. He didn’t want it any longer.
“Voldemort.”
He took another, bigger sip.  And another.
Christmas at Old Wob that year was just a little gloomier. Though Hermione had taken her defeat in Council in stride, the resulting appointment of Fudge had caused her to dedicate herself that much more intently to negotiation of the Deal, which was mostly in pieces by now. Ron seemed stretched thin, supporting her, doing most of the care-giving for the kids, and still working his full-time job. The only bright spot was Nyala, who spent the hols with them instead of the Zabinis. Even that was tinged with melancholy, as Harry suspected Nyala was with them because the Zabinis did not want her. No wonder she got along so well with Malfoy and Astoria. And Rune Photsi, Harry reminded himself, because he could not avoid the stray copies of Molly’s
“Can you take it down,” Harry said again.  “I—I want to see it.”
“The Leaky will serve anything,” Harry said.  “Come on.  It will be fun.”
“I don’t understand.”  Malfoy frowned, his brow furrowed in such a poignant way.  “How could I get around them?”
Talking to those non-magical people had been good practice, but it could never prepare him for the variety of reactions any human being would have upon learning about a whole world of magic that had been hidden from them. As Harry talked to them—people who were afraid, people who were hopeful, people who were fascinated; people who thought wizards would cure cancer; people who thought witches were the devil; people who thought the apocalypse was upon them; people who thought gods had come to earth—he tried to remember what he himself had thought, when he had learned of the magical world, but he could not remember.
“Right,” Harry agreed, because he may have slept in Binns’s class, but he wasn’t completely ignorant. “Magical people were used to having the run of things in the Middle Ages and so on, but then—there was something about spice trade? And Magellan, or something.”
Draco stalked over to the table, picked up the glass and plate, then threw them into the hearth.  “What are you going to do now?” he mocked.
“Neither do swords. Or rabbits.”
“You hate me,” Draco said.  “And I hate you.  Even if you changed your mind . . .” Draco took a big wet breath.  “If you changed your mind, I’d still hate you.  I’ll hate you
Reading that letter, Harry wasn’t sure whether Draco could, and Harry wanted to save him from it.  He wanted to save Draco’s elder self from everything; he wanted to give child-Draco the cure and have him grow back up into someone who had some happy memories of Harry Potter in his childhood.  He wanted Draco to grow back up into someone who understood that he was more than his mistakes, that he could be loved in spite of them—he could be loved for the person he had become because of them.
“He won’t,” Harry said, “and you can’t. He’s
If the Council was found to be lacking confidence in Minister Fudge, a new coalition would form and appoint a new Minister, who could issue an emergency stay on Reveal. The new Minister would then be able to negotiate a proper Deal—otherwise, Reveal would proceed without any Deal at all.
The book Draco had given Harry’s younger self floated over from the bookcase.  ‘Wellbeday’ was embossed on the bottom in gold letters, either the author or publisher.
“Yes,” Draco said, stroking them together, squeezing. “Harry.”
to—” Harry cut himself off.
“Christ.” Harry’s cock was out and he was ready; he was so ready, but at those words he held himself over Draco and let his head drop down, brow pressing against Draco’s. “Christ,” Harry said again. “I don’t want to use you, Draco. I want to make love to you.”
Draco moved deeper into the fireplace.  “Malfoy Manor!”
“It shouldn’t take too long.” Things finally seemed to be wrapping up, so Harry turned from watching Teddy to find Malfoy, who was standing a little bit apart with Rune. Rune was talking with his animated smile and frankly gorgeous hands, and Malfoy had on that intent, listening look.
, and now you—”
of the sacrifice?”
“So overall you were sixty-two percent truthful?”
Wait.
“‘Talk,’” Malfoy said. “Cute. Do you say that to all the students you’ve failed?”
Much more carefully, Andromeda took a polite bite of dumpling, then wiped her mouth with a corner of her napkin.  She was watching him, Harry knew, but he pretended to be focused on his food.  The fawn was standing not far away, watching him also.  “Would you like to talk?” Andromeda said at last.
It wasn’t quite so funny, now.
“No,” Harry said.
?  What the fuck is wrong with you?”
Harry looked at him for a moment longer. “No, you haven’t.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said.  “Good on you. You’ve defended your Death Eater scum, and now that you’ve warned me off; you’re free to—”
“That’s why you took it,” Harry said.  “From my house; that was why you took the hair.”
“There.” Melting back into his own form, Teddy nodded across the street, where the real Fenrir was running toward Gringotts.
Harry wasn’t sure what Draco meant, but when he went into the bedroom Harry realized Draco was going to drink it in there, since he had to change his clothes first.  After Harry figured it out, he sort of wished he’d elected to go first.  Seeing himself be old wouldn’t be as nerve-wracking if he was already in Draco’s body.  Everything was probably better in Draco’s body.
“That was where it was from,” he explained.
Draco pulled off again. “Do it down my throat, Harry. Give me what I need. Give it to me right in my mouth; get it all over me; I want it all over me—”
“Then why have I got a whole house?”  Even if the house was narrow it was a lot of storeys, and it was in London.  Harry didn’t know anything about real estate, but it seemed like kind of a lot for one person.
“I did?”  Malfoy did that thing where he got excited and then pretended he didn’t care.  “I mean, obviously I did.  I was Slytherin, wasn’t I?”
“I only read books to people who are my friends.”  For a while, Draco watched the fire, the dancing flames making odd shadows on the floor.  “How did Vince die?”
Fifth year had been kind to Draco.  He’d got even taller, his forehead higher, his cheekbones sharper.  His lips had thinned, but his mouth was closer to that definite shape Harry remembered so well.  When Harry had seen Draco at Slug and Jiggers that first time, he’d realized Draco had been fit at Hogwarts.  Harry realized it now as well.
“Jesus.” Harry’s hips jerked again. “Draco.”
Draco made a face.  “Why are you asking, if you already know?”
“So, the flirtation continues?” Kavika gestured, and they both took their seats once more.
“Hate is for someone who’s worth it,” said Ron.
He wanted to wank it even more than he even wanted to have his own cock be wanked. The urge to make Draco feel good was so strong that Harry hardly realized he could put the drool in his mouth to good use before he was taking his hand off Draco’s cock.
By the next morning, Harry hadn’t found anything useful in the Ward Record.  Before going to Tailored Tinctures, Harry stopped by to see Andromeda.  He had sent her that owl when he had left eleven-year-old Draco alone, so Harry could go to the warehouse.  The note had explained the cure and what was happening with Draco, but Harry had been frazzled while writing it, and he wanted to update Andromeda to let her know what was happening with Ron and Hermione, the potions case, and Draco's cure.
Draco took a step toward him.  “Perhaps we should—”
Sometimes Ron and Hermione went on like this.  In fact, usually Ron and Hermione went on like this, after Rose and Hugo were in bed and just the three of them were alone together.  Harry never minded, but he used to wonder why they asked him to visit when he had so little to contribute, and they always had each other.  It had taken him a while to realize that they didn’t need him to help them or save them or bring up interesting things for them to do; he didn’t need to say things or do things so that they could remember why they liked him.  Having Harry around made Ron and Hermione happy, for whatever reason.  He could see it in their faces when he was around them.
Harry jerked away.  “I can do it.”  Grabbing the napkin, he accidentally forgot to concentrate on the loaded strawberry, which dropped on the table.  He just didn’t want Draco having to wipe his face for him—speaking of Petunia, she always did things like that for Dudley, but that was because Dudley actually
“Hm?”  Draco looked one way, then then the other, then tapped on the door with his wand.
These were simply things that Draco had been taught, like children were taught about Father Christmas.  Kids believed in Father Christmas not because of evidence presented, but because someone they trusted had said that it was true.  Someone Malfoy trusted had told him these things, and he had clung to them as a foundation of his world, but it wasn’t who Draco was.  It wasn’t.  Harry had seen it in who Draco had grown up to be—someone who helped Aurors and loved his mother and loved Teddy, someone who always fought his own battles and had served his time for mistakes that he had made.  Draco didn’t really believe these things; he couldn’t.
“I wanted you when you kissed me,” Harry said.  “I had some trouble—processing.  I thought—I thought the powder had affected me.”
“Do we?” Surprised, Harry looked up to Malfoy’s face, but Malfoy was concentrating on untying. “You know,” Harry said, shifting his weight, “this would go a lot faster if you wore less.”
“I just meant . . .” Harry wanted to rub the back of his hand, then didn’t. “I miss you.”
Harry turned away. “I’ve got Advanced Combat this afternoon. See me after, and we’ll work on the Patronus.”
What would Malfoy have done?
Draco fiddled with his cuff, but Harry could see Draco wasn’t actually doing anything with it; he was just yanking it down, and sort of rubbing his arm, as though it was itchy or hurt him.  “Remember I said—Dumbledore never married.  That sort of lifestyle.”
29 years
“But that’s what I mean,” Harry said.  “When you love someone, you always try so hard for them, and you never quit.  You stop thinking about yourself, and you’d—you’d do anything, sacrifice anything, and—it’s not a verbal promise.  It’s a deeper kind of promise.”
Draco didn’t sound angry.  He sounded scared.
So Harry thought about Malfoy. Tall. Rather inelegantly tall—gangly, bony, angles everywhere with only the dark hollows under his eyes for softness. Hair that had dulled since school, if the photos in the papers were any indication, his lips unpleasantly thin, his nose still long and sharp. Harry imagined Draco Malfoy and tried to determine how he felt about him, but all that remained in the wake of far too many feelings was exhaustion, an anger that had long since faded to indifference, and perhaps a little pity.
“Are you drunk?” Draco asked in a quiet voice.
“Darling, I told you to stay in the carriage. Come along.”
“Are you ready?” Neville asked them from the entryway. Smiling, Harry nodded and they strode to the dining area.
“Potter.” She said once she came into view.
“Do we know how far along he is?”
“Does it feel good?” Draco nodded again. Harry moved to replace his hand with his mouth on Draco’s tight nipple.
Harry regarded the other Alpha, she looked even more ethereal than usual. “How can I help you Minerva?”
“Can you play with me Mr. Harry?” Caleb looked up at him with wide trusting eyes. They were such a unique color, gray but silver in certain lights. Harry wanted to scream because all he saw when he closed his eyes were those eyes. But they were attached to a certain blonde his body and soul still ached for.
“Harry…. What are you saying?”
Draco stared up wide-eyed at his childhood friend. He had never told Harry how pretty he thought his eyes were or that he loved the way his one lock of black hair always flopped over his forehead in a way that made his heart feel warm. Draco knew they were only 8 but he thought he loved Harry maybe. He had heard his mama talk about love before and how she and Papa had fallen in love. Draco knew his heart felt warm and went kinda fast whenever he saw Harry and he always wanted to make the other boy smile. Draco had only told the older Alpha boys he would meet them in the garden because he was mad when Harry told him he and his family would be leaving soon.
“I am ready! Harry please!” Draco squirmed beneath him. Harry smiled, “let’s see then?” Harry brought a finger up to tease Draco’s hole. He pushed one inside and groaned when he felt how wet the Omega was. Slick was gushing from his hole and covered Harry’s finger.
Harry slapped his bottom again, “Oh is that how it’s going to be short stuff? Do I need to show you who the Alpha Prime is?”
Harry groaned. “Dray I didn’t mean it. I know that was stupid. I was just gone so long and I thought you found someone else….”
Harry stroked his thumb on Draco’s throat and drifted his lips across his Omega’s soft cheek. He got to Draco’s ear and lightly bit down.
Draco placed a hand on Harry’s chest and pushed him back. “Don’t even think about it Potter, I need a bath.”
“Ugh, short stuff you’re not making this easy.” Draco moved to sit in Harry’s lap.
“Where do you need me my mate?”
“Harry, I don’t think that it’s a good idea.”
Draco glared back at Harry and got in. He sighed as he sank in the water.
Harry watched as Draco straightened his shoulders. “Harry, you came back into my life. You claim you want me and the baby but I don’t understand. Why did you say those things all those months ago? What is different now?”
“You made it perfectly clear that I was no longer welcome in your life. So why would I tell you?”
Harry made a frustrated noise “What do you want then Draco? Because I am having a pretty hard time figuring it out. First you hide that you’re pregnant from me and then I find out Oliver Wood has been taking you out?”
Draco bit his lip and briefly popped his head up to see if the man was still there. Draco had recognized him from his dreams. The man’s size and hair had been an exact match. Draco hadn’t been focused enough to smell him but he knew it would be the earthy scent from his dreams. The man wasn’t there and Draco felt a stab of disappointment. He scanned the area looking for him when he heard someone clear their throat.
“Put me down!” Draco beat his small fists against the boy’s back.
Draco blushed “No, just taking everything in….and maybe daydreaming a little.”
Harry knew mates could communicate telepathically but he didn’t expect Draco’s mind to feel so comforting as he felt it within his own. As their bodies and minds merged Harry’s vision went red as both his and Draco’s lust combined.
Harry and Draco get nice and close this chapter! Enjoy my lovelies! :)
Harry stared at the house in front of him. It was a large townhouse in a classy neighborhood:  the house was white with black trimmings and a gate to the side which led to the background and what looked like a garden. Harry could see flowers popping up and figured Draco had a hand in that. The blonde had always loved gardening even when they were teenagers. Harry knew who Pansy Parkinson was and who most of Draco’s acquaintances were. They had all gone to the prestigious Hogwarts academy as children. However, most of their families were from old money, unlike Harry whose parents had made their fortune shortly before Harry was born. Harry owned over 200 hotels internationally now and dabbled in some other ventures as well.
Harry looked down at Draco. The small blonde looked so distraught and Harry couldn’t take it. Maybe this was for the best.
“Another email from Harry, dear?”
“Harry”
Pansy looked at him and essentially said without words he better play with his son or she would never sign off on his permit.
“Oh no, it’s okay. Just a really strong kick. Here, feel.” Draco took Harry’s large hand and placed it over his rounded belly. Harry’s hand felt warm and their baby responded by kicking right where Harry’s hand was. Harry looked shocked and looked at Draco.
Her words swelled over the crowd but Harry could only see Draco. As Minerva’s chants came to a close the music started. It was a sensual beat that mimicked the rhythm of mating. Their bodies began to move instinctually. Harry began to circle Draco, their bodies just barely touching as they moved to the beat.
“Never.” Harry whispered back.
“Love you Pans.”
“Don’t you dare! Harry James Potter I swear!” Draco gasped as he felt Harry bite down with his blunt teeth and not his canines. He felt Harry’s tongue lick the spot and slick started to leak from his hole.
“Yup, the whole gang. Ron and his mate Hermione are here too, even though she’s pretty close to delivering.”
“Hmmmm….?”
“Relax Dray, no one is going to look at the Alpha Prime’s mate naked.”
“Yay!”
Draco felt his vision go fuzzy at the edges and then all of a sudden his knees gave out. The last thing he saw before his vision blacked out was Potter’s concerned face and arms reaching for him.
“It’s okay Papa. Harry needs me right now and honestly I need him. Go on to the celebration dinner, we will find you all there to start planning.”
“What do you mean Harry?”
Hello lovelies!
Harry must have felt it through the bond because he grabbed Draco by the hips and thrust upwards.
Draco pulled out of Harry’s arms and walked over to the trunk with their belongings. Draco grabbed some clothes and began to dress. Harry watched Draco pull on a red tunic before he turned and said in a flat voice.
“Are you nervous Harry?”
“Let me guess. She voted no.”
The elevator chimed and Harry turned as Draco walked out. The blonde had on a white long sleeve tunic shirt, over brown leggings, and ankle boots on. He looked as beautiful as always. Harry’s gaze dropped to the blonde’s stomach and saw Draco carried a small bag that was strewn across his chest. Draco was clutching the strap and seemed nervous.
He sighed and got out of the car. Maybe he should talk to Oliver before they started trying for real. Draco absentmindedly walked into Pansy’s house and heard the sound of Caleb laughing. He smiled and headed towards the sound. Draco stopped short when he heard the responding masculine chuckle. He knew that sound. Draco rushed around the corner and dropped his bag when he saw who was playing with his son.
Harry didn’t know how much time passed before he got off of the floor. He got up and went into his office and stared at his computer. He felt disconnected from reality.
Harry arched one dark brow. “I am certainly....bigger.”
Enjoy!
Draco felt his heart shatter in that moment. He choked back tear and covered his mouth. Draco ran for the exit and ignored paparazzi who had been watching the whole scene. Draco didn’t look back as he ran down the street. He never wanted to see Harry Potter or his stupid hotel ever again.
“You were a great fuck baby, maybe one of the best. But you’re used goods now and I’m bored.”
“I don’t want you to leave me short stuff. But, I need to keep everyone safe and the only way to do that is to make sure you are somewhere protected when I accept the power transference. Our traveling party won’t even be safe to be around me because I would be on high alert the whole way to Blackwood with you there.”
Draco got out of the car as Mark opened the door and walked towards the doctor’s office. Draco heard the other door closed and felt Harry’s body heat as he came up to walk next to him. They walked through the sliding doors and Draco smiled at the receptionist.
“I don’t understand Harry…. Why are you being like this?”
“What is it?”
“It’s okay Harry, not only is your mate nearby but your father started the transfer of the Prime to you. I’m sure you’re feeling all sorts of amped up.”
Harry dipped his hand into the bowl filled with wet clay. He scooped enough out to appropriately make the markings. He moved closer to Draco and stared down at him.
“That was a mistake. I thought I was coming here to reconcile and all you wanted was to get your cock sucked.” Draco’s gray eyes flashed as he finally looked at Harry.
“Are you sore short stuff?”
“Very much so.” Mark closed the door and Harry slid in on the other side.
Draco looked up at him before he finally nodded his head and moved closer. “One kiss.”
“And what is that one thing Lucius hmmmm….?” Harry tapped his finger to his chin like he was really thinking on it.
“Draco, I don’t think you know if you want to rekindle things with your husband- baby or no.”
“I know you might be nervous, but do remember this shall be the most exciting week of your life should you find and claim your mate.”
Draco gave him a soft look and leaned forward to meet Harry for a kiss. Before they could get carried away he heard someone clearing their throat outside the tent. Harry smelled his father and knew that’s who was out there.
“Okay.” Harry said.
“The prettiest.”
Draco’s silver eyes gleamed and his mouth turned down into what Harry thought was a very cute pout. “I don’t like to see you in pain my Alpha.”
“I… um…” Draco was distracted as Harry’s hand moved up his leg again. His finger traced the seam of his bottom. Harry traced one finger around his rim before pushing in. Draco was still a little sore from earlier but he moaned as Harry’s finger brushed his prostate.
There will be a happy ending I promise! It just takes our boys awhile to get there.
“I don’t want him to look at us as an obligation Pansy. My child deserves more than that. I deserve more than that.”
“I look forward to catching up, Draco.” With that Harry walked away.
“Alpha Potter, may I speak with you?” Harry was drawn from his thoughts by the appearance of Minerva. She was a beautiful woman even in her advanced age. Long silver hair flowed down her back, while her blue eyes sparkled with mischief. Harry knew her story was a tragic one after losing her mate and child many years ago. Minerva never seemed to let the burden of her sadness stop her from living life to the fullest. He asked her once as a young child how she went on and she had simply said “for my mate darling, I live because she didn’t.”
Harry could apologize all he wanted but Draco was not doing this again. How dare that giant asshole insinuate Draco had slept with someone else?
Harry just kept looking at Draco’s belly with a look of awe. He was lightly rubbing Draco’s stomach which he didn’t seem to notice.
Harry continued to stroke Draco’s cock and moved his other hand under Draco’s shirt to one of his hard nipples.
Draco sat next to Pansy at the first dinner. There were so many sounds, smells, and emotions he almost couldn’t take it. Pansy grabbed his hand and gave it a squeeze for support. Draco gave her a weak smile in return and tried to focus on his breathing. The Omegas had been let in first, then the betas, and now the alphas were starting to arrive. Draco saw a flash of red hair and then his heart started pounding. There was a shorter brunette next to the red-headed Alpha but that was not who Draco’s attention was on. The most gorgeous man he had ever seen was standing there surveying all the tables. The man was tall, with black hair that was just a little too long in the front, muscles that looked like they could crush rocks, smooth tan skin, and Draco could feel the force of his dominance from all the way across the room. Draco started to feel hot looking at the man and was appalled to realize slick had started leaking from his hole. Draco watched as the man’s nose twitched and he started to look near their table. Draco squeaked in embarrassment and crouched down so he couldn’t be seen.
He stared as Draco reached out for the clay. Draco looked up at Harry as he began drawing the Omega symbol on his chest. Harry fought the urge to grab the Omega as his cool hands drifted over Harry’s hard abdomen. His small hands stopped just above Harry’s hard cock. Finished with their markings they stared at each other, unaware they had drifted closer. Draco’s silver eyes were heated as he stared at Harry. Harry groaned as Draco’s small tongue peaked out to wet his lips. Just as Harry was about to swoop down and taste Draco’s glistening pink mouth, Minerva cleared her throat.
“Yeah Dad?”
Draco looked around, “where is Harry?”
“I’m sure the Omegas are lining up for you Gin.” Harry said as he gave her a playful shove. Neville rolled his eyes, used to their banter.
Draco blushed. “Will they be nearby?”
Harry growled. “You swear what?”
“I’m aware.” Harry’s jaw clenched as Caleb ran back into the foyer. He was carrying a stuffed unicorn and his dark hair was in disarray.
Harry smiled down at the Omega and they walked hand in hand out of the woods.
Draco stared down at his phone with a scowl on his face. Yet another stupid email from Harry blathering about how he lost his phone and got a new one but he doesn’t have service and doesn’t have time to talk. Blah blah blah.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy the update. Harry has some things he needs to work on and will grow as a character, eventually.
“No, my mate!”
“Goodbye, Harry.”
Draco chuckled as he heard his son’s words from upstairs. Captain Joebob was the family dog. A somewhat surly but loveable bulldog. Caleb’s “uni” was his favorite unicorn toy that JB was particularly fond of chewing.
“Son?” His father asked in a quiet voice.
Harry growled and suddenly Draco was in Harry’s arms. Harry carried Draco over to the bed and they fell onto it. Draco sat and pushed Harry onto his back.
Draco nodded. Harry growled and came. Draco let out a hoarse cry as Harry’s knot began to swell and pushed against that spot inside him, which caused his vision to dim a little as aftershocks of pleasure hit him. Draco began to feel sleepy.
A few months after they met Harry had left for tour again and received a letter from Draco while he was on the road. The blonde had gotten pregnant and was having twins. Harry had immediately left the tour and gone home to find Draco. The two married right before Draco gave birth to the twins.
James nodded and patted him on the back. “I’m sorry son. I know this is a lot of responsibility being placed on you. But we both know you are too dominant for me to remain Alpha Prime and being newly mated? Son, you’re throwing off more pheromones than I can even explain.”
“Sign them Potter.” His husband’s musical voice had a hard edge to it. But, Harry had been drinking and he didn’t care if they had another fight. He wasn’t signing those papers.
“No. He made it very clear he doesn’t care about me. Why would he care about our baby?”
“Harry, you are Alpha Prime-Inherit, soon to be Alpha Prime. No one is looking at me.”
“Oh, okay. Well, that is sooner than I expected but I knew it would happen soon. But I’m sure it’ll be fine Harry. Plus, I’ll be there to help you.”
“Do you think you’ll find your mate at the Eros ceremony tonight?” She asked.
“Gentlemen, if you’ll please make the markings of fertility now.” Minerva stated.
Afterward he collapsed on top of the small blonde. “Oof.” Draco squeaked as he took all of Harry’s weight.
He and Harry groaned as Harry pushed into his tight heat.
Harry placed a mocking kiss on Draco’s lips and smirked. “Now get out of my hotel.”
Draco blanched. “What?”
“Draco. Stop that. You are strong and brave. You and Harry have been meant to be your entire lives. Are you going to let a little thing like a few months get in the way of that?”
“Are you going to come for Daddy?”
I did edit the tags so double check before reading.
Draco gasped. “A few months? We just mated! I’m pregnant. How can you ask me to leave you?”
“Ginny, this is an old childhood friend of mine Draco Malfoy, and this is his friend…….”
“Are you not wearing underwear? Naughty naughty baby.” Harry slipped his hands under the waistband of Draco’s pants and gripped his ass. He leaned down closer to Draco’s ear “do you need Daddy to fill you up baby?”
Draco made an agitated noise and slammed his hand down on the table.
Harry crushed his lips to Draco’s and swept his tongue inside. He thrust his hips against Draco’s and moaned at the feel of Draco’s hands sliding into his hair. Harry explored Draco’s mouth with his tongue and moved his hand around to grasp Draco’s thigh. He hooked his arm under the Omega’s knee and circled his hips against him. Harry tore his mouth away and began to kiss down Draco’s throat. He felt his fangs distend and paused right over the scent gland.
He was getting his husband back.
Harry Potter stared down at the divorce paper’s in front of him.
“Am I not a big strong Alpha? I can carry you there!” Draco squealed as Harry lifted him higher and tossed him over his shoulder.
“We will get through this Alpha. I promise.” Draco looked down at his flat stomach tenderly “and you too baby.” With that Draco set off to find his mate.
Draco sat stunned as he listened to Oliver leave. Marriage… a husband. That’s all Draco had wanted for a long time. He didn’t know what to think as he stared down at the ring. He barely noticed as Pansy came back in the room and sat next to him. She gently closed the ring box and took it off his lap.
“Come here.” Harry took the hand Draco offered and let himself be pulled in.
Harry turned away when there was only ash left. It has to be this way, they’re better off; he thought. He hoped one day maybe Draco would understand. He regretted that he had looked for the blonde all those months ago. It should have been the clean break he originally planned and now it was so much worse. But after Draco ran out of his hotel five months ago Harry had panicked and couldn't stand the thought of not seeing the blonde again. He had only been more intense in his desire to see Draco in the months he spent trying to find him. Harry hadn't been able to keep control on the wild emotions Draco brought out in him and had said and done things he knew would give Draco the impression he could be in their lives. But he couldn't. Harry meant what he said, nothing had changed. He was as broken now as he was then. It was time for both of them to move on with their lives.
************************************************************************************************************
“Oh short stuff, you can do anything you want to me. Maybe someday you’ll even stop blushing when you mention it.” Harry teased, his eyes flashed black as he pictured what Draco said.
Sighing he finished off his drink. It has to be this way. You’ll only destroy him and the now there is a child, Harry mused.
“There, there darling. You only mildly embarrassed yourself in front of the most powerful Alpha Prime-Inherit to exist in centuries. It will all work out.”
“Caleb what have I told you about answering the door sweetpea?” Pansy’s voice grew louder as she appeared around the corner.
“I’m kidding, I’m kidding, but we really do need to get you some new outfits.”
Draco was drawn from his thoughts by the door opening and the face of his best friend Pansy appearing. Pansy was a siren and it was very apparent in her current outfit. Pansy’s curvy body was clad in a skintight red dress to match her bright red lips. Pansy smiled at Draco and tossed her long dark hair over her shoulder.
Hi lovelies, sorry for the delay it has been a bit busy over here. I do want to say that I appreciate everyone who has given kudos and feedback.
“Of course, make sure you put it with our bags.”
Harry looked down at him and smirked, “I wouldn’t want anyone to be overwhelmed by my sexy body and go into labor.”
“What does my pretty Omega want? Do you want my tongue?”
It was so cold in the house but Draco was too lazy to get up and turn off the heat. He had been laying around “moping” as his mother said since he sent Potter the email. It had been 24 hours with no response. Did Harry not care? Maybe he didn’t get it? Draco’s mind couldn’t stop picturing scenarios. Maybe, Harry had met someone and was making passionate love to them.
“Draco….”
Harry woke up suddenly, he realized his cock was rock hard and looked down as Draco took it into his mouth.
Harry’s eyes flashed and he moved away from Draco. “I’m not the marrying type Draco. You knew that when we started this.”
“I’m Harry Potter.”
“Stop it.” He said to himself out loud. Draco told Harry about the baby and that’s all he can do. The next move is Harry’s.
“Ginny, Neville, I hope you had a nice week at the festival.” Draco knew Neville hadn’t found his mate but the Beta seemed to be doing okay at the moment.
Narcissa gave Draco a look and went past them inside. Draco moved back into the foyer as Harry came inside. Draco felt caged in by Harry’s big body.
Harry smirked as he took in Draco’s flushed face and winked. Draco narrowed his eyes and began to remove his clothing. Harry watched with anticipation as Draco removed first his shirt and pants. As each new inch of creamy pale skin was revealed Harry had to work harder to control himself. Draco was perfect. The Omega was petite and slim but had strong, muscular thighs, beautiful pink nipples that Harry wanted to get his mouth on, and an adorable small cock. Draco was hairless, as are all the fey, and the tips of his cute pointed ears were red as he met Harry’s gaze.
“I’m sure it’s nothing.” He said to himself.
“Do you think you are possibly carrying an elephant in there?”
Draco blushed and looked up at Harry. “Inside me.”
“Can you still feel me inside you my little Omega?”
Harry turned and dropped to his knees as the girls threw themselves into his arms. Narcissa followed at a sedate pace behind.
“I’m sorry. It’s better this way for both of you.”
Harry groaned at the feel of Draco’s warm mouth enveloping his cock. The blonde used his hand as well as he couldn’t fit all of Harry’s large cock in his mouth. Harry felt his eyes go black as his Omega sucked his cock.
“Always so demanding my bossy Omega. But I aim to please.” Harry pushed his tongue beyond the tight rim and Draco ground down against Harry’s mouth. Harry lapped at his hole a few more times before moving back up his Omega’s body. He kissed Draco deeply.
Draco nodded and looked off towards the family tents, he hoped it would be enough. He brushed a hand over his stomach. Fae had longer pregnancies they were generally 11 to 12 months and required different things at different stages of the pregnancy. For the first few months Draco would need to be around the water and surrounded by familiar connections. In Omega pregnancies Fae generally can feel needier or strive for the attention of their Alpha. He also knew that their sex drive could increase exponentially. Towards the end of the pregnancy Draco would have to spend most of his time resting as his body shifted and prepared to give birth. He also would not be able to use magic the last month. There were so any things to consider in the time to come. Before he could get too lost in his thoughts he smelled his mother’s scent. She always smelled of vanilla and books, comforting.
“Draco” Lucius said sternly.
Harry Potter sat on the floor in a business suit with their son.
“Marry me. Be my husband, let’s raise this baby together and have 5 more. I love you Draco Malfoy and I don’t want to spend another minute without you.”
“We should probably get going, we want to get a good spot at one of the tables” Neville said. Harry nodded and the three of them fell in to step as they headed towards the outdoor dining area where the first dinner was being held.
Caleb took Draco’s face in his little hands and gave Draco a kiss on the cheek. Draco laughed and hugged his son before putting him down.
Draco moaned as Harry thrust inside his tender opening. Harry’s hands gripped his hips digging in as he moved inside Draco. Harry kept hitting that spot inside Draco until his cock was hard and leaking. He thrust his hips back at the Alpha as he felt his orgasm building again.
Draco swooped to pick up Caleb, “you’re getting so big! The doctor is not going to hurt me and is there to help make sure we all stay healthy.”
Draco titled his head up for a goodbye kiss. “Bye Ollie, see you soon.”
Draco and Oliver had been taking things slow but it was nice. Draco felt comfortable and safe with Oliver. He had even come over last weekend to help Draco set up the nursery for the baby and was going with him to an appointment later today. Draco hadn’t been ready to find out the gender until now. He still ached whenever he thought of Harry. Draco was determined that he would move on and be positive, for his baby’s sake.
“If you are going to be an asshole I don’t have anything to say!” Draco started to walk towards the door. Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him close. Draco’s belly bumped into Harry’s hard abs and he looked up in surprise.
“I’m not yours Harry. I’m just a great fuck remember?” Draco spat the words out.
“I don’t do love.” Harry said coldly. Draco stared up at the man he thought would be his forever. Harry’s black hair was messy as usual, slightly covering his lightening shaped birthmark which all the gossip magazines said made his bad body look hotter, his green eyes were distant and framed by the thickest dark lashes. Harry towered over Draco’s petite frame at 6 foot three and had a toned body that came from Harry’s love of rock climbing and fucking. His skin was sun kissed and smooth, Draco knew because he had spent many hours admiring Harry’s naked body. Harry reached out one of his big hands and cupped the back of Draco’s head. He brought his face close and put his lips to Draco’s ear.
“Ugh, spare me oh great Alpha-Prime!” Ginny being a vampire had some resistance to Harry’s dominance and they had been friends since they had met in training as young Alphas.
“He lives with Miss Pansy Parkinson sir. 118 Lovett Drive.”
“Hi Cho, this is the father of my baby Harry.”
“Sorry Pans, pregnancy brain. No, Oliver offered to take me.”
“Don’t sweetheart me!”
“I know you must be feeling better if you have time to be sassy.” Harry stated from the doorway.
“Hi, how can I help you?”
Harry looked down at the blonde and nudged him towards the bathroom. “Go.”
“Draco, you know you can call me Hermione, I’m not your teacher anymore. I am feeling like a small house.” Draco, Pansy, and Hermione all laughed and turned as Hermione’s large mate appeared behind her.
“Scared short stuff?” He taunted Draco. The small Omega didn’t back down and instead looked up at him and said “You’re not the big bad wolf you think you are Potter.”
Harry stared down at the small blonde in his arms. He was still in semi-shock that he had found his mate on the first night of the festival and was mated. His wolf instincts hadn’t let him knot Draco in the forest but he was unable to hold back in the tent. He didn’t think he hurt the blonde but he would check later after Draco napped. His father had told him about knotting but not how mind blowing it was.
“It won’t be the same. What will we tell them?”
“You need to rest before your heat starts. I’m going to grab some food and let the attendants know what’s going on.”
“I am not even going to dignify that with a response.” Harry grabbed Draco by the neck and pulled him close.
“We’ve been trying Harry and nothing has changed! You aren’t happy! I don’t…want you to be unhappy.” Draco brushed at the tears streaming down his face.
Harry stared down at Draco’s small hand laced in his. The door opened and a woman with very curly hair and a nice smile came in.
Harry’s eyebrow lifted. He was always doing stuff like that and making him look older than his eight years.
“I don’t know if he has realized yet.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s small hand and brought it to his lips for a kiss. “Don’t shed any tears for my past, love. Your parents were right to keep us apart at that time. There is a chance my presentation could have triggered yours and that would have been traumatic for you. But, I appreciate the sentiment.”
Draco moaned and covered his head with his pillow as his best friend Pansy Parksinson walked in.
“I got it bud.” Draco heard Oliver’s deep voice call back. Draco smiled. He and Oliver had been married for four and a half years now and Oliver was the ideal husband and father. Draco’s smile faded as he thought of the conversation he and Oliver had last night.
Draco blinked and tried to hold back the tears he could feel forming. He sniffed and looked down at the ground. “But I love you.” He whispered.
Harry helped Draco into the car and then went around to his side. He slid in the seat next to Draco and just stared at the blonde.
“Dray darling?”
“You had to see your son at some point Potter.”
A sharp tap on the carriage door brought Draco back to focus on the surroundings. He gasped as the brilliance of the Hogwarts Valley came into focus. Thousands of tents had been erected and Draco could feel the excitement and anticipation from his seat. He could smell the delicious scents of meats cooking and hear voices singing. The Aphro festival brought out every creature and their families to celebrate. Draco had attended once as a child before he presented when his distant cousin Fleur found her mate. Fleur was a Veela and her mate Bill was a dragon shifter. Long ago there had been war between the species, led by a man named Voldemort who believed there should be a separation of the species.
“She said she would reconsider her vote if you met with her in person.”
Harry heard the sound symbolizing it was time for everyone to return to their seats.
“Draco, look at me.” Harry put his hand under the Omega’s chin. “Are you okay? I know this is a lot.”
Harry pulled Draco close again and leaned down to kiss him. “But I am your pervert” he said as he brought his lips down on Draco’s.
Harry reached his arms out and wrapped them around Draco’s waist. He pulled the blonde in close. He reached one hand up to stroke Draco’s face, memorizing the feel of his soft skin. Harry leaned in close and rubbed his nose along Draco’s cheek. Draco closed his eyes and Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s. They both moaned at the contact and Draco opened his mouth wider for Harry to thrust his tongue inside. Harry cupped Draco’s face as he plundered the blonde’s mouth.
**********************************************************************************
“Draco, just call me James. You are mated to my son after all.”
“Thank you.”
Pansy looked at him sharply for a moment and then sighed. “Just be careful darling.”
“Can you take my knot again little Omega?” Harry’s eyes were completely black, his fangs were out, and the hands that gripped his hips were clawed.
Draco moaned as Harry gripped his ass harder and ground his hard cock against him. Harry licked up the blonde’s neck and bit his ear.
This went on for only a few moments before the quill lay down again.  Picking up the parchment, Draco blew on it, then folded it and slipped it into the scarlet robe.
“Does that kind of tree live a long time?” Malfoy tilted his head. “Oh, wait, you don’t know, do you, because what kind of tree is it? A Timothy Tree isn’t a species of tree, Potter, colloquially or magically or even non-magically scientifically. I checked.”
“They can’t really . . .” Harry grimaced. “They’re not going to. Are they?”
“The wrong sort,” Draco said, shoving the drawer back into the desk.
“Good,” Harry said, remembering what Draco had said to him. He rubbed Draco’s back. “Good, you looked so beautiful. You’re so beautiful. I love you.”
“Wow,” Harry said. “I can’t. . . I really can’t say anyone’s ever called me that before.”
glasses,” Draco murmured, and the glasses fit themselves to Harry’s head.  “Here’s your wand back,” Draco said, giving it over.  “Go get changed.  I’ll change as well, then make you lunch and tell you what I know.”
“Yes, but if I
The Higgledy Piggledy was a magical pub in Cambridge, a little ways away from the Academy. The pub drew trainees, instructors, and alumni alike with its homebrew lagers, excellent menu, and superb speakers, which were synced to the wireless. This made it a popular venue for magical world events: the big Quidditch matches mainly; the Wizarding World Cup certainly; but also, the trials. When Harry was still a trainee, his fellow trainees, instructors, and Aurors had gathered by the pub wireless to hear sentences for war criminals.
Harry had passed through the room earlier, but he hadn’t really paused for inspection.  Several tables surrounded them, with cabinets and three hearths along the walls.  The hearths all had pots in them—big round black pots, like the kind witches used, and the tables had the glass equipment Harry had imagined.  Some of the glass spheres and tubes even had liquid bubbling in them, though nothing looked about to explode.  Other things were on the tables as well—plants, powders, small bags and large containers full of what seemed to be beetles, feathers, and eyes.  A stone dish with beautiful writing carved into it sat right next to a jar with a brain  in it.  Cutting boards, knives, spoons, feather quills and parchment were scattered between all the materials, and Harry knew his mouth was hanging open.
“Harry! Someone will see, please don’t…. oh oh my god.”
Draco stood up and looked down at his belly. “Just you and me baby.”
Draco nodded and leaned his face back into her shoulder, “can you hold me a little bit longer?”
Harry continued his path downward and lightly bit Draco’s collarbone. The blonde squirmed in his arms grinding his cock against Harry.
Harry looked to the side at the street wondering why Draco was staying here at not at his parent’s estate in France. Draco’s parents adored him but they had not been fond of Harry. He remembered his first time meeting them it had been early on when Harry and Draco had first started fucking.
“Daddy, Daddy. You’ve been gone so long! I lost a tooth and Riley got new dance shoes! We missed you Daddy. Why were you gone so long?”
“Draco, I know this might seem crazy and rash. Which, it probably is. But, I love you and I know you have a lot on your plate right now but you don’t have to do this alone. I want to be here for you and the baby.”
“Dray we have to get you some maternity clothes. You can’t keep squeezing into sweatpants darling.”
“I want you to get a good view of our baby.”
“It’s not you that wouldn’t be safe. I would be a danger to anyone that got close to you or even looked at you in a way that could set me off. I was outside for five minutes while you were in here bathing and I had the whole festival basically on its knees! You’re only a week pregnant at most Draco and I’m already out of control.”
“Oooh!” Draco gasped and reached to hold his stomach.
“Pervert!” Draco said as he laughed.
“I think that’s exactly why we need this. You need to figure that out.”
Harry picked Draco up and set him down off of his lap. Harry stood and climbed out of the tub. He paced back and forth while Draco watched him with concern.
“I don’t think that’s true Harry.”
“Somehow I think the babies will manage to stay in there.” Draco said in a dry tone. Harry just continued to grin.
Draco let out a breathy sigh, “Harry” and threaded his hands through Harry’s hair. The blonde pulled Harry back to him for another kiss. Harry lavished Draco’s mouth with his tongue and finally felt the tightness in his chest ease. He had felt this weight on him ever since the night Draco left, but now the blonde was back and Harry wasn’t going to let him go again.
*************************************************************************************************************************
“Because, what if nothing changed? What if this is all because Harry can’t stand the idea of someone else having what he classifies as his?”
He heard their little feet tromp down the stairs as they headed towards the kitchen. Draco sighed again and grabbed his phone off the sink. He opened up his contacts and selected Harry’s number.
Mark nodded and got into the car.
“Harry…” Draco’s beautiful silver eyes were filled with tears.
“What are you blushing at over there short stuff?”
“I’ll get it.” Pansy said and rose from the sofa.
Hi my lovelies! I am so sorry for the delay. My muse left me for a bit and life was hectic. Thank you so much for all the lovely comments and kudos!
“Pans, I told you I had a doctor’s appointment.” The blonde said dryly as he got out of the car. Harry watched as they moved towards the entrance. He got out and called after “I won’t give up Draco. I’ll be back tomorrow.”
As Harry was leaving he heard the blonde whisper, “don’t be gone long mate.”
“Now begins the Chase!” Harry looked at Minerva as she yelled and looked back to see Draco running towards the forest. The omega looked back and shot Harry a saucy grin.
“UGH!” Harry groaned as he watched his phone sink into the water. He had jumped into the fishing boat and it had fallen out of his pocket. He didn’t know when he would be able to get a new phone but didn’t have much time to dwell on it as Yu-En waved him forward.
“Hello my beautiful children, welcome to the first dinner.” Draco looked up as Minerva’s voice rang out. Minerva was dressed in the ceremonial garb with a long purple robe and her silver hair unbound.
Harry couldn’t help but touch the smaller man. He cupped Draco’s cheek and put the other hand lightly around his neck. “We both know you like it rough baby. Ollie’s too nice for that.”
“Well, I mean..it’s been so long and you are so much bigger.” Draco said as he stared up at Harry. He wanted to cut his tongue out when he realized what he said.
Did everyone figure out who Pansy's mate is? *cheeky smile*
“Uh…Harry?” He heard Neville say.
Maybe this baby would change Harry for the better.
“Shut up Potter. You are going to go in there and spend time with our daughters whom you haven’t seen in 6 months and how convenient for you that you brought presents. Too bad their birthday is next month. But I imagine you have forgotten that at this point.”
Whatever Harry had been about to say was cut off by the happy shrieks of their daughters. “DADDY!” The twins yelled and ran up the walkway.
Hello lovelies!
“Is that so?” the man said with amusement. Draco felt like his entire body was blushing. He had never been so embarrassed and turned on at the same time. Finally, Draco, turned around and found himself staring into green eyes that were both beautiful and familiar.
Draco frowned and looked up at Harry. “Why wouldn’t it be safe? You would never hurt me Harry and I’m not afraid of your dominance.”
Draco was quickly losing any coherent thought as he felt the pleasure build. He began to move up and down on Harry’s thick cock. Draco increased his pace until he was bouncing up and down and his climax was so close. Harry flipped them over and began to thrust into Draco.
“Dray are you alright? Why aren’t you eating?”
Sorry for my absence. I hope you enjoy the update.
“You don’t know that, Potty-head!”
Harry was in a daze as Dr. Granger and Draco finished up the appointment. Luckily, Draco was still letting him hold his hand or he didn’t know how he would have made it out of there.
“Harry, I just. I need a few moments okay?” Draco had turned and was looking at Harry with a distraught expression on his face.
“Gross!” Draco suddenly heard his 5-year-old say. He laughed and pulled away from his very aroused husband. Oliver stayed with his back to them while Draco ran towards his son with hands extended.
“So will you Dray.”
“Alright, gentleman everything is looking good so far. Everything looks right on track for development. Are you two ready to know the sex?”
Harry and Draco followed Cho as the went to the exam room. After weighing Draco, taking his blood pressure, and asking all the routine questions Cho said the doctor would be in to do the ultrasound.
“Draco….” His father said tentatively.
Harry finished pouring his drink and threw it back with one swallow. He walked over until he was right in front of the blonde.
“Ex-husband.”
“I wasn’t asking.” Harry smiled at him “you’re mine baby and its time you realize that.”
“UGH!” Draco groaned and threw his phone on the bed. He didn’t know why he was so reluctant to tell Harry he was pregnant. But every time he typed out the words something stopped him. He didn’t want to do that again. He didn’t want a baby to be the reason Harry comes back. Draco’s feelings for his ex-husband were so confusing it gave him a headache if he thought too long about the idiot.
Hello lovelies! I'm sorry for the delay on the update. I hope you enjoy it.
Draco rolled his eyes and turned over. Harry felt his amusement over the bond.
“I didn’t lie to you. When we started this I told you I don’t do relationships. You knew what you were getting into. So drop the offended virgin act Draco. We both know you wanted it.”
His buzzer rang. Harry walked over to the intercom on the wall and pressed the button. “Yes?” He said sharply, he wasn’t in the mood for disturbances.
“They already know we aren’t living together. We can explain further when they get a little older.”
“Hi Dr. Granger, I have been feeling okay. This is Harry, he’s the baby’s father.”
Finally, Harry pulled out a piece of paper to write Draco.
Draco pulled his arm free of Harry’s grip and walked to Oliver’s side. “I am so sorry Ollie. I should have told you who the baby’s father was I just wasn’t ready.”
“Draco Malfoy?”
Draco stared defiantly back at him until Pansy drew his attention away.
“Of course Sir.”
“That’s my child your carrying Draco!”
Harry paused for a moment and then booked the ticket. He hit print and then grabbed the paper as he ran out of the room. He grabbed all his necessary travel documents and packed a bag with everything he felt like he would need. He wrote a quick note to the housekeeper that he was leaving for an undetermined amount of time and to contact him by email if needed.
Draco’s silver eyes looked between Harry and his father before he finally nodded and went through the door.
“Drive safe love.”
“Say it. Say you want this short stuff.”
I hope you enjoy the update! :)
Harry wiped Draco’s cum off his hand and then wiped the blonde’s rounded belly. After he finished he stared at Draco as the blonde sat with his eyes closed, relaxed. Draco really was beautiful. His white-blonde hair was only slightly mused and his long blonde eyelashes lay on his cheeks. Their son would be beautiful, Harry thought.
“Goodbye, Draco.”
“I love you too my Caleb bee.”
Draco suddenly froze and stiffened in his arms. “Harry, put me down.”
Pansy’s smile turned wicked “Imagining that big Alpha mate of yours swooping you into his arms and carrying you away to ravish you?”
“Where to sir?” Mark’s question snapped Harry back to reality. They might be having a child but things were far from right between him and Draco.
“Are you ready? It might hurt love, I’m sorry.”
“Harry…. I want love, I want a marriage. You can’t give me those things.”
“Bribery. How fatherly.” Draco said in a snarky tone.
Harry ignored the hot lance of pain he felt at the thought of Draco marrying Oliver, of never seeing his son, and Draco growing old with someone else. He wanted Draco to be happy. Harry knew he would never be the one to make Draco happy. After all, Potter's only know how to cause pain. Harry was living proof of that. He would keep his distance from now on. It was the only way Draco could be happy.
He and Pansy turned their forms over to Hermione and picked up their identifying name badges. Draco’s was a green shaped acorn tag to symbolize he was Fae and had a red circle around his name indicating he was an Omega. The tags were only meant to be worn during the first dinner given the unlikelihood they would stay intact after the First Chase. Draco and Pansy stepped to the side of the table while they waited for their parents to make their way over from the carriage.
Draco took a deep breath and composed himself. It’s going to be fine, he thought. He opened the bathroom door and headed out.
“Draco…..” Harry didn’t complete his thought as the door opened. Pansy Parkinson stood there.
“Dray, that’s possible. But, you need to know one way or another darling. It’s the only way you can move on.”
“Sleep tight Omega.”
“Can I see my mother please?”
“That’s true.” They both laughed.
Harry slapped Draco on the bottom “lead the way short stuff.”
“Hello.” He said to his son.
“I think you know, you’re an animal.” Draco said cheekily. Harry stopped and pulled Draco into his arms. His large hands slid down to cup Draco’s bottom.
“Gentlemen, I will now bless all those present today with fertility and good fortune.” Minerva gestured for them to each place a hand on the other’s clay marking.
“Lucius?” The older blonde turned to look at his wife who had appeared. Narcissa looked lovely. Her tall, thin frame was clad in a long silver ball gown and her dark hair was swept up revealing her elegant neck.
(See the end of the chapter for
Oliver cleared his throat. “Listen, I’m sure you guys have a lot to discuss but we have to go if we are going to get to your appointment on time Draco.”
“Nothing has changed baby. I am exactly who I was 5 and a half months ago when I told you I don’t do love. I don’t do relationships and I especially don’t do families. I suffered a momentary lapse in judgement when I found out you were pregnant but that’s over now. I made a mistake when I sought you out.”
Harry laughed. “Oh, don’t worry. I’ll be eating you soon enough.” With that Harry reached out and drew the Alpha symbol on Draco’s smooth chest. His skin was soft and cool to the touch. Harry could hear Draco’s heart rate pick up and was surprised to find his was as well. Draco gasped as Harry finished the design right above his groin. Harry almost groaned as he smelled the slick which was leaking from Draco’s hole.
“Sweetheart, I need you.” Harry said in a guttural voice.
He squeezed his mother one last time and nodded. “I think so.”
“You’re the best Pans. My baby is lucky to have you as an auntie.”
Draco groaned and moved his head. Harry frowned as he saw dried tears on Draco’s face. “Omega, what’s wrong?”
“Draco, I want you to know that as future Omega Prime I will protect you and your child with my life. Harry has asked me to accompany to the Fae lands and protect you in his stead.”
“Harry, it’s not going to magically solve anything if I just move in with you. I don’t want that.”
“Oh, I understand you perfectly.” Harry said.
Draco watched from the carriage window as his father talked with the Alpha Prime. He didn’t see Harry anywhere and desperately wanted to talk to his friend.
“I don’t know Pans…Part of me wants to but I also would like to enjoy the festival a little!”
“You’re being a child Harry. I moved out months ago. Which, you asked me to do might I add.”
“Oliver is stable, kind, and dependable Harry. He actually WANTS to marry me.”
“Draco, this doesn’t mean anything okay? You’re still my mate and the love of my life.”
Harry laughed with him. “He’s always been it.”
Draco was brought back to the present as he narrowly dodged a low hanging branch. He had finally made it in the woods but he knew Harry wasn’t far behind. It seemed the Alpha was never that far from Draco, in mind or heart.
Draco pondered her words. He looked at the creatures around him; everyone was vibrating with energy and some creatures were showing off their powers in order to draw attention to a potential mate. Draco watched as a shape shifter change into a goat while onlookers giggled and cheered him on. Draco could feel the pull of a nearby lake and the refreshing lure of water. It’s not that he didn’t want a mate, he did. It’s all he had been dreaming of since he was 14.
Harry paled and looked absolutely wrecked. Draco almost felt guilty. Harry had hurt him too much though he couldn’t back down.
“Send him up.”
“I think your dad might have a plan for that.” Ginny said and then nodded towards the family tents.
“I’m scared. What if I’m not a good mate?” Draco asked Pansy quietly.
“No, it’s fine. Set up a meeting.”
“You want me baby?” Harry planted kisses on Draco’s cheek as he moved his mouth towards the blonde’s neck.
Draco and Harry headed towards the elevator. Harry put his hand on Draco’s back as they walked into the elevator. He shot Harry a look and moved away.
“Very supportive, mother.” He said in a dry tone.
“Harry please…I need you.”
“We discussed a lot of things. But you know what I remember? How you moaned my name while I bent you over this table a month ago on our anniversary.” Harry stood up and moved into Draco’s space. He watched as Draco swallowed and avoided his gaze.
“You’re a life saver.”
“What about the twins?” They had 4-year-old twin daughters Riley and Dylan. Draco had taken the girls when he left to go stay with his mother.
Harry pulled back and whispered against Draco’s lips “such a naughty boy for Daddy, not wearing any underwear.”  Draco thrust his hips towards Harry’s hand. Harry chuckled and pressed his lips to Draco’s for another kiss.
The car stopped and Harry looked out as they reached Parkinson’s house. He didn’t want to let Draco out of his sight.
Draco knew that Pansy had been kissed before and she told him of a few encounters with a Beta boy named Blaise in their village. Draco had never been kissed or even touched by another boy. He and Pansy had practiced kissing once but it had been a rather wet and awkward experience for the both of them. In some of Draco’s dreams about his mate the Alpha took him into his arms and would bring his lips close to Draco’s before the dream would end and he would wake up with his cock hard and slick flowing from his hole. Draco had a feeling Pansy was right.
“Oh yeah. Draco loves the way I ride that tight ass of his.” Harry said as he looked Lucius in the eyes. They were only an inch or two apart in height unlike Draco who’s head barely made it to Harry’s shoulder. Lucius and Narcissa were very tall and imposing people. Harry had no clue how they had created such a delicate son.
Harry nodded. “How gallant of you Oliver to offer to escort Draco to that appointment. You will however, no longer be needed as I will be taking him.”
Harry knew it aroused the blonde when he talked dirty. They had always had an intense sexual connection. Harry was Draco’s first and he intended to be the blonde’s last.
Harry leaned in to kiss Draco. The blonde moaned and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. Harry might not do love but he could do this. He knew how to make Draco moan and beg for Harry to fuck him. They could figure out having a kid together, as long as Draco was with Harry it would be fine. He would show the blonde man that.
Harry met Lucius’s gaze head on. The older blonde looked furious. They had had business dealings previously and Harry knew how much Lucius and his wife Narcissa doted on their son. Harry could feel the disapproval radiating off of Lucius. Honestly, Harry thought he couldn’t blame Lucius. Harry probably wouldn’t want his only child messing with someone like him either. Harry was notorious in the business world for his ruthless attitude and playboy ways. Harry was 5yrs older than Draco’s 23 and he had taken the young blonde’s virginity on top of his very expensive Lamborghini. Harry liked to play hard, fuck hard, drive fast, and didn’t care for anyone’s rules. His parents had died three years prior and he had been growing their family fortune since. That was his only goal. He didn’t want a boyfriend or a husband and he certainly didn’t want children.
“I am.”
Draco’s eyes widened at Harry’s words. He had been waiting his whole life to be mated and now he was. It was surreal to hear those words come from his childhood friend.
Draco sniffled and said with tears running down his face, “I wanted Harry to be the one asking me to marry him. Is that stupid?”
“Are you okay Dad?” His son looked at him with worried eyes.
“Professor Hermione, it’s so good to see you. How are you feeling?” Hermione rubbed a hand on her belly while looking between Pansy and Draco.
Thank you all so much for your patience! I hope you enjoy this update.
“You’re going to be my Omega.”
“Draco!” Pansy waved a hand in front of his face. “Are you going to sign the registration?”
“Potter?” He gasped.
“Good, baby. Let them all see how their society prince likes to be fucked dirty by me.”
Before things could go any further Harry heard a loud “Ahem.” They both turned their heads and Draco squeaked. There was Lucius Malfoy standing there with one eyebrow raised and a disdainful look on his face.
“I am going to knot you short stuff, I can’t hold it back this time.”
“Well you said you weren’t the father type either!” Draco said heatedly. “So I don’t know why you’re so shocked I wouldn’t tell you about the baby.”
“No. I don’t think I am.”
Oliver cupped his cheek tenderly “it’s okay Draco. I had a feeling the baby was Harry’s and I knew he wasn’t going to stay out of your life. But I’ve loved you for a long time Draco and I’m not about to just give up. So call me later.”
“Sleep short stuff.” Draco huffed at being told what to do but drifted off in the embrace of his Alpha.
“Fucking super sperm that bastard.” Draco sighed and raked his hands through his hair. He heard giggling outside the door.
“I know darling. Harry just needs time.”
“I don’t know that we can make each other happy anymore. All we can seem to do right is have sex and make babies.”
“Bye Papa!” Oliver planted a kiss on Caleb’s head and shut the door. Draco closed the trunk door before coming around to get in the driver’s side. Oliver pulled Draco into a hug.
Draco’s heart squeezed. His baby was 5 years old but would still occasionally cuddle with him or say Dada like he used to.
Harry sighed. Pansy had done many things in the past five years to get Harry to reach out to Draco and their son. She took great pleasure in opposing him anytime they came into contact. Luckily, his business brought him all over the world. But, he had decided to build his club close to home.
Harry stood and watched as Draco did the same from his table. They walked towards the front where a space was cleared for the dance.
Ginny looked away first. “Right, well nice to meet you both. Come on Harry.”
“I love you Draco. I don’t know who I am without you.”
“Yes.” Harry and Ginny strode off in search of Lucius and Narcissa. Harry looked back at the tent one more time before gritting his teeth and focusing on finding his mate’s family.
“Well….”
Harry took a deep breath and walked up to the door. He raised a hand to knock but before he could the door swung open. Harry frowned, no one was there and then he heard a childish giggle. His stomach dropped. He didn’t want to look down because he knew in his gut what child was there.
Warnings: ANGST
“I see. So Wood can give you those things Draco? Does he tenderly fuck your sweet ass at night and tell you that he’ll always take care of you? Does he whisper sweet nothings in your ear and bring you lunch?”
Harry’s expression grew cold, “I still deserved to know. That child is mine Draco, and like it or not, you are too.”
Harry laughed coldly. “I’m broken baby. I can only offer you one thing and that’s fucking. So if that’s what you want, take off your clothes and lets go. If not, you know where the door is.”
“I am so sorry. I did not mean to be away from my best girls for so long. I missed you both so much. Why don’t you both run inside and I’ll be right in with presents?”
Harry watched as Draco scrambled out of the tub and waved an agitated hand to dry the water. He met Draco’s stricken gaze with his own hurt one.
“Harry!” The blonde gasped and pressed his head back against the seat while hips started to move desperately.
“Oh for goddess sake!”
“She must be something to have your cheeks so red Sweets.” His mother said with a teasing tone. She noticed the blush as well.
He and Harry slumped forward on the bed. Draco waved his hand to clean the bed with his magic. Harry moved them forward and cuddled his big body close. Draco felt his eyes start to close as he felt contentment drift across the bond.
“I’m not asking anything from you. I know you never wanted children.”
“Why?” Pansy grabbed his hands from her seat next to him on the sofa.
“I’m pretty sure he has a weird pregnancy kink and is planning to do dirty things to your ass.”
With that Harry smiled at him and turned away.
Draco spluttered “Harry, no! I don’t want you to go.”
Harry never talked about it but Draco knew his mother had been sick for a while before she died. Draco felt sympathy for Harry as he realized being at the doctor probably brought all that back. Draco reached out his hand to Harry.
Ron smiled down at his wife before and Draco felt the intensity of the pheromones start to wane.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and Harry dropped his arms to Draco’s waist. Harry groaned as he felt Draco’s tongue brush his and gripped Draco’s thighs. He lifted the blonde in the air backed up towards the wall. Draco gasped as his back hit the wall and their cock’s came together. Harry moved his mouth downward to lick and suck at Draco’s neck.
“Yes, Mr. Potter?”
“Why not? He’s a perfect gentleman and he likes me.”
Before he could answer Draco said “118 Lovett Drive.”
Harry didn’t waste any time and lined up his throbbing cock with Draco’s entrance. He pushed inside and Draco gasped. Murmuring words of encouragement Harry thrust all the way in until his cock was seated inside. Draco was so wet he could feel the slick dripping out of the Omega’s hole. He looked up at Draco’s face. His eyes were closed and his face was scrunched in concentration.
“Well, feel free to do so. I’m not stopping you.” Harry almost flinched as he saw the way Draco blanched at his tone. God, why was this so hard? He thought as he closed his eyes.
“Is it so bad that I want to get inside my very beautiful mate again? That I want to lick every inch of you and listen to you moan my name?” Harry’s green eyes blazed with heat as he stared down at Draco.
“Dad! Captain Joebob has my uni!”
Potter,
When two creatures mate their child would only be born with the characteristics of one species or sometimes a strong hybrid of the two. Voldemort himself was the product of one such union; his mother was a shape shifter and his father was a vampire. Lore has it that Voldemort hated himself so much he vowed no creatures would mix bloodlines again. However, several prominent creature families (including his own) banded together and defeated him. A Potter was an Alpha Prime back then as well, a king in his own right of all the were-creatures. Draco wondered what Harry, the Alpha Prime-inherit looked like now. They had met as young children and Draco had been quite taken with the vivacious boy. Harry was several months older than Draco and almost double his size, even at age 8. He remembered Harry’s dark hair being a little shaggy because his mother Lily couldn’t get him to sit still. Draco smiled sadly, Lily had been killed during an attack from a rival Were family that sought to defeat the Alpha-Prime. Harry had survived and had been marked with a scar on his forehead where Lily placed a strong protection charm to save her child. Lily had been a witch and the coven had mourned her death dearly.

“Wine sir?” The attendant gestured to the bottle of spiced wine he held. It was the traditional drink of the First Dinner. Draco nodded, maybe it would help calm his beating heart.
“Sweetheart, I’m sorry.”
“Pans. I can’t.”
Draco looked out the window again and pressed his hand to the glass, if only he could just catch a glance of his friend he would feel better knowing his friend was okay…….
Draco stared across the driveway at Harry. How unfair, he thought that Harry looked even more gorgeous than the last time Draco saw him. Harry’s hair was tousled as usual and he was wearing a black Henley which was stretched tight across his muscular chest and arms, as well as dark jeans that hugged him like a second skin. Draco felt a flash of heat as he thought of how familiar he was with Harry’s body. Damn pregnancy hormones.
“I’ll never kiss you Harry Potter! Never! I’d rather kiss a dragon’s butt!” He yelled red faced.
“It did Harry, but let’s not focus on me right now. I talked to your dad. I’m sorry, I can’t imagine being separated from my mate and unborn child.”
The pregnancy test read: positive.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment and then sighed. He couldn’t avoid it any longer. Harry steeled himself and looked down, into Draco’s eyes. Except they were on a copy of Harry’s own face. Caleb was as beautiful in person as all the pictures Mark had taken. Draco thought he had just let him and their son go, but he could never fully let them go.
Harry tried to calm down as he stared at the pictures. Draco looked beautiful and happy in all of them. Harry moved some aside and stopped short at the one at the bottom. Draco was sitting on a park bench; his silver blonde hair fell slightly over his face as he had one hand cradled on his belly. Draco was smiling down at his stomach with a serene expression on his face. He looked even more beautiful than Harry had ever seen him. His cock ached at the thought of the blonde and how long it had been since he had been inside him. Harry had been dreaming of Draco for months, missing him, and looking for him. All along the blonde had been playing house and hiding their child from Harry.
James smiled somewhat sadly and pointed past the family tents towards the bottom of the mountain. “He wanted to take a walk and clear his head.”
Lucius bristled and clenched his fists like he was going to swing. Harry braced himself but looked over Lucius’s shoulder as he heard heels clicking on the floor.
“Daddy!” They yelled in unison. Draco smiled at them, he loved his girls with all his heart. They were identical beauties with their honey blonde hair that fell in curls down their back, green eyes, and golden skin. He and Harry made beautiful babies that was for sure. Draco put a hand over his belly. We love you already little one.
Harry could feel some discomfort through the bond. “Are you sore?”
Draco flushed and pushed Harry away. “Oliver is kind to me Harry. Something you know nothing about!”
Draco blushed at the innuendo. “I mean….uh…I’m not and you’re.” Draco spluttered. Thankfully he was saved from his embarrassment by the redheaded female alpha approaching.
Harry opened his mouth to say something but stopped and narrowed his eyes as another car pulled into the driveway. Draco turned ad watched as Oliver got out of his car and stopped short when he saw them.
“Don’t worry short stuff. They know the deal.”
“What is it Alpha?” Draco’s eyes were already glassy from the onslaught of hormones his body was starting to produce.
“Harry! Put me down! This is…. undignified!” Draco’s face was bright red as he thought of everyone seeing his bare bottom. It’s not like they had had time to get clothes.
His best friend nodded and walked past Harry. “Potter” she said in a sassy tone. Harry arched an eyebrow. “Parkinson.”
Harry felt his fangs lengthen and his claws extend. He growled in frustration, “mate” he uttered. Harry battled with his Alpha instincts for control. All he wanted was to search every tent until he found his mate and could take him away. Harry’s cock twitched as he pictured lavishing every inch of his beautiful mate.
“With my fire truck!” Caleb ran off and Harry assumed he was supposed to follow. Resigned, Harry went to join his son. He knew this was a bad idea but he couldn’t seem to help himself. It was only for a little while… what’s the worst that could happen.
“Whom you are having another child with.”
“Feel what you do to me short stuff? Just do what feels good, you can’t do it wrong.”
“Harry, the only man I will be moving in with is my husband or my future husband. You may be the father of my baby but that doesn’t give you the right to control my life. You hurt me Harry, and acted like an ass. I haven’t forgiven that.”
Draco felt a flash of sadness through the bond from Harry.
Draco visibly paled and it took everything Harry had not to fall at Draco’s feet and take it all back. Beg the blonde to forgive him, but he couldn’t.
“Are you ready to go in?” Narcissa asked him.
“Presents!” Both girls shouted and rushed inside to take off their coats.
“Good. Also maybe freshen up a bit dear. You look disheveled.”
“Ginny!” The redheaded vampire threw herself at Harry and caught him in a hug.
Harry looked down at him. “I’ve missed touching you.”
“Dad! No more kiss monster!” Caleb said giggling.
“Knock, knock.” His mother stood in the doorway of his room. Narcissa smiled gently and came to sit next to Draco.
Harry smirked as the blonde moaned in his arms. He had Draco pressed against the wall outside the bathroom. He had followed the blonde with the intent of a quickie to liven up this ridiculous charity event.
Draco could definitely believe that the rumors are true. Harry’s dominance and strength had poured of him in waves. Not to mention his pheromones made Draco want to bare his throat in submission. Draco couldn’t believe how much Harry had grown. His childhood friend had been replaced by an incredibly sexy man. Harry was every inch the perfect Alpha any Omega would want and Draco had humiliated himself in front of him.
“She’s pretty stubborn when she sets her mind to it and my brother is a sucker. Plus, you know how many babies my mom had, she could probably deliver this kid herself.” They all chuckled at the thought.
Harry stayed where he was for a few more minutes and then got up and walked to his fireplace. In there already were pictures of Draco and Harry. Mostly Draco in various stages of their time together. Harry threw the ultrasound picture on top and turned the switch to light the fireplace. He watched as what was left of his heart burned in the flames.
“Does Draco know about this?”
“We weren’t able to get the information from his doctor’s office sir. However, my wife and I have three of our own and I would say he looks to be about six months give or take a month.”
Harry watched his Omega circle around below him. He had climbed into the trees and had been right overtop Draco the whole time. Harry enjoyed the game they were playing though. Draco had always been defiant when it came to Harry. Draco was shy and demure with everyone else but with Harry he was spirited, feisty, and passionate. Even though it had been many years since they had seen each other the connection was still there.
Draco rolled his eyes but laughed and Harry joined in. Draco had always loved this side of Harry, the fun, easygoing guy.
“Let me go Harry!” Harry did the exact opposite and wrapped his arms around the blonde.
Draco giggled. “One it’s a baby not an it Harry and yes our baby moves around quite a bit.”
“My mate Nev. I know he’s here. I can feel it.” Almost on cue Harry caught a scent on the breeze of jasmine and the salt of the ocean. His cocked hardened and began to throb. He closed his eyes and tried to locate the direction of the scent.
“Of course my pampered Omega.” Draco didn’t have a retort as he was falling asleep.
“That’s cute Draco, really. Who knew you were such a romantic? Listen, I always thought you were a hot piece of ass when we were in school and then when we saw each other over the summer at Blaise and Neville’s wedding it seemed like the perfect opportunity to get what we both wanted. You knew the deal.”
“Right.”
Thank you all and much love!
“Hello Draco.”
Harry stared out at the dance floor of his newest acquisition. He had decided to branch out and expand his business. The club was beautiful and Harry had designed every sleek line himself.
Hi everyone! I am so glad you are enjoying the story and thank you for all the comments and Kudos :)
“As nice as this is I want a bath, and somewhere soft.”
“You’re right mama.”
Draco nodded absentmindedly. He couldn’t imagine what Neville must be feeling. He could understand why Harry wouldn’t want to rub his friend’s face in the fact that they were happily mated. Draco had always known Harry to be compassionate to those he loved. Draco sighed and moved to get out of bed. He winced as his sore body protested and slick leaked from his hole. His heat was mostly over but he imagined he would want Harry inside him again soon.
“It’s my baby?” Harry murmured.
Harry dropped down quietly behind Draco from the trees. He watched as the small blonde looked around searching for him. Harry took a moment to observe the small Fae without interruption. Draco had always been beautiful, even when they were children. He hadn’t grown much in height, Harry thought amused. Draco was what fables of old would have described a fairy as. His hair was so blonde it shined like a beacon in the moonlight and was held back in a low ponytail. Harry wanted to see his hair unbound and spread across his bed as he thrust inside the Omega. He wanted to watch those silver eyes widen with pleasure and kiss his red cupid’s bow lips. Draco was small but curved in the hip and had a perfect ass that Harry couldn’t wait to feel. Harry realized his thoughts had distracted him and Draco had turned around.
*****************************************************************************
Draco heard Pansy greet whomever was at the door and then let out a surprised breath as he saw Oliver walk into the room.
“Yes sir.”
“Shit.” Harry said.
“Darling?” She asked again. Lucius looked back at Harry and said in a low voice. “If you even think about hurting my son I will kill you. Draco is beautiful and bright and kind. He deserves more than a degenerate like you. Do you understand me?”
“I know you’re scared Dray but if anyone can do this it’s you. We are all gonna be here for you and give you and the baby as much love and connection as we can.”
“Time’s up baby.” Harry said before sweeping from the room. The picture of Draco was clenched in his fist. “Time’s up.”
Harry reached out and lightly grabbed Draco’s wrist to pull him closer. He kissed Draco’s neck and murmured “you smell so good.”
“I’m not defending Potter or picking sides. I’m on your side okay?” Draco nodded.
“I don’t know how we are even going to get Draco to the Fae lands without one of us fighting to get back to the other.”
“I wasn’t being a baby you big dumb head!” Draco stuck his tongue out even though he knew Harry couldn’t see it.
Enjoy :)
They got to the registration table and Draco smiled at the curly-haired Nymph Hermione. She was two years older than Draco but one of the instructors at his Omega school. She was a sweet Beta and always answered Draco’s questions without judgement.
Draco sighed and ran a hand through his white-blonde hair. “Well, you reap what you sow darling. I got space from you and realized that you were right. We are only making each other miserable.”
“Sorry sorry, trying to keep up here. So if your mate is here, why are we under the table?”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“The Malfoy boy, huh? Guess I should have known given how you two used to carry on.” His dad chuckled.
“Harry, oh god.” Draco moaned.
“Thank you, we appreciate your devotion and I am thankful for the protection.” Neville’s brown eyes softened and he nodded before standing.
“Draco, of course. Please talk to me Omega.”
***********************************************************************************************************************
“Harry! I’m coming.” Draco felt his eyes roll as waves of pleasure crashed over him and his cum splattered between them. His hole gushed with his slick as Harry pounded into him.
Harry stared out the window of his penthouse apartment. He lived in one of his many hotels and the penthouse was beautiful. Beautiful and heartless, empty. It was as empty as he was, Harry thought. Harry held a glass in his hand and sipped some of his expensive scotch. His life was full of expensive, pretty, and hollow things. Harry had once thought Draco was one of those pretty, expensive things. Until, the small blonde had wormed his way so far into Harry’s life and heart he didn’t know how he would ever get the blonde out.
“I’m ready to be your mate Harry.”
“Oh, I’ll be coming for you short stuff.” He whispered back and took off after the blonde.
Harry leaned forward and nipped the tip of the blonde’s nose. “Call me Alpha again my little Omega and we aren’t getting out of this bed.”
Harry could not believe what he was reading. He had only been gone 6 months and Draco got knocked up by someone else? All Harry could see was red. He was so angry he didn’t know what to do. He raced around his hotel room repacking his bag and he called his assistant Ron.
Draco swallowed roughly and looked towards where Harry was sitting. The Alpha was staring directly at him with green eyes filled with heat. Draco felt trapped by his gaze and could only stare back.
Harry grabbed Draco’s throat in a loose grip and ran his thumb along the side where his mark was. “Go take your bath gorgeous.”
Pansy cut him off before he could finish his question. “Enough about me Dray. What can I do?”
“Draco…. I meant what I said. You and the baby belong with me.”
Draco nodded. “That’s it then. Goodbye Potter. For good this time. As far as we’re concerned the father of this baby will be my future husband Oliver Wood.” Draco turned and stormed out of the apartment before Harry could respond. Harry watched in pained silence as the door closed and hid Draco’s distraught face from his view.
“Hello Ron, these are my former students Draco and Pansy and you can stop putting on the charm!” Hermione playfully smacked his arm.
“I want you. Now.”
Pansy appeared behind him, “Dray, Oliver is here to speak with you.”
“Yes. I’ll be there.”
Sexy time!
“I know Alpha.” With a worried glance at the blonde Harry left the tent. Ginny was waiting outside for him this time. The redhead had several marks on her neck and looked blissful.
“That’s me!” Harry helped Draco up and they made their way over to the nurse.
Oliver opened the door for Draco and he hopped in. He fastened his seatbelt as his husband closed the door. He started the engine and turned on the kids tunes for Caleb. Backing out of the driveway they both waved and started off towards the city.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hard cock and stroked it over his pants. His hand glided up to the stretchy waistband and he slipped a hand inside. Draco moaned again as Harry’s hand touched his naked cock.
Draco shook his head and turned towards the mountain.
“Pansy!”
“I want it Harry. Knot me Alpha!”
“I just want to talk to my parents and then I don’t know. How am I going to do this Pans? Months? Without Harry? What about our baby?”
Draco watched Harry’s face as he took in the flower pictures around the room and the waiting room full of pregnant men and women. Draco stifled a giggle at how uncomfortable Harry looked. Draco spotted two empty seats and headed over there with a reluctant Harry following.
“Not just yet Alpha.” He whispered back to Harry as he ran into the forest…..
Harry’s eyes flashed black as he emerged from the shadows. “No more running short stuff,” Harry said as he pounced.
“Absolutely not!”
Harry didn’t even stop to think what that meant for a him with Draco’s desire for marriage and Harry’s aversion to it but, he wasn’t willing to examine it right this moment.
floor. They crossed the hall to suite 22 and entered into the office.
“Found who? Is he under this table?”
“Don’t think I’ve forgotten we haven’t talked about your mate Pans.”
“Daddy! What’s taking you so long! We’re hungryyyyyy.”
“Mama, why can’t I see Harry? He is hurting and he needs me!”
Draco took a deep swallow of wine and stared down at the food which had been placed in front of him. Everything looked delicious but his stomach was in knots. Was Harry his mate?
“Please don’t cry.” Harry rushed over and gathered the small Omega in his arms. “Dray, this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do but… I have to think like a leader. If we were to travel together it would take us twice the time to get to Blackwood and my father is struggling as it is. Then when I accept all that power, I would kill anyone around you. I just can’t trust myself. I know it hurts and I know it’s a terrible thing to ask but it’s the only way.”
Draco pulled up in front of Pansy’s house. He felt…. Strange after the doctor’s appointment. The device was removed and his doctor had told Draco he could start trying right away for a baby. But, after hearing that all Draco felt was dread.
Harry’s arms tightened around Draco and he looked furious as he leaned down and spoke to Draco.
“Dray…” Harry moaned.
“Come get me Alpha.” Draco whispered.
“He doesn’t even know you’re pregnant! How can he care about a baby he doesn’t know exists?”
“Do you want me to kiss you little Omega?”
Harry joined in:
“Welcome then! Let’s head right on back.”
“Harry, pleasure to see you home and not gallivanting off on some adventure.” His mother said in a cool tone.
Draco watched as his husband went back inside. He suddenly couldn’t shake the feeling that something was going to happen. Draco frowned before bringing his attention to the road.
“Yes!”
“Dad…. I am worried about the travel back to Blackwood.”
She pulled back and looked down at him. “You are going to be strong my little darling and then we are going to get you home where you can take care of yourself and this baby. Harry will come for you when he is able. It will all be fine.”
“I’m ready for you, my little mate.” Harry whispered.
“I’ll kiss you someday short stuff and then you’ll never forget that you’re mine.”
“Harry…. I came here to talk to you.”
“No.” Draco said rapping his arms around Harry’s neck while angling his body even closer. Harry’s cock throbbed with his little Omega’s defiance and he ached to get inside him.
“Can I ask for one thing?” Harry said sadly.
Draco was drawn back to the present as Oliver came downstairs carrying Caleb and the rescued unicorn. Sometimes it was devastating to look at his son. Caleb looked so much like Potter it was torturous. Caleb had the same black hair, with a slight curl to it, olive skin, and a lopsided smile. The only thing Caleb carried from Draco were his gray eyes.
Caleb chuckled and then squirmed to be put down. “Can I bring my red firetruck with us Dad?”
Draco nodded and caressed the back of his Alpha’s neck. “We can definitely head to our tent. However, that requires you to put me down.” He said teasingly.
This is it, he thought. “Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”
“He could. He was not surprised but happy for us.” Harry swallowed.
“But, have you asked Harry about what happened that night? Why he was looking for you if he told you to get out of his life?”
“We got you right here. You are all set you can head on up.”
“What is it baby?” Harry said in a gentler tone.
“Gross huh! Well too bad my little Caleb bee cuz the kiss monster is here!” Caleb giggled and ran off. Draco chased him and grabbed his squirming body. He planted kisses all over his baby’s chubby cheeks.
Draco had been in the throes of heat the last time he did this so he had a moment of insecurity that he wasn’t doing it right.
“Believe me, I want that too. But it’s your first time short stuff. I have to get you nice and ready.”
“The committee who reviews the permit requests…... Pansy Parkinson is on it.”
Suddenly Harry was in front of him. Draco tipped his head back to look his mate in the eye.
Draco nodded, “A little.”
“Where is he living?”
“Harry we can’t.”
“I’m sorry Dray, I have to move.” Harry began to thrust in and out and grabbed underneath Draco’s bottom to anchor him in place. The Omega wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist and kissed Harry sloppily.
Harry withdrew his finger and nodded. Suddenly they were running and everything was a blur. Harry was using his werewolf speed to get to the tents. Draco blinked and they were at the edge of the field. Harry’s Alpha tent was huge. Draco didn’t have long to take in the details before Harry whisked them into the tent. Inside was a large bed covered with a black comforter. Harry threw Draco across the room onto the bed. He started to bounce off but caught himself with his equally fast Fae reflexes.
Harry felt his fangs distend and his claws lengthen. His ears twitched as he heard the little Omega’s words.
With that Oliver stood up, bent down to kiss Draco lightly on the forehead and turned to go. When he reached the doorway he turned back and said, “Don’t take too long okay? I love you.”
“Pansy!” Draco shrieked and turned red.
Harry opened his mouth to say something and Draco interrupted him by pointing towards the living room. “Go.”
Draco was able to pick up his father’s scent as they got closer, as well as James, as well as Harry’s friends Neville, and the redhead Ginny. Draco looked around wondering where Harry was. They approached the group and Draco smiled at his father.
“Please tell me you are not going out with Oliver Wood again.”
“Well, I see why you were waiting to find out the sex then. I am glad to hear you are feeling well. All your lab work and vitals look good. We will just do a quick ultrasound, print some pictures, and get you two out of here.”
His ex-husbands face tightened with guilt and anger. Harry nodded and walked around Draco.
Draco felt dread fill him as Pansy continued on into the house. Slowly he raised his gaze to Harry’s furious green eyes.
“I know this may seem fast Dray, but I love you. I always have I think.”
Harry sighed. He and Draco had met when Draco was 19 and Harry was 22. Harry had just gotten home from a tour with his band Gryffindor’s. Draco was a bartender at a popular bar in downtown London. Their connection had been instant.
“Draco!” Hermione smiled and stood up from the table. Draco leaned over to hug her, leaving enough room for her large belly.
“Hmmm…?”
“No need to be all gentlemanly now Harry.”
“Okay Harry.” Draco stood up and Harry followed him over to the large claw foot tub. It was big enough to fit several men in it. Draco waved a hand and hot water started to fill it.
“Draco!” Harry roared as he thrust one last time and Draco felt himself being filled. Suddenly, Harry’s cock was swelling and he felt the knot inside. The knot pressed against his prostate and he came with a cry.
“What is it you want to say Harry? Clearly nothing has changed. You resent me and the girls because of the life you didn’t get to have.”
“Sir would you like some wine?” Draco tore his gaze from Harry and looked at the attendant.
He would get a phone eventually……
“Whoah buddy! You know you can’t go over to the Omega tents; you have to wait for first dinner.”
“Okay babies! Just give Daddy 2 minutes!”
“I’m sorry.” Harry said quietly and brushed a kiss to the top of Draco’s head.
“Enjoy dinner and feel free to get to know your fellow tablemates. We will choose our participants for the Dance of Celia after dessert.” Minerva ended with a wink and disappeared with a swish of her skirts.
“I’m sorry short stuff.” He said with a chuckle and rolled onto his back. Harry pulled Draco half on top of him and cupped his bottom. He kissed the top of Draco’s head and closed his eyes in contentment. His mate. He finally found his mate and it was short stuff. Draco had been there all along.
Enjoy the update! Try not to be too hard on Harry this chapter (I know he was being an idiot).
“Oh my god. Dad…. I….um…we were.” Draco stammered.
“Harry” he said breathily. His heat was still clinging to his body and slick was pouring from his hole. “Please Alpha.”
“Mr. Potter a Mr. Malfoy is here to see you.” One of the front desk clerks stated.
“Mmmmmm… but I like the way you are drenched in my smell. No other Alpha would dare look at you.”
“I love you too, even though your tears are wetting my favorite sweater.”
“Mama and papa will be thrilled about a grandchild. I assume your dad could tell?”
Hi lovelies!
“Oh right” he stammered and picked up a pen to fill out the form.
“On the way there baby.” Harry said flippantly.
Draco sat on the exam table and watched as Harry paced around the room.
Draco moaned. “Maybe…one little kiss.”
“I imagine Oliver wouldn’t be pleased either.”
Draco hurried to the door and unlocked it. He opened the door wide and there was Harry. His ex-husband looked even more handsome than when he left. Harry’s tall frame took up the doorway, his skin was deeply tanned from his time away, and if possible he looked more muscled. Draco looked up. Harry had dark circles under his eyes and his emerald eyes looked crazed. Harry stared down at Draco’s belly in shock.
Draco looked down at Oliver confused where this was coming from. He gasped as Oliver pulled a ring box out of his pocket and opened it. Inside lay a beautiful silver band. Draco looked at Oliver with wide eyes and covered his mouth with his hand.
“Pans….I think I found him.”
Harry looked up at him with a guilty expression. Oh my god. It hit Draco that Harry thought the baby wasn’t his. He thought Draco had been telling him about a pregnancy caused by another man.
Draco smiled “thank you…. James.”
“Great.”
Harry growled and returned his mouth to Draco’s. They were both naked from the earlier ceremony (praise Minerva) and Harry couldn’t wait to feel his Omega’s tight heat. Harry sank to his knees still holding Draco. Harry watched in amazement as a soft bed of grass and flowers sprung up underneath them. Draco’s Fae connection to the earth was even stronger now given their bond and he must have done it without realizing.
“Yes, something bad happened.”  Draco flung himself down into the sofa.
“It’s all right,” Harry said, because Draco wasn’t trying to mock him or rub it in.  “I get to have friends.”
Which, at around this time, usually included Penelope.
Attention caught by the rainbow flames now arranged in the hearth, Harry took a moment to realize he was being asked a question.  “Er,” he said, turning back to Mister Malfoy—Draco.  “Yes, please.”
“Did you ask him to see you?” Sibanyoni said. “For who you truly are?”
“I don’t employ criminals!” Alby’s voice was shrill.  “I thought he was reformed!”
“Keep this straight,” Shacklebolt said. “Your world contains Death Eaters, Neo-Death Eaters, and blood supremacists. By rooting out this element, you’re not saving your world. You’re changing your world. Is that something you want?”
“Teddy was upset. He was going to—I don’t know; he was going to step in. Defend himself. Defend me, I guess, but then Malfoy, he—said something to him. To Teddy. He said something, then they left. Together. I think—I mean.” Harry stopped to take a sip of coffee. It wasn’t a big deal. It wasn’t a big deal; he didn’t know why it made him feel this way, off-kilter, as though he did not quite know his own world. “I asked Teddy what Malfoy said. He said Malfoy told him to chill.”
“I didn’t say I wanted to help you with your Patronus,” Harry said. “I want to help you decide what to do. You’re never going to pass Level One if you can’t cast a Patronus, not if I have anything to say about it.”
Milligan waited, her brows knit in sympathy. “Do you want to tell me more?”
The first few times Harry had called by Floo, Malfoy had snapped at Harry to get his head out of the hearth.  Some cauldron or other was always bubbling there, so Harry had got in the habit of Apparating directly in.  Malfoy didn’t take kindly to this, but Malfoy didn’t take kindly to much at first.  Harry guessed Malfoy must have been still offended at Harry having called him a Death Eater outside Mr. Mulpepper’s, even though he was one, because Malfoy eventually settled down.
“Oh!” Hermione’s stern look fell away. “Of course, Harry. I didn’t mean—I just want you to be happy.”
him; Harry leaned in to try to have more.
.”  Draco turned around to face Harry again.  “Or did you think Muggle-Erik would infect me?  No.  You thought
“You can have anything you want,” Mister Malfoy added.
“Don’t mention it.” Malfoy turned to look at the non-mag man. “I do this all the time. Rescuing people. Stopping bad guys. It’s kind of my job.”
“Isn’t he the best-looking bloke at Hogwarts?”
Draco cried harder.  “My dad didn’t kill anyone.”
“It’s graduation I should say goodbye to,” Malfoy said, his voice light once more. “I comfort myself with the knowledge that Travers initially only got two weeks for vandalism.”
“Potter,” Mister Malfoy said again, still seeming at a loss.  His lips quirked, almost a smile, but then he swallowed it.  “Potter, I would—I would never put you in a cupboard.”
The door thumped thrice, someone knocking. It wasn’t fair to shut them out when all they wanted was to understand. It wasn’t fair to expect them to understand he needed to be alone. It wasn’t fair to be unkind.
Harry had been sitting on one of the stools in Tailored Tinctures’ lab.  Now he stood, moving over to Draco.  “Come here,” he said, but when he tried to pull Draco into his arms, Draco pulled away.
Harry didn’t know why, but this fact made him even hotter, and Draco must have found it hot too, because the pace of the fucking increased. Harry arched his back to try to get more of it, more and more. Then his cock began to grow.
Harry began to run the washcloth over the blonde’s arm and continued his journey. He paid extra attention to Draco’s hole when he got there and massaged his thighs. After he finished his washing of Draco’s body he poured shampoo into his hands. Draco moaned as Harry began to massage it into his scalp. Harry made sure to cover all the long strands and then nudged Draco to lean back so he could rinse it. Draco’s breathing was slow and even and his eyes were closed.
“Shhhhh Harry. Give me your hand.” Unable to deny his mate anything he placed his large hand in Draco’s smaller one. Draco pulled Harry’s hand and placed it over his belly.
Draco almost stumbled at the wave of heat that hit his body. The Alpha was using his significant pheromones to distract him. Draco focused anew on making it to the woods. As much as he wanted Harry to catch him, he also wanted to cling to his freedom for a few remaining minutes. Draco was almost certain they were mates and thought of the life they would have together. In the romance novels he so dearly enjoyed (and Pansy teased him endlessly for) the Alpha was always calm and polite. Draco saw no resemblance to the almost punishing masculine energy Harry produced and his wry sense of humor. Harry had always been passionate, even when they were children and possessive of the things he claimed as his own.
Harry finished rinsing Draco’s hair and gave himself a quick scrub and washed his hair while Draco lounged in the water. Finally, Harry stood and picked up the blonde. Draco waved a hand as they got out and dried them off.
“Mother… I don’t want a baby to be the reason Harry and I get back together.”
“Mama,” Draco replied as he hugged her back. “Hi papa” he said and smiled at his father from his mother’s embrace.
He nodded, “a little.”
Draco gave a weak laugh but stood up from the bed. “Go outside Pans, I’ll be right there.” Draco took one last look around the tent that he and his mate had spent a blissful week in. He then headed outside with a sigh. Pansy stood outside the tent wearing a long dress in her signature red. The curvy siren had a mating bond proudly displayed. Draco could see Pansy was mated to an Alpha vampire. Before he could ask her about her new mate she rushed forward and hugged him.
Harry chuckled and grabbed a tissue from the console. Mark had respectfully put up the divider when he saw them kissing. Harry did pay the man to be discreet.
Pansy looked down at Draco with a shocked expression on her face. “What on earth are you doing?”
Harry paled but forced himself to nod and say “that’s true.”
“No, he’s as stubborn as you are.”
“I don’t know…. I just feel a little weird at the doctors.”
“Hello love” he said as he kissed her cheek and tenderly rubbed her belly. The man looked up and smiled at Draco revealing two fangs. The vampire was very handsome with his red hair styled short on the sides long on the top, his blue eyes sparkled, and the sleeves of his shirt were rolled up to reveal muscular forearms. Draco blushed and looked down.
“You look like you’re waiting for something.” Neville said looking up at Harry with his beautiful brown eyes. Harry had wished for a brief time that Neville was his mate. He was a beautiful man with soft brown hair, big brown eyes, and an incredibly fit body. Harry remembered when his friend presented as Beta and all the roundness of his face had been gone. Unfortunately, Neville preferred women and Harry, after he presented, was left aching with desire from dreams of an unknown blonde man.
Draco thought for a moment. The ceremony was the kick-off to the festival and included a chosen Alpha and Omega to do the dance of Celia. The leader of the festival, a witch named Minerva would pick and Alpha and Omega whom she feels a strong energy from. These two are not always mates but it happens sometimes. They then must do the dance which included disrobing and making the marks of fertility on each other’s body with a clay paint. After that Minerva would say charms of fertility and good fortune. The horn would then be sounded and the Great Chase would begin. Omegas, Alphas, and Betas would run towards the forest where they would spend the night running, playing, chasing, and so he had heard (even kissing), anyone they feel a connection with.
“We… figure out how to be divorced and how to co-parent our girls.”
Draco moaned against Harry’s lips. The pregnancy hormones were definitely encouraging Draco to keep kissing Harry but he knew they had things to talk about. Harry swept his tongue inside Draco’s mouth momentarily distracting him. Draco had missed Harry so much these last few months, his smell, his taste, the sound of his voice, and the feel of his hands on Draco’s body. But Draco knew nothing was going to be solved with sex.
Draco placed his hand over Harry’s. “I know, but I want children. As many as we can!”
“But mama! I want to help!”
Mark looked to Harry for confirmation. Harry scowled but nodded.
“Ron!”
“No, I haven’t. I’m …. Scared.”
“It was a mistake Draco. I didn’t actually want you to go.”
“Alpha Prime it’s nice to see you again,” he said and inclined his head.
Once mates are found it was well-known that they would move to the tents sectioned off on the other side of the festival and not return until the last day. Draco blushed. He had his first heat at 16 and was given the Omega appropriate training regarding reproduction and sexual relations but he still felt woefully shy. In his Alpha/Omega novels the lovemaking was always tender and came after the couple knew each other. Draco had heard some of the palace staff discussing Alpha ruts and it had sounded harsh and intense. Draco was nervous at the thought of some large Alpha commanding him and owning his body.
“You don’t have to take a tone dear. I am not going to lecture you. You’re an adult and Harry is your husband.”
“I need you to get me a flight back home right now!”
“You are a beautiful person Draco Malfoy and any creature would be lucky to have you. Now you and I are going to show them!”
“Where are my little munchkins?! I I’m so hungry I just might have to eat you!” The girls screamed and laughed as he ran down the stairs and made fake biting gestures towards them.
“She already did. It’s for tomorrow at 10am.” Harry sighed. He had a bad feeling about this.
-KitKat
His mother laughed and Pansy blushed. Draco stared at her surprised as the Siren never blushed.
“Hi, you’re reached Harry Potter, I can’t get to the phone right now. Please, leave a message!”
Harry and Draco had been struggling for the past year of their marriage and Harry didn’t know why. They couldn’t seem to agree on anything and spent more time elsewhere than with each other. He had done his best to assure Draco it wasn’t because he resented their life, but Draco was convinced that was the cause of Harry’s unhappiness. Harry just felt desperately disconnected from his husband. The only time they had gotten along in the last year was when they were having sex. Which, was not an area they ever had issues in.
********************************************************************************************************************
Harry couldn’t look away from Draco, he was stunning. The small Omega and his friend finished their performance and others began clapping for them. Harry watched transfixed as a blush spread across his pale skin.
“You’re not allowed to play with those older boys, they’re Alphas.”
“Okay.” His son said in a cheery tone and then left with the door wide open. Harry shook his head ruefully. The country life had made his son very trusting.
Caleb ran off and Oliver chuckled before moving over to Draco. He braced his large, muscular arms on the counter on either side of Draco. Oliver pressed his large frame against the smaller blonde.
Draco smiled. He would have to talk to Harry soon, he just hoped his heart could survive it.
“Don’t worry about me Pans.”
The next day Harry stood in front of Pansy’s townhouse. He couldn’t shake the sense of foreboding he felt.
“Harry!” He heard Neville say sharply. “Take some deep breaths man, you’re going all Prime on everyone.” Harry finally became aware of several Alphas in the vicinity bowing their heads in submission.
Draco wiggled on Harry’s shoulder, “you may be the Alpha Potty, but you are not the boss of me!”
James smiled at him. “I am proud of you son and I can tell it’s a strong bond. He will be a good mate and there’s no worry already about an heir.”
*****************************************************************************************************************************
The blonde’s eyes were closed in pleasure. Harry removed his hand from Draco’s throat and reached down to join the other hand on his butt. Harry lifted up the Omega and their cocks brushed each other. Harry walked forward until Draco’s back hit a tree. The Omega wrapped his legs around Harry and pushed his hips closer.
Pansy gasped. Draco was afraid to turn around because he knew exactly who was behind him.
Draco almost wanted to say “fuck it” and stop trying to get his dense ex-husband to give him a damn call so he can tell him they have another child on the way. He went back to glaring at the email.
Harry walked through the tent and opened the covering. His father was standing there and smiled when he saw Harry. His father was a tall man, not as tall as Harry but close, with black hair, tanned skin, and hazel eyes that were glinting in the sunlight. Harry mostly took after his father in appearance except for the green of his eyes which came from his mother.
, went Harry’s brain, and something shifted inside of it, not quite clicking into place. “I just meant . . . he’s a different person, now. It shouldn’t matter anymore. I should . . . maybe I would be attracted to him. If he hadn’t—if he wasn’t. Who he is.”
“For being his son.”
“That
“You already know it was Malfoy’s help I needed,” Harry said.  He’d been coming here for nearly a year to get Malfoy’s help with potions ID; he’d never needed Alby once.
“Oh, of course not.” Malfoy’s tone was airy. “Why is he here? I thought if everyone was going to snub me at parties, they could give me the distinction of being pure-blood parties.”
Harry sighed again. “Yes, Malfoy. That’s all.”
“Yes,” Harry said hoarsely.  “I—I want to help him.”
“Let me finish,” Harry said quietly, and Malfoy stopped immediately. “You were a part of a hate group that massacred a lot of people.”
Malfoy had said on the train.
“Er, don’t say that here, and, does it matter? At least he’s not going to . . .”
“Potter,” Malfoy said again, more loudly.
“You don’t need to forgive Draco Malfoy,” Kavika said.
“You could use it to be candy floss!” shouted a child.
The blood of the body turned cool. Teddy stiffened with rigor mortis. His face was a rictus of pain, of fear. Harry had had this nightmare before.
“Er.” Harry played one of his own cards.  “Not really.”
This most-important task accomplished, Harry felt a wave of relief—quickly followed by a wave of hunger.  He hadn’t eaten since returning to his normal age—which meant Draco hadn’t eaten either.  The wave of hunger dissipated into a wave of panic, as Harry realized he was solely responsible for Draco now, and most children were horrible at feeding themselves.  No wonder Draco had lost his mind over the taxi; taking care of kids was terrible.
About a year after Narcissa’s death, Harry was fiddling with a potion bottle in the Auror Office, trying to get the tiny stopper out.  Having taken the bottle from the potions dealer he had just arrested, Harry was fairly certain the powder was illegal, but he hadn’t yet figured out whether the brew was one the department was already tracking or whether it was completely new.  Mainly he was avoiding taking the powder to Malfoy, as the cool way Malfoy treated him annoyed Harry without Harry being able to explain why.  It’d been a year since Malfoy’s mum, and yet it felt somehow like Malfoy was still angry with him.
“I thought I would be fucking, mainly.”  Draco looked away, idly doodling with his wand over one of the burned books.  “But as it turns out, no one wants to fuck a Death Eater.”
MACUSA officials who are now part of a very large non-magical conspiracy plot.”
me, but you
“I don’t really think they’re hideous,” Draco confessed, making a face.  “I was . . .”
In that moment, Harry’s Patronus found Malfoy, the image coming as flash of hazy silver in Harry’s mind—a little like Legilimens, though kinder and softer, like a piece of himself come back to him. When Harry concentrated, the vision became a little less blurry, and Harry could see that Malfoy was standing amidst a crowd outside the Pallas Arch.
Malfoy jumped, whirling. “Merlin, Potter, you scared the bezoars out of me!” His eyes swept over Harry. “Are you following me?”
won’t marry him,” Kavika said. “For one thing, you’ve told me you’re still seeing Vincius. For another,
In that moment, Harry almost wished he could see Malfoy, because Malfoy wouldn’t do that to him. That Malfoy in the dream wasn’t real; it wasn’t the real Malfoy. Harry thought he might sick up. He wanted Hermione. He wanted Ron. He wanted to be with them, and he never wanted to tell them what he had dreamed. And Malfoy—how could Harry look at him?
, he wanted to add, but didn’t.
Draco scowled at him.  “I said that it was perfect.  You’re always perfect.  Everything about you is—fuck.”  Leaping off of the sofa, Draco began to pace.  “How does this even work?  We’re not even
“Are your parents warlocks?” another non-magical asked.
“Then what?” Malfoy said, still sounding irritated.
“Well then, Harry.” Kavika’s rough voice was gentle. “What is there to deal with?”
Harry caught his eyes. He held them. “You.”
, but Harry didn’t want to say it.
For the next minute or so, random fruits and vegetables floated from around the room to the broken-but-bespelled non-mag blender, and the loud sound of its blades whirling filled Yin’s study. Harry played with the crystals, and tried to say what he wanted to say. “Malfoy comes to the meetings,” he said.
