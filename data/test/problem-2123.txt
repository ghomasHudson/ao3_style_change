“What, Malfoy?”
Draco and Pansy were standing by the podium, Pansy in a long, black dress with silver embroidery, and Draco in black dress robes with dark green and silver ruffling on the chest. His hair was styled neatly out of his face.
He opened the cupboards, looking for some kind of snack. The contents consisted of a tin of crushed tomatoes, a packet of rice and an almost empty packet of crackers. Harry frowned, took the crackers, and moved onto the fridge.
“Er,” Harry said, not really sure how to respond.
Malfoy blushed, and avoided Harry’s eyes. “What?”
He shook his head. "I want to know they're alive. I want to see Mother. But I can't… I can't see
Pansy rolled her eyes. “I don’t know why I bother, you’re always so mopey. Let loose a little! Maybe you’ll even start to enjoy yourself.”
Ron sighed. “I have no fucking idea, mate. I knew it was gonna hurt. Just didn’t think it would hurt this much.” He paused, tentatively. “How… how is she?”
“Yeah. I’m tired of his shit too. I’m so sick of them acting like the war isn’t over, acting like their parents are going to come home and everything will go back to how it used to be.”
“Potter, Granger, care to enlighten us on what you two are chattering about?”
“Well, sounds like your week was way more interesting than ours, anyway,” Ron muttered.
it’s about doing the right thing.” Harry stood up, his eyes lighting up. “And we can ask Dean, Seamus and Neville for help, too. All the old DA crowd who became Aurors!”
“Harry?”
this surgery.”
“Sorry, I haven’t really been… on my phone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He turned around, feeling a blush rise to his already warm cheeks, and walked over to the couch, sitting down before holding his head in his hands.
He looked over, and Potter made eye contact with him. Neither of them had the usual look of mutual dislike, however. They both seemed to understand that the situation called for that to be put aside.
“It is working! Just- just trust me, okay? On three, aim your spell at the ceiling just in front of the door, okay?”
His laughter was hysterical, filling the room with a cold, malicious sound. Harry felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up.
He pulled out one of the journals, and flipped to the middle.
He waited until Robards had gone into his own office, before undoing his disillusionment charm. Hermione did the same.
He just heard Theodore mutter, “Blood traitor,” before they left the house.
Draco felt something strange and sickening in his stomach. He wasn’t sure what he had expected - his father had been a Death Eater, of course he was involved - but he had never even heard of these Death Eaters before.
Pansy bit her lip. “I’m hoping they’ll let bygones be bygones, with a little convincing.” In response to Harry and Hermione’s skeptical looks, she continued, “Listen, they aren’t like their parents. At least not the ones Draco and I used to hang out with. Some of them have got shitty moral standings, I won’t deny it, but they just need a nudge in the right direction.”
It was very simple; just a silver chain with a small snake pendant, winding around itself.
“I put it on the whole apartment, not just him. Means I can play my music loudly without number 9 complaining.”
“If anyone but a member of my family did that, they would be hexed,” Draco said coldly, and stepped into the front lawn.
Rex nodded, grimacing. “Ah. I see why you’d be comin’ te me, then.” He sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Listen, I never knew what my parents was doin’. When they got taken to Azkaban an’ all, my aunt came an’ told me all that’d happened. I lived with her a few years, ‘til I was eighteen, then I came back to the farm.” He looked down at his hands. “After what they did… I swore I’d never use magic again. I settled down ‘ere, met my husband, and put all of those awful things behind me.”
“Yeah, Potter, no shit!” Draco shouted back, joining back in to the flurry of spells against their opponent. “We can’t apparate inside the house, we need to get outside!”
Draco nodded. He had heard of the Parkinsons - they had been talked about amongst Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor.
“What?”
Harry stared at himself in the mirror, and sighed. He knew it was pointless to try, but it was still a bit disappointing that he couldn’t make his hair any neater.
“Harry! Harry, what’s wrong!?”
“They can’t do this.” Harry clenched his fist, his fingernails digging into the palms of his hands. “They don’t even have any evidence.”
Another twist.
Harry nodded. He immediately felt calmer; something about Andromeda made everything seem a lot safer.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are under arrest for aiding in Narcissa Malfoy’s escape from Azkaban Prison,” one of them said, and waved his wand. Ropes shot out of it, and before Draco knew what was happening, his hands were tied behind his back.
Robards nodded. "Of course, Mr Parkinson. May we come in?"
Blaise stirred his cup of tea. "I shouldn't have got so angry at you, Draco. I was just frustrated."
Draco snorted. “It’d just be me, then. Father’s in Azkaban, Bellatrix is dead, I don’t have any grandparents left, and I highly doubt that Andromeda would want to come.”
"No offence, Harry, but dreams aren't exactly reliable sources of information," she said, standing up as the kettle started to whistle, and pouring some tea.
“I think… I’m going to have to go back to the Manor,” Draco finally said.
He paused, staring at Draco. “The Dark Lord gave ordered me to meet with someone called Collins, and his wife, at every solstice and equinox. I was told to record their findings, doings, plans, everything, and then report back to the Dark Lord, as well as give them instructions from him. They listened to what the Dark Lord wanted less and less, and started lying to me. I was ordered to intimidate them, and I attempted to do so, but unfortunately there was one of me, and a few dozen or so of them. I returned a failure. The Dark Lord had less trust in me from then on, and he went himself to stop the Purists. He said he killed them all, but I doubt he succeeded.”
sure,
Everyone dispersed, looking around the room. Granger pulled out her wand and started muttering spells to reveal anything hidden. Potter began opening drawers at random, ruffling through the papers inside them. Robards and Langsley bent down over the bodies, using their wands to find traces of magic. Goldstein took out a notepad and began writing on it.
"It wasn't… Lucius… he didn't mean to, Draco," she breathed, her voice shaking.
“Sir, you won’t be allowed-”
Potter opened his mouth, about to reply, when an owl swooped down from above and dropped a letter at their feet before flying away.
Draco noticed that one of the Aurors slipped outside after them, too, leaning against the wall next to the front door.
“They haven’t done anything wrong yet.”
“Ginny!” Mrs Weasley opened the front door. “Come inside, supper’s almost ready. Harry, take her trunk upstairs. Hermione, will you lay the table?”
“Yeah.”
Draco blushed. “It went… it went well.” He bit his lip. “I don’t know.”
Draco snapped out of his own mind as Robards and Potter began to fly downwards. Potter let out a whoop of joy before plummeting directly downwards, going into a perfect swan dive. Draco followed him at a slightly safer and slower angle.
“Yeah,” Harry said, “He’s not that bad, actually.”
Harry turned the pages of his brief, frowning. There were so many pages.
“I’m just saying, Ron, Kingsley shows us exactly how to perform the spells. Just copy him exactly, and-”
“Morning,” Draco said.
Potter picked up the letter, and opened it.
He rolled his eyes as the golden fucking trio walked into the elevator. Hermione said, “Good morning, Draco.” Business as usual. Ron gave him an awkward nod. Potter opened his mouth, frowned, and settled for a strange half-smile.
He tried to ignore the way his heart was pounding erratically against his chest, and the way he could feel his hands shaking as he put his wand back into his pocket.
But the thoughts that occupied his brain the most - which also happened to be the ones that frustrated him the most - were primarily about Draco.
Draco thought, looking around. The room was entirely for show - to impress people who visited the house.
After her footsteps had retreated, he took a long, shaky breath and splashed cold water on his face.
anger, had been… Dumbledore's office… Dumbledore…
Teddy’s eyes lit up, and he grinned again, before launching into an explanation of every single dragon’s name, species, and each of their favourite foods.
Harry made eye contact with Malfoy, who shrugged. They walked over to Robards.
Of course she was scared to return-
In the corner of the cell, crouched down, was a woman with long, matted, silvery blonde hair.
To see the dog flap on the back door of the kitchen clatter open.
“Oi, Malfoy,” Potter said, and Draco turned around sharply.
“Now, to business. When we were looking through those journals, there  was a lot of mention of Lucius Malfoy. Now, I know Draco has been cleared and everything, by your endorsement - and this isn’t to say I don’t trust you, not at all! I’m just a bit, erm, skeptical.”
But what other option did he have?
Draco had hoped something might have changed about Potter, made him different, changed the way Draco looked at him. But it was still the same, except their rivalry took place at the Ministry of Magic instead of at Hogwarts.
“Have you messaged him?”
“Uh, right. Yeah. Well. See you tomorrow morning, then.”
She gave him another look, and started typing on her computer. “She’s in Ward E4. But it’s an emergency room, she isn’t allowed visitors-”
“Doesn’t matter.” He looked over at Draco, who nodded. He grabbed his arm and closed his eyes, turning on the spot.
As the wind rushed past his ears, whipping his hair back, Draco grinned. He wasn’t sure why, but something about escaping death at his old house on a broomstick, with one arm clutching a safe full of top secret information and the other around Potter’s waist made him feel elated.
“Don’t even think about reaching for your wands. I’ll have stupefied you before you can even get it out your pocket.”
“Come on,” Draco said, holding out his arms for them.
“Couldn’t have taken us a bit closer?” Harry grumbled, releasing his grip on Draco’s arm.
Lucius Malfoy’s left eye was closed, swollen and purple. He had a cut on his eyebrow and forehead, and blood still seemed to be trickling out of them.
Draco was wearing a black button up with silver patterns tucked into black jeans. He pushed his fringe back, feeling very self-conscious. It was one thing for Pansy to tell him he looked good in their apartment, but actually being out in public was a whole different story.
“I thought you might need it,” she said, “I thought we both did.” Andromeda sighed, deeply. “I know I haven’t been a part of your life. I stopped talking to my family when you were a toddler. But… after the war, I got a letter from Narcissa. I didn’t read it, at first. Didn’t think she’d have anything to say that I’d be interested in hearing. But my curiosity got the better of me, and I read it eventually.”
But, sometimes, Draco wasn’t smart.
“Fine,” he said after a few moments, “come in.”
, because he broke up with me, but I was going to break up with him, so… I don’t know. It’s complicated.”
She nodded sagely. “I think we all knew that it wasn’t going to last. I mean, how many high-school sweethearts actually stay together?”
Draco turned around, and saw Pansy waving at him. He pushed his way through the throng of people to meet her.
“Okay!”
Harry stopped walking. “He’s not the spy.”
“Then please, enlighten me on why a beautiful man with a voice that sends shivers down my lesbian spine has given you his number, and you
He shouldn’t have come. Everything about this was reminding him of his parents, of school, of the Dark Lord…
“Ron, just listen to your mother, please,” Mr Weasley said, giving him a look that begged him not to make Molly mad.
He didn't want to tell Potter that the reason he couldn't cast one wasn't because the spell was too difficult. Maybe he was arrogant, but Draco was a good wizard.
“I thought…” Harry bit his lip, unsure how to start. “I talked to Ron at the dinner party we had, and he made it sound like you were about to break up with him.”
Harry nodded, and then smiled slightly, looking at the poster on Draco’s wall. “Can’t believe you used to be a Wyrd Sisters fan.”
There was a soft knock at the door.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Fine. Fine! We'll just look, right?"
"Yikes."
“I’m staying here.”
Draco pointed his wand at Leo. “Silencio.”
“No, not at all! I don’t want you going out of your way or anything, Potter, no no no. Just be a bit more… aware of his actions, and make sure nothing, erm, suspicious is going on.”
“Erm… so, Blaise. I’m not sure if you’re… aware… but Draco’s mother passed away in Azkaban.”
“No, I’m fine. Just got splinched. Where is Amyra Collins?”
“I…” Draco paused, unsure of the reason. It was as if something in his brain was physically blocking every other part of him that was screaming
“Oh, no, it was meant to be a compliment, Draco - I’m actually planning to make these dinner parties a monthly thing; a little throw-back to our days at Hogwarts.”
A paper plane soared next to them, and gently prodded Robards in the head. He frowned, and opened it, then frowned some more. “Sorry, boys, I’ve got to attend to this - Potter, can I trust you to, er… keep everything in order?” He gave Harry a meaningful look, unsubtly glancing towards Malfoy.
Before he even had time to react, Draco felt the feeling of relaxation wash over him, and heard Robards speaking in his mind.
disgrace the family name, since you’ve done it informally already.”
A plaque spelled out his name in ornate gold lettering.
“Sir, please leave this room and the head Healer will answer your questions.”
“Hermione!?” Potter exclaimed as he spun around.
"I'm sorry, Harry, I was just trying to-"
Feeling awkward, he walked over to the guard. "Can you give us some privacy? Our interview questions are sensitive, and we can't reveal them to civilians yet."
“Which ward?”
“Oh, will you
He stood up, and slowly walked out of the cell, following Robards.
Draco didn’t move. He was frozen in place. “You hurt Mother.”
“And then, one day, I just broke down. We were sitting on the couch, and I started sobbing, and I told you that it
"She's, er," Harry frowned, running a hand through his hair, "yeah, she's good."
“Malfoy’s up to something,” Harry said, pacing up and down.
“Pansy,” he said, his voice breaking.
“What other choice do we have?” He said, perhaps a little too loudly, “They’ve got Malfoy! They’ll lie, or force him into some kind of false confession, or-”
Draco turned on the spot at the noise, to see Robards striding towards him, followed by a handful of other Aurors.
“Uncle Charlie told me about them,” he said after the fourth dragon, “and this is a Welsh Green. I call her Nimbo.”
“Hey!” She grinned, walking towards them, lugging her trunk behind her. Harry didn’t move for a couple seconds, debating the socially acceptable thing to do, and then moved forwards.
Draco shrugged, signalling that this conversation was over. He had put the reports on her desk. What happened after that was someone else's problem.
“Er, of course, Sir,” Harry said.
Draco blushed. “Er, thanks. I don’t really know what I’m doing, honestly, I was just having fun.”
“Is there a reason why I shouldn’t?”
“Oh, come on Seamus. That’s not true.”
“So,” Mrs Weasley began, “Arthur and I have an announcement to make.”
Fuck.
“There’s some of that stir fry you made, I left it in the microwave for you. Night.”
“Come on, let’s get to work.”
“How did it go? Did you find the records?”
They walked up the front garden in silence, stopping outside the mahogany doors.
Draco stumbled over to the bar, brushing his hair out of his face, and ordered another drink, giving the man a sideways glance. He had chin length dark hair, and dark eyes. He was clean shaven, and was wearing a button up with the top few buttons undone. As Draco reached into his pocket to pay for his drink, the man put some money on the counter and slid it towards the bartender.
Draco walked to his desk, trying to ignore the twisting in his gut underneath the satisfaction.
The man stood up, and made his way over. “Hi.”
Draco nodded.
"Hermione told me you were leaving, so I thought I'd come say goodbye." Her tone was slightly accusatory, just enough that Harry realised he'd done something wrong.
“Well, I don’t see why not…” Robards shrugged. “Finish investigating the house and then... I suppose you’ll have to apparate with him.”
“Well, I… Robards came to me and said you’d applied. He asked for my judgement. I told him you weren’t, you know. Evil.”
He was deliberately avoiding looking at Potter, maybe because he wasn’t sure why it was suddenly so easy to tell him everything.
Ivan was silent for a few seconds. Draco turned back to look at him. “You are not your father,” Ivan said, frowning slightly. Draco wasn’t quite sure if it was a statement or a question.
The man nodded towards Pansy. “Is she your girlfriend?”
His laughter died out, to be replaced by voice as chilling.
After a few seconds of discomfort, he appeared, outside Amyra's house. Apparating that distance had been risky. But he needed to help Amyra.
“Fine. Stuffy. People made fun of Luna again. How’s work?”
“No, er, it’s okay,” Harry said, awkwardly sitting himself down on the bed next to Draco. He coughed at the small cloud of dust that rose up.
With another groan, Harry turned back over, and moved to a sitting position so that Hermione could sit next to him.
They walked past a cell and the inhabitant ran to the door and started beating their fists against it, screaming, making Harry and Draco jump. The old woman remained unphased.
Malfoy nodded, practically wheezing.
Harry began to follow him, but stopped, realising that Hermione hadn’t moved. She was staring at the gates, her hand clutched over her right forearm.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Stop being so dramatic. I came here to get laid.” Her eyes scanned the bar, and found a suitable subject. She gestured to the bartender.
Harry fucking Potter, with his girlfriend, and the rest of their gang. Doing the exact same thing that their trio was doing too, presumably.
He turned around as he heard the lock in the front door click, to see Hermione opening the door.
Draco laughed, then froze. “Wait, what happened to the silencing spell?”
“Yes, of course. Ms Collins, we can’t disclose too much detail, but there have been some attacks on Muggles recently that suggest the activity of those who were associated with You Know Who. Given the history of your parents, we wanted to know if you knew anything about these attacks?”
“Blaise, we were just saying how good the food is smelling,” Millicent crooned as Blaise took his seat next to her.
“I was expecting a long, drawn out explanation, or apology, but she just talked about you. How proud she was of you, being an Auror, and that her biggest regret was letting Lucius drag you into all that Death Eater stuff.”
Robards sighed. “This will be a
"Er, Narcissa Malfoy too," Draco said.
“Well, it’s still technically all under my name, because Father’s in Azkaban. But there’s some stuff that specifically belonged to Mother that she had in her will which needs to be distributed, or whatever.”
Draco gathered up enough strength for a withering look in Potter’s direction, and flicked the light switch.
“Harry?”
Damnit, why didn’t he listen to Hermione more often? She would know the spell for it to reveal its writing.
“Lucius taunted him. It doesn’t matter - I can promise you that Malfoy is in no way affiliated with Death Eaters anymore. And we found out where the records of meetings with the Purists are kept.”
Harry looked back at the ceiling. There was a spot of mould. “I dunno. You’ve seemed… off. Recently. What with that and you being late for work, I figured… I dunno.”
“Well, yes,” Robards continued, turning back to Collins. “I’m Robards, and this is Potter and Malfoy.”
"I… the Dementors kept crowding around us, because Lucius was shouting so much. He was just shouting, shouting, screaming at them, screaming at me… then he went quiet for a few days, and I thought…" Harry noticed a tear trickle down her cheek. "But he was okay. He was just… planning. Then, once the Dementors had stopped paying so much attention to him, he managed to get out of his cell. He woke me up, he opened my door too, and wanted me to escape with him. I said no, it wouldn't work, I was too scared, and then…" She gestured to the bruises on her face as more tears fell.
Harry nodded, and started opening cabinets haphazardly. He supposed he should give Draco space. It wasn’t exactly like they were
“Will you and Ginny be okay?”
Draco adjusted his old green robes self-consciously.
hello, im back! sorry for the huge gap between updates, i got caught up in work, and then in another fic i was writing for a fandom big bang, and then i kind of lost motivation for a bit. to be honest, im not fully motivated for this anymore, but i still intend to finish it - while i've mostly drifted out of the harry potter fandom, this fic has been really important to me as a writer, and it's getting close to finishing so i don't want to give up now !!
Hermione nudged Harry. “Ron’s not here,” she said, chewing her lip.
“Just leave it,” Draco said. Their eyes met, and after a few seconds, Potter nodded. Draco let go.
It swung open.
Harry nodded, slowly. “Alright. Alright. So, what do you suggest we do?”
Draco shot upright in bed, his heart beating out of his chest.
“Yes. Yes, quite,” Robards said, nodding. “Now, if you’ll just let us get on with it…”
Harry turned, to see Malfoy walking towards them, looking incredibly tired.
Ginny smiled, and nodded, squeezing his hand.
“Sorry,” Draco muttered, “zoned out. Let’s go.” He walked up the stairs briskly, ignoring the increasing twisting in his stomach.
Yeah.
"I don't blame your dad for not liking me, but he was a bit of a dick."
“You still staying with her?”
Amyra's smile became pained. "Well, while Sirius and I were good friends, I'm afraid your dad didn't feel the same way."
Pansy frowned at him. "I thought you wanted to see your parents, Draco."
Pansy nodded. "And how long will you be gone?"
Draco opened the box, and he realised that he couldn’t keep everything inside him any longer.
In the distance, a blue streak painted the horizon. As it got closer, it was clear that it was a patronus. A lynx. Kingsley’s patronus.
if your plan could start working sometime soon-”
Robards nodded. “I’m sure Malfoy and myself can handle the journals, go ahead.”
That night, after supper, Ginny jerked her head in the direction of the garden. Harry followed her out.
They stopped before the gates. Potter reached out to try and open them, and Draco grabbed his hand. “Are you
Robards knocked on the door. They heard a dog start barking, and then footsteps. The door swung open, to reveal a middle aged man with greying hair, wearing a red flannel shirt and cargo shorts.
The library was organised terribly, and there appeared to be no search system whatsoever. Finding a book that even mentioned organisations targeting Muggles was near impossible.
"I put them on your desk an hour ago, Granger," he sighed.
He heard Pansy swear under her breath before responding. “Where are you? Go home, I’ll meet you at the apartment. Okay?”
“Come, sit down,” Blaise said, gesturing to the sofa. Pansy sat, and Draco next to her.
Harry put the letters back.
He wanted to yell that no, he wasn’t okay, but he couldn’t bring himself to speak.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Where are we?" Draco asked Robards.
With a pop, they landed, at the start of a long, stone walkway leading up to a huge, cast-iron gate.
A pause, and then the door slowly opened.
Harry’s own heartbeat was considerably faster than he liked it. Panic began to set in. “C’mon. Let’s go get Ron.”
“They’re lovely people, Draco, you’ll get on just fine. Come on, we’re going to be late.”
“It’s okay. Come in.”
to see you after all this time. How long has it been? Days, weeks, months, years, decades… no matter, no matter, come and give your father a hug.” He made a motion to move towards them, but was stopped instantly by the chains. “Ah, forgot about that little problem. They won’t take these off. Come here, Draco, let me see your face properly.”
He knocked on her door, loudly. "Amyra?" He called, and he heard Padfoot bark. "Amyra!" He knocked again. After a few more seconds, the door swung open, and Amyra stood there in a dressing gown.
“Er, I thought you knew - Ginny woke up from surgery just over an hour ago,” he said, his eyes now drifting warily to Draco.
Azkaban.
Despite his initial surprise, he was very relieved that Andromeda was there too. He had been dreading standing around a bunch of Draco’s family and friends, who all no doubt hated him, with no one to talk to.
“And you’re sure there’s no other spells protecting it?”
He had never been good at dealing with other people’s emotions. Or his own, for that matter.
“You’re the one who should be apologising, Blaise. But that’s not important right now. Draco’s in trouble.” Pansy glared at him, her gaze seeming to push through his cold and distant mask.
Hermione walked in.
“I’m with Harry,” Ron said, walking back to them with his arms folded, “I don’t really feel like trekking all over London looking at other apartments when this one is perfectly good.”
Potter stumbled over his words. “Shouldn’t we, uh, I mean, what’s… what’s the plan?”
descriptions of blood/gore/violence/death
“It’s a letter between two of the head Aurors. It’s not explicit, but… I think it’s enough to start suspicion.”
Hermione nodded. “I’ll see you two there, I just have a couple of things to finish up first.” She bustled off to her desk.
Hermione turned to Harry. “Let’s go get Ron.”
“Harry, here,” Amyra said, and scribbled something on a piece of paper. “Er, if you ever want to come over and walk Padfoot with me, I could use the company. It’d be nice to talk to someone about Sirius.”
He stepped down from the podium, and walked over to Andromeda, who stood up to embrace him.
Ginny nodded, looking over to Ron. He was standing next to Hermione, arms folded, frowning.
this one's quite long... got carried away at the end :) enjoy!
"And don't give me that bullshit about second chances, either. You've had enough of those."
“It didn’t exactly go
“What?” Hermione said, frowning.
Robards scowled, but didn’t say anything.
Draco sat down in front of Teddy, who was lining up all his dragons in colour order.
“I just know it’s pointless to argue with you.”
Blaise stumbled out  of his bedroom. “Draco? What’s happening?”
Harry sighed, looking underneath a bunch of papers in a draw.
One of the other Aurors stepped forwards. “Potter, Robards is your superior. This behaviour is unacceptable.” She had long, blonde hair and cold, piercing blue eyes.
"Hey," he said, "what's up?"
easier if you
Pause.
She nodded. “I love you, but… no way. And besides, I’ve got important snooping to do.”
He kissed her, and her tears mingling with the kiss suddenly reminded him of a time many years ago when he’d kissed a different girl after she’d been crying.
"Okay, mother-bear."
“Yes, sir. We’ll leave tomorrow morning.”
“Malfoy-”
“What happened?”
He rolled his eyes. "As if me being here has ever stopped you."
“Draco?”
Ivan nodded.
Why in Merlin’s name did Draco want him there?
“Sorry, just… haven’t been seeing you much at work. We’ve all kind of been doing our own things.”
“Potter!” He turned around to see Robards waving him down. “I was hoping to catch you here- can I have a word?”
“Are you alright?” Harry breathed, taking a step closer.
“Uh,” Harry said, like an idiot.
Harry stared at her for a second. “What? Why?”
The tension was palpable.
“Where are you going?”
“Even Neville’s doing better than me,” Ron huffed, “look.” He pointed at Neville, who performed a perfect Finite Incantatem, exploding the floating beanbag which Kingsley had conjured for them.
“Draco, just come. It’ll be fun.”
She looked at him. “What do you mean?”
“I’ve already started it.”
Harry watched Malfoy open a file and look at its contents.
“Um, hello? Can I help you?”
She shrugged. “Well, I guess that’s understandable. We became friends when Sirius and James were mad at each other, and James never really trusted me. I don’t blame him, really. My parents… my parents killed his uncle. And so many others. They were truly terrible people, and I wouldn’t have trusted me either.” She looked away for a moment, lost in thought, and then turned back to Harry. “Anyway, once Sirius and James stopped being mad at each other, it was difficult for us to stay friends, no matter how hard he tried to get James to like me. Then he disappeared for 12 years, and next thing I knew, I saw the news article about his death.”
Draco stood there for a whole longer, before quietly folding the letter back up, and sliding it into the envelope.
“Alright, I think everyone’s here,” Kinglsey said, as Dean Thomas joined them, “as you heard in my message, there is an emergency. I had hoped we would have completed more of your training before sending you out into the field, but we don’t have a choice.” He ran a hand through his hair. “Ten muggles were murdered by one of our kind.”
Draco shifted uncomfortably.
Amyra nodded, and sipped her tea.
“Yeah, I’ll just get a cab or something.”
“Uh-”
draco finally getting the love he deserves :)
Her voice was hoarse and soft, like a faint gust of wind.
Draco smiled. He wasn’t sure how, or why, but for the first time in a while, he felt okay.
“He tried to cast the Cruciatus Curse. I stopped him with Protego.”
Harry grinned. “Congrats, mate.”
“At least my ego hasn’t been ridiculously inflated, Chosen One.”
“That’s good. I mean, I don’t want her to be alone.”
“Well, Robards was the one who suggested that part,” Harry said, “I don’t know if I believe that. I just think there’s something fishy about him having a journal full of invisible ink in a locked drawer with letters from his Death Eater mother saying that Lucius Malfoy tried to break out of prison.”
“Have you heard from him at all?”
Draco and Harry both nodded, but Robard’s words weren’t enough to quell their fear.
“Easy? You almost
"Robards doesn't know. He said however long it takes to get the information we need."
Harry stared at the surface of the liquid.
TW: visible signs of physical abuse.
Draco sighed, shuffling through the papers strewn on the dining room table. He’d been off from work for about a week, that time spent either watching cheesy Muggle movies with Pansy, or the less appealing task of organising his mother’s funeral.
“Please do. I don’t want them,” she said. Robards grinned.
“Malfoy? What is it?”
don’t want to be nice to. But essentially, after the war, many of the Slytherins in our year inherited lots of money and power after their parents went to Azkaban. I think we can get them to help us.”
“There’s an
The woman behind the desk looked Harry up and down. “Are you sure you don’t need the emergency ward?” She said, her eyes lingering on his arm. Harry looked down, and was surprised to see blood slowly staining his shirt.
No. He couldn’t ghost Blaise for months and then just walk into his apartment in the middle of the night.
Harry nodded, and turned back to Amyra. He waited for Robards and Malfoy to leave, and then said, “Your dog. It’s called Padfoot.”
“We need to be absolutely certain that this is the body of Narcissa Malfoy.”
“Cool. Have fun,” she said with a wink, and hugged him goodbye.
“Unless…” She bit her lip.
She pulled a key out of her pocket and unlocked the door.
Potter nodded, his brow furrowed. "We should cast our patronuses." He pulled out his wand. "Expecto patronum!"
Dementors.
"What do you mean?"
Ron nodded. “That’s good.”
Harry put down the journal, and opened the letter.
“I can’t believe you swindled me into going out again,” Draco said, raising his voice over the thrum of the music.
“You’re really just going to leave me here?” Draco whined.
Seamus blushed. “Oi, shut up.”
Pansy stood up, and smiled for the first time since Draco had been taken. “We act like Slytherins.”
“Hermione Granger and Anthony Goldstein, with Merriam Langsley. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, with Gawain Robards.” Kingsley folded up the piece of paper he had been reading from.
“Just… don’t tell the others yet, okay? I don’t think Mum and Dad want you to think they’re kicking you out or anything.”
Draco turned and walked briskly towards his desk.
He knew the offer was genuine, and knew Hermione was only trying to help, but something inside him that had been bubbling up for a while just decided to explode.
“Yikes.” Pansy sat down next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco watched his frown turn to panic as he read the message.
“Well, I’ll give it a shot. Where’s his room?”
“Uh, one sec,” Pansy said, and darted back to the living room.
Harry watched as Draco clenched his fists. There was an expression on his face that Harry had never seen before.
He turned around to see Ginny standing at the doorway to his bedroom.
Something from January 1974 caught his attention.
Robards smiled broadly. “There we go, knew I could count on you, Potter! Alright, I won’t keep you any longer - get back home and get a good night’s sleep.”
Harry felt something twist in his stomach.
"Listen, just…" This couldn't happen. Not now. "Hermione offered to do all my work for this weekend so we could spend time together. Please, just let me take her up on that. I'll spend this weekend with you, and then I'll stay on top of my work these holidays so I won't always have extra stuff to do. I can make this work. I… I don’t want to lose you."
his grandmother’s carpet, the hat stand he had almost broken as a child - Merlin, even his mother’s hats were still there - and the ornate lights on the ceiling,
Didn’t they?
“Outside,” Potter said, and Draco could just make out Harry’s hand pushing his ever-messy hair out of his face. “I figured trying to get sleep is pointless, so… might as well enjoy the night.” Potter paused for a few seconds, and then said, “Want to join me?”
Pansy jumped when Andromeda touched her, but nodded.
Still shaking, he phoned Pansy.
He wasn’t sure why he had expected it to look different - all the bushes and trees were enchanted  to self-prune, and the house itself was stuffed with enough preservation magic to last a century, but still.
Harry removed the lasagne from the oven.
Harry knew, practically, that they’d been to the manor, that he’d comforted Draco on his childhood bed, and that they’d escaped certain death by destroying Lucius Malfoy’s study, but if he tried to recall the events, it felt more like a movie he’d watched than something that had actually happened to him just over a week ago.
Andromeda raised an eyebrow, but didn’t question him further. “Well, good to see a familiar face. Let’s get inside now, shall we?”
“Uncle Dwaco,” Teddy said, grinning broadly. His shock of blue hair suddenly began to change to silvery blond.
Draco nodded, and they turned on the spot, landing in the foyer of the Ministry after a few seconds of discomfort.
“You’re welcome,” the man said, “the way you dance… I like it.” He had a thick Eastern-European accent that Draco couldn’t quite pinpoint.
He slipped outside into the cold night, and turned on the spot.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry wasn’t really sure why he cared so much whether Draco was on time or not. His feeling of worry didn’t seem to stem from concern of whether or not they would get to Malfoy Manor and make some headway with the case, but rather from concern for Draco himself.
Harry felt increasingly awkward. Hermione and Ginny were chatting like they’d been best friends since childhood. Was Ginny being deliberately cold, or was he imagining things?
"Ah. Speak of the devil. You're two minutes late, Draco. It's alright for now, but we need to be on time in future."
"For fuck's sake- Harry, please go and let everyone in."
Neville nodded. “Course we do. Right?”
The study was at the end of the left-hand passageway. Draco started to walk towards it, but found that his legs stopped working when he reached the second door.
“Harry,” Granger said as they walked in and he went over to her, starting a whispered conversation. Draco stood at the edge of the group. He looked around and spotted Weasley standing slightly aside from Granger, looking distinctly downtrodden.
“Oh,” she said, “yeah, come on in.”
Harry shot up in bed as his alarm started beeping, his heart hammering against his chest. He took a few deep breaths, and switched his alarm off, before getting out of bed and putting clothes on.
Harry stood outside the train station, tapping his foot. Malfoy was late. He sighed, and pulled out his phone. Malfoy could have at least texted him to let him know.
"What do we need to ask her?"
“Well, not much except work. But uh, Blaise came to visit.”
Frowning, Harry walked to the kitchen and started making himself a cup of coffee. It was unusual for him to have such vivid dreams, and even more unusual for him to remember them afterwards.
They dashed out of the library with the book and the journal towards Robards’ office.
She sighed, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear.
“Oh. Right.” They walked over to the fireplace, and each grabbed a handful of floo powder. Harry stepped in before saying, “Ministry of Magic,” and dropping the powder into the fireplace. In an eruption of green flames, Harry was whisked away. At this point he knew to keep his eyes and mouth shut, and his elbows tucked in, but it was still an unpleasant experience.
“Of course.”
Harry quickly followed him, trying to get out the door with him, and bumped into what must have been Hermione in the process, but managed to squeeze out after Robards without too much trouble.
Either he had happened to meet another wizard at a non-descript Muggle bar, or this man was a stalker.
“Well, she was my sister, you know.”

Lucius started to laugh again. “Oh, she deserved that one. I was
“You. Always bugging us to do work.”
“Yikes,” Harry said, biting into a cracker.
okay so this chapter took forever to write, partially because school started and i've been ridiculously busy, and partially because i was a bit stuck as to how to get the story moving again without it feeling unnatural. i'm not super proud of how this chapter turned out and it's a bit short but i did it, and i'm proud of myself for that :) anyway, hope you enjoyed, and hopefully the next chapter won't take so long!
Then, Robards glanced at Elarena, who nodded. He pulled out his wand, pointed it at Draco, and muttered something that Draco was just able to hear.
"Sorry, it's been so long since I've had a chance to fly like that - I couldn't help myself."
Draco turned, to see the Auror that had followed them out of the house pointing her wand at him. They all froze.
"I know, Draco. I'm not blaming you."
“Thank you,” Draco breathed.
“Just because I haven’t laughed at any of your half-assed jokes, Potter.”
The elf nodded, and retreated back inside, closing the door.
Pansy took a deep breath, and nodded.
Draco snorted. “That’s a pretty low bar, Pansy.”
There was a dementor outside every cell door. They watched them closely, Harry's patronus not quite close enough to harm them.
He had always loved flying. It was something he had been good at, and not only that, it was something his father had encouraged and praised him for.
“Ah, Draco,” he said, “I didn’t want to interrupt your work, so I was waiting for you to finish talking.”
Harry felt something cold wash over him as he started to read the final letter.
Draco nodded thanks. Potter gave him a quizzical look, before returning to the living room.
“I think he said Dean and Seamus had a room open at their place. There’s a whole group of them. Neville’s there too, and some other guys he doesn’t know.”
"No," Harry said, "I was across the country, we'd just finished our work at Azkaban. I got an owl from Robards saying Amyra had been hurt."
He’d gotten over Potter years ago, back when they were still at school, because they
“Thanks to you,” Draco said, “how’d you come up with that escape plan?”
Harry froze.
Their apartment was always eerie at this time of night, even with the lights on. He made his way towards the microwave, and turned it on.
Amyra scoffed. "Oh, Dumbledore had a thing for broken people." She stirred her tea and sighed. "Listen, Harry… Dumbledore wasn't exactly a good person. He used and manipulated people that he could take advantage of. Severus Snape was one of them, once Lily married James. Remus Lupin was also one of them. You were too, Harry."
After a few minutes, Pansy nudged Draco, and jerked her head to a man who was sitting at the bar, staring at Draco.
“Oh, shut up.”
Pansy was going to freak out, though.
Pansy laughed. “Yeah, you did. And it stuck with me, because it often feels so much easier just to lock everything away and pretend it’s not happening than to deal with it. But you can’t keep doing that. You’re going to have to deal with it eventually, and the longer you pretend, the worse it gets.”
“They say not to speak ill of the dead, but to say my mother was perfect would be outright lying. I know she did some awful things, and even if that was a result of her circumstances and not something she set out to do, it doesn’t change the fact that she hurt a lot of people.
Robards cleared his throat. “There have been some, er,
And, across the wall, written messily in blood, someone had painted the word ‘TRAITOR’.
After a few more minutes, they reached the edge of the property. Robards stopped.
“See? I told you he’d grow on you.”
"Well, when I said you could pop around anytime for a cup of tea, I didn't exactly mean in the middle of the night, kiddo," she said.
“Me neither.”
The crowd dispersed, and Draco followed Granger and Potter over to where Robards was standing. They were quickly joined by Goldstein.
Despite everything, he still looked the same.
They were greeted - if you could call it that - at the entrance by an old woman who was hunched over, supported by a crane. Her patronus, a parrot, was on her shoulder, and looked almost as old and weak as she did.
Neither of them made eye contact with him.
They heard a scuffle from inside, a dog barking, and a voice yelled, “Coming, one second- down, boy!”
“How am I supposed to know?”
“Sorry for keeping you up last night.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. He said I’m not my father, and that I chose to help people, and that makes me a good person.”
"I'm sorry for shouting at you."
“Potter, it would be
“Yes, sir, I’ll keep an eye on him.”
It was a large room - larger than Draco’s bedroom, and it wasn’t as if that room had been small. A pair of dusty, maroon curtains were almost drawn, letting a sliver of sunlight divide the room.
Blaise, and his house elf. Nollit. What did ‘treating her well enough’ mean? The way they had treated Dobby had been considered a norm for house elves…
Draco came to an abrupt halt, and turned, arms folded, maybe too abruptly. Potter stood there, looking almost dumbfounded.
Draco made his way back to Ivan. “Your friend is leaving?” He asked.
Harry looked at Malfoy, who turned away to stare out the window.
“People aren’t one hundred percent good or bad, Draco. It’s not like all the good people in the world have never done anything wrong.”
Draco walked over to his closet, and opened it. All his green school robes were still hanging there, along with some of his casual clothes. He reached up to the top shelf - which he could now reach easily, whereas he used to have to stand on tip toes - and pulled down a black box.
Hermione sighed. “I suppose I should go and talk to him…”
“I… I guess I haven’t been doing the greatest, at the moment,” Malfoy said, and Harry could tell he was deliberately avoiding eye contact.
Ivan danced in a mesmerising way - it wasn’t particularly fast or impressive, but he moved with the rhythm of the music, as though it was flowing through him. Draco felt a bit more self conscious about his own dancing, but still danced with Ivan as best he could, while his mind continued to race.
“Well, that’s good timing.”
Draco could practically feel Potter’s frown boring into his skull.
"Are you sure I won't break the door or something? Apparently I can't do anything right-"
“Must have belonged to them,” Langsley said.
He slowly moved his head upwards, and started laughing.
“Yeah, but… Maybe they were as clueless to what was in the safe as we are. They could have just tried to stop us as a precaution, you know? Or they could even have done it to throw us off course. I mean, if they really didn’t want us to get it, why only send two people? And why only let the people retrieve it as we were doing it? They’ve had plenty of time to do it before now.”
“Do you want to come to the funeral?” Draco said, before he could stop himself. He wasn’t sure what had made him say it, and he felt his heart leap into his mouth as Potter turned around, surprise etched across his face.
The boat was freezing.
“Has she woken up?” Harry said immediately, standing up.
Ron rolled his eyes. “Great, I’m really looking forwards to Mum and Percy telling us what a terrible decision we’ve made.”
“Hold him off for a second-”
Draco pulled a comb through his hair one last time, and they disapparated.
“Hold on!” Potter yelled, and they shot out of the window.
Ron shrugged, and went over to the kitchen.
Potter swore under his breath. “Malfoy, stay here in case Amyra wakes up,” he said, and walked off, following Bill.
They didn’t need to elaborate. The dreams were common, and they both knew what the other had gone through, what the other was still going through. It wasn’t a matter of saying, “I’m sorry, that’s awful,” it was simply a mutual understanding.
She sighed, and looked away from him. "I'm struggling too, Harry. I love you. At least, I think I do. But I'm not so sure if you love me anymore."
Draco tried to focus on his broomstick, the air rushing through his hair, but he kept glancing over at Potter.
“I apologise that I have to keep separating you from the rest of your colleagues. However, it is imperative that the information you three discover - and have discovered so far - does not reach the ears of anyone except the people in this room. I believe that there is someone in here leaking information to outsiders.”
“Let’s go,” Draco said, and when he didn’t move, Draco added, “Harry. Let’s go.”
Inside the cell, two more dementors stood in the corners. Between them, practically hanging by his hands from the wall, was a figure with hair of a likeness to Narcissa’s. Long, blonde, dirty and matted. But his also had streaks of dark red.
"I dunno. He's… paler."
Mr Weasley was next, followed by George and Percy.
Harry nodded. “Hey. It’s going to be okay.”
Pansy nodded. “Yeah. You got this.”
“Hey.”
Despite himself, Draco was actually starting to have fun. He and Pansy danced terribly, but he didn’t care.
“Padfoot?” Potter said, staring at the dog, his eyes lit up in hope.
Andromeda’s house was small, but cozy. They apparated into her living room, which had two sofas and an armchair in front of a fireplace. She pointed her wand at the fireplace, and it came to life.
“Care to share why you suddenly forgot how to have a conversation?”
“Uh,” he said, “if you want me there, sure. Yeah. I’ll- I’ll come.”
“Yeah, I think she just didn’t want to fight with Ron anymore.”
Ginny nudged Harry, and jerked her head in the general direction of Ron and Hermione’s bedroom.
He slowly opened the front door, and stood outside the Weasley’s house, breathing in the fresh country air. The stars were so clear there, unlike in London, where Venus was hardly visible some days.
"Ah." Pansy opened her mouth as if to say something, paused, and then continued tentatively. "Draco, I… I don't know much about what your father was like, but don't you think… it'll be good to confront him?"
“It’s, uh, it’s nice,” Harry said, noncommittally. He didn’t know the first thing about finding an apartment.
Ginny laughed, and shook her head. "Not in a million years."
“Well, that was a complete dead end,” Harry sighed, slumping on the left hand side bed of the shitty motel they had rented. They were investigating a few more people in the area, so Robards had said it was best to stay there. Robards had his own room, while Harry had to share with Malfoy.
Draco was led into a small room with a chair in the middle, and rows of seating surrounding him, with a large desk in front. As soon as he sat in the chair, large chains wrapped around his arms and legs.
"I see." She closed her eyes, and stumbled for a moment. Draco put his arm out to catch her. "I'm sorry, I… My head feels a bit fuzzy. With the guard dementor gone, I can at least think straight, but I can't…" She stumbled again, and sat down on the floor, the chains clinking against the ground.
“Er, yes,” Robards said, eyeing the dog, “are you Amyra Collins?”
But for some reason, something inside Draco was telling him that he didn’t want someone else going and getting the records.
She sat across from him, and raised an eyebrow. "So, what brings you to my house in the middle of the night?"
he scolded himself,
Harry felt a hot wave of embarrassment rush over him.
A murmur went through the group, and Draco could almost feel his heart stop.
She looked up at him again, indignant. “Harry, we’re not even halfway. We can’t just give up now, especially after all you went through to get these.”
Robards chewed his lip. “I’ll keep you updated on everything that happens from now on. You have my word, Erin. I don’t want to sow distrust between us.”
Harry opened the journal. Every page was blank. For a moment, he thought of trying to write in it to see if it responded like Riddle’s had, but realised that it was probably implausible for Malfoy to have died and hidden his memory inside a diary while still having a physical form. It was probably in invisible ink.
Harry gave him a glare. He wasn’t sure why Draco had suddenly decided to act so cold, but Harry was determined to return the attitude. He grabbed Draco’s arm roughly. Hermione followed, chewing her lip.
"Hey Gin, I found your boyfriend," Bill said as they walked in through the ward door.
"It's alright, Draco." Blaise smiled awkwardly. "I don't really blame you." He put down his cup of tea and ran a hand through his dark, curly hair. "I was a total asshole."
“What do you mean?”
"Maybe. I don't know. Are you sure Blaise still wants to…"
Draco nodded, and then put his hands on his face, running them back through his hair. “I’m sorry I didn’t text you, Ivan. I really am. The last week has just been-”
Harry tried to diffuse the situation.
“You, me, Draco, and Robards. Although, Robards probably told some of the other Aurors. It has to be one of them.”
“So you think these ‘Purists’ met up on those days? And your dad was involved?”
It was a fairly short broom ride to the venue for the funeral, but Harry still regretted choosing to go by broom when he realised that if his hair was messy before, it was an owl’s nest once he got off the broom.
TRIGGER WARNING: This chapter contains use of the f-slur. If you think you might be affected by this, please be careful reading the chapter. It isn't used in an explicitly aggressive way against someone, but is said in reference to a past event.
Harry cleared his throat again. "Er, just if she knows anything about the Purists."
Potter simply nodded.
Malfoy looks at him, his face unreadable. It makes Harry uncomfortable, but he tries his best to endure it. Instead of answering, however, Malfoy slowly gets up, and Harry gazes after him as he makes his way back to the castle. He wonders if Malfoy’s silence was a wordless agreement or yet another declination. He needs some time, Harry supposes. Everything is changing, and everyone needs their own pace to adapt to it.
“Aurora,” Flitwick tells the stone gargoyle and it steps aside to grant them access to the circular staircase.
“What’s your problem? You set us up, remember?”
He only realises the stage is empty when the music suddenly stops and the spotlights are pointed at the red velvet curtain. He doesn’t know why, but a weird sense of foreboding and anticipation builds in the pit of his stomach as a new song starts blaring through the speakers and the curtain is suddenly wrenched apart.
“Well, um. That was… something,” Harry murmurs. He peeks at Malfoy from under his lashes, too nervous to look at him directly. He’s probably mad at him. He’ll probably yell, throw a fit. Maybe he’ll even try to hit Harry. Or—
“Why? It’s so good!”
Draco shivers again, and against his better judgement, he nods. Something tingles in his throat while Dumbledore screws up his face in concentration. After a moment, he sighs. He points his wand at Weasley before he turns back to Potter again.
“I’m not very good at that,” Potter admitted, rubbing the back of his neck.
Harry tries to return it, but finds himself unable to. His fingers curl around the book, his stomach twisting itself into knots.
“Are you Mr Malfoy’s friend?” she asked, regarding Potter closely.
“There’s somewhere we need to go.”
Potter shook hands with a few people, thanked them over and over again, and even apologised, before he threw Draco a grateful look as they hurried down Diagon Alley.
“Did you just say- You… What?”
“Yeah, the music was awful, wasn’t it?” One tap. That’s a no. Really?
“To be fair,” Potter says, “that was only partly my fault. I was being hunted by Voldemort.”
Potter doesn’t answer. Instead, his hand suddenly grabs Draco’s wrist.
“I—I know,” Harry says, letting his hands slide down to Malfoy’s arse. “Merlin, I want to touch you so badly,” he chokes.
The boy looks up, his eyes red rimmed and full of fear.
“The package, it’s for you, you prat.”
As he makes his way to the dungeons, darting through the corridors, he tries to ignore the stabbing pain he feels in his chest. Putting distance between him and Potter doesn’t seem to be helping. The pain might be worse now but, in the past, he succeeded at suppressing his feelings. He can do it again.
“Potter,” he said softly, stroking his cheek with his thumb. “Take off your jumper.”
He has to hide his smile when he hears him call out his name and falls into step beside him on the way to the next class. Their hands brush against each other and neither of them shies away from the touch. He is a little surprised, however, when they walk around the lake and warm fingers curl around his. Not by accident.
Before Draco knows what he’s doing, he takes the empty glass on his bedside table and smashes it. He sees Potter jump.
Draco gulped, not quite grasping what Potter was saying.
“Oh,” he and Potter both exclaimed. That… wasn’t too bad. Not bad at all, actually. He did it again, only this time, Potter moved his hips as well.
“We’re just sitting around, doing nothing.”
Harry looks sadly at the batted trunk standing in the hallway. He can’t believe it’s the last of Ron’s things. Then again, it took almost five days to pack up his room, even though there always seemed to be nothing more than his bed, a closet and a few posters on the walls. Apparently, one can stuff a lot of things under a bed, and hide a lot of things in a single closet, besides clothes.
Harry presses his lips together, thinking hard.
“What? Oh!” Only now did Potter seem to notice that the ice lollies were melting quickly, dripping all over his hands. He lifted one hand to his mouth and dragged his tongue over his knuckles slowly. Mesmerised, Draco watched as Potter did the same thing to his other hand.
Draco holds his gaze, his lips stretching into a smile. “You know, I think I like having so much power over you.”
“Hello, Professor,” Harry replies, sitting up. He almost feels sheepish for probably talking to the air, not quite knowing where Dumbledore is standing.
. Draco’s lips suddenly ache to be pressed against Potter’s. They ache to feel Potter’s teeth as he nibbles at them. They ache to be parted to let Potter’s tongue slip inside Draco’s mouth. He swallows. Suddenly, every part of him aches for Potter.
Potter nodded, pensively.
“That’s none of your business,” Draco grumbled and tried to wriggle himself out of Potter’s grip.
“I, err—” Damn it, why is he so nervous? “I—I’m glad to have you in my life, Potter.” Merlin, this honesty thing is disgusting. “And I, um, I’d like it if you maybe… played an even bigger role in it.”
“What—Really?”
Harry wakes with a jolt. Loud voices and footsteps fill the hospital wing. Panicked, he feels around the bed, only to find the other side empty. His disappointment quickly fades as he realises who just entered the infirmary.
“And do it silently, will you?”
“I—I’m not coming back. I quit.”
He’s too late.
Draco wants to scream when Professor Slughorn offers his shoulders for Draco to grab and helps him stand up.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco murmurs, the sound of her whimper cutting through him like an icy knife.
“Merlin, stop smiling like that. You look delirious.”
All these years, he was able to conceal just how much it was about hurt feelings and anger that fuelled his childish actions. He could have gotten away with it. Nobody had suspected a thing. They all thought Draco was just a snooty, spoilt brat. Which, technically, he was.
“Fine,” is all Malfoy says. He gets up with his eyes still glued to his stupid book.
Ugh. This isn’t working.
“You want me—” He gulps. “You want me to stop talking?” One tap on his hand. That means no.
The painting is now in Draco’s study. It’s opposite his desk and Draco finds himself gazing at it whenever he’s lost in thought. But when he looks at it now, it doesn’t hurt anymore. Draco can’t forget about his past, but he is no longer haunted by it. Because now he has Harry.
“Dinner.” He turned to Malfoy and bit his lip. “All you have to do is say yes.”
“Huh?”
Draco paused. This kind of sentimentality wasn’t exactly something he was used to. And while he mentally admitted he felt the same way about Potter, he couldn’t shake the crushing sense of responsibility Potter had just burdened him with. So… what now? This was getting them nowhere. Draco wondered how far he could go without hurting Potter unnecessarily. He always acted so strong and confident, but he had shown Draco glimpses of his vulnerable side and if that wasn’t an indication he trusted Draco, what was?
Draco’s eyes rolled up to the ceiling. “Potter, there’s no need to state the obvious, you—”
He glances at the clock and sees it’s 3:49. His eyes find Harry’s and they hold so much love, it makes Draco shudder. He takes Harry’s hands in his and pulls him closer. When his lips brush Harry’s, a familiar feeling washes over him. It’s warm and invigorating, reassuring and exhilarating. Kissing Harry will never fail to consume and mesmerize Draco.
“Well, I didn’t suspect. And my point still stands. He should have told me. I had a right to know.”
“Why not?”
“Because, clearly, there’s something wrong with—”
“Then just take my name,” Draco shrugged, as though it wasn’t a big deal.
An hour later, Draco was sitting in his favourite café, tapping his foot impatiently. Luna wouldn’t tell anyone, would she? Had she already? Ugh, this was maddening!
Something flickers across Potter’s face. Draco has no idea what it means. But he knows he’s right. He mentally congratulates himself while the now familiar feeling of power surges inside of him.
Malfoy looks down at his mug and it takes Harry a moment to realise his knuckles have turned white.
“I’m not doing it intentionally,” Harry snaps back.
“No.” Harry shakes his head. “I’m not,” he adds when Ron’s worried expression doesn’t change. “I think you would have noticed.”
He whimpers as he hurries away from Potter, the pace much too rapid for his already sore body, and yet, he can’t get away far enough for Potter not to see. He bows his head and heaves while his mind provides him with more images of the scarlet eyes and his mother’s screams.
again that you’re straight.”
“Oh, Merlin, no,” Draco breathes. He looks at Kreacher and decides not to tell him about the Goblin wine. He’d probably stick his head in the oven if he knew what it did to Draco. “No wine. Thank you.”
The worst part is, Harry lets it happen night after night. During the day, he squirms impatiently in his bed, barely listening to anything Ginny tells him about her O.W.L.s. As soon as night falls, he feels his excitement pick up and he sighs in relief when Malfoy slips into his bed to drive him insane, only to feel a pang of yearning and regret every time he takes off again.
Potter seemed doubtful if he was really awake. He shook his head several times, until he seemed convinced Draco was really standing in his bedroom. “Mind your own business,” he said, defensively. “What the hell are you even doing here?”
“And I noticed something,” Harry continued, ignoring Malfoy’s comment. “You’re always alone.” Harry watched as a hint of annoyance flickered over the Slytherin’s face.
“You want to try it?” Potter asks in a teasing tone.
“Try giving him some Uku—lele,” he suggested.
Draco quickly swallows and immediately opens his mouth, leaning towards Potter.
“Everything alright?”
“What’s—” Harry swallows. “What’s the ritual?”
to talk to Malfoy. He doesn’t know what the hell is wrong with him. Maybe that curse took more than just his eyesight.
“What?”
“I can do that,” Potter whispered, leaning in. He captured Draco’s bottom lip and let his tongue brush against it. This, Draco mused, was definitely something he’d never grow tired of. He wondered if his heart would ever cease to jump frantically when Potter kissed him. Probably not. And definitely not right now. On the contrary, his heart rate increased dramatically when he parted his lips and felt Potter’s tongue push against his. Sweet Merlin!
Harry frowns and looks down at his parchment. Sure enough, instead of continuing his Transfiguration essay, there are dozens of flowers he apparently doodled while thinking about Malfoy. What the hell?
“Draco, did I hurt you?”
“Well, at least you lasted longer than the other ones, right?” Nick says, leaning against Draco’s desk.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees him stretch.
“Are you sure it wasn’t your fault?” Ginny asks. “I have no idea what happened, but the chances of you—”
‘Sorry I almost killed you. But in my defense, you’re an arse and you wanted to torture me.’
“Oh, I know what you were trying to do, you idiot!
“It’s part of him, what they did all those years ago. It shaped the person he’s become and he’s obviously still haunted by it, even if he may not realise it. He thinks he doesn’t deserve anything, he always puts others first because he thinks that’s how it should be… He has no sense of self-worth.”
Draco cocks his head to the side. “But what you’re saying is… he wasn’t like this. Before.”
“We aren’t even included in the competition for the House Cup.”
“Not interested, Potter,” he spits.
“Ooooh,” he said, and suddenly took several steps forward. Draco backed away, but startled when his back suddenly hit a wall.
“Malfoy,” he breathes, blinking against the light.
Draco stared at him, willing his heartbeat to slow down. ‘What about a boyfriend?’ he wanted to ask. How many hours, days and months he had spent, wondering if Potter might like blokes. And here it was, the perfect opportunity to find out.
“What? That’s not fair,” Harry protested.
Potter freezes. His expression changes from fear to wonder to… something else. He slowly turns around.
So he’s trying to distract himself. From what? Heartbreak? Is he still hung up on Weasley’s sister? Whatever it is, it seems to be so bad, Potter snaps as soon as things get too quiet. Weasley said he doesn’t know how to deal with it; at least it was implied.
“I—What kind of game is this?”
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Draco muttered under his breath and pinched the bridge of his nose.
Draco slowly backed away, unsure of what to do. He drew his wand and pointed it at the man, his hands slightly trembling. Was this even a wizard? He had to be. There were no—
"Says who?" demanded the former as the latter sat up groggily and tried for an incredulous look.
“Are you alright?” Ron asked worry littering his features.
“Where in the fucking –”
Harry groaned loud enough to shatter the windows.
Draco met his gaze.
He stopped a few inches from Harry who took a deep breath. Draco grasped Harry’s tie in his hand. He unfastened it with a sound of disgust.
Harry nodded.
He got to his feet and moved the bathroom, the last thing he wanted to think about now was homework. The bathroom had a tub to the left side where Draco lined up dozens of bottles with different coloured liquids. The labels all bore his handwriting which told Harry they were his own brews.
“It’s about Draco Malfoy, professor.”
It was enough.
Draco woke to a feeling of filthiness the next morning. He had slept six hours – two more than usual – but for some reason his body yearned for more. He rolled over, a heavy sigh escaping his swollen lips as he pulled the sheets across his body. He did not want to have to wake up just yet.
version of brewing is preferred because it has fewer side effects," she said in a rush looking flustered.
He looked down at the damp sheets and realised with horror that he was hard, painfully so. For Potter of all people. He felt like he was going to throw up. He felt dirty, soiled. Not by the fact that he'd just had a wet dream about another boy but that the boy in question was Potter of all the bloody people in the world.
“Quiet,” Armand hissed just as loud and Harry saw the telltale signs of him restraining his temper.
What Harry would do for some toast.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine. I agree to your terms. I have one too.”
He settled instead for raising the edges of the mask every few seconds to let the cold air seep in. It soothed the heat but it didn’t last and he was on his feet in frustration ten minutes later.
“I need to be going now,” he said.
The other two people were a couple with a bundle of cloth between them. Both the man and woman looked young, maybe as young as his parents had been when he’d been born, and the mother crooned over the bundle.
He disentangled his arms slower than Draco would have liked.
"The next time you and Mr. Zabini decide you would like to leap onto each other you will find yourselves out of my classroom. Understood?"
Harry spun round to meet his gaze. “Of course I know the answer but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to hear.”
He turned and saw Pansy swimming towards the surface faster than he’d ever known her to. She was too far ahead to see him and panic filled him. Had she disturbed something? There was only one thing big enough to make such a sound.
He thought he saw Potter flush but before he could be sure his gaze flicked to something behind Draco and hardened. Draco had to resist the urge to pout. Was Potter still upset about the fight they'd had? Draco's nose wrinkled, what right did he have to be upset? He had been the one left standing there, alone.
{HPDM}
Draco glanced around. “We have the bread..."
By the time they got to King’s Cross Station, Harry felt better. Not okay and not great either but he supposed better was as good as he could ask for. His eyes were no longer red and his nose considerably less stuffy.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy," he said prodding his cheek with each syllable, "you will get up this- shit!"
“He’s out on the porch smoking cigars with Kingsley,” Tonks said emerging from the kitchen with a jar of peanut butter and some of the bread.
“A little. It still has to heal on the inside.”
"Come on, Draco. You know how he'd just love to kick you off the team," Pansy said loading more fruit onto her plate.
“You know me well enough by now, Severus. Do you think when you sleep in a den of vipers you do not prepare yourself every day to either leave or survive a bite?”
There had been no ‘us’ in the agreement but Dobby and Harry shared a bond, there would be no objection.
Harry smiled and ran his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Fur rippled on his skin as he stepped into the glow of the moonlight and let out a howl. He lifted a limb and swung it through the air in a high arc allowing himself to feel the power behind the action. Despite his earlier loath to feel anything but distaste for his new form, something tugged at him.
There was a flash of blinding light as the length of wood slipped out of his grasp and he was dangled upside down in the air. His eyes were wide with rage and. His body quivered dangerously. He was panting. Draco heard someone call his name but ignored the sound.
Harry was about to get in but he turned to Draco who was watching him with some exasperation. “You’ve still got your clothes on.”
Lucius leaned back.
Nott did not have to know that.
“It’s not something I like to think about,” he said, “going back to that house.”
Harry didn’t say anything but it explained why Lupin had the lighter.
Draco turned to Harry with an apologetic expression.
A chuckle.
“I was checking if it was another prince book.”
Harry allowed himself a deep breath.
“He who?”
. He gave Dobby an apologetic albeit sleepy smile.
"Should be ready now," he muttered taking out his wand and dipping it into the maroon potion.
He wanted Harry to meet his family first, as much of them as he could in two days. He wanted him to be sure what he was signing up for. He wanted him to know what it meant to involve himself with Malfoys.
Harry obeyed despite the frown on his face.
He came away from the mirror and stepped into the room. “You handled mother better than I expected.”
Narcissa didn’t eat anything with her tea.
“Do I still get pie afterwards?”
It didn't take them long to get ready and in less than twenty minutes they made their way down to the great hall. They were already a good number of feet from the common room when Draco realised with a pang that he had forgotten to take his daily doses.
Like him, Lysandra had not known her mother well, if at all. At least she knew her father. It would be cruel to have them both taken away and have nothing but the Malfoy family to fall back on.
And suddenly Harry knew what this was about and jealousy couldn’t have been further from it.
Harry remembered something about the pull between them and the full moon approaching. There’d been something about mating too. They hadn’t… mated yet.
“Easy for him to say,” Draco said as Warrington kicked his legs apart. “No one’s calling
"Is that why you've been skipping meals and sleeping less?"
Draco rolled his eyes but there was something else there, something that looked suspiciously like disappointment mixed in with other things Harry couldn’t identify.
Draco didn’t like the way he asked the question.
"Yeah, what've you been doing all weekend?" asked Harry.
“What do you think you’re doing?”
“Do you mean did I anticipate on what day, hour and minute you would walk across this corridor and climb those stairs with intention of careening into you and scattering all your homework and mine on the floor as well as wasting my ink on your shirt and obviously expensive scarf?”
He may occasionally let things slip but such thoughts were rarely in his head when he was on edge. And if he had said anything incriminating, someone would have come for him now. Dumbledore wouldn't allow a threat to his life to wander the halls of Hogwarts unchecked. If he knew how far gone Draco was, he wouldn't hesitate to commit him to St. Mungo's.
Known
He wanted to laugh at the thought. He was falling to his possible death and all he could think about was the Hospital Wing.
A laugh. “Chewed me out. Went on and on about entitlement and the like. But there was nothing they could do in the end. It’s family property. The ownership can’t be denied.”
It would only show poor use of common sense on his part.
“We need to leave now.”
A sexual history.
"Just because you got a perfect grade last time, Potter, doesn't mean you have to botch it for the rest of us."
Of course, it had helped that Draco insisted on fucking every night, sometimes twice. He let Harry fuck him once but the week leading up to the shift didn't allow him to do it often. Harry didn't care either way and Draco picked up on that of course.
"Dying," Hermione pointed out silently.
“I’m not promising I’ll find anything but watch your back.”
"Look, what I said in the Hospital Wing," he said wanting to get the matter off his chest. He wanted the chance to explain his actions. "I don't know what came over me-"
Draco smiled.
Hermione shook her head in shame. “Nothing, sir.”
"You will have the Masquerade," he said.
"I could ask you the same," he said swaying slightly. “But I can't bring myself to care about the-" he gestured to Harry with obvious distaste- "
Draco didn’t respond.
He shouldn’t.
He knew it had been done for Draco’s benefit but his godson disliked him almost as much as Snape disliked Harry. He would never do anything to make his life easier.
He ached to crawl into bed. His muscles felt heavy and his bones cried out when he moved. He wanted to think about what happened that afternoon as much as possible. He almost detested morning because it would sweep reality into its arms.
“Cheese and onion,” Harry said.
Harry cursed and folded his arms over his chest even though he knew it looked childish. Draco stepped back so he would have enough space. He tied the tie with practised ease and handed it back to Harry who pulled it over his head. Draco watched him fasten it around his neck then reached to adjust the angle.
“This,” he said holding up his scarred arm, “isn’t something I should do. I know that and it does hurt but…”
He stepped aside. “You go, I...”
Draco didn’t respond but as he tracked the footsteps up the to the door, he thought he felt a glimmer of something inside him.
“May I borrow him for a little?” Druella asked though her arm was already at Draco’s elbow.
Malfoy seemed to enjoy that.
His station had been in direct line of sight the common room door. The very place where Harry had been when Malfoy… did the deed.
Draco was certain he heard the Gryffindors snicker. "Yes," he gritted out his hand gripping the cauldron firmly, almost desperately. Then added as an afterthought, "sir." There had certainly been no leaping involved.
She smacked his arm. "Don't do that."
The thickest letter from Hermione and it took a good three minutes to read She was alright and glad to have some quiet time for once though Hogwarts seemed a little tense. She’d conveniently used the last bits of parchment to talk about library books instead of elaborating on what ‘tense’ meant.
A flash of brown caught his eye, he turned to find a door that had most certainly not been there before. He looked around him to make sure no one was about, pushed the large double doors open and stepped into the room. It was large, nearly as large as the parlour at the manor with plush velvet sofas, a glass coffee table with a tray of tea and sandwiches, cream walls and a fire roaring in the fireplace.
he felt like adding but didn't.
He contemplated searching the castle for Draco but that would take time and he was starting to feel somewhat drowsy. Better to wait here.
“I will.”
"Nicholas," Draco supplied staggering out of plain sight.
Draco’s glare was peevish.
Beside him, Draco shut his book with a curse and began looking for his socks and shoes.
Draco’s fists clenched.
You don't know the half of it.
“Peppermint. Like your toothpaste.”
“Why the bloody hell would he need to be attending the Masque?” Blaise demanded. “Don’t we see enough of that prick in school?”
Draco’s nose wrinkled.
{HPDM}
The door slammed open jolting Harry out of his reverie. His fingers paused on a pair of pyjamas. Ron made his way into the room looking anywhere but at him. Harry ground his teeth in irritation.
Lino had reappeared. He set the plate of biscuits and tray of tea on the coffee table before bowing once more.
Harry saw Malfoy bite back a curse. "I, er-" He shot Snape his most venomous glare and swore to pay him back in kind when the time was ripe.
"Professor, I have a feeling Draco is already aware of who his mate is," Snape interjected from behind them.
Draco shoved him against the wall faster than Harry’s eyes could follow. Ron gagged as Draco’s forearm dug into his neck. He kicked and squirmed until his face began to redden.
Harry sighed and threw the sheets off his body, or he tried to. Draco watched in exasperation as he made a second attempt to get up.
He’d had no reason to anticipate this. He had never planned for Potter to meet his parents. His mother might have phrased it as a request but he knew that it was not.
Lino must have let him past the wards then. Narcissa searched for a suitable response.
He wondered whether it had missed Alphard too. That led him down a different path altogether and before he knew it he was trying picture a ten-year-old Sirius playing out here. His parents would have encouraged magic outside school, of course, maybe even taught him a few spells. Who had his friends been before he met the Marauders?
Twice.
“Harry, I know you don’t want you to think about it but… there’s a point to all of this.”
Banging and wailing began from the attic.
“Yes, but what are the consequences if I don’t come?”
How could something so fundamental have gone unnoticed between them?
Harry didn’t think his speech would be so long. But he didn’t protest and got himself clean and dressed before Ron could come in to tell him to “hurry your arse up, Harry!”
Draco’s gaze snapped to him. “What?”
“What did you want?”
Draco walked straighter as they approached the seventh-floor landing. His leg still had not healed and he avoided moving his left shoulder when he could but he looked much better than he had when they’d left the room. Harry glanced behind them, wondering for the first time why Crabbe, Goyle and Warrington didn’t follow.
It was the sheer value of Draco’s possessions.
“They’re not.”
It was not Pansy who answered for she had moved away to oversee the setting up of the gramophone. It was Nott who spoke instead. "He's upstairs reading or something."
“You’re not acting very Malfoy-ish at the moment.”
Harry doubted Draco had been an exception to the rule.
"Wha- Are you fucking serious?" he demanded.
"Ron," Harry admonished, "don't disrespect the cards."
Harry frowned trying to recall something.
Harry was forced to step through the portrait hole, his invisibility cloak bundled in his arm. The first thing that struck him was that it was enormous. He had been here before obviously but that was two years ago. He didn't think he could remember how it looked then.
Zabini bridged the gap between them again and placed his hand on Harry's shoulder before shaking his hips in the most mesmerizing way.
Abraxas ran a handkerchief under his nose and sniffed into it loudly.
A primal part of him had revelled in it. Stroking. Whispering. Scenting. Wanting to mark again and again...
Fear.
{HPDM}
Draco kept his gaze neutral but couldn’t help that it slid to Severus. His face betrayed little emotion and he knew he was on his own. Severus had always threatened to throw him to the wolves. The irony wasn’t lost on him now.
He wasn’t wholly incompetent but he didn’t have his priorities straight either. He put injured players on the pitch and took good players off it for no clear reason. Even so, Harry was loath to concede that the Slytherin team was still a formidable force. With Nott and Malfoy as chaser and seeker respectively, it wouldn’t be easy to beat them.
“You’re here.”
Did she know who ‘he’ was? Did everyone know who the ‘he’ they referred to was or was he just an abstract concept in their minds? But then Ginny was dating Not and if he’d heard something or knew something…
Maybe if he kept his voice calm… then what? Draco didn’t look as panicked as he should and that alone had Harry’s nerves on edge.
“I’m ready.”
If only he could feel the heat Draco felt in his clothing or the dryness of his throat.
Harry fiddled with the cuff of his silk shirt, gaze averted. Merlin, had he drunk too much already? Was that it? No. Three glasses. Just three. He turned back to Draco and smiled.
He blinked at her for a second before her words registered in his mind.
Haneul chuckled and Draco’s gaze moved to where he stood leaning against the wall, the broken pieces of his wand still in his hand. He hadn’t the fourth year was still there and the realisation that he’d witness the exchange between Harry and himself unsettled him.
Harry swallowed and unfisted his hand. There was a piece of parchment in it, folded so its contents weren’t immediately visible. Harry pulled it apart with shaking hands.
Draco nodded. “I want you to promise me something.”
Harry forced himself to look up.
Harry shook his head. “Forget the map, we don’t have time for that.”
Harry smiled.
“Theo,” he said.
"The devil-" Ron gave a sigh of resignation- "which stands for illness."
“You should try these,” Harry said pushing the platter of biscuits towards him.
If Draco was surprised by the venom behind the remark he hid it well.
Draco hadn’t known but it wasn’t surprise in his voice when he said, “I’m proud of you.”
“I can tell,” Harry said swiping a hand down his own face. “It’s been a long day.”
It had taken Blaise, Nott, Pansy and a few seventh years to pull him off them and even then there had been blood. Less of it than Draco had wanted, a few cuts and scrapes hadn’t been enough to sate the wolf.
Haneul yelped and scrambled out of the parlour.
Draco looked up, frozen in shock. The light of his wand danced against his features and his school robes were burdened with whatever he’d stowed in their pockets.
Draco looked down at his clothes as though he’d forgotten they were there.
{HPDM}
A few feet away from them, Blaise had put aside his pristine copy of
He did not know why he said it but he felt the inexplicable need to do so. He cared only slightly more for him than they did but not for the same reasons. Nott was such an oddity among the Slytherins for one reason alone. He was the most un-Slytherin wizard in the history of Slytherins.
He knew the answer to that.
Harry snorted.
He swayed on his feet but appeared otherwise lucid.
“What’s going on?” he asked.
He knew whoever it was could hear him but he couldn't care to be quiet.
{HPDM}
"I don't know," he said spooning some chicken stew into his mouth. "I wasn't really expecting much..."
“Ever the polite host,” he said, grin still on his face.
Draco nodded and stripped himself of his clothing. He didn’t rush but there was a briskness to his movements. He set his clothing aside and stepped into the centre of the clearing where rays of moonlight struck the ground. He stood there for a moment, face tipped towards the sky, eyes shut against the moonlight.
Harry pretends to be shocked, “you
“You let him read your textbook?” She cries, “you don’t even let us into that thing!”
and giggles again.
“Like a man? Like a man?” Malfoy repeats, almost swallowing the words, “I’m not a man. I’m a boy” he spits. “I am sixteen years old. I’m a kid, Potter. Not a man.”
Harry goes to argue: he really doesn't want to see Pomfrey.
“Come back after class tomorrow. I’d like to speak to you, now go,” Vargas orders, then turns his back to Draco, attention on the other students. Draco stands slowly, and with Pansy makes his way through the classroom and out the door, sparing a cursory glance behind him. The class seems to already have moved on, Weasley absorbed into Potter’s group. Potter turns to look at him, and they make eye contact, the connect searing into Draco. He hurriedly breaks it and spins back around, intent on leaving the classroom without making another scene.
and another chapter! i’ve got two more in the wings, so the updates should be prompt.
“Your nose. It’s red,” he says, staring at Malfoy’s face.
Harry cocks his head to the side, “I’m sure that’s not true. Let’s see a Protego.”
and another one! it's short too, and a little earlier than i thought i'd post it! woooo
And there’s more tears. Draco bawls silent sobs, and Harry is at his side in a flash. Harry's arms envelop him, and Draco's crying uncontrollable sobs into Harry's chest. The last time they’d seen Narcissa, she’d made Coq au Vin. That was three years ago. Narcissa had died suddenly, a heart attack in the bathroom late at night, no goodbyes. It had been hard for Draco for a long time, and he’d only bounced back a little over a year and a half ago.
“I’ve got a task. I've got to hurt someone. Someone important. More than hurt. I've got to kill them. I've hurt other people along the way. The wrong people,” he sounds like he’s recited this before, “If I don’t kill them, if I don’t complete my task, he’ll kill my parents. He’ll kill them. And I can't be the reason my parents die.” Malfoy’s tears have dried on his cheeks and his fists are clenched at his side, face stoic & void of emotion.
This was turning out to be a little harder than expected.
Harry lifts his wand watching Malfoy as he does so. Malfoy flinches at the wand, and Harry stumbles back a few steps.
“You may not need the Defense NEWT to pass eighth year, but I’m sure you’re looking for a competent job after Hogwarts, no?”
The room immediately erupts into whispers as Granger leads Potter out of the Potions classroom.
kid in the back of the potions class, playing pranks with his friends, and going on unimaginable adventures. He’d disappeared last year, and come back unaware of the atrocities that had occurred in the castle; Su still couldn’t feel her toes from the curses lashed at her, and the scars that lined her arms and back still burned in the cold.
this fic is very loosely based upon the song ‘heather’ by conan gray. i’m a sad writer and honestly tried not to make this too sad, so bear with me as i try to create fake happiness :)
And there are tears in Draco’s eyes and he covers his mouth with his hand.
“I love you, you know that right?” Harry stares at him earnestly and Draco melts a little.
The rest of the afternoon goes much like this: Harry laughs, he smiles and jokes, Su’s smitten and charmed, and it doesn’t take long for Harry’s hands in her hair and hers in his shirt.
Harry’s eyes widen a little, he’s completely forgotten about the hawthorn wand sitting at the bottom of his trunk. He knows Malfoy doesn’t trust him, and even though the sight of the other student gave him a nauseous feeling, Harry knows he has to return the wand, and fast.
Vargas stares at Draco for a few seconds, “Malfoy. You’re not seeming to understand. There’s very little choice for you.” Draco stares back, even more confused.
“Because…?”
“Because you’re pretty, and I’d like to get to know you,” he responds, relishing the pretty pink blush that spreads over Su’s cheeks.
“So why are you nervous?”
“C’mon. This isn’t the answer.”
Pansy snorts and pats Draco on the shoulder comfortingly. She turns to Blaise, “good job with that. So subtle.”
, I’m just not going to waste my time with you!” Draco snarls. His loud voice attracts the attention of some of the corridor, immediately starting whispers. Draco glances around at the stares, grabs Potter’s arm, and drags him into an empty classroom. Potter’s eyes widen, but allows himself to be taken, stumbling as he goes.
“I-, I’m not sure that’s needed,” Harry intervenes, a little perturbed by the thought of learning from Malfoy.
Sophie reaches for him, but he dodges quickly and jogs off. She watches after, and
Malfoy nods and exits the room first, leaving without a goodbye. Harry doesn’t mind, his head full of cotton after being around Malfoy for this long. He thinks he hates Malfoy... The boy represents everything Harry refuses to be. But deep down, Harry can’t help but wonder if this hatred is due to years of thinking of him as the enemy, the
He doesn’t tell Pansy or Blaise about it. It was embarrassing enough that Potter knew he needed tutoring, but Draco thought he’d never survive the shame of telling his friends. It simply didn’t matter that the two of them had seen him at his worst (crying after multiple nightmares), nor that they’d seen him fail in class, but the fact that
Draco rolls his eyes, “there is
Harry watches Draco’s retreating figure, wondering how he ever got so lucky.
Pansy frowns and lays her head beside his, squeezing between Draco and the wall.
Harry smiles back and it reaches his eyes; tiredness or not, Draco’s smiles are the highlights of his day and he would do anything to keep them on his face. Draco hops off the island counter and makes his way towards Harry, and when Draco reaches Harry’s slumping and tired figure, he simply runs his knuckles across Harry’s cheekbone. Draco takes the bag off Harry’s shoulder and the suit jacket off the other, used to the late nights and what Harry needs. Draco whispers to him, “There’s pasta on the table, take a shower after. If you’re still up, I want to hear about your day.”
“You said I’d sleep here.” Nearly went to war with her for it. “Whatever is there must be…”
“You can’t tell Ron.”
"Before I leave," he said setting the empty teacup down though Narcissa had barely seen him drink anything. "Any letters you receive from Draco are to be forwarded to me immediately."
He could feel the hatred rolling off Draco in waves. When the coughing didn't stop, he shook his head. He muttered something about the private sitting room and Armand and strode out of the room.
"You seemed very talkative the other night," she hummed.
“How long?”
“Race you back to the clearing, you overprotective git.”
Draco was not most people. Even his casual clothes looked like something royalty would wear.
Harry swallowed.
Harry looked at him as though there was nothing to explain. Draco waited all the same. Harry was talking and maybe if he went on talking, he could hold it together until after tea.
?" he demanded shaking him slightly with each word.
Malfoy held his ground but averted his gaze.
He threw the outer door open not caring about the racket. He rapped once on the door to his godfather’s office and proceeded to step in uninvited.
Draco’s fingers grasped his hips but adjusted the angle of his body so that he loomed over Harry instead.
"Are you going to show up or not?"
"We waited for you."
He could almost feel it even without the bond.
He looked up from where he was buttoning his shirt. “Do Parkinson and Zabini know about us?”
“From that day on, the mark served as a reminder of my family’s mistakes… until I became a werewolf. Severus was the first to notice it was missing. I made him swear to keep it to himself but there was a price. If I ever needed help, I was to go to him.”
Draco rolled his eyes but his lips twitched.
Harry bit his lip and vowed to broach the subject when he could.
He bared his neck feeling that pit open up inside him.
Draco expected Potter to reiterate that show of dominance he had put up earlier. They had settled it with enough clarity but he wouldn’t put it past him. Potter rarely knew when to quit. He only reached down and grasped Draco’s right hand. The ghost of his warm fingertips sent sparks down Draco’s spine and his eyes flew open.
“What?”
Draco didn’t have time to for the resentfulness in his tone.
You could build sainthood with the entire wizarding world in comparison.
“He’s a werewolf, he’ll heal fast.”
Harry stilled, something about the wisps of emotion he caught from the bond weren’t right.
But Draco was also a good flyer and there was something about the way Potter looked at him on the field. The way he flew against him…
Harry tore his gaze away.
His lips parted but he said nothing. Harry felt like an idiot. His face coloured with shame.
Harry could not believe it. He still had so much more to learn from Dumbledore. How could he be dying? The only reason Voldemort steered clear of Hogwarts was Dumbledore’s presence. What would happen now that he was gone?
“It’s not lavender,” Draco exploded.
“Regarding the incident earlier,” Draco said talking above him. “You were right. I was not upset at you in the least. I wanted to…”
Harry let go of his hand and said, “We don’t want to miss the bus.”
When he did, Draco was no longer at the doorway. He stood two feet away from him with his hands in his pockets.
“You’re always in a rush after afternoon Herbology. And let’s not forget the fact that you look like that.”
“Taste what?”
He clenched his fists.”Look, Hermione. Professors can’t solve everything. Why do you think they haven’t found him yet? I’m not going to sit around and wait for–”
Maybe if it hadn't Draco, maybe if it had been someone else…
Draco just stared in shock.
Could feel the weight of his own answer even as he contemplated what words to say.
Harry arched into his touch, already feeling too hot.
“I’ve packed enough bath potions to ensure it.”
He tossed the packet of Barty’s aside with a scowl.
“Point made,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “But you can’t keep me here. I’m a guest.”
and cast a
She shook her head but there was a small smile on her lips that let him know she understood. She pushed back the bed hanging and a moment later the sound of her footsteps petered out.
“I also need you to stop looking at me like that.”
{HPDM}
He nodded mutely wanting nothing more than to keep her close but this time she was the one who pulled away from him. And he was forced to watch as she took his father's arm and left. He swallowed back tears. That was it, that was as polite a rejection as he would get from his father and it hurt, more than he wanted to feel.
She narrowed her eyes at him, an expression that meant she knew something and only needed to have it confirmed. "Were you paying attention?"
"Yeah, see you..."
The process was familiar – he’d seen snatches of it once before – but not much else.
“Well, if Potter had better manners then none of this would have happened in the first place.”
"Next one," he said eager to be done with it.
“What?” he asked unable to keep the edge from his voice.
“It seems you have gone ahead and consummated this… union,” Lucius said with traces of disgust.
“I don’t see what’s funny about that.”
"I'd really rather not-"
“You have a match.”
Ron meanwhile looked scandalised and Dean was smiling brightly.
“What’s going on with what?”
His gaze flicked to the mark, red and raw. The healing process had not begun yet. When it did, every inch of skin that sealed together would bring them closer and every time he broke the skin, he would strengthen the bond.
He watched her set the newspaper on the table. Draco dropped his hand from Harry’s back and sat down opposite her. Harry followed trying to breathe through the tension in the room. Draco examined the distance between them for a moment. He struggled with something for a moment then bridged the distance between them.
“You mean so much more to me than you think,” Draco whispered rubbing circles into his temples. “I need you to remember that.”
“What else did they say in the articles?”
“No,” Draco said this time with enough force behind the words. “Don’t. I’m sorry you had to endure that.”
They were in public most of the time. Merlin forbid the student body perceived anything resembling ‘neutrality’ between them. No one would ever stop talking. People talking about him was the last thing Harry wanted at the moment.
“I don’t have time for this.”
Harry had a feeling it was more than the walls this time. Draco withdrew his finger a moment later and Harry could tell from the silence that all the attention in the room on them. He didn't let himself think on it too much.
He almost thought Draco hadn’t heard him but the reply came a moment later.
Draco did and his eyes widened when something flashed across the screen.
Draco scoffed. “Nonsense.”
“What do you think?”
“Clearly, some tolerance is in order,” Draco muttered.
Harry didn’t tell him that there were so many people that had to live on through him. He didn’t tell him about his brave father or his intelligent mother, he didn’t tell him about beloved Cedric Diggory.
Harry stepped into the crammed study and shut the door behind him. Dumbledore motioned for them to sit. This close, the limpness of his hair and the shadows beneath his eyes were more obvious.
“Abraxas hates it as much as father,” he said at the questioning look on Harry’s face.
“Is it supposed to do that?” Harry asked.
He didn’t know much about it and he could tell from the way her face scrunched up she wanted to ask what kind of bond flowed between them but she bit her lip.
He preened over it in private but took it in stride the rest of the time. Even Blaise's jaw had dropped a few mornings ago. Draco could remember the entire affair with vivid clarity.
He made to stand up but Draco grabbed his hand at the last moment pulling himself to his feet as well. Harry staggered behind the closeness but Draco tugged him close. Harry’s heart was racing and he didn’t know why. All he knew was that he could feel the beat of Draco’s heart too and it
She batted her eyelashes.
"No," Snape said ignoring his impudence if only because he knew it would infuriate him further. "I have written to your mother and father, they will be seeing you this weekend in the headmaster's office."
Harry leaned over him and got a ceramic tin identical to the one Draco kept in his room. This bit wasn’t too hard. He knew Draco liked to draw out pleasure. His gaze followed Harry’s fingers as he dipped them into the jar. The sea-coloured liquid was cool against his fingers and gleamed in the evening light.
Harry wanted to swear. This was where Draco learnt his irksome ways. He couldn’t ignore the resemblance in how they spoke and their demeanour. How young had Draco been when he began to reject his father’s ideals?
The brick wall dug into Draco’s back. He felt too hot in his clothing despite the tie Potter had yanked off his neck.
Hermione drew in a deep breath and said, “There talk  about your relationship with Malfoy hasn’t subsided and such talk tends to… reach the wrong ears.”
"It's Firenze."
And they would not be well received, Harry knew as they walked into the dining room. Alphard sat beside Edward who looked better put together than yesterday. Both bore genial smiles on their faces, deep in conversation about the recent developments in the Wizarding World.
Lucius’s lip curled at that. He strode forwards without a word. Narcissa followed. He pulled out her chair and settled into his own moments later. He folded his hands before him on the table and settled his gaze on Harry.
"You're right though," she said. "It hardly matters what others think least of all my brother, the annoying-"
Draco who knew what was coming only sighed.
Draco arched a brow at her.
Nothing. There was nothing to say to that except maybe:
Dumbledore glanced around the room. “Has Severus arrived yet?”
Draco was struggling to remember which night she was talking about when it all came back to him. The night his parents had learned he was a werewolf, the night he'd sought solace within these very walls and sung songs – muggle ones at that – loud enough to wake the entire castle. That night. Had he said anything to her? What if he'd revealed the Dark Lord's plan? No, he'd built up a tolerance. Even when inebriated he wouldn't risk spilling such dangerous secrets to a ghost that couldn't keep its mouth shut.
Harry wondered if he’d always been so intolerable.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He does,” he said, thinking of Harry in the bathtub, Harry on their bed after classes, the walks in the quidditch pitch, silent moments on the bank of the Great Lake. “He does.”
He gave Harry a lewd wink then turned to the Slytherins and maimed retching. Cackles erupted from it while behind Harry the Gryffindors remained silent, neither coming to his defence nor fuelling the words.
Draco sighed.
“Can we get to the point?”
Harry supposed it had something to do with work. The last thing he needed to hear about so close to Christmas was school work. So he hadn’t asked.
“Nobody had–?”
Draco knew they had some way to go beyond snogging in dark corners. But by merlin, Potter’s obstinacy would end him. His complacency only showed its head when Draco had him pressed against a wall.
{HPDM}
To which Harry had replied:
“Shh.”
“When you saved my life during the match.”
"Don't be stupid, James. He obviously ran off with Pansy, apparently he's shagging her."
The boy tore his gaze away from them and went back to collecting his stationery as though they weren’t there. Harry turned to Hermione and Ron and gestured at his stained shirt.
“I need you to listen to me.”
It would all be meaningless a month from now, he told himself. People liked to give opinions and when they had nothing to say they would move on. He would be here and Draco would still be here. He would be fine.
“Sit up and take off your jumper.”
"Draco," she said coming into view.
He and Draco went in last and were forced to sit separately. Draco sat at the back next to a ruddy man with a handheld gaming console while Harry sat at the front where the driver engaged in heated conversation with a man holding up and pretending to read it.
Draco looks at the brown hand reaching towards him and sways forward, unsure about his decision now. He'd been so determined, so determined to pitch himself off this tower, to stop that voice in his head from eating him alive. But he’s unsure now, the kindness of his enemy (was he really the enemy?) unsettling.
Harry nods. “Cast a Protego. I’ll show you mine.”
When Draco finishes on his phone, he begins to eat, smiling around his spoon: the food tastes just like his mom’s. Harry comments on this.
Harry cocks his head to the side, “you volunteered for this Malfoy, you don’t have to be such an arse about it.”
“You need potions tutoring, Harry,” Slughorn says bluntly and glances at Malfoy, “and Malfoy here is one of our better students. He’ll tutor you.”
Malfoy doesn’t deign Harry with an answer, instead choosing to walk away, his boots clacking as they hit the floor. Harry watches him go, bewildered and confused at the exchange. Everything about Malfoy was confusing now. Ron had broken his nose, by accident, in Defense, and there hadn’t been a single outburst or dramatization, and now? he volunteered to tutor harry? It was beyond strange.
Harry thinks, red.
She hums, and as Harry drifts off, she calls the girls back, intent on scaring him awake.
Draco frowns at his friends, unsure of what to say. Blaise is disinterested, as always, and Pansy has too much interest.
“No. No, I don't think so.” Malfoy responds, his voice faraway and hollow.
“You know, Snape had a book like this.”
“I’m not nervous,” Harry says defensively and pushes Hermione’s legs forward so he can sit at the edge of the couch. “I haven’t taught anyone since the D.A. and, well, I don’t want to do a shit job.”
“You alright?” Harry asks, thrown off by Malfoy’s reaction.
time, and he never said anything, and…”
She scoffs at him, “coming from you? Who followed him around for 6 years? That’s rich Draco.”
“Yeah well, no one said learning wasn’t boring,” Draco replies a few moments later, doodling in his book.
“Then you know how important NEWTs are for you. The Wizarding World doesn’t want you, Malfoy. I know that sounds harsh, but it’s the truth. I want you to step into the world with as many resources as I can provide you,” Vargas slams his palm into his desk, causing Draco to flinch back a step. Vargas looks apologetic at the sound but continues, “So, Malfoy, you must pass this NEWT, and Harry, here, is going to teach you.” He looks up at Potter, “aren’t you?”
Harry nods, understanding the response, but he forgets his place, “then don’t die. Don’t do it. Get off the edge.”
Malfoy shoots him a dirty look, “Thursday, 8 pm, at the library. Don’t be late,” and Malfoy hurries up his walking, disappearing around the corner, leaving Harry behind.
She pats his cheek, “You’d sleep with even more girls.”
“Harry. We both need to learn about ourselves! I’m just 17, and you’re 18. There are
Harry approaches the girl and grabs his glasses, setting them on his nose, “this is the… second time I’ve forgotten them?”
“I never should’ve made Coq au Vin. It’s almost like I can hear her admonishing me for making it just a little too spicy.” Draco cries. “Oh— I miss her so much.”
He tumbles into the adjoining bathroom, the tiny room a compromise for the big windows in the sitting room. Washing his hands in the small sink, he glances up at the mirror above, but doesn’t register anything. The gaunt look under his cheekbones, the constant redness in his eyes, the gathering wrinkles on his forehead, and the growing beard around his chin all seem to recede behind the fog that surrounds him. Harry moves in an automatic motion, every action programmed into his memory by routine. His brain is elsewhere as his body moves. Harry reaches for the body wash in the shower and knocks over Draco’s shampoo. Draco’s. His lavender honey shampoo, almost empty, but not. It’s been weeks. Weeks of it sitting there, untouched, but Harry doesn’t have the heart to discard it. To discard Draco’s things. They’re Draco’s, how could he? Harry faces the same dilemma with Draco’s clothing. They sit, hanging in their shared closet, a constant reminder of the loss he’s faced. Some days he buries his face into Draco’s clothes, hoping for a familiar smell (he never gets one).
Potter smiles a little and begins to explain, “Snape had this potions book. I borrowed it for sixth year by accident. And Merlin was that one of the best ideas I had. Shit’s the only reason I passed Potions.” He snorted, “This reminds me of that.”
The red liquid explodes upwards, covering Harry’s face. His hands immediately fly upwards, trying to get the burning position off his face. Ron and Hermione are beside him instantly, smart enough not to touch him or throw spells, but muttering words of support as Harry shakes.
a quick heads up: i have read hundreds of other drarry fics, as such, there are a multitude of plot points that i may have accidentally taken.. linked onto the bottom of this chapter is a list of a fics in which i remember hearing about these plot points & i take a significant amount of inspiration from. however, if you see something in the fic that you recognize from your own writing, don’t hesitate to shoot me a message on my tumblr @sincerely-sia. i have no qualms about adding to the list :)
to leave the comfort of Ginny’s pretty red hair in his head, but the day had come where Ginny, too, wanted to move on and move forward.
Draco nods, “Yes, exactly.”
She smiles a little, won over, and sits back down, patting the ground beside her, “come, I’ll tell you what I’m reading about.”
Draco’s not sure why he closed down the conversation, but he has a feeling he couldn’t take anymore talk about Severus. Even thinking about his dead godfather made him feel like his emotions were going to snatch his leg and lead him into a downward spiral. He wasn’t sure if it was anger or sadness, or maybe a mix of them both. Anger because Sev had been a spy and never told him and had gone and died alone, or sadness because Sev had been a spy and never told him and had gone and died alone.
“Just a day after the first?” Potter crosses his arms and lifts his brows, openly making fun of Draco’s choice. Draco scoffs and leaves the room, silence following him. It seems a repeat of the day before, Draco leaving Potter behind, fed up with all this conversation with a person he’d never like. Merlin forbid he had a civil conversation with Potter, Draco wasn’t sure what the world would come to.
“Potter. You, you’re sure about this, right?” Malfoy asks, a little taken aback at the easiness in which Harry had agreed.
Potter glances down at the thick tome, back to Draco, and back down, “how am I supposed to learn from this?” he questions, confused.
Su looks down at the book and back up at the most famous person in this castle, “why?”
“I’ll go first then. My godfather died six months ago. He was all I had left. He’d promised to take me from the Dursleys, but that’s moot point now. My parents are dead, but I guess that’s old news. I’ve got a prophecy that says I can't live if Voldemort's dead. If I’m not jumping off, I don't think you can.” Harry's out of breath in the end, his chest hurting and eyes wet.
“Professor, McGonagall never specified that Defense was necessary. I truly don’t think…”
move on from this?” Draco whines a little, tired of the constant harry potter talk.
They weren’t supposed to be friends. Not at all actually. A death eater & The Boy Who Lived (twice)? absolutely forbidden. However, as Hogwarts would have, it pushed them together, but not long after, the world intervened, and the results of its intrusion have yet to be seen.
Harry doesn’t need to be persuaded to save anyone, he’s already running. The teenager clutches the broomstick between his fist and scrambles to reach the astronomy tower, the staircases arranging themselves in help. He trips his way up the last staircase, his haste bruising his toes. Harry bursts through the astronomy doors, and into the sun. There is an artificial sun gleaming in the sky, only visible from the inside of the tower, bathing the balcony in light.
he was doing.
“What are you doing?” Ron asks, leaning his head on his headboard, confused.
He finds her surrounded by people, laughing loudly, her hair a mess from a little third-year braiding it.
She was kind, loving, and the perfect person to break Harry’s heart. He loved her all the more for it.
“Malfoy!” Weasley shouts as he sees the blond boy fall face-first onto the hardwood floor, missing the mat by inches. Blood spurts from Draco’s nose as he slowly sits back up, pale face flushed a deep red in shame. Professor Vargas looks down at him, disappointed at his lackluster performance.
at defense!” Weasley says, imminently denying any fault of his.
“Hey, Potter, you too, stay,” Vargas says gruffly, finally looking up. Draco’s jaw drops open, intending to state his disapproval of the situation. Vargas holds up his hand.
“Draco! Why do you look like that?” Pansy said, bounding into his room, Blaise trailing behind, head down untangling some necklace his mother had sent him.
Harry’s been unable to wash Draco’s pillow. He leaves it as it is, not touching it (Draco hated when he’d touched it), leaving it waiting for him to return. The pillow is dusty with unuse, but no matter, it won’t be moved for a while: Draco will always need a place to sleep.
they said.
Draco was very aware of the fact that he didn’t raise his voice and didn’t need to. But he betrayed none of that on his face.
It would burn, he knew. If he was foolish enough to get close enough, foolish enough to touch, it would burn.
"I don't think you do."
“Draco, let him go.”
“Taking off my shoes,” Harry said without looking up.
"Mmm," Draco said absentmindedly as he fingered the buttons on his silk shirt.
He’d asked the question and know he would rest easy until he knew.
Harry – perhaps to prove he had better sense or perhaps out of curiosity – said, “What for?”
"I was trying to wake the bastard up okay?" Blaise said. "He was going to miss Stone's emergency meeting."
Harry could already feel little sparks of fire there.
He may have wriggled a few explanations out of him but he was his mate. It didn’t count because unless one of them died they were stuck with each other for the foreseeable future. And considering the lengths to which Malfoy had gone to save his life, it was unlikely.
“I haven’t seen you all day,” he said with a weary smile.
Draco swore as he rounded the corner. He debated on whether to take the shortcut but on seeing the Slytherins at the other end of the corridor decided it was the best idea. Blaise could be among them but he would find him later, Severus was more important at the moment.
Draco made his way back to the writing desk where he slipped some parchment into his bag.
“You, no,” Draco said setting everything down. “But I have to shift in a week or so.”
“Master Draco requested breakfast for Master Potter and himself.”
Merlin, he needed him.
"Surely you cannot be serious Albus, the boy is merely sixteen, he... he is not ready."
He would have to write home soon and not just to his mother. He needed to submit a status report of some sort. Of course he would make it sound like he was close, very close to figuring it out but he knew that all his big talk would have to backed by something.
He chased down the rest of the brandy with a sigh of satisfaction. "Is that all you had to speak to me about, or was there something other than the sleeplessness?"
His breath was hot when he brought his lips to Harry’s ear and said, “I’m going to take you apart, Harry. I’m going to dismantle every misconception you have of pleasure. And then slowly piece everything together until you beg me to do it again.”
His gaze moved back to the bed knowing it was empty save for him but still needing to see it.
"Potter," a familiar voice called.
Draco shrugged.
“Has very little to do with it,” Draco said. “Was what you felt mere arousal?”
Pansy turned and walked off and Draco didn’t wait before she was out of earshot before saying, “You had something to say? Say it.”
“Spritzed?”
Draco ignored the glaring truth of what he had been about to say.
“Withdrawals. They need to… run their course.”
Harry glared back.
“You come with me.”
Harry prodded his ribs.
“Well. I’ll be off to the East Wing then.”
For a moment Draco thought he was going to kiss him again but he didn’t. He took his hand and kissed the inside of his wrist again. It sent a flutter up Draco’s spine and he wondered if Potter knew what lay beneath the cuff of his shirt. If he would still kiss his wrist like that if he knew.
Harry was surprised to see that they’d already reached the East Wing and Draco’s room at that.
Leave it to Snape to diminish the severity of what he did. It was the first step to earning back someone’s trust after abusing it. Textbook manipulation that Draco knew by heart.
“He didn’t look like he was exaggerating and he knows better than to try that with me.”
The rest of the ride passed in relative normalcy, they played at cards for half an hour before Ron grew bored and insisted on chess. He kept them at that for two hours and would have gone on longer if Hermione hadn’t put her foot down. She drew a blanket up to her chin and hunkered down for a nap.
There would be no going back from this whether he’d made an enemy of Severus or no. There was too much hurt between them, too much distrust.
Malfoy scoffed. "You can't tell me what to be."
“He just needs a bit of food and water.”
Harry opened his mouth to answer but found he had no answer to give.
{HPDM}
Harry’s gaze moved to where Draco stood and watched him nod to the man.
He wriggled once more and managed to look innocent while doing it.
"Good for you Neville," he said.
Draco glanced down at his left thing spread out beneath him and Harry laughed.
That thought alone brought him some measure of comfort.
Harry sighed. “Fine but we need to get away from here. How long until you start healing?”
Hermione dug her heels into the ground. “Harry, he was going to help us.”
Draco had said he would do it today, he hadn’t said what time – a fact he seemed to be taking advantage of. Well, Harry would do. Waiting wouldn’t do either of them any good and it would only make him feel more foolish if it all turned out to be nothing in the end.
"Harry?" he heard then someone rustled the shower curtain. He grabbed the soap and started scrubbing at his body. "Are you coming, we're going to have breakfast."
"I uh... I don't know. He wouldn't say," Harry replied frantically. "What's going on?"
"Defending him?" she sputtered. "I'm just saying he's... he's different this year, that's all."
He turned away from them, unwilling to bother discerning who was who but at the last moment one of them stepped away from the group and approached. Draco froze and this time he really looked and what he saw shocked him.
"It's not like he didn't deserve it," muttered Ron.
Criss-crossing lines of red, flashes of white muscle beneath them and blood… so much blood on Draco’s arm, on his own palms… He shouldn’t… Draco shouldn’t be conscious, merlin, this should hurt and yet…
“Harry is not an object to be possessed or a vessel to rid this world of its corruption. It's time you realise that. Harm him, then all those stories of the redhead lady will be meaningless and you every bit as horrible as they say.”
Draco watched him with dawning realisation and that was the moment Harry knew he’d done it.
“No, wait,” Harry said grabbing a hold of his left arm.
It gave him something to do but he had already been doing it too long and Malfoy was looking at him... Harry couldn't really see his expression in the darkness and he hoped the same went for Malfoy.
Harry snorted. “You just did.”
And Sirius had spent every day here. Harry had blamed him for his own death more than once, in fits of rage and sorrow he’d let himself believe that if Sirius had just stayed put – if he’d just listened – he would have been alive.
“They
Professor McGonagall nodded and returned to her seat.
Draco must have been in a hurry to get here if he brought it with him. He couldn’t have brought it here to show Harry, could he? Was this some sort of invitation? He looked up to find Draco watching him.
Fuck.
Potter’s eyes averted for a moment but that was all Draco needed to confirm his hypothesis.
Blaise still watched him carefully but Draco could care less, he didn't have an iota of proof. And he should have known better than to use Draco's own glare on him in an attempt to squeeze something out of him. Pansy unwrapped her arms from his body and he seemed to recall having told her he didn't like hugs but he knew she was doing the only thing she thought would comfort him.
Harry heaved himself onto it with exhausted limbs. He only just managed to do so before he hit the ground. He did one lap around the pitch to allow himself to catch his breath. Then he landed at the centre of the pitch. Both teams had convened before a worried Madam Hooch, Professor McGonagall and Snape.
“He has his instructions and he’s promised to see them through to the end. Will you?”
“Not this time.”
“We might not be able to stop.”
Draco had the sense not to say the words aloud. Harry was grateful for it. He already knew if Draco went to the extent of vouching for a relative then they had to be something good. He didn’t need him to say it, didn’t need to hear the name, to remember what he’d gone through…
“Wait.”
Then she met his gaze and said, “You’re the one that has captured his heart?”
as he was knocked back to the ground. Draco – aware of the pain in his side and the amount of strength it would take to harm a werewolf – scrambled to get a look at his attacker.
"That's not the point, Ron," Hermione said. Then she turned to Harry, "Well?"
Blaise? It all made sense now. Why else would he despise him so much? And the stunt at the Slytherin party... Harry shook his head. Blaise had been trying to stir up trouble. Harry supposed he should be thankful. Draco would never have done anything about the bond otherwise.
“Stay and drink some more. I’ve heard you can drink the entire common room under the table.”
"We can't keep meeting like this," he said even though these meetings were about the most exciting thing that happened in his life these days.
Harry glared back.
Not yet.
It was much deeper than his and tugged at the vowels so they run together. Draco’s hand dropped Harry’s as they both turned towards the door.
In the end, Draco decided he would make a quick trip to Myrtle's bathroom on his way to the Astronomy Tower – drink free this time. He needed time to think, it was time he faced his thoughts, some of them anyway. He wasn’t sure it was time he did something about them other than attempt to drown them in alcohol and illegal potions.
“I know
He tucked the vials in the bottom of his trunk and in good time too because Blaise was pulling aside the drapes around his bed. "I see you're already up," he commented. "Pansy wants us to have breakfast together."
Hermione served herself some more mutton stew. “Leave it alone.”
“So you don’t see him often, in the washrooms?”
{HPDM}
Silence.
He didn’t seem aware — no, bothered — by how close they stood. Harry could almost feel the heat of his body on his skin and his scent was everywhere, it was driving him mad. He reached for the champagne at the centre of the table and drained the glass before he could think better of it.
“What did you mean when you said I was your intended?”
Harry looked up. “What is?”
He felt so stupid, like such a fool.
, Harry willed.
{HPDM}
"If you're quite done, I really think we should get going," Hermione said pushing her plate away and for a second Harry thought she was talking to him but she was looking at Ron. "The match starts in two hours doesn't it?"
Snape’s glare could have killed him.
“You come with me.”
“It's hard to know where your thoughts are these days.”
Draco smiled but Potter was smiling too.
Draco raised a brow and Lysandra shrugged.
Blaise laughed mirthlessly. "Cut the crap, Draco. We've snuck down there dozens of times."
Draco snarled when Harry crossed into the deeper part of the forbidden forest.
"What are you doing?"
“I’ll come with you,” Harry said.
{HPDM}
Draco put a hand on his shoulder in mock outrage. “Hurt?”
That was easier.
He wasn’t sure it would work but...
“If you’re not going to tell me, Harry, then what do you expect me to do?”
“I think it’s customary for knights to do whatever the king commands.”
"No, I meant the
Malfoy cared too much about nuance to reduce himself to that.
The coat was in his hand again. “One more word.”
Draco paused his neck.
Draco felt the wolf snap its teeth not in irritation but in response to the challenge. Harry, he was learning, could be both soft as silk and sharp as a blade. It was a distinction he was only learning to understand.
Draco stopped when his heels brushed against the first stair. Harry stopped inches away from him and Draco wanted to take him then, he wanted more than he’d wanted to be free because this was being free, this was what it felt like to live.
Draco leaned forwards so his face was inches away from Harry’s.
But first things first. He sent a
Snape followed behind him looking displeased as he always did. Harry wanted to ask what he’d done with Dumbledore but held his tongue.
"I'm not sure what exactly it is you're hoping to see-" began Draco thanking Merlin his voice did not waver but the professor did not let him get far.
But it was a double-edged sword – one Draco possibly didn’t realise he was dealing him. If Harry said no then he’d have to suffer whatever punishment Narcissa would exact on him for refusing her in her own house.
Dean chuckled and brushed his fingers through Seamus’s hair. The gesture warmed Harry's heart and images of his own hands in Draco's hair came to mind. “Welcome to the club.”
“Why didn’t you mention this?”
Draco leaned his head against the tree bark and was content to let himself drift off until the pain began to creep in when he heard galloping. He grabbed his wand from the ground and it nearly slipped from his fingers.
He paused and Narcissa wondered for a minute if she has pushed him too far.
Harry had been having reservations about the plan since Draco told Hermione and Haneul to and the only reason he’d stayed was that he’d promised himself not to leave Draco behind again. He didn’t think he could actually be of use with whatever “complex spell work” Draco was going to do. So far all he’d done was keep an eye on McNair and Zabini, part of him wished they would try to escape.
Lino rapped on the door long and loud. Neither Harry nor himself stepped away from each other like guilty lovers and Draco was glad they’d moved past that stage. He wasn’t sure lovers was the term Harry would like but they could go into that later.
But none of that mattered as much as the hands on his skin.
"Of course, I should have known."
“What are you waiting for, your fucking tea time?”
Cygnus narrowed his eyes at her but she didn’t appear the least bit intimidated.
“That’s too broad and you know it.”
“For heaven’s sake, will you shut up?”
After what Sirius had done…
The sound of galloping was now getting nearer and Draco was certain the dark figures he saw rushing through the forest were not mere figments of his imagination.
He cringed as pain flared to life in his body realising it was beginning to tire and not from carrying Draco either. He could feel the anger as it left his body robbing him of what had been keeping him upright.
“I won’t. I have no reason to make this pact.”
Harry run his hands through his hair and strode to the window.
He wasn't supposed to be anyway but when had Harry ever done what he was supposed to?
his brain supplied before he could shut the thought out.
“I don’t know.”
He dipped the fingers of his left hand into the bowl and hissed at the coolness of the liquid. He had to turn his body at an awkward angle to both keep his hand in Malfoy's and swab his forehead with the cold liquid but after a while the shivering went down and Madam Pomfrey said he could stop.
Even on his worse days, he seemed to radiate something, anger, irritation, impatience but this… there was nothing beneath his wan skin. Nothing beyond fatigue and sorrow and pain from the bond.
There was a gasp. Even Draco felt a jolt of surprise course through him.
{HPDM}
Lysandra gave a hesitant smile and some sort of curtsy. Harry could only stare in bewilderment, he hadn’t seen anyone do this yet and was unsure how to proceed. When Lysandra straightened, the look on her face was expectant.
Harry didn't say anything.
Ginny nodded and grinned. “Thanks.”
Harry met Draco’s gaze. “What happened?”
“I’ll wait for you upstairs,” he said pressing a chaste kiss to his lips. “Find me after.”
“Father says he’s your intended,” Lysandra whispered tugging at Draco's sleeve. “Is he really?
“My goodness, I hope you know I don’t do quick fucks.”
He couldn't remember the last time Blaise had taken that tone with him. It sparked something within him.
He surveyed the length of Draco’s torso, visible from his half-unbuttoned shirt. He let himself bask in the waves of heat radiating off Draco. The want and the need that filled the space between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It has to be something only the other person would know,” Lupin said. “And I suggest you two think of something. It’s far easier than you think to insert an impostor into our midst.”
Draco kept his face impassive. “I’m not going to say I told you so if that’s what you’re waiting for.”
“Put it away,” Draco said through gritted teeth.
Instead, he pulled away and slammed all the way into Draco, he writhed and panted, fingers bruising, mouth punishing, body slick on his… Harry didn't stop, not even when Draco tossed his head back and let loose a torrent of words and sounds Harry couldn't recognise.
Draco’s nostrils flared when he caught Harry’s scent.
Draco wanted nothing more to stay by Harry’s side through however long it took him to get better but Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t allow him to. Not while she was healing him, even their bond wouldn’t be enough to grant him that so he left the Hospital Wing but barely made it a few steps before someone called his name.
Draco pulled back a moment later and began licking his way down Harry’s chest. He tongued his left nipple long and slow until Harry begged him to stop then he got to work on the other. Harry was panting by the time Draco’s mouth hovered over the band of his boxer briefs.
And Harry knew he could see him well enough despite the steam.
"Yes?" he said his voice now laced with irritation though Hermione was quite obviously on his side.
“I promise.”
“I want to hear you say mine,” Harry sitting up a little.
“Muggles? Through and through.”
Harry touched the tender spot on his neck.
The night air was cool against Harry’s skin as they made their way out of the castle and into the night. Invisibility cloak on, Harry kept pace with Draco as he strode out into the grounds. Draco picked up his pace when they entered the forest but said nothing.
“You think it’s alright to decide what I can and can’t do in my personal life just because you grew up here and I didn’t? Because I’m the ‘Chosen One’ and a symbol of hope? Well fuck you and fuck your ideals. I am not your saviour and I’m not here to make you feel better about yourself. Find someone else to pin that on.”
A knock sounded on the door and Harry rolled over and groaned into the pillow. The knock came again and he dragged his head upwards to find a scrawny third-year boy in the doorway.
Another half-measure, like everything else.
He didn’t think he could be here and not crack.
Draco grinned into the rough kiss and Harry was only dimly aware of the fact that they were in a corridor.
It hadn't been enough so Draco had knocked back three vials of the Pepper-Up potion because he needed to forget. But after two hours it began to wear off. He had drunk too much too fast and his body had metabolised it in kind.

Harry looked up in alarm and relief poured through him when Draco’s face peered down over him.
"Relax," Blaise said. "It's just a cocktail."
Blaise was suddenly interested in his plate of scrambled eggs and Draco was suddenly plagued by a piece of dry toast lodged in his throat. Hadn't he put marmalade on it? He distinctly remembered doing so.
noticed something. Then his gaze settled on Harry and he smiled that slow smile that made Harry’s stomach flutter.
“I’ve got bigger fish to fry anyway.”
“You’re not exactly in the correct state of mind to make decisions,” Tonks said tossing strands of hair out of her face.
Harry's eyes widened because he'd heard that before, he just couldn't remember where.
The matter aggravated him even more because he recalled that Potter and his friends has used such a room last year to hold their stupid Dumbledore's Army meetings. He knew it was on the seventh floor but the seventh floor wasn't just one corridor and he couldn't exactly remember which one it had been.
He crawled into bed when the sound of footsteps in the toilet picked up and just managed to see Dean press a kiss to Seamus’s lips before the door swung open and Ron stepped back into the room.
Nott didn’t answer, just kept looking through the parchment. He’d never been one for order, anyway. Of course, making notes with no order to them almost defeated the purpose of making the notes.
Draco watched him a moment, his face had the same look he’d seen this morning. He didn’t think Draco’s face had been built for uncertainty, why else would it look so strange on him?
Madam Pomfrey shot him an unforgiving look. "You will watch your tone young man or I will see to it that you are properly straightened out. And if I hear anymore vulgar language, I will ensure you freeze to death next time you end up here, am I clear?"
“There are things I wouldn’t tolerate from him, things I don’t tolerate but I’m not so ungrateful that I would...”
"What day is it?" Draco asked ignoring the question.
Dumbledore didn’t react to the cutting remark.
Warrington was already scrambling to the door. Draco watched him go, heart hammering in his chest.
He'd been feeling restless towards Malfoy ever since the events in the Astronomy Tower and he wasn't sure meeting up with him regularly would make things better.
“Why do you keep insisting on that? Am I so horrible that you have to justify what you feel for me as a product of lies?”
Dumbledore smiled at Draco. "I'm glad you're learning to express yourself."
“Keep going,” he said through puffs of air. “Won’t be… gone long.”
He tilted his head back and breathed through his mouth.
Harry knew work here meant spying on Voldemort for Dumbledore. They held differing opinions on that. Harry believed Snape was on Voldemort's side and Draco believed he was on no one’s side but his own.
Harry bit his lip and wished he could curl up into the sheets and die.
Draco ran his thumb over it again and Harry felt another jolt. It was like something in him was being yanked to the surface.
Once Draco was sure all the curtains were drawn properly, he took out his wand from his trousers. He pointed it the door and muttered an incantation that Harry didn’t know. He added a
Which he had asked twice now. And received no answer to.
He did not draw himself to his full height or look down at him as he always did others.
Nott waved his hand.
“Always afraid to step on anyone’s toes,” he said features twisting into an unflattering scowl. “Should have raised you myself. Even your father was better than this.”
He waited exactly five seconds before saying:
Harry turned to her. “Hmm?”
“Wait,” he said. “I need to think.”
Why hadn’t he told anyone? Had Malfoy threatened him with certain death? It was the most likely option but it still felt too good to be true. It was too common an occurrence for people to pick off Harry's secrets one by one. And this period was only the waiting stage.
Harry nodded and wrapped the scarf around his neck thankful for its familiar weight. The boy’s gaze flickered to his neck a second too late. The mark had faded to nothing more than a bruise now but he couldn’t very well wear it as it was. It looked more like a love bite than anything.
“Go on then,” Mrs Weasley said to Harry in a softer tone.
Parvati rolled her eyes, crossed her legs. She didn't even bother to keep her voice down. "Those are rumours, Ginny. Believe me, I would know."
Malfoy took a longer time to get to his feet. An action that appeared to cost him twice as much energy.
“Of course not.”
“Really, Blaise? My family is what you’re going to threaten me with?”
"Tell me what's bugging you instead of taking it out on me."
"Draco?
Malfoy remained ineffably calm during all this. But this was not his usual calm. It was though some potent ingredient had been added it. Harry saw it in the way Malfoy’s gaze caught his from across the Great Hall. The way it lingered and lapped up every bit of him it could settle on.
