Draco ran his hands through Harry’s curls. Stroking softly at first before tugging, twisting the strands around his fingers, holding Harry in place for a second, before letting go altogether.
Harry shook his head slowly before beginning to come into the room. “No, you didn’t.”
Draco gave him a look at this.
“We don’t have to do anything, of course. We could have a nightcap or a spot of tea.”
Harry, himself had his arms out to the sides, but now and then, he would bring them in and innocently touch Draco ever so briefly on his hips. His fingers softly brushing up against his sides before pulling shyly away.
His hands moved up Harry’s sides, sliding along his chest as he thrust his hips, making a flawed interpretation of Elvis. Harry couldn’t help but let out a bark of a laugh as Draco continued to dance up against him. The mood had shifted now between them. The intense desire which had been there between them only moments ago had simmered down to a carefree playfulness. If given a chance, Harry would still drag Draco off this dance floor and somewhere more private. But they both knew this wasn’t the time for easy hookups.  It wouldn’t look right if the birthday boy ditched his own party.
“Just sensed it?" repeated Harry, trying to make sense of the words. How could you just sense if someone was gay? He didn't understand. But again, it was Luna. Luna always seemed to have some hidden power to see things that weren't there in everyone else's eyes. She would good at reading people.
“Yeah...I thought I was over it. But it turns out I’m fucking not. I’m sorry.” There was a bitter note to Harry’s tone in the last few words. He would never be fucking over it, he thought. He ran a hand through his hair as he leaned against the doorframe of the room. He was afraid if he attempted to move any further he would most definitely collapse and that was something he didn’t want to do, especially not in front of Malfoy.
“You bastard!” cried Draco in mock rage. “You’re late!” He hit Harry lightly on the chest. Harry caught the hand with his own and brought it up to his lips to kiss, his eyes never leaving Draco’s face.
Just then, the atmosphere changed, and the whole population of club-goers roared to life as the first few notes of ‘You Sexy Thing’ began to play. He couldn’t help but grin as he leaned up against the bar and took a sip of his drink. Just like everyone else in the club, he liked this song too.
Her heart pounded against her chest as a feeling of nervousness washed over her. She didn’t know what she was walking into. She could feel Ron’s hand on the small of her back, but she took no notice as her eyes fell onto the form on the bed.
Malfoy gave a quick nod of his head before brushing past Harry, gently touching his shoulder as he did so.
“Fuck,” cursed Harry as his eyes snapped open and he looked towards the hallway. He shoved his glasses back onto the bridge of his nose before he moved.
“I am not the man I once was, Granger,” commented Draco, as if reading Hermione’s thoughts.
The long summer days soon melted away into Autumn. Some time had passed since that ruined second date with Malfoy. Harry had started to take his meds again like he should, two yellow pills in the morning, three blue ones at night. His moods were stable. He hadn’t had an episode since that night. Things of course weren’t perfect, but they were better; better than they’d had been in a while. He’d even started to see a therapist again, which was also helping.
Draco let out a whimper of approval as warmth spread through him. He rolled his hips, pushing into Harry’s hand on his cock, allowing for his touch to consume him as his ass clenched and unclenched. Harry had learnt rather quickly that anything to do with Draco’s ass went straight to his cock. The blond loved the feeling of dual sensations. He loved the almost overwhelming pleasure that washed over him when he was touched everywhere, all at once.
Harry slumped his head against the pillow, squeezing his eyes shut firmly and allowing for the sensation of Draco’s tongue on his body to take over. Draco licked at him leisurely. He explored his ass slowly, taking his sweet time opening up Harry and penetrating him lightly. A finger soon slipped in as Draco’s sucked on Harry’s balls, but it wasn’t nearly enough. Harry needed more.
“Low. Fucking low.”
Harry gave Draco a quick nod of his head, a small smile forming on his face before he began to lead them down the road.
” slurred Harry as the pleasure built within. He tried not to lose himself too quickly, though, in the rhythm of pumping into Draco. As much as he wanted to cum, he wanted it to last a bit longer. His hand gripped Draco’s hip as his other came up behind and took hold of Draco’s cock once again. His touch was deep and rough, just like how he knew Draco liked it.
Draco nodded his head before turning his attention to the task at hand. The tip of his smooth, hard cock poised at the entrance of Harry’s body for a second before moving forward.
He’d stayed in bed for 21 days. It was like all the energy had been sucked out of him all at once like a Dementor’s Kiss, leaving behind an empty shell. And that is what he felt like. An empty shell. Harry felt so fucking empty and alone. Everything he’d once cared about and enjoyed was lost to him. He was just so fucking tired and so incredibly sad. It just felt like the world was weighing heavily on him. All the walls he’d put up over the last few years were crumbling down around him.
“It all seems rather stupid and childish now. It happened just after Harry had been officially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 1. They were still trying to figure the best course of action to take to stabilize his moods. He was on all sorts of meds at the time. His moods were all over the place. He would have one episode after another it seemed. Nothing was working…” Hermione’s voice trailed off briefly as she thought back to those early days where Harry’s moods would go from being super upbeat and happy to low and depressed rather quickly. “Anyways, it was also around the time of my 21st birthday. I wanted a big party with all my friends and family. It was two years after the war and everything, things were finally looking hopeful. My parent’s memories had just come back and I wanted to celebrate. The night had started well, everyone was mingling and getting along just fine. Harry was even having fun, which was a plus for me.”
“I have to go,” he said, suddenly sitting back on his haunches and closing off the Floo before Hermione could get another word in.
He could hear the baby wailing from her bassinet in the next room over. The breaking of the mug must have awoken her from her nap.
“How was therapy?” asked Draco as he brushed his hair out of his face and braced himself for Harry’s answer. He knew that Harry wouldn’t give him any details on what they talked about. And Draco didn’t want to know. What Harry talked about with his therapist was a private matter. Draco just asked more in a sense of knowing what side of Harry he would be dealing with for the rest of the night. Happy, go-lucky Harry or sad and withdrawn Harry.
She led Harry through a door he hadn’t realized was there, through a noisy, loud dining room filled with business people, to the kitchens, through another doorway to a hallway, through another door which led to a set of stairs.
However, the small smile faded from Draco’s face, replaced with a look of concern. “I didn’t wake you, did I? I just couldn’t sleep.” Draco’s brows were fused together as he worried his bottom lip between his teeth. This was something else that Harry had noticed about Draco since they’d gotten together.
Harry turned his head briefly to acknowledge the freckled face man. A wave of irritation washed over him at Ron’s statement. Ron’s teasing was the last thing that he needed at the moment. The other man's banter didn’t usually bother him. He usually enjoyed it and would volley back, but not today. He knew perfectly well that he should’ve left this god-forsaken place by now and already be halfway across town.
Their lips met again in a heated passionate kiss as the rest of their clothes were quickly discarded and they climbed onto the bed.
“He does,” agreed the blond with a smile. He didn’t bother to mention that he’d sent Harry a very detailed birthday list a few weeks prior, with this shirt being at the top of said list.
Harry stood at the display of pink and red boxes for a second or two, just staring at them in slight disbelief. He couldn’t believe it was Valentine’s Day already. He knew some time had passed since New Year’s. But some days, it felt like only yesterday that Draco had broken his heart. He had talked at length with his therapist about Draco and the breakup. They were still trying to get to the bottom of why Harry hadn’t told Draco about this disorder in the first place.
“A date?”
Draco nodded his head. He remembered the whole conversation quite clearly. He’d played it over in his head numerous times over the months.
Although they had only been dating for five months and living together for one, it felt like it was longer. They were comfortable around each other. Maybe it was how open they had become with one another since Harry had told him about being bipolar. There were no secrets between them. There couldn’t be really. All lines of communication had to be open.
In the end, he had chosen a sage green button-up that Draco had bought him two weeks ago, especially for the occasion. Draco had said that the soft green not only brought out the green in his eyes but complemented the goldenness of his skin. On his bottom half, he wore a pair of fitted black jeans and Chelsea boots. Although the jeans showed off the muscles of his legs quite nicely, they made Harry feel like a stuffed sausage. And the shoes weren’t nearly as comfortable and moulded to his feet as his beloved Adidas trainers were. But just like the shirt, Harry knew Draco would approve. That was something that Harry wanted more than ever, to make Draco smile. He desired to have those smokey grey eyes running up and down his body in approval.
“You know there was one time where I couldn't stand to deal with Harry. It almost cost our friendship,” explained Hermione casually as if she was commenting on how the sky was blue.
It was then, when the song switched over, that things changed. Ron immediately reached out and pulled Hermione to him, ultimately breaking up the circle. Seamus then began to dance with Luna. Neville told Harry over the music that he was going to get some air. Harry just nodded and watched as Neville went. He debated on what to do next as he danced alone, watching as his friends danced together. He couldn’t help but feel jealous at how openly Hermione and Ron were at the moment with their physical affection. He was happy for them. He just couldn’t help but feel left out at times. He didn’t think he could ever kiss and dance so openly with someone like they were doing currently, maybe if he got another girlfriend. But never with a boyfriend.  He then abruptly turned his back to them. He awkwardly moved his hips to the beat of the music, closing his eyes as he did so. He would wait until the next song before breaking up with his friends again. Hermione and Ron were only handsy for a song or two before Hermione broke it up.
His boyfriend, Draco, had already texted him back, saying it was fine, but even with his boyfriend’s reassurance, Harry still felt like shit for running late. This was not how his night was supposed to start. He’d primarily planned on leaving work early. He’d even moved up his last client’s session by an hour so that he could leave the gym early for once and arrive at the party just as it was starting.
The rotten, almost sickly sweet smell filled the cramped kitchen of 12 Grimmauld Place, making it almost unbearable to breathe, especially when added to the humid summer air.
Harry once again met Draco’s eye. They exchanged a heated look before Harry’s hands were on the blond’s body again. His mouth attacked the side of Draco’s neck as his arms wrapped around his waist. His cock slid in between Draco’s cheeks as Harry held onto the curve of his hip firmly as his other hand began to play with a peaked nipple, rolling it between thumb and forefinger until it marbled.
that hot Indian guy across the street at Diagon Alley one day during the summer. Since then, his subconscious had made it his living hell to fantasize about the guy almost every night. Before then, it had been a small yet very fit Latino guy that Harry sometimes saw at the muggle gym he had frequented during the long stretch of days falling after at the end of the war. And for a long time before then, it had been Jake, a character from one of his Aunt’s soap operas. There had been others, of course, in between, sometimes like classmates. But Jake had been his main man of fantasy for at least three years.
He didn’t have the energy to feel or care about anything anymore it seemed. It all hurt too much. So he turned himself off. He became numb to the world and all reality. He even turned off his Floo, not allowing anyone to come in to visit him. He stopped taking his medication, figuring there was no point anymore. There was no point in getting better.
“I think we should do it again,” spoke Malfoy, not wanting to beat around the bush any longer. “And I mean not wait like months. I would like to see you soon – like tomorrow for dinner?”
He felt disoriented as he tried to wake up from his sleepy state. He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he's had. He laid there confused for a second looking out at the moonlight shining in from the window. It was dark outside now, he noted. He didn’t know what the time was but figured he must have been asleep for a couple of hours.
All kinds of thoughts raced through Harry’s mind as he sat there waiting for his husband to return home. He didn’t know how much time passed while the baby’s cries continued to increase in volume. There was probably a spell or something he could do, but his magic was shit when he was in a mood. He had a hard time controlling it when he was in a depressed state and didn’t want to take the chance of it going wrong where the baby was involved.
He immediately opened his eyes and stretched like a cat. It felt good. He felt good.
Harry didn’t say anything to this. He just continued to watch Draco through blurry eyes for a second before closing his eyes and letting out a deep breath. He could hear Draco opening and shutting drawers before the scratching sound of a quill filled the stillness of the room. Harry wanted to ask what the other man was up to, but he couldn’t muster the energy to form the words with his tongue.
“But don’t you wish to be normal?" pressed on Harry, not understanding Luna's desire to be different, not understanding at all her easy acceptance of being different.
Harry took a long sip from his beer, his eyes never leaving Draco, watching as he came into the common room with Pansy on his arm. Like the rest of the 8th year, Draco had discarded their school uniforms and robes for casual muggle clothing. People sometimes dressed up a little for the parties. Most of the time, though, people dressed casually in jeans and jumpers. However, Draco and all the former Slytherins, except for Greg, seemed to go that little utter step to dress up. Harry always secretly looked forward to seeing what Draco would wear each week. Draco did not disappoint tonight either.
Or tried to move at least.
“You really want to continue this evening on longer?”
But of course, just as he was wrapping up Sasha’s session, Andrews—the owner of the gym that Harry worked at as a personal trainer called an impromptu meeting with all the other trainers.  Andrews didn’t seem to give a rat’s ass that it was Friday night and that people might have actual plans. In Harry’s opinion, it could’ve waited until the annual Monday morning meeting. It hadn’t been as dire of an issue as Andrews had made it out to be.
“Fuck.” Harry’s mouth couldn’t seem to form any other word. He just stared down in disbelief at the pink heart currently peeking out from Draco’s cheeks. His cock swelled as he continued to stare. “Have you been wearing it the whole night?”
“Why is that?”
It was a few hours later, and Harry was adequately drunk. Along with most of everyone else at the party.  The common room was pulsing with the beat of the music. Someone had dimmed the candles on the walls, giving the entire room a moody feel to it. Everyone seemed to be up and dancing at this point in the party. All the heavy furniture had been moved to the sides of the room, making room for a makeshift dance floor.
“Brillant!”
“Mione?!” he called out weakly. His voice was rough and hoarse sounding from his crying earlier. He hated how pathetic he sounded. “RON! MIONE?”
He was the fucking saviour of the wizarding world, he shouldn’t need medication just because of some silly mood swings.
In the present,  Harry lay in his dorm bed, willing his erection to go away. He often woke up like this. Most of the time, he could get the unwanted erection away. However, all his usual tricks weren’t working this morning. His erection continued to throb painfully against the strain of his boxers. He let out a sigh before once again looking around at his roommates, who were still fast asleep.
Harry took Draco’s cock more firmly in his hand and continued to press against his groin with the other. He jerked him off slowly in long, smooth strokes, sliding his hand out to the tip until almost letting go before sliding down and pressing hard at the base. Harry felt Draco grow harder and longer in his hand. He began to move his hand faster and firmer along the shaft while he swirled his tongue over the tip of Draco’s cock. His other hand meanwhile began fondling Draco’s balls and running up the crack of his ass.
“Harry,” said Draco softly as he came to kneel beside Harry. The blond held a whimpering baby in the crook of his arm.
A smile slowly crept across Harry’s face as he continued to lay there for a second, staring up at the ceiling, listening to the birds singing in the bright summer morning light. Today was going to be a good day, he thought. He could feel it in his bones. He hadn’t wakened with the sense of dread looming over him, pressing the whole weight of the world down onto his fucking shoulders. No, today Harry Potter felt as light as a feather and it was bloody brilliant!
“You do,” whispered Harry in a rush.
But first, to do that, Harry had to come out to himself. Something he was still struggling to do, even months after shouting it from the rooftop of Grimmauld Place.
Harry licked his lips as he continued to allow the music to take over him. He desperately wanted to kiss Draco but knew he couldn’t give in.  He didn’t know if Draco was gay. He didn’t know anyone at Hogwarts who was. For all he knew, he was the only one. Plus, he didn’t want his first proper kiss with a fucking guy to be a drunken one in front of everyone to see.
“I wanted to be ready for you tonight.”
“Draco…” Harry began to explain but was cut off.
Harry shifted in his seat. He turned his gaze once again back towards Draco. The blond was looking at Harry with genuine interest and concern in his eyes. Draco gave Harry a small smile as they continued to look at each other before Harry replied. “I’m coming off of a low,” replied Harry honestly. “Tonight I’ll be pretty manic.” He scratched at the back of his neck nervously. This was the most he’d ever talked about his moods and conditions with someone who wasn’t his therapist or Hermione.
He’d yet to tell him about his diagnosis. Harry knew he should. But he was afraid that Draco would see him differently after that. Would start treating him differently when he did. Harry wasn’t ready for change.  He wasn’t ready to show that ugly side of himself to Draco just yet.
On the other hand, Draco loved parties, both attending and throwing them; he oozed confidence in a crowd. The blond positively shined when schmoozing with people. It was one of many things Harry admired about the man.
Draco gave him a look before nodding his head in agreement.
There was an awkward silence between the two men before Harry mumbled something about making himself at home before heading up the stairs to get ready. As he took the stairs, Harry’s mind slowly began to wake up. He vaguely remembered the coffee date with Draco, it seemed like a lifetime ago now. A part of him thought that he should just call off the date, saying he isn’t in the right mind frame for it. For it wasn’t him who had made the date with Draco, it was the manic version of him, not the real Harry. The real Harry didn’t wear tie-dye for a fact unless it was pride.
Harry had been in the process of making tea when the depression crept up on him, unnoticed. It was like some had snuck into the house and thrown a pillowcase over his head, blinding him into darkness. He’d been reaching up to get his favourite type of tea from the top cupboard when he realized it was out. An overwhelming sadness had overcome him. He knew it was stupid to feel sad and depressed over something as small as being out of his favourite tea. But sometimes that was all it took to submerge him in a deep low depression. If this had happened to anybody else, they would’ve just simply either had another tea, making a mental note to pick up more on the next grocery run or pick up the phone and call their partner who was already out at the store and ask them to pick up more. Draco had a mobile phone for this very reason. So that Harry could get in touch with Draco at a moment’s notice.
Instead, to Harry’s surprise, she smiled. A real genuine smile, one that reached her eyes.
“Thank you,” he stuttered as the hostess bowed before leaving him alone. Where the fuck was he, he thought as he glanced over his shoulder at the door that the hostess had just left through.
“It’s okay if you’ve Harry. We all have setbacks.”
Ever since their first date, when Draco explained to Harry how his name meant dragon, he couldn’t get the image of a dragon out of his head.
Harry screamed as he heard the Floo downstairs. He knew that Draco had left him for good and he had done nothing to stop it. He pounded his fists into the mattress before running his hands through his hair and tucking violently at the ends.
Harry felt an anxious knot twist painfully in his stomach as his left hand clenched onto the strap of his bag, and he held his phone in the other. He double-checked the address that Draco had texted him earlier with the one he had typed into the Uber app, making sure he was, in fact, in the right place.
“Kiss me, darling.”
“I’m sorry,” murmured Harry. His voice came out small and strained.
“What?”
Anyone with eyes couldn’t possibly look away from Draco as he continued to show off his disco moves.  The blond didn’t care if he drew attention to himself as he sang at the top of his lungs to his friends. He was drunk, it was his birthday, and he was having a good time. Plus, he really liked this song.
“I’ll grab the mochas, you grab a table?” he asked, gesturing towards the line in front of the till.
Harry thought for sure that Draco would question him further on his bipolar but surprisingly he didn't. Instead, the blond launched into a story about something that had happened at work the other week.
“What’s your mood level?”
Harry looked out the window for a second as he nervously pumped his leg up and down underneath the table. Harry could feel himself sweating even though it was quite cold in the coffee shop. The front door had been left open for a delivery, allowing a cold breeze to filter in through the room.
They shared another kiss, this time a little longer, before going their separate ways.
“It was the middle of the party when things went sour. Harry’s mood had shifted very suddenly. He’d gotten very sad. He’d tried to kiss Ginny I think or something. I think he just wanted some sense of normality and Ginny had always been that for him. Anyways, Ginny was dating Dean at the time and the kiss wasn’t welcomed. Ginny was in tears. Dean hit Harry. Ron hit Dean and then Harry. It was a bloody mess. I screamed at Harry for ruining my party, like some brat. And then we didn’t talk for like a month.”
He’d woken to an empty bed and the sound of rain coming down outside. It was dark and grey that morning. And that was exactly what Harry was feeling. Draco had left the day previously for the South of France where he would be spending the holidays with his mother, Narcissa. They wouldn’t be seeing each other for a week, not until New Year’s Eve, where they both agreed to meet at Pansy’s New Year’s Eve Party. Harry knew it was only a week, but the distance scared him nonetheless. Since getting together they hadn’t gone more than a day or so without seeing one another. Harry knew that they could Fire-Call one another and owl. But it wasn’t the same as Draco being beside him in the flesh. He was terrified of being by himself again. He knew there was a reason other than his meds that were keeping his emotions on a stable path. Draco made him feel stable.
“I thought I was the one who was supposed to be giving you a present. You're the birthday boy. Not me,” Harry teased as he pulled back and gazed down at Draco.
He’d been drawn to Draco since day one. His attraction had been immediate and had only gotten worse the more he’d gotten to know the blond. They’d met at Harry’s workplace. Draco had been there with Pansy attending one of the classes that the gym offered. Harry hadn’t asked Draco out right away, though. It had taken at least three times of “accidentally” running into each other before Harry had gotten up the nerve to ask him out. They both had claimed that they weren’t looking for anything serious. Harry had been just getting over his ex-boyfriend, Cedric, and Draco didn’t do relationships. But somewhere between getting drinks and casually hooking up, something had clicked. And here they were, two months into being boyfriends.
Harry jumped at the sudden voice behind him. He tore his eyes away from the dancing mass of people to a broad-shouldered man. “Hi,” said Harry flatly to the man he noticed was standing in a small room off to the side.
“DRACO!” Harry screamed out in frustration as he attempted to get to his feet, but it was too late. Draco was already out of the room and heading towards the Floo.
“I know! I just don’t think it’s healthy for you to be dealing with this alone. That’s all. I’m worried about you,” explained Hermione in a quiet voice. She knew she was walking on thin ice, but she wasn’t afraid of Harry’s mood swings anymore.
After leaving Grimmauld Place he had headed to the first place that had come to mind: Hermione’s and Ron’s quaint little cottage. He had grown close to the couple, especially Hermione, since getting back together with Harry. Hermione was the person that Draco went to first with any questions he had about Harry and his bipolar disorder.
But this time felt different.
Harry didn’t say anything to this. Instead, he turned his back to Draco and continued to search for his phone. Once finally locating it from just underneath the bed, he turned off the loud alarm.
Both his therapist and Hermione had told him he needed to. Not only for his own self-worth but for Draco’s sake as well. His therapist said he needed to be more open about what was going through his head with his loved ones and that included Draco. Draco would need to know how and why Harry was acting the way he was at times. By telling Draco about his bipolar, it would help them both in the long run. However, as much as this did make sense to Harry, he just couldn’t find the words or courage to really do so. As much as he understood having open communication and so forth, he just thought it would lead to Draco leaving him.
He would only limit himself to one tiny glass of wine. He didn’t want to appear rude to Malfoy by not sharing a drink with him. Plus, the wine would help calm the flutter of nerves in his stomach. He still couldn’t believe he had a date with Malfoy. Just the mere idea of it was so far out there.
He had missed the bloody bastard, not that he would admit it. He had not seen Harry in over two days, two long days. On the other hand, Draco knew that they had the remaining weekend to be alone together. This was something he was looking immediately forward to. Draco shot Harry an apologetic smile as Pansy pulled him away from the other man and began to dance a coordinated dance they’d made up years ago together.
“Welcome to The Funk Room,” cried a cheerful voice from behind.
Draco turned his head slightly to the side and pursed his lips. He was still pretending to be mad at his boyfriend but knew he wouldn’t be able to last much longer. Harry’s words and apologetic face were making him melt. “Well, you can start making it up to me by dancing to the rest of this song.”
Whatever it fucking was, Harry couldn't get enough of it.
“I’m not,” stated Harry stubbornly. He crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the kitchen counter. He’d been going to therapy for years now and, yes, it did help a little. But he felt like it wasn’t working for him anymore. He was tired of talking about past traumas. He didn’t think talking about the past constantly was doing him any good. He just wanted to move forward from everything and live his damn life. Why couldn’t Draco see that?
“You don’t look sick. But I haven’t heard from you in the last two days and then when you didn’t show up tonight...I thought the worst had happened. But here you are tucked up nicely in bed.”
Harry sat off in the far corner of the common room on one of his favourite swishy armchairs, nursing a butterbeer. Neville was seated in the chair adjourned to his. Like Harry, Neville instead sits on the outskirts observing everyone else make drunken fools of themselves than participate. Neville tried to make conversation with Harry; however, Harry wasn’t into it. It’s not that Harry didn’t like Neville or want to talk. He did. He considered Neville to be one of his good friends. It was just that he was distracted tonight.
“Harry please, talk to me. How are you feeling now? What level is your mood at?” Hermione continued to press. She didn’t care if Harry got angry at her. She would continue to ask until she got the answers to her questions.
normal.” He rubbed at the side of his face before running his hands through his hair. Forgetting that his glasses were perched there, he knocked them askew and flew across the room. Harry blushed embarrassedly as both he and Luna looked towards the glasses, where they lay in the middle of a row of desks, just a few feet away.
He was surprised to see Harry in a good mood. Today had been one of his therapy days and, usually, Harry came back feeling pretty crappy about himself. It must’ve been a good session, he thought. He was glad to see his boyfriend smiling and carefree for once. Not that Harry was constantly moody or anything. It just seemed to take a lot to make Harry happy some days.
Draco was silent for a second as he narrowed his eyes at Harry. He didn’t understand Harry’s intentions. All evening, the brunette had been withdrawn and quiet with him. He had thought at first that maybe Harry was just as nervous as he was to be going on a date. But as dinner had proceeded, the awkward silence had not shifted, it had seemed to have gotten worse. This man he’d just had dinner with was not the same bubbly Harry Potter he’d gotten to know over the last year of being friends.
Draco let out a soft series of moans and cries of approvals as Harry made his way down to his cock. Harry hadn’t meant to find himself on his knees so quickly, but here he was. His fingers hovered over the waistband of Draco’s briefs His green eyes looked up at Draco before moving any further. He only wanted to go as far as Draco wanted to. He didn’t want to push the blond towards rushing into something too quickly.
“Draco,” whispered Harry suddenly, not bothering to lift his head from Draco’s shoulder.
After drinking himself into intoxication, Harry stood on the rooftop terrace, alone. He was deep in thought, thinking about his life and everything that had lead up to his moment. He knew he’d been gay for a while, but he’d never spoken the words out loud, other than that time with Ginny. He had vowed never to repeat those words and take them to his grave. However, in his drunken state, Harry needed release.
Draco just stared at Harry for a second, debating if he should turn Harry down and say it was better off if they just remained friends who casually ran into each other every so often in public places. He did like Harry and despite the strangeness, the evening had been...it had not been terrible. Harry could’ve hexed him or something worse. But he hadn’t. He gave Harry a little smile, “I would like that.”
His heart was beating rapidly in anticipation of what Malfoy’s response would be. He would be lying if he said he hadn’t been thinking about inviting Malfoy in all night. He hadn’t obsessed over it, but it was something that he’d thought about since parting ways with the blond the previous day. It had been so long since he’d been with someone intimately. His bipolar usually affected his sex drive.
“I’m sorry. Did I wake you?” snarled Draco as he came into the darkened bedroom a moment later.
There was a moment of awkward silence as neither of them knew what to say or do next. Harry was pretty much waiting for Malfoy to run for the hills before he allowed the darkness to completely consume him for the rest of the night. He was barely holding himself together with the skin of his teeth. He knew he was in for a rough night and he didn’t want Malfoy to witness any of it.
Harry nervously laughed as he threw his hands up into the air and tried to copy Draco’s little dance from earlier. He knew he looked like an idiot, and usually, this would have discouraged him from going any further. But the way that Draco was looking at him just now with such hunger and devotion in his eyes made Harry want to dance forever. He tried to mimic Draco’s s- shape thing but failed miserably. His dance moves only consisted of the shuffling two-step and the shopping cart.
Harry had awoken in a terrible mood.
“Don’t apologize. You’ve done nothing wrong.”
He knew he shouldn’t let something like this, something out of his control, bother him, especially at his own party. But he couldn’t help but feel like the entire universe was against him tonight. He’d been looking forward to showing off his sexy, fit boyfriend to all his friends. It wasn’t that far into the party yet, though. He knew that when Harry did finally manage to show up, there would be plenty of time to introduce him to everyone and grind together on the dance floor, showing off to everyone how utterly disgustingly perfect they were together.
The blond hissed and rocked his hips forward, seeking Harry’s mouth. Harry repeated the action, gently teasing, touching, and stroking for a few moments longer. Draco let out a noise of approval.
He wasn’t though. The heavy dark monster continued to sit upon him, weighing him down.
He didn’t know how he would be able to face everybody after tonight. He didn’t know how he would be able to face himself either. He’d made a stupid drunken fucking mistake.
Draco nodded his head, “I understand, of course.”
Pansy had wanted to come back with them, something about an afterparty, but Harry had quickly shut that idea down. He knew he should allow his boyfriend to do what he wanted, and it was his birthday, after all. But Harry was acting selfishly, and he didn’t care. He wanted to have Draco all to himself. Luckily, Luna had stepped in and offered Pansy to stay over at hers for the night.
Nova was four months old and, like her name, she was a constant burst of brightness in their lives.
When the Muggle doctor he’d gone to see, referred to him by his Healer, diagnosed him with being Bipolar, Harry couldn’t help but feel like a weight had been lifted off of his shoulders. He finally had a name for it, a reason for why he acted and felt the way he did at times. It was all due to some chemical imbalance in his brain.
He knew that Draco would be home soon. The blond had just run out to the store to get some essentials and should be back any moment. However, knowing this did not settle Harry’s emotions. He didn’t want Draco to find him like this, helplessly laying on the kitchen floor while their daughter cried. It was not the scene he wanted his husband to come home to.
He’d even allowed Pansy to do his make-up. It was nothing over the top, just some contouring and eyeliner to enhance his natural features. He often liked to play around with make-up to make himself look more feminine and so on. He loved the endless possibilities that make-up could give him to change up his features and look. Playing around with different coloured eyeshadows and blush was fun; he didn’t understand why more people didn’t do it. To Draco, it was just another way to express himself.
“That good?” asked Draco as he wiped the sweat on his forehead with the back of his hand before leaning forward and pressing his chest to Harry’s.
There was a brief pause as both men continued to stare at one another before Draco was reaching out for Harry’s hand and pulling him close. “Dance with me.”
Draco just shook his head. “You aren’t even fighting me. You’re still in fucking bed.” The blond gestured towards the bed, where Harry still sat. He glared at the other man for a second longer before shaking his head in sad disbelief.
“If I did then you would’ve made an effort to come tonight. Or at least fucking replied to my owl. Did something come up? Was there an emergency with one of the Weasleys? Because that’s the only reason I can come up with other than that you are sick for not showing up.”
But no matter how hard he argued with himself and the little voice at the back of his mind who controlled his emotions, it didn’t work. The storm inside him was getting stronger and harder to fight off by the second.
“You came back,” whispered Harry as he opened his eyes and looked up at Draco, sleepily. “I thought you weren’t.”
“Snap out of it!” He cried loudly in the mirror. “SNAP THE FUCK OUT OF IT!” His voice cracked at the end. He knew it was no use. He knew what the outcome would be, no matter how hard he fought with his mind. The sadness crept in.
Harry’s eyes flashed towards Draco as he turned on the light. The other man's gaze was hard. His blond hair was effortlessly tousled. His bowtie was undone and hanging loosely from his neck. The first few buttons of his shirt were also undone, exposing Draco’s pale skin.
Harry let out a frustrated sigh as he struggled with the knot of his tie. His hands were shaking, making it impossible to loop the slippery, silky material up into a knot.
But none of this had scared Draco away, yet.
Draco didn't see Harry approach. He was too busy shaking his ass and leaning into Luna. The two were awkwardly twirling each other as they both sang at the top of their lungs. Draco knew he would regret all this singing later in the morning. His voice wasn't trained or accustomed really to singing so loudly. But that was a later problem. Right now, he was having too much fun to stop. He couldn't remember the last time he had a night out like this. It had been a while, he thought. He was going to enjoy it as much as he possibly could.
This was Harry’s first time being in the kitchen in four days. He’d been in bed the rest of the time.
It was the early hours of the morning when they made it back to Draco’s flat, alone.
Harry opened his mouth to say no, it wasn’t like the flu at all. He wanted to be honest with Draco and tell him all about this disorder and mental state, but that seemed rather heavy of a topic to bring up on a first date. He chewed on his bottom lip, before nodding his head. “...Yeah. Yeah. The flu. I just don’t feel up to much, you know?”
“I can’t bloody deal with you at the moment,” murmured Draco darkly.
“I guess so,” murmured Draco as he took a sip from his tea. He was silent for a while after that. This wasn't the evening he had envisioned for himself after the long day at the office.
“HARRY?!” he called out.
“Hey,” Draco greeted back.
Draco ran his hands through his hair before straightening his back and pushing his shoulders back. As he waited for Pansy to finish up, he unzipped the front pocket of the small, sleek black leather hip bag slung across his hips and pulled out his phone. The screen immediately lit up with a text as he tapped on it. He pursed his lips slightly as he read.
Draco was hesitant at first. Potter did know his love of chocolate and coffee and he did have a few minutes to spare before he had to be at work. “Alright!”
“I can do this anymore. I thought you felt the same way about me. But I was wrong. You hurt me tonight.”
Harry held Draco close, pressing a ghost of a kiss to the blond’s temple. Neither spoke a word, and they didn’t have to. A lazy morning comfort consumed them as they continued to lie there, listening to the adverts on the radio. It wasn’t until the familiar intro to the song began to play that Harry let out a howl of a laugh. He was immediately reminded of the previous night.
However, Draco was a different story. Draco liking him was still all new and fresh. They didn’t have years of friendship behind them. They had more years of hating and loathing each other’s guts than actual true friendship. Harry didn’t think Draco would judge him or anything, but you could never be quite sure how some would react until the moment came.
“I’ve missed you too.”
Harry’s shirt clung to his back and chest with sweat as he exited the Uber and stepped up to the club entrance. As soon as he could, he’d gotten off of the Tube and took an Uber, not wanting to be late any further.
"Excuse me, may I cut in?” spoke a voice suddenly on the back of his neck.
Guilt and shame twisted painfully in his stomach as he just sat there like a sack of potatoes listening to his daughter’s cries. He hated how useless he felt at this very moment. His brain argued with his body. An inner battle he was constantly having. He should be moving, he should be rising to his feet and going to his daughter’s aid. However, he stayed immobile. Like his body had suddenly been paralyzed.
“I’ll give you five minutes, Potter. I’m not waiting here all night for you,” instructed Draco as he pushed his way past Harry.
“Do you want to get lunch, Harry?” asked Draco as he finished off his coffee.
After an awkward stumbling conversation over the peaches, twenty minutes later Harry found himself seated across from Draco at the coffee shop where it had all begun. He couldn’t quite believe that he was here again with Draco after months of not seeing him. However, when the blond had asked if he wanted to get a coffee, Harry hadn’t hesitated.
Then there had been Ginny. He’d thought for sure this time what he was feeling for his best friend’s kid sister was real. And maybe for a little while, he’d liked her. They had always gotten along and had common interests with each other. Like everyone in the Weasley family, she was easy to be around. However, there was one moment that changed everything yet again for Harry. It had happened just a few days before Harry had gone off with Dumbledore to the cave. They’d been making out in an alcove, and Harry had let his mind wander a bit. One minute he was kissing Ginny, marvelling at how good she tasted, and then next, he was wondering if this was what it would be like to kiss Charlie. The immediate thought of the older Weasley made him have a  hard-on, something making out with either Cho or Ginny had ever caused.
But as much as Harry did his best to take care of himself and make sure he did everything properly, his little bubble of bliss soon came to a crashing halt.
The promise of a drink or spot of tea was long forgotten.
He hated himself even more than he already did.
“Oh. um. A flat white. No sweetener,” fumbled Harry nervously. He was suddenly finding it hard to string words together.
Draco didn’t wait another second as he crawled over to Harry and his open arms. The couple snuggled up against one another. Draco rested his head on Harry’s chest as he wrapped an arm around his waist. He closed his eyes briefly as he listened to the soothing rhythm of Harry’s heartbeat and inhaled his scent. A sense of comfort and warmth washed through him as he continued to lie in Harry’s strong arms.
This was the last thing he’d expected when Draco had told him he was throwing his birthday at a club.
“Please. Just leave me alone. I just want to sleep.”
“Please, don’t give up on me,” whispered Harry into Draco’s neck. There was a brief moment of silence and for a second the brunet thought that his boyfriend hadn’t heard him or thought maybe he was singing along to the song.
Harry spent the rest of the day cleaning and getting the house in top form for his date with Malfoy. His energy levels were good. They weren’t low or high. They were level for once. Normal, some would call it. Stable his doctors would say. It helped that he’d remembered to take his medication that morning. He didn’t usually take it. Some days he forgot, some he couldn’t be bothered to.
"You're in a good mood," observed Draco as he came into the kitchen after work one day.
“I think it’s actually perfectly normal to be gay.”
Time seemed to stand still for Harry. He didn’t know how long he had been dancing with Draco for? A minute? An hour? He wasn’t sure, and it didn’t matter. Draco didn’t seem to mind either.
He smiled, slipping a hand into Pansy’s smaller one before leaving the bathroom together.
So he made it his mission, you guess he could say to make himself like girls and find himself a girlfriend. That’s where Cho Chang had come in. He’d thought she was pretty and a good quidditch player.  And he really believed that he did fancy Cho at the time. However, Cho made him think of Cedric, which made all those unnatural feelings come back to the surface. It also didn’t help that he’d witness Cedric’s death.
“Comin’ up!” The queen turned her back, causing the sequins of her dress to reflect off of the disco ball, launching every shade of the rainbow against the surface of the bar and Harry.
“You,” answered Draco, the corners of his lips pulling upwards into a smile. “I want you, Harry.”
Draco let out a small chuckle as he looked over his shoulder and smirked at Harry. “Maybe.”
Harry just let out a humorless chuckle, forcing a smile on his face as he jumped down the last two steps of the staircase. He looked at Draco for a second before dropping his gaze and reached for a pair of black Converse trainers by the door and shoved them on his feet, quickly lacing them up.
“Please,” he whispered again. “Not now. Please not now.”
Twenty minutes later they met their daughter, Nova for the first time. She looked nothing like them with her caramel colour skin and wiry curly hair, but that didn’t matter to either of them. She was theirs no matter what she looked like.
After an injury on a job forced him to take an absence from work, Harry had fallen into a dark depression. One of the worst he’d ever experienced. He became utterly unresponsive and essentially immobile, staying in bed for almost two months. He’d felt utterly worthless and he hated it. He loathed himself and what he’d become. Everyone, even the Minster, thought it would be best if he retired from his short but promising career as an Auror.
Harry rubbed his face, letting out a sigh as he climbed the stairs to the bedroom once again. He knew he shouldn't go back to bed, but it was calling to him. Talking to Hermione hadn’t helped his mood one bit. He just wanted to forget everything and seek comfort amongst his bedding.
“Piss off, both of you!”  huffed Harry as he dried his hands on the back of his jeans and shoved his glasses back onto his face. He usually wore contacts when at work. It was easier to work out and train clients when he wasn’t constantly pushing his glasses up his nose as he sweated. He hated wearing contacts, though, in general, and instead wore his glasses whenever he could.
“Potter. Please do not tell me you forgot.”
Hermione frowned at hearing this. “What happened Harry?” she asked after a pause. “Where’s Draco?”  She didn’t want to push. But she figured that something had happened between them to put Harry in a state like this. It had been a while since she’d seen him in such a bad way.
“You’re such a bloody tease,” said Harry, watching as Draco threw his arms above his head and made a little s-shaped motion with his hips.
Draco turned slowly to face Harry. His face was a mask of stone at first before a small smile broke across his features. “Potter,” he said shortly. “I don’t know why after a year of being neighbours you still find it utterly amusing to run into one another.”
They stayed like this for a while, kissing and simply exploring each other’s bodies over their clothes before it all became too much. Neither wanted it to end, but they didn’t want to rush it either.
“Let’s go? ” asked Harry a moment later, standing up. He nervously shoved his hands into his pockets for a second, looking at Draco before moving towards the front door.
“Jeesh, Draco you make it seem like I had a choice or something,” spoke Hermione, laughing slightly as she sat down opposite Draco. They were seated outside on the small garden patio at the back of the cottage. The early summer sun was just beginning to set in the distance.
Classical music greeted him as he pushed open the heavy glass doors of the building and entered. A tall woman with ebony skin stood behind a desk a few feet away from the doors, slightly hidden away from the street view.
Harry turned his attention away from a poster of Donna Summers and onto the bartender.
“Why not?” asked Draco, calmly, even though his first reaction was to be pissed and irritated at Harry. He knew that getting mad wouldn’t get him anywhere. He needed to remain calm in the situation.
“Harry?” came a voice a second later. “What’s wrong?” Hermione appeared in front of the fire a moment later. Her face was full of concern as she sank to her knees, her lilac dressing gown falling open around her.
He didn’t know when Harry would wake or come out of his depression, but he hoped that it wouldn’t be too long. He needed him. Nova needed him.
“I see. And why are you telling me now?”
Harry awoke abruptly the next morning to the sound of an owl tapping at his bedroom window. A slow smile crept across his face as he immediately recognized the magnificent grey eagle owl. Only Draco Malfoy would have such a beautiful bird as a pet. Kicking off the covers, Harry went to the window and allowed the bird inside. The owl hooted loudly in greeting as it flew onto Harry's outstretched arm and offered him his leg.
The couple stayed like this, dancing as one for a few seconds longer. They were both too lost in each other to take in the rest of their surroundings. At that moment, it was just the two of them in the middle of the dance floor.
Swallowing over the lump in his throat, Harry gripped tightly onto the plastic handle of the basket, gathering all the courage within him to make his way over to Draco.
All his attention was on Draco Malfoy.
Harry didn’t need to be told twice as he climbed back onto the bed. He lunged at Draco, hands going to his hips while his mouth crashed against his. The kiss was wet and sloppy as Harry urgently parted Draco’s lips and slipped his tongue inside. Draco moaned into the kiss as the hard heat of Harry’s erection brushed against his own, sending a shiver of pleasure down his spine.
The other boys in the room with Harry were a Ravenclaw that Harry had never remembered seeing before until he first stepped into the dorm room. When he’d complained about this later to Hermione and Ron at the feast, it had been pointed out to him that he'd had a lot going on in the years previous, so it made sense that he would remember everybody from their school year. The other boy was a Hufflepuff that he did remember, Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Harry had tried to come out to Ginny the night before the funeral. She’d been hinting at getting back together and wouldn’t take no for an answer.
“Thanks,” whispered Harry as he looked back up at Malfoy, who was now seated across from him.
“Fuck. Yes. That feels
There was an awkward silence as Draco took in this information. Harry studied him for a second before focusing his attention anywhere else. He watched as a group of students came into the cafe. They were all rosy-cheeked and wore big smiles as they talked loudly about something. Harry watched as two boys shoved each other playfully back and forth before being told off by one of the girls in the group to knock it off. The interaction immediately made him think about how he and Ron had been during Hogwarts. He sometimes wished he could go back to those simpler days when all he had to worry about was exams and killing the Dark Lord. They hadn’t seemed simple at the time. But now in comparison to his constant battle with bipolar, they were like walks in the park.
Harry stared at his reflection in the mirror and sighed at what he saw. His hair was stuck up at all different ends, there were four days worth of stubble on his face. He looked like shit, he thought. He didn’t look like the person that deserved to go out with Draco Malfoy. He knew this was going to be a bad idea, but Draco was already fucking downstairs in his foyer, waiting for him. He couldn’t fucking bail now. He really did like Malfoy and wanted to make this work.
“Oh I do love peaches, don’t you?” Harry practically sang out as he began to exam a peach.
Draco didn’t say anything as his heart began to race and continued to take in the dragon’s details on the coin pendant. He was at a loss for words for once. The necklace was beautiful and better than anything else he’d received tonight for his birthday. He swallowed roughly over the sudden lump in his throat. There were a million things he wanted to say to Harry at this moment to convey what he was feeling. But words failed him. He didn’t know how to put his deep feelings towards the man beside him into words, and besides, The Funk House didn’t seem like the right setting to do so either. So instead, the blond smiled and bought a hand up to the side of Harry’s face.
“Hey,” whispered Draco. He removed his hand from Harry’s knee and brought it up to the side of his husband’s face. He cupped Harry’s chin, brushing away the tears with his thumb as they fell.
“I’ve been good. Better now though,” replied Malfoy with a slight smirk and a playful wink.
But the lightweight feeling quickly went away when the doctor went on to explain that there was no real cure for Bipolar Disorder. That they could treat it with pills and therapy and such, but it would always be something he would ultimately have and struggle with for the rest of his life.
He hadn’t gone on another date with Malfoy. But the blond had owled Harry as promised. They had written a few times over the last couple of weeks. But they were just friendly letters. They’d yet to make plans to meet up again. Harry was fine with that. He was feeling better, but he was scared that something would happen that’d force him to push Malfoy away again. No, it was for the best, he thought. It was for the best if they just remained friendly with each other.
Draco sighed with pleasure at this. He thrust harder into Harry in response. “Fuck. You’re so tight.”
“I have to tell you something,” blurted out Harry suddenly. His voice rose slightly as he sat up straight in his chair like someone had zapped him suddenly with a taser gun, shooting an electric current through him.
“Fuck. You look so good like this,” Harry murmured back as he continued to thrust into Draco.
You could say that Harry had always had a little thing for Draco. An obsession of sorts. One that he had masked over the years with pretending to loathe him. They said there was a fine line between love and hate, which was very valid for Harry and Draco.
“You haven’t told anyone? Not even your close friends?” asked Hermione, generally surprised by this.
Draco gave Harry an intense look; a devilish smile spread across his features as he slid himself up against Harry and rolled his hips to the music. His fingers barely touched Harry as they came to rest on his sides briefly before moving away.
But he didn’t move. He couldn’t move. The heaviness was still there, sitting upon him like a bag of rocks. He blew out a deep breath, twisting the bedsheet which covered him tightly in his hands. He was frustrated with himself. He hated how useless he was. He wanted to get up and function like a normal human but his body wouldn’t work.
Harry couldn’t help but touch his shoulder and briefly looked over at Malfoy, watching as he made his way to the counter to order. His eyes lingered on his backside for a second longer, taking in the small roundness of his ass cheeks in those black skinny jeans he was wearing. He swallowed over the lump that had suddenly developed in his throat and took a seat. He drummed his fingers anxiously against the surface of the table as he waited for Malfoy to return.
Harry, of course, knew the bare minimum of sex and what it entailed. But he wasn’t interested in girls. He wanted to know what sex was like between two men. Of course, he didn’t do anything about finding out, though, despite how curious he was. Harry couldn’t very much look it up in the school's library.
“To whatever it is that is going on in your head this evening that’s more interesting than this.” Draco waved his hand vaguely in front of him. “You shouldn’t feel obligated, Potter. The date was a dud.” He sighed as he ran his hands through his hair, tucking it behind his ears before dropping his arms dramatically to his sides.
He had tried to juggle his demanding career as an Auror while he was also struggling with his mental state. But within four years he had burned himself out.
“Like this,” said Draco into Harry’s ear as he spun him around so that they were now front to back. Harry swallowed over the sudden lump in his throat as he felt Draco’s hands on his hips as he pressed his pelvis into his backside. His heart was beating rapidly as a flutter of emotions came over him. He didn’t know how he had gotten so lucky to call Draco his own. It took all of Harry’s willpower not to melt into a puddle of mush underneath Draco’s touch.
Harry made a little strained noise at this before lifting his head and pulling away from Luna’s grasp. This time she let him go. “How do you know...about...about me being gay. Did Ginny tell you?”
Harry then made his way into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. As he did so, he noticed a familiar owl perched on the open window sill. He couldn’t help but smile a little as he took the letter and began to read it.
The note was simple and brief but held so much promise.
“Oh, nothing. It’s just a wonderful day. Don’t you think? A wonderful day for peaches!” beamed Harry with a bright smile.
Draco just stared at Harry’s back for a long second. That was not at all the answer he’d been expecting to come out of Harry’s mouth just now. Since they’d gotten back together Harry had always gone to therapy. Every Tuesday and Thursday. There was a calendar on the nearby wall with Harry’s schedule along with when he was to take his medication. To Draco’s knowledge, therapy was good for Harry. It helped in his recovery and stabilized his moods. Not going was like a red flag of sorts, a warning sign. Or so he’d read about in the numerous books on mental illnesses he could get his hands on at the nearby library, and what he’d learned from others who had bipolar partners and loved ones. He’d been attending a support group for loved ones of bipolar patients.
It was then that his eyes shifted over to the clock on the nightstand. He squinted his eyes and read out the tiny numbers on the clock. It was just past 2 in the morning.
Draco moved his head slightly towards Harry’s and made a small noise of recognition.
Harry’s bright face faded into a frown, forehead creased and eyebrows drew close together as he looked out the kitchen window and saw the rain pour down. And then just like that, his mood sank.
Love wasn’t in the cards for him. He was used to being alone. Half of his life had been spent doing just that. It was fine. He, Harry Potter, would forever just be a hermit. It was fine.
“Shall we go back?” she asked, holding out her hand for Harry to take.
Harry buried his face in his hands as his stomach twisted with anxiety. He heard the click of Draco’s shoes on the worn wooden floorboards before he saw him. He didn’t dare to look at his husband at first. He didn’t want to see what was written across his face.
The whole idea of the thing made him anxious. He wasn’t afraid to be in a room full of Slytherins. He was past all those old house rivalries. He was more anxious about being at a party and being the only sober guest. He still avoided parties when he could with his own mates. Harry quite liked the taste of alcohol. At one point, it had helped calm his nerves. But he knew drinking with the amount of medication he was on wouldn’t be a good combination. Draco had reassured him after he’d brought this concern up, that no one would care if he drank or not. But the thought still made him anxious.
“Draco?” murmured Harry, his voice filled with sleep.
The conversation continued to flow between the two men after this. The anxiety in Harry’s stomach soon faded away to a dull thump as he found himself once again. It felt good to be not only outside of the house but to be having a conversation with someone who wasn’t Hermione and Ron or his therapist or doctor. It was a relief, talking to Malfoy about everything and nothing at all. He liked how Malfoy talked so he didn’t have to. He liked how Malfoy didn’t push him to talk about himself or his feelings or what his mood was at that moment. With Malfoy, it was like talking to a friend.
“I am the birthday boy,” replied Draco with a smirk. His eyes were bright with arousal as his hands roamed up and down Harry’s hips and backside, dipping lower and lower. “But that doesn’t mean I can’t spoil my fuckin’ gorgeous boyfriend as well.” The blond cocked an eyebrow before leaning forward and bringing Harry’s mouth back onto his.  He kissed Harry softly before beginning to attack the side of his neck. His hands slid down to the other man’s toned ass cheeks and squeezed them, kneading eagerly at the flesh there. Harry’s body immediately responded by rolling into Draco, making their cocks once again rub up against each other.
“Of course not. Why would I? It's not my secret to tell,” replied Draco.
Harry smiled back and started to head towards the table.
An awkward silence fell over them. Harry swallowed hard over the lump in his throat. He didn’t quite know what to say to Draco. He wanted to open up to the blond and tell him everything. But the words wouldn’t come to him.
Harry felt a little silly at first as they began to sway back and forth along to the music. He couldn’t help but be reminded of the Yule Ball from all those years ago and how awkward and out of place he’d felt dancing in front of his peers. However, there was no one to make fun of him now in his living room as he danced with Draco.
Draco immediately responded to Harry’s touch as he threw his arms around Harry’s neck and returned the kiss happily. They stayed like this for a moment as their mouths pressed and moved hungrily against each other. Harry slid his hands down the side of Draco’s face to his hips, holding him firmly in place against the wall. Draco ran his hands through Harry’s curls before cupping the sides of his face and pulling his mouth closer against his. His tongue parted Harry’s lips and began to explore.
good,” Draco panted as he moved and wiggled his hips back and forth against Harry’s hands.
Time seemed to stand still as Harry sank deeper into his depression.
“Yeah. No,” replied Draco with a shake of his head, his hair falling slightly into his eyes as he did so. “I- I should just leave you to it, Potter.”
Harry nervously drummed his fingers against the kitchen island, glancing towards the clock on the wall before deciding to pour his tiny glass of wine now. He wouldn’t even drink it, he thought. Just holding the slender glass in his hands was comfortable enough for him. He took a slow inhale of the wine before moving into the living room. He had another hour to kill before Malfoy was due to arrive.
Harry went to bed feeling a little bit hopeful for the future, something he hadn’t felt in a while.
“What’s wrong? Am I hurting you?”
He didn’t enter Harry right away at first. He just pushed the tip of his cock into Harry, hovering there for a second before Harry’s hips thrust forward, encouraging him to go further.
Harry pulled back and held Draco’s face in his hands for a second. The two men stared intensely at each other.
“Yes, frankly I am,” spoke Hermione honestly. She’d thought for sure that Draco would go running off and telling his friends about Harry’s mental state. The Malfoy she knew from school would’ve been running to the Prophet with the news on how The Chosen One was a mental case.
The room was dark as they stepped inside. No one bothered to turn on a light as they once again faced one another. Draco brought Harry’s hand up to his lips and kissed it softly in a moment of tenderness before dropping it. The blond then once again pulled Harry’s face close to his and kissed him. The kiss was softer and slower than the one shared previously.
“Cancer?” asked Draco, his eyes suddenly going wide in fear.
“It’s okay, Harry,” spoke Luna softly as she crossed her legs and sat down in front of Harry. She reached out and took his right hand and squeezed it.
Draco moved his hips from side to side, gently teasing Harry as he did so. His hand slid upwards and began to play with the curls on the back of Harry’s neck.  Harry’s eyes immediately closed for a second before opening and locking with him again.
Draco smirked in delight at hearing this. He loved the power he had over his boyfriend just by simply choosing to wear a more flimsy piece of underwear. He'd had partners in the past who hadn’t been as approving of his underwear choice or simply didn’t care as Harry did.
“I’m sorry. I can't. I wish I could...but I have to be alone.”
“It’s a gift.”
It was childish of him to be like this with his medication. He knew he should take it every single morning. It was there to help him. However, Harry hated the idea of relying on pills to make him functional. Hermione always scolded him like a child when she found out he wasn’t taking his medication properly. He knew she counted his pills when she came over. Harry knew the medication made him feel better about himself and helped curve his depression and so forth. But he was still as stubborn as he was back at Hogwarts. Maybe even more.
Energy raced through Harry’s veins as he watched the owl fly away through bleary eyes. He didn’t know if he could wait another day to see Malfoy. He wanted to make up for his behavior last night as a shitty date and wouldn’t know what his mood would be tomorrow. It was like he was Cinderella and Malfoy was the prince, he only had so much time at the ball before he turned back into a pumpkin. Or however, the story went. The point was that Harry felt good now. His mind was clear and he felt like his old self, his true self. And he wanted Draco to see this side of him. Tomorrow, he could be a whole other Harry.
Harry couldn’t help but roll his eyes at this remark before snaking an arm around the blond’s waist and pulling him closer to him.  He then buried his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, inhaling his scent before pressing a kiss to the skin. “You are mine,” murmured Harry into Draco’s ear.
“Thank you!” sighed Draco dramatically from his side of the bed. The mattress squeaked and shifted as the blond turned onto his side and placed a pillow over his head.
Draco just stared at Harry blankly for a second before letting out a dry laugh. “That’s all you got to say. I know you are a man of very few words, Harry, but come on! You’ll have to fucking do better than that. You humiliated me tonight in front of all my friends. No, you hurt me. I’ve been looking forward to tonight for weeks. Tonight meant the world to me, Harry. I was finally getting to be with all the people that I care for the most in the world under one roof. But you betrayed me. At first, I thought something had happened when you didn’t show up like we agreed to. I even owled you, but you didn’t respond. I was worried, then pissed off.”
Harry didn’t allow any time to pass after Draco had closed the flat door before he was pushing him up against the wall and kissing him. His gym bag dropped with a thud to the floor as he did so. He couldn’t take the wait any longer. He’d been hard since first seeing Draco dancing away on the dance floor.
Harry couldn’t help but smile a little at the blond’s offers. It was a nice thought. But no amount of tea or soup would fix him. “Thanks for the offer, but I don’t want to get you sick either. I think I just need to sleep it off, you know?”
Harry didn’t recognize the song that was currently playing. But that’s not what had caught his attention in the first place. It was Draco. Draco hadn’t noticed Harry yet. The blond appeared to be lost in his own little world as he danced along with the song.
A silent tear rolled down his cheek, but he didn't brush it away. Instead, he squeezed his eyes shut and tried to calm his breathing. Inhaling deeply and counting to ten before exhaling, as his therapist had taught him years ago to do when he felt overwhelmed with anxiety. He tried to reach that sweet zen spot that he knew was buried deep down inside of him, somewhere. However, it was no use.
Instead, Harry turned onto his side and curled up around his daughter. He lay there, watching the soft rise and fall of her chest.
“HARRY?” Draco called. There was a slight echo to his voice as Harry heard his name being called out from the other room as well as on the monitor.
Harry smirked. The pads of his fingers gently teased an inch of flesh above the waistband as he lowered his head and nuzzled at Draco’s front.
“You are beautiful, Harry. Any boy would be lucky to have you.” Luna then leaned forward and touched the side of Harry’s face, cradling it gently.
“Why aren’t you more disgusted? Why are you treating me so nicely?” pressed on Harry in annoyance. He didn't deserve Luna's kindness, he thought. She should be disgust and appalled by him as Ginny had been. Like how everyone will be after they found out the truth.
As soon as the tip of Draco’s tongue touched Harry’s ass, he felt like he’d been electrified. His cock was fully erect and bobbed heavily against his stomach. He once again found himself resisting the urge to touch himself. He didn’t want to rush it. He didn’t want to cum until Draco was inside of him, filling him up.
Luna continued to look at him for a second longer before her face broke out into a bright grin as a sudden brilliant idea struck her.
Harry let out a sad bark of a laugh at this. “I don’t know. I’ve never
Harry once again rushed to the window at hearing the familiar tapping on the glass. His heart was racing anticipation of what Draco’s response would be. He rarely dated nowadays and when he did, it didn’t last much past the first date.
He needed to kiss Draco this very instant.
,” Malfoy called out playfully as he placed a cup and saucer down in front of Harry.  Harry looked up briefly at Malfoy before looking down at the filled cup of coffee in front of him. There was a heart drawn on top of the foamed surface.
Harry’s mood hadn’t improved much once he arrived at the grocery store. In fact, it was probably worse. Not only was he still in a foul mood, but now he was also cold to the bone. He shivered as he stomped the snow off of his boots on the front mat of the store before reaching for a shopping basket.
The room soon filled with the filthy sounds of their sweat-coated bodies moving rapidly against one another in a slapping rhythm.
“Wait Malfoy!” said Harry reaching out and placing a firm hand on Draco’s forearm.
The blond wore a fitted navy blue muggle suit, blazer, and all. He wore a white button-up shirt underneath. It was barely done up, though, showing off a pale strip of the chest. Draco looked like he’d just walked off the photoshoot or something. He looked sexy as hell, and it was making Harry’s mouth water. Harry shifted a little in his seat as he felt himself get a semi-hard on. He immediately placed his now empty butterbeer bottle onto his lap, covering himself. He knew that no one could probably notice, but it still sent a wave of embarrassment and shame through him. He shouldn’t be getting hard over any man, let alone Draco. He felt his cheeks flush, but he hoped that Neville didn’t notice as he tore his eyes away from the blond and over at him, instead.
He had been a few years ago, but he was trying to stay sober, now. After a handful of embarrassing experiences with being drunk out of his mind, he was trying to cut back.
He was supposed to be out of bed by now and getting ready for the party. However, his body wouldn’t move. The heavyweight in his chest that had arrived a couple of days ago had spread to every inch of his body. From head to toe, it felt like he’d been pumped full of lead. Every required movement was heavy and slow. He’d been lying in bed for the last two days. He’d thought he would be better by now.
“What? Oh yeah.” Harry had forgotten about his gym bag. He felt stupid about bringing it with him. He should’ve left it back in the gym. He opened the bag’s side pocket and took out his wallet and a small silver-wrapped gift box before handing over the bag to the cloakroom clerk.
The blond pouted, his bottom lip jutting out, and gently leaned forward to retouch them when Pansy came barging into the bathroom.
A long stretch of silence fell over them. The only sounds coming from the baby whose cries had settled down to a soft whimpering noise.
Just like everything else, Harry was coming to terms with his attraction to the posh blond grit as much as he’d loathed him in their youth. All that was gone now and left with a raw appeal.  Harry, who was still discovering himself and figuring out what he liked in terms of men, wasn’t sure what it was actually about Draco that he was drawn to. Was it his blond hair which he now wore loose, no longer slicked back with gel to his scalp? Was it his tall narrow frame and legs for days? Was it his stormy grey eyes and pale skin?  Harry wasn’t sure. At the moment, Harry seemed to be attracted to all sorts and types of men. He wasn’t sure if he had a real type, considering his fantasies at the moment were the complete opposite of Draco Malfoy. Harry, however, did know one little thing, that he liked hot men. And Draco was the utter definition of hot.
The bedroom was dark and damp smelling as he threw himself onto the bed. He immediately reached for the bottle of pills on the nightstand. He tapped out two pills onto the palm of his left hand and swallowed them dryly. The pills made him feel numb and groggy, he usually resisted taking his medicine, but today he welcomed the numbness that they brought. He just wanted to drift off into a dreamless slumber.
It was the next night and as promised they had gone out for dinner. It’d been a wonderful date. Harry had been fully present for it this time, not like last time. He’d made sure to take his mood stabilizers and get a proper night’s rest. He usually found if he didn’t get a full eight hours of sleep that his moods were impacted greatly.
“You gave us quite a scare there mate!” commented Ron as he came to kneel beside Hermione.
Draco cleared his throat slightly as he pushed back his shoulders and tried not to let himself combust underneath Harry’s gaze. “You can always spoil me! Remember that! Birthday or not,” he said, winking playfully at Harry.
Scratching his face, Harry stripped out of his clothes and quickly redressed in something that hadn’t been slept in for the past four days. He settled on a black t-shirt that smelled clean and a pair of black jeans that he knew fitted him well. He knew it was nothing special and probably way too casual for Malfoy’s standards, but it was the best that was going to happen.
Of course, there had been times when Draco had threatened to leave Harry. But they were just empty threats now. He would never leave Harry, no matter how hard it got at times. He loved the man and would be with him as long as Harry wanted him.
“Why would I be disgusted?” asked Luna softly. She titled her head to the side and locked eyes with Harry.
A slight smirk spread across Draco’s face a second later. “Good. Because I am far too young to be wrinkling.”
Harry sang to himself as he returned home and moved around the kitchen putting his purchases away. He couldn’t help but plant a kiss on each of the peaches as he put them into the fruit bowl carefully, making sure not to bruise each one of their perfect fuzzy skin. He was in a chipper mood. Getting coffee with Malfoy had gone well and he’d even managed to talk the blond into getting dinner together Saturday night.
“Good.”
“I like,” whispered Harry in a hoarse voice, gesturing to Draco’s lower region.
“It’s okay, Harry,” Luna whispered again after a second. She scooted herself closer to Harry so that they were now pressed side to side, shoulder to hip. She only let go of his hand for a brief second before taking it once again into her own. She rested their intertwined hands on her knee while the fingers of her other hand traced circles along Harry’s knuckles and wrist. “I know it’s hard. But people will come around. There were tons of gay people in the world. It’s not a big deal.”
Harry groaned before rolling onto his side and closing his eyes, summoned once again to the darkness. The last thought he had before falling asleep was how Draco was going to be pissed at him for missing the party.
“I just hate how he gets these stupid ideas into his head at times. He didn't go to therapy today because he figured that he is feeling good enough not to go. And there was mention of going off his meds just because someone in group therapy did. He’s a fucking idiot.” Draco hadn’t come here to rant. Okay, maybe he had a little. But he was just so fucking frustrated by everything currently. He tried to calm his breathing and looked out at something on the grass. He worried his bottom lip between his teeth and thought about Harry not being on meds for a second. He didn’t know what that would look like, but he knew it wouldn’t be good.
Draco pushed open the door to find Harry curled up in the centre of the bed, hugging a pillow. He appeared to be asleep, but Draco wasn’t quite sure.
“Yeah. So you see, I’m not some saint. I get frustrated with Harry too,” said Hermione as she finished off her tea and abruptly pushed back her chair. “Do you want cake? I feel like cake!”
An overwhelming feeling of guilt rippled through Harry as he noticed Hermione was barefoot and her hair was pulled back underneath a satin head scarf. She’d been sleeping, he realized. He bit down hard on his bottom lip as a fresh set of tears filled his eyes. He abruptly looked away from Hermione and her bare feet. It hurt too much to look at her. It hurt too much to think about waking her from her peaceful slumber just because he couldn’t fucking control his emotions.
The address was correct. Harry looked up from his phone and once again studied the exterior of the building. It still didn’t look right; he thought as he chewed on his bottom lip.
They continued to smile at each other for a second longer before Draco turned his attention to the gift. He unwrapped the gift carefully, taking his time not to rush like he’d been taught not to.
“I dunno,” said Harry with a slight shrug of his shoulders. “I guess I’m just still not over the fact that you, Draco Malfoy are not only living in the muggle world but do your own grocery shopping too.” Harry’s voice was part teasing and part truth.
“Fuck me,” demanded Draco through clenched teeth.
In the end, no matter who it was Harry was dating, he knew his friends only wanted him to be happy. They were constantly nagging at him to put himself out there and go on dates and such. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t want to find himself a partner. Amongest everything, it was what he wanted most in the world. But, he wasn’t delusional. He knew he was hard to deal with on a good day, let alone on his lowest of lows. He didn’t know who would want to put up with him and his constant mood swings and fragile mental health.
However, Harry paid no attention to the smell, he barely registered it as he came into the kitchen to get a glass of water. For someone, who had been so ecstatic when first laying eyes on the freshly in-season peaches, could give a rat’s ass now about them. Harry hadn’t thought about the peaches or anything really since he’d dumped them into the bowl, sitting squarely in the centre of the island, mocking him.
Draco and his friends had been coming to The Funk House for a couple of years now. They went to the hidden club when they needed to escape from their busy modern lives and step back into what some would say was a simpler time. It had been the first place to come to mind when Draco had decided he wanted to spend his birthday dancing up a sweat. He thought it would be a fun venue for everyone, even Harry, who didn’t like to dance. But who could say no to disco music?
He sighed in disappointment, texting back a reply.
Harry didn’t say anything as he fidgeted with his glasses. A million thoughts were racing through his head as he continued to look at his boyfriend. He wanted to apologize to Draco. Tell him that he was an idiot and had meant to come. However, no words came out of his mouth. Even though his brain was screaming at him to talk, to say anything. Just like his ability to move, he’d lost his ability to talk too it seemed.
“Come on, come on, come on, come on,” he whispered urgently to himself. He could hear  Malfoy calling out his name from the other room. “Fucking come on.”
Draco was in no immediate rush. Despite being exhausted and drunk, the blond wanted to savour this moment as long as possible with his boyfriend. Something in their relationship had shifted tonight. Neither knew what it was nor could put their finger on it. There was just an overall feeling.
But as Harry stood there frozen to the spot, Draco turned and caught his eye.
He kissed him tenderly, putting all his emotions into it.
He quickly went into the bathroom and brushed his teeth poorly. He reached for his wand and debated about doing a shaving spell, but he had never quite mastered grooming charms well and didn’t want to make a bodged attempt now. It would have to do, he thought.
“You’re the gorgeous one,” Harry whispered back. He didn’t mean to argue back, but old habits die hard. He wasn’t used to thinking of himself as gorgeous or breathtaking or beautiful as Draco often liked to say. He knew this little bad habit of putting himself down irritated Draco to no end, but he couldn’t help himself. He just didn’t see it. Sure he was fit and had an okay-looking face, he supposed, but if anyone was the gorgeous one, it was Draco by a landslide. He was tall and thin with a perfect round bubble butt, smokey grey eyes, and silky blond hair.
“Yeah?” asked Draco as he propped himself up onto his elbow and gazed into Harry’s face.
Harry continued to work Draco open with his tongue and fingers for a couple of moments longer before finally taking him from behind. He placed a series of feather-like kisses on the blond’s shoulders and back before getting off the bed briefly to get the jar of lube kept on the bedside table. He brought the pot with him as he came back onto the bed and slid up beside Draco once again.
There was a loud crashing noise as Harry blindly reached out for his phone on the bedside table but ended up knocking over his glasses and a book onto the floor in the process.
Harry continued to watch Draco as he twirled and threw his hands up in the air. He sang out loud to each one of his friends, pretending to be the lead singer. Harry was torn between going over there and joining in on the fun and holding back and continuing to watch this carefree side of Draco from the sidelines.
normal," argued Harry.
“Like the flu?”
Draco’s eyes flashed with annoyance as Harry continued to stare at him like a fish out of water before rolling his eyes with a smirk and pulling Harry to him. He grasped the back of Harry’s head, fingering the curls there before pulling his mouth to his. The kiss was soft and tender, deepening as their tongues met.
Harry had returned home from a long day at the Ministry. It was the middle of the long stretch of trials for the convicted death eaters. He had felt numb and raw after hearing the long list of charges, which ultimately made him relive the battle at Hogwarts. He had come home and wanted to forget everything. He’d gone straight over to the makeshift bar, which was just an old bar cart. He’d grabbed a bottle of Firewhiskey, not bothering with a glass as he drank straight from the bottle. Usually, when he was feeling this down, he would firecall Hermione and Ron. They knew what he was going through. However, the couple at the moment was in Australia, trying to hunt down Hermione’s parents. As he drank, he thought about going to the Burrow. The Weasley's, despite their grief, would welcome him with open arms. However, he hadn’t been back there since Fred’s funeral. And he didn’t know when or if he could ever go back. It was hard enough being around the family as they grieve a son, a brother, a twin. Seeing them like that made Harry blame himself for what happened with Fred. No, he couldn’t face that guilt tonight. Or ever.  And then there was also what had happened with Ginny.
Harry had his eyes shut, his teeth grazing his bottom lip. Draco watched as the lights flashed across Harry’s face. He couldn’t help but marvel at how lucky he was to have this beautiful man to call his own.
The blond smiled softly at Harry. “Hey,” he whispered. “There you are.”
He eventually got up, though.
Ever since that night, Harry kept on thinking about telling Draco.
There was a brief pause as Draco positioned himself at Harry’s hole. His grey eyes flickering to Harry’s face for reassurance.  Harry locked eyes with Draco and nodded his head firmly.
“I’ll owl you. Feel better Potter.” Malfoy gave Harry a small smile before disappearing into the fireplace. There was a bright flash of green light just after Malfoy called out his address.
Tears immediately filled Harry’s eyes as a painful reminder of Draco suddenly flashed through his mind. “I didn’t mean to,” he lied weakly as he rolled onto his back and threw arms over his face even though there was no light coming through. He bit down hard on his lip as he tried to gain control of the emotions suddenly coursing through him. The emotions he had successfully turned off a few days ago.
As he eventually made his way to the produce section of the grocery store, the contents of his basket contained: a jumbo bag of salt and vinegar crisps, a bright pink jug of laundry detergent, birthday candles, and a six-pack of bottled Pepsi.
Harry tenderly returned the kiss as he brought a hand up and covered  Draco’s. Mouths opened and closed against one another as they slowly began to move towards the bed. The kiss was only broken for a second as Harry pushed Draco down onto the bed before straddling his hips.
Harry slumped to the floor. Tears burned his eyes as he finally let go and stopped fighting with the darkness brewing inside of him. He buried his face into his knees as loud sobs shook his body.
“Darling,” spoke Pansy softly as she turned to face Draco. She took a step towards him, the heels of her stilettos making a clicking sound against the marble flooring as she did so. She held out the lipgloss to him before reaching up with her free hand and cradling the side of his smooth-shaven face.  Draco’s eyes locked with Pansy’s for a second. The corners of her lips turned up into a tender smile. “Don’t frown. It’ll give you wrinkles.”
After interviewing with a couple of adoption agencies, they’d decided on a private one that paired both wizarding and muggle families together. They knew that adoption wouldn’t be the easiest route, due to them being a same-sex couple and everything, but they remained confident in their decision. It took them almost two years before anything happened.
“It’s your birthday.”
Harry didn’t say anything as he studied the worried expressions on his friends’ faces.
“Owl me?” asked Harry, looking up hopefully at Draco. He hoped that his foul mood hadn’t royally fucked up his chances for another date with the blond. He did want to make it work out for once. He was so fucking tired of feeling lonely. He wanted a love like everyone else seemed to have. He wanted a partner to weather the storm he was constantly battling with.
“Hey, look at me. You’ve done nothing wrong.”
Tears ran down his cheeks and into his neck, but he didn’t take any notice.
Tonight, Harry would be responsible though.
They exchanged awkward small talk, as best as one could do in a crowded club while dancing poorly with each other. Luna was not a bad dancer and didn’t care if she looked terrible. It was more Harry who was struggling to keep up with her. He was hopeless without Draco to lead him. At this thought, his eyes drifted away from Luna and her wild moves, over to Draco. He was a few feet away from Harry now; few people were separating them.
“Harry?”
“Shake that ass for me, Potter!”
Harry awoke with a start.
“What?” asked Harry in confusion. It couldn’t just be over. He should at least be allowed to explain himself first, he thought. Draco wasn’t even giving him a chance.
Draco pushed Harry down onto his back before straddling his hips. He smiled wickedly at him before going down between his open legs and returning the favour. Harry couldn’t help but moan with pleasure as the sweet hotness of Draco’s breath against the cool air was exhilarating.
“Yes,” he whispered.
The blond let out a moan of pleasure before pressing an open-mouthed kiss to the side of Harry’s neck. “I wish I could’ve been there to see it,” replied Draco as his hands slipped underneath Harry’s t-shirt, seeking out the warm flesh underneath.
There were gasps and a few wolf cries from their classmates as they witnessed this exchange.
“Happy Birthday, Baby,” whispered Harry as he pulled away breathlessly from Draco, reaching into his back pocket as he did so to retrieve the now slightly flattened gift.
It was then that Harry squeezed his eyes shut and held back a sob as he inwardly pleaded with Draco not to give up on him. They had only been together for two months now. However, it had been the best two months of Harry’s life, if he was honest. And he was scared shitless that he was going to fuck it all up soon. He had yet to have any sort of episode. His moods over the last months had been pretty stable and he was afraid every day that he would relapse again or worse push Draco away.
“That was…”
“Wow.”
“Hush now,” spoke Draco. He hated when Harry put himself down like this. He gave Harry another kiss on the temple before rising to his feet. “I’m going to get her back to sleep and then I’ll come back, ok.”
Their classmates had also stopped dancing at this point too, as all attention was drawn to the two boys in the middle of the dance floor.
Harry knew he should get back on the horse as they said and start living his life. He knew that being bipolar wasn’t a curse and he shouldn’t let it define him. But at times it did feel like that, a curse. He wasn’t in control of his emotions at times and he hated that unknown feeling. He never knew when he would completely lose it.
“Malfoy. I am sorry. I really am sick. I’m not just some shit date that bails last minute like this, especially when I made such a fucking deal about it having to be tonight.”
They continued to take their time exploring with tongues and hands before it became too much and the need for more took over. Clothes were then quickly discarded and left on the floor.
“Malfoy? What do you want?” asked Harry groggily, glancing at the other man.
He didn’t have to look at the clock to know that he was going to be late for the party. The party was such a big deal for Draco. The party that was supposed to change everything. Even though they’d been together for a few months now, they hadn’t met each other’s friends just yet.
Ginny had wanted to get back together after the war. Everyone had thought they would too. But Harry has much as he wished and hoped he could, he couldn’t. He was a mess after the war and didn’t want to continue to live a lie. He was tired of putting others first and doing what was expected of him. As much as it terrified him, he wanted to be free and his true self for once.
He knew he should send an owl to Draco, telling him he was going to be late. But that required energy and strength he did not have. He hated how fucking useless he was at times like this. That he couldn’t even do the simplest thing of writing a letter to his boyfriend.
As Harry anxiously waited for Draco’s reply, he hopped into the shower, not quite remembering the last time he’d taken one.
“You promise?”
With this thought, Harry, in one fluid motion, pushed the small thin piece of clothing that still remained down the other man’s thighs. The blond let out a hiss of a moan as his erection was released from its confinements and bobbed, brushing against Harry’s.
Harry had had low periods in his life before, but nothing quite like this.
Harry poked his head through the green flames and appeared into the cozy sitting room of his friend’s cottage. The room was dark, except for a lone light which had either been left on accidentally or on purpose on the end table. Harry blinked and focused on the light for a second before sweeping his eyes around the empty room.
“Or showered?” added Ron.
As Harry’s cock hardened, he began to move his hips, thrusting in and out of Draco’s hungry mouth. Draco responded to this by locking his lips around Harry’s shaft and sucking harder. Harry lifted his hips and pushed his cock further up into Draco’s throat with each thrust, giving the blond as much of his swollen cock as he could handle.
And like on most Friday night’s there was a party going on in the 8th Year common room. Since most of them were over eighteen, the Headmistress let some things slide for the older students and turn the other way, pretending not to notice what was going on behind the closed doors of the 8th year dormitory, e.g. parties and drinking.  The 8th year already had 24 hour access to the castle and Hogsmeade. No curfew was set in place for the older students. The Headmistress thought they’d already been through enough in the last few years of their young lives and had earned the right to be treated like adults. And with being an adult came with the benefit of freedom and certain liberties.
Music vibrated through the walls and stairs as he got closer to the central area of the club.
He’d never been good at getting dressed up and looking presentable. But now, his nerves were making it almost impossible to get ready. He was already running late due to stupid Andrews and his last-minute meeting.
“I don’t remember,” mumbled Harry as he removed his arm and sat up a little. He didn’t remember the last time he ate. A while ago, he thought. It wasn’t probably normal for him to be able to go days without eating. But years of living with the Dursleys had gotten his body used to not eating for long periods.
“Good.”
“You know when you asked me...if I was sick...on New Year’s,” Harry couldn’t bring himself to say the actual words break up.
Those lucky classmates were Luna Lovegood at tonight's party, who had tagged along with Ginny, who Dean Thomas had invited. Ginny had been present at most of the parties since she and Dean were dating again. Since that night at the Burrow, Harry made sure to keep his distance from Ginny and Dean. Since returning to Hogwarts, he’d half been expecting Ginny to spread the news that he was gay. He was always on edge those first few days back. However, no one said a word to him about it, not even Ron. It seemed like Ginny had believed that he was joking about the whole being gay thing. As for his friendship with Dean, it was no more. Not that there had been anything there beforehand. Sure they had shared some laughs and good times earlier; however, those carefree days were gone. Harry wasn’t sad about this. He would rather be alone most days if he were being honest, which was hard enough as it was in the saviour of the wizarding world and all.
Harry watched as Draco raked his hands through his hair and stormed out of the room, the Floo flaring to life a moment later.
Draco turned his head slightly and met Harry’s eyes. They stared at each other for a moment before Draco was snaking his fingers through the curls at the back of Harry’s neck and pulling him into a long, deep kiss.
A tense beat of silence passed before Harry decided he had enough. He took a step closer to Draco, invading his personal space. He gave the blonde a heated kiss on the mouth before beginning to kiss the side of his neck. Harry’s mouth left a trail of hot, wet kisses down the blond’s neck to his chest. His fingers quickly worked at the buttons of his shirt as he did so.
He immediately regretted his decision to kiss the other boy as Draco just stood there. The blonde did not kiss Harry back.  Harry had made a mistake. He’d read Draco wrong, he thought. Embarrassment and shame washed over him as Draco suddenly placed his hands on Harry’s forearms and pushed him away.
“Harry! Oh, my Merlin! You’re alive!”
“No!” he spat out bitterly to himself. “No.” He stated again, more firmly. He shook his head and immediately rose to his feet. He didn’t bother to turn off the TV as he reached for his tiny glass of wine and drained it in one motion. Anger boiled within him as he stormed into the powder room on the first level of the house.
“Welcome to The Funk Room!” the hostess announced as she pointed up to a pink neon sign above the archway. Harry’s eyebrows rose high up on his forehead in surprise as he glanced up at the sign. It flashed ‘THE FUNK ROOM’ at him.
“Malfoy! WAIT!” Harry called out. “I didn’t forget. It’s just been a long...day. Give me a couple of minutes. Come in. Come in.” He pulled open the heavy black door even further, allowing Malfoy room to come in.
The sound of Draco clearing his throat brought Harry’s attention away from the group of students and back onto the blond.
“Shall we return to the party?” asked Pansy, offering a hand to Draco.
They stayed like this for a moment or so longer before Draco was begging for more. He was overcome with the need and desire to have Harry inside of him. Harry pressed an open mouth kiss to the side of Draco’s neck, giving him one final pull before moving away. Draco hissed in protest at feeling the heat of the other man’s body leave him.
“Would you like to check your bag?”
He didn’t bother to wipe the cold water off as he lifted his head and once again appeared at himself in the mirror. He tried to smile, to mask what he is truly feeling inside. And for a second it worked. He looked happy and content. But then there was a peal of high pitch laughter at the back of his head. Laughing at his idiocy and thoughts of wanting to be happy for once.
Harry had the wireless on and was dancing around as he busied himself with making dinner.
Harry’s bipolar was still a constant battle. But things were better for him. He still had episodes of depression and mania, but Draco had learned the beginning signs of them over the years and knew what to do now when an episode occurred. Harry was still going to therapy and support groups weekly. They were still trying to come up with the right dosage of medication for him to take to make his episodes less frequent and not have him spinning into an alternate persona at times.
He’d had his naturally light blond locks washed, cut, and styled to perfection by his beloved hairdresser, Sophia, earlier that day, making him look and feel like a million bucks. He’d also treated himself to a waxing and eyebrow threading. He wanted to look like the absolute definition of perfection for his party.
Sobriety had been hard at first. He hadn’t quite known how to socialize without a drink in his hands when others did. Despite brunch on Sundays at the Burrow or just hanging with Ron and Hermione, all his social life happened in pubs or at parties at someone’s flat. He knew he didn’t need a drink to have a good time. But he hated feeling left out when everyone was getting wasted just because it was Friday night or any night for that matter and they could. His old school friends always seemed to be able to find any excuse to celebrate and throw a party. Maybe it was the fact that they’d all been forced to grow up too fast in the last year of the war and they knew how precious life was.
“Oh. I didn’t go,” replied Harry with a shrug of his shoulders. He turned to briefly look over at Draco before turning his attention onto a pot on the stove.
It had become their sort of bit. Any time now that they ran into each other, Harry would always point out how shocking and out of character it was for Draco to be seen amongst muggles. The first couple of times that Harry had done it, it was true. Not in a million years had he thought he would ever see the blond in the muggle world. But now he did it more just to get some sort of rise out of Malfoy who both hated and loved it at the same time.
“Draco,
Harry woke abruptly to the sound of the howling wind outside the window.
Harry didn’t know why he’d done it. He hadn’t been thinking. That was the problem. He hadn’t been thinking. He’d just let his body work on its own accord, not stopping to think about the fucking consequences of his actions. He loathed himself even more than he’d previously.
Harry put his hat and coat back on before following Draco outside. It had stopped snowing, he noted, before turning to look at Draco.
“Being gay isn’t anything to be disgusted or ashamed of, Harry," spoke Luna. She smiled fondly at Harry, reaching out and adjusted the flower crown on top of her head.
“I don’t know,” Luna said with a shrug. “I just sense it.”
“I don’t know why you told him to leave. I’m not eating,” stated Harry matter of factly like a stubborn child.
Harry’s hands traced the ridges of Draco’s spine as their bodies began to rock back and forth against one another. They shared a long passionate kiss, each enjoying the sensation of their hardened cocks rubbing together.
He sniffled as he rubbed his face violently with his hands. He let out a trembling breath as he once again attempted to stand. He knew he couldn’t stay hiding in this bathroom any longer. He at least needed to show his face to Malfoy and tell him to leave.
The alcohol and medication he was on didn’t mix well. In general alcohol only seemed to add fire to his already unbalanced brain chemistry. It fucked with his head. The first two or three drinks always felt good, amazing even. But then an hour or so in, the rose-tinted glasses he’d been wearing that whole time would be lifted off of his face and darkness would settle around him. He would get extremely down and sad within a matter of seconds. It didn’t seem to matter who he was with or what was going on around him at the moment or if he was mid-laugh mid- conversation. The darkness always found him.
And then everything changed. Dumbledore was dead, and Harry had to fight. When he had broken up with Ginny after the funeral, what he’d told her was true. That those last couple of weeks with her had been like something out of someone else's life, Harry knew deep down, no matter how hard he had tried to convince himself that Ginny was the one, that it was all just an act. That he didn’t love her, not in the way that he wanted to and not in the way that Ginny deserved.  Harry had used Voldemort as the reason at the time for their break up. And he’d been right; if Voldemort had known Ginny was his girlfriend, he would’ve used her again to get to Harry. However, looking back, Harry knew the real reason he had ended it with Ginny when he did was also that he would be the one to hurt and use her in the end.
“He needs to make himself look pretty first,” teased a thick Irish accent from behind. Both men turned and looked over at Seamus, another personal trainer, as he came into the locker room, smirking at Harry before going to his locker, besides Ron’s.
“Harry!” she cried out as she sank to her knees beside the bed and placed a hand on the side of Harry’s neck, seeking out his pulse.
“Never,” answered Draco softly, pressing a ghost of a kiss to Harry’s temple.
Harry just shook his head and flipped the Irishman two fingers before heading out of the locker room.
The Headmistress had assigned the returning 8th-year class to their own dormitory on the Northside of the castle. It was to promote inter-house relations and such. They had their own school colours too of orange and teal. Some people were upset about this and didn’t understand why they couldn’t just return to their old house dormitories. Harry hadn’t cared, though, which had not only surprised himself but for others too. Harry had always been a proud Gryffindor. And he still was to a certain point. But Harry was no longer that skinny kid anymore. He was changed, no longer caring about stupid house points and rivalries. He didn’t care about school either. But he had nothing else to do. He no longer cared about becoming an Auror as he initially planned to do back in his fifth and sixth years. So when the owl had first arrived during the summer with the school letter attached and Hermione’s constant pushing, he’d agreed to come. He couldn’t figure out a good enough excuse to give.
Harry’s eyebrows fused in confusion, his phone once again drawing his attention. He swiped at the screen again and immediately sent Draco a text, telling him that he was finally here. He hoped that by seeing the text, Draco would come and meet him outside.
And then, finally, it happened.
Harry closed his eyes shut, throwing back his head and giving Draco better access to the side of his neck as his fingers slipped around and under the thin waistband of the thong.
“I’m not hiding out,” replied Draco as he smacked his lips together and closed the tube of lipgloss before holding it out to Pansy. “I just needed to powder my nose.”
Harry had fumed at this.
“He’d been drinking though. We all were. But Harry shouldn’t have been drinking with all the medication he was taking. I should’ve been monitoring him. But I wasn’t. He didn’t need to be babied that night...I thought he didn’t need to be. I didn’t want to, to be honest. So I allowed myself to pretend that everything was normal. That we were all just normal young adults partying.” She took a brief pause to take a sip from her tea and gain control over her emotions. She didn’t want this story to be a sad tale. And it wasn’t really.
The most perfect, round, ripe peaches that he had purchased four days ago were bruised and rotting away. He’d left them in the large wooden bowl that Hermione had gifted him as a housewarming gift, in the centre of the kitchen island. Along with the milk and eggs.
“Harry. Please. When was the last time you ate?” pressed Hermione with worry.
Harry just stared at Draco for a second, not believing what he was hearing. His mouth was open slightly as he continued to stare wide-eyed in disbelief at his boyfriend. He’d hope that Draco would return his feelings, and now that he had, he didn’t know quite what to do about it.
In the time it took for Draco’s beautiful grey owl to return to with his reply, Harry had not only had a shower but also shaved and had a spot of tea and toast. He was seated at the large worn wooden table that took up a good portion of the kitchen, flipping through an old issue of the Prophet. He rarely read the rag of a newspaper nowadays. But Hermione had left it behind the last time she’d been over, at least a week ago now, and Harry had nothing better to do. He was eager to hear Draco’s response.
It was the early morning hours, so he luckily didn’t run into a soul as he made the long awkward walk towards the bathroom. Pushing open the heavy wooden door, Harry quickly made his way to a shower stall at the far end of the room. He hung his towel on the small hook beside the stall before shoving his boxers down and stepping out of them. He couldn’t help but moan slightly as his erection sprung free from its prison. Harry then stepped into the shower stall with his toiletry bag in hand and closed the curtain behind him.
“Thanks,” whispered Harry, not quite being able to meet Luna’s eye as he took the glasses from her outstretched hand and shoved them back onto his face.
Harry made his way into the living room, immediately heading towards the fireplace. He sluggishly dropped to his knees before Fire Calling Hermione. He’d always promised her that he would keep her updated and checked in after he came out of a low period.
Harry undid the small scroll which was tied there with a green satin ribbon. He gave the owl some treats before reading the message and quickly writing out a reply to the bottom of it.
Harry thought his eyes were playing tricks with him as he entered the produce aisle and saw a familiar blond standing there, amongst the peaches. He didn’t know if this was the universe's way of telling him something or not. He felt a wave of emotions as he watched Draco sort through the peaches as he had back in the summer. He felt a pull to go over to the peaches and chat up Draco as he had once before. But another part of him wanted to abandon his shopping altogether and head straight back home to the safety of his bed.
“What can I get for you, Suga?”
“Thanks, I guess,” replied Harry in bemusement. He didn’t know how to take this compliment that Luna had just thrown his way.
Almost five years had passed since that grocery store run-in at the produce aisle. There had been some rocky moments over the years, but for the most part, things had been good for Draco and Harry.
An hour later, Harry found himself entering the same coffee shop he’d taken Malfoy to previously.
“No,” Harry breathed out in a quiet voice. He was suddenly painfully reminded of Malfoy and their date. He bit down hard on his bottom lip as he felt a new set of tears fill his eyes. He felt ashamed and guilty all over again about how he’d ruined things between him and Malfoy.
Harry was awoken later by the ringing of the wards on the house going off.  He groaned and rolled over onto his back, blinking up at the ceiling. He didn’t know who was at his front door, probably some reporter or something he thought. His friends never used the front door, they always used the Floo.
“But you already gave me my gift.” Draco gestured to the shirt he was wearing. He hadn’t been expecting anything else from Harry tonight. He was aware that Harry didn’t make a lot of money with being a personal trainer, and the shirt had been somewhat on the pricey side already.
“Good evening.” She greeted him in a posh accent.
“I’m gay. I’m gay. I’m gay!” He repeated each time, getting louder and more comfortable with the words. Harry couldn’t help but giggle at how silly it all was. “I’m gay. I’m gay. I’m gay.”
“Still sick?” asked the blond as he continued to study Harry.
“I don’t usually. But I could make an exception for you.” His voice dropped slightly, taking on a low flirtatious tone. He’d suddenly found his footing again as he smiled at the blond before turning to open the door. He didn’t wait for Malfoy to respond, already assuming the answer.  Draco just shook his head in bewilderment before quickly following Harry into the house.
A warmth spread through Draco’s entire body as Harry continued to look at him with adoration. The blond loved to be spoiled, but that wasn’t why he was feeling so fuzzy inside. He assumed a good portion of it was due to alcohol coursing through his body. Or just the way that Harry was looking at him with such hunger behind those eyes. Draco didn’t think he would ever get over how Harry’s little looks made him feel.
It didn’t take long before they picked up where they left off.
Malfoy shut the book he was reading and stood up as Harry approached the table.
“What is this?” asked Draco with curiosity as Harry slid the gift towards him. He eyed the silver bow before looking towards his boyfriend for some sort of explanation.
Harry placed the wine glass on the coffee table as he took a seat on the squishy worn brown leather couch. He turned on the TV that sat in the corner of the room with the flick of his wrist. That was another thing the medication helped to control, his magic. Like everything else, his magic was affected by his mental state. When he wasn’t in control of his emotions, his magic seemed to have a life of it’s own.
“No! Don’t Draco me, Potter! I have been here for five minutes and you haven’t uttered one word that has convinced me. I knew tonight wouldn’t mean anything to you. But I at least thought that I did.”
“We will see.”
He pulled at the collar of his sweater, where it had begun rubbing uncomfortably against his neck. It was a dark navy blue wool sweater with specks of grey and white in it. It was one of his favourite sweaters. He’d gotten it at a charity shop a few years ago. Maybe it was because he’d grown up wearing Dudley’s hand-me-downs that he found some sort of comfort in wearing pre-loved clothes over brand new ones.
“Take those silly pants off and come over here. I’ve got a present for you to unwrap.” Draco, who was kneeling in the middle of the bed, touched himself seductively.
“What?”
“Why didn’t you tell me before?” asked Draco in a quiet voice.
Harry made a noise in agreement. However, it probably had everything to do with how good Malfoy’s mouth looked with milk foam on it and nothing to do with what the blond had just said. “Whatcha get?” asked Harry in a rush as he hooked his fingers around the handle of the cup and took a long sip from his drink.
That was a loaded question for Harry to answer, he thought. There were so many ways he could answer it too. He could be upfront and honest and tell Malfoy about all the different medications he was on currently to make him a more stable human being. He could tell him how just last week he’d broken down crying when his therapist had informed him that she would be going on maternity leave for the next six months.
Draco, wearing only the crisp button-up now, which was only being held closed by a button or two, having shed the blazer sometime ago, had his arms raised high above his head. His grey eyes bore intensely into Harry’s green ones.
Draco couldn't help but turn his head to the side and pressed his lips against Harry’s neck. Breathing in the fucking intoxicating scent of his sweat. He pressed his nose against Harry's skin and rested it just beneath his ear. He stayed there for a second before pulling slightly back.
Draco moaned and encouraged Harry to go harder as he lifted his hips and matched Harry’s thrusts. He resisted the natural urge to close his eyes as he wrapped his hand around his aching cock and twisted it upwards.
Harry turned around and faced Draco. His eyes pierced into the blond’s as he sang out loud to the song.
. Don’t give up on me. You promised,” begged Harry.
Harry stared at the broken shards of pottery on the floor, laying only a few feet away from where he sat against the cabinet door. His eyes blurred with unshed tears as a familiar storm of darkness rained over him.
“No, not really. Being normal is perfectly dull. Don’t you think?”
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s tip, licking a little at the precum dripping from it before letting go of Draco altogether and rising to his feet.
“It’s nothing special. Just something small” rambled on Harry, who was suddenly nervous. He chewed on his bottom lip, watching nervously as Draco undid the tape and pulled off the paper. Harry always got slightly worried when giving someone a present. He was constantly overcome with fear that they wouldn’t like what he bought them and would say it directly to his face. Draco had been right before; the shirt was supposed to be Draco’s primary and only present. However, Harry had come across the gold dragon coin necklace at a charity shop the other week on an outing with his friend, Hermione, and knew he had to get it for Draco.
"Tell me about it," whispered Draco as he nuzzled his nose into the side of Harry's neck and inhaled the fresh scent of his skin.
“Hey, Dr- Draco,” stuttered Harry, nervously as he approached the blond.
Harry couldn’t help but snort in amusement at this remark. He didn’t know if that was true, but knowing Luna, she probably meant it. He ran a hand through his hair as he looked back at a smiling Luna.
The woman looked up from the tablet she was typing on and over at Harry as he approached.
“Oi! Mate! You’re still fuckin’ here?!” asked the redhead in surprise.
There was an awkward pause in the conversation before Draco was leaning forward and brushing his lips ever so slightly against Harry's.
“Yes,” whispered Harry.
The awkward tension between them spilled out into the rest of the evening. Harry, who was still a little dazed from the medication, didn’t say much through dinner. He knew he should be talking and charming Draco. Fuck, he wanted to do that. But his heart wasn’t in it. So he sat there, pushing his food around on his plate, listening and making all the appropriate noises and head movements when needed.
