But he had no interest in cooking with a ghost-powered oven, nor had he been able to find anything on actually
In reality, it boasted a thriving community roughly the size of Hogsmeade. Beautiful homes with lush gardens dotted the beaches, with upscale cafes and boutiques along the sole road that circled the island in a great big ring. In the middle of the isle was the San Adra Quidditch Park — a large, grassy field with two quidditch pitches and an obstacle course for the more daring flyers. Witches and wizards who weren’t as flight-inclined tended to use the grounds for picnics and walking their crups. The photos in Draco’s travel guide hadn’t done it justice.
She walked back to the Untucked lounge, where she found Lorena and Paris engaged in a screaming match. Venus was sitting in between them. She had pulled the back of her sofa cushion over her head and was attempting to hide underneath it, shrinking down until her backside was almost off the sofa entirely. Kali was standing in front of a vanity with one ear bud in her ear, practicing the lip sync number.
A few minutes later, after resting his head on the table long enough to get a bright red mark on his forehead, he remembered to check the jar of pumpkin juice in his chilling cabinet. It was nowhere near empty.
“Very well,” Draco acknowledged. He pulled the book out of his robe pocket. He then imagined a large, round table to give them a surface to work on.
“But—” Potter stepped closer into Draco’s personal space and lowered his voice to a purr, “—being around all our crazy friends will be so much more fun if you’re there.”
” Kali innocently affixed a long, black wig onto her head and parted the thick fringe in the middle.
“Morning, Racers!” RuPaul called from the video screen. “Are you ready to play a game? Ooh, I do love games! But...who am I gonna play? More importantly,
He held up his hand as Draco opened his mouth to speak. “And before you say it, yes, it would have been cheating, and I’m sorry for that, too. I guess I let the competition get to me,” he added sheepishly.
Draco posed with her arms extended elegantly above her head at the back of the runway, wearing a shell-pink leotard, black tutu, sheer black stockings, and pink ballet flats. She had styled her wig in a high chignon.
“But if you don’t mind, could we go to my room to apply it?” This was awkward. Why had he brought the potion with him?
“Hey, assholes!” Another queen called out as she stepped into the room behind RuPaul. The queens cheered.
It was sweet, really — and her letter had given him some comfort after losing his name. He had only met his Aunt Direxia once when he was little due to his father’s prejudice against vampires. He wanted to take her up on the offer of a visit now, and get to know the two-hundred-year-old vampire who was probably the only person in existence who could get away with calling Lucius Malfoy “Little Lucy.”
Draco performed a lip sync to Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance,” which the manager of the Bent Unicorn had requested since many customers had missed the first episode. After the audience reactions during the episode, she wasn’t too surprised to hear people cheering her on during the number. The cheers spurred her on and she felt more confident in her performance.
“Bitch, all you kids are making me feel old today!” RuPaul laughed and shook his head. He then gave Draco a quick tutorial on how to lift the handle from the receiver, and which end to hold in front of his mouth and which to hold up to her ear. The figure behind the partition laughed.
“All right,” RuPaul continued. Let’s move on to the next question. This one is for Jason: The big bad wolf is a drag queen. Instead of huffing and puffing, she
Harry found his floo address and flooed him immediately. Rather than a floo call, however, Pendleton insisted on inviting him over to tea.
“Don’t you remember how I was gone for several weeks last summer? That’s when we filmed all the episodes.”
“This is going to be a right bloody mess, I swear by Ross’s pink frilly knickers,” Draco told the camera, shaking his head.
“Hmm. All I know is that I’ve really gotta serve the best damn Elsa I can on that runway,” Steve said nervously.
Draco had opted for his idea of a “power outfit” to build his confidence going into the challenge: a three-piece suit made from a kelly-green brocade patterned with gold dragons, a matching green shirt, a gold tie fastened with a snake tie pin made from small peridots, and a gold pocket square.
Draco considered this and looked out across the parking lot while the other two smoked in silence. She started to turn back to the door to go back inside when Steve screamed.
“I went to a boarding school in Scotland for seven years of my adolescence, from age eleven to seventeen. The school was in a castle, and my room was in a part of the dungeon next to the lake. We had glass windows that were underwater so we could look out and see the fish. Sounds quite lovely, does it not?”
“Well. I do believe our minds were in different places because I was thinking about cake, but I said
“You will need to find out who is responsible for managing the Black estate and ask them how to file the estate taxes. That will be seventy-five galleons for my services.” He jotted the information down on a piece of parchment and handed it to Harry. The to-do list had only two items.
“Nice weather for flying this morning, huh?” she commented as they both steered their brooms around another curve in the pitch.
“Yeah! And you—” Intoxia pointed at Draco— “just look like you made some shit up because you know nothing about pop culture.”
“You have won a photoshoot as the next face of BYZGMTX Eyeworks in their new marketing campaign, ‘Read the Fine Print.’” The queens clapped.
to vote. There’s too much on the line to just sit back and let other people elect the ones who could decide whether we have the right to live or die.”
love, anyway? He hadn’t felt much attraction for anyone since he came home from Hogwarts one day and found a megalomaniacal murderer in his home. For that matter, he wasn’t sure he was going to live that much longer himself, so maybe he was destined to become Myrtle’s ghostly toilet lover in the afterlife.
The dolls get political as they all run for president of the United States! “America is finally ready for a drag queen president. Because after one reality show president, what more could go wrong?”
After Lorena had had a chance to clean herself up and Goldie had sat Steve down for a heart-to-heart at her vanity, the queens eventually lined up and reentered the stage.
“I shared a room with four other boys, nine months of the year, for seven years. Now, let’s take a moment and think about eleven-to-seventeen-year-old boys. There was something we all did in that room, and it wasn’t studying.
“And,” RuPaul continued, “you’ve won an all-expenses-paid trip to Washington, DC, to be featured in the 20__ Washington Pride Parade.”
Eventually, it was Draco’s turn. He jumped up onto the stage and shook Jones’ hand with his lips pursed in mirth.
“Werk, Mama,” Goldie Hanako cheered as Acacia Davenport wiped away the message. “You pulled out some serious moves in that lip sync!”
“Now, for this week’s main challenge,” RuPaul continued, “You will all be serving us your best jokes in a stand-up routine before a live audience!” RuPaul laughed as the queens groaned. “To help you create a winning routine, you’ll each take a ten-minute, one-on-one comedy workshop with legendary funny man, Bruce Vilanch.
Kali grinned. “I’m just happy with the critiques I got. I don’t feel like I have to worry about going home this time!”
“Aww, I’m so sorry to see her go!” Carmelita Corazon whined. She picked up a spray bottle and rag and handed them to Draco. “It’s all your fault she’s gone, so you clean it up,” she said, gesturing toward the message.
Third confession: I find antique dolls creepy AF. Dressing Draco up like one was a cathartic exercise — leave it to Draco to find comfort in something that scares the bejeezus out of me!
“You have won a two-thousand-dollar gift card for Wild Hairs — the wigs for queens who want to stand apart from the crowd.”
” Intoxia cried. “At this stage of the competition, we’ve all been cloistered away without any sex in, like,
“If I may have your attention,” Draco announced in the werkroom as the queens were styling their wigs and steaming their costumes. “I would like to inform you regarding my decisions for the lineup.” The other queens gathered around his worktable.
with that one. Even if those plans hadn’t been canceled for him, he had no interest in pursuing them anyway. Drag was much more fun and colourful.
, Draco thought. She narrowed her eyes and fixed the other queen with a calculating look. Who was she to take over Draco’s photo shoot?! Sure, Draco was less experienced, but she knew that she needed to be the one in charge here if she wanted to stay in the competition.
Ivana shrugged again and took another puff. “Meh, you’re really better off if you don’t get into it,” she told Draco. “Some nights, it feels like half of the money I make in the clubs goes toward these things. I just haven’t been able to kick the habit.”
When four teams emerged, RuPaul continued. “Now, because I own fifty-one percent of this company, I will assign each team a product. Oh, Pit Crew!” Four burly men clad only in underpants strolled into the werkroom, each one carrying a tray. RuPaul pointed to the first tray.
She wore a bobbed platinum blonde wig that framed her face in a mass of curls with a mint-green origami dragon perched above an off-center part. A white fur stole draped over her bare shoulders, a sparkling mint-green sleeveless mini-dress with a lavender belt underneath. She had a slender figure as a queen, foregoing padding to show her naturally lithe shape and legs for days. Delicate patent-leather lavender pumps graced her feet.
Eventually, everyone was out of drag, the cameras turned off, and the queens returned to their hotel. Draco entered his room that night to find a bag with Courtney Act’s cake-smeared wig and dress lying on the bed. He cast a few cleaning charms until the items were back to mint condition, then conjured a bouquet of yellow roses in a crystal vase. He wrote a quick apology note on the hotel stationery and carried it with the flowers and the bag down to the front desk to have them delivered.
“That’s taking away her agency!” Crabbe shouted back. “She got enough of that from her dad. Death was the only matter that gave Ophelia any agency!”
Not mention smurfs? How could anyone make a hangover potion without a smurf? That was the key ingredient, as specified in
“Not that I’m not grateful for your visit,” Draco said, pouring himself a fresh cup of tea and sitting down with his breakfast at a modestly sized table in the kitchen (he never dined at the dining room table anymore). “But I didn’t even know you were a ghost. What brings you here? Why now?” He took a delicate bite of toast and looked at his guest.
With that, Draco took another minuscule bite from her chicken breast, then dropped the platter on the floor as she thrashed in over-the-top throes of orgasmic delight. “Oh—ohhh!” her eyelids fluttered. “My ovaries are
“I’ll tell you later,” Draco answered. She looked around the room. The hooded figure had once again left the pub before the end of the show, so Draco couldn't find out who it was. She would just have to wait until next week.
“Draco—! Queenie Q!” RuPaul addressed them. “Ladies, this is your last chance — to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync...for your life!”
Harry looked baffled. “Sweetie, you know I work tomorrow. How about this weekend? We’ll make a day of it.” He gave Draco a gentle kiss on his lips by way of apology.
“I won a challenge!” Draco told the camera excitedly. “I’d like to thank everyone who tried to bludgeon me back in school. The joke's on you, you tossers!”
“C’mere, boo,” Lady Cakes said, and pulled her over. Draco smiled in relief. Lorena joined their team as well.
“This wasn’t my time to go,” Queenie Q cried. “I know my look wasn’t that great, but I’m so much prettier and I have so much more I wanted to show the judges! Oh well, look for me on YouTube and subscribe to my channel!”
“Greetings! Thank you all for coming out tonight; it’s a pleasure to be here,” she said to the audience after grabbing the microphone and holding it — the
“OH!” Myrtle’s eyes lit up. She smacked her fist into her palm. “That was you, eh?” She swooped in closer to him, then frowned.
“It was supposed to be a surprise,” his right head continued. “As you can see, I still have some work to do.”
“Fundamental!” The queens chimed in unison and applauded. They had made it to the reading challenge!
knew that,” Draco chimed in. “And I’ve had the least experience of any of you. When I found out I was going to be on the show, I drilled myself every day,” she said. “Lip sync drills—” she clapped her hands — “makeup drills—” another clap— “sewing drills—”
“What gets me is how Kali could be in the same room with three British people and still not be able to fake a British accent,” Michelle said. “I mean, talk about Amy Winehouse! Kali’s Jameela Jamil made Yara Sofia’s Amy Winehouse sound authentic.”
, a thin strip of white fabric wrapped around her head to imitate a Greco-Roman statue. On her feet, she wore gold stiletto sandals with gold cords that wrapped back and forth up her legs to tie at the knees. A gold armband in the shape of a snake hugged her upper arm.
the Golden Trio this time. Or maybe it was because walking down the hall next to Potter made him feel just a bit ill. He knew he shouldn’t have eaten that stupid sausage.
“Mr. Darcy can eat my arse,” Draco sneered, spinning in a quick circle before smacking her hand on her bottom for emphasis, and danced off to the side when RuPaul summoned Lady Cakes for her turn.
“So now you’re curious, are you?” Draco looked back at him and smirked. Potter’s face reddened in response. “Very well,” Draco said, and turned back in to face the room.
Draco turned to Granger, who blushed. “This is about shattering the glass ceiling,” she repeated, albeit more bashfully than earlier. Draco turned back to the shirtless celebrity impersonator.
As it turned out, the flame war was not what Draco had feared. Instead of facing death by fire, he had been sat him down with a calming draught while Dean Thomas explained that trolls on Twitter were posting racist tweets bashing queens of color on the show and saying they wanted Draco to win Drag Race.
“I think this was a breakthrough night for Draco,” Ross said. “I really feel like she stepped up to the plate this week, and she knocked it out of the park.”
“We could all tell she was having a hard time, and she chose to take out her own feelings on others by picking fights,” Lorena added.
“Naw, not the real one. That’s what I call my flotation device. But she kept me company on the open waters, and I protected her from the sharks with my handy-dandy Swiss army knife.” She held up a tiny pocket knife, eliciting another laugh from RuPaul.
“You’re hired. We’ll test your act at next week’s viewing party to give audiences a taste, then add you to our promotional flyers for the show next month.”
“Draco—,” RuPaul began, “Your comments tonight on the runway were full-bodied, but your geometric couture lacks...dimension. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
In the end, Ivana Mann sashayed away. She gave a slightly tearful goodbye after Kali Sister, equally tearfully, joined the rest of the queens at the back. Draco tried not to scowl, but the camera managed to pick up on a faint look of displeasure.
Jones handed Draco the card and showed him how to hold it. Draco learned that a very thin wire suspended the card and wrapped around his fingers, so he only needed to practice maneuvering the wire until he could control the direction.
“Draco is giving you Chun Li, she is literally flying through the air like Sonic the Hedgehog and rolling around on the floor doing some kind of sexy slithering dance,” Intoxia commented. “And I see Queenie just prancing around, patting her titties and pointing at the judges. Step it up, girl!”
“More is more?” Draco had the good grace to look sheepish. She turned to RuPaul and explained, “It’s
“That means that Goldie Hanako, Draco, and Paris Davenport will be working together on the competing team.” RuPaul concluded. The trio stepped closer to each other and joined hands.
like pages in a book. He still couldn’t believe that he not only made it onto the show, but was still there after six eliminations.
have been notified and will edit their recorded footage accordingly to remove any mentions of the Malfoy name from muggle audiences.”
this is part of the NMCS package!” she simpered with saccharine delight. “Don’t you want the no-mags to be convinced that you have flown the friendly skies? It’s only appropriate that you arrive looking just as tired and annoyed as if you got off a long flight and went through the regular US Customs.”
“All right,” Draco shrugged. “I suppose you came here to talk to me about getting a spot in an upcoming viewing party? Tonight is too short a notice.”
“Tell you what,” Millicent said. “I’ve been practicing my concept and I think I’ve hit on something that will help sell tickets, maybe bring in a demographic that wouldn’t otherwise come, you know?”
Lorena dashed off the stage to cheers and applause, tapping Draco on the shoulder as she waited in the wings. “Good luck, bitch! I left you a banana peel on the stage in case you need it,” she winked.
“More than that,” she continued, “I have never been more proud of you. You are forging a new life for yourself on your own terms, in what must be a terribly unfamiliar landscape. You are
more than two hundred times to create the Medusa wig she now modeled for her Girls Gone Gorgon number. What looked like a massive amount of hair from a distance consisted of a large nest of
“You can pull it out of the stand,” Vilanch interrupted. “Or adjust it. Either way, we need to be able to
“Shove off,” Draco sneered, and pushed past him and out of the restroom. He returned to his table in the workroom and vented his anger by hammering away at his metal henge construction.
“Yeah, boo, we know,” Lady Cakes laughed. “We oughta make a list of all the movies you need to see.”
Goyle shrugged and began to pile the tiny sausages onto his plate. It was a bit of a balancing act given the amount of food he already had piled on there, but this was one of the arenas in which Goyle was a shining star of skilldom.
Draco, why don’t you take Rose Dawson since you can speak with a British accent?” Draco looked up from the script, hoping his confusion wasn’t too evident on his face.
Venus Flygirl as Leeloo wore a bright orange wig and a costume that looked like it was made out of white elastic bands. She lip synced a long line of gibberish as she spun around the pole gracefully, her lips not matching the words by a long shot.
Draco scrunched his face in concentration. After a moment, his heads merged back into one. He breathed a heavy sigh of relief and briefly shook his arms and legs before stretching his left arm across his right side.
Draco gave herself one final appraisal in the mirror backstage at the Bent Unicorn before taking a selfie and posting it to Instagram. The beauty of her muggle camera was that any magic she used could be masked by the stillness of the photo or by claiming she had gone shopping. She was still working on her grasp of the ever-changing jargon, but she was becoming a fast fan of social media. She finally had a way to show off more of her handiwork in designing costumes beyond
Katya appeared to ponder this question seriously. “Watch out for falling rocks,” she said sagely, “in about two hours.”
Suddenly, there was an explosion in the Bent Unicorn. People screamed as debris flew from the direction of the stage.
Lady Cakes had, to everyone’s surprise, choked during her routine. She had attempted some religious humor, but when the audience didn’t laugh at the first two jokes, she got nervous and stumbled through the rest.
“Swimmingly,” Draco answered confidently. Her teammates turned to him in surprise. “I’d be worried if I were you.” Draco smirked.
“Are you feeling intuitive?” RuPaul asked them. “For this week’s mini challenge, I want each and every one of you to reach deep down and feel...your gut.”
RuPaul laughed. “Okay, I think we need to cut this short before our legal team hears back from the censors.”
Malfoy Manor had changed a lot over the years since the Dark Lord had occupied it. It was now a bright, cheerful place, where Draco and Harry were living out their retirement in their own wing separate from the one Scorpius occupied with his wife. The most recent generation of Malfoys had already grown up and chosen to live in London flats.
Instead of reading off the accountant’s information, however, Pendleton threw a pinch of floo powder into the fire and called a name Harry would have least suspected.
Draco sipped his tea with both hands, relishing in the warmth in his fingers. “Hmm. Maybe the ritual worked better than we realized.”
“If you’re talking about me, I think you should just admit it. You don’t think I deserve to be here!” Steve pouted.
“Apparently he went missing sometime last night. No one knows what happened to him. McGonagall is already looking for a replacement to teach History of Magic,” Scorpius explained, not noticing his father’s look of dumbfounded surprise.
“Hi, Draco,” Goldie greeted as he walked up to Draco, who was focused on the stuffed koala in front of him. “Have you decided what you’re gonna do with that koala bear?”
“Very well. It all began when your father was at Hogwarts.” With that, Burbage slipped into storytelling mode.
“I see you two already know each other!” Pendleton clapped his hands together in delight. “Capital!”
Lady Cakes McMansion laughed. “Girl, she means twelve more to beat before she wins the crown.” A few queens laughed as they began shedding wigs and false eyelashes.
He sighed and looked off to the side. “It’s given me a bit more freedom to live my life on my terms, I suppose. That’s why I use my real name in drag. Let our family name stand for something he hates.”
The pièce de resistance was her take on Stonehenge. Individual stones, fashioned from the metal plates, had been sautered onto the stiff wire into a large circle near the base of her floor-length skirt and spray-painted with silver glitter. The circle was attached to the skirt by means of two cords that hung from a belt of silver tea roses around her waist. Around her neck was a necklace that echoed the pattern of standing stones as a smaller, crystal henge.
Last week on DDR: Draco discovered social media, healed Lady Cakes' wrists, gave Goldie four eyebrows in a mini-challenge makeover, faked an orgasm in a chicken commercial, told everyone she'd been disowned, did the Gemini Tango on the runway, won the main challenge with Lady Cakes and Lorena, received a couple owls in front of muggles, and found out she's getting sued by Lucius.
“I couldn’t sleep until I got into the habit of imagining the sound of other boys wanking. It made it especially challenging to work out my sexuality,” she told the audience. “I thought, ‘I
“Now Draco, I heard that Kali wanted Venus to pick you for their team. Why do you suppose he chose Lorena instead?” RuPaul asked, stirring the pot immediately.
Meanwhile, in the Untucked lounge, Draco glumly sipped her cocktail and mulled over her limited options. It seemed clear that she would be lip syncing that week, based on the judges’ critiques. The others seemed to agree as they debated who would be in the bottom two, undecided between Steve and Acacia.
After the magic show, the audience left and the queens prepared for their runway presentations. The theme was “Witch, Please!”
Well. If it was fine with the LA Aurors Department, then it was fine with Draco. These were muggles, after all, and it wasn’t like Draco was performing
He sighed again. Finally, he had seen Astoria in his dreams, and it was wasted on something as banal as groceries. Unless pumpkin juice had some kind of symbolic meaning? Maybe he should look it up in a dream interpretation manual.
This was apparently not the answer the judges expected, because a moment of silence filled the set before RuPaul spoke up. “How many TV shows would you say you’ve seen?”
The queens entered the stage for the main challenge, dressed in their presidential debate attire. Draco had opted for a royal blue suit without a blouse, revealing a deep vee of pale skin underneath her jacket. Her blonde wig was pulled into braids wrapped into an elegant Dutch crown around her head.
Happy for the distraction, Draco pulled a small notebook and pen from out of the top of her dress and opened the book to a page in the middle, prepared to take notes. “Go on,” she said.
“Honestly, I think it’s ridiculous that we should have to sew our own costumes,” Carmelita Corazon complained. She had also been harshly criticized for her look. “I have tens of thousands of dollars in costumes that I brought with me and I can’t even show them off! I have people who make my outfits so I don’t have to!”
Ivana rushed to his side. “You can sew it. Just put some tape on the bottom of the foot so it can slide through the machine.”
“Did you hurt yourself?” Draco whispered. He held out his hand for the other wrist, and Lady Cakes complied.
“Draco—, you served us uniqueness with your red carpet look tonight on the runway. But if you don’t watch out, these other queens will walk all over you,” RuPaul admonished. Draco braced herself and gave RuPaul a steady look and a stiff upper lip. “Draco—, you are safe.” Draco let out a breath she didn’t know she had been holding and curtsied before walking to the back of the stage.
“It’s a brand new day in the workroom” Venus cried. “And, we still have seven queens this week. Which one of you am I gonna send home?” He laughed.
“I bet this is some kind of psychological test. They implant some of us with certain memories, and then take those memories away just to see how we react when we’re confused.”
By the time all the queens had arrived, there were fourteen in total. In addition to Goldie, Paris, and Venus, Draco learned that the other two queens who had been there when she arrived were Steve Donovan (a showgirl from Las Vegas who apparently didn’t use a fake drag name either) and Lorena Gucci, a fashion-obsessed queen from Puerto Rico.
Sure, he did well enough in primary school to outperform Dudley (though that wasn’t exactly much of a challenge). Then he went to Hogwarts. And while he learned many skills necessary to magical life, what he did not learn was any application of numbers beyond his primary education.
Got a favorite fictional queen name? Any songs you want to see in future lip syncs? Celebrity guest judge requests? Please leave a comment!
” Acacia cried. “OhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygod!!!” Acacia pointed to a spot on the worktable and moved to stand on a chair at the other end. Goldie, Paris, Intoxia, and Steve all screamed and backed away quickly.
Blaise laughed. “Well. If he can get used to your charming personality, then the BBC should post no problems for him.”
Malfoy looked at it for a moment before shaking his hand. When Harry started to let go, the blond only tightened his grip. Harry looked into his grey eyes in surprise.
never going to strip tease for an audience,” he reasoned. “And, given his popularity as the Saviour of the Wizarding World and the Ministry’s Hotshot Auror, I think it’s safe to say that there is a tremendous untapped market for this type of performance art. Put me in your show. I guarantee we’ll sell tickets faster than you can blink.”
“You’ve each won one thousand dollars and a year’s supply of corn dogs from Bitch on a Stick — where it’s a total sausage party, and everyone’s invited! Paris Davenport, Goldie Hanako, Kali Sister.” The three queens stepped forward.
“It’s got nothing to do with Beyoncé being funny,” Lady Cakes argued. “Have you never seen that clip of Kanye West at the Grammys? We had both Beyoncé and Taylor Swift on Snatch Game. How could I
Meanwhile, Draco found a stack of rectangular metal plates, some stiff wire, and a pair of metal rods. This wasn’t going to be a repeat of the first sewing challenge. No Sir! He could work with this.
Apparently, Carmelita had over-relied on accessories to make up for her terrible sewing skills. She had managed to turn pink silk taffeta into a long tube with loose threads hanging from the bottom hem. It was so tight around her legs that she had trouble walking in it.
Draco lifted the spider closer to his face and smirked. “I shall make you my drag daughter,” he told it, “And I shall call you Araneus.”
“Well, I can see you have a lot of work to do, so I’ll leave you to it.” RuPaul moved on to Lorena’s work table and proceeded to ask him about Ariana Grande.
Well, the note provided one answer, certainly. There in black ink was the reason why Sirius Black was disowned from the Black family tree.
His only solace was that the twins made true on their word, and delivered Norbert the dragon to the tower to be given to their brother Charlie within the week, and with little fuss.
In case you were wondering, yes, the twins' speech DOES make me want to die. And yes, I skipped Diagon Alley. We've all read that, haven't we?
“No,” Millicent replied shortly. “His books are filled with mistakes – only half of it makes sense, and he’s so arrogant that even if it
“Oh, shut up,” said Draco, at the same time Blaise knocked him upside the head. “It’s still not a good idea.”
“I’ll return tomorrow, Mr. Potter,” she said, “And we will go to Diagon Alley for your school supplies. Would that be agreeable?”
“Well, if it’s just a social call, then you can refuse,” said Draco. He still wasn’t pleased that Neville and Hermione got to visit Hagrid with Harry, while he had to stay behind.
“Mister Malfoy!” Madam Pince stood behind him, glasses balanced carefully on her hook-like nose and doing nothing to disguise her stern, angry gaze.
and was quite possibly the strangest thing Harry had ever seen. After all, Harry’s Uncle Vernon had told him many times that he was unwanted in the Dursleys’ house, and this message had been reinforced at school by Dudley and his friends bullying anyone who even considered making friends with Harry (and of course proceeding to tell Harry that no one wanted to be friends with him in the first place, because Harry was a
“I think we should head back to the dungeons,” Draco said, looking quite nervous now that he realised where they were. “Didn’t Dumbledore say coming in here was dangerous?”
“Already here, Fudge? Good, good,” said the eldest Malfoy by way of greeting. He looked around Hagrid’s house like any part of it may be covered in disease.
Harry was happy to oblige, and so, apparently, were the rest of the Slytherins, because soon Harry was surrounded by warm arms and somehow, he didn’t feel claustrophobic.
The hair retreated, and Hermione’s worried face came into view. “Oh, you idiot! You could have been killed, this is two years running! Oh-” She gave up any sense of lecturing, and reattached her arms around Harry’s neck.
Adrian Pucey stared at him incredulously. “Of course I do. Don’t think I forgot our game last year – you’re going to be our new seeker, kid, I told you.”
Harry slept all the way through that night, and dreamed of swimming in the Black Lake with creatures he could not name.
He was in the Slytherin Common Room, staring at the forest-green ceiling with his chair sprawled next to him and a sharp ache in the back of his head.
Despite Draco’s confident words, Harry could feel the other boy shaking. Across from them, Adrian Pucey nodded in acknowledgement. It may have been meant in comfort – knowing Adrian, Harry thought it unlikely, but it would have been nice.
Blaise and Draco were either side of him now, both worried. Draco rested one hand on his shoulder, feather-light.
Harry remembered Lily Potter’s face. He remembered her green eyes, and her soft red hair beneath his fingertips. He remembered her voice cooing his own name at him. He remembered her scream as she died.
been a misunderstanding. Harry was simply visiting my own home for the holidays. Draco gets ever so lonely, you realise, and Harry wished to keep him company. We are only returning for a moment to retrieve Harry’s school notes from his first year. The boys wish to study together.” She turned an icy blue gaze on Petunia Dursley, brows still raised inoffensively in contrast. “Petunia and I spoke about the visit just a week ago, didn’t we Petunia? You remember, don’t you?”
Those sombre words silenced the table, until Harry sighed. “It doesn’t really matter right now though, does it?”
“Didn’t you see them talking at the Duelling Club?” Macmillan asked her in a conspiratorial whisper. “Justin let it slip to Potter that he was Muggleborn.”
“You put Slytherin in the lead for the House Cup with your little hero stunt,” Blaise told him with a lazy drawl. “Don’t ruin it just to get back at a
then. But the only older students I know well enough are Gemma and Adrian, and I don’t think either of them are that stupid, do you?”
So it was that the first year Slytherins made their way to the Quidditch pitch that Friday afternoon, with varying degrees of excitement, to meet the Gryffindors for their shared lesson.
They all met up in the Leaky Cauldron, for convenience. Daphne was the last to arrive, and when she finally did they all found out why – Daphne had not come alone.
. Besides, everyone knows that Snape favours the Slytherins, because the rest of the school hates us.”
he thought to himself, but for a moment let his excitement overwhelm him. He was invisible, for Merlin’s sake! He could let himself enjoy that.
“I know!” Myrtle cried, flopping dramatically against the window. “It’s just like when I was alive, really. Have you heard of Olive Hornby? She was the real cruel one.”
Harry nodded. As the panic and anxiety seeped out of his system, the shame flooded in. There had been cameras in there. Tomorrow, his panic attack would be all over the
“We have to go see her,” Harry began to pack up his things, before a loud screeching interrupted him. The loudspeakers around the school crackled to life, echoing Professor McGonagall’s voice through the corridors:
On most nights, Harry found the quiet comforting. Not tonight. Tonight it seemed that every other student was watching him with wary eyes. He had slowly been getting used to the attention that came with being the Boy Who Lived, but there was something different about being stared at with disgust – even fear. The other Slytherins had warned him of the stigma that came with his ability, the ‘gift’ they called Parseltongue. Harry had thought he could deal with it. But not tonight.
Blaise squeezed him once, comforting, and left Harry standing in the corridor, late for Defence and his head spinning atop his shoulders.
He attached as many as he could to Hedwig’s expectantly outstretched claw, whispered to her who they were all for, and watched her fly away.
“And if we don’t?” Harry asked through gritted teeth, forcing his muscles to relax as thick vines began to squeeze his waist.
“That little performance! Did you see the doe eyes she gave you when you said you’d come back? She adores you.”
Harry had a whole list of things to say. However, seeing as numbers one through ten were variations of the word “unfair”, and number eleven was “you bastard”, he kept them to himself. He had dealt with worse than this. Vernon Dursley had taught him how to keep his mouth shut and his anger hidden – Harry had not dealt with ten years of the Dursleys’ treatment to give it all up now and get himself expelled.
Millicent immediately set off in a tirade, leaving Tracey to try and separate them while the others watched: Blaise and Daphne in amusement, and Neville and Hermione in concern. Theo took the opportunity to come up and pat Harry on the back in his own silent form of congratulations, before making his way over to Hermione’s side.
. He found the family line easily – the Black family, apparently, were a prominent pureblood house. No Sirius was listed, though some spots were darkened, almost burned off the page. What Harry did find was a small, familiar portrait atop a familiar name – the still picture of Narcissa Malfoy nee Black stared up at him from the page. Undeniably, it was her.
The Leaky Cauldron was a welcome sight to Harry’s tired eyes. The world was lightening; Harry had been walking for hours, so long that he could barely feel his feet. Everything he owned was back at the Dursleys’, save for the tattered hand-me-downs on his back. Harry was exhausted, and frightened, and very, very, alone.
"Just watch." Harry said, walking over to Dean's bed. He levitated a bucket of water over to the bed, grabbed a rope, attached it upright so none spilt to above where Dean's head would be when he sat up, attached one end of the rope to one edge and the other to his hand which was resting by his head. He turned to do the same to Seamus' bed. Once he was finished with his task, Harry cleared his throat and yelled "DEAN! SEAMUS!" both boys sat bolt upright moving their hands, unknowingly tipping the buckets and therefore pouring water all over their heads. Both boys sat in shock for a minute before turning to glare at a laughing Harry.
Savannah was a little on to say the least. To be honest harry didn't know how she was a Slytherin, she was to kind. Savannah, or Savie/Sav as she preferred to be called, wasn't human. She was part Elf and part Veela, but you wouldn't know by looking at her. Her mother was an Elf, a Dark Elf to be precise. There are two different types of Elves, Light Elves, they look a lot like Veela accept for their ears and coloured hair, and Dark Elves. Dark elves usually had dark hair and eyes. Their eyes were two toned but usually barely noticeable but they also had fangs, Dark Elves had to drink blood. The only way to hide their fangs and ears is with a glamour charm.
Draco didn’t know what to do. He was glad that he had put up those silencing charms. The screams coming from Hadrian were bloodcurdling. He wanted to help his mate, but didn’t know how to. The younger boy had curled into a ball in the corner of the room. He had an idea.
When we arrived Sav showed me the guest room that I was going to be staying in. she let me in and went to the window. "Oh My God." Was all she said.
“I think that would be best, both get grumpy if they don’t eat.” She said, chuckling softly. Hadrian smiled and went back to his cooking.
“I prefer your hair like it is.” The elf replied, turning away from the blonde. “Hurry up, we’ve got to go, we’re meeting the others in ten minutes.”
Harry was all packed and dreading going back to the Dursley's. He was praying that they didn't know Sirius was dead. If they knew then everything would turn south very quickly. After he had said his goodbyes he used the floo network to get back to 4 Privet Drive. There waiting for him was his uncle. His uncle grabbed him and shoved him into his cupboard wordlessly, chucking his stuff in behind him, he locked the door.
Harry had been at the Dursleys for three weeks and half and he was only allowed to eat three times a week. Harrys young mind didn’t understand what he did wrong. All he wanted to do was make them proud. Clearly, he was a terrible child. Otherwise he would be given presents like Dudley. He began to scrub harder at the floor he was cleaning.
Are you ready Harry?" she asked and when he nodded his head she cast the spell. There were six pulses of magic and then nothing. He felt normal again and looked down at himself and saw that he was, luckily, in the robe he was in when he was turned.
When Draco awoke, he slowly sat up on his bed. Standing up he heard his stomach growl and decided to make his way to the dining room. When he got there his parents were staring at him in shock. “What?” he asked, his eyes widening at the pitch of his voice.
"This is Crookshanks, my familiar, he's part Kneazle and doesn't have any relatives in the school." Hermione said holding the ginger cat with brown stripes to her chest protectively
Harry ran upstairs, hoping to get his wand and leave this hell hole. When he got to his old room, however, he was disappointed. It was locked.
She could just about see the outline of the nurse at the door. She noticed him nod, before telling her that he was leaving. Within an hour of the nurse leaving, Harry could see again. He waited for the doctor to return. It took another hour, but finally, a nurse came in to check on her. As soon as she noticed that she could see, the young lady ran out to find a doctor.
Draco came up the stairs when he heard the cries, and stopped short in his tracks. He turned and glared at Hunter, then asked, "What the heck? Why?" Hunter just yawned and curled up on his bed and pretended to be asleep. He heard a voice he knew all too well. Snape. Snape, who hadn't seen him before, seemed in shock for a few seconds until he lifted his head and looked the professor in the eyes. That was enough to snap him out of his shock.
Ten minutes later Hadrian began talking to them as a group, allowing them to ask any questions, then they would all have to talk in families for the remainder of the journey. They had all agreed to go by their original names unless in the presence of Dumbledore before.
He had been sat there reading for about an hour when some boys from a few years above him walked over where he was sat and began to mock him for not knowing their language. One of them snatched his book out of his hands while another pulled him to his feet.
When they got outside, Harry noticed a big man standing there, tears in his eyes. The adults were talking but Harry was too tired to listen. Eventually, he felt himself being handed to the new person. His uncle had handed him over, so he must be good! He was wrapped in a blanket and before long had fallen asleep.
When Harry awoke he was in the headmaster’s office and Dumbledore was looking through a book. “You seem to be registered as Mr. Malfoy’s familiar, okay you may leave. I think you will be wanted for the train ride home. It leaves in an hour after all.”
"I got caught, I don't know and I'm sorry, it just slipped my mind." Harry cut her off before she could finish.
Harry decided to go with what he called the 'Evil Wakeup Call' and this was the first time he was using it. He put up silencing charms around everyone else's beds and woke up Neville first, as he knew Neville was the easiest to wake.
When Harry awoke, he found himself still on the floor. He heard his uncle storming down the stairs. Before he could process what was happening Vernon was screaming at him. When he didn’t respond to what was clearly a question, the man kicked him in the stomach.
He found an interesting book with a lot of interesting information, such as, they like water, they eat avocados, they eat any meat, they can run up to 64mph at a sprint, there are only around 15,000 left in the wild, and even fewer black and, well, they are
came into the room he knew that he had to say something. He got up and closed the door, before sitting back on the bed. "Harry I know it's you." He said simply watching as the cat stopped the process of getting into bed and looked at him. His eyes held a bit of fear in them but other than that were the same as a cats.
The boys stood and hurried to follow her to her office. When they entered, she closed the door behind them. On opposite ends of the room, there were desks. Sat atop them was everything they would need for the exam.
"And do you know why it thought it was a good idea to rip the room to shreds?" Snape asked, pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration.
They got to Kings’ Cross station with almost twenty minutes to spare. Harry was left to collect his stuff by himself. He had been allowed to get a trolly beforehand, so they didn’t have to wait as long. As soon as he was done collecting his belongings and had shut the boot, Petunia drove away. Harry was alone. He felt tears coming to his eyes and shook his head. He swiftly made his way to his platform to see the train already there.
Petunia had decided to take Dudley on an ‘educational’ trip around the country and wouldn’t be returning to Surrey until it was time to send Dudley to school in five months.  He would be left alone with his uncle.
“Draco. I’ve got to go, I’ll explain later.” He took off again without letting him react, he heard the door to the compartment with Ron and Mi in slide open as he checked the one next to it.
"I'm not going to sugar coat it… probably because that's what is going to happen. I got my love of fashion from Maman, so it'll be the both of us. Sorry." Sav said, not looking the tiniest bit sorry about it.
The five months he was alone with Vernon, felt like years. When he was finally able to return to his friends he felt as though he was in a dream. This was the only thing that had kept him going while he was in England.
“Only if you call me Narcissa, Hadrian. Mrs. Malfoy makes me feel old.” She said with mirth shining in her eyes. Hadrian laughed softly before offering her some breakfast. “That would be lovely Hadrian. Although, I didn’t know you could cook.” Narcissa said looking at the dark haired boy curiously.
He struggled to eat in those five months. The other students would get to most of the food first and leave nothing for Harry. However, he still tried to gather as much as he could.
Harry was packing up to go to the Weasley’s for the remainder of the summer when his uncle stormed into his old room. He couldn’t go to the Malfoy’s as they were in France until 31
Sasha said. Sasha was a deep green in colour. Marley was slightly paler than Sasha yet had the scarlet tuft of feathers on the top of his head that all males do. Rosa was a brighter green than either of her siblings, and all have yellow eyes. Harry was lucky that their eyes aren't deadly for another few months.
"Don't worry Minerva, harry is safe. I am going to make an announcement at breakfast tomorrow. You see I have forgotten to tell anyone, but Harry is training in America for a while. Not even I know when he will be ready to return. Hopefully it shall be soon, however we will just have to wait and see." He replies with the twinkle still in his eyes. Minerva nodded and left Albus alone to think. This was going to be a long year.
“Vivienne. Vivienne Potter. But I will be down as Harry.” He added the last part as an afterthought. “My aunt and uncle were told I was a boy, and it was too late to change it.” He added, lying smoothly.
However when he came closer to the voice and heard what it said, he decided against it. "I need that stupid child here, where I can train him, manipulate him, and you are telling me that you don't know where he is? He's Harry Potter, something should have come up!" His voice was full or rage and Harry, feeling betrayed, and furious backed up and ran the rest of the way to the common room, not stopping until he came to the blank wall that hid the entrance. When he got there he had to stop, he didn't know the password, and he was a jaguar at the moment. He decided to sleep at the entrance but stay alert, just in case someone left or entered the common room.
Harry became withdrawn after the incident. During his time in Japan, he did not speak to one of his friends. The teachers were becoming worried. None of them understood what had happened.
“Oh! Hello Lisa.” Luna didn’t even ask what he wanted just followed him to where he knew the Gryffindor sixth years would be.
Harry sneaked down to the dungeons, and straight into the potions stores. He left 5 minutes later with the required dittany leaves. He somehow managed to get back to the chamber without any problems and feed the snakes the leaves, he explained that he would need to leave for the summer in two days. They were disappointed that he was going to be gone, but not half as much as Harry was. On his way back to the Slytherin common room he bumped into none other than Albus Too Many Goddamn Names Dumbledore,
"Oh merlin. Harry?" Ron asked, looking like he was going to die from shock. Harry merely nodded as Hermione ran forward and hugged him do tightly he could barely breathe.
“I assume that your mate was awake this time Theophania?” her mother asked, looking up from her newspaper. The young girl nodded and began tucking into breakfast. She hadn’t eaten properly in days.
His parents had warned him about what could happen. He would change to a version of himself that both he and his mate would like. He was told that the more drastic the change, the more painful it would be.
When they arrived at Hogsmead station the group hung back to wait for the last carriage. They went over the plan of how to be dramatic, no matter how much Amaia complained, again. “So, we wait until the sorting is over, then go into the Great Hall, making sure to hex open the doors with a bang, and standing there dramatically for a few seconds, or at the very least until everyone has noticed us, before glaring at Dumbledore and going to sit with our most trusted friends and explaining everything to them. I’ve sent a letter to our parents, so they’ll know to expect to see us at the next Hogsmead weekend. Any questions?” When everyone shook their heads Hadrian only nodded, and they sat in silence for the rest of the short journey.
Before anyone could say anything else there were footsteps coming down the stairs from the boys' dorms. "I'll go now before I'm seen." Harry whispered to his friends, before transforming back and stalking out of the common room.
that shielded them all from the spell. Then the old man had the nerve to try and talk them onto his side of the war, to which some of the teens just rolled their eyes, and Draco, always overdramatic, told him that “The day I join you will be the day I willingly dye my hair red.” Glared at him spun in a very Snape-like manner and left the room with the others, leaving Albus Dumbledore fuming behind them.
Going down to the basement to collect his stuff was painful. It took him five minutes just to walk down the stairs. His aunt had gone to wake his cousin. Seeing as Vernon had been up so late it would be Petunia taking the boy to the train station. Harry spent half an hour shuffling his stuff to the car while Dudley and Petunia got ready to leave.
"No problem! Maman will pick us up from the train station. Just let your relatives know. Oh, and we'll be going to Diagon alley for a bit of shopping!" she had a glint in her eyes that told Harry he was not going to like this trip.
When he got to Gryffindor common room he waited for his friends in front of the fire and remembered the last time he was here.
When Hadrian finally calmed down he burst into tears. It took a while, but he eventually fell asleep. The Veela moved his mate onto the bed and covered him with the blanket.
"I'm Harry." He responded. Harry never got to figure out the names because there was a blinding light and the horse looked up at the sky in shock. There as clouds were six figures. One for each of them. Each of their animal form. When they moved so did the clouds. "That's fucked up." Harry said. Before suddenly with another blinding flash he was back at Sav's house. Apparently Sav saw the flash because she looked down and squealed a little before realising
Harry became sad on his last day of school. His friends believed that was because he was leaving his friends. But in reality, it was because he would be in number 4 Privet Drive. When he there his aunt and uncle seemed to be afraid of him. He was left alone in the quiet for the best three days he had ever had in that house. He heard someone knock on the door and a hushed conversation. When the door closed his uncle cane towards the cupboard door, opening it rapidly. Smiling an awful type of smile, he dragged the young boy into the kitchen. Removing his belt, he began to yell at the boy. Calling him ‘freak’ and ‘boy’. Harry was unsure if the man even knew his name. He only knew it because of school! All summer he was yelled at and beaten. Through the years his pain tolerance had grown, but not enough to shield him from the agony that was currently happening.
“Oh!” Myrtle flew higher into the air, a hand over her heart. “How sweet! Ooh, it was dreadful. It happened right here,” she told them dramatically, drifting to hover over one stall. “In this very cubicle. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.”
Several rows up, Lady Adrienna Zabini, Blaise’s mother, sat with three empty seats to her right – she gestured Harry and the Malfoys over with a subtle nod of her sharp jaw. Harry had only met the Lady Zabini briefly, a few times in the leadup to Lucius’ trial. Her and Narcissa were close, as he understood it, yet Lady Zabini did not put him at ease as Narcissa did. With sharp, stunning dark features and eyes black enough to swallow you whole, there was only one word that came to mind when Harry thought of Blaise’s mother –
Harry’s second week at Hogwarts also brought his first flying lesson. Harry, Draco, and Millicent were the most keen, being the only three flying enthusiasts in the group (though unlike Harry, his friends had grown up with Quidditch and broomsticks and the like, and therefore, in Harry’s eyes, had less of a reason to be so excited).
The thing seemed to spread fully across the clearing, but it was almost impossible to tell where the creature ended and the shadows began, everything was black on black except for a set of eight, glistening eyes high above Harry’s head. It was the size of an elephant, Harry thought, remembering the friendly looking animals he’d encountered at the zoo with the Dursleys, maybe bigger. It was only when the thing came close enough for the lantern to illuminate two of its massive, hairy legs that Harry realised what it was.
“Ow,” Harry groaned, lifting a hand to his skull to assess the damage. No blood came back on his fingers, though the painful lump beneath his hair was bad enough on its own.
. Harry’s exhausted mind calculated that as a whopping two hundred points to Slytherin in one night, and he somehow dragged up the appropriate giddiness at the win. Still, he figured he had had enough adventure for one night (and from Longbottom and Hermione’s equally drained expressions, he guessed so had they), and he wanted nothing more than to collapse into his bed.
“Oh, plen’y,” he replied, with a frankly unnecessary amount of enthusiasm. “Love animals, I do. ‘specially the rarer ones, y’know? A lo’ of creatures are just misunderstood, really.”
Blaise was the last to leave. He hadn’t said much – rather, he’d been watching Harry with dark, careful eyes since the conversation with Snape.
after his detention with Snape he felt a sick curl of disgust start in his stomach. It was easier to just not think about it at all.
Harry looked at Hermione. She shook of her shock, and gave him a small smile. He turned back to Daphne. Pansy was wide-eyed next to her, gaze flicking quickly between him and her best friend.
The creature was nothing short of luminescent. It could have been a horse, if not for its ethereal beauty and the twisted marble-like horn stemming from its forehead.  The unicorn was lying unnaturally on one side, head lolling against one tree, silver liquid pouring from its side, and it was only with that closer inspection that Harry realised it was dead.
“It doesn’t matter who the Heir is going after,” Draco told them. “If he keeps at this, they’re going to have to close the school. My mother was writing me about it.”
Myrtle’s weeping sounded more like howling from inside. Every tap in the room was running, spilling water off the sides of the sinks in a steady stream. Harry’s just grateful she didn’t flood the toilets.
Harry mulled that over for a few moments. It seemed to make sense, but then again, Harry didn’t know all that much about phoenixes. He resolved to ask Hermione.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” muttered a very familiar voice, and Daphne stepped out from behind the bookshelf with a flick of her hair. She was followed by a sheepish Tracey, a grinning Pansy, a bemused Millicent, and a nonchalant Theo.
The rest of the group stared after her. Harry blinked, before sending a purposeful glance to Theo.  Theo nodded, and was gone, following Hermione down the corridor.
“Just because I like Quidditch doesn’t mean I have any interest in getting on a damn broom in front of the whole school,” she said. “I’m fine just watching, thanks.”
“Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. They’re the thickest people you’ll ever meet, of course, but they’re Draco’s hired muscle.”
Something about his words drew Harry’s attention. Tom looked on at the boy kneeling before him (though even a kneeling teenage Hagrid was taller than the already tall Tom) with the perfect balance of pity and righteous determination on his handsome face, but Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that something about him looked- wrong.
Harry didn’t get to catch up with either of his other friends until the next day. The second year was kicking off with a double Herbology period, which the Slytherins and Gryffindors shared, so Harry made sure to grab a seat next to Neville. Draco grimaced behind him, but sat down on his other side anyway.
“Actually, I think it’s a very sensible idea,” said Theodore Nott – the first words he had said all evening.
Draco had gone stiff as a board to Harry’s side. Slowly, and as subtly as possible, Harry shifted one knee to press against Draco’s. The other boy made no visible response, but Harry still hoped he had helped in some way.
charm. Even with the modified spell, however, it was a gruelling process, and by the end of it all there was not a student in the class who had anything kind left to say about their new professor – not even Pansy or Daphne.
“Harry,” Tracey explained, resting one gentle hand on his arm. “That diary could have done anything. There are plenty of cursed objects in the world – you need to be more careful.”
“Just Narcissa dear, remember,” the witch in question was saying absently. “And of course not. I’ll be helping you deal with your school supplies. I doubt you want to be carrying a heavy trunk everywhere with you, hm?”
“Are reborn from the ashes,” Harry finished in a breath, as a tiny wrinkled head emerged from the ash below the perch, blinking dust from its eyes.
Harry staggered backwards. His vision was hazy and fading, but as he turned around he thought he saw Headmaster Dumbledore staring at him from the entryway, something like worry and disgust on his face.
Harry blinked. Lockhart impersonated a fish as Ron’s wand flew from his hand – caught by Ron as it sailed over his head – and the professor was blasted against a wall for the second time that day.
“Still Petrified,” Harry said, jaw clenched. “Listen, Hagrid, we came to ask you something. We need to ask you about the Chamber of Secrets.”
“I’m sure this will be news to you, Mrs Malfoy,” – Draco’s own glare turned icy at the surely intentional term of disrespect to the Lady of a Noble House – “But a man who may be dangerous to our young Harry here has just recently escaped his confinement. The best place for him right now is with his family – I’m sure you understand.”
“Took your time, boys,” she greeted them, jumping to her feet. “Check this out – we’re not standing on rocks.”
. The page listed Narcissa as having two siblings – one, a woman with wild dark hair, listed as ‘Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black’; the other was unknown, lost beneath a scorch mark. Was that Sirius Black? Was he Narcissa’s brother? But then why was he disowned from the family? Because he was in Azkaban?
Dumbledore smiled at the newborn Fawkes fondly. “Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.”
Best to get it over with. Then he could return to his room and spend the day devouring whatever books Narcissa had sent him, to see what information he could find on one ‘Sirius Black’. Harry figured there was something smart in learning everything you could about the latest psychopath trying to kill you. Briefly he considered what it said about him, that so many people wanted him dead – but that was probably a rather dark path to go down, so he decided to ignore it instead.
Harry met his eyes around the Mirror. “You killed my parents. I have a good memory. That means I’m not great at forgiveness.”
“Oh, already? Ah, but look at the time! Dinner’s almost done! Spooky how time flies when one’s having fun, isn’t it?”
“Malfoy, you get him to the pitch on Friday if you have to drag him there, understood? And did I hear you talking about Nimbus 2001s?”
“Where is he?” Draco asked, tugging Harry up off the ground with a clenched grip on his hand. “He’s a friend, of us and of Hagrid.”
Fudge fiddled with his hat and made a jerky gesture for Hagrid to leave first. The groundskeeper made it partially to the door before turning with a cough.
“I’m not asking you to pledge your loyalty,” said Blaise. “I’m asking you to help, at least while you can. Merlin knows Harry has trouble helping himself.”
“Hadrian,” she said, eyes concerned, “They won’t announce this until tomorrow, but I thought you deserved to know first. From what I hear, it affects you pretty directly.”
Which, for Harry and Draco, included their first ever Quidditch match. Which they absolutely weren’t scared about.
“Shall we head out?” Tracey interrupted, before Blaise could escalate the situation. “We’ll want to get our supplies quickly.”
“Guess not,” said Harry, rather more preoccupied with the fact that he had now been rescued by centaurs twice, and was now staring up at said herd of centaurs who for some reason had saved him and his best friend from nearly being murdered by Acromantula, and it really was quite different looking up at one centaur compared with looking up at twenty or more.
“It feels like we’re having this conversation all the time, you know,” Tracey commented. “You’d think this would be something you could learn from – not walking into danger and all.”
as soon as he heard the name – the Minister of Magic had had many features in Harry’s time at Hogwarts.
Lockhart attempted his gigawatt smile, though it fell short somewhere in the realm of sickly. “Very well then,” he said, trying to regain his suavity. “I’ll – I’ll just be in my office, er, getting- getting ready.” He fled the scene.
“Harry!” Draco launched into a hug. “Merlin, you had me worried sick. Are you okay? What happened? Where were you? Where’s-”
And then there were warm arms around his shoulders and Harry was being hugged for the first real time in his life, and he turned his head to meet the anxious grey eyes of Draco Malfoy.
Harry nodded, and looked up, locking eyes with each of his friends one by one. “Listen, guys, if anything happens down there…”
“Pansy’s right,” Draco nodded. “You can’t talk to her. She’s a mudblood, and Slytherins don’t associate with mudbloods.”
Harry flashed her the most genuine smile he could manage and left the bathroom as quickly as he could.
Draco paused. “Come back to me. Us. I- I meant us.” He swore under his breath. “Just- come back, okay, idiot?”
“It doesn’t matter for right now who it is,” Harry said. “What matters is that they’re stopped. Hermione’s right – we should go to Dumbledore. If he doesn’t listen, then at least we tried, and we can think of something else.”
Side note: y'all ever find it kinda messed up that Harry and Ron full on could have murdered Lockhart? Like, when they pushed him down the hole into the Chamber? I'd never really thought about it until I wrote this chapter but.... god damn.
“Right now, in fact,” Gemma said, nodding in respect to their Head of House as he entered the Hospital Wing.
To Harry’s great surprise, it wasn’t Draco or Blaise or any of his other friends waiting by his bedside; it was Ginny Weasley. She must have been watching him sleep – which he felt slightly uncomfortable about – because the second his eyes met hers Ginny was on her feet and babbling at a thousand miles an hour.
Harry was dredged from his reminiscing by an insistent tap at the window. The sight that greeted him in the dawn light had Harry out of bed in a heartbeat, snatching up his glasses and fumbling with the latch in his rush to yank the window open.
Adrian immediately looked far more interested in the Malfoy heir than he had previously, and nodded. “I expect to see you there, too, then.”
Harry couldn’t stop the eye roll this time. “You’re delusional if you think I did this for you,” he replied, and left without so much as a ‘goodbye’.
He thought he closed his eyes but it was too dark to tell. Where was the light? Uncle Vernon was coming. The world was black and he was drowning and then-
“Ladies and gentlemen!” Lockhart continued, oblivious to Harry’s panic. “What an extraordinary moment this is! When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography,
Harry was rather confused. He had gotten the impression that Draco didn’t think very much of him, regardless of his status as the Boy Who Lived – but now he wanted to be friends? Harry himself didn’t particularly want to be friends with a boy who seemed so stuck-up, but he didn’t want to be enemies with him either, and Harry got the impression that Draco Malfoy would take a rejection of friendship as a sign of war.
Harry looked up warily. He had met this boy in Diagon Alley, in Madam Malkin’s robes shop, and he had reminded him an awful lot of his cousin Dudley.
“But if they were really trying to hide something, they wouldn’t rely on a spell a thirteen year old would know,” Hermione pointed out.
The Great Hall that night was one of the most beautiful things Harry had ever seen. Floating Jack-o-Lanterns hovered above the House tables, and tiny black bats flapped their way between students and teachers alike. The charmed ceiling portrayed a clear black sky filled with tiny glittering stars. The ghosts were particularly active as well (due to the excess magical energy charging the world on Samhain, Tracey informed him matter-of-factly), and their usual silvery glow seemed shining against the warm light of the hundreds of suspended candles. Even Peeves, the Hogwarts poltergeist, was on his best behaviour for the evening (though from the way his translucent fingers were twitching, Harry guessed that wouldn’t last long). All in all, Hogwarts on Halloween stole Harry’s breath away. Not for the first time, he marvelled at the feeling of being home.
Snape’s upper lip curled into a snarl, but he wasn’t done. “What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?”
“Oi,” Harry interrupted. The girls looked at him, both irritated. He ignored their expressions in favour of pointing ahead. “What’s that?”
“Harry! And… Malfoy? What are you two doing here?” Hagrid lowered the crossbow. “There’s a curfew on, isn’t there?”
There was still the detention to worry about, but even that didn’t seem so bad when the caretaker, Filch, told them that they would be serving their detention with Hagrid, not Snape.
The creature crashed into the decorative snakes either side of the pathway as Harry sprinted to one side of it, sending massive crashing bits of stone down around him. Spying an alcove ahead through his smudged glasses, Harry aimed straight for it and ducked inside. Within were more tunnels – sewage pipes, some corner of his mind realised - and Harry picked one at random, whirling around corner after corner until he found a tucked away grate and crawled up against it, holding one hand over his mouth to stop his panting breath.
“Oh – how very sweet,” she murmured, smiling. “Well, Miss Greengrass, I trust you’ll keep this lot out of trouble. Just for a wee moment, alright? I’ll be back in a jiffy.”
Harry flushed. Admittedly, he hadn’t really been thinking when he chose to, quite literally, dive into the diary.
Pansy and Daphne shared the opinion that flying and Quidditch were really only of interest when the older boys were playing (preferably in the rain, Pansy added, with a dreamy look in her eyes), while Tracey was scared of heights and Theo had no interest in sports of any kind. When asked, Blaise explained with a shrug that he thought it no more fun than their other classes, and Vince and Greg – well, they were more interested in going to lunch than going to class.
Harry studied the two professors as they walked, Neville a ball of anxious silence fidgeting at his side. With each part of the professors’ demeanour catalogued in his mind (Snape’s tenseness and lack of scornful looks, Flitwick’s uncharacteristic silence and bowed shoulders), the ball in the pit of Harry’s stomach got denser. Something was wrong, that much was clear. Whatever it was damaged both Ravenclaw and Slytherin, and was bad enough to have Snape of all people feeling on edge.
Narcissa considered him carefully. “We must retrieve your school supplies, Hadrian, not to mention your wand.”
A tall boy, older than Harry, peered around a corner at the end of the corridor. He was lean and pale, with dark hair perfectly arranged atop his head. Harry approached him quietly.
Once they had a little more privacy – though the charm was not revoked – she relaxed slightly and turned to Harry.
“We learned last year that the Dark Lord returned,” said Blaise Zabini, with a gravitas far too intense for one of his age. That sort of intensity was not to be unexpected, when one’s mother was known far and wide as the Black Widow. “And that he is trying to kill Harry.”
, and Harry realised with a start that around him sat the portraits of every past Headmaster Hogwarts had ever had.
The crowd watched with baited breath as the two professors faced each other, bowing (though Harry noted that Snape kept his eyes high). They walked slowly to their designated positions, ten paces from the other, and spun, wands raised in preparation.
“What’s going on, P-professor?” Neville stammered (unsurprisingly looking only to Professor Flitwick with his question).
The House Elf leaned forward. “Dobby has to protect Mr Potter. To warn him. Mr Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.”
Harry looked down to where Hagrid’s dog was whining and dragging his paws behind Draco. Fang looked even more scared than the boys did.
Draco stepped in front of Harry’s eye-line. “Now hang on just a second. I never agreed to bringing a-” he paused to sneer, “-
The morning of the trial of Lucius Malfoy was sombre. The splendour of Malfoy Manor lay quiet – within, the only noise came from the putter of house elves, the discontented murmur of enchanted portraits, and the hushed voices of two young wizards.
“What we should do is leave before someone sees us,” Blaise said firmly. “Most of the school already hates Slytherins, and with the Chamber of Secrets involved we can’t be seen here. Come on.”
, but Harry didn’t stop, he raised it and slammed it down again and again and again and again and again-
“Plus, she’s a cat,” Blaise said. “For statements so murderous you’d expect it to have gone after a human.”
“My dear man,” Lucius smiled cruelly, faux politeness and smarm. “Please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your – well, do you call this a house? I simply called at the school and was told the headmaster was here.”
Harry was beginning to formulate a snarky response in his mind, but was unfortunately cut off by a grating, scraping, rasping sound that could only barely be called a voice saying:
had he done that? He’d never done anything like that before, not really, and Harry suddenly felt very small, looking at what his magic had done.
Narcissa’s mask, however, didn’t faulter. “Yet Harry is like one of my own. I’m sure you feel something similar for the charges that pass through the halls of Hogwarts, Headmaster – unless, of course, you are busy with your other duties on the Wizengamot. Your priorities, there at least, are quite clear.”
Ecklehurt swore loudly. Harry supposed she was betting that Flint would hate his Muggleborn mother more than the way she had humiliated Flint the previous year. Harry had been betting on that too, if he was honest. Apparently, they had both bet wrong.
“Exactly!” Harry replied enthusiastically. “Aragog even hinted at it – he said the girl fifty years ago was killed in a bathroom.”
biased towards Slytherin). Overall, he thought they all sounded like fine places. Harry liked the thought of being loyal like a Hufflepuff, courageous like a Gryffindor, witty like a Ravenclaw, and cunning like a Slytherin – he wanted to be all of them at once.
Harry found Neville Longbottom first thing the morning after Halloween. Draco was with him – true to Harry’s predictions, Draco had refused to let him go anywhere alone after the previous night’s fiasco – but Harry had made him promise to keep quiet while he spoke to the Gryffindor boy.
He eyed up the Gryffindor Seeker warily. She was a third year Harry had been told was called Trinity Teakel. She didn’t look like much, but then again – neither did Harry.
The rest of the Sorting was mostly uneventful. Harry didn’t recognise any other new students, bar one.
“How about this: you and I visit your relatives. Draco will stay behind – I believe we saw Theodore in Diagon Alley earlier, so they may stay here under the… meagre supervision of the barkeep while you and I retrieve your supplies.”
“H-Hey, Harry!” Neville gave him a smile. Harry chose to ignore the way the Gryffindor’s eyes flickered nervously behind him to Draco’s sullen form.
Draco began to shake at Harry’s side. Fang whimpered louder as the moss began to detach from the tree trunks, curling outwards like sets of long, dark legs.
Uncle Vernon was furious. The Masons had told him very coldly that they would “get back to him” on his big deal after seeing a letter-burdened owl leave his house, and very quickly driven away. Harry, of course, got the brunt of his rage, but it seemed Vernon didn’t want to just leave it at violence this time. That very day, Harry’s bedroom gained three new adornments: large iron bars on the outside of his window; a small metal flap on the base of his door; and a thick grey lock to the door itself. The door snapped shut like a cell door when Vernon was done. Harry sat on the floor and tried not to panic. He would be fine, rationally, he knew that. His friends would find him, would help him. But the shadowed bedroom suddenly seemed very small, like the walls were closing in, like the world was going dark and he was back in his cupboard again, hunched over and scared-
George lifted both hands, moving them like scales as he considered. “Life debt, pest control – yeah, that’s about even.”
“Calm yourself, Hagrid,” Dumbledore commanded, and Hagrid quietened at once. The obedience would have worried Harry if he hadn’t been carefully splitting his attention between the scene in front of him and his best friend. “If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside. However, you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”
There was a large mirror in the room, with a muddled engraving on the high arch – but it wasn’t the engraving Harry was distracted by.
Lockhart surveyed the class with a gleam in his eye and, seeing them all suitably on edge, whipped the cloth covering the cage to one side, revealing-
“You two will be in charge of making sure Mr. Potter here gets his luggage on the train and such,” McGonagall said. “I must be getting to Hogwarts.”
“Some taken on his behalf, Malfoy,” Hermione cut in disapprovingly, while Neville shifted awkwardly at her side.
that whatever catastrophe you’ve gotten yourself into that time is too important to wait, then we are all going.
normal, as Dudley Dursley’s birthday came only once a year as it did for everybody else, but neither was it
Although, judging by Fang’s whimpers and Draco’s heavy breathing into the dark, Harry wasn’t the only one feeling more than a bit unnerved.
“One more thing, though I doubt I need tell many of you this: should the culprit behind these attacks remain at large, the school will close. Notify your parents if they are unaware.” With a swirl of his cloak, Snape was gone.
Five minutes later, nothing had happened, and Harry was getting impatient. He might have given up had he not had the idea that perhaps he must be more specific, and so rather than focusing on light, he instead focused on the idea of a candle.
Weasley hesitated. “And how do you even know where the Chamber of Secrets is, if you aren’t the Heir of Slytherin?”
(The last time he had been side-along apparated, Harry had recalled through the daze, had been with Narcissa, to that very same street. Maybe it was just because Narcissa had been such a comforting presence, but he hadn’t felt so nauseous when it was with her.)
“Well, she’s a total know-it-all,” Millicent commented from the floor, where she was petting her cat, Sabre.
“I’ll talk to Professor McGonagall,” Hermione said firmly. “She’s the deputy headmistress – she can get us to see Dumbledore.”
“But Harry killed him,” Hermione Granger interrupted. A witch of outstanding talent and passion for learning, she was at a distinct advantage in this room, because she was the only one with the often underrated Muggleborn point of view. “And the Philosopher’s Stone is destroyed.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Daphne gave her signature million watt smile, and Madam Pomfrey wandered out of the room with an air of delight.
Ultimately, Harry’s exhausted brain decided it didn’t matter, because he couldn’t quite stop the rush of fatigue pushing his eyelids down. He couldn’t remember why he’d been fighting it, so he didn’t. His eyes closed against the strange visions above him, and he surrendered to the darkness.
Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible, and eventually the three made their way back to the ground. Harry got off of his broom with slightly shaky legs and a wide grin.
’s Bestseller List – he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works – free of charge!”
“How comforting,” said Harry. He refused to lower his voice. The Forest was far from silent around them, creaking and shuffling as if alive, and speaking quietly seemed only to serve to emphasise those unsettling sounds. “And we’ve already met a centaur – Firenze, remember? He was… nice.”
Harry twirled his wand through his fingers nervously, before settling on gripping it tight. It did little to ease his anxiety, but he thought it was probably fair enough to be terrified when walking towards the home of a massive, people-eating snake that could kill you with a glance.
While in the Hospital Wing the Malfoy heir was grappling with a decision that would have waves of influence upon the years to come, far down below, in an abandoned classroom not far from the entrance to the Slytherin dungeons, guarded with the best privacy charms a group of second years could know, an equally important decision was being made. A group of students who had just the right amount of love for their friend combined with just the right variety of dangerous and political upbringings were having a meeting.
Hermione did not look at all pleased to be referred to simply as ‘Harry’s friend’, and was opening her mouth to say so, when the most unlikely of saviours came upon them.
Dumbledore seemed pleased he’d asked. “Fawkes is a magnificent creature, Harry. As you have discovered, one of the many talents of phoenixes is that their tears may heal any ailment; another, is their sense of intuition. Quite possibly, Fawkes was simply drawn to the cry of your magic from within the Chamber – and, remembering you as a student of mine from that day in my office, flew to your aid.”
Fred and George were hovering over Ginny in Harry’s peripheral vision, casting spell after spell on first her, then the diary. Tom didn’t seem concerned.
The group turned to look at the twins, who were, for the first time Harry had ever seen, remarkably solemn.
He channelled all of the tight, red-hot anger in his chest into the spell, but even he was surprised when the jet of light hit Lockhart right in the solar plexus and threw him, at speed, across the room. His wand clattered to the floor, harmless.
goodbye.” He jumped forward, uncrossing his arms to latch them around Harry’s neck. “If you die, I swear to Merlin himself I will bring you back just to kill you again!”
“Shouldn’t you be with your prefects?” Harry asked. His voice sounded absurdly relaxed to his own ears. Perhaps he was getting better at his mask after all.
He sped away, executing a series of the most advanced rolls, zig-zags, and loops to shake off the Bludger as he knew, but nothing worked. The manoeuvres brought him towards Teakel, who was watching in vague concern. She didn’t seem to know whether to be glad Harry was occupied and therefore couldn’t be looking for the Snitch, or worried about his safety from the Bludger. Harry didn’t spend much time staring at her expression however, because hovering right behind her ear was the Golden Snitch.
“I’m sure you can, Harry,” Narcissa assured him calmly. “The point is that you do not have to handle it alone.”
“Oh, brilliant!” Hermione beamed at the note in her hand, found on the table of the sixth room along with seven bottles of varying shapes and sizes. “This isn’t magic – it’s logic – a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever. See here – we’ve been given clues.”
“How are your holidays going?” Harry asked, and Draco launched into a lengthy explanation of everything his mother and father had given him, where they had gone, and the details of everything he had done. Harry listened, and his smile remained genuine on his face the whole time.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked when they were out in the cool night air and Draco’s face next to his remained a glaring shade of red.
His thoughts were cut off by an awful hissing behind him – Harry staggered away from it, but there was nowhere to run. The basilisk darted towards in him. His legs were aching from running and though he held his wand in one hand, it was useless now-
Harry politely told her that yes, that would be very agreeable, but inside his mind he was jumping about in celebration. There was a whole world out there – a world full of people just like him. The Dursleys were wrong; Harry wasn’t a freak. He was a wizard, and he had so much to learn!
considered Snape, but still. He didn’t appreciate being fooled so easily. “So it was you the whole time, then? What about Halloween?”
Dudley frowned. “I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he’d turn us into dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard.”
Harry changed directions to head for the Ravenclaw table, and frowned at what he saw. Hermione Granger was sitting on the far edge of the long benches, back to the wall and as close to the Head Table as she could get. Surrounding her was a conspicuous emptiness about three people wide. Harry filed the image away to investigate later as he approached the table.
Hermione looked slightly nervous again as they came to a stop. Harry opened his mouth to say good night, but was cut off.
Obviously there is (are? I'm too tired to know) a large selection of lines taken directly from the movie in this chapter - Quirrell and Snape's conversation, for example, and Dumbledore's speech about the Mirror. Once again, please don't sue me; I'm broke.
The flying instructor, Madam Hooch, seemed a bit stern but overall simply passionate about Quidditch. Harry wished she’d move a bit faster, though. He raised his broom with a simple “up” on the first go, and waiting around for everyone else (with the exclusion of Draco, a few Gryffindors, and, surprisingly, Pansy) was not helping his impatience.
“I want to be a Seeker too one day! Headmaster Dumbledore says I can’t change houses but I can for sure sign up for the Quidditch team!”
“There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class,” Snape’s voice echoed around the room as he strode to the front of the class. “As such, I don’t expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science of potion making. However, for those of you who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses; I can tell you how to brew glory, bottle fame, and even put a stopper in death.” His eyes locked with Harry’s.
thought Harry, but he kept it to himself. Instead, he gripped his wand tighter in his hand, cast a quick
“Especially after last year, everything that happened because of- because of what he did, and I just-” Draco’s voice began to waver, and Harry stood immediately to wrap his arms around his friend. Quieter, Draco said, “I just want Mother to be happy again. What if she’s just doing this for me?”
Blaise looked Harry and Draco over properly once they were gone, dark, judging eyes flicking between the two of them.
Tom smiled again, a mockery of comfort. “It won’t come until it’s called. And I’m afraid I can’t let you take her.”
Lockhart scoffed. “Pranks? No, they’ve been attacking me! I tried to get Dumbledore to listen, but no, the old man wouldn’t pay attention to me – I mean really, hasn’t he read my books? If he’d listened to me he would still be here, that’s for certain-”
Sometimes, lying in the dark at night, Harry thought he had imagined the whole thing. Hogwarts, his friends, Voldemort – all of it, just a dream.
Despite his burning curiosity, Harry opened the letter from Draco first. He snorted at the opening lines.
Harry shook his head. There was an anger running beneath his skin that was foreign and fierce, and he did not want to hold it back. Not while the man who had taken his mother and father from him stood just feet away.
“Alright, so how do we open it?” asked Draco, tugging Harry (and consequently, Lockhart) a little further from where Moaning Myrtle was floating, watching the group curiously.
There was less tact used when it came to Hermione, of course, but Harry and Gemma shut it down where they could. He had never been so grateful to have a senior in his corner.
“Players, practices will be posted in the Common Room. The rest of you, stay out of the way during practice. I won’t have you distracting my team. Now, get lost. Malfoy, stay behind.”
Flint snorted, but thankfully moved on, and soon enough it was time to set up. Harry noted that the opposite team contained not just Draco as a prospective Chaser, but also the two pre-existing Chasers – Flint and Adrian, rather than any of the other new students. As a Seeker, he ordinarily wouldn’t be interacting with the opposite Chasers very much, but still. He doubted it was an accident. Flint’s dislike of Muggleborns and Half-bloods was common knowledge.
“For a short stretch only – not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution,” Fudge placated. “If someone else is caught, you’ll be released with a full apology.”
Eventually Draco had to go, however, and Harry carefully put the mirror away. That was when he noticed it – one last present. He picked it up curiously, turning it this way and that, but it had no name tag. The only note had but three words on it –
Harry would have thought so too, only Ron was loitering around the end of Harry’s bed, not his siblings’, when the medi-witch left the room once more in search of more pain relieving potion for a very loudly complaining Weasley twin.
“Ah,” Dumbledore sat up straighter, his smile widening. “You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone – find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That was one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me, that’s saying something.” He let out a chuckle.
“They’re just fine, Hadrian, just fine indeed,” Dumbledore reassured him. The twinkle had returned full force. “And of course, what happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret – so naturally, the whole school knows.”
It took very little time in the Forbidden Forest for Harry to start regretting his boldness in stepping into it. The Forest was pitch black outside the tiny circle of light from the lantern, and the further they walked the closer the trees seemed to get, denser and damper and more depressing with each fumbled step through the brush. The Forest felt like it was suffocating them, shadowy figures behind every branch, and Harry was increasingly glad he was not alone.
“We were waiting for him to leave,” Daphne told him in a conspiratorial whisper, perching elegantly on a cleared out spot on his bedside table. “Everyone knows he hates us Slytherins.”
“Why don’t you back off before you get hurt, Weasley?” Daphne suggested with a sickly sweet smile. “I’m sure Madam Pomfrey doesn’t want to see two little Gryffindors in one day.”
Every now and then he would glance over at Draco, who was doing fantastically for his first time as Keeper. Harry admired the speed of his friend’s movements as he deftly blocked the Gryffindor offence from scoring. The blond may have liked to say Harry was born to be on a broom, but by the looks of things, so was Draco.
Draco didn’t stop glaring at him. “What if you get yourself hurt? Or expelled, or killed? And I’m not there?”
“We don’t know,” said Hermione. “But it’s something to do with a Nicholas Flamel. And the problem is I
The sight awaiting him below Salazar’s statue froze Harry’s heart in his chest. One of the twins was clutching at an arm, hanging useless and bleeding by their side, and the other was on one knee, clutching his stomach. Even at sixteen, Lord Voldemort was viciously powerful, and this one couldn’t be hurt.
Harry stared at him. “It was trying to kill me, sir. I wasn’t really worrying about how it died – it was it or me.”
Draco extended a hand, and Blaise clasped it in his own. They shook solemnly, and separated for sleep.
With a flash of blinding light, the Slytherin Common Room was empty – all that remained was spilled ink, and a small black diary.
Despite Harry’s buried concerns, the trio made it out of the castle, into the broom shed, and then into the air without any troubles.
“You do know there’s a monster on the loose, right?” Millicent asked from where she had been staring at them in incredulous anger since they got back, her equally ill-tempered cat Sabre clutched tight to her chest. “Going to the groundskeeper’s hut after curfew is one thing, but going into the
“That arrogant prick was freaking Harry out!” Millicent snapped back. “What did you expect me to do? Leave him there?”
Harry hesitated. “Never mind. I think I must just be getting tired – you know, I’d better be off to bed, Professor.” He stood quickly.
Tom Riddle came to a stop outside an innocuous room in the dungeons. The door was opened slightly, and a voice carried through:
“How’s it going, Hadrian,” said one twin. Harry thought it was probably George – there were tiny differences, he was certain – but he couldn’t quite differentiate the two, particularly not in the dim torchlight of the corridor.
He sprinted away, chasing the voice through empty corridors and up a staircase, taking the steps three at a time before he skidded to a stop when he saw it.
“The Weasley twins have been pranking you?” Harry asked, shaking his head in an attempt to clear his confusion. The mess in the room and Lockhart’s rant and the worry about Ginny still in the back of his head – he felt rather like he was running ten steps behind.
“You named a dangerous creature… Norbert?” Hermione asked. Her face was only a few shades paler than Neville’s.
Harry was very suspicious by now, and opened his mouth to tell Hagrid that he couldn’t possibly promise to keep a secret when he didn’t know what that secret was, but Neville and Hermione were nodding on either side of him and Hagrid was ushering them inside and Harry only had a few seconds to think that he’d never promised a thing before-
A break was in order, he decided. Maybe he could pen a letter to Hermione, asking how she dealt with the eye strain of reading considering how often her head was in a book. The thought of squinting at yet another piece of paper made him wince, but at least it wouldn’t be so crowded with tiny lettering. Sighing again, dramatically, Harry dropped his head back to the book, ready to close it and try again later.
Harry nodded. Only a few weeks and then they would be at Hogwarts again – but what about the summer after that? He thought he had been free – had gotten too optimistic, to believe himself rid of the Dursleys for good. This, the Headmaster’s interference, was a harsh clap back to reality.
Squinting into the dark, Harry leveraged himself up on the lumpy mattress and cast an arm out for his glasses. The mahogany bedside table should be to his right, with his wand and his glasses and the cup of cold water that Dilly always refilled during the night-
“He’ll try to kill me,” Harry nodded. “Yeah. Apparently he was pretty keen on trying that last night.”
“I’ll write as often as possible,” Draco promised on the last day of school, before hugging Harry fiercely.
“Speaking of, we should probably head to bed,” Tracey advised. “We don’t want to be overtired tomorrow.”
– not at the basilisk bearing down upon him, but at Salazar’s statue. The stone exploded into massive raining pieces and Harry aimed at one such slab, opening his mouth to cast again-
“There is a plot,” Dobby continued in a fierce whisper. “A plot to make most terrible things happen. If Mr Potter goes back to school he will be in great danger.”
Something cold and wet washed over the steadily bleeding wound on his arm, and Harry sucked in a breath as something cooled the burning in his veins. The strange sensation flowed through him, soothing over where the burning venom had rocketed through his body. It was a welcome relief. When the cold reached his head, Harry had to beat back a wave of exhaustion as the pain subsided, and he forced his vision to focus. There were more faces over him then there should have been, he realised, and the red and orange perched on his chest arranged itself, slowly, into the shape of a phoenix.
Harry’s heart dropped when he saw the trapdoor – hidden rather fully beneath one of the Cerberus’ giant paws. The claws alone were the size of Harry’s arm.
It wasn’t until he saw the little black diary, sitting innocently on the desk, that the full reality of what he’d just seen hit him. Harry promptly sat back down on the floor.
“I knew you’d understand sir,” Blaise added in, stepping up besides Draco with a smirk. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, Harry needs to get to the Hospital Wing.”
For a long moment, the two boys stood opposite each other in the dorm, considering each other in the candlelight.
“If you wait out here, Lady Malfoy, I can get my things from inside,” Harry suggested. It was an optimistic thought (Uncle Vernon was unlikely to allow him to do any such thing), but standing at the doorway of the only place before Hogwarts he could ever have called home, Harry found himself desperate to keep Narcissa from going inside. The Dursleys were his secret. They were his shame to bear. Someone like Narcissa Malfoy did not belong in Number 4, Privet Drive.
He didn’t rush to go downstairs. The one improvement on his life with the Dursleys was that Narcissa’s visit the previous year had stuck vividly in his aunt’s mind, and with that plus Harry’s own wand still on his person, Vernon and Petunia seemed (begrudgingly) willing to leave him alone. No more making breakfast and receiving only scraps, no more of Vernon’s heavy fists, no more working all day cleaning and gardening only for Petunia to berate him for a missed square inch. He was trapped in this place, but he wasn’t weak. Not anymore. His friends had taught him that.
“They were found near the library,” Madam Pomfrey told them, gentler than Harry had ever seen her. “Once the Mandrakes are grown I can revive them, along with the rest of the Petrified, but in the meantime – they were found with this.” She showed them a small hand-held mirror. “Is this familiar to either of you boys?”
“Come, Mr Potter,” Madam Pomfrey brought his attention back to her – and, more importantly, the slightly bitter smelling potion in her hand. “This will make you feel much better.”
“Oh,” Hagrid’s whole body relaxed. “Well, they are. Did y’know, you play a bi’ of music to one, they go righ’ to sleep? Really swee’ lil’ things.”
“You weren’t even watching him,” Millicent pointed out scornfully. “You were watching Damien Derrick the whole time, it was painfully obvious.”
These thoughts, and ones like them, were the main cause of Harry’s intense relief that the Sorting Hat had elected to place him in Slytherin, not Gryffindor. At least in Slytherin, fraternity was a key trait – rather than the shallow act of chivalry Harry had observed of Gryffindors like Ronald Weasley. Gryffindors liked to
“Honestly, what is he thinking?” Draco complained. “Sending two first year students off on their own into the woods. Deadly woods, no less. My father will hear about this.”
Draco pointed. Harry stared. Flourish and Blotts stood ahead of them, but Harry couldn’t even see the store beyond the huge crowd of people packed in and against it. A tall sign resting precariously on top of the store read:
with Cornish pixies?” Draco replied sarcastically. He picked at his robes, annoyed. “That bloody incompetent fool.”
Lucius’ smile spread. His teeth flashed, predator-like; triumphant. “Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” he drawled, so like Draco’s own cocky inflection but so much worse. “But the governors feel it’s time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension.” He passed a scroll to Fudge with one gloved hand. “You’ll find all twelve signatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’re losing your touch. What with all these attacks, there’ll be no Muggleborns left at Hogwarts. And we all know what an awful loss that would be.”
Harry wasn’t wrong. The moment he arrived in Snape’s classroom after dinner that night, the Professor was looming over him with harsh words and an intimidating presence.
“Sounds like the perfect guy to take care of a huge and vicious three-headed dog,” Blaise grinned. “Big enough to handle it, dim enough to want to go near it, and irrelevant enough that it’s no big loss to the faculty if he gets injured or killed in the line of duty.”
Harry glanced to his left and was met with three familiar sets of eyes. Draco was leaning forward, anxiety written clearly over his features; flanking him, to Harry’s surprise, were Blaise Zabini and Gemma Farley.
he had heard a voice, and it’s not like he could trust Lockhart to have heard anything over the sound of his own arrogant rambling.
Blaise leapt onto the duelling stand, raising Harry’s limp hand in a show of victory. He said something to the crowd Harry couldn’t process, before tugging him off the stage and out of the room.
Millicent looked up with hard eyes. “I’m not a blood traitor. I’m just saying Hadrian has a point about the idiots. Granger may be a know-it-all, but we’re only three days into the year and she’s already pulling ahead as top of the class. That’s not the mark of someone who’s less powerful than the rest of us.”
Narcissa’s façade softened just slightly at the approach of her son, and warmth melted the icy blue of her eyes. “Are you alright, my darling?”
Harry’s mind raced. He had to help Hermione. She was one of his closest friends; he wasn’t just going to leave her. But the prefects were already leaving the Great Hall, and the teachers were rushing out as well. Who could he ask?
Harry heard Tracey’s murmured, “You guys really shouldn’t tease him like that”, before they left earshot.
Harry shook his head. He didn’t really want to deal with Hagrid right now. “It’s nothing, just stress. Speaking of, I’d better get back to studying, so…”
“Oh,” said Harry. He glanced back at Aragog, nerves returning as curiosity abated and reality set in. “Well, thank you. We’ll… We’ll just be going now.”
Blank ink spurted from the pages like blood. Distantly, Harry thought Tom might’ve been shrieking, but the burning had progressed from his arm into the rest of his body now, and below his elbow, the skin around the basilisk bite had gone grey and numb.
Harry stepped up to Draco’s side, Blaise moving next to Harry and the other Slytherins falling in line.
“At least I can move between classes without being blinded by that damn camera,” Harry murmured, poking at his eggs, before freezing. “Sorry. That was insensitive.” He frowned. “Don’t tell Hermione I said that.”
Flitwick sighed, his already small form getting smaller. “It’s best you see for yourself, Mr Longbottom.”
It took Harry a little under seven minutes to repack and organise his things. Narcissa cast a featherweight charm on his trunk for him, so he could barely feel the many books and supplies held within. He took so little time, in fact, that when he made his way back to the living room, Narcissa and his Aunt Petunia were still talking.
Harry grinned. “Blaise, Draco, Pansy and I will see what’s going on. We’ll meet you guys back at the Common Room in a sec, okay?”
. He was a freak – that was all he knew. It was all he had been told since being dropped on the doorstep of Number 4.
Pansy shook her head. “Hang on, but Basilisks are huge! Surely someone would have noticed a giant snake roaming the castle? How’s it getting around?”
Lucius’ lawyer was good; deft with her words and charming in a way Harry could only describe as ‘slimy’, she succeeded in refuting the need for the use of veritaserum upon her client. It wasn’t enough, however – when the time came for the vote, Lucius Malfoy was found guilty at two-thirds majority, and with a snarl he couldn’t quite conceal on his face, the Malfoy patriarch was led from the courtroom.
light, pupils lost in the colour yet her gaze was unmistakeable. “You would be wise to leave this forest, wizards. We will escort you and your mutt this once, as a kindness to Hagrid since you claim to know him. But beware when you seek to enter these woods again – our kindness extends no further than this night.”
“Oh!” Longbottom’s eyes widened even further. Harry wondered if it was possible for them to pop right out of his skull. “Thank you!”
. He found Narcissa again, and carefully followed her line to- a scorch mark. Harry furrowed his brow. So Sirius Black had been disowned sometime in the decade before Harry was born – but why?
The letters glittered and moved over the surface of the cake, clearly enchanted, until the message was muddled and misspelled. Harry thought it was the most amazing thing he’d ever seen.
“A monstrous creature.” The centaur turned its head to the dead unicorn, mourning its passing with a bow. “It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death – but at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A
Harry let himself get caught up in Draco’s enthusiasm, putting his textbook down. It was a fine day. Even with the tenseness still apparent between Daphne, Pansy, and Harry (because Daphne refused to apologise for insulting Hermione, Pansy refused to leave her best friend’s side, and Harry refused to back down until Hermione got her apology) – Draco was happy, the Common Room was warm, and Harry felt calm.
Petunia opened and closed her mouth several times, but finally seemed to give up on finding a way out of the situation. She took the letter from Harry’s hand with carefully pinched forefinger and thumb, holding it between her nails like it was about to explode. Harry stayed where he was.
Another flick, and the letters danced into new positions rearranging to spell what was surely the worst-case scenario:
Aunt Petunia froze in the kitchen where she was adding the finishing touches to a large, red cake. She only moved again when she noticed Dudley extending his own thick fingers to the pudding.
Neville immediately perked up a little, though his face was still ghostly pale. Hermione took a small step closer to him.
Harry stood, collecting his books and waving off the concerned looks his two friends shot him with a small smile. The quiet of the library seemed suddenly stifling. For tonight, at least, he’d rather be alone. Ginevra Weasley glanced up at him as he passed, staring for a moment, before she turned back to her book. She looked tired, Harry noted – but then again, so did he.
Tom seemed to misinterpret the expression, because he laughed again. “Come now, Harry, don’t look so disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded in destroying the diary, she would have destroyed me – and then we couldn’t be having this little chat!” He bared his teeth in what might have been, in another lifetime, a charming smile. “I have so many questions for you.”
With both Tracey and Dilly rushing them along like a pair of mother hens, the shopping for school supplies took surprisingly little time. Before Harry knew it, all they had left was-
” – Madam Pomfrey finally magicked open Harry’s bedside curtain, and relinquished her iron grip on the apparent queue waiting outside the Hospital Wing door.
he thought fiercely. He blinked, hard, until his eyes were dry again, and then released a long, shaky breath.
The first thing Harry thought he really wanted was light. It was very dark in his cupboard, as the light bulb had blown several days earlier and Vernon had not wanted to fix it. So, Harry closed his eyes, and concentrated on wanting light.
Harry sighed. “Look. If Voldemort is through there, what difference is it going to make if there’s one of us or five? We’re first years. We can’t beat a Dark Lord. But one of us needs to go through, and he killed my parents. He tried to kill me. This needs to be finished, one way or another.”
Harry blinked at the display, but it appeared that this was not out of place, as Professor McGonagall simply continued:
“Something funny, Potter?” he asked. Harry assumed it was meant to be menacing. “I guess the rumours are true. You are going dark. You don’t even care about your parents, do you? Suppose you should be thankful they’re not alive to be disappointed in you, huh?”
Harry conceded this point eventually, but threw himself back into the Cerberus investigation to let off the excess steam – and of course, dragged Hermione, Neville, Draco, and Blaise right along with him.
Dumbledore hadn’t even gone up to the door. A quick, encouraging pat to Harry’s shoulder, he had wished Harry farewell and simply watched him approach the house. Harry wanted to scream at him. He wanted to kick and punch and drag the Headmaster into Number 4 so he could see exactly why Harry couldn’t stay in that awful place. And yet, even as the rage built in his blood and the drooping tulips on the lawn began to shake, the cooling suspicion washed over him that Dumbledore already knew. Perhaps not the extent of what went on behind the pristine suburban façade of the Dursley home, but he had spoken to Petunia at least once. He had to know that the Dursleys did not want Harry – had never wanted him, and had made that perfectly clear in Harry’s lifetime. Maybe, Harry had thought with hatred ashen in his mouth, Dumbledore just didn’t care.
Harry was getting pretty sick of waking up in the Hospital Wing. Then he remembered that he shouldn’t have been waking up at all, and he felt rather like that was the least of his worries. Summoning his sapped strength, he tilted his aching head, very slowly and carefully, to one side.
There was another hand on his arm and he was being tugged, away from Lockhart, away from the crowd, until he looked up and the sun was shining and he realised he was no longer inside.
Harry found himself laughing, and promptly regretted it as his ribs gave an unhappy throb. “Yes,” he told them honestly. “Aren’t those curtains supposed to have privacy charms on them?”
“So, Hadrian,” Millicent interrupted before Harry could ask anything, flopping across his legs. “We heard you killed Professor Quirrell.”
“Didn’t you say that Slytherin third year – Pucey – was raving about your Quidditch skills as a Seeker all holidays?” She pointed at the broom hovering a few feet away. “You have to get on that, and seek out the right key for the next door. It’s obvious.”
The door to one of the stalls opened and Hermione stepped out, wiping at her eyes. Her face was red and blotchy, and Harry realised with a start that she had been crying.
Harry remembered everything, and so it was with crystal clarity that he recalled the events of his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry: being Sorted into Slytherin; the Great Hall sparkling with light; the troll at Halloween; the Cerberus on the third floor; the parasitic remains of Voldemort crumbling with Quirrell under his bare hands; and of course, his friends. Draco, Blaise, Hermione, Neville, Pansy, Millicent, Daphne, Theodore, Tracey – even Adrian and Gemma. He’d
‘Harry came to us at the beginning of the term in a pretty bad shape. He could barely walk and was clearly in a lot of pain. He can have a scholarship, but I would suggest removing him from the school.’
He did his best to act like everything was fine in Japan. He made up excuses for why his arm was broken. His most common excuse was that he fell down the stairs. The students seemed to buy it, but the teachers were overly nice to him.
When she was at her destination, she went into the potion store and bought a Polyjuice potion. Hiding in an alley, she placed one of her old hairs into the potion and knocked it back. When the potion had taken effect, she walked up to Gringotts as Harry Potter and got out all the money, in muggle currency, she would need. She waited in an alley for the potion to wear off, once it had, she walked through the Leaky Cauldron and onto the street. Once the street was clear, she pulled out her wand and returned to surrey.
At breakfast his good mood had completely evaporated. Leaving him with dread at the thought of going back to Number 4 Privet Drive. The train was due to leave at 9am so after breakfast all the students rushed up to their dorms to do some last minute packing or just to get their bags. It was on his way to grab his case that he bumped into his only Slytherin friend, Savannah. She smiled at him before saying, in her French accent, "Hi Harry, I was wondering if you could spend the first week of the holidays with us, you see maman is having one of her friends over for the week. So she is letting me invite over a few friends so I'm not alone." At that moment harry could have kissed her, if he wasn't gay, of course.
“I brought you this, ‘Mione,” Neville began, voice barely audible. “Thought you might like to read it when you wake up… It’s one of my favourites. I hope you like it.”
All these opinions Harry could understand, on some level – after all, his friends were purebloods, raised in pureblood households where flying was common and magic was an everyday occurrence. What he didn’t understand, however, was Hermione’s point of view.
, and Harry’s irritation grew as he realised Longbottom had broken his wrist, and Madam Hooch announced the lesson would be postponed while she delivered the Gryffindor to the Hospital Wing.
Harry barely noticed his movement until Narcissa was knocking sharply on the Dursleys’ door with her wand. The sound echoed loudly in the quiet of Little Whinging. Harry’s heart beat louder.
, the vintage edition, and Gemma a small book of defensive magic. He felt rather bad about those ones – they had sent him such thoughtful gifts, and he had simply sent them sweets. Blaise gave him a set of soft leather boots enchanted with silencing charms, while Harry gave him a book of historical insults between famous wizards. Draco’s gift was, if Harry had to choose, his favourite: a handheld mirror, made of gilded silver, through which the user could communicate with the owner of its counterpart. Harry called Draco through it immediately, and he answered just as promptly.
Blaise pursed his lips in amusement at the door Ron had so quickly escaped through. “How long do you reckon that’ll last?”
The comment didn’t serve to mollify Hagrid. Harry’s heart twisted. The man looked on the verge of tears.
The rest of the Slytherins were not pleased when they saw the hourglasses of House points the next morning. They were even less pleased when they found out Harry and Draco were the ones who had collectively lost them one hundred points (fifty each for being out after curfew). Draco sneered at their comments, but Harry just ignored them. They
“It’s a wizarding children’s story, but it’s also a legend. You two should read it sometime, it’s quite interesting.”
Competing against players with actual experience was, as Harry had predicted, intensely difficult. He remembered clearly his one v one with Adrian last Christmas holidays. If that had been tiring, then this was nothing short of
“Alright,” he said, a smile just starting to tug at his lips. “Let’s go flying. Oh, and Blaise – you know you can call me Harry, right?”
“I want to know what’s behind it. What’s so dangerous that it could kill us, yet can be kept in a school with kids passing it every day?”
The sound must have distracted Tom Riddle, because he was shouting something at Harry – or maybe at the twins, but all it served to do was remind Harry of what had to be done. Staggering over to where Tom and the Weasley twins were watching in shock, Harry dropped to his knees beside the diary. Ginny was still as death now, but he didn’t stop to check for her pulse. Instead, drawing ragged breaths into his burning lungs and fighting the black at the edges of his vision, Harry grabbed onto the basilisk fang in his arm, ripped it free with a scream, and slammed it as hard as he could into the cover of Tom Riddle’s diary.
Hedwig hooted joyfully as she soared into his room, dropping her cargo onto his bed before landing atop the rickety chair in the corner. Her cage with her usual perch had been left behind at Malfoy Manor, but she made do. Harry couldn’t hold back his wide smile.
“Get the door open!” Harry yelled. He threw the correct key blindly to the ground, making loop-de-loops around the room in a desperate attempt to throw off his pursuers.
Harry was suddenly very grateful that, like Hermione, he had taken an interest in the more advanced text books, and for his perfect memory, because he could very clearly picture the page in the third year Potions text he had flicked through out of interest that stated the answer to that question.
“You’re smart, Potter, but you’re not invincible. You’re only a first year, just like the rest of us.”
“Yeah,” Draco answered anyway. He swallowed, opened his mouth, and swallowed again. “He’s a famous alchemist. Most famous for creating-”
They looked. Further down the corridor, a door was partially open; spilling from it was a long puddle of water. The sight of it pooling in the cracks of the stone floor reminded Harry a little too much of the night he, Blaise, and Draco had found Mrs Norris petrified. Like most things that made him uncomfortable, Harry chose not to think about it.
A jet of white light shot from Draco’s wand before Lockhart could reach three, grazing Harry’s arm as he dodged at the last second.
Harry froze one step into his room. There was something jumping on his bed. Bat-like ears and giant green eyes were the creatures main features, and Harry identified it quickly. The more important question was this: why the Hell was there a House Elf playing trampoline on his bed?
Harry swallowed loudly, mouth suddenly dry as his friend finally regained his feet, still muttering complaints.
I'm sorry it's been a while! Be expecting another chapter or two up tonight though - I just got back from a birthday party and I'm in the mood for writing.
Blaise let out a deep sigh, far wearier than a twelve year old should be capable of, and ran one hand over his shaved head. “Oh, Potter,” he said. “What are we going to do with you?”
“It’s fine, really. It’s done with now, anyway, and so long as I keep out of trouble I should be fine,” Harry told her, resisting the urge to shift uncomfortably. He hadn’t been expecting such a vehement response. In all honesty, he wasn’t sure why she was so angry – nor did he know how to calm her down.
“Yes,” Dumbledore tilted his head. “And no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge nor truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.”
. Harry cried out but flung his good arm forward, snatching the Golden Snitch out of the air and crashing his broom into the ground.
The stranger didn’t appear to hear him. Harry moved forward, leaning around the corner to see what had so captured the boy’s attention. A crowd of elderly witches and wizards stood in silence, watching a magically levitated stretcher pass them by. The body being carried was covered completely by a white sheet.
“Come on,” Harry led Draco outside, unwilling to let go of his hand. The trail of spiders continued, further and further into the dark. They appeared to be heading for-
“See you later, Ronniekins!” called the twins in unison, before they headed off down the passageway.
He considered retrieving another piece of paper after messing up his name (no one called him Hadrian – the Dursleys called him ‘boy’ or ‘freak’ and his teachers called him ‘Harry’ in a feeble attempt at kindness through a nickname), but ultimately thought it too much of a risk. So, Harry folded his letter as neatly as he could, and placed it carefully under his bed. He would work out the whole ‘owl’ business tomorrow he decided, and, quite satisfied, settled down to sleep.
badge grabbed Harry’s arm roughly, shoving him up through the crowd until he was tugged into the side of Gilderoy Lockhart.
Narcissa placed a hand protectively on Harry and Draco’s backs and guided them out of the hallway with quick steps – unfortunately, because this was Harry’s life and nothing ever went smoothly, they only made it a few feet into the main corridor.
“Obviously you’re not going back to those horrid Muggles,” Draco continued, unaware at how that statement, said so confidently, made Harry’s heart swell to fullness. “But-”
“Farley, ma’am, Gemma Farley. I was a prefect for your son and Hadrian at Hogwarts, and,” she lowered her voice, “I believe this will be relevant to your concerns, if you’ll excuse my boldness - particularly Hadrian’s.”
“We-“ Harry had to stop, take a breath, start again, “We’re friends of Hagrid’s. And you… You’re Aragog, aren’t you?” The spider in Tom Riddle’s diary-memory had been considerably smaller than the one before them, but Harry found himself with no doubt that this was the same creature. Hagrid’s old ‘pet’ that had caused his expulsion, fully grown and absolutely terrifying.
He struggled to hold in his laughter at Longbottom’s reaction. The other boy’s jaw dropped even further, and he began to splutter slightly, even taking a step back. It was everything he’d hoped for – after all, he might be turning over a new leaf where Longbottom was concerned, but he could still have a little
Harry didn’t bother pointing out the flaw in Draco’s threat being that Draco obviously didn’t want him hurt, because he was too busy flying the high of realising, properly, fully, for the first time since meeting his friends, just how much he was cared for. He tugged Draco closer until the other boy sat down again.
There were a lot of glares and a fair amount of irritated muttering with Gemma’s interruption, but the Slytherins obeyed – with the exception of Draco Malfoy, who stuck to Harry’s side like glue.
“What have you done to her?” Fred snarled, at the same time as George growled out: “Who the fuck are you?”
After returning Fang to Hagrid’s house with a fresh bowl of food, Harry and Draco made the slow walk back up to the castle, quiet and subdued after their extraordinary night. The Common Room they arrived to, however, was anything but subdued.
“So I go see Hagrid, then,” he said, changing the subject. “You could come too, Hermione, if you’d like.”
, of the wraith getting closer and closer and closer, but everything seemed vague and unimportant behind the agony in his scar.
“Unlikely,” Hermione shook her head. “Seven is a significant number. Seven potions, seven rooms. It’s lucky for a reason, Harry.”
“Let’s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Hadrian Potter, shall we?” Tom suggested, casual as suggesting a picnic. “
The metal flap on his door pushed open, snapping Harry out of his hyperventilation. A bowl of tinned soup slid through, followed by a small piece of bread Harry could already tell was stale.
Lockhart – slapped a hand down on Harry’s shoulder in enthusiastic greeting. Harry briefly considered hexing that hand with a particularly painful stinging jinx – but the consequences, unfortunately, would most likely outweigh the reward.
He was abruptly proven wrong when the familiar translucent form of a girl with large, thick-rimmed glasses rose out of the floor. Harry managed, with great difficulty, to not laugh at Lockhart’s jump and Ron’s startled yelp.
Harry rubbed a hand over his face. “Okay. Listen, this isn’t a great time, Dobby. Go back to your master. Actually, who is-”
a good idea,” interrupted Millicent, who had gone a bit green at the mention of giant spiders. “There’s a curfew. There’s no way you’ll get out of the common room, let alone out to that shack on the edge of the grounds.”
Harry shrugged. “Maybe. I mean, Hogwarts is considered to be one of the safest places in Britain, right? Right up there with Gringotts itself. So if you thought something was going to be stolen from one safe place…”
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, you dolt. I was just going to ask. Mother and I have been talking, about what’s going to happen over the holidays.”
“Uhh…” Lockhart responded eloquently, evidently also having trouble changing tracks from ranting about the Weasley twins to facing a group of incredulous twelve year olds. He flashed a poor attempt at his usual gigawatt grin. “Yes, well, urgent call you see. Really can’t miss it.”
A centaur closer to Draco with a chestnut coat shook his head and spat. “These are the foals he saved, many moons ago.”
“We know,” said Daphne, releasing Astoria’s hand to step forward and dab at her – very dry – eyes. “But- well, you see, we’ve been friends with Theo and Gr- Hermione a while now, and we’ll be ever so quiet, I promise. Just- us talking to them – it can’t hurt, can it?” She looked up on the last few words, eyes artfully wide, the picture of sad innocence.
Harry grinned at them. “Sounds good to me. And – thank you, for coming with me. I know you didn’t do it for me, but. Thanks.”
Harry nodded. He didn’t want a reputation as being rude to the other Houses after all, and perhaps Hermione wouldn’t be such bad company.
“Ah, but together, you and I could return your parents to this world, Hadrian.” Voldemort smiled, strange and horrible and full of teeth. “We could bring them back. All I ask is for one thing in return. You see Hadrian, there is no good or evil in this world. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we will do extraordinary things.” His voice was getting desperate. “Just give me the stone!”
Draco turned away first, and Harry fell into step beside him as they walked silently up the path to Hogwarts.
“We don’t have the time for that! Ginny Weasley is in the Chamber, probably with whoever the Heir is, and who knows what is happening to her while we’re standing here arguing!”
“Uh…” Harry paused, closing his eyes to imagine a snake writhing, as the small etching on the tap had been pushed out of sight with the opening of the pipe. “
Unfortunately, neither Draco nor Pansy had had any luck with asking their respective parents about the Cerberus mystery. Though as it turned out, that wasn’t too big of an issue.
“Let me introduce my assistant,” Lockhart was saying, gesturing enthusiastically at a blank-faced Snape. “Professor Snape has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry. You’ll still have your Potions Master when I’m through with him, never fear!”
Harry spent much of the early game flying high over the pitch, scanning the air below for the tell-tale flash of gold that signalled the Snitch.
a highly influential Ministry member. The rules don’t apply to him,” said Daphne, flicking her hair behind one shoulder. “Congratulations by the way, Potter.”
Harry grinned back at her. “It’s fine. No, I didn’t kill anyone, not really. But, when I touched Quirrell, his skin got all burned and kind of crumbled, it was pretty cool!”
“Say, Harry – do you think your friend could take a photo of me and you standing together? You know, to prove I’ve met you?”
“Miss Weasley and the Misters Weasley who accompanied you in the Chamber are both well on the mend, as you’ve already seen, and the rest of your little cohort are quite safe; including Miss Granger and Mr Nott, who were un-petrified by Professor Sprout’s mandrakes some days ago.”
“Well,” Fred said frankly, “You saved our sister’s life, and probably ours with that basilisk fang through the diary trick.”
It was Millicent. Harry stared at her in shock as she clapped loudly into the silence, followed slowly by a confused looking Tracey, then Pansy, then Blaise, and even Daphne.
“You failed, though,” Harry said, clenching his jaw. “The Mandrake Draught will heal the petrified and you’ll still be stuck down here.”
She lifted a small potted plant onto the bench in front of her, took a deep breath, grabbed the plant’s tufted top, flexed her fingers and
“That’s exactly what I’ve been trying to tell him, Granger,” came a dry remark, and Harry used one hand to manoeuvre some of Hermione’s hair out of the way to reveal Blaise, exasperated but ever smirking.
The rest of the night passed in a blur. The teachers arrived, eventually, Snape and McGonagall and Quirrell, while Gemma and Adrian kept an eye on the first years – and the troll. Snape wasn’t pleased, Harry could tell, but McGonagall ignored him, and gifted fifty points each to Harry, Hermione, and Longbottom, for
Conversation turned to lighter things, then, with Blaise leaving shortly after to go find Draco. Soon enough, it was curfew, and the Cerberus was the last thing on Harry’s mind, so distracted was he by his discussion on the use of magically enhanced plants in various potions with Hermione.
. Perhaps this is why they hated little Harry from the day he was placed on their doorstep, just an infant, or perhaps it was something else altogether.
Dumbledore’s twinkle dimmed slightly. “Ah, well. Quirinus had his life taken from him by Voldemort when he was possessed – so no, you did not kill him.”
Aragog clicks angrily at them, massive legs stamping on the ground. “That is a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets!”
“Longbottom, is there another way out of this?” Blaise called. His voice was strained, and he too had his eyes scrunched shut.
“Well, Mr Potter, let me give you a clue. The happiest man on Earth would look into that mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.”
Harry was confused. He could think of one man whose voice that may be, but where was he? He got his answer when Quirrell finished unwrapping his large purple turban, revealing-
“Oh yeah, there’s a troll in the dungeons, let’s just send the Slytherins back to their Common Room – in the dungeons!” Millicent said, sarcastically – though she couldn’t quite wipe the fear from her face.
“That’s because you look like a delinquent,” said Daphne matter-of-factly, and flicked her hair behind her shoulder.
The stone responded as it had to Harry. Slytherin’s mouth lowered, slowly, awfully, violently. Harry caught a glimpse of huge, glimmering scales before he was spinning on his heel with a shout.
Colin didn’t appear to notice. “They’re for my dad – the pictures. He’s a milkman, you know, a Muggle, like all our family’s been until me. No one knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till we got my letter from Hogwarts. Everyone just thought I was mental.”
“Well, I’ve never read about a memory being sealed into an object before, sir. I was wondering how it was possible.”
“Freshly caught Cornish pixies!” Lockhart corrected triumphantly. “Devilish little tricksters. Let’s see what you make of them!”
“You have my apologies, Professor,” Harry said instead. “I had no intention of causing a scene. May I ask when my detention will be?”
he chastised himself, but could only watch in shock as the Bludger stopped itself mid-air, and spun around to come right back at him.
“Don’t fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl; how you lot tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. I’ll even bind a limited edition in this snake skin!” he laughed again, almost hysterical. “Say goodbye to your memories.”
Harry stood silently, moving after McGonagall without even fully realising it. Behind him, Filch continued to mutter about dark magic, and evil.
A creaking, grinding, rock-on-rock, before Harry opened his eyes to see a narrow, winding set of stairs had emerged from the smooth sides of the pipe.
“Boys,” Madam Pomfrey scolded. “The last thing Mr Potter needs is more conflict. Perhaps it would be best if you left?”
The trio looked at each other for a long moment, before turning silently for the long trek back to the dungeons.
Harry shrugged. He would not show his fear. “I just wasn’t expecting it to be you, is all. Though I guess that’s what you were going for, right?”
“He’s his own person, Draco,” Blaise said, picking up the large vial to take them back. “He can do what he wants.”
“And now, Harry, I’m afraid I have some questions for you about what transpired in the Chamber.” Dumbledore eyed him carefully, though the twinkle behind his half-moon glasses didn’t falter. “How, exactly, did you dispose of Salazar’s basilisk? I must admit I’m impressed.”
There was an emotion in her eyes Harry thought he recognised, but didn’t want to name. Disgust was never a kind thing to see.
Both the Slytherin Head of House and Ravenclaw’s Professor Flitwick found Harry and his friends gossiping on their way back to the common rooms – or more specifically, they found Harry and Neville.
It took a fair amount of time – and a large selection of rock cakes that truly lived up to their name – before the trio managed to steer the conversation towards what they were really there for.
Above all the shouting and chatter was the voice of the man who Harry guessed was Gilderoy Lockhart – via use of a voice amplifying charm, Harry thought, maybe
knock you out for several hours, which is why I have provided each of you with a pair of earmuffs. If you would put them on for me... Very good. Now, let me demonstrate.”
Lucius raised a brow. “Admirable sentiments. We shall all miss your highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, ahem, killings.” He made a mocking bow in the direction of the door, and followed Dumbledore out with his head held high.
“Hello, Professor,” Hermione greeted awkwardly. There was an odd flush on her cheeks. “Isn’t it time for class?”
“Oh, thank Salazar!” Pansy cried dramatically. “You lot have been insufferable! Congratulations by the way Harry, you’re a great flyer.”
Or rather, saviours, plural, because squinting into the dark gave Harry the dim vision of numerous silhouettes of people astride horses. Only, with the lack of light, it almost seemed like the horse and rider became one…
Harry shook his head. “I’m going to see what Neville and Hermione think, but I reckon I’ll go see him. I have nothing to lose, right?”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked, worriedly. “Do you want to check in with Madam Pomfrey before we leave?”
Harry was watching. With her trademark feather-light touch, Astoria slowly unfolded Hermione’s fingers, revealing not the skin of her palm, but-
“So are we decided?” Harry interrupted before Hermione could continue. “We go to see Hagrid, see if we can find anything out about what the Cerberus is guarding?”
Sorry, Neville. Sorry, Hagrid. I actually quite like them both as characters (especially Neville) but the disparaging remarks are necessary for now.
“He knows exactly what he’s saying, actually.” Draco was flushed from the game, but he stood firm in front of Harry. “And what he said was
“Ginny told me all about you,” Tom replied. “I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Obviously he meant no stupid fighting in the corridors; pranks; that sort of thing.”
of you outside of this Common Room, do not doubt that your punishment will be,” he paused, stare darkening even more, “Severe.”
Harry might have laughed if he weren’t shaking. The spiders’ clicking was reaching a feverish pitch as the lantern seemed to dim at their approach. Harry drew his wand, but every spell he’d ever learnt seemed to vanish from his mind at the sight of the eight-legged onslaught.
“Well I’m going back to the Common Room,” said Daphne, clearing her things from the table. “I need to check if Astoria is alright. But if only a few of you went…”
Harry gave him a long, evaluating look. Ron Weasley seemed rather rude, and his eyes kept flickering up to Harry’s scar. It was making him quite uncomfortable, and that combined with Ron’s greeting of Draco – Harry’s first friend in the new world he’d found himself in – made up his mind for him.
“Ah, yes,” the Defence teacher coughed, rising shakily to his feet. “Well, there you have it. That was a Disarming Charm. As you see, I’ve lost my wand. Ah, thank you, Mr Finch-Fletchley.”
Harry looked up, and met the anxious brown eyes of Hermione Granger. She was clutching a large stack of books and gnawing on her lower lip fiercely, yet her blue and bronze uniform was pristine.
“Miss Weasley,” Madam Pomfrey said, fixing Ginny with a stern, though not unkind, stare. “To your own bed, if you would.”
“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked her, almost scared to open the parchment. This was what Hermione had found in the library. This was what she had been looking for.
He blinked. The murderous voice was gone, and Harry realised too late that he was staring at a wall, fingers pressed against the stone.
His rucksack was sprawled onto the floor, the contents scattered around it in a mess as though someone had gone through it in a rush – someone who was looking for something.
“Shouldn’t we get a teacher?” Harry asked. His voice didn’t seem to be his own. The world felt like a dream.
Harry had stopped paying attention the moment he started talking about the sweets. He was too busy thinking about what Dumbledore had said. Love had saved him? Harry loved his mother, or at least the memory of her, and from the way he remembered her he knew she had loved him too, but love wasn’t magic. Love was strong, he was sure, but it couldn’t physically save a life the way Harry had been saved from the Killing Curse. That just didn’t make logical sense.
Slowly, oh so slowly, the great limb shifted until the trapdoor was fully revealed. They were all panting by the end of it – though Blaise turned his face away so Neville and Hermione couldn’t see.
“Welcome back, Potter,” said Blaise. His smirk was casual, but there was something in his eyes that Harry thought might have been relief. Relief that he was safe – that they all were.
Wynona Ecklehurt was faster than Higgs had been, and meaner too. Harry counted several fouls to his person during the game – none of which were noted by Flint, of course – but it wasn’t enough. Harry spotted the Snitch, and the other Seeker was too far away to do anything about it. He swooped into a dive, and snatched the golden ball out of the air. The manoeuvre signalled the end of the match – and the last try-out.
else would have been more suitable, but I will find out, and whoever is responsible will be punished. No child deserves to be treated the way you and your filthy husband have treated that boy.
Harry waited until it left, and then waited until he couldn’t bear to wait anymore before he inched back towards the faint sound of spellcasting.
Gemma Farley approached the trio on brisk feet, her wild dark curls held back from her face in a sensible (though of course still fashionable) updo. Gemma had graduated at the end of the previous year, and while Harry knew she had accepted an internship offer in the Ministry of Magical Law Enforcement, he hadn’t know that she would be starting so soon.
Harry wasn’t overly surprised by the lack of visitors, either – he had noticed Longbottom sitting alone at the Gryffindor table, and he had already guessed that Weasley had badgered Draco for the remembrall simply for the sake of starting a fight rather than for any sense of loyalty.
The statement was genuine. Harry had never had anyone care if he put himself at risk before – he knew his friends cared about him, and he knew Draco worried, but he couldn’t wrap his head around why Draco would have such an extreme reaction when, in the end, nothing bad had come of his admittedly reckless action.
was sorted into Hufflepuff to kick off the sorting. Harry wasn’t paying all that much attention except to see
Harry sighed for the eighth time in the last five minutes. The passageway into the Chamber seemed never-ending, and the twins’ constant chattering wasn’t exactly helping. If it wasn’t their sister waiting ahead, he might’ve hexed them himself. But it was, so he kept walking, and restricted himself to sighing again.
No one protested. It was amazing, truly, how just two years with a boy like Hadrian Potter could lead to such a change in children. Some could call it fate. Some could call it prophecy. Or some could call it that very human tendency to find someone you care about and hold on tight, damn the consequences. Whatever the reason, every child in the room that day knew that they would do an awful lot for Hadrian Potter, and this fact alone would change everything.
Harry opened his eyes. The whole Hall was staring at him, with varying degrees of hope and shock, but none looked so hopeful as Draco Malfoy.
“If I could borrow you for a moment, Lady Malfoy?” Gemma asked. “All three of you.” She looked uncharacteristically serious, and Harry had a sinking feeling that it wasn’t simply because she was on the job.
Another knock interrupted conversation – this one high, a rapping sound, metal on wood. Harry’s heart dropped before the door finished opening. A flash of platinum blond hair; Harry squeezed Draco’s fingers in his own but it meant little when Lucius Malfoy came stepping, sneering, into view.
“Who is it the monster has taken, Minerva?” Professor Sprout asked anxiously, rubbing soil-stained hands on her apron.
Harry watched his friends bicker, smiling to himself. It struck him, sometimes, just how much he liked it at Hogwarts. Here, surrounded by people he trusted, it was hard to believe he’d have to return to the Dursleys’ for the summer – especially after his last dramatic exit. But he was fairly certain there was no other way. He’d thought of asking if he could stay over summer break, but who could he ask? Snape hated him, Dumbledore was strange (and Harry didn’t trust him), and none of his friends knew his secret. They could never know. There was always Mrs Malfoy, but with the way Draco danced around the subject of his father, that home was unlikely to be open to him with Lucius Malfoy around. No, he’d just have to put up with the Dursleys; at least for now.
He heard no screaming, so he assumed the twins had listened. On the wall Harry was now facing, the massive shadow of a basilisk flickered in the firelight.
The boy seemed uncertain for a moment, before sitting opposite Harry (Harry had never seen someone sit down arrogantly before, but this boy seemed to make everything he did a supercilious gesture).
“Guys, shut up,” Harry snapped as quietly as he could. “So, we go in, we play some music like Hagrid said to lull Fluffy to sleep, we go down the trapdoor ready for anything. Are we good?”
Draco considered their words for a long moment. Harry watched the emotion play across his face – Draco’s mask was good, but not quite as good as he thought it was – and bit his lip. Draco’s relationship with his father was complicated, Harry knew that, and he wouldn’t make his friend do anything, but it Harry had gathered anything from the few peeks into Draco’s homelife and the various implications he’d picked up on (like notices like, after all), it was that Lucius Malfoy was a bit of a dick.
Draco sighed. “Listen, I know you don’t like Professor Snape Harry, but we could tell him. He could deal with this, it’s what he’s there for!”
“Professor Snape will be here soon for his speech. Do you all want to be crowding around a firstie when he comes by like a bunch of pigeons? Sit down, all of you.”
No less than two days into the school year, Harry was ambushed. He was walking with Hermione to their shared Defence class when a flurry of blond hair attached to an eager grin catapulted itself in front of him. Upon further inspection, it became apparent that there was a small child hidden behind these features – a small,
Draco snorted. He was sitting as far away from Hermione as he could get, even leaning back in his chair. Harry thought he was being ridiculous, but at least Hermione was ignoring him, and Blaise seemed totally unconcerned with the situation.
“You are a walking catastrophe in Potions,” Harry told him. “It’s very distracting for me, not to mention rather stressful. I want you to get a tutor, and I want you to work on the class every spare second you get. I don’t care if you start failing your other classes – just pick up your act in Potions.”
“Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you,” McGonagall said from behind him, and then the gargoyle’s stone wings closed again, trapping Harry within.
Draco’s face lit up with a beam, and he leaned forward in his seat. “Perfect! Now, what house do you think you’ll be in? Personally, I think Slytherin, because everyone in my family’s in Slytherin, and everyone knows it’s the best house.”
of June, 1991, to the sound of his aunt’s shrill voice piercing through the door of his cupboard. This was normal.
“Listen up, Slytherins,” Marcus Flint snarled. “You think you’ve got what it takes to win? Fine. But if any of you waste my time today with some pathetic attempt at riding a broom, you’ll be off this pitch and into detention before you can blink. Got it? Now line up!”
They had no time to dwell on the fast-paced events, however, because the force of Lockhart’s body hitting the rock of the Chamber wall had started an avalanche from above. The whole passageway seemed to shake and shudder before, with a deafening
“But it’s still a bit of a stretch, isn’t it?” Neville looked up worriedly. “I mean, we don’t even know if the thing was moved to Hogwarts.”
“Well then!” He clapped his hands together as if to congratulate himself on a job well done. “Excellent work, Harry, everyone. I’ll uh- I’ll just be going then, no need for me-”
“Flourish and Blotts,” Tracey read from her list. “But this is strange – I noticed it when I first read the letter. Nearly all of our books are written by the same person.”
“I- I need a room, please,” Harry told him, silently cursing his stutter. “But I haven’t got any money on me. I can pay you tomorrow, I just need to visit Gringotts, but…”
Harry sighed, taking off his glasses to rub at his eyes. He should go to bed. There was no point to what he was doing – he had no ideas, no new information, nothing. Plus, he remembered with a groan, he had Defence first in the morning. Dealing with Lockhart was hard enough on a full night’s sleep; he didn’t know how he’d manage when under-rested.
Adrian snorted, and turned his stare to Harry. It took him a moment to realise he wanted an answer to his question.
“Why me?” Someone was draining all the oxygen out of the room, surely? Tom Riddle’s stare seemed to pin Harry in place, fear and shock gluing his feet and his attention.
Harry didn’t answer; rather, he lifted a hand and knocked as loudly as he could, with all the assertiveness he could muster.
“Not that that isn’t scary, but aren’t any of you confused? What on Earth is the ‘Chamber of Secrets’?”
“I’ve heard there are monsters in this Forest,” whispered Draco, unhelpfully. His face seemed paler than usual, though whether that was a trick of the light or a symptom of the situation was unclear. “Werewolves and vampires and centaurs. Mother used to tell me bedtime stories about them.”
“As you can see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,” Lockhart explained, arrogant grin still firmly in place. “On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.”
“Excellent idea, excellent idea. But if you don’t mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy.”
“This is a mess,” Daphne murmured. She was curled up on the sofa next to the fire, Astoria tucked against her side. Her fingers were white where they clutched onto her little sister’s shoulder, but if it hurt, Astoria didn’t let it show. “Why haven’t the teachers found this creep yet?”
The parchment absorbed his words as they had absorbed the ink spill, and mere seconds later new words – not his own – emerged on the page:
Harry felt himself being dragged away, though it seemed absent to his mind. A cluster of spiders scurried in formation to escape out a window as they passed.
“Hello, Mrs Dursley,” Narcissa greeted pleasantly. She did not smile. “We have come to retrieve Harry’s supplies. I trust you do not mind.”
would come with flying. The wind rushing past his face, the view from high above the ground – he couldn’t imagine anything more exhilarating.
Especially because Harry’s quiet nature did not abate as he grew. In fact, by the time Harry was five, he had spoken a grand total of eighteen words in his life, twelve of which had been variations of ‘mum’ and ‘dad’. The other six had been compiled into a single sentence on the night of his parents’ death, unheard to anyone but the corpse of his mother on the floor who, unfortunately for Harry, had very little to say in response. Those six words would not leave Harry’s lips again for over a decade, and until that day, they would remain a secret to all but Harry himself.
“See, the third one here takes you back, and the last one takes you forward! But- oh,” she faltered. “To go forward – it’s only a small vial.” She held the potion up as proof. “There’s only enough for one.”
Draco visited Harry every day at the Leaky Cauldron over the following weeks, without fail. Narcissa joined them most days, as a supervisor of sorts, but when she had other business to attend to they were left with a Malfoy House Elf – Dilly. Dilly was a bit odd, Harry thought, but nice enough. And at least she wasn’t Dobby.
“All students will return to their house common rooms by six o’clock in the evening. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions,” Professor Snape rolled up the parchment he was reading from and pinned his beady glare on every Slytherin student foolish enough to make eye contact. “I should add that anyone found breaking this rule,” he focussed on Harry, “Will be severely punished at my hand, if they aren’t Petrified first.”
Harry was released from the Hospital Wing that very evening, and not long after came the last day of school. The Great Hall, to Harry’s delight, was decorated in green and silver.
Draco stared at him, grey eyes so furious they made Harry want to look away, before he stood from the table with a slam onto the desk. “You’re an absolute moron, Harry Potter!”
The doorbell rung, cutting off Petunia’s reassurance, and Vernon shoved Harry roughly towards the stairs.
Narcissa bought them ice cream. Harry ate his in silence. He hadn’t said anything since they left Little Whinging – in all honestly, he didn’t know what to say. Theodore wasn’t ever inclined to chatter, so the conversation around him was mostly Narcissa and Draco, but Harry wasn’t really paying attention. He needed to process.
Millicent gave him a scalding look. “You didn’t think the Forbidden Forest. Which is expressly forbidden. To everyone. The forest that you have previously been attacked in and nearly died. You didn’t think that forest. Was going to be ‘that dangerous’?”
Harry looked pensive, "He's got a small mark on his foot But healers have told me it will go away eventually. It looks like a little black skull."
“More likely they didn't leave the house much. He only stayed in contact with Blaise and I. Since I had my healer license, I did all his checkups until he went to the hospital.”
So they each raised their child, taught them magic and everyday things the children could learn in muggle schools.  The children grew up to be happy, well adjusted children. Lily knew her Daddy was out there, but Papa could not find him. Scorpious knew his Papa was out there, but Daddy couldn't find him.  What struck each father as interesting was that each child looked like the parent they had never met. Scorpious had Draco's grey eyes, blond hair and strong jaw. Lily had Harry's black hair, touched with a bit of red. She also had the emerald eyes Draco fell in love with. What struck Draco the most was Lily's love of black dogs and Stags. Harry often claimed he would never understand his son's fascination with snakes and potions.
Filus proceeded to explain how the school worked, the houses and how the children would be sorted. It was fun for Lily to listen to him, but she was insanely curious about the Great Hall. She knew her Papa wanted her in the house that fit her best, but he was privately hoping she would be a Slytherin.
Harry smiled, "Same here. If it hadn't been for that bloody war, I think we would have raised those two together."
