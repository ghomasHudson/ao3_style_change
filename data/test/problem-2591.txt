“Yeah I’m — I’m fine.” Potter wheezed, his breathing once again speeding up.
Harry wasn’t sure of how long he’d been left alone in the cell. There were no windows, and no structure, so Harry just spent his days staring at the bars. They weren’t perfectly even, but none of the gaps were large enough to slip through, making the information effectively useless.
“A deal with
“So,” Fleur said in a transparently fake, cheery voice, “Fidelius after breakfast, yes?”
Severus made a non commital sound, before setting up the ingredients for the potion. They worked in silent harmony, used to the motions at this point. The potion bubbled a dark red as the blood was added, before they turned down the heat to let the potion simmer for a twelve hours.
, after all.”
Never mind the fact that he’d caught Potter staring at him more than once - it was always with a vacant expression, and Draco knew how prone Potter was to daydreaming. It couldn’t possibly be about him.
saved him, and he would never have been able to live freely without him) had spoken up for him, elaborating a touch but mostly telling the truth about Draco’s parents being threatened, and Draco had been released with a warning. So he had to be a model person, but he had no intention in following in his Father’s footsteps of bribery anyway.
“There’s more than one spell you can use to kill someone,” Harry had said quietly, determinedly
But students started to file past him as he stood there in shock, and he closed his oddly dry mouth as he was jostled for the fourth time. He knew for a fact that he wouldn’t have something as mundane as being jostled in a dream.
After a while, Kreacher sat up, looking like a mess, with mucus everywhere and large, bloodshot eyes. “Kreacher, do you still have the locket? We want to help fulfill your Master Regulus’ dying wish.”
had done — terrible things. He cringed internally at the sheer number of insults he could remember hurling at Ron and Hermione, mostly for their connection to Harry, making fun of things they couldn’t control — Ron’s family’s wealth, Hermione’s teeth (oh dear Merlin, that
of dark magic and evil and Voldemort (
“So, how are you doing, Harry?”
“For Potter’s dick,” Blaise muttered under his breath. Draco turned to glare at him, but didn’t deny it.
“This had better be a
“But — Harry was with Dumbledore.”
“Another three weeks, my Lord.”
The four conscious people stared at each other for an uncomfortable five seconds, before Hermione broke the silence. “We should probably get him down somewhere.”
It took a whole minute, during which Harry had started fidgeting, but he seemed very impressed with the results when Draco said “done,” and he examined himself in the mirror.
All these questions whirled around Harry’s head as he bolted upright, trying his best to control his breathing. It didn’t take as long - around two minutes - so Harry opened the drapes around his bed, checking on Draco.
That’s all Harry’s life had been. He’d been raised, only to be killed.
They ended up just outside the cave containing the lake where the locket had been stored. Harry had suggested it, weeks ago — it seemed fitting to end the horcruxes where one had been stored. Not to mention, there were no people for miles.
“Help yourself,” Hermione interrupted, waving a hand at the table. Malfoy nodded his thanks, slathering a slice of toast with copious amounts of raspberry jam, somehow taking a bite without spilling a drop. “So I guess the next question is, what do we do next? We have to defeat Voldemort — or get Harry ready to — and there’s some…other stuff me and Ron need to do as well.”

Fleur huffed and stalked back to Shell Cottage, her silvery glow fading slightly as she got to the gates. Ginny stared after her slack jawed, and Remus snapped his fingers in front of her nose.
Harry briefly summarised what had happened to him, while he made tea for everyone. He only left out the part where he saw Sirius; that felt like something only him and Remus should know.
Ignoring the scuffle behind him, Remus cleared his throat and said, “Kingsley?”
“They — but how —
Draco tried to breathe as quietly as possible, carefully cutting his chicken while warily watching the others at the table. The atmosphere was thick with tension, and while Draco longed to talk, any conversation initiated by himself would likely be shot down by Ron — being on a first name basis had done nothing to reduce the hostility between them. Also, he was absolutely shattered after a day of research and practicing healing spells. They weren’t
After one waffle each, to everyone (especially Draco’s) dismay, they went into the living room, since they didn’t have to be at the Weasley’s for another three hours. After years of begging, Draco had finally relented and let Harry charm a TV to work in their house. They’d moved into Grimmauld Place after Draco had got his healer’s qualification - Harry had never quite decided what he wanted to do and had occupied himself first with clearing out the house, and then reading his way through the Black family library. He was now more knowledgeable in various topics to do with the dark arts than he’d ever wanted, which had influenced Draco’s final decision to get a television. After spending a considerable amount of time cooking and bingeing various shows, he’d been occupied as a stay-at-home dad with James, and then Scorpius.
“Yes, but — wait, what?” Hermione turned as Ron strode past her, almost out of the door before he replied.
He quickly stripped down to his boxers, before pulling on one of Dudley’s old shirts. It was grey and had holes in it and came halfway down his thighs, despite Dudley having worn it when he was fourteen and Harry being eighteen. The Dursley’s really had treated him well. Or his parents were just short. Nobody had ever told him.
“There isn’t.” Molly’s eyes hardened, even as they shone with unshed tears, and she turned to the twins. “Polyjuice. Now. Make sure you have enough left for Ron and Hermione, and bring two boxes for a bit of our hair.”
For there, under
He stormed out, and decided that this was
But most of all, he was Fed Up of people fawning over Harry Potter the Saviour.
Malfoy looked between the three in shock — or maybe it was dread — before coming to the conclusion that he wasn’t getting a say in the matter. “As long as we have the biggest bed.”
Draco sighed and rolled over and propped himself up on his elbow. Blaise wouldn’t give up, and Draco really couldn’t be arsed to hex him. “I kissed Potter.”
Just as the last letter was sent off, Harry swore loudly, clutching his forehead. He saw the world pitch to the side before he was in Voldemort’s head.
It was Ron who spoke up. His blue eyes flickered in the firelight, a soft orange Weasley sweatshirt hugging his thin frame. Hermione smiled softly at him. “I am. Anyone else?”
Draco likes to think that the rain falls because the sky is heavy with secrets shouted from mountaintops, and they release the pain into something beautiful that soaks everybody and washes them clean, and sometimes he’d drag Harry outside to dance in the rain despite Harry's protests of
(It means he’s real.)
Malfoy tripped Filch on his way and paused, staring at them running away with the slightest hint of concern in his burning silver eyes. He caught Harry's eyes and smiled softly, and Harry wanted to scream
. Why couldn’t he be numb? Why was it always him? He looked up at the sky. At least he was with James and Lily now.
Harry cast a stasis spell on Draco’s wrist to slow down the bleeding, before going to Draco’s trunk. He summoned the bottle of dittany he’d used the day before, and tried to summon what Hermione had used on his hand to stop it bleeding in fifth year. “It began with an ‘M’...mingled...moper...maple…” Harry was starting to hyperventilate, and took a couple of deep breaths before the word sprung to mind.
“Draco,” he sneered, “and Severus escaped with the…prisoner.”
After two and a half hours Draco felt a spike of panic, which caused him to bolt upright, before hearing Harry’s voice;
“Excellent job, Draco.” Draco’s father gestured behind, to the destruction Draco had tried to detach himself from.
“Do they though?” Pansy raised an eyebrow.
Harry struggled to sit up, and he was surprised when he was able to hold the glass of water without much trouble.  He took a large sip, and then another, and quickly drained the glass, before grimacing at the horrid feeling of an empty stomach filled with water. Feeling slightly nauseous, he took one slice of bread and carefully nibbled at the side.
“Fucking mother hen,” Potter grumbled, before taking the bread Draco held out, slathered on some butter and dunked it in the soup. “Why are oo’ ‘oin’ ‘is any’ay?”
“I’m two minutes late. And you’re still packing.”
“No it’s fine, there’s another sofa—”
Bill tried his best to paste a bland smile on his face. “I found a discrepancy in a file, and felt it was important enough to bring to the top.”
Walking away from the incident, Harry decided to keep an eye on Mal- Draco. He will call him Draco.
Hermione jerked away from the pensieve, blinking rapidly as the blood rushed from her head.
he thought to himself,
Voldemort had been diligently plotting how to lure Potter to Malfoy Manor when he, along with his little friends, had simply
Draco held out his hand, saying he’d be fine with the dittany and salve but...Harry didn’t want Draco to have to move with all those injuries. And he’d comforted Harry last night - Harry could do this, now.
are allowed to call me Nymphadora, Kingsley,” Tonks cut in.
“Yes.”
But most importantly, it wasn’t a mind. Which meant the bond had gone wrong. Draco was relieved - he’d decided that he didn’t really want a bond with Potter, especially if the git figured out how to use it to his advantage. Draco shuddered at the thought of Potter finding out just how much Draco thought about him.
For the first time, the welcome feast was muffled by an atmosphere heavy with tension. Everyone huddled in small groups, knees touching as they craved some semblance of comfort under the heavy gaze of Umbridge and the Carrows. They ate in silence, shooting sideways glances at the huge gaps at the table. The Sorting Hat had been allowed to sort the kids, but had been threatened with incineration if it dared sing a song. To everyone’s surprise, it obliged, the sorting passing by in record pace as four Gryffindors, three Ravenclaws, two Hufflepuffs and two Slytherins were sorted.
Everyone had been annoyingly worried about her in the two days leading up to her going to Hogwarts, which wasn’t surprising, but it was extremely irritating. She was stressed enough as it was, and certainly didn’t need everyone walking on eggshells around her. She put up with it, though — she saw how much it helped everyone, if she reassured everyone five times a day that “yes, I’m okay, yes, I’m sure I want to do this, no, I don’t want to send Ron under polyjuice.”
Harry, while at Hogwarts, had suppressed any and all thoughts of the Dursleys. He never let anyone see him shirtless, and hadn’t been particularly fond of Ron pinching food from his plate in first year, but overall he had been quite sure that no one at Hogwarts knew about his situation.
“That…a lot happened. I’d rather not talk about it, but…wait, isn’t there a pensieve around here somewhere?”
“A member of the bloodline of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black — Kreacher is most honoured, oh yes, he is — would Master Malfoy be wanting anything? A drink? A massage? Mistress Black was always very fond of Kreacher’s foot–rubs, oh, she was…” Kreacher continued to mumble while Draco stared at him in equal parts shock and horror. Snape’s shoulders were twitching with restrained laughter. Harry and Ron had actually managed to keep themselves calm — until they looked at each other and burst out laughing, quickly reduced to noiseless wheezing. Hermione was tempted to join them, and could feel the corners of her lips twitching, but took a deep breath and calmly said “Kreacher. Get off the ground and listen to Harry.”
He couldn’t believe this was his soulmate. His initial concern had been that Draco would tell others. Well, that
Voldemort pressed two fingers to his forehead as the death eaters started to file in. “You’re all dismissed. Lucius, take them to the cells on the highest level, and go get two doses of veritaserum from Severus.” Why they all felt the need to come back — once a mission is complete, they’re dismissed until there’s another mission. If only there were more smart people. Maybe he should start indoctrinating the Ravenclaws...then again, he had plans to indoctrinate the whole of Hogwarts.
Perhaps the luckiest thing happening was that Potter was...completely oblivious, from what Draco saw. Draco felt himself pretty observant, and Potter didn’t seem to be anything other than himself - basking in adoration from his fans, screwing up his potions worse than Draco at his most distracted, and not paying any attention to Draco (for once).
Harry rolled his eyes and left. Draco used the toilet, washed his face and brushed his teeth, walking out just as Harry pulled his jumper on. “All yours.” Draco gestured to the bathroom, not looking at Harry as he walked over to his bed, casting an ironing charm on his uniform that he’d left out the day before. He turned to make sure Harry left the room - a pointless endeavour, since Harry had already seen him in his underwear - before quickly changing. He was combing his hair as Harry walked out, glamours already in place.
“He’s not wrong, ‘Mione.” Ron pointed out.
“Of course, let’s go.”
Heart heavy with sorrow, Draco turned on his heel and apparated back to the Manor.
“Is that — is that
“It’s because you exude the confidence of a Professor,” Ron whispered.
“What if I haven’t got this, though?”
He started to shake Potter’s arm, but he started screaming when Draco did, so he let go. Potter then stopped screaming, going into abrupt silence, and Draco sat up, trying to see if there was another way to wake him up, but the twitching suddenly commenced again, and Draco just though
Voldemort groaned inwardly as he thought about the situation. He, Lord Voldemort, had to ensure that Harry Potter, his sworn enemy, lived, otherwise he’d lose another horcrux. He knew the diary was missing, and had checked on his ring straight after bringing the boy back to the Manor, only to find that it had disappeared and the wards surrounding it were in ruins. He’d have to get the cup out of Bella’s vault soon — he’d gotten
pain, but he ignored it in favour of listening to the thoughts racing through Voldemort’s head as he threw bright green curses left and right in fury. Harry assumed this was the aftermath of Narcissa leaving with Ginny, and the rest of the people who Voldemort had probably locked in the dungeons. He was panicking about
Harry thought he’d known fear. Enough of it that he’d generally been desensitised to the idea of his death.
No, this is not turning into a Snupin fic, I promise.
“I love them, but that’s
For like, a day.
“It was no problem, don’t worry about it.” Remus nodded at Severus, before leaving at the question. Severus traced the clear skin one more time, before rising on unsteady feet and going to his room, passing out as soon as he lay down.
A couple of weeks into September, they’d officially run out of books. Surprisingly, it had been Ron that suggested that they tell Draco and Severus — since the apology, Ron had grown increasingly close to Draco, mostly over a chessboard Draco had brought from the Manor. Ron had pointed out that neither of the Slytherins had done anything remotely untrustworthy — in fact, both had done everything in their power to help Harry, above and beyond what the Gryffindors would have asked. And Severus had never been that bad in school, in hindsight.
The Dark Lord nodded his dismissal. Draco fled out of the room, as calmly as he could, walking directly to the bathroom and putting up a strong silencing charm before throwing up into the toilet.
“Point taken.” Millie shrugged.
Harry wiped his eyes again and gently patted the tombstone, before standing. “Ready?”
The screams suddenly stopped, and Ron turned spun around, to check if Harry was okay. Dumbledore bent down, looking for injuries and murmuring to Harry, who relaxed at the sight of the old man, mumbling replies too quiet for Ron to hear. Ron jumped forwards, away from the water when he heard a splash, but when he turned around to look, the water was perfectly still. Ron turned back to Dumbledore and Harry, who was curled up on the floor. Dumbledore murmured something to Harry, his expression becoming determined as he dragged Harry to his feet, past Ron, to the bank, before pressing a hand to Harry’s chest, preventing him from tumbling into the water. He summoned a chain from the water without a second thought, and Ron
- to Megan, Becky, Madi and Alexa, for reading this crap before it’s been edited, correcting typos and providing feedback and encouragement every step of the way - I love you guys as well.
“What’s up, Mal-Draco?” Granger had a forced smile on her face, but Draco couldn’t see any hostility behind it.
Harry genuinely felt bad about not replying to Draco. He didn’t want to hurt Draco, but he just couldn’t bring himself to talk to anyone. Better to keep to himself. Nobody really cared about his issues.
go back, because he didn’t want to have to wait years until his mind was sorted out and then get his NEWTs. He imagined going back as a twenty-five year old, sitting in a room of seventeen year olds who hadn’t been affected by the war as much as him. It just wasn’t done, and he didn’t want exceptions being made just because he was the
“Ron. Ron, I think Dumbledore is going to die.”
“Did she talk some sense into you then?” Draco was still smiling.
Kreacher looked at her with wide, pale–blue eyes. He looked as if he was going to say no — she’d asked it as a request rather than an order, after all — but then shifted his feet and continued. “Master Regulus was worried, very, very worried, and he told Kreacher to stay hidden and not leave the house. Kreacher stayed in his cupboard,most of the time, until Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard, one night. Master Regulus was disturbed in his mind, not quite himself, but he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. We went to the cave, again, to the basin, and Master — Master Regulus…”
He nodded to Hermione, indicating that she ask Kreacher. “Kreacher, please tell us about Regulus’ death.”
“Of course she isn’t.” Ginny curled an arm around her girlfriend.
“You have five minutes.” The booming voice echoed around the room, startling everyone. Ginny started sobbing, throwing herself into her mother — Hermione’s — arms.
“I have a few with me as well.” Malfoy cut in. Hermione turned to him in surprise, and he rolled his eyes. “I do read, Granger — I was second in all my classes, after yourself.” Hermione was surprised to hear no bitterness in his voice.
“Fuck off, Ron.” Harry groaned, waving a hand dismissively at Ron and rolling over, pulling the thick duvet over his head. He groaned again as said duvet was pulled off him, exposing him to the mercilessly cold air.
Draco kissed him, and it was a promise.
Regretting his promise, Harry got the fourth cup.
“Well, you did it yesterday despite your magic being depleted, so that shouldn’t be an issue. Do you know how it works, exactly?”
secret mission?” Ron asked, in an appalling Scottish accent that strongly resembled Professor McGonagall.
“Just be glad that we didn’t have to battle tonight. You’re good at duelling, but terrible at being a death eater, and the longer you keep that hidden, the better.”
“Fuck off, Malfoy.”
“With your grades, I’m sure you will get in.” Ginny said.
“I’m fucking pregnant, I shouldn’t have to put up with this.”
(See the end of the chapter for
. Furious, Ron went through the rock into an eerily green cave, mostly taken up by a massive lake, which was completely still, and a small island was situated in the middle.
Draco grinned at Harry.
“We just have to listen to him and brew the potion — why don’t you have a look instead of gawping at me.”
The trio made their way down to the hall. Harry kept his gaze on the floor for the most part - if he didn’t look at the walls, he wouldn’t see Lavender with Greyback, dead students, dead Tonks, dead Remus, dead Death Eaters. The images of the Death Eaters were less depressing and more disturbing, but all death is sad.
After clearing out the Burrow and putting most of the stuff in a large storage room that had appeared in Grimmauld Place, which had been a very emotional event for everyone involved, they started the rather boring task of bringing the order together. Hermione remembered the protean charm that she’d used for the DA, and decided to do something similar, with a knut that would grow warm under the touch of the person it was keyed to — a similar piece of magic to that of the snitch. It was tricky business, charming the knuts without touching them, but she managed it, leaving everyone else to write letters.
Harry shook his head. He’d get better — he
Severus. He was a good assistant, Severus had to admit — very adept at chopping and dicing — but was
“Only me, Harry, Ron and Dumbledore — and Voldemort,” she added as an afterthought, not missing how everyone else at the table flinched at the name, “know about it. So no.”
Voldemort’s eye twitched, and he sent another barrage of spells at Harry. Rather than fight back, he absorbed the power, banishing the darkness. Then, he slowly breathed out, sending bright diamonds, sharper than knives, shooting towards Voldemort.
Harry and Snape both glared at Hermione. “Hermione, you don’t really mean I have to call him,” he nodded at Snape, “
Also, I’ve almost finished writing - just got to write 11, which I hope to finish either tonight or tomorrow night. Because its pretty much finished, I’m going to post all the next chapters every other day instead of every 3 days :) I’m not going to start writing my next fic until all these are posted, but I still want to write, so please could you send prompts to my instagram/tumblr at Huffinglepuff?
They’d all played their parts well, and had only been subjected to two
. There weren’t signs of human life anywhere in the village.
Harry thought. He couldn’t be back here, he’d escaped.
Harry was already looking a bit better, after a night’s sleep. Somehow, his hair was a little shinier, and looked a little thicker, and the shadows under his eyes had lessened. He didn’t look
The first time Harry drifted into consciousness, an ice cold hand held him in a vice-like grip. Or that’s how it felt, anyway; was it like this before he’d woken up? Suddenly he was trembling from the cold, desperately closing his eyes. The floor beneath him was softer than it had been in the cell, but he felt like he was back in there, because really, it couldn’t be this cold anywhere else.
with Harry Potter.
Drying his eyes, Draco cast a tempus behind Harry’s back. It was five minutes until lunch, and while Draco hadn’t been planning on going down, Harry was extremely thin under his glamours and clothes.
“Hermione, Seamus, and Terry.”
He had a letter from Charlie sitting on the table beside him, which he kept skimming to make sure that he hadn’t missed anything. The general gist was that the Romanians were reluctant to travel to England to participate in a war that hadn’t quite started, but they were willing to send supplies and provide shelter for people in need, if they could make it there. Some colonies in Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria were also saying they’d help with temporary food and shelter as well. Fleur had sent letters to her contacts in France and Germany, but she was confident that they would also be willing to help. The wizarding populations in other European countries, while secretive, were actually very friendly and helpful, contrary to popular belief.
to them—”
Potter rolled his eyes and turned back to what he was doing - his stag had disappeared.
“No we don’t,” Draco groaned, pulling a pillow over his face.
but they knew their spells, and could be in charge of punishment as well. If he got Umbridge to give them more power, they could keep the other teachers in check as well. He’d let them decide which subjects they wanted to take — Dark Arts or…
Harry walked up the staircase to the dorms. It was quite late, and not surprising that Hermione and Ron thought he was shagging someone. Seamus, Dean and Neville’s curtains were already drawn, and Harry pulled off his uniform, pulling on an old, baggy t-shirt of Dudley’s and climbing into bed.
But no one was there, and all Harry got for his efforts was a hand across the face, and he lay there on the pavement, defeated, bleeding, and alone.
, on the other hand, had better
After getting dressed in silence, Harry decided to finally break the silence. He couldn’t deal with all the silent tension in the air. “I can’t believe I promised Hermione that I would actually go down to breakfast. At the Gryffindor table.”
Her grip on Ron’s hand grew painful, but Ron didn’t flinch as he let the magic pour out of him, giving all he had as if the world depended on it — because, well, it
“Okay, but don’t be tactless.” At this point, the couple turned into the Great Hall. Draco considered following them, but there was a much higher chance of an invisible person being discovered in the crowded Hall than the relatively empty corridors. He dodged a group of Hufflepuffs and headed down to the kitchens. Despite the business of lunch, the elves were all too happy to provide Draco with food, and he left with an extremely heavy basket under the cloak. He didn’t know what was inside, but the elves’ cooking was excellent, and whatever was in the Hall smelled good.
The pear giggled before allowing him entrance, and a soft smile broke out over Harry’s face as he saw Kreacher, happily bustling about with Regulus’ locket and Winky in tow. Winky also looked a lot happier.
made him still not fully worthy of trust, in many people’s eyes, but Shaklebolt had already expressed in his letters that he would wholeheartedly support any idea Remus presented, given that it wasn’t, in his words, “a crackpot idea likely to come out of Mundungus’ mouth after a night at the pub.”
He felt intense pain shoot through his scar as Bellatrix pressed down on the mark, before a wave of joy from Voldemort shot through him. He didn’t have time to consider the implications before Bellatrix screeched
Ginny sniffled from her seat in the corner and nodded. “Cleaning seems a bit pointless, now, doesn’t it?”
“Lucius, what happened?” She asked, her voice soft.
That’s Harry’s cloak - he lent it to me.
Harry’s friends had travelled a bit down the hall, and Harry dragged himself over.
Harry opened his eyes to see the room of requirement. There was fire all around him, and he was alone, but as he boarded the broomstick he felt an unusual sense of calm. He’d been here before, he’d done this before. He knew the drill.
“The second brother, still heartbroken over his fiancée dying a month or so ago, asked for a way to bring back the dead. Death picked up a nearby stone from the banks of the river, and said, ‘turn this stone thrice in your hand, and it shall summon the soul you desire.’ The second brother, also satisfied, passed Death and continued on his way. Then, Death turned to the third brother.
“Not that that isn’t a really interesting wall, ‘Mione, but why are you staring at it so intently?”
Well it wasn’t really
“It’s not
“We know umbrella charms, mate, we’ll be fine.” Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder and headed down to breakfast, Harry jogging to keep up while Hermione and Draco walked behind, murmuring about something or the other. Harry didn’t even try to find out what they’re talking about anymore - he knew from experience that generally it would just go straight over his head.
“Do you want me to be there?”
Harry groaned and waved a hand at Draco, before grunting “How am I supposed to get up with a Hippogriff on me?”
“I don’t think you can
Harry rolled his eyes. Even now, Draco refused to actually lose an argument.
Twenty seven days of glamours because Harry had been reasonably sure he didn’t look that bad when he went to the Weasley Sunday lunch. That was before the concerned looks from Bill and Percy - the same ones that were directed at George - before being pulled over by Ron and Hermione (who were inseparable now, and did everything together), and then Arthur, and then Ginny - before being fed enough food for three fully grown men by Molly because he was “looking terribly pale dear, what is that elf of yours feeding you?”
, he thought, turning to admire himself,
“We’re still bonded.” Harry said flatly. The professor puffed up with excitement.
“How am I supposed to find them,

and left in a vulnerable position on the floor.
“Of course, my Lord.” Bellatrix turned in a flurry of robes, quickly returning with something silver. The Dark Lord held it out to Draco, who knelt before him, staring at polished shoes and trying not to vomit.
“What have we got?”
“Yeah, that’s great. If you want, once all this is over, you can spend some time documenting them, or something.”
Maybe it was the earnest expression on his face as he did up the buttons, so close to Draco.
“See you tomorrow to make a plan?” Harry said.
Also, I don’t know if you noticed but I’ve got an estimate for the total number of chapters! I’ve planned out what’s going to happen in each one, and I think I’ll manage to stick to it :)
Draco sat on his bed in defeat.
“What do you mean, no?”
“They aren’t as healthy as vegetables, and you know it. Oh look, there are the Slytherins,” Hermione added with clearly false enthusiasm.
“How about tonight, if you’re so desperate to get him out.”
There were some other places to fill, he was sure. Muggle Studies, since he’d killed that muggle–loving bitch, Burbage. And Defence, since Severus…
Severus nodded and gathered the last dregs of his magic, apparating directly into the dining room of Grimmauld Place and collapsing in the nearest chair.

“Whether or not you know of a brewing room here, since Walburga would have been your…” Hermione turned to Severus, “Grandmother?”
Everyone nodded and murmured “yes” before departing. As everyone except Severus, Remus collapsed in his chair.

us.” Remus felt his heart rate start to rise, and deliberately took deep breaths, willing it to calm down. Now was not the time to panic. Not in front of everyone.
“I love you,” Draco whispers as they make snow angels. It’s the first time he says it, and he thinks everything freezes. Harry turns so quickly it looked comical and his glasses slip down his nose but he grasps Draco’s arms and smiles at him.
(They hold the universe.)
‘What do you mean?’
So Harry gathered him in his arms, whispering
, Harry thought dumbly. “Come and get it Potter!”
He was pulled away from his thoughts by Parvati, and he barely registered the music starting to play. He felt warm, so very warm, and the sound of Draco’s laughter filled his ears.
He remembered Sirius’ eyes, and the split second of fear that had crossed them before he fell back into the veil. He sat down and began to tear apart the grass.
(Wait.)
(But Harry had held him close, telling him that time gave Draco to Harry too, and maybe it was just a messenger, unable to change the course of everything, and maybe we shouldn’t really blame it.)
(Draco smiled. Happily.)
Petals fall, sometimes when you shake a flower too aggressively, sometimes because fall’s just round the corner. They fall, and they fall, and they fall and Draco cradles them gently in his hand, the soft glide bringing a few tears to his eyes.
Silent mornings have become a thing between them now. There was no rush. Harry would trace the freckles on Draco’s back, and there would be silence, just them laying there and listening to each other breathing, a silent reassurance that they were
he mouthed.
(Besides, the sun wasn't alone. It had the clouds.)
Harry opened the door to Madame Malkins, the soft tinkle of the bell accompanying his footsteps as he shyly stepped forward.
And he’d feel hands cupping his cheek, tilting his head up. “I’m not dealing with you.
(Fuck.)
They were both out of breath, because of the pain and the tears and the never ending suffering from a war that had been too big and involved too many teenagers who only wanted to learn magic.

(He was so screwed.)
He mounted his broom and chased after Malfoy, trying to convince himself that his heart was beating faster because of adrenaline and not the sight of Malfoy’s smile. Had it always been that beautiful?
Harry caught that thought and slapped himself mentally.
Damn him.
(Damn emotions. Damn it all to hell.)
Time took his childhood. Time ran so slow the war dragged on. Time took his mother. Maybe time would take Harry too.
(Trust Harry to make him love everything.)
The moon traveled across the sky silently, bathing everything in its blue light. The mermaids were singing, making the surface of the lake vibrate slightly, fireflies coming out of the bushes and dancing across the water.

(And maybe Harry trusted him again after that.)
(He’d remembered the conversation he and Malfoy had at the start of school, and the tentative handshake and Harry decided that this was the last time he was trusting someone, because he’ll be damned if he were to feel the prick of tears threatening to fall from his eyes ever again.)
(He’d never been happier.)
, that he didn’t know what had happened that Halloween.
“Who’s up for a snowball fight?”
Time still scared him.
‘I think so.’
Harry’s entire body warmed at the sound.
He faced back towards the other champions, who were all staring at the stairs he and Parvati had came from just a minute ago. There stood Hermione, looking incredibly pretty—and so much more confident—in her periwinkle dress, blushing under all the stares. Krum strode forward and took her hand, kissing it lightly. The pink of her cheeks turned darker, and her warm brown eyes found Harry’s green ones.
‘I think so too.’
Harry thought he looked like a dragon, protecting one of their own, their jewels, their riches. His hair was in disarray and his face was covered in dust and sweat, and Harry thought he’d never looked more beautiful.
now, allowed to express emotion, allowed to show weakness. A single white petal lay there in his hand, the flowers long since forgotten. Sometimes he thinks he’s a petal, a bit damaged from so many people walking on it, but beautiful, even as it falls, even as it breaks.

(He remembered the day when he and Harry had escaped to the beach, bathed in the moonlight and sand covering his toes, and
Shadows fall with the rising of the sun, and Draco feels safe when they do, feels safe when Harry comes running towards his room when he is shouting at the top of his lungs from dreams that haunt him and memories that crop up like weeds in his garden of pretty dreams, because Harry is the sun and the sun removes all the shadows—removes darkness and memories and anything that haunts his brain and ruins his heart—and he knows he is safe.
Damn these people and their high regard for public appearances.
Harry didn’t notice him at first. He was walking along the Great Lake, trying to ignore the dull ache in his chest. Another person, another life taken because he had allowed them to get close. He tried to repair the walls built around his heart, because
Draco loves falling asleep with Harry, not because he gets to cuddle with him—although that may be part of the reason—but because he gets to watch Harry eyelids as he falls asleep, gets to watch as Harry tries to keep awake as his eyelids hood over those beautiful emerald orbs that seem to take everything in and accept them for what they are, emerald eyes that are ever so warm and as lush as the forest's floor, and it's absolutely lovely when Harry's eyes finally close because he gets to sit still and gaze at the constellations tracing over a lavender blue skies before he snaps back to reality and realises that he had been staring at the webs behind Harry's eyes and he chuckles and fits himself better into Harry's arms, knowing that he did not need the galaxy painted on his ceiling when Harry held one in his eyelids.
“You wish.”
this all is, and there are tears in his eyes again (he wipes them away, and when Harry later asks him if he cried he’d say
(No, he’s really not.)
Sometimes Draco thinks that his heart is the tide and Harry’s is the moon, reeling him in and making him safe and pushing him back when he needed space. When he’d first fallen in love with Harry, it felt as if his heart was going to jump right out of his chest and unite with Harry’s, rejoicing at having found it’s match, and it had terrified him.
(But they cradle Draco alone.)
Hadn’t told anyone that he’d give up his scar and fame for his parents.
(He’s the moon, pulling in Draco’s tides.)
Snowflakes that fall to the ground in early winter, replacing the hue of white petals. Sometimes Draco gets a melancholy feeling when he tries to catch one in his hands but it melts far too quickly, because they’re like opportunities he got but never grasped. But Harry dances in them, and he falls into heaps of snow, and Draco realises that he’d been looking so far up he’d forgotten his feet on the ground.
Harry turned around and felt as if he had fallen from a tree and landed on his back, all air pushed away from his lungs. This person in front of him had to be an angel, it just had to be. Those mercury eyes stared at him curiously, strands of blonde hair falling into it as he tilted his head to the side, reminding Harry of a curious cat.
Narcissa fell, a rogue spell fired by one of the Death Eaters getting to her. Draco screamed in anguish, strength renewed as he fired curse after curse, eyes aglow with vengeance as he tried to reach his mother and heal her.
He sounded almost
“What do you mean?”
The moon watched over them as they tried to heal.
“What if we listen, but misinterpret it?”
Teardrops are nothing but liquid pain trying to find its way out because they do not feel as if they belong to your body, because you deserve to be full of care and love and tenderness and so they try to get out as soon as possible. Draco tries to stop them falling sometimes—he gets a headache from it, which

into his ears repeatedly until Draco sobbed, a tired, broken sound.
Harry didn't know what to do. Filch was on his way towards here, and they were running away from Malfoy and his squad. They were about to get caught.
(Maybe Harry is his sun.)
(‘I love you.’
He did not beg to shake his hand, or ask to push back his fringe to reveal the scar there. His lips quirked up ever so slightly instead, and there was a glint in his eyes Harry could not quite understand. “I’ll see you around Potter. Best take care of yourself, eh?”

. He couldn’t take anymore pain.
(It’s really fucking cheesy, Draco thinks, but he feels like he’s inside a snow globe, smile permanently on his face, staring at Harry’s emerald eyes forever.)
Draco cried as he clawed at his Dark Mark, eyes red rimmed and body exhausted. Harry wanted to break down at the sight. Draco Malfoy was cruel. He was hurtful, and he had hurt so many people, and he was so fucking
“EVERBODY DUCK!” Pansy screamed, and that was it. Everyone started scrambling around, forming teams and alliances, and Draco stood int he middle of it all, laughing brightly as he created a shield that deflected every snowball that came his way.
Then he realises that the sun shines bright and the moon is pale and that they reach out for each other like some sort of doomed love story, and it aches him but he knows that love did not come without a price, and so he lets the sun fall as his eyes gaze over the horizon, leaning back into Harry's arms as he tries not to cry at such a nonsensical thing when Harry whispers
Of all the things Harry didn't expect on his first day of 6th year, Draco Malfoy with eyeliner and pink hair wasn't one of them.
Harry tackles him into a kiss and they fall back into the snow, cheeks red and hearts singing.

“Scared, Potter?”
Potter.”
Malfoy did not answer immediately, and Harry resisted the urge to fidget under his gaze. “Yes, I suppose. Take care of yourself..?”
And there, on the edge of the Forbidden Forest was Draco Malfoy, positively glowing in the moonlight, sitting with the thestrals, tear tracks visible on his face. His face looks peaceful, serene. Harry’s heart gave a squeeze and his lungs stutter. He had made peace with his pain. Maybe Harry could too.
“Weasley packed your bag?”
Voldemort watched Lucius leave, before turning back to the library. There was a little book at the start that told you where each topic of book was — there was a huge section on healing, and a very small section on horcruxes. Voldemort went down to each section and removed a few books, before sitting in a small chair. He briefly considered asking Lucius to bring his chair upstairs, but decided not to since it would probably take the incompetent man a full day.
“How long was I asleep?” Harry asked, wincing at the soreness of his throat.
Malfoy’s voice was a lot closer than Harry was expecting it to be. He wearily cracked open one eye, not really getting much information other than the fact that there was an angry, pale smudge hovering above him.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “I didn’t know the wizarding world was so accepting of gays. My uncle - he wasn’t the nicest person, but he was a raging homophobic, and there wasn’t much representation of homosexuals in the muggle world, from what I saw. It’s nice to know that the wizarding world got at least one thing right.”
Harry frowned. He actually hadn’t thought about the event that had led to him being captured. Actually, he couldn’t get his head around the fact that Dumbledore was dead.
“He was probably in a rush, or something. And maybe Dumbledore told him what to write.”
Draco laid a hand on Harry’s arm, stroking it with his thumb. “Not every day has to be a good day. What matters is that we get to the next day, whether it be good or bad.”
“Should we try to contact him, then?” Ron asked into the heavy silence that followed.
Hermione looked at Harry, who raised an eyebrow in return. They wordlessly made the decision to speed up, practically jogging to keep up.
“You look well, Harry, how did you sleep?”
Kill himself, probably. There wouldn’t be another option for him. A lifetime under the Dark Lord’s command isn’t one worth living.
“I’ll cast Potter, since you have the delicacy of a Hippogriff in my mother’s china cabinet.” The corner of Potter’s mouth twitched before his face went neutral again.
“So there’s no way to remove the blood bond?” Hermione tilted her head, continuing to watch Ron out of the corner of her eye.
Draco groaned and flopped backwards on the bed, hands clasped on his stomach. “I cannot be fucking arsed.”
he remembers me,” Pansy rolled her eyes at Blaise, before turning to Draco. “Maybe you should ask Potter.”
Harry, Hermione, Draco, Severus, Remus and Narcissa all went into the Manor, looking for Voldemort. It was surprisingly easy; he was
“Nope, I’m awake now.” Harry got up, pulling the blankets down as he did so and exposing Draco, who looked adorable. Harry held a special place in his heart for how Draco looked in the morning - his hair stuck up at odd angles, his eyes were squinting and the corners of his mouth were downturned as he swore at Harry for getting him up at this ‘ungodly hour’, whether it be half-past six or eleven. Beautiful.

All the tension left Draco in one big motion. “So I can talk to him?”

through the bond, the absent minded
Harry’s eyes darted nervously between the other two death eaters, who were wearing identically malicious expressions. Harry tried to suppress a shudder.
“Well, yes. If this person is a prisoner, then they’re not on the Dark Lord’s side. They could probably be a powerful ally, if only we knew who it was. The potion doesn’t control minds, does it?”
“I was...but I couldn’t reach you. I’ll always be there.” A tear rolled down Draco’s face - he’d known Harry couldn’t see or hear him, but that small, broken voice, was one he’d hoped never to hear again. He hadn’t truly expected to never hear it again, but it hit him hard nevertheless.
“And how are you going to get past the Whomping Willow?” Remus asked. “If it attacks you, it’ll be pretty noticeable.”
“Very well, thank you. I see the nargles are leaving you alone, for once.”
Kingsley sighed. “Alright, but use your portkey at the first sign of trouble. Here, give your bag to Remus, so you can be quicker and have more manoeuvrability.”
By November, the teachers had either joined them in the room, which had expanded to three times the size of the Great Hall with individual rooms for the year groups, or left to try and get help. As much as they asked for it, the Room couldn’t provide a passage beyond the boundaries of the school, so everyone had to wait it out until the Hogwarts Express arrived at Hogsmeade station. The fifth, sixth and seventh years of all the houses had worked together to get everyone’s belongings out of the dorm, and the elves knew to bring three meals a day to the Room. McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick and Vector taught duelling during the day, and the entire student population were very adept at disillusionment charms.
“Potter!” He turned and smiled at Draco (
“Nothing...yet.”
Harry shifted uncomfortably as Draco, and his warm magic, left the bed. “That sounds good.”
“I — I don’t know what to say.” Ron’s heart broke to see Hermione look so…
“Fine.” Ron crossed his arms and pouted.
These people were attacking the wrong person, Draco hadn’t killed their families. If Harry had been a little quicker...perhaps they needn’t have died.
-Transfiguration, in which he vanished the bird he was supposed to be turning into a wooden toy.
“There you go. No more mark.” Remus grinned, before stretching his arms out. “I’m going to go get myself a snack. Do you want anything?”
Hermione’s face lit up in a grin, before both of them were abruptly pulled from the memory as a flash of red light — a
“Well, class, that’s the end of the lesson! Put the classroom back to it’s usual state, and twelve inches on what you could improve about your duelling technique...except you two.” He pointed two fingers at Harry and Draco. “Could you do a demonstration for my sixth and seventh years?”
“Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher, and said that it was being an honour, for Kreacher, and for Master Regulus, and that Kreacher should be sure to be doing whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do, and then — and then to come home.” Kreacher started rocking back and forth on his heels, the floorboards quietly creaking as he continued his story. “So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord, and the Dark Lord took Kreacher to a cave next to the sea. And inside the cave was a green cavern, with a big, still lake.”
march off to Hogwarts to see what was going on — he pointed out that she’d probably been forced to destroy the notebook, since the Carrows were trying their best to get into the Room. The last entry had been November 21st, when Ginny said that someone’s cat had gone missing, so she was going out with a large group of seventh years to find it. They’d figured that the six of them would be able to hold their own against the Carrows and Umbridge, but she hadn’t replied since.
“We do need to talk, you know.” Draco said.
She’d been anxious as she arrived on the platform with Bill and Fleur, but seeing all the little first years — less than usual, but they were there — strengthened her resolve. They needed someone to protect them, and that’s what she was there for.
“Mate, since when can you actually duel?” Ron asked.
putting on a bit of weight.
At breakfast the next day, Draco honestly couldn’t help but sit facing the Gryffindor table, watching Potter with the same intensity that he used to. He didn’t notice Pansy sitting next to him until she waved a hand in front of his face, yelling in his ear. Draco turned his head to pull a face at her.
“No, just extends the life by attaching it to someone else’s.”
“Boys! I thought you were brought up with fancy-ass pure blood manners!”

Many someones that would need to be punished.
“Making potions. The Dark Lord said he needs healing potions, so we’ll be doing that. He took some yesterday, for whatever reason — probably fell down some stairs.”
“You two looked like you were enjoying yourself in the bar. Didn’t want to disturb you.” Ron shrugged, and Hermione elbowed him before looking at them sheepishly.
Pulling himself out of his mind and back to reality, he looked into those oddly blank, piercingly green eyes. “There’s a bond, but it’s been formed incorrectly. It goes to nothing, rather than to your mind. I’ll do some reading before next lesson.”
Draco’s mouth tightened imperceptibly. He made a polite excuse and disappeared; Harry didn’t follow.
Harry grimaced at the corpse on the floor — it was a bit anticlimactic, in his opinion, but he wasn’t complaining — and nudged it with his shoe, before swaying slightly; he didn’t have an ounce of power left.
can do it!”
Draco cast a tempus and calculated they’d been asleep for around three and a half hours, but it was still two in the morning - enough for another five hours of sleep at least. “So you just...don’t go back to sleep?”
“That’s all life is! Since when do plans actually…y’know,
He backed up, into a stack. It shifted, and then stilled — and then a chair that had been perched precariously on top fell to the floor with a crash.
She didn’t seem convinced, but couldn’t question him as the new Defence Professor beckoned them inside.
considered occlumency to be a useful skill — and it was getting easier and easier to dissociate from the pain.
“And he
Grumbling, Draco climbed back on the sofa, practically vibrating. When his wand chimed, he shot up, startling Theo so much he dropped his book.
“It’s a shirt. Put it on.”
“Ron ordered some, and it just didn’t taste the same. Stop trying to ruin my fun, Draco.” He pushed Draco’s shoulder. He was always doing that - casual shoulder pushes and nudges with his feet in class when Slughorn fucked something up, a sparkle in his eye when Draco turned his head indignantly.
“If you’re quick, we might only be five minutes late.”
Hermione’s smile had grown wider. “Draco, you really didn’t have to do that; bringing Harry back to us was all the apology we needed, and it showed that your allegiances had truly changed. I forgave you a while ago, but the apology was appreciated nonetheless.” Draco inclined his head as Hemione nudged Ron with her elbow.
Harry had really enjoyed that charms lesson.

always been a light sleeper — that was common knowledge in the Slytherin house.
Voldemort stepped into the cell, vanishing the contents of the bucket with a flick of his wand and presenting Harry with a quill and paper. “Write to your little friends and tell them you’re safe. Don’t try anything, I’ll be watching you the entire time and both me and Lucius will read the letter before it’s sent.”
if someone were to, say, use a disillusionment charm to go down into the dungeons.”
He and Ron had split the weight of the basket, each carrying one side of the handle. They all went out next to the lake, Hermione transfiguring a handkerchief in her pocket (who carries around handkerchiefs? Really? Draco didn’t do that unless he was wearing a suit with a breast pocket for the love of Merlin) into a picnic blanket big enough to seat all four of them. They spread the food out - sandwiches, pies, sausage rolls, chips, various vegetable sticks hummus (which both Harry and Ron turned their noses up at, but Draco and Hermione forced them both to have some anyway), cakes, and a jug of pumpkin juice that automatically refilled. They talked about everything and nothing - Harry and Ron were talking about quidditch, then lessons, then back to quidditch, while Draco and Hermione were talking about the benefits of using opals in healing potions. Really, Draco had been missing out on years of actual
Hence the Malfoy stalking. Well, nobody had called him out on it yet, but Harry was drawn to him in an odd way. Nothing bad - Harry was pretty sure Malfoy wasn’t up to something, and was usually right about these things - but Malfoy looked paler and more closed off than normal, despite four of his friends returning to Hogwarts.
to their magic…” Draco trailed off as his eyes widened. As the Malfoy heir, he had small ties to the wards where they were particularly strong — namely, the lower dungeons. He remembered feeling a prickle since Potter had disappeared - maybe someone was down there. He knew his father had been importing enchanted stone that drained magic. Maybe someone from the other side was down there, and Voldemort wanted information he couldn’t get from leglimency.
“They have sensitive information, and need to be...removed from the equation.”
Harry sighed — he felt defeated. No reason to let them know, though. “What do you think?”
Hermione rolled her eyes and tapped him on the shoulder. “Do you have the location, Ron? Because Draco needs to see it so he knows where to go if anything goes wrong.”
“Why did you have to knock over MY pumpkin juice? It was the first glass out of the jug, which is now empty.” Blaise glared at his glass, and then Draco, while holding an empty jug to his face.
“That — that Harry went on a secret mission with Dumbledore-“
“You don’t have to go out of your way to embarrass me further, Hermione,” Harry grumbled, deliberately not looking at the entrance.
Draco placed a hand on Potter’s arm, ready to withdraw if Potter woke up, but he simply continued to breath quickly, his hands twitching slightly.
Apparently Potter was back to his stalking habits.
He looked up at Malfoy - maybe he’d help, since he’d helped in the bathroom? But his face was oddly slack, his eyes unfocused. He raised his wand at Harry, but his arm shook, in the same way that it did that night on the tower.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, master?” Death appeared, floating above Draco, in long, flowing, black robes.
“You have a bit of gravy here,” Draco said, gently wiping the corner of Harry’s mouth with his thumb while cupping Harry’s jaw with the rest of his hand.
“Yeah, but you two actually follow them.”
“Hypocrite,” Draco muttered.
Harry turned his head left and right, turned on his heel looking for a way out, a broomstick,
Harry held his breath; had he imagined it?
Harry and Draco stepped out of the pub, realising a moment too late that it was hammering it down. “For fuck’s sake, Harry,” Draco muttered, angrily stomping down the lane and evidently forgetting that his arm was still linked with Harry’s, who was dragged along.
“I’m not sure what to think of that,” Draco replied, pressing a hand against his abdomen.
“A little.” Remus placed the plate back in the cupboard before asking, “What are you reading?”
Then, they stopped shouting and Draco’s stomach dropped with dread - he was almost sure what was going to happen, his fears confirmed when the fat man dragged Harry over to a bloodstained corner of the otherwise immaculate garden. Harry dropped to his knees in anticipation of what was going to come - and indeed, the fat man was unbuckling his belt. Draco backed away, further into Harry’s vision - he didn’t want to see Harry’s back cut open. He wasn’t squeamish, as such - he thought he might become a healer later in school - but the purposeful harm of a young child was more than he could stomach.
He took a deep breath and took out —
Hagrid had been forced out with Fang by Umbridge within the first week, but Hermione assured Ginny that he’d reached the Burrow, and had gone to Romania to help Charlie with the dragons. As little love as she harboured for the beasts, especially after seeing them in the triwizard tournament, Ginny couldn’t help but think that he’d gotten the better deal.
Whoops...bit of shade at the end.
“Well, the only thing that comes to mind is the Lost Diadem.”
However, Harry didn’t so much as move from the bed for the majority of the day. Draco finished all of his homework and an entire book, and Harry didn’t so much as move.
Draco was surprised to find that he was feeling
Draco jumped as Severus suddenly hissed in his ear, “You can walk faster than that, you know. I’m not so short that I can’t walk quickly.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s fine.”
Ron yelled, and Ginny immediately came sprinting out, several metres of snake close behind. She shot a couple of spells behind, which enraged the snake, but its several bleeding wounds did not seem to hinder its movement much, if at all.
“Well, there was one legend about a spell that allowed wizards to share magic. It’s called the
They ended up having dinner with Bill and Fleur, before flooing back to Grimmauld, with a bit more hope. Granted, they were woefully outmatched, but they had a
He also had daily baths, at Draco’s insistence, and despite his best efforts, fell asleep in the tub every time, waking in his bed afterwards. He’d given up on complaining about it, after once waking when Draco had been carrying him —
“You had to ask,” Ron muttered.
The four of them had met at the kitchens, neither Ron nor Hermione questioning the fact that they weren’t eating in the hall, likely at Hermione’s orders. Honestly, Draco was terrified of her.
Hermione collapsed, sobbing, and Ron carefully sat down beside her. “‘Mione, you couldn’t have known this was what was going to happen…”
Harry’s mind-voice trailed off at the end, not sure what Draco was going to say. Surely he didn’t want people to think they were dating?
“What are we doing, exactly?”
“Well we needed enough for the shop—”
“You heard me. Now do it.”
He walked into the common room to see Theo, who had always been an early riser, but refused to talk before having his first cup of coffee - a habit he had picked up in sixth year after someone asked the elves to start supplying the breakfast tables with the stuff in the mornings. He wasn’t going to Hogsmeade, as he had become disenchanted with the village after one outing and did all of his shopping using catalogues and owl order (Draco assumed - he’d never seen Theo doing any of this but he always had Christmas presents for his friends and

Draco looked down his nose into the mortar. “It’s...adequate. Stir the water anti-clockwise with one hand and gradually add the egg with the other, then turn down the heat and add the horseradish. Then stir clockwise
“You wanna work together?” Potter asked. His voice was more gravelly than usual, like he’d been screaming. Unlikely, considering how antisocial he’d been throughout the day.
Dumbledore gave him a condescending look. “I thought you agreed not to question me.”
Harry blinked, tensing his muscles to try and get rid of pins and needles tingling across his skin. Apparation remained the most unpleasant method of travel.
- it was 4:30 in the morning. He knew he wasn’t going to get back to sleep with the adrenaline coursing through his veins, so he padded down the stairs of Grimmauld Place to make himself a cup of tea.
“Y’know, the twins are going to be
“Just excited to see my little brother.”
The Weasel and Granger entered the room two minutes later, sliding into the chairs closest to Harry. They shot glares at Draco, but they were...milder than the ones he was used to.
“You made me lose my place!” Theo groaned, glaring daggers at Draco while quickly flicking through his book.
Malfoy had assured him that he’d done the charm wrong, but Harry had been feeling odd emotions all day. An occasional spark of humour, a warm glow that attempted to penetrate the grief that he kept tightly wrapped around his heart for no one to see.
“You’re always wearing them, and I wanted to see what the fuss was about!” Draco slowly turned, lifting his pastel blue jumper to show off the tight black jeans . Harry’s eyes were immediately drawn to his arse, which looked...there were no words for how good it looked.
, Harry thought. “Nope. Hey look, there’s Ron, we can finally go down to breakfast!” Harry wasn’t hungry, despite having been up for four hours, but was happy to change the topic from Malfoy.
Harry sighed. Well, it wasn’t anything he hadn’t already thought about. But he definitely had to get into Hogwarts.

Lucius Malfoy appeared at Malfoy’s ear, whispering
Draco hissed through his teeth — he hadn’t even
“Let me - it’s the least I can do.” Harry looked up into Draco’s eyes from under his lashes, his words barely a whisper. Draco couldn’t identify what he was feeling through the bond.
It turned out that the people working in the archives were more than happy to provide some hair and take the day off, on the condition that the Order at least
To Draco’s relief, Harry leaned into the touch, relaxing further.
Now I have to return it.”
“We could send him an owl under a disillusionment charm, so that it didn’t give away his location.” Hermione bit her lip — she wasn’t sure that Dumbledore would be able to be found by an owl, if he was in hiding. Their magic was good, but not that good.
In his mind, Ron was screaming
The pain abruptly stopped, and Harry uncurled from the floor, his throat sore. Had he screamed? But it didn’t matter, nothing mattered, as he looked up into Draco’s grey eyes.
“Sure, like that means anything.” Bill shook his head, before reaching up and ruffling Ron’s hair. “You’ll always be my little brother.”
Harry asked.
“You can’t even see the shifty little edge bits,” Harry said, running his hands through the glamour, even though you couldn’t tell.
Draco froze, halfway through opening the box.They’d managed to avoid discussing the topic before, but now they were sitting together, and likely would be for the next half an hour or so. A lot had changed in the hours since the charms lesson. He turned to look at Harry - the boy had frozen, and a slow wave of fear was taking over at the other end of the bond.
There was applause throughout the hall at the end of the song, even as Ron muttered out of the side of his mouth “The rhyming’s gotten bad.”
Hermione started to kneel to do
“Which spell?” Harry asked, regretting it immediately as Draco stiffened, and sat upright, carefully smoothing his previously creased brow.
Draco sat on the floor, legs stretched in front of him. He gazed into the fire, watching the flickering embers without really noticing them, his mind whirling with ideas.
The revenge plot was pretty simple, as far as plots for revenge went.
as Umbridge apparated away.
“Well, it’s small, and no one would notice it being missing…I’m willing to bet he has it in that nest of his.”
Severus found himself looking after Remus for three days, after dragging him up to a bed. Forcing him to eat and drink. He still wasn’t quite sure what had happened, but finally coaxed out the reason while internally muttering
He cast a heating charm around the kitchen. Kreacher had died around a year before James had been born, but in his later years had not been very helpful anyway. Harry didn’t have to call down the rest of their family, as they appeared after smelling the enticing of scent of waffles. “Have some fruit as well,” Harry instructed, indicating the bowl of fruit next to the plate with four hot, fresh waffles. Draco and James, who both had very sweet tastes, put strawberries and chocolate sauce on theirs, while Harry and Scorpius both preferred blueberries and small quantities of syrup.
be back by now, he disillusioned Potter -
Draco rolled his eyes and gave in to the incessant tugging, taking his arm back before following a grinning Harry out of the door. Draco grinned at the back of Harry’s head, proud of making him smile like that.
Draco took the flask, and cast the charms. “Follow me.”
.” Harry had said that he might be too — gay, that is — and
He removed himself from Draco’s waist and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to his lips. “Are you asking me to live with you over Christmas?”
She took one deep breath, and then another.
He went down to the common room to stare into the dying embers of the fire for a few hours. He’d really have to start sleeping later - he had far too much spare time in the morning.
“But it was solely because I — I was jealous, of your friendship with Harry. I don’t know if you remember, but — well, in hindsight, it was due to being mean to you, Ron — but Harry rejected me, and it hit hard. I’d never been rejected before, you see, having grown up the little pure–blood Malfoy heir, it shook me to my core, I guess. It doesn’t excuse my actions, but..well, I’ve never admitted that to anyone before, and I thought you guys would appreciate the reason, as shitty as it is. I am sincerely apologising for everything I did at school, and while it certainly can’t cancel out my actions, I hope you can both forgive me, at some point. It is a lot to ask, but…” Draco trailed off, having ran out of words to say. It made him unbearably uncomfortable to be so vulnerable — he hadn’t bared his soul like that to anyone since he came out to his mother — but they deserved it.
“Did he use an incantation?” Hermione asked.
“Be glad that I did, otherwise you’d be wandering around shirtless. In

“He took Kreacher on a boat, and made — made Kreacher drink the potion from a basin, on a tiny island. Kreacher drank it, because Kreacher obeyed his Master and Master told him to obey the Dark Lord. Kreacher drank, and drank…Kreacher’s insides burned…Kreacher cried for his Mistress Black to save him, for Master Regulus to save him, and the Dark Lord l–
Now it was Harry staring at him, defenceless, hands by his side, not a muscle tense. Draco reached into the bond and just felt...acceptance. Draco shook his head no - this was not happening. He would not kill Harry, his soulmate.
The meal was huge and all prepared by Mrs Weasley, as was tradition. They all sat around a magically extended table, in a massive dining room. On this particular day, other than Teddy, only Charlie and his boyfriend were absent, as they were on a three week holiday in South America. This meant there were still nineteen people seated around the dining table, and four separate conversations, one of which was entirely in french between Draco, Fleur and Victoire. Harry was trying to have a conversation with Ron and Bill about some ministry issue between the goblins and the aurors, but every time he heard Draco speak french his mind immediately wandered to
“Come off it Ronald. I’m going to go through the proper routes to the top of the Ministry, purging it of the idiots as I go.”
, Harry said into Draco’s mind.
Harry determinedly shut his mouth, which had been hanging open, as Draco turned back around, and smirked at the light flush spreading across his pale cheeks.
As far as he had seen, Draco wasn’t part of any couple. He spent a lot of time with Parkinson, Bulstrode, Nott and Zabini - but Zabini spent most of his time eyeing up Ravenclaws, Nott spent a lot of time eyeing up Bulstrode, Parkinson spent a lot of time eyeing up her mirror, and Bulstrode’s body language didn’t betray any hidden relationship; nor did Parkinson’s, although she was clearly close with Draco.
“I’m really here. It’s…a weird story.”
“You can’t
“Yes. Yes, you complete and utter prat, we won. And you are
Malfoy smoothly cut him off. “Not that I don’t agree with you, but we have other matters to attend to. Severus, I thought since he was awake, I should do the diagnosis charm that shows his magical core.”
Draco leaned in for another kiss, ignoring the shocked gasps of people in the hallway, in the Great Hall, and whispered against Harry’s lips “Okay, Harry.”
“Dinner runs for two hours, Ron, you’re not going to miss it.” Hermione rolled her eyes.
The kids quickly recounted their story; the missing cat had actually been stolen by the Carrows, and they were all ambushed by a large group of death eaters. They’d been knocked out and regained consciousness in the dungeons, before being lightly tortured for information.
Snape — Severus — rolled his eyes, and took a couple of steps forward to peer at he glowing ball of light hovering just in front of Harry’s abdomen. “He’s got more colours than most people, which is to be expected, since he’s the Chosen One. It’s quite a bit smaller than the average persons — again, expected, since he spent around six weeks in a dungeon that absorbed his magic. Actually, all things considered, it’s not looking that bad. Although I think Draco’s magic may be helping.”
“I mean we share a room already, we’ll just have a bit more space-“
“They don’t have magic!”
“Can you walk?”
“No,” Harry rasped, suddenly aware that he hadn’t eaten or drank anything in…a long time.
Harry grinned, and took another bit of sausage. He was coming more to life with each passing hour.
Harry went and had a very long shower, just standing there and letting the warm water hit the back of his neck. He went back to his room at 5:30, taking his time getting dressed. Malfoy was still in bed, asleep.
They quickly found Tonks’ body; now that she wasn’t using her powers, she was in her natural shape — same colouring as her dad, with dainty, aristocratic features like her mother.
The diadem…it was the least guarded, now. He’d send some more death eaters to patrol the corridors and boundaries tomorrow. And he’d send Bella to reinforce the wards surrounding the castle. No one gets in or out without him knowing.
“I just...it was a bad one. Can you leave me alone?” Harry said, not looking at Draco at all.
Around October, the younger Slytherins had started turning up to the Room. They hadn’t had it as bad, since the Carrows and Umbridge foolishly believed that everyone in the house supported their views and there were no muggleborns in there, but after they started trying to take punches and punishments for the few students from other houses that remained, while refusing to tell anyone where the others had disappeared to, they were treated as badly as the rest.
“Well, that doesn’t make him right.”

would be at Christmas.
“‘Mione, we can’t do anything right now, so we’re just going to have to trust Harry’s word. That is his handwriting, isn’t it?”
, the electric shock, or the cold.
Weasel perked up. “We have charms with him next!”
A month and a half isn’t actually that long, but I’ve never been very good at sticking to projects anyway, and am quite proud of myself for not abandoning this. I’m currently writing a short fic that’s being posted on my instagram, but I will be posting the completed thing on here once it’s done.
Harry hastily blinked away the tears blurring his vision, not noticing the transformation of the memorial until he’d opened his eyes for the third time. The small obelisk had disappeared, replaced by a statue of a couple, holding a baby. The woman had long hair and a kind face with delicate features, while the man was a spitting image of Harry. That meant the baby…
Harry trudged out, his school uniform draped over one arm, Draco already in bed. He raised an eyebrow at Harry as he got into bed.
sounded behind her. She turned on reaction, for a split second, trying to catch a glimpse out of the corner of her eye to see if it was friend or foe, to judge the threat, not seeing the bolt of green light heading towards her back.
Muttered swears and curses rippled around the room. A couple of people looked as if they were ready to argue, but McGonagall stood before any of them could even open their mouths. “Albus’ death is a tragedy. But he dedicated his life to fighting against evil, and we will continue that fight today, and tomorrow, and every day after that until the fight is won. We cannot let his death weaken us — we must mourn, and forge that sadness into strength, to take down Dolores Umbridge, and the rest of those complete and utter…dicks!”
Draco walked backwards into the room, bringing Harry with him, until his legs hit the side of a bed. Harry kept walking and the pair ended up sprawled on the bed, tangled in each other.
Looking back, he was very sure Dumbledore had known - why else would he have put up wards to stop Harry from running away? - and Snape probably found out during those occlumency lessons, if he hadn’t guessed from what he knew about Petunia’s situation before then, but Harry had made sure that no one else knew. Harry had had no intention of making other people worry.
“They won’t want to see me, you know.”
- he’d nervously thanked them and sighed in relief as they left. The rest of the table was laughing at him, refusing to tell him
the Dursleys were. Specifically, Vernon Dursley, as he dragged Harry by the arm to his cupboard.
Draco shrugged and said “okay,” putting the plate on the far end on his bedside table.
His legs seemed a bit useless, with deep cuts in his thighs. Good job he wasn’t going anywhere.
“Ah, Draco, you’re just in time. There’s a village of…
childhood, but there were bones that had been previously broken multiple times and hadn’t healed properly, based on how the bones formed slightly crooked shapes, and raised tissue where scars had built up over time.
Hermione held her breath Voldemort apparated to the island, walking swiftly past them. “He can’t see or hear us, you know,” Ron nudged her.
Harry didn’t know how long it had been anymore. He didn’t know who brought his food, or how often it was arriving. He was weak, barely able to sit up to drink some water, and always shivering.
Sure enough, red eyes met his, and the Dark Lord nodded at him. Severus swiftly made his way to the right, listening intently to the conversation.
“Here. Your dorm is further than mine.” Harry removed his warm cloak in one smooth movement, and in another was fastening it around Draco’s shoulders - even though he was a couple of inches taller, the cloak was just long enough, and he stopped shivering almost immediately. Harry should have been cold, but the heat of Draco’s stare warmed him plenty.
“You can bring it a bit closer, y’know,” Harry said. Ron looked at him doubtfully, but dragged it over a bit more, so he was about five feet away. Harry nodded at him, and he smiled slightly before sitting down.
“The bank ledgers. They’re on the fourth floor — hidden, of course, but not very well. They have records of everything in the Black vaults and, somehow, every family we’ve married into. So all the pureblood accounts, basically. If Bellatrix has something in one of her accounts, you’ll be able to see there.”
“Harry,
The last thing Draco remembered before drifting off to sleep again was the feel of Harry’s fingers gently combing through his hair, and that
They walked into Flitwick’s room. Draco tried to take a chair in the back corner, like he usually did, but Harry dragged him to the front, with the wall on one side and Harry on his left.
“Shut up, the pair of you.” The eye-roll was audible in Severus’ voice. “You’ll survive a small amount of time on the floor—”

were you doing in Voldemort’s mind?” Hermione asked angrily as soon as she sat down.
Draco jumped out of bed, taking one step across the room to Harry’s bed.
Just as they were putting the last potion on to boil — seventeen minutes exactly, otherwise it wouldn’t work — they were called down to the dining room, and immediately dismissed.
“Blaise, no.” Draco glared at Blaise, still irritated from the quidditch comment. It wasn’t that dangerous!
He knew that the cell was draining his magic, but hadn’t noticed for what he estimated was around forty–eight hours. Now, between the draining magic, thirst and hunger, he was constantly plagued with headaches and shivers.
Draco took a breath, and his pulse restarted.
Draco thought,
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s lips thinned, but he bit into a chunk of bread and took a small sip of water, chewing slowly. “I look forward to it.” The five words caused a sharp pain in Harry’s throat, but it was worth it to see the smug look wiped off Lucius’ face.
The next morning, to Draco’s surprise, Harry asked if it was okay for Hermione and Ron to join them for lunch outside. It was a beautiful - the last dregs of September were still in the atmosphere, crisp leaves on the ground, warm sunshine beating down, but a breeze hinted at the winter to come.
He really hadn’t meant to not put up his silencing charm - it was the first night since he’d stopped taking dreamless sleep that he’d forgotten. It was weird that he’d let his guard down more with Draco than with himself - it must have been the soup. Chicken and sweetcorn was his favourite.
“Both.” Harry’s voice was barely a whisper, after the shouting and crying.
Malfoy shot a glare at her, before taking a couple of steps towards Harry. Harry tried not to react at the wave of warmth and comfort that came with the proximity of Malfoy’s magic, but was quite sure he let out a little sigh anyway. Malfoy raised an eyebrow in amusement, before pointing his wand directly at Harry’s chest. He heard Ron and Hermione gasp slightly, but surprisingly, he didn’t feel any fear.
had a silent conversation. Ron was really getting fed up of everyone communicating through glances.
“Since you wrote such a lovely letter, we thought we’d provide some food and water.” The voice grated against Harry’s nerves, but he forced himself to sit up and take a sip from the bucket of water. His headache slowly ebbed away, and he drank a little more. Grasping a piece of stale bread from the plate, he looked up into the cold face of Lucius Malfoy. “I personally would have left you down here to rot, but the Dark Lord wants to keep you alive. Maybe to kill you at a later date.”
Draco sighed and didn’t deny the question. That’s how, for the second time in twenty-four hours, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter ended up hugging on a bed, although this time it was both of them with tears streaming down their faces.
“How about we sleep on it? We’re all tired and we’ve been at it for ages.” Ron said.
“Yeah.” Potter sighed softly. “Haven’t had one in a while. Turns out I was just too tired.”
Harry ate a decent amount of food - an egg and half a piece of toast, and then he pinched some of Draco’s fruit - cut into perfectly even pieces - as well, much to his dismay. He often got a sharp elbow in his side for his troubles, but it was a small price to pay for the flush that crept up Draco’s neck afterwards.

, for Merlin’s sake.”
“Magicorae revelium,” he murmured, moving his wand in a weird corkscrew motion, before pulling it away from Harry, towards his abdomen. At the abrupt jerking motion, Harry felt the ball of warmth — his core — moving outwards slightly, while still remaining inside. Like a shadow of it passed outside. He looked down, and his eyes widened in surprise at the sight of the threads of magic, pulsing gently in a sphere around the size of his fist. They were in every colour — rich scarlets, bright purple, shimmering blues and greens all weaving in and out of a bright sphere of light.
“I was excited to see you!”
“My magic is doing what?”
Then, just as abruptly as it started, it stopped.
he thought, walking to potions,
Draco continued into the ‘Common Room’ - distastefully cluttered with chairs of all shapes and sizes, although there was at least a colour scheme. Purple wasn’t the best colour - Draco couldn’t help but think the room would look great with green accents rather than purple, even if he is rather biased - but at least it wasn’t Gryffindor red. He looked at the names, becoming increasingly panicky as he didn’t see his name, but there is was, next to-
Two loud cracks echoed either side, as the other two death eaters apparated.

“That’s an idea, Harry - there is an unnerving lack of swearing coming from his room. Talk tomorrow, okay?”
“I think you just don’t exude much ambient magic, rather than having compatible magic.”
“I thought, as an adult, you were supposed to be a
“So do I just stand next to you? I’ve never done this before.”
Harry smiled. Draco had noticeably relaxed now, engaging in conversation with Dean about nothing in particular. Seamus eyed Draco up, clinging obviously onto Dean’s arm, but Harry noticed that it was more to do with romantic jealousy than prejudice against the Slytherin.

Flitwick looked disheartened, but said “Of course not - you two can tell people when you’re ready.”
Harry looped his arms around Draco’s neck, kissing him fiercely - and it was better, so much better than the dream, because this was real, and Draco was under his hands, soaked to the skin and solid and
“The Three Broomsticks? Really?” Harry knew Draco hadn’t been out much into the wizarding world, and had noted his discomfort in Honeydukes.
Hermione turned around with an exasperated expression. “What is it, Ron?”
Just before Harry went upstairs, he pulled Remus aside.
Thanks to Narcissa’s connection to the wards on the Manor, she knew Voldemort was the only living person in there, but the wards couldn’t detect any inferi; in any case, they were nothing a bit of fire couldn’t handle.
The conversation continued for hours, making plans for the next few days, figuring out how to get in touch with various Order members, who to invite to the first meeting, and other things. Severus mentioned that he’d have to be spending more time making healing potions, if this is what they were getting into, and remembered about Remus’ werewolf problem. He volunteered to make wolfsbane, but realised if he was to be spending this much time brewing, he probably wouldn’t have time to teach the kids defence. Remus agreed to take that over, three times a week.
He asked Draco, to which he replied
They arrived at their floor with a pleasant
A flash of silver, and glistening droplets of blood sprayed across the seemingly impenetrable cave face. A  bright white light shone across what Harry assumed would be the outline of a door, but Harry fell to his knees, clutching his head as his scar burned.
Everyone around the table gasped.
Voldemort growled “
It did not, however, prevent Harry from the flashes of the dead in the Great Hall. This was so, so much worse than the corridors. Harry focused on keeping his breaths even, keeping his feet moving, following Ron and Hermione on the opposite side of the tables - it wouldn’t do for all three of them to be on the same side.
The rest of the lesson progressed in a similar manner, with Draco ordering Harry around and generally being condescending.
On top of that, he’d barely spared a look in Draco’s direction - a sharp contrast from the stalking of sixth year. Draco had almost missed it, until bright green eyes were staring in his direction once again.
, Harry thought, glad that Malfoy hadn’t moved his stuff to get the window bed.
“-Harry? Harry! Are you even listening?”
Hermione nodded thoughtfully. Once again, silence settled over the table, only broken by the sound of cutlery against ceramic, and after a while, the sound of talons tapping against the window.
Overall, Draco had rather preferred his private meals with Harry, but this was worth it - not only because Harry was slowly becoming more social, but also because when he was around his friends his eyes gradually gained the light they’d once had, he smiled for freely and those casual touches that Draco lived for increased significantly. Furthermore, the density of the shadows around Harry’s mind decreased, at least while they were conversing.

“I don’t think so.”
“I’ll have a lot of fun. Don’t know about you.” Greyback grinned, showing yellow teeth and various black holes where teeth were missing.

Manipulating the wards in the Forbidden Forest had been ridiculously easy. It was as if the old forest was helping him unravel the dark magic. Getting past the death eaters posted nearby was also easy, since they weren’t paying attention — just complaining about their shitty assignment.
Harry cut off as Draco’s glamours were removed. His shoulders were slumped, head down - the boy looked completely and utterly defeated. It broke Harry’s heart - he’d never seen the haughty, sneering boy without his chin in the air, a sparkle in his eye. He was bleeding from a cut on his cheek and his nose, and the other cheek was mottled with bruises. He went to Draco’s trunk to get the dittany and salve, turning to see that Draco was just in his trousers. His back was littered with cuts and bruises, and as he watched some of Draco’s ribs snapped back in place. Draco turned around, and Harry saw his front was quite similar to his back - Harry cringed to think of hard boots sinking into Draco’s pale, soft flesh.
Harry told himself, effectively shutting up the annoying little voice.
“Harry, out with it. You have been out ‘studying’ every night for the last three weeks! Who are you shagging?”
“Tell that to the gravy on your face.” Harry smirked as Draco started scrubbing furiously at his face, completely missing the spot of gravy. “You missed it.”
Draco trudged back up to their room, shoulder muscles hurting from tensing with stress for the last twenty-four hours. Harry’s mind was still completely blocked off.
“We do - but not you.” Arthur looked at Molly, who nodded. He turned to the twins. “You have polyjuice in your room, right?”
difficult, even for an idiot such as yourself…”
Remus took a deep breath, as the last of the Order filed in. Bill laid a hand on his shoulder and nodded, murmuring under his breath, “it’ll be fine.”
“Are you
He curled into a foetal position on his bed, trembling, whimpering slightly at the headache. It was too close to the aching of his scar for Harry’s liking. “He’s not back, there were no more horcruxes, he’s dead” Harry whispered, a mantra to drive the nightmare away from reality.
“Well, I’m glad you came back. As are Ron, and Hermione, and the rest of the wizarding world. Just remember that, and never think otherwise.” Harry smiled up at Draco, before turning and leaning into his side, eating some bread. Draco took some too, and eventually the pair ended up asleep like that, legs tangled together.
It turned out that one of the aurors had originally worked in the archives, and still had contacts there. He knew that Umbridge had taken some files into her office, but the majority would still be there. The archives were huge, but most of it was tracking crimes and finances, so they estimated five people with satchel bags to shrink and place documents in, maximum, plus two more — one for fighting, and one to sneak into Umbridge’s office, as Umbridge, and remove the additional files from there.
A voice that sounded an awful lot like Sirius spoke in the back of his mind.
?” Harry pulled his pillow over his face and flopped back onto the bed.
“The Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw?” Luna raised an eyebrow, and Harry shook his head. “Well, it’s like a small tiara that would bestow the wearer increased knowledge and wisdom — or so the legend says. It’s actually pretty famous, but it’s also been lost for centuries.”
Draco grinned in delight, his eyes glinting. “You wish.”
“Really. We saw Madame Umbridge apprehend someone trying to break into her office not five minutes ago.”
Thinking of Hogwarts, he’d need some people in there. He knew Dolores Umbridge had worked there as the Defence teacher, so she would have a good knowledge of the school, and she’d embraced all of her duties in the Ministry wholeheartedly, despite not being under the imperius curse. She’d make a fine headmistress.
“We should — probably — be a bit — quicker,” Draco panted, feet pounding on the dry grass. “DUCK!” he added, and two flashes of green flew over their heads.

He’d deal with the bad injuries first, and after the war — after they’d
Harry laughed, pressing another kiss to Draco’s lips. Draco smiled in return at the pure, unfiltered joy that Harry sent down the bond. Now, instead of shadows, Harry’s mind was often lit up by some inner light. He still had his off days - his therapist said they would never truly go - but Draco and Harry worked through them together.
The next page was their wedding. Next to Harry’s parents was Sirius, arm in arm with Remus. In fact, they also looked like a couple - how had Harry never noticed before? He cast a silencing charm before moving his gaze, tears pricking his eyes.
“Well they can’t trap
, you get along great with the Gryffindors.”
He brushed his teeth and emerged from the bathroom. It had been two hours since he’d woken up, meaning he had another four hours in which to contemplate his existence.
Potter mimicked Draco’s expression, raising one eyebrow, before rocking back on his chair (that boy is a hazard) and saying “I could leave.”
“Only Harry and I could get into them, or even find them, since they’re keyed to the Head of the family or anyone born directly into the line. Not to mention, we aren’t exactly sure which ones Bellatrix knows about,” Narcissa pointed out.
Bright light blinded Harry as Draco removed the spell keeping the cloth bound around Harry’s eyes. It took him a couple of moments before he realised where he was; Godric’s Hollow.
Malfoy cleared his throat. “Sir, the bonding lesson has had an...unexpected outcome.”
“I’m up, I’m up, you little terror,” Draco said, ruffling James’ hair affectionately. The four-year-old had kept up the tradition of looking exactly like the Potters, with messy, jet-black hair and caramel skin. However, his eyes were a light shade of grey, identical to Draco’s.
And then Harry was on his knees in the unforgiving ground outside, because “nasty little freaks don’t deserve to kneel in the grass”, biting through his lip even after he tasted blood as Vernon’s belt landed again, and again, and again…
Draco murmured, waving his wand in a Celtic knot movement before flicking his wand upwards. “Do you know how to occlude, Potter?”
Draco was clearly relieved about the neutral topic. “She’s also making me sit there, so you won’t have to suffer alone.”
Harry jolted awake and immediately ran around the house. It was six in the morning, and no one appreciated being woken up, but they quickly straightened at Harry’s news.
He opened his eyes wider, accustomed to a bit of light filtering through the drapes, reaching out an arm towards his wand, when his hand hit a wall far sooner than it should have.
As he skimmed the lines of text, which were horridly small and in cursive, of all things, his gaze kept drifting to Harry. He still remembered how he’d reached for Draco in his sleep as he’d had left the bed, the little whimper that had escaped his mouth. Draco had almost stayed, but as his stomach rumbled, he settled for a small warming charm. If he smiled fondly as Harry relaxed and burrowed a little further under the duvet, looking surprisingly adorable…well, no one needed to know that.
Not seeing any reason to reply, Harry marched out of the room. Getting down the stairs was odd — he hadn’t
Until then, she would watch.
Granger sounded shocked. “But — but that’s blood magic! That’s

swing a sword around?”
“Why not?”
This pain - this pain was a thousand times worse than whatever Bellatrix could conjure. Because this pain - the physical pain was nothing, compared to the coldness and apathy in those eyes, the heartbreak that actually made his chest hurt with the pain of it. He barely registered the
I’ll — I’ll do anything.”
“Brill! See, I told you not to go to McGonagall. What does it say then?”
“Harry! Why are you so late?” The Weasel waved at Harry.
“Is that so?”
He turned into a corridor that was empty other than a gaggle of fifth years. They all glared at him - it was disconcerting to have six pairs of eyes, all glaring at him - but he deliberately kept walking, steps not faltering.
“Come on, get into bed, you skinny git. I bet you haven’t had any dinner either.” Potter shook his head, and Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ll get Granger and the Weasel to bring you some food.” He turned, but felt a spark of panic from Potter, and turned to face him. He was vigorously shaking his head, and repeatedly whispering “no”.
him. Perhaps seeing Harry wouldn’t bring up any good reactions — Harry knew all about PTSD, at this point — and since Harry didn’t have to stay close to Draco anymore, perhaps he wanted to stay in separate rooms. He probably didn’t return Harry’s feelings, anyway. Maybe one–sided true love was enough to break the effects of the potion.
he was leaving after
They decided the shed they’d placed under the fidelius would be the place to store the documents, so no one outside of the Order could get to them, and left the fully–sized documents in several large, neatly stacked piles, before placing several charms to ensure they would sustain no weather damage. Percy apparated away as soon as he saw the rest of his siblings, mumbling something to Bill about “needing to cover absences in the auror department.”
He’d already wandered down to the entrance to the dungeons twice, and there always seemed to be a death eater at the entrance, which was irritating, to say the least.
“You should really get better with the glamours if you don’t want anyone to notice them, you know,” Draco said, carefully straightening the parting of his hair. He no longer put gel in it, favouring loose waves, but that doesn’t mean he could leave it like Harry’s.
“Ask me what?” Hermione jumped, her hand instinctively going for her wand as she spun around. At the sight of Malfoy, she sighed and sat back down. A glance at Ron revealed that Ron was sneering with disgust at him. It was just childish of him, at this point — Malfoy had brought Harry back, for goodness sake. Perhaps they shouldn’t trust the Slytherin indubitably, but they could at least be civil and give him the benefit of the doubt.
“He was in denial,” she replied shortly. Weasley scoffed beside her, and received yet another stamp for his efforts. “I’ll talk to him - just be at dinner, I’ll make sure he’s there.”
Harry, Ron and Hermione gasped.

Draco tapped his parchment. “
“I think there’s someone from Potter’s side in the dungeons that the Dark Lord is keeping alive.”
“That’s why I get you to do it,” Harry muttered under his breath, turning to the Professor at the front of the room.
“Well a lot of people lost people in the war, and they deal with it differently. For some people, that means using me as their punchbag.”
, who looked rather smug. Draco knew Theo was going to spend the thirty galleons on books which Draco won’t be allowed to borrow.
Draco didn’t know why he was surprised. Even when he was stalking Draco in sixth year, Potter didn’t have a clue about Draco’s main plan (which he
Myself and detectivetalos came up with Carnes Consuo for our joint fic, Pinky Promises, which is an AU set in Harry’s third year where Remus finds out about the Dursleys :)

“You sound like Hermione!”
After an agonising wait, Harry and Draco had been dragged out, while Hermione and Ron were left alone. Draco was untied, and his eye had taken on a malicious glint. Harry’s head had been roughly pulled back by his hair, exposing his face for the death eaters to see. This time, he hadn’t had a stinging hex distorting his face, but Draco had been brought forward all the same. He wasn’t terrified, as Harry would have expected - rather, Harry saw nothing but cold calculation in those grey eyes.
Harry shouted, “
Satisfied that he had his answer, and less satisfied that the boy was a horcrux, Voldemort pulled out of the boy’s mind.
Draco did eventually get up to get Harry a proper meal - he’d eaten a bit of the bread but he needed nutrition. The elves were all too happy to see him, giving him a basket too heavy to carry. He dragged it back up, and the pair ate about half of the food in their room. Harry, surprisingly, ate quite a lot - before, if he hadn’t eaten in a while he wouldn’t eat much, but now Draco was satisfied to see the effect of regular meals on his appetite.
“I’d say one of the secret passages, but I don’t know how they’d react to wizard magic. I could probably get through them, but we’d need a big distraction.”
Finishing off the bread, he went to the bathroom. The door was a bit jammed, so Draco threw his shoulder against it, a bit suspicious, but it easily gave way.
After Harry had again told Draco to go away that evening, Draco took drastic action.
After being sure that Draco had left, he moved to relieve himself, before climbing back into bed and closing the drapes.
“Draco, could I borrow you for a minute?”
“No.”
the old man’s fault — Severus had had terrible choice in friends during his years at Hogwarts — but the idea of actually being able to do something
They continued along those lines for the rest of the lesson, occasionally bickering out loud or waving their wands to hide the bond.
He made a mental note to get Mrs Weasley something extra special for Christmas this year.
Malfoy clearly shared the same sentiment, as he rolled his eyes and drawled, “no, Grang—Hermione, I actually
If he didn’t move until he knew Harry was waking up…no one would know, anyway.
“I’m just going to...sit down for a minute. Will you do the…” Dumbledore trailed off, holding out the little crystal cup to Harry and sitting against the rock the basin was mounted on.
“Now, the lunch break is in fifteen minutes, which is the best time to go in. Are you all ready?” Millie asked. Narcissa and Severus nodded, and they all went outside to apparate to Diagon Alley.
Severus had demoted him to the floor and taken the stool, although not before transfiguring it into a rather nice sofa. Draco sat as far away from Weasley as possible, even if that did mean sitting next to Gr–
Harry didn’t know what to do with himself on Halloween this year. Previously, he’d always been busy - between trolls, Death-day parties, ‘mass murderers’, trials, Umbridge, quidditch and being on the run, Harry had never had much time to consider what this day meant to him. At the Dursley’s, he’d always nicked some sweets from Dudley if he could get away with it - often Bounties and Parma Violets, which Dudley said ‘tasted like soap’ and ‘weren’t real sweets’, but Harry liked them all the same. He’d found out that his parents had died on Halloween when Hagrid had picked him up, but had always put off mourning until the day after due to whatever happened that year - last year he hadn’t fully realised he’d missed the anniversary until he and Hermione went to Godric’s Hollow that Christmas - and even then Nagini had prevented him from fully taking his time. This year, none of that was in his way. Halloween was on a Saturday, so he didn’t even have lessons. He’d do his homework tomorrow.
“And he awakes.”
Harry turned to look at Draco, who shrugged in turn. They didn’t even need words to communicate at this point.

before occluding, ready for bed.
“We have not.” Draco looked quite smug, as did Flitwick. Harry realised why as he saw gold flash between him and McGonagall.
“Bat.”
Remus to act with hostility — they’d been perfectly civil when they’d both been teaching, even if Remus had probably suspected that Severus had leaked his being a werewolf (he hadn’t — it had been nice to have someone his age to talk to in the staff room, and he would never stoop so low anyway,) but Severus still found himself checking his expression, making sure it was neutral, as the door opened.
“It’s just...I’ve always suppressed those memories as much as possible while at Hogwarts. Suppressing them...it allows me to live life freely. But I think now, I’m just suppressing too much. It doesn’t...they won’t stay down.”
“The stones are really powerful. Just take him, we don’t have much time.”
I’ve got the spell down,” Draco mumbled under his breath, his fingers tracing a delicate pattern on the parchment as his grey eyes scanned the pages, oblivious to Harry watching him from the other side of the bed.
“Well look at this. I’ve seen it before, as well — Dumbledore showed me.”
“No no, Ron will be there, head of the aurors.” Harry patted Ron’s shoulder.
Harry’s head snapped upwards to look into red eyes. “What have you done?”
“Thank you, my Lord. I am most grateful.”
risky. The sharer’s magic has to be extremely compatible with the other wizard—”
Narcissa exited the room in a swirl of silk robes, leaving everyone scrambling to keep up. She quickly ascended the stairs, eventually coming to a stop at an old portrait of a simple landscape. It was masterfully done — light from nearby torches flickered, making it look as if the water was moving, but it was just that; a trick of the light. Which meant—
Apologies for the formatting of the gravestone, it is 10:30pm and I am very tired. The words on the gravestone and the sign are taken directly from the Deathly Hallows, and the origin of The Tale Of The Three Brothers is from Beedle the Bard (jk, credit to the tale goes to J.K.Rowling who’s transphobic views I do not support in the slightest). I wrote it from memory which is why it’s a bit different.
Malfoy and Snape hadn’t
At least the one member of his adopted family wasn’t evil.
. With Umbridge in charge, who had said all detentions were to be had with the Carrows, and was constantly assigning them for no reason, there was almost no way to avoid them. Quidditch was cancelled, Hogsmeade trips were cancelled, nobody was learning anything related to the syllabus, as the teachers often spent their time trying to console their students, or teaching them ways to avoid the Carrows and who to go to, and most people skipped at least one meal a day. Everyone had agreed that this was
Silence hung around the table, and Harry’s thoughts drifted. To think, he should have been going on the Hogwarts Express, in one week, for his seventh year. As if he could have anything resembling a vaguely normal life.
“Sorry I woke you up.” Potter murmured.
He stood up and looked, to see the whole class staring at him in awe, his Professor clapping his hands together. “Brilliant! Splendid! Marvellous!”
Something indecipherable flickered across Severus’ face before he continued. “True love has the power to override the bond, although I’m not sure about removing it,” he sneered, “but even if there was a less lethal way to remove it, Miss Granger, I would advise against it. Potter would likely die without it — at least, before his magical core heals. The best thing to start with would be to find out how to do spells to monitor Potter’s vitals, magical core, and start brewing more healing potions. I brought as much as I could with me, of course, but we’ll need to start brewing as soon as possible.”
“Anyway, here’s your meal.” Lucius threw another two slices of stale wholemeal bread. “The Dark Lord doesn’t want you to die, apparently.”
“Fuck off, Ron.” Harry waved his arms and turned over as Ron opened the drapes around his bed.
Just to post this and reply to the comments I’ve received that I still need to read lmao.
had he not noticed before) — a reedy voice echoed through the room.
The atmosphere in Hogwarts was
Harry pulled the pillow back, pressing soft kisses to Draco’s neck and jaw. “We both know how much you like bottoming.”
Everyone else was gormlessly staring at the exchange, Harry included. Since when were these two friends?
Everyone got their heads down, the room lit by a ball of light hovering in the centre of the room. Minuted passed, then hours, the silence only interrupted by the rustling of paper and long sighs, often followed by a bout of coughing as they inhaled too much dust.
Hermione sighed. “No luck, and we’ve gone through the most disgusting books in the Black library.”
After twenty minutes Harry was quite bored, had finished his food and felt he had an adequate amount of bread and butter, so he announced he was going to turn in for the night. There were a couple of looks of surprise, but they relaxed when he said he was “just catching up on all the sleep I should have got last year.”
All at once, the pain stopped. “Interesting. So we can cast at you, but you can’t cast at us.” Voldemort lazily flicked his wand at Harry, causing a deep cut to appear on his cheek, before leaving.
Harry gazed longingly at the last slice of stale bread on the floor of his cell. He’d eaten the first slice about an hour ago, but his stomach felt like it was digesting itself. Relenting, Harry grabbed the last slice, glad that at least he wouldn’t have a shortage of water — the bucket appeared to constantly refill. Harry nibbled at the bread before taking a big swig of water — he’d learnt at the Dursley’s that drinking constantly with a meal made you full quicker. It temporarily kept the gnawing pain at bay, at least.
Severus kept his face carefully neutral, mulling over the words. From the sounds of that, the death eater in question could likely be a potential candidate for Dumbledore’s side. If the codger ever got back from whatever secret assignment he and Potter were on.
“Well, we’re living in weird times, Ron.”
Harry checked his own stance. He was exhausted, but not in a way food or sleep could fix. He was slightly slouching, shoulders curling inwards, and his face was devoid of emotion. Better than not being there at all, Harry figured, not caring enough to sort himself out.
Ron huffed softly before answering — even in a situation like this, Hermione was looking to use new spells. “Don’t think so.”
Flitwick came over and swiftly erected a silencing charm before squeaking “Boys! Since you already have a bond, I’d like you to test it - try communicating using it, perhaps.” With that, he removed the charm with a flick of his wand and moved on to question another pair.
Draco wondered if Harry would be wanting this particular one back. “What time is it, Blaise?”
“Leave you alone?! Have you met the pointy git?”
“Evidently not” muttered Draco, attention on a dark haired figure sauntering into the room.
the little voice in Harry’s head said, thankfully no longer sounding like Snape.
Harry nodded, and took another bite of his bread, which was surprisingly good. Then again, once you get used to mouldy bread, any bread tastes good.
,” Dumbledore added as Harry opened his mouth to object. “You must keep your wand out, in case Voldemort comes before we’ve got the horcrux. I need you to force me to drink it, even if I say no. You

.” Draco heard some fabric shift — probably Severus showing them the Dark Mark. “This is a

“It’s not
Potter was gazing down at his food, pushing it around with his fork and occasionally bringing a bit to his mouth. Nothing like the gusto he usually had. He looked a bit pale, as if he hadn’t left the house, but it looked odd from Draco’s angle - a glamour. It shifted slightly around his robes too. Potter was a powerful wizard, but had no talent for delicate spells - it was a strong glamour, but could easily be spotted by someone used to seeing them. It was similar to the ones his mother had used on his father when back from Azkaban - Draco wondered what Potter had to hide. Maybe he’d find out.
It was doing Harry a great deal of good - he’d gotten used to the hall, at long last, at the start of November (he’d outright refused to do anything on Halloween, but thankfully the pair were quite understanding considering that that was the day his parents had died). He didn’t feel as anxious, talking to people outside of his group, since Draco was always there to help him. He hadn’t gone to the October Hogsmeade weekend, but Hermione and Draco had insisted that they all go down on the November weekend.
Her eyes flashed darkly as she began talking. “The Ministry has taken all power away from the governors, making the Wizemgot in charge of staffing. Thankfully, they haven’t fired any of us yet, but they’ve put the Carrows twins in as professors,” gasps were heard from all around the room, and McGonagall nodded darkly, “and
Ginny screamed, advancing on the snake and casting spell after spell. Chunks of wood flew around as some of her spells went wide, but she managed to distract the snake long enough for Ron to grab Bill and get him out of the shed.
They arrived at the potions classroom just as the class were entering the room, and Ron and Harry joined the line of eight years - they were red-faced and panting, but on time.
Harry nodded.
) before sighing and lying back down on his bed. Tomorrow was going to be terrible. And Potter would never sit next to him again.
Wow, okay, that took…a while. Thank you all for reading!!
“You’re not so bad yourself, Potter,” Draco said to the silence.
One good thing came out of the fanbase - Draco always got a giggly warning whenever Potter was nearby.
Remus thought about it, burying his grief and guilt. He’d only encountered Draco in lessons — he’d always acted up, likely because of his father’s beliefs. But now that he was away from Lucius — he’d probably been forced to do something that he wasn’t happy about — he might actually grow into a
, Draco realised, registering the still hand buried in his hair and the soft breaths sounding above him. He opened his eyes, seeing through his blurry vision a spotless bathroom. He hoped, for a second, that last night had been a dream, except why would he be asleep in the bathroom, on Harry’s lap, with his arm in a bowl of bloody liquid?
“There’s no point in feeling guilty, you’ve had your own shit on. Anyway,” he said, clearing his throat dramatically while unfurling the letter, “this needs to be read.”
Draco thought, his eyes) and how he hadn’t “had a proper butterbeer in over a year, Draco, how ridiculous is that?”
Resigned to his situation for the while, Harry curled up on the cold floor, shivering from either the
Hermione frowned as she tried to remember Grimmauld, her face lighting up when she couldn’t. “Yes.”
“No, Draco, it is. I was his ‘secret weapon’ — of course he wasn’t going to tell anyone about me. Carry on, Mrs. — Narcissa.”
“Anything remotely interesting happen? When did you get a new cloak?” Blaise fingered Harry’s cloak.
He cleaned it with a quick charm from his wand and examined it curiously.
Kreacher snarled, spitting out every word. “It has a silver chain, with a big green shiny and a letter on, and Master Regulus trusted Kreacher with it, so you shall not be having it!”
Draco’s eyes widened with realisation, his lips thinning before looking around. Everyone was getting out of their seats and levitating the desks to the side. Harry and Draco followed suit, glad that they had a corner seat as they could watch everyone else.
bad, really — they distracted him from his grief, whether it be with conversation or a quick fuck.
On the bright side, rumours of the Saviour shagging a Slytherin could only boost their reputation.
Harry nudged Draco as his alarm vibrated. “Honey, we need to get up.”
“Are you two going to argue, or are we going to breakfast?” Hermione glared at them both, who looked sheepish and sped up, Ron holding Hermione’s hand.
“Your range of vocabulary is limitless.”
“It doesn’t look like its time–consuming, just physically taxing, so tomorrow evening at the latest.”
Ron sighed. “Ok so what, we’re going to do it now?”
, for Merlin’s sake! Looking at the little kids running around the school now, it made Harry feel sick to his stomach. Even the fourth years seemed titchy - that was when he’d seen Voldemort return. Looking back, he saw that he’d been manufactured into a weapon. Not that that hadn’t started with the Dursley’s - that recklessness demonstrated a lack of value for his own life.
Thankfully, Potter was already there, although he looked terrible. Taking a couple of deep breaths, he examined the bloodshot eyes contrasting with the green irises, the even-more-dishevelled-than-usual hair, the paleness under his caramel skin and the mud on his robes. He looked like he’d been crying then gone outside for a mud bath.
The corridors he walked down were almost oppressive in their cleanliness, shiny wooden furniture and blindingly white walls closing in as he checked plaques for Umbridge’s name. He knew, approximately, where the office was, but if she’d moved…he couldn’t afford to waste time.
Sure enough, Harry’s hand wrapped around his wrist. “No you will not. You don’t count as ‘anyone’.”
Severus didn’t show his confusion, sweeping down and picking Draco up. “Time to go,” he hissed, before dragging him to his room. He saw Narcissa nod her thanks out of the corner of his eye, and smiled slightly as he exited. Not only did he know Draco had a mind of his own, which was a relief in itself, but if he could get him out, Draco could be a valuable ally to the other side.
Harry nodded sadly, as she gently patted his knee and went back to the pile of parchment. “So Draco, you’ll have to learn some healing charms as well. Just the basics —
“He doesn’t look like he’s in any state to apparate
“Professor! Glad you could make it.” Bill smilEd welcomingly, gesturing to the table. “Make yourself at home, pasta will be ready in a bit.”
“Just two more to go, sir.”
Smiling grimly, Bill showed Remus to their
“I’m hallucinating.” He looked up at someone behind Harry — Harry turned to see Hermione, Ron, Remus and Severus, all with expressions of shock. Harry kind of wished he had a camera, if only to capture such an open expression on Severus’ face.
He called all the death eaters to his dining room, and dismissed Severus and Draco — they needed to do their potions. Anyway, even without them, the group was a hundred strong.
They all started walking further into the woods. Draco saw Harry cast a wistful look back over his shoulder at the park, and grabbed his hand, so that Harry looked at him. “Later. After the war.”
“How are we doing down here, Potter? Cozy?” Voldemort laughed. He’d always hated his laugh — it was too high pitched — but he revelled in the shiver that travelled down the boy’s spine.
!” Ron was already ahead of Harry and Hermione with his long legs.
a wizard. And this was a memory.
He couldn’t bring himself to move — until his shivering slowed, and then stopped, as heat washed over him. Who would cast a warming charm on him? The heat was steadily becoming unbearable, and Draco opened his eyes, seeing smoke above. Of course Lucius had set fire to the bloody house.
“Yep.” Harry and Draco exchanged smirks.
“It’s getting late. I’m going to go upstairs,” Draco said quietly, quickly
“Bloody brilliant.” Malfoy rolled his eyes.
.” Malfoy sneered haughtily, flicking his wand at Harry who lifted rather gracefully from the sofa. Ron itched to tackle the blonde git and carry Harry himself, but if his magic hurt Harry…he’d clearly been through a lot.
gasps. Potter, surprisingly, didn’t even jump at the sound.
, otherwise no one would be able to get in or out.”
He appeared in the forest that he’d spent an entire year in, learning to accept his werewolf side, frantically following the scent of his pack.
.” Ron hissed, and Bill elbowed both of them.
“What is an archive worker, such as yourself, doing up here on the fourth floor?”
“Pretty damn big, if lessons are any indication,” Draco interrupted again.
Severus raised an eyebrow. “And what does that have to do with anything?”
He shook his head, heading towards the bathroom. He took a long shower, relishing the scalding water on his skin, scrubbing it raw as if he could scrub the guilt away.
“Allow me to cast some spells. Perhaps the spell did go wrong.” Flitwick smiled kindly at them, although his eyes were still unnervingly bright. He waved his wand, muttering some incantations under his breath, and Harry's breath caught. Malfoy was glowing with a silvery light, that set his eyes sparkling and hair glimmering. He looked down at his hands which were encased in the same silvery glow, although it didn’t suit his darker skin as well as it did Malfoy’s. Between them, a thread pulled tight from their chests, glowing brightly. Flitwick clapped his hands, while Malfoy’s face paled.
He was Fed Up of having to skirt around corridors to avoid being hexed (or at least reduce how often it happened). He was Fed Up of the professors being condescendingly fair, especially when his new wand was acting up (which it did on a regular basis, thanks to Draco having to go to a sub-par wandmaker, what with the Dark Lord making the idiot decision to torture Ollivander until he couldn’t produce wands for a while yet).
He’d drank three cups by the time the kids came down. The look of them made him feel even worse — Bill and Fleur were relatively older, sure, but Ginny was supposed to be going into her seventh year. They were all too young to look so old — haunted eyes, stress lines where they shouldn’t be, battle–weary expressions.
“The one explanation was not applicable in our situation.” Malfoy’s eyes did not flicker this time.
“That is an excellent plan, but I wondered how many people you would need going in? I’m sure myself and the aurors,” he gestured to his group of people, “could get ahold of any hair you need, but there are only so many people in top positions that would have access to the documents.”
Harry sighed, defeated. “We need to leave for charms soon, you know.”
There was the possibility of it being a prank - Draco wrinkled his nose at the flood of Gryffindors that came out of the Hall, forcibly suppressing his urge to hit himself on the head, because
“What about Ron and Hermione?”
Draco broke away, and Harry let out an embarrassingly high–pitched whine.
, Potter.” Draco found that he couldn’t stop the small smile playing at his lips at the sound of Harry talking normally, and hoped that the dark room would hide it.
The Dark Lord sneered at Draco, who was lying face down on the floor, breathing shakily in and out. “You’re dismissed.” He turned to Severus. “Go with him. Tell him what he’s to do. I need more healing potions.”
“Okay, so hold your hand out.” Hermione glared at Ron expectantly, who held out his hand, blushing to the tips of her ears when she took it in her own.
“So, Draco,” Hermione said, causing Draco to jump and spill some peas from his fork at the sound of his name, “what was that spell you used to make the room smell of lavender yesterday?”
Bill went straight to the lifts, only realising after the doors had closed that there was only one other person in the lift — Percy Weasley.
Draco chuckled slightly.
Draco looked behind him and cast a
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew that the ties had been removed and he was on the floor. Not really wanting to deal with the pain, but needing to know what Bellatrix was saying, Harry pulled back into his body, gritting his teeth at the wave of pain that crashed over him. Bellatrix had really gone nuts.
didn’t want to think about - his father was a right idiot for following the Dark Lord). In third year, it had taken five attempts for Potter to see his fainting act, which had been pure gold.
“I think Potter will survive an hour or two without me, Weasley.” Hermione was finding it extremely difficult to hold in her giggles at the contrast between the tomato–red Ron and relaxed Malfoy. A glance to her side showed Severus’ eyes glinting with mirth, even as he frowned. “Anyway, I wanted breakfast.”
“No, no, your antics resulted in me having to talk to the ferret. You do

He’d been in Hogsmeade with his friends - and Draco, who’d been integrated as if he’d been part of their group all along. Then the death eaters had shown up - and Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco had all been sprinting through the forest. They’d been tied up and thrown in the basement, but this time it had just been the four of them.

“No one has noticed yet.” Harry stubbornly crossed his arms.
Love you all, your comments and kudos are what keep me writing ❤️
He didn’t intend to fall asleep in Harry’s bed, but he did anyway.
Harry’s eyes darted around nervously as he was levitated into marble halls. He took in every detail he could, not that there were many — whichever family lived here clearly enjoyed the minimalistic look.
. “This is a lot to take in. We suspected something was wrong, but for him to be in this state…we can’t thank you enough. Do you need somewhere to stay? This is a big house, after all.”
Draco pulled a face.
“Nice to see you, Herb. How is the accounting office?” Percy asked, his tone evenly pleasant.
“We’re just viewers here. We can’t physically interfere in any way, so just try to absorb as much information as possible.” Hermione muttered, her dark eyes burning with anger at the sight of Dumbledore
Harry nodded his admission at the statement. “So how do we get rid of it?”
He turned and nodded at Remus and Fleur, who both took three steps forward. Remus smiled as he turned to Severus. “Yep, they’re definitely there. Now you try — if you can’t get in, we’ll know they’ve worked.”
Harry stopped moving, allowing Draco to adjust himself before moving again.

“Are you doubting my calculations?” Hermione put her hands on her hips, glaring at Ron who was looking extremely nervous.

Draco sighed and removed the charm with another flick of his wand. “I am finding out what’s going on, one way or another.”
Dumbledore was dead.
Draco asked him if he was getting up, after changing (Harry assumed - he still hadn’t turned over), and Harry just grunted, not moving.
“It will not be
Draco looked at Harry curiously, before taking Harry’s hand in his own. He chose a deep cut running up the side of his forearm, and pointed his wand at it, the end trembling slightly, and he didn’t make a move to heal the cut.
Well he wasn’t falling for it.
“If you’re done drooling over Potter, what do you want?” Pansy put her hands on her hips.
Draco took a deep breath, ready to try one last time. “
“Hermione’s is very…neutral. I can’t really feel anything, but again, not very compatible. Maybe try casting something?”
“What room is he in.” Hermione was grinding her teeth as Draco led her down the corridor and gestured to a door. She took a deep breath, purposefully relaxing her face. She hissed to Draco “wait outside,” stepping in before he could reply and shutting the door in his face.
“Well I didn’t get much
Harry got ready for bed in the bathroom, emerging to closed drapes around Draco’s bed. Sighing, he cast silencing spells and stared blankly at a book he’d pulled from his trunk, wondering why Draco’s eyes weren’t as lit up as before.
Draco wandered over to the photos. There was no evidence of Harry living here - a terrible sleepover, perhaps?
No, that wasn’t just a kiss - he’d full-blown
Three days in, when she was gritting her teeth as she scrubbed dishes, she decided to talk to Ron. Trusting her, he called a family meeting - Molly, Arthur, the twins, Ginny, Bill, and Fleur all gathered in the kitchen.
he had been a spy since he’d been seventeen, which was something to be commended in itself.
Figuring that there wasn’t much else for him to do, Harry also buried himself under the covers and, marvelling at lack of pain without the cuts on his upper body, fell asleep.
“Fucking hell-“ Harry started, ready to continue muttering a string of obscene words, but the sight before him left him speechless.. His robes, shirt, jumper and tie had disappeared, courtesy of the potion, and he was left standing in only his trousers and shoes, glaring at Harry. Harry was somewhere between his jaw hitting the floor, because Draco was
“Hermione?” He screwed his face up as he turned over, and Hermione grimaced. He had dark shadows under his eyes, his cheeks were slightly hollow (expected since he hadn’t eaten in a while) and his hair was limp.
“Yes. Can you see muggleborns who are supposed to be attending Hogwarts in September?”
A grin broke across Draco’s face whenever he thought of that - not only that Harry felt comfortable enough with him to even consider stealing his food, but that he was eating that little more than usual.
He lay there for a moment, before everything came rushing back. He shot up, mentally bracing himself for pain that didn’t come. He frowned — he’d definitely been hit by quite a few spells, not to mention the
“I just...I’m not sure if I can go to the Weasley’s this year for Christmas.”
“I’m looking out for him because he’d been hexed and because you asked, and he carries a better conversation than anyone else in that class anyway. And Harry, I don’t ‘study’ with him outside of lessons!”
“He’s fine, but I’m forcing him to pack right now. You know what he’s like.”
His father took him to the village by side–along, since he didn’t know where it was. There was a moment where it was just them in the village, and the corners of his father’s mouth turned up slightly as he clapped Draco on the shoulder. Draco knew in that moment that his father was proud of him. It didn’t feel how he felt it should.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and obeyed, and immediately Harry stopped shaking.
“How come you didn’t come fetch us?” Harry asked them, still holding Draco’s hand.
“I will not
“Sometimes you have to break the law to uphold the law. Back me up, Harry.” Ron elbowed Harry, who was staring at Draco with a forgotten forkful of mash raised halfway to his mouth.
, Draco, they’ll reappear soon - I think Ron put a jumper in my bag this morning.”
He pulled the covers up to his chin, staring blankly at the wall. Maybe Vernon was right - it was Saturday, he should be outside, with his friends, having a great time, but instead he was just lying in bed.
like Lucius normally did.
“Not at all. Snape tried to teach me, in fifth year, but it didn’t go...well.” Draco felt a wave of guilt pass over him. He was pretty sure it was his own - he hadn’t known about how Severus died until after the Battle, but he knew Voldemort - he shuddered at the name - had killed him because he thought Severus had some power that he wanted. Draco was quite sure it was some power he’d got from Dumbledore - so if Draco had killed Dumbledore like he was supposed to, Severus needn’t have died. Draco had spent a lot of time thinking about it when he’d seen the story, after being released from the ministry cells. However, if the bond had been made correctly, it could also be Potter’s guilt. He
He had a thought and looked into his mind, across the bond. Harry’s mind, rather than being wreathed in shadow, was quite visible. Dark shadows hung loosely in the air like clouds, but they looked...peaceful.
“We have a favour to ask of you.” The second person was Voldemort.
“We do need to talk about that, to be fair.” Draco said, attempting to cut the tension in the room.
“Close to forty hours. I think you came close to waking up a couple of times, but the thing with the pensieve and Kreacher must have really tired you out.”
Draco smiled against his lips. “That, we did.”
Luna chuckled. “I’m quite surprised it took you two this long to get together. I’m glad to see Draco’s influence has reduced the number of nargles around your head though, Harry.”
Kreacher appeared with a
If Bill cried himself to sleep that night, no one had to know. He had to stay strong for the good of the family now.
Hermione handed the parchment to Severus, who started scanning it.
Draco had nodded, but done the rest of the cuts on Harry’s torso in silence, not speaking until he saw Harry’s back. Harry shivered slightly as Draco’s fingers had run along the old scars.
“Nonsense, it’s great to hear from you. Here, drink this;” Bill thrust the flask at Remus, the twins having brought a few doses of one they’d developed themselves.
“You want to walk together?” Confusion was written across Draco’s face.
Except apparently, Harry Potter did — and then he had the

“I wish I could do something about these, too.”
Bill nodded. “Yeah — we can meet them tomorrow at the Burrow? Or here?”
looking at Draco, who in turn was looking at Harry with a peculiar expression.
After I’ve posted the next fic, called The Egregious Engagement, I’ll be inactive on here for a while. I have plans for a seventh year fic *cackles evilly* which I am unbelievably excited to write, and I’ll start posting once it’s reached around 25K. I don’t know how long that’s going to take to write, probably at least two weeks, but I’m reasonably active on my instagram and tumblr so if you want to follow me, harass me, or make friends, you can find me there :)
Draco quickly cast silencing charms on the room before running over to Potter, who was screaming and sobbing and saying “get UP, get UP Malfoy, kill me, he’s going to kill you,” and then Potter lost all of his anger and curled up, sobs wracking his skinny frame and repeatedly saying “they’re going to kill you, they’re going to kill you, they’re going to kill you.”
“You can’t tell anybody.” Draco stared at the professor as if he’d turned into a pink pegasus and told them that he actually shit rainbows.
Harry raised an eyebrow, but rolled his eyes and called out, “Kreacher!”
. No problem.
“Does that mean…?” He didn’t finish his question, looking rapidly between Malfoy and Harry.
“Okay, so I didn’t get much because I kind of had to run away when he found me, but one was with Bellatrix — probably not still
Snape shot him a nasty look. Then again, he’d never been particularly fond of Ron, who was responsible for at least a third of the potions accidents that occurred in their classes. “Because according to Potter, he’s the only person who’s magic doesn’t
“That wasn’t an answer.”
At lessons that Monday, Harry had been surprised to not be approached by anyone, other than a couple of knowing smiles as they looked at him and Draco. Harry hadn’t been to breakfast, instead having a panic attack and then some bread Draco brought up. Really, his diet had been reduced exclusively to carbohydrates, which perhaps wasn’t ideal, but he
Resigned to his fate, Harry lay on the dirty floor, hoping an infection would kill him quickly.
curses he was controlling — he controlled the top five, which each controlled five of their own, and so on. Most of the ministry departments had two infiltrators — if he could just get to the blasted aurors, he could easily take over. He sent another message down to take over the aurors, and stalked down the worn, stone steps.
Harry shook his head at Draco, tucking in his own shirt and redoing his tie. Draco clearly wasn’t impressed, as he finally deigned to get off the bed, grabbing Harry’s tie and redoing it for him. A blush spread down his neck as he stepped away, muttering “he can kill a Dark Lord, but can’t tie a basic half-Windsor knot.”
at his nearest follower, a man with mousy brown hair,  and hurried out of the room, his dark robes swishing behind him as he cursed Lucius for the anti-apparation wards surrounding the manor.
Tearful reunions ensued as Ginny saw Harry, Ron, Hermione and Remus, and she even gave Draco a brief hug, Luna quickly following. A rather hearty bro hug — with a great deal of back–slapping — occurred between Harry, Ron, Dean and Seamus, but tears shone on their faces anyway. Hannah and Millicent Bulstrode looked uncomfortable on the sidelines, and started talking to Severus, rather than interrupt the reunions, who in turn looked relieved to have a distraction.
“If you insist.” Draco pushed off the wall, taking all of a step before Harry stopped him.
“Can we floo out?” Ron asked, moving towards the fireplace.
He was confident the diadem was safe. Nobody knew about that room, and even if they
“Come and have some food afterwards, then.”
He zoned back in just as the sorting hat started its poem:
“We will, mum.” Bill wrapped an arm around his fiancée.
Hermione sighed, her eyebrows drawing into a familiar frown that Hermione adopted whenever she didn’t know something. “I’ve only read theories of this happening — your cores have to be one hundred percent compatible for this to occur, which is incredibly rare. I don’t think there’s any documented information; but then again, I’ve never really gone looking for information on this particular topic, and despite your and Ron’s accusations I have not read the entire Hogwarts library.”
least of all Draco! Where did you even come to that conclusion?” Harry flopped down into a comfy, battered armchair, stretching his hands and feet towards the fire - the library was
“Go. Unpack. I have a job for you tomorrow.” The Dark Lord dismissed Draco with a flick of his hand. Draco kept his steps even, refusing to give him the satisfaction of running out of the room.
Most of it was speculation and fairytales - he scoffed after reading the first few lines of one of them, which was clearly an erotic novel - but one of them was particularly useful. It had been written by a couple who were both researchers and soulmates, and had done a considerable amount of viable research on the subject.
“Had enough time in there, I’d expect. Come on, time to make breakfast.” Vernon pulled Harry’s arm, ignoring the gasp from the five-year-old as it pulled open more of the wounds from the belting the night before. “Eggs, bacon and toast, boy. And don’t burn the bacon, it’s Dudley’s birthday!”
Harry was feeling very weird after charms.

He continued down the path, to the clearing. His heart sped up and his chest tightened as his blood pressure rose, but he continued until he stood at the point where he died. His hand went to his chest, where the white scar, not appearing to have a shape as it was distorted by scar tissue, but where he knew was a smaller, less obvious lightning-bolt scar.
“When do you need us, Professor?”
What ‘himself’ was, exactly, Harry didn’t know. At the Dursley’s, he’d been small and unassuming, trying his best to not get a beating. Throughout his years at Hogwarts, Dumbledore encouraged his reckless ‘bravery’ in a way no adult should. He went after Quirrel when he was
He sat down, not staring at the Hall as a whole, not acknowledging the memories that pounded at him. Rows of people covered by white sheets; Parvati pulling a sheet over Lavender’s bloody face; Dennis Creevy crying over the small, pale body of his brother; the Weasley family crowded around Fred, his face still smiling at the ceiling.

“Seamus, you saw me in charms.”
“I wasn’t able to glean any useful information, other than about a week ago, when someone let slip about ‘children in the dungeon’. Well, I’d heard about what they did to you, Harry; but only after you’d left. I would have broken you out sooner if I’d known.” The corners of her mouth quivered, and her eyes shone with unshed tears.
Draco looked down the bond, to see how Harry was doing, but saw...nothing. He couldn’t see Harry’s occlumency shields, or anything but darkness. It was similar to what he’d seen in charms - unnervingly, he couldn’t feel
At the Burrow, Hermione allowed herself to be enveloped in a warm hug from Molly, accepting a kiss on each cheek from Fleur and a clap on the shoulder from Bill. She lost herself in jobs, cleaning, changing sheets, de-gnoming the garden — anything to ignore that sense of
He didn’t really sleep, just lightly dozed. At one point, two in the morning according to his wand, he took some food from the side of his plate - he felt gratitude towards Draco, but really, he couldn’t understand. Better to leave him be.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, and Harry could almost hear him say
“Almost!” Scorpius grinned, his green eyes lit up.
“Can you take us somewhere else?” Snape’s gentle tone was

do the potion, lest you vanish this jumper as well.”
They sat on the bed, just like they had before, each happy to enjoy the moment in itself, without worrying about anything else.
(“You and Severus should take hints. She’s good,” Harry murmured to Draco, wincing as a sharp elbow dug into his side.)
— it didn’t take Tonks back to the Ministry, but it did take Umbridge to the woods. Both women fell to the ground in a heap, and the ensuing duel left cracks and craters in the ground, deep gashes marking the surrounding trees. They were surprisingly evenly matched, Umbridge becoming more and more vicious with each spell, but dropping her guard slightly. Tonks waited patiently on the defensive, looking for the opening to stun Umbridge, when a loud
“Bad luck mate” Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder. “Maybe McGonagall would let you get a room change? I’m sure you could sleep with me and Neville. Or in the common room.”
“Where are you going to wear that?” Draco raised an eyebrow at the scandalous dress. “Your parents would never let you take it to a ball or a gala.”
“Potter. I wonder what you’re doing here.”
“As if you didn’t miss me.”

“You haven’t even heard my terms.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry groaned as he got out of the chair.
“Of course I am. Now go get some sleep.”
Hermione, despite how suspicious she’d been of Harry and Draco these past few weeks, hadn’t been particularly concerned. While in public, the pair had quite clearly been a couple - granted, there hadn’t been any PDA, which would have been the main deal, but Harry had always been a very private person and likely didn’t want anything in the press - they wouldn’t print anything without proof, thanks to a couple of strongly worded letters from herself.
“Will you speak french tonight?”
“Hey, Harry. Did we win?” Draco smiled weakly.
The next morning, the drapes were closed as per usual. Draco sighed, sent a
“Yes, yes, Helga Hufflepuff’s cup. We’ll be fine,” Severus said.
Harry felt horrible.

No; there was Draco’s pulse, a strong, pounding drum against the overwhelming fear and sorrow; his chest rose and fell with even breaths; his eyes were open and staring at Harry.
“The Boy who Lived, come to die” Ginny hissed - their entire conversation had been in parseltongue, Harry realised, how had he not realised sooner, Voldemort was back - he was frozen, collapsing on the cold, unforgiving ground of the forest as Ginny’s bed disappeared, hearing a high pitched cackle that he would never forget ring in his ears and Voldemort was in front of him, behind him, encompassing the entire world...and Harry was almost relieved when he heard those too-familiar words, saw a flash of green light, felt a stabbing pain in his chest as he was falling…
He realised that he’d been staring at Potter’s lips when there was another burst of white from the end of Potter’s wand.
them, at the very least. The Dark Lord still didn’t know that Draco could do neither, but would soon be finding out, apparently. Fenrir likely wouldn’t notice if Draco wasn’t pulling his weight, in his bloodlust — Draco shuddered at the thought of having to witness that — but Rodolphus probably would, and his father would definitely be watching his every move. Draco had hoped to go further before being found out, but resigned himself to his fate of being killed that very afternoon. It would be hard on his mother, but an easy escape for himself.
“Yeah, well, some pure blood families aren’t so accepting - what with their obsessions of ‘continuing the bloodline’ - but overall everyone is alright with it.”
He managed to take another bite of his mashed potatoes when he heard the familiar clink of coins being exchanged. He frowned, but dug his fork back into the food, when he heard another clink, and then another. Soon, the entire room was filled with the muffled clinking of money changing hands.
“That would be great, Harry! I suspect that isn’t what you wanted to talk about, though?”

“Fancy being back on time for once?” Harry asked.
The twins appeared at the bottom of the stairs, their faces grave. “This is a variant of the polyjuice potion which we’ve tested and developed. It lasts five hours, instead of the usual one.”
“Sure.” Harry smiled until Hermione’s face left the fireplace, then slumped back in his chair and waved his wand to remove the glamours. He went upstairs to lie on his bed and do nothing for a few hours.
many wards we put up, and bring who he wants with him.”
As September turned to October and the leaves started turning crisp and orange, the pair often huddled together under trees, watching leaves dance around them, casting warming charms. Harry loved watching Draco melt under the magic, and Draco loved the feeling of Harry’s magic on him - it was like a warm hug, settling comfortable around him without a sound, bringing with it a faint aroma of freshly cut grass and leather. Draco had never registered smelled anything like that while with Harry, but knew instinctively that that was his true scent.
“We need Severus, he probably has a dozen antidotes for this. Just stay awake, you
Hermione elbowed him, and he shot a glare at her, immediately cowed by the one she returned. “Let’s go,” she said, sighing.
“So, baking?”
“What the fuck is going on?” Harry asked, staring straight ahead rather than the gorgeous person next to him.
Harry rolled his eyes again, running his fingers across the material.

Severus suppressed a huff of indignation. Sure, it wasn’t a big deal for

“But that means Harry was taken
Ron looked as if he was going to say something, but then just grimaced instead, before changing the subject. “So…what actually happened? Y’know, on the mission with Dumbledore, and then these last six weeks…”
The emotion reminded him of the darkness radiating out of the void he’d witnessed in the charms lesson. He drew back into his mind. The rope was still there, straining even more, and the void had...grown. Like it had been contained before, but was now unleashed. Waves of darkness pulsed out, and in time to those Draco felt the emotion hitting him.
“Well come out and have some food, at least.” Draco took a step away, towards the door which had swung shut behind him.
. They shouldn’t have to do this. And yet, Bill had a determined look on his face as he said, “Okay, so that will be the first course of action. We’ll need a main base of operations as well — we can’t use your place, or here, since they’re under the fidelius and we can’t have too many people knowing the Secret.”
a professor, you dolt,” Ginny replied, also in a whisper.
“Wonder what that was all about?” Draco said, sitting next to Severus with the countdown for the potion ticking ominously in the air.
“How long have you been watching?” Draco asked.
“I take it it’s pointless to ask you to call me Minerva?” McGonagall sighed.
I have a few notes about the AU that I wanted to tell you guys, but couldn’t quite shoehorn into the epilogue:

“Sure you’re not. Come on, youngsters, off to bed with you all.” Remus stood and shooed them out of the room.
It’s less hostile.
He examined the basin for all of two seconds, before saying “we have to drink it.”
They dozed for another two hours, getting ready just in time to come across Ron and Hermione on the way to breakfast.
“Today is the anniversary of my parents’ death. I wanted to be alone.” Harry shrugged, trying to appear as nonchalant as his ‘dreadful’ appearance would allow.
Seventh year. That was so
“My Lord, according to my son the Granger girl is a mudblood in his year, and the Weasley boy is likely a blood traitor along with the rest of his family.”
Ron snorted, and then immediately looked horrified with himself, hastily hiding himself behind the parchment that Severus held out.

Draco fell to the floor, barely registering that the floor was softer and warmer than it should be over the waves of pain coursing through his body. He didn’t know how long he had the curse cast on him, nor the number of times it was. He lay on the floor, shivering with pain, hearing Lucius walk out with short, measured steps.
“Ginny, Luna, Dean, Seamus, Hannah, and Millicent. And it’s rude to interrupt, darling.” Draco sighed and slumped in his chair. Narcissa shot a disapproving look at him, before continuing. “We’ve all been hiding out there. That was, until I felt a tug on one of the wards the Dark Lord had set. That was another thing I’d done before I’d left — left undetectable strands of magic on all of his alert systems so I’d know when they were triggered. I apparated to Godric’s hollow just before the wards went down, and spent some time rigging the apparation points. You two would have been completely overwhelmed otherwise.”
“Eat your soup,” Draco said, thrusting another slice of bread at him.
Hermione shook herself out of her stupor, packing all of her personal items neatly in her trunk with a flick of her wand, and shrinking the trunk with another. She pocketed the miniaturized trunk, casting a long look around the room. Lavender, Parvati, Fay and Julie had all left already. Hermione had always felt out of place in this dorm, never quite fitting in with their conversations, but had enjoyed several late night conversations with her roommates nevertheless. They’d been particularly helpful in fourth year for the Yule Ball. Hermione hoped that she’d come back, but knew that it would be a long time before she returned. She could only hope that McGonagall would allow her to sit her exams after the war was over given that she studied in the time between.
“You’re going to ruin your nail polish.”
“He called me cute, and then fucked off at the speed of light.”
There was a spider in the corner in his room, he noticed. Perfect. He brought up all those feelings of hatred - towards his father, for forcing him into this. Towards the Dark Lord, for being a racist idiot. Towards the spider, for scaring the living crap out of him every time he saw it out of the corner of his eye.
“I’m not going.”
They took a small infiltration group; the residents of Grimmauld place, as well as Narcissa, Bill Weasley (in case there were any extra wards to remove), and the Weasley twins (who brought a veritable armoury of pranks from their shop). Once Ginny caught wind that Narcissa had given them free reign to destroy her house, she insisted that she come along, and then Percy had protested that he, too, was a Weasley, and should ‘participate in any shenanigans that were to take place’.

“M–Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket, and he told Kreacher…he told Kreacher to switch the lockets, after h–he drank the potion. And then Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to leave without him af–after he swapped the lockets, and to destroy the locket, and t–to not tell his Mistress. And Kreacher didn’t want to, Kreacher wanted to stay with his Master, but he had to obey, s–so Kreacher swapped the lockets, and then watched as Master Regulus was dragged beneath the — the water, and…” Kreacher trailed off, wailing as he knelt on the floor.
Draco rolled his eyes. At least it was Slytherin colours. And he could say the H stood for ‘Hogwarts’, or something.
“...If it’s evidence, we need to see it regardless of the legal implications!”
Harry prayed for someone, anyone, to come help him - a nosy neighbour looking over the fence, a sudden visitor - but no one came, no one ever did, it was just him and Vernon and pain…
, Harry. I can’t—”
“Really. A bit far fetched, isn’t it?”
Ron raised an eyebrow at the half-hearted statement from Harry, while Bill just chuckled.
Anyway, it didn’t really matter, Hannah had interrupted, as the siblings looked ready to turn the dining room into a battleground; Narcissa had come into the dungeons on their fourth night there and taken them out of a secret passageway. No one found out until the next day.
?” In his mind’s eye, Harry saw Bellatrix weirding multiple silver knives, hurling them at him as he lay, unmoving, on the floor—
“That’s a good idea, Harry.” Hermione smiled at him - one of those soft, ‘I’m sorry’ smiles. It made Harry feel slightly ill, so he said:
” Draco said, before allowing Harry to drag him around a corner into the corridor, hastily erecting a silencing charm and pinning him against the wall, kissing him and grinding his hips against Draco’s.
Ron was too far…but Percy and the twins weren’t.
, what a
Harry groaned inwardly as he heard Lucius’ tell–tale footsteps for a third day in a row. He was especially fond of the cruciatus, although still nowhere near the viciousness of Voldemort or Bellatrix. Curiously, Harry had yet to be visited by Fenrir — a full moon must have passed by now, and Harry had expected that that would be when the werewolf would visit.
“He’s
“I- fine. Send him in, please.” Harry sat up, finally.
He’d been very disappointed in himself yesterday, as he ate a bit of bread and drank some water. Apparently he wasn’t as self destructive as he’d thought. The good news was that the cut on his thigh was definitely infected — when Lucius had visited he’d noticed in the light that not only was it very swollen, but it was oozing a horrid white substance. Thankfully, Lucius hadn’t noticed, as Harry strategically drew his legs up to hide the front of his thighs.
“Going to take up healing, Potter?” Draco smirked as he nudged the door open with his foot, holding his wand in one hand and some vials in the other, some food levitating behind him.
“Err...thank you?” Draco said, not quite sure what was going on. Apparently satisfied with their answer, the group left, a couple with slightly wider smiles than the others.
“Don’t worry, ‘Mione, it’s fine. Are we both sleeping in your room then?”
First, it had just been those who had it worst — the muggleborns who had still come, for some reason, people with openly anti–muggleborn parents, people who had been in the DA but didn’t have the stomach to tolerate the torture. Neville and Lavender were the main way of corresponding with people in the Room, as they regularly went in and out to check on everyone. Mrs Norris often came to the sixth and seventh year Gryffindors that she’d once ratted out for being out at night when there was someone in the corridor who needed help, and most of the upper year Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs had been caught by the Carrows as the Ravenclaws and Slytherins ushered younger years through corridors, throwing regretful glances over their shoulders.
Severus took it from Ron and looked over it carefully, casting a couple of spells to make it gleam and filling it with a shimmery liquid. “It’s safe to use now. I take it Draco and I aren’t allowed to see?”
“Maybe. There’s this weird, shiny thread at the edge?”
,” he waved his knife in the motion, “like this, but…bigger. And in a wider range — you have to stand towards the corner and kind of cover the whole room. Obviously, the amount of magic it takes is proportional to the size of the room, but it’s never been a huge issue for me, despite not having massive wells of magic.”
“No. Now all of you fuck off, I want to wallow in self pity before I go to sleep.”
They all mumbled their agreements, and within minutes everyone was bundled up and ready to go. It was silent on the way to the grounds, and when they got there they just stood, as if trying to remember how to have fun. Harry knelt down and moulded a snowball, throwing it at Blaise’s face. The slytherin reared back in shock, eyes going wide.
(God, he was so gone for this boy.)
It’s silly, how so many things can bring him to tears nowadays, but he can’t help it—he’s allowed to
. Just maybe.)
‘You do?’
The sun falls and the moon rises and the gentle deer sleeps and the wise owl hoots, and Draco wonders why people needed to sleep, why the sun needed to fall or why the moon needed to rise, because why could both not exist at the same time? Why could he not receive the sun's warmth and the moon's tranquility at the same time?
Fear gripped Draco at the thought.
(Damn these feelings.)

Harry’s always loved meteor showers, and Draco’s always loved Harry.
‘Yeah, we are.’)
“That's a beautiful name,” Harry answered honestly. Green eyes met silver, and Harry was reminded of the constellation the boy in front of him was named after. Fierce, but silent.
He returned his focus towards the situation, glaring at the flying boy who was having far too much fun taunting his housemate. But despite it all, there was this respect, this sort-of-friendly emotion he couldn’t help but feel towards the boy, who hadn’t hated him because his name was Harry Potter, but because Harry had refused his hand in friendship and therefore wounded his pride.
“Oh you are going
“Hello,” the boy smiled, not unkindly, but not sincerely either. There was something hidden underneath it all, curiosity being the strongest. Harry’s brow furrowed, but decided not to think about it further. “I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
. Everything that would happen between them would be dangerous, he decided. They were far too alike. “I’ll see you around?”
Malfoy turned to smirk at Harry and his whole world stopped. Blond windswept hair covered his eyes, which were practically glowing with adrenaline.
There stood Draco Malfoy wearing silver robes and swept back hair. Harry stared at him in awe, lips parting open in shock, every ounce of oxygen leaving his lungs. His silver eyes looked almost blue, blond hair nearly white against the snow. The tips of his fingers were pink, and he was talking amusedly with his friend Pansy, eyes shining with mirth and amusement.
. But today, today they were going to try.
Draco wonders why people cry in sorrow when petals and flowers fall but they step on red and gold leaves that crunch on the ground, because they were all part of the same tree, of the same bush, but they are paid no attention to. Harry tells him that flowers are remembered because of their beauty and leaves are remembered because of the sound they make when jumped into, the sound they make when people step on them—Harry reminds him that some people are better listened to than looked at.
“It’s no problem. What caused you to...well…” Harry gestured in a vague movement towards his arm.
Harry reached forward, trying to find Draco’s magic, his soul. It was barely there; a small, delicate thing, fading slowly. Harry tried to capture it, to wrap it with his magic, but it had been completely drained.
He was eventually levitated into a dining room, of sorts — there was a long table, chairs and a chandelier, and a huge oil painting of some blonde person. He looked vaguely like Malfoy, but it clearly wasn’t him — for one thing, he wasn’t fifty years old. And his face structure was different. And his eyes were steel–grey, not blue grey.
“No, no, please don’t take me there, don’t lock me in, I’ll be good, just
He looked in the mirror, noting he looked considerably worse than usual. He cast his usual heavy-duty glamours, before grabbing a book to stare at from his trunk and sitting in a chair in the common room.
“It’s blood magic, Potter, why do you think it’s so dangerous?”
Voldemort said.
“Are you sure we can do this with two people, ‘Mione?”
Hermione was on the floor, sobbing, Bellatrix having already carved the ugly word into her arm and was starting on her other arm. There was so much blood, seeping out onto the floor, into Bellatrix’s robes, at Malfoy’s feet.
Harry pulled away reluctantly, staring into those grey eyes and ignoring the whoops and cheers coming from many of his classmates.
Snow. It was snowing.
, Harry thought silently as he and Parvati made their way towards the Great Hall.
(Being cheesy means being in love.)
(And that’s okay.)
But Malfoy,
Harry came back to the Gryffindor common room with a small smile and a calmed soul.
Draco was so in love with this boy it’s earth shattering.)
Silence reigned, with Harry to taken with the image before him to even be bothered to answer quickly. Electricity seemed to crackle in the air, and he couldn’t figure out if it was good or bad. He settled for

“Hogwarts then?” the stern woman asked, her kind tone a contrast to the solemn expression on her face. Harry nodded, voice seemingly lost as he struggled to take in the events of the past hour. “Alright, stand over there, I'll be with you in a minute.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco would whisper, eyes burning with tears and heart heavy with guilt. “You shouldn't have to deal with me.”
. He’d ignored his pride and apologised because he didn’t want to be like that anymore, but there lay the mark on his arm, a remembrance of who he once was.
