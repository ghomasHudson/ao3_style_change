“For most of my life, my grandmother refused to tell me what happened.  It was only after I presented that she told me the whole story.   She was worried, you see.  My great-Oma, he had a very rare gift.  A permutation of the Sight,” she pauses, eyes Harry askance.  “I assume you’re familiar?”
Ron drops down to his elbows on the grass and looks up at the sky.  “I don’t know.  But I think he wants the option.”
Harry’s eyes felt heavier suddenly and he just nodded, hoping the love in his eyes would be sufficient to comfort Hermione that it was more than okay.  Hermione smiled and continued.
I am so sure that this courtship is the right thing, I am so interested in you, that I wanted to make sure I had everything setup on my side to give it it’s best chance of success.
George is quiet for a few moments, but his scent shifts again, moving away from distressed to a more general note of stress with a touch of anger.
“So what happened at the height of my season,” Harry says slowly, turning the thought over in his mind, not liking the bad taste it leaves, “that was, what? A vision? Of the future?”
It’s brutal and physical, in the way that Harry has really only seen Muggles behave.  Wizards have a tendency to manage their disputes with magic, which has its own physical toll, of course, but Ernie must have been so infuriated that magic felt too impersonal.  Instead he wracks the other boy under a barrage of fists and kicks.  McGonagall and Flitwick look on disapprovingly but do not intervene, much to Harry’s consternation.
Here you go!  Thanks everyone for your response on this.  Let's get into a little bit of world-building....
The relief is transient - a break so brief it might as well not have existed and George looks worried.  Because now Harry is chanting low, under his breath, “Alpha. Alpha. Alpha. Alpha.” And all of a sudden he just knows that that is how he can stop this pain.  That if only he had an Alpha, he could avoid this torture.
“Yea, like an Alpha who reports into another Alpha.  Some Covens, typically really large Covens with a lot of Betas and more than one Omega work better with more than one Alpha.  But Alphas are territorial and they also like to be in charge.  An Alpha Sub would need to get along really well with the Alpha Prime and the Alpha Prime would need to be laid back enough to spilt up some of the control of the Coven.”
As the only other non-aligned Gryffindor, Seamus seemed an obvious choice as a recruit, but Hermione had never been very fond of the Irish Beta.  Ron wasn’t exactly overflowing in affection for his dorm mate, but he was prepared to put in a half-hearted word of advocacy when Dean Presented and made the whole situation a lot easier to stomach.  Both Ron and Hermione liked Dean and Dean had a long history of keeping Seamus in check.  They both were welcomed into the Coven and when Luna presented - earlier than most of her year - she decided to join Hermione’s Coven instead of trying to join up with one of the Ravenclaw ones.  Hermione had been well-pleased.  Now with Harry, their six person Coven rivaled the size of Malfoy’s, who had seven 7th years in all, and Ernie, who also had six.
Harry had sat through the dialogue growing more and more confused.  He was also at about his wit’s end with being ignored as though he wasn’t here when the conversation was clearly about him.  He finally burst out, “Second? COA? Sponsor?  Hermione, what is going on?  What’s happening to me?”
Hermione, reading the situation, let’s Harry move past her to stand next to Belle and he motions them all on impatiently.
George chuckled.  “Yea, mate, it’s like that for all of us for the first few weeks. Stricture is a real doozy, doesn’t let you prepare at all.  Would be nice to have some warning, y’know? ‘Specially for people like us.”
“Alphas are the head of our way of life,” Fred continues.  “They are the protectors of our traditions.  In days of old, as now, we offer this bread to our ancestors to nourish them in the way they nourish us with their example and legacy.”
The Trio have just wrapped up in Herbology and are maneuvering out of the Greenhouses with the rest of their class, shared with the Hufflepuff 7th years, when Malfoy finally decides to make an appearance.
“That’s fine.  He’ll need to be here overnight regardless and I must inform the COA.  They will surely also send a representative to talk to him.”
Hermione proffers her own thanks to Padma, and gently nudges Harry, who’s feeling a little shell-shocked away.  Hermione chuckles when the two have stopped at a nearby table.  “Well, I don’t doubt we’ll be getting a courting proposal from Malfoy presently,” she muses, only cracking up more when Harry looks at her, mortified.
Ron closes the magazine, places its beside him and leans forward to rest his elbows on his knees, looking at them both somberly.
Rather expecting it, Harry prepares himself for the owl to land in front of Hermione, but to everyone’s consternation, the owl instead lands directly in front of Fred, holding out the courting proposal imperiously.
It’s run through the line for more than seven generations and my ancestors have had the gamut of various enchantments fail on them.”
Susan keens and Smith laughs before he releases her and she crashes to sprawl on the floor.  The whole thing couldn’t have been more than a minute, and then suddenly everything crashes back to present.   Harry is back in the suite in the Omega Quarters, he can tell his Heat has broken and Susan is throwing herself away from him, flush with incoherent rage.  “What kind of game are you playing, Potter?” she snaps, making fierce eye contact with him.  Harry opens his mouth - to protest, perhaps, or to insist on his innocence in the least - but it’s too late, she’s storming out the door.  He pushes himself to his elbows, tries to get out the bed, but its no use, he’s utterly exhausted.  His body has had its say.  He succumbs to the exhaustion and passes out.
What you’ve experienced so far with Alphas has been them trying to impose their will on you, for the most part, or not being in control of their rage, which presses on all those troublesome instincts inside of us that want to appease.
“Why should we even care?” Seamus chimes in, and Harry can’t help but think he’s right to ask.  What does it matter?  Popularity has never been a high priority for him or his friends.
“Thank you,” Harry said faintly, struck a little dumb by this barrage of information he didn’t fully understand.
Harry isn’t quite sure where the other boy stands but he pushes on regardless, confident enough in his own actions.
“I know, I know,” he mutters softly and cups a gentle hand around Harry’s cheek.  Harry leans into the touch, cool against his heated flesh and lets out a sound somewhere between a sob and a moan and George leads him to the four poster bed with its thin, cool sheets and settles him atop them.
As far as Harry knew, the twins hadn’t conversed since the Fight itself, and George had been quieter than usual, dodging out of being alone with anyone lest they attempt to trap him into discussing it.
His body answered for him as his vision grayed at the edges and he slumped slightly, making Hermione let out a small sound of alarm before wrapping her arm around his torso and guiding him out of the classroom.
I saw the whole thing from the other direction - a chance to get the Order to see that we were playing along, generate a little trust.
“I know,” Harry acknowledges, because he does, but there’s only limited space for forgiveness when he’s still in the midst of this reaction.
“From what I’ve heard, the Alphas that are closest to you will have more power over you.  You’ll be more sensitive to my voice than you would to Nott’s or Malfoy’s, for example.  But anyone who can get close enough to gentle you can control you.  It’s horrible manners, of course, for a non-Coven Alpha to approach you in that way, but it doesn’t make the potential for it any less real.”
He can see that this is not the easiest conversation for Fleur and he doesn’t want to add to her embarrassment.
Bill looks over at Fred who has been silent so far and the younger Weasley raises an inquiring eye before seeming to realize by Bill’s pointed expression that he’s being asked to leave and give him some privacy with the two Omegas.
He shifts his weight a little and then, making up his mind impulsively he reaches up to peck Oberon on the lips.
Startled Harry’s eyes skitter up to evaluate her and her face is full of compassion while she pumps out soothing pheremones.
“We’ve been friends a long time.  I may be strong-willed and obviously so are you, but we’ve been able to navigate each other’s strong wills for years.  I think we could have found a balance that worked for us both being Alphas in the same pack.  If you had presented Beta, there also wouldn’t have been any issues but neither Dumbledore or I thought that likely.”
“Suzie,” George exclaims, ushering her back to her seat where she had been chatting with Padma, who scoots over to make room for both George and Harry.
Breathing heavily, Ernie stands back and looks at his Second dispassionately.  “Susan told you ‘no’.  I told you ‘no’.  You are disavowed from my Coven.  Do no approach my Omega, do not even look at her.”  Ernie turns his back and the whole crowd feels the sudden magic of the disavowal rush through.
“Zacharias Smith,” she said in an aside to Harry before addressing George primly. “He’s quite well. Thank you very much.”
Harry keeps his face blank, although this time it is a challenge.  He’s found, especially with Wizard-kind, its better to get information if you don’t quite let on how you’re feeling about what you’re being told.
“You think?” Harry snaps, ripping the letter back and shoving it deep into the bowels of his robes, praying he won’t have to think of it ever again.  It’s not to be though, as Ron is both persistent and a wanker.
Harry casts a glance at Hermione who nods encouragingly and turns to lead them out of the Headmaster’s office.
“I got your em…proposal,” Harry said.  “To be honest, Boot, I didn’t really think you were interested in me like that, or y’know, at all really?”
Grumpily, he makes his way downstairs where he is unsurprised to find that most everyone else is up as well.
“Yea, about that George…” Harry started. “I was hoping you could help me out here a little, I hear male Omegas are somewhat rare.”
“Uh,” Harry coughs.  “Actually, I really would like to track down Hermione, so if the two of you would just excuse me….”
She had a plan to protect you and to her, it looked like you were just leaping into the fire anyway.”
She let go of his hand and fished around in her robes before pulling out a small velvet pouch and handing it to him.
Remus waits for Harry’s nod, continues, “what you might not realize is that you now have something called scent-memory.
“My grandmother is an Alpha, and my parents were both Alphas as well.  My mother was my father’s second.  As I’m sure you know, it’s unusual for women to present Alpha, almost as rare as it is for males to present Omega,” Susan begins, and Harry raises an eyebrow but keeps his silence, his look encouraging her to go on.  “My parents were part of a large Coven, almost all of whom died in the last war.  There were two omegas, and one of them gave birth to me.  By all accounts, the three of them shared deep affection, and although the omega wasn’t exclusive with them, she was happy to help them have a child.  It is unusual for Alphas to mate for life in the way that my parents did, but the Bones have always been unusual.  There hasn’t been a Beta born in our direct line for generations, but Omegas are fairly rare, so we aren’t as prolific as a lot of other lines.”
"What is it?" Harry demands and Fleur turns to him, her face a confusing mixture of relief and anxiety.
Harry hasn’t spent the last 3 years becoming intimately familiar with his friends’ quirks for nothing.  It’s reciprocal.  He can see the recognition of his rage in Hermione’s expression immediately.  What he doesn’t see is any contrition, and that just spikes his ire further.
“How do I make it stop?” Harry demands, skipping over the question entirely and getting to the heart of what he wants to know.
Hermione half turned to look at Ron. “Ron, go gather the Coven.  It’s time.  Meet Harry and me in the Room of Requirement in about an hour.   Have Dean run to the Owlery first and send Malfoy some of the chocolate stock and a note of thanks from me.”
Smith and Nott both double-take at the extra appendage but don’t say anything as the redhead pulls the slender vial up to eye it skeptically.
“Oh yea,” Harry muttered, leaning back and picking at the grass under his fingers with barely suppressed bitterness.  “Another thing I’m looking so very forward to.”
Fleur's Patronus - a slender swan - rushes off with her message and Harry decides to march to the tune of her drum for now.
Harry stares.  “There’s so much that scares me about what you just said, I don’t even know where to start,” he tells her earnestly.  He can see that she’s offended, but honestly, what is he supposed to do with that?
Hermione nods, looking sad.  “It’s true.  It seems to be a side effect of magic.  Betas alone aren’t strong enough to pass it down.  Usually a Beta pair is completely infertile but, rarely, they produce Squibs.  Only Alphas and Omegas, who are significantly stronger magically seem to be able to pass down the full magical gene expression.  It seems like that’s why these dynamics popped up in the first place - evolutionary markers to identify who could successfully reproduce.
“I’m sure it must be confusing for all of you,” she tells them leaning forward eagerly in her armchair, palms flush against her thighs.  In spite of her welcoming and kind aura, there’s something about her that Harry instinctively dis-likes.  So far this feeling isn’t justified though, so when she glances at him he sends her a wavering half-smile; she smiles warmly back and continues her opening address.  “You suddenly have all these new instincts and you’re expected to just fall into this Wizarding culture that you had absolutely no way knew existed.  Stricture is really cruel in that way.  That’s one of the things that we’ll talk more about in this class - the history of Stricture.  In subsequent lessons we’ll talk in depth about all these new instincts you have, the culture you’ve suddenly entered, and how some of you may have futures that are a bit different than how you originally imagined them.”
Harry hesitates when he sees her but Ron gives him a friendly push and he reluctantly sits next to her while Ron settlesh himself adjacent to Hermione.
“Ah,” Harry says, belatedly understanding what Hermione has already figured out.  Ron’s face twists a little bit but he nods next to Hermione.  “I’ll ask George to escort you.”
Feeling sullen, Harry leans back himself, crossing his arms and fighting to keep his face expressionless while Stebbins natters something he doesn’t pay attention to, lost in thought as to what she had just told him.  Whatever the Alpha asked, the answer was brief because it wasn’t much longer before Burbage was standing up and ushering them out of the room.
Harry was focused on something else at this point though.  “Is that common?” he asked, and spared a moment to think he probably could have asked that a little less gruffly in the wake of such a revelation.  Burbage turned her attention to him without looking too ruffled by his tone though and shrugged in response.
Which was a fair concern.  The first time he had encountered Malfoy after his Season, the boy walking into a classroom nonchalantly, Harry’s entire focus had snapped to the other boy.  His scent was heady, and, Merlin help him, he couldn’t take his eyes off the Slytherin, suddenly finding things to admire in the Alpha that he had barely noticed before - the intense and intimidating way he could focus on someone or something, the sharp and cunning jabs he would make to prove a point, his shining blonde hair and Quidditch-honeds muscles, and the pale grey eyes that centered on Harry in amusement when he noticed the Gryffindor’s attention.  It took Ron jabbing him with an elbow to pull Harry’s focus away.  Even then, he always knew where Malfoy was in a room, the same as he did Hermione.   It was disconcerting.
She does.  He breathes in and out, in and out, the way he used to when he was hiding in his cupboard as a kid, running away from Dudley or trying to comfort himself after another one of Aunt Petunia’s cutting remarks.  The breathing helps and after a few moments he manages to look at the other Gryffindor again.
Only Hermione and Ron had Presented in time to attend the Ball last year, so the Coven listened attentively as they were told what to expect.  The un-Presented would be kept distracted by the Halloween Ball, held the same night in the Great Hall.  The Presented students would join for the first part of the evening before excusing themselves discretely to attend the Coven Ball on the grounds of the Quidditch Pitch.  There would also be a celebration of Samhain, which Harry, in spite of attending Hogwarts for the last seven years, hadn’t realized was such an important holiday to Wizards until he was told about it in context of this Ball.
A few notes - this is definitely an AU.  Harry & co are in their 7th year, making them 17 and in this universe there is an 8th year that Fred & George are part of (I know they're 2 years ahead in the books, but in this case, they're only 1 year ahead).  The reason for this is that Wizarding society feels that young wizards and witches need slightly longer in school to adjust to their new dynamics in a safe environment after they are released from Stricture.  Since most present around 16, they get about 2 years in their fledges before they have to adjust to Coven structure in the real world.
Ginny raises an eyebrow at the exchange but doesn’t ask questions, which Harry feels inordinately grateful for.
Fred is standing in front of the large fire and looks at them all appraisingly as they approach.  The crowd quiets and he begins.
But Bill is actively pumping out calming pheremones and Fleur’s warm hand squeezes his and he feels suddenly more relaxed than he’s ever felt before.
He takes it from the blonde, holding it loosely in his fingers and keeps a steady gaze on the Slytherin.
I had an excellent time today and enjoyed both you and your Covens’ company. As far as I’m concerned, it’s Belle’s decision what she tells people about her condition.
He’s fighting opposing emotions of ire at his potential courting partner’s protracted silence, relief that one way or another, at least now it seems he’ll be getting some answers, and anxiety as to what those answers may be.
Taking the hint, he shifts so he stands a little behind her and tries not to reveal how relieved he is at the action.
Harry attends Susan when she slips into full Season, and the empathy he feels as he watches her pain and desperation as she struggles her way through twelve hours is overwhelming.  He spends the hours alternating between coaxing her into drinking water to offset the massive amount she’s lost through sweat, petting gently up her arms to give her some feeling of solidarity and talking to her softly, even as she keens and moans.  He can tell she loses herself to it at times, and finds himself relieved when she does.  When Olive comes in to help him change the sheets about mid-way through Susan’s cycle, she informs him that while they are all much the same, Susan’s rips through her fast and furious, given the limited time she’s in full season, and that the intensity an Omega feels at any one time can vary based on the length between cycles that Omega’s have and the duration of their full Seasons.
Indeed, the arm is awkwardly long, perhaps three inches longer than the others, and slender at the wrist with long fingers, delicate looking.
“Besides the important reason that we want to look out for our friend,” Hermione continues, glaring at Seamus before continuing.  “Vying for rank is a hallmark of Coven society.  Even if we decide to dissolve our Fledge after graduation, future Covens as well as employers will want to know how our Coven performed inside of Hogwarts when considering us to join their ranks.  It’s as much as part of the vetting process as our NEWTs.  Aside from that, its not just Harry’s dating prospects I’m concerned about.  If any of us want to date outside the Coven, we’ll need to be in good standing to do so.  There are not as many restrictions when it comes to Beta courtship, but there are still rules to follow, and the more powerful Covens often have more negotiating power. Is that enough reason for you all?”
Fred cast a glance at George, “Don’t stray,” he said and gestured with his head that he and Hermione should step away.  They leaned in for a private discussion at a table nearby and Harry raised an incredulous brow at George.
Tries to compose his thoughts cleanly while his body is still trembling in its physiological response.
The Betas all righten up.  The Alphas walk towards and then through the crowd of Betas, which parts for them respectfully and when they have come to the end of the Betas, the Beta’s all turn so their backs face the fire and the Alphas are at the head of each Coven, facing the remaining, lone Omegas head on.
What Hermione had promised when they had their talk by the lake - that there was a lot more to this whole Omega business - proved undeniably true over the next few days.  First there was the horrendously embarrassing talk with George who, as the only other male omega around, had apparently drawn the short straw amongst the Omegas in the school and was forced to break the news to Harry that not only was he suddenly going to be the center of attention on the merits of his fertility, but soon his body would start actively enticing nearby Alphas with its scent as he went into what George politely phrased as his ‘season’.
Angelina shifts at his side, looking ready for a fight, dark eyes flitting around the table, rapidly, assessing.
Ron rolls his eyes at him and Harry just grins back, taking a giant bite of his oatmeal, suddenly feeling a little bit more in the spirit after all.
Harry wonders absently why it’s only now that they’ve Presented that Nott has made it onto their radar.
The Beta’s stop in front of their Alphas, who have turned their back to the fire to face their Betas face to face.
“Have you noticed that Wizards don’t have that many children?” Hermione asked, leaning back on her elbows and gazing out over the lake.
“No one is quite sure where magic came from,” Burbage says, “but there has been wide consensus in the field of magical theory for many years that it has a form of sentience.  That is - it is not a passive force in the world that exists only for Wizards to tap into at will.  To some extent, magic appears to have its own will and agenda.  This has been proven, for example, in the occasional genesis of new magical creatures and beings - forms of life that have been shaped by magic Itself.  Other ways that magic has proven It’s intent has been in the development of new forms and styles of magic.  There is more that we do not understand about magic and It’s intent than what we do, but we know that the most important goal It possesses is its continued existence.  Magic, for example, has provided insight via the future arts and the gift of prophecy in order to avert crises in the past that would have resulted in large numbers of magical deaths.  It played an active role in the development of Hogwarts and other magical schools and it shaped places like the Forbidden Forest to protect its creatures.
He brushed against Malfoy at the ingredients table, who reached out to steady him when Harry stumbled.  Malfoy had been on much better behavior since they had begun their seventh year; although by no means friendly, he had stopped taunting Harry and his friends at every available opportunity and seemed to be working off a goal of just ignoring them as much as possible instead.
Susan lets her hand drop and nods, thoughtful.  She purses her lips and then seems to decide how to proceed.  “The last Omega in my line was my great-grandfather, my grandmother’s Oma.  My other great-grandfather was Alpha, a dangerous man by all accounts.  My grandmother’s Oma was the Bones.  We carry his name because my Alpha grandfather was sent to Azkaban fairly soon after my grandmother was born.  My grandmother didn’t want the reminder of his name ”
"The three of us, we need to be smarter in our dealings with the Order in the future," Hermione nods.
“I thought you and Hannah kind of had like…a thing,” Ron said after a moment.  “Can’t imagine she’s going to be very happy with you suddenly all interested in Harry like this?”
Thinking about Malfoy had Harry battling back a blush.  As Hermione had promised, ever since his season, he had begun to find the Alphas he came across in the school more and more alluring.  Even Hermione had caught more his attention, her pheromone scent intoxicating to his newly interested Omega brain.  He had no romantic interest in her of course, but he found himself turning to face her whenever she entered a room, and listening with rapt attention when she chose to speak.  She had noticed of course, and for her part had seemed bemused if a little sad.  What she was more concerned about was how he would react to the competing Alphas in the school.
“Hey there Alpha,” Dean says, smiling at her from across the room.  “Sent over that chocolate and thank you note as requested.  May need to refill our stocks at this rate.”
The Beta girl had knocked on the door early the following morning and Harry, who had had very little sleep, allowed himself to be cajoled into going down for breakfast and leaving the Omega-sitting to her.
Dean nods passively, not showing much interest either way.  It’s a smart move on Hermione’s part.  Dean is significantly calmer than Seamus, and he and Zabini have always been friendly, much to the consternation of Seamus.  Seamus and Luna will make an odd pair, but Luna’s oddness paired with her loyalty to Hermione can probably serve to disrupt any shenanigans Seamus may wish to start.   Luna can be strange, but she’s always had a good head on her shoulders and he and his friends have always trusted her.
“I understand your sentiment, Omega Weasley,” Nott says smoothly, “but surely you could at least see what we’ve come to offer first-“
As soon as she had shared the news that Fred and Bill were both in Fight, he had jolted towards the door, but the French Omega fluidly intercepted him, reaching out a hand to grasp his shoulder and look him in the eyes.
“Yes, that’s true.  And someone with full Sight is known as a Seer.  But as much as Professor Trelawney likes to tout she’s got the Sight, there hasn’t been a full Seer in generations.  Not since Cassandra Trelawney.  It’s a dangerous gift.  It drove Cassandra mad.
Harry splutters, hands fidgeting in surprise at the pet name and he shoots a glare at the man, annoyed at him for the chuckle he gets at his reaction.
Slowly he pulls the ribbon and tugs open the package to find a baby blue blanket with gray patches spilling out.
“Wasn’t aware you were joining us in Transfiguration, Terry,” Ron says, easy as anything and Harry lets some of his irritation with his friend subside.  Boot looks confused for a second before he clearly remembers his mission.
“Don’t worry, mate,” Ron says, smiling up at him, “We were all ‘orders of business’ at once point or another.”
“How’s Zachy-bear?” George asked, and Harry raised his eyebrows in question.  Distraction accomplished as Susan blushed at the question.
Harry’s face goes bright red at his friend’s expression and he holds up his hands in a classic expression of faux innocence.
Quietly assessing, Harry takes Remus’ invite to settle on the couch while Remus takes the sofa chair.
“The Order isn’t our enemy,” Harry reminds them both, “and I’m not naive, I know that my best interest isn’t their top priority, but I’m pretty confident I know what it is - ending a war.
“Betas, you may approach,” Fred said after the last loaf has turned to ash.  The vast majority of the crowd surges forward to approach their individual Alpha - while some Alphas may be without a Coven, like Nott, there are no such Betas.
“Mrs Weasley has been a great mentor for me,” Hermione continues, “but we don’t agree on everything.  Harry, I made a commitment to you, that I’d give you as much freedom as I possibly could.  I’m your friend first, and I’m not going to control you.  We have to trust each other to keep you safe.”
“No,” Hermione shook her head.  “There are others of course, two in America, two in China, one in Africa; a few more spread out across the world.  But the Wizarding population has been in a slow decline a long time.  Its part of why Voldemort has been able to arouse so much pureblood support.  His followers aren’t just disgusted by muggles, they’re afraid of them.  Muggle have 2, 3, more children whereas most pureblood families max out at 1 or 2.”
“I won’t lie and say I’m not a little confused,” Harry admitted, flopping into the chair opposite and moving a hand up to rub against his temple.  He’s started to be able to pick up traces of people’s designation now, but the new information is making him a little dizzy.  It’s almost like a smell, but not really.  He could tell that Ron was a Beta earlier, just by being in the same room with him, it was intuitive, and now he can tell that George is an omega.  It’s frankly weird.
“You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,” Hermione promised fiercely.  “But you might find that your tune changes a bit after Heat.  Omega instincts are apparently very powerful things.  I know from the Alpha side that my own can be fairly difficult to resist at times.”
Olive told me she has Tuesday free and I can cover Monday so we just need someone who can help on Wednesday.”
George was in his usual spot in the Common Room when Harry approaches him, poring over a Charms textbook in an armchair near the fireplace.  Harry would’ve previously thought him to be alone, but more attuned now to the hidden dynamics of his peers, he noted Angelina’s attentiveness from across the room.
She leads him out of the castle and down to the lake, where they sit staring at the water for a moment before Hermione finally seems to gather her resolve.
Hermione looks like she has pieced something together though, and accustomed as he is to her explaining most things about the Wizarding World to him, he simply turns a patient expression to her.
Suddenly struck by unexpected emotion, Harry flinches back, drops his eyes, knows his scent is edging toward distress.
Malfoy smirks at him when he sees Harry’s blush, but his eyes are laughing, not cruel, so Harry can’t find it in himself to be perturbed.  Besides, the Alpha’s scent is intoxicating him somewhat, in such close proximity, and he finds himself swaying closer to the Slytherin.  Hermione frowns and reaches a hand out to grip around his arm, squeezing gently in warning.  Harry finds himself grateful for the grounding and shakes his head slightly to clear it.  It helps, but only a little.
Hermione navigates them to where Malfoy is standing with an arm slung around Padma.  Harry fights back the irrational wave of jealousy that springs up in him at the sight but Malfoy smiles at them both, friendly enough, and drops his arm from around Padma after a quick squeeze to her shoulder.
The Cannon’s Seeker is displaying nearly technical perfection in his surveillance, and he’s been able to misdirect two of her Beaters in the course of the game so far.
Was there any good news about Presenting Omega? Merlin.  Harry internally rolled his eyes before casting around for something else to talk about to get them off this dreary topic when Susan was already clearly suffering.
“Portkeys don’t come cheap,” Ron observes, voice low and tone noteably flat. Harry spares a thought to wonder if it’s his friend’s typical reaction to ostentatious displays of wealth that is driving his reaction or interest in the other Coven’s response.
Refusing was putting us in an untenable position - Hermione was already threatening to take an action we can’t afford to execute.”
“As my Second, Ron will need to make the rounds with the other Covens as well, specifically making his greetings to the other Seconds, particularly Zacharias Smith and Blaise Zabini.  Dean - can you partner with Ron?”
When I had last worn my best dress robes, I had accidentally got them caught up in a tree and torn the sleeve.
Angelina rolled her eyes; “Oh, I’ll tell your brother alright.  Don’t move, Omega.” She turned quickly up the stairs to the boy’s dorms.
Didn’t learn too much about the others in the Coven yet, but Leo says she’s dating one of the Betas. What does Oberon do, Harry?”
“I can’t believe I ever defended you,” Ron grumbles, staring sullenly out the window of their shared booth on the Hogwarts Express.
“Harry needs to finish his Potions essay,” he tells Travers curtly, reaching out to physically pull Harry away from the Alpha.
“Yea,” Harry mumbled, Ron’s conciliatory tone taking some of the wind out of his feathers.  “Yea.  Thanks, mate.”
Harry blinked at him slowly, not really sure what to say.  Eventually he went with, “Um, Vincent…Sir, no one has really explained to me why everyone is so worried about Omegas being abused.”
When they take their seats, Oberon settles in next to Harry, draping a proprietary hand over Harry’s knee.
But she doesn’t like the Order making decisions about what to do with you behind our back and only coming to us with their desired outcome.
Harry’s mouth drops in surprise and he turns to look at Malfoy but the other boy has already started to walk away.
He sets his silverware down with a clank, avoiding everyone’s eyes as he takes the letter from the owl, who turns a wing and is gone as suddenly as he appeared.
There are at least three rooms in addition to a bathroom - a bedroom, a small kitchen, and a living area where a small couch and sofa chair, desk, and bookshelf have all been fitted.
“Yes, she apparently rejected Zacharias Smith’s proposal the other day and he’s not taken it well.  Their whole Coven is in turmoil over it - and not at a good time.  Look at the idiot - brooding over there alone when he should be helping his Alpha negotiate this party.”
“Officially, we’re allied with Fred’s Coven,” she said when they had all gathered out on the Quidditch Pitch during a calm Saturday morning.  She was pacing in front of where they all sat sprawled on bleachers, in the more open space before the bleachers dropped off to leave visibility to the Pitch.  Ron was looking uncommonly serious, though Harry suspected that was more to impress his girlfriend than because of anything she was about to say.  Luna is manipulating some sort of shimmering ball of light that she’s miraculously kept from Hermione’s sight.  Every time the Gryffindor Alpha turns away, the light reappears in one of the Ravenclaw Beta’s hands and jumps around her in excited circles until Hermione turns back in her direction.  Harry’s not quite sure how she’s doing it, but the spectacle has caught his, Dean and Seamus’ attention, and they all keep sending each other incredulous looks every time it happens.  Luna, for her part, appears completely innocent, and pays no attention to the light when it appears.
Zacharias moans, low, from both pain and the desolation he must feel as the Coven bond is stripped.  Finally, Flitwick approaches and uses the stretcher spell to take the boy to the Hospital Wing to get looked at.
He meet’s Fred’s eyes without concern, vanishing the proposal with a flick of his wrist, and Harry takes a moment to admire his friend’s mastery of the wandless magic, even if it is a relatively simple spell.
“Ah yes, I saw your Alpha conferring with her Second not long ago outside the library.  A favorite haunt of hers, no?  Perhaps you should go there.  Directly.”
“Alpha Granger, may Merlin smile on you and yours,” Fred said, smiling at her and maintaining eye contact.
The normally boisterous, mother-hen Alpha had become quiet herself, so much so that Arthur had actually taken on the mantle of serving up the breakfast fare and cajoling his children and guests into additional heaps of food.
If he’s honest with himself, he has ever since Malfoy stood up for him against Nott, and especially since the Dance.
Before he knows it, he realizes he’s sinking to his hands and knees, head tipped to the side to bare his neck, making low, whimpering sounds.
“Yes, Sir,” Hermione responded as sweetly as anything, but Harry knew his friend and he could tell she had her back up.
“I see you’ve all gotten comfortable,” Hermione comments from Harry’s side, but her voice is light and he can tell she’s feeling some of the same warmth he’s feeling at having their friends with them.
“What was that all about?” Harry asks after a few minutes, genuinely having not really noticed when Susan left.  Olive rolls her eyes and picks her book back up, thumbing through it in such a way that Harry knows she’s still not really reading.  He’s never really interacted with the 6th year before and he doesn’t have anything against her, but there’s something about her right now that’s putting him on edge.  George eyes them both warily but answers Harry’s question easily enough.
It’s an incredibly rare Potion - requires hard-to-aquire ingredients, an unusually long brew-time, and a high-level of Potions-making proficiency - all of which drive up the cost substantially.
All of a sudden, Harry feels like he’s able to breath again, pulling in an almost panicked breath of air, as he feels the morose lift away.
“What will Granger have to say about that decision?” the Ravenclaw replies, because he clearly has a chronic foot-in-mouth problem.
The official turned to look Harry square in the eyes.  Abruptly his demeanor shifted.  “Mr. Potter, might I speak to you privately?”
“What do you want, Nott?” Hermione snaps, clapping her book shut and turning a level gaze on the other Alpha.
She trails off awkwardly at the end of that thought, clearly thinking about Fred’s bizarre behavior towards George and Harry fusses with a loose thread on his Weasley sweater from last year.
He can’t help but suddenly feel remorseful, then, that he couldn’t do this with Hermione, one of his best friends, and that they were still at odds with each other.
Harry quirks an eyebrow at him, but Travers doesn’t notice, merely resuming their slow walk, this time towards the Great Hall.
Dumbledore’s speech had the tone of something that had been said more than a few times, and Harry was starting to believe that this really was a situation that had not been conspired against him.  And it was true that his friends had been a bit standoffish this year.  They hadn’t been…ignoring him… per se, but they had been spending a lot more time together without him.  He had thought at first it was just Hermione and Ron’s budding romantic relationship and had worked hard not to feel like a third wheel.  It was almost a relief to find out that there was this additional factor at play.
As one, the Betas bow to the Alpha in front of them.  All of the Alphas stand, stone-faced to accept the offering.
Harry runs a thumb over the top of Susan’s hand, hoping he can give her some small degree of comfort.  If nothing else, he can empathize with the loss of family by violent means.  After a moment, Susan continues.
“What? No.  Nott approached me in the corridor, it was bloody strange, he barely said anything but he, I dunno, growled at me when I tried to walk away.  Malfoy calmed him down, I guess.”
Burbage looked somber.  “A tragedy,” she said, “Rare thank Merlin, but a tragedy to any to whom such a fate befalls.  Many choose to leave the Wizarding World altogether.  Others languish in obscurity, unable to bond to Covens as Wizards must.  All of the un-Presented have also proven completely infertile.”
Harry furrowed his brows.  “I thought that all of the Wizarding World is based around Covens.  If he’s unpresented, then the Stricture means we can’t even tell him anything about this…”
“I hope it’s to provide some sort of explanation,” he responds eventually, settling for lifting a brow.
Fleur, quiet, slips over as well, sitting on the edge of the other side of the bed, and trailing a hand to settle on the boy’s upper arm.
Harry grimaces, he’s not used to that kind of attention, it’s uncomfortable after the kind of upbringing he’d had with the Dursleys.
“But that was the full expression of the gift.  There are lesser expressions, permutations like I said.  Prophecy is one of them” - Harry hides his reaction here, familiar as he is with this particular ‘gift’ - “What my great-Oma had was Premonition.”  Susan pauses again, meets Harry’s eyes.
When all the Omega’s are kneeling, heads bent demurely, Fred continues; now standing at the front of his own Coven to face off across from his kneeling brother.
“You all know Harry.  He’s been a part of our family for years, even if this is his initiation into the Coven as such.  He’s led us, protected us, fought with us, and yea, sometimes annoyed the bloody hell out of us.”
I know you’re scared for him, scared that what happened to your brother, your sister will happen to him—“
Harry crinkles his brow, not really sure how to translate what Fleur is saying into his experiences thus far with Alphas.
Nott’s … growl, for lack of a better word has cut off with Harry’s lack of movement and Harry’s new senses are picking up … contentedness? from the other wizard now.  Thoroughly freaked out by all the new inputs, Harry keeps holding himself still even as Nott takes another step closer to him and he’s not exactly sure what would have happened next if there wasn’t the sound of a polite clearing of the throat suddenly reaching both of them from somewhere behind Nott.
Molly beams at him, clearly pleased he’s decided to play along, even in a less than enthusiastic manner.
Padma by far has the longest season, followed by George, whose season lasts three full days and then Harry at 60 hours.
“It’s easier, sometimes,” she continues, “to think of it as some other creature that you have to keep content in order to live the life you want to lead.
Aghast, Harry is leaning forward to question that assertion further, but Burbage is clapping her hands and leaning back.  “I think we have time for one more question today.  Who’s up?”
Ron sobers slightly, looking around skittishly for a second before concluding on one else had overheard them.
Ron has found Harry by now and he and Dean had crowded to either side to watch the spectacle.  “The professors couldn’t interfere,” Ron told Harry quietly, obviously sensing his question.  “This is an official Coven event and it is agreed that Coven dynamics rule.  Ernie has the absolute right to punish his Second and to defend any attack against his Omega.  Are you okay, mate?”
“Olive,” George reprimands, voice taut.  “There’s no need to be so crude.  And that’s not what we’re going to be doing anyway.  It can be a little overwhelming is all, Harry.  Having other Omegas - ones that are not also in season - is soothing.  We’ll talk to you, touch you a little - not anywhere private, I promise.  And we’ll help you keep hydrated and fed.”
Harry forgets about Fleur entirely, instantly fretting over George’s still figure as Ron lowers him onto his bed, eyes sweeping over his form looking for injury.
Ron pointedly takes a few steps back towards the Greenhouse, examining some of the curious plants on display, conspicuously present, but just out of earshot as Harry makes the reluctant approach to where Malfoy is waiting.
Harry blushed at the indirect compliment but just nodded.  “I assume you’ll be taking over for him as Captain next year?”
But Fleur lets go of Bill’s hand to reach across and grab Harry’s instead and the French girl’s eyes are kind when they meet his.
“I’m afraid I have two left feet,” Harry says, embarrassed by the grace that Malfoy shows as he twirls him about.
“What your Headmaster has not yet mentioned is that Covens can be rampant with Omega abuse,” the cranky looking Ministry official spoke up suddenly.  The man had been sitting in a chair across the room from the rest of them, dressed in drab brown robe and looking entirely uninterested in the proceedings. He had a large black portfolio in his hands that he had previously been engrossed in when Harry had woken up to find his hospital room quite filled with people.  At the official’s words, the rest of the room swiveled to appraise him and he continued without much ado.  “Which is why the COA registers every new Omega and ensures that they are being properly cared for.”
He’s just in time to see Remus and Tonk’s sharing a kiss and he slows his approach and looks pointedly away from the two to try to give them as much privacy as possible.
Flour shuffles closer, pressing the heat of her body against Harry’s side and letting go of his hand to swing an arm around him instead.
“Belle is an extremely strong empath,” Oberon tells them, very quietly, and with more than one fervent glance around.
Fred had been much more circumspect in displaying and acting on his Alpha impulses in the days since and George had looked more relaxed and open than Harry had seen in some time.
“Hermione’s the only female Alpha in the school right now and you and George are the only male Omegas.  Those are rare presentations, mate.  But there are about seven female omegas in total.”
But in an instant, the scene is something else entirely.  Harry is fully in his own mind, aware and conscious, but he’s no longer on the bed, in the suite in the Omega Quarters.  Instead he’s somewhere he's not been before - a room in a pureblooded estate, perhaps?  It has that feel.  It’s a bedroom and Harry is shocked to see Zacharias Smith standing in the center of it, his hand fisted around Susan’s hair.  Susan herself is kneeling, naked, beneath him, her head forced back by Smith’s cruel grip.  There are bite marks everywhere - her throat, her nipples, her thighs, her ass, but the crown jewel of them is the fresh bonding bite mark on her throat.
The night of the Ball finally approached.  The Halloween Ball, which they would attend beforehand, was a casual affair, but the Coven Ball required more careful attire.  Harry met with the other Omegas to primp and preen - Merlin, he felt like a girl - and to dress in his deep emerald dress robes.  In pride of place on all of the Omegas robes - each sported a shining omega pendant.  Harry always wore his of course, but sometimes he opted to keep it inside his outer robes, hanging on a chain or just affixed to his shirt instead of his robes.  Today though, it was made clear to him that it was important that he wore it openly and proudly.
“Not as much as you,” it slips out and Harry flushes red and hot, but Malfoy chuckles, his timber low.
If anything, he considers himself a bit of a novice, really, at the sport and is interested in her expert opinion.
Hermione shrugged, looking sad.  “I agree its awful Harry.  In the views of the lawmakers, these restrictions are actually in place to protect Omegas.”
Malfoy drops his arms, pushing off from where he was leaning against the wall, and pockets his wand. He turns a casual smirk on Harry, raising an eyebrow in turn.  “I see Granger hasn’t given you the lay of the land yet,” he remarks and Harry scowls.  He can pick up that Alpha feeling from Malfoy too, but he doesn’t feel that same sense of danger he was getting off Nott, so he relaxes.
“The vast majority of presented witches and wizards are Betas, about six out of every ten wizards.  Out of that remaining four, three usually present Alpha, and form their own covens, while the remaining wizard will present Omega.  Because Omegas are so few in number, they are precious in our world and the main reason the Coven system began in the first place was to ensure the protection of their Omegas.  While our modern society has Covens of all types and dynamics, the original Coven was formed around Alpha and Omega pairs.”
Harry doubts the attempted interruption to the game was deliberate - the extra appendage has shown itself to have a mind of its own in the 24 hours since Ron had consumed the New Year’s candy George had so innocently offered him.
Zacharias tries to fight back at first but something prevents him from getting in any good hits, and after a minute he’s clearly beaten.  Luckily it doesn’t last too much longer.  Ernie isn’t a sadist, just an enraged friend.  When Zacharias is bleeding on the ground - the boy clearly has a broken nose - and no longer trying to fight back, the Hufflepuff Alpha stops.
Ron’s looking a little embarrassed at the topic, but he gives his friend a half smile.  “Well whatever it ends up being, you know me and ‘Mione are here for you.”
Harry shakes his head, as much in denial of what Hermione is claiming as an attempt to clear his head of her anger scent.
Thankfully it's only a moment before a large silvery ape Patronus charges into the room, blurting out its message to Fleur in rapid French.
Harry tried not to let his anxiety show too much as he waited for his second season - the one that would determine his cycle.  Every day that slipped by after his first, he breathed a sigh of relief.  Even putting aside the abiding desire to have as long of a cycle as possible, he was more than a little traumatized from his first experience with this physical requirement and wasn’t looking forward to the next.  He could tell his friends were similarly concerned, but were doing their very best to avoid the topic.  It’s not like talking about it would solve anything after all.
They’ve never really interacted before.  Sure, they have classes together, but the Houses don’t tend to mix much, especially Gryffindor and Slytherin.  Notts always been a loner too, not ever really adhering to Malfoy’s primacy in the Slytherin hierarchy and thus not making too many Slytherin friends.  Harry’s new, weird sense tells him that the other boy is an Alpha, and it’s a hot, intense sensation, one that perks his attention.  He felt something similar standing in Fred’s presence earlier, and it’s distinctly different than the almost calming sensation that George gave off and the fairly uneventful ones he’s been getting from Ron and Angelina.
When Harry has recovered as much of his composure as he thinks is possible following such an experience, when he’s showered and dressed in clean robes and drunk the potion George has left for him and eaten the chocolate that his fellow Gryffindor had promised would make him feel a little bit more himself before the older Omega had hurriedly excused himself to class, he chances a foray into the main common area to track down Susan.  She’s waiting for him - he can tell that’s why she’s there - and the furious rage that had seemed to encompass her after whatever that vision was is no where to be seen.  Instead she looks exhausted, but she shoots him a small smile when she sees him and pats the sofa seat next to her, lifting up the fleece blanket she has covering her lap in invitation.
He shot a glance at Hermione who met his gaze evenly, clearly conveying to him that she would follow his lead.
She framed it that way, too, which did little to endear her to him, but he was too tired to be drawn into unnecessary conflict this early in the morning.
He’s never seen anything good come from an Alpha near an Omega’s neck and his heart beats faster immediately.
Malfoy’s Alpha scent colors with confusion and concern, which only ends up putting Harry more on edge.
The two increase their pace to catch up and the foursome makes their way up to their seats where they reconnect with the rest of their respective Covens.
“At his Alpha’s own pace, brother.  You know that.”  Fred let a hand trail down to his brother’s head and ran it gently through his hair.  “You’ve irritated Angelina.  Apologize to her and return to your essay. We will discuss this further later, at the Coven meeting.”
Harry groans low when he catches sight of him.  He hears a suspicious sound to his side and turns to glare at his friend who is very clearly fighting back his chuckle.  “You have all the luck, mate,” the redhead says under his breath.
“My parents are pretty liberal for a Wizarding family,” Ron tacks on, “but in spite of, or rather because of, how much they love you and George, they’ll want us to play a more traditional role than we would have otherwise.”
The other is Belvina Burke; Also, as he understood, a family name, who instructed them, quite severely to call her Belle.
“Yes,” Vincent confirmed solemnly.  “Omegas enter formal mating arrangements instead of marriage like Betas and some Alphas choose to engage in.”
Remus, looking a tad sheepish, just shrugs, gesturing Harry inside and accepting the cocoa with a warm thanks.
I should have given you a heads up but I truly did not believe it would be an issue, as we usually have it well under control.”
It’s the most in sync Harry has seen them since his Presentation - a feeling of good will pervasive between them over the past few days.
The woman has always been an open book with her emotions so its strange to see her putting on an affected mood of forced cheer.
“This whole damn system is archaic, mate,” Harry responded tersely, pushing away from the table, appetite suddenly gone.  Ron rushes to meet him on the other side to continue their conversation as Harry storms out into the hall to head towards their morning Transfiguration class.
“Oh, Harry,” Ron looks surprised, but he pulls Harry closer to him, giving him a tight hug.  It should be awkward - they aren’t physically affectionate like that usually - but instead Harry feels instantly comforted nosing into where the crook of Ron’s neck meets his shoulder to soak in his calming Beta pheromones.
The three of them stand there for what feels like forever, tension racketing up until suddenly, Nott seems to break.  He turns on his heel, and without a word, walks away.  Harry turns his body a little to watch him walk away, feeling a larger sense of relief than he would have thought the situation really warranted.  After Nott’s turned the corner, Harry turns to appraise Malfoy, raising an eyebrow in question.
Unable to sleep, Harry lays on his side on the bed Fleur had just vacated where he can keep an eye on the other Omega, who doesn’t stir, not once, until morning.
Susan pauses and rubs her forehead wearily.  “This is…I’m coming at this sideways,” she says, sounding frustrated.  Harry hums, low and comforting and meets her eyes with gentle patience.
That’s when the Arrows really lost the game. She tried to come back, and did a passable job, but she was too far behind.”
The giant squid fails to make an appearance, but Harry and Travers have a good enough time regardless, just chatting casually.
Harry shakes his head to try to clear it, sniffling and simultaneously irate at his body for betraying him like this.
Ron’s third arm, clearly acting out on the boy’s curiosity, reaches out to snatch up one of the Potions.
After two hours, around 10 pm, Hermione gave the Coven the signal to head over to the Quidditch Pitch.  Harry had noticed other older students discretely removing themselves from the Great Hall for the last 30 minutes or so.  Making his excuses to Neville (and ignoring the strong thread guilt that wracked through him for it), Harry met up with the Coven in the corridor outside and the all traipsed down to the Quidditch Pitch….
A soft gasp from the questioning Hufflepuff girl whose hand stutters to her mouth.  Harry feels a wave of sympathy wash over him in response.  She clearly hadn’t heard anything about this.  He’s grateful again for Hermione, for that academic brain and the way she had detailed out the most important facts that he needed to know so that he didn’t have to find out that kind of secret so unexpectedly.
“This is linked directly to your trust.  I have the ability to give you an allowance and each month that allowance will deposit directly into this pouch.  I’ll never ask you what you do with that money.  It’s yours, Harry.  I promise. And if you need more, come to me.  I am afraid I have to join you on any trips to the bank, but I won’t ever say no.”
Dean and Seamus followed suit before the pendant made it back around to Hermione. Looking somber she repeated the spell and then, filled with some impulse Harry didn’t fully understand, he moved to stand in front of her.  Hermione held the pendant up to his robes and a second later it was affixing itself there magically, right on his left chest, above his heart.
“Wizarding Dynamics are not….necessarily predictable but there are certain patterns.  If a Wizard has abnormally strong magic, they tend to fall into either an Alpha or Omega presentation.  There’s a genetic component involved too, I suppose. But muggle borns with strong magic seem just as likely as purebloods with strong magic to present Alpha or Omega, so its not foolproof.  You’ve always been strong willed, extraordinarily lucky, and your magical abilities are far beyond the average wizard.  Some of that is your connection to Voldemort, I guess, but by all accounts your mother and father were extremely talented Wizards and you have a lot of inborn strength.
Harry shivers at the tone, not fighting himself when he feels the urge to tilt his head to the side, revealing more of his neck to the Alpha.
“Doesn’t work like that for Omegas.  If you had two already presented Alphas in different Covens that you were equally as close to, sure, maybe you get a choice; more likely they just fight it out and you end up with the winner.  But it’s a matter of survival for us mate and no one in any Coven is going to believe you don’t belong to Hermione unless you publicly declare for another Alpha and Hermione backs your claim.”
How does it get triggered? Why haven’t we seen it before? I would have expected Smith to have dropped into Fight - if not with MacMillan, then at least when Fred attacked him.”
“There’s … a lot more Harry, honestly.  And I promise that I will do everything I can to get you up to speed and help you thrive.  I promise.  I’ve only been an Alpha for a little while myself, but every day I understand more and between you, me and Ron, we’ll make it out okay.”
It’s not just cards either, and Harry is happy to see them back to their old antics - even if it is at the expense of his best friend.
“They have power over me, don’t they? Alphas?” Harry finally asked the question directly, acknowledging that he already kind of knew.
There’s a lopsided reindeer of unusual proportions gallivanting across his sweater, threads subtly restitching themselves as it makes its way up a snowy track that stretches from the lower left hand corner to the upper right of his jumper.
The boy looks harried in general, dark lines under his eyes, and a strange, frenzied energy about him - at least that’s what Harry thinks from a distance.
Voldemort is still alive and kicking in this AU and I've taken a number of liberties with canon events.  Dumbledore is still alive - obviously, as he appeared in chapter 1  - and Draco didn't try to kill him.  Sirius, however, is still dead.  There's a lot of plot around this in the story, so more details will arise. But figured I should at least give you some context for what you're reading.
I’m in control of it most of the time but complete control is potentially impossible, at least I’ve not learned of an Empaths who have it.”
The one Chaser - Ditwick, I think? - anyway, he’s got the talent for a trio of Chasers, so the Arrows have the advantage for that position, no question.
“You basically just told me I’m going to go into heat,” Harry says shortly, not in the mood to be entertained.
“I’m satisfied,” he agrees, reaching out to take the Potion and pocket it in his inner robe before assessing Smith and Nott and giving them each a curt nod.
At first…at first we weren’t even sure…but Bill was just unconscious and that seemed to calm Fred down.
Groaning he turns to head back to the Common Room.   But Theodore Nott is standing directly in his path.
It had missed, but Hermione’s startled and impulsive smack to Ron’s face had left Harry wincing in sympathy and Ron stumbling over his own apology.
She told me in some ways, she felt bad for them - always living right on the cusp of a great discovery and always thwarted in the end.
She’s carrying a bundle of knitted goods and it’s only when she is handing out a Weasley sweater to each person sitting around the table, that Harry realizes what day it is.
Maybe his decision would be different if he wasn’t already committed to courting Travers, but Harry doesn’t have the patience to double guess his decisions and if you’re in for a penny, in for a pound.
My ability to perform magic is not affected and anything that I, personally, enchant will stay enchanted.
She blows on the ink to dry then rolls it up and pockets it, presumably to give to Hedwig when next they see her.
Relaxing somewhat, Harry accepts her welcome, sliding in beneath the blanket next to her and leaning back against the cushion.  He wonders absently if Olive’s season has also passed, hopes it has and that it was less painful than his own.  He shoots a look at the closed door of the other private heat room, and Susan catches his glance.  “She finished up yesterday.  She has a fairly enviable cycle - two and a half months, about 10 weeks apart, about a day in pre-season, and two in full.  Padma sat with her through the height, but they both went back to Ravenclaw last night.”
“I’m not exactly an expert,” she says, “and you’re never going to be alone with them, not truly, so there’s really only so much you can get up to…”
But they had all survived the rest of the holiday and to all appearances it looked as though the twins’ relationship was back on the right track.
The horn sounds, calling the spectators to the stands and Harry and Oberon find Ron and Leo a few feet behind them.
“It’s an inborn instinct, Harry.  Omegas are coveted in the Wizarding World.  Because they can bare magical children, Covens lure them for bonding and sometimes surrogacy.  But Omegas are also magically strong, at least as strong as Alphas.  They have other gifts that they give Covens - many have unique Omegan gifts, such as prophecy or are irregularly attuned to the natural world. And they are fierce protectors - particularly of their offspring. No one is entirely sure why such a strong dynamic also grew to develop such weakness to Alphas, but here we are.  Some suppose it was a biological response to force Omegas to stay within the Coven and adhere to the Alpha so they don’t tear families apart after birthing offspring. Others tell a story of an infertile but magically gifted Beta who was so jealous of Omegas that they cursed them to eternal obedience to the Coven.  But no one really knows for sure and Stricture makes it even harder to research.”
“So what I want us to pledge today is that Harry has our protection,” she pauses, reaching into her robes and fumbles about in there for a second before pulling out a thing silver pendant in the shape of what Harry recognizes as the Greek letter for ‘omega’.
“Are you even listening to me?” Ron snaps, twisting toward them, third hand reaching out to snatch one of George’s cards from the edge of his hand.
Susan pats his leg atop the blanket then retracts and goes quiet.  They sit for a long time in a companionable silence.
“People have gone crazy in this place,” Harry responds.  “Fred ordered George to kneel, for Merlin’s sake.  Then Nott and Malfoy act all weird…”
“On this Samhain, as every Samhain, we honor our ancestors who have sacrificed so much and who’s legacies we cherish,” the Alpha started, his tone somber and serious.  “We honor those Alphas that fought for their Covens and defended our way of life.  We look to them for guidance as we face our own challenges and our own sacrifices.  Alpha, proffer your offerings.”
“Y’know if it was up to me, nothing would ever be enough to make up for what Smith did to you that day.”
Susan darted her head back around to look at him with a startled gaze.  “Oh Harry, no, of course not.  And I never will.  Zacharias is my Coven’s Second, and he hasn’t actually done anything yet for which I can accuse or confront him.  It wouldn’t be fair.  And I swear to you, I will never tell anyone of your gift of my own free will.  You must keep it secret.  If any Alphas find out….it’s a very valuable gift, Harry.  It will make you an even more desirable prospect than you already are.  Imagine, that any one with you during a season could see a glimpse of the future…well.”
Hermione is routinely snappish, particularly when stressed, but she is rarely this out of control of her emotions and she’s been especially careful after Harry’s Presentation, not wanting to unduly influence him.
But that was the wrong thing to say, because now Harry is thinking of Alphas.  Unbidden the memory of that fraught interaction between himself, Nott, and Malfoy rises to the forefront of his mind and Harry whimpers as he recalls the scent of the two Alphas, caught in a battle of wills over him.  He remember Nott’s low growl and Malfoy’s scent rising in challenge.  Almost beyond his notice, he comes.
They’re still in charge, but it’s in a way that makes you feel like something special, rather than just some prize that they’ve won or some tool that they get to control.”
“Yea, what we call wizard’s first Covens.  Covens are such an important structure to how the Wizarding World works and the Stricture is so pervasive that it really doesn’t work to just stay in the Coven you’re ‘born’ to.  By the time we present, we’ve been at school for years, made friends, and need to operate with these new dynamics right away.  So new Alphas create ‘Fledgling’ Covens or ‘Fledges’ to kind of practice being Alphas, and new Betas and Omegas join the Coven of the Alpha they are closest with.  Sometimes the Fledges become real, adult, lifetime Covens and sometimes they disperse and get brought into larger or different Covens after school.
“What you are, Harry.  That’s what you’ve presented,” she leaned forward, suddenly earnest.  “I promise, Harry, this wasn’t about keeping you in the dark.  I know you’re confused right now, but what you’re feeling now is something that everyone newly presented feels.  We aren’t allowed to discuss these things with neutrals.  But now we can tell you everything.”
Without direction, Harry feels his knees fold in, guiding him gently to the ground below him.  On either side of him, he sees the other Omegas doing the same, obeying the magic that is pulsing through all of them.  Hermione had warned him what to expect, but he hadn’t fully understood what it would feel like.
“It’s a muggle term,” Hermione informed him.  “Public display of affection.  And we’ll do our best, Harry.”
“It…..yea.  When I’m fighting the Imperius, I can hear these two battling voices - the one is the order, telling me what the caster wants me to do, but the other is my own.  If I’m in the right state of mind, I can choose which to follow.  This …. there weren’t any voices.  I didn’t…I didn’t think about it, I just responded.  When you told me to stay, my body just stopped….”
“My inheritance?” Harry wrinkled his nose, confused.  This was honestly the last subject he had expected to be addressing with his friend today.
The witch emanates a sort of mournful intensity, and in spite of the bustle around them, it’s such a compelling center of
George shrugs. “Now you know.  One day you’ll be the one giving this talk on the other side.  We look out for each other Harry.  We have too.  World’s a dangerous place for Omegas and our Covens try, but they don’t understand what we go through day to day.  Come talk to the rest of us if you’re struggling.  Dad reminded me the other day that generations of Wizards before us have gone through this same transition.  Presenting doesn’t have to be the end of anything, its just a rite of passage into something new.”
Harry’s distracted by unwrapping the third of his chocolate frogs and George chuckles a little bit and puts the box with the remaining frogs just out of reach.  “Enjoy that mate, but wait at least an hour before you start in on the rest, yeah?  The last thing you want is to make yourself sick just as your Heat is starting in earnest.”
“What about those who never Present at all?” Harry couldn’t help but ask, thinking of Neville and how the boy had started to look more and more forlorn as he was obviously becoming more and more aware that he was being excluded from something.  Harry’s heart ached to reach out to his friend, and he’d tried spending more time with him, but his schedule was busy these days between the Omegas and school.
“If you’re lucky, you might even get the chance to tickle its tentacles,” he informs Travers and the man smiles in delight.
“Alright,” Bill says, quirking his finger at Harry imperiously who finds himself drifting over to stand in front of him without making a conscious decision to move.
I learned a lot from her out there, but I mostly liked to lay out in the sun while she would prune or shear and listen to her stories.”
I can’t tell you more about it right now, but during our courtship, I promise, I will give you the full story.
“I have a friend who is feared by people who don’t understand him, just like you are apparently feared by people who don’t understand you.
“What is it, Omega? Has something happened?” Bill demands, hand still tangled with Fleur’s but eyes intent on Harry, addressing him directly.
“We just need to get through the ceremony and then we can go back to the Tower,” Hermione tells Harry, still clasping him tightly to her side as they move towards the bonfire.
The blonde gives him one last smile before turning on his heel and whirling away, leaving Harry feeling a little dumbstruck in his wake.
“I know.”  Hermione reaches out and sets her hand on top of his.  She leaves it there for a minute, a comforting weight, before she withdraws.
Burble nods.  “Alpha’s have the ability to hold the attention of Omegas - I’m not sure you would have yet experienced it? It’s called Alpha voice.”
“Oh don’t look at me like that.  I know you’re mad.  Come on, let’s have a talk before we have to meet the rest of them.”
Confused, the trio finishes up - Harry feeling more awake after downing his third cup of tea, with a disapproving Hermione looking on - and heads up to the Headmaster’s office.
She may have been amplifying the emotion earlier, but he can see she inherently tends toward the ill-natured and perhaps the sadness he was picking up for her was real.
“I am your Alpha,” Zacharias says, furious, his hand reaching down to twist into Susan’s red hair, curled carefully for the occasion.  “You love me.  You will obey me.  Tell me who you obey.”
When George comes out of it, he tells Harry that all the Omega’s will learn the spell but they’ll make a rule that it can only be used once an hour.  It’s too dangerous to become mentally dependent on it, and the Omegas already spend too much of their seasons begging for things they can’t have.
While Ron and Hermione head off to the Hospital Wing to set Ron’s body to rights, Harry and George wander down to the Omega Quarters to check in with their compatriots. Ginny accompanies them down, a discrete enough escort that even George doesn’t chafe at her presence.
“Olive’s about half-way through pre-season,” Padma informs them and George nods knowingly - the older Gryffindor is very in the loop when it comes to the other Omega’s cycles.  “Harry’s is just starting,” he tells the room and shuffles Harry over to settle in place in front of the fire.
“Miss…Granger, was it?”  the official stood now to approach Harry’s bed: Mrs Weasley, who had been holding Harry’s hand and smiling at him in that way she had - like he was something precious, frowned at the man and stood up at his approach, clearly finding his behavior somewhat reproachful.
“I’ll be in the library,” she says, voice soft, before taking off back in the direction of the castle.
“I could tell they were both Alpha,” Harry says, picking over his words slowly.  “It made me … nervous and excited at the same time?  When Nott growled at me, it was like I couldn’t move…I didn’t want him to be angry.  I wanted him to be calm.  When Malfoy showed up, I could sense their reactions to each other, and…and I just let Malfoy take the lead.”
Harry whines - the sound is involuntary and Hermione abruptly lets go, lurching away to sit several feet away from him.
Thankfully, the mind shields itself from what it can’t really comprehend.  And the fever is not inconsequential, it does its part in keeping Harry’s conscious thought absent.  He can tell the heat is building, building, building.  Susan is there with him at the worst of it.  He knows that he’s at the crest of the wave, that here is where he either crashes and dies or comes out whole on the other side.  He’s been mostly out of it, but he has a moment of cognition at the very height and he reaches out, desperate, for Susan, wanting the contact of another human being in this utterly terrifying fight.  She grips him and its like a dam breaking.
I wrote down the incantation and wand movement -“ He pauses, pulls out a piece of parchment from the pocket of his robe to hand to Harry.
The girl only cycles three times a year, which would be a blessing except she spends two days in pre-season and then a full nine days in season.
“I’m afraid that it is old tradition to have the Alpha of your Coven explain the state of the world to newly presented Omegas.  It’s an important rite of passage for Alphas and Omegas alike, and I will not interfere with it.  However, although I cannot proffer any specifics, I do want you to know that you have a voice.  You have the right to have a say in any mating agreements, first of all…”
I still think it was a little hasty to agree to the Order’s proposal so easily, BUT,” she rushes on, clearly sensing Harry has an opinion about that, “I stand by what I said originally.
“Alpha Granger,” Malfoy nods, not offering the same greeting as Fred as neither of their Covens are acknowledged as the superior Coven yet.
“Not a problem, dear.”  Then the Ravenclaw is gone. Susan stands and stretches then looks at George questioningly.
First that proximity spell, then the Fight and now what? You’re going to force him to consider a proposal he has no interest in?
He shifts Harry over to Hermione and finally starts to come back to himself as he breathes in her Alpha scent.  It feels like safety and he relaxes.  Meanwhile the rest of the Coven has found them, and Hermione nods them over to the bonfire that has started up on the other side of the Quidditch Pitch that is being used for the Samhain festivities.
His eyes, almond-shaped, and framed by generous, dark lashes, are a deep blue color that settle on Harry with an intensity that immediately has butterflies fluttering in his stomach.
“Where. Have. You. Been.”  He seethes, interrupting her before she can try to placate him. True to form, Hermione’s eyes harden at his tone, a mulish expression crossing her face.
The Alpha Second steps foward, fishing out something from inside her robes, struggling playfully to win it free.
There’s a set of constrains that being Omega imposes on us, but you have to remember that Alphas are constrained too.
for any tales of when the Ministry had to Oblivate muggles who came across ghosts in their daily lives.
We’ll go back to Terry’s home for my seasons going forward, once we figure out when they’re going to be.
Groaning he buries his head in his hands and fights back tears, caught somewhere between acute contrition and slow-burning rage.
He knows it was just a suggestion, but Fred’s words seem to carry weight with Harry’s frazzled mind and he is wandering around the castle before he realizes that he’s actually looking for Hermione.  Like an idiot.  She told him she had an errand.
But I kind of knew what I was getting myself into when I joined an 8th year-led Coven as a 6th year.
Harry nods but responds, “As much as I appreciate that, I have a feeling the last thing I’m going to want during season is you anywhere near me.”
The redhead looked like he was about to break into laughter again but he bravely held them back and nodded at his friend.  They turned back to the entrance to the Tower and headed up to class, a befuddled and embarrassed Ravenclaw left in their wake.
“Portkeys,” she announces, triumphant when she manages to pull the bag out, “for each of your students.”
Someone must have made a run to the kitchens because there are numerous treats nestled on the table in the center of the couches.
He’s showing he can provide for you, that he’s taking an interest in things you enjoy and appreciate.
“Ok, well we’ve discussed it and you’re over the initial changes.  You’ll start to pick up on everyone else’s designation in the next couple of days and most of the school has heard about your presentation, so you should expect to start seeing a lot of Coven behavior.  It can be weird at first, but we’ll walk you through things.  Everyone gives the newly presented a month or so to get used to the new way of the world, so you don’t have to worry about upsetting any other Coven’s accidentally for the time being.  Ron is going to take you back to the Tower.”
Harry is mollified to see Padma blush at Hermione’s greeting much as he does seconds later when Malfoy reaches for his own hand.
Harry is incoherent already but his body is in pain.  He hadn’t realized that season would hurt like this.  Realized belatedly, he had only thought of it in an abstract, embarrassed sort of way.  But now he realizes he'd do anything to make it stop.  And just as much as he’s in pain, he realizes that he’s also, horribly, unaccountably turned on, and that without his conscious consent, he’s pulled a pillow down to grind against.
“Can’t tell you too much without your Alpha’s permission mate,” George’s voice was light but he didn’t look Harry in the eyes, instead skimming the book in his hands.
“Tha’ wa’ nice,” Harry slurs, drunk on the power that had run through him momentarily.  Hermione nods kindly, and gestures Ron to gather the rest of the Coven before she leads him, swaying unsteadily, back inside.
“He really should have known better than to approach you like that. And to be so rude about it," Hermione frowned.  “Hopefully your future suitors will be more thoughtful with their proposals.”
Harry knew he had several more, but he suspected Travers might be intentionally spreading out the introductions, to get him slowly at ease with the rest of his Coven.
He dropped back out of Fight, passed out, magical exhaustion and that’s when we realized George was passed out too.
Clearly relieved that it hadn’t she gives him a quick but affection glare which he accepts with aplomb and leans in to answer the question in quiet tones.
“Omega Potter,” he says, pulling Harry’s hand up to linger by his mouth, where his warm breath tickles the hair on Harry’s fingers, “Your beauty is a treasured sight,” he says, pressing a kiss to the top of Harry’s hand and lingering there a touch.  Harry can’t help but feel just how much more intimate a greeting that was than what Fred had offered.
They can draw on your instincts to submit and make it into something beautiful, make it into something that doesn’t have to do with fear at all.
George, scent emmitting both fury and discontentment, crosses his arms, glaring at the proffered parchment as thought it was the Dark Lord itself.
“Yes,” Harry nodded, looking her in the eye.  He wonders if he’s misjudged her, he can tell she means every word of that. The others all nod at her and gave quiet affirmations, even Stebbins though his expression had turned a little sour.
“My point is, Harry’s our family, first.  He’s also an Omega and yea, that means a lot of people are going to be paying a lot of attention to him …”
He remembers suddenly how much he’s always liked the French girl, how her kindness had shown through even when they were competitors.
“He really prefers Zacharias, George,” Susan said, ignoring Harry momentarily. “As you well know.  And you’re still getting used to things Potter, so I don’t expect you to know, but most Omegas do get married pretty quickly after 8th year.  The school doesn’t permit bonding before graduation, but for me bonding offers a potential solution to a pretty massive problem in my life, so yea, I’m pretty eager to do it as soon as I can.  Besides, what am I going to do as a single Omega in the workforce?  Nobody will hire me, especially unbonded, and I’ll just be leaching off of my Coven’s resources until they can match me.”
Travers took his hand, fluidly manipulating it to press his lips to it in greeting, rather than shake it as Harry had expected.
“Don’t need a babysitter,” Harry grumbles but it’s half-hearted protest.  Ron isn’t listening anyway, groping around in his book bag until he finds what he’s looking for and hands it to Harry with a triumphant, “Ah ha!”  It’s a set of a half-dozen chocolate frogs.
“My parents are still my parents?” the Hufflepuff asked, lowering her hand slightly from her mouth and looking at Burbage so pleadingly it almost broke Harry’s heart.  “I…I kind of stopped reading the letter after they told me about Aunt Nadia…I was just so upset.”
Harry peers at the sight of his friend, passed out in the bed and sighs, “What have you got yourself in the middle of, mate?”
The important thing is , he's victorious in his quest and they all get down to the serious business of S'mores.
“Sorry, love,” George responds, patting her foot softly from where its lain under the blanket.  “At least it won’t last too long.”
“Tat was nice,” Harry slurs, blinking several times in succession to try to get the room to focus a little.
“Olive can speak for herself,” the girl snaps, tossing the book she had clearly not been focusing on onto the table irritably.
“Shhh, shhh, it’s okay Har,” Ron smooths running a hand up and down his back.  “It’s over now.  Here’s Hermione.”
“In this case - if I were a muggle and I came across a ghoul or something and never understood that it was just one aspect of a wider world, I think I would rather not know.
“Oh but whatever will you say?” Ron croons in a sing-song voice, ignoring Harry’s withering glare. “What will you say if Hermione denies you this incredible opportunity?”
“So you’re in control of everything my parents, everything Sirius left me?” Harry asked quietly.  He had never been particularly attached to the gold in his vaults at Gringotts, but it had been a comfort to know that it was there.  The fact that it could be stripped away from him just like that didn’t feel real.
The class takes place in a room Harry hasn’t been in before.  Instead of desks, were are armchairs arranged in a circle. The walls of the room are filled with Wizarding art - modern looking with dark lines but furious pastel swirls, clearly by the same artist.  When you would look away and then return your gaze you could see that the swirls had morphed, changed color and depth in your absence.  The room was warm with gentle lighting and a rug covering the floor.  The overall effect was that the room was alluring and rather soothing, Harry thought, as he sunk into one of the armchairs.
“Tell me about her,” Harry prompts, casting his eyes up to catch Oberon’s who smiles back before looking up in thought as they continue their meandering walk around the pitch.
Instead she just watches the French man quickly veer towards her brother and his fiance and continues on with the point she was making.
After a moment, it proffers the vial to Hermione instead who accepts it graciously with a quick little smile at her boyfriend.
When they enter the Quarters, Susan Bones is cuddled under a large furry blanket looking less that tip-top.  Harry frowns when he sees her but she sends him a shaky smile and struggles a hand out from where its buried beneath the heavy blanket to waggle her fingers at him tiredly.  “Hiya, Harry. Welcome to the club. Most exclusive in the school.”
“You heard me,” Hermione responds, unperturbed.  “You’re an Omega, everyone is interested in you.  Alphas are going to want to court you, Betas are going to want to recruit you to their own Coven.  The stronger our Coven is perceived by the rest in the school, the more respectful will be the advances, and the more leverage we will have in considering them.”
Luna, without a word, plucked the pendant from the redhead’s hands and repeated Ron’s motions.  She smiled after the pendant had fallen back into her palm and looked at Harry with searching eyes.  “Welcome to the Coven, Harry.”
“Omega,” Terry said sticking his pointed finger in Harry’s face like he's an idiot then turning it back on himself with a plaintive, “Alpha.”
As one, the Alphas use levitation to send their loaves of bread into the fire.  They hover there, in the flames for a moment, before disintegrating into ash.  In some sense, it may seem silly, but Harry was attuned with the magic around them and right now it was thrumming.  This was important, it meant something.
Specifically, the arm seems to be highly emotive, acting out on Ron’s otherwise well-controlled impulses.
“Look, Potter, the truth of it is that I was dealing with some family issues over the holidays that came to a head immediately after I sent my initial proposal.
“The idea is that a trusted Alpha can stand in between the Omega’s inheritance and any Alpha that might seek to take advantage.”
Harry slows his pace and the two walk in easy familiarity up to the Tower where their class takes place.  They’re early, beating even Hermione (who, as an early riser, had usually eaten breakfast and done an hour of studying in the library prior to her friends even waking up), but much to Harry’s chagrin, Boot is shuffling his feet awkwardly in the hallway leading up to the stairs up to the Tower, clearly waiting for Harry.
Which was beautifully adorned.  Fairy lights shimmered over the Pitch and there were high tables set about for groups to congregate.  There was live music here too - but it was classical rather than the screaming rock from the Halloween Ball, a cellist, pianist, and violinist had set themselves up on a slightly elevated stage to the far right of the half pitch that was being used.  Warming charms encompassed the area.  The teachers had told them that there was another charm too - one that would prevent the un-Presented from party crashing.  Speaking of teachers, there were chaperones - McGonagall and Flitwick, but they were keeping to the edges, merely watching the crowd with keen eyes.
My Beta, as well as Auror Tonks are waiting on site in case the Portkey should be activated, to escort the students directly back to Hogwarts.
Harry smiled at them.  “I’m happy for you, really.  Just do me a favor and keep your PDA to a minimum, yeah?”
We can remember the people we’ve met not just by their faces or their voices but also by their scents.
He’s not alone in the class - but he is the oldest.  The other three students are all 6th years - two Hufflepuff Betas, a Slytherin Beta, and a Hufflepuff Alpha that Harry instantly takes a disliking to.  The Alphas name is Joel Stebbins and he leers at Harry like the cat who found the cream when they both sit down in the classroom where they were asked to gather for their first lesson.
Harry shrugs.  “I did sit through a year of Divination.  Sight is the full expression of future magic.  It’s the highest form of Divination.”
Hermione pauses, considering.  She glances at Harry and must note his excitement because she smiles slightly and nods to Malfoy.  “Please, Alpha Malfoy, lead the way.”
It’s a striking image, such an utterly rare sight prior to their Presentation when they had both been so in sync.
Hermione leans towards him  - he hadn’t managed to back up very far and for a second Harry is afraid, afraid in a way he never could have conceived of being afraid of Hermione.  Then her hand comes up and passes his face to settle on the back of his neck.  Harry’s mind goes blank.  He can still take in his surroundings - he can see Hermione in front of him, feel her hand heavy on his neck, but he can barely move his limbs - it’s like moving through molasses and he doubts he could speak if he tried.  He’s glad he’s already sitting, because he doubts his legs could hold him.
Harry retract his hand and Fleur stands up, moves to her own bed and trunk, gathering the few belongings she has laying about, still listening as Ron and Harry continue speaking in low tones.
Harry has the occasion to compare the next day, when Susan has recovered and has fled back to Hufflepuff to try to catch herself back up.  By this time George has moved from Pre-Season to full, but his is slated to last a full 3 days.  Padma is taking the first six hour shift of his season with him, and when Harry goes in for the second shift, he finds George feverish and disgruntled, but still able to carry on a conversation with Harry, a marked difference from Susan six hours in.  George crankily tells him, that his season builds slowly and that by the following afternoon he’ll likely be as out of his mind with it as Susan was until he peaks the following day.
“Fred says there’s trouble afoot between Nott and Malfoy,” Hermione tells him, looping an arm with his.
Harry paused.  It felt…wrong, suddenly.  He shifted and then, before his conscious mind had really caught up, he found himself dropping gracefully to his knees.  Neither Ron nor Hermione twitched but he heard some shifting behind him from the other three and an uncomfortable clearing of the throat behind him.  Harry had never kneeled to anyone before, but in spite of the strangeness of the situation, it felt right to him and he couldn’t find it in himself to be embarrassed.
“Mrs. Weasley thinks I need to be strict with you,” Hermione said.  “It’s one of the few things we’ve disagreed on since she’s become my mentor.  She’s worried that if I’m lax, interested Alphas will take that as an invitation to pursue you in a more aggressive manner than is typically polite.”
A little shell-shocked, Harry glanced around at the rest of the awkwardly standing group before turning abruptly on his heel and walking briskly to meet Ron who was loitering at the corner of the hall, waiting to escort him to dinner.
George seems to sense his thoughts.  Quietly, he tells Harry, “Omegas are great friends most of the time.  We’re natural allies and usually Covens find that allowing their Omegas to interact can smooth over a lot of hurt feelings and conflict.  But we’re edgy during season, territorial.  To our hind brains, another Omega in season is competition, even though there aren't any Alphas here to fight over us.  It’s best not to take anything anyone says personally until they’re back in their right minds.”
“Do you not like Quidditch?” Harry hopes that’s not the case, given the man had been the one to organize this entire outing.
George does show him the ‘Omega Quarters’ (same floor as the kitchens, behind a moving bookshelf that only moved when you pulled out both ‘History of Magical Law Enforcement Volume II’ and ‘In the Days of the Last Unicorn King’ simultaneously, and then spoke the password, ’Borrowed Socks’ - such a random phrase must be effective - to the solemn visage of Arthur Pendragon in the portrait stationed there).  Dean accompanies the two to the bookshelf then purposely gets “distracted” by a painting on the other side of the room while George shows him how to access the hidden hallways.  Inside the Quarters, the common area is awash with soft pastel colors, a myriad of blankets, cozy chairs, and couches strewn across the room.  There are six or seven rooms off the common room for personal use and a bathroom with a large sauna and heated pool.
Abruptly, Malfoy directs them off the dance floor and must somehow signal Hermione, as she and Padma meet them immediately.  Malfoy gently disentangles Harry’s hand from where it has gripped into Malfoy’s dress robes, against his will, bringing the hand up to once again press his lips to the knuckles.
Bill’s hand stills from where it was running up and down and he turns to eye the younger Gryffindor contemplatively.
“This is an Omega pendant.  They’re an old tradition - passed down from pureblood families for generations to the Omegas born to them.  Harry,” she pauses, suddenly sounding a little nervous.  “This was your mother’s.  Apparently it was passed to her by your father’s mother when she decided to Bond with your father.  It’s a part of your inheritance and I hope its okay that I brought it here with me today.”
Bill can’t seem to help himself from shooting one last glare at his younger brother before he seems to come back to himself, smiling gently at Fleur and pulling her hand up to his lips to press a gentle kiss to it.
Deciding to try to distract George from his irritation, Harry waggles his brows, “Oh? Anyone here that you most don’t want Fred to protect you from?”
Harry can’t help but wonder what it’s like behind closed doors - two Alphas in one Coven and neither much liking the other.
Harry wakes up blearily to shouts and an alarming crash from downstairs in the early hours the next morning.
“The Prewett’s fertility is well-known.  George is the only Omega alive from our line.  He’s a  bit of a commodity.  Mum told me she was always worried she’d have an Omega child, that we’d have to be vigilant to keep George safe his whole life.  She said she was thankful when the rest of her children presented as Betas and especially thankful when Bill and Fred presented Alpha.  I think it’s why Fred worked to make his Coven so large so fast, and why he’s so strict with George.”
It impressed me, him coming to introduce himself and not just assume you’d say ‘yes’ to his proposal without so much as a ‘how do you do?’.”
But I’ve been acting as an emissary for the Order for the last year, so this tent has become a bit of a home to me.”
“Reconciliation with your Alpha is usually the best course,” Fleur says and Harry groans, not quite ready to go work things out with Hermione.
It’s grounding, as are Ron’s slow release of Beta pheromones and with Hermione’s distance, the Alpha scent slowly dissipates and Harry finds himself slowly climbing back into his own mind.
Seamus is the wildcard here.  Hermione had told him when he was learning about how the Coven had come together before Harry had presented that she struggled to agree to let Seamus join to begin with.  At the time, only she, Ron, and Seamus had presented amongst the Gryffindor 6th years.
As soon as they take notice of the Omegas, they both fall immediately silently and the four stare awkwardly at each other for a moment before Fleur takes charge of the situation.
He had rather expected to just receive a courting proposal and this - for all that it was a surprise - also impressed him.
"Of course not," she says, so calmly Harry has to fight the urge to bare his teeth at her. "We have a system."
Harry nods and Oberon buys them both hot butter beers, smoothly pulling out the requisite galleon before Harry can even think to offer.
“Nott,” Malfoy purrs, voice low and dangerous.  “I think we should perhaps return this Omega to his Alpha, wouldn’t you agree?”
He shoots a look at Harry for help, the only other one who can understand what this kind of Potion means to someone like them.
And your Hermione - she’s very strict with herself, works hard to keep her emotions under control, exceptions not withstanding.
He tosses and turns for an hour or so, George talking to him softly every once in a while, wiping his face of tears periodically, with a cool cloth.  But no matter how much he grinds and rubs himself - far past any embarrassment a sober Harry would have - he can’t get himself off.  He’s achingly hard but can’t do anything about it, and in the past few minutes he’s begun to produce a liquid between his legs as well, emanating from his hole.
“Right, right. Yea, no I wanted to get a word in with Potter,” he responds, eyes catching Harry’s gaze and holding it intently.  “If that’s quite alright with you, Weasley?”
“I don’t disagree with you, Harry,” Ron said somberly.  “It must be bloody frustrating to have to deal with all this nonsense.  I’m sorry.”
The Alpha scent tips through shock, swirling around Harry with a raging pulse, so powerful it makes Harry snap startled eyes up to match Malfoy’s vibrant gaze.
Ron reaches down to gently push Harry back from hands and knees to his knees, and then to sit cross-legged on the grass, rubbing a hand gently in circles against his back.
She does mostly freelance work. And! She plays in a Quidditch League in her free time - Keeper, if you can believe it.”
Grasping for his wand as he fights for awareness, he notes George is absent from their shared space but Fleur is rousing just like he is, hurriedly wrapping a sweater around her lean form and brandishing a wand of her own.
“Look,” she says, pacing in front of the fireplace, “I’ve talked about this with Mrs. Weasley some.  Every Coven has their own initiation for each of the ranks - whether we’re inviting in a Beta, an Alpha Sub, or an Omega.  Everyone brings their individual strengths to the Coven and thus we grow stronger as a collective.  When we brought in Luna - she was our last Beta to join, Harry - what we swore to each other was that as long as we’re a Coven, we treat each other as family.
Harry nods.  He eyes her; he’s full of questions but he’s not sure where to begin.  They sit in silence for a minute or two, both staring at the crackling fire place before Susan sighs and turns her body a little to angle herself more towards Harry.  She pulls up a leg to sit atop the sofa under the blanket, and her knee touches Harry’s thigh just slightly.  It’s comforting in a way, and it puts him more at ease for this conversation.
Distantly, he hears Ron barking at Hermione, stepping in between the two of them to confront Hermione head on, and Hermione backing away slowly.
Slowly, the redhead seems to gather himself, straightening slightly and answering Harry in a soft voice.
The sudden thought disrupts the pleasantness of his current interaction and he lets out a low, aggrieved whine.
She too pulls it up for a kiss, but her greeting is perfunctory, barely a brush of her lips to his knuckles before she's released him and said, "Nice to meet you.
“I’m not some damsel in distress, Hermione.  In case you’ve forgotten I’ve taken care of myself my whole life and saved you and Ron more than once at that.”
What do you think is better - to always suspect that there’s something more out there or to find out the truth but never understand the whole picture?”
“Oh?” Harry asks.  He definitely hadn’t mentioned the situation between Susan and Zacharias to the other Gryffindor and was curious as to what he had found out since then.
“Grass is always greener,” George says.  “On the last day of mine, I’d do anything to have it come once a month if only it wouldn’t go on so long.”
Abruptly, Oberon is pulling the group to the side, out of the path of the rest of the crowd and turns sharp eyes on Belle.
“New Fledge Alphas almost always have an adult sponsor who helps guide them in leading a Coven.  Hermione’s pretty rare, being a female Alpha and all, so it was a pretty perfect fit for mum to sponsor her…”
“How do they rate?” Harry asks Leo as the clamor dies down and the crowd starts the slow trickle out from the Quidditch grounds and back to the appartion site.
Ron grinned.  “Yea - that’s easy.  Fred’s got the biggest Coven in the school, as I said.  It’s got a good reputation and an Omega, so it’s on pretty solid ground but Fred’s never been very competitive so it’s a pretty laid back Coven and doesn’t really throw its weight around.  The rest of the 7th year Alphas have pretty small Covens.  Hermione’s got a Coven of six now, including you.  All Betas except for you and her - me, Luna, Dean, and Seamus.  Malfoy has seven - Zabini is a Beta and his Second, Parkinson is a Beta, Crabbe and Goyle, both Betas.  Padma presented Omega and joined Malofy’s Coven and Parvati presented Beta and joined to be with her sister.  Ernie Macmillan has a Coven - his Second is Zacharias Smith, an Alpha Sub, and he’s got Hannah, Susan, Lavendar, and Justin as well.  Hannah, Lavendar, and Justin are Betas, Susan is an Omega.  Terry Boot is an Alpha, Anthony Goldstein is a Beta, his Second.  It’s just the two of them right now, which is unusual.  And Nott is an Alpha but hasn’t joined or started a Coven, which is making everyone very nervous. Bulstrode is a Beta but joined Flint’s Coven. Everyone is a little bit nervous that Malfoy will try to recruit either Terry or Nott as a Sub, which would give him a lot of power, but he doesn’t seem to have made any moves yet, and no one is sure how Zabini would take it.
“Yea, it’s not real fun.  Basically during your season your body is going to start signaling to all the unattached Alpha’s that you’re single and fertile.  And because that’s not bad enough, your body is going to send you a reminder too - in the form of some very uncomfortable hard ons and an itch that feels impossible to scratch.”
Harry felt that jealousy rear its ugly head again, but he was distracted from his envy when Malfoy directed a pointed question to Hermione.  “Alpha Granger, might I propose we dance?  I know Padma has been itching to do so since we got here, and she could use a partner that can match her elegance.”
Hermione calls the Coven together at least twice a week to hang out or discuss things that affected the group, so there was no great mystery when she asked them all together the Saturday morning the week before he was to go out with Malfoy.
“Alpha,” she says, reaching out a hand to tangle with Bill’s as she settles gracefully into a seat on the couch beside him.
From what Harry had picked up from general acquaintance with the kid, he was a little …. off-step with people.  He came across a little over-eager socially.  It made people nervous.  And he wasn’t exactly Harry’s type.  He paused.  Did he have a type?  Besides an ill-conceived attraction to Cho back in fourth year, he hadn’t really given a lot of thought as to who he was into.
“Was everything okay, Harry,” Hermione asked briskly, eyeing him up and down as though Vincent might have touched him.  It felt strangely possessive.
“Dumbledore and I have been meeting for the last few months to discuss what would happen when you presented,” she said, gazing calmly over the lake, not turning her head to look at Harry.  “I know that probably is not something you wanted to hear, but Stricture wouldn’t have let us talk about this with you and its something that needed to be discussed.  The laws in the Wizarding World can be … archaic.  If you had presented an Alpha, there wouldn’t have been much of an issue.” She pauses and this time does turn her head to smile at him.
“Looking good, Potter,” he comments inanely from the armchair to Harry’s left.  Harry shoots him an unimpressed glance.
There’s a collective pause in the hum of conversation when the two Gryffindor Omegas walk in, with the other Omegas calling out welcomes, before they all continue their small group discussions.
She tugs her hand away from him, turns her head away shyly, not willing to meet his gaze any longer.  “I didn’t know he could be like that.  He’s been cold sometimes, but I thought he was just, I don’t know, shy?  I don’t think I loved him, but I liked him well enough and I’m just….Harry I’m just so tired of these seasons.  I’m exhausted.  The promise of it calming down, well, I was willing to put up with a lot.  But not…a day before your season started, Zacharias formally asked me to Bond.  Ernie was ecstatic.  So happy for both of us, but he told Zacharias that we should wait the whole length of the Formal Consideration before making it official. When I saw the premonition, my grandmother’s warnings came back to me.  I knew immediately what it was. Today I told Ernie I wouldn’t go through with it.  He was so confused, he didn’t understand.  But Ernie’s been my friend for forever.  He would never push me to do something I don’t want to do.  He said he’d tell Zacharias the answer was no.  Coming from Ernie, that should be enough.”
None of the three are quite sure what is going on, but they know enough to be weary of any unknown magic.
Harry steps closer to Terry and then guides the three of them away from the entrance to the Tower, to a place not quite so obvious to anyone walking by.
“To have knowledge of such things, but to never be able to engage in it the same way as everyone else.”
“It’s entertaining enough, but it’s not the most interesting thing in my line of sight by a long shot.”
“It’s called Alpha voice, Harry.  Betas are susceptible to it too, but not the same way Omegas are.  I’m sorry - I promise I won’t use it on you unless the need is dire.  I don’t like having this ability.  I don’t … I don’t want to be able to control another person like that.  I’m really sorry, Harry.”
She’s also chosen to be quite vulnerable and although they don’t know each other that well, he’s always liked the French girl.
All three Covens sported Omegas, which Harry was told was important in establishing ranking, but only Ernie’s sported an Alpha sub in the form of Zacharias Smith, which was supposedly an advantage in head to head wrestling for rank.  Given what Harry knew about Zacharias Smith following his Premonition, he’d take a million Ron’s over one of him, no matter what kind of advantage it might give them in the court of public opinion.
“Tell me why everyone is so nervous about Omegas being taken advantage of ‘Mione.  Please.  I can’t stand being in the dark any longer.”
Harry, I’m going to catch Hermione up - they probably slept through the whole thing out in the tents.
Harry hasn’t been exposed to it much and he hides the shiver that trickles across his skin at its use, not wanting to give away even more of how he’s feeling at this moment.
Harry recognizes one, however, as Oberon Travers, from the shadowy likeness Shaklebolt had produced at the Order meeting.
Harry tries for an inviting smile, but it comes out wavering and he casts his eyes down before he’s forced to take in Fleur’s reaction.
The Omegas cast a charm over their attire to appear more casual and swaggered down to the Halloween Ball.  Harry had attended this every year of Hogwarts so far, and knew what to expect, so he distracted himself listening to the band they had brought in and spending time with Neville bobbing for apples, while fighting back his nerves regarding what was to come later that night.
“Thank you for that, my mother will be well pleased to learn her years of dance lessons have paid dividends.”
If we have any hope of defeating them, we must form an international coalition to fight them and everything they stand for.
Of Harry’s newly acquired interest in Alphas, Malfoy did seem to attract the most attention.  But that didn’t make Harry immune from other Alphas.  While none, including Malfoy, had directly approached him, Harry noticed increased attention from Macmillian, Nott, and Boot, and Hermione told him curtly that his scent had sharpened after his first Season, and all of the Alphas knew exactly what that meant.  That was simultaneously thrilling and terrifying to Harry, who fought down any reaction at all at the news and just gave his friend a shrug.
Susan looks dazed, and she’s letting out low, pleading whimpers.  Omega sounds, Harry thinks absently, though he’s not really sure that’s a thing.  Smith pulls on her hair so she’s forced up higher on her knees and leans down just slightly to whisper menacingly in her ear, “Mine now, bitch.”
Harry didn’t know how they had worked things out with their mum though - both boys had been studiously avoiding her in the past few days and the woman had begun to look frustrated and somewhat harried, clearly on the verge of expressing some surely disastrous opinion even up to the point of putting them all back on the train.
Susan is crying as her head is forced back to reveal her neck as she faithfully replies, “You, Alpha.”
I’ve been speaking to many of the different kingdoms of magical beings but also to other Covens - some who agree with us, others who wonder if the Dark Lord might have a point. I try to convince them otherwise.”
Dumbledore smiled at him, clearly pleased that he didn’t sound angry.  “Yes, of course.  Covens are at the very heart of how the adult Wizarding World operates.  All presented Wizards join Covens which are formulated around a Coven leader — someone who has presented Alpha, such as your friend Miss Granger.  Coven leaders are almost always Alphas, though there have been rare cases of Betas taking the lead when something has happened to the Alpha founder.  An Alpha, like Miss Granger, will then seek out Betas to fill the ranks of her Coven, and will select a Second, usually her most trusted Beta, like your Mr. Weasley.  The sizes of Covens vary wildly and largely depend on the strength of the Alpha as a leader but also have something to do with whether or not they are able to attract an Omega.
“But I understand why you didn’t,” this he says, looking directly at Belle, who meets his eyes only to look down at her feet, clearly not prepared for the kindness she sees there.
Harry’s feet finally start to move again and he’s already started to mull over the whole interaction when Malfoy’s voice sounds from behind him.
“Speaking from personal experience, then?” He asks and bites off a grin when Oberon ducks his head abashedly.
Ron frowns at him and makes a pointed head gesture, indicating in no uncertain terms that Harry should follow.
," Fleur mutters distractedly and Harry sends her a grateful look even as he ponders his own idiocy in wandering through the dark when he could have just used magic.
George puts his head in to the room Olive disappeared into earlier and has a short conversation with her before he comes out and scoops up Harry’s discarded robe and tie and hustles him into one of the other suites.  Patiently he helps Harry undress further, not even blushing when the younger boy goes full nude, moaning in discomfort.
The others had looked at him like he had grown another head when he had trotted out with it on earlier, but Harry was extremely proud of the item, and excited to have occassion to show it off.
“I think you’ll find that its not quite that simple, Mr. Potter,” the official responded, looking him over condescendingly.  “Omegas don’t exactly have the … defenses … to properly care for themselves if an Alpha takes it upon themselves to undermine those efforts.”
Harry’s not entirely sure when he went from irritated and vaguely uncomfortable to outright scorching, but the tears are as much of a surprise to him.  George casts a Tempus and whistles low when he sees the time. “Man Harry that’s a quick progression.  I guess we don’t know what time you went into pre-Heat but if we assume it was right before breakfast, you’ve slipped into full season in only four hours.  Padma’s not even back yet.”  He looks a little worried, actually, not that Harry has the energy to spend on that.  He’s too busy pulling at his clothes, which are stifling him.
“It was all she could do to keep a straight face in that room when you agreed to do what the Order wanted.
“Yea, yea,” Ron said, waving if off.  “After Hermione presented, we discussed whether or not she should try to come in as a Sub under Fred…”
Hermione had had an unfortunate first meeting with Fred after initially presenting, dashing Ron’s hopes that she might be able to operate as his brother’s Second.  While she and Fred got along fine under normal circumstances, it became clear that on one hand, Fred was more traditional of a Coven Alpha than Hermione planned to be and that she would struggle to follow his lead and second, that Fred already highly relied upon Angelina as a capable Second and that Hermione would be trodding on more than one set of toes if she should try to usurp the older girl's place.   So the two Alphas decided they would make better allies than members of the same Coven, and Hermione and Ron forged their own Fledgeling Coven.
“Betas can usually have magical children if they pair with an Alpha or Omega, but when Alphas and Omegas reproduce, they always have strong and healthy magical children. Betas who partner with Omegas are the second most successful pairing, but also the rarest.  Alphas and Betas can be hit or miss.
Harry rushes over to the door and curses under his breath when he trips on George's trunk, sitting at the food of the other Omega's bed.
“I have his express permission,” Travers agrees, “but we have no qualms waiting for you to confirm.”
“No offense, mate,” Harry assures him.  “But George tells me the best thing for me will be to stay around Omegas as much as possible until it passes.”
If Travers should decide to use Alpha voice on him, he may not have much of a warning before it happened.
The time out has ended and the players are racing across the field, but the Arrows Seeker is flying much more disciplined now, clearly reacting well to whatever plan the team had rallied behind during the break.
Burbage hummed low at the outburst, frowning slightly as she thought.  “Your mother’s a Beta?” she asked the Hufflepuff, who nodded tensely.  “And so is your father?” Another nod.  She sighed.
Hermione seemed to note his discomfort.  “Don’t worry, Harry.  I’ve read that it’s fairly standard for Omegas to not have a lot of romantic interest until they go through their first season.”
Instead of worrying himself to the point of frustration, Harry instead tried to focus on his schoolwork, an area that he had sadly let slip given all of the recent events.  Hermione helped him and she spent long hours in the library with him.  She was, of course, ahead in terms of schoolwork, but she spent the extra library time researching what she could about what Susan had told him regarding his ‘gift’ of Premonition.  So far, most of what she had found was rumor and speculation - but she said her research into other branches of the ‘Sight’, which were much more easily found may provide some insight.
“You speak of ‘my omega’ as though it’s some other been living inside of me,” Harry says, crinkling his brow.
“What about you then, Harry?  Got anyone in your sights?”  It was a Saturday and they all had free time until the evening when Ron and Harry had Quidditch practice, so the trio had wandered down to hang out by the lake after running into each other in the hallway.
“Not exactly sure what that all was about,” he admits.  “Thanks, I guess.  But how do you know I haven’t spoken to Hermione.”
Wouldn’t you want to know about Covens and Alphas and Omegas and Betas, even if you couldn’t fully participate?”
In spite of Hermione’s arguments to the contrary, Harry was not a complete idiot and did have a modicum of common sense. Harry wasn’t about to discard what happened in the hallway with Malfoy & Nott easily nor was he going to ignore the warnings Hermione had given him regarding the nature of the relationship between Alphas and Omegas.
Mum rushed over to Bill, Dad too, he came down sometime when they were fighting and Dad Flooed them both to Mungo’s.
Harry shrugged.  “Seems like I just have to wait it out.  I’ve been talking to the other Omegas and they all told me they had their first cycles within six weeks of presenting.  Of course, we’ll have to wait for the second season to figure out what my cycle is.  Really hoping I don’t have to experience what Susan goes through.”
Hermione rises as well, but remains silent while Harry shifts closer to George on his other side, knocking his knee against the other Omega’s in an attempt to offer non-verbal support.
Hermione makes an apologetic sound as she disentangles herself from Harry and approaches the fire with the other Hogwarts Alphas.  From somewhere inside her robes, she pulls out a long loaf of bread, as do the other Alphas.
“Thank you for the honor, Omega Potter.  It is my fervent hope you will allow another opportunity sometime soon.”
Abruptly, the contentedness exuding from Nott cuts off and turns sour as the Slytherin spins around to face the newcomer, and Harry is shocked to find himself humming low in his throat with a sound he doesn’t think he’s ever made before.  The tense lines in Nott’s back smooth out slightly at the sound and Harry feels a sense of pleasure at having placated the Alpha, in spite of the discomfort he’s so far felt throughout their interaction.
Who's to say that this Alpha the Minister is proposing won’t make me as happy as Bill obviously makes Fleur?
It’s from Terry Boot of all people, a Ravenclaw Harry hasn’t given more than a thought to aside from the time the boy had accidentally dropped frogs legs into a potion and sprayed himself and three other Ravenclaws in collateral damage from a mutated shrinking potion that kept their torsos undersized compared to the proportions of their limbs for days before Madame Pomfrey found a permanent solution after consultation with some Healers from St Mungos.  Snape had been so furious he had docked Ravenclaw 100 points for the error.
“Isn’t it?” Fleur questions lightly. “We have our logical, rational minds and then we have our biological impulses, that we can’t control no matter how much we try.”
The Hogwarts Express runs several schedules for the return after the holidays and the Weasley party had taken the latest departure tiem.
Fred and George make it out of their respective rooms by late morning, both looking worse for wear and both avoiding the other and the eyes of most of the people in the room.
One of the most appealing things about Presenting Omega, once he had gotten over the general weirdness of the notion, was the idea that he could carry his own children.
When Harry receives a letter would with a bright red bow over Breakfast, he is initially just perplexed.  When Ron nearly chokes on his potatoes next to him after catching sight of the letter though, he quickly becomes mortified after the redhead recovers and explains that Harry has just received a courting proposal.
He moves his hand up and very gently gets a grip on Harry’s neck so the palm of his hand is warm against Harry’s Omega Spot.
“Bullocks,” Harry muttered, the ramifications only now occurring to him.  Susan is now the one sending him a sympathetic look.
After a moment, Fred, following Hermione’s lead hands the vial to a surprised-looking George, raising his eyebrow at him in question.
“The most important thing for you all to know is perhaps what could be the hardest for you to digest.  It concerns the nature of magic itself.”
Ron returns after a bit of time - longer than it would take for a round-trip to the pantry - but neither of his friends questions him.
“Let’s use our first time together to talk about your biggest concern as it relates to your new Presentations.  I assure you, this is a safe space to ask even something you might think is embarrassing.  There are some things you may need to know, and I cannot have any of you afraid to ask those questions. If you do not respect each others’ privacy,” she paused, looking Stebbins right in his eyes, “I assure you that you will not like the consequences.  Do you all understand? Speak aloud, I must hear your word.”
If I threatened to beat you in front of a bunch of our friends because you weren’t acting exactly as I wanted you to?”
The other Omega settles softly down next to him and without pausing reaches out to tangle her left hand with his right.
“You know why, Harry.  You’re the most famous wizard of our age.  Added to that, your father was a powerful pure-blooded Alpha and your mother was a new-blood Omega who successfully produced a strong magical child and would undoubtedly have produced more if not for her untimely death….”
“It’s my duty as your Alpha, Harry.  We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable.  I promise.”
“It’s his first, so I’ll stay with him this time.  We don’t have a gauge for how quick he’ll progress.  What’s your plan?”
Harry moves to skirt around the Slytherin but he finds himself stopping cold at the low sound Nott emits in response to his movement.  It’s a guttural sound and in spite of himself, Harry feels a shiver run down his back and he instinctively holds himself still, hoping not to set Nott off any further.  The last thing he needs on top of everything else right now is to get into a scuffle with a Slytherin he’s never previously had a problem with.
Hermione turned to him, holding his gaze and reaching out to hold his hand.  “Technically, yes.  But Harry, you have to know that I don’t want this, I will never use it for personal gain, and I will never restrict your access to anything that’s yours.”
“It is the purview of each Coven to decide.  Some Covens have strict pair bonding arrangements even for the purpose of reproduction, even if there are better alternatives.  But many Covens have agreements between members that allow for such surrogacy or even multiple Bondings, though such an act does tend to mitigate each Alpha’s hold on the Omega.”
“Are you going to be okay? My sense for this stuff isn’t as good as an Alpha’s but I can tell you’re still a little shaky.”
But he’s been a Second in a Coven without an Omega and he’s only been around Fleur for a few months.
He loved his time at the Burrow (for the most part, at least), but he had missed the calming effect being around so many Omegas provided.
