Draco snuck back into his room. He walked over to his bed, stealing a glance at Potter, who was peacefully sleeping with the curtains open. Draco slid into his bed, making sure to close his own curtains. He stopped himself from sighing. This whole Potter-crush business was wearing him out. He almost wished the mask of dislike he put on for Potter was real.
Harry woke up in a cold sweat. At least it seemed like he hadn't screamed. That would have been embarrassing. The curtains suddenly felt they were suffocating him, and he ripped them open. The room was dark, and all the other beds were occupied, curtains shut. Harry stumbled out of his bed and groped blindly in his trunk for his map and invisibility cloak. After finding them, he swiftly walked to the door, opening and closing it as quietly as possible. He strode through the empty common room and exited to the dungeons. He felt much better in the cold, drafty corridors. He felt more awake now.
"Forget it!" He snapped. "Forget this ever happened. I know I will. Dear Merlin, do you think Hermione would agree to Obliviate me?" He asked desperately.
Seeing that he wasn't going to answer, Harry moved closer. "And why in the forest in the middle of the night? If you talk to McGonagall, I'm sure she would let you attempt it. Supervised, of course, but she might help you. You wouldn't have to do it alone, or stay up so late you look like death itself in the mornings." Harry pried. He would never admit it, but he hated seeing Draco so clearly unhealthy. It felt wrong - like there was something fundamentally incorrect in the universe if Draco didn't look one hundred percent perfect.

"You should've at least stayed for the reactions," she said huffily. "They were priceless." Without waiting for him to respond, she barged on. "If you were going to get all fancy, you should've called me! I know you better than you know you, darling. For Merlin's sake, you don't even know that forest green suits you far better than hunter green, and you always mix up the shoes you're meant to wear. If I had been there..." Draco tuned her out. Usually, he was all for discussing what made him look sexier and what made him look more elegant, but he could not afford to waste time today. He had things to do, places to be, Harry Potters to meet.
It had taken two hours for the Aurors to find them. It wasn't that they had tried to hide, merely that the Aurors had taken that long to come after them. They had gone peacefully, even his father. They were placed in a "safe house," which was charmed and warded to keep them inside and to alert the Aurors if one of them tried to leave. Additionally, ten Aurors were stationed around the property at all times. So, it really was more of a prison, even if they were allowed some comforts and their privacy. The Malfoy name was still worth something, it seemed.
She rolled her eyes. "Why is he on your mind right now? He's not even here! Oh wait, maybe that's why; it because you're wondering why he's not at lunch yet, and you want to know where he could be..." she trailed off, brain moving too fast for her mouth to keep up.
"I turned you gay!" Draco exclaimed proudly. "Not gay. Bisexual," he corrected, but he smiled at Draco's enthusiasm. "Now shut up, you great big ponce. You owe me a kiss." He leaned in to collect his reward, and Draco gladly obliged.
Draco almost choked. He quickly schooled his face into an unreadable look, but judging by Pansy's expression, he wasn't fast enough. "Of course not Pans. And what on earth do you mean I look delicious?" He looked down. "I look the same as ever."
Well, that explained it. Harry skimmed over the next few instructions, and seeing nothing else of import, turned to Malfoy, raising an eyebrow. "May I get the ingredients now, your highness? I promise I won't get the werewolf hairs until your majesty demands it of me." He gave Malfoy a fake pleading look, even batting his eyelashes for dramatic effect.
Harry looked away. "I mean...er, yeah, I am. And I guess I always was bisexual, but I only realized it just after you-" Harry stopped suddenly. He wondered why he had been given the gift of speech if it was just going to go and ruin his life like that. "After I what?" Draco asked shrewdly.
Harry sighed again because he knew he couldn't stop there. "And he kissed me this morning. I also told him I wanted us to be together. And so now we're dating?" He said the last part as a question because he genuinely had no clue.
Paul was a man of medium height with medium-length, stringy, brown hair, and a nervous expression that gained a hint of fear when he saw that Draco was "awake."
Draco scrunched his nose up indignantly. "Of course, people want my attention! They fight for the chance to speak to me, just as peasants line up to speak to their lord," he announced snootily.
"Are you sure nothing happened? I know I can be a bit clingy and touchy-feely when I get drunk. I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable. Harry opened his mouth but shut it a second later because he remembered that Draco had actually made him quite uncomfortable in a very inconvenient way. He pushed down his memories of the event so he wouldn't get uncomfortable again with Draco right next to him.
"A Malfoy complimenting a Weasley! I'd never thought I'd see the day," he said, shaking his head in wonder.
The next day, Harry decided he would ask Draco out on a date, to make it official. He didn't want to do it publicly - that would be asking for trouble - so he had to wait until no one else was around. Unfortunately, that did not happen as often as one might think for such a large castle. Every time Harry glanced over at the blond, he seemed to be with someone or another. Slytherins, Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, even Gryffindors were always hanging around him, chattering about one thing or another. He supposed he could ask to talk to Draco alone, but he was already so nervous. It would be like seeking out a potential disaster.
Harry was awoken by nightmares for the second night in a row. It was getting to be an issue. How was he supposed to do anything when he wasn't getting any rest? He got up, snagging his cloak and map before slipping out of the room. As he walked down the hall, he heard voices coming from the common room. He quickly donned the cloak, intent on passing the occupants without disturbing them.
Now it was his turn. His mother walked towards him. She would sit on the bench while his trial went on. He got up to go sit in the ominous-looking chair. As he passed his mother, she gave his arm a squeeze and said, "It will be alright, my love." He swallowed and nodded. He made his way over to the chair and sat down. The chains, after a moment's deliberation, stayed where they were. The Chief Warlock did not look happy at this.
Potter continued. "She was willing to live with and be punished by a monster, just so her son would be safe. She was never a true follower of Voldemort. She was never asked to perform any tasks on his behalf and was never given any mission other than to act as a gracious hostess, which she performed only as much as required." Potter took a deep breath and continued, "and Mrs. Malfoy saved my life."
Both of them held their breaths for a minute longer before Draco tugged Harry's hand off of his mouth. "Well, that was certainly close. I see now why you chose to forcibly drag me into this closet." Draco drawled. Harry flushed.
"You...cannot just...burst out of...your room...looking like...that...and then just...leave!" She hissed between panting in breaths of air. Pansy leaned against the table for a moment, steadying her breathing before she glared and continued as if there were no interruptions.
Potter stood at the door with a sheepish look on his face, but his visage quickly morphed to one of determination. He strode forward, intent clear on his face. Whispers broke out amongst the court, but they quieted down with a look from the Chief Warlock.
"Does it feel good to finally have the truth about your godfather made public? It must have been hard having everyone tell you he was a criminal."
"I think I should know," Harry insisted. "So that I don't do it again by accident." Draco shook his head slightly, a hint of a scowl twisting his features. "No need. It's something I need to work on, not you."
"Really, Draco? Transformation Magick for the Transfiguration Master? You hardly qualify as a Transfiguration Master."
Harry had the opposite philosophy, of course. He was just starting the eighteen-inch essay due the next day. They worked on their own, but occasionally Harry would throw out a question, and Draco would answer him succinctly. It was quite relaxing.
"Kitchen!" Harry yelled back.
Seamus cleared his throat. "So I take it the rumors aren't true?" At Harry's suddenly incredulous look, he quickly leaned back, saying, "Of course, mate. Shouldn't have even asked." Then he got up and practically fled to sit next to Dean.
Malfoys do not feel. And once it might have been true. Not for Draco, though, not since 4th year, when he realized just how nervous he was for the boy with the messy black hair and green eyes. Especially when that boy had to face a dragon, and when he had nearly drowned in the Black Lake, and when he had come out of that maze screaming about Diggory and the return of the Dark Lord. And now the voice that stirred up those dreaded feelings was saying his name.
Malfoy sighed annoyingly. "Potter, it's fine. Really, I forgive you. Please, let's just move on. Next time, you can read the instructions and warnings a million times under my careful supervision until you can recite them backward. Please, Potter, just forget it."
Hermione let out a very girly noise. "Oh, that's perfect! About time! Have you asked him on a date yet?" She gushed.
"The Boy Who Won't Die has a hero complex, of course, and you are bloody addicted to it!"
"Draco, darling," Pansy's much too loud and cheerful voice sang out. He raised his head so he could properly glare at her. She shoved a foaming blue potion in his face. Recognizing it immediately, he snatched it and guzzled the contents, sighing in relief as the Hangover potion took effect right away. He blinked hard as everything went back to normal.
"You should smile more often," Potter informed him with a grin. Draco was stunned into silence. Potter looked away, seemingly only just realizing what he had said.
"Bloody fucking cloak," he muttered. Louder, in case Harry had gone ahead, he said, "You're a fucking insufferable tease, Harry. I hope you know that. I'm going to make you pay for it someday." He warned.
They made their way to their next class, Transfiguration. They arrived on time, but only just barely, and McGonagall gave them a reproachful glance. Luckily, she was also pleased by the apparent 'friendship' between Draco and Harry and did not verbally reprimand them.
As Harry sat there, lost in his own thoughts, Flitwick droned on and on. At least he was free after this lesson. He promised himself he would ask Ron if he wanted to go flying, and maybe Ginny could join them too. But he had to talk to Malfoy first. As soon as the lesson ended, he packed his things quickly and rushed over to Malfoy's desk. He cleared his throat to get his attention.
Harry hesitated again. "But how...how did you...?" Ginny smiled at him softly. "How did I know I was gay?" She asked him. Harry nodded. She sighed. "It wasn't really any one thing, in particular, Harry. I've always loved looking at beautiful women. And after dating a few guys - you, Dean, Michael - I realized that boys didn't really hold the same appeal for me as girls did. And then I saw Luna after a few months and saw how beautiful she had gotten...and well the rest is history." Harry was suddenly overwhelmed by the urge to hug his beautiful, brave ex-girlfriend. She had struggled with this alone for who knows how long. He was unmeasurably grateful to have her by his side now.
The next morning, Draco awoke in a fairly decent mood, made only better by the fact that it was Friday. While he got dressed, Nott and Goldstein also woke up and left at varying times. When he walked out of the bathroom, he saw Harry still fast asleep. He rolled his eyes and approached the bed.
"Mr. Potter, how are you feeling about the release of your book?"
"Why do you blush when I whisper your name?" He asked triumphantly. "Not that one," Harry refused immediately. "Anything but that."
Because when the savior of the wizarding world called your name, you stopped. Death Eater or not.
"Ron! I could have broken these!" Harry said crossly. "What about Draco?" he continued, not daring to hope.
Potter snorted, and it sounded remarkably like the reindeer from only moments ago. "You mean almost fly. It was kind of majestic until you fell on your face. And besides, how do you know about muggle carols?" Potter asked curiously. Draco shrugged. "Malfoys are naturally majestic, Potter. And it's kind of hard not to with all the muggleborns walking around singing them all the time during the winter hols." Potter smiled. "You don't call them mudbloods anymore," he observed.
The Horgwallow was a disgusting creature, somehow scaly and covered in bristles at the same time. It had a long snout, with nostrils that were dripping with some unidentified goo. Draco was not eager to find out what it was. It had a long, curved tail with small nubs on it. Draco shuddered. Then, the creature opened its ridiculously tiny mouth and wailed loudly.
She rolled her eyes. "What do you want me to ask? You don't need me to analyze his words to see if he likes you back or not. Clearly, he's a good kisser if you kissed him more than once. I can't help you with asking him to be your boyfriend since you've already got that covered. You haven't even slept with him yet, so we can't discuss whether he's good in bed or not. You don't need me," she said matter-of-factly.
All too soon, the doorbell rang, and he heard Draco greeting his friends. Harry finished just as they were sitting down, and he had the pleasure of serving piping hot food.
They were still standing in the middle of the hallway. Harry touched Draco's arm. "Draco? Are you alright?" Draco stared at him blankly. "Why doesn't the rest of the world know any of this?" He asked bluntly.
"Thanks, Pans," he said and walked out of the room. Draco would listen to Pansy. She had good instincts when it came to matters like this.
Pansy and Blaise rushed over to him. "A dragon, Draco!" Pansy gushed. "That's amazing! It's incredibly rare to have magical creatures as your animagus, though I suppose we should have known, what with your name and all." Draco noticed out of the corner of his eye Potter edging away to go talk to his friends. Draco distractedly praised his friends' animagi forms, too, before turning to see Potter excitedly describing to Granger what it felt like to turn into an animal. Granger had a jealous look on her face.
————————————————————————
"You absolute wanker," he breathed. "You've had this the whole time? How positively unfair! Where did you even come across this?"
Next, add in 10 Werewolf hairs. It is vital you do not remain exposed to them for more than 5 seconds; otherwise you may be subject to aggressive feelings directed at the nearest individual. Effects may not surface for several hours. It is recommended you wait until the last possible minute to get this ingredient, as it will reduce the chances of accidental exposure. Let sit and boil for five minutes.
After Pansy's long-winded rant, Draco finally managed to ask her what she thought of his chosen ensemble. Her response: "If Potter weren't going out with you, he would jump off of the Astronomy Tower out of sheer pining."
"Harry," he insisted, firmer this time. Harry pulled back, a confused expression on his otherwise sinfully sexy face. He looked thoroughly debauched, and Draco delighted in wondering what he would look like post-sex.
Harry grinned. "The Weasley twins gave it to me in third year. They nicked it from Filch's office." Draco shook his head in annoyEd impatience. "That squib couldn't levitate a feather, let alone make this. Where did he get it from?"
"Don't get used to it," Draco warned, but Harry's smile undermined the statement. Just then, Hermione strode in, walking straight over to Draco and giving him a massive hug. Draco shot Harry a panicked look, but Harry, the useless boyfriend that he was, simply mouthed, "You're on your own with this one."
Draco turned to face Harry, who pushed himself up to loom over him, making the real Draco blush a bit. Fuck if they didn't look entranced by each other. Draco raised a slightly shaking hand - bloody hell he really was a love-struck idiot - to touch Harry's cheek, whispering, "Harry."
"HARRY!"
Draco gently removed his glasses from his face. Clearly, his expression must have given away at least some of his panic, because Draco added, "they were hurting my cheekbones. I would like to enjoy kissing you, not be in constant fear that you'll gouge my eyes out." Draco grinned at him. Harry rolled his eyes, trying to disguise his relief and probably failing. He smiled too.
After a while, they mustered the energy to drag Hermione away from her essay and up to dinner. They ate slowly and dragged their feet all the way back down to their dorms. Harry collapsed onto his bed and fell asleep without even changing.
Kissing was fine, he decided. Better than fine, actually. He desperately wanted to kiss Draco again, as many times as he could get away with. And this, the cuddling, was wonderful as well. And he thought that just maybe, he might be ready to go a little bit further. He still wasn't ready to go all the way and do the biggest thing, but he could handle some fooling around. Probably. He would handle it because he was an adult now, and adults didn't run away from physical intimacy like cowards.
Malfoy looked away. "Really, Potter, you're overreacting. I know you didn't mean to hurt me. I forgive you."
Draco was out of breath and panting by the time he finished his tirade. "And really," he added, a bit calmer now, "is it so hard to believe I actually do want to take this slow and prove my feelings for you?"
Draco was about to find out.
As Harry was walking out the door, he heard Nott say, "Draco, if you don't get up now, we'll be late for breakfast!"
She had to. What was life without Draco? They had been together for so little time, and already Harry was dependent upon that flawlessly perfect git. Hermione and Ron had each other, but Draco was all his. His to laugh with, his to protect.
He tentatively raised the corners of his mouth, smiling at nothing in particular except the memory of a snorting reindeer standing over him.
"Yeah," Harry responded, pulling his leg out of the space and back onto solid ground. "My hero," he said affectionately to Draco, swooping in to give him a thank-you kiss.
Harry wholeheartedly disagreed.
Draco bristled, but a commotion outside prevented an angry response.
It didn't have to be an innuendo. Maybe Draco meant that he liked eating food more than he liked vomiting it out. That would be a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the statement. Unfortunately, Harry was a teenager, not all that innocent, and very prone to thinking about these kinds of things around Draco. Heat practically radiated off his face when his mind decided to conjure up images. Images where Draco just happened to be on his knees in front of Harry, putting things into his mouth. Curse his imagination.
Harry had only seen it once from the eyes of a reindeer, but Draco's dragon form was a sight to behold. Though he had teased him at the time, Draco's animagus was an elegantly fierce creature, full of majesty and deadly weapons. But, the creature was small, only the size of a baby dragon, even though Draco was technically an adult. If he had transformed, the mirror easily could have slipped off his neck to the ground. The rules of keeping clothing versus accessories in animagus transformation was a complex and under-researched topic, but Draco might have accidentally left the necklace behind.
In the meanwhile, Potter had gone to get the remaining ingredients. They silently fell into their previous routine of Draco asking for ingredients and Potter handing them over. Obviously, Draco was the one to actually make the potion. He turned to Potter.
Draco still looked sleepy, his eyelids drooping, and his posture just the wrong side of perfect. Even his hair was far from the immaculate style he now preferred - it was dangerously close to Harry's level of messiness. Harry loved this Draco because it was his Draco. It was Draco stripped bare from all the pureblooded standards and ceaseless manners. It was Draco when he didn't have to pretend or try to be some perfect version of himself. It was the Draco he rarely got to see, the one that existed only in the fleeting moments between sleep and coffee, between daydreams and attentiveness, before going to bed and after a long snogging session. No one but Harry truly understood how precious and valuable these seconds were.
Harry pulled at his hair in frustration. "How can you just forgive me like that? It's my fault I didn't pay close enough attention to you and Snape. You should hate me for this."
"Well, I remembered you said that Hermione recommended sleeping next to an animal to help with your nightmares, so I thought maybe he could help you. Hyperion is the god of sleep, isn't he?" Draco responded.
Harry hesitated. "Only a little..."
Just because they were together, they certainly did not give up their favorite pastime: bickering with each other.
He weaved through the trees. A branch snapped somewhere close by, but Draco didn't even twitch. He had heard much more ominous things in these woods.
"-our rhyme? We thought it was quite-"
Harry gave Malfoy a once-over. "You sure you're not hurt?" He asked him and immediately regretted it because Malfoy stiffened and looked away.
Draco tried not to think about it, he really did. Pushing all thoughts of Potter's abs far back in his head, he gave Pansy a stern look. "Yes, it really would be so bad. Imagine if he found out, I'd be the laughingstock of the entire school!"
He could do it in the bathroom.
"Thanks, Harry. But actually, I just remembered something you said at the trial. You said Dumbledore and Snape had planned it all ahead. Is that true?" Draco asked curiously.
He almost hadn't chosen to come back. He didn't deserve to be reunited with the castle that he once called his home when the Manor didn't fulfill that role for him. He didn't want to ruin everyone's last year by reminding them of the horrors they had gone through. He shouldn't have come.
Then, in a corridor perpendicular to his, behind him, he saw, with mounting horror, Peeves rushing along at top speed. With his cloak, the poltergeist would undoubtedly pass him without notice, but if he saw Draco, he would torment him mercilessly. Harry didn't want that. If nothing else, it would make it hard to slip back into the common room without making a scene.
"Parkinson?" Harry asked. Wow, Harry really didn't want to look after Draco. He was slightly offended. Blaise became annoyed on his behalf. "She's tending the bar and can't leave." He proceeded to list the whereabouts of literally everyone else.
"Alright," he whispered. "I'll tell you."
"Draco, you've been staring at Potter since our very first meal in the Great Hall. And he stares right back. You've been eye-fucking each other almost since you met. And don't get me started on 6th year."
I am thankful for your concern and thought - I was aware of Draco's disappearance, but nonetheless, I appreciate you telling me.
"After Voldemort cast the killing curse and I died and came back to life, Mrs. Malfoy was sent to check if I was truly dead. When she reached me, she found that I was, in fact, alive. Instead of notifying Voldemort, as any truly loyal Death Eater would, she instead asked me whether her son was alive. When I responded that he was, she declared me dead, thus enabling me to surprise Voldemort and finally finish him off."
——————————————————
Potter was watching him. He could tell, even without looking at him, he could always tell when he was watching him. It drove him mad all of 6th year, feeling Potter's gaze on him and never seeing him. "You think you deserve a life sentence? Do you really believe that?" Potter's angry voice made him snap his head up to look at him. "Of course." He answered, confused. It was true enough. He had fought on the wrong side, tortured and harassed students the whole year, and had been the reason for Dumbledore's death the year before that, not to mention what happened to Bell and the Weasel. He deserved whatever punishment the public demanded.
Draco sat on the edge of the bed. "Harry? Are you alright?" He asked, slightly concerned now. Harry still didn't answer. Draco shook him. "Harry?"
Halfway through his meal, the famous trio finally showed up, Weasley immediately heading for the food while Granger trailed behind with a look of infinite patience. Harry, on the other hand, sat down and immediately turned his eyes towards Draco. He seemed surprised when they locked gazes, but promptly offered a warm smile, which Draco gladly returned.
Draco looked inside the envelope and saw that there was indeed another piece of parchment. He resisted the temptation to sneak a peek at it, out of respect for his mother.
When he got back, Harry was saying, "We'll be together forever, you'll see. Me, you, and Draco, always."
The fifth and final thing he noticed was Draco Malfoy. He was sleeping very peacefully, his face for once devoid of all emotion. Harry took the time to appreciate the ethereal features of the pale, blonde boy. He was painfully beautiful, all angles and aristocratic bone structure. His eyelashes were incredibly long, and his hair fell over one side of his face, covering his ear. Harry spent far too long just ogling Draco. He was, in a word, perfect.
Quite unfortunately for him, he shared a dorm with Harry Potter. The reason why Draco had a raging erection in the first place. He couldn't very bloody well wank while the object of his fantasies was listening. Or he could, but that wouldn't be taking it slow. And he really was serious about everything he had told Harry in the forest. Draco wouldn't have said it otherwise.
When they had eaten their fill, the plates disappeared, and McGonagall dismissed them. They all stood, ready to get to their common rooms and beds for a good night's sleep. Ron and Hermione were no longer prefects - 8th years were not allowed to be prefects, head boy or girl, or part of the quidditch teams. Harry understood. Technically, they weren't supposed to be there at all, so it made sense that they should not be allowed to hold positions that they wouldn't have held if they had been able to graduate. In any case, Hermione and Ron no longer had to lead the first years to the common room, which was good since that was no longer their common room.
"Someone called you a nasty Death Eater?" He asked angrily. Malfoy nodded seriously. "It's okay. I am a nasty Death Eater. I should've gone to jail. Why didn't you let me go to Azkaban, Harry?" Malfoy sounded strangely childlike and very sad, and Harry started at the use of his first name. He quite liked it coming from Malfoy's mouth, and wondered why he had never said it before. Then he remembered that oh yes, that was because they were bitter rivals.
"I'm sorry, Your Highness, but I'm afraid my orders are to take you back to the palace."
There was an idea. If he didn't take too long, it wouldn't be suspicious at all. Then again, he could use a good, long wank. Purely for de-stressing purposes, of course.
Memories....hmmm, there was an idea. Harry contemplated the possibility for a while and grew more and more pleased with it by the minute. Working on it would also serve as a distraction, so Harry got started immediately.
He personally thought that the article wasn't all that bad. It didn't really condemn their relationship, only expressed concern about whether it was genuine or a plot on his part. It even mentioned that he had been pardoned, and, really, the journalist brought up valid questions about whether there was a conflict of interest in their trial. It was only just. The reporter definitely could have brought up nastier incidents, but overall, it was quite fair to him.
The petite yet incredibly scary woman hurried out of her office, immediately spotting Potter lying on the bed. "What happened?" She asked as if unconscious patients were brought in every day, which they probably were. Draco described how he had bumped into Potter, making sure to tell the woman he had apologized and backed off. She looked skeptical but allowed him to continue. As he finished telling her about Potter's sudden attack, she ran diagnostic spells on the boy.
"All in favor of declaring the defendant innocent, please raise your hands."
He spun around to face Headmistress McGonagall, who had stood up the moment the owls descended upon them. She met his eyes and nodded, reassuring him. She would find Draco.
Draco stood still, at a loss for what to do next. He couldn't call the muggle police - they wouldn't find any evidence if it were a wizard, not to mention the fact that he wouldn't be able to explain everything about his missing object. Nor could he call the Aurors, because that was just asking for trouble. It was no use trying to find the thief himself either - Draco had limited access to magic and knew very little about tracking spells anyway. He scowled. He loved that potion kit. It was one of the few things he still enjoyed doing. There was nothing for it, he would have to get a new one.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You are, or were, pretty shallow, Draco. Though you're right, you're too beautiful to be desperate. I bet the girls all line up for a chance with you. And I thought we established I am a massive idiot?"
And then, he was at the Manor with absolutely no deliberation - an image of a splinched girl in a golden hoop flashed through his mind. Harry was quite cross. It wasn't much fun suddenly finding yourself doing things without deciding to in the first place. Even if he was kind of glad his body was on autopilot. Conscious thought meant talking himself out of going and not seeing Draco.
Wilson shook his head in disappointment. "I'm sorry," he mouthed back. "We searched the whole house. He's nowhere to be found."
Potter and the Weasel walked further into the room. The ginger immediately made a beeline for the food, Granger heading over to intercept him. Potter just stood kind of close to Draco, making his heart start to beat faster. Draco looked at everything but Potter.
It didn't even matter that Potter hadn't talked to him. He understood that Potter probably wouldn't want to talk to a Death Eater. It was surely bad for his reputation, though Draco didn't think that mattered at this point. It was how he had left without sparing Draco, even one glance that made him feel like he had been hit in the stomach with a bludger.
"Of course we would." A voice came from the doorway, and Hermione walked in. "And Harry, you really ought to go. Ron is right; you would never forgive yourself if you didn't."
Harry ignored the last bit. Draco wondered if he had selective hearing. The black-haired boy averted his eyes shyly, saying, "I thought you might just be physically attracted to me."
Well, at least I won't be late for potions. Harry was not looking forward to spending the rest of his year underneath the Black Lake. And in such close proximity to the Slytherins and Snape. Things were not looking good for his final year.
"Sod off, Malfoy," he growled. Draco looked taken aback. "Fine, Potter, I was only trying to help. I apologize if I offended your delicate sensibilities." Draco sounded slightly hurt, but Harry couldn't bring himself to care. He finished stuffing the last of his things into his repaired bag, then stalked off to class.
And some good old fashioned
Blaise expertly avoided his question. "So, you admit that you stare at each other."
Harry could tell she had more to say, but Draco swept into the seat beside him at that exact moment, and they exchanged a glance and decided to save the topic for later.
Harry stood there for a second, then followed him. He quickly glanced at his map, and seeing that the corridors were, in fact, empty, he relaxed a bit and hurried to catch up. Draco glanced at him as he drew level with the taller boy.
"-and then they told me to go away because I'm a nasty Death Eater. But that's okay because then I saw you! And I ran over, and here I am." Malfoy laughed delightedly.
"Draco?" Harry said, shocked. "You were the one tearing my bag?" He quickly grew angry. He thought they had moved on from their childish feud. They had made a truce for Marlin's sake!
"Would you...never mind." Harry sounded subdued. Draco looked up to see him chewing on his lip and looking frustrated.
"Why not?" Harry asked, confused. He was indignant that Kingsley thought he would be there to gloat, but he let it go in favor of the more urgent matter. "No one is allowed to enter once the trial has begun unless it is an emergency. I'm afraid that you will not be able to enter." He hesitated, then said, "Harry, if that is all you are here for, then I must ask you to leave. But, you are always welcome to visit me, and should you ever wish to join us, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement will always have a spot for you."
Sure enough, the group moved towards them, chatting and laughing loudly. But they stopped when they realized who was at the table next to the one they were aiming for.
"Harry?" Draco called from somewhere in the house.
Draco swirled the memory around, glanced at Harry, who looked both excited and a bit embarrassed, and lowered his head.
Harry shot him an annoyed look. "Do you really think you deserve to pay for your mistakes?" He finally asked. Malfoy looked away, biting his lip, but didn't answer.
"I really am sorry, Draco. It's just- it's Halloween. My parents...they died on Halloween. Voldemort tried to kill me, the first time, on this very day eleven years ago. Before, it wasn't so hard, but after I saw them again...this day just makes me depressed. But still, I shouldn't have been rude to you." Harry said, hesitating but offering Draco a pained smile. Draco pulled Harry into a hug. The other boy was stiff for a few seconds, but eventually relaxed and put his arms around Draco too.
From far off, there was the sound of ten loud bongs. Draco waited through all of them, foot finally stilling. Then he waited five more minutes because Harry was always late. Just as he was about to leave, heart sinking in despair, a familiar mop of unruly black hair barrelled around the corner. Draco stopped, watching as the hurtling body tried to run, put on a coat, and keep hold of a small, cream-colored box all at once. To the amazement of everyone who stopped to stare at the Idiot Who Lived, he managed to get his coat on the moment he stopped in front of Draco, still carrying the box.
Draco turned fully towards his mother and leaned down, hugging her tightly. He had done this goodbye every year since he was eleven, but now it felt different. It had been just him and his mother since their trial, and they had grown impossibly close. He felt like he would be leaving a part of himself behind when he boarded the train.
"Oh dear," she said, her voice high and clear. "Sorry, but I forgot to turn on the lights!" She fiddled with something on the wall, and light flooded the room, illuminating its sparse contents. The girl was fair with a delicate bone structure and high cheekbones. Her nose was small, and her eyes dark, her mouth curving into a charming smile. Her beauty rivaled that of even his mother, who was the most gorgeous woman he had ever met.
"You don't have to apologize, Harry. I'm sorry, I should have known about today. I'll tell our professors you're sick, but I'm still bringing you breakfast and lunch. You need to eat, Harry. They would have wanted you to be healthy. And happy. But sometimes, happy just isn't feasible, and that's alright too. But please, you have to eat." Draco was nearly begging, and he kind of wanted to hit himself over the head for being so pathetic.
Draco cleared his throat. "The Biellos are the Italian cousins of the Notts, correct?" Cousins was an oversimplification of it, but he didn't wait for an answer, because his father had drilled the pureblood lineages into his head from birth. "Known for their astonishing beauty, impressive ancestry, and..." Draco cut himself off. Insanity, Lucius had said. The Biellos are all utterly mad. Shame, all those centuries of exquisite breeding for naught.
"What is it?" Draco asked impatiently, trying to see over Harry's shoulder.
"I really don't understand how Granger puts up with you," he told Potter in a matter-of-fact voice. Potter grinned. "I suspect it has something to do with my dashing good looks and charming smile." He flashed Draco an admittedly adorable lopsided smile. And Draco couldn't disagree about Potter's looks either. But he just sniffed disdainfully and gestured for Potter to hand over the werewolf hairs. He opened the bottle and carefully took out the last ten of the coarse hairs with tweezers, emptying the vial. He made sure not to breathe in. Any kind of exposure was dangerous. He added them in and followed the rest of the directions precisely. Mercifully, they were finished about ten minutes before class ended. Draco scooped some of the bubbly red mixture into an empty vial to hand in to Snape.
He tried the window, which opened, but it was hexed to prevent humans from leaving. There was nothing of note outside, only a hill and a couple of trees in sight. At least it was brighter with the weak light of the winter sun. Draco sat on the bed, bored but alert with anticipation. Either his kidnapper did not know he had arrived, which was unlikely considering they would've felt him enter the wards, or they were making him wait. It was a common Slytherin tactic, almost expected, and it was used to drive victims to crippling boredom or even madness so that it was easier to break them.
Malfoy didn't reply. He stirred the cauldron, and Harry could hear him counting under his breath. When he reached seven, he stopped and looked at Harry.
He clambered into the bed next to Potter (because it was closest and for no other reason than that.) He lay down gingerly, wincing at the bruises and soreness that lingered. His exhaustion from the fight overwhelmed him, and he decided it might be alright to take a quick nap.
"Harry!" Greeted one of them dramatically, sweeping his arm out and bowing.
Hermione nodded. "Okay, so it's something else. If it's not routine Draco-obsession, that means something else happened," she declared. Harry groaned.
Harry gave the tall blond an answering smile. He felt like a weight had been taken off his shoulders. Even though a promise, or at least a non-magical one, could easily be broken, Harry trusted Draco to be honorable, if nothing else.
And Draco moved further back into the dark forest until he felt that he was past the wards, and then with a loud crack, the Forbidden Forest was once more empty, save for the creatures that called it home.
Harry was having a really bad morning. His nightmares had kept him awake through the night. When he finally got to sleep, he was shaken awake only hours later by Ron, whom he had subsequently yelled at. Ron was bewildered by his awful attitude and had left him alone to go to breakfast. Harry had felt bad about it immediately after, but it wasn't enough to snap him out of his mood.
"They're always getting into fights," Ron chimed in. "Quite the bloody troublemakers, they are."
Hagrid dismissed the class, and Draco turned to find Potter so he could needle him about the blushing, only to find the boy back with his friends and heading up to the castle. Draco gazed after him, but just shook himself after a minute and hurried to catch up with Pansy and Blaise.
Draco's second attempt wasn't close at all. He couldn't manage to visualize every change at once, so he ended up with scales and claws but no more. Draco was so frustrated that he nearly died with his third attempt, remembering that a dragon's heart has six chambers just in time to reverse the transformation. After that, he decided to take a short break, wasting precious minutes to calm down and refocus. It was fortunate that he did so, though, because it allowed his fourth try to be conducted with a clear mind. And, as such, Draco finally took on his Animagus form.
Draco took a deep, shaky breath. "Okay," he replied eventually. Maybe Harry was right.
Draco muttered the new password (simul fortes) and slipped into the common room. Thankfully, he made it to his dorm and into bed without incident.
He and Gin had had a talk the previous summer. Harry simply didn't feel like he could be with Ginny any longer. He knew that something inside him was fundamentally not the same. Harry was not the guy he was before walking into that forest, and Ginny didn't deserve to be strung along when Harry knew he wouldn't be able to be a good boyfriend to her. Ginny deserved better than him, a boy who carried far too much baggage from the war. And Ginny, being the wonderful friend she was, understood. She had let him go, and after a while, she thanked him for it. If she hadn't broken up with him, she had told him one night, then she never would have discovered her feelings for a beautiful, blonde Ravenclaw. And now, Luna and Gin were dating and perfectly happy. And Harry was glad.
Parkinson gaped at them. Harry spotted another bunch of his Gryffindor friends headed their way and hid a smile.
Draco couldn't resist joining in. "He sure does, Pans. I think he must've tripped like usual - his face is all red, especially his lips. Oh look, they're even swollen." The both of them were laughing outright now, Blaise ignoring them and scowling.
After Pansy had ranted for a while about going off on his own, he finally cut her off. "Harry and I had a fight. I stunned him and took him to the Hospital Wing. We fell asleep for a while and talked, and now we're friends." He made to walk past her to his dorm, but she blocked him.
"Nothing," said Blaise with a smirk.
Draco did as he was told, as anyone with sense does when faced with an annoyed Pansy.
As he left class, he spotted a familiar platinum blond head bobbing along the corridor ahead of him. His heart sped up, and he hurried forward, intending just to do it. He had nearly reached Draco when suddenly, a slight figure cut in front of him and began to talk to the boy.
Harry was pissed. Didn't he deserve to spend one year, just one, in peace? He was annoyed with McGonagall. Couldn't he have at least been with at least one Gryffindor? He understood and admired her push for unity, but he felt much less gracious when it meant he had to sleep in the same room as Draco Malfoy.
"I can get that," Harry volunteered, thinking fondly of the hairbrush Draco used for at least twenty minutes every morning.
"All the answers are in chapter 3, of course. Some are in the first section, and all the rest are in the third. Don't bother with the second section, it'll just confuse you." Draco informed him, taking out some parchment and a quill. Harry groaned. "I've been looking in the second section the whole time. Figures. Thanks, you're a lifesaver."
——————————————————
"Here's what that tells us," Wilson continued. "His destination is almost certainly not under the Fidelius Charm since Mr. Malfoy did not read a Secret Keeper's note beforehand. The area may or may not be Unplottable; we can't tell at the moment. We will attempt tracking spells, of course, but that requires a bit of his magical signature. If you could provide a strand of hair, a bit of blood or saliva, or something he has imbued with his magic...?" Wilson trailed off questioningly.
Suzanna pointed her wand at him suddenly, and he nearly jumped out of the way by pure instinct. His heart was pounding so hard that he didn't hear her incant, but she must have because he felt the familiar, uncomfortable sensation that accompanied transformation. And, suddenly, he was finally back to normal.
Harry woke up in a cold sweat, whispers of his dream still trailing through his mind. He shuddered at the mere memory of the nightmare. They were less frequent, yes, but he had lied to Draco about the other part. The nightmares were so much worse now, and they did haunt him.
Blaise smirked. "More like who's the target. I've already got everything figured out." Draco smirked. "You know, just because Harry and I are cool now, doesn't mean we can't play a friendly joke every now and then."
Ron had a sudden coughing fit that sounded remarkably like the words "Sixth Year." Harry gave him an evil look.
"I'll tell you anyway. I was talking to lovely Luna yesterday, and she just happened to tell me that she was dating Ginevra Weasley. Imagine my surprise. I was sure you two were still dating!" Harry tried to reply, but Parkinson droned on.
Draco nodded. He had slept, even if it had taken him a few hours to slip into blessed unconsciousness. He walked into the doors of the Great Hall and headed towards the Slytherin table, Pansy trailing behind him. Draco plopped down on the bench next to Blaise, and Pansy sat down across from him.
But Malfoy did, and he whipped it out and screamed, "Impedimenta!" Harry was thrown back onto the floor, and Malfoy quickly shot a stunning spell at him. The last thought he had was of overwhelming, all-encompassing regret.
Draco turned around in his seat and immediately saw Potter with his arm around the Weaslette. He tore his gaze away and knocked back his second drink. After a couple more rounds, with Pansy getting more and more concerned after each one, Draco was finally, blessedly drunk. He stumbled away from the bar, heading over to someone he thought looked like Blaise.
Draco reluctantly turned to face forwards, adding this to the mental list he had made consisting of things to confront Potter about. He listened, bored, as Snape repeated some of the information from last week's class. When it was time to get to work, Draco retrieved their potion from where they had stored it for safekeeping.
"Yes, Pans. Harry touched the Werewolf hairs and was near me when they took effect, so he attacked me. I stunned him and brought him to the Hospital Wing. Pomfrey healed both of us but said to wait for Harry to wake up and told me to rest. When I woke up, lunch was over, so we ate there, and Pomfrey let us go just a few minutes ago." Draco relayed the story to her and made to go past her again. She stepped back in front of him.
That plan was shot down the moment the newspapers printed their front-page article. There was no way Narcissa missed it, and if she somehow, miraculously, hadn't seen it, there was almost no way she had escaped the barrage of owls that had started this current mess.
Harry kissed him, surreptitiously licking off the bit of jam and simultaneously shutting him up. He pulled away quickly, a self-satisfied grin on his face.
Harry hesitated. "Kingsley," he began again. "I need to see Narcissa and Draco Malfoy. I wish to be a witness for their defense at their trials." Kingsley looked shocked. "I must admit, that was not the answer I expected from you. But, I also admit I should have known. You are far more grown up than any of us have given you credit for. I apologize. I know you better than to think this would be about some petty rivalry. However, I cannot allow you to enter the courtroom."
Draco began to panic. He was going to fall; he was sure of it. He flapped his wings in alarm, naturally trying to stop his downward motion. His muscles strained to keep him upright, and suddenly he was flying. His elation was short-lived, however, realizing that he had about five seconds to learn how to turn before he crashed into the wall. Draco dipped one wing and raised the other, as he imagined a bird would do, and his tail naturally moved to prevent him from wobbling as much.
"Someone called you a nasty Death Eater?" Harry asked angrily. Draco was touched by his concern, even so early in their friendship thing. Had they even been friends at that point? Past-Draco was talking again. "It's okay. I am a nasty Death Eater. I should've gone to jail. Why didn't you let me go to Azkaban, Harry?"  Merlin. Draco was so done with alcohol. They bickered a bit about whether Draco had deserved to go to jail, with the end result of Harry winning, Draco smiling sappily at him, and Harry looking a little bit besotted.
He tried to scream and cry and curse Voldemort for all he was worth, but the only thing that came out was a high, cold laugh.
Draco ultimately decided to put the rest of the memories aside and enjoy them later, since they took quite a bit of time to get through. Anyway, he was excited for Harry to open his present.
She sniffed. "I see. Owls are more important than friends now, I suppose. Who cares that Pansy had to walk down by herself to lunch when you could spend some quality time with stinky birds?" Draco tried very hard not to smile. It would not endear himself to the angry girl. "Oh Pans, you know it's not like that. I thought you were with Blaise; otherwise, I would have kept you company. Gentlemanly manners and all that." He bit into a small chunk of fish.
Ron shook his head. "You weren't waking up, mate. If you want to get to breakfast, you'd better hurry up." Harry stood, walking through the empty dorm over to the bathroom and mumbling curses all the while. Ron followed him. Harry put a dollop of toothpaste onto his toothbrush and began brushing his teeth, Ron leaning against the doorframe beside him. "So," he started, "What were you dreaming about?" He asked, adopting an innocent tone. "Nu'ing," Harry mumbled around his brush, trying not to blush. Ron gave him another funny look. "Are you sure, mate? Because it sounded an awful lot like you were dreaming about Malfoy."
"You're right; they would be delighted," Draco lied. "I don't need anything at the moment, thanks, but I'll tell you if I think of something." He would think of something eventually - before she took him to Italy. And if he didn't, well, he would never again make fun of Harry's hero complex if it saved him.
To be quite frank, I suspected you and my son shared something quite a bit more meaningful than a friendship. Draco is exceptional at concealing information from all but his mother. But, Mr. Potter, I fail to see how you are at fault for his disappearance. It seems that you and Draco made your plan together and only because of that insufferable poltergeist. It is the reporters' fault for insisting on nosing about into the lives of people who rather deserve privacy after all they've done for our world. And, if you had had the chance to consult me for advice, I would have suggested a similar approach - controlling the flow of information is the most critical thing when confronting news outlets. You could not have anticipated the outcome, so I do not blame you.
He heard the chatter of students as his classmates began arriving. He did not turn to join them but stayed near the pumpkin patch. No one would want him interrupting their conversations anyways.
"Never," Harry promised, meaning it. "Nothing you do can keep me away now. You're stuck with me, your own personal Gryffindor," he joked, trying to lighten the atmosphere. Draco gave him a small smile, and he felt like he had won the Quidditch Cup.
This was much harder than Step 3, Draco found. It was incredibly difficult to imagine various parts of his body changing at the same time, in detail. He could do one or the other, but never both. He always focused too hard on one part, or couldn't quite visualize the intricate details. Draco needed to focus, to quell his excitement, and reach a state of detached determination.
"Yes," was his confident answer.
"I-" Harry couldn't think. What did he want to say? What had he been thinking about? How exactly did the English language work again? "I-"
"Yeah, it was. Actually, I nearly didn't believe him myself. I can't stand to imagine what that would've been like - I already had so little time with him, and it could have been even less." Harry didn't like to think about it, but he had been very close to murdering one of the only adults that he considered family. Thank Merlín for Lupin.
"What have we here? Students out of bed, snogging?" Peeves' all-too-familiar voice sang. They jumped apart to see the ghost upside-down and grinning, and Peeves righted his body and blew a raspberry at them. "Potty and the Ickle Baby Death Eater," he crowed smugly. "Oh, imagine what everyone will say!" He cackled and zoomed off, chanting, "Potty snogged a Death Eater! Potty snogged a Death Eater!"
"It is not fascinating!" He snapped. "I am not dating anyone, neither a he nor a she!" But by not denying an attraction to males, he realized that he had given himself away. Parkinson smirked. "Thanks for the intel, Potter. See you around." And with that, she sauntered off, not giving Harry a chance to deny anything. He slumped backward, far too exhausted to think about how he could fix this. He would have to tell Hermione and Ron before they found out from someone else.
"I mean earlier," Draco elaborated. "You manage to get information out of me with just a look." He sounded put out by that fact.
Draco pulled on his robes, smoothing out the nonexistent wrinkles, and checked his reflection once more to be sure.
Harry nearly choked on his toothpaste. He spat it out into the sink and then turned to face Ron. "What makes you think that?" He asked, attempting to be casual. Ron appeared to be holding back laughter. "Oh, you know. Just a hunch. Though you saying his name a million times may have helped a bit."
"Oh, don't be a prat, Draco. I can tell when you're upset, you know. And I'm not apologizing because of Pansy, though she was right. What I meant is that I was avoiding you, but it wasn't because of anything you did. Well, it was, but- Merlin, I'm bad at this." Harry took a breath and rushed on to make sure Draco heard everything he had to say. "I was avoiding you because of certain things that are entirely my own issues, and no part of it was through any fault of your own. Please, don't blame yourself. It's not your fault I'm having a bisexual crisis." Harry flushed darkly when he realized that he had just outed himself. Draco suddenly looked terribly interested. "You're bisexual? Really? Since when?"
"He's really gone?" Draco whispered shakily into Harry's ear. Harry pulled back so he could smile reassuringly at Draco. "Yes, Draco, he's gone. He's never coming back, I promise." Draco nodded slowly.
Theodore Nott
Draco's smirk was steadily growing smugger. "Harry, are you alright?" He asked with fake innocence. "You're a bit warm. And considering how cold the castle is...are you sure you aren't getting a fever?" False concern practically dripped from his voice.
Suddenly, he was brought out of his daze by chattering as students around him began to pack away their things. Draco blinked, not quite able to believe that he had missed their dismissal after eagerly awaiting it for so long. He sprang into action, shoving his unused quill and blank parchment into his bag, hurrying over to where Harry was talking to his friends. Ron saw him coming and must have mentioned it to Harry because the other boy turned around before he had reached them.
"No, Paul! I think he can understand you - he seems to think you're a threat. I don't think he would appreciate Jack coming here. Even a dumb animal would be able to sense that he's a danger of the worst kind, and I don't believe that dragon is anywhere near dumb. Just let him be; he's not hurting anyone," Maria pleaded.
After a quick detour to the Owlry to send the letter to his mother, Draco rushed to the Great Hall for lunch. He entered, making his way to the familiar Slytherin table.
He noticed that Harry's eyes were getting closer, and he wondered which of them was leaning in. It was probably himself; Harry would never have been the one to initiate. But before their lips could meet, Madam Pince's screech interrupted them. They both jumped and pulled back immediately, looking around, but thankfully she was yelling at a different table for throwing a book.
Was Malfoy right? Was he addicted to saving people? But Harry had never wanted to be the one to save everyone, had never asked for that burden to be placed upon his shoulders. He had always just done what he had believed to be right, and that just happened to mean saving the world. And telling the truth was the right thing to do, whether Malfoy wanted him to or not.
Over the course of the day, his bag split a few more times. In class, in the corridors, in the Great Hall, it happened all the time. Harry was getting seriously fed up. He noticed Draco watching him a few of the times, but he never tried to help again. Harry was walking down to the dungeons now, on his way to the common room. He was beginning to suspect that someone had been tearing his bag. Sure enough, he heard quiet footsteps behind him and a whispered, "Diffin-"
Potter looked slightly remorseful. "Sorry, Malfoy, I forgot. But it's fine. I haven't touched them at all." He gave Draco a sheepish grin. Draco rolled his eyes at Potter's idiocy.
She looked thoughtful. "It could be that you need to have someone with you." She said slowly. "Sometimes, you need the comfort of another person beside you. An animal might work too. A crup or a kneazle or some other creature you could sleep beside. Just knowing you're not alone could be the answer."
"I almost killed you. And I've ruined you forever. Please, never forgive me." He said, unable to look at the scars any longer.
"Malfoy?" He called. There was no answer. "Malfoy?" He tried again. He twisted around one more time, but now he could see a figure walking towards him. It grew closer and closer until Harry saw the platinum blonde hair and familiar gray gaze. "Harry," said Malfoy in a smooth, silky voice. Why was Malfoy calling him by his first name? That wasn't normal. "Malfoy? What's wrong?" He asked. Malfoy sighed.
"Harry, could you tell me, what do I prefer when I stress over exams?" Hermione asked curiously. Harry opened his mouth, hesitating. "You like...white meat. Like fish and poultry." Hermione shook her head, smiling gently. "I don't like to eat meat when I'm nervous. It makes me feel strange. I like pudding because it soothes me." Harry looked from her to Ron, who looked suddenly amused. "That- that doesn't mean anything! I just...I had to observe him so I could figure out when he was up to something, that's all! And his eating habits happen to be really indicative of his mood!" Hermione rolled her eyes. "Of course, Harry." She turned and whispered to Ron. "I don't understand why he didn't figure out his attractions sooner." Ron snickered, and Harry ignored them. He watched Draco push his food around a bit more, and suddenly couldn't take it anymore. He got up and began crossing the hall.
At this, Pansy forgot her fury for a moment. "Potter? That's what he wanted to talk to you about?" She asked shrewdly. Draco nodded.
"Malfoy, I spent days wondering whether I was going the right thing. And in the end, all I did was tell the truth. No more, no less. And everyone deserves the truth. It was not I that saved you from Azkaban. I just brought to light certain facts that were not publicly known, and that was enough to convince the jury that you ultimately deserved your freedom."
If it weren't for his brilliant friend, the past summer might have ended in the complete destruction of the newly restored Grimmauld Place. Instead, she had taught Harry how to use his impatience for more productive matters. When he couldn't wait for a lead on a missing death eater, she taught him to review the case over and over for details or consult other references and precedents. When Harry grew frustrated with the lack of progress in the Ministry, Hermione showed up with a pile of magical law books and coached him in giving speeches. She would know what to do now; she always did.
He ordered a fine rosé - Draco despised any kind of alcohol other than wine. Maybe he was playing into the prissy pureblood stereotype, but he simply had no taste for the cruder, common spirits. Merlin, beer was the absolute worst of the lot.
Draco hugged his mother. They were finally free from the monster. This was a moment he would cherish for the rest of his life. But first...
No one came busting in to save him, so he assumed everything was fine. There was no need for any other privacy charms, considering everyone else was asleep.
Malfoy looked startled, but his expression quickly turned supercilious. "Yes, peasant, you may retrieve the ingredients now. I'm glad you have learned your place."
Parkinson sighed. "I know, honey. But there's always a chance. Please try to sleep now. We have lessons tomorrow."
————————————————————————
"But," Draco said slowly, "you're okay with this? What happened to...to space?" Harry smirked. "Yes, I'm alright with this. Didn't I tell you I thought things over?"
"Don't get soft on me now, Maria. It's a dragon, for heaven's sake! It's almost definitely dangerous, even if it is a child. Anyway, we know nothing about them - it's just as likely to be an innocent baby as a hundred-year-old menace," Paul said, a warning in his tone. "If it makes you feel better, I won't hurt it. I'll just take it over to Jack; he'll know what to do with it."
Draco shakily collapsed into one of the chairs and buried his face in his hands. "Why doesn't he blame me?" He muttered to himself. "Why doesn't he know who I am? Why doesn't he hate me? He should have kicked me out; I don't deserve to be in the same building as him. I don't deserve it. I don't deserve it. I don't-"
"How about we go back to my dorm, darling? I'm sure I can convince Granger that she should do her work out in the common room. Millie will understand, and I know we can bully Abbott into leaving us alone for a while. What do you think?" Pansy offered. Blaise gave her an incredulous look. "Since when has Bulstrode been Millie?" He asked, and Draco found himself laughing at the ridiculousness of it.
Draco was surprised. Harry was brighter than he had ever guessed. In Granger's shadow, he had only ever appeared mediocre. Draco could only hope to find out the true depths of his wisdom someday.
"Forgot it was lunchtime," he offered, filling his plate.
Parkinson looked miffed at that.
Harry stared. Malfoy laughing was strangely...beautiful. His face was carefree, grey eyes sparkling with mischief. He laughed loudly like nothing was holding him back any longer. Then he processed what Malfoy had said.
——————————————————
Malfoy gave him a questioning look but thankfully didn't seem too angry. "What do you mean, Potter? They said quite a few truthful things."
"Er, Mrs. Malfoy?" Harry said tentatively.
Yes, his inner voice was right. Just because Malfoy acted strangely this one time, didn't mean it would be a recurring event. Harry made sure to lower any expectations he had. He retrieved the ingredients, except for the werewolf hair, and dumped them on the desk he shared with Malfoy. Malfoy had already started to heat up their cauldron, and he quickly snatched up the Dragon's blood and measured it out before pouring it into the cauldron. After a minute, Malfoy held out his hand, palm up, and said, "Circe's Desire."
Eventually, he came to something that was definitely a village. It was significantly larger, and Draco felt a bit safer attempting to land there. Moments later, he was on the ground, more or less hidden from sight.
"I'm sorry, Potter, but there is an investigation underway. I cannot allow you to enter-" the muffled voice got louder and louder until the door banged open, revealing Harry and a harried-looking Auror just behind him.
"All in favor of declaring the defendant innocent?"
"Yes?" Draco asked smoothly. With great difficulty, Harry collected his thoughts into a string of words that could be interpreted as a somewhat coherent explanation and forced them out of his mouth.
Fiancé? Draco wasn't engaged, was he?
"Anyway, hang on. We've got to get you to the Improper Use of Magic Office. I could do the reversal charm, but if you got stuck, then you're probably transforming for the first time, and I don't want to mess with that. You'll also be registered, though I can't say whether or not you'll be punished." Charlie frowned. "Anyway, we've got a long ride ahead. You really were out in the middle of nowhere."
"Maria! I came as soon as I could. Where is the dragon?" His voice wavered uncertainly on the last word as if he were uncomfortable saying it.
She'll find him.
"Always the tone of surprise," Ron muttered. Hermione ignored him.
At nearly two in the morning, he slipped out once more. He was being reckless, but he no longer cared. Draco wanted this like nothing ever before.
"I never expected that you could ever like me back. Especially with our history...I'm always waiting for it to all come crashing down. If I don't hope for anything better, then I won't be as devastated when it happens..." Harry looked pleadingly at Draco, and Draco grew increasingly dismayed by the boy's outlook on life with every word he uttered. Even Draco, renowned in Slytherin house and among the eighth years for his negativity, was not as gloomy and cynical as the Golden Boy. And that disturbed him. Harry was so bright, a beacon of light for every witch and wizard. He was their pillar of strength, the Wizarding World's only hope, and the reason they were still alive. Harry was unfailingly optimistic, even in the face of certain death. Draco wanted to resurrect the Dark Lord and eviscerate him himself for forcing the Chosen One to grow up too fast. They were still kids, and it felt unnatural that Harry was already far more pessimistic than most adults.
After they demolished the meal together, Madam Pomfrey came out of her office. She checked them with spells, then dismissed both of them to their common room. Class had ended only moments ago if the loud footsteps and chatter of students was anything to go by.
Who was he kidding? Certainly not himself, nor Ron, definitely not Hermione, and he was pretty sure the entire school knew he was obsessed.
"Highness? Me?" Draco asked, confused, and more than a little suspicious. The mysterious man didn't stop to elaborate. He clamped a large hand around Draco's shoulder and steered him out of the door. There was a massive limousine waiting right outside - it was so long that it practically stretched from one end of the block to the other. The black-suited man pushed him firmly - but not roughly - through the open car door and slid in after.
Thank goodness Malfoy was left-handed, otherwise, his arm would constantly be brushing against Harry's as he sipped his drink. Harry almost shifted away, but he didn't want to give away the fact that such a small thing was making him so uncomfortable. Zabini scooted closer to Malfoy again, and this time he snapped at him. "Move away, Blaise, or I'll end up in Potter's lap." Harry flushed.
The third thing he noticed was that he was not alone. His bed shifted minutely, but Harry was still attuned to such small changes from the war. He opened his eyes but did not see anyone. He concluded that they must be behind him. As he tried to turn around, he felt arms tightly wrapped around him. That was the fourth thing he noticed.
In fact, the thing he hated, despised, absolutely detested about the voice was what it made him feel.
Harry stopped. That voice belonged to Parkinson, he was sure of it. He tiptoed closer until he could see the common room. Malfoy was lying with his head in Parkinson's lap, her fingers threading through his platinum blonde hair. Harry felt a stab of something go through him. It unsettled him. He shouldn't feel a stab of anything except disgust when confronted with such a sight.
Harry blushed, and Draco realized he had hinted that if it weren't for all the books, they would be able to fit on Harry's bed together. And that had certain...implications. He was about to be embarrassed, too, except that he remembered what Pansy had told him about flirting. So he smirked and winked instead, and Harry blushed harder. Then Draco gathered his things, dumping them into his bag, and sauntered off to the library, not checking if Harry was following him. He knew he would.
He slipped into the old classroom, and Draco looked up at the sudden movement of the door. The blond grinned at the space to the right of him. "Hi, Harry! What are you doing up so late?"
"Mate, Harry, seriously, if it's going to bother you that much, just go do it. We both know if you don't, you'll feel guilty about it for the rest of eternity. Just go to the bloody ferret's trial. Merlin, I don't know why you would ever want to defend that git, but..." Harry stopped. "So, I should go?" He asked doubtfully. Ron groaned.
——————————————————
"I'm not immune to you either," Harry protested. "If you wanted me to do something, do you think I could refuse?"
Enough was enough. Draco was not some kind of royalty, no matter that his actual father insisted that they were related to the Tudors, the only British royal house to have magical blood.
Ron groaned and voiced Harry's thoughts for him. He made a mental note to thank him when he regained enough energy to speak.
Might as well give it a go. Draco stayed back after class, ignoring the questioning look from Harry. He waited until everyone else left, then approached McGonagall's desk. "Professor," he started, "I was wondering if I could ask for some clarification." She gave him a curious glance, then went back to her papers, but signaled for him to continue.
Draco awkwardly patted Hermione on the back, holding back a sigh of relief when she let go. "It's wonderful that you're safe," she said. "Harry was inconsolable without you. It was heartbreaking to watch."
McGonagall was sitting behind the desk, two men in Auror robes in front of her. One was a stranger, while the other Harry recognized as Head Auror Robards, who he had worked with briefly over the summer to capture the remaining Death Eaters.
"Don't say it if it's hard right now," Harry murmured against his lips. After a moment, Draco pulled back slightly.
"Excuse me," a hand shot out to stop him. Draco lifted his eyes to see a man wearing dark sunglasses, clad in a black suit and wearing some device that connected to his ear. Behind him stood three more men that looked nearly identical. The overall effect would have been intimidating to anyone but a Slytherin.
Robards stood and held his hand out, and Harry took it, not wanting to be rude. The other man was introduced as Auror Wilson, and then they launched right into an explanation.
Zabini saw him heading in their direction. He nudged Draco and said something, making his head shoot up. His eyes widened when he saw Harry. Harry stopped and motioned for Draco to meet him outside. Draco glanced at his friends, who said something, before he looked back and nodded, standing up and walking towards the exit. Harry followed close behind, ignoring the whispering that broke out at their strange interaction.
"Of course," Harry placated him, rolling his eyes. "This peasant wants to know whether you'll ever answer his humble invitation." He held his breath in anticipation.
When he finished, they hurried back to their dorm and went back to sleep in their respective beds but not without sharing a goodnight kiss.
Your worry for Draco is touching and most reassuring. That you went to such lengths - followed an owl, Mr. Potter! You're likely to catch a cold like that - makes me feel better about Draco's position. I cannot thank you enough for showing concern for my son when others most certainly will not.
This time Blaise patted his hand sympathetically before offering him meaningless platitudes. "Sure, Draco, whatever you say." Draco almost opened his mouth to express his feelings for Potter once more, but Pansy shoved a croissant into his mouth. He glared. He really needed to make sure this didn't end up as a recurring theme of their mealtimes. Draco spent the rest of breakfast silently ranting about Potter in his head, because clearly, no one else would listen, and not looking at Potter. Not once. Not even that one time.
"You know, it's been far too long since we played a prank on the Gryffindors," Blaise said casually. "We're losing our Slytherin reputation. All the other houses think we've gone soft. Even the Hufflepuffs look down on us."
————————————————————————
"Everything, Harry. Nothing is right when you're not with me." Harry's heart skipped a beat. Did Malfoy like him? He couldn't believe it. "What do you mean, Malfoy? Do you-" He was cut off by Malfoy, who impatiently said, "You know exactly what I mean, Harry."
Harry narrowed his eyes. "I'm not scared." He stated firmly. Draco began to shake his head. "No, I didn't mean to imply you were, I just-"
All six of them made their way down to the feast together, however awkward. Granger wasn't all that bad to talk to. She was still a bit annoying, but at least she could hold an intellectual conversation. Granger and Pansy seemed to get along quite well, too. The Weasel and Blaise even had an awkward, short exchange.
"What do you mean, 'now,' Malfoy? I already got the hairs, see?" He held up a vial of greyish hairs for Draco to observe. Draco gave Potter an angry and slightly incredulous look.
Halloween was tomorrow, and the whole school was abuzz with preparation. Hagrid brought in over a dozen incredibly large pumpkins, which were carved using spells to depicts various scenes. The Great Hall was spectacularly decorated in orange and black, bats occasionally flying around. Peeves took great delight in becoming invisible and sneaking up behind students to whisper "boo" in their ears. And occasionally, when a student was walking alone, they swore they heard mysterious cackling and whispering. Thus, everyone had begun to travel as groups, which led to quite a lot of traffic in the corridors.
Draco very nearly blushed, but his extensive control over his every bodily function prevented that, thank Merlin. He nodded, pretending like he was just another over-eager student who wanted to learn as much as they possibly could. Channeling his inner Granger, Draco straightened his already ramrod-straight back and said in an innocent voice, "Of course, professor, I would love to try something more complex. I think a task to challenge my focus would be very beneficial. Do you have any suggestions for me?"
He glanced down in panic, only to see the material damp and dark with the metallic substance. Draco looked around frantically, but there was no one within miles he could go to for help, that list being limited to his mother, Pansy, and Blaise, and he never apparated whilst drunk. It was just asking to get splinched.
"I can't even remember them." He said, out of nowhere. "The only pictures I have of them are in a photo book Hagrid gave me in 1st year. I saw them then, too, in the Mirror of Erised." Draco didn't know what that was, but he didn't interrupt to ask. "Then, in fourth year, I saw them again in the graveyard. They were just these strange ghost-like things, but they encouraged me, helping me get away from Voldemort. I saw a few memories of them in a Pensieve, too." Harry grimaced, and Draco wondered why. But Harry wasn't done. "And finally, just before I died, I was able to see them. Remus and Sirius, too. They made it better, you know. Easier to walk towards death. I couldn't have done it without them, without knowing I was going to be with them again." Silent tears fell from his eyes, but Harry didn't seem to notice. He fell silent once more, and Draco started to rub his back. Just as Draco was about to slip away, Harry said one final thing. "The Dementors. When they come close, I can hear my parents dying. My dad first, he tried to slow down Voldemort so my mum could get us to safety. Then I hear her screams, Voldemort telling her to get out of the way, then a flash of light. She needn't have died. Snape asked him not to kill her. He would have let her go." Harry sounded so vulnerable. So afraid, like a scared child. Draco couldn't possibly leave him like that. So he stayed, wrapping his arms around Harry as he cried. Harry didn't speak again for hours.
After breakfast, the trio made a quick detour to their dorms to grab their books, then walked the short distance to Snape's classroom.
After lunch, Harry and his friends made their way up to the Defense classroom. The new teacher was an old witch named Professor Magworst. And her name said it all. She was the worst. Though Umbridge would always hold the special title of "Worst DADA teacher ever," Magworst was a close second. Or third, because Harry had nearly forgotten Lockhart. Anyways, Magworst spent the entire first lesson going over spells and facts they had learned in 6th year with Snape. And she frequently mixed up her information. Harry was incredulous when she said that boggarts suck out your souls, and dementors turn into your happiest thoughts. He was disappointed that they had yet another useless teacher, but he supposed there was really not much anyone could teach him about defeating dark wizards at this point. Still, he hoped that Dumbledore's Army wouldn't make a comeback. He wanted a nice, peaceful year, and teaching the DA was anything but.
"I don't like where this is going," Draco declared.
"What is it, Draco? Is something wrong? Is this...is this about last night?" Harry looked worried, biting his lip endearingly. Draco took a breath and opened his mouth again, but Harry interrupted him once more. "Please don't tell me you regret it. I knew this wouldn't end well." He said despairingly, tugging his fingers through his tousled hair and beginning to pace. Draco watched with his mouth slightly agape.
"Then this is what I say we should do," Harry declared and proceeded to tell him his plan.
"So," Draco began, apprehensively meeting Harry's eyes, "I was wondering if I should tell Mother about- about us. If there is an us?" He asked, unsure. Harry resisted the urge to smile. "I would love for there to be an us if that's what you want," Harry assured him.
"No, Harry! You add in the salamander blood after the frog's legs, not before." He told him for the third time. Harry sighed. "I'm sorry, I'm taking up all your time. You can go back to your work, don't worry about me."
"Er- Harry, I know I'm vain, but I don't require a mirror at all times." Draco picked up the small, oval-shaped piece of glass and held it closer to examine it. It was only the size of an egg and was attached to a chain like a pendant. The mirror was edged with a simple silver border. Harry cleared his throat, and Draco looked up at him. "It's not for looking at your reflection," he clarified. "It's an enchanted mirror. Sirius gave me the set a couple of years ago. I got its pair back from Aberforth, so we can use them to communicate at any distance." Harry fished out a matching necklace from under his shirt and held it up. Draco looked at it then back at his mirror.
"Do you remember anything afterward?" Potter asked him cautiously. Draco shook his head, and Potter suddenly looked relieved. Draco raised both eyebrows. "Why, Potter? Did something happen that I should know about?" Potter frantically shook his head, but a faint blush gave him away. Draco was about to interrogate him about it, but Snape's arrival prevented him from doing so.
The Chief Warlock began. "Draco Lucius Malfoy," he read, looking down his nose at Draco. "You have been accused of conspiring with He-who-shall-not-be-named to commit the mass genocide of muggles and muggleborns, torture of innocent children while at Hogwarts, and the attempted murder of Albus Dumbledore."
"Fine!" Pansy snapped. She turned to glare at Potter. After a few seconds, he looked away. Pansy turned back to Draco. "See? Problem solved. Now shut up and eat."
Draco took a seat as far away as he could. The large man grinned knowingly at him, but Draco figured if there were ever a time to be petty, it was while he was being kidnapped.
Malfoy was giving him an odd look and said in a strange voice, "No, Potter, that's not what I think. I simply meant that you focus far too much on the good in people. I am truly thankful for what you did for Mother, but I'm not sure I deserved the same kindness."
He was getting bored. He read on.
"Well, he was up to something 6th year, wasn't he? I was right then, so why can't I be right now, too? I should keep an eye on him, just to make sure." Harry ignored everyone else's protests.
"You mean other than the one you just asked?" Draco raised an eyebrow inquisitively. "Alright, but I reserve the right not to answer." Harry rolled his eyes and muttered something that sounded like "Slytherins."
Malfoy mumbled something and buried his face into his pillow. Harry got the inexplicable urge to walk back in there and dump a pitcher of cold water on the git. But he refrained, if only because he knew Malfoy would get him back worse later on. And Harry did not fancy having a raging Slytherin plotting his demise, as Malfoy would undoubtedly do if Harry ruined his hair like that.
"Merlin, he is depressed," Harry said in surprise. Hermione and Ron looked over their shoulders and then back at Harry. "Whatever do you mean, Harry? He looks a bit sad but depressed?" Hermione said confusedly. Harry nodded. "His plate is full of vegetables. He usually fills it with one-third vegetables, one-third protein, and one-third grain. And he's barely eating. And none of it is French or Italian food. He didn't eat any protein in 6th year, and it didn't get this bad until later when it got closer to when he...you know. And in 4th year, during the Tournament, he never ate French or Italian, which he usually does. I figured he was mad about not getting to participate when I did. But he's never done both at the same time. He must feel terrible. You're right, I do need to apologize." He directed the last part at Hermione, who was staring. Ron was, too. "What?" He asked, shifting uncomfortably.
"See that!" Ron shouted, unable to keep the smile off his face. "That's your bloody influence, Malfoy! She's becoming a Slytherin!"
The severely cut sleek black hair was all too familiar to him, and he muttered, "Dammit, Parkinson" under his breath. The girl had the most inconvenient timing. He walked behind them, not hiding per se, but not making himself known either. It wasn't eavesdropping if he wasn't hiding.
Harry tried to play it off, just like Draco. It was hard being around the other boy all the time - the dorm, classes, the common room - Draco was just everywhere. Those damnably beautiful, yet piercing gray eyes, the soft, sexy blonde hair, and the ethereal angled features were everywhere he went. He wondered if it would be so bad if Draco was planning on using him, as long as Harry finally got to kiss Draco.
"So you had him to yourself for an entire morning and afternoon, and you wasted it sleeping. Honestly, Draco, it's like you're not even trying to seduce him." Pansy scolded.
"Holy shit," Draco said as he was pulled out of the pensieve. Harry laughed and asked, "Which one was it?"
"Doesn't much look like it," Zabini noted.
Harry leaned over to read the page aloud. Clearly, it was a step in the process of becoming an animagus. Not that Harry was familiar with it in any capacity. Draco slammed the book shut before he could read the entire page.
Harry ran back to get his broom and then made for the Owlery, sprinting at full speed. He enlisted a plain brown school owl to help him, giving it a blank sheet of parchment and telling it to seek Draco Malfoy, feeling hope as the bird took off. Harry mounted his broom and went after it, mentally cursing how slow owls were.
"Harry Potter. Oh, Merlin, it's Harry Potter!"
Draco sighed. "I know, Harry. But, I never want you to feel pressured into doing something before you're comfortable doing it. I don't want to see you run away from me again." He frowned, looking at the ground. He hated that he had caused the brunet distress, and silently vowed to do everything in his power to ensure it never happened again.
"I wish this stupid crush would just go away. I wish I could just ignore him and get on with my life."
"Why aren't you going to class?" He asked, trying to adopt a soothing tone. Harry glared at him harder. "It's none of your business, Malfoy. Just leave!" Harry nearly shouted and turned to face the other way. Draco was horrified to find himself tearing up. "Okay, Harry. I'm sorry." He winced at how hurt he sounded. Draco quickly turned and moved to exit the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
The youngest known Death Eater was pardoned by courts allegedly because of testimony given by Potter himself. This begs the question: How long has their alleged affair been going on, and is this the reason Potter spoke on Malfoy's behalf? Perhaps the Wizengamot needs to reinvestigate the reasons behind Potter's impassioned defense of Malfoy and bring into question the veracity of his claims. Furthermore, we urge Potter to consider whether the Malfoy heir, disgraced and dishonored, is taking advantage of his fame and reputation to secure a better future for himself. The Boy Who Lived would undoubtedly provide a means by which (continued on page 5)
Ron finally surfaced with a pained grin. "Of course not, mate. We'll always support you." He croaked out. Hermione gave him a proud look.
Everyone was still shocked. "I think it's great, Harry. Ron, we should be doing the same thing with Zabini, I'm sure we'll find he's not that bad either." Neville said evenly. Harry shot him a grateful smile. Ron didn't.
Slowly, he tentatively brought his lips closer to Draco's. He felt the other boy's breath on his lips, and then finally their lips were touching. Draco sighed into the kiss and his other hand reached up to tangle itself into the raven black hair. They moved slowly, trying to memorize how the other's lips felt. Then, Harry felt a hot tongue licking at his bottom lip and he gasped, allowing Draco to enter his mouth. Draco was thorough, exploring every inch of his mouth with his tongue. Their kiss was hot, searing, as Harry took over and pushed his tongue into Draco's mouth. Harry's arms had wound themselves around Draco's neck and they were kissing passionately. Draco tugged on Harry's hair, rougher than he had in his dream. But Harry still gave a delighted moan, spurring their kiss into new heights of intensity.
Draco walked onto the familiar platform where the scarlet Hogwarts Express awaited its passengers. He had never expected that he would once more board the familiar train. He was still stunned that McGonagall had invited him of all people back for one final year. After all, it was partially his fault that the new 8th years hadn't been able to learn anything last year.
——————————————————
"I want to say it, even if it is hard. I love you, Harry, more than words can express," he said reverently. Harry laughed, and it was a joyous, free sound.
A cold hand on his face brought him out of his reverie.
Draco Malfoy stood there, looking at him. More specifically, his body. Harry didn't like it when people looked at his body. He hated seeing the pity in their eyes when they realized how skinny and underfed he was. So he fell back to his natural defense mechanism. Anger.
Draco almost smiled. Because, now he knew that this wasn't just a very good dream, it was his reality.
"Parkinson did a great job with all this," Potter said in a low voice, edging a bit closer. Draco fought to keep his voice even. "Yeah," he agreed. "Pansy's pretty great at this kind of thing." Potter was standing next to him now, shoving his hands into the pockets of the muggle jeans he wore. "And you?" He asked. "I would think you'd be pretty good at this kind of thing too." Draco shook his head, dimly wondering why Potter was being so polite. "I just brought the Firewhiskey," he said, gesturing at it. Potter nodded awkwardly.
A rush of rage prompted him to launch himself at Draco, who suddenly looked very worried and slightly terrified. Draco held his hands up in surrender, but that didn't stop Harry from pinning him to the wall. Harry's forearm was pushed against Draco's throat, his other hand pointing his wand at Draco's face. Draco didn't even struggle.
"Let's go, boys! They'll be handing out our timetables at breakfast!"
"Malfoy! It's you!" he heard Weasley exclaim.
Harry craned his neck further to see what was written on the page. "Step 4: Simultaneous Partial Transformation," he read aloud. "Once you have managed a partial animagus transformation, you will begin to transform multiple limbs at once to begin to acclimate your body to the sensation of transformation, and your mind to the complexities and focus required of a full transformation. By the time you have completed this step, you-" Draco reached for the book and slammed it shut before he could read anymore. He didn't really mind if the other boy knew what he was doing; he just wanted to be petty. Harry's eyes found his, and Draco didn't even try to avoid them.
"Draco," Harry breathed, and then he was striding over and engulfing him in the warmest, coziest, most wonderful hug Draco had ever had, squeezing him so tight it was near uncomfortable, but at the same time, perfect. Draco rubbed his back, reveling in the love he felt radiating from his boyfriend.
——————————————————
Harry groaned. "Ron," he said, "kindly shut up now." He felt the tips of his ears turning pink. Draco gave him a smug look. "Fancy me for a while, did you, Potter?" He asked teasingly.
"Hello, Potter," she greeted him.
"That's wonderful, Harry. How did you find out?" Harry shifted awkwardly. "That's not important. You guys aren't mad?" He asked.
Draco just banged his head on the table in defeat. It was rather un-Malfoyish, but desperate times call for desperate measures. He gave Pansy a pleading look, turning his head sideways, so his forehead was still resting on the table. Pansy just gave him a look that clearly said she was on Blaise's side. Draco groaned.
"Finally," Harry sighed with impatience. He could see McGonagall and several other witches and wizards in Auror's robes apparating nearby, and he shifted his weight from side to side while waiting for them to reach him. As they approached, he recognized Auror Wilson and a couple of others that he couldn't quite name.
Potter started. Then, interestingly enough, a blush stained his cheeks, turning them a dark red. Draco looked at him suspiciously.
Potter shook his head. "You should go. The Aurors will be here soon. I won't tell them I saw you." He turned and started walking away. "Wait! Potter!" Draco yelled after a moment. Potter stopped but didn't turn around. "Thank you. For the wand, I mean. " He said. Potter nodded. Draco hoped he would understand the meaning behind his words, the things he couldn't bring himself to say. But then again, this was Potter. Draco would have been surprised if he was at all adept in the art of reading between the lines. Potter started moving, towards his friends, towards the dead, and towards the light.
Harry managed to reach the front of the group, Ron beside him. Ron groaned. "Bloody fantastic. I'm with Zabini and Macmillan. At least Neville will be there to keep me sane. And alive." Harry was too busy looking for his own name to listen to Ron. He scanned the list and finally spotted his name. Next to it was:
Suddenly, the woman jerked against her restraints and yelled with renewed energy. "You!" she shrieked. "You miserable piece of filth, trying to corrupt my Draco? How dare you show your face in front of me? Come here, and I'll teach you exactly what the world thinks of rubbish like you!" The woman was no longer beautiful, reduced to a frantic, hissing, feral beast, muttering obscenities and insults.
"You look like absolute shit, sweetie," Pansy said bluntly, stepping back to examine his face. "Is this because of last night? Were you able to sleep afterward?"
Harry blinked. This was not anything like what he had expected. He thought he had forgotten to do something important or anything else along those lines. It was oddly...cute. He smiled widely, catching the Slytherin off guard.
Once out into the draft corridors, Harry activated the map, wondering where he should go. Almost immediately, he saw a familiar name and smiled, changing the direction of his feet onto a new course.
Harry smiled briefly, warmly, but then gave him a searching look. "And you're sure this has nothing to do with our last encounter? Because I told you, I sorted myself out. I'm prepared now."
He laughed. "Hullo to you too, Hyperion." The crup was quite large now, big enough to lick at his hand and sniff the bags hopefully.
Draco was alarmed by this rather impassioned profession of aversion from the seemingly-compassionate woman. If Maria, who felt sympathy for a dragon, of all things, was so adamant in her dislike of this Jack, Draco certainly did not want to end up in that man's hands. He opened his eyes and attempted to fix Paul with a very stern look.
Harry bit his lip. There was a battle raging inside him. On the one hand, he felt that he owed it to Draco and Narcissa, to tell the truth about how they had saved him. On the other hand...
"Oomph," he said, bumping into someone slightly taller than him.
Harry ran all the way to the common room. He burst in, ignoring the startled looks everyone had. He scanned the room and spotted Ron and Hermione doing their work in a corner. He marched up to them and grabbed Hermione's arm, motioning for Ron to follow them. He dragged her to her dorm room. He certainly couldn't go to his own dorm, and Ron's was in the same general direction. He dragged Hermione to her bed and sat down opposite her. Ron sat next to Hermione, and it was suddenly very similar to the day when he came out to them.
"Why is it that whenever I come in, Potter, you're in various stages of undress?" He drawled. Potter flushed, reminding him of the incident that morning. He let a predatory smirk cross his face, making Potter gain a nervous look. Draco pushed off the door, prowling closer to Potter, who stood still, petrified.
"Wow, I think she wrote more to you than she did me," Draco said, surprise coloring his voice. He was craning his neck to see the letter. Harry hesitated. Should he let Draco see the letter...? He decided he would wait until Draco had sent a reply. That way, he would be sure to write what Harry wanted him to. With that in mind, Harry folded the letter again, ignoring Draco's annoyed look. "I assume you wanted to have my response?" Harry asked him, not giving away anything. Draco nodded, still miffed. The blond pulled out a half-written letter, smoothing it out on the desk.
"But Gin, if Malfoy is planning something, then that is important! I have to find out what he is up to. If it turns out to be nothing, I'll leave him alone. Simple." Harry was determined to foil Malfoy's plans.
They walked in strained silence for a couple of seconds. Then, Parkinson said, "So what has Potter done this time?" Harry started at the use of his name and listened harder to see if he had done something to make Draco like this.
Harry was at a loss. Never before had his path been so unclear. He always had some idea of what to do next - save the Sorcerer's Stone, enter the Chamber of Secrets, make sure everyone knew Voldemort had returned, rescue Sirius from the Ministry, destroy the Horcruxes, walk into the forest, defeat Voldemort. That had always been his goal: defeat Voldemort. But now, he had no idea how to get Draco back. He could beat a genocidal maniac, but he couldn't save the man he loved. That had been the theme of his entire life, hadn't it?
Draco sighed. It wasn't that big of a deal. He could live with Harry avoiding him for a while longer. He had lived with being his nemesis for years, so this wasn't all that much, comparatively. But at least he had been able to see Harry then. Now, he barely saw the beautiful green eyes, the messy black hair, and gorgeous golden skin. He only saw flashes of Harry out of the corner of his eye, unless they were in class. He missed him. It was almost too cruel that Draco had finally become friends with Harry only to mess up and ask him to kiss him. At least this was better than if the Gryffindor had refused. Salazar, that would have been awkward.
"My apologies, father. Next time I'll be sure to run away with greater success," Draco drawled, unable to bring himself to regret his impertinence.
Draco cleared his throat. "So, anyway, how were your summers?" Pansy's smirk widened, but she let the blatant change of subject slide. "Oh, you know. Went home, mourned, worried about you, worried about Blaise, debated whether I should come back, and did a ton of shopping. Blaise?"
Please, help him. Protect him. He will not tell me if he needs anything, the stubborn boy. He will hide things from me, so he doesn't cause me unnecessary worry. I ask that you watch over him because I am not there to do it. He has few friends and many enemies. You are respected and influential; I will be content to leave him in your care. He needs you, though he would never admit it. I hope I am not overstepping, but somehow I think you would do this even if I did not ask. Still, I would appreciate confirmation, if only for my peace of mind. Send your answer back with Draco. You may let him read this if you like. He is nosy, no matter how much I have taught him to respect others' privacy. I suppose that is Lucius' fault. It is entirely your decision.
Draco cursed and fumbled around for his wand, finally tugging it out from the depths of his robes. He cast a Lumos, only for it to spark and fizzle out almost immediately. No wands, then.
-------------
Well, unfortunately, trouble was part of Draco's plan. He needed to make sure this got all the way to the Ministry, and that was a tall order. If everyone in the village saw him, that would significantly raise his chances of being noticed.
He paused there, quill suspended in the air, ink dripping gently. Maybe he should find Harry, so he could tell his mother what his reaction was to the note. He also wondered if he should tell her about their involvement with each other, and desperately wanted Harry's opinion on the matter. Decided, he resolved to find the boy as soon as they finished Charms class.
The door clicked and swung open.
Forty-five minutes later, Draco sailed out of the room with his appearance perfected down to the last hair. There had been no sign of Harry the entire time. He sauntered through the common room, out of the dungeons, and up to the Great Hall. Plopping down at the Slytherin table, he began to fill his plate, ignoring the whispers that accompanied his arrival.
Finally, the girl smiled at him. "Oh, all right, darling. Tell me everything." And Draco knew she had forgiven him.
Once his mind was blissfully blank, he recalled his dragon form. Though small and short-lived, Draco had loved being a dragon. He felt so free and so powerful - like nothing was out of his reach. He smiled as the elegant creature filled his mind. But this was only the easy part. This is what he had done in Step 2. Now, it was time to go further. He opened his eyes to read the next bit.
When all his tears had dried up, Harry finally straightened. He gave Draco a small smile, and Draco carefully extricated himself from the black-haired boy. The food was completely cold, but Draco made Harry eat it anyways after casting a quick warming charm. Draco fussed over Harry, making him lie down as soon as he was finished eating. Harry snuggled under the blankets, and Draco gave him a sad smile. He began to turn away to leave because he didn't want to skip any more class, but Harry caught his arm. "Stay?" He asked, and Draco couldn't possibly refuse. So he stayed, lying down beside Harry, back to back, until they both fell asleep.
Harry ran his hands up Draco's arms soothingly. "Hey," he spoke softly. "It'll be fine. Besides, this is all just a formality. Even if they stand up and start booing, it won't change how I feel about you. In fact, if they do that, I'll hex every last one of them."
They weren't. Yet, Draco could never refuse his mother, not when she spoke with such faith. Without looking back, Draco nodded, not quite believing what he was about to agree to. "Of course. Am I dismissed, father? Or have you other need of me?"
When Harry had received his letter, he was elated. A final year at the place he had always considered his home? There was no question as to whether or not he would go. Even with the memories from the final battle, it was a chance he could not pass up. All he had to do was avoid the Forest, and he would be fine. But now, he was reconsidering. He didn't want to be so close to the snake's den. And Malfoy and his minions looked far too pleased with this arrangement for it to be a good thing.
He decided that he would take a quick shower to unwind before he had to sleep. He needed to relax.
She paused, thinking. "Hmm. Yes, you're quite right that this requires an exceptional ability to focus. You're already very good at that, Mr. Malfoy, I'm sure you can manage this level of it. Unless you wanted to try something more advanced...?" McGonagall asked shrewdly, raising one severe eyebrow.
Parkinson stepped forwards and cleared her throat. "Potter, Granger, Weasley. Do you mind if we sit here?" She looked like she expected them to say yes, they actually did mind. In fact, Ron opened his mouth to say probably that exact thing, but Hermione beat him to it.

"Hey Harry," Seamus greeted, sitting diagonally across from him. Harry nodded back. Seamus leaned forward, looking intently at him. "Are the rumors true, mate? Please tell me they are." Seamus gave him a pleading look.
Harry thanked her with a weak smile and got to work reading.
Draco was still gaping at him. "Animagi?" He asked weakly. Harry nodded. "Unregistered, of course. Sirius was a big, black dog, kind of like the Grim. I kept seeing him during third year, and it made me think I was going to die soon. My dad was a stag, which is probably why that's my Patronus, and why a reindeer is my animagus. And Wormtail..." Harry couldn't stop his face from grimacing. "He was a rat. Ron's rat actually, for about thirteen years while he was in hiding. That's how he escaped when Sirius went after him."
Harry turned his attention towards the book that lay open in front of Draco. He recognized it easily. Hermione had spent far too long with her nose stuck in the leather cover, insisting it would be the best source from which to learn theoretical human transfiguration. "Really, Draco? Transformation Magick for the Transfiguration Master? You hardly qualify as a Transfiguration Master." It was the blond's turn to scowl. Hermione wasn't exactly a Master either, but she was certainly smart enough to try.
"Now this really just proves my theory," she finished.
You should smile more.
But Malfoy only smirked at him, glancing over him once more. "There's no need to knock when I'm sleeping here, Potter," he drawled. "Or did you forget that even the Golden Boy doesn't get a room all to himself?"
He looked up at Draco. "Animagus?" He asked to confirm. Draco nodded, looking slightly pissed. "Why? I mean, you could do this after school, why waste your nights on this now-?" Harry asked, confused as to why in Merlin's name this warranted such a significant loss of sleep. Especially considering how tired the boy looked. Dark bags lingered under his eyes, and he looked utterly exhausted.
Alina had asked if he needed anything. If Draco was discreet, he could probably trick her into giving him the means to escape.
"Do you think he's mad?" One whispered to the other.
