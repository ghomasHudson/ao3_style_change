Seeing Draco that day made him think about high school again. The only time in his life when he had felt the most like himself. He missed that feeling more than anything, he wished he could go back, he wished he could know why he felt so wrong. That night, he looked at himself in the mirror after coming home. He looked the same as before, a bit older, a bit worn out by life, but he felt empty, he was like a hollow shell.
Draco. Draco. He remembered him now. He had changed a lot. He remembered Draco always sitting at the front of the class, always being quiet, the smart and ugly kid in the class that nobody wanted to deal with. Harry never saw him talking to anyone, apart from him. The blond always looked small, fragile and Harry had taken pity on him. He began to talk to Draco on the last year of high school. They made small talks, Harry made sure to tell him good morning everyday and sometimes, they even ate together. He never had known if Draco liked him or not, or if he was just happy for someone to talk to him. They never talked again after high school was over anyway.
"Fucking finally."
Anyway, as I remind you every time, I must tell you again that my shop is open only until 6PM Potter and not 6:40PM. I may still be in the shop at this hour, but I do not have any obligation to open the door for you. As I tell you everytime, I have an owl which can deliver you your order. If you choose to pick up your products yourself, please, at least be on time.
“Good for you.” Harry replied. He could not help thinking that it was the opposite for Harry. University was a painful topic for him.
Goodbye, Potter."
"Harry.
"Hello Potter, this is Malfoy.
"Bye, Draco. See you soon."
"Harry.
"Potter.
"Look, obviously, you are an idiot but...you're cute. I like you and it does help that you look very handsome in these pyjamas. The colour really suits you. What's your name?"
You guessed right, your order is waiting for you. You said you would come by at 5, it is almost 6, Harry. Hurry up before I kill you. You know I have to go see Teddy after I close the shop. Hurry the fuck up!"
That meant that it was the day of his birthday. All he needed to do was to fall asleep.
“Oh.” The blond seemed disappointed, but he still gave Harry a quick smile. “I’m Draco. Draco Malfoy. We…We used to go the same high school. Hogwarts. You…You gave me…Anyway, I’m surprised to see you here after so many years.”
Good night, Harry. I love you."
the two of us! Wouldn't it be wonderful, Harry? Think about it. Think about me, waiting under the tree, wearing whatever suits your fantasies. I am all ears, Harry. I will do anything."
What? Where was he and what was this guy's deal with insults? Wait.
You can come pick up your order anytime as I am already done with it. I am not sure as to why you need so many Pepper Up potions and Cough potions. Do you, perhaps, get sick every other week? Are you that paranoid to get so many potions for the day that you will become sick? But, what will you do with your thousands of potions then? Where do you even keep them? Forget it, this is not my business, I am sorry Potter, I do not mean to pry. I am sure you have a very good, very genuine reason to buy all these particular potions. Although, I very much understand your need to buy so many Sleekeazy's Hair potion. Must be a very tough life to live, with hair like yours. Do you even put some in your hair? Because it does not very much seem like you do. I am sorry to say this Potter, but your hair is a grand mess. There is no other word for it. I do not say this to hurt your feelings, it is simply true.
"Hello Potter, this is Malfoy.
“Look, it’s nice to catch up, but, I need to work. Do you want anything?” He saw his boss looking at him from the corner of his eyes and remembered where he was. He couldn’t afford to lose this job.
“Ah yes, sorry, I remember you, of course. You…” You look good, Harry wanted to say. But, he didn’t want the other to start taking a good look at himself too and see that Harry looked like hell now. “You used to wear those big glasses before, so I didn’t recognize you at first.”
That meant that he would finally be able to meet his soulmate. He could not wait to be asleep, he was so excited. He had barely slept the night before, in hope that he would fall fast asleep the next day, but he felt like he was never going to sleep again. He felt too anxious but also eager to finally meet the person he would share his life with.
When will you learn how to reply to my calls? I need you to buy a cake for me before coming home. You know which one. I've made some lasagna, but I crave sugar. I want a cake, Harry.
Exhale.
“Er, I’m not sure?”
cake.
He really, really hoped that the latter had already turned eighteen because he could not wait anymore. Soulmates could only meet in their dreams when both of them had turned eighteen. He was going to feel so disappointed if nothing would happen this night. He was not even going to think about it.
“Er…Hi.”
He just did.
Now that Harry really looked at Draco, he had really changed. He looked tall, confident, he held his head high and wasn’t hiding behind layers of old clothes anymore, on the contrary, he looked really fashionable, like a model. He didn’t seem like the same person at all. He looked like how Harry was like in high school, handsome, confident, popular.
It was one hour later that his breathing finally evened out.
"Potter.
There was no use, his heart was beating really fast. It felt like it was going to jump out of his chest. He tossed around in his bed, feeling anxious, almost all night. He looked at his phone again.
He cried himself to sleep.
Today was a bad day.
Since he was little, he had always waited for his own soulmate to appear after he had learned that his parents were soulmates. He had felt so amazed that they had meet in their dreams. It felt so surreal and magical, all he wanted since then was to experience it too. His parents were still together and very much in love today. They told Harry that, every year, on his dad's birthday, they could see each other in their dreams, for that was in that day that they met for the first time. Harry wanted that connection too. He wanted to have a special person he could cherish and love for as long as possible. He wanted what his parents had.
“But…But it was your dream.” Draco said softly while looking at Harry with big eyes. “You told me you had always wanted to become one, like your dad, that your goal in life was to stand up for people, for the oppressed, that you wanted to help everyone that was in need…” He stopped talking and bit his lips as he frowned. Harry just shrugged nonchalantly. The Harry Draco was describing was dead, he was just a memory, a Harry from the past that no longer existed. A greater version of the Harry that was now. It was nice to hear that he still existed in other people’s memory, instead of the Harry from now, who had neither dreams, nor future. No life in his eyes.
“Oh, you remember that? Actually, I…dropped out two years ago.” Harry said as he looked at his hands in shame. He didn’t want to remember that painful time.
Goodbye."
"Harry." He said. He did not know if the other was joking or not, but he felt really good about wearing his Gryffindor pyjamas. Technically, they belonged to his father, but it was Harry who mainly wear them these days. It was not like his father could still wear them as he had taken some weight since he went to Hogwarts.
"Yes..."
Also, I hate you."
really have to go? Don't you think it will be better to spend Christmas just the two of us? Oh, how romantic it will be! Think about it, Harry. We'll have dinner together, there will be candles, Harry, there will be snow and I'll put on some music. We'll dance together and we will be able to touch and kiss each other however we want, as there will be, I repeat,
"Hello Potter, this is Malfoy.
"Hello Potter, this is Malfoy.
"Hello Potter, this is Malfoy.
He was at the coffee shop, working, ready to take the next customer’s order when the latter called him by his name.
. Before Harry's mind went to some very wanted places, he hugged the other very quickly.
I forgot to tell you to come pick up your order, but I guess you have guessed that was the reason I called. Seriously though, good job Potter, my mind is finally at ease, I will never be afraid to call you again."
I am sorry I ran away. Please pick up your phone...?"
He didn’t remember how his depression started. It just did, it came at him like a storm that never left. There were good days, but mostly, there were bad days. His brain was not as good as it was before, it became slow and fuzzy, filled with dark and uncooperative thoughts. He remembered being a smooth talker in high school, he was the school’s most popular student, everyone loved him and he had basked in the attention. Now, he was scared that someone would try to talk to him, he had forgotten how to make small talk, he was afraid of phone calls and anxious to have to interact with customers at work. Before, he was full of wits, now he never knew what to say during a conversation.
—Harry POV—
"Yes... I just forgot today... and a few days earlier... why am I telling you this?"
"I ruined my son's life before he was even born. I failed as a father before I knew if I would even live to see the day." I closed my eyes, fighting back my own drops of liquid grief.
"Oh shut it Potter, at least I don't burn my skin off with the water."
"The universe is against me," I found myself saying. "Nothing is going to get better, nothing is going to change."
"Listen," said Uncle Harry. "You are going to board the train, and you'll get in a compartment that isn't empty. You'll make some friends. Okay?" I nodded, swallowing the persisting lump in my throat.
I looked up at Potter and his friends.
"Because I pay attention around this school. Honestly, it's not that hard." He glanced at Bonnie, whose face was slightly red.
Enjoy!
"I understand that you may not be ready to talk about it. Things like that can take time to process." She explained. "You won't have to worry about telling me until we're ready to talk about it more." I swallowed, feeling a slight relief come over me.
"Dada..." I swallowed and sniffled. "What about Maria?" Dada's face turned white, and I noticed his eyes widened for just a bit.
"I didn't really have any friends at the time. Even Ron was mad at me."
"I just don't understand, Draco. I mean, yes, you bullied me but I stood up to you no problem and you would back off and you- you just weren't- I- you changed... you changed you aren't the same Draco Malfoy from school. Dudley isn't even the same anymore, and I doubt he still has the same friends." I shuddered remembering Christmas. "I mean, at least he doesn't treat me like a total git every second he gets, but still."
something was wrong. "Let's go get ourselves dressed. It's a big day, isn't it?" He stood there for half a second, looking at me through furrowed brows, the gears in his head turning. From the distance I head the cat meowing, wanting to get let out of her cage. I walked back towards him quickly, resting my hands on his shoulders and giving him a small kiss.
"Nothing." I absentmindedly shifted backwards,
"Thanks. It helped." With my hand, I eased his face out of the nook it was hiding in, and gave him a kiss on the nose. He wrinkled it, failing to hold back a smile, and tried to hide his face in the crook of my neck again.
"Are you insane? The more time we spend the more time he could be doing Merlin knows what-" I stated sharply, forcing my tiredness away.
"Fancy? That's anything but fancy. You want me to show you fancy?" I got away from the window, towards my closet. "I can grab my dress robes, my Muggle tuxedos too-"
"It is!! There's blood everywhere!" He cried.
erasing
We rested our foreheads on each other's. I closed my eyes.
"I'd listen if I were you. You don't know what I'm capable of." Draco warned. I trembled. And Uncle Vernon's grip faltered, his expression surprised. Yet, he didn't let go.
A few minutes after Draco fell asleep, I gave him another kiss on the temple, before leaving the room, being sure to close the door softly so as to not disturb him. Now, I need to deal with Scorpius- Draco's most recent hip attachment.
"Nothing, Harry?
son... write to Hermione. She probably hates you less than anyone else there."
"Hermione, Hermione! Come quick!"
"I'm a bit scared, Harry... I don't want anything to happen to you, and I don't want anything to happen to Scorpius- or Teddy for that matter- and I know it feels like a lot, what's happening right now, but-" My throat began to close up. Harry stayed with me, his glance not wavering once. Dr. Gilroy sat and watched silently. "It
Did I do something wrong? Is he avoiding me for his own self-destructive tendencies? Is there something else at play here? I wouldn't know.
"He's curious-"
"I'll see you guys later."
"Ah. And you didn't come to me after the first time?" Kingsley eyed me and Harry. I gripped his hand tightly from beside me.
My basement. I brought things with me from the Wizarding World. I must have some Pepperup in there. I
I felt Draco bring his hand back to my chest, pressing gently.
He whipped his head towards me "I'm fine-"
I thought, but kept it to myself, not wanting to worry about how many ways saying that could go wrong.
—Draco POV—
The tree burst into dust, and started floating down to the snowy white ground. I kicked up the small pile in frustration. I took a deep breath, slowing myself down. I closed my eyes, and allowed myself to feel my surroundings.
, was fitting for those who chose to die in duels with their wands in their hands.
“Who will he be replacing?” Sirius pondered, he knew there were a few dark magic using professors for certain in Hogwarts, such as Slughorn and Vector. If there were others, they were much more adept at keeping it a secret from even the dark students.

“It’s the walls, all of them.” Luna hummed in answer as she tapped her fingers against the stones she could reach, reading the letters that had been carved there aloud. “N.F., L.A.M, B.B., R.A.B, S.O.B, A.B., N.B…. S, hmm this looks scratched out, I can make out an S, but it’s been written over with a P.”
Here is the warning for this chapter, there is very light punishment of a child and implied past punishment of a child. For me I don't see this as a serious matter, but I thought I would give a heads up anyway for anyone that has sensitivity towards the matter.
“Algo así.” Peter was pretty sure by Earth definitions, Draco could be considered a one man army. He didn’t quite eat as much though, but Peter wanted to make sure that he didn’t have a hungry Jotun on his hands. After all, if Peter got horribly moody when his stomach was empty, he didn’t want to know how Draco would act.
Sirius answered, jerking to get free, but the werewolf’s next words had him freezing.
Hermione serves to show how Muggleborn views continued to erode and demonize ancient and sacred traditions of the dark. The light side used the excuse of pandering to Muggleborns to eliminate and target the Dark ways as well. Hermione will learn and develop, but she gives an outside viewpoint compared to Harry, Neville, or Ron's.
While Sirius had been his old tormentor for seven long years of his life, the past fourteen had found them both in very different places.
Remus Lupin, wane, tired, and sickly with the scars across his face shining more red than they were now. Fresher.
Still, Harry pressed on, “I thought you would be happy! Me not getting caught up in all of this drama and pettiness. I kept my focus on things that mattered: studying, practicing, Quidditch, keeping relationships with those that will amount to something in a few years!”
“That’s putting it lightly,” Remus muttered. He had sent his own patronus out towards the carriages like many of the other members of the staff, however he had kept the spectral wolf to the edges of the forest, almost completely out of sight in case someone might link the form with lycanthropy. It was dangerous, now more than ever with Umbridge sniffing around for anything that the Ministry could use against Dumbledore and his supporters. The paranoia they held that the old wizard wished to take up the position of Minister was ridiculous when it was clear he had no desire to.
"Harry I don't even know where I would be taking you! And in the dead of night?! Somewhere I know is crawling with Death Eaters?! No!"
" Hmpf?" ...I assumed he was trying to say my name. I lightly chuckled and kept pointing to my cheek. He tried to get the speck of his face many times with a napkin, still not having swallowed the food. I couldn't help but laugh between each attempt, and Harry couldn't either. Which almost made him choke on his food.
"What about Finish The Story?" piped up one boy. I turned over curiously, meeting eyes with a boy who had striking red hair and blue eyes, who looked a lot like most of the other people here. He didn't have freckles, though, like the other red-haired people here, and he looked younger than me. Did I used to be that short? "I love that  game." He commented more to himself. "What's your name? How come I've never seen you before?" He was speaking so fast that I felt like a hurricane had hit me.
"It's nothing," he said, putting his fork down. "I think I'm done with breakfast. Thank you though." He said, standing from the table. I sighed. He's definitely forgotten something important if he stopped eating after realizing and not telling me.
"These idiots don't know how to shut up. The only letter worth reading is this one. From Teddy." He told me. I opened it, not really minding the contents, before tossing it aside, staying in my grumpy position with my legs still drawn to my chest. Draco sat back down.
The room went silent for a minute, and I kind of felt bad. My mood really had turned since this whole thing came back up.
"They're idiots who can think what they want, Harry."
wrong. Everything about your reasoning is wrong, Harry! You cannot deny yourself the necessities to live just because you feel you aren't worthy!" His expression, as well as his grip, softened greatly. "Nobody is so awful that they don't deserve to live- especially not you."
The rest of class passed without any sort of interruption. Professor Vector, while only a smidge more upbeat than Binns, droned on about the significance of numbers and what your birth date means. Victorie was eagerly showing me each of her results, to which I could only nod and smile. I tried showing mine, but got interrupted several times with claims from Victorie that I had calculated them wrong, or "That's not what they mean!"
"They never went that far." I said, nose thoroughly stuffed, tears desperately clinging to the bottom of my chin. The outside of my body felt numb, but inside couldn't feel more turbulent.
"Why... out of all people... did he-" she couldn't finish her sentence, but I knew exactly what she was asking.
"You promised you would talk to me, Harry... twenty fresh cuts? Six of them from last night... you should have gone to me." He said, frustration seeping through the cracks of his disheveled appearance.
As soon as the words left my mouth, I had a lingering feeling that I shouldn't have asked, but I didn't follow my question, leaving me and Draco in a silence that was odd in nature. Neither of us could say anything, but something
"How's Scorpius?" He said after a brief silence.
"You seem cheery," I commented, snaking my arms around his waist and leaning towards him, resting my chin on his shoulder.
"Malfoy," he practically sneered.
"Scorpius nor I are any danger to ourselves, Harry-"
"The only thing I'm depriving him of is your manipulation and your warped views," I whispered, keeping my voice steady and my gaze at the floor.
I furrowed my brows in confusion while looking at Hermione. A few seconds later, I felt a prod at my waist from Draco, who gestured to the center of the table. Just then, a few delicious-looking dishes were lowered onto the table: yule logs, berry trifles, and mince pies. I whipped my head around at Draco in realization, who held back the urge to laugh. I lightly kicked him under the table, holding back my own chuckle and feeling my face go a bit red.
—Harry POV—
"Yes." I said, trying to continue my page.
We walked out the back door, into the quiet, cold night. I wrapped my arm around his waist as we walked, and he did the same.
"Sure. Then afterwards, I was hoping to surprise you by organizing a play date with Scorpius."
"Help me get her inside." I told Harry, who put his wand in his pocket, moving to help me lift her from the door to my couch. I closed the front door, still feeling shocked.
"You saved us, in the manor. And you didn't kill Dumbledore-"
"We'll work through it together. I'll stop that pesky mind of yours from thinking what it does long enough for you to get something in." He said, concern written across his face. "Don't worry about Ron and Hermione. I'll tell them to come later in the day. Right now, you need rest." I felt his lips land upon my temple briefly, before a rush of cool air and the quiet sound of the door being eased shut notified me that he was indeed gone from the room. And while I kept telling myself
"Where... Where is Scorpius? My son? Where is he?!" I said through gritted teeth.
"Ah... Finally, someone who knows at least a little bit," he replied, chuckling to himself, everyone joining in an awkward laugh. "I have a feeling you'll do just fine in your classes."
His eyes lit up, and somehow I just now remembered that he had moved in from America.
"Oh, yes! He's also older-"
I shook my head, pushing away thoughts of the past I'd much rather forget.
I looked at her, feeling at ease. Christmas really
"Why am I...? Because he rarely behaves like this! The bugger stole my wand!
"Okay, I will. Thank you."
"I'm going to read a book and get some tea."
I mumbled a quick "Yeah."
"Harry?" He nodded.
"No," he whined. "I want to hug you."
"Happy Christmas. I'm leaving." Said Harry, I turned to him, and as he spoke my name, In a flash, Vernon stood up, made his way around the table, and grabbed him by the wrist. I heard Harry's voice, low, and wavering, as he tried to free himself without causing more of a scene. His face paled, and at that moment I knew that I had to step in. Pulling out my wand with a determined face, I aimed straight at Vernon.
"Here, I had some stored. It should help the headache." I blinked up at Draco, eying the small vial in his hand, the light blue, thin liquid sloshing about. He uncorked it for me, bringing the cold glass to my lips. My hand joined his in tipping the potion back, and I closed my eyes again, waiting for it to take affect.
"How about some things you can hear?" He asked.
"Only trying?" I said in disbelief. I then sat down beside him, realizing I may have unintentionally sounded accusing and just a bit harsh.
"It was more than just Maria. Somebody wrote books about us and our magic. It's too dangerous for us to live with Muggles anymore. We can't tell
I didn't have any more time to contemplate what I had done, or the possible consequences of being so dense. Today was the Welcoming Ceremony for the other schools participating in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. I was mildly surprised upon hearing there were other schools coming, but then again, it wouldn't be called the Tri-Wizard Tournament otherwise. I promptly gave myself a small smack on the back of my neck. We had already returned our school materials to our dormitories. I passed Wendy, who was comforting a slightly sulking Bonnie, who had just found out about the age constraints on the Goblet.
"What was that about?" I asked curiously as I watched Scorpius cut strawberries. "Very careful, please."
"He's downstairs. I told him we ought to make breakfast soon." He said, closing the door behind us. I took a sip of water from the glass on his nightstand, then crawled into the bed, curling up under the covers, and Draco followed after me.
I stopped hugging him, separating us so I could see him clearly.
"How'd you know that?" Me and Wendy asked, with Gabriel soon going "Yeah!" behind us.
"Wait really? What about Teddy?"
"Yeah but you and I both know this isn't me 'just getting sick.' I'm sorry." He stated stubbornly. I huffed.
I leaned over and scooped Teddy into a tight hug, not wanting to ever let go. Fresh tears threatened to fall from my eyes and my voice wavered. "I love you like a son, Teddy. You're like my son. And every day I regret not being better to you. You deserve the world."
“Should have known that you’d be into the sweet shit, Thor’s addicted to pop-tarts for crying out loud.” Stark muttered, under his breath and turned his back on Loki to pluck a few different bottles from the cabinet, along with two more empty glasses that he pulled out of what appeared to be a freezer. This drink-ware was different in design from the simple cube shape Loki was partaking from. A circular bottom plate of glass leading up into a short stem and expanding out again into a rectangular flute.
It wasn’t from a Swedish Short-Snout as their scales were a more silvery blue, the same color as the powerful flame they were known to produce. A fire that was hot enough to reduce anything to ashes in seconds. There were Swedish Short-Snout scales in Harry and Sirius’ wardrobes as it was a common material for making protective gloves, vests, and cloaks used for dueling. There wasn’t any blue tone to the scaly charm so it wasn’t a match.
Harry let out a choked sound that now had Draco’s head snapping towards him with obvious alarm.
“A handful of decades’ time would not be remiss.” Loki countered, but it was without conviction. Already, the trickster knew that this particular battle of logic and wills was lost to him.
Nothing took away the pain of the transformation to and from the werewolf every month, neither potion nor companion.
I'm still kind of in limbo, but safe. Depression has kicked up, a major reason I think is reverse culture shock, I'm working through it though.
This time it was for the potion master’s position. Potion masters were in short supply as it normally took years of research and countless galleons for one to achieve the title through apprenticeship. The pool was so small that Dumbledore struggled to find someone to replace the ones that left after a single year or two of teaching at the school.
That was the first thought that went through Draco’s mind when he heard the news. The dark haired boy had been talking almost nonstop the past few days about the future match and his excitement about being able to see it first hand. Was he one of the victims? Had he been injured or even killed either in cold blood or by accident? Draco knew from the memories he had witnessed that panic bred a chaos that could kill many in unintended ways.
Ya, pa’ fuera. Sálganse de aquí, mocosos. Con cuidado on your way home. =out ya go/get. Get out of here, snot nosed brats. Take care on your way home.
His wand, it was humming pleasantly in his hand, as if it too was happy for the release of the excess. A glance at the water in the goblet showed that it was swirling in a counterclockwise direction though his hand did not move it. The flames that tipped the candle had changed from familiar orange and yellow, to purple which echoed the will o wisp balls of fire that drifted in the clearing around them.
Harry knew who came from what prominent family, could pick out students that actually had a brain in their skulls. Those were the people that Harry gave notice of… As long as they weren’t wearing green, his mind supplied, making him grimace. There was also the fact that any free time both with and without his friends was used to study what he could of the Dark.
Sirius hid his grin behind his mug before speaking, tone innocent though he was anything but. Sirius loved to complain.
“I thought it was an open invitation to everyone,” the meek, young sounding voice had Harry’s attention pulled back to the scene before him. The speaker was short, probably a firstie with a little green patch on his left breast. He was standing in front of similarly dressed underclassmen.
It was only after the incident that had almost led to the death of another student that Sirius realized that he couldn’t ignore the truth.
Draco had found faults with them all and Peter’s enthusiasm was whittled away bit by bit as Happy drove them to and fro. The bodyguard/chauffeur seemed to be taking the prince’s whines and barbs in stride, he had been a long time friend of Tony Stark so he was used to the dramatics and cutting, snide remarks.
. Professor Binns might not have ever noticed your presence in the classroom when we were students, but I certainly did.” She was stacking books as the poltergeist threw a fit behind her, the bells on the top of his hat jingling and causing quite the racket.
The silence was much more relaxed after that and Harry felt like he might even fall back asleep as exhaustion sunk its claws back into him. Finally he rolled onto his side after his nose started hurt, as he did however he choked on a cry as he discovered a shadow leaning over his bed.
“Shit… just, what the hell?” Ron wasn’t really asking Harry as he limped up beside him, more like the ginger was addressing the world at large.
Dead.
“Nothing you’d be interested in, surely, Harry. Since we’d had this almost exact conversation at the beginning of the damn year!” Sirius had hoped, desperately he had, that something had gotten through the thick Potter skull that night months ago.
The men before him, there was something unnamed about them that made them seem to stand larger than life. Both were looking at Draco with varying degrees of shock. While there was that tingling feeling of connection with the dark haired one, the burlier blond made something inside of Draco scream that he was a threat.
Mrs. Weasley was sure to panic once she realized that Harry was not among her brood jostling through the throngs of students and parents. It was Ron’s job to convince Molly that Harry had gone to the Longbottom’s estate for something and would floo over in time for dinner.
For Malfoy Manor, it seemed so many things only time could tell.
“Petunia Durnly? Petunia Dritzy?” Hermione repeated with a frown, getting a shake of the head from her friend.
charms on the adder that Harry recast regularly not wanting anyone to discover his scaly friend. No one would be expected to react rationally at the sight of a venomous snake slithering about their house and Harry didn’t want to take any risks of being overheard by the portraits so he only spoke parseltongue while in the safety of his room or on the grounds far from the mansion.
Both of them had lost their parents and their sense of normalcy, they healed slowly and grew closer. Many a night, would find the two of them sitting silently in the parlor together. Not speaking as they wrapped themselves in furs and blankets as the fire crackled, just comforted by the presence of another. Severus
He didn’t have time to deal with their strangeness, instead he pocketed the well before rushing his own way. As he took the steps two at a time, Harry finally was able to place who the kid was. Malcolm Baddock: not really notable other than the fact that at the Sorting Ceremony, his arrival at the Slytherin table was met with applause, but Fred and George Weasley hissed at him.
down, Draco taught him two more spells. One was the
He knew what Draco meant, that he needed to listen as he did when casting. To remain connected to the natural world around them  and have it work with them rather than against them or disregarding it. Those had been Draco’s words a year ago, still Harry was disappointed that he still could not hear magic like the blond claimed to.
Notes:
While Remus was fooled, Sirius knew that Harry was diverting. There was little hope for the boy to use that trick against his godfather, Sirius was the master of it after all his years skillfully keeping suspicion off of himself. No, Harry’s thoughts were not wrapped around something as mundane as a birthday present. There was something more and from how twitchy Harry was now becoming under his gaze, Sirius knew whatever it was had to be very significant to him.
The corpses, screams, cries, and blood were the fruits of the labor that the Deatheaters wrought. Many of them also meeting their own ends. Draco could only wonder at the carnage...
Lunch continued, and Harry saw from the corner of his eye a group of first year Gryffindor girls sitting on the bench. Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil, Eloise Midgen, and Fay Dunbar were giggling and gossiping together. They were so loud that Harry and his friends couldn’t help but to overhear their conversation.
Given how many students appear to go to Hogwarts and that most wizarding families have 1 or 2 children, with very few exceptions. Also that there are families that have died out or people who have no children. Even accounting for Muggle-borns, it still wouldn’t be many.
to clean the blood away.
“Oh, yes.” Remus laughed as he took a biscuit from the tray that had appeared between them. “He sent a copy of every book he ever wrote to Sirius and sent letter after letter harassing him with
That wasn’t to say that there weren’t dangers that Draco had to look out for. Red Caps would gleefully try to bash his head into a bloody glop as they would any other person. The bloodthirsty dwarfish beasts were a threat to anything that moved and voracious in appetite.
However, the next person was shoved forward to take her place and change the boggart once more. It was then that Harry realized as the laughter died down… he was before the non-being. Remus’ amber colored eyes were wide as he took a few steps forward, “Harry, wait, perhaps it’s best that you-”
Chara meaning: an Irish term for ‘friend’
“I… was flying.”
“I wish to sit.”
The magic that was tying Sirius to the secret through the dark charm,
Loki hummed, tipping his head slightly to the side as he examined the child in Thor’s hands.
“Umm, are we not all takin’ ‘em off?”
What Walburga was about to say to Hermione all those years ago before she had been cut off by Sirius.
“Indeed, it seems that Lord Black did what any able citizen would do, but a,” Fudge admitted while he fumbled with his own summoned memo parchment, the information he was looking for appearing on it before continuing, “a young Mr. Dean Thomas received rather horrific injuries, was almost upon death’s front stoop even when he arrived at Saint Mungo’s.”
“Nothing.” Harry’s answer was too quick, having obviously waited for that very question. Remus stared at Harry, stern frown marring his features. Harry pushed his eggs around his plate, painting the china a bright yellow from the broken yolk.
, the hat not to put him in the serpent den? Harry wasn’t interested in fame or greatness, but still it felt like he had committed some great sin, telling the hat where to place him instead of letting it reach a decision naturally.
“You’re part of a coven already?” Winger spoke, not quite a guess.
Two heads of houses leaving would be quite the blow, but it seemed that the coven was gaining the basis for creating their own school. A little less than a fourth of the student population would also vanish.
“Before we continue, I believe some assurance is needed,” Willa Marsh, a sixth-year and the only girl in the group. She was the Seeker on the team and her sharp blue eyes seemed to always be darting about for something to zero in on. Looking for possible prey or threats. Her long copper colored hair pulled back into a high bun at the back of her head.
“I don’t believe I follow.”
, only family members can teach it to each other or to people they trust. If a person not part of the original family tries to teach or explain the spell to another person they will find themselves unable to do so physically. Draco is breaking the rules, he doesn’t trust Harry, but he is desperate to keep a line of communication between them in the case of emergencies. Harry doesn’t know about family spells yet. This situation is alluding to another spell in this work that has played a hand in Draco’s initial trust in Harry.
As soon as Loki had stepped through the threshold of the bookstore, he had felt something… odd.
The hood was pulled up over his son’s head and a short hug given before Lucius popped away, leaving Draco to begin his own journey on foot.
Still, Remus and Sirius felt they had been rather successful in their raising of Harry so far. There had been plenty of bumps in the road, but they had all survived mostly unscathed. Dumbledore had become a grandfather figure to Harry and offered help whenever asked. Minerva was also a regular guest in the house as she gushed over the vibrant little boy that was birthed from two of her favorite students. Molly and Arthur Weasley provided advice, and in Sirius’ opinion too much of it. His grumbles were quieted by the wonderful food that Molly always made. The red haired couple’s second youngest child was the same age as Harry and became the third member of Harry’s trio.
Sirius flinched, but Remus pressed on, “You swore, swore that you wouldn’t hide things from me. You made that oath when we were kids in these very halls, broke it. Made it once again when you finally told me what runs through you.”
The twins were grinning from ear to ear as they sang while throwing an arm over each of their older brother’s shoulder. “Percy, oh Percy, the next Lord Prewett. Let’s hope he doesn’t stew it!”
mention of mpreg in discussion
“Enough!” Sirius barked, loud enough that both wizards swore that they could feel the word rattle their bones. Sirius was breathing hard, his eyes tinting away from the familiar grey to have flecks the color of a full harvest moon.
Hogwarts served as a home for around one thousand students every year. The true number of Dark students according to Derrick was only around one hundred and thirty-five, but it was still staggering. Thirty-seven of that number included the entirety of the Slytherin house. The war, Flight of the Murder, and resulting stigmitization had resulted in the snakes’ abismal population. There was an average of two hundred and fifty students in each of the other houses.

“Not for lack of trying.” Tony grumbled. Apparently he was sore that his technology wasn’t the answer for their current problem.
Draco gestured to the fact that there were a few dead patches of grass that Harry had not noticed before. “It is not a spell to be used unless absolutely necessary. Magic exist all around us, to remove it creates fractures in the natural world. If done in the presence of creatures with weak or short life cycles, it might result in their death as a small amount of magic might accidentally be pushed out of their own forms.”
to check the time, but might come off a little too rude as Draco searched for something suitable to exchange.
That was the conclusion that Draco drew as the impromptu tour of New York progressed. While Draco made an effort to not prove that Loki was a liar, though he was a proven one, Draco’s behavior while not violent or causing destruction was difficult and unnecessary.
I hope it came across clearly that Harry is not so angry about Sirius being
If the children had turned on Sirius, they would not have been able to escape these chambers. Had Sirius the “misfortune” of expiring, this would have become their crypt.
“Th-There’s something out there.” Neville had pulled out his wand, the others copying him with uncertain expressions.
Draco stared at his reflection shocked at the stranger staring back at him.
What do you think will be happening in the next chapter and school year for Harry, I'll say that this is the year things begin to unravel.
One which was not truly foreseen by either Slytherin. It was the hastening to the absolute disintegration of Lily and Severus’ relationship once Severus returned from the hols. She had felt betrayed by Severus not coming to tell her what had happened or reaching out while he was dealing with the chaos that winter had thrown at him. Lily made it very clear what she thought of Malfoy and his ilk, tried to convince Severus to find someone else to live with. Offered her own home, the Evans’ had extended their welcome, but Severus did not wish to abandon Lucius or snub his efforts to help him.
Harry had missed Dumbledore’s speech after the attack, as that was all Harry could label it, having instead laid in Sirius’ quarters to confront him with his library findings. Still, Harry could tell that his friends were cycling the words that the headmaster had spoken through their heads whenever the conversation drifted towards school.
Sirius wondered how arrogant and prideful his ancestors must have been to name so many of their land holdings with hints to their darkest secrets.
This young grasshopper was still struggling.
(See the end of the chapter for
Though they reverted the instant a small, uncoordinated hand smacked Sirius in the face the other hand giving a yank to the long wavy locks. “Ow.”
“Do what I do, hold the swizzle stick between your hands. Yeah, like that, now rub your hands to make the stick spin and it’ll stir your drink.”
Eloise had a fearsome smile on her face as she said in a tone that was probably meant to be a whisper, but she didn’t know how to lower her volume, “She probably ran out of space for the word in that head of her’s. Maybe she replaced it with some complicated word that no one has used in the past century.”
Each chapter of this story is ending up around 18 to 20 to even 30 pages so I hope you enjoy my hard work!
“They’re all on that trip to that dragon reservation where Charlie is going to do his internship.” Remus frowned, contemplating who they could ask.
we encounter in our day to day? I’m sure we were all taught to respect others at some point, I’d imagine we can all agree that harming another living being can be rather easily avoided.”
To any passing listener, they would have been appalled at the content of the conversation, but to the three men this was all common and accepted knowledge.
“Oh sod off, I’ve had a very long night. Saying it aloud just helps.” Sirius snapped back, keeping his voice soft with a sleeping child between them.
“I have been called worse, I shall see you when we break the morning fast.”
But Black did not flinch, it figured that Prince would turn out to be part vampire of all creatures.
No matter, Loki had something far more interesting than both his brother’s antics and the numerous books around him to examine.
Carefully, silently, they picked their way back to their friends. Seamus and Cedric were glancing up towards the branches above them in confusion as the green light from the mark managed to filter down past a few of the leaves. They looked at the returning pair questioningly, but looked relieved to see Remus behind them.
Harry swallowed, but didn’t answer just nodded slightly to show he understood.
“Soooo, Hagrid’s an interestin’ chap.” Ron finally ventured as they started up the long winding path back to the castle.
“Very well, what house do you belong to at Hogwarts?” There was curiosity in Draco’s voice and also… perhaps scorn. Harry didn’t doubt that the blond felt bitter about not being able to attend the school like the rest of the magical population did over a decade ago.
“Reggie, I-“
This song, Harry realized, was a story. It was a telling of how the dark magic users feared discovery and only found solace in... Draco’s song answered him as he straightened back up gracefully, “In the dead of night strange things happen. In the dead of night the world goes cold. When the lights go out all around, whispers fill the air. In the dead of night, better hold on tight.”
, before setting to work transfiguring the pieces into quill grips and tips which he then fit the two feathers into.
Ginny looked like she had no advice to offer either and the twins were uncharacteristically without smiles, despite the sight of their youngest brother being told off. Lee Jordan sighed as he shouldered his bag and started to leave the table, “You lot really are hopeless, ain’t ya? She’s scared.”
“Indeed. Stark is allowed as this is his abode. Dr. Banner is as well, as my brother and I owe him a great deal.” Loki answered calmly, raking his gaze up and down the teenager before sighing and flicking two fingers towards him. Peter jumped as a stream of white light engulfed him for a brief moment before fading.
“The Thestrals can only be seen by those who have witnessed death.” Draco continued as he delicately wove his fingers through the headmare’s mane, Hrímfaxi if Harry was remembering her name right. The next question was softer, not a demand like the so many inquiries before. “Who did you see?”
I've really come to realize how important fanfic has become to so many people, both for readers and writers alike. It gives us all a bit of purpose, something to dislodge us from the troubles we currently have. Friendships and creativity inspired by the love of characters and imagination.
Since that day, Sirius had been overseeing Remus’ practice of small, simple dark spells every other night to slowly build up his body’s reserves and grow used to the new form of energy he wielded.
Taking his wand, he poked it and watched as it leaped once more before unfolding itself:
“It was a rather recent decision, but I think he’ll do either line proud, don’t you?” Arthur added, eyes fond though he held himself for the first time as he should as Lord Weasley as he turned back towards Crouch.
“Looks like you started without us. Rude to not wait for
She leaned down, voice dipping to a whisper,
“I told you that I had a way of keeping you in my thoughts while I was away at Hogwarts.” Remus answered, a small grin playing across his lips as he continued to thread his fingers through the thick wavy locks that graced the head that laid in his lap.
There were numerous places for Sirius to hide his thoughts and memories in such a vast and confusing landscape. They could be sequestered away inside of acorns scattered both in the trees and the ground. Locked behind the thick bark of trees that could possibly take a swing at you with their branches. Hidden in the burrows of mice or other animals. Perhaps they were disguised as pebbles in a trickling stream.
“I know, Padfoot.” Harry chimed innocently, Sirius was cursing the fact that he had decided to teach the boy
“He will need to learn how to not only control the ice, but understand when he needs to express it. Too long a wait and it will slowly freeze him from the inside out.” Loki did not intend to let this happen, now nor ever. Getting Draco to accept his new lot, it would be a long battle and he doubted that the child would feel gratefulness for a while yet.
“I’m recovering, sir. My friends and others suffered more than I did,” Harry answered, giving no more or less than he was required while being polite, just as Sirius and Andromeda had taught him to.
“Now imagine all the pureblood and wealthy families who are fleeing with us, their pastures, greenhouses, homes, and land will all be put under
No, right? The world was grey, that was what Remus had said. Things were not simply black and white, that was what Remus had said so many months ago. Just because Harry was a parselmouth, that didn’t mean he was dark or evil. It didn’t mean that he was going to become them, either. Certainly his family and friends would stop him long before he descended down such a path if not himself.
Peter’s brows furrowed as he shook his head, “No, they gave us the statue.”
. Now though, the man looked like he was ready to piss himself as Sirius took one slow step towards him.
“Out, quick, out of the damned tent!” Sirius’ voice was sharp and quick as he motioned the group to move. It was with a controlled scramble that the others followed the orders, entering into what was rapidly dissolving into chaos and perhaps hell as bright, hot flames licked their way towards the sky. The fire feeding on both dry grass, wood, and the fabric of tents and flags to spread steadily closer to where they stood.
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
Wormtail.
“My apologies, mother is a little… eccentric at times. However, Miss Granger, I believe that you are just as at fault.” Sirius’s anger was raw and though his voice was calm there was a tension to it that made his spine rigid. “You come to my home and your words have been incredibly insulting.”
“Well?” Sirius prompted again, one fine, dark brow raising as he waited for an answer.
A modern translation would be: It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night, but it’s easier to hear well.
Zacharias Smith, Harry wanted to hex across the tables. The blond had a traumatized look upon his face, but there was mirth shining in his eyes whenever he peeked through his fingers as his others laid comforting hands upon him. Thing was, Tonks had told Harry that the Smiths had reportedly portkeyed home before the attack even started.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. Potter.” Umbridge corrected with her pouchy eyes on him, still a smile upon her face. “You are right, however, to assume as much.”
Silence answered her and she huffed as she reached over to smack him on the arm with the thick book she had been holding, “Harry James Potter-Black, you should be
The way the dark saw the world and magic was just so… different.
“Honestly,” Hermione grumbled as she used the heavy tome in her hands to swat the two redheads on the arms, “Your pranks require more brain power, research, and planning than most of our essays! It’s wasted potential.”
“Can we please refocus, yes, we are all special lords, now let’s move on to the matter at hand,” Regulus hissed, obviously fed up with the pissing contest that had been going on between the two older males since they had first met. Sirius looked belligerent, but fell silent. Severus also quieted, though he shoved the book he was holding into the trunk with unnecessary strength and noise to show his displeasure at his rare chance for gloating being interrupted.
In her own home, a place where she truly had all the knowledge and gave her the space to address things away from the views of those from the magical world. She could at last address the things she learned and make her own decisions. Her experience among Muggles giving her a close up look at human against human discrimination. Hermione tried to harness all the Gryffindor bravery inside her to speak, “What if
We'd be happy to answer any questions!
As they settled into the parlor, Severus and Regulus sitting on one couch and Sirius, having taken back Harry, sat on one across from them. Regulus had a petulant expression on his face, arms crossing in a way that neither of the older males had seen in years. Apparently, the frustration and lack of progress in the past two hours had finally worn down his tact and poise. “I don’t see what there is to talk about, we just take the boy with us.”
“Is that…?”
“That’s why they were gunning after Dean so hard,” Seamus gritted out through his teeth, shoulders still shaking as he continued, “They thought he was a Muggleborn. Actin’ and dressed as he was.”
rather than an ally. Both of which will never be you, Smith. I’ll be more than happy to be rid of the title that comes from something I don’t even remember. When it's gone? I’ll be the boy who can go to Diagon Alley without being swarmed for autographs! Have you ever been asked for an autograph?”
“I’ve been known to, specially if money's involved and the only thing getting hurt is the delicate sensibilities of people who forget they’re not on top of the food chain.” Tony answered flippantly, which Loki seemed to approve of if the sharp smile he got was any clue. They drank in silence for a few minutes, Tony marveling at the surreal moment. Loki wasn’t an enemy any longer, hadn’t been for years, but this was the first time the God of Mischief had spent in any of the Avengers’ company of his own free will without Thor’s presence.
“Yeah, yeah, hold your horses. This’ll knock your socks off.” Came the answer as Tony took two glasses from the cabinet. With the cap off, the scent of the bourbon made Tony sigh in pleasure. Then he poured them each three fingers of the liquor, looked up at the other man and proceeded to pour them both two more. Tony had always had a high tolerance, but whatever the Infinity Stones had done to his biology had upped that even more.
him and Ron to St. Mungo’s?” Remus deduced getting a short nod in answer. Ron tried to argue that he didn’t need to go, that it was something minor, but it was silenced with a look from his mum. Quickly, Remus gathered the teenagers together, including the additional Hufflepuff, “Diggory, I think it would be best if you come with us. We’ll inform your father as soon as possible, but you need to leave here for your own safety.”
“So, what’s next?” Regulus asked with a small sound of relief, most likely the younger was starting to get a cramp from maintaining the tapping of his shoe. Being that Regulus was the head of performances and rituals, he was able to keep a tempo in his head for hours if he must. Usually for this testy potion, it didn’t hurt to have another person keeping track of things.
to be more open to an opportunity to succeed. I might not have any attachment to mortals or think much of their frivolous ideologies, but I can understand the value in cunning and ambition. Don’t let your emotions cloud you to what you could achieve here. Many have had to claw and crawl to received only a pitiful glimpse of what you could have, at what I’m willing to bestow upon you for the mere presence of talent and potential I’ve seen in you.”
“You’re leaving me to deal with them on my own?! You’re evil, Bambi.” Came the expected complaint as the heavy metal door parted for the god.
. I have to prance my fine ass around all these hoity-toity bureaucrats that are just itching to dip their fingers in the Black family fortune or sidle up next to the guardian of the hero of the wizarding world.”
Griffins, having the front legs, wings and head of giant eagles; while their body, hind legs, and tail were that of a lion. There were around seven of the creatures, and they clacked their beaks until they were given treats of what seemed to be raw meat by the slight figures of another pair of humans. In some parts of the world, Harry knew that Griffins were often used by people to guard treasure and homes, like Sphinxes. They could be steeds, but it was difficult to gain such a degree of trust from these intelligent creatures. Two of the Griffins had saddles on them, so at least two of the group had accomplished the feat. This pair was shorter and lean, their cloaks showing just developing curves.
If only Sirius had thought to use this spell when the Potters went into hiding, the cowardly rat would have been dead before he could even have finished the thought of giving the Dark Lord their location. James would have never gone for it, Sirius knew, James would have recognized the use of blood and the way magic was linking to the core of a person as a dark practice.
On the other side Draco stared uninterested at his nails, “I wasn’t aware you accepted challenges for me now?”
“I believe it was for the conversation we had yesterday.” Hermione answered, hunching her shoulders up like she was trying to melt into them and disappear. All were surprised by; this was certainly odd of the girl that was often called too overconfident.
“Is something the matter?” Umbridge asked, one thin brow rising as she looked at the snow that still clung to the lord’s robes.

Silence met the words as Harry tried to decipher the meaning behind them. A scream that he didn’t remember? It hit him after a moment and immediately, the feast that had been settling in his gut felt like it was about to come back up. A cold sweat broke out over his skin. His breath hitched.
Neither Slytherin looked amused.
He didn’t think it would be a good idea to mention that his curse scar ached during and after the experience, it was a little too on the nose and revealing that he had suffered such an injury, it would make Draco too curious about his associate’s past.
The thought had Harry’s lips quirking upwards as the minutes ticked by and he chatted about upcoming classes, the new professors that were P.A.W.Ws, and upcoming trips to Hogsmeade.
Sirius pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers as he leaned further back into the couch, “There was a house elf found at the scene, a dead one, but clutched in her hand was a wand. When we checked the spells that the wand had last cast… it showed that this was the wand used to summon the mark. There’s going to be examinations performed to find out how the elf died, who she belonged to, and who’s the owner of the wand.”
In the next chapter, Harry will be heading off to Hogwarts.
Astarte: Levantine, Goddess of war, fertility, sexuality
“No! No, dude! Why, why would you even think that was what I-. That’s not what I meant!”
“Enemies have broken through the ranks!”
He really didn’t want to open the pages of the photo album that he had been gifted years ago by Hagrid, but he had to. The faces moved by quickly in the light of his wand as he flipped through the many pages. Until he finally found it…
“Brother.” Thor’s words were slow as he tried to keep his fury contained. It didn’t work very well as a few sparks danced off of his body and made the child yelp in terror. At least the boy finally grew still, too afraid of being shocked by the lighting that boiled under Thor’s skin. The palace was echoing with the sound of thunder as the storm suddenly grew worse outside.
“Forge?”
“The fallout of this night is going to be immense.” Severus murmured as he stepped away from the crib and started back towards the door not checking to see if Sirius was trailing behind him. He knew that he was.
Remus was a werewolf and that fact, that had come from no fault of his own, could unfairly ruin the life the kind man so enjoyed.
The Ministry had been ready to plug their desired replacement into the position that would teach history the way they deemed it should. The plan was cut short when Dumbledore gave his own suggestion for a replacement, the only thing working against Khanna was her age yet it was something easily overlooked. Her experience of having already been giving lectures across the country on a variety of historical matters hard to argue against. Talbott and Barnaby were friends with the young woman and though she did not know their secret, they believed that she would follow the book more than the Ministry.
Harry mused while tapping his chin in thought.
Oh, it seemed that Sirius had indeed worked on the Minister’s last nerve, that was twice in the meeting that he dropped the honorifics. Chuckling roguishly Sirius answered, “I accepted the gracious offer to be the new potions’ master and professor, of course.”
It felt awkward to offer encouragement to Draco, after all, Harry didn’t exactly want him to succeed in turning the coven’s opinion. Seeing Draco getting slapped last night made him nervous, the shock that had painted Draco’s face after it happened told Harry that it wasn’t a common occurrence at least. He didn’t feel that the dark wizard came from an abusive home either, Draco always spoke, what little he did, about his family with affection and pride.
The girls sang the next wordless chant louder than the boys as they gave time for the gathering to absorb their words before Theo’s voice came forth. Some of the dark twitched back, which confused Harry as the boy had a pretty good voice, “The ball has begun and we're closing our trap. Inwardly we're gathering ourselves.”
Almost four years ago, Harry himself was about to be sorted into Slytherin before Harry had argued with the Hat.
Sirius’ whole family had been Slytherins, why hadn’t Harry been told this? The many portraits in the manor had never mentioned it either, though none of them were particularly friendly towards Harry in the first place. Still, had Sirius ordered them to be silent?
Remus had grumbled about the fact that he seemed to be raising
Actually, it was more than a little disturbing what Sirius had been told by Remus when he questioned him about Harry’s school life knowing his lover would have a different viewpoint than most; along with seeing and realizing more than the boy himself did. Apparently, while Harry didn’t take part in any bullying or hazing in Slytherin students like some students did, particularly Gryffindors, he didn’t exactly put a stop to it either.
“I heard that Harry Potter was on the train, I’m assuming that’s you.”
And just like that, the exhaustion finally seemed to have caught up with Harry, his eyelids felt like they each weighed more than an Ukrainian Ironbelly. There was a shuffle under his mattress that startled him slightly, before going lax once more as his mind supplied the cause.
“Because I can’t even remember doing the impossible.” Harry agreed scornfully, hand reaching up to touch the scar upon his brow. She was right, typically was and Harry was usually in agreement with her findings even, but it was still a bitter potion to swallow, like over seeped betony tea.
“You have an incoming call, Boss.”
in his old line of work. He would have to take the Black seat in the Wizengamot, but at the same time keep his head down to not attract any additional suspicion when it came to voting on laws.
As the boy began to open his mouth, one hand reaching for his father’s arm the noise at the front of the store grew sharply in volume. The older wizard turned his head towards the ruckus with a glare, but Loki could see that there was an eagerness to his eyes. A gleam, a hunger for something interesting or profitable. Loki had seen it in his own gaze. The words he spoke were clipped, offering no room for argument.
The plot is starting to take shape, but there's still much to be decided.
His eyes glanced away from the now dark green brew to Regulus’ left arm, the Dark Mark had faded to be almost unnoticeable after the Dark Lord’s fall. Yet all of them could still feel its constant weight: an invisible shackle. Most of the coven that bore the mark still preferred to wear long sleeves to keep it from their mind. Severus felt silently thankful that his work had him dressed from chin to toe. The only skin he ever showed on a daily basis was the upper part of his neck, face, and hands. Even then, gloves were often donned depending on what he was using or making.
without complete knowledge trying to save each other’s lives.
Thuban and Harry both sat in silence for a few moments before the youth threw himself onto his back on the bed with a loud groan. When thinking of it from this perspective, it seemed like the demands were not so unreasonable. Bloody scary as hell, but not something that was without sense or merit. Killing was wrong, however it had been a wrong committed by both sides, that is what Harry had realized. Would Draco kill Harry if he knew who he really was?
Hermione had proceeded to pull her friends to each of these lessons every Sunday, they were… interesting at times. It wasn’t a surprise to see that those that attended were mainly Ravenclaws and a couple handfuls of Gryffindors. A scattering of Hufflepuffs also popped in and out, even one or two Slytherins would come from time to time. Harry probably would not have noticed who belonged to each house as everyone was in their casual weekend clothing and not their uniforms, but ever observant Hermione had pointed several people out.
The screen flickered to show images of both Loki and Draco while they cast magic. Loki frowned as he noticed many of the videos were of his attack on New York, a past that he seemed to never be able to shrug off. There were also those taken on the rare occasions that Loki had lent his aid to the Avengers since the fall of the Mad Titan. The last of course, was from just over three years ago as that had been his last visits to Midgard before meeting his heir.
“I will speak first,” Sirius rose, flicking back his sleeve and forcing himself not to react as the pockmark covered arm of the student was revealed when he did the same. Grasping the boy’s forearm firmly, Sirius could feel their rapid pulse. The racing of Derrick’s blood through his veins. It betrayed that calm facade that the boy tried to maintain.
“What did you say?” I call back to him as I wade closer to him through the water. I pay attention to not let my trousers become wet as it is my only grey pair and black would be positively murderous in this heat.
Whenever Harry spoke in a sharper tone, it made him sound more like James, at least more compared to the soft tone which was his normal tone of voice. Sirius found himself avoiding to look at the son of a werewolf, as he felt ashamed over the projecting he was doing onto the child. He knew that he wasn’t James, and even if Harry had been a perfect copy of him, which he wasn't even, that didn’t mean that Sirius had the right to use him as a replacement for the man he had lost.
"Congratulations, Mr. Heide."
"Hm?" He mumbled, trying to look at me through half-slept eyes. I opened my mouth in preparation to talk, but found myself properly speechless. I didn't know what I had wanted to tell him, or why I had attempted to see if he was awake in the first place. All I could process was his sunken and hurt demeanor.
"Well, when it came down to it, looking out for yourself is only the best way to survive a war, isn't it? I quite literally died. It was only sheer luck that brought me where I am today."
Once there, the first thing I did was close the door, and splash my face with cold water. My pulse was in my throat, and my head was pounding. I backed into the wall and sunk to the floor, breathing heavily.
"When you left to America... your father, he was upset. He got involved in nasty business, Draco. After a year he went missing, after two he was found... dead. He was killed, Draco."
"Oh.. why not?" I ignored his question, no longer wanting to talk about it, and pulled the map out from my robes.
"Did you know that the cartoon that this ride is based off of first aired in 1919?" I opened my eyes, staring at Draco.
"If you want, Harry, I can finish the
With that, McGonagall closed her speech, and sat down on her chair to eat and converse with the other staff and the other schools' headmasters.
"Harry, really?! Taking care of an unborn child, when you couldn't even watch over a ten-year old?"  He stood there quietly, showing no change in outward expression.
I just faintly, barely felt a kiss on my hairline.
The last time he looked like this was... Teddy and Scorpius's play date... when... he was asleep. At that moment I remembered how clearly I'd seen the new scratch marks that lined his chest, and how he had brought me to tears for the first time since the War...
"But it's fine now- it
"So, it's natural for children to want to know more about what's going on in the world. Let's begin with why you think it's not your place to tell him."
"Lost in deep thought, eh, Teddy?"
—Harry POV—
"Don't worry about it, I understand. Goodnight." She kissed me on the cheek and smoothly took my wand to then put it over on my nightstand.
"Yes, erm, I am. I just need to get going-"
"Yeah, yeah... I," I took a deep breath, falling into a normal sitting position. "I'm trying my best..." there was a tense, somber silence in the air, and I sought to fix it. "The uhm, grounding technique... I thought it was pretty nice. I found it helpful." I said with a small smile, turning to meet his eyes. He looked up at me, half hopeful.
I stayed silent, knowing that he was right. It had crossed my mind far too many times and I had stayed silent.
We all slowly looked to Hermione, somewhat taken aback that she had broken the silence.
"Harry... what happened?" I was only met by the slow rise and fall of his chest while he slept.
"It's okay..." I told him, patting him on the back.
"Hey, let's go salvage what's left of the sunset."
"Oh, I-I'm alright, really," I stuttered, grabbing the ends of my scarf roughly, nearly yanking on them, which made me pull my chin back in surprise, "I heard she's great at making sweaters, though." It took a second before I saw Victorie make an 'O' shape with her mouth and giggle, bending down slightly.
Scorpius stayed silent for a moment, and I continued passing my hand through his hair, soothing him as he leaned against me.
"Get your hands off of me you imbecile, I haven't done anything wrong- Harry!" His name ripped itself from my throat, leaving it irritated and burning. In a blind rush, I whipped my head over to where Scorpius was, seeing him panicked, and on the verge of tears. I jerked around to remove myself from the Aurors' grip, only for my attempts to be proven as futile when he forced me into stillness once again, muttering a "Don't make me use a stunning spell on you."
"Ron, where did you put my water bottle?!"
The morning was bright, and there was no extra time left to rest as excited chatter filled the dormitory and the common room below. Wendy practically dragged me by the arm into the common room. Only one word, pronounced with sharp tones and gritted teeth, could be heard echoing around the room: "Dragon."
"Go ahead and put this on." I told him. "And some jeans. Nice ones, not the ones you wear every day, please."
Painful understanding dawned on me as I realized he was talking about the War... about Voldemort.
"What matters is it happened," Longbottom interrupted. I leaned back in my chair, forcing my gaze to return to neutrality. "Now we just need to find out what's behind the kidnappings... do we know who is taking people?"
"Okay, fine. But he still shouldn't have done it." He agreed stubbornly.
"Who even did this, Ron? What kind of things were you sent to investigate that had you turning up in the hospital?" I sat down in the chair beside me, waiting patiently for Ron to answer. His weak smile faded completely, into an expression that held pain and concern.
I told myself, turning back to my novel. But it was a mere few seconds before the music began blaring again. I snapped the book closed in frustration.
"...I'm glad."
"When you showed it to me, last year... I, uhm, kept it safe. I tried to tell you you'd dropped it but you just kept going."
"I just, needed a moment." I told him, beginning to get dressed.
Draco was looking at him like he'd just been given a shock. I raised my head at Uncle Vernon, slowly. Dangerously.
We reached downstairs to find the Apollo flapping his wings in his spot on the wooden perch by the window, and the cat was playing with his cage, which had fallen to the floor. Well, it was rather obvious it had gotten knocked down by none other than that feline menace.
"What if we help each other?" I suggested, cutting him off.
"I've already summoned the jar, Scorpius. It's on the kitchen counter," I explained, standing, staring at my watch as if that would speed up time.
I huffed in a breath as I was roughly yanked back by my jumper, coming face to face with Draco, who, standing two steps above me, was towering over me almost menacingly. He reminded me of Uncle Vernon. Though, maybe it was just that my mind primed me into thinking about it. Nevertheless, I was startled into silence, my mouth gaping. Time stopped and everything went still. I blinked, harshly shoving his hand off of my shirt- which wasn't gripping it anywhere near as harshly as I'd thought- and I went back up the stairs, to the room, closing the door and sitting in a corner, knees drawn to my chest.
"He didn't have a child last year..." My brows furrowed in confusion before eventually realizing how they could mention an eleven-year-old child in such short notice.
—Draco POV—
"I... okay. Just... please tell me if you need anything. Make sure to defend yourself if something does happen. Ron and I'll be there for you."
"I don't know what on earth it is, quite a nasty shock realizing it's not just a weirdly shaped potato. It has a lot more fibers, and falls apart differently. And it has onions and... lime? It's weird. I've never had anything like it. It's not awful, just-" I paused, suddenly incredibly curious of what on earth this stuff was, I waved my hand slightly, getting Maria's attention.
"So, Teddy..." he exhaled, "how are things with Victorie?"
"No, no. Here. Let me hold you. Focus on me. Don't listen to the urge. Don't satisfy it." I heard him say. I only cried harder and I felt him hug me tightly again. I felt his chest against my ear and I felt his heartbeat. I tried to follow it, and to make my own match it, my skin still on fire.
"I'd watch my tongue if I were you Weasley." I spat, venom coating my words. I shoved my hands in my pocket and stayed ahead of them, knowing I'd probably hex him into oblivion seeing his stupid face again.
"No, Harry, it wasn't your fault, hey, listen to me." Everything felt hot, like fire. Something in me swayed, and I felt Draco holding me, I was shaking, and I didn't know exactly where I was anymore- everything merely a mass of black, swirling tar in my mind.
"Y-yeah... exactly." I shook my head. "Anyway, the files."
"Actually..." I interrupted. Dr. Gilroy paused, pushing a strand of her long hair out of the way.
"What happneed, Teddy? Why are you-"
My eyes kept opening and closing, tears just on the brim. I kept taking shallow, jagged breaths, and everything felt hot and uncomfortable. I choked back a whimper, and at the moment I just wanted to be on the floor, my surroundings didn't matter anymore. Slowly I was welcomed by the presence of cold, polished hardwood. I felt a hand on my arm, just there.
"Let's..." I tried to push forward closer to him, feeling a certain type of excitement build in me for the first time in a while, and my initial thought was
—Scorpius POV—
"I heard a bang. As if you hit your head. I heard you groaning in... frustration? What's wrong?"
I'm never letting go again.
"Hey, I'm here, love, I'm here. What's happened? What's wrong?"
"It's ok. You don't need to apologize at all. I'm here for you, always."
"Come on, let's make breakfast together." I looked up at him, as if I needed to make sure this was real. Then I took his hand and he helped me out of the bed gently. I examined the bandages on my arms and the small lines of old blood that had gotten through.
"Yes, I was. Don't worry, I'll get up now. Go ahead and go to the living room. I'll be right over."
"Ted, I know that it's not what you want to hear, and that it can be tough standing up to bullies. But I know from experience that if you don't do that, you're going to feel worse than you already do." I looked up at Harry, seeing a look in his eyes like he was begging.
I closed my eyes. I just want to get lost and forget about everything. I folded my arms and rested them on my knees, bringing my head down. I felt my tears drip and fall. There's no point in fighting it anymore.  I felt my shoulders move up and down with my sorrows.
"I'm sorry... I've just been, preoccupied..."
"Draco, you better apologize to your son."
"I find it quite nice as well- but please, do mind Scorpius." I sucked in a breath. Bringing my voice down to a whisper. "You know I haven't told him yet."
"I- I don't..." his voice trailed, and he had a far-off gaze.
"We'll figure this out together."
"He- there's this thing going on, and it's really concerning... uhm. Scorpius wants answers. He's been asking for months now. And I told him I would talk to Draco, but it's just not my place to tell him anything. And- well, I... I don't want to talk to Draco about that, though. I... I don't know why I told Scorpius that I would. I- I just..."
"Well, I can't say I'm particularly surprised, considering your childhood, Harry. I do have a few theories about this, actually." I squirmed in my spot as she spoke.
"Why did you scream at me to get out, then?"
"I just can't stop thinking about it." I readjusted myself in bed to get comfortable. Ron was laying next to me.
But I couldn't bring myself to react to her words. In the end, it was Draco who spoke for me.
"We went through it together."
I rolled my eyes. "Don't get me started."
"I'm quite fine." He said shortly, still picking at his arms. I swatted his hands away from them.
Things were looking okay. Draco said he was seeing improvement, that I was smiling a little bit more. I'll never forget
"I'm fine. I just zoned out a bit, I guess. I'll be right down." His eyes lingered on me a little bit, seemingly studying me. After a moment, he gave my shoulder a quick squeeze.
My forehead delivered a piercing ache and I stood up, distancing myself from him, suddenly wanting to be alone. He stood up as well, confusion written across his face. My breathing quickened again. I wiped my face harshly with my sleeve.
"Where's Scorpius?" I asked, curiosity lacing my tired tone.
"I may be a shit father but I'm trying to make up for it, and that's more than my aunt and uncle ever did for me. So shut your sodding mouth and let me go-"
"Well you 'slipped' so bad that you passed out."  He roared pointedly. I shut up after that, leaving us in silence. It was after a bit that I heard him sigh and get up. I thought he was simply going to leave, until he held out a hand for me.
"You wouldn't let me take your arms...you wouldn't hug me. You always hug me." He said with a confused and stern expression. I stayed silent.
Draco faltered. "Excuse me?"
I felt Harry move after a bit. "Draco... can I... can I do something?" He asked, looking me in the eyes. I put my book down and sat up on the bed. He did the same.
"Scorpius, no... H- I... had to erase her memory." I saw his previous excitement simmer down into a look of confusion and lost confidence.
"That's probably Dr. Gilroy. She knows that I brought you in here."
job."
I found Victorie along the way, hanging out with her friends near the Great Hall. She took my hand with an eager smile, which I did not expect in the slightest, but didn't turn it away either. She commented on how I looked like a tomato, both my friends and hers giggled, and we went on our way to the hall. It looked ten times brighter than usual, which made me wince for a second, but I couldn't look away from it; every surface was shinier, the usual number of candles increased tenfold, and there were the four banners representing each house hung up on the ceiling. As soon as enough people were in the hall, the candles dimmed for a second, before the champions appeared in the center and performed the opening dance. Everyone was quite graceful, even the Durmstrang champion, who had the bulkiest build out of all of them.
"Harry? Who are you speaking to? I'm coming in."
"Yeah," I said. "Well it's good to hear that everything is going well. And Hermione, how's the Ministry?" I cringed inwardly at the mention of it, but I didn't want to leave her left out, and she was wearing her ministry uniform, clearly planning to go to work after this dropping Rose off.
—that night, during dinner—
"Are they gone?" I whipped my head over to see Draco.
"I'd love to continue this..." I took some small breaths. "But dinner should be ready soon."
"What does that have to do with his magic?" I asked, no longer frustrated, only confused.
"I don't hear you denying that I'm the best at getting you up." He said with a smirk.
"I- what happened to everyone?" I heard him ask. It was then I remembered what I left this morning.
"Was it something that worried you?" He pleaded. I stood there, wondering if it was the best idea to tell Harry what I heard. The last thing anyone needs is for his progress to go backwards.
Uh.... TRIWIZRD TOURNAMENT? Y'all, last time one of those happened, it did Not End Well.
"It wasn't your fault, if that's what you're thinking..." I said, at a slight loss for words.
, we were both hugging each other tightly- his heart was okay now- and soon enough, we were both sitting side by side on the edge of the bed. My mind was buzzing, and I felt like I was going crazy. But, at least I wasn't panicking anymore. I kept reminding myself to take deep breaths.
"Anytime, mate."
"Why do you burn yourself in the shower?"
"You're okay." He said gently. "Now let's finish up that list." He grabbed the parchment and uncrumpled it.
"I had a bad dream." He said, sniffling a little bit. I took two large strides over to him, crouching down to be at eye level. He took me into a hug as tight as he could make it.
Dusk finally arrived, and the usually grey sky was tinted with orange and pink hues. I walked down the hallway after the last of my classes, Gabriel's words still echoing in my mind.
, and
I let out a slight scoff. "You could say it that way."
"It was right scary, mate. I was caught off guard and in less than a second I found myself bleeding." He chuckled slightly, trying to sit up.
"I don't really think your dad will mind too much," I responded with a small smile. Scorpius hesitantly broke a piece off the chocolate bar, taking a bite. His eyes never wavered from me. I sat back down in my previous spot on the bed, taking my own small bite of chocolate.
"And Draco Malfoy! The biggest git on planet earth. He- you..." she grabbed me by the upper arm, dragging me with her to the living room where Draco was now finished serving the breakfast we'd been making.
"Good morning. Excited, are we?"
Enjoy today's chapter!
I inhaled sharply and turned to see Harry. He was still sitting there hugging himself. his head was in his arms, and he was still shaking. I brought my hand to his and squeezed it tightly. He squeezed back.
"So, M-Draco. How has everything been?" Asked Granger, breaking the tense silence
"I need you to relax for me. Please?" I heard him suck in a breath, before shaking hands were brought to my upper back, and he leaned into me.
"Another year," said Luca, settling into his spot beside me. "So, what elective courses have you signed up for?" I smiled at Luca, shifting to make sure he had ample room on the train's seat.
"Harry..." I heard him say.
"Mother... I... how have you been? I hadn't-"
"O-Oh, sorry," she apologized. In a second, we were all off to our DADA class.
We stayed like that for a minute, before I heard the usual thundering of Scorpius' tiny footsteps going down the stairs.
"No. Say it. I need to hear you say it out loud." He said with a wavering voice. My throat closed up and for a second, I didn't do anything to help it. I didn't want to respond, to give him false hope. It was more than a moment before I responded, and I was surprised that he didn't urge me to answer, just staying by me quietly, looking intently, patiently waiting for me to answer him.
"Who did he hurt?"
Without hesitation, I leaned forward to kiss him. After a few feather-light kisses, Draco wrapped his arms around my neck. The kiss deepened, and I tried to close any distance left between us.
I shook my head, leaving the conversation for her to direct.
The last two days before we moved, we packed my house up. Throwing away what we don't need, and transferring it to Grimmauld Place right then and there. I remember when Harry discovered my basement.
"I know, now's not the time for jokes, I guess. Sorry." He said shortly.
"You know, I did almost everything with you. Everybody followed you, admired you even." Said Millicent, staring Draco with a ferocity that burned. My fists balled up at the thought of all she put Hermione through.
"Thank you for having us." I said.
"And what?" I questioned.
Enjoy!!
"We're going home, Scorpius. Say bye to everyone." Said Draco
"Are you alright?" I heard him whisper. I nodded, closing my eyes for a second.
"Well, erm... Good night, Luca," I said quickly, before nearly bolting to the common room door and closing it offhandedly.
"Alright, I'll wake Scorpius and get started on that." I told him, standing to leave the room. When I closed the door, starting down the hallway, my mind attacked me with questions:
After a moment, what he'd said finally hit me. My expression fell. I was no longer angry, but concerned, and confused.
"Thanks Maria." I muttered sarcastically, leaving her house. I walked over to mine, opening and closing the door gently. The table was clear, and Harry and Scorpius were nowhere in sight. After a short search, the first person I found was Scorpius, who was in his room.
My thoughts began racing, running back to every moment that my friends would have shown some kind of... something.
"Me and Bonnie have been waiting for you, mate. We're headed off to breakfast, but...I reckon you've had better days. We'll stay with you for a bit, but we still have to leave for class," He said. Though I could read his intentions as kind, he spoke to me as if he had an important business meeting to attend to. Moments later, I heard a high voice call out from the common room.
And would Scorpius even care? He met my mother two weeks ago and if that single encounter wasn't enough for him to gather that there is a gaping canyon between the two of us that can't be fixed," he gasped, pausing, and then shut his eyes again.
"Same here," I retorted, feeling a grimace form on my face.
The match ended an hour and a half later, and even though the Shooting Stars were the first to find the Golden Snitch, the Silver Arrows had dominated the competition. We surrounded Bonnie after the game, and I was eager to express my gratitude and congratulations.
"Sh, it's okay. This- this looks a bit scary, so I'm going to heal you with magic, Harry. Can you hear me? It's going to leave a scar, and it might hurt... I'm not very skilled in this, Harry. Please nod for me." Through my shuddering breaths and my trembling and dizziness, I nodded, ever so minimally, into his chest. His cold hand took my arm, which in all honesty, felt like it was on fire.
"Well... what if we talk to Kingsley?"
"Happy Christmas, Charlie. Hungarian Horntail, you say? Those are pretty fierce."
His bed was in pristine conditions, the white duvet tucked neatly into the corners, the illustrations of crayons sitting still. I blinked, startled when the cat jumped onto the bed. With a sigh, I turned back to the dresser.
"Why the mark isn't there, you mean," he supplied.
After seven or so rounds of Gobstones, many disappointed faces, and lots of stinky smells in the air, the grown-ups called us over for dinner. Some of us were a bit slower than others of us, but we all went outside to the backyard. The floating lights seemed to shine brighter now that it was darker.
I closed my eyes and focused on my surroundings.
"No. I just wanted to do something with you. Come, to the backyard." He visibly relaxed, and I led him to my little set up, glancing towards him, where I saw a smile playing at his features.
I took a deep breath, glancing at Harry.
He turned to me and his eyes lit up. "Hi! Is Scorpius here?"
With shaking, determined hands, she flipped through the endlessly annotated book, eyes scanning for a particular instance written in the books. "Our first transfiguration class... it's funny how she decided that she could snoop around all other aspects of Harry's life, but not our classes... she said that Professor Flitwick fell over his pile of books when he read Harry's name." She said with an airy sort of laugh and a half smile as she pointed it out for me to read.
"Hey, John," Luca suddenly looked up, squinting his eyes up at John. "Why weren't you at rehearsal yesterday? Heard you nailed the audition for the first part on flute."
We apparated home, and Harry began to break down as I held him in my arms. I suspected he wasn't going to be able to keep it together much longer, which is why I explained that we don't need to pick up Scorpius right away.
"Hey, hey." I started, taking his arms gently. "What a-"
"I just needed a breather, was wondering if you wanted to catch up?" I turned, raising an eyebrow. For the first time in an eternity, I took in his features. His face was sunken, he had bags under his tired eyes, he was almost pale, and definitely skinny. Any sort of smile that may have been on my face was gone.
"Can I ask you why?" There was a lump in my throat. I enjoyed this conversation as much as a cat enjoys bathing, but I couldn't put it off anymore. I reached out to Scorpius, putting a comforting hand on his upper arm.
I exhaled sharply, feeling my heart hammering in my chest. I held my head in my hands.
That wasn't the only whimsical land in the park. After more than a few hours sweating like dogs, we deemed it necessary to find the nearest water ride- which happened to be hidden within another cartoon-esque land. We were all absolutely drenched by the end of it, and though we could have dried each other off easily with magic, we decided to continue on with our dripping clothes, because the sun was drying us off quickly enough anyway, and the water had been a cool refresher. We only dried our shoes with magic, after Draco and Scorpius started complaining about the sloshing.
Luca raised his eyebrow. "You're a real disaster when you don't sleep. That parchment is blank."
"I need to remember them."
Should I tell her and risk betraying his trust? Just then I heard a small scream in the direction of the yard.
I answered right away: "I was in a dark place... I was desperate... in need of help. And I guess deep down I knew you weren't as horrible as you'd always acted..." I said a bit awkwardly.
"But I'm better than you!" He exclaimed.
"Malfoy Manor!" And like that, we were whisked away, landing with two feet firmly in the drawing room of my childhood home. Of Scorpius' home for the first few months of his life.
"Is dad okay?" he asked, as though that was the third time he'd done so already. I glanced up the stairs, taking note of how the house had dimmed with the setting sun. With wandless magic, I turned on the electric lights.
"Harry I hurt people. Stop pretending it's alright," I interrupted, feeling my heart begin to speed up.
"Is that what you two were arguing about when we saw your mum?" My eyes snapped up to him.
The figure brought it's hand out towards me, and I instinctively pushed myself back. The figure's hand didn't waver.
"You need to get up." He said.
"Shh, don't worry Draco. I know. We're going to figure it out. Don't worry." One of Harry's hands was passing through my hair soothingly.
"Get the box from the pantry, will you, Scor," began Draco. I noticed him glance at his arm. "We'll be right down."
"Harry, there you are." I whipped my head around to fine Hermione, Ron, and Rose weaving their way through the crowds.
"Just sorry? That's all? We were all waiting for you: the family, Hermione, even Neville, Luna, and Teddy were there. Ginny too. Why didn't you show up? Not even a note or a card-" His voice was getting louder, and I matched his tone, trying not to explode.
For the first time in eleven years, he wasn't there to have lunch with me. For the first time in eleven years, there was no sound of his quick little footsteps running around the house, or of his game, or the television. I couldn't see him sitting there watching Spider-Man or how he stuck his tongue out of the corner of his mouth when completing one of his many, many puzzles, or watch him dancing to his heart's content.
"What did Weaslette tell you?"
Hello readers! Apologies for the long wait, I was on vacation. But, I am back now!!!! Last chapter was Scorpius' birthday!!! And now, we get a sweet moment between the three of them before Something that Draco has been dreading for only the entire eleven years of Scorpius' life... I wonder what it could be. Well, you may have to wait a few chapters to figure it out.
"What stuff?" I asked, looking for specificity. I was looking at him, studying the side of his face intently. Noting how you could see when he clenched his jaw, or moved it around. Seeing the small twitch on the corner of his lips, and how his eyes would scan the area in front of him. I could see the wheels in his head turning behind that mop of hair as he searched for the right words. Perhaps, that was all he was looking for.
"With your cousin as well, I presume?"
"I haven't really adapted to Muggle life." I tilted my head, not believing what he was saying.
The overwhelming relief that flooded through me, sending delightful chills throughout my entire body as I sat on my broom for no reason other than pure leisure, was exhilarating. I felt like a happy teenager whose problems had become weightless. I had become weightless. I could do anything.
"You're too late, Weasley. You and your friends may think you have us now, but you don't know. The Dark Lord lives on!" he broke out into a laughter that reminded me far too much of Bellatrix Lestrange. I ignored the violent twisting in my gut, keeping my expression trained and unmoving.
—Draco POV—
"He got injured on the field. I sent you an Owl, along with Arthur and Molly, but-"
... and... I kind of do want to catch up with you after what happened with the ministry a few days ago..."
"Okay. Upstairs. Let's go." I said, ushering him up, and following behind him.
So instead of locking himself in our room, where I can go in and talk things out with him, he locks himself in the spare room of his friends.
"Alright Scorpius, lets go pick out a cereal." He, unfortunately, let go of my hand to hold Scorpius's, and I grabbed hold of the shopping cart.
"Well, you also told me that it seems your cousin is better, right? And Draco can testify?" Draco nodded when she glanced towards him and she promptly turned back to her notepad, writing more things down.
"I didn't lie... when I said it was stressful."
"You can't argue with him there. This is a very yummy snack," I said. Scorpius offered me a high five.
The words finally burst out of my chest. So did the burning pain, and I could not help but yelp and shrink into myself, still crying, my breath now beginning to shorten and sharpen.
"Why?" I heard the fireplace roar to life in the distance.
I wish I had an instant reply:
"Should not be upset. From what I've seen, he loves and cares for you tremendously, and if he cares just as much for his son, he will probably be happy to see the two of you getting along."
"He's still asleep. It's a bit early out, and he didn't sleep well last night." Draco explained.
"Oh, shut it," Luca laughed as he lightly punched me in the arm.
—Draco POV—
"I'm sorry." Our identical words collided with one another's as we spoke them at the same time. I hesitantly stepped forward, he didn't move.
"Hm." She took another long drink. I stared, startled by her lack of a reaction, wondering if there was more to come.
"We know that what happened wasn't our fault?" He hesitated before nodding. "How have you been feeling, Scor?" He was silent for a moment. I saw him looking around- me, his lap, his hands, the bookshelf on the wall, the piano, the window. I allowed him to gather his thoughts, aware that this would be difficult for him. After all, I had gone through something similar with Astoria.
I thought to myself.
"Thank you. Now go play. I love you." I gave him a quick hug, and then ushered him away.
"Why do you get to be the guy?"
—Draco POV—
It was a few seconds before he, without speaking, pushed his chair out, leaving the table. I didn't have the energy to tell him to wash his hands. He should know to do so anyway. When Scorpius' tiny footsteps dissipated up the stares, Harry slowly removed his hands from his mouth, eyes wide.
"I'm Sam too,"  replied a girl with short brown hair, a blue shirt, and dinosaur themed shoes.
"You won't leave?" He asked. His voice cracked slightly, though he quickly brought it back under control.
"That's not good. Certainly not." Wendy said, then cleared his throat.
Another squeeze.
"Yes?" I tugged his sleeve softly, keeping him with me and searching his expression for my own strength to speak.
A pause.
"Yeah! Rose taught me a matching game with chocolate frog cards and Ron tried teaching me how to play Wizards chess. It's a hard game though. I need to practice to get good at it." Scorpius' was speaking a mile a minute, and with the day I've had, I couldn't help but be caught slightly off guard by it.
"Gabriel! It's okay, mate, breathe for a second," I gently grabbed his upper arm. I looked at Wendy in bewilderment, and he looked down, cheeks red. Gabriel was taking quick, shallow breaths, while staring into nothing.
"You know... there's nothing wrong with it... if it is what I think:.." she said softly and carefully.
"One night he woke up howling in pain. It was hurting, and he panicked so bad that he began bawling his eyes out, and he wouldn't stop crying..."
"But-"
Before I could respond I saw a certain fear flash through his eyes. He looked as though he expected death to come from every corner.
I lay in my bed silently looking at nothing in particular. Then my vision wandered towards my arm. Specifically the one in front of me. I traced down all the old lines as though mentally feeling them.  I closed my eyes tightly as they watered and turned my head towards the ceiling. I took a tired breath. I don't know how I'll survive the day when I'm like this as soon as I awoke. I figured I should try to go back to sleep since I knew I had an hour until I had to wake Teddy. Maybe that's what I need in order to feel better. Just a nap.
"What're you looking at?"
"Why were you screaming and crying?" He asked.
I exhaled sharply. My chest squeezed, ready to collapse. The very last thing I wanted, my son taking on the consequences of my actions...
Luca nodded. I brushed off my pants and checked my shoes, intending to walk away before Gabriel told me to put gel in my hair. We both got up to walk to the lanes, before I saw a certain reddish-blonde girl headed our way.
Now, we live in Muggle America, far from the wizarding world we grew up in, and far from the people we once knew.
"I don't understand." He said, a light, airy chuckle escaping him. I laid down again, looking at the ceiling.
"Teddy, those kids are absolutely crazy to believe baseless and stupid rumors like that-"
"Stop! Stop I'm gonna pee!" I did stop tickling him after that, not wanting any accidents to occur.
"Think about it. Let me know." I told Harry, finally going to Scorpius's room, only to see him with a turtleneck jumper stuck around his head.
"I wanted to tell you, but... I never knew how to. And I kept getting updates from Mum, and everything is getting worse... I don't know what to do."
"It's fine. Don't worry, that's what
"I can use the car just fine! I can use everything I need to use."
"And then you throw," I punctuated, backing away from her. I put my hands to my waist and released a breath I didn't know I was holding. She threw it... alright. She didn't hit any pins at all, though.
"I'm afraid your godfather, Mr. Potter, is not feeling quite well these days. He is in the hospital."
After several moments of being an unwavering physical support, I let go of the hug and looked into her glassy, hazel eyes, brushing a stray bit of  disheveled hair out from where it had fallen in front of her face.
"Sorry. I had to get a new bar of soap." I said, gesturing towards the new bar of soap by the sink.
"I'm... I'm gonna be there in a second!" Scorpius shouted. Draco and I hurriedly took two large strides into the house to discover that Scorpius was at the top of the flight of stairs. His breaths seemed quick, and he was swinging his arms back and forth and grasping at his vest. Draco's eyes widened in horror, and he became stiff.
"Um, ma'am, what are you writing?" I inquired while sitting up to look at her and what she was writing.
—Draco POV—
—Teddy POV—
"We did it." I repeated, taking in multiple breaths. "It's okay... nothing happened-" I said, mirroring Draco's words and trying to reassure myself all the same. My breaths and voice shook.
"Well, 'nothing' seems to be affecting you. Where is it. I want to read your owl."
to keep it a secret, Scor." We held eye contact until he broke it, looking back down.
The sound of birds chirping in the distance and the wind whispering through the tree leaves were the only thing keeping us from complete silence. Harry stayed in my arms for a long time, not speaking, and it was sure that he didn't need these questions at the moment, but in an entire week, I had still managed to not figure it out. I had never pushed past the fact that he was having a breakdown in an upturned Sirius' room.
"I'm doing
"Can I go potty?" He asked
"I've had an important ten years..." said Draco stiffly. I could tell he was uncomfortable with the whole situation; Seeing Hermione cry over me and my life.
"Hey Uncle Harry, Hi Scorpius, Hi Draco-"
She slammed her hands on to the table, pushing herself up. That caught his attention, I know because I saw him jump and look at her. She put her plate in the sink and walked out the front door with her keys, phone, and wand.
The room had gone as stiff and silent as Harry. I discreetly went to take his hand. Dr. Gilroy sighed.
"Yes, dad."
Gabriel smiled, but he kept his eyes trained on me. Maybe he was also trying to see if he had seen me before.
"So are we cool?"
"Hey mate," Ron said, going off towards Harry. Hermione stayed in front of me, looking deep in thought.
"Are you going to say anything? Agree? Disagree?" I didn't give any indication of an answer. "Can I ask you something?" He asked. I nodded.
I let his gentle guiding hand bring me to lay down, and I settled next to him, bringing my arm around his lower back and him doing similarly to me. Harry's head rested on my upper chest I was in the perfect position to give him thousands of kisses if I so wanted. I moved my hand up slowly, letting it weave into his hair.
"Goodnight"
"Scorpius looks like he's had ten bags of sweets." Chuckled Draco, looking over his right shoulder to his wide-eyed son. "He's going to self-combust and go into a sugar high, I'm sure of it. It is rather sweet, though. They definitely did their homework with all of this." He swirled the contents around in his own mug, before taking another sip.
"Remember, Sweetheart, when I told you that I left the school just before my last year?"
"But-"
"And we know that Professor Trelawney is a seer-"
"Prat."
I felt him stiffen under me, before he slowly moved to see me. His movement forced me to lift my head from the spot on his shoulder.
"Wait. What were you doing when I came to find you?" I looked at him, holding back any expression.
behind me, which caused me to wobble in my broom and my heart to nearly burst out of my chest.
In an area entirely dedicated to dinosaurs, we stopped to take a rest, and to use the loo. Looking at the map, we saw that the next area we were going to find was indeed the place we had to visit all along, so we took advantage and cast a wordless, wandless silencing charm, explaining everything to the kids.
Scorpius began to take several breaths that were much too short, none of which had proper exhalations. He was desperate to bring himself back under control and it was making him worse. I held him closely, letting him listen to my heartbeat, shushing him softly.
"Hey, Gabriel!" Gabriel quickly looked at us and waved very intensely. I giggled and waved back.
"I wanna stay with you." His words were a sleepy and quiet jumbled mess, but they were comprehensible at least.
"But keeping to yourself, trying to make it look like you're okay, only makes it feel worse," I whispered in reply.
I awoke with a jolt, only to hear the sound of James crying. I wiped my brow, catching my breath. I looked down at my wrist. It was perfectly fine, but I felt it, I knew; that's where he held me. I refocused my attention on James, stumbling out of bed and to the crib. I picked him up.
"These past few days have been difficult. It's perfectly understandable if you want to stay in today," I murmured into his ear. "I'll stay with you, if you like."
Let me know what y'all think, and as always...
"No, Harry. Hermione says that She and Ron are worried sick about you. And they aren't the only ones."
"Ted, I... I'm sorry." Luca's face was red, and he looked down. "There's been so much happening, and there are so many... letters." He sniffled.
But I kept that portion of my statement out, knowing it wouldn't help in any way.
"Don't worry. I've got you. Everything will be alright."
"No! I want to be a big kid." His face was one of childish anger. I chuckled, picking him up and putting him back on the floor.
"I'm good, Nev. How's Hogwarts?"
"I'm Bonnie. And you?" I snapped out of my daze.
"Yes, They're in custody. Harry; Berrycloth says that Kingsley wants you to question them." I swallowed. All eyes settled on me again.
"Hey, Ted, why the confused face?" He asked, reaching for his usual muffin, two slices of bread, and... chocolate spread. I felt my brows furrowing in confusion.
Two kisses turned to three, then four, then just one long continuous one. We moved closer to each other, and soon I was on top of him as we continued our little 'adventure' together. We deepened our passion, and soon we became more persistent with each other; we were no longer just kissing. I felt his hand reach the small of my back, going up slowly. He stopped at my upper back, my shirt jumbled up by his hand, and I felt as he pressed me towards him in a protective manner. I felt safe. I felt like being with him made things okay.
—Harry POV—
I like how Draco looks when he's talking about Scorpius: his eyes light up with fondness, he smiles and laughs at the memories, and he looks like a good, loving, caring, and protective father who will do absolutely anything for his son. And I can't say I don't encourage conversation about Scorpius, because really; he cares about Scorpius
"Oh, well you've got to bring me some one of these days. I'd love to try them."
Get ready! Get set!
"I won't be here for long, young one!" He guffawed. I winced, wondering how thoughts could be so loud.
"I couldn't stand another moment not knowing for myself that you were okay-" I paused, just holding him tighter. He sank into me.
With that the silencing charm went down, and I caught up to mother, who was waiting patiently at the entrance, a worn expression on her face.
"Where's your first aid kit?"
"You'll be there right?"
"Oh, well, it was only my job, really. Besides, you lot have done nothing wrong. The least I could do was share the truth." I explained.
"I'm just so tired of it," he began weakly. "F-for months... this has been happening every day for months... and we still don't know why..."
"How are you doing today Maria?" I asked, blinking a few times to look less dead than I felt.
Welp, enjoy!
"Yeah, it must not be fun, pregnant at an amusement park," I responded.
"Maybe blaming myself for the outcome is the best thing I can do! Maybe taking care of James and Ginny is my way of making sure the guilt doesn't gnaw at my consciousness every fucking second!" I yelled. Suddenly everything was silent, and, with a nasty glare towards Draco, I left the bathroom, walking. I went past Hermione and Ron, past Ginny's room, and down the corridor . Down the elevator, and out the front of the hospital, where I just stood there, leaning against a column.
"...We were all separated based on whether our parents and grandparents were magic or not." I glanced back at Harry, then I looked down to the sheets, running my hand over the quilted pattern. "There are pure-blooded wizards and witches, like us. When you are pure-blooded, it means that both of your parents and grandparents were magic. Then, there are half-bloods. There are two types of half bloods. There's the type where one parent is magical, and the other is not, and then there's people like Harry." I gestured to Harry.
I placed our foreheads together, closing my own eyes, welcoming the idea of rest. My mind swayed, and I found myself thinking about Dr. Gilroy, and what she told me about saying things out loud...
"Maybe. How did you sleep?" I asked.
I was startled out of my mind at the sound of a knocking at the door.
"What," I snapped. Harry sighed.
After becoming eerily calmed, and having red lines over old scars on both of my arms, I washed the blade and hid it again, before rinsing the blood off and dabbing my small slits with toilet paper, which I then promptly flushed down the toilet. I took another deep breath, grateful to have been able to calm down.
"I said 3!"
"I'd say that's classic of you."
Enjoy!!
"Get out of my office before I am made to escort you out."
"Muggle Studies?" questioned Luca. "Don't you live with Muggles?"
"Dad, is Harry okay?" I turned to Scorpius.
"You too, Luca. I... I wouldn't have asked to be with anyone else."
"Are you alright? You seem tired."
My heart was pounding. I glanced over to the table Aminata was sitting at and I saw her intensely staring into my soul. I sat down on the stool, and felt the hat be placed onto my head. Just then, a voice appeared in my mind.
Draco didn't say anything, not that he needed to, but he held me closely. That was all the comfort I needed, but really, it did nothing for the fact that everything I've ever known was so much bigger than anyone thought.
"That's great, Ron. And Hermione? How's she holding up?"
"Harry..." She stood up with a sigh, getting her plate and Rose's, taking them to the sink. Teddy nudged me, gaining my attention.
"Five minutes. No more than that, I promise."
—Draco POV—
"Good morning to you too," Hermione huffed before Harry shoved me to the side.
"No! No, Scorpius, of course not. You are- You are the best thing that happened to me after those horrible years-"
I was sitting in front of the class with Rose, so I didn't have the chance to look at my other classmates. Throughout the class, I'd kept wondering if people were looking at me or not. I don't know why I should even care. But I did. I fought the desire to whip my head around and look, even if I did it as subtly as possible. I didn't want anybody to think that yesterday got to me... and I don't know why I think that. It was just a passing moment, after all. And with Luca being there for me the whole evening after, I shouldn't have anything to worry about. He has, I have, shown others that he is on my side.
"It seems Kingsley got us a suite. All of us fit in the same room," said Ron.
"Hey Harry. Are you alright?" She asked, voice laced with concern.
"Shut up. Both of you. It's difficult enough wondering if we'll be organizing Harry's funeral before he even reaches his thirties. I can't take you two morons constantly bickering as if there's nothing better to do and worrying more about our past than this exact moment. " I said sternly, holding back fuming anger.
"It felt... different. I couldn't understand that I was awake. I knew I was. I just... I was..." he looked me in the eyes with an expression of pain, shaking his head.
"I'm sorry, I know. What I did is horrible, I-" He took a breath.
"I think you will," he said mischievously with his crooked smile.
"You like it, though."
"Everyone will have to learn about it. But they can't learn about it before they're ready-" I hesitated, thinking about being eleven and learning that everyone knew more about me than I did. Feeling lost and confused as everyone could take one look at my scar and tell me my own family's history.
We walked over to the table where, with a flick of her wand, Andromeda set up 3 cups of tea. We sat down.
I woke the next morning with my face tear-stained. I hadn't even realized that I cried in my sleep. But a new thing was, I didn't wake up. I kept my eyes closed and buried myself deeper into this hug with Draco. I let myself find comfort and keep away from my other thoughts and from the nagging itch on my wrists as I heard the gentle thump of his heart and felt the warmth of his embrace that I was becoming more and more familiar with.
"I love you."
"Teddy. Can we speak for a moment?"
notes. I slammed the book shut, leaning back in my chair and groaning.
"Oh. That's from those two friends of yours. I meant to tell you. I guess it may have slipped my mind. I let go of his hand in order to get to and open the letter.
"No, no! Lettuce, get- down! Off the table!" He then zoomed past us holding a tiny white cat, who had a bit of chicken still in its mouth. He put it in a cage in the corner of the room, muttering. "That damned- ugh, It even scratched me." Scorpius furrowed his brows in anger, walking towards the kitchen. I followed suit, sitting next to him, across from Uncle Harry. Draco soon caught up to us, sitting down in front of Scorpius.
Luca was sat against the wall, knees to his chest, and robe draped over him as he looked up at me in alarm. It was almost as if he was using it as a shield of sorts, or to hide something. His eyes were rimmed pink, and he blinked back tears, continuing to make himself breathe deeply. I cautiously sat down beside him.
"Is the table all set?" I asked, feeling around for the blasted container.
"The letter you got yesterday was from your Muggle relatives?" I tensed, before nodding in agreement.
"What? N-No, I-"
It was only then that I realized not eating breakfast, and barley eating yesterday, has left this empty, small-feeling hole. And I had been ignoring the constant rumbling of my stomach, and the familiar tickle in my throat.
We locked eyes. Draco's eyes were entrancing. All I wanted to do was kiss him.
"Ron, I- I can't... I can't-" I didn't even know what I was trying to say anymore. My words got choked back and before I knew it I was trying to stop my tears. I stumbled over myself, snapping my head up towards Kingsley, who, like Ron, was watching me with concern across his face.
"Want to tell me what's on your mind?" I offered a shy smile, settling in my spot.
"Don't worry. It's going to be alright. You're strong, you're brave. You will get through this."
"I'm perfectly fine- worrying about you. Draco never told my why you ended up in the hospital. I mean, I could only figure so much, but-"
People left and right moving, talking. The world spins at so fast we don't even feel it. My eyes darted around, hands clenching open and closed, open and closed. There was a tightness that'd begun in my chest, crawling up my throat. I kept looking around, the breath within me becoming constrained.
Enjoy!
"Don't think about the feeling. Focus on my heartbeat. Try to match it, cool, calm." I pressed my arms into him further. Screwing my eyes shut. I shook lightly.
"I just haven't really spoken to a stranger in a long time." He said, looking ashamed at his loss of confidence in life.
Now, it's roughly eleven o'clock at night, and Draco had given Scorpius a dreamless sleep potion for the first time. I watched silently by the door as Draco tucked him in, assuring that everything would be fine, and that he'd wake up to a brand new tomorrow. He stayed sitting by Scorpius' bedside, stroking his hair until he was sure that he'd fallen fast asleep.
Now, Harry. I am going to need an answer from you for this. I can't let Draco answer for you," Harry looked up, shifting closer to me.
I don't know when I found a blade, but I'd obviously used it and lost it all before I could realize I was bleeding the first time. So, the only choice I had really, if you think about it, was just, tear myself apart until I lost enough blood, until I knew I got what I deserved.
"Uhm, sure. I'll go do that now." I told them, getting up and leaving the two alone.
"Okay."
"Look, Scor, I'm sorry. Just... be careful, alright? Those kids may have been nice, but we don't really know if that's who they are on the inside.
"Writing, for example. Or music- playing an instrument, singing, dancing... others like to draw or paint as well. Some people squeeze a pillow or a stress ball. Some take hot showers... Exercise... if you have a pet, you can play with it... anything in particular that really interests you..." she kept pausing as if she expected me to enthusiastically tell her
" I laughed at that.
"It's good to know you're alive and well...
"...Well, why didn't you just say so, you bloody idiot?" I gave a nervous but earnest chuckle, lightly pushing him by the shoulder. Still, it seems strange.
Teddy looked up at us, and I could tell he understood that nothing was 'alright'.
"You love it."
"That's nice, what's his name?"
"Harry please look at me." I waited in silence for him to open his eyes, and when he did, they were clouded over, hazy.
"I slept well," he moved over so I could sit by him. "You left last night?" He asked curiously. His voice was still groggy from sleep, it was another little quirk I liked about him, how his voice changes when he wakes up. I nodded in response to his question.
"We're not taking to him right now," interrupted Scorpius. I furrowed my brows in confusion, turning to him.
"...when did you..."
"Good morning Dada! How are you!" I smiled and spun him around.
The first house that got packed was mine and Ginny's house. Ron and Hermione had shown up in her place. She was now so pregnant that they were prepared for the baby to come any day. For the most part, the packing, throwing away, and cleaning of everything was without words, making for an awkward exchange of glances if anyone ran into anyone else. We each did something until, after two days and some magic, the job was done.
"Did you see him do that today?"
"Let's enjoy the day together. We don't get to do it often enough."
"Yes?" I asked, wanting to know what this was about.
"This issue of the woman who wrote all of these books started in 1997, during your war-"
I looked around hazily. Everything was dark. I stumbled out of bed hurriedly, slamming the wall's light switch into the 'on' position. I was doubled over, feeling light headed.
Soon enough, Harry and I were in the bedroom, with the door closed, and the light on.
I watched Harry for more than a moment, observing how, outwardly, he was almost the picture of health. There were no signs of illness anywhere across his body, and it almost seemed a bit odd to have him in a hospital, required to stay the night. Then, my eyes trailed to his uncovered arms, and
While I've still managed to make sure he doesn't skip the vast majority of meals, his food intake has been decreasing steadily. It's gotten to the point where they were portions fit for Scorpius, sometimes even less. The first few times, I let it slide, thinking it was leftover tiredness because of the turmoil in his head, eyeing him carefully as he ate, and making sure he got something in. But, on the eve of the fourth night, I snapped, asking why he's eating like a bird. The problem was that I didn't say it in any manner that could be considered even remotely friendly. We argued that night, and for a few days after, we were sour towards each other. I would look at him and scowl, masking my overwhelming concern for him. He would look at me in the same way he would back at Hogwarts- with a fuming anger. But this time, I could see the pain swirling through his eyes. I hadn't seen
That was until I felt him flinch. Specifically his left arm.
The rest of the day after the incident, he told me he didn't want me to leave. We went back to my house together, and he spent the rest of the day laying down in my room, and he went by the next day just the same, he didn't speak at all either. I would join him at the times when I wasn't with Scorpius and we would cuddle for long stretches of time, some of those times I'd end up ruminating over the thought that I almost lost him.
"Would you maybe like to, I don't know... Go to- Go to the Yule Ball together?"
"Yes, it did, didn't it." I walked back towards the bed, huffing and puffing the whole way. "I can't believe it. My first interaction with Scorpius in weeks, and it was negative. He starts school tomorrow... is he even going to say goodbye at the station...?"
"So you woke up for me?" I said, my smile morphing to a smirk.
"Well then I need to know... after all, when Harry left with Teddy 8 years ago, he was married to Ginny Weasley." My face turned in disgust hearing her name.
"Harry, wai-" I couldn't reach him in time, and he disappeared with a pop. I looked around, making sure no one saw that. Thankfully, we were in an empty neighborhood. I looked to the road, swallowing. I moved my hand to the gear, and put it in drive, before cautiously making my way home.
I gave him a face. "What would you say if I told you I don't believe you?" I said.
"You ate only half of your plate." I commented, feeling my fingers thread through his soft hair.
"I don't." He said with a chuckle.
"Okay." She admitted as Harry returned with all of our wands, handing them out to us.
—Draco POV—
—Harry POV—
"But why? What happened that now suddenly it's no issue?"
Before the question of 'why' could escape my lips, he explained:
"A week ago," He replied, sounding a bit agitated and overall uncomfortable.
"Why would he freak out? You go back to our room in the middle of the night all the time." Asked Harry, looking at me through a half-asleep look of puzzlement.
the Muggle way," was his only response.
I dragged myself out of bed, not saying a word to anyone. Teddy, with one look at me, let his hair turn white. He didn't ask why my eyes were sunken, or why I couldn't look less bothered with the world. Hermione and Ron did the same. The routine of the morning went as usual, and we ended up at the park by ten o'clock instead of one o'clock, like last time.
"Just... Be there, I guess. I'll be with some people, and I hear the guest band is especially brilliant this year. Supposedly they came over from America, I'd say that's reason enough to listen to them,"
"Hey," I placed my hand on his chin, planting a small kiss on his lips. The two of us smiled silly.
I felt almost like I was dragged into the sitting area, when the truth is I probably just walked alongside Draco while he held my hand reassuringly. I swallowed. Draco pulled out a chair for me, and I had to do a double take, glancing at Dudley, almost asking for permission.
I was quite happy. And I gave him a hug, thanking him for everything. Then, I pulled out my present for him. It wasn't much, I didn't want him to be there when I got it, but my anxiety, and his over-protectiveness, prevented that from happening. So I explained that we would go to the book store within the week, and whatever books he chose, and however many, I would pay for. That way, I knew he would like it, and I wouldn't have a panic attack in the middle of a store alone. His eyes lit up at the mention of the book store. He gave me a hug, thanking me, and expressing that he could 'finally read new books after so many months'.
I woke up soon and realized I was lying down on the bed with Draco sitting beside me. There was no pillow under my head, but there was one under my feet. I looked around the room, noticing nothing odd, then turned to meet Draco's sympathetic gaze. The first thing I noticed about myself was my lack of glasses and the thumping pain on the back of my head, and on my bum.
"You know, for a second I thought you wouldn't show." Said Luca with a nervous laugh, one hiding a sort of anxious questioning I noticed he seems to do.
"What're you looking at the water for?" She asked.
"We were allowed to summon each other, too," I replied quietly, showing as little emotion as possible. "They could... summon each other."
I drew in a patient breath. "If you haven't," I continued, "I suggest you do so now before bedtime. We won't have time to do it tomorrow; as soon as Teddy gets here we're going to Kings Cross," I explained. He remained silent for a moment or two, before he carefully pushed his plate aside, hopping off of his seat, and leaving with a low and hurried mumble of "I'll go pack now."
"Oh, my poor, poor child.
—Harry POV—
"Everything is going to be okay."
"It's right here." He said, not taking his eyes off me and sliding a page towards me. "I'm gonna get Scorpius. He enjoys cooking."
"Harry, I- well, to be perfectly honest, I'm scared for you. And I don't know when your body is going to give up on you with... everything, that's happening. And, I need to express to you how important it is that you help yourself recover." I swallowed, before speaking again:
I closed my eyes when I felt his hand weave into my hair, leaning into his touch. His arm loosely around my waist and his hand in my hair. I sniffled. I felt his hand move from around my waist to my left hand, examining the scar, brushing his fingers up against it.
"Don't call her that," he bit angrily.
I'm not entirely sure how long we stayed like that, just trying to get the feeling to go away. But after that, we decided to lay down, and even though the feeling was gone, I still wanted to keep my arms up against his chest, just in case. I felt like it would come back.
heat and magic.
"Why not?" He asked incredulously.
In an instant, the quaffle was thrown, and a massive wave or cheers washed over the stadium. The players took to the skies, immediately getting to work.
"I'm sorry."
"Why... what did they mean- if he's dead, if he's gone, why would they-" his breath caught, and he shut his eyes, his tears were choked, struggling.
"You know what." I said, now angry and desperate to know- to be sure, and have secure knowledge that he's okay. I took a deep breath to calm down at least a bit, knowing that anger wouldn't help at all. "Don't say that, it's not true." I told him, growing upset at his ability to think of himself so harshly, growing sick at the thought of losing somebody else that I love. I felt my lip quiver.
"I want my parents to be there," she responded without second thought. "It's easier for them at a Muggle Hospital."
Soon, there was a feather-soft pair of lips placing a peck upon my forehead.
A short, skinny, dark tan woman around 50 years old with thick plastic glasses attached to a chain around the back of her neck and thinning dark drown hair in a loose bun came into the kitchen and made a beeline towards me and the pot of beans. Making me tense up and lean backwards into the countertop behind me, as I was now slightly cornered, before I slid out of her way.
"Why'd you ask him that? Why'd you make him mad?"
"Maria it's ok, you can go home now." He said.
"Take all the time you need dear. I love spending time with the little child. He's so sweet."
--Draco POV--
I headed past the common room and to the classroom.
Harry then spoke in a sort of nervous haste: "Drop your wand and kick it towards me."
We stood there for a while, and with each passing second I was able to feel the irritation growing and spreading.
"You can't apologize, you were right." I told him.
We stayed that way for a very long time- our hold never faltered, never got loose. We never became uncomfortable, we just, stayed. I wouldn't be surprised if we got so lost in each other's hold that we dozed off once or twice. The silence and his warmth were comforting. I felt secure, safe.
Somehow, as I grappled with this verbal confession of infatuation, I also managed to question what it all means.
I went over the next day, and I got the same result.
"Th-they're-"
"Did I wake you?"
"It was an interesting read, and if you want it for reference on our Astronomy assignment, you'll find what Professor Sinistra went over in chapter four." She said while rummaging through her bag. She turned around and handed me the large and heavy book.
Molly was crying into Aurthur's shoulder, and Ginny was off to the side with Charlie. Her face pale, and visibly holding back tears, with the same shock-ridden expression she had the day she found me in the bathtub with a knife. So
As I walked the halls, my thoughts trailed to Luca, everything about him- how he laughs, the way he plays with his metamorphmagus, to make me laugh when I'm down, how we always do everything together...
"More than half of them are in Azkaban anyway-"
"I promise I'm okay," he said. "Madame Pomfrey said it's okay. She helped me understand what happened to me." A certain tremble passed along my insides when he assured me that he was okay. I was relieved, and felt almost happy.
"Yes, I've thought ahead... No wonder I have top marks in Divination," he huffed, shaking his head.
"Then what is it?" The shaking got so bad that it was now a constant tremor coursing through my entire body. I knew Draco could feel it, but I couldn't stop it for my own good. I almost wanted to double over from the hunger pains that had become more apparent as the days had passed- that I had been ignoring for forever now.
"What about him?" The blond boy asked.
"Of course. Let's all sleep at Grimmauld Place the night before, so we can travel the next morning-oh. We're leaving here at midnight- the beginning of the 26th, and show up over there at 7pm on the 25th. Time zones."
"I know but I just... I was looking for a sign that Sirius might have forgiven me or that it was okay and the silence it just... and then the nurse closed the curtains to the window and-" He stopped talking, just squeezing me tighter, wanting to be closer.
"Remember Teddy's tutor gets here at 8. Ok?" I nodded again, still half asleep. "Alright. It's 6:30. Remember to call me if anything." I nodded again. Not having the energy to speak yet. "Goodbye."
Tell me what y'all think! And most importantly...
"Harry?" That was Draco's voice.
I saw everyone get to the table taking their seats and went towards them all. To think that we hadn't seen each other in 10 years, and never in a good circumstance, it was odd to think of a dinner party with two Weasley's, Granger, and Potter.
Cautiously, I inched towards the bowl, hesitant to take a breath. Thankfully, the egg was gone. An enormous breath of relief took me over as I went to take over breakfast until whoever was cooking came back.
"I was just thinking about... something I overheard at the book store. It was nothing important."
"Goodbye. We have to get together more often. Being magical has its advantages. Living a country over can't stop a night of dinner." Said Granger to Weaslette.
Now though, we were sitting together on the couch, listening to a random radio station. Scorpius and Teddy has fallen asleep together in Teddy's bedroom so Harry and I decided it would be easiest for us to stay over. Right now, things were relaxing. The radio was playing soft music. Suddenly, I got an idea. Something that would switch things up from the usual. I tapped on Harry, who was leaning on me.
"Scorpius?" Harry moved a little closer. I didn't move. Maybe I don't need to do this. Maybe I don't need to wipe my legs, find new trousers, or hide the covers. I don't think I need to seem strong for Dada. I felt a tear go down my cheek. At this, Harry flinched and backed away a little.
"Yeah, as if you were smart enough to get into it!"
"I shouldn't have said what I did. I struck a cord, and what I said was inaccurate and out of context." I admitted.
"Good morning, Teddy! We're going to be late, c'mon!"
My vision moved between our hands, clasped together, and his eyes, piercing into mine with a soft sort of sincerity. Those eyes were saying only one thing:
"Shh... those things could have never been your fault, Scor... Please listen to me," Dada asked over and over. I couldn't even hear myself think.
"Am I one of those mistakes?" I heard him say under his breath. It was as if he had just driven a stake through my heart.
"Would you like some?" I offered.
"I didn't think Ginny liked women..." Harry's response was just as quiet as mine, if not more. I willed myself to turn away from the snogging pair, to Harry. He seemed to do the same.
"Good morning. What's wrong?" I started, going over to sit at his bedside.
Bonnie, Wendy, Luca and I, along with a mass of other students, walked a long way to what looked like a rise in the mountains, until we got to an opening in a ridge. From what we could see from this considerable distance, there was a large stone mount, with screeches reverberating out to the stadium. People oohed and ahed, and excitable screams were heard each time the dragon gave out its strangely musical screech.
"Well, of course, but I'm worried for him, doctor," I confessed. "It's difficult... what's going on."
"You're in Slytherin!" She huffed, crossing her arms. Luca turned his head back, facing the stadium once again. He slowly turned his head towards her; his eyes bore no emotion, but he wore a smirk. He tucked his curls behind his ear.
"I- okay, but, he's a kid! A kid with his own worries and issues and I just... He let those kids hurt him. He
"No? I didn't think it was important." He said, nonchalant. I stared at him for a second, before looking back out the window at the family, who was now approaching the front door.
"And what Scorpius is coming to be, it's all because of you, and how incredible of a father you've been. I don't think you're misguiding him, I think you're doing just fine. And I don't think living in the Muggle world will change how Scorpius turns out." I finished.
"Are you okay?"
"What?! No. Keep going please?" I whined with a pout.
"So, how come you never mentioned Victorie last year? I remember hearing her get sorted," Luca asked, walking beside me.
"Dad, I can't find my shoes!"
"Yes."
It was really quite entertaining to watch him. I don't think I've ever seen him let loose this way. I didn't know if it was the fact that we were in the Muggle World, or the fact that we were kilometers and kilometers from England, or just one of the ways he's changed over time, or perhaps a strange mixture of all three. Regardless, watching him smiling and happy and energetic and
"I met someone, his name is Rolf. He's a Magizoologist, like me." said Luna in her usually calm tone, wearing a gentle smile.
"Oh Scor... this is nothing! You'll be fine. You just need a small washing up and I'll heal you right up."
—Harry POV—
"Sure, Scor." He left the room, tiny feet stomping the ground rapidly as he held his crotch area. "You better wash those hands of yours!" Draco shouted at his now distant son. He soon turned back to me. "Do you really want to take that chance again? Stop- before you answer, really think about this. We've been doing okay- things are calm right now. Are you really willing to risk that?"
"Are you
Keeping everything to myself again had dragged me into a sort of familiar turmoil within my mind. I almost casually walked through the tar in my brain as I entertained my self-deprecating thoughts and the eternally pulling gravity of the situation occurring outside the relative yet false safety of four walls of the guest bedroom. I'd have panic attacks silently, alone, and they'd leave me so completely and utterly drained that I couldn't bring myself to speak or scream or scratch or cut; I simply stayed in the corner of the room, staring into the empty distance, maybe even falling asleep, letting a few silent, careless, effortless tears slip.
"Ted..." She whispered as both of us stood in front of our desks. I faced her for a few moments, but the reflection of the classroom's firelit lamps on her face, her eyes, was too much for me to bear. I glanced away, gulping, taking a hold of my materials.
"Yes, I understand that. And I encourage it. It's a good thing for you to be able to have family relations. But we are not talking about Dudley, here. We are talking about his parents-"
"Can you just shut up and hug me?" I asked in a cracked whisper, finally turning to face him, revealing myself fully.
"Hey!" Ouch. Still, I couldn't keep myself from laughing along with Luca and Gabriel.
"At least I didn't get drunk... I know. I... I ordered a glass this morning too. I kind of want another."
"Yeah. It's interesting." I responded. He gave me a playful shove.
Mind floating weightlessly in space. The pastel splashes of the universe painting an eternal canvas.
"I don't want to talk about it Hermione." I said while shooting into a sitting position.
"I know, right? But it'll taste good!" He said confidently before muttering under his breath "If I don't fuck it up."
"Good morning, Mr. Lupin. Take a seat, please. I've got news for you."
Scorpius only continued violently shoveling food into his mouth, staring at me. It took all of my strength not to challenge him with my own stare.
Every exhale pained my chest, and every inhale scratched at my throat. I felt familiar strong hands wrapping around me.
Can we stay like this? Just us?" I whispered, our foreheads resting on one another's.
hot. And he's never really been one for painting or singing, and he's a rubbish dancer." Draco and I both chuckled slightly at the last bit.
"They're all younger than me." He sniffled. "That still leaves a good three years of bullying."
Tall, silver hair styled to perfection, olive skin that was just flawless. She's the girl who gave me the black eye. I shuffled further into my seat. Change your face. Hopefully she won't recognize you. I closed my eyes, concentrating. Make my face smaller, more round. Green eyes, not brown. Change my hair. Make it shorter, make it Weasley-red.
"Why did I do that? Why was I so... so,
I thought to myself.
—Teddy POV—
, I thought as I reached around to make the process easier on myself. I was slightly startled to fall forward onto something. I opened my eyes and realized Draco was right in front of me, hugging me.
