The barrister the Malfoy family fortune had paid for refuted the charges to the best of his ability, the bulk of his argument resting on the fact that Draco had been underage for most of his crimes. But the faces of the Wizengamot had been etched in stone, and all pleas fell on deaf ears. The gavel had fallen, and Draco was guilty.
go into the Department and not my Ravenclaw sister?” Her tone indicated he wasn't the first to insinuate she was the less-clever twin. “After the war, I found myself questioning everything. Life, death, fate. I wanted answers.” They turned down a dim hall with sparkles in the air like stars, and Harry knew this must contain the Space room. Further on was Fate and Prophecy; he steeled himself against the memories he would face, but they continued past it.
Hermione reached for the potion, but Draco intercepted it. "No, I'll take it up to him." He wanted to escape Granger, who could interrogate him with nothing more than a look.
The Floo at Inisview opened into the small parlour. Draco sneezed, momentarily overcome by the combination of soot and dust, and made a mental note to prioritise chimney cleaning next.
“Soon you’ll be harassing people with Hermione.” Harry watched him go, then turned back to see Parvati’s expectant face.
"But all of their mothers are dead," Draco said with a sick fascination. "I thought it strange when I was younger, but..." But he hadn't cared about anyone else's pain when he was a child. Why should he? He had everything.
You probably have some epic, world-saving reason for asking.” Her voice was teasing. “So you’ll speak to Oliver?”
The wonder in Harry's eyes had been worth the wait. "I was too afraid to say it before," Draco admitted. "And then the time didn't seem right. But I do. I love you, Harry."
“It’s a nice place, yeah?” he said, gesturing at the house. It was three stories tall, maybe a quarter the size of the Manor, although Draco knew well that looks could be deceiving when it came to size in wizarding homes. The outside walls were covered in stones of various sizes which were worked into the mortar, giving the house a rustic look. The roof was pitched with a flat top, probably a viewing deck for watching the sea. Several more rose bushes crowded along the northern wall, and Draco supposed the rest of the garden must lay behind the house.
Harry reached out and grasped Draco by the arm. "You could never belong to anyone but yourself, Draco. Even when I found you at the farm, and you were depressed and defeated after almost two years of loneliness, you were still ready to meet me with words or fists."
Draco watched in confusion as the elf went to draw him a bath. Creatures under the Imperius curse weren't supposed to react like that. Maybe he was losing his touch. That particular Unforgivable had always tasted bad to him, like a film laid on his tongue as he gave orders.
"That is my full name," he threw over his shoulder. Politeness no longer mattered. He hoped he never had to return here.
Harry began sleeping in Draco's room every night. After a week, the Manor hadn't moved their suites into one, but Harry's small amount of toiletries had appeared in the ensuite, along with another wardrobe. Draco took that as a good sign. His mood improved, as did his sleeping patterns.
“That was a great present, mate,” Ron said, coming up behind Harry with a fresh drink in his hand. “Only, did you have to get him Bridger? Are you trying to turn him into a Magpie’s fan?”
At lunch on Sunday (his second in as many weeks; Molly could be terrifying when she wanted to be) Ginny had grilled him mercilessly for details on his budding — friendship? — with Draco. Harry didn’t have much more to tell her. He’d talked more about himself during the game, he realised, and had learned very little new information about Draco’s life. He couldn’t shake the feeling that Draco was hiding something — a familiar enough feeling, given their history, but one Harry wasn’t happy to revisit.
"Ugh." Potter sank down under one of the leafier oaks and picked at the grass. "I don't live anywhere, really. I stay with the Weasleys a lot, but it's not
"So I'm to be sent away to keep them quiet, is that it? Is my sentence longer or shorter than Mother's?" He was already picturing it: the cold sea air, the long stretches of solitude. Perhaps they would be allowed to visit each other in the lonely stone prison.
Eyeing the bowl questioningly, Harry made his way back to the most recent names on the tree. "What's that for?"
The world blurred, and after the familiar experience of being squeezed down to nothing and forming again with a ‘pop,’ resolved into a stark landscape of rocks and low brush. Gone were the trees and the half-sleepy owls of the park; in their place were chattering seagulls and a carpet of grass, dotted here and there with golden yellow wildflowers. Off to the left lay a small cluster of ruined buildings, and all before Draco stretched the wide, roiling sea.
“Don’t be a martyr. You’re a fresh turn, you need to feed for the next week to get your feet under you. After that you can decide what to do.” Draco’s tone brooks no argument, and Potter, still weak and under the influence of the potion, slumps in defeat.
"But it does make culture, make heritage. And I'm still part of that, you wretch." His voice broke, and Harry stepped towards him, hands out placatingly, obviously feeling sorry he'd said such a thing.
As the water began to boil, Potter finally spoke. "I've been here less than a half hour and we already had a row."
"Huh." Harry tried to picture it: Malfoy bent over a dusty book, blond hair falling into his face, tongue poked out like Hermione's when she was concentrating on a particularly challenging puzzle. His mental image made him blush hotly. “Don’t you know anyone else?”
“No! Not even evidence of any. No bones, no mummified flesh, not even any wrappings that would indicate a body had been there once.” Draco shuddered visibly at the mention of bodies.
Leaving Harry's spankable arse behind him, Draco visits the apothecary and picks up a loaf of crusty bread and some cheese before the market closes. He eats it on the balcony while waiting for sunset, clad only in a loose robe ‘liberated’ from the hotel. The clanging bells of the boats, the pealing laughs of the cafe patrons, the soft putter of motorbikes — Draco has become used to the city over the past few weeks. There’s a comfort in the strange local language, the hearty food. It’s especially nice being left alone to his own devices.
"No, he never gets sick. And eats like a champ," Potter smiled, obviously proud. "Although that's really-" He quieted for a moment. "That's really Molly's doing," he finished.
Realisation dawned on Draco. "You gave up your ability to have any more children in order to guarantee your first was a boy. That I was a boy."
Potter is shaking again, but it’s not like when he was lying in the tunnel. It looks more like a panic attack about to begin.
"I think Holkey has seen worse than us en déshabillé." Harry nevertheless got out of bed and retrieved his clothes.
Eyes wide, Luna stared at him in that way that made Harry feel as if he were a particularly interesting specimen of Wrackspurt. "As a career."
"And you." Draco bent down to retrieve the holly wand from the floor, and held it out. "Here. Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking when I suggested you go there, you can't have fond memories of the place."
Harry scoffed, and Hermione hid a small laugh behind her hand. “It’s true, isn’t it? That’s certainly not the first letter you’ve received from Malfoy.”
“Not you, too,” Harry groaned. “Look, Malfoy supposedly knows his stuff, so we’ll have him examine the sword and that’s it.”
Harry reluctantly backed off, running his hand over the one leg that was bared to him. Slowly and deliberately, he unwrapped the robe from around Draco’s hip, exposing the rest of his body. His cock was flushed rosy pink at the tip, peeking from the foreskin, and Harry licked his lips.
Tonight’s benefit for the current cause de jour is in a much bigger venue. Harry had felt so badly about disappearing on Hermione at the last one that he’s made a sizable donation in order to get four tickets. Hermione was grateful; Ron not so much. His opinion changed as soon as he saw the large table of hors d’oeuvres.
Jack's small eyes zeroed in on the Dark Mark, and he reached out to grasp Draco's wrist, pulling him in. "Bloody hell, look at that. It's like it's... eating it." His grip tightened to the point of pain as he turned Draco's arm this way and that, twisting the skin until the snake almost writhed. "I'd never seen one. I always wondered." He dropped Draco's arm, leaving a small red mark where his thumb had dug into the skin to complement the black ink.
"You aren't a very riveting conversationalist, are you? No wonder Harry seems to be going mad. Here's a secret: I know how he feels."
“Even after snogging?” Parvati looked across the room at Draco, who was leaning over Drover and talking animatedly while the other man nodded.
The cobwebs in the winding tunnel are thick, and Draco presses a hand against his face to avoid inhaling them. He hates places like this: catacombs, basements, caves. They remind him of the dark, hidden places beneath the Manor.
“Together?” Draco laughed. “I need your instructions, and I’ll check in with you, but I have things well in hand. This is what I do, after all.”
"Doing the right thing? Yeah, that does matter to me." Potter had started to slowly circle the table toward Draco. "Guess you don't care about that, huh? You only care about yourself."
"You wanna come?" Draco nodded vigorously. "I know you need more than this, so you'll just have to wait for me to finish."
A tug at his senses — someone was trying the wards. Paparazzi? No, he'd chased those off months ago with a visit to the Prophet’s offices. He smiled as he remembered how their shady reporters had scrambled to get out of his way. No one would bother him here anymore, which meant the wards were being tested from the inside.
“So, we’re friends. Who are attracted to each other. Who don’t seem to want anyone else.” Harry laughs, and throws his arms up. “Am I just being dense?”
sordid, no matter what other people might say — because he’s growing lightheaded and needs to ease Potter off again.
“You know I supported you,” Ron frowns. “I was surprised when you two started getting friendly, yeah, but when you told me it had gone past that, I figured I’d better get used to him, make an effort to be nice. But
“Everyone knows that. Even if Rita Skeeter hadn’t written three books already, Narcissa Malfoy’s testimony is public record. She lied and said you were dead, because she blamed Voldemort for her son’s death.”
“Much as I’d love to, I have an early morning. I leave for Madrid tomorrow, remember? It’s a Saturday Portkey.” Harry does remember, and although he will miss Draco for the week, he also meant it when he said how proud he was of the career Draco has built for himself.
“Would you have listened?” Harry asked, bemused. Draco pursed his lips, but didn’t argue, which was all the answer Harry needed.
"No!" Julian chimed in gleefully, contradictorily tossing his own piece of fruit over the side of his chair.
There was nothing evidently different about the room at first glance. Draco set Julian on one of the velvet lounges and scanned the tables. Eventually he spotted it: the phonograph was set up, a record in place under the raised arm, already spelled to begin playing as soon as Draco pushed the needle in place. The small black circle had a picture of an apple on it. Draco didn't bother to read the words as he lowered the arm.
“I didn’t find any real force,” Draco cautioned. “There were multiple layers of mental and emotion-based spells, though. It began with a calming spell, similar to the Draught we’re familiar with. That’s what we felt first, the disorientation. There was also an effect that I’ve only seen in potions, that functions similar to alcohol.”
Draco was baffled. "You tried to hold him for the Dark Lord. What does he owe you?" If anything, Draco owed
All of Draco's hopes dissolved as he gazed at the little glowing ball in despair. "It's still mine," he said hoarsely. "I still want it."
Slowly, almost reverently, he opened the door. Everything was just as she left it: delicate glass bottles on the vanity, powder puffs, even her hairbrush, still tangled with golden strands. Draco skirted around the door that led to the bedroom itself, unwilling to see if Holkey had successfully cleaned the blood off the floor, and settled down on a chaise beside the window. A pink silk robe was laid over the back, and he picked it up hesitantly.
“I’m not sure it was the best idea.” Draco is speaking softly, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes. “Last night, you accused me of leading you on. I wasn’t, not back then, and I don’t want you to feel as if I am now. It wasn’t my intention to… to dangle myself in front of you and then pull away.”
Draco began pacing. “I’ve got my life set up how I like it, you know. I don’t need all this. You’ve this desperate need for new things, I was just next on your list of conquests.”
Harry took a bite of his sloppy marmalade bread and chewed thoughtfully before swallowing. "Why would you want to?"
"Andromeda and Bella argued frequently. And then there was Andi and my parents, Sirius and his parents, Sirius and
“Not on paper.” Draco leans back against the old metal desk in the room as he begins to wrap his wrist up.
Once naked, Harry seemed to hesitate. He crawled slowly up Draco’s body, and laid a soft kiss on his lips. “Can I…?” he asked, pressing himself down so that Draco’s cock slipped along his arse.
Feeling drained, Draco stilled beneath Harry, who ground down on his softening prick and whined. He was obviously very close. “Come here,” Draco said once he caught his breath, and pulled Harry towards his face. “Come on me, just like this. Make me yours.”
"She always seemed to like you. When did you break up?" There was something nasty in Potter's voice.
It’s not like Harry hasn’t seen the latest Muggle fashions. He reads magazines, he goes out for boys’ nights at the dodgy places Seamus picks, and while the patrons won’t be on the cover of
Draco nodded faintly. "I'd like to be excused to my room, please." He felt dizzy; if he was going to fall apart, he should do it out of sight of his mother, shouldn't he?
“Er, I’ve got it!” Harry waved his wand and both the leeks and pies began levitating. “We’ll be right out!”
The coolness of Harry’s vampire body is soothing in the summer night as they curl into each other. As Draco drifts off, he thinks that this wouldn't be quite so satisfying with anyone else. But possessing Harry, the boy whose friendship eluded Draco for so many years, the man who upended his life repeatedly, is far too tempting to resist. He tightens his hold.
As much as Draco believed in self-preservation, he could not deny that a world under Voldemort was not a world he wanted to see.
“Self-pity isn’t attractive, you know.” Harry blushed at his own choice of words, and rushed past them. “Stop trying to push me away, its not working. I know you’re attempting to move on.”
Draco scoffed. "No wonder you feel uncomfortable there. It hasn't been passed on in a proper manner. It must have been left to you in a will, and the wards left down, but you haven't really taken it over. It probably makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck, yes?"
"I'm sure you know my parents are dead." Even after all this time, speaking the words aloud was like a cold knife being slipped in his ribs.
secret. Draco was aware that if his father were still alive, it would have been a source of anguish for him, and his relationship with Harry would be an impossibility. But freed from any familial expectation, Draco had decided firmly to not judge his new found sexual preferences too closely, because what did they matter? He was very accomplished in not thinking about worrisome things, after all.
“You’re full of questions for supposedly being so sleepy,” Harry teased. “Come on, I’ll tell you all about it on our walk.”
In all honesty, Harry’s not sure why he bothers with plates. Takeaway always arrives in little containers, with plastic spoons or chopsticks. Kreacher might give him the hairy eyeball when he digs into a carton of noodles while sitting on the sofa, but Kreacher is in a worse mood than usual these days. Harry knows he misses Draco, too, in his own way; no more
"What about witches like Hermione?" Harry persisted. "Her parents are Muggle. Should she never see them again?"
"Why are you helping me, Cora?" Draco asked suddenly. She had eyed him just as suspiciously as every other nurse and Healer on the secure ward; sometimes people shook their heads, or glanced at his left arm before turning quickly away.
" Hermione pointed her wand and summoned the ball before the witch could change her mind. In the same instant, the wizard raised his own wand while she was occupied and and wordlessly cast a spell that froze Hermione in place. The ball flew towards them and Harry, ever the Seeker, snatched it out of the air. He held the glowing ball reverently, his eyes wide with wonder, before turning back toward the Unspeakables.
That was not a conversation Harry was looking forward to. “I almost don’t want to know, at this point,” he admitted. “I never gave him his wand back —”
“Potter, are you telling me…” Malfoy’s wide eyes seemed translucent, as they had on their long walk to the end.
“Oh, get over yourself, Potter. I’m not a weak little kitten.” Potter’s wide, almost wet eyes stared at Draco guiltily, and he felt the need to reassure him. “That was fairly close to how I like things normally, so don’t fret. I didn’t choose the situation, and I most definitely would not have chosen to have my partner be unwilling, but I wasn’t a virgin. I’m not saying I don’t feel violated”—and Potter made a sad noise at that—“but I don’t blame
Hands shaking, Draco undid Harry's belt and pulled out his cock. “I’m not sure what you expect me to do.”
of course, never to Potter.) Same messy, almost black hair, same piercing glance. No matter how much fuss the papers made about the green, Draco didn’t think it was the colour of Potter’s eyes that made him seem so intense. It was unnerving, being fixed under that stare again after so many years.
“Well I don’t know who else it could be. Unless…” The gleam in her eye said she had been working up to this. “It’s Potter.”
"I suppose," Granger answered. "I do think you needed to move. But now I'm wondering if you shouldn't have just bought your own house, a new one."
Potter seemed twitchy, and kept glancing toward the door. "Never mind. Look, I didn't mean to be gone so long. Can I come back tomorrow, or the day after?"
with it,” Harry flung back, offended. “Are you not out?” No way was Draco inexperienced, last night had shown Harry that.
"And I have explained all that to you," Harry growled. "Don't pretend you didn't understand it. Actually, you seemed to understand it better than Ginny." He laughed, and it was hollow. "She would feel justified in that, I think."
Facing Harry, Narcissa took a deep breath; obviously what she had to say pained her. “It goes without saying that I cannot repay you, Mr. Potter. I will be forever indebted to you. Myself and —”
Draco spent the rest of the day spoiling Julian, giving him every favourite treat and toy. When Harry returned that night, both Malfoys were ensconced in the nursery reading.
“I should… get back to work.” Draco pulled his robes on slowly. “Potions to stir. Brewing waits for no lunch break, you know.”
Pansy rolled her eyes skyward before pouring another mimosa. “I admit nothing. Now tell me why this vile rag is on the table.”
The studio was painted the same light blue colour as the hall. It was rather small, but built-in shelves added to the storage space. The loo was simple, with only a shower. Draco nodded as Miss Rollins went over the plan and showed him where the appliances were located, a mixture of magical and Muggle.
Draco released a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. A small part of him was still filled with doubts, but as long as Harry didn’t regret this, he was hopeful. “Me too,” he said, rolling onto his side to look at Harry. “That was amazing.
They picked up where they left off, with the last of the guest bedrooms. Neither took a second look at the door to the rose room when they passed by, choosing to immerse themselves in cleaning instead. Draco was pleased that their conversation was less stilted than that first day back after the… incident, even if it wasn’t as free-flowing as before.
His performance would have shamed even his teenage self; in under two minutes, Draco was coming in his pants.
"But won't that be revealed at the actual hearing?" Narcissa's teacup trembled imperceptibly in her hand.
Reaching over for a pasty, Draco arched an eyebrow, an expression that looked so at home on his face Harry felt a mild deja-vu. “He wanted to close, eh?”
"It doesn't." Draco knew how papers operated. Harry's threats would only spur them on, make them think he had something to hide. "I suppose that cat's out of the bag, then. Will it affect your joining the Aurors eventually?"
“Yes, but… weren’t you going to take it?” Draco certainly can’t snatch the jacket from Harry. He gets whatever he wants: free brooms and robes from people seeking his endorsement,
people. I think they may have gone AWOL. Keep an eye out, will you?” Harding hates Robards — although Draco has never found out why — and he’d do anything to make the Head Auror look bad at his job.
Seized abruptly with a manic desire he snatched up a pair of scissors from the drawer and hacked at his platinum locks. Holkey appeared from nowhere in the doorway of the bathroom and cried for Master to let her help, but he ignored her. The
The edges of Harry's vision went dark, and he quickly pulled his own trousers and pants down to his knees. Draco tried to sit up in alarm. “Wait, Potter —” Harry shoved him backwards and held him down with one hand, while jerking himself with the other. “Stay still,” he said, harsher than he intended, and Draco’s ears flattened in submission. Harry growled at the sight, and came harder than he had in ages, all over Draco’s shirt. A few stray drops spattered his pointed chin.
“Who?” Draco busies himself pulling several bottles and a length of bandages out of a satchel he’d stashed in this room before going beneath the house.
All week, Harry went to work and tried to find out more information about Draco. No one had reported him missing, and no one seemed to know what he did for work or play. It was as if he’d disappeared off the face of the earth.
Sitting on the windowsill was the largest, most terrifying owl Harry had ever laid eyes on. It glared at him and scratched at the glass, emitting one baleful hoot.
Harry restrained himself from kissing Draco as his eyes lit up with excitement, detailing all the strange things computers could do. “I think that’s brilliant.”
All that Draco could hear was pounding - the pounding of his feet as he ran breakneck down the hall, the pounding of the storm outside, the pounding of his fist against his parents' bedroom door. The sharp cracking noise had echoed throughout the house, and both elves also came scrambling out from wherever they'd been to look for the source. They nearly tripped Draco as he came to a halt.
The awareness of his developing erection breaks through the haze of pain and surprising pleasure and Draco remembers that a hard-on requires blood, something he’s rapidly losing. Gently he presses back on Potter’s forehead until he releases Draco’s wrist, retracting his fangs more delicately than expected. Potter’s eyes are wide, his pupils fully blown, and he mouths at the air for a moment before coming back to himself.
In his experience, Hermione would eventually figure everything out. Maybe it was best to get ahead of her. Harry gathered his scattered pages and tried to act nonchalant.
Malfoy shivered at the mention of the Fiendfyre. He moved away from the window, and Harry backed up to let him pass, wondering when they’d gotten so close. He found he didn’t want their conversation to be over, but Malfoy was looping a cloak around his shoulders, apparently ready to leave. He seemed edgy, as if he wanted to put some distance between Harry and himself. Was he thinking about the threads?
They head to the cafe across the street, where Harry is delighted to learn that he can still eat human food if he wishes, even if it doesn’t sustain him. He licks the thick sour cream from the lángos off his fingers, and Draco has to adjust his trousers yet again. Afterwards they share a single shot of fruit brandy; Draco doesn’t want to thin his blood out. The act of caring for someone, of thinking ahead for more than a day and planning how best to be there for someone, is novel for him.
"Then you are useless to me." Harry slipped both their wands into his pocket. "I'll leave these in a file cabinet for you."
sitting there on the bed, flushed with life and full of Draco’s blood, wearing Draco’s clothes, saying Draco’s
“That’s what I’ve always wanted to know. For a long time, I assumed it was because he’d only just died, and I’d been there. But there was something else.”
“You don’t have to.” God, Cam was going to kill him if he’d stuck around for nothing. Harry was usually so good at reading a pull.
"I don't call him that," Potter added. "He can use Malfoy when he's older, if he wants to." He cocked his head at Draco. "You don't, do you? When you answered the door. You said 'not anymore.' What did you mean?"
Harry takes from him now as he does when biting, swallowing Draco’s come as if it can sustain him just the same.
He'd run through a thousand terrible scenarios by the time Harry appeared in the doorway. "Hey," he whispered, trying not to wake Julian. "Let's go outside."
Pansy was leaning against the door frame, the smuggest smile Draco had ever seen (and that was saying something) stretched across her face. “I wanted to ask if there was any more wine. Are you boys busy?”
an only child then, if you didn't have the same issue?" He wasn't sure he wanted to hear the answer.
“Are you watching me sleep?” Draco asks with a small yawn. Harry smiles and glides over to the bed, sinking down onto the blankets Draco has kicked off in the heat.
This room was in slightly better shape than the others, having been treated with the most potent spells. Most of the furniture was gone, but there was still dust to be swept away and linens to be cleaned, and Draco went straight to work. Potter was less industrious, stopping often to catch a breath of fresh air out on the balcony.
“I dunno. I run, do pull-ups, that sort of thing. After running up and down the stairs at Hogwarts for so many years, sitting still doesn’t feel right.” Harry was no stranger to being admired, but people were usually looking at his scar, not his physique. He decided not to roll his sleeves back down.
Draco searched Potter’s face for any sign of anger; he didn’t find any. “Do you want me to?” he asked, dreading the answer, unsure of what he wanted himself.
Julian was splashing in the fountain, energetic after his first visit to Fortescue's reopened ice cream parlour in Diagon Alley. The three of them still drew strange looks sometimes, but Draco was no longer worried to be out in public with Harry, or even on his own.
“I wish things had been different, too. And if we weren’t already interested at least somewhat, I’d agree with you. But…” Draco sat up straighter and braced himself for rejection. “I think it’s worse to let that ruin what we
"What the fuck kind of question is that, Potter? I'm miles from home, without my wand, trying to make peace with
The drag of Harry's cock against his own had Draco edging closer than he wanted. Mercifully Harry nodded down at him. "I'm ready." Draco slowly pulled his fingers out and gripped his cock, holding it still for Harry.
Draco whined impatiently, and sat up; Harry backed away, worried he had moved too fast, but Draco only shrugged the robe off and laid back down, pulling Harry with him. His legs were still tangled in the fabric, but Harry was sure he wasn’t wearing pants. He escaped Draco’s grasp long enough to fling his own shirt somewhere in the corner.
Draco starts, and he stares at Harry in shock. Harry continues, the truth burning on his tongue. “Most of the time we were becoming friends, we were casually fucking, too. I realised I was attracted to you as soon as we started talking again, and I think that’s what helped me get over our history.”
have been resignation in her tone, but Draco wasn't well-versed in her emotions enough to be sure. Her face was inscrutable as she licked the drop of honey from her finger. How could she so calmly describe such a monumental decision?
Draco is going to have to make a decision fast. The sight of Harry on his knees — oh, who is he kidding, the decision is already made.
“You look different,” Malfoy pointed out. Harry didn’t respond to that; he didn’t want to deal with the five-year time gap while they were still trying to save Malfoy’s life.
"Out of tune," Harry mused. "That's a good way to describe Grimmauld. It's like if someone plays a phonograph at slightly the wrong speed."
"The Carrows never went to prison, same as Yaxley and Travers. And Jugson wasn't there the first time around, nor were Selwyn or Rolwe. They are all Marked, though. They'll be sentenced to life in Azkaban. You
—Draco managed to say, “I would think that it’s obvious I’ve changed. We couldn’t be friends if I hadn’t.”
Afterwards, Harry lay awake, staring at the ceiling as shadows crossed it. Draco was on the bed beside him, having dozed off almost immediately.
“Well, you saw Mum and Dad pretty recently, and nothing is new with them. Bill sent us a postcard from Peru, and it looks brilliant there. Oh! And a new dragon hatched out in Romania!”
planning to use it as a main residence? That will affect what kind of wards I ultimately set, the kind that are elastic enough to withstand opening and closing often, or ones that act more like Stasis Charms.”
take as Harry filled him with come and then continued to lazily move his hips back and forth. Tears of frustration streamed down Draco's face as Harry finally reached up for the gag.
"If he even comes back." Draco quieted. "How did you know? When you left for Bavaria. How did you know it was the right thing to do?"
"I had thought we might take breakfast in the conservatory, but the weather does not wish to cooperate."
The second witch stepped up, and pointed her own wand at Draco. The tugging sensation from before grew stronger and stronger, until it felt like his very breath was being pulled from his body. The wizard picked up one of the dull glass balls and held it aloft as it began to glow, and Draco knew what was happening.
"You must never reveal that you saw me down here this morning." Holkey nodded, and then the light returned to her eyes. She gave him a disapproving look, one Draco had never seen on a Malfoy elf.
"Oh, Draco," she sighed unhappily. "No. This is our fault. You're my child, I should have protected you."
The entrance to the small underground chamber was hidden behind a riot of bushes and heather. “Come on, through here,” Harry instructed, moving a stone slab aside and making his way down the sloping entrance. Draco followed behind more cautiously.
Maybe he’s starved by now. Maybe Draco won’t have to make the decision. He will, however, have to account for Potter’s whereabouts now that Harding is sniffing around. But the thought of dragging Potter’s desiccated corpse over the rough brick and into the light makes Draco swallow in disgust.
The Harpies’ pitch had two Apparation points, one for the public and one for invited guests of the team. Harry was allowed to use the latter, and noticed Malfoy eye him sceptically, almost disappointed, at their isolation, as if Harry had been lying. To prove him wrong, Harry tugged him by the wrist through a small crowd of other player’s friends and families.
Perhaps it was mental, but who did it hurt? Draco repeated the name of the town slowly under his breath, syllable by syllable, calming his nerves.
"You and I don't have a great track record of being civil on brooms, even when not frightened for our lives."
you so calm, half the time, if the last two years have been such a nightmare? How do you take care of Julian so well?" Draco waved a hand at Potter's startled face. "You do, and you must know that."
"I know, I was there. He made me tell the story a hundred times." Malfoy shuddered. “Does that mean he has to kill Snape, then? He’ll do it, he doesn’t care about any of us.”
"That's terribly biased. What about a husband?" Draco sputtered, but Granger continued talking. "His magic is presenting quite early, then. What if he'd been a Squib?"
“Well, they used to be rival seekers. Probably had a bet or something on the game. Oh! Another goal!”
“And yet he kissed you?” Parvati rolled her eyes. “Please, Harry, you’re just talking yourself in circles at this point. You like him, you’re attracted to him, he likes you back, he’s given you all the signals. Ask him out to dinner and kiss him proper at the end.”
, Potter?” He scrunched his nose at the pointed look on Harry’s face. “Oh, don’t tell me you expect me to call you
"There are blood wards a thousand years old on this house. They can take it, sell it, use it as a Muggle hotel for all they like, but it would never reveal its secrets or be properly useful as long as a Malfoy lives and breathes. Yet without our magic to work the wards, it might be possible."
The thing on the ground rolls over, shimmering fabric bunching underneath. Two hands now, clawing at the air, and then twitching legs and a gasping face. Draco knows that face.
“I’m up,” Malfoy grumbled, before yawning widely. Harry took a quick look at his teeth, but they still appeared human. The sight of Malfoy’s tongue had warmth curling up the base of his spine.
“Malfoy, I need you to stay calm.” Harry held one hand out in a placating manner. He couldn’t resist a quick peek at Malfoy’s wrist, and his own, but no threads had appeared. “We aren’t dead, and you aren’t, either.”
“Well, you never told me!” Draco’s lips thin into a hard line, and Harry remembers what he said at the cafe.
She motioned towards the chair. “Sit, Harry.” He did as he was told. “After we spoke last time, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Everything we know about the Resurrection Stone involves the bearer summoning a shade on purpose. You didn’t consciously call for Malfoy, it
“About that mean little stunt you pulled on her, I’d wager.” Malfoy began buttoning again, very deliberately.
Draco felt immensely guilty for the Mark, even if he was talking to a house. "It fought against me."
Draco stopped peering down the aisles and turned back to Harry. “The Leaky, I suppose. I’m going to London to look at flats.”
As July crept toward its finish, Draco visited the gardens. It was too late in the year to plant anything new, but there was still maintenance work he could accomplish, and plans he could make for next year. It was the first time in a long while that Draco could recall looking forward to something - to planning that far ahead. It had also been jarring, going from doing hard work all day in the orchard, and then back to a life of relative ease in the Manor. The ennui made him anxious.
“No matter, You’re the one who missed out on cherry goodness.” Draco looks down at the stain on his front. “This needs a rather strong Cleaning charm.” One he doesn’t want applied on his skin. As he pulls off his shirt, Harry’s eyes widen.
Draco smiled and allowed her to steer the conversation away from their fate. "How did you manage mine?" Draco had always loved being a dragon, being set among the stars, but he knew it was a Black legacy.
know! Maybe — maybe people will come here and taunt me. Merlin, I’m going to be a dare for generations of Hogwarts students. Sneak into the Forest and take the piss out the ghost of Draco Malfoy.”
he thought, although there were no other options. A low creak echoed around them as the doors seemed to strain at the hinges, and Parvati began chanting furiously, while Professor McGonagall’s stern face told Harry her
He considered trying to levitate the vase wandlessly once more, but he'd never been adept at that kind of magic. It was why his mother had to give him her own wand and go defenceless after the incident with the Snatchers. Instead he curled up in an exhausted ball without bothering to change into his nightclothes.
Ron leans forward over his desk, and Harry can see him switch gears out of Head Auror mode. “It kills me to see you hurting like this. I should tell that prick —”
Cam interrupted them, setting the latte and pasties down with a clank. “Start you a tab, Harry?” The smirk on his face said
Whoever said confession was good for the soul? Was this what therapy was like? How did Pansy stand it? And why wasn’t
"I can't bear the looks I get, when people think I can't use magic because I'm evil in my bones." Draco began to cry. "I thought I'd gotten used to it. But the emptiness and shame, it never goes away."
"Do you know-" Potter broke off. Draco couldn't believe it, but the end of that sentence had to be "
“Po— Potter? What’s happening?” Malfoy looked around frantically, both at the setting as well as Professor McGonagall and Parvati, who were both seemingly pointing their wands straight at him. It had to be unsettling, to be in the Room one moment, then the Forest the next, then back in Hogwarts.
“... Mr. and Mr. Thomas-Finnigan. Why am I not surprised. Ten points from Gryffindor, and clean that up.”
"Hmm." Draco reached down for the Firebolt he'd dropped. "Here. I think Seeker's games are out for the evening."
Draco huffed and slouched down on the bed. "I was trying to be romantic. You're ruining it." Harry laughed and sat up, throwing one leg over Draco's waist to straddle him.
Outside the door it was indeed true. Slytherin was in first place, followed by Gryffindor, then Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Minerva stared at the hourglasses in confusion. All of the professors had been at dinner, who could have been assigning points?
"Also..." Draco hadn't been totally comfortable talking about this in front of the others, friends or not. "As I told you , wWhen I was working in public, anytime someone found out I couldn't use a wand at all they became so much colder to me. I want those people to know I'm not rotten after all." He couldn't keep the bitterness out of his voice.
"More bother trying to find one. I want to make things simpler, not more complicated." Harry leaned back; they'd been standing stock still directly opposite one another for the entire conversation, and Draco found that he suddenly wanted space. He spun on his heel and flopped down on the bed as Harry continued.
He still tended to rise before Harry, taking a few minutes to watch his - Partner? Lover? - ensconced in their shared bed. He wondered what word Harry used for their relationship, wondered if he should ask.
"I'd forgotten." He sounds more sad than angry, even though he's obviously put off by the sight of Voldemort’s brand.
The rest of the Defense Against the Dark Arts students made their way out of the classroom, leaving behind one stubborn-faced girl with red hair, an upturned nose,and a tiny smattering of freckles.
"No. Well, yes, but - blood, magic and soul." He couldn't believe it, but somehow knew it to be true. "When I passed out, I heard the Manor. It spoke to me."
“It’s not bad. I’m obligated to help with brewing most of the day, but I'm beginning independent research as well. It’s certainly a lot more work than I expected, but you won’t find me complaining.”
“Mate, you have to take your mind off this.” Harry wilts under Ron’s disapproving stare. He’s sure the other Aurors think Harry is receiving a dressing down for being a general pain in the arse, not for taking his relationship woes out on everyone around him.
“I’ll figure it out eventually,” Granger insisted. “Still, Harry cooks well enough for all of us. I’m so pleased you took our advice about trying new things.”
"Harry, this is bigger than me. Do you really want to raise Julian in a world where shadow judges can arbitrarily punish people with no accountability? Where the Ministry has squads to investigate Dark magic with no warrant? Where the ends justify the means?" Returning to the chamber where his magic had been so brutally forced from him had brought it all crashing back. "I'm not claiming to be innocent. But I had no appeal. And I had no recourse when they
didn’t think about us together because it was too weird to consider. And you’re not wrong about that, it is weird, even while it’s happening. But that’s not why
“Yes, she was allowed off house arrest,” McGonagall chimed in from Harry’s left. “The Ministry considered it a family emergency.”
The judge was turning red. "And is it the child of Lucius Malfoy, and therefore eligible to inherit?"
the note had simply declared; there was no exact time given, but Draco wasn't going to wait around. "He always managed to find me in school," he said to himself with a snort. It had driven Draco mental - how had Potter always known when to pop up during that fateful year, their last together at Hogwarts?
Jack and Lacey's apples and other items from the orchard weren't unique in needing non-magical handling, but the few Squibs and elves who worked for other merchants avoided Draco at the freight Floo. Mostly he sat alone behind a curtain in back of the stall, just in case any customers literally upset the apple cart. Months passed with no appreciable change, except the inclusion of pre-shrunken pine trees at the holidays.
“No, we haven’t. Not really. We didn’t talk properly, and then we fought. None of that was a real discussion.” Draco looks sceptical, but Harry presses on. “You said you hoped to continue our friendship. Did you mean that?” It’s not all Harry wants, but he has to start somewhere.
“I'm sorry, I shouldn't have yelled. Oh! You’re — oh, right. That’s the tart. Er, sorry about that.”
Draco cocked his head. "They aren't here yet?" Tears rose in Holkey's eyes as she shook her head 'no.' "Leave it to Harry to be late even after hounding me into coming. Wait, how do you know about Julian, then? Did someone come and tell you?"
"Dunno. I just remembered it was. Here you go," Harry said, withdrawing a small object from his pocket and tossing it at Draco. He caught it unthinkingly, and Harry grinned. In his palm, Draco held a Snitch.
as soon as he opens the door. Potter is visible on the floor of the basement tunnel, the invisibility cloak nowhere to be seen. He’s crawled toward the door but collapsed halfway. Draco approaches carefully, one fist balled up but no weapon drawn.
"Sex and childish shenanigans? Why not," Draco shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant. "It's better than fighting."
"You're ruthless," Weasley said with admiration in his voice. "You're going to be the Minister someday."
"Been bringing your mum things, too, haven't you?" She shook her head. "Look, I see why they took your magic away. The world's just been through a bad time. No reason to starve you, though. Come see me next week when you visit your mum." She put her wand away and turned her back on Draco pushing the cart down the hall.
“Harry. And no, you're not. You are cute, though. Look at these.” He pinched the tip of one of Malfoy's little white ears. “So adorable, Draco. Can I call you Draco?”
Finally, it was time to move back upstairs. Four bedrooms remained on the first floor; Draco made the decision to proceed straight down the hallway. Some of the rooms were sealed, but not all the wards had held fast over the years, especially those at the windows. There was a lot of dust, a lot of sneezing, and one horrifying afternoon involving a hexed mirror and a vast number of seagulls. Draco shuddered and put it out of his mind.
Draco deflated, searching for something - anything - to stop that conversation in its path. "If you'd like a guided tour, that will be twelve Sickles." The weak attempt at humour worked, and Harry smiled.
Teaching his friends how to cast a Patronus had been a bright spot in Harry’s otherwise dismal fifth year, and he remembered it fondly. Maybe there was something to McGonagall’s offer after all.
sorry for the bathroom, you know. We've put a lot of things behind us, but I never said it, so... sorry." Even closer. "It didn't scar, did it?"
Potter waved him off, and Draco made his way home, trying to ignore the strange little spark of anticipation in his heart.
Then there was the matter of the unmentioned kiss. Did Draco really want to put himself into close proximity with Potter, hovering over a stove together? Did he expect to be able to resist that temptation?
“I…” Malfoy baulked, but Harry could tell he was tempted. “I suppose I could. I’m not prohibited from travelling within the bounds of the country. Is there much to see?”
could make this incredibly difficult, right?" Draco cautioned. He might have been hopeful, but he wasn't foolish. "The Golden Boy and a Death Eater will be hard for many people to deal with."
"You arsehole!" Draco tried to yell, but it came out as "u rshl" through the lace. Harry simply laughed as he continued his leisurely thrusting. Draco struggled against his magical bonds, feeling entirely helpless, and unbearably turned on by that very fact. He pushed back against Harry as best he could, and his lover sighed and finally sped up.
“No,” Harry answered honestly. “I didn’t know. I really thought he was dead. As far as I knew, I was lying to you.”
"Oh did you?" Draco nudged Harry's already half-hard prick with his foot. Harry blushed and rose to his knees, crawling in the massive tub until he was perched directly over Draco.
Harry sat a broom as if he were born to it, and even in the moonlight Draco could see his muscles tense under his thin shirt, green eyes darting all around in search of a glint of gold. Draco had never been able to take his own eyes off of Harry during Quidditch matches, certainly not when Gryffindor played Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, and sometimes even during a Slytherin game. Flint had boxed him on the ear once. "That's for watching Potter's arse instead of the Snitch," he'd yelled at Draco. At the time it felt like a standard locker room insult. Now it made Draco blush to remember it. Involuntarily, his gaze wandered over to said arse.
“They are rather absurd, for the most part. Binns doesn’t even know he’s dead.” He tried to swat at a leaf, but his hand passed through ineffectually. “Do you think I’m stuck here?”
"You agreed we wouldn't raise Julian to think all the terrible things you were taught," Harry said slowly. "You said you regret your past."
did for this story way back in the first chapter! It's on Tumblr but of course I want it included here. I tend to put art at the end of fics. Thank you again for reading!
A couple of weeks ago, Draco wouldn’t have minded answering it—now talking about his mother’s desire to arrange an advantageous match for him was a very thorny topic, considering how pure-blood arranged marriage customs had affected he and Potter. “She wants me to settle down,” Draco said vaguely.
“Well, that’s how I felt, regardless of logic. And when I pulled back, you blithely continued on, which just proved my point to myself that I didn’t really matter. I know, I know,” Draco cuts off the protest on the tip of Harry’s tongue. “You love me, and I matter to you. You’re just not particularly perceptive. We’ve covered this. And I’m ready to admit I was hasty when I left without communicating.”
he heard something in the dimly lit end of the tunnel. But now illuminated, it’s deserted — no, wait. There, on the ground. It’s —
Draco also felt guilty for not considering his mother more when it came to Julian. He still hadn't taken him to see her portrait. Sulking like only a Malfoy could, Draco called Holkey for tea, then dozed off.
He emerged back onto the street a few moments later, blinking in the sunlight. Draco stood a few paces away, nervously glancing up and down the street. No one seemed to give him any notice, however. Harry set off toward the Leaky and Draco fell in step beside him.
Draco froze, then adjusted his tie and shrugged. “Eventually. It was good to see you, Parvati.” He turned to Harry, paused, then then started for the door, forcing Harry to wave at Parvati over his shoulder as he followed.
“Yes, you’re all interested in reconciliation, I know.” There was no bite to Draco’s voice. “I also... I apologised to her. It wasn’t much, she was quite busy and there were memos diving at her head, but... well. I did my best. At least, I hope it was a start.”
speculates on exactly who the lucky lady will be, and Ginny cackles at each ludicrous suggestion, knowing how far off base they are. Harry shrugs and resigns himself to hanging out in Muggle bars with Dean and Seamus, feeling like a third wheel all the while. So tonight he’s striking out on his own.
They’re pressed completely against one another now, and Harry knows Draco can feel his burgeoning erection. Slyly, Draco leans up and whispers in his ear. “Truth in advertising.”
him?" Narcissa cried out, rising halfway to her feet, then sinking back down as she realised there was nowhere to go, nothing to be done. It pained Draco to see his mother in such agony.
“There’s lemon drizzle and mini treacle tarts,” Harry said, pointing out the desserts. The mound of tarts dwarfed the cake, and Draco couldn’t help but smile.
Rippling pools of light moved over the patio as the sunset glanced across the chapel wall. Draco knelt before Harry as a supplicant would, running his hands over strong thighs, spreading them apart. Harry's breath caught. "What are you doing?"
The walk down the grand staircase into the Great Hall was like coming home. It had been too long since Harry had come to Hogwarts. Immediately after the war the memories had been too painful, but now Harry was able to look around and remember the good times. It didn’t hurt that everything had been completely repaired.
Draco wasn't familiar with the song; it had to be Muggle. Or did she make it up herself? His brother's name seemed to fit perfectly in the rhythm.
“I won’t let them,” Harry declared, shocking both himself and Draco. “You didn’t really want to be there, and you were so young, so —” He stopped short, and laughed. “You
"Then we go forward as we have been. But you have to have hope, Draco. We're going to try. I'm going to make them listen to me." Harry had never seemed so fierce as he did in that moment. "The Ministry always wants me around because people believe in me, after all."
They continued along the path, and Harry spied a faint glow in the distance, likely from a fire. That had to be where Voldemort was waiting. Malfoy obviously spotted it as well, because he baulked along the path.
"Aw, you remember what I bought?" Draco blushed furiously. "Seriously, Malfoy, what are you doing here?" Potter was still inspecting his surroundings. Leave it him to come all the way out to Craik just to judge Draco.
"Helping him?" As soon as the words were spoken, Draco realised he could feel Harry's magic as well, an undercurrent beneath the rest.
am I doing?” Draco moans. Harry takes it as a rhetorical question and doesn’t answer, desperately pressing his mouth to Draco’s once more. He quickly returns both hands to kneading Draco’s arse and hopes he leaves finger-sized bruises.
because he saw that string in the Forest?” Harry shivered, recalling the feel of Draco’s cold, ghostly hand. “Sometimes I wonder if I just imagined that. It was so many years ago. Although not as long for him, I guess.”
Now Harry was even more interested. “Make sure you stay until the end tonight, then,” he said with a wink.
It was impossible to tell how long the hallway was; all sound from their footsteps was swallowed up, as was the dim light of the lead not-Auror's wand. A door suddenly opened to the left and a dour Unspeakable emerged, carrying a dusty hourglass. The door slammed shut before Draco could see what was in the room behind it.
The kiss was less violent than their first, but no less passionate. There was no hesitation, no gentle easing in; their tongues met immediately and Harry's hand came up to tangle in Draco's hair. The wet sound of their mouths seemed unbearably loud in the silent garden, soon joined by soft moans and harsh pants. The telltale noise of Draco's zipper echoed as Harry, eager as the last time, slipped a hand between them.
"No, Day! Nnnnoo!" Julian protested as Draco pushed him gently back inside, a lamb struggling under his other arm. "Nnnnn!" His brother reached for the soft lamb.
The view from this side of the house looked over the rose bushes, out to the distant sea. “I think these bedrooms saw a good amount of joy,” he mused. “A holiday, a happy occasion. There’s good energy here.” He turned to see Potter regarding him strangely, and flushed. “Let’s get to work.”
“But… breakfast,” Harry said lamely. Draco paused, his hand on the doorknob, then squared his shoulders.
“So this is what, charity? You’re one to talk about never getting out.” She pulled a face. “Oh no, you’re
“I got very, very clean in the shower,” Draco whispered suggestively in his ear, before nibbling on it. Harry shuddered, his hips twitching in anticipation.
Harry hiked his satchel up on his shoulder again as it started to slip. “Should be easy to find something you like, then.” It was difficult to picture Draco in a bedsit after seeing the sprawling manor he’d grown up in. Perhaps this was all part of the changes he was trying to make.
Draco, unable to come up with a more eloquent answer than, “Huh?” took the proffered hand, and felt the twisting pull of Apparition.
"Have to get a local for the stall, then. Still, we've had trouble keeping people year-round up in Craik, so we might as well take you. I'll have a Portkey here for you Monday. You won't be getting paid for yesterday, by the way, what with the way you took off like that."
“I don’t- there isn’t much to tell. We were investigating a smuggling ring and were attacked in a warehouse. I don’t remember much after that.” He won’t meet Draco’s eyes.
“I always thought your mum and you were close,” Potter ventured. “You seem to want to avoid her now.” He didn’t ask why, but the question was implied.
"No, I don't," Harry said carefully, taking his wand back and holding out Draco's. "But it's the easiest solution."
It was probably a bad idea. Harry never slept over, not even with his repeat hookups. Yet something in Draco’s eyes compelled him to lie back down.
Draco gulped. "Why? Why is it so important to you? Only because of Julian? Or..." It was becoming impossible to ignore the signs. Harry's hungry looks, his insistence they all move to the Manor, his investment in Draco's redemption. But a direct accusation was too risky.
With a sinking feeling, Draco saw where this was going. “And you don't think I’ve tried, is that it?”
The gaslights ignited of their own accord, helpfully illuminating his trek through the old passageways. At least the house had finally taken a liking to him.
In the gardens hedgehogs could be found, and if Draco occasionally fed them that was his business. Foxes and martens wandered the forest, and he considered himself lucky when he spied one. Overall it was vastly superior to hiding in the back of a stall in Diagon Alley, and he couldn't imagine returning there. But the Manor...
“I hope I see him.” An owl hooted in the distance, and a thought struck Harry. “If you go anywhere, and see him first, if you see my parents, don’t tell them I’m coming. They'll be so sad.” It would have been different if they’d been able to hear it from Harry himself.
Harry's face grew soft, and he silently reached out and cupped Draco's cheek, then turned and pressed his thumb into the wet spot on the fresco. Out of nothing, a new badge appeared, and a name formed in the same sharp calligraphy as the rest:
“I already told you no.” Potter kicked his feet stubbornly against the leg of the chaise. “I like you being here.”
“Are you sensing magic?” Even through his fear, Draco was curious. “Like when you said you could sense the Anti-Apparition field?”
sat on the end table; it was meant for a child of two or three, but reading it aloud gave Draco just as much comfort as Julian - recalling one of his only kind memories of their father. Rather than set Julian down in his cot or playpen, he sat on the settee and tucked Julian into the crook of his arm beside him.
“Can’t say I’ve suffered that in particular, no. But everyone else is suffering your temper for it. Take a break if you need to, Harry, but stop tormenting everyone else just to give yourself something to do.”
Jack paused on his way up the walk, returning from the wand orchard. "Something you need? I never see you up here on Sunday." It was true; Draco tended to keep to himself on most days, and especially during his time off.
"I'm glad you stayed," Harry whispered in his ear as he awoke. "Why didn't you ever sleep in here before?"
“She loves me, but doesn’t understand my need to distance myself from… all that. We still speak, but….” He leaned a little closer to Harry, perhaps unconsciously. “Our relationship is damaged, and I’m not sure how to fix it.”
mine. Like our magic is holding hands as well." Draco nodded, his eyes closed and a blush spreading over his cheeks.
The line at the counter is short but it feels eternal. Drink in hand, Harry sits back at the table. “So,” he begins tentatively, “how've you been?”
“It wasn’t something fun when I was young. It was… well. A chore.” Potter settled back on the blanket, gazing over the coastline. “So when I first lived on my own, after Hogwarts, I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I was living on takeaway. Eventually, Mrs Weasley took pity on me and gave me a few lessons, and some cookbooks for my birthday.”
you. I think maybe I wanted to kiss you, but you were such a git it just turned violent in my mind."
“I was upset. And it’s true, I was attracted to you from the beginning. But if you hadn’t returned that interest, we could have been just friends. I think with enough time now, we still could.”
"And then my magic was vulnerable enough they could steal it," he finished for her. "Merlin, that's so clever I'm almost impressed."
“Oh, nothing, just something Malfoy said.” Harry didn’t think he would ever forget a word of their conversation, the last before his apparently temporary death.
"My Nimbus 2001 didn't either. I tried to put Pansy alongside, once, and it tipped this way and that before she slipped off. Wasn't hurt of course, just her pride." It had been in Fifth year, and she'd only fallen a foot to the ground, but her skirt had flipped up and Greg had laughed until she stormed back to the dungeons. Draco felt a bit of painful nostalgia for those days, when his only concern had been soothing Pansy's feelings so as not to lose his snogging privileges.
care. In any case, it's been a long time since I took an actual bath and not a shower in sun-warmed water, so I'll be upstairs." Almost unconsciously, Draco touched his hair, which was much less silky than it had been when he had access to conditioners and creams. He also had been forced to trim it on his own repeatedly and couldn't bring himself to pull the mirror back out from under the bed.
Harry stood firm, framed by the doorway, not yet venturing further into the Manor. "I'm part of your life now too, whether you like it or not."
Numbly, Draco nodded and sat back in his chair. Under the table, Pansy patted his thigh gently. “I’m proud of you,” she whispered.
Knocking on Malfoy’s door shouldn’t be so hard. He wasn't intimidating, or threatening; he was only Draco Malfoy, coward and first-class snob, right?
It didn’t take long for Harry to reach his own climax; he rolled off Draco and snuggled up beside him, loosening the ties.
Harry stared at the sword with a newfound appreciation. “Can you feel it, then? That sort of… pulse? I’m not quite sure how to explain it.” Malfoy stared at him strangely. “Right, guess it’s only me, then.”
“Right now, no. I’m starting to recall… just a moment of total, searing pain. I think that must have been the Fiendfyre.” Harry cringed. The screams had been terrible, not to mention the smell of a thousand books and brooms and forgotten objects crumbling to ash.
Draco highly doubted Harry would ever want to live in Lucius and Narcissa's rooms. But perhaps, if Harry really wasn't going to leave him, they could still combine living quarters.
"Nothing. Nothing's wrong. I just need to get cleaned up." He pushed Harry off and tried to zip his trousers, cringing when it stuck on the stained fabric. He held them up awkwardly as he backed away towards his room. "I'm getting in the shower. You should go do the same."
The moment he caught his breath, Harry backed away, leaving Draco to simply lie there, stunned. “Clean yourself up.” As Harry fumbled his way out of the room, he saw a set of pyjamas appear on the end of the bed.
Before Draco could protest - though he wasn't going to protest, who was he kidding - Harry had swallowed halfway down his prick. Draco yelped, and Harry pulled away with a
Draco was still unable to unravel the mystery of Potter’s departure from the Aurors, or decipher the wistful look that sometimes passed over his face. Rather than push him, Draco decided to be respectful, their nascent friendship suddenly more important than his curiosity. (
serious.” For the first time that morning, he began to look truly doubtful. “I thought…” He shook his head. “No. We couldn’t.”
breathlessly detailing his rescue and return to the living. “He wasn’t really dead,” Harry had muttered, suspecting that Narcissa was the unnamed source in an attempt to drum up sympathy for her son. It had worked: Rita Skeeter thought he was a poor, tragic figure who would forever be displaced in time.
Draco gets a sudden image in his mind of Potter sucking something else, and dismisses it. It’s been too long since he took a lover, that’s all. “I’m still good enough with potions. I could brew you Blood Substitute.”
With a gasp, Harry spun around, but there was no one there. “Harry!” the voice called again, this time closer. A butterfly, its wings beating madly, suddenly appeared in front of his face; Harry tamped down the instinct to swat at it.
Harry smiled lazily, and it was rather attractive, which did nothing for Draco's anxiety. He seemed so pleased to be walking the grounds together, to simply be in Draco's company. "
"You are evidently ignorant of basic magical theory. No matter." She fixed her gaze on Draco. "You've violated the agreement we drew up. I'm afraid you'll have to be taken into custody." Harry moved to stand protectively in front of Draco.
The problem with eavesdropping was the lack of visual cues. Harry sounded like he was anything but sure about Weasley's eventual visit, but did his face give that away, or only his tone? Draco had to settle for hearing the conversation on its own, as Granger continued.
” Draco let the word fall from his mouth as if he'd eaten a bad strawberry. “I'm simply not letting an opportunity pass me by. I'll do my due diligence once I arrive.”
He couldn't stop touching Julian: holding him close, stroking his wispy blond hair, giving him a soft tap on the nose just to provoke a toothless grin.
"You're telling me." The lack of feeling in his limbs - the lack of limbs at all - was starting to unnerve Draco. "How is this happening?"
Potter opened his mouth to speak. Irrationally worried that Potter could tell what he was thinking, Draco cut him off.
"It won't," Ms. Janney assured them. "It simply removes the ability to create magic, to cast spells. You're still a magical being, you'll be able to see through Muggle-repelling wards and use objects like a Portkey. You won't be able to use a wand again, of course."
Malfoy sniffed. “I’m not an Animagus yet, so that last charge wouldn’t stick.” Although his words were argumentative, there was less of an edge in his voice, and he watched very carefully as Harry sat down on the bed beside him.
“I suppose I don’t,” Draco conceded. “Only, I like the idea of the privacy of having a bedroom door, even if I’m here alone. I know that might sound strange to you.”
Jones scratched at his neck. “Huh, didn’t realise there was a difference. Guess that’s why I’m hiring someone.”
"No, I mean I'm unable to open it. There's a new bylaw in the Statute of Secrecy that requires all magical publications be charmed to appear blank unless unlocked with a spell." The Squibs who worked at the market had complained loudly about the injustice of it all.
Draco hadn't been sure they would allow him to speak, but he had thought about what he would say if they did.
“Bye, then,” Harry waved, and watched as the lift door closed. Somehow, he felt like he’d missed something.
Harry snorted, but didn’t refute that. He was too charmed by the way the cat had transformed under Draco’s touch.
The moment was broken. Harry put the kettle on while Draco stood aside and waited, fretting all the while. What was he thinking, trying to start something in the kitchen while everyone waited for dessert? And was he certain Harry wanted to move forward now, so soon after they cleared the air? Perhaps it was better if he waited for Harry to make the first move. But it seemed as if he’d welcomed the incipient kiss…
“Right. Helping little old pure-blood ladies restore their chateaus.” The remark was dismissive, but Potter sounded almost amused. “Come on then, take a look at the house.”
With great hesitation, Draco approached the door with the flowers carved on it. This was the first hurdle: it hadn’t opened until he and Potter had both touched it. This time it was more forgiving, and creaked open under Draco’s touch. He began his diagnostic spells on the entrance.
"No. I don't think she would have." Draco looked back down at the letter. "Because she also told me to choose happiness."
“Why’s that? I thought you could tell he was interested.” Harry slowly inched his hand toward Parvati’s tray — he wanted to hear her theories about Draco and his possible attraction to Harry, of course, but he also wanted the third pudding she was hoarding. He’d arrived to lunch late, not being bound to a Ministry schedule, and all the dessert had been taken — which was especially tragic, since they were serving sticky toffee that week.
“Look,” Ron offers. “If you don’t want to take time off work, at least do something fun. Hermione has tickets to some art opening in Diagon this weekend. She bought them because it’s for charity, but it’s not my scene. You’d be saving my hide if you went with her instead.”
“Come over here and I’ll show you touching!” Contrary to his threats of violence, Draco slumped against the wall. “I’ll die here and no one will know. My mother will be beside herself. Who’s going to feed the cats?!” he wailed.
Harry shrugged. "Hermione didn't seem surprised. Ron and I actually had a terrible row when he confronted me, but I think he was just worried. I'm not where he expected I'd be after the war. But he's come around. We've learned to trust each other after everything we've been through. All three of us have." Harry looked away, up through the leaves above them. "I don't know where I'd be without them."
"This is a war crimes tribunal, not a standard trial. Mr. Malfoy is here before us as a member of a terrorist group. We will not be hearing appeals."
"I'm... Well, it doesn't get any easier. But I've got other things to focus on right now, so that helps."
The barrister demanded an appeal, an extension. He was being compensated handsomely, after all, so he had to at least appear to put up a fight. But the gavel had fallen again.
“I have several. I was sixteen in the last. I suspect my mother will burn it,” he added matter-of-factly.
“I’m sorry, what kind of thread?” Harry asked, suddenly picturing the devastated face of Draco Malfoy, five years ago in the Forbidden Forest, staring at his right wrist.
he decided, throwing caution to the wind. The press of their hips together, and the friction between them as Draco realised Potter was just as hard as him, seemed to override any lingering objections that Potter still had, and they began kissing frantically.
“So why did you??” Malfoy asked, confusion evident in his slightly shaking voice. “We weren't exactly friends. Far from it. Why act like we are now?”
Unable to hold himself up on his trembling knees, Harry slipped out of Draco’s wet heat and fell beside him, trying to catch his breath. Draco went limp, legs akimbo, not bothering to care about the sticky mess he was covered in. He managed to turn his head towards Harry, his stunned grey eyes tender yet wary. Harry wanted to reassure him, but found himself at a loss for words. Exhaustion was quickly taking hold; he managed to link their fingers before sleep claimed him once more.
“I’ll Floo the shop to let you know how it’s going,” he said politely, pulling the silver-trimmed hood up and hiding his distinctive hair.
As he gets closer, he can see that Potter is shivering, curled in on himself and breathing shallowly. Suddenly, Draco isn’t even sure this will work. How starved is too far gone for a vampire? But he’s made up his mind — he’ll offer what little help he can. And maybe one tiny act of kindness in the maelstrom of violence and death his life has become will go a ways toward redeeming himself, the way he knows Potter had hoped he would all those years ago when he testified at Draco’s trial.
"Merlin yes, do it." Harry didn't actually pull Draco's trousers all the way down, just unzipped them and shoved a hand inside. He stroked the shaft of Draco's cock, then returned to his balls, tugging on them just this side of painful as he licked into Draco's mouth, swallowing his sobs of pleasure.
“Right. I don't think McGonagall would have agreed if she was truly worried the fire would rage out of control, but then again, she did ask us to come between terms, so…”
“Do you?” Harry stood, and Malfoy cowered. “Oh, don’t be like that, I’m not going to hurt you. There’s a spare bedroom down the hall. Let me check out your story. Then
“I heard him screaming for help,” Harry whispered. “And he told me he felt a searing pain before appearing in the Forest… but he wasn't burned. But why didn’t the Room eject
Draco himself was frozen with indecision. Should he deny? Laugh it off? Confess his feelings? Let Harry answer for him?
Harry shook his head. "She didn't used to be like this, but after everything, and losing Fred, she's just so
"And what did you get up to over there?" Harry frowned. "Never mind. I don't want to talk politics in the bath."
Harry never felt so guilty as when he awoke on the cold ground of the Forbidden Forest and lied to Narcissa Malfoy.
Harry shrugged. "I was at the Ministry and I didn't want to bother with all the fuss on my way in and out. It's easier this way."
Draco sniffed, offended. "Of course I love him, you dim-witted sod. You may think me incapable of the emotion-"
‘I know exactly what you mean.” The long days spent camping, the rows, hunger, the strain on his psyche. It had been one foot in front of the other. He hadn’t even given much consideration to Ginny, to a career, to a life
“It’s true,” he admitted. “I’ve been able to see parts of him I never knew existed. I mean, he’s not
"I'm sure Holkey will enjoy having another child to look after," Narcissa said. Her eyes were shadowed, and Draco found he could not parse her thoughts. In lieu of anything else to say, he reached over for her hand.
Parvati led Harry to the centre of the room and allowed the mist to settle on their skin. “So, you had questions about the String of Fate?”
She bent forward on her knees, chin in hand, simply watching Draco. Even seated, looking up, he felt as if her presence towered over him. Fortunately he didn't have to think of anything to say, as Delby popped back into the room.
“Occasionally, magic isn’t the best solution.” Draco summoned the small bag he brought with him everyday, and pulled out a bottle of grease, which he applied to the hinges. “Try it now.”
"It has been the pressing question in my mind, yes, how a teenager gained custody of an unrelated child."
"You're so beautiful." Harry gazed down at Draco with such a depth of emotion in his eyes that it was frightening.
"I'm afraid it's irreversible." Draco felt his own hands begin to shake. Beside him his mother was audibly trying not to sob.
“Skeletons?” Malfoy forgot the game. “Real ones? People call you for that sort of thing? Were they cursed?”
"You'll have a perfect little family, make me a perfect little wife." He gestured to Julian's bedroom and batted his eyes for effect. "See? Ready made."
"Er, it doesn't really matter. But that lawyer kept after me, wouldn't let up about how Julian would end up in an orphanage if I didn't take him, and... I've seen an orphanage. They aren't nice places. Then I told her to find some loophole or legal way you could have him but she said that wasn't possible, and that if I cared that much, I could sign the papers and take Julian and share him with you. But honestly Malfoy, I couldn't imagine sharing a cup of tea with you, much less a baby. "
The encouragement works; a bit of hope appears in Harry’s eyes. “Maybe. I mean, my family will still be there. I don’t want to cause any problems for them…”
“Here.” He tosses a spare shirt and pair of trousers over to the bed and waits for Potter to put them on. The shirt hangs on him a bit.
Draco continued to be stunned that an 18 year old boy had been allowed to walk out of a hospital with a baby to which he had no family connection. It was a testament to Potter's influence, as well as to how far the Malfoys had fallen.
