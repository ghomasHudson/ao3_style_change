When he started paying attention to the conversation, he discovered that Malfoy and the portrait were already discussing a different topic, namely how this portrait could speak Modern English if he’d been stuck in the Chamber for so long. Then Harry saw the nameplate and sighed. Salazar Slytherin. Of course, who else could it be?
“So, the Saviour can’t even seal a cut properly.”
Draco included older memories provided by McGonagall, who knew Euphemia Potter quite well. James’ birth, his shenanigans, his parents meeting Lily’s mother and father.
The sleeve of Malfoy’s jacket is too tight to roll it far, but Malfoy still makes the attempt, before realising Harry didn’t ask to see it. Not that Harry doesn’t want to. He’s intrigued.
When he put Scorpius to bed for a nap, he wondered what to cook for supper. He wanted to make something for Potter. He’d fixed himself and Scorpius sandwiches for lunch and had noticed that the fridge was full, to his delight. Some roast with butternut squash? He knew many recipes but had never been able to truly enjoy cooking for someone else at the hostel. And Scorpius was a little monster when it came to vegetables, so since Draco didn’t believe in forcing him to eat something he couldn’t swallow, he made sure to cook with ingredients his son already liked. If he was feeling adventurous, he’d give him a bite of something new and see what he thought about it.
“She’s right, but you don’t want bits of feathers on your biscuits, do you?” Harry flicked his wand and Vanished the stray feathers and the content of the bowl before mixing icing sugar and lemon. “There! Good as new.”
, which he has attempted and failed to get into so far.
It got even worse when they entered the park, and Draco heard the music, saw the Ferris wheel and the children running around. It smelled heavenly, like biscuits and churros and roasted chestnuts. “It’s beautiful,” he whispered, and Harry had to agree.
the only Slytherin who owned a computer (in a magic-suppressing room).
“Giant toy store. I thought we could buy Teddy’s presents.”
Harry smiled wryly. "Not if you're coming."
Draco almost skipped all the way to the kitchen. He filled the kettle, chose a superior brand of Earl Grey and prepared it the way Harry liked it. Then he joined him on the couch and breathed out slowly, slouching like an undignified Gryffindor. He'd bought the most comfortable sofa he could find because he couldn't stand the austere furniture he'd grown up with—even the Slytherin dungeons lacked in comfort, every seat made to improve posture instead.
“You can be pissed off later. Tell us everything!”
This was much better than a bloody Pygmy Puff.
“Is that spell a trade secret or?”
“Oh! You’re reading about space exploration!” She made her way into the compartment, and Harry stayed back, embarrassed.
Potter was clearly overwhelmed by the time they finished talking, but there was an unmistakable determination in his frown.
“Send me an invoice with the next box,” Harry decides, and Malfoy nods. “Do you take it too?” He wants to know. It’s important to him, somehow. He’s not sure why.
“I’m going mad.”
“Must you?” Draco moved his legs but rested his calves on Harry’s thighs after Harry sat. Then he tilted his head, scrutinising Harry’s face. “You ran all the way here. What was it this time?”
He threw the covers onto the floor, stumbled out of bed, his scream still on his lips. His stomach cramped. He didn’t reach the door, instead collapsing and letting out a gut-wrenching sob. He muffled the noise by biting into his fist.
Draco shuddered at the thought.
Teddy cuts Scorpius’ pancake in half, and continues, “Accidental magic stops when you get a way to channel it. So, wand.”
Perhaps Malfoy doesn’t mind crowds, or loud noises, or the green light of fireworks, but everyone has different demons, and Draco’s have breached the place he grew up in, tainting a happy childhood. It hits Harry like a brick to the face: Draco is finally trusting him to see this side of him, and it feels like a privilege. Harry is familiar with the concept of evil seeping into a place where it doesn’t belong, and the thought conjures the image of Bathilda Bagshot and Godric’s Hollow. Now is a good time to remember their deal.
Harry kissed his warm cheek and rubbed his back, then looked at the stars. “You know better now.”
“I live to serve.” He opens the trunk and starts taking clothes out.
in front of him. No point in reading it. He still bought it every single day because it was proof of Harry’s idiocy. It helped him remember that the year was not 2010, but 1989, should he ever doubt it. He hadn’t brought his phone with him—not that it would work, anyway—but he was still itching to check it.
“I don’t know if I’m angry or not,” Harry grumbled.
Malfoy was a wreck. The white light of their wands accentuated the gauntness of his features and made the scars on his left cheek and down his neck shine; whatever had made Malfoy so bloody smug before the war was gone, and Harry felt a twinge of sympathy for him. This tended to happen a bit too often since his trial.
Harry shrugged with a crooked smile and scratched Noodle’s head. “I didn’t think he’d be so happy to see me. He turned the Chamber of Secrets into a shrine for Regulus and lives there pretty much all the time.” He looked at her, still surprised by her short hair. She’d donated it while Harry was abroad and he didn’t recognise her when she stepped through his door earlier. It suited her. He smirked and leaned closer. “How’s Matteo?”
Unlike years ago, Harry found he liked being on a mission with someone. There was no trap waiting for a group of kids with only a school year’s worth of spells in their pocket; he trusted Draco to handle himself. He should have been scared, perhaps, but Draco’s calm demeanour acted like a balm for his often-jittery soul.
“Hello Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said, cheeks burning in embarrassment, praying that she wouldn’t find out what they’d been up to. He cleared his throat. “The door was locked, and we didn’t have our wands.”
Cho laughs. “He’s a snarky little shit, reminds me of you, actually.”
“Legos!”
“Ah, not really?” Harry was pretty sure she’d guessed, though. “She said she couldn’t reach you and wanted to know why. Told her you were at my place.”
After some thinking, Draco found the perfect way to annoy Kreacher even more. “I propose a flamboyantly gay Christmas tree this year.”
“Master Draco has caught a
“I’m sorry,” he says, and Myrtle sniffs with typical Malfoy-ish disdain. Draco is almost proud. “I’ll do better.”
So, it was a bleary-eyed Draco who discovered their next destination in the morning, when he happened to glance at the map stored in his half-full suitcase and noticed the brand new contours of another country.
Draco attempted to hit him with a pillow, and Harry didn’t have the strength to hit back. He was lulled into a dazed sleep before he could blink.
“What are friends for?”
Unfortunately, neither of them falls in love with any of the places they see. Many of the smaller agencies are eager to take them to the properties for an impromptu visit, and there’s no spark. This means they repeat their insane Apparition pattern for the entire week, as soon as Draco has some free time, and Harry is ready to call it quits by Thursday.
The page Draco was looking at showed an image of hedgehog-shaped gloves with a long list of instructions and a knitting pattern. Harry smiled and bit into his newly prepared meal. Once he was done chewing his first bite, he explained he’d bought a copy to check if a subscription would be a good gift for Molly. And at the expression on Draco’s face, he realised that yes, Draco planned on meeting the Weasleys and yes, the existence of more gingers beyond Ginny and Ron was sending his brain into overdrive.
Slytherin ended his tale with a fierce glare directed at the box, head high and proud. All Harry could think of was that as he learned about some of the deeds of past Dark Lords, Voldemort was only getting started. A sobering thought. Given Malfoy’s ashen pallor, he, too, had been shaken by the story. Who wouldn’t?
“The portrait you know of is a much older me. It was painted when I reached my eightieth year on this Earth, unfortunately imbuing itself with madness and paranoia. I have last seen this version of myself as he sealed this very Chamber, ready to leave Hogwarts behind.”
Draco was tired of worrying. Now, perhaps he could have some peace.
“Very well, little man. A sea urchin can dig holes in rocks to hide from their predators—”
“You’re both ridiculous and sickeningly adorable.” With a jaunty wave, Ginny stepped away. “I’m off. See you Monday, Malfoy!”
“We need a place to live, and I’m getting rather tired of whatever this dump is,” he added, glaring around the small studio they were renting, the only one they’d been able to get without Muggle papers or bank accounts (magic helped). He took Harry’s hand and smiled, aware of why the man would be reluctant. “We’ll refurbish it completely. It won’t look the same, I promise. I would never make you live there otherwise.”
“Teddy says they live in the sea.”
“MOTHER!”
, Draco was sitting at the kitchen table of a small apartment in London, the
Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom had survived the war unscathed, but the same couldn’t be said for the boy leaning against the sink.
Draco’s left eye twitched, and he could’ve sworn Harry had chuckled. But then, there it was, in plain sight. The quiche had dripped and coated the bottom of the oven in a layer of crusty batter. Most of it was gone because the pastry had bubbled up so much that the clumpy liquid had oozed over the edges of the tray. Kreacher grumbled about the disgraceful use of kitchen appliances, and Harry cast a few scouring charms, to Draco’s indignation.
They entered the first tunnel on the right. More torches, that Harry didn’t remember seeing four years ago, lit up when they got closer, revealing the length of the passageway until it curved at the end. They didn’t speak, which was for the best.
“You invaded my space, so it’s my turn.” Ginny marched towards his desk and sat on it without a care in the world. “What’s up with you?”
Walking into the living room, Harry took a seat next to the fireplace and grabbed a pillow, holding it onto his lap as Noodle slithered down his leg and found a spot to nap near the fire.
There’s a letter from his mum, who can’t use any of the Malfoy money during her house arrest, and her words warm Draco’s heart. A Christmas card from Longbottom and Lovegood, too. He sets it aside after reading it twice and grabs the second package. The card falls and reveals chicken scratch in blue ink.
“My, aren’t we snarky tonight.” Draco slid under the covers with a smirk and handed him the vial. “Drink this.”
Sticking his tongue out, Teddy drew a bow on one of the biscuits. “Cousin Draco says I need to reply to every letter very fast and that it’s unpolite to make people wait.”
With a long-suffering sigh, Ona bumped her shoulder against Warrington’s. “Being a Slytherin was hard in those days.”
Nope, the thing in the mirror wasn't a camera :D
“Only if I can have another day off instead, and if you invite me to that party.”
Kreacher had done an excellent job in the entrance hall; he’d dusted and repaired a lamp that Harry hadn’t realised was there, and the hallway was a bit more inviting now. Harry didn’t care much. Ever since he’d gotten rid of Walburga’s portrait and the revolting artefacts like the taxidermied troll leg, he’d been fine in this house. He’d filled it with the laughter of his godson and the company of friends, so he couldn’t care less about the gaudy porcelain and the colour of the walls. Besides, Teddy liked the house. He claimed it was like the ghost train at the fair. It said a lot that Harry would want to make some changes so Malfoy would be comfortable.
Speaking of Malfoy, he was already making himself useful by washing the dishes by hand, even though Harry had said he could use magic. Harry, on the other hand, was now getting ready for something he’d rather avoid for the next two hundred years: a visit to the Ministry. He put on his shoes and wrapped a scarf around his neck, then sighed.
"Of course you have a wine cabinet, you posh git."
The man's eyebrows rose. "I dare say she'd have no trouble at all, then. Opal, I should think." He gestured towards a selection of glittering stones, different from what Draco knew of opals. Some were red, bright green or blue, with many different patterns. He let out a breath as he found the perfect stone; it was a warm, golden orange, like a flame encased in a polished shell. The light reflecting on it still brought out a rainbow of other colours typical of opals, but the yellow and orange seemed to glow. It was a beauty.
“Strange, you seem to get along fine so far.”
The rest of the school is still wary or hateful, but the attacks stop. It’s a bit humiliating to rely on the Golden Trio’s help for his safety, but he didn’t ask them to do it, so it’s alright. It’s nice to be able to get out of the common room without keeping a shield up at all times.
“Will you let me find out?” he asked, and Scorpius nodded with enthusiasm. “Great! So, for tonight, do you have anything else?”
Time ticks by, and Harry comes to him in a dream. He’s whispering sweet nothings into his ear when he thinks Draco’s asleep. He calls him love; Draco always tells him not to call him that, but in reality, he enjoys it. So he pretends to be in a deep slumber, only he sneezes, and Harry starts hitting him with a pillow and calling him a giant prat, and Draco laughs and laughs and
He blinks until he gets used to seeing again and finds out he’s in the only private room of the infirmary, where Madam Pomfrey takes care of students who are either contagious or require privacy. Books and rolls of parchment are stacked on the floor next to Potter’s chair, and Scarhead’s lap is covered with a thin blanket. Draco’s mind can’t comprehend this right away, but when he does, he croaks: “Have you been sleeping here?”
An old, almost forgotten sense of excitement spread through Harry’s limbs. He looked at Draco, who winked.
She smirks as Harry looks over her shoulder, and she lets him in. Teddy is running from the living room to the kitchen pretending to be on a broom, laughing and screaming about the Snitch. On the couch by the fireplace, dressed in tight trousers and a freshly pressed button-up shirt, rolled-up sleeves revealing black tattoos that cover both arms from the wrist up, is Draco Malfoy. The first two buttons of his shirt are open and there’s more ink there. Harry suddenly needs a glass of water.
Malfoy’s cigarette butt falls on the pavement, and a quick wand movement Vanishes it. Then Malfoy puts one foot on the wall and rests his arm on his knee, looking ahead. He might be avoiding Harry’s gaze, who knows. “My friends have questionable tastes in entertainment.”
There were countless memories he wanted to forget. He told Slytherin how walking with Potter in the Chamber was the only bright spot in his life at the moment.
“Malfoy!”
“You know exactly what you’re doing, fiend.”
“No. I’m stupid, that’s what. I was trying to figure out how to open up to him, but I don’t need to, right?”
(Image: Four pairs of sock-clad feet by the fireplace)
Slytherin crossed his arms. “You wait until the wards let you go.”
Slytherin’s laughter sounded hysterical and so unlike him that Harry started feeling nervous. He could tell that Malfoy was pretending to be unaffected, but he was picking at his fingernails and didn’t fool Harry.
At the bottom of the box, he finds a book. It looks ancient. He caresses the cover and opens it.
A long sigh interrupted them. “Can you
"You can come in now, Potter."
“Draco wouldn’t hurt me. Ziggy Stardust.” Green flames come to life and lick the scorched walls around them.
Days pass and not one of them is free of Scorpius’ antics. Sugar turns into salt, carrots mysteriously vanish, and Slinky gets extra legs (McGonagall fixes that, and congratulates him on a thorough job with Albert—apparently, the bird from Hell was much harder to fix, but Draco suspects it’s because it’s Albert, infamous for being a pain in everybody’s arse). When the school year ends, Draco can spot streaks of grey in his hair.
“I’m a Death Eater, Potter.”
I'm also back in full lockdown. Not that it changes anything to my daily life because I have literally not left my house or seen anyone except the grocery delivery drivers since March.
Scorpius goes to his room so he can tell all of his soft toys about his weekend at Grandma's and Grandpa's, and Draco helps Harry set the table for dinner. There’s a pie in the oven, and it smells heavenly.
Something flickers in Malfoy’s eyes. “I wouldn’t mind,” he murmurs, and memories surge into Harry’s head.
(Image: Two mugs, one shaped like an upside down Santa, the other like an upside down snowman. )
Blearily, Draco opened his eyes. Everything was so white, so soft, the sheets smelled amazing. He wrapped his arms around his son, who let out a scream and started giggling. He buried his nose in his silky hair. “Morning. I love you, little man.”
He walks towards Gringotts and notices that every door is closed. There’s no garish orange prank store in sight, and the Nimbus 2000 graces the window of Quidditch Quality Supplies—somehow Draco knows he can’t stop there. Then one door opens, and he just goes along with it.
Still flustered, but satisfied that Malfoy’s bath had helped him feel better, Harry feigned a keen interest for a roll of parchment he couldn’t read. He listened as Slytherin spoke of the progress they’d made, how the wards had barely reacted to their occasional spats since the incident that’d gotten them both stuck to a wall. It’d been akin to bickering, without any intent to hurt each other.
Draco wakes up alone in a bright room that smells like healing potions. He raises his hand to block out the sun, and stares—that can’t be his hand. It’s too thin, like those people Draco tried to forget, the ones he and Harry couldn’t save in time. It’s the thinness of a starved man. Draco’s not hungry, though. He’s not sure he can feel anything.
“She missed you,” she explains as the baby reaches for Harry’s glasses.
Fawkes had a few feathers by the end of the week and didn’t leave Scorpius’ side unless Harry or Draco happened to be in the kitchen cutting up fruits. The bird would steal any fruit he could put his crooked beak on. The first time he’d done that, Harry hadn’t paid attention to his presence, focusing on rolling the dough for a tart. Fawkes ate every berry on the countertop in just a few seconds. Since then, fruits were watched closely.
Draco shuddered and pushed him away, tucking himself back into his pants. “You’re the worst!” Then, he remembered the first picture he saw. “I wonder if Transfiguring your—”
Potter leaned back, relaxing into his arms. “It’s the most beautiful tree I’ve ever seen, that’s all.”
“I’m delighted you find this funny.” Draco’s hold on him was strong, and the tone of his voice hid his emotions well, but not enough to fool Harry.
“A tingle on the back of my neck.”
“I still don’t get why you didn’t keep him at Grimmauld instead of living in filth, Potter.”
follow him through that door. For the nth time, he considered the value of hiding here and never getting out again. To be fair, he was tempted a few years ago. But becoming the Mysterious Hermit of Grimmauld Place appealed to him as much as attending a Defence class with Umbridge, so he suffered the hero-worship of the wizarding world—and the presence of entities he feared.
“I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction,” Harry says under his breath, as the barman pretends their side of the room doesn’t exist. “They hate me.”
“Well, no more magic for you tonight, Potter.” He tucked a strand of hair behind his ear, then Kreacher came back and announced that none of the fumes remained, taking the empty plates before being asked.
His smile widened at the sight of his disgruntled toddler who was holding his stuffed lobster and had probably been in the process of telling it all about the fun he’d had outside. Scorpius was always so grumpy when he was tired.
react that way to crushed beetle eyes, honestly, Potter!), he helps him correct it.
“Did you get the locket?” Draco asked, choosing not to move from his position on his husband’s lap.
Well. Draco stares at him and feels guilty for embarrassing him. “That’s okay. You were a tad busy. I guess you had other things on your mind.”
He left the office without answering their questions once he was done with his last customer of the day (an old man who forgot all about the concept of washing himself), and he crinkled an empty candy wrapper in his pocket. He’d be late, but Ron wouldn’t hold it against him. Hermione might rant about time management, though. They’d agreed to meet up once a month because they were all busy with their own lives—Hermione being the worst of them, obviously. They’d met up almost every day in the year following the war, but then Harry left Auror training, Ron and Hermione broke up, and things were too awkward for a while. They were never quite the same again. They’d all shut the door on their Hogwarts years, and it changed the dynamics of their relationship. It took a while before they were able to see each other without bringing up the break-up. Tonight, they’d have something different to talk about, because Harry didn’t want them to find out in the
Harry had no idea how he could still move, but he managed to climb on the bed and sit on Draco’s lap. Draco’s hands roamed up and down his back, fingers dipped between his arse-cheeks and breached him. Harry breathed out and kissed Draco, then tilted his head up when Draco slid into him. Harry was still slightly sore from earlier, but the sensation faded quickly.
“Yeah, but don’t give any to the Pygmy Puffs even if they beg.”
“Happy birthday. This is for you.”
Draco tugged at his hand, and Harry walked behind him to exit the passage, before catching up with him to press himself against Draco’s side. “We had Santa’s visit,” Draco sneered, contempt dripping from his words. “He hung magical mistletoe in the stairwell. I’m grateful I didn’t walk underneath.”
It was unfair how adorable he could be when he spoke about sex. They weren’t particularly adventurous, because their sex life didn’t need spicing up—Potter didn’t mind sex with Draco (and
Before getting dressed in his silk pyjamas, Draco cast a detection spell to ensure that no trace of the smell lingered. Satisfied, he grabbed a pain-reliever and Flooed back to Potter’s quarters, only to find him glowering in bed. He had a book in his lap but wasn’t reading it.
The Hermione Harry loved so much wouldn’t. The traumatised, stubborn woman he’d parted ways with? Perhaps not today, after so long, but he wasn’t quite sure. Probably not without healing. He took a few deep breaths to dampen the rage bubbling up in his chest and thought about the manipulative bastards who would stop at nothing to further their agenda, spreading lies and twisting stories to their liking. The press made money, and the people ate it all up. Harry thought about his—
There was that, too: Harry’s idiotic, inconvenient crush on both his arch-enemy and a portrait. He’d woken up on the third day with the realisation that he was well and truly gay, had always been, and maybe there was a tiny attraction to women somewhere, but it might just have been his brain trying to fake it. The lack of reaction to full-blooded Veela, or even to Fleur, should have been his first clue.
“Good morning.” He enlarged his signed copy of Scorpius’ guardianship papers and placed it on the desk. “I’m here to take care of this.”
“Huh?”
Ron looked thoughtful, then glanced at Harry. “I’ll be right back. Office raiding time.”
“Er, Malfoy, you okay?” He may hate the fucking prick, but he didn’t want him dead. He silently berated himself for duelling, again—for letting his screwed-up mind take over because trauma dictated how he reacted if faced with hostility. He hadn’t wanted to fight. He’d just hoped to figure out what Malfoy was doing, sneaking around all year, but Malfoy had been
“Malfoy, what the fuck?”
His first instinct is to tell him that of course, he doesn’t want him there, followed by a few well-chosen insults. His brain makes itself useful and prevents him from blurting it out, choosing different words instead. “I don’t care.” A pause. “Tired of your fangirls?” He attempts a sneer and fails because Potter isn’t looking at him anymore, already slumping into a nearby couch.
He expected the usual polished stone, almost black with a shimmer of silver, but he was instead met with the most gorgeous fire opal. The Malfoy Crest shone in its centre.
Then Harry says, “You don’t need to be good if you want to see my Basilisk.” And Draco wants to bury his face in his hands, but all he does is snort and poke his shoulder repeatedly. It’s become a habit lately.
Two hours is too long. If it’s already that bad, Harry definitely doesn’t want to see how it’ll be later today. Cho must have noticed his unease, because she tells him to use the Apparition point between Whizz Hard Books and the
Draco was standing still, pale as a ghost, a suspicious shine in his eyes, chest rising and falling in quick succession.
Harry woke up alone in a cold and dirty bed, feeling well-rested, so he must’ve dozed off for a good sleep cycle. He confirmed it with a silent
“No, I decided to get one, anymore tips?”
“I said
Ona cackled. “No, you won’t. You need her too much. Hey, Cassius, remember how they couldn’t stop staring at each other?”
Harry’s next tattoo is a snake around his ankle, and Draco gets a Snitch on his right collarbone on the same day. The tattoo artist has no clue what he drew, and Draco panics about the Statute of Secrecy, which Harry thinks is endearing. Draco is such a worrywart. He finds something to ruminate on every single day. Yesterday was the tattoo, and last night, he went on and on about a noise he’d noticed in his kitchen at night (it came from the fridge). They’re so comfortable with each other that Draco saw no issue with intruding into Harry’s bedroom before dawn to ask him what in the world that buzzing, clickety sound was, and what if they had a Ghoul infestation? When Harry thinks of their conversation in Knockturn Alley all those months ago, he remembers finding Draco calm, collected and almost suave, which was a far cry from the kid who’d rolled around in the dirt whining about his imminent death when Buckbeak scratched his arm. Okay, Harry has now seen the scar from that, and it was a bit more than a scratch, but still, calm and collected isn’t what Malfoy used to be. Turns out he still isn’t, but he only ditches the mask in trusted company. Living under the same roof afforded Harry a privileged insight into Draco’s true self.
“The spiky ball. Uncle Blaise says it hurts real bad if you walk on it.”
“I’ll tell you all about her and Dad, but let’s do things in the right order. Do you want to call me Cousin Harry? Or Uncle?” Both grimaced at the same time. “No, that’s like being Dudley or Vernon. Call me Jim.”
He loses his balance and Potter screams for help.
He blamed it on his third Mojito and headed to bed without a care in the world.
Potter smirked, and it was infuriating, but at least he stayed in the same spot, busying himself by untying his shoelaces. Satisfied, Draco dashed into the nearest bathroom—a simple loo and sink—and replaced the empty roll of toilet paper. He then ran towards the warded Muggle room and made sure the protective spells were still functional, before inspecting the kitchen and finally, the living room. It wasn't that bad, really. Just a pile of laundry on the couch, old magazines piled up on a coffee table, and an empty vial of Pepper-Up Potion on the floor. Draco sighed and flicked his wand to take care of the mess. He was very much aware that as a wizard able to clean a room in a few seconds, leaving his belongings everywhere was more than laziness, it was some sort of spite against the household gods or some other rebellious action. With every item now back where they should be, he quickly locked his bedroom door, glanced at the veranda, and finally accepted that perhaps he'd been smart enough to hide his toys before going to Ethiopia. He'd never live through the shame if Potter saw Mr Cockzilla. It should be safe and snug in a drawer in the main bathroom.
Ridiculous sentimentality or not, Draco wasn’t ashamed to be in love.
Draco’s not in love with Astoria; she doesn’t love him, either, but they care for each other, and she understands that he refuses to speak. She doesn’t judge him. She doesn’t try to make him forget. Draco’s not in love, but he still loves her.
“If I must.” With a forlorn look, Draco walked beside him. “We should come back.”
Prompt for this chapter:
It’s dinner time when Teddy asks about Scorpius’ magic, impressed by whatever the tiny urchin has done while Draco was cooking.
His Godfather perked up and dragged Remus away under Mother’s unamused glance. Draco stifled a laugh, and when Mother was busy sharing tales of his childhood’s shenanigans with Aunt Andromeda, he laced his fingers with Harry’s and started walking away before Dumbledore could bother them. After discovering the truth about Number 3, Privet Drive, which had become necessary when the shade of the Dark Lord had forever been banished to the realm of the dead, the Headmaster kept trying to invite them for tea.
The lack of money had taken some pressure off the gift-giving process. No one expected Draco to outdo himself every year anymore, not even Pansy, who would have to contend with a new set of makeup. Not that Wood didn’t pay him well, but nobody earning an average salary would buy a Firebolt III as a Christmas gift.
Draco hums and sits on the couch. “Well, I happen to agree with her. Do you want to do it?”
Harry carefully applies the aftercare lotion on his new tattoo, taking his time on the locket scar, which is now partially hidden under a vertical depiction of the phases of the moon down his sternum. The right half of his upper chest displays the shape of a dog, a wolf and a deer, wispy and smoky, like a Patronus. They fade into lilies wrapped around Harry’s collarbone. Draco didn’t lie about the pain, but by Merlin, that spot in the corner of his underarm almost caused him to pass out. The needles punctured his skin for nine hours, and once the adrenalin vanished around the three-hour mark, it was no longer that easy. Harry must’ve become soft since the last time he was under the Cruciatus. Still, he’s already planning the next one. He wants Hedwig on his arm.
Draco’s pride wants to show them that he’s fine, he’s alive, and it’s all thanks to their precious Saviour. Scarhead stood on the witness stand at his trial, defended him, managed to limit his punishment to 10 months in Dementor-free Azkaban when the entire Wizarding World called for him to rot. He saved Draco’s mother, too. Draco doesn’t blame him for staying silent about Lucius.
“Did I ever thank you for doing this for me?” he asked, twisting Draco around to embrace him.
Harry clucked his tongue. “You don’t. I expect you to return the favour, or no one will believe us about this place.” He snapped a few more pictures, then approached him. “It’s somewhere here?”
One day, he’ll be among them to welcome Mother and Pansy and Blaise and Scorpius, too. But right now, he only has eyes for the man who’s holding him and whispering sweet nothings into his ear.
Prompt for this chapter:
Harry had just filled a plate with a variety of biscuits, including a few of the gingerbread men, when the doorbell rang. He tripped over his own feet in his hurry to welcome his guest.
There’s a knock at the door later that evening, after Harry spent the afternoon hiding in his bed. He’s not in the mood to talk to anyone after his harrowing experience. He didn’t even unshrink the books when he arrived home, just headed straight to bed. But the knocking is insistent and gets on Harry’s nerves, and he thinks he’ll feel better if he yells at someone, so he Apparates downstairs and opens the door.
“Oh, I can hardly wait.”
It’s not a question, which makes Harry wonder how atrocious he actually looked two weeks ago. “It’s that visible?”
Lethargy envelops them, and eventually, Harry smacks his forehead. “I’m out of potion.”
(Image: A man wearing a red Christmas sweater with two male reindeers shagging.)
He drank a sip and clucked his tongue. His breath was visible. “Fuck this.
“I—I’m good,” Harry said to reassure him, and Draco dropped to his knees.
Harry unzipped the tent and immediately cast a cooling charm on himself. Leaving the vicinity of the magical temperature regulator they’d brought with them was always a shock. He found Draco at the mouth of the canyon they’d slept in, casting spells at the sand. “What are you doing?”
“I swear I’m not,” he says. “Dating or — the other thing.”
“Of course!” Ginny looked at them both as if they’d grown antlers. “It’s something to do when life is dull.”
"Oh, gods I've been eating trash pizza my entire life!"
Kreacher interrupts them when he’s done and takes the remains of the Basilisk away with a new task: find the best offers and stay away from British wizards and illegal organisations. There’s nothing left of the carcass when they walk back out, and their adventure of the day ends on a somewhat humorous note: McGonagall catches them in Myrtle’s bathroom just as the sink moves back into its original position.
Harry doesn’t ask what Draco is doing in his kitchen. Why would he? Draco doesn’t complain when Harry slips into his living room through the back door in the morning, attracted by the scent of coffee. They share breakfast downstairs, dinner upstairs, and lunch in the garden. Harry eats more often, and puts some effort into his cooking, using a book Hermione gave him to celebrate his decision to leave London. His heart doubles in size when he remembers the pride in her eyes.
Now Potter looks at him again and the way his eyes sparkle in amusement twists his stomach. “Don’t insult peacocks, Potter, they are majestic creatures,” Draco drawls, but he’s not sincere because peacocks are not majestic, they’re a nuisance, and he should know. He still has scars on the back of his legs. Birds are messengers of evil. That includes Hagrid’s overgrown chickens.
Well. Not
There would always be pain, but they’d all chosen to remember the good times, and Harry had to admit it helped. This Christmas, the sorrow was a mere flicker, quickly smothered by the laughter of small children.
“They’re targeting people for wearing green and silver at school or having a distant cousin they never even met who happened to agree with Voldemort!” Harry replied hotly.
Harry narrowed his eyes, taking in the Slytherin’s features. He looked quite good under the flickering light of the torch. Not that Harry would ever admit it. It must have been the hair, no doubt. It was the best-looking hair in the entire school, after all. That was a fact. Nothing wrong with realising that part. “It’s under my pillow,” he replied, all the while wondering why he’d left it there.
“Huh, you cleaned up,” Harry observes, a finger trailing on a shelf.
Harry grins, but it’s not a nice smile. There’s a sharp edge to it, one that shows that he’s had enough. “He’s spreading tales of me being a traitor, too, and Ron took offence. Pomfrey won’t heal him, and Dean threatened to break up with him. Draco, nobody hurts the people I love, and I won’t leave your side.”
Draco didn’t care. She could scream for help all she wanted. “What the fuck is wrong with you?” he snarled. She looked at him with the disdain he’d grown so used to over the years.
Harry’s heart dropped, remembering Slytherin’s earlier words. “We can’t.”
Harry’s eyes widened, and he heard Draco’s quiet gasp. Molly blushed and tutted, then turned her warm gaze on them. “It’s such a good picture, dears.”
There weren’t many ways to introduce Little Draco to the Muggle world and hold his interest. He was already following Lucius’ footsteps, knowing absolutely nothing about what lay beyond Malfoy Manor and believing his family was superior to all others. Draco could work with that: familial superiority was better than blood supremacy. That part came during his first year at Hogwarts when Granger kept beating his scores. He still had some time.
And his thoughts circled back to the Burrow and what would happen if someone did indeed choose to bestow a gift upon him, and no, he wouldn’t go down this rabbit hole, he didn’t need the additional anxiety.
When he pushed the Tupperware aside, he noticed, for the first time, that something was different about his living space. He knew every nook and cranny of his cupboard, could even see the pattern on the wood under each step above his head in his sleep. That extra door had not been there before.
He left the boathouse to find his boyfriend again, and when he did, he hugged him and kissed him in full view of their friends and families.
Numbness spread in his limbs like nothing could surprise him anymore. He jerked his head a little and then, the snake grew and morphed into a man, who gave him a small smile.
Following that night, they’d argued about Dumbledore’s meddling and what they should avoid doing if they didn’t want the bearded, well-intentioned old fool messing with their plans. They’d ultimately agreed to keep him in the dark as much as possible if it didn’t mean sacrificing a child’s well-being.
Thor whined, breaking the silence. With a chuckle, Harry decided to take him for a short walk. Draco chose to go to bed. Wishing him good night, the black-haired man put on his shoes and coat, and got ready to walk into the cold night, alone with his thoughts and with a growing crush that, he was forced to admit, might have existed for a very long time and gone dormant.
I’m going to Azkaban, Draco thought, weakened by the loss of adrenaline in his brain. He started shaking, leaning into the Weaselette’s touch unconsciously while Longbottom conjured a Patronus.
Harry and Draco don’t have drunk sex in dark alleys, or have a membership to Madame Lovebite’s Chamber of Secrets in Knockturn. They also don’t share amateur recordings on the brand new Flooporn Network. The media’s most recent scoop talked about how they invite others in their bed, and Harry, who is now well-aware that he is on the asexual spectrum and is unable to even think about being touched by someone he’s not in love with, found it hilarious. They’re just a couple who bicker about the type of sheets they need to buy and on which side of the plate the knife should go (
He follows his own advice, though he hesitates five times before he even puts his shoes on. It’s often a fight against his own head to get things done; no one seems to understand how much effort goes into the simplest things, why running away is so much easier. He focuses on his goal: buying a book. He doesn’t have an owl, for two reasons: one, he’s still grieving Hedwig, and two, if he had one, he’d owl-order everything and never set foot outside ever again. It’s one way to force himself to do things.
Draco had escaped a few occasions to watch them like he did with most movies. Hermione had a warded room where technology worked and she often organised movie nights. Since she lived with Blaise, Draco was usually invited, but went home early if he did show up. He didn’t say it, but Harry knew movies freaked him out. On top of it, Draco disliked feeling inadequate or ignorant. Science-fiction, or anything dealing with Muggle technology, was too complicated to wrap his head around. Harry could understand that. He’d felt much the same way upon discovering magic, except to him, magic was a promise; it was a world without the Dursleys. Technology brought nothing but confusion to Draco’s mind. He did enjoy Willow, though, so it wasn’t like he hated every film in existence.
Readjusting his hold on the ice cream container, Harry stood up and glanced behind his shoulder. The iron gate blurred. It would disappear in a few seconds. Even if nothing followed Harry beyond this point, he still checked every time. Satisfied, his heartbeat back to a normal rhythm, Harry walked down the twisty path shielded by Wiggentrees until the house appeared. Much like Number 12 Grimmauld Place, it only revealed its presence when Harry was near, but it didn’t push aside any building. Instead, the house, and anything beyond the iron gate, existed in a bubble. It wasn’t squished between the crooked buildings of Horizont Alley; there was no sign of a city on the other side of the wall surrounding the property. From inside the walls, the view was a vast expense of nothing, though the sky was still there. It might still rain. Much like the Room of Requirement, the space existed on a different plane. It suited Harry; he enjoyed the quiet.

Stupid Gryffindors with no concept of personal space. This would never happen in a Slytherin environment. It wasn’t even worth it; their Santa brought cheap candy and low-quality chocolate that tasted like soap and sugar and had the barest artificial cocoa flavour. They could at least purchase them from Honeydukes if imported Muggle chocolate was too expensive, but no, that was too much to ask.
Blaise raised his glass and winked at Pansy. “What she said. She’s with him now.”
Harry shook his head, but he rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder. “I’ll be fine.”
Oh, good. Harry understands Hermione’s wish to move away from here, and Draco is used to the countryside, so perhaps a small town would do. “Let’s go, then. Any idea?” They step outside, leaving a forlorn employee behind. The nearest alley is perfect to Apparate.
“If Master Harry repurchases the stickers, Kreacher won’t care if Kreacher needs to crawl into the oven to punish himself, Kreacher will stab Master Harry in his sleep!”
, he’s distracted. He wants to sleep in Scorpius’ room, and Harry is having none of it. The prat is too relaxed about the events, in Draco’s opinion. It’s odd because Harry is usually the mother hen when it comes to their son. But then Harry Accio’s a piece of parchment and holds it in front of Draco’s face, and everything snaps into place.
Harry jumped aside to let the mountain of fabric zoom past him and throw itself at Draco, pushing him hard enough that he fell on the floor, all tangled up. Harry couldn’t help it and snorted loudly, then helped his sputtering boyfriend and carried the blankets to the sofa. “Come on,” he patted the seat beside him. Sulking, Draco joined him, and they spent the next minute rearranging the blankets around their bodies.
Harry grins, and Draco melts. “Maybe I should sleep here more often. I’ve rarely slept so well. Oh, did you see the name on the dragon?”
“You must eat, child.”
Snorting, Potter turned around, and Draco played with a very stubborn curl falling over his faded scar. His glasses reflected the lights from the tree. “You’re being dense on purpose.”
“When do you start?”
Harry stays in the back garden for a long time. Andromeda joins him, and they don’t talk, but it feels good to be there with her.
They ate and drank and ate again. They learned how magical education worked, argued about the Quidditch World Cup, tasted home-made alcohol and listened to a local band. Draco’s eyes glittered, his hair stuck to his forehead and he had dirt on his cheek; when a drop of sweat ran down his neck, Harry groaned. He was in so much trouble.
He ran into Ron before reaching the door and thought the Auror robes did his complexion no favour. Apologising for being on edge and not watching where he was going, he noticed he was already calming down—and it made him all the more thankful to have talked to him at the party. Their friendship would never fully recover, but at least he wasn’t filled with dread at the sight of him.
Smearing tears and snot on Jim’s shirt, Harry shook his head. “‘m not very hungry.”
Draco knows all about the weight of expectations. Honestly, it’s astonishing that Harry managed to go through more than a year of training with his history and trauma. It breaks his heart to understand that he did it to satisfy other people when he, more than anyone else, deserves some serenity and the freedom to choose his future.
Harry dropped his head on Draco’s chest and smothered hysterical laughter.
He drank his orange juice and set those thoughts aside. Luckily, Potter hadn’t noticed he’d drifted off. Draco had no wish to revisit his past mistakes at the breakfast table. Instead, he focused on a wooden bell hanging on the pantry door, painted red and gold. “What’s this?” He tilted his head towards it.
“Whose?” A yawn draws out Goyle’s voice. The poor bloke looks dead on his feet. He has twins who don’t yet sleep through the night.
“Draco, if you finish that sentence, I’m divorcing you.”
“A flaming bird brought a guest to the Manor, and Luna stayed behind with him.”
“A rich sympathiser? A History nerd? If you don’t try, you’ll never know.”
“You’re the one who chose Turkey.”
Today, Harry was wearing robes because he liked looking like a real wizard. He wanted to be elegant like Draco. Often, they would team up because Jim was very bad at dressing himself, but Jim had made an effort today. That was good. Harry understood everything about good first impressions. Uncle Vernon always said it was essential, and Draco excelled at it; Harry didn’t want to imitate Uncle Vernon and didn’t think his moustache made him as distinguished as Vernon believed. Draco had said it made him look like a walrus.
notebook and biro.” Grey eyes narrowed. “I am not Summoning ink ever again, thank you!” He caught the flying objects, placed his wand back on the table, and jotted a few notes.
His mother was there, unconscious, on the floor. He still couldn’t move.
Teddy loved Winter Wonderland, and Harry couldn’t blame him. Though it looked a little empty at first, by nightfall, the lights came on, and the whole atmosphere changed. There were no statues; it wasn’t cold enough. But there was a small dragon roller coaster that Teddy fell in love with, and Harry got to witness Narcissa’s bafflement at Muggle ingenuity. It was a different experience, seeing it through a child’s eyes. Instead of going from stall to stall and enjoying food (and kisses), Harry and Draco were dragged into a surprisingly creepy haunted mansion—Harry jumped in his seat more than once, and Draco swore he’d never go back in there, but Teddy laughed the whole time.
“Yes, well, I believe you are familiar with the lethargic effect of depression.” Draco turns his head away, his hair obscuring his face once more.
“Isn’t
At the thought, a thrill went through Harry’s brain. A few days ago, the notion would have sounded idiotic, at best, but he had no idea back then that they would get on so well.
“You have no idea.”
She stepped through the Floo and came back barely thirty seconds later with a pile of books. She reminded Harry of her younger self when excitement overrode her instinct to follow the rules. He hadn’t seen her like this since Hogwarts.
“I’m insane,” he huffed to himself.
With a quick nod towards the elf (who still worshipped Harry as the avenger of Master Regulus), Harry handed him the ice cream. “Hi Kreacher. Those should go into the stasis cupboard, please?”
“I’m not the one spending five hours in front of the mirror every day.”
He checks the wards around the house one last time, grabs the luxury food basket he bought this morning, and Apparates to Ottery St. Catchpole. He’s nervous as the Burrow looms over him.
“Yet.”
Once again, the rooms were identical. Draco had laid out his silk pyjamas on the bed, and Harry found himself remembering how good he looked in them. “You’re sure one night is fine?” Harry pointed at the suitcase. Draco only unpacked if they stayed somewhere for more than twenty-four hours.
“Rats?” Harry asked, tilting his head at Ron.
With the thought of Malfoy keeping his irritation at bay and his cup of tea intact, Harry finds himself wondering what his ex-nemesis is up to these days. Everyone is going on like the war never happened. Is he doing the same? Is he a Potions Master, is he married? Perhaps he even has kids, he wouldn’t be the only one. He’s young, but Harry’s parents had him at twenty, and Malfoy is a Pureblood. Surely it’s not that much of a stretch. Disgraced or not, names mean something in their world.
Surprise flickered in Malfoy’s eyes. “Abel, the man you met at the hostel, is a bouncer. He told me to apply for a waiter position and shortly after, I replaced the other bartender. The hours were convenient when Scorpius was smaller.” He crossed his legs and smirked. “What’s the story between you and the Weaselette?”
Harry was a bit out of his depth here, like always when he roamed around a toy store. Since he never had toys as a child, the sight of so many objects created to bring joy to kids (and money to a corporation) was still alien to him. He enjoyed playing Legos with Teddy but had to admit he hadn’t known what to do at first. Playing was a disconcerting experience. Draco didn’t have that problem; he had the attention span of a bloody fruit fly now that they were away from the display cases holding miniature replicas of various swords and staffs. He couldn’t get enough of this place and was bouncing around like a child. What had Draco said yesterday? Harry shouldn’t go alone in a toy store or he’d never get out?
“I’m not! I swear.”
Teddy’s attempt at a coconut muffin wasn’t that bad in comparison. Does Draco know food isn’t supposed to look like jellified Polyjuice?
“It’s a hedjog!”
He was not ready; he thinks as he’s staring at the eager crowd and seeing their hero-worship. Some, like the Weasleys, act with dignity. They’re in the first row, Molly has her arms around George’s shoulders and Bill is holding Fleur’s hand. Andromeda stayed home; she never attends, it’s too hard for her. Ron and Hermione are standing behind Harry, with McGonagall, Flitwick, Neville, Dennis, and everyone else who has words to share after him. The moon is visible, the first stars are shining. It’s such a gorgeous evening, yet it’s so much worse than last year’s event.
“I’d be glad to.”
He also understood how much Sirius loved him at that moment, and his magic sung.
The clock was ticking. Draco attempted to warm his hands by breathing on them and rubbing them together, but it didn’t help much, so he paced in the small space until he felt the tingling of the wards allowing Potter through. There was a crack as Potter Apparated from the inner edge of the wards to the boathouse.
“Point.”
Word after word let him peek through the surface of the rock, deeper with each sentence. It was like peeling an onion. Veins of minerals formed complex, shiny pathways, taking over Harry’s field of vision as his mind dove into the darkness. Then the mineral trails vanished, and he felt like falling. His eyes sprung open, and he squinted at the sunlight. His heart was beating faster and his cheeks hurt from smiling so much.
They did not have a dominant/submissive relationship in the slightest; not that there was anything wrong with those, but it didn’t appeal to them. But they both thought their friends’ theories were endless sources of entertainment. Draco enjoyed being mysterious; his parlour was his workspace where he exaggerated some of his personality traits, and yes, he had cat-like tendencies, but he was also a dork who took the Pygmy Puffs on walks around the property and talked to Bowtruckles. He drank far too much tea, woke up several times at night, and came back to bed grumpy, spewing vitriol about possessing a bladder. He complained about Harry’s hair, Harry’s lacklustre ability to cut vegetables in even slices, Harry’s body heat in summer, Harry’s cold toes in winter, Harry’s snores when Harry had a cold, Harry’s clothes—and Harry took it all in stride. After all, he, too, found many reasons to tease and annoy Draco. It was part of their dynamic. It confused everyone.
come Monday, unless a special Sunday edition was released tomorrow, so perhaps it was better this way? Mother and Andromeda didn’t seem to mind, only displaying polite curiosity. As for Teddy, love wasn’t an interesting topic yet, and he moved on. What warmed Draco’s heart was that Potter’s grip on his hand didn’t falter at all.
“I’m not ashamed, I don’t see the point of speaking about it — wait, how did we get to that conversation?”
Noodle was quite good at detecting malevolence, so Harry felt reassured, even if the way the hole was hidden brought up a variety of terrifying scenarios.
The live band comes on stage, and the first notes bring Harry’s attention back from wherever it drifted off to. The music provokes nasty emotions tied to those old feelings of abandonment, and Draco notices immediately. His lips brush against Harry’s ear.
Harry shook his head. His throat was dry, and his hands sweaty. Malfoy took a step forward, limping, and turned to look at him. “That’s the Chamber of Secrets. That’s a—that story was real?”
“You know she’ll find something to say about your champagne.”
“Mango juice for both of us.”
Life gets easier. Harry doesn’t realise it right away, but he’s trying a new brownie recipe when it hits him. He drops the empty box of cocoa powder, but catches it before it reaches the floor. He puts it on the kitchen table and gazes at the ingredients around him.
Potter leaned back against the countertop with a sheepish grin. “I bought some last year—cute snowflakes, Teddy loved them. He stuck them to every window. They’re supposed to come off with water, but I forgot to remove them, and I left them too long. As soon as the weather got hotter, they melted.”
“Of course!” Harry could feel the heat on his face. “I’m having an amazing time.”
Gaze directed towards the ceiling, Harry shrugs. “Dunno. I guess.”
“Okay. Okay, I’m in.” He breathed out and let out a watery laugh. “I—Magic would take your land’s history and your tastes into consideration, so it wouldn’t look shabby. We can have a dog, and, maybe we can do something with all this space. Like, fruit trees and a Quidditch pitch. And another Winter Wonderland. But not next year, because we’re going to the tropics, and I’m rambling, please stop me.”
Harry heard her tell someone to fuck off when she walked out of the tiny alley and onto the street, so a photographer must’ve ambushed her hoping to catch Harry by her side. Harry rolled his eyes and looked up at the window above them. “Should I go up there and say hi?” It wasn’t like he didn’t want to see his former teammates, but he would be roped into a conversation and would lose some precious moments with Draco.
“Master Draco needs to shut up now. Kreacher is talking.”
“I didn’t look at it,” he confessed, and Draco wiggled his toes. “But it had a shadow—like the first one I saw in the graveyard.”
“This is absolutely ridiculous, and I still cannot believe we did it. No, in fact, I do believe it, but what was I thinking, going along with your insanity?” Draco stared at the Muggle ID card proclaiming his new identity in bold letters. “Just look at that picture, for Merlin’s sake!”
When a stag Patronus burst into his living space a few hours later to tell him the house was ready, Draco grabbed his bag and without a backwards glance, Apparated to Islington.
Harry grabs his Firebolt so that they can get back out of the Chamber easily. They walk hand in hand in the empty corridors, ignoring the portraits’ whispers, though it’s very hard not to stare at Sir Cadogan making a fool of himself to impress a group of witches. Harry’s thumb strokes the back of his hand, and he smiles, a little sadly. “We had him guarding the entrance of the Tower in third year.”
He did his best to put these thoughts to the back of his mind and distracted himself with a simple observation of his home.
Teddy bounced on his feet. “Can we get Indian?” Then he looked back at Harry and Draco, who stood awkwardly as the crowd pushed their way around them. “Can Draco and Harry come too?”
“Nah,” Gabriel said. “Too annoying. It was not my idea, by the way. Blame Gregory.”
“Mate, you’re not fooling me. When are you proposing?”
“Very well. In the meantime, you are his temporary guardian. They have no say until September.”
“Many legs?”
and found three Disillusioned wizards and one witch much closer than they should be. The witch, dressed in full Auror regalia, dropped her concealment charm and walked up to the gate, stopping when the wards vibrated. Draco’s stomach dropped.
When morning came, Draco didn’t remember falling asleep in his clothes, but his mood was excellent. Sleeping in Harry’s arms healed every ache.
“Or you’re not dating?” Hermione gasps and puts her teacup down. “I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed, I keep forgetting casual sex is a thing, with everyone around us being in a relationship. Is that why you didn’t tell us? Or is it too fresh, and you didn’t want to jinx it? Oh, is she a Muggle?”
And he did. Not often, and not with nefarious purposes. It was just—Potter’s apathy and discomfort seemed to lessen when Draco pretended to be his old self. He often wondered if Potter found it reassuring. It gave people another reason to hex him in the corridors, though, which was how he’d found himself in Myrtle’s company again.
It happens suddenly. A familiar jet of green light, the silence of a laugh cut short, the eerie motion of a body crumpling, too slow and too fast all at once. And that frozen smile, those green eyes losing their shine—it happens, and there’s nothing Draco can do to stop it.
Harry is confused; a conflict is raging in him, because Malfoy is a rude twat, but he saw Harry struggling, he helped him out of what must have been a panic attack, and brought him exactly what Harry needs. He understood. Harry wants to cry. Hope, tentative and shy, peeks through Harry’s exhaustion.
Draco lets out a puff of air against his collarbone, snuggling up to him. “Since when do you care about rules, Golden Boy?”
The Weaselette stood in front of him. “Welcome home, I guess. That lazy lump is Thor, and I see he already adopted your son. He’s harmless. All he does is sleep and eat. Not living up to his name at all.” She pointed at a door next to the stairs. “Your son’s room. Yours is upstairs. There’s a Cushioning Charm around the stairs for wandering gremlins who need their dad in the middle of the night. Make yourself at home!”
“Is it possible to work with curses even if I don’t know Runes or Arithmancy?”
She pokes his arm. “You look so much happier, you’re visiting me when I didn’t beg you to, and you keep missing pub night. That’s how. There aren’t many explanations, I believe.”
still paints him as someone who can be found in Quidditch Quality Supplies or in one of the bars on Horizont Alley — they portray him as this boisterous, confident man who graces the list of the Most Eligible Bachelors of the year, but Harry has no idea where this is coming from. No one knows he’s a shut-in with spikes of anxiety and depression. Whoever writes these articles must have known his dad. It sounds like him. If they get wind that he prefers the quiet of a bookshop, his insane fans will take a closer look. Let them believe he can be found at Broomstix.
Draco will have to add magic to Scorpius’ tutoring, and it’s a bit scary—Draco is no teacher. But he can’t expect Harry to come home from work just to teach even more, so he’ll learn. At least, Teddy will be more than happy to do it this summer. It’s not like they care about not using magic outside of school.
to Severus, if you need help.
“Objection!” Ron bleated. “Not
Scarhead grinned, making Draco’s stomach flutter.
His skin was burning. His throat hurt; his eyes barely saw anything through his tears. There was no way out. He couldn’t move; his body didn’t respond.
“Ron, swallow before you speak, honestly!” She squeezed Harry’s fingers. “I told Blaise this morning.”
“I know what Legos are, and they don’t talk.”
“Of course not. This isn’t an abuse case, this is a- whoever wrote this wants to take this boy away and found a convenient excuse. This is barely legal. Malfoy has too many restrictions to get out of this and would be unable to hire a solicitor.” He read the parchment again. “You signed this.” He chuckled. “You actually signed.”
He unclasped his pinched-waist robes so he’d be more comfortable, sunk into the armchair with a sigh of relief, and summoned the book, eager to start.
“Freddie didn’t like noise,” she murmurs, rubbing her thumb on Harry’s pulse point. “Unless he and George caused it. It’s strange for someone who thrives on chaos, isn’t it? But when he was very young, he escaped family events and hid in Arthur’s shed. George always found him first. He’d bring him back to us, sometimes, but more often than not, he’d drag him back inside the house.” Harry can’t bring himself to look at Molly’s face, because her hand is shaking, and he fears what he would see in her eyes. Molly sighs, then laughs softly. “Imagine how the house looked when I found them. Every time.”
She tightens her hold on him, and he lets himself cry on her shoulder.
For some reason, he’s unable to picture Malfoy with a wife on his arm. Harry takes a sip of his tea, which is cold, and puts the cup back on the table. The grandfather clock in the corner chimes and Harry winces. He’s keeping the clock as a reminder that time is a thing and that staying in bed all day is a terrible idea, but he often contemplates obliterating the inconvenient device. He’s not sure what to do today and wishes he could ponder about Malfoy’s private life in peace without that niggling bit of guilt harassing him. At the moment, it’s telling him he has nothing to do, the last book he enjoyed is part of a series, and why doesn’t he go to Diagon Alley and buy the next one.
The twenty-fourth of December was a sunny but windy day; Draco decided to enjoy the sun while it lasted, and he dragged a chair near the window of the library. He hadn’t taken the time to really go through the books Harry hadn’t gotten rid of, because he’d been busy with work-sex-cuddles-going for walks with Harry. But today, he’d woken up worrying about his impending doom: the official invitation to spend Christmas Eve at the Weasley’s (brought to him by the tiny owl that he’d found so very cute at Hogwarts). And, true to himself, he wanted to drown his stress into a book, preferably something calming, like the one about the growth rate of lemon balm which emitted a lemony scent from page 5 to 10. It was a better way to deal with his emotions than what he’d often done in the past, which was stuff his face with something sweet, like the Yule log he’d devoured all on his own in fifth year because the Dark Lord was supposed to visit. He’d never looked at a Yule log the same way ever again.
Harry smirked and shook his head. He knew that Draco didn’t mean it; he might not enjoy the heat, but he loved the desert and its otherworldly wonders. He’d fallen in love with it when a curious fennec fox sniffed around their tent, before the sandstorm.
He smiled at the elf, free and lawfully employed since Granger’s anti-slavery campaign had made waves in the Pureblood community. Mopsy had been his nanny and now held a prestigious place as head of the Malfoy house-elves. “It’s good to see you, Mopsy. Is Mother available?”
flour.” Instant regret. “Who in Merlin’s name doesn’t reseal a pack of flour, Potter?!” he sputtered, shaking his head and rubbing his hair and face. He heard Harry failing to contain his laughter and as horrible as it felt to have flour up his nose, he conceded the reality of the situation: it was pretty funny.
He wasn’t in the mood to deal with them. He wasn’t in the mood to do anything but think about Draco, actually. He had the plans of the Manor on his desk and kept thinking that once it was rebuilt, Draco would leave Grimmauld Place, and his heart clenched painfully at the mere image of waking up alone. Hermione would berate him for his pessimism. She’d likely be right; Draco wouldn’t abandon Harry. Not now. They fit too well together.
The large scrying bowl filled with water swallowed Harry’s memory when Draco spilled it inside. It had been built like a Pensieve, so the memory was safe, though Harry wasn’t quite sure he wanted it back. He had to, however. Memories should never be discarded without a Mind Healer’s recommendation. While Draco mixed the silvery mist with the water, Harry opened the small chest beside him, and rolled a cigarette, knowing the exact amount of shrivelfig Draco required. He lit the cigarette for him and Draco thanked him without tearing his eyes away from the liquid.
Draco and Harry Apparated on the path leading to what once was the Manor’s gate, and Harry took a few pictures of the gentle shimmer indicating the edge of the wards. He then cast a mapping spell, and Draco pulled on his magical link to the place to allow him through the wards.
Something shatters, and Harry barely reacts. Today is an excellent day. He looks around and smiles at the sight of Hermione, hunched over her corner of the table, with tears of laughter running down her face. Next to her, Parvati is grinning like a mad fiend, and Luna is taking pictures with her bright green polaroid camera.
That did it. Malfoy jumped to his feet and ran towards Harry like his arse was on fire, eyes wide. He schooled his expression when he stopped, regaining his dignity—and it was a struggle not to snort. What an idiot.
He took a seat, opened the bottom drawer of his desk and grabbed his scrapbook, and stuck the parchment on a new page. He already had another book filled with brief notes or ridiculous drawings, and he threw none of them away, so he had to start a new one recently. Draco told him it was sappy, but his gaze softened each time he noticed Harry slipping one of his notes in his pocket.
Malfoy was smart, but not a bookish kind of smart. He didn’t remind him of Hermione. Instead, he oozed knowledge because it had been drilled into him from birth, and he understood it enough to explain it to all kinds of people. Which Harry knew Hermione struggled with because while she did understand what she was reading, she didn’t always manage to summarise it in a way that Harry and Ron would comprehend. Draco also had a highly analytical mind, which he revealed was quite helpful in Arithmancy and Potions (this led to an uncomfortable conversation where Harry admitted to owning an annotated book two years ago, but Malfoy had actually looked delighted to be let in on the secret. It meant Harry hadn’t suddenly gotten omniscient!)
It had taken them a month to find a magical artefact, out of the blue, but it was enough to convince them to keep up with their plan. Rogue archaeologists, unwelcome on dig sites, sneered at by academics—none of that mattered. They took a Portkey to Iran next, just because they could, and they’d been there long enough now that they already planned their next stop. Perhaps Egypt or Jordan. Though, right now, the rock Malfoy had noticed was a more immediate concern.
He waved and continued towards the office. When he entered, he waited for his turn, lucky to have arrived at the end of the previous visitor’s appointment.
They walked until they reached the edge of the Malfoy property, and Harry squeezed his hand. “Are you ready?”
The awkwardness grew until Harry had no choice but to ask about the baby, fidgeting with his wand. He wished he could join Ron, but this wasn’t a Hogwarts adventure. He could get in serious trouble if he were found snooping around the Auror Department.
Harry zones out, but it’s not because he wants to run away. He’s fine. He’s content. He has a good life, his job at the orphanage brings him joy, and he is loved. He has bad days, of course. The nightmares never truly go away, and the potion can only do so much. He’s seeing a Mind Healer, and has convinced Draco to make an appointment after a panic attack. Their healing is a process with many setbacks but it’s all right, they’re in this together, and their friends are here to remind them to communicate when things go wrong between them. Harry is proud of his past self for reaching out and explaining his emotions; without that, he might not be sitting in the Brewtiful Mandrake tonight.
Zabini owed Harry. Without his assistance, he wouldn’t be dating Hermione. It was only fair to ask him for help with Draco. So, Harry told him everything.
, after all. However, he’d still managed to get into this situation, because despite his magical prowesses, Potter was a clumsy oaf. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose.
It was true; he noticed as he glanced at his fingers, tapping on the pillow. He clenched and unclenched his fists, then traced the velvet and silver threads with his thumb. He hesitated, picturing yesterday’s meeting at Gringotts and hearing Salazar’s warnings about the Compass. He’d listened and didn’t tell Bill why he needed a Curse-Breaker’s containment unit, and Bill didn’t insist, only advising him to be careful. So here he was, with a resizable trunk capable of containing the darkest objects without letting any of the magic leak. The magic-suppressing box he’d found in Iran was so old that it might not be adapted to spells invented after the tenth century. After all, Harry expected to unearth more than just pieces of the Mind Compass. He’d also promised Bill to give him the location of his discoveries and never to enter a tomb or ritualistic area without a qualified Curse-Breaker. Would Hermione be so understanding? Harry didn’t know if she’d let it go. She’d realise right away that Harry had somehow put himself in some sort of danger; there’d be a new mystery to solve, and she might nag him a little—but he needed her help.
“You have Parseltongue—like I keep telling you. Why would you need anything more? You can learn as you go.”
The eggs were doing something weird. Maybe Draco shouldn’t have broken the shells? In potions, eggs ended up dissolving, but he didn’t think milk and flour had any property that could do that. It was getting quite lumpy.
Draco hands him the spatula after swiping his finger through the sauce. “Still, I will be prepared. Needs more salt, by the way.”
Harry’s heart aches. He clears his throat, and turns his attention to the kitten, which is curled into a ball and sleeping soundly. “I need to find a Kneazle for my godson.” There. That’s a safe topic.
The boathouse of Malfoy Manor had been built on the pond that Father insisted on calling a lake when Draco was too small to stare at him in disbelief. “Pond” wasn’t posh enough; telling people that yes, indeed, the Manor’s grounds included a lake was much more dignified.
“Of course you did.” Draco narrowed his eyes and his lips curved into a smirk. “I must say it’s rather convenient.” Draco’s mind reviewed the numerous things he’d like to do to him, to see his eyes pleading for release.
Harry pulls a chair, sits, and cuts two slices. “If you don’t like it, I’ll eat it, that’s fine.” He hands him a plate. “I’m proud of you.”
Dumbfounded, Harry blinked and stared at him. “But our History of Magic texts—”
“You’re a lot more put together than I am,” Harry observes, but he’s not so sure anymore. Also, he shouldn’t be happy about Malfoy’s failed nuptials.
He hates everything about this party.
Hogwarts is quiet; he can still hear the music outside, but it’s muffled, and it disappears as he walks down the corridor behind the main staircase. It leads to the kitchens. He stops in front of the painting, and in the end doesn’t tickle the pear, unwilling to face an army of overexcited elves. He turns around and heads to the first floor. There, he finds an empty classroom, closes the door and sits at a desk with a deep sigh. His chest aches, and before he can help it, tears are falling.
He sees understanding dawning in those thrice-damned eyes.
This was a big deal. The opening of the first-ever Museum of Magic, back in 2006, had encountered so much resistance that he’d feared his mum’s great project would meet a sad end. The Purebloods liked the idea of a place to revisit their long history but were reluctant to allow a Malfoy to represent them. They’d been seduced by the fact that none of them would need to pay a Sickle for it; Mother took care of everything, barely making a dent in their fortune even after the war reparations. The Muggleborns, Half-Bloods and so-called Blood Traitors had first thought the Museum would glorify blood purity, but they’d been wrong. The Museum was filled to the brim with pre-20th century History, granting enough space to notable Muggleborns, Squibs and Half-Bloods to satisfy their critics and progressive Minister (neither Mother nor Draco had fully gotten over their prejudices, but Draco, at least, was working on them). Professor Binns had even left Hogwarts and found a perfect spot to drone on and on about Goblin Rebellions in a dedicated section of the Museum. A successful venture with a complicated start that even led to a mandatory visit for all Muggleborn children and their parents, as an introduction to their new world. Inspired by the idea, Hogwarts had added two required first-year courses: Wizarding Traditions and a revised version of Muggle Studies.
“That depends on your definition of pain. I think both you and I are well-acquainted with it. It wasn’t pleasant on my wrist and elbow, but it’s nothing like Crucio. Why, do you want one?”
Draco had never been able to cast the Killing Curse; he had no doubt he could do it now. He kept his wand pointed at Hestia, his eyes flicking back and forth to keep everyone in sight.
“Master Draco is being sure? Master Draco is wanting to be poisoned?”
“Sorry. Memories.”
Slytherin rested his chin in his palm, elbow resting on something Draco couldn’t see in the painting. “Now that I have you both here, tell me: how come I can sense that you, Harry Potter, are a Parselmouth, yet you have yet to use that power?”
“Of course; you could always rent the second apartment, or turn it into something else entirely, even break down a wall or two. Come in, please.”
They’d been trapped long enough for Harry to get over his emotions and absorb everything he’d been told, but also for an odd sort of kinship to be born between him and Malfoy.
Draco tilted his head and finished his piece of bread. “He talks to snakes sometimes.”
“Hey,” Harry hummed, taking a seat and grabbing a piece of bread to start making his own sandwich. Draco nodded, his mouth full. “Huh, smoked salmon. Didn’t know we had any.”
“Thank you,” he sighed, pausing to lick into his mouth and moaning when Harry responded in kind. “Thank you for bringing them.”
“I think I don’t need to anymore. Always nice talking to you, Malfoy!” She slid off the desk and left with a spring in her step.
. Draco charged one drop for a consultation and treatment. Two, if it was urgent. Spilling magical essence was not taken lightly, and someone volunteering to part with four drops must have been desperate. Harry touched the black tourmaline pendant at his neck to ensure it was there, pushed his chair back, and opened the wooden wardrobe next to the grandfather clock. His dark red Auror uniform was squished behind a mountain of protective garments and he barely spared it a glance. He was no Auror; he may still be employed, but he had a resignation letter ready. It wasn’t like he would ever go back, even if he suddenly stopped seeing spirits. He was done with the Ministry. No, he wouldn’t be wearing that uniform any time soon. Instead, he opted for black combat robes designed to protect him against non-human, unearthly magic. He tightened the dragonskin wrist wraps, ensured they secured his wand to his forearm, and dropped a kiss on Draco’s lips.
every fleece blanket!”
“Blood purity is nonsense—you either have magic, or you don’t. Muggles, however, are a trickier subject. Do you know where this anti-Muggle sentiment comes from, Snakeling?”
The clock on the wall is still broken; Harry glances at it briefly, wondering why nobody bothers fixing it. Draco steals a fried calamari off his plate, his right arm slung loosely around Harry’s shoulders, tattooed fingers drumming on his chest. Harry squeezes his thigh under the table, and takes a sip of sparkling water. The barman’s reluctance in serving soft drinks is as strong as ever, and by now Harry orders it out of spite.
“Don’t push too hard.”
. Rise and devour.”
“If the Headmistress didn’t change her mind, in October. Slughorn can handle his regular schedule until then.”
“Of course. Maybe for the petrified students, too?” He winces slightly because Creevey is dead, but he’s sure his family would still appreciate a donation if the Malfoy name isn’t tied to it.
“You’ll fall if you keep this up,” Draco says. “Come with me?”
There was no word to describe what Harry was feeling. There was a foreign warmth in his chest and a tightness in his throat. He wanted to cry, laugh and dance. He was free. In the back of his mind, he started to realise that the tiles he was sitting on were real.
“You already know him, don’t fish for gossip,” Hermione said with a huff. “Harry, you didn’t ask me to visit for that, so what is it? You’ve been fidgeting.”
“I said I have it. Your wand. I kept it. Told the Ministry it was lost in the battle, or they’d have insisted about keeping it in the War Museum. I’ll just- I’ll get it.” And he ran down the stairs, flustered.
He breathed in the scent of Harry’s shampoo and looked at him, finding him smiling at the witches and wizards dancing in the grass. His hair was still long, but the grey streaks were broad and had spread to his short beard. He kissed the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes, and Harry smiled at him.
It works like a charm. Teddy forgets his toys and leaves his hiding place, following Harry into the kitchen. He’s still chewing when he reaches for a second biscuit. Harry lets him, but draws the line at the third one.
Warrington sat back down and pulled at his frizzy hair. “I’m trying to forget.”
“When in doubt, ask an Unspeakable.” Draco moved to stand up, hesitated, and instead gathered Harry into his arms.
Harry stares again. It’s quiet for a bit, until Draco snorts, and that’s when Harry loses control and laughs so hard he drops the plate. The squishy noise from the “cake” sends Draco into hysterics, and Harry isn’t far behind.
Giddy, Harry bumped his shoulder against his friend’s arm. “Hermione’s pregnant.”
When he observed his surroundings more closely, he found sketches of Hogwarts, drawings of people and creatures, and he found himself immersed in the real history of the first place he’d ever called home.
He Apparates home into their back garden in Hogsmeade with a giggling boy in his arms, because for some reason, Scorpius enjoys the feeling of being squeezed through a tube. The house stands on the outskirts of the village, near the cave where Sirius Black once dwelled, far enough to avoid the students’ prying eyes on Hogsmeade weekends. They can see the Shrieking Shack from the bathroom window, and the back of the house gives a great view of Hogwarts. It’s the most convenient location for Harry, who teaches Defence and didn’t want to live in the castle. Draco is a stay-at-home dad, but he likes to write when he has some free time. He's published quite a few textbooks under a pen name.
“Mione, is there anything you want to tell us?”
He’s ready to explain why the Transfiguration was an incredible display for such a young child, but then he hears a noise, looks up, and lets out a strangled sound. Their pet ferret, Slinky, is floating near the ceiling.
He enjoyed what he saw right now even more, though. Harry nibbled on his lower lip in that sexy way that made Draco’s knees weak. The man was still naive enough not to realise how some of his gestures affected him. Draco shifted in his seat, sighed, pushed a cup of Earl Grey towards him and gave him a pointed look. Time to stop complaining about their shared insanity.
Draco nearly fainted. Deep down, he knew Fawkes had only done as he’d told him to, but still, his son was gone. Any parent would panic. His disappearance put him even more on edge than he already was, and he stared at the fields around the cottage, waiting for any oddity, listening to unusual sounds. When Thor stood and growled, low and threatening, he cast
He’d had to find out in the papers. Granger wished to focus on her burgeoning career, Weasley wanted children, it didn’t work out. That happened in 2003; since then, Ronald got his wish with a Ravenclaw from their year, Morag MacDougal. They had three kids, the Weasel was a stay-at-home dad, and Granger changed people's lives daily. All was well. Her dating Blaise was interesting; staying at his place to babysit his child made her a clear winner in Draco’s heart (Matteo was also Gin Weasley’s son and thus close to Granger already). No matter what anyone said, he cared about his friends and their progeny.
They sit near the barrels, as the area is dry and lacks any sort of dark remnants. Draco uses a spell to clean Harry’s clothes, skin and hair as well as possible, earning an indignant squawk and getting the same treatment in return. He swears and shudders. It feels like being dunked in a cold bath. A warming charm later and Draco rests his head on Harry’s shoulder. Their fingers are laced together. If Draco isn’t careful, he’ll blurt out a love confession a bit too soon.
Laying on a beach at night is a familiar activity, and Harry rests his head on Draco’s chest. He spots five meteors in the first thirty seconds. “Perfect timing.”
He opened it, read the words, and jerked upright. As he ran after Draco, the piece of parchment was left behind on the bench. He stopped dead in his tracks, hesitated, then went back outside to pick it up.
“I’m sorry, did you bet on us?” Harry hissed between his teeth when Malfoy nearly crushed his hand.
At that, Malfoy suddenly started laughing, a barking laugh Harry had never heard before, full of mirth but with a smattering of sadness and anger underneath.
“Malfoy, if you don’t want me here, I can leave.”
The Weaselette, that traitor, pushed Draco forward, but he Apparated into his own office with just enough time to hear Ginny’s strangled squawk as she fell victim to their visitor. He locked the door, turned off the lights, and pretended he wasn’t there by hiding under his desk.
“Draco, Baileys or Kahlúa?”
They lost track of how many questions they’d asked so far. Harry was relieved that neither Ron nor Hermione featured in any of them; he was certain that Malfoy was curious about his past but respected his boundaries. Perhaps he should start calling him Draco.
Babies, graduations, birthdays, special events, the trip to Egypt, a lone photo of Harry and Ron playing chess—and amidst all of them, Draco and Harry smiling at each other in utter adoration under the mistletoe in the corner of Goyle’s shop.
“Okay.” Harry leaned towards Draco to kiss his pointy nose. He stood up, wished him good luck, and exited the room through the small door at the back. He never attended a consultation between Draco and his customers, but Kreacher always watched, invisible. The wizarding world would implode if Harry’s presence here ever made it to the papers. It had already seen a hint of the Apocalypse when Skeeter spotted Harry and Draco on a date three months ago; she didn’t know they lived together yet. Better keep it that way. However, Harry knew also that many still hoped Draco would slip up and end up in Azkaban, and he refused to let him take unnecessary risks. Draco was no slouch when it came to defending himself, but Kreacher was a perfect guardian who would banish someone out of the property with a snap of his fingers, and who was delighted to be Draco’s protector. Those who crossed Kreacher learned their lesson in painful ways.
The parchment duplicated itself, one copy flying to the filing cabinet, the other resting in his hands. Harry’s mind was a whirlwind of anger and relief. He gave his most sincere thanks to the man and left, the red of his ex-colleagues’ robes walking down the corridor catching his eye and making him want to retch.
“Honestly, you act like I’ll blurt your secrets to the whole world, both of you. There!” She gripped her book tighter and brought it closer to her face. “Treasure Mapping. Specifically designed for children’s treasure hunts.” Harry frowned and Hermione smirked. “No, Harry, it wouldn’t have been useful for Horcruxes, because it was only invented three years ago.”
“Yes!” He threw his head back and groaned. “I don’t understand how she keeps finding the door, there’s nothing wrong with her!” By some miracle, Draco didn’t spill his drink, and he moved to sit more comfortably. “You’re not allowed to laugh.”
“I love it.”
sorry. I didn’t know what that spell did. I should never have done that.”
Draco witnessed the slow realisation dawning on Potter, and he tapped his foot in anticipation. Maybe the pleasant buzz of alcohol was giving him wings.
When Scorpius fell asleep, Draco turned off the lamp and left the room, closing the door behind him and walking to the kitchen on the ground floor. He enjoyed these peaceful moments where he could sit alone in the sunroom facing the ocean with a cup of tea in his hand. While the water boiled, he peeked into the cold cupboard where he stored a wide array of vegetables under a stasis charm, staring a little too long at the cucumbers. Where did Teddy get these ideas? There was only one way to answer this question. With his tea ready, he slipped into his living room and threw a handful of Floo powder into the hearth.
. How ridiculous.)
Draco scrambled into the Weaselette’s office, out of breath.
From the Apparition point behind the Ministry, he found the visitors’ entrance, cringed, and gathered his courage. When he arrived inside, he found that not much had changed since his last visit. The repaired statue was still ugly, both in its appearance and meaning, and was that a giant painting of his own face above the atrium? He was so glad he lived far away. No doubt the Daily Prophet still printed ludicrous articles, alternating between scandals with the potential to ruin his life and sickly-sweet praise. Too bad there was no truth to any of it. The last story they’d gotten right told the world about his resignation from the Aurors but glossed over the horrors he’d witnessed as a trainee.
Salazar briefly left the frame, perhaps so he could go scream somewhere in peace, then came back with his hair slightly ruffled. “No. No, it’s not. What do you know about the Potter family? Both of you.”
Draco had no clue, but wouldn’t admit it out loud. “Yes. Probably.” He stared at the pictures. “Let’s go with that.
Draco spots a grinning Scorpius in the doorframe. “Did you do that?” Scorpius nods. Draco steps away from Harry and kneels, so he’s at eye-level with the child. “Listen, Slinky liked it this time, but it’s better if you don’t use magic on animals. It can hurt them.”
“Draco, you’re amazing. When do you want to do this?”
to fix it and feel whole again. I could hear suggestions in my head, and they sounded like the perfect escape; I was familiar with what you call the Imperius, and it didn’t feel like that. My own mind was talking to me, not another voice, not something I could resist. I do not know how Helga convinced the others, but I woke from what had nearly become a catatonic state to find her with a sword in her hand, covered in blood and staring at the body of our magic thief.
He explained what happened in London and that there were adoption papers being drafted as they spoke.
Scorpius nods.
Draco’s blush darkened. This must have been the boldest move he was capable of, and Harry didn’t want to ruin it by being an idiot, but it felt like now was the best time to make a move.
Grimmauld Place looked nothing like the horror-show it had once been. Years ago, months of tearing down walls and stripping down tapestries had turned it into a home Harry didn’t hate, even if it was still old, temperamental and impersonal. He might’ve cared if he hadn’t been living at Hogwarts for the past decade. If he kept travelling, it’d take him a long time to put any effort into his decorating choices.
“Thank you!” Harry grabbed the Portkey, made sure Noodle was safe, and moved closer to Draco, before being whisked away. The landing didn’t turn his stomach, so that was a plus. Again, they went through the check-in and luggage drop, and Harry knocked on Draco’s door when he was done.
In Harry’s mind, Zabini had always been some kind of Don Juan. Gin had described him in a similar way and had spoken about their surprise when he’d taken care of them during their pregnancy; then the baby was born, and Blaise had taken fatherhood very seriously. The couple had broken up a year later but stayed on good terms—a lifeline for them and their little boy once they’d realised he wasn’t acting like most toddlers. Hermione had been there to help them navigate the Muggle world, as autism was almost unknown to wizardkind. Thanks to her early involvement, she was more than familiar with Matteo. The child could talk about animal facts for hours and had a fascination for painting.
Pansy cackled. “You’re blushing! Does anyone have a camera?”
must have known that because he stood up and led him out. Harry wondered why this house had a basement, but when the door next to the bathroom opened, he forgot every question he wanted to ask.
Harry wrote only a few lines, knowing Draco wouldn’t expect anything else from him. He wasn’t a letter-writing person. Sue him.
When the world stops spinning, Harry recognises the fresh and salty scent of the ocean. Malfoy lets go of him and walks towards the sea, which is so quiet it’s like oil under the moonlight. Harry’s feet sink in the sand. He kicks his shoes off and removes his socks, grimacing at the cold and wet grains on his toes. With the sun gone, it’s obvious it’s not summer yet. Harry joins Malfoy at the edge of the water, where minuscule waves barely reach their naked feet.
“Death Eater attack!” she shrieked, pinned against the wall, and he recognised her as the one who’d asked Harry to impregnate her. She looked as old as Dumbledore, and her shiny pink lipstick was smeared on her chin.
“I’ll let you know,” Harry replies, and he makes his exit before everyone decides they want to give him a hug. Harry never says yes to any plan, in case his brain goes haywire before the event. It’s better if he doesn’t cancel things at the last minute. Ron will go to the match with George no matter what, and it’s the Cannons, it’s not like the tickets are sold out.
With a gasp, Harry places a hand on his heart. “Hey, I’m offended!” He glances outside again. “What’s going on out there?”
He made sure to keep the door open so Scorpius wouldn’t be scared and joined Potter and the Weaselette in the kitchen. He was offered some tea and accepted it gratefully. “Scorp’s room is beautiful. I don’t know how to repay you.”
Malfoy puts the kitten on the cat tree beside him and rubs the knuckle of his index finger on the crow’s breastbone. “This handsome creature only eats owl treats for some reason, and I ran out. Name’s Loki.”
Fear quickly forgotten, Scorpius escapes Draco’s embrace and runs to Harry. Slinky jumps into his arms and Scorpius apologises and promises never to make him fly again. Slinky doesn’t nip at him; he never does. Draco doesn’t want to admit how much he likes the creature, because Slinky was a gift from the Weasel, but Ronald
Her eyelashes are still wet when Hermione speaks again. “You tried to tell me, and I didn’t listen.” Her voice sounds tiny and defeated. “I thought if I pushed you, you’d come to your senses, but I didn’t see—” a shuddering intake of breath interrupts her, followed by a huff, “I didn’t realise what was happening to you. I thought, if it worked for me, and Ron, Ginny, George, Seamus, Dean, everyone we know, surely it’d work for you too. Oh, I was such an idiot!” She sniffles. Her hand is holding his so tight it hurts. “Is M—Draco seeing that?”
A husband who was grieving for his godson, the family of redheads who had more or less adopted him, and the woman Draco had spent years insulting. But it was Harry: for him, seeing Sirius, Remus, Fred, Colin and Tonks alive and well was worth the sacrifice.
“Oh! No way. That looks like a snake.”
Reality blurs, swirls and shrinks, and Harry becomes frantic. He needs to escape, he can’t stay, he—
“No, I’m- well, with a girl, yes. Once. Not all the way. I had offers from men when I came out. I declined them.”
He’d gone through most of his playlist and three chapters when his timer indicated that he should add his sliced gurdyroot to the cauldron. As soon as he did that, the liquid seemed to freeze. The recipe called this step hibernation, an odd result when gurdyroot and moondew were combined in the correct order. The potion would mature over the next few hours without requiring supervision. Satisfied, Draco left to take a shower, keeping the monitoring spell in place just in case. He scrubbed his skin with his favourite soap, then applied lotion on his whole body and another in his hair—potion fumes had terrible consequences on hair follicles and could clog pores. Draco refused to turn into Snape. Not to mention how much Potter despised the smell that clung to Draco when he’d been brewing. It was a persistent scent, quite similar to cigarettes. Only a few products made it disappear completely.
Sheepish, Harry folded his coat and placed it beside him. “I don’t speak it. I understand the context of a conversation if it’s not too complicated. Victoire is very demanding; even Ron speaks it a bit, and he’s terrible at languages. He almost caused an international incident when he was sent to France on that weird Voldemort cult case.”
His Mark was different. The skull seemed to be laughing, and the snake was instead a chain wrapped around his forearm. He wasn’t worthy of the real Dark Mark. He was a slave to the Dark Lord and nothing more.
Oliver Wood, who’d created
. Hermione asked him what they were looking for, and he chose to speak, telling her about the Mind Compass, and feeling much better now that he was no longer hiding it from her. She didn’t admonish him or tell him he was insane, which was a plus.
Chang had created a dozen swans, and Lovegood’s hare had been frozen in various poses. Over the past week, Pansy, Goyle, Zabini, Granger, half of the Weasley clan, all of Harry and Draco’s colleagues, and most of the infamous Dumbledore Army, had chosen to help. Not everyone could; corporeal Patroni were still too rare. But if they couldn’t cast one, they could dig into another talent, and despite the obvious reluctance of some of them, Mother had agreed to show them the neat Transfiguration trick she’d used when Draco was a child. Patronus or Transfigured snow, the result was the same.
Potter’s laughter is wet. “Wasn’t going to leave you all alone.”
Something else is Potter’s fault, and it’s the emptiness of the Slytherin common room. Scarhead’s brilliant idea to unite students was to open every common room to the student body. Passwords are set on the dormitories now. It took a long time before any Slytherin felt welcome in another House, except for the first years. They don’t have
“Yeah, I tend not to listen to you—isn’t that shocking?” Harry stood up and looked at the pipe above them. It was too high to reach in any way, and even if he somehow trusted Malfoy to levitate him, there was nothing to grip; he would just fall again. “There might be another way out. Let’s go.”
Draco and Harry extended their stay in Ethiopia by a few days, taking some time to visit the lush Semien Mountains after the alien sights of Dallol. They even took a peek from afar at a church in Lalibela despite the warnings but quickly Apparated back to the safety of a wizarding settlement before someone spotted them. Draco believed that, ironically, the most religious areas of the country were warded against magicians. He wondered if a magical being had been forced to create them, or if they'd been paid handsomely. He found he'd rather not know.
Harry can only groan at that. Draco looks way too cocky, but that was a terrible pun, and he should be ashamed of himself.
“Tetchy, Potty.” A loud exhale, then Malfoy closed his book and stared at the ceiling. “I don’t know. I’m good at fixing things, figuring out what’s wrong with their magic. Merlin, I repaired that damn cabinet without any training, and I was terrified the whole time, but that moment—when it worked? I wasn’t just happy because I’d succeeded in a mission. I was ecstatic because the Dark Lord always told me I was useless and incapable—but if I could do that on my own? Maybe I wasn’t worthless after all.” Malfoy’s neck was bright red. He coughed and stood up. “I need a bath. These healing salves are sticky.”
With a snort, Harry blinked in disbelief. “They’re long and green? Edible?”
stays open on page 25 until the storm ends.
A little body barrelled into his legs. “Daddy! Daddy! The doggy licked my hands!”
“Well then, please ensure you are not taking risks and visiting a warzone. Even magic is no match against those dreadful Muggle weapons. Don’t be late now, enjoy your evening, and don’t forget to greet your father.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Again, trauma, Potter. Your mental health matters more than a memorial service. Put yourself first, for once.”
He pointed his wand at the floor to warm the tiles, then hopped in search of his thickest pair of socks. The old kettle whistled by the time he’d gone to the bathroom, downed a potion and got dressed, and he sat on a creaking chair by the window with a cup of Earl Grey, feeling like he’d accomplished something. Leaving seemed like a simple decision, but it involved too many variables and risks and was, in fact, more complicated than it appeared. His coworkers would tell him Slytherins liked to overthink—even Pansy sometimes said so. But if Draco didn’t go through every possible scenario on how a situation could turn into a disaster, he would be unprepared, and there was nothing worse than facing the unknown.
“Well, you were wrong. Can we stop talking about this? You caught me being a creep, rejoice!”
Lies would be spotted immediately, because Ginny is perceptive. “I’m getting better.”
“It’s very loud. Lots of beer and drunk people fighting.”
He waters Draco’s garden when Draco forgets, brings him dinner when Draco doesn’t join him after his lessons, feeds Loki on the days Draco stays in bed. He helps him study, even if he doesn’t understand half of what Draco tries to memorise, and he even begins drying his own Dittany so he can make Draco’s cigarettes himself.
“Do you know what that thing is?” Draco added.
Draco played with a loose strand of Harry’s hair, twirling it around his fingertips. “When I was small, we had horses. I’d love to ride around the grounds with you.”
“Can’t breathe,” Harry wheezes through a mouthful of hair.
“Hmm.”
Prompt for this chapter:
“Hear, hear!” Ginny yells from somewhere behind Harry. “I can barely move, if I fly I’ll drop. I look pregnant.”
Draco sneered and sat up. “It’s never as good as a home-cooked meal.” He didn’t care if he sounded a bit whiny.
Harry had absolutely no idea what he was doing, or why Malfoy’s expression at the sight of his wand had been so heart-wrenching, but as he watched Thor and Scorpius cuddle the next morning after breakfast, he couldn’t bring himself to regret his impulsive decision (it was really Ginny’s, but he hadn’t exactly minded).
“Did you send him notes to tell him you wanted to kiss him?”
Harry’s head snaps up to look at him, and he’s very much aware that his mouth is open in shock. He nods, unsure if he’s dreaming, his terror at the idea of going back to Hogwarts shadowed by the prospect of meeting Malfoy. The strength of that feeling is so overwhelming, it nearly breaks him. Hope flares, steady and so much brighter than that tiny flicker he clung to throughout the week. He barely registers his own answer and watches as Malfoy goes back inside with a “I’ll see you then”.
Their unspoken arrangement doesn’t always work that well, because Harry’s mood changes so often, and he still thinks Draco takes care of him too much, that the arrangement is unbalanced. But today is a good day, and the Bolognese sauce smells heavenly, though Harry should have opened the window earlier, the glass is all fogged up. He adds the requested salt.
Harry’s laughter worsened, veering towards hysteria as tears streamed down his face. Draco could feel the telltale signs of his own incoming hilarity in the way his chest spasmed, but he wanted to have the full experience and decided to read on.
Malfoy’s next question brings him back to the present. “Do you have pets yourself?”
The Prat-Who-Lived seemed almost shy. Draco gestured towards the couch. "Take a seat, I'll get us some tea. Are you cold?"
today, and Teddy is obsessed. He places all the toys Harry bought for him in a circle and observes them with an adorable pout. Harry ruffles his purple hair.
“Don’t you understand? I
“I’d heard a few things, but you didn’t help.”
Potter was drinking in everything and who could blame him? He’d been starved for any kind of information, and Slytherin was a goldmine. Draco found himself relaxing, his pain now reduced to a dull, burning sensation that he could mostly ignore. He listened to the Slytherin family history, astonished that no one knew of the link between them and the Potters. Then he saw the interest on Scarhead’s face when both he and Salazar explained how Curse-Breaking was a Peverell and Potter tradition, which meant his family usually dwelt around the Mediterranean coast or the Persian Gulf for work.
“I’ll just—I’ll take some leftovers, okay?”
Harry snorted and thanked the employee. Once outside, he stepped into the alley again and cast a stasis charm on both drinks so they’d stay piping hot and appetising. Then he walked home, leaving the main street to find his way to the poshest area of Islington.
Draco stood up, kissed Harry and buttoned his trousers, then walked up to the dog Animagus and took the locket from him. It felt more malevolent than Little Harry’s scar and much more powerful, but it was no match for an Unspeakable.
. Draco feels the heat under his skin as his fear ebbs away. That’s what being a parent is: losing one’s capacity for rational thought on a daily basis. Now that he thinks about it, he remembers having been told about this when Scorpius was born, and he groans, staring at the letter with a sneer. He doesn’t like being reminded of his failings. That’s why none of the books had anything on the topic. It doesn’t
. Were you mocking me?” He doesn’t wait for an answer, heading towards the kitchen and opening the drawer where Harry keeps a bunch of candles. “Here. Be useful.”
“Why don’t you?”
He gets a sheepish grin in return, which he finds adorable.
He’d also remembered that, as far as he knew (and when it came to Malfoy, he knew a lot), Malfoy hadn’t reacted to her either.
. Harry trusted Draco to handle himself. And that simple fact created an explosion of butterflies in his stomach—and the beginning of a strain between his legs.
And Draco failed more than a few times, but he saw first-hand why Slytherins stuck together, and ultimately, why so many of them joined the Dark Lord: they had nowhere else to go.
Harry is trembling against him.

“Excuse me if I don’t enjoy riding something I can’t control!”
Harry resigns from the Aurors, so he fills his mornings with self-study. He pursues his interest in runes, progressing slowly even with Granger and Draco’s assistance, and Draco is proud of him for standing his ground when the Ministry comes begging. His resignation is a blow to their reputation.
He blinks at Potter. “Poison,” he says, and Potter’s hold on him tightens, his face turns into a mask of fury. “C-cyanide.”
“I used
Harry’s body almost betrayed him at the sight of Malfoy’s blissful expression when he drank his first sip. He shuffled on his seat a little and blamed his isolation for his needs. It had been too long. “He’s very well-behaved. You did a fantastic job raising him.”
“You—? Why? Since when do you talk to her?”
It wasn’t like Draco had adhered to his father’s beliefs entirely. He might have when he was younger, because what child doesn’t wish to impress their parents? What child questions what they’re taught, when all their friends’ parents share the same convictions? He’d been raised believing that Muggles were inferior in every way, but he’d also been told how terrifying they truly were. When he was little, he listened to the stories of religion-driven madness, the torture, the burnings. He’d been told how Blood Traitors and Muggle-lovers would attempt to minimise the tragedy and suffering their kind had endured, and what had Draco discovered at Hogwarts? They had done exactly that.
“I think I’ll travel,” he blurted, averting his gaze when Malfoy glanced at him. “After school.” He chewed on his lower lip. Bill’s stories about Egypt and Charlie’s tales of the dragon reserves in Romania and Peru had always fascinated him. “Do you have plans?”
Startled, Harry groaned in discomfort as his back protested last night’s choice of mattress. He sat up and rubbed his eyes, then slid his hand under his pillow to grab his wand. Outside the tent, rapid footsteps accompanied more expletives, and all Harry could think of, was that it was too early to deal with Draco’s sour mood. A quick spell removed the sand from his sleeping bag and the smears from his glasses, and a silent
He winced when someone knocked at the door. He wouldn’t get any work done if people kept interrupting him, so perhaps Wood would grant him the authorisation to maim his coworkers for the occasion. Lifting his fingers off the typewriter, he fell against the back of the chair and breathed out. “Come in.”
Then he asks about Runes, Draco talks about the beauty of ancient magic, and Potter is fascinated by everything he’s told. His eyes shine, and he smiles at him, smiles at
“Did you burn those? What is it, onions?” There was a bowl with charred remnants of
Harry had called this house his home for months following the Battle of Hogwarts. He’d found understanding, warmth and unconditional love among his favourite clan of gingers, even when they all grieved. At no point had he ever felt out of place, even at the very beginning when Molly noticed Fred’s immobile handle on the family clock. They’d all mourned together, and they’d healed one another. Molly had taught Harry every household spell she knew, Ron had taken up knitting, and by the time Harry chose to leave, some measure of happiness had returned to the Burrow.
“Even Parkinson got annoyed and locked Draco in a closet, remember?”
Draco let out a cackle and headed to his bedroom, adding "Grimmauld Place's cellar takes up the entire basement, Potty." Then he stood in front of his open wardrobe and wished he had the time to take a shower, putting on a thick robe after casting a freshening charm on his body. Somehow being a bit scruffy within his own apartment was a lot more annoying than it had been in the tent.
There wasn’t any physical abuse after that first day. One of the instructors had seen Draco’s bruised face and sent him to the nurse, but Draco hadn’t told them who did it. He wasn’t stupid. There weren’t enough adults around to watch all of them, and the other boys would have plenty of opportunities to leave some less visible bruises if they thought Draco was a tattle-tale. So Draco said nothing, which turned out to be the right move. Sure they called him a posh tosser but as long as he kept his mouth shut it didn’t escalate past that.
Draco still lived with Pansy in her two-bedroom flat in London, and though she spent more and more nights at her boyfriend’s place, she still made time for Draco. They would share work gossip and test out new recipes together and on special nights they would do each other's makeup and read fashion magazines. The urge to drink was still there, Draco wasn’t sure it would ever go away, but the cravings came fewer and farther between.
Draco winced at the volume. “I just needed some personal time. I won the match so what does it matter?”
As good as Krum was on a broom, Draco couldn’t help but notice he lacked the same grace that Harry possessed in the air. Draco smiled as he went in for the catch, giving his broom that one last push he needed before reaching for the golden ball. His shoulder ached in protest but he pushed past the pain.
He was walking through the gardens and trying to come up with a plan when he saw a boy in the year just above him, Asim
“Besides you, you mean.”
As much as Draco had enjoyed playing quidditch before, when he played for the Tornados every game had just felt like work - like an obligation he just had to fill. Especially after Harry had left. But playing with the Falcons was actually fun. Even when they lost, which happened a lot more than it had with the Tornados, Draco still had fun. Of course, Draco preferred winning but he stopped beating himself up over stupid mistakes because his teammates genuinely didn’t care if Draco, or anyone else, messed up. Everyone gave it their all because they were happy to be there. For the first time in his life, Draco didn’t pressure himself to be the best and he had never been happier.
Mr Barker gave Draco a tour of the grounds though there wasn’t much to see. Just the single building and a small side yard where, Mr Barker told him, the kids played football in the warmer months. The first floor housed some administrative offices, the kitchen, dining room, and a small lounge with mismatched furniture and donated toys. A group of boys were gathered around a small TV in the corner. They turned to look at Draco as he passed through but they quickly dismissed him as uninteresting and returned to their program.
Draco adjusted his own rhythm to sync up with Harry. He could feel the tension building up inside of him. He was close. Harry was too if the way he sped up was any indication.
“Well
(See the end of the chapter for
He took a moment to take stock of his situation. The tuition money wouldn’t cover his books, supplies, uniforms, or wand. Perhaps he could make some sort of arrangement with the school, they could loan him what he needed and then he could pay them back after graduation or he could provide some kind of labour after classes, like cleaning or tutoring. Draco was sure that there were other students who couldn’t afford everything so there had to be some sort of system in place. He would write back to the school and find out what it was.
He opened the letter immediately and read it through twice. It was an invitation to tour the Chudley Cannons training facility and an offer to play with them next year.
“Thanks Pansy, for everything.”
They lost.
Saturnalia was approaching if the festive trees and candles around town were any indication. Draco expected to spend another solstice alone, what he didn’t expect was Pansy Parkinson showing up on his doorstep but that is exactly what he got.
The classrooms were located on the second floor and contained no decoration. Just rows of wood and metal desks lined up in front of a chalkboard. Mr Barker informed Draco that they had thirty-six boys ranging from ages six to sixteen, and classes were a mix of instruction and independent study.
Draco met his eyes and nodded. He was more than a bit confused.
Draco sighed, “I’ll talk to him after practice today.”
“You think I’m OCD?”
“Alright, I’ll side-along you then.”
The snitch flew swiftly through the air before dropping sharply. Neither seeker hesitated to follow it, diving straight for the ground. Potter flew with a carefree grace and confidence but as they drew closer to the snitch his body language changed and Draco saw only determination.
“Yeah! It’s super cool, they have spaceships and laser swords and the Jedi can do wandless magic. My dad bought me a bunch of muggle movies for my birthday, but Star Wars is my favourite.”
But sometimes Draco just needed a break, like today, Olivier and Sophie had just started dating and if Draco heard about how beautiful her crystal blue eyes were one more time he would gag. He had retreated to the bathroom to hide until the end of lunch and since the stalls were empty, Draco took the opportunity to admire his reflection in the mirror. He was in the middle of re-applying a spell he used to banish the dark circles under his eyes when someone barged into the room.
“Well maybe that’s what I want,” Draco snapped. The frustration, stress, and anger started to boil over.
“I don’t know Louis, I am really busy with school and well… Maybe if I skip that extra credit report for Arithmancy… That might work. Alright, I’ll do it.”
Simon yanked the package out of Draco’s hands and chucked it towards the trash can. Reflexively Draco reached out to stop it, feelings of indignation and anger pouring out of him along with something else.
Harry let him in without question and they played several rounds of exploding snap. Once it got late, Draco got up to leave.
Draco and Harry collided in an out of breath embrace.
“I don’t even know that it is possible for me to beat him, let alone do it in the next Euros.”
Ballycastle Bats who lost against the Vratsa Vultures in the semi-finals.
“So… how would you feel about a seekers match right now?” Draco raised an eyebrow and Harry laughed.
The other guys laughed. “See, so don’t worry so much about fitting in Draco,” Harison paused so that Draco could correct him on the name if he wanted, he didn’t, “you’re one of us already.”
The matches were tough, some of the hardest games Draco had played but they managed to secure their spot in the final match against Durmstrang. And the worst they could do now was silver.
“Did he tell you how the local Auror’s department found them when they finally managed to take down the wards?” Harry asked, filling in the spot next to Draco.
Draco didn’t say a word and after a moment Birch got up and left.
Draco watched the little girl race off towards the house. “I didn’t know Lucius had children.” Why had he said that? He should have just left.
Once he was sure that the other boys were otherwise occupied, he took out the heavy envelope. He revently ran his fingers across the address,
Draco stood up. “A break? Really? If you don’t have the guts to break up with me properly, I will do it for you. Goodbye Asim, we’re done.”
Draco still spent his evenings studying though he found that he didn’t mind Pansy sticking around while he did it. She wasn’t obsessed with grades the way Draco was, but she would sit with him and paint her nails or read a magazine or braid his hair. And Draco couldn’t help but feel that she was a much better companion than a glass of wine.
As the charity match approached, Draco did his best to keep the house clean and manage his drinking. He limited himself to two drinks a day, and after a while he was able to get it down to one. It stopped the shaking and the headaches, and some nights it was the only way he could fall asleep.
Draco slammed the door shut. Honestly, who did Dubois think he was telling Draco that he needed help. Dubois had left years ago, he had no idea who Draco was nor did he have any right to have any kind of say in the matter.
“Yes. In the air I am completely free. The wind at my back, a world of possibilities before me. It’s the only time when I can just let go and give up control.”
Japrisot?”
Draco didn’t know how to handle the situation so he left. He left Thomas standing there in the hallway crying. He was a terrible person.
“But after graduation?”
Once again Harry Potter is Great Britain's only hope, for this season promises to end in another head to head battle between the world’s two greatest seekers.
“…forget it.”
Draco looked around the table as the other boys’ smiles melted away turning into hardened scowls. Well, that was perfectly fine, as long as they understood one another. Now they could just go away and continue on with their evening as normal, while Draco did his best to adjust to his new surroundings.
Draco’s last year at Beauxbâtons was entirely uneventful. He scored top marks on the
Why couldn’t the doofus get it through that thick head of his? Draco was toxic and Harry was so much better off with him gone.
“I’m not really a sports person.”
Draco lunged for the wand and Harry dodged. Draco tried again with no success. Soon enough he was chasing Harry around the house. They were in a standoff now, Harry tried to make a feint to the right but Draco saw right through it. He grabbed on and brought them both down.
Draco jumped up and immediately tried to turn to see his back. Harry doubled over in laughter.
Asim jumped in surprise before a smile lit up his face. “You’re familiar with
A month into the season, Draco got an interview request from the Daily Prophet. Rita Skeeter was working on a piece on the young quidditch players of Great Britain and Ireland. Draco was promised a starring role. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t pleased.
Draco looked around the room. They appeared to be in a cottage out in the countryside. There were plants drying in the windows, various rock and crystals decorating the shelves, and a cauldron bubbling over an open flame.
“Sébastien Toussaint.”
Draco pushed open the door to Pansy’s room. It was decorated in all white. There was a bookshelf with different knickknacks and a few books, mostly crime novels mixed with a few best-sellers and classics alike. Draco picked out a well-loved copy of Rebecca and went back downstairs to read.
“Yeah.”
Draco pulled back a bit, his arms still partially encircling Harry. “You still think I can do it then? You think I can beat Krum.”
Draco melted under the attention but he managed to stop himself and push Harry away. “If we are going to do this, we are not going to do it on the cold hard floor. I assume you have a bed stashed around here somewhere.”
And Draco would, he knew he would, but he still felt like he didn’t deserve her. She was waiting for an answer now and there was only one that she would find acceptable. “Okay.”
“There you go.” Finwick slapped him on the back and Draco glared. “I am going to find myself some of those little quiche things. Remember it
“There is a memory potion in
Draco stuck out his tongue. “Fine then
“What? It’s the 21st Century. I think it is about time everyone gets over this whole homophobia thing. Personally, I like to give just as good as I get.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “What? Right now?”
The night before, Draco was a bundle of nerves. His hands itched. He wanted a drink, badly. Instead, he wandered the hotel hallways until he found himself in front of Harry’s room.
Draco should have expected it, but he hadn’t. He still didn’t understand why anyone would go to that much trouble to help out their competition.
In the spring of fifth year Draco suddenly found himself with quite a bit of free time. He no longer had a boyfriend and he was months ahead in all his classes even with the additional essays and assignments he was doing for Vanessa and her friends.
He was staring down at the ground, at his foot, with an incredulous look on his face.
Dubois gave Draco a sad smile. “You are an excellent student, Draco, and I know you will continue to thrive no matter who ends up teaching next year--”
“Monsieur, on vous attend.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Stop that. I’m firing you from cleaning duty before you start reorganizing my pantry.”
“And what would you suggest?” Draco commented snidely as he put down the broom.
Days continued to get better. Draco did a lot of reading and started to go on runs. He had gotten pretty out of shape in the last couple of months and it would take a while to get back to where he had been. The cravings never went away. They would strike Draco at the strangest times but Draco found the best way to deal with them was with a good distraction, so Draco kept himself busy. Pansy even convinced him to join a support group.
Harry bit back a snort. “What’s wrong with Muggle wine?”
“You kicked my legs and woke me.” Draco threw the cloth to the floor, where it joined the underwear abandoned a few hours earlier. “It wasn’t a dream, anyway. I had to pull you out.”
, he'd said, because his cousin was in Azkaban and Padfoot was the Heir of his family line.
Malfoy didn’t reply, and they sat together in silence. Harry stared at the ceiling, counting the cobwebs, restlessness slowly settling in. His stomach let out a loud complaint sometime later, so Harry guessed it was past dinner, and closed his eyes for a quick nap. If he could sleep, he wouldn’t be bored to tears.
“The one who needs a potions lab with ingredients that are too sensitive to light?”
The announcers speculated on the team’s future, and tensions started to build up, so Harry and Ron made their exit, Apparating to a wizarding pub in Ilkley. Just as grubby as the Leaky Cauldron but with a more varied drink menu, Colin’s offered privacy thanks to a spell targeting photographers and journalists. No Quick-Quote Quill would work in the vicinity, and the Animagus detection ward took care of Skeeter and her colleagues. The owners, Dennis and Magdalena Creevey, had built their pub to be a sanctuary, where war-heroes could relax in peace. Most people who’d fought for Hogwarts in 1998 owned Portkeys or unique Apparition coordinates that could bring them on the doorstep at any time.
“Shut up.” A sudden image of Draco wearing a wedding garter made his face burn and his cock twitch. “We’re just friends.”
“No!” Harry gasped for breath. “Draco, not that one, the one below!” He dissolved into laughter once more.
Draco’s toes curled on the plush carpet, and he had a sudden realisation: he and Harry had been holding hands this whole time.
“Malfoy, what do you want?”
Scorpius graduates and comes home and helps Draco walk among the fragrant fields of lavender, holding his waist at first, and soon pushing the chair Draco sits in. Draco can see that it pains his baby boy, that he’s faltering so fast when Scorpius still needs him. He’s not even fifty, but he’s so tired. He’s wasting away.
“Come with you where?”
“I’m an apprentice.” Malfoy scratches the back of his head. “If you’re worried, I’ll make a vow—”
The elf appeared with a pop. “Master Harry needs Kreacher?”
want our tiny selves to learn all about Lockhart’s books?”
“We’re in none of those places.”
“Malfoy, get ready to catch something,” he yelled as he sent the object flying above his head.
He hurried back to Potter's side as he uncorked the bottle. Noodle was exploring the kitchen tiles, tongue flicking in and out and wobbling when he found something of interest, and Harry translated his hisses. "He loves it here. The floor is warm."
So, he looked around, keeping his mouth shut. Ginevra didn’t seem to mind.
He’s relieved that Father isn’t in the parlour this time. He has no wish to argue about marrying Astoria, and he refuses to explain, again, why she helped conceive Scorpius, no strings attached, and would do it again in a heartbeat. Carrying a child for another couple is a concept that Father will never understand. Draco doesn’t care about his opinion anymore, but that doesn’t mean he enjoys being ambushed and questioned once a month. Eager to avoid an encounter, he finds his way to the west wing, Mother’s favourite part of the Manor, and smiles as she walks towards him, arms open wide. He accepts a brief hug, comforted by her floral perfume. She’s been wearing the same expensive cologne for as long as he can remember.
He was nearing the end of his rope when he saw it, a glint of gold hovering in the air. Despite his monologuing, Potter saw it too and both seekers were speeding across the pitch.
Skeeter came to the Tutshill training grounds to conduct the interview and they met in one of the conference rooms on site. She unpacked her quicknotes quill and they began.
. Draco took another drink. Worst of all had been that smug look on Potters face when he saw the realization dawn on Draco.
She gave the sick boy a potion to settle his stomach and handed out schedules and a map of the campus to everyone. As first-years they were registered for Charms, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Wizarding Literature, Potions, Alchemy, Defense, and Wizarding Etiquette. They pretty much had the entire day to settle in, with the welcome feast not taking place until seven. Lunch would be available in the dining chamber from twelve to two for anyone that was hungry.
why you’ve been in a mood,” Draco exclaimed as he followed Harry down the hall. “I didn’t take you to be the jealous type, Potter. Though I can’t really argue with these results.”
“So, Ms Parkinson tells me you are detoxing from alcohol and amphetamines. Is that right?”
“Tasty too,” Simon continued. “Doesn’t look as if you got enough to share though, and isn’t that a shame. It just wouldn’t be fair for you to go enjoy that delicious cake all by yourself when the rest of us don’t get any pudding at all.”
Draco and Asim hung out regularly after that. They talked about books, school, food. Asim didn’t ask about Draco’s childhood or family once he realized they were a bit of a sore subject but was happy to regale Draco stories of his siblings - two younger brothers, twins, and a little sister. Asim’s family was muggle and his brothers hadn’t demonstrated any ability for magic, though they were still waiting to see if his sister was so inclined.
“This changes nothing you know. I still plan on kicking your ass this season. That cup is as good as mine,” Draco mumbled into his pillow.
Draco took out his wand and cleaned them both up.
“I don’t mean to offend, mind you. The last owner, Mr Moore always had a soft spot for the players no one else seemed to want. Justin over here was ranked as one of the top ten chasers for over a decade but the moment he turned thirty-four no one wanted him, never mind the fact that he still had some good years left in him.” He looked over at Justin teasingly. “We’ll see if he’s got another one left in him this year.”
Asim pressed a kiss to Draco’s lips.
Fuck his head hurt. Everything hurt.
“I’ve arranged for you to attend a muggle boarding school in Lyon starting in the new year, l'Internat Adolphe Favre.”
Draco shot him a glare. “Krum can fly circles around me.”
“Can you play? Can he play?” The second questioned was directed at the medi-witch.
He thought about writing to Pansy, but he figured she was probably busy with her own life and didn’t want to be bothered by him. Especially when he was like this.
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Potter led Puddlemere United to victory on the pitch. Anyone who has seen Potter play knows that he is more comfortable on a broom than he is on the ground, and since his debut he has rocked the quidditch world with his out of the box thinking and ingenious plays.
Several minutes passed in this manner, but Draco was patient and singular in his focus. The score was 50-70, with Durmstrang in the lead, when he saw the other seeker take a dive. It could have been a faint but it wasn’t, Draco could tell. He shot off after the other wizard.
Dubois liked to ask Draco about his “friends”, and Draco soon realized that the professor was worried about him fitting in. He made an effort to play up his connections with the other boys and conceal how lonely he really felt. He wanted Professor Dubois to be happy, even if that meant lying to him. But in order to keep up the façade, Draco couldn’t spend as much time with the professor as he wanted. He cut down on office hours and tried not to linger too long in the conservatory after his work-study.
The summer of 1994 was Draco’s loneliest one yet. There were a couple students that stayed behind who included Draco in their group, but whenever he was with them he couldn’t help but feel like he was putting on a performance. These people weren’t his friends. They didn’t care about him, nor did he care about them.
Draco awoke before the sun. In truth he had hardly slept at all, excitement buzzed through his body. The day was finally here, he was going to Beauxbâtons. The night before Draco had packed all his things and set out his clothes for the day, so he was downstairs and dressed within minutes.
They were still only friends, though Draco found himself hoping more and more that they could be something more.
Draco knew that he would have to talk to Harry eventually but at the very least it would have to wait until the end of practice. What was Harry even doing here anyway? Assistant Coach? Did that mean he had decided to give up playing professionally for good? Draco knew Puddlemere would take him back in a second if he asked. It didn’t matter if Harry hadn’t touched a snitch in a year or two or even five. Any team would happily take him. So what was he doing coaching a team that had ranked last in the league for the past three years? Draco couldn’t deny that Harry was an excellent teacher but was this really what he wanted?
They worked like that for a bit longer, Draco would ask Harry for directions and Harry would give a curt response.
Parker, was the team’s keeper, and she was the quiet one in the group. She was probably also the strangest of the bunch which only endeared her in Draco’s mind. She had lost her mom at an early age like Draco had, and though she had been raised by her father Draco was able to find many similarities between them. He was closest to April though, and the moment he had introduced her to Pansy he had regretted it. The two of them had hit it off and often gained up on him, which was just unfair.
“Where have you been?” One of his teammates asked once he got downstairs.
, have we been having the same conversation? If you were truly worried about me you would be around more.”
Harry pushed Draco down onto the bed. He had half expected cheap, scratchy sheets but was pleasantly surprised to find himself atop high-quality Egyptian cotton. He pulled his shirt up over his head and pushed it to the side.
“I got fired.”
and won the Continental Cup for the second year in a row.
The rest of his team went crazy. As soon as Draco landed he was tackled by no less than five practical strangers, screaming and chanting.
Draco blushed harder and took another drink.
“I don’t have a choice.” The wind blew Malfoy’s hair away from his face. “I refuse to impose on Aunt Andromeda again.”
“Kreacher knows Master Malfoy’s tastes, yes he does, did Master Harry doubt Kreacher?”
It startles Draco, who was probably expecting a few questions about what led him to cower in the corner. It’s bloody weird, how their roles are suddenly reversed.
,” Draco advised, not that Harry would. The thought of the entirety of wizarding Britain trampling on the grounds amused and horrified him in equal measure. “No need to trigger the panic wards.”
Alright, that was stupid of him. He stared up at Malfoy, whose white-blond hair formed a halo around his head with the sun shining behind him. His attraction for him worsened, and he pushed it aside to make sure he wasn’t walking into a trap. Salazar’s portrait had taught him enough to protect himself, and his career at Hogwarts helped him daily. Designing and teaching a brand-new curriculum destined to do more than bring students through exams? A breath of fresh air. Harry’s students were already competent in Defence by the time they reached their O.W.L.s. His lesson plans included bits and pieces from Auror training material; detecting danger was now second-nature to him. It played a significant role for his third-year students, so if he got taken out by a trap because he was too busy flirting with Malfoy, he’d deserve the humiliation.
The pebbles under Malfoy’s feet emit a crunching sound as the man stands up. “All right. Do you want to meet me in Hogsmeade after your speech?”

on himself would be a good idea right now, but Harry doesn’t even need to, because Loki flies towards his owner and drips water all over Harry’s head in the process. “Er, hi. Been here long?” Harry asks. He wants to take that camera and immortalise Draco’s beauty immediately.
Harry pokes him in the ribs, and Draco pats his hand away, before following Lisa to the house.
“Kreacher failed!” The elf popped away.
“Noo! I need to say goodbye!” Scorpius hands him the backpack and jumps up and down, eyes glittering.
Prompt for this chapter:
He searched his friends’ faces and waited for an explanation, knowing it would be juicy. He fully assumed his taste for gossip involving people he couldn’t stand. It was Goyle who spoke first:
“I am not keen on traipsing through the unknown with the Golden Boy, so if you’ll excuse me, I’ll wait here.”
“I’m sorry, Padfoot,” Harry said with a wide grin. “I thought you were still visiting the Manor’s bathroom. You know, the one with the massaging bathtub.”
“Whatever this is, don’t touch it.” Malfoy’s voice carried through the tunnel.
, which he succeeds in casting after a few days. His accidental magic stops, just as Draco hoped.
A gust of wind made Harry shudder as he opened the door. “Heya, Malfoy! Come in.” He stepped aside.
"Potter, your tea will be cold by the time we come back." He drank his cup as if to make a point. "Savour it."
Did he hear that correctly? Is that why Harry is so comfortable with him? Did his brain notice something Harry has been oblivious to?
“With skills like that it doesn’t matter. I could totally teach you the rules, the game isn’t that complicated really, and it would just be for one match - two if we win.”
, Draco thought, but he bit his tongue. He may not want to be friends with these muggles, but he didn’t need to be making any enemies either. He turned to face the boy who had spoken, the one that was clearly their leader.
His teammates worked hard and point-by-point they reduced Russia’s lead. Draco switched back and forth between hunting for the snitch and supporting the offence as the score fluctuated. Then Krum went into a nosedive.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but the beater spoke again before he could get it out.
“I felt like he was toying with me the whole time. Four hours in and he was still flying like we’d only been at it for a few minutes. And I thought I had endurance.”
His teammates tried to owl him but he just rejected them all.
“Alright then, if you’re sure.” Mr Barker opened the door and walked Draco to the gate. “You’re a good kid Draco, and I wish you well at your new school.”
“What? Was I supposed to send you an owl?” Draco bit sarcastically.
“That was amazing!” The boy yelled once he got close enough then immediately bent over to catch his breath. He was a year or two older; Draco wasn’t sure of his name though he remembered seeing him around.
“You smell just like he did, your eyes are just like his eyes, and your skin-- I saw the empty bottles in the trash outside. That’s a lot of alcohol.”
Draco took it. “Thank you. You never made it easy. I look forward to our next match.”
“Oh! I didn’t think anyone would be here yet.”
Dinner was a quiet affair, and afterwards Draco cleaned up while Pansy did some work. That night Draco tossed and turned but he couldn’t fall asleep. His entire body felt like it was on pins and needles. His jaw ached from clenching it all day. And his head was killing him.
As they walked through the woods looking for the magical mushroom, the other boys paired off and Draco found himself to be the odd man out once again. While he scanned the forest floor for the tell-tale red cap, he could hear the other boys talking and laughing in the distance.
Potter left Draco feeling baffled and slightly disappointed.
Draco arrived at the party fashionably late and immediately located some familiar faces. As he made his way over to the other third-year boys, he noticed they were passing around a bottle of cheap wine between themselves.
had an invite.
Potter actually had the gall to use his first name. Something must have slipped past Draco’s mask, because Potter quickly corrected his mistake.
Harry had not taken his eyes off of Draco since he had walked out onto the pitch. Those bright green eyes were just… staring at him. Draco wanted to run and hide but he was frozen in place. A swift slap on the back jolted Draco out of his stupor and he realized everyone was giving him and Harry a polite applause.
“Yeah, but I don’t go to school here, my mom is a professor and I get to spend summers with her. I live in Nantes with my dad.”
“There is a better spell for that, you know.”
“They will know. When you beat Krum, they’ll know.”
Draco smiled. “Come in Professor, I want to hear all about Serbia.”
“It’s just like flying, you never really forget.”
“You arsehole! My abs hurt so much, I think I might die,” he said once he had finally regained control.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.”
He eyed Draco suspiciously but Murphy, one of the chasers, interrupted. “It’s fine. Let’s go or we’ll all be late.” They took hold of the portkey and travelled straight to the arena.
“Dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. I just put the chicken in the oven.”
A series of emotions flickered across Narcissa’s normally stoic face. Shock, confusion, disbelief. “You want us to leave the manor? And go where?”
The moment was bitter-sweet for Draco because it was his last game. Next year, Max Crevier, the team’s usual seeker, would be healed enough to take back his spot. Pansy said he was moping but Draco preferred to think of it as succumbing to ennui.
“Is it Potter?”
He left the pitch and flew as fast as he could across the grounds. The chilly air pierced through his robes but Draco didn’t want to stop long enough to cast a warming charm. The feeling of euphoria and clarity was almost better than the one the pills gave him.
“The booze, the pills, it has to stop.”
Dubois set down his teacup. “Actually Draco, there is something I wanted to talk to you about.”
“No. This isn’t on you. You don’t owe me anything. And I wouldn’t have listened to you if you
Harry came with him to Japan not as his coach but as his friend. Still, that didn’t stop him from giving Draco pointers after every game. They would get dinner together and talk about each match or if Draco went out with the team, Harry would stop by his hotel room afterwards and they would talk late into the night.
The 2002 World Cup took place in Japan during the month of June. Draco was beyond nervous to be playing with a lot of the same teammates that he had let down during the Euros, but most of them seemed willing to leave the incident in the past. Draco was sober now and knew he wouldn’t be getting any more chances if he fucked this one up.
Draco, who had been doing his best to ignore Potter and focus on the game, couldn't help but turn his head at that. “What?! Of course not.”
Harry shook his head and started to reach out but seemed to think better of it and pulled his arm back.
By the time the weather started to warm, Draco had begun contemplating his next steps. He couldn’t live with Pansy forever but he also couldn’t afford his own place at the moment. He figured it was past time to talk to Pansy about it, so he took her out to a nice meal and broached the topic.
“I know. I’m not saying I’ll never come back. I just want to take some time to explore other options.”
Draco knew immediately that he wanted to see Professor Dubois. It had been years and he wanted to hear all about Dubois trip and his book and-- Draco looked around the small house. Empty bottles littered the floor, dishes were piled up in the sink, and the whole place smelled like a bar. Draco, himself, wasn’t much better.
Draco’s father continued to give him meaningless details, but Draco tuned him out and waited for his dismissal.
Harry smiled back Draco found his own smile growing. Shit, was it really that easy? It was. Things with Harry always were.
Potter nodded and slid Draco’s second glass out of reach.
He had arranged to participate in Beauxbâtons’ work-study program which allotted him the necessary uniforms, books, and a standard wand. It would hardly be the best that money could buy but it was better than nothing. Besides, Draco was confident that if anyone could make poor look chic it was him. Just not in muggle clothes.
Draco tried to concentrate on the book but found that he just couldn’t focus. He felt restless and exhausted and he just wanted a drink. He knew Pansy wouldn’t have any alcohol in the flat but he could always go out and find some himself. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Motherfucker. Draco got up and paced around the flat.
