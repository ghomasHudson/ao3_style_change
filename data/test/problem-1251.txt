"A true Slytherin if I ever saw one" said Lucius to Sirius as they got onto the Drop Tower and were soon strapped in for safety.
Severus and Harry was gift with two house elves by the names of Boris and Mink, they were to be their privet elves only to serve them when they needed and would only obey them. Boris to Severus and Mink to Harry.
Both knew it was Severus shouting as at the next minute they saw the man in question, his face was as black as his robes.
"We Otiz are going to get you and Hadrian some more toys and clothes".
"Albus I ask you to stop this right now or so help me I will leave this office with my son and go and talk with the Minister right now and have them send over all the paperwork regarding this matter" he sneered.
Albus was furious at those blasted twins! Everything now was ruined! How could they do something like this! Yes he was paying their younger siblings and the know it all girl, for some reason he wasn't able to bribe the other Weasely's. Damn it all to seven pits of Hell!
~........~
"Ups!" screamed Otiz to the group, making people look at the group and the small boy who by now had tears in his eyes.
As the night drew in Molly had some thinking to do on Ron and Ginny and how she was going to deal with the whole thing.
"Mr. Cruise I would like to know why you think it's a good idea to pick on a fellow student and one that was once apart of your own house" said Severus to the boy.
"Hadrian I think we should go out, hopefully that will curb his hyperactiveness somewhat" said Severus having given Otiz his sippy cup of blood and Harry his pancakes.
So please Draco get over this pettiness of yours because he didn't take your hand of friendship before you both started school, he's a wonderful kid if you took the chance to get to know the poor boy, the same with him" finished Severus and then looked at the child now completely fast asleep on him, light snoring into his father's chest.
"...leave..."
Severus was one pissed of man, he was more than snarky with anyone within a five mile radius, he was giving out detention for stupid little things like not wearing your tie properly or scuffed shoes and all because of one man....
Percy got up and looked at his much younger siblings in disgust and after what seemed like hours but was only minutes he finally spoke to them, making sure that everyone in the Great Hall could hear him.
Lucius Malfoy and Tom Riddle were sitting in Malfoy Manor, the Sunday after Tom had taken his place as the New Headmaster of Hogwarts, they were going through the plan of how they were going to get Albus Dumbledore out of Hogwarts for good as well as his positions within the Ministry:
"Well that was enlighten, thank you for the information... Otiz is it?"
Filius was watching with fascination as they argued.
Older Sister- Jessica Willow Anderson, 15 years old, black hair and light blue eyes. She is Ron's new older sister and twin sister of Rebecca. Sporty and out going but loves to bully Ron/Max. She thinks he is crazy and doesn't waste a moment to rub it in, hair in braid that goes over her right shoulder. AKA Jess
He would never get a his education, a job or anything in the Wizarding World he was now and for ever more be a Squib... his magic was now locked and he would never be allowed to use it ever again.
"Every well I would like to know what has happened to you young Mister Snape and why in Merlin's name you have got resorted in the first place, Professor Dumbledore said that you left your relatives for unknown reasons but is that true?" she asked him making Otiz's hackles climb he DID NOT like where this was going.
"Thank you Mister Flint, that will be all until next year. Enjoy your summer" Severus and so Marcus left for the summer.
This made everyone who was in the hall come over to see what was going on and when they all saw that Harry was being bullied by his own house, ex house at that, they knew something was going on.
"Mr. Malfoy, I think it would be best to wake up young Mr. Snape and take him to his bed for the night, he has permission to head to Hogsmeade tomorrow and for the foreseeable future so if you all want to go I would head to bed now" and he smiled a very slight smile and the group packed up their homework and headed to their dorms while Draco went about waking up Harry.
Hair: Blue, short
"Tev sweepy now" said Otiz rubbing his eyes and asking to be picked up by him.
He placed Harry next to Draco who nodded as he walked to the staff table.
"To be honest I don't even know why we are here everything seems to be in complete order, I would like to pass round the file to the court so then that can see" and she held a file which was labeled with both Harry's birth name as well as his adopted name and the court case number.
Tracking keyed to Albus Dumbledore
An insight to what Severus has found out about Harry
"I went to school with them and your father James kept my secret about my furry little problem, I will tell you more about that later if you let me that is".
His uncle started to throw abuse at him making a right scene, then his aunt did and his cousin tied to pull him away from me which broke him more.
"It has come to the courts attention that one Albus Dumbledore has state claim over one Harry James Potter as his magical guardian but due to the paperwork given to said court, the person no longer exists!"
"Who's the phoenix?" asked Tom as he sat down on the bed to pet said bird.
Sorry that their wasn't much for the holiday it was a kind of spur of the moment thing really. Pictures of the holidays will be up next.
Ron layed his head against the window of the car and sighed, this place was so different then he was used to, his missed his mum, dad, his older brothers yes Percy was arrogant but he still loves him, the twins were another story really but he knew they cared for him wholeheartedly, Ginny he was meant to protect as her older brother that was his job! Just like the rest of them!
"I will leave her like that for a bit longer, come on now its time for dinner" said Percy as he got up from his seat and headed to the common room door leading everyone else out while Hermione carried on venting to no one.
Severus did as he was told and once the blood of both of them was in the goblet Griphook started chanting making the goblet glow, he then handed it over to Harry so then he could drink it.
Severus finally arrived at Dumbledore's office, he whispered the password "Lemon Drop" before stepping into the office. "Headmaster" Severus started "we need to discuss some things right now!" he snapped. "My dear boy, what can I do for you?" Dumbledore asked as he stared at the Daily Prophet before him. Severus only glared before continuing "are you aware of what is happening in Potter's home?" Severus asked, trying to be civil. "Severus, what is wrong? is Harry alright?" Dumbledore finally looked up with concern lacing his every word. Severus could only close his eyes and remember how his father used to beat him. He quickly snapped out of it only to stare into blue depths of Albus Dumbledore's eyes.
Remus hugged Sirius tightly around his neck hoping he would change back but he didn't until he buried his face in Sirius' fur.
"I want to know why Harry is now in Slytherin away from his house, his friends!" sneered Jacob to Severus but he just sighed and said in a low voice "Hadrian was resorted into a different house due to his father wanting him to".
"Very well Minister I will be there, I think either Minerva or Severus would be ok to help out for the day, I can get in some substitutes depending on who is willing to take this task" said Tom after reading the letter over again.
"Poor Potter scared? Jumping like that is not how a Gryffindor is meant to act!! You're acting like some Hufflepuff not a Gryffindor at all" laughed one of the females to him.
She took him by the hand and brought him to a quiet classroom where they worked on his school work as well as some breathing exercises and talked about how he had been feeling as well ect..
Harry had never seen that colour before what could it mean?! He wanted to know but at the same time he didn't.
Amelia look towards Albus who was starting to sweat he did not want this he, wanted the brat to go back to the Dursley's that's all that matters to him and so he looked to his attorney who was now sweating and starting to hyperventilate he knew he wouldn't win this case he knew new he would lose his twins due to watch Albus done.
The last thing he remembered that he was eating in the Great Hall with his friends when the new Headmaster was introducing himself and then everything went black.
'Ah Mister Potter or should I now called you Snape?'
Minerva sat back in her chair and sighed this was going to be a long rest of the year, who knew her lion's could be so vicious!
"Son it's due to the blood adoption, you have my blood in you as well as James and Lily, more so me then them if I had to guess really. You won't need your glasses anymore and I have to say you hair is now sitting quite nicely" and he chuckled again at his son's expression.
“You were attacked, you lost consciousness on the way here.” His voice was more flat now, just the thought of what had happened too much to stomach.
“Does it hurt?” he couldn’t help himself but ask.
“I really want this to work." He cuddled closer to him, and Harry felt his heart missing a couple of beats.
“You are all going crazy. I’m going to go and get a bit of fresh air.” He got up and left, while almost everyone looked at him knowingly. What the actual fuck. Him and Malfoy? Where did that even come from? He opened the door and immediately smelled cigarette. He looked around and found Malfoy leaning against a tree, with a cigarette between his fingers. “You smoke,” he said, and it wasn’t a question, he was mostly surprised.
“Why?”
“Why do you sound scared?” He moved a little to be able to look him in the eyes.
Harry just laughed at that, endeared by his boy. He sank more into him, enjoying Draco’s warmth and strong grip around his waist.
“Of course. You’ve been by my side most of my life, I know you, and I know you can do this.”
When they got there no one was around, and they sneaked inside the first greenhouse they found.
“It’s really not a problem. There it is.” He found the pyjamas and he turned around to give it to Draco. “You have nothing to be embarrassed about, you know that, right?”
“Very smart, Potter.”
“Okay, fair enough. We’ll figure something out.”
“And where does he live?” his mother asked, recovering fairly well from news.
“Of course.” He turned around quickly, but Malfoy was already disappearing down the stairs to the dungeons.
“He should be dead. I heard my parents talk about him,” Draco said, turning his hand so that their fingers could intertwine.
“I really love you.” He left a kiss on his head. “I’m going to shower.”
“Potter, I like being manhandled but what is this?” he asked, struggling to keep up with him.
As it turned out, Hagrid had been able to identify a lot of names. Draco had written down as many as he could, with a brief description next to the creatures Hagrid had recognised, a question mark next to unfamiliar names, and he had started to write down other names as well before Harry had interrupted them.
“Yes, I will explain later, now let’s go say hi.” He gestured for Malfoy to follow them, and went into the kitchen to say hi to the rest of the family. No one seemed really bothered by Malfoy. Sure, they weren’t jumping around trying to get his attention, but they were all polite and nice to him.
“You and Malfoy?” he said, still incredulous.
“Can I ask you something?”
“Could you two be any cuter.” He pinched his cheek again.
Everyone seemed pretty relaxed, yet very curious. He remembered what it felt like being a student, how scary and intimidating it was, how many times he was made to feel stupid, mainly by Snape, but these students seemed happy to be there. He wouldn’t have minded having a teacher who looked like Draco, that he was sure of.
“I didn't know if you wanted to be woken up or not.”
“Draco it is. You can call me Molly.”
“I’m sorry, I’m being very invasive.” He just wanted to know if he had a chance, sue him. The fact that Malfoy was having a breakdown because people were hinting at them being together was telling enough, but he was nothing if not resilient.
“Perfect,” said Harry, “for tonight we just want you to disarm your opponent. Second years, you should already know the spell. Someone wants to tell the first years?” Honestly, he was surprised the first years could even hold their wands right considering the year had just started.
“A literal child, I’m dating a child,” he muttered, while one of his feet moved to caress his ankle.
“My room?” Draco asked in a whisper.
“We need to do this more often,” Draco said, clearly thinking the same thing.
“If you say so.” He finally lifted his head to look him in the eyes. “You look amazing, have I told you already?”
want?”
“I should’ve paired you two together a long time ago,” McGonagall sighed as they were exiting the door.
“I'm fine, I just need a good night of sleep,” Draco said, ignoring Harry’s death stare. Had it been for him, he would have put him in bed rest for a week.
“They are so cute.” He saw a kitten staring at him, and he picked him up immediately. “Look at it, don’t you want to kiss him all over?” The cat was so small he could hold it in one hand, its fur was quite long and fluffy, all white with the point of his ears and his paws black, his lively eyes a beautiful blue.
“Me neither. We should go on a flying date, what do you say? Pick up our broomsticks again, race each other like the good old times.”
“Well I didn’t, glad you had faith in me," he whispered, holding him closer.
“You look good." She smiled at him, and finally stepped away to look at Harry. “Mr Potter, it's a pleasure to have you here with us tonight.” She held out her hand, which Harry shook immediately.
“You are really optimistic about us.”
“No problem.” She smiled knowingly at him, then lowered he gaze on her cup of tea. “So, I was wondering. Would you be interested in coming here once a week and teach the Duelling club with Draco? You two work really well together, and the students listen to you. Besides, I think you deserve to come and see your cat more often than once a week."
“Okay, good.”
“That’s what we are trying to find out.”
“I’m gonna ask McGonagall if we can use the pensive tomorrow, I’ll let you know in the morning,” Malfoy told him as soon as they stepped inside the castle.
“Great, thank you.”
“I, uh, I got you something.” He picked up a nicely wrapped up box and offered it to Draco.
“Today we are going to practice with the Avifors spell again, alright? And if you manage that you can go ahead and try the counter spell. If you need me to show you again how it's done you can ask, but I’d really like to see you try first.”
That seemed to pique his interest. He moved just enough to be able to look at him, and he finally smiled at him, sleepy and adorable as always. “Hi,” he whispered. He brushed his nose against his jawline and turned on the other side.
“All good?” Malfoy asked, now sounding concerned.
“I wanted to, I just wasn't sure I would have been able to face all of this. We lost too many friends inside these walls, there are wounds that won't ever properly heal, some that I don’t want to heal because it would mean that I forgot.”
“You will not go alone. Do it and I’ll fucking hex you into next year.” Harry really wanted to kiss him and just hold him close, to reassure him that it was going to be fine, that he was trained, but he refrained from doing so in front of his friends.
“It was about time, mate. Where are you going?”
He approached them as carefully as possible, trying to not look like a creep. “I’m sorry to bother you, can I ask where you found those necklaces? It looks like something my girlfriend would love," he said casually.
“Glad to hear that since I’ll have to work with him. Hope we won't be at each other's throat too much," he said, scared of what could happen once they were alone.
“Fucking hell,” he muttered, not so discreetly fixing his pants. “I’m not sure it’s a good idea for the official introduction, but I’m tempted.”
“Yes. The third year I found Peter Pettigrew, that's how Lupin found out he wasn’t dead.”
McGonagall had insisted to go with them, so now they were in seven. Draco was shaking next to him, and he looked pale, but every time Harry looked at him, he just nodded and straightened his back.
“I’m sorry,” he said, going back to rest on him.
“Oh, am I distracting?” he asked, teasing him.
“In the forest. We were thinking about putting together our memories to form a complete map,” Hermione said immediately. Harry knew she didn’t like lying to Ron, but he was very grateful she had done it just this time.
“Why would I know that and why do
“I just wanna help.”
“We won't see each other often when I’m done with this case, I was wondering if you’d consider sleeping at my house every once in a while? ‘Cause I know I probably won’t be allowed inside anymore once I’m done, but I’d really like to spend time with you.”
“Why does it bother you so much?” he pressed, getting up and putting both hands on his shoulders to stop him. “You said you are out to your parents and friends, right?
“Ops.” He just smiled innocently at him and brought his feet closer to his to touch him. “I was thinking, since we are having dinner with your friends, do you want to meet mine?”
“You are neither of those things. You are strong and amazing, and I really wish you could see yourself as I see you.”
“I mean, uh, date? For now? Like momentarily, until we make things official. If you want to, of course.”
Harry kept looking, but he couldn't make out anything. He didn’t feel anything, no chills, no adrenaline kicking in. He was almost one hundred percent sure there was nothing in that moment, and yet Malfoy was scared.
“About?” Draco stopped and leaned against a tree. He tugged him closer and put his hand on his hips, under his open coat.
“It keeps the kids safe from anyone who tries to enter the castle.”
“You are being careful and professional,” Hermione said, trying to be reasonable.
“Sap.”
“Guess who’s on a date with me.” He winked at him and started eating again before it got cold.
“So are you.”
“Thank you.”
“You must have spent a lot on this. And dinner tonight.”
He opened it quickly, putting the bow on Theo's head, and he just stared at his gift for what felt like hours.
I never fought back, I helped and watched as he tortured people.”
“You know each other, it would be easier for you two to practice together to show the students. And you know all of them, you can help Harry and give him information about each of them.”
“We are.” He smiled at him, big and open.
Harry smiled at him and started walking again, slowly, to allow Malfoy to catch up. “What do you say?” he asked, even more quietly.
“Do you think we could stop in Diagon Alley? I need some things for work.”
He tried to take another step forward, but that only served to piss him off. He pushed harder against Draco's throat, leaving him breathless.
“At all," Harry agreed. “See, we even agree now.”
“No, you don’t, we have a kid together.” He picked up Theodore, hugging him close to his chest. Seriously, had people even tried to pet him?
“That’s why story repeats itself, though. People need to know, they need to know what happens when they trust someone like him, don't you think?”
“Yeah. Never really went all in. I was too young with Blaise and the people who came after were just flings and I didn’t trust them. But you are my boyfriend now, and I trust you.”
“Can I try something for that as well?”
He reached out and put his hand over his, preventing him from hurting himself. “Okay, well that’s a little clue.”
“Fuck, this is so weird.” He hugged him, ignoring his father looking at them with a scared expression. He might have heard the word ‘married'. “I’m so happy.”
“It doesn't show animals, but Hagrid says this is different. I think it is possible to maybe latch onto intentions, free will and all that.”
“Hey, no, it's not.” He wrapped his arms around him after making sure they were alone. “I get it. I just want to see you happy, and these animals make you happy. You can come here to visit mine whenever you want, okay? Maybe if you get used to a specific owl instead of taking turns with multiple ones, you’ll start feeling like you can get one that’s just yours.”
Harry opened it quickly, and he stated laughing, almost hysterical, when he saw what it was: a key, to Draco’s apartment, with a tiny owl as the key chain. The owl wasn’t all silver like Draco’s key chain, but it had been personalised to look like Hedwig. He knew that, because he had spent ten minutes looking at it in the shop, and it had looked nothing like the one in his hands.
“Actually, yes.” He blushed a bit at that. “Do you want to get coffee?”
“I’m not exactly on first name basis with any of them, am I? And I’m pretty sure calling everyone Weasley would be a bit counterproductive.”
“I know. Kinda scary if I have to be honest.”
“We are really doing this.”
He took advantage of that and got closer to Draco to hold his hand. He was still very pale, but his breathing and his pulse were back to normal and his face seemed peaceful, not screwed up in pain like it had been before. The marks on his neck were also disappearing quickly, which Harry hoped was a good sign.
“Again?” he asked, confused. When had he ever rejected Malfoy? The only thing he could think of was-
“It's actually pretty selfish if you think about it. I just really need you and I want you to be safe.”
“Better me than you.”
“I will.” He smiled at him and then leaned in. “How are things going with Malfoy?”
“There are spells for that if you ever wanna try.” He put his hand on his cheek, forcing him to lift his head from their shoes. “Whatever you want, we can try it, and if you are not comfortable with something you can tell me.”
“Fine. But come back here, I need cuddles and I’m cold. Your bloody dungeons just had to be so cold and humid.”
“That’s... impressive,” Malfoy said, standing way too close to him to examine the map. “Does it really show everyone?”
As expected Robards wasn’t happy with his decision. He had been screaming at Harry for ten minutes when he decided that enough was enough.
They went back to cooking in comfortable silence, the noises of the kitchen and of food cooking their only background. It was nice, really nice, and so new to Harry. When he was still with Ginny, they both preferred to be alone in the kitchen, because they got on each other’s nerves by pointing out things they would have done differently, but Draco had no idea what he was doing. He followed his instructions, and asked for help when needed, and that was it. He was also nice to have around, with his soft humming and gentle hands on his hips when he passed by him to get something. He felt truly at peace in that moment.
“Yeah, me too.” He was still looking at Harry, who was beaming at their cat. “Let’s go.”
“You know, I think we'll have fun.” Harry turned around and saw him smirking.
“Okay I hate to use my famous card, but people listen to me, they trust me, and I trust you. If you tell them what’s going on here, and you show them how deeply you care and that people can change, maybe some of them will go home and tell their kids that not all Slytherins are bad.”
“Can we put them up?” he asked, pulling away and wiping under his eyes.
“Aww, Potter, I was hoping for your signature spell.”
“Losing you. That’s the place where you died, and now someone who worked with
“Okay, fine. I hate you.” Draco finally sat up, looking so cuddly Harry was having a hard time sticking to his plan for the day.
“Sure, feel free to go wherever you need.”
“You do.”
“I can't believe it's really happening,” Draco said, and his smile was so big Harry was mentally comparing him to the brightest things he had seen in his life.
“You don’t have to stay here," he told Malfoy when he noticed him twitching at his side.
“What if they don’t approve? I can’t imagine they like me much more than I like them.”
“I think I’ll pass.”
“So anyway, they told us it's our job and not to worry.”
At that Harry felt his heart drop. That was the part he hated most about pet shops, the fact that he knew not all of them were going to get their happy ending.
“There is nothing between us, you know that, right?”
“Aren't you straight?”
“I know. Shit.” He laughed, incredulous. “Malfoy, I fell for Malfoy of all people.”
“Gryffindor,” was all he said, and for the first time, mixed with derision and annoyance, there was a bit of admiration in that word pronounced by Malfoy.
“I don’t think I can. I don’t want to forget even the bad things. For some of them, it's all I’ve got. I don’t want to forget Bellatrix, or what she did to Sirius, because as long as I remember, I can prevent it from happening again.”
“I’ve never had this before. I’m almost excited to experience a big Christmas dinner with people who actually enjoy celebrating and are happy to just be together.”
“I’ll let you two to it, then,” Ron interrupted them, reminding them that he was still listening. “Good night, guys, let me know for dinner and if you need anything for the case.”
“But I do, I trust your judgment.”
He woke up with Draco still in his arms. He looked so much smaller than usual, and even though he was slightly taller than him, they just fit perfectly. He kissed his head, and rolled away from him to write to McGonagall and get started on breakfast.
“We decided to sedate him while the potions do their job, he should be up in two hours.”
“Fine? I saw her a few weeks ago, why?”
“Fuck, I hate you so much at times.” He covered his face, embarrassed, and Harry took advantage of the fact that he wasn’t looking to take him in his mouth, immediately bobbing his head quickly. “Shit,” Draco almost screamed, his hand tightening in his hair. “Harry,” he moaned, softer that expected given the situation.
“We can try, yes. Maybe we could ask the centaurs, I’m sure they could help.”
At that Harry had to stop, because he couldn't process that information while walking. “You like being tied up?”
“Just one or seven times,” he said, not able to hide his smile. “You also look amazing.” He leaned down slightly to kiss him quickly. “Shall we go?”
“Yes, sorry.” He smiled at him, and almost leaned in for a kiss before remembering they were supposed to be subtle.
“Unless it's Ron, in which case I would find it really weird, I really don’t care.”
“Okay, whatever you want.” He kissed the top of his head and rested his own against him. “It’s beautiful up here,” he said in a whisper after a couple of minutes spent in silence.
“And what about that thing that attacked Draco? He never told us what happened in the end.”
“That’s great. How are you feeling?”
“Look at you.” He pinched his cheek and retracted his hand before Harry could slap him. “Do you think he’d like to come have dinner at our house? Just so we can get to know him better and he can get to know us.”
He stayed there for a while, just enjoying the warmth of Draco cuddling him, then he realised they needed to get up soon if they didn’t want to miss breakfast and Draco’s first class.
“Sit down, Harry, I don’t need you to pass out as well.” With a flick of her wand a chair came straight from her office to him, and he sat down obediently. “I’m going to give him a general antidote just in case, but I will consult with the other healers as soon as they get here.”
“Okay first of all, you don’t apologise for your feelings. Second of all, it's fine, I don’t care. As long as you are happy, I can live without you ever telling me you love me. It's all in the little things, isn’t it?"
“I’m being serious,” he said, laughing. He reached for the cup and put it back down. “Listen, I know you don’t like Ron and his family, but it would be the most convenient time for everyone. Hermione is so busy and we need to get this done quickly, right?”
“A pretty fantastic kiss, if I do say so myself."
“So, Harry, what exactly is going on?” Mister Weasley asked when everyone had food in front of them and were too occupied eating to bicker.
“What did you see?” he asked again.
“I’ll need an entire pack of cigarettes after this.”
“Coffee, thank you.”
“So we do have the same healer.”
He swallow immediately, and slowly pulled away. “Marry Christmas,” he said, his voice just a tiny bit raspier than usual.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” He smiled, and he was pretty proud when it felt genuine. “Well, we better go before we forget the layout of the forest. If you’ll excuse us.”
“Exactly.” Draco was nothing if not self-aware. Well okay, most of the times at least. “Max, how would you like to fly a bit? I’m sorry you have to see the Ministry, but at least you can get out of here.” He nodded to Harry, and very carefully he attached the letter to the owl. “See you soon, Max.”
They opted to sit far away from the door, at a small table in the corner.
“Is she worse than me?” Draco asked, looking kind of hopeful and so cute Harry just wanted to wrap him up and hide him in his room.
“Can I sleep here tonight?” he asked, and if it wasn’t that he had been raised to always be confident and posed, Harry was sure he would have sounded extremely scared and shy.
“Yeah, I mean, look at his cute little face.” He bopped his nose lightly, smiling to himself when Theodore stirred in his sleep.
“I don't think he was capable of feelings. Making him proud only meant fuelling his rage.”
They talked about random things for a while, trying to lighten up the mood a bit, but soon enough their voices turned into a whisper, until they were both silent.
“Are you fine with apparating to Hogwarts? Or I could go there and open my Floo network for you, I’m sure you can find a place in Diagon Alley that will let you use theirs.”
“What’s this supposed to mean?”
The students immediately started practicing, and both him and Malfoy left their little stage to check on the them. Harry could feel their eyes on his back, but so far no one had dared stopping him. Malfoy, on the other hand, had been stopped a couple times, and something in the way he talked to the kids, how he looked so calm and patient compared to the Malfoy he used to know, made him feel... almost happy. It was a weird feeling, but he was happy for him, almost proud. He knew that after the trial things had been hard for the Malfoy family, and a weird, troubled part of his brain had been worried for him, but now that he knew he was doing well, he felt better.
“Yes, you are right. I’ll talk to her tonight.”
“I do. Quite a lot actually.” He smirked at that, and Harry really hated the discomfort he felt deep in his stomach at the idea of Draco recalling his past adventures.
The next morning, he woke up to Theodore meowing and Draco getting up to open his cage. He turned in the bed and watched his sleepy boyfriend stumble around the room to get the cat.
“That’s not the point,” Ron said, sensing he had said to much. “He had a crush on you and he won’t admit it.”
“What did you see?” Malfoy whispered, following closely behind him.
“Draco?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at him. Well that was new.
“Seems like once again people don’t believe me when I say there is something dangerous. Let’s hope it's going to be better than last time.” He knew he was being dramatic, but whatever. He was going to blame his proximity to Malfoy the day before. “If you’ll excuse me, I have to go get ready.” He left the room before his boss could hex him.
“I have a bad feeling. There is something watching us.”
“Not really, but I feel like we haven’t spent enough time together this week.” He sat up and reached out to touch him and bring him closer. “Hi.” He smiled at him and rested his head against his stomach. Adorable.
“Stop trying to save the damn world, Potter," Malfoy said from behind him. “Try and get a break, nothing's gonna implode." Just as fast as he had arrived, he left again.
Draco was just staring at him, pale and scared, shaking against that thing. He didn’t look completely lucid, which was good because he was probably less aware of what was going on, but also a problem because it meant he was not able to follow orders.
“And the colour of your mum’s hair. I bet he was a sap like you.” He poked his cheek, just trying to make his presence known however he could.
Harry looked one last time at the forest, then he caught up with Malfoy. “Are you okay? What happened?” he asked.
“Can I ask something?”
“Good night.” He turned around again so that Harry could spoon him, and just like that they were both asleep.
“You sound really hot when you speak French,” he said, before his brain could catch up and stop him.
They sat down on two different white sofas, in front of a beautiful fireplace covered in marble.
They did not, in fact, get tired. At all. A week later the News were covered with articles about the two of them and their new friendship. There were no details and only very subtle hints at the possibility of it being more than platonic, but it was clear that the information had come from an internal source.
“Good, I want that too.” He reached for his free hand and brought it to his lips. He wasn’t sure why – yes, he was, but he still had a dignity – but he loved his hands.
As promised, once he left the bathroom, Draco was done reading, and Theodore was in his cage for the night. They had found out that afternoon that in the night he had destroyed their toilet paper and started biting the sofa, so for the time being they decided to keep him in his cage at least while they were sleeping.
“I’d advise you to bring this up to Hermione though, just so she knows what is going on inside your head. And if you realise you are not ready, I’m sure she will say you can wait a little longer.”
“There is something I need to tell you.” He let go of him, but remained on his legs, with both hands on his shoulders. He waited for Harry to just nod, then took a deep breath. “I sent a letter to my parents when we got together. I just got their answer, they want to meet you.”
“I’m happier than I’ve ever been, I promise you I’m doing just fine.” He pecked his lips quickly, then went back at looking at the photos of his parents. He looked calm, almost happy just to see their faces. It was so incredibly heart-breaking to see, how he had just accepted this, like he had accepted all that had come his way.
“Thank you.” He waited for her to separate them from the rest of the room, then he left Theodore's carrier on the chair and he settled down next to Draco, who stirred in his sleep to hold him but didn’t wake up. As soon as his head hit the pillow, he was asleep as well.
“But-“
“For what? I’d be worried if you never got hard while kissing me.”
“Thanks, Potter," Malfoy called after him.
They started walking, again, and Harry kept thinking about what Draco had just told him. Having all that power on someone, in such a vulnerable moment. Just the idea was giving him a rush. And to know that Draco actually trusted him enough to let him do it. He really shouldn’t have worried.
“Git,” he muttered, getting even closer to the forest. He whispered a quick spell that allowed him to see better in the dark, a new invention that the Autors were testing for special missions, and started to scan the trees.
“I’m sorry, I'm not the one who’s supposed to be crying.” He wiped at his face quickly, trying to calm himself.
“Where is he now?”
“Then I don’t have a place there either. Listen, I'm really serious about us, whether we go there as a couple or not, I will support you.”
“You are a genius,” he said, not able to contain himself.
“We'll have to do a demonstration of what we are gonna teach them. Like we did in second year, remember?”
“I could never hate spending time with you. The lessons will be around an hour and a half, then we will have all evening to cuddle and talk.”
“I have good news for you.” He practically jumped on the bed, landing next to Draco.
“Okay, meet me in five minutes at the door?”
“About what?” He went back to caressing him, trying in every way to comfort him and make him feel better.
“I don’t want you to worry for me.”
They walked in silence until they reached the greenhouse. It almost felt as if everything around knew that a great crime had been committed. The birds were not chirping, the flowers were all pointing down, as if grieving, and the fact that the kids were not around made the whole thing even sadder.
Harry laughed at that; he couldn’t really blame her. “Fair enough” he said, looking around at the students.
“Thanks, me too. I was worried for nothing.”
“Okay, time to go. My baby needs some food.” He basically threw his bag at Harry, and hold the carrier close to his chest. “This is going to be uncomfortable, sweetheart, but we will be home soon.” Harry was doomed. How was he supposed to resist Draco talking to his cat?
“So,” Hermione started, “I had someone analyse what you sent me. Nothing wrong on the fur of the unicorn, no traces of weird substances, but it reacted for a high level of dark magic. Like incredibly high.”
“How could I forget? You bloody spoke with a snake.”
“I have some papers to grade for tomorrow,” he said, clearly unhappy about that. If there was something Draco hated, it was grading papers. He loved preparing his lessons and working with the kids, but he absolutely despised grading, especially when he had to give a bad grade to someone he knew was trying really hard. Harry had witnessed it more than once in the months the had spent together, and he never stopped finding it amusing, the way he would just walk around a room reading out questions and cursing at a dumb answer.
“No, you shouldn’t have. I almost got a portkey to Rome.”
“What if today we don’t work and just cuddle all evening?” he proposed.
Harry barely held back his laughter at that. He couldn’t believe he had gone from hating Draco Malfoy the posh boy to finding him extremely adorable when he talked about wine.
“Will he be fine?” he asked, not able to take his eyes away from his boyfriend. He looked so pale and fragile now, with his messy bun and ripped clothes, blood covering his neck where that thing had bitten him.
And then it stopped, and Draco was on all fours on the ground, coughing blood, while Ron was attacking the creature, whatever it was, with fire from the back. “Boys, get him," he ordered, never stopping the fire.
That snake loved him as well as Otiz, she wasn't so sure about Draco but as she had said "mate is mate" what ever that meant to him, he didn't care he was just happy that he could have private conversations with her and she wouldn't tell as soul or at least she didn't tell Tom he hoped.
"Oh yeah I forgot about that as well, oops Mother and Father won't be happy with that. I have also heard that the new Headmaster will be joining us as well".
It was time to go to Hogwarts and start of a whole new year but Harry had a feeling that something again was going to happen like the Stone and Sirius but what he didn't know.
Once they had the quills and ink they left Luna as she was meeting up with some of her friends, not knowing that it was Hermione she was meeting up with.
"Well Miss Weasely it looks like you too are in some trouble, I think both Porfessor McGonagall and I would like to have a private word with you in... your office Minerva? or mine?" said Severus to Ginny before directing the last of it to Minerva.
Harry apologised to him but Severus said "it's alright. The reason I'm here is to take you out of this household but before I do I have one question" Harry nodded to this.
"I have to admit that that's some impressive accidental magic, bring a stuffed animal to life" and he hugged his son tightly only to have the snake go up his arm and make his home around Severus' neck.
Remus gave Sirius a quick kiss on his forehead and started to leave the room but Sirius held him and looked at Tom.
George- 'orge
...........  mudblood  ........
Inside Harry brought them to the hoodies which one that he saw had a red loin and green snake on, which paid homage to both Griffindor and Slytherin which made Severus laugh.
"What took you so long? I got bored of waiting" smirked Harry to them knowing he was the reason.
"As I was saying I was telling him that we had Transfiguration now and that he was heading the wrong way"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Still not used to magical transportation?" asked Lucius to Severus as he was still rubbing his son's back.
Tom was in deep, deep trouble by his boyfriend now and he didn't know what he was going to do to get himself out of it.
Age 6:
I herby take away all of your own personal quills, you will be using one given to you by the teachers each and every lesson, you will be sitting up at the teacher's desk so then we can keep an eye on you, you will return all the money that you gained from selling the answers to your peers. You will have detention with me for the next three months and you WILL rewrite all your assignments.
Snape 466
"We would like to see young Mister Snape's account manager if you would be so kind" said Lucius only to see that it was Griphook and he smiled evilly he knew again that he was going to learn something very, very interesting.
She managed to get off the bench and rushed over to the group of friends and hugged Harry from behind making he go stiff as a board at being touched unexpectedly and from behind as well, it reminded him of what Dudley would do before he got either kicked or punched by him or if it was Vernon it would be whips onto his back.
"Harry I can't believe you have turned against your friends! You are the boy that lived! The one that will kill the one who shan't be named!! We love you Harry come back to our side" yelled Ron gaining everyone's attention that was in the hall.
Staff members all cooed at what they thought was the father of the sleeping boy making him blush slightly, once at the till they paid and headed back to the Leaky Cauldron and then they apparated after Lupin took hold of Severus sleeve along with Harry.
"Harry, Harry it's me Sirius, you should remember..." he was cut of by one Remus Lupin hitting him and Otiz biting his leg.
"Hadrian come now, we know what has happened it wasn't your fault my son. You are no longer Harry Potter, you are and for ever be Hardian Jameson Severus Snape my son".
He then looked at the new Headmaster of Hogwarts and glared the best he could in the circumstances but backed down fully when Tom's eyes flashed red.
"Ah Tomas thank you for coming, I think you know Mr. Albus Dumbledore?" Tom kindly nodded, yes he knew the old coot from when he was at school but as he was using a entirely different name now he just replied with "only in hearing" his Hungarian accent coming forth.
"Later Otiz you've just had breakfast and before that we have to go shopping and then after lunch you can have a blood pop" said Harry to the hyperactive child.
"If either of them don't stop they will be put into detention and if that doesn't help they will be isolated from the school, to complete their work and have meals as well.
((Sorry Fred and George, I love you so much))
Severus closed his eyes and remembered what his father used to beat him, he quickly snapped out of it and stared into Albus' eyes.
Don't bring your stupid mutt of a pet!!
Otiz had selected many blue tops all differing in shades, black trousers and blue and white shoes, he wanted no other colours besides those.
.........
"Professor he fell when he turned round" said Ginny smiling, playing the innocent game, which wasn't working.
With Tom's nod of conformation about using his first name Fudge continued.
Severus slowly crept into the house, he slowly went up the stairs, every one with a louder creek. Once he was at the top of the stairs he looked at the four doors that seemed to open, all except once. The last door, at the end of the hallway, was closed and locked from the outside. He rushed to the locked door, still being quiet as a mouse and once again whispered "Alohomora" all the locks unlocked.
There the good was happily sitting there talking away, with a soft whistle Otiz perked up making his ears and tail appear and then without hurt Lucius or Tom he jumped into the air and landed on his feet and then ran up to Harry and Draco.
"So how did he, the puff ball become human anyway? asked Draco only to have Otiz growl at him, he hated to be called names.
Sirius wasn't liking the whole thing and was now nursing a very unwell stomach as he was throwing up, "never again".
Harry finally turned round and met Griphook in the eyes and then he sighed "very well young Heir Prince we will get to it right now, but I have to warn you that it will hurt. That is something that I can guarantee you on that and I am sorry".
Every saw this and all wanting to know who this was and so Albus got up and walked over along with Severus and Remus.
"Harry leave those slimy snakes and come back to the lions right now" said Hermione, she was not helping one bit but she had to put her two cents in.
Otiz transformed into his teenage form and leaned against the sofa and smiled to them knowing what had happened.
"... Hadi kins..."
Fred and George- they would be getting some muggle jokes and pranks that they could easily turn magical and sweets
~are you sure you want to do that~
Harry was pressed up against Severus for dear life, he didn't want to be there at all but he knew that this is what his father wanted and that nothing would harm him while he was there to protect him.
He was now seething in his office marking essays and drinking some fire whiskey and trying to drown out his worries and trying desperately not to cry.
Natural Occulemency (100% blocked)
"Good that you know, come on let's gets cleaning while Hadrian rests ok, you gave him quite the shock transforming into a human."
"Not"
Everyone came out of the memory and then looked at Harry who was now almost asleep on the small sofa being watched over still by the officer.
Remember Gringotts and the Ministry all know that you are my son and that you are now in Slytherin so you may go back to your dorm and wait for me" Harry nodded to his father and left the room, the air tense with two formidable wizards in the room.
While Tom was trying to get forgiveness from Severus everyone else had decided to go to Hogsmeade for the day as it was the weekend.
"I think you did Gred"
"Luna why are you barefoot?" she asked the snow white blond.
"Oh hello there Harry or is it Hadrian now? No it's Hadrian now" she smiled at him and he smiled back to her.
..........
His face turned red in anger!
Narcissa- Nana
Favourite drink: blood, will drink water when he's 14
They arrived at Malfoy Manor where they were welcomed by all three Malfoy's in the Floo room but when the three Snape's stepped out they noticed Otiz in Harry's arms.
"Will you stop staring at the other tables Ronald and finish your breakfast you have class to get to" snapped Percy bringing practically everyone in listening range to look at the youngest male Weasely.
So far he had:
Ninth memory from the age of eleven just before he went to school, dislocated shoulder, elbow and ankle all on the same side.
It was not 10 am and they were finally getting ready to head over to the Malfoy's, Otiz wasn't sure about the whole travel by floo thing but he was with Harry and he knew he would protect him, like he would protect him and Severus.
He started crying he was missing them all of his family, his friends and his teachers including Snape the would rather do detention in Potions then be here.
A Tom helped Harry in court he never went into the chamber
The new first years didn't know what was happening but they were afraid of what was going to be said.
"Welcome!" said the chipper voice once Severus opened the door.
"Ok now that we are all up, this early morning, I think a nice warm breakfast with coffee and hot chocolate would be a good idea to start the day don't you think?" said Severus as he got out of bed leaving Harry there laughing.
Harry goes to court to sort everything out, what is Dumbles trying to do now?
Do not fear son, everything will work out I assure you on this, but I would like to ask you another question if that is alright with you on this matter?" Harry just nodded mouth full of pancake smiling slightly.
"I would like everyone that has had been hurt by Mister Weasely to come to my office right away and I would like each and everyone one to write a statement.
"You fucking heard it, I had sex with everyone I could get my hands on so then I didn't have to do my lousy bloody stinking homework! I did it all so then I could become Mrs Potter, get the Potter fortune and then I was going to kill Harry off!"
By dinner that night everyone had enough of her but there was nothing they could do for her, she wouldn't listen to them, it was so bloody annoying!
"I'm sure, he was and still is my favourite cousin after Regulus died at nineteen" said Narcissa as she took a sip of the drink Draco had gotten her which was called if she recalled a Slushie.
"It's better than before, we can ask questions and answer them when called on" said Theo who didn't look up from his book he was reading.
Severus had had enough and when Otiz came running back into the living room he managed to grab the child and place him on his lap, bright big emerald green eyes looked back up at him.
"Ow" rubbed his shoulder.
This made everyone in the court room gasp, the boy sitting next to the potions master looked nothing like Harry Potter so who was the boy? and why did Albus as for an unknown boy to a court that was to do with Harry Potter.
Everyone looked at her knowing that with everything going on she was most likely lying about trying to steal Draco's familiar.
Yet again Dudley was banging on the glass of an enclosure scaring the poor animal inside, inside the enclosure it was a Komodo dragon.
"Our..."
"Secrets revealed, hair changing, ears and tails, got to love fireworks, puking pastilles" said George listing just some of the pranks that they had with them but was willing to make more if needed.
Sirius just sighed he didn't want his godson anywhere near Severus but if the man had helped him and saved his life there was nothing else he could do, he was in Azkaban for most of the boys life he didn't really have a say anymore.
"Severus the boy has to return to his relatives house when summer begins, the blood wards with protect him for any harm that may come to him, it's all for the greater good" the god damn twinkle was in his eyes again this meant he was up to something.
The roughly picked him up by his arms and said "Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore we at the Ministry find you guilty of treason against our Great Nation and putting young witches and wizards into in-compromising positions where their lives are on the lines where they shouldn't be.
Birth Certificate:
With their loving care I know his relatives will look after him and care for him like any other family should. They have missed him and have reported it to the Muggle authorities because he went missing...."
"Mister Sötétség if you could share your views as I don't think we need anymore evidence due to what we have here" said Amelia to the court room who all nodded in agreement.
A house elf wearing a crisp green and black towel with the letter 'S' embroidered on it placed a sippy cup onto the table in front of Hadrian's food.
On one side sat Severus with Harry, by default Otiz in his teenage form and their lawyer one Tomas Marvolo Sötétség ((Tom Riddle! Yay he's in the book finally)) their friends and family sat behind them, Draco and Blaise close enough to reassure him if needed.
"I want you six in my office now" said Severus to them making the five friends get up and leave, Otiz got up and glares at Albus and said "it looks like I won't be joining you for tea Headmaster" and with that he left.
Minerva picked up one parchment that was for a sixth year Ravenclaw stating that he was punched and kicked in the most delicate area and in the face and forced to write his assignments last year even though he was trying to study in the library at the time, it was sighed Alexi Hickinbottom, she could tell that he had been crying writing this.
"Welcome dear, I've missed you" said Molly hugging Harry again, "that's alright Mrs. Weasely I've had such a great year so far and I'm happy to be here to celebrate the holidays" said Harry as both were led to the sofa, Otiz on the other hand knew that someone was here that Harry didn't like and so kept very close.
Longbottom (through godparents, after son, Heir)
"What are you three up to?" asked Draco has he had gone off to get them some drinks with the help of Blaise, Theo and Percy who seemed ok to him, a bit stuck up but other than that fine.
"Not in a bad mood"
At that moment Harry broke!! Tears streamed down his face, pain fully etched on his face, Slytherin and Gryffindor students alike older and younger came to see what was happening.
Everyone heard hissing and then Tom laughing.
"Otiz who are you going to use them on?" asked Harry to him but Otiz just hissed
"Sadly Headmaster a familiar can't be away from those he or she deems needs to be protected. He will stay due to Hadrian being here, he shouldn't hurt anyone if you don't provoke him, that is" said Severus sitting down, letting his son take the remaining seat while Remus stood behind them, keeping an eye on the thing that was his cub's familiar.
"Fine" was all he replied back with and jumped into the air and landed on the bench with such grace it was unheard of.
If anyone was wondering he looks like a blue haired Severus when he was a teen and has his matching green eyes to Harry, his temper is that of adult Severus
I can't believe what I've just been told about one Mr. Harry Potter for crying out loud, how the hell did he manage not to let anyone see as well as tell anyone, Merlin he must be in so much pain, I need to tell Albus about this right away.
I will see you tonight at 7pm sharp!, everyone read the chapter on the body bind curse and write an essay on it, a foot long please, class dismissed" and with that everyone left for thei next class.
...........
Harry was curled around himself like a cat lightly snoring not at all noticing he had yet again changed form.
"So Potter part of the snakes now are you? Remember you will also be a lion in the snakes den" said Pansy
Filius grabbed some parchment and a self writing quill making Harry look at him in disgust.
Ginny's hair was now snot green it even felt like it which made her almost throw up due to it all, Ron was fuming and when he saw his brother's he went right up to them demanding that they change Ginny's hair back.
Albus couldn't and wouldn't care for the boy, thank Merlin that the Dursley's weren't there at that moment on time as he was trying to his who he was and if he killed them now they would know who he truly was.
As everyone started eating the three jokesters retuned all laughing at what they had planned.
As he was just standing there he didn't notice that someone was at his door again, it wasn't until she hummed that he turned around to face her.
Hufflepuff 8
"Severus I think he's completely out cold now" said Pomona as she got up to sign her name on the parchment like everyone else did, lastly Severus signed his name.
"I'll go get him right now"
The Anderson's-
If young Hadrian would be willing to submit them that would help everything, you cause" said Fudge to him.
"Granger?!"
They looked again and it seemed that it had eating it's fill as was now looking at Draco and if it could smile it did.
"Ronald Bilius Noname you are to escorted out as you are no longer a wizard, you magic has been locked away and you will never be able to feel it again" said one of the Aurors making Ron look at him wondering what he meant but nothing else was said.
I have heard something's that have been happening at school but I'm not a hundred percent sure if they are true or not if they are true but with how Hadrian acted when Ron walked in I'm inclined to say that it's true.
They apparated right outside Gringotts bank and Harry doubled over in pain clutching his stomach in pain making Severus look at him as now he was white as a sheet of paper, as if he was about to throw up any second, right away Severus started to rub his back slowly making him feel better.
......
"Hadrian don't worry about her she won't be able to do a thing with us here, she will be place on the magical reins so she won't be able to spoil yours and Draco's birthday treat" said the twins as they were still pinned by Otiz as he was now lying down on them looking like he was asleep.
Harry's gifts consisted of some new robes from Narcissa which were emerald green to match his eyes with the Potter crest on them, from Draco he got a broom cleaning kit as well as some owl treats for Hedwig and some sweets, Lucius had sent a photo of all five of them together along with some parchment and new quills. From Severus he got some owl treats again, another set of robes and some sweets.
Oi Snape, you and me wizard duel by the freaking Whomping Willow tonight at 7 we will see who wins this battle after what you did to me and my sister. You will regret what you did to us Weasely's!
Age 4:
"Welcome to Slytherin Hadrian".
Poppy
Hermione didn't know what to say as she knew they belonged to her and would get into trouble if she said that they weren't but if they she didn't she would get into more trouble. She didnt know what to do either.
"Where's Lucius?" asked Severus holding up the snake cane (SNAKEY THE SNAKE CANE), everyone looked at him.
Peverell 1 to 3
"Hello Hagrid I was wondering if I could ask you some questions? I think you might know who is pulling these stupid and utterly ridiculous pranks on the school" she said in a matter of factly.
An hour later Tyki was back with a note in his mouth from Lucius:
"No Lucius and I don't know what to so with it all, we have tried potions but he still ends up being ill" sighed Severus finally letting Harry go and he went to hug Draco and slightly gave him a kiss to his cheek which ended up with both of them blushing Weasely red which earned a muffled laugh from Narcissa.
Severus just laughed at him.
"Ok you lot what are you up to and can uncle Padfoot join in?" asked Sirius as he headed over to them.
"Ok mister time to get you some toy's to keep you occupied" said Severus who was now carrying the child, who had buried his nose in his neck since Madam Malkin asked him to change his clothes.
"Snape if you please" said Harry to it
"Sev, Wolfie" and he nodded to them and started eating his meal.
"Max come on and eat your breakfast or you will be late again. It's the same every morning with you. Your father and I won't keep taking you to school because you can't finish on time" said his new mother bringing him to the table, placing a bowl of rice crispies in front of him.
Severus sent the young blond a glare, by Merlin he hated that name from his godson, Draco just ignore him sand carried on with what he was saying.
"Harry just calm down for me ok. Draco didn't mean any of that" whispered Severus into his ear relaxing the child on his lap, the child was shaking with anger and frustration all he wanted to do was leave this mansion and sleep, he wanted nothing more to do here and Severus knew it.
The door opened, only to be hit with the smell of blood, I looked around the room but it was too dark to see. "Lumos", I gasped in shock for the sight in front of him. Harry lay bloody and bruised in a small corner of the room. I could hear a faint whimper coming from the boy and walked closer only for Harry to flinch away and whisper "I'm sorry sir, I'll be more quiet. Please sir I won't disobey you again. Just don't hit me" I was in shock. What the hell has happened here?!
Time for Harry and Severus to get away for a while
"Otiz you know that it's bad to destroy the house right?" asked Severus to the small boy, placing him on his feet and standing up as they walked out of the room.
"I'll be going to the Headmaster about this just wait and see what he has to say about this when I get him back into his position of Headmaster! That fake sitting in his seat will be out!"
Draco had managed to get Theo and Blaise to come to join in the fun, they had been playing 2 on 2 Quidditch which had Harry and Draco on opposite teams as they were the best of the best out of the school anyway plus it wouldn't be fair if they were both against poor Theo and Blaise.
"I can't believe they did this" moaned Draco as he was now sporting a pair of antlers which were snow white with silver tips to match his hair and eyes.
~i hope you stick to that snake I really do~ and Otiz walked off, they could hear that the was now under the table due to the chairs scratching the floor as he went to lie down.
"She did nothing wrong... those two must of slipped somthing into her food" yelled Hermione so everyone could hear her which wasn't hard as she was screaming like a Banshee.
"For the last time if another one of you dunderheads blow up another one of my cauldrons I will have you here for detention every night until you graduate from here! That includes the holiday's" he snapped at a group of Hufflepuffs and Slytherins.
"Otiz I wanna go back to dad now, please" said Harry in a small voice clinging to Draco more than he would normally, this made Otiz sigh but he had to protect them as werewolf Remus was now stocking them again as Sirius got back up again.
I have helped you in more ways than you will know, after you killed me I was left for dead as particles and I traveled around and over the last few years managed to come back to what you see me s now.
"Otiz Hadrian Severus Snape get back him and tidy up this lab! NOW!" came the voice.
The stern stoic man acting like a children which he never got to do when he was a child thanks to his father and grandfather but today they saw him happy and let that stupid Malfoy mask down and they finally saw the man that they became friends with as well as fell in love with.
"Did you hear that?" asked Harry only for Draco to nod, "it's said the food was yummy".
I slowly crept into the house and went up the stairs, everyone with a louder creek, damn! Once at the top of the stairs I saw four doors that seemed to open, all except one. The last door, at the end of the hallway, was closed and locked from the outside, what the hell?! I rushed to the locked door, still being quiet as a mouse and once again whispered "Alohomora" at once all the locks unlocked.
"I know something must be up for them to act this way" said Theo getting up and heading to the dorm room only to be met with a snarling Otiz pacing back and forth, he could understand what he was saying he wouldn't be screaming right now.
Only the Slytherin's knew about Coco and so played along with it all.
"Yes Professor" said Ginny but as she was about to leave when the door burst open to reveal one Molly and Arthur Weasely both having anger written on their faces... Arthur more as he had been called out of an important meeting at the Ministry.
Fur colour: ice blue
Fred and George kept themselves to themselves but they had made sure that the House Elves had slipped something into their food, it was the same thing as Ron and Hermione had, this was going to be so much fun.
"Harry in Merlin's name answer me!!" yelled Ron at the top of his voice making Binns stop talking.
Everyone sat down in their places Otiz even had a booster seat right next to Harry, in front of plate he had a sippy cup full of blood which made Draco cringe at the thought about this little boy would be drinking blood.
They have the ability to shape shift into human forms and love to play tricks, they are also faithful guardians, friends, lovers and partners.
Ravenclaw 7
Fred, George, Percy, Charlie, Bill, Molly, Arthur, Neville, Luna, Draco, Blaise, Pansy, Theo, Lucius and Narcissa Severus and Harry but with his lisp, when he was human, it was funny how he tried to pronounce their names. ((A/n list will be below))
"Fine...."
"The goof if spoilt rotton by my son... Don't even think of saying no to that because I know that you have given him extra raw meat compared to his normal meals" said Severus to him only to have Harry blush.
Narcissa- Cissa
Lying about abuse (100% broken)
"Hadrian calm down ok" said Theo who rested his arm on his shoulder making the boy take a deep breath.
"What? Who are you?!" he stammered out only for her to sigh slightly and walk into the room.
"Don't worry Mister Snape I won't be using this like Mister and Miss Weasley have done as well as a Miss Granger, mine are only for times like this. Just some notes and then I'll do some research, it won't be used again for quite a while I asure you" and he smiled at the raven haired boy.
He was automatically placed in Slytherin as well as he has his own wand this was without going to Ollivander's, due to being what he is, his magic made his wand.
He was brought to the Gryffindor table right away and asked all sorts of questions on why he had disappeared over the weekend they; namely Ron and Hermione, wanted to go and sneak into Hogsmead with him but couldn't find him at all and so they did it without him resulting in detention for both of them.
Merlin- Father (Lord)
Harry just hummed and pulled his legs towards him and curled into a ball saying nothing, Severus knew that he wouldn't be talking for a while now and that soon he would be asleep but first dinner.
"But you still told!" Harry almost screamed but once he took in all the information that he was given he knew, even though he hadn't spent much time with the Weasely's he knew Molly would follow through.
"How did they find out anyway... I mean Mr and Mrs Weasely?" at this he looked straight into onyx eyes.
Tom went to comfort him which he let him. Which surprised Tom more, he knew he did wrong and what he didn't know was how much it must of hurt his lover and his son.
Once in the kitchen he spotted Severus who was once not in complete black, he had a dark grey top on and black trousers on and dark dragonhide boots, he was sitting at the table drinking his coffee, reading the paper with a plate of pancakes in front of him, Harry sat down and started to each his breakfast.
.................
"Oh Remmy, Remmy what have you done to her, she's going to become the one thing that you hate the most, she's going to become a werewolf. Oh my love" he slowly walked over to him and werewolf Remus hunched down and whined to him as if to say sorry.
You Draco have a loving family he never has and it's going to take so much time for him to understand that, he hates loud noises, screams you name it it's there anything unexpected really. His appetite is something we are working on, as you saw he wont take anything without being allowed to, only at school he's comfortable with it all.
"Don't even think about using me or Hads in anyway, I don't trust you but as I can tell that both Lu-Lu and Sev trust you that means I'm safe" and this time Otiz released some of his magic, his eyes glowed brightly in warning.
By the middle of the week, they were all potting on how to kill her without anyone finding out that it was them, this included the teacher who used to love her and all the hard work she used to do.
Each memory was placed in vial and put into a box with Harry's files in.
"I think you should stop that before I call over a member of the staff" said Severus right behind the whale known as Vernon Dursley.
Remus is right once Otiz gets to know you he will be fine with you but as Remus also said Otiz had three forms, his fox form which is a light blue fox, a child from which appears to be six and his teenage form which I think is about fourteen.
"Molly and Arthur sent a howler to them as you know we saw them over Christmas, made friends with most of the Weasley family he loved Molly but when Ronald and Ginerva mostly Ronald started to abuse Hadrian, Otiz went on the attack they only stop thanks to Molly and Arthur coming in.
He was now under house arrest and wasn't allowed to leave his private quarters, he wasn't even allow to do his work or even have meals in the Great Hall. He was stuck in a small room, with just a small bed, a table and chair and s sliver of a window; he wasn't even allowed his wand and with nothing to do besides plot the down fall of one Harry James Potter!!
Coming back into the room Severus now had his hair down and looked right at his son.... "the photo Hadrian..." was all he said but Harry didn't move, no way he was letting the picture out of his sight.
.......
Godparents:
"Hadrian go and see Poppy about your elbow and then come back to our chambers" this made his son nod and all three boys walked out of the office and made their way down to see Poppy.
"Ron listen, dad.... Severus saved me over the summer as my uncle beat me within an inch of my life without him I would of died. He adopted me and gave me have a life that I should of been given but sadly was denied until then.
By the time first class was upon them Ginny was mouthing off about how great she was and how no matter what she was going to be the next Mrs. Potter even though Harry was no longer a Potter!
After reading for a while he finally heard movement in his bedroom meaning that Harry was finally getting up for the day, he carried on with the news paper that he was reading until he spotted a mop of dark hair in the door way and when he looked it rushed away banging a door as he went.
Eyes: Emerald green
...............
Once home all of Ginny's clothes were changed to plain bland coloured clothes, her hair was made to sit in a high bun and she wasn't allowed out of her room unless called for, the same with the house, she was taught how to make a simple dinner but Molly won't let her touch anything else, she didn't trust her anymore.
"We went to the Muggle zoo in London and that's where we saw them, I had left Otiz at home due to his fur colour, we didn't know he could become human.... Ouch!"
He had to get the boy.... no the brat back under control and fast and if taking that bat to court he would do anything in this power to get it!
"Severus... and this must be Harry..... hello cub" said the name only known as Lupin.
B.O.B: 10th October
A howl sounded making Hermione shut up for a change and go completely still something or someone was close by, she wanted someone to hold her like her mum did when she was little when she had bad dreams.
"He's fine just slightly confused as to why it's happening but he perfectly ok so don't worry too much" said Tom placing his hand on Harry, feeling the warmth coming off him.
With the next hour the Weasely's had left the Ministry Ginny was lagging behind not by much though.
"Ahh Severus it looks like you got the message left at the Snake Pit" and she laughed.
"Griphook I would like to take up full custody of Harry here as it has come my knowledge that he isn't being cared for by his family as well as his guardian, whoever that might be that is" said Severus to the Goblin who in turn smiled at him.
"Yes he came into the lab and wasn't happy that you were boring and no fun, then then asked to be carried and here we are ten minutes later" he brushed Otiz' hair out of his eyes the child snoring slightly.
Severus signed and kept rubbing his son's back to comfort him, "Misters Zabini and Malfoy I would like you to ask that you take my son to the hospital wing to get his elbow checked and twenty points to Slytherin for helping a fellow student".
"Rest young Heir Prince and I will bring in your father, is there anyone else you would like here as well? " asked Griphook but Harry just shook his head all he wanted was his father.
"Oh hello Fawkes what are you doing her?" she was very confused by it.
"Otiz get back here!" yelled Severus to the hybrid animal but he was upstairs in a few bounds and was by Harry's side within seconds of landing, he was mewing in delight only to stop when the three boys looked at him.
"Harry just leave them, I bet Dumbledore would be happy to transfer you back to Gryffindor now if we go" said Hermione pleading now.
"Enter"
Noting that Otiz was lost for choice Harry glanced at his dad who tapped on the toys, he now had snitches one stuffed and one interactive, a children's toy broom, a toy Quidditch set that let you play out games.
"I was thinking London first then Diagon Alley afterwards if we cant find what we are looking for" finished Severus having Harry again nod to him, he wasnt in a talking mood really.
Harry was in complete shock! How did it happen?
They knew something was going to be up if those two had something to do with it all.
"It appears not Tomas, that man never did anything besides meddle in other people's personal lives" said Severus as he sat down a small smile playing on his lips.
"Otiz Hadrian Severus Snape, familiar to one Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, please to meet you Madam" said Otiz to her.
Tom was only half way through that weeks paperwork that Dumbledore had left, he was still trying to catch up with years of paper work that never seemed to be ending when there was a knock at the door.
"But Harry Harry don't you remember me, you called me Paddy when you were little!"
Both wizards knew that with Albus in that much power something was going to go wrong, terribly wrong, but Lucius being Lucius he was able to collect all of the most incriminating evidence including everything from his court case as well as having Harry's memories of his relatives treating him and how he tried to tell Albus about said relatives, they also had his medical records, the adoption as well as the blood adoption certificates.. everything was piling up nicely if you asked them.
"Thank you again for this Otiz" and he reached out and rubbed and scratched Otiz behind the ear making him purr in delight.
Molly- was getting a cook book of muggle foods
**Did you even check on the boy?? Did you know that he was beaten? Malnourished, dehydrated, bones broken and misshaped, lung punctured, bruises and burns, scars that have healed and some that were still pink. Words carved into his front and back....I don't even want to think about that anymore..... The boy Albus as you put it was safe, I think not I also found that the boy bloody and he was raped Albus!! Raped!! He was treated less than a house elf.
🌸Personal secerets revealed
He looked away from him and towards... Madam Pomfrey who just kept an eye on him as Severus was talking to him.
During the rest of the day Otiz stayed by this side not leaving, he had asked an House Elf for some food as he didn't to leave just in case something happened to Hadrian while he wasn't there.
Sirius' head bolted right up hitting his head to the underneath of the table thank God he was in his Animagus form so he couldn't swear but Tom knew he was.
"I think Severus.... can I call you that? If it does come to this you will have to. Albus isn't one to listen once he get something into that head of his. I have been telling him that he is your son but not once had he looked at the documents I have presented him with.
Otiz really wanted to doodle on some of the class but he too was almost asleep half way through.... Hermione on the other hand wasn't so there went that idea.
"Ok ok cub calm down for a moment and we will all go on them with you" said Remus trying to calm down his godson but it was short lived even when they had lunch, Harry was up and gone before they could even finish eating, good thing he had Otiz and Lucius with him and by default Sirius.
The reports showed nothing out of the ordinary for a baby a cough or cold here and there nothing alarming to be said until it reached the age of two and then it was bad and I mean really bad.
Molly gave her two youngest a look at would even kill Voldemort himself ten times over and left to go back home on having done a good job of installing fear, she hummed as she walked to the floo.
They were in a heated discussion about house elves while Draco and Harry played a game of chess after Otiz licked Draco's hand of course.
The following day had the twins holding the Marauder's map searching for the Stooges as they had taken the liberty to called their younger siblings, Hermione and the Headmaster... but they were looking for someone pacific....
The Malfoy family sighed at it all and sat down in the love seat (Luc and Cissa) and on the matching chair (Draco) while Tom glared along with Severus who pinched his nose and sighed.
Harry just shuddered he knew something was up but didn't say anything and kept watching.
"...to happen..."
George
Otiz only calmed down slightly now that he knew why he didn't like this place if Harry was upset, he wanted to protect him and by Merlin he would.
Who can be the adrenaline junkie out of everyone?
~Sometimes I hate you~
"Hadrian please it's too early, I know it's my birthday and all that but I didn't go to bed until 11 last night as I was having trouble with my homework and I wanted to mak..." he was stopped by a stinging hex to his back.
"...like..."
Severus sat there for a few more minutes thinking that his son was asleep he went to get up but that when he was hugged by a limpet and wouldn't let go so he brought him to to the living area and placed on his lap on the sofa.
Harry was still behind him, holding desperately to him, he hated seeing the Dursley's here but he couldn't get out of it.
A very angry Severus Snape was making his way to Dumbledore's office to discuss some new information he had just informed on by Madam Poppy Pomfrey.
Name:
In the greenhouse they were working on the Valerian plant and what it could be used for most of the students made an 'yum' when they learned it could be used for Treacle Fudge but not Harry, they all knew he loved treacle tart but the mention of the fudge made him feel really sick to his stomach.
Harry was sitting in Transfiguration class listening on how to transform an animal into a crystal clear water goblets, Harry hated it as he only managed to half of it right and so was practicing with all his might, making sure the pronunciation was correct.
"I'm sorry Maxwell but your parents phoned ahead again saying that your were struggling and can't remember again so... as you know I'm here to help you with your day to day routine" said the person when he finally looked at them.
"Miss Granger must I inform you that if you carry on you will be exspelled from Hogwarts as you are already in so much trouble as it is" said Minvera to her.
Severus had left the room by then and headed straight to McGonagall's office and without waiting for a reply to his knock he walked straight in.
"Yes Madam Pince" said Hermione and she sat down like she had done like all her classes, she was being treated like a five year old that couldn't be trusted with anything. Even her quill had been changed into something for young child.. so the couldn't get hurt.
Otiz had fire coming out of his mouth and shot it towards them, with that they fled from the compartment only to in counter Marcus Flint.
Just then a firework went off sending Otiz up in the air and hiss at the twins he almost bit them but stopped when Harry laughed, the firework sent out little pictures of the houses this one was a dancing Hufflepuff logo.
Tom was filling in some paperwork with Sirius under his desk sleeping, he so wanted to be with Harry but he wasn't sure if that was a good idea or not, he knew Remus must of known he was there as well but he again wasn't sure and so decided to stick close with Tom to be on the safe side.
As they landing after the Portkey which Harry held on for dear life Severus greeted some of the others that where waiting for them, he spotted the Malfoys right away and whispered to Harry that Draco were there which made the boy perk up more even if he was still looking very green.
"Who are you?, you look like a second year with your frizzy hair and buck teeth" said Sirius as he got up and looked around, "damn in the forest again, just like my Hogwarts years, I miss them", looks around again ignoring Hermione all together as she tried to tell him but failed to tell him who she was.
I hope you all like this book 2 when I get up and writing it as this is just a quick review of book 1 mind you.
"He's about six I think, but his lisp makes him sound younger than he is" said Hadrian as he sat down on the sofa in the living room again.
"Young Heir Prince if you would do the honours of drinking the whole goblet to complete the blood adoption" said Griphook once he saw Harry's face.
"I heard the commotion and I don't condone bullies as much as the next person... So Mister Snape let's get this elbow seen too" and with a flick of her wand she cast a diagnosis spell on his elbow.
Broken leg, burn to leg, bruised chest, knocked head, malnutrition, dehydrated
In his quarters Harry was waiting with baited breath, he didn't want to go back to the Dursleys nor did he want to go back to Gryffindor he had managed to improve his grades and he had made some friends at least he thought he did.
"You know there isn't any student called Potter in Hogwarts anymore" said Severus as he ran his callus hand through his son's hair.
"Blasted old pictures I should of snuffed them all out and leave mine there instead" muttered Albus to himself, Fawkes just looked at him and trilled and left as well. He was starting to not like this Headmaster anymore.
Then he spotted Tom, his brown eyes sparkling at what he was seeing, a hybrid familiar and one that belonged to the Boy Who Lived!
We also have Sniddle if no one knows it's Severus Tobias Snape and Tom Marvolo Riddle relationship which I think we need more of, it's a nice relationship in my book. Tom is known as Tomas Malakai Sötétség and he's been living in Hungary before coming back as a Lawyer and then he becomes Headmaster.
"How could you! That was my wand!" screamed Ginny to the three adults in the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Some of them have had a back experience of a bored Harry but never and hyperactive, excitable Harry before.
He walked right up to the front door of number 4 and whispered "Alohomora" and with a soft click he walked into the household.
"No you can not Otiz" said Tom to the now pouting hybrid, "it's something that me and Severus need to tell Hadrian as it's a two part present"
Once Harry had stepped foot into the castle it self he changed back into his teenage form and picked him up bridal style and headed straight to the Slytherin common room.
Charlie- Chuck
"Boys please this is getting us no where" smiled Filius to them, making them blush slightly and with that Otiz changed back.
He was caught by none other than Draco and Lucius, both were trying not to laugh at him and all Harry said was "I hate Floo travel" this made everyone laugh.
"Greater good my ass" mumbled Harry to himself in the common room only for a pair of shoes to come into view has he was watching the fire burning gently in front of him and didn't notice anyone come into the quite room, he was left alone to think as it was the weekend and everyone besides a few first years had headed out.
They went around the whole resort! The whole freakin' resort! Yes Harry wanted to see where everything was, even though they took a freakin' map for it all Harry had wanted too see it all first and not from the map!
"If he's giving him chocolates he should be fine" said Harry making the group laugh ing as they had a feeling Tom would use that, they had all seen Severus eat a lot of chocolate when he was down or just in the mood and thought no one was watching him.
Nodding Madam Malkin went to work while the three looked around in the Muggle clothing area, it was limited but at least they could get something different then just robes.
"Wow!" they both said making Severus chuckle.
Stepping out of the classroom and into the hallway after he had cleaned up the room he notice Harry walking towards the Headmasters office, as this was Severus' free period he called out to his son.
They all hoped that they would see this side of the man more, Harry on the other hand they were just happy to see him fully enjoying himself like any normal child would regardless of their up bringing, yes he had one of the worst but seeing him acting like the other boys and Tonks they were happy.
🌸Fireworks
"Snape!" sneered Ron towards his ex Potions professor, it was a sneer that Severus would be proud of if he hadn't bullied his son.
They made him do House Elf work, treated him least than an House Elf to be the better term really, they raped him, broke his bones, he was locked in a bloody cupboard under the stairs for ten years, there is so much more but you don't need to know that.
"Yes very unpleasant young lady if I do say myself Remus, if I do say so myself".
.....
Severus wondered if he would be ok with the Knight bus as it was kind of like a normal but except it was invisible and could travel so fast you could barely blink and it would be off, he was an ace at riding a broom so why everything else did he have a problem with he would never know.
Yes we have the health scan which was done by the Goblins but it would also be helpful if we had the memories to match with them.
Draco and Harry had decided to play chess mind you Harry was awful at it but he was slowly getting better, he held onto his wolf for comfort but he too was slowly falling asleep.
Sirius Orion Black (alive, Azkaban) Alice Sarah Longbottom (insane, St. Mungo's) Frank Augusta Longbottom (insane, St. Mungo's) Lucius Abraxas Malfoy (alive, through adoption), Narcissa Aquila Malfoy nee Black (alive, through adoption), Molly Nicola Weasley nee Prewett (alive) and Arthur Septimus Weasely (alive)
Without saying anything Severus picked up a box and tapped it with his wand, the placed the box back on the shelf.
She never wanted something like this to happen to anyone but due to what she had read in his case file after he was placed in his new family, she being one of them that had altered many a memory to make him fit in.
"Ok Otiz ok, Hadrian pick out anything else and then we will head to the children's section for Otiz and then collect more toys".
As I asked in a previous chapter on Wattpad for a new name for Ron and any siblings and I have come up with his new name as well as his new family.
"You three my office now!! Hadrian can you stand??" he said to all of them.
Sumire 🌸
"With Lu-Lu and Tommy!" and he spun around and giggled as the three walked out of the Hall and onto their second lesson.
Blocks:
Otiz transformed back and was now in his teenage form.
"There is always a blip in the road, the good comes with the bad it seems" said Remus getting up whacking Sirius with his book on his head and smiled slightly.
"Will someone please tell me what is going on and why is young Mister Snape's familiar angry?" he looked at everyone in the room with his trademark glare.
The three adults all look to him like he was stupid while Harry whimpered at the noise and angry that first came of Lucius and then Draco, ".........I want to go home" was all he said making Severus look at him and sighed.
"Dad I think something went wrong, when I put my glasses on I can't see a thing do you think I could get a new pair?" asked Harry to his father as he took off the spell which was keeping his food warm.
"It will be alright do you want me to get your father to go with you?" asked Filius only to gain a nod from the distraught boy.
"Sev I'm really sorry, I was insensitive and stupid can you ever forgive me?" he looked into watery onyx eyes, his dark blue eyes looking into them.
Tom beamed brightly, Fawkes trilled happily that his master was happy, his feathers glowed and slightly sparked but nothing caught fire and Tom just stroked the feathers making Fawkes trill more and more.
"What cans Grippy helps with?" he asked nervously twisting this pillow case in his hands a nervous habit he had picked up just recently.
They walked in silence towards the hospital wing and when Draco opened the door they were both welcomed by the matron of the wing Madam Pomfrey.
"Ah refreshments at last" said Lucius as a house elf popped in with the drinks and said to them that dinner will be ready in half an hour.
Sitting down the House Elves provided her with some lukewarm soup a piece of crusty bread and a glass of water.
A door slowly formed out of the stone wall and opened to reveal my private quarters, I stepped back to allow Harry to walk in first. Harry looked around in amazement, he is so much like Lilly at the moment, their eyes the same, there were books everywhere, the walls were a dark green, there was a black leather sofa covered with papers, I should really clean up I then started to walk towards a room with a closed door, Harry stayed put.
"Bancroft Kenelm Harrington" and he too sat down, he so didn't want to be there as his client had threatened him and his family that if he didn't help he would loose his family, his twins!
Otiz curled around him and was soon asleep, Poppy kicked out the two adults and Draco stating that the poor boy needed rest and that he would be back in time for breakfast the following morning.
"Otiz... stop or I will send you back to dad where you will be put into time out either in animal, child or teenage form.." said Harry harshly making his familiar stop altogether.
Otiz wasn't really helping either as he was also stuck to Severus like glue all in the name to protect Harry from what had happened in the Great Hall.
The blood dripped onto the first parchment and slowly it flowed as writing appeared showing a full birth certificate which along had his grandparents, godparents and god siblings which didn't surprise anyone really as they knew who would be on it what caught their attention was what he was Lord and Heir, he had fourteen in total!
"...will..."
"....as I was saying he needs to be at his relatives he will be well protected against Voldermort, he saved the Wizarding world when he was just a baby and I know he will be able to do it once again.
Fred- Fed
"Draco Lucius Malfoy you will stop this petty childish behaviour now or so help me" sneered his father making both Draco and Harry jump in their seats. Draco hung his head and sighed while Harry turned his head into Severus more and gripped tightly onto his robes still crying.
"...is..."
You will help me with the house work as well as the garden, me and your brothers as well as your father will not speak to you and if we do we only want a yes form you. Your room will be stripped of everything besides your clothes and bed.
When dad.... when dad found me during the summer holidays... was when I was almost killed by my uncle, didn't want me to be there anymore and so took it upon himself to beat me within an inch of my life.
"That Hadrian was some impressive magic, I have been trying to break them now for over two hours but they were budging one bit, that silencing and locking charm worked so well in fact that I think we will have to talk about that more at a later date but for now...
"Thank you for that, its been really helpful" and she turned to leave but was stopped by the second year saying "it needs to stop, it isnt fair for everyone else who does the work like we are meant to. She's been getting away with it for far too long!"
On the way there Harry started to heat up, hotter and hotter and then he just bursts into flames, Otiz did the only thing he could think off really, he dropped Harry onto the floor.
"So Potter. Severus wanted me to come and talk to you about what's happened" said Draco but Harry said nothing to him only hummed.
It was all his fault that Harry wasn't back with the Gryffindor's, the Headmaster as well as his relatives! Harry should of been back where he belonged but she didn't want anything to happen to her like it did with Ginny being treated as a Squib and Ron now with the Ministry not knowing his fate was killing her.
First it was memory from the age of three, his uncle burning his arm on the stove and then thrown out of the house in the dead of winter.
Blind Trust keyed to Albus Dumbledore, Weasely family (80% broken), Light families, Hermione Jean Granger, Rubeus Hagrid, teachers at Hogwarts (broken)
"We are just gathering evidence to help you get away from your relatives and Dumbledore, by doing this it will help" said Narcissa who ruffled his hair slightly.
Bill and Charlie looked a tad scary with Bill with his long hair and dragon tooth necklace and three claw marks across his face and Charlie with his weather beaten face calluses and blisters all over his hands which didn't seem to bother him that much at all.
As the two headed out, Tom called out to then "just don't get caught, I don't want to have to hide a scandal as well as all this paperwork!"
"Yes Headmaster my son Hadrian's familiar can take human form we only found out over the summer however, we didn't think he would change here at Hogwarts" said Severus who was trying by failing to hold onto the little boy.
.........
All four of them along with Lucius walked over to Ron who was now wondering why he felt strange, he looked to his parents wondering why they were their then to his sister who looked sullen and withdrawn.
Ron and Hermione looked towards Harry and Otiz and cringed at him, not liking how he was looking at them.
Nahuatl or Nath, meaning  Fire Serpent- phoenix and basalisk
Logan Alexander Anderson neé O'Hara, 63 years old, black hair and deep blue eyes, Ben's father; an older version of his son. A retired carpenter and blacksmith, he took his wife's last name. AKA Alex
...........
Once they had entered the boy darted out and headed to his room that was always there and locked the door even before Otiz had time to comprehend what was happening.
I would of cast it if I knew where Narcissa would send us through the Floo but sadly I did not so I had no time to cast it" and he got up only for Otiz to transform.
I comforted him but from what I can recall Otiz noticed Hadrian's distress and so decided to transform but I'm not sure you'll have to ask Otiz about that more" said Severus to the Malfoy family.
As of late Harry had been feeling that he and someone watching him all the time which was kind of unnerving but as Otiz hadn't kicked up a stink he knew that person wouldn't of harmed him right?
"Miss Granger what can I do for you? You are meant to be in class right about now, Charms I think" said Tom catching the girl mid password.
"Draco please sit down and we will tell you everything that we know and hopefully you'll understand why Harry here is now Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, he is no longer Harry Potter as of two months ago" sneered Severus making the blond boy sit down without a word leaving his lip, while Harry was placed on Severus' knee so then he could cuddle into the warmth that his father gave him
"Snivellus! Of all people it had to be Snivellus Snape!" said Sirius as he paced the room trying to work out how he was going to get his godson back from the slimy snake  (I'm sorry sevvy)
"Remus what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?" asked Tom as he put down his quill for a much needed rest, it wasn't even lunch and he was going crazy with the paperwork!
"You idiot I told you not to do something like this but you still did!" screamed the gentle man who loved his chocolate.
"...don't..."
"He then started to tell me and Professor Lupin what the was supposedly told by Hadrian's relatives that what he had been through over the past eleven years were just accidental mishaps but both is us, Professor Lupin and I knew he was lying, this was all after Hadrian and Otiz had left of course.
"What the hell?" screamed Draco making Harry flinch, "sorry Hadrian I didn't mean to make you jump" said Draco more quietly.
As they were eating slowly they heard small crunching sounds coming from Draco's plate so they looked down what they saw shocked them.
Colin Creevey sighed more than anyone as it was him, the poor boy, that she had been shouting at trying to make him help her by booting out Tom.
"Weasley soon to be Mrs Harry James Potter" and she stuck her nose up in the air.
"Ron just leave them we are in enough trouble as it is" said Hermione as she tried to get around the six others who were heading into the classroom, everyone in the hall was watching, waiting to know what would happen next.
Parents:
"Not a chance Potter" said Ron not noticing everyone there, mostly the teachers.
"...the fuzz..."
Harry whimpered slightly cutting off what ever Marcus was going to say and mumbled just loud enough to hear "it's not Harry Potter anymore it's Hadrian Snape..."
"We will make sure that you are fine throughout it all" said Minerva.
Potions:
"...let's say that on November 16th at 10am a court case was held, I will not tell you anything that has happened but I will say this that Headmaster Dumbledore has been put into house arrest.." everyone gasped besides the ones that knew what happened.
George Fabian Weasely
"...came to...
"Mister Weasley if I was you I would kindly shut up, you as well as your sister and Miss Granger there are in enough trouble as it is. You still have your case to go as well and this statement has just been added to it" and he fixed Ron with an icey glare.
Lucius looked at the boy in awe he had never seen Otiz like this, he looked like a blue haired green eyed Severus when he was a teenager.
He crept upstairs after doing a "point me" spell which lead to a small, small bedroom, the last door which had many, many different locks on the outside of it with another "Alohomora" each one was undone.
"Minerva please look after him for me, I know you will be the aunt in his life that he should of had" and with that he left.
"Hadrian you're a star! Thank you, thank you for that! What is his favourite chocolate?" Tom was way to eager to get out of Severus' bad books all he needed was his favourite chocolate and a nice date night idea, which he knew he loved certain types of movies so it looked like it was goigntno be a romantic evening in Severus' chambers.
Adoption Certificate:
HJSS- Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape
"Lord and Lady Malfoy, Heir Malfoy, Lord Prince and young Heir Prince please follow me to my office everyone else has arrived" and he got down from his chair and ushered them into a back room.
......
"...we just..."
Three quarters of the way through class, most of the class gasp at this seeing only him transforming back and forth from one form to the other they had never seen a half transformation before.
"My name is Ron! Ron Weasley! My name isn't Max!" he shouted at her making her sigh, it was the same conversation every morning with him besides the one that was "I'm a wizard! Magic is real! I'm not crazy I know magic!"
Everyone looked at her teachers including, Harry kind of stiffened at this and wanted to cry but with Draco, Blaise and Pansy he kept his cool.
"Listen here beaver you should at least say sorry for knocking someone over, especially someone who has just come out of the hospital wing" again he snarled but Hermione just ignored him.
"I didn't do anything, this stupid thing somehow ended up in my hair!" she screamed to the dwarf professor.
Everyone in close proximity moved away from him and then started to completely ignore him, shunning him as they did. They didn't want to be anywhere near him!
It appears to me that if out esteemed Headmaster doesn't get it thought his thick lemon sherbet sucking head and admit that Hadrian is now my son, through adoption then I will have to go even further and do a blood adoption just to keep the poor boy away from them" finally he sighed.
"Tom Tom!" he was bouncing up and down like crazy, like he had eaten a month's worth of sugar (A/N please don't do that people you'll just end up I'll)
"I'm not crazy!" was all Ron said to them still standing in the doorway, he didn't know these people, so why should he do anything that they wanted.
"Ok everyone we can look he's closed his inner eye lids we are fine to look at him" said Tom going to check everything of the now basilisk Harry.
Both parents sighed but the girls just laughed harder making their father look at them saying "Jessica, Rebecca be nice ok your little brother just needs to see his psychiatrist again, that's all".
He re read everything again to make sure he was getting this right.
"Tev sowwy" and he went over and hugged the man's legs, said man looked down at the child and sighed.
Ginny tried to move away from her parents as she was stuck sitting on the bench listening to them but every time she moved she knew she would get into trouble, she wasn't allowed to speak to anyone and could only have the bare minimum to eat and her clothes were now an awful shade of grey which she hated.
"Every good now onto the blood adoption, you do understand that with that he will no longer have the blood of the Potters or the Evans line within his system. He will still get his all of inheritance from his birth parents but he will be forever Heir Prince but on the records he will be a Snape. Is this truly what you want?" the last part was namely directed towards Harry who again shifted.
"I can understand this is also a shock to you as well, as no one knew what was going to happen after I was called into Dumbledore's office and told to check on Hadrian here" there was a slight thump to his side and it looked like Harry was sleeping but he knew better than to sleep when this was happening.
He was out right crying at this point waking Draco up when he looked at the time after checking seeing that it was now one in the morning he got out of bed and sat in Harry's.
"But why is he being treat differently then the rest of us!" Ron almost screamed to her but she just put her hand up and said "be careful Mister Weasely I have it known that both you and Miss Granger there have already lost points and have gained detention due to what you have done to Mister Snape's arm at the moment. If you want again to lose points as well as earn another detention I would kindly remind you to sit back down and be quiet".
"So Maxie we heard you went nutters again saying that there was a World full of Witches and Wizards and that your name was Ron Weasley" said the twins laughing at him.
"Quite right sister it is, it was ok when he was little but this is going on boarder line crazy" said Jessie getting up with her sister as they had finished.
Everyone turned to the hybrid laying under the desk, mouth slightly open where the fire had generated from, they hoped, he then turned his head as to say 'I will know if something happens' and promptly fell asleep.
They headed over to the Floo, where Harry picked up Otiz who buried his head into his neck while Harry in fact buried his face into his fathers chest... he hated Flooing at the best of times but at least it was better than the alternative.
Harry shook in fear behind his father and silently cried.
"Thank you Theo that's really helped" and he smiled towards the boy.
"He's not James anymore, his hair is slightly messy but straight if you can believe it and his eyes are Lilly a beautiful shining emerald green. He's meek and shy but he is more likely than James in personality. Just to warn you he has a familiar which is very protective of him, he is two Japanese demon's in one, he looks like a large light blue fox really.
Severus noticed this right away and so pulled out copies of Harry's medical reports from both Poppy and St. Mungo's and placed them in Albus' desk once again but he didn't look at them so Remus took hold of them and read through them getting angrier and angrier.
~Might off, I had help~
Little did anyone know it was going to be one of the children's favourite rides out of the whole park, the adults waited down at the bottom while all ten children and a familiar went on the coaster, all you could hear as they came down were screeches of joy, or in Blaise, Draco and Percy a cry in fear and they just hoped that they wouldn't be ill afterwards.
"Follow me then young Heir Prince, I have to do the rest of you to all stay behind s if you join us in the Cleaning Hall you would contaminate everything which could possibly kill young Heir Prince" and with that Harry followed Griphook into a different room.
Severus sensed that something was up in the common room and so left his potion brewing and headed straight in the room and was tackled to the ground by his son.
When he saw nothing he wondered what happened and saw an angry Harry making him sigh, he nudged his elbow making Harry leave the room.
They had managed to get mostly everything from London that they wanted but it was the last Weasley's that he found hard but he knew Percy being Percy would like something with law as he wanted to work in the Ministry, he knew Charlie worked with dragons and so would get him something along those lines and Bill well he didn't know what to get.
A girl from Hufflepuff called Andie Owltwist who was in her fourth year now storked up to him and slapped him so hard he fell off the bench he was sitting on.
Severus got up and went to the spare room and knocked "Harry it's alright, it's just me. I'm not going to hurt you come on out" he said but he got no response from him and so he tried again, still nothing and so he slowly opened the door.
"Do you think uncle Sev will forgive him?" asked Draco to Harry who smiled at him.
Ooh Tommy is here!! Yay Tommy!!
Otiz finally looked at the company that they had and smiled towards them and walked up to Lucius.
Albus stared back he knew he was going to get caught but schooled his emotions and said "Severus my boy, I'm aware of this already. It is only safe that he is with fami-"
As you know if Otiz if isn't familiar with you, he will take a while to warm up to you and if he does he will lick your hand and once he deems you a friend. He bit Hadrian and so they are the familiars to each other, well the rest of us he had licked our hands, he has deemed us as friends and so he will protect us with everything he's got morso Hadrian".
I think with all of this you will be place in isolation where you will be given a child's quill and books so then you can do your school work, I will be in touch with the board of Governors to then they can get you a personal tutor that will only give you the bare minimum of help teaching you.
A chapter where Ron lives as a Muggle from now onwards
Don't let it worry you, ok I would rather have you like this, your calm self than the idiot that tried to attack my friend which I might add scared him senseless and with that I think you need to apologise to him if not I'm not talking to you for a week, plus no sweets and I can and I will restrict your raw meat supply".
"Ah yes I forgot to tell you that she was allowed to go to Hogsmeade today, how did it go? Her assignments have been improving and no cheating was involved so I thought a reward would be a good idea" smiled Tom only to be met by a shocked face of Minerva and a glare from Severus.
Harry hugged the now human Otiz who started to purr making his ears and tail pop out.
"...all..."
(See the end of the chapter for
~It isn't, no one said I could ask for help~
"Very well Madam Bones but please call me Tomas..." and he smiled at her, she nodded and he continued.
"Once rested we will do the blood adoption which will be just mixing our blood together in a goblet, a spell on the blood and then all you have to do it drink it. You will go through any changes through the night, nothing will hurt during then I promise you" .
Age 12:
"Yeah Harry come on let's go" said Ron grabbing Harry roughly by the elbow and pulled as hard as he could.
Severus asked more questions but Harry just looked back down at the floor and then he started to cry, Severus lifted his chin and as he did that Harry launched himself at him.
"If I had known I would of got him out of there. I would of saved him from what he has been through" Remus was angry and upset, this wasn't helping his wolf who was crying to be released.
"Otiz just marked you as someone he can trust, he's done that with everyone so far that he's met, me on the other hand he took a bit of my blood after I gave him his name" said Harry with a yawn, Otiz bounding over to him.
Blind hatred keyed to Severus Snape (broken), Malfoy family (broken) Slytherin House (partly broken), Goblin's (broken... AN thought it would be funny)
"Nothing but I have to go see Dumbledore after this and I'm worried about what he wants is all, do you think I can bring my da.... Professor Snape with me?" he caught himself before he said dad to them.
"Molly I think we leave Ginevra somewhere where she can't get into trouble and away from us for the two weeks but still here" said Arthur to his wife as he got up from the bench and grabbed hold of his once daughter and brought her to stuff members at the front of the theme park so then they could put her to work.
Harry leaned into him more and hummed slightly and snuggled into him almost dropping off to sleep, he had finished all his homework anyway so an early night might just be what was needed until Otiz came bounding back in an hour later carrying something in his mouth.
"'ello 'minoe w'at 'ring ya 'ere?" he asked knowing full well she wants to know who could of pulled the pranks happening within the school as he still had his elephant ears.
Broken bones, infections not treated, which could explain his overly bad eye sight even James Potter's eyesight wasn't that bad, malnourishment, dehydration, weak muscles, bruises, burns, cuts, grazes it continued like this up to the present date and how they weren't picked up by Poppy was beyond him.
"Hadrian I know I should of asked your permission to tell them but I would love for you to have them in your life, I would like them to be the go to people that I know that they are, also they were and still are your parents best friends, I don't want you to lose that.
Name: Harry James Potter
"Hadrian calm down for a few minutes, my stomach has to settle a bit more" said Draco who smiled weakly at his boyfriend but it didn't help calm Harry down much all he did was whine but stayed put for a moment until the others felt fine and they were off onto the next ride.
McGonagall set the hat upon his head and right away the hat started to speak to him
"Huh?!" said Harry as he looked towards his father, still slightly shocked.
Who thought it was Lucius you get a cookie from the SMOL bean known as Otiz!!
"...even with everything written in black and white you now know that everyone in this room won't speak of it and that each and everyone loves you" yes he was being sappy but if it helped the young boy out he would take it.
"...you..."
He passed over to the two of them and dropped something unceremoniously onto their laps, it was pure white but when Harry took it into his arms it gave off body heat and it smelt like lillie's of all things.
The next morning you could tell that they were walking on dead feet, their eyes had bags under them, they were not hyperactive and blubbery and they looked like they were in fact zombies.
"What are you three up to?" asked Harry who by now had finished his sandwich.
Otiz right away jumped up and hissed and then went to attack who ever it was but ran into the corner of the room only to yelp out in pain as he hit his head.
Making sure that no Muggles were around and said very slowly waving the wand in their faces..
In the hallway Harry was yet again confronted by the three.
"What in Merlin's name, why would they care, when I found the poor boy he was being to an inch of his life, if I hadn't of gone to him he would of been dead, so much for the greater good if the Saviour of the Wizarding World ended up dead!" yelled Severus making Harry flinch and held on tightly to his father.
"No I don't care! He has made the worse mistake! How could he take one of the greatest Wizards to court over nothing! I tell you that freak has lied about everything!
"Well this is my oldest Bill then Charlie with his girlfriend Nymphadora, you know everyone else" said Molly pointing to the three people Harry had never met before.
Otiz was climbing all over Sirius as he was tall and started pulling his hair to make him move to have a look around more which he happy obeyed they fox turn boy as it was him that had locked him into his Animagus form, they were soon whispering about what pranks to pull on everyone.
"Oh looks like the slimy snakes are bloody well here, why don't you all just sliver back where you bloody well come from and stay there for good, we don't need you here" said Ron making a shooing motion to make them leave.
"Miss Cruise I will say this now so then everyone here and hear what I have to say "I am his father now, I adopted him in August, after what I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life...." he was going to continue and say what had happened to poor Harry but he was cut off by crying.
You no longer have your magic, you will no longer be able to tap into it. You will remember everything about the Magical World, we are here to make sure that you will not be able to speak about the Magical World from now on" finished Severus as Tom and Poppy came closer to him.
"But what?"
Trelawney had purple hair and was muttering about how the world was going to end.
She walked right up to them, went round to the side of the table that Harry was sitting on and punched him right in his face breaking his nose in one fall swoop, blood was gushing out.
Everyone laughed at this but seeing Harry happy was still something that they had to get used to.
Everyone did as they were told including Otiz who's fur was now a bubble gum pink, "I would like each and everyone one of you to read the chapter about the Hystrifors charm and I would like an essay on it and then at the next lesson I would like you all to perform it. Points will be added for how well it turns out design wise that is".
...........
"Molly, Arthur welcome I see you brought everyone else but please introduce everyone if you don't mind" said Severus trying to get Otiz off the twins.
Malnutrition, dehydrated, burns to 70% of body, frost bite, lacerations to back and anus
Potter 687
Harry looked at Severus and Severus looked at Harry and then they both looked at the gifts sitting in their laps, both laughed at what they were doing and started opening their gifts.
"What are they doing here!" he practically screamed making Harry flinch and curl in on himself, this made Otiz come to his defense, his parents looked on at their son while Severus tried to calm Harry down.
".....just....... leave" was all he said trying to go back to his lunch.
"But don't you have papers to grade??"
Harry sat between Draco and Blaise while Pansy sat opposite them, the three of them speaking sure that nothing would happen to Harry while he was eating, even Marcus joined them at one point wondering if Harry would take up Quidditch at some point in time but he declined the offer.... for the moment at least.
He sighed quietly once, no sound could be heard from the outside of his door. Harry frantically got up, a little too quick, looking for his wand. The whole room was spinning from the little light of what he could see, he picked up his wand from under his pillow and cast a "Lumos". He looked at himself in the mirror, he had bags from no sleep, he had bruises everywhere and where he didn't his skin was deadly pale, he looked down right awful. He felt how tired he was from just standing so he gently took off his glasses and set them aside, with that he fell into a restless sleep.
"Dway!! Hi!" smiled the hyper little boy who was now sitting on Harry's lap.
He was clutching his head in pain and so rushed to him right away and without Albus even noticing Poppy had taking Severus to the Hospital Wing.
Otiz growled towards the man in the green this made the court flinch they thought he was just a boy someone to help Harry but one look at him fully they knew for a fact a familiar was present in the courtroom a familiar willing to protect willing to die.
"Cornelius let me explain it was all for the greater good, without Harry..." he was cut off by Tom and Fudge by saying "Hadrian".
"I'm not crazy! Magic is real! My name is Ron! Why am I hear in the first place? I want to go back to the Burrow! I want to go home!" he was making a scene in the hallway again but he couldn't remember.
Everyone in the hall looked as she left not saying a thing, it was a completely harmless prank s no one would really get told off, Otiz on the other hand fell off his seat laughing everyone ignored him and carried on eating.
"Oi give my coffee back fur ball!"
"I was called into the office during lunch as you know and when Hadrian didn't turn up the Headmaster flipped out asking where he was and I told him that his named had changed and Potter doesn't exist, then he told me to go and get Hadrian".
In the office he made everyone sit down and then noticed that Harry was missing, he looked at everyone and then stared at Draco again.
Otiz growled again only to make Tyki attack again bashing them with his wings over their heads, his claws scratching them and his beak biting their skin.
Birth Certificate
"How can you do that to your own brother! He's done nothing to you two!!" she jabbed her finger to them "he never has done anything! He wants his friend back!" she yelled again to them.
The rest of the Weasely boys were planning on keeping an eye on their younger siblings or playing some pranks; namely the twins of course.
"Hadwin wook, weets, Otiz have dum?"
Lucius and Narcissa looked at their son knowing that he had a lot of thinking to do on his part and hopefully both of the boys would try and form some sort of friendship as the school year continued.
She waved the child's wand and said the spell, Luna's shoes moved ever so slightly but they stayed where they were.
"Ah Mrs. Weasely what can I do for you today?" she asked ignoring Ginny, "well I need some new robes for the twins they've jet again Merlin knows what on them again, it's easier to get some new ones that try and fix them" laughing.
((I wanted Severus to have a bird that would suit him and I think a raven would be awesome, name comes from D.Grey-Man))
It never occurred to him that the boy was suffering, that had always been told that he was treated like a Prince but this now was a hundred percent a lie!
Hermione came round a few hours later and woke up to Poppy bustling around the room, she was attending to a few first years that had blown up a potion, a fifth year who had somehow fallen off their broom and broken their leg all the while she was ignored.
Lord and Heirships
Draco got up and lead them outside and back to the castle.
Age 5:
............
"Luna Lovegood" and she went off to stare at something that wasn't there.
"Miss Granger I have checked these items and each and every item has your particular magical signature all over them, so I would like the truth!"
"Severus is pressing charges and so are a number of families due to what she has done, where have you put her wand?"
"Hadrian what have you been up to?" asked Tom to his soon to be soon if everything worked out right.
"What was that password anyway it sounds ridiculous if you ask me" she said sitting down without being asked to.
Beast Speak (100% blocked)
Arthur- a radio and yes Harry was going to teach him how to use it!!
"Well our little Ronnikins and baby girl are going to have some secrets told that they don't want people to know about sadly" said George.
"Insolent disgusting Muggle you've made me lose the Saviour of the Wizarding world he was in that place so then he could learn his rightful place he was beaten by them so then he knew what pain and misery felt like so then he could get Voldermort and destroy the bastard when he came back for power!
He tried to move only to have something..... or someone groan at him from his side, looking down he could see a mop of dark hair sticking up from underneath his deep dark covers of his bed, he smiled at the child who was holding onto him for dear life.
"...like..."
"You sir may be my mother's cousin but you are nothing to me or to Hadrian, we don't trust you, come in guys let's get out of here I think uncle Sev might want to know about this" soon they left with the Whomping Willow only for Severus to come up to them asking if they were alright.
"....yes thank you Mr. Zabini for that. Now as I was saying we will be spending a fortnight there and Lucius knowing him has already booked my events for all of us to go and see when we are there"
He looked like a freakin' Ravenclaw! He wasn't some stinking Ravenclaw he was a Gryffindor through and through why should he have to wear these of all things!?
Harry held the stuffie tightly and within no time he was sleeping, Severus brought him to his room, followed by Otiz of course and then went to bed he knew tomorrow was going to be a bad day for his son but with the older Weasely's, Otiz and himself protecting him along with is new friends he should be alright.
Percy had been reading next to Bill, Charlie and Dora had gone to look at other stalls as they didn't want to sit around on this fine day waiting for everyone to make up their minds on where they were going to go next.
Harry had managed to get to charms on time and he sat between Theo and Draco, Coco uncurled herself and sat on Otiz as they silently conversed about what had happened and she wasn't happy with Hermione.
"SHUT UP REMUS" said Sirius once he had stopped.
As this was going on no one noticed two identical red heads at the back watching the whole thing.
"I know you are but your being over protective!"
Everyone looked at him as he flew passed them on the ride.
But today was different Severus had made sure that most of his potions were done so he could spend time with his son, but he had picked London of all places to go to why not Diagon Alley but his father had said no to that one.
Harry looked over to see all black coming towards them and he shyly smiled at him, the others not seeing who was coming up behind them.
They all say down and talked and once lunch was called they all headed over the the dinning room where lunch was waiting for them.
So that's Ron out for good, yes he will be going to a Muggle school after he has been placed into a Muggle family who will have their memories altered into believing he is their son. He will remember everything sadly which is also a punishment in its self.
Harry's magic reacted to Otiz's wish and magic started to swirl around all three of them but mostly around Harry.
A few of the students came to Harry's rescue while others stayed and others went to get some teachers.
"The reason why I'm like this this is because I am exactly one year older than Hadrian here, he is thirteen while I'm fourteen but I am still classed as a baby from where I come from and what I am.
They walked the other three to Transfiguration class and walking in Minerva was sitting on her desk in her Animagus form which was also green.
"What my godson is now Snivellus' son why in Merlin's name was he allowed to do something like that, I'll kill him!"
Quietly the hospital doors opened to reveal two red heads and a bushy brown head, they all peeked in looking for someone they knew to be there. It was lunch time anyway and they could always say that they were just visiting no harm in that right??
"Mine" said the Occamy to everyone letting Severus hear her.
Tom Riddle stood up and introduced himself, he looked like nothing like he used too, for one he looked to be in his late forties early fifties, his hair was a a soft dark brown almost black with some specks of grey and his dark eyes glowed with life.
Out stepped his Uncle Severus holding onto a small boy with unruly black hair, Draco's mouth almost fell off due to the surprise that his Uncle Severus' son was none other than Harry Freakin James Potter!!

The next parchment will access your vaults and I will need another five drops and then the final parchment I will need a total of seven drops and this will bring out any health problems from when you were born up until now as well as any blocks, potions and or spells within your system.
"..........................They have been released from prison, they are now back home and are waiting for you to return to them for the holidays" said Albus but by this time Harry was in a full blown panic attack, Severus was by his side in a flash.
He is now under the name of Hardian Jameson Severus Snape, he is my son while Mister Malfoy here is his god brother as his parents are his godparents now..." he was cut off my Minerva saying "what about Black or the Longbottom's?"
"Harry my love come to me right now, we are meant to be together forever, it has been set in motion since we were born" said Ginny to him.
In the Slytherin common room Otiz was in a foul mood and even Harry couldn't get him out of it, he knew something was going to happen to the girl and he wanted every part of it.
Otiz had hit him on the nose with his toy snake not meaning to "sowwy".
And so she went and sat back down huffing loudly making Luna stopped reading and looked up to her.
With that all three of them left.
Otiz came back into the room twenty minutes later looking confused.
(See the end of the chapter for
An house elf that was assigned to her that day popped in.
Harry was sitting at the Slytherin table with his friends and one highly amused human Otiz, he had been playing and had pranked the twins, they now sported Slytherin green hair and a match of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff robes, no where was there Gryffindor, everyone knew it was him but said nothing as they were all laughing including Percy.
"I love you too Otiz, we both do".
"Do you think it's his way to cheer me up?" asked Harry, Severus smiled towards him and then hugged his son tightly and nodded.
Your wand will be with me or your father at all times, you will not be allowed to use magic you will act as if you are a Squib. Do I make myself clear if I do hand over your wand and head upstairs to your room.
She will and I hate to admit this will follow through with all threats given to her children if they don't listen to her" and he hugged his son close to him, stroking fluffy soft hair.
"This will be boring" said Blaise but he knew it was just the start and didn't want to take much away from Harry and soon all the children were on the ride.
In the living room Severus was talking to Otiz who was sitting in Harry's chair while Severus sat in his.
Otiz had fallen asleep waiting while they talked and so Harry took his wand out and performed the spell on the Porcupine still on his desk hiss-tree-fors and standing on his desk was a intricate pin cushion complete with pins what had lightening bolts, bats and foxes all over them.
He is always seen with Harry and will do anything for him, he has made great friends with Draco and Blaise. He sees Severus as his father and Remus as his uncle who he calls Wolfie *laugh*
Ron stood up and shouted to him "that freak over there next to that ferret took him to court for nothing! He should be back where he belongs! With us Gryffindor's and with his loving relatives!
He was interrupted by Severus saying "Albus how dare you! He has had way to many near death experiences just in the past two years from his uncle's beatings alone! If you won't take him out of that damn household I will remove him myself. I'm not bluffing. Good evening" and he was gone.
Grandparents: Mr and Mrs Evans, Fleamont Potter and Euphemia Potter
"Oh I have to go and look at Gladrags" said Pansy as she tried to drag Draco off only for Otiz to growl at her.
You are not allowed out of your room unless called for, you are not alowed out of this house unless I am with you, you will not be allowed to talk to any of your friends if they send an owl I will be the one to reply to them.
Otiz called curled up on Narcissa's lap purring away due to being scratched behind his ears. "Hadrian when did you find this beauty, I have never seen anything like him before" she said.
"I'll get Hadrian could you wait at the entrance to his office for me?" asked Severus as he placed Otiz's head on his shoulder and carried him to the Dungeons.
HE HAS DONE NOTHING FOR YOU TO DO THIS TO HIM, ALL HE WANTS IS A FAMILY AND AFTER WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE READ FROM THE REPORTS THAT WE WERE ALLOWED TO READ, WITH PERMISSION I MIGHT ADD, I WOULD THINK BETTER ABOUT WHAT YOU TWO ARE DOING TO THE POOR BOY!
"Make it so that your youngest son and Miss Granger's parents know what they have been doing for the past eighteen months" said Minerva how was now nursing a cup of tea while Severus had coffee.
I walk towards the Headmaster's office and say the stupid password, why does it have to be those blasted sweets he always eats "Lemon Drops" and I head up to the office.
Sixth memory from the age of eight, Petunia burning his back with a frying pan he was cooking with.
"You young man will come to my office after lunch where I can find out who you are" and with that said he headed back to the staff table.
Not mentioning what you did to Mr Snape when he was trying to help Miss Lovegood when he was trying to get her shoes down from a torch, before you say anything about that she came to me and gave me the memory.
Lastly Severus left the last final seven drops of blood land on the last parchement, this one he was dreading he knew what he had seen when he had rescued him at the beginning of summer but he really didn't want to see what else those... those.. monsters had put the poor boy through.
"Severus my boy please understand they are his relatives they can look after him, he must of hurt himself some how, it's quite normal for a young man such as Harry to hurt himself now and again, I bet he was just over reacting, weren't you my boy?" Albus redirected his sentence to the hidden boy.
Thank you Otiz, don't worry about her the Nargles are just confusing her, she might change if she is able to clear them"said Luna putting her shoes back on.
Severus pointed to a bowl next to his chair which had raw met in it for him and so his attention was on that more than showing everyone his fur.
"Oh Hadrian it's going to be ok, with me and aunts Poppy, Pamona, Narcissa, Molly as well as uncle's Filius, Arthur and Lucius you will be alright.
After what I have learnt about the two youngest I don't think that would be the right environment for him but on the other hand having five older brothers on hand might make it much better.
"Well done Otiz but I want to ask you a question is that ok with you?"
I know people, I know but with the other stories I liked either Harrison or Hadrian for his new name but he will still be called Harry either way. I was thinking of taking James out of his name but I thought against it so I just edited his name instead.
Sorry if this upset anyone it hurt me to write it but sadly it needed to be done
"Draco one of the guests is none other than Severus, he is bringing his son to visit us as he would like us to be his god parents. I will say this now my Dragon that his son had been abused and that he is now very shy and would appear to have some problems with dealing with this all"
"Headmaster please calm yourself, they are nothing but children, I would like to know what is going on and why you have asked everyone to gathere here?" and he sat down after conjuring a chair to sit in, Hadrian on his lap.
As they were walking to the zoo, yes Harry had wanted to go back to the zoo even after what had happened last time, letting the snake loose by accident. What it's called accidental magic for a reason!
"No Tev! Bweakfast! Hungwy!" shouted Otiz to the man but one look given by Harry as he came into the room had the boy scampering off the table like he had a Firebolt attached to him.
"Why thank you Mister Nott, I have been well, daddy has wrote an article about Hadrian and how young Weasley has been cast out of the magical world.. do you where he went?"
With a grumble Hermione got up and sneered at him, "I will be talking to my parents about getting Professor Dumbledore back in his rightful place and get you out Sötétség, you are not the rightful Headmaster here, Dumbledore is!" and she left.
His godparents are Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy but I would be quite happy to have you as his godparents as well but I'm worried that might not be able to work as of yet.
He was brought out of his when he heard Harry laughing he was being licked but the cat... no kitten by the looks of it all but it was huge!! but when he looked again it was neatly tucked into Harry's arms sleeping.
"I don't need anything else I thought we were just getting Otiz some toy's?" asked Harry looking at his father shocked.
She looked at her wand and cast a Tempus charm and saw that she only had another fifteen minutes before end of class for the day.
~yep. I'll leave Sevvy, Lu-Lu and Tommy alone if you let me do this~
"Well took you long enough, been here for what forty five minutes after I had knocked out the Weasel, got no thanks for that by the way..." and he shook his head and his ears went away.
As in his child form Otiz is very bubbly and fun and easygoing as a teenager he resembles Severus, long blue hair and he looks like he has a bored expression on his face all the time, but he's very ferocious when he's angry so I would watch what you say around him, if I were you Black".
He was shocked and so stepped closer and said " Harry is quite alright. Do you know who I am?"
Next they headed over to the building sets where Otiz picked out building blocks, a train set and a castle stating and I quote:
"Um... yeah... ok" he gulped to Remus as the three got onto the ride and where soon strapped into it.
The tenth and final memory was Harry contracting pneumonia, being staved form the time he came home to Severus picking him up.
At her detention with Filius, he was trying and failing to teach her the Freezing charm but she kept going on and on about Tom being Headmaster and not Dumbledore and what ever he said he was screamed back at by her.
Harry was a shell of himself and both of them knew it, he didn't want anything but someone to keep him from harm more than anything else in the world, he wanted to be hugged tightly but at the same time he hated to be touched, he wanted to gorge himself in food but he had tried that once before and ended up throwing up all over the place, his stomach not used to that much food.
"Sirius Orion Black don't even thing about that do you want to go back to Azkaban?! After all I've done for you to keep your sorry arse out of it" said Tom making his eyes flash red for a moment.
'caw caw'
"It's a young Occamy a rare colouring if I say so myself normally they are turquoise not a blue" said Tom getting up to have a look at it more.
I know their youngest two have been bullies to you but from what I know from what Mrs Weasely is like from her oldest children she is a force to be reckoned with.
Once settled in bed Harry just kept looking around not wanting to sleep but he was so tired he couldn't keep his eyes opened but he was forcing himself more than anything.
"That's fine Draco", soon all four were up in the air playing they were being watched over by Severus and Harry's house elves Boris, Mink and Yahtzee as Narcissa and Lucius were working, Otiz was curled up under the table where their snacks were waiting for them.
Who cares that the spoilt brat was now adopted by his stupid depressing dungeon dweller of Hogwarts, it meant nothing to him! He would get the brat back sooner or later. It was only a matter of time!
"Yes that correct..... I'm sorry dear what was your name again?" she asked him.
"What was that about?" asked Fred and George together being slightly too loud waking Harry up.
Lupin looked on he never knew that the boy they had once called Sniverllus back at school could be so caring to his cub, this made him smile it looked like Harry was in good hands but he could smell an underlying bitter smell if he could call it that.
"Oh stop staring will you" sneered Otiz as he headed toward the Slytherin table and placed Harry gently on the bench and sat down next to him.
"Harry I thought I only asked for you to come to my office, why did you bring Professor Snape with you?" asked Albus to the quiet boy standing next to his father.
"Ok so me and Theo against you and Blaise, Hadrian if that's ok with you?"
Please can you do that for me?" Severus tried to get his son to choose something and when he put his down on the floor twin emerald green eyes with black specks in the shone up to him, tears in his eyes.
She then rounded on Harry and his friends who were looking at her in turn wondering what was going to happen next.
"Ok now that you have something let's get Otiz sorted" laughed the man who was now holding a sleeping Otiz in his arms.
Griphook looked on, keeping a close eye on how the two were acting towards each other and then smiled a wolfish smile he knew he was going to have some fun information thrown at him during this talk.
"Well Harry we are taking you along with the Malfoy's, Remus, Sirius, Bella, Rodolphus and Rebastain and the Weasley's not including the two youngest I might add, their youngest son is no longer apart of the magical world and their daughter will be brought here to be taught more by the house elves as she is now a slave...."
"Can I hold him please, it's been so long since a child has been here that young" said Narcissa to them only for Harry to nod to her and let his father place the now out cold child in her arms.
"Severus who is this little boy anyway, he can't be your son, last time I checked you had no other family" said Lupin to the black haired man.
No one understood why Severus' raven had followed Harry to the station of all things he normally stayed with Severus for the trip he hated being left behind at the school.
"I was asked by Albus to check on Hadrian, I found him locked in his room barely breathing he had many broken bones, a collapsed lung, he was dehydrated and malnourished, I've only just managed to get him to eat about half of what he should eat.
"Don't even think about laughing you three" said Lucius to Tom, Severus and Remus but it was too late all the staff were laughing at the poor blond.
As she worked she started humming a Muggle tune that she always hummed when she was deep in concentration, her dorm mates found it weird and rather annoying that she did that but no matter how many times they told her to stop she would always start back up again!
"Oh Merlin really dad you didn't tell me that Malfoy was here, is this the reason why you came and got me in the first place?" he asked while Severus headed towards the kitchen to get them something to drink, acting like he didn't know what he was talking about, so Harry went and sat down in what he had claimed as 'his spot', a light brown chair that had a Gryffindor blanket and cushion on it as well as two stuffed owls, a white one and a black one.
Bill is Bill
"Listen I didn't mean to honest to Merlin I didn't mean to honest! I just wanted to get the one that sold your parents out to the man who killed them".
Emrys 10
"Ok Mister Weasely I would like you to hand over ALL of your quills so then I can keep them and you will serve detention with Flitch as well as Professor Flitwick and Sprout, during your classes you will be sitting at the teacher's desks so then they can keep an eye on you!
"That hurt!" she said getting up and trying to dust herself off from the forest floor which did really nothing as she still looked like a mess.
"Or maybe a bottle for the nap?" said Phineas Black and everyone laughed at the two headmasters commenting on Albus.
"Dray why did they leave us? What are they up to?" asked Harry as he watched their friends meet up with others to do their own thing.
This made Draco blush, noticing the time he suggested that they would get something to eat for lunch, both thanking that they had more money on them than needed.
The staff where really helpful and one member bought me these but as you can see Otiz has claimed them as his own" and he pointed to the small boy.
Dinner went well but Harry wasn't up to eating much food as this was too much for him to handle and way too complicated to try and figure it out what the hell he was eating.
He stormed away and out of the Shrieking Shack only to have him brought back in my Otiz in human form, sit and listen to each other!"
"I was thinking we could do our Christmas shopping today, get t over and done with, no before the whole Yule rush" said Severus putting down his cup of coffee, Harry only nodded having his mouth full.
"Fine I'll let everything go and make peace but if he doesn't then you owe me some sugar quills" said Harry as he got off his bed and pulled on a XXL baggy hoodie as he headed towards the door.
Sirius had stayed with Remus as he changed back slowly into his human form.
"I'm going, I'm going" said Harry as Severus pushed him towards the bathroom, Harry was ready within the lotted time frame.
"Well I'm waiting Miss Granger?" said Minvera to her.
"Mister Malfoy where is Mister Potter? I asked for all you to come to my office, why isn't he here as well?".
Remus was sitting at the end of the table next to Severus who was ignoring everyone besides watching his son interact with his friends.
"Can't......can't choose" was all he said to him.
The wolf stayed put in Harry's lap and didn't want to move, Otiz wasn't too happy about this new pup on his familiar but it was just a stuffed animal of sorts, he wasn't sure.
Thank Merlin for Draco and his friends... or should he now say friends as since then they have helped him in calming him down and homework, plus they always stuck with him with everything he did.
"Now that we are all here, let us get down to business" said Lucius as he picked up a cup of coffee that was brought in by a House Elf, he gestured to everyone to help themselves to the refreshments, everyone in turn took a drink but Harry.
"Get out!" screamed Harry to him, to Albus of all things, this made Otiz go on to attack and there now standing on the floor was a fox that was twice the size of a normal fox, his blue fur so dark now it was like the night sky, his emerald eyes glowed dangerously and he had something like steam coming from his mouth and right away he threw Albus to the floo and right away the Headmaster was now gone.
Everyone was shocked at what Harry had inherited from his family, he had to be the richest Wizard in the world, but Griphook noticed something wrong with his accounts but he thought he would bring that up at another time as they were here for the blood adoption first then they would get back what was owned by the young Lord and Heir.
"Draco this is Otiz don't you remember him?" asked Harry as they all followed Lucius to the living room.
With a look of disgust Harry looked at him with a glare that just made him smile more "eat that Harry and then it's time for class" so Severus went back to the staff table.
"Hadwin no chase?" said boy climbed up onto Harry's lap and curled in.
Older sister- Rebecca Skye Anderson, 15 years old, black hair and honey coloured eyes. She is Ron's new older sister and twin sister of Jessica. Sporty and out going as well and loves to bully Ron/Max. She thinks he is crazy and doesn't waste a moment to rub it in, hair in braid that hangs down her back. AKA Becca
Malfoy (through adoption, after son, Heir)
"Weasely and Granger insulted Hadrian and hurt his elbow when Weasely pulled at it" said Draco.
"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED! WHERE'S HADRIAN?" they both shouted only for the phoenix to trill angrily at them kindly asking the to 'shut the hell up'.
"Well...."
"Go away Pansy, Hadrian doesn't have to say a thing to you and it doesn't matter if he is a lion in the snakes den, he's welcome here" said Draco who happened to look towards his godfather only to gain a nod.
He was cut off by a fourth year "what the hell!!" but with one look he stopped only a whimper coming from Snape's robes, Harry had resorted to hiding again like he did at the Malfoy's and his friends.
Most of the house looked at their Head of House wondering what had happened to the once happy boy that they got to know over the past year.
"Oh come off it Hadrian I'm here to protect you"
"You Sötétség will be out of here once I speak to the Governor's of the school board, they will reinstate Professor Dumbledore and you will be out of here!"
"I can't believe how nice it is to go to class and get our work done without being out questioned by Granger of all things" said Pansy.
"Hadrian don't mind what they say, they don't know what has happened to you before Uncle Sev took you in" said Draco to the boy who had brought his knees up and placed his forehead on them.
When the three of them had exited Ron took a bite out of some chicken and right there and then after swollowing he started to blurt out things like.
Everything was set and easy to go, Fred had somehow convinced three of the house elves to put several potions into different food and drink while George had managed to place many different time delay fireworks and fire crackers around the school nowhere was off limits in their books.
"Oh I don't think so Potter you better get up from there right now before I do something to you in front of everyone" sneered Ron making Hermione nod her head.
"I don't know Forge I really don't but we have to do something".
"I think I lost my hair tie but oh well" everyone looked at him like he had grown a second head but stopped when they heard someone being ill.
He saw Harry laying in his bed crying his eyes out, wrapped tightly up within his covers, Otiz ran over to him right away and jumped on to the bed and wrapped himself around Harry protecting him from anything and everything.
Steam was coming out of his mouth, he wanted to get into that room and help Harry calm down but no matter how hard he tried the door stayed shut.
They left his memories alone thinking that it would drive him into insanity which he tried to do with Harry but in Ron's case it would just make him look like he was crazy.
As you can see within the file the abuse he suffered from the time he was with his ex relatives all the way up to to last year when he was adopted not once did Mister Dumbledore check on young Mister Snape.
"We have put you here due to you attacking your fellow students, your grades have dropped so much that you are so far behind, we will be getting you a tutor to help you catch up" said Tom as he took a drink of water.
He just moaned it was going to be one of those days where Harry was going to be hyperactive but then very stubborn if he didn't get his own way like now at 5.30am, he decided to roll out of bed but when he did he was attacked by a slime ball.
"Professor we were just telling Harry..."
Suddenly an owl swooped in and landed on his desk, right away he asked if he could collect the letter from the owl and Professor McGonagall just nodded she wanted it out of her class for the time being.
"Dad?" Harry asked nervously towards his father, keeping a tight grip on Otiz for support as now he was bringing to transform back into his animal form.
"Ok before this turns into a fight why don't we go where we need to go in small groups instead of one group and we all meet up at Honeydukes and then the Three Broomsticks for a late lunch?" said Theo making everyone nod in agreement.
The other Weasley's would be getting something small, nick knacks really but each one would be tough through.
Even though Severus was against the whole chocolate thing wasn't for him he had to admit to a select few and I mean a very select few he did have a sweet tooth.
Classes had finally finished for the day and everyone got up and started to leave before they all left Filius set about giving them homework on the Cheering Charm.
