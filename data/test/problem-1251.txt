Thankfully, Julianna was the only one who took notice of the commotion which was most likely because Nicolas was at the back of the store taking care of another task. Draco bet a hundred pounds it wasn’t his relationships.
Draco cut himself short as he entered the living room where the dining table was. A newspaper flower stood proud in a glass Harry had found in one of Draco’s cabinets. Two plates were arranged opposite each other, complete with two pairs of forks and knives, resting on the left side of the plate, just how Draco liked. The two of them sat and began filling their plates.
The night went on this way, playing would you rather and asking each other questions that had no limit of depth. Of course, they didn’t include their family histories. No, that was still
per se, but somewhere along those lines. Planning the operation to destroy Harry Potter was one thing; executing it
Harry ran his hands through his hair, thinking to how Draco’s hands were just there a few hours back, making him feel at his most comfortable self.
“Draco, I know we haven’t had sex yet but we have the same parts you know, nothing I haven’t seen before. So let me in!”
Harry grins, grabbing the back of his shirt and tugging it over his head. He opened his arms, muscles flexing under skin, inviting Draco in.
All that was good about Draco’s mood fled now that he knew Nicolas worked at his favourite shop. Draco thought he’d left everything that reminded him of Nicolas long ago. Somehow, the universe decided two good days were one too many and that Draco was overdue an awkward encounter.
Pansy and Draco were taught to always be punctual throughout their childhoods, yet Draco always seemed to be late no matter how early he left. Pansy decided it was because he liked being “fashionably late.” She wasn’t wrong, but he would never give her the satisfaction of knowing that.
Draco glanced up at Harry through blonde fringe. His plump lips spread slowly into a dark smirk, eyes stormy.
. I do not know why, I just am. Ron only came a short time ago, we need to get going now that we have the sword,' soon after Harry said that Voldemort was staring at the dancing flames. Voldemort knew he could finish Harry right this minute before he became too weak but he also knew it wasn't time yet; he was known for grand entrances, flair and drama. Killing the boy now would be foolish, he had to wait it out, let his plan complete its course.
Draco turned his head around so fast, Harry could hear Draco’s neck crick. That was not a question he seemed to expect but it made him smile nonetheless.
Both of them settled down as Harry carefully picked up his own ice cream bowl from the side. “Now, Draco, how are you?” The question was so basic and yet, it made Draco feel like he was in a discount therapy session. It felt better than he wanted it to.
Harry was excited about his new project. He’d never designed a space before - everything had always been decided for him, and with this new project he had a proper place to focus his energy on.
His leg started shaking the more he thought of Draco, being sure of something so soon did not make logical sense, and lately logic and routine was what got him through the day. Was he just supposed to cave when someone like Draco came into his life, tossing everything about?
That night, Voldemort fell face first on his king-sized bed- exhausted from torturing people left, right and centre. Dreaming from Harry's head had become a usual routine now and almost every time, it was about one thing: Draco Sodding Malfoy. This time though, it was slightly different...more queer than normal.
“It would but I was teaching for a short while, I thought I’d take a break from it and pursue other passions. If I missed teaching, I could always go back.” Teaching at Hogwarts was a proper joy but soon, the place was bringing back too many difficult feelings and many nightmares. Moving seemed like the only feasible option at the time.
Harry woke up with a start and mechanically reached for the worn-out journal under his pillow, leaving Voldemort to go back to his reality and plot his plans for the poor unsuspecting boys (especially Draco).
Elena seemed pleased with his statement, nodding her head she jot down some more notes. One day, Harry was going to find a way to get his hands on that notebook.
,” Harry sighed as Draco eagerly kissed him. He soon regretted it though as Draco pushed him off the bed and all Harry could do was continue laughing.
Draco's cheeks warmed to light pink and he rolled his eyes, flopping back down on the cushy mattress. He stared at the canopy above him.
“That you are,” Harry chuckled as he returned Draco’s kiss with even more assurance than he had given Draco this morning.
“Wow, well I don’t have much to say to that, honestly. I’ve never seen you be this sure of someone. Even Nicolas seemed like a shot in the dark despite how much he had in common with you,” Pansy conversed, as she took small bites of her food in between sentences. She wasn’t wrong, however.
“Oh by the way, we didn’t even have sex. Bye Elena!” Seeing the astonished look on her face was enough for Harry and he quickly sprinted down the hallway until the elevators were in plain sight.
AHH we've reached the end! I have so many ideas for where this fic goes as it is the first one I've written that's THIS LONG. Maybe I'll do a part 2 one day. Who knows?
“Well, that certainly sounds like a plan. Do you think you would be able to handle the pressure of retail?” Harry chuckled at this, Elena, realising her choice of words did too. “Harry, you know what I mean. Saving the world is one thing, retail is entirely different. Mothers and children fussing about, throwing around items without a care but also shouting at anyone in charge for mistakes of their own making.”
“Yes, well, Pansy you work in interior design. People break into a nervous sweat over choosing eggshell or off white when there's no question, eggshell is always the better option.”
Harry interspersed his scarfing of food with compliments, every bit charmed by the efforts Draco went to produce such a meal. To which all Draco could reply was, “Oh, um thank you,” and continue to be embarrassed at the praise as well as perplexed at Harry’s eating habits. Once breakfast was completed, the two walked to the sofa and plopped down with full bellies.
Ginny. She would have loved coming to Ikea, would have probably played fake house with him before going back to their real house. Sometimes he wanted to punch himself for letting her go so easily whereas the next second wanting to thank and hug Ginny for letting him go when she did. Otherwise, he would have never found the person he had been waiting for his whole life.
The charming interior design of the living rooms caught Harry’s eye first, pulling him into the tiny living space. How would he be able to work here when folding his own clothes took so much out of him? With every room he visited, Harry fell more in love with different aspects of each of them whether it was the curtains in the living room or the wall cabinet in the mock bedroom or the pots and pans in the kitchen. None of the rooms matched the kind of style he was usually drawn to but they were all so quaint, Harry would have made it his home if he could do so. It would be a lot easier than buying, arranging and organising the items for his own home.
Harry was practically out of breath by the end of his sentence. His excitement seemed to bubble out of him at the most unexpected times.
“No you half wit, that’s pointless if he only likes one light colour.” Pansy rolled her eyes and asked the million dollar question, Harry did not want to answer, “Let’s see what he likes. Harry, what do you want to do?”
As his hands moved closer to Draco's abdomen, he left dark kisses all the way from his pale, exposed neck (Draco couldn't help but whimper) to his v-line. Draco moaned softly, his hand tangling in dark curls, trying to push him down further.
“Um, thank you for the offer but I am quite busy the next few weeks. I’ll see you around, though?” Jerry’s face visibly fell as Draco uttered those words and had begun to regret it a little, but before he could take his words back, the elevator dinged open for the ground floor.
“Huh, oh hi. Yes I’m here. Just got lost there for a few seconds,” Harry mumbled as he rubbed his hands against his face.
“Is there a particular reason, or did you forget?” Elena looked concerned, and whether he wanted to or not, the words simply started bubbling out of him.
“I did think about that, but I also know that I can really help people. It’s the only job that’s felt right. I’ve tried and failed at so many jobs I truly don’t want to be in this rut anymore. It also felt like a sign since I met him there too, he was looking for mugs and thought I worked there because I wore my favourite yellow shirt that day.”
I hope you loved reading this as much as I did writing it. Tell me your thoughts! What did you think of Harry and Draco's relationship? What was your favourite part or line? If there was a part two, what would you want to be in it?
Harry grinned against Draco's heated skin, tongue soothing over a love bite he'd just inflicted. He presses open-mouthed kisses on the pale stretch of canvas spread in front of him, getting moans and whimpers in return for his efforts.
. Even if they weren’t going to have sex, Harry still stayed. This was all too new to handle and in some ways, it felt too quick.
Said hair fell into Draco's eyes- The centre of Harry's attention. His eyes glittered with the flickering flame of candles around him, a shade of silver so cold it was almost blue. They shone like moonstone. Passion and what seemed like...contentment flashed across Draco's gaze as he considered Harry.
Harry smiled at that, sitting up to regard Draco. Draco gazed back at Harry from under pale eyelashes, a devious expression on his face. A smirk tugs at kiss-bruised lips, before Draco wiped his expression away, his eyes softly glittering silver in the dim light of the room.
“Draco! What are you doing here, twice in one week?” Harry chuckled, he wasn’t prepared to see Draco this soon after he left his home, especially before he got time to process what happened in the last few days.
if you liked this work and would like to see what I'm working on next, follow me on Tumblr as my @ is
“They’ve mostly been small restaurants and hotels. I still go to one of the cafe’s I designed, some of the server’s there are absolutely wonderful.” Draco said with a smile, from which Harry understood that he loved his job.
This hyper focused attention screeched to a halt as warm hands were placed on his belly and the sound of Harry’s breathing filled his ears rather than Joni Mitchell’s heartbroken voice.
“Uh, okay then.” Deciding that it was best to move away from the awkward energy, Harry focused on the lamps in front of him. One was a tall, dusky, gold lamp with an adjustable head and length. Looking at it, Harry knew that it would be one of the standout pieces in whichever room he chose to put it in. The other was a faded porcelain white, pleated fabric ceiling shade with a gold wire for hanging it to the ceiling. The muted colour and style reminded Harry of the dormitory lamps and it would provide light to all parts of the room unlike the lamp stand.
Draco's eyes narrowed evilly at Harry, and before the Golden Boy knew it, he was on his back with an irked boyfriend walking away. Draco plopped himself down at a desk in the corner of Harry's dream room, crossing long legs and bony arms.
Draco moaned almost imperceptibly, tilting his head to give more access to his pale skin for Harry to kiss and lick and mark.
At this statement, her eyebrows scrunched down as she scribbled down notes in her trusty notepad. The note taking made Harry a lot more anxious at the beginning of his sessions than it did now; they seemed to soothe him. It meant that someone was able to notice things about himself that he had trouble with, and it would eventually give him more clarity.
"Sorry, Harry. Now, what are you doing here disrupting a good night's sleep?" Draco's eyes narrowed and he turned his head to glare at his boyfriend.
A/N: I hope that chapter made up for the lost time. I am so sorry I didn't publish this earlier. It was quite short when I wrote it but I really wanted some smut in this chapter so I asked one of the best people in this world to help me and he added most of the smut in this chapter. I will try to update this but no promises because I have school and I am working on something big and important and I am so stressed, ahhhh. I love you all and thankyousomuch for reading this book <3.
Draco opened his mouth to speak but found an unforgiving silence that his vocal cords could not break. He trembled as the water droplets dripped off of his soaking wet body.
“-go dancing? I never thought I’d see the day!” Granger exclaimed, sounding like she had already had one too many.
Behind where Draco was sitting, he could hear the soft laughter of Pansy and Millicent, but he couldn’t pay much attention because Draco couldn’t get a good look, but he could’ve
Lunch was pleasant, albeit brief. Blaise had dozens of reports, or so he claimed, that he hadn’t submitted yet, while his partner remained in his office. Although they spent a precious few minutes bantering while heartily eating their meal, Blaise ultimately had to get back to work. Draco couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed; he had begun to enjoy the company. Nonetheless, Draco offered to walk him back to his office, to which his companion agreed.
"I met many men in my time that seemed to think I could not fuck them. But I assured them that every Malfoy Alpha was a man and that we all did the fucking." Harry watched as the ghost began undressing. He did not know they could do that. He did not really understand what happening as the ghost put on the harness and secured the dildo. He was unsure when the ghost picked up a very nicely made cat-o-nine-tails. However, when the ghost finally looked Harry in the eyes, he knew 100% that he was fucked.
So anyway, here's this chapter. I like to imagine that Narcissa is living with a secret lesbian lover and I almost had her take back her last name "Black" but idk if it'd fit this story.
"Well, you're not the worst I've seen a Malfoy choose but I would not have picked you from the crowd." They sneered. Harry saw a small bit of resemblance then to his own Malfoy. And then, Harry lost consciousness.
"Then don't call me Potter, Malfoy." Harry snarled back. Sure, he loved Draco, but that didn't mean he wasn't still an arse.
Eventually, the ghost pulled back. "Mmm, I suppose you pass. Here's something you should know. I'm not the last, and we'll all want some blood from you." Harry blinked his eyes open. What? His mind was fuzzy and he did not really understand what that meant. But as the whip came down against his skin, his mind cleared a bit. Not the last? The last what?
At first, the heat was a relief. The warmth that flooded him, the chemical dump into his brain. The Omega brain hoarded Serotonin and Dopamine for a few days and the bathed the nerves in it. Harry sighed as he woke up, rolling over into Draco and rubbing his now hard cock against his Alpha's leg. Draco's muscles flexed in his sleep and the hardness rubbed against Harry, making his eyes roll back. He nipped and whimpered at Draco.
Draco sighed. It had nothing to do with the decor though Harry would have understood if it had been. "She wants us to always be on time but she still loves to be..."
"I honestly don't know. Our generations don't speak much these days. Whenever you get to your betrothed's father, though, you'll know you're at an end."
"Come on, boy, I know you like this." Harry whimpered as the ghost taunted him. "I've seen more drip from your cock and from your wounds."
UGGGGGH Plot??? Who allowed there to be plot in this? I was really trying to figure out how to make this more sexy but my brain was like "You have to put SET UP in there you can't just throw them into it"
Although his tone lacked sincerity behind it, Narcissa still stopped him from leaving when she called his name out.
“You, I know you.” The man pointed his finger within an inch of Draco’s face, “You have your father’s face. He said you’d come.”
He sat there for a moment, with an empty coffee cup in hand and his pride feeling a bit wounded. As he stood up, grabbing his coat, he saw the parchment on the table, with only
That night, Draco roamed the streets until he happened upon a bar with a blinking neon sign that read “Mortar & Pestle”. He thought it was a stupid name and nearly scoffed at it until he witnessed something inside that caught his eye. The bar was packed to the brim with people inside as well as on the second-floor terrace. From across the sea of people, he thought he could just barely make out a silhouette of a black-haired man with glasses, leaning against the outdoor railing. It was difficult to tell – the bar was flooded with muggles, all young and self-important, but the idea refused to leave his mind until he was sure that it was him.
But really, who was he trying to fool? Certainly not Potter, and certainly not himself. They both would know the truth if he were to be caught.
His eyes widened, and his heart stopped. If he wasn’t so pissed drunk, he would’ve run out the second he could, but the poor, drunken man was paralyzed by what he’d seen. For that was the exact moment when it happened. That was the first time he had seen Harry Potter in years, and he was staring right into Draco’s eyes from the other side of the bar.
Pansy said nothing, opting for observing their interaction as if one of them would break at any moment. And if they were, Draco would be damned if he broke first.
The words Harry spoke rang true, yet to hear them coming from his mouth seemed too unbelievable to be real. Could what Harry said really be how he feels? That he...sympathizes with Draco? Understands him? He didn’t know how or why, but his heart hammered against his chest. His anxiety attack was over and yet it simply didn’t stop. Something new, a different emotion had taken its place.
Had their friendship not been so close, she would have slapped him across the face. Instead, the pair roared with laughter, while Pansy gave him a playful punch on the shoulder. Draco found it hard to keep a straight face as well, allowing for a snicker to escape.
“Like I said, I live in Muggle London. I have for several years now.” Draco replied, feeling tired of having to explain himself.
“It could’ve gone far worse, Draco. Everyone gets drunk.” She looked at him with a softer look this time.
to Draco and his friends. And what did Draco do, after eluding him for all those years? He went and made a complete knobhead of himself.
Both Harry and Draco raised their hand at the same time, causing a sheepish Draco to withdraw his hand. They looked over at each other uneasily as it happened.
As they sat in silence, it bitterly reminded Draco how once, long ago, he would have done anything for his parents’ approval. And then Lucius allowed the Dark Lord into their home, and all of a sudden, Draco didn’t see much of a reason to want to be like him anymore.
“Shall we give these Gryffindors a show, Malfoy?” She had said loud enough to get the trio’s attention, and to earn a hoot and holler from Millicent, Theodore, and Blaise. The others seemed too shocked to fully understand what was going on.
The Auror smiled at him, in response, “I know it’s a lot to think about. Of course, the pay will be substantial. And as for your rather colorful past…”
“I was for a bit, but I’ve come to terms with it,” Draco replied, offering no more to the conversation than that. It was bad enough having to hear it from Pansy, whom he wrote to the night before. She floo’d over after work, discussing Draco’s new case and doing nothing to make Draco feel better about the situation when every five seconds she was asking him how he he felt. Clearly, he wasn’t feeling great about it, so talking about it only made it worse.
After so many years running from Aurors, Draco couldn’t possibly imagine himself being employed as one. And yet, the thought of clearing his name, and helping his family get their wealth back was too tempting to bear. Had he been the same person he was a few years ago, he would have jumped at the chance. He would have done anything for his family. Now? Even if he does love his family, is he willing to give up his freedom for them? After everything that had happened in the past several years, the answer was not so clear.
Harry held out his left had with the handsome gold band and ruby tucked in it. "We're engaged, Mrs. Malfoy."
That is how Harry had come to stand in a foyer positively tacky with jewel tones and marble statues of classical women.
Also I don't know if what I'm doing is good so if you like this please let me know. I'm writing what I like in erotica and I'm writing Drarry because I like the pairing and I like fixing what Rowling broke.
"Ah, well, I suppose I can. I've already been through it. Harry, darling, in order to marry into the Malfoy family there are certain, ah, magics that must be performed."
"Potter," Draco hissed and Harry felt his body jump to attention. "I can smell your lust. Tamp it down."
That shook him. Draco sat up and looked Harry full in the eyes. "Nothing will take you from me. It's not going to be easy, but you and I have never liked easy, have we?"
"Jesus, Draco, could you make it sound like a death sentence, please?" Harry said around a mouthful of tart.
He felt a cold touch on his ass and then his pants slid down. He heard the ghost's voice very close to his ear and shivered. "If you like the whip so much..." and he felt something pressing against his hole. His eyes widened and he tensed up. But he realized then why this had to be done during his heat. His body responded to the pressure and his back arched. He felt as his natural lubrication let the hilt of the whip slide into him and he whined. His hardness bounced in front of him and he wished, desperately for something to rub against.
It is a true testament to Omega heat that Harry's dick didn't not immediately deflate. Draco and Narcissa had spent the past few days trying to tell Harry as much as they could about what was going to happen. It was, unfortunately, less than nothing. What they could say only left Harry frustrated. He even thought at a certain point that perhaps he and Draco didn't need to be officially married. Maybe they could just live together and never go through with this horrid Dark Magic Blood Purity Nonsense. But it seemed too late. Once they had stepped foot into the manor, this had to happen. Draco would live in actual, excruciating agony if this ritual was not complete. A bit of cruel irony, that. They trusted that Omega's would do anything to stop their Alpha's from feeling pain, including deep pain and mystery themselves.
The hand on his should dug nails in. Draco kept them filed, neat but sharp. They bit through the fabric of Harry's shirt. Then the hand pulled away, releasing a bit of pressure on his body. Harry wiggled underneath Draco, testing his Alpha's hold and his Alpha's patience.
But Draco had been nervous before, still was if he was honest with himself. And there was nothing like roughing up Harry Potter, boy wonder, to take his mind off of it. Fifteen minutes? More than enough time, just as Harry had said. Draco reached into the small drawer in the side table next to the couch and pulled out a gag. "Open." Harry obeyed. Sometimes he'd resist and Draco would shove the purple ball against his lips until the biting pain forced him open. But today, he knew they didn't have the time to play this way. Still, Draco was not gentle and he shoved it in and tightened it so it stretched the corners of Harry's mouth. It hurt but it didn't damage. Somehow Draco always knew the exact line. It felt like it might split the corner's open at any moment but through either skill or magic, Harry was never sure which, his mouth remained intact. The rest of his body was still in question though.
Also also, in case it wasn't clear, the ghost is a trans man. Still a Malfoy, so an evil trans ghost man. I picture him in like a flowy tunic. Basically, picture an old timey trans Draco but translucent. Bam. I, too, am bad at history so idk what era I'm picturing for clothing, sorry!
The Omega buckled beneath him, eyes rolling back and tightening around Draco's hardness. Draco let out a grunt and thrust hard once, twice into Harry and lost himself inside his mate. Harry, for his part, was lost in an orgasm. Draco always envied him an Omega orgasm. They seemed so all encompassing, so releasing. Plus, it took so very little after a little roughing up to set Harry over the edge.
Harry and Draco trailed after her like the train on her black and silver robe. The sitting room they entered was lush, with a well maintained black carpet with silver thread throughout. The couch on which Draco and Harry sat was black wood and green velvet. A silver and glass coffee table sat piled with hot tea, cakes, pastries, all provided by a well paid house elf named Scroo who sat in the corner dressed in maids dress. Harry had once asked him why he wore the dress. "It's comfortable, Master Potter." Was how Scroo answered. Harry asked no further questions. Like where he had even found a house elf sized maid dress that would fit him.
Downstairs, the met Narcissa who seemed to instinctually know it was time. She was dressed in a modest, for her, black gown with small silver enchantments that sparkles in opposite time with each other. Her silver hair tied back and high. She held her hand out  to Harry.
"If you suck my cock well enough, maybe I'll give you a hint about what's happening to you, hero boy." Harry was unsure, as he was very much tied standing up, how he'd suck a cock but then he remembered, oh right, ghost as they floated upwards and positioned the dildo as his mouth. He did not trust it's cleanliness and did not feel, despite his raging hard on, remotely like sucking a cock right now. But his heat and the surprisingly force this ghost had eventually forced his mouth to open. He closed his eyes and tried to relax his jaw.
"But we've never told them that we're engaged before! I know you've never really understood what being pureblood means in the wizarding world but..."
It wasn't as brutal as it could have been. He had cast lube onto himself. He wasn't a monster. Plus, Harry still had to walk for the rest of the day. He thrust fast and hard. Harry's own cock, hard and a little thicker, but a touch shorter than Draco's own, slapped against Harry's stomach. It twitched as Draco fucked Harry. He dragged a hand down Harry's side and held his hip tight, wanting to leave finger print bruises. Harry moaned and bucked his hips. His cock drooled and left a sticky spot right below his belly button. Such a nice stomach, Draco thought. They were still in good shape, Draco made sure they went running every day. Harry complained every step of the way. But it was worth it for the sight underneath him now. Draco felt his climax building. It was only then that he slowly ran his finger up Harry's cock while releasing his neck and slapping him hard across the face.
The ghost still did not say anything but to Harry's shock, it picked up a strappy looking leather thing off the wall. "You can touch things?" Harry asked.
Harry turned, worried and scared, to Draco, his Alpha. Narcissa snapped. "Draco, be the Alpha your Omega needs right now."
"But brain, this is a ridiculous fanfic meant for a/b/o Drarry dom/sub sexy times and ancient magic sex rituals"
Harry was lounging on the oversized, plush purple couch that Draco had picked out for their house. It was very comfortable but Draco hated it when Harry put his feet up on it. So, of course, he was doing just that right now. "It's not like I haven't met them before." Harry popped a chocolate into his mouth and chewed. It exploded on his tongue and the warm liquid traveled down his throat, just like...
"Hmm, you're close." Harry watched as the ghost disappeared around the back of him. He was momentarily puzzled until he remembered that being incorporeal meant that, of course, his captor could go through the walls.
"Mrs. Malfoy," Harry began and saw her wince. "I'm not... no offense but... you're really not my type."
"Ask your husband when we're through, I suppose." The ghost dispassionately came towards Harry. "But for now, you will only speak when spoken to."
It took Harry a few days but his heat came to him. The day before, he was grumpy and spaced out. It occurred to him at one point that Lucius hadn't been told, that they hadn't spoken with him at all. But he was in such a shit mood, he mostly counted himself lucky that he didn't have to see that asshole. He hated that Draco still had even the smallest connection to his father. But it would be another few years of Lucius Malfoy's imprisonment before inheritance laws fully kicked in and Draco and Narcissa were freed from his last holds over them.
"It's not so simple, dear." Narcissa said, softly. Narcissa was never soft. Not even when Harry had seen her presenting full Omega during her trial. Her submission status to Lucius, her Alpha, plus her help had really played in her favor. But still, gentle was scary.
Draco had inherited his father's money after Lucius was imprisoned. Harry still had his inheritance as well but Draco outclassed it by a few hundred thousand Galleons. So most of Harry's clothes were bought with Draco's money. Which also meant that Draco felt no guilt when he literally ripped Harry's jeans off of him. Harry gasped around his gag. Though he had been witness to the strength given to Draco by his Alpha lust, it still was surprising to see it in action.
"She secured you face out. I think she thought this would be in your favor as you could see what was coming at first. However, as I do not wish to retie you, I think it will be all the worse, in the end."
"Always." Harry said. But the next few weeks would challenge everything Harry had ever thought about Draco, about the Malfoys, and about the wizarding world as a whole.
He felt the slide of it down his throat. Silicone, no matter how well crafted, had a different give than flesh and muscle and blood. Part of him wanted to bite down, to chew against the rubber. He felt, though, this would be a very bad idea. As it pulled back, he tried to suction the way he would had this been Draco, licking the shaft as it came out and treating the head so some extra love. He drooled down the front of himself and tried to breath through his nose.
Listen, fuck the epilogue, fuck leaving Harry a mess (or at least, not the mess Rowling left him. I'm going to leave him another type of mess obviously). Harry's a teacher who loves children and giving them chances he never got and being the kind of mentor he SHOULD have had instead of the kind that molds you into what he needs to "save the world."
Harry's cock twitched at that. Draco smirked but it didn't quite reach his eyes. He stood up and held his hand out to Harry. "The sooner begun, the sooner finished. Let's go, Potter." Draco swatted at Harry's bum as he stood and got dressed. Even now, apparently, Draco couldn't resist.
Harry tried to reply but nothing but a small squeak exited his mouth. Draco's weight was on top of him and he could not resist the charms of his Alpha. Even when they were still in school, still pretending at hating each other, Harry was drawn to the sheer dominance that even then Draco held in him.
"More than enough time, Mr. Potter." That was another button. They had been arguing over who's last name they'd take. Harry was the Omega so it'd be tradition to take the Alpha's name but it was the only thing he had left of his family. Malfoy, for his part, was more willing to shirk his legacy but he also could not leave behind his Alpha pride so easy. Draco showed his teeth to Harry and shoved him, not gently, down.
Harry smiled. "He's well, thanks. He and Lupin are out camping." Sirius and Narcissa had an uneasy truce. Harry had been trying to encourage Sirius to be more social and Narcissa was trying to reconnect now that she wasn't fully brainwashed by blood purity anymore.
"I'll show you how much time I really need with you, Mr. Malfoy." Draco said. He was almost lupine in his voice. A slender man, Draco's biceps never bulged, per se, but they sure as hell flexed and were strong enough to hold Harry in place. One hand held Harry by his left shoulder and the other, Draco wrapped lovingly tight around Harry's throat. "I'll shut you up, once and for all."
"Of sorts, my dear. You see, purebloods back in the day wanted to make sure that family lines held up to standards befitting their names so many of them designed ceremonies to perform before marriage."
He had just begun to panic in earnest when a ghost floated into the room. They were skinny to the point of androgyny, short cropped hair, very old style of clothing. Hermoine would have known the exact year but history was never Harry's strong suit. Old, is what he knew. The ghost seemed to be ignoring him while lovingly trailing their hands along some of the instruments on the wall.
Harry flushed. It's not his fault that his Alpha was hot! Also, they both knew that there was only a few days left until Harry went into heat. Draco tracked it with precision. It was embarrassing but also, again, kind of hot. After a lifetime of needing to know the answers, of saving the world, of pretending to be an Alpha, Harry was allowed to be just an Omega. Someone to be cared for and for an Alpha to control. Being manipulated was something Harry was used to, but at least in this relationship's case, he was a willing participant.
Oh and Sirius is still alive, dating Lupin, and Lupin is an Alpha and Sirius is an Omega because he's an emotional mess obviously. They probably won't appear in this fic at all but maybe I'll make one about them later. They are OTP.
Draco was pacing, huffing and wringing his long, slender hands. Harry tried not to stare at Draco's fingers and imagine their length and what they had been doing, just last night. He tried to concentrate on being calm and soothing which was sort of the opposite of what he was used to being. But he also wasn't used to Draco feeling this out of control. Draco was all about control. That's what Harry loved about him. Now that, you know, he allowed himself to admit that he did, in fact, love a Malfoy.
They both lay there for a moment, panting before Draco checked his watch. "Three minutes." He straightened up and grabbed his wand. He gave it a flick and his hair, pants, everything was in it's proper place again. Harry lay there, pantsless and a mess. Just as it should be, thought Draco.
Malfoy Manor had been slowly transforming in the decade or so since Narcissa had been occupying it by herself. Draco had moved out after he went back to Hogwarts for the infamous "eighth year" and never looked back. Narcissa, however much she had been changed by the events of the Battle of Hogwarts, still very much loved luxury and refused to give up the money and comfort that came with the large house. However, now that Lucius was gone, she was transforming it into her own.
In another part of town, Draco dried himself off with a towel as he stood in front of his cupboard wondering what he could wear that would make him look fabulous but in a way that seemed effortless.
“I guess I figured that I would have to undertake a different approach if we needed to make progress with what you’re going through. All that I have tried before, clearly isn’t working anymore.”
“Huh, maybe,” Draco shrugged. “I do remember being somewhat wasted that night. We were celebrating something or other, I suppose I forgot a lot of things.” Draco chuckled. Harry audibly sighed in relief and continued laying down the blankets, trying to fluff them in the right places as Draco continued devouring his “breakfast.”
“No, you’re all good. It was nice seeing you after a while. Next time you’re around, bring about your beau too, why don’t you?”
“He has been the only person who has ever let me feel like I was given the key to his home. Not just I feel like I am Pans, we weren’t intimate with each other and yet I still felt like I knew him better than anyone else in his life. Like we’ve known each other for years. Taking a pause, Draco continued, “So, yeah. I think I am ready. If not now, then when? If not him, then whom?”
Harry snuggled under the covers with Draco, arms wrapping around his small waist. Draco suppressed a soft smile, turning to look at Harry.
“I really don’t know, I want to say yes? But I just met him and yet everything clicks into place with him around. Whether it’s in conversation or making breakfast together.”
“I think I have, actually. I just bought a new apartment near Baker Street and since I didn’t have many belongings that were mine in the old apartment, I decided to design it myself!”
Lace curtains did very little to block the sunlight streaming onto the bed, making Harry squint. Dark blue sheets splayed out and over the edges of the four-poster, a clear indication of some - or perhaps a lot of -
Draco was caught off-guard; no one had ever done something even close to this in all his years of dating people. In a strange way, just this act of wonderfulness from Harry made his anxiety calm down a little even though his heart raced faster.
“I’m fine. Possibly a minor head injury but I’ve dealt with worse.” As he stood up, Draco straightened the wrinkles out of his shirt and dusted off his pants, “I was just about to leave, in fact. Do I have yet to pay for anything?”
“Fine I won’t say anything but you will have to tell him at some point. It isn’t even your fault so I don’t see what the problem is.” Pansy often took things at face value, deciding whether or not a certain problem or person was worth her precious time. This was where their similar upbringings now differed. Pansy had always been unable to lower her walls and let people in, whereas Draco spent so much time learning how to let people break them. That now, he’d just started safeguarding his heart when Harry walked in and all of them fell down again.
Banter was often what was missing towards the end of his relationship with Ginny, joking about Ron and his life choices was their favourite thing to make fun of. With all the events that took place through his years at Hogwarts, Harry never imagined himself with anyone
There was nothing Pansy could say to that, she had trouble looking for the kind of love Draco fortunately had luck with. He was grateful, times like these, to have her. Often, it was Pansy who put his doubts and his irrationalities in place, her protectiveness saved him in the past. Draco would do anything to make sure her opinion mattered here too, no matter how sure he felt about Harry, he would only feel at ease once Pansy gave her approval. She was more than a friend, she was his rock.
“I assumed since you were Draco’s friend, you just had opinionated feelings about a lot of things,” Harry lightly jabbed as Draco loudly snickered, covering his mouth to try and control his laughter all while Pansy simply scoffed.
Of course, Draco felt like the winner here. All it took was a little huffing and glaring and Harry would bend to his every whim. He pressed his cheek against Harry's chest, the sweet smell of Harry surrounding the two.
Harry looked up, dark green eyes piercing even in the soft light- Draco's stomach dropped a little. His eyebrows drew in and cold silver eyes focused intently on Harry. He cups Harry's cheek in his hand. Seconds ticked by, sand in the hourglass of life, and Draco and Harry just stared.
The blond sighed, “I received it. I just haven’t had the best day and I was not prepared to see you here so soon. I assumed I’d just text you later and we would go out for a drink on the weekend.” As soon as those words came out of Draco’s mouth, Harry’s shoulders relaxed.
Usually Elena wasn’t so vocal with what she thought of Harry’s decisions but lately she’d been constantly trying to help understand what he already knew in different ways. It wasn’t that Harry was ungrateful but he also didn’t know where all of this was coming from.
Harry took a deep breath and sunk further down onto Draco's hard dick, taking it into his mouth. He bobs his head over about half of it, gently sucking and licking the head as he comes up.
As Harry observed passers by, he mindlessly sunk into the chair further slowly adjusting the pillow to support his back but before he could shut his eyes and drift off to sleep, someone tapped him on the shoulder.
Draco didn’t even try to reply. Shuddering in embarrassment, he tried breathing in and out quietly. Losing his grip right now would only bring forth questions he didn’t want to answer. He heard the flush before he heard Harry’s voice.
The rest of their evening was spent the way it went last night, in getting to know each other so deeply that the only time they stopped talking was when they stuffed their faces with the leftovers from breakfast.
After leaving the cafe, Draco decided that shopping for groceries would be the best use of his time until he could meet Pansy. Two hours later, with multiple plastic bags digging into his arms practically making them a whole new colour of red, Draco’s phone started to ring loudly as he crossed the threshold of his house. Cursing Pansy in his head, he dropped all his bags with a thud.
“Hi, can we get two chocolate eclairs, two coffees, one quiche Lorraine and a vegan reuben roll,” Pansy had requested, snapping the menu shut.
Voldemort knew Draco had some imperative connection to the Boy-Who-Lived and he would do anything to find some weakness of Harry's; with the boy on the loose and his Trace gone, it was crucial that he find information, time was running out. One of the reasons Voldemort was torturing Draco was because, he already knew how Harry felt about him, he just needed to know if Draco felt the same, this way he could have a common weakness between the two.
Unable to say anything more, Draco abruptly pulled Harry into the tightest hug he had ever given anyone.
. I know I want maroon. I don’t know where that colour would go best, but it’s one that reminds me of a memorable time in my life and so I’d love to have it be an important colour of my home.”
Voldemort stumbled as his memories were shifted to Harry's again. This time Harry was near a large body of water with his two friends, sitting on the rocks. Voldemort could hear everything clearly and tried to pay attention.
Whatever Draco had told him was too vague, he planned to get more information before dawn which wasn't far away. Time was running out and Voldemort could feel himself getting weaker, three of the Horcruxes had already been destroyed; making Voldemort only a little afraid of just how smart Harry and his friends really were. He could not show his weakness to the rest of them, he had to keep it together and plan for the inevitable battle.
“I started about two weeks ago and I usually do night shifts but Julianna needed the extra help today so I switched shifts! Here is your extra hot espresso and warm doughnut. Julianna filled me in on how you liked your order. Enjoy!”
Sadly, the appreciation of Draco’s hair only lasted a few seconds before he woke up and smirked at the swift removal of Harry’s hand from his head, practically alarmed at the sudden movement of Draco.
Even after years of therapy, Harry still plucked the hem of his shirt or picked his cuticles when Elena asked him this question.
“Wow, this is a first, you’re actually early! How have you been darling?” With all of her snark, Pansy was still the first person Draco would go to for anything and everything.
Nodding at her clarification, the waiter took down their order and walked away to the kitchens, leaving the two alone.
“I’m back!” came Harry’s voice, muffled by the giant blanket he wore around his head while he carried a tray of assorted dishes.
Draco wraps long legs around Harry's waist and Harry raises an eyebrow at him, but he just smiles innocently.
Harry’s warm breath falling on his neck was enough to make Draco reconsider his decision to simply be silent and softly nod his head. Harry seemed to understand Draco’s predicament and chose to let go of him and walked out of the bathroom instead.
Even though Harry could barely see anything in the faint light of the bathroom, Draco nodded along, wanting Harry to go on.
“Oh well, I’m sorry you haven’t had the best day. If it helps, likewise, I have a lot to do within the next few days. I didn’t think I would be seeing you this quickly either! It is a pleasure nonetheless.” At this, a barely visible smile appeared on Draco’s face and Harry decided to ask him a question that would make or break his afternoon.
Draco cupped Harry's face in soft hands and kissed every feature of his: his forehead, nose, the crease between his bold eyebrows and finally...his soft, full lips. Each kiss that was left was tender and filled with love but also, inevitably, sent sparks of heat through Harry's blood and down his body.
Soon enough, Harry started getting tired of walking around in circles and propped himself on the most comfortable chair he could find and chose to observe the families shopping for their own homes instead. Little children played house with themselves or their siblings, switching the stoves on and off, testing out the beds in hopes that it could be part of their room and best of all, picking up the fluffy stuffed animals and treating them as one of their own. Mothers pushed strollers, quietly admiring the picture perfect dining tables knowing they couldn’t have nice things until their kids got older as fathers went after any Ikea worker they found to ask them a barrage of questions.
“He’s not wrong, Pans, you do have many expressive thoughts about lighting options, as you so clearly displayed. Just as I do about food!”
To apply for a job at Ikea, Harry would have to go there first and since he didn’t have any plans for the day, he decided to get on with finding furniture for his apartment too. It was going to be an extremely long day.
“And… breakfast is ready!” Draco declared as the last sprig of rosemary was added to the mushrooms he had stir-fried. Most would say this was fairly extravagant of him but Draco believed the best thing you could do for yourself was to find time and cook yourself the best meal your resources allowed for.
“It’s a good choice. Do you think you’ll need a study? I think it’s the best place to fit in some maroon and in case you ever decide to teach again, the space will be versatile enough for you to adjust it accordingly.”
“You know me so well Jul, and with that I would love a glazed doughnut and your best espresso, presto.”
“Perfect, because I took a cab.” Draco added, accomplishing his mission of pissing Pansy off in the best way possible.
Draco loved the outfit he was wearing so his commute would be the only factor that made him right on time or late. Quickly, he had sorted his groceries by putting cold produce in the fridge and left anything he could sort out later, on his dining table. Once Draco was out of his apartment, the elevator dinged open for someone on the same floor as him. The first day he'd moved into his apartment was the only day he had spoken to anyone, Draco wasn’t one for becoming close friends with his neighbours, unless they knew famous celebrities or had fantastic connections of course.
“I could have dropped that hot pan on your foot, you know. Don’t sneak up on me like that.” There was less annoyance in his voice and more empathy; he didn’t want to cause Harry any pain.
Suddenly, Draco’s leg started shaking uncontrollably. Even as he put a hand on it to stop the shaking, his leg seemed to have a mind of its own and simply bounced even faster as he tried to spill words, any words, to come out of his mouth.
“This would be the perfect reading lamp Harry! It’s a neutral colour so it would likely go with everything and it has so many different height settings!” Pansy loved weighing out the pros and cons of the functionality of the product whereas Draco…
“Nothing.” Draco sharply answered through his teeth. Pansy rolled her eyes and folded her arms defensibly.
As a reply, Draco’s smile widened a little and he crawled onto Harry’s side, lightly nudging him to the outer edge of the sofa and quickly pulled the blanket that lay on the ledge of the couch over the two of them. Harry’s body engulfed Draco under the comforter and soon, they were both fast asleep.
Draco quickly crossed the street and walked to the best coffee shop he had ever known. It was small yet inviting but not so much so where it got crowded this time of day - the perfect balance. As soon as Draco walked in, Julianna waved him over to the counter. Her presence was one of the many reasons this particular coffee shop became such a significant part of Draco’s morning routine every single day.
Pansy had tensed up at Draco’s sentiment towards Harry. Her suspicion never did any good and often caused Draco unwanted anxiety but he couldn’t avoid it since her opinion was held with high regard even if it didn’t always add up with Draco’s partner’s actions.
Most people who worked at Ikea were usually friendly, but when you visited the store every other week without buying anything and managed to cause multiple (small) accidents, you started gaining a reputation. It was for these reasons that Harry was on the receiving end of multiple stink eyes and these only intensified when he walked up to the small desk where job applications and important notices were pinned up.
“Quit the cheeky act and prepare some coffee. Mugs on the top right, French press in the corner, and the coffee packet is near the oven.”
Harry's hands slowly dragged down Draco's body, rough callouses feeling smooth skin. His hand slipped under Draco's waistband, fingers finding smooth skin and coarse hair.
“I know, that’s why I do it,” Pansy giggled. “It would be atrocious manners if I knew you for so many years and not know what you’d like to have!”
"Yes, ferret, it's me. And what did we say about calling each other by our last names while we were in private?" A grin pulled at Harry's lips, almost a smirk like the one Draco had sported for a good 6 years.
,” Draco added, but not before pulling Harry in for a passionate yet soft kiss, letting Harry know exactly what he was going to miss once they were apart.
“Is that a good chair?” A familiar voice asked him. Turning around, Harry saw Draco standing right behind him next to a short girl with a black bob, arms folded and scaling him up and down.
“Draco?” Cautiously, Harry approached Draco, pressing his head against his shoulder. Just hearing his name in that tone made Draco’s anxiety shoot up even higher. Feeling pity in Harry’s voice was worse than facing him because it would only bring about more unwanted discussions.
“Doesn’t seem like there’s much I can say to reassure you, does there? I’ve never seen you like this Draco!” Pansy exclaimed happily, “I kind of like it to be completely frank.” Draco giggled at this, he liked it too. A lot.
Draco smiled, what he hoped was sweetly, but it hid dark promises behind it, and Harry could see that.
There was no denying that she was right. He certainly didn’t want to lose himself in the whirlwind of what could be this relationship.
Harry knew Draco was right where he wanted him. He took a step towards Draco, arms still thrown open, and then he had an armful of warm skin, silver-blonde hair tickling his chin. Harry's breath was almost knocked out of him, and a laugh bubbles from his throat as he wraps lean arms around Draco's slim body.
to say. He just surged forward, grabbing Draco in a hug. He held Draco tightly, and time seemed like it stood still.
Draco wasn’t in the mood to play along so he cut right to the chase. “I’ll buy you lunch today at Paul’s at three o’clock. And I have some news if you have any interest in hearing me out.” Draco had been playing the passive aggressive game for twenty-five years now, Pansy barely had any hold on him anymore.
“Oh, that’s interesting! Draco vaguely mentioned something of that sort when we spoke.” Wanting to steer the conversation off himself, Harry began asking Draco questions about what he did specifically. “What type of companies have you worked with, Draco?”
A loud whistle brought Harry back to reality. With a shake of his head, he took the kettle off the gas and poured the hot water into the glass French press. Nothing too fancy, it seemed to have been bought from a place like Ikea (which it was, Harry noticed). As the coffee steeped, Harry looked around for vanilla extract, a trick he found brought a richer flavour to his coffee and one he was sure Draco would like.
'OKAY FINE I WILL TELL YOU, JUST PLEASE STOP!' Draco yelled out before he collapsed on the auburn, wooden floor. Lord Voldemort slowly walked over to the fireplace while Narcissa tried to help her boy over to the ebony futon. His pale skin and hair contrasted with the futon although; his dark three-piece suit blended into it to the point where you could
Harry couldn't breathe, eyes locked on Draco, and then they were kissing, pushing, ripping and tearing and bleeding.
“Where are you going?” Draco hated how needy he sounded but with all that he was feeling, he couldn’t be bothered.
Harry took a steady step up to the side of the Slytherin's bed, arms folded- he seemed to be holding back a grin on his tanned face. Fixing his lopsided glasses, Harry blinked innocently at Draco- he waved an idle hand and Draco let out a soft snort, grumpily scooching over in the bed.
“I met this guy and—“ just as Draco was going to give her the more shocking part of his story, a shadow fell above his table.
“Hush, now even if you don’t want to talk about why your face was red as a rose shortly after one of the best nights of doing nothing I have ever had, we are going to make sure that it’s bright as the sun once I’m done with you. Now, have some of the remaining ice cream I found in your freezer while I lay these blankets down. Don’t even worry about it, they will be going straight into the machine after this.” Draco startled, as Harry practically took the words right out of his mouth.
Draco loved taking his time with food, appreciating it and making sure every part of the process was completed to perfection, from keeping the eggs out for exactly five minutes so that they weren’t too cold to fly into a hot pan, remembering to salt the mushrooms right before he was done with them so they were able to cook to crispy perfection without the moisture seeping out. This meticulousness left Draco with wonderful food but also countless missed calls and texts, usually from Pansy, asking him what kind of dress would suit her best for whichever event she had planned that night.
Loved finding something the polar opposite and confusing Harry about any decision he had his mind set on.
Harry gently tortured Draco with his tongue, pulling off his cock and licking it like candy. A thin sheen of sweat covered the both of them- they didn't care though- they adored this time the two of them had together.
But Draco loved it. He kept his face surprisingly straight for most of Harry's whispered words ("Never knew anyone could be so beautiful," "Look at how pretty you are," "My handsome Draco")
Harry leaned back against Draco's pile of pillows, relaxing and stretching. He eyed Draco from under dark eyelashes. It was hard enough to make him out with this terrible lighting, never mind without his glasses.
“A home planner? I don’t know if that makes sense but I’m pretty okay with helping people design their homes but my own feels so difficult, I need all the help I can get. Organising homes for functionality and purpose is something I seem to do well, at least according to my friends when I helped them with their new house a few months ago.” Harry liked how Pansy asked him questions, it made him feel like she wanted to get to know him outside of his relationship with her best friend.
'Legilimens!' Draco's face crumpled at the struggle of blocking Lord Voldemort's incantation. This was the third spell he had cast on the pale-faced boy that night; first being the Cruciatus curse, second being the Imperius. Both equally torturous, making Draco weak in the knees and slightly sick to the stomach. Neither of these spells worked well enough for the Lord. Draco, being the loyal son to Lucius, told Voldemort what he asked but he was quite vague and the Lord was never patient nor caring about other's feelings if he could benefit from the information in the person's mind.
“Oh, Harry, you didn’t have to do this,” he said as he held his hand to his heart, praying nothing ever happened to this perfect human.
Draco hesitates (even in his dreams, Harry knows that Draco is sceptical), but after a second of nothing, Harry feels Draco's fingers lightly resting in his palm. He laughs- Draco really was a prat.
“I have. It’s normal.” Pansy shrugged once she caught up with the two and was in earshot of their conversation.
“Firstly, that is the least irrational thought I’ve ever seen anyone have. Secondly, if I’m being honest, I haven’t let it cross my mind but I do know that the second I leave your sight, all the questions about everything we are and we aren’t, are going to come flooding in. And trust me, I have a lot of questions. But we’re going to work
“If I may ask, where did you get your communication skills from? People I know would have just left me alone if I didn’t want to answer their questions.” It had even been the way of order in his own home and so talking about any feelings he had, was either ignored or frowned upon. When he found Pansy, he realised he could open up more but since she too was brought up in a similar way, there were few times the two of them shared any heart-to-heart conversations.
“It’s a special talent, I think.” Pansy replied, snark flowing through her voice, “Anyways, I’m leaving now and will probably reach Paul’s fifteen minutes or so? Don’t be late.”
"Ah, Merlin, Harry! I- I never thought I'd be so into this a couple months ago..." Harry grinned at that. "Well, Drae, if we keep this up, I'll be into this," Harry rubs over Draco's ass, "in no time." He grins impishly as he presses kisses to Draco's sensitive thighs, getting closer and closer to his hard on.
Two pretty spots of colour flushed in Draco's cheeks and his gaze drops to Harry's neck, then slowly lower and lower.
“Why? What did they do?” Harry’s curious nature always got the better of him even when it knew not to comment.
"I don't mind at all," Harry breathed, eyes traveling over Draco's delicate features. He smiled at Draco, then in the blink of an eye was between Draco's legs. Harry smiled, tracing the shape of Draco's dick through his pants, and Draco was reduced to graceless moaning.
Draco squirmed and Harry broke away. Draco couldn't tear his gaze away from clear green eyes. "Draco."
“If I didn’t let you know earlier, let me tell you now. You look like an absolute snack,” whispered Harry before finally letting go of Draco.
Harry took a few minutes to settle in while his mind refused to do the same. All the questions he had pushed away the second he met Draco bubbled up within the first minute he had to himself in forty-eight hours. How would he explain his life, his true history to Draco? The Wizarding world wasn’t kind to Muggles or really anyone
In his peripheral vision, Tom could see a four-poster bed with deep maroon curtains. He instantly knew where he was; the Gryffindor dorm room. This was fifth year all over again. Tom was in Harry's head and the latter was completely unaware as he kept writing in a journal that looked oddly familiar to Tom. His subconscious clicked reminding him that this was the same journal Lily had kept on her nightstand on the night he went to kill Harry Potter when he, himself got turned into ash instead.
The morning shone bright with hope and fluffy clouds greeted Draco as he walked out of his building. The turtleneck certainly kept him warm as the winds blew swiftly in every direction. A strong espresso delivered by his favourite barista was exactly what Draco needed to set his morning off in the right direction and since he had taken some vacation days this week, he was free to do nothing. The last time he remembered having this much free time was the summer before he went off to college. Free time was not something he knew how to fill up but he knew just the person who did.
Thirteen minutes later Draco reached Paul's and Pansy had yet to arrive which gave him rights to pick his favourite seating. Today had been a long day and it wasn’t even five in the evening, he would take any win he could get. Two minutes later, Pansy was at the booth Draco picked out, her face plastered with a humoured smile.
Breakfast was usually made for one but since Draco had a guest he decided he could whip up something slightly impressive. He didn’t get to show off his talents often since not many people visited him, apart from his mum and best friend. Draco wasn’t even doing it for the praise or because he immensely liked this man - that was only five percent of it. The least he could do for Harry, whose company was refreshing from the men he usually stumbled upon that were looking for a casual one night stand, was cook something small and nice.
Since it would be absurd for Draco to stay in one coffee shop for over two hours, he decided it was high time he left and found something else to do. The city could be fun in the daytime if he looked hard enough. Making a sneaky exit was going to be tough but Draco was sure he could manage it. All he had to do was not shake the table, not walk too quickly nor walk too slowly, not rattle his keys but instead, be the definition of stealth. Easy.
Draco kept quiet. Maybe Harry would leave, waiting until Draco was ready to come out. Harry rapped on the door even more rapidly as his apparent need to use the toilet became even more urgent with each second that passed by.
Nowadays, many companies were putting up job applications on their new websites but Ikea seemingly hadn’t got the memo, Harry realised as he finished filling up his application. It was a good thing that the Ministry of Magic was able to send Muggle diplomas on such short notice, and that Harry requested for one the second he made the decision to work here last week. Once the application was all written out and a scanned picture of his “diploma” was stapled to it, he slipped everything into the tiny blue slot. As Harry slipped the documents in, his anxiety kicked in. All he could do was breathe in and out, trying his best to reassure himself that this was a good decision.
Consider even transportation – an Apparition licence is the cheapest option, but it requires magic. Floo powder is not expensive in and off itself, but you’d need a hearth, which is not always an option on a budget. Brooms are expensive. Portkeys need a license and have to be charmed. Knight Bus fare adds up when you have to pay twice a day every day…”
Potter flushes and scratches at the back of his head. “Sorry about that,” he says. “You’re the bloke from yesterday right? The one I ran into?”
Thankfully the street is busy enough that when Draco glances over his shoulder, he catches no sight of Potter. He slows to a more reasonable place, letting out a relieved sigh. Inappropriate crush aside, it’s best that he not get too close to Potter. Certainly, Potter won’t recognize him on sight alone. But the wish was frustratingly vague, and Draco has closer history with Potter than most. What if he were to say something that caused the other man to recognize him? No, it’s undoubtedly better to stay far, far away.
Diagon is festooned for the season, magical decorations adorning every sign and lamppost, twinkling from the windows of shops he’d frequented as a child and climbing their storefronts. Draco spends a moment taking in the sigh, a nostalgic ache taking place in his heart at the memories of winters he’d once loved. He closes his eyes, inhaling deeply and taking in the familiar smells and sounds.
He thankfully takes mercy on Draco then, getting up to go get something to read from the shelves and giving him time to pull his façade back together. By the time Potter returns with some book about Quidditch, Draco’s cheeks are no longer heated, and he’s managed to compose himself.
Draco eyes the cup warily. She’s trying to sell him tea? He cannot deny that it’s an appealing thought – he’s still shivering from the chill of being outside, and the caffeine would be welcome – but he doesn’t have that kind of money to spare.
But Draco hasn’t come this far to turn back now, so he draws in a steadying breath, steels his nerves, and steps out of Knockturn and onto the snow-covered cobblestone of Diagon Alley. And, in the grand scheme of things, very little changes. He steps from one street to another. But to Draco, the moment feels weighty, monumental. He takes another step, then a third, looking around in delight.
Potter, for some reason, laughs. “Here?” He says. “No, I don’t. It’s the nearest ice rink that I know of, that’s all.” He pauses and looks around contemplatively. “It’s a nice area though,” he offers. “Very jolly.”
Draco clings closer to Potter and eyes the racing vehicles nervously, glad that Potter doesn’t seem inclined to put him down. Potter glances down at him, and his green eyes dance in amusement even as he says, “Sorry, I should have warned you it was in Muggle London. It can be a bit overwhelming the first time.”
Potter steps up beside him and turns a warm smile on him. “What would you like to drink?” He asks, gesturing to the menu written in chalk behind the front counter. Draco looks over to it, but there are so many options – the board is covered completely with cutesy writing declaring the names of various drinks – that he can’t decide. Tea is a treat for Draco these days.
Draco throws a crumb of toasted bagel at him. “How dare you,” he sniffs. “I’m a delight, I’ll have you know.”
His fingers loosen their grip on the book, and he allows himself to sink further into the armchair and actually start reading again. It’s interesting stuff, the theory behind wandless magic and the changes that must be adjusted for when not using a conduit. He lips move along silently as he reads a passage about the delicacy of shaping and directing magic by will alone.
Draco sighs but obligingly steps into the front room. He’s not allowed here often – Forsythe doesn’t want customers seeing him and doesn’t half trust him besides - but the man has always been self-serving first. If it’s in his best interest to let Draco close the front he will do so, trust or not. Draco locks up the cases in the front as well, sweeps and mops these floors, and wipes down the windows, door, and case-fronts. He knows that Forsythe doesn’t do all of this daily, but it’s expected when Draco’s the one closing the front. He doesn’t mind, and he works languidly – he has nowhere to be after all, and the shop is warm.
Forsythe scowls deeply. “Do you think this is St-bloody-Mungoes?” He snaps. “I’m not your personal servant Malfoy. You can bloody well deal with this shit yourself!” Draco stares into his reddened face, and swallows down his frustration.
“Hello dear,” she returns, giving him a warm smile. Draco returns the smile and then makes his way to his usual corner, humming his favourite traditional carol,
He feels his gloves tearing further, palms scraping against harsh stone. Draco can’t help his cry of pain. He turns, looking wildly over his shoulder, but nobody is looking at him. With an inhaled hiss, he pulls himself to his feet and double-checks that his hood is back up before bringing his hands up for inspection. As he suspected, the gloves have ripped and the scrape against the ground has broken through the skin, drawing bloody scratches across his palms.
“I know a better place,” Potter says. “It’s outside the park, so it’s a bit further away, but it’s worth it, trust me.”
Draco’s head is spinning. For a charm to be built into a garment and not fade as the magic wears away, it has to be woven into the fabric itself. To properly make such a coat, the charm has to be applied continuously throughout the creation process. It’s finicky, time-consuming, and very, very expensive. “Potter, this is far too much,” he protests.
He needs a distraction, something to keep his mind off it. The only thing he really has is the bloody romance novel, though. Draco reaches a shaking hand for it and flips it open listlessly, not really able to focus on any words through his shivering, but also not needing too. He’s read this book cover to cover countless times, and he knows its contents by heart. What he really needs is a nice new book, and a nice warm place to read it.
With a put-upon sigh, Draco throws himself dramatically onto his bed. He lays there a moment, staring blankly at the ceiling as he tries to ignore the hunger pangs striking at his stomach. Eventually he pulls out the novel again, flicking through it restlessly. It’s not the kind of story he would have normally picked up, but the kid in his heart who still yearns for a happy ending resonates with the tale of the heroine, beating her situation against all odds and getting the man of her dreams.
She whips around and stares at him, wide-eyed. “Look Doris, you’re disturbing the neighbours!” Barks a squat, unkept man standing just inside her doorway.
Finished with the ingredient prep, he tidies the work area, sweeps and mops the floors, and locks up the ingredient cases. As he’s finishing up, he hears the customer leave and Forsythe locking up behind him. He pokes his head into the front room and calls “I’ll be off then Mr. Forsythe!”.
He breaks off abruptly and shakes his head, embarrassed. “Sorry, it’s not a very interesting story. Ice skating of all things…”
Sings the Muggle on the wireless, and it rings in Draco’s chest. He peers up at Potter through his lashes – the other man is humming along, happily stirring his drink with a candy cane and then sticking it into his mouth, and the realization trickles down his spine, slow and warm like treacle, that he’s maybe falling a little bit in love.
“Taking you to get hot chocolate,” he says cheerily, striding assuredly along. The ease with which he carries Draco is staggering, and it makes his mouth a little dry to think about. He can feel every shift in Potter’s muscles as he’s carried, past the benches and warming huts and food stands and–
“Yes, well…” he mutters, flustered. He covers the book with his other hand, and then lifts his chin and looks back up at Potter defiantly. “It’s an interest, nothing more.” He quickly changes the subject. “What are you doing back at the library today Potter? Granger on a research kick?”
“That was amazing,” Potter says, his voice awed. A wave of warmth settles over Draco, and he looks up, surprised. “Until you master self-contained spells,” Potter says with a wink, putting away his wand. Draco’s cheeks heat further, and he tucks his face into the collar of his coat to hide the silly smile spreading across his face.
Draco bristles at his tone, although Potter is not wrong – if Draco had a wand, he would never leave it behind on so cold a day unless he knew with absolute certainty that he could keep himself warm. “I’m still learning Potter,” he replies. “I could try casting one, but I certainly wouldn’t want to cause an international incident by accidentally setting fire to your hair.”
Draco wakes up to a day like any other in the dull mundanity that is his life. He opens his eyes to a barren ceiling with cracks and spots in the plaster, and sun shining in through the holes in his tatty curtains. His tiny apartment is freezing, containing neither a fireplace nor a built-in heating charm. Winter is Draco’s least favourite time of the year; the cold seeps into his bones and threatens to freeze them still for eternity.
Potter is not lying. He is, in fact, pants at it. Draco is wobbly when he first steps out onto the ice, his skating skills rusty from disuse, but Potter is almost tragically off-balance. Draco catches his arm to steady him before he falls on his arse, laughing slightly at the way Potter clutches at him. He’s beginning to wonder if Potter has ever been on the ice at all.
Instead, he sticks his hand in his pockets and walks down to the brick wall at the dead-end of Knockturn, pushing on the slightly off-colour brick near his left kneecap to open the portal to Muggle London.
Draco lets out a snort of laughter before he can stop himself, and Potter gives a victorious smile. They’re back on the ice by now, so Draco takes pity on Potter and starts by showing him some more basics.
Draco’s stomach turns restlessly, reminding him of how perpetually hungry he is. He knows that he shouldn’t, but he can’t resist.
The street is less busy today, likely as a result of both the temperature and the early hour, but it’s still lively. Draco thankfully has no run-ins with Potter today on his way to the library.
“Oh…” he echoes quietly, his cheeks pinking again. Potter seems to have released some previously imperceptible tension, and he has a quiet confidence about him as he leans back in his seat and smiles at Draco. Draco returns the smile, then ducks his head to hide his blush and busies himself with his hot chocolate.
Draco blinks, surprised and wrongfooted. What is Ugbert playing at? He hesitates a moment, before deciding not to question it and playing along. “Two extinguishers please,” he requests.
“You got me,” says Potter. “My original plan was a house of candy, but this seemed easier.” Draco has no idea what he’s talking about, but Potter’s smile is bright and directed only at him and he finds that he doesn’t mind. Twinging with happy warmth, he pops the bit of torn-off cinnamon bun in his mouth and lets out a pleased hum, closing his eyes at the delicious flavour.
Luckily, nobody looks twice at him and he makes it to his destination with no incident. Here, even the frigid air can’t stop him from hesitating at the prospect of facing Ugbert. He takes a moment to steel himself, tamping down the urge to just turn and go back, before lifting his chin slightly and pushing open the door.
“They’re – ah – something sweet,” he explains haltingly, scratching at the back of his head. Merlin, no wonder his hair was a mess. Still, it’s an exceedingly decent thing of Potter to do, and certainly not anything he’s used to.
He watches curiously as a handsome dark-haired man yells at a pretty dark-haired woman. They don’t seem to get along. Draco feels terrible for them being trapped in that portrait together. He wonders if the subject of Muggle portraits can move between pictures as well. Maybe one of them should escape to another device.
Potter snorts a short laugh and shoves it further toward him. “I know Emory. I didn’t expect you to. Just open it?”
Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, focusing on his magic. The motions are at once familiar and new as he reaches down into the well deep inside himself and draws some forth, shaping and tuning it. He holds the form, with more ease now than he had even just this morning, and draws more magic to his command. His brows furrow in concentration as he holds the first shape and pushes the additional magic through the suspended spell, giving substance to the charm.
He touches Potter’s arm gently, hoping the other man doesn’t feel how he’s trembling, and says “Don’t worry if you need to go shopping Potter. The ice will be there tomorrow.” He hopes Potter agrees. He’d much rather chance that the weather will be warmer tomorrow. He doesn’t know how he’ll manage to get on the ice today.
Draco digs his nails into his own bloodied palm and forces down his disgust. “It is just a scratch. Nothing to worry about,” he answers shortly.
He lets out a disgruntled groan. His magic is restless at the moment, likely a result of having spent too much time around the elektrisity that Muggles used to power their lights. It tends to work magic up, and vice versa.
“What’s the matter doll?” Ugbert asks, leaning his elbow on the counter. Draco shakes himself briskly, deciding not to look a gift horse in the mouth, and he hurriedly hands over the Galleon. He gets a handful of change in return and leaves quickly before Ugbert can change his mind.
He briefly flirts with the idea of trying a warming charm for the apartment, but it’s not a serious consideration. Why potentially waste an extinguisher when he now has a perfectly warm library available to him instead?
The shop that has Granger’s wool turns out to be back on Diagon. It’s one of the new storefronts, a small building called “Walker’s Enchanted Fabrics”. It’s warm and cozy inside, and smells of new fabric in the most delightful way. Draco lets Potter get on with his errand and wanders through the various displays of fabric and wool skeins. He’s drawn to a midnight blue bolt, the fabric shot through with an icy white-blue that twinkles like stars. It’s soft to his touch, like silk, and Draco feels a melancholy ache somewhere in his chest as he runs his hand down it. It’s the type of fabric he would absolutely have coveted once upon a time, the kind that his father would have commissioned the finest of robes from at Draco’s demand.
Potter sits up straight. “Oh,” he says, his face lighting up. “That’s…brilliant. Me too, actually. Well, both really, but you know…” Ah. Draco has suspected, but never confirmed. Another piece of the puzzle Draco’s been firmly ignoring clicks into place.
“Don’t tell me what’s best!” Bellows Forsythe. He steps forward menacingly, and Draco can’t help his own step back. “Your inability to cast a simple healing charm is not my problem Malfoy. Deal with this.” His face twists into a mean sneer. “And don’t think I’m going to pay you for any time you miss,” he adds in a hiss.
Ugbert chuckles. “I don’t think so,” he breathes right against Draco’s ear, grinding his hips forward. Draco feels his erection pressing against him and quivers. He quickly brings his hands up and turns his palms to Ugbert.
He tries some of the new techniques that he’d studied yesterday, but it doesn’t come immediately to him. It takes a few tries before he actually manages to cast the spell but, to his great relief, the new technique does expend less effort. It doesn’t improve the potency of the spell though – the room warms enough to be only just bearable – so Draco makes a mental note to find a way to improve that.
Draco blinks up at him, then nods. He does trust Potter. He squirms, vying to get down, but Potter just tightens his grip and holds fast. Draco wrinkles his brow at him.
Draco hums, steadying him gently. “I’m afraid you’ll have to make an appointment,” he says. “I’m very busy you see.”
The day only gets colder, however, and once he’s shivering so hard that the words in the book are impossible to make out, Draco gives in. He sets the book aside and tugs off his gloves with a sigh, furrowing his brow in concentration as he feels for the magic deep inside himself. It takes a moment to corral it and draw it out, doing his best to shape it as he whispers the incantation.
The owl swoops in immediately, offering him its leg while darting looks around his shabby little apartment. “Sorry, I don’t have any treats for you,” Draco apologizes as he unties the satchel. The owl hoots disapprovingly, but thankfully it’s too well-trained to peck at him. Raptor beaks are sharp, and he doesn’t fancy having bloodied fingers.
That’s a surprise – he’s slept in. It’s not something he normally does; usually he wakes with the sun or sometimes, in winter, before it if the cold wakes him first. He hasn’t a wand to provide an alarm, so his internal clock has had to step up to the plate to prevent him from missing work. He can’t deny that it’s nice, though, and he feels incredibly well rested.
It’s after one such excursion, once he’s back to pouring over his book, that a shadow suddenly falls across the cramped text on the page. He glances up, expecting it to be Potter arrived early, but to his surprise it’s the librarian standing there, her wrinkled old face smiling at him over a steaming teacup.
“Here. It’s just scratches, as I’ve said,” he says. Ugbert pulls back, looking down at his palms. He looks almost disappointed as he turns away.
“She and you both, surely.” Draco says finally, because Potter seems to be downplaying his role in all this.
He opens his eyes after a moment, sighing into the calm of the night as his stomach rumbles restlessly. He smiles slightly. He’ll have something better than stale toast tonight at least.
“Do you always ask for favours with an insult?” Draco wonders. “No wonder you’re being banned from stores.”
“Alright, Mr. Sass, just go sit down,” he says. Draco smirks but turns to comply, while Potter approaches the counter. He hears, from behind him, the girl at the counter saying “Harry! Back so soon?”, and Potter answering with something too quiet for Draco to hear.
There’s nothing to hang around the flat for, and he’ll have to cast a heating charm if he does besides, so he steps out into the hallway and jams his door shut again. It’s very early still – the sun has not yet risen – and Knockturn is empty but for those few straggling to or from work and the usual selection of shady characters who quite go away.
He swallows, and forces himself to look away, back down at his book. Potter is quiet for a while, and Draco feels the weight of his gaze heavy upon his skin.
Potter comes up to him, frowning, and takes his hand. “Look Emory. It’s really no more than I do for any of my other friends. Please, it’s not a big deal.”
“You and Granger,” he clarifies. “She was in the magical law section yesterday. I know that the house-elf bill is passed. What is it now?”
“Let me,” he says, draping the scarf about Draco’s neck and sliding the toque over his hair. Draco looks up at him, eyes wide, and Potter meets his gaze steadily. His cheeks are flushed red against his bronzed skin, his hair thick and tousled, and those lovely green eyes are bright, reflecting the warm yellow lights that decorate the park. Draco feels his heart skip and he quickly looks away, cheeks reddening.
“I will need to see the injuries, so that I may determine which potion will be best,” he says. His hands are now massaging at Draco’s ass, and Draco shudders in revulsion.
And then add to that that Squibs have a harder time getting well-paying jobs. Even for a position like caretaker, most employers would sooner hire someone able to use magic, since they’d be more efficient. It’s not impossible for a Squib to get a well-paid job, of course, but it’s much harder.
“Well it isn’t going to fit me,” he says stubbornly, crossing his arms over his chest and glaring at Draco sternly.
He guides them out of the library and into Diagon, where the freezing air finally wakes Draco the rest of the way. Merlin, he’s so mortified. He’s never going to fall asleep in public again.
“Call me Harry,” Potter insists. Draco frowns – that’s decidedly too weird. It’s not as though they’re going to see each other again anyway.
“No, thank you,” Draco replies politely. He has no plans here, just the wish of a warm refuge and something to read to pass the time. He walks through the library, running his eyes along the shelves and taking his time.
Turning, Draco makes his way to the only bench in the park so that he can sit and eat his supper. When he gets there, however, he finds that it is not empty for the first time in all the years he’s been coming to this park. There, on the bench, are a woman and a little girl, huddled together and shivering under a blanket. They are gaunt in a way that Draco recognizes, that he’s seen in the mirror during the bad months, and they’re clearly no more equipped for winter than Draco in his threadbare coat.
Harry grinned at Draco, eyes dark with lust and hopefulness. He lifted one of Draco's legs, kissing behind his knee, then up to his thigh, then higher and higher...He stopped to suck a hickey onto the junction between Draco's thigh and crotch- Draco moaned Harry's name, head thrown back.
Fortunately enough, Draco’s favourite spot was not yet occupied. It was the best one here, right by the window that faced the park and buildings near it aligning perfectly with the busy street in front of it. He quietly sat down as he pulled out his phone and called the one person who would hate it if he didn’t update her everyday, Pansy.
“What was what? I didn’t tell him anything and I have been nothing but cordial all afternoon!” She was making more of an effort than Draco thought she would and while he was grateful for it, she also had a reputation for a terrible secret keeper.
Only on a third round of his chaotically organised room did he notice the tiny white piece of paper that laid flat under a paper weight. Draco grabbed the note and read it as fast he could. As he reached the end, a heavy sigh of relief released from his chest. Every word made him feel better and before he knew it, Draco had read it five times. The note was placed in the empty space of his wallet, a newfound attachment was created for a piece of paper that Draco wouldn’t give away for the world. In an effort to keep his spirits high, Draco went to his wardrobe and picked out his most comfortable set of clothes: blue jeans, a black turtleneck, a belt and his best pair of clunky boots. An afternoon alone is exactly what he needed, or so Draco tried to convince himself.
“Um, two actually. I wasn’t at home for two days and I met a guy. He’s absolutely wonderful but I don’t know so much about him and he doesn’t know so much about me. I’m so scared but he was also the reason I didn’t have nightmares this weekend. Maybe it was the comfort of someone near me that made me calm through the night or the thought of him finding out about who I am, that scared me too much for me to show him that side of myself.”
“I’ll be right back, sit down and turn off the lights.” Deciding to give Harry the benefit of the doubt, Draco did as told and quietly waited, gently rocking back and forth when Harry started to take too long.
, but it still made him feel as if he were stuffed full of butterflies when he thought of how intense their conversations were getting, how intensely Harry had already started to look at him. How anything Harry said made him turn so pink that Pansy would have called him “Peaches”. Before the water could get any colder, Draco stepped out and his thoughts fluttered about as the steam settled down.
