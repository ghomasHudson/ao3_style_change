Grant rolled his eyes at Bellatrix suggesting she was going to make him the official shake maker. “I’ll only do it for the children. It’s bad isn’t it? The abuse?” He questioned knowing that Bellatrix probably wouldn’t divulge the case to much and usually when he asked Bellatrix about a case, he typically got either a snarky answer, a nod, or shake of the head.
“I got sent to St. Mungo’s and saw your nephew.” Harry said politely taking a sip of the tea which was just the way he liked it. “Thank you for the tea.”
“I don’t care.” Harry said after swallowing the large Paracetamol tablets the idea of the medication being liquid was great. He didn’t even care if it wasn’t flavored it was much easier to get down.
Hi guys I hope you like this idea. Thank you for reading and any kudos, comments, and bookmarks. I really appreciate it. :)
“You aren’t my boss. I don’t have to go anywhere with you.” She retorted going back to talking to Ethel.
growl softly, suddenly furious with the witch. She'd known all this time, and she hadn't said anything? She'd had ample opportunity whilst delivering the food and wine they'd sent back and forth, not to mention the other small gifts they'd exchanged. Like his manuscript.
They were silent through a memory of a dingy pub in Hogsmeade. Draco closed his eyes when the memory shifted again; unable to watch one of his closest friends die again.
Still, any of their fellow seventh years – or one of the professors – could wander in at any time. It made Hermione’s plan dangerous enough to heighten her arousal.
"I can't help it," Harry muttered, his brow creased in a deep frown. "He's so young. We should have held him out a year. He's only ten!"
do you love? Did you love your dear, departed daddy? Did you love him even after you found out he had raped and killed my
Harry stuck a spatula in the pocket of his apron, whistling softly to himself as he opened the oven door and checked on his frittata. It was browning nicely around the edges, but a deft shake of the skillet's handle proved it wasn't set in the middle yet. He shoved it back inside, letting the door slam as he turned to check on the coffee.
They'd been trying to explain the rules of courtship to Hermione for the last ten minutes, but she was still struggling to grasp everything.
Ginny stroked Freddie's soft cheek, handing the sleeping baby off to Daphne when the other witch held her arms out expectantly. She sighed and stretched, grateful for the break. Freddie had been restless today, and she'd cried every time someone put her down.
Kingsley cleared his throat, tapping the contract once again. It rolled up into a tight scroll and flew into his hand, which had been outstretched for it. He took one look at the two men in front of him before quickly stepping away, heading toward the Floo.
Harry's expression sobered suddenly, and he studied Draco carefully. "Have you watched the memories, yet?"
He moaned when Draco laughed, the vibrations sending shivers of pleasure through him. Just as he approached his orgasm, the wet heat disappeared. Harry's eyes flew open, his stare accusing as Draco sat back on his heels.
She closed her eyes as he dressed, and they chatted about the book and the changes Abigail had proposed. She questioned him about the scattered manuscript, relieved to hear he'd tripped and knocked it off the desk, not thrown it in anger as she had assumed. It was believable – Harry was a very clumsy drunk.
Thanks to all the wonderful readers who left such enthusiastic and supportive reviews all throughout MLQ. They really motivated me to keep writing and updating as quickly as I could! I'm still in awe of the number of you who followed (and reviewed!) this story – I'm so happy you found MLQ and stuck around until the end! *grins*
"Aunt Hermione said to tell you they'll all be waiting for you back at Grimmauld Place," Teddy said, shifting nervously from one foot to the other. He agreed with their plan, but he worried what affect it would have on Caleum. He'd be the one to bear the brunt of it, Teddy knew.
Draco laughed out loud, shaking his head at the blonde. He couldn't believe she'd asked that. Then again, it
"He's shocked, understandably," Neville answered after a moment, feeling better after seeing Harry was actually worried about the other man. "I think it dredged up a lot of painful memories for him. He tries not to think about – about that time of his life. Nothing that happened was his choice. Hell, you know that. You were there at his trial."
The darker wizard paced the room ignoring the slightly amused smirk Draco shot him. He'd been trying to convince the man that there was nothing going on between Potter and Smith for days now, and he hadn't made any progress.
Pansy's brow furrowed, but she didn't speak, apparently afraid she couldn't without violating the vow.
"You mentioned you were a sap for Christmas once," Harry said, his tongue darting out to lick at a stray drop of whisky on his lip. He knew exactly how the motion would affect Draco, and he allowed himself a quick smirk. He was glad he wasn't the only one with a painful erection.
He groaned as thoughts of Severus led to thoughts of Gryffin's confession. He was fairly sure the professor who had so affected Gryffin was none other than Severus Snape, Potions Master extraordinaire. His erection surged with renewed interest at the thought of a younger Gryffin furiously wanking in some deserted alcove. Draco had never had any fantasies about the man, but he did concede that Sev's voice had definitely been wank-worthy.
"What?" Ginny turned, her lips curving when she caught sight of Hermione. She looked spectacular, and even though Ginny had just helped her get dressed minutes ago, she couldn't help but admire the picture Hermione in a wedding dress made. "Nothing. Just excited."
“Mmm,” she answered, deepening the kiss and rubbing against him. The sensations from the slippery leather were delicious.
Draco's eyes glazed over as he noticed the front of Harry's apron was tented as well, swallowing hard at the sexy sight in front of him. He assumed they'd be living at the chateau after they were married, but Draco vowed to find a way to make Harry cook naked for him again. Maybe they could keep this house just for that purpose?
"I'm not going to hex him," Draco said shortly, resuming his pacing without regard for the wizard now standing in his path.
Fifteen minutes later, Harry was blissfully comfortable, back in his own clothes and enjoying a pint at the Leaky Cauldron. Ron had run off to find Hermione, who was discussing last-minute changes with the florist, and the two planned to meet him back at the pub for a quick dinner before Flooing home.
As much as he wanted to leave, Draco knew it would be rude to disrupt the board meeting. He'd finished his presentation – and successfully garnered both the zoning permit and the alcohol license – and was now listening to Potter drone on contesting some rule about displaying animated adverts that was having a negative effect on the joke shop's business.
Harry nodded, taking Draco's words for what they were – a gentle warning that his son would always come first. That was fine with Harry, reassuring even. Draco was a great father. It was one of the things Harry loved most about him.
Harry stepped out from behind the largest Christmas tree, grinning from ear to ear. Draco's heart stuttered at the sight of the wizard standing before him, soft white snowflakes sprinkled in his messy dark hair, quickly melting into shiny, iridescent droplets. He was wearing a Gryffindor scarf and a heavy cloak like Draco's, holding three pairs of ice skates in his bare hands.
Draco smiled at his son's one-track mind. Not two minutes ago he had been begging to leave France, and now he was content to stay so long as he got to eat on a blanket.
He tapped his shoe against the floor, the steady tattoo of noise increasing in tempo as his irritation grew. He looked at his watch again. Fourteen minutes late. Draco thought about pouring himself a drink, but decided against it. Whatever Harry was planning would surely test their willpower, and he needed a clear head for that.
"Er, there was an accident in the interrogation room. I had a vial of Hair Thickening Potion in my pocket, and it, er, fell out onto the floor as I was leaving," Ron said, his face red. "I, ah, dropped a bottle of Veritaserum, too."
Harry grinned as he looked around the dingy bar, thoughts of his chat with Sly pushing to the forefront of his mind. He hadn't been lying when he'd admitted to coming to the pub for Single's Night, nor had he exaggerated how horrible the experience had been.
Seeking a partner who enjoys solitude and is comfortable with silence and introspection. Discretion is expected and will be given in return. I am fit and expect my partner to be as well. My interests include travel, Quidditch, intellectual pursuits and gourmet food and drink. I enjoy witty banter and intelligent conversation; my partner must be able to respond in kind. I am financially self-sufficient and require the same of my partner. Must like children. #11837
Draco laughed bitterly, pushing away from the fireplace so he could pace the large room. He stepped over a pile of crayons and toys without noticing, his eyes unseeing as he moved.
Harry moaned, his hands scrambling for purchase against Draco's shoulders, his thighs burning with the effort of his enthusiastic thrusts. He knew he was close, and he told Draco so, nearly unintelligible words whispered against swollen lips and swallowed almost as quickly as they had been uttered.
in his possession when he'd been arrested, ripped from his parents' side in the Great Hall the morning after Harry killed Voldemort. His frown deepened as he thought about the desolate month he'd spent in the wizarding prison, cold and terrified despite the absence of Dementors. He shivered, his insides clenching as he thought about his father, dying alone in a dank, dirty cell.
"Neville needs you in the greenhouse," she said, settling on the floor beside Cal, heedless of the wrinkles the position made in her silk dress.
“S-she left a b-bit ago,” he stammered, his face heating both with the lie and the fabulous things the witch in question was currently doing to his cock.
funny. But what are we going to do about it? They're getting more and more attached, and it's going to blow up in their faces when they find out."
"It's not bad, Uncle Nev, I swear," he said earnestly, his grey eyes beseeching. "Please don't tell father or Harry we were arguing with Uncle Sev. It makes father angry, and Uncle Sev doesn't really like Harry anyway, so I don't want to make them fight."
"I love –" he bit his tongue, his teeth sinking into the soft flesh. The shooting pain was a welcome relief from the torment in his skull, giving him something new to concentrate on. He could feel the effects of the Veritaserum beginning to wane.
Harry followed Draco down the corridor, shucking off his heavy cloak and jumper as they walked. It had been easy to forget it was the middle of summer while in the wintry paradise he, Neville and Blaise had created in the greenhouse, but it was undeniably warm in the chateau. They'd left the other two wizards to focus on setting the greenhouse to rights, both of them promising to behave themselves in the absence of their chaperones.
"Sev," Draco said again, his voice pleading. Harry's fingers were wrapped around his cock, which was quickly filling with blood despite his best efforts to discourage it. He did
. Running into Potter and Smith in that restaurant had been a blessing. It had saved him from doing irreparable harm to his family. After all, Potter was hardly the all-powerful savior everyone lauded him as. He couldn't possibly keep news of their relationship out of the paper, or protect Cal if his existence was revealed.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR, along with my undying gratitude for introducing us to these two beautiful boys! Thanks again to Kamerreon for the beta!
"Is he?" Charlie asked, twisting so he could watch the darker wizard advance across the floor. They'd actually become friends, galvanized by the mortifying experience they'd shared. "Did you invite him?"
He shifted closer to Draco, their hands still tightly joined. "It is what it is, Kings," Harry said with a nervous laugh. He just wanted this to be over with. "Let's just do it, shall we?"
"It'll take us awhile to complete, if we open a bottle every year, but it'll be worth it, won't it?" He asked, his heart thumping painfully while he waited for Harry's reaction.
"Draco!" He hissed, wary of being overheard. Narcissa's and Cal's bedrooms weren't very far from theirs, and most of the guest rooms were full, too. Most of their friends had chosen to come a day early to help with wedding preparations. "You can't just leave!"
"No Hangover Potion?" Draco asked, Summoning one of the sandwiches from the bag. He'd worked through lunch, and he was starving.
Draco had put off checking his online dating e-mail account all morning. He knew if the mystery man had responded, he'd spend the day obsessing about how to answer the e-mail. If he hadn't responded, then he'd spend the day obsessing over why he hadn't answered yet. His schedule was too full for that sort of nonsense, so he'd avoided it altogether.
"A life debt," Draco said flatly, his gaze trained on Harry's lifeless body in Hagrid's arms. "You testified for us because of a life debt."
Hannah, not oblivious to the waves of fury rolling off Harry, stood quickly, wrapping an arm around Harry's waist. He wondered who she was protecting, him or her fellow Hufflepuff.
He heard Draco laugh behind him, leaning back into his husband's warmth. He angled his head back, kissing Draco on the mouth. Cal protested, earning himself a loud, smacking kiss on each cheek from his fathers.
"I hadn't intended to have children. I thought it might be best to let the Malfoy name die out with me," Draco said, shrugging lightly. "I still don't know if it was premeditated on her part or not, but after we'd been married a little over a year she announced she was pregnant."
Harry flinched when Bill leveled his wand at him, swallowing as a wave of nausea overtook him. He wasn't so far gone that he didn't recognize the Sobriety spell the man hit him with, grimacing as the uncomfortable sensation spread through his body. He thought he might vomit for a moment, but thankfully fought the urge.
Draco followed, but paused at the door, his horrified gaze locked on the stained mattress in the far corner, the single, bare bulb hanging from the sloping, cobweb-covered ceiling and the neat row of cleaning supplies stacked against the wall.
"Er, sorry?" he offered lamely, flinching when he heard a loud crash from upstairs. Apparently Ron was awake.
"I have no words for what you've done for us," Draco said softly, and Harry could feel his frustration at not being able to thank the woman properly through their bond. He sent back a pulse of love and excitement, hoping to calm his husband. "This is more than I would ever have asked of anyone. Thank you."
Harry looked up when Narcissa swept into the room. She still looked every bit the haughty pure-blood he'd thought she was, though he'd learned the public persona was quite different from the caring and warm
"It will be," he promised, his eyes widening as the Nutrient Potion finally took effect, transforming the plant from sickly to robust. "It will be."
so the throng of reporters who had gathered on the front step could hear him easily. Hermione had called a press conference after last night's Sorting so Harry and Draco could control the information that got out. They were having it at Grimmauld Place because neither Harry nor Draco planned to reveal where they had been living for the past five years, keeping the chateau a safe place for their family to retreat from the public eye.
Harry read it over again, unsure of whether to be worried or relieved. Half of what they had done? Had he done something stupid?
He sighed, nodding. She didn't understand why he insisted on keeping the penname, and he did feel a bit guilty about it. He didn't need the money – not with the Black and Potter vaults and properties that had come to him when he came of age – but it would make a world of difference to her and Ron. James Evans was a well-known name, and a fairly big pull. But as Harry Potter, he'd easily double the profits the books made.
Sometime over the last few hours, Potter had lost his tuxedo jacket, and Draco's stomach clenched at the sight of the man in his shirt-sleeves, cuffs rolled up to expose lightly tanned forearms that were ropey with muscle. He'd been watching those arms wrap around countless people all evening long, puzzled and disturbed by the jealousy he felt every time Potter led another witch out onto the floor or hugged a friend or acquaintance.
Hermione shrugged negligently, chewing her lip as she thought about her next move. She and Teddy were playing a magical version of Clue, and it had come time for her to guess.
Draco would never be completely sure if it was in reaction to Harry's starkly honest and beautiful words or a simple physical reaction to the dark-haired wizard's channel constricting almost painfully around him as he came, but Draco followed Harry into the abyss of a mind-numbing orgasm. As he thrust up violently into Harry, a kaleidoscope of color bursting behind his eyelids as he came, Draco would have been shocked to know that similar promises of love, devotion and loyalty were falling from his lips as well.
"I'm going with you," he said, nodding to one of the Aurors across the corridor to let him know everything was alright. "I've got permission to do whatever is necessary to find Cartwell, and I have a feeling he's going to be going after Malfoy's son."
"The meeting of the Diagon Alley Zoning Board will come to order," a pinched-face witch intoned, banging a gavel against the heavy wood platform she and four others were seated behind.
he thought, popping open a bottle of Butterbeer. He'd prefer something stronger, but he wanted all his wits about him when he spoke with Sly online. Harry perked up at the thought, taking a long draw from the bottle as he booted his laptop.
"I can't expose Cal like that," Draco repeated, but the words sounded less sure than they had before. He knew it was only a matter of time before he buckled to his own desire and agreed to meet with Harry, and he hated himself for his weakness.
Harry had passed on the dessert, choosing instead to have a third glass of the smoky Pinot Noir Sly sent to accompany the meal. It paired perfectly with the tender grilled salmon with a slightly spicy chili Hollandaise sauce that had been the main course. The meal began with delicate buckwheat blinis piled with caviar and crème fraîche, the perfect combination of salty and creamy, followed by a rich leek soup. Sly's choice of Pinot Noir had gone perfectly with each course, surprising Harry. The light-bodied wine was one of his favorites, but he had never paired it with fish before. The smoky spiciness of the wine had been the perfect complement, however, and Harry let his mouthful of wine rest of his palate for a moment before swallowing, picking out notes of tart cranberry and spicy clove.
Harry blushed, reaching up to adjust his glasses, his hand faltering when he realized he wasn't wearing them. He studied the pale hand in front of him, with its manicured nails and light dusting of blond hair.
He tried to keep the bitterness out of his voice, pressing on. "She's gorgeous. Tall, olive skin, black hair." He laughed. "I never realized she bore a resemblance to you, but she does. I'm grateful for it now though, because Cal could easily pass for your son."
Harry whimpered when Draco's talented mouth began to move in tandem with his fingers. Up, down. In, out. Oh, Merlin, now he was swirling his tongue over the head of Harry's swollen cock, his fingers mimicking the sweeping motion inside him, brushing over the sensitive spot that never failed to make Harry howl.
Caleum was fine, thank Merlin. Draco insisted that he remain at the Amboise chateau, which was where he spent most of his time, despite the fact that he had begged to be allowed to come home with Draco. Draco wanted to keep him out of the papers, to keep their relationship a secret for as long as he could. He didn't want to be associated with Caleum in the wizarding press, and he took all manner of precautions to prevent it. The chateau was Unplottable, and Caleum always used the Floo when he came to Malfoy Manor. Draco had managed to keep him a secret for five years, and he prayed to all the Gods each day that his luck continued to hold.
"You know it, too," she said, her eyes sad. "You're half-way to in love with him, and you don't even know who he is."
"It's no big deal," Draco continued his gaze still locked on his son, who was attempting to stand on the broom, which hovered a meter or so off the ground. He'd already cast several Cushioning charms on the ground, but he'd intervene if Cal tried it any higher. "So what? Gryffin is Potter. I'd have found out next weekend anyway. Yesterday was unpleasant, but it saved me an awkward date at any rate."
The stylist nodded, shortening Harry's blond hair with a few deft snips. Flaxen strands fell to the floor, the uneven cut transforming Harry's face. He watched, fascinated, as the shape of the new cut emerged. He
, he thought, turning abruptly as the rough sound echoed through the corridor. It sounded like – snoring? Coming from the bathroom? He pushed the door open, ready to Stun or Disarm whomever he found there if necessary.
a surprise. Our lives have been interlinked since before we were even born, so perhaps the soul bond shouldn't have shocked us so much."
I'll be focusing on finishing the WIP "Resolutions" now, as well as adding chapters to "Hogwarts: A Hedonistic History". You can find both of those fics – and more than a dozen other H/D stories – on my author page. I also hope to start posting another multi-chaptered H/D fic in a few weeks. It's tentatively titled "Honeymoon", but that's not set in stone yet. It'll feature jilted!Harry and lawyer!Draco. Hope you'll all take a look when it starts posting!
The dress robes hid his arousal, and he'd been slipping away periodically to make good use of the arousal-dampening spell Sev had taught him all those years ago. Still, he'd been uncomfortable all day. He'd popped into his potions lab just before lunch, hoping to brew the antidote, but found that Harry had gotten there first, removing several of the key ingredients he needed to make it. The black-haired menace had even raided Cal's junior potions lab, making sure there was nothing there that could help Draco in his current state.
Harry laughed, pressing a kiss to Draco's warm, wet neck. His eyes were closed, and if he wasn't careful, Harry worried he might fall asleep right there.
"I'm sorry you had to waste an afternoon, Weasley," Draco said, and Ron marveled that the man actually
Harry groaned, using the flat of his tongue to sweep over one of Draco's small nipples. "Can't wait," he whispered, the rush of air against his wet nipple making Draco shiver.
He slid a finger over the heavy wax seal, smiling at its conspicuous blankness. It must mean that Gryffin was a member of one of the old families – sealing correspondence with wax was something only Lords and Ladies did these days, though they usually used their family crest. He shrugged, running the pad of his finger over the smooth surface of the satiny wax. Gryffin had mentioned he was a Muggle-raised half-blood, but he was obviously familiar with the customs of pureblood society.
Draco looked at him sternly. Blaise's beautifully tailored clothes made his current pose even more indolent.
Harry grinned when he saw Malfoy's composure falter. His heart skipped a beat when he saw Malfoy's pale skin heat with a blush, and his mind was unwillingly drawn to the thought that this must be what the blond looked like when he was aroused – the peachy-hued skin, the parted lips, the fast rise and fall of his chest.
"Wait," Draco said, his voice thick. He turned toward Harry, searching out both of his hands. He held them tightly, staring directly in to the concerned green eyes. "You know I've done this before," he said, concentrating hard on not stumbling over the words. It felt important to get it out there. "These memories you want me to see – I assume they're your past. Mine might not be as horrific as yours, but I still think you should know."
"Unnecessary, but thank you," he said, unsure if the blush he could feel heating his cheeks showed through the glamour.
He grinned cheekily, holding his fists up and waving them menacingly. She laughed at the ridiculous picture – Harry hated violence. It was one of the reasons he'd been injured so badly before he quit the Auror department – he rarely used spells that could do any real harm, even when others weren't holding back against him.
"You'll be making something special for dinner, I wager, to go with the fancy new wine," Blaise said, his eyes on his friend, wondering how a simple bottle of wine could give Draco such a wistful expression.
"Not at all," Neville answered, swinging an arm around Draco's shoulder in easy camaraderie. "It's completely necessary. The wards monitor the temperature, so I have enough time to cast the appropriate shielding spells in case of frost."
Harry squinted as he looked at the table in front of him, tilting his head as Hermione marked the chart with her wand. Her Aunt Betty would be uncomfortable sitting with the witches and wizards in attendance, she decided, tapping the parchment again. Her aunt's name appeared, joining the names of several other relatives at a table near the back of the room.
Draco's hands fisted at his sides as he paced in front of the Floo, waiting for Pansy and Oliver to come through. He'd been seething since yesterday, when he saw what the interview that idiot Smith had given to the papers.
Neville watched him silently, a trick he'd learned from years spent among Slytherins. He was sure Draco would start talking again to fill the gap in the conversation. He tried the approach often with Daphne, with mixed results. It seemed to work best when the other person was hiding something, and Neville was sure Draco was.
, Hermione. Namely getting Ron there on time with his robes on the right way. Everything will go beautifully," he said, ducking when she threw something at him. The Muggle pen bounced off the wall, skittering across the floor.
"Mr. Potter, I have a delivery from another one of my clients. We'd usually send something like this via owl, but the basket is rather heavy," she said, shifting her grip on the handle. Harry reached out without thinking, taking the basket from her to ease her burden. She sighed in relief.
"You can be such a stubborn prick," Blaise spat, rolling his eyes as he watched Draco drink himself into oblivion for the third night running.
"Are both presenters here?" Wedgewick asked, the gleam in his eye worrying Draco. The other person must be influential as well, to have garnered that look from the notorious social schemer.
Harry's eyebrows rose at the complicated magic. It was perfect: rare, prestigious, ancient – a very worthy gift. He nodded to Neville, who grabbed Hermione's arm, pulling her toward the door. If Harry was set on buying it – and Neville agreed, it was perfect for Draco – there was no sense in letting Hermione nag.
Ron shrugged, still not meeting Draco's eye. He didn't pull away, but he didn't return the gesture, either.
Draco nearly came undone at the word, snapping his hips back and thrusting harder, deeper. He bent Harry nearly in half, pounding into him as he leaned down to claim his mouth as well. Harry supported himself as best he could on raised elbows, his lips just barely able to meet Draco's in an unsatisfactory kiss.
Cal shrieked, his giggles joining Harry's deeper laughter as they squirmed in the snow. Draco couldn't believe what he was watching, shocked his son seemed to get on so well with a man he'd just met. Of course, Harry
"We're coming in," Harry called, holding Draco's hand tightly in his own as they made their way to the study. He was both relieved and alarmed to see Ron standing next to her, both of them nearly pressed against the wall.
Hermione turned her attention back to the computer screen in front of her. Harry's ad was far from polished, but then again, so was Harry.
"That's Harry," Neville said, forcing a chuckle to try to lighten the mood. They wouldn't get anywhere if Draco was in this kind of mood. Best to leave it for awhile.
"Eloquent as always," Snape sneered, managing to look condescending and superior even as a painting. Harry's eyes flashed as he stared the oil portrait down.
"And do you, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, Head of the House of Malfoy, Heir to the House of Black, swear on your magic that you have no other bonds or entanglements that would prevent you from legally wedding Harry James Potter?"
Harry laughed, waggling his eyebrows suggestively as he advanced, knowing Draco would have no choice but to step back and let him through the doorway. It was the first time he'd been grateful for the no-touching rule.
"No, really. Just think about it, Pans. If they could just get past their rivalry – and if Draco and
"Are you ready, mate?" Ron asked, and Draco had to bite back a laugh. He never thought he'd see the day when Ron Weasley called him
Draco made a face, groaning as he lowered his head to the desk. Perhaps Blaise had been right when he told Draco that only wankers posted to these online services. His shoulders tightened, but he blew out a breath and forced himself to relax. They couldn't all be losers. After all,
"Ginny, lovely to see you," Harry said pleasantly, enjoying Ron's discomfort at being caught out bad mouthing Slytherins. It wasn't something Ginny stood for these days, even in jest.
Harry's mouth fell open at the statement, his eyes flashing with anger even as Draco reached out to grab his arm.
she was pregnant with their next child. She had no reason to be scribbling furiously like all the others.
And then he was gone. Draco let himself sit on the floor, not caring if the lightweight wool trousers he wore were ruined by the ash. His pulse was racing, and he could feel his hands tremble at his sides. His mind started screaming about how inadvisable, how foolish, this would be but he couldn't stop himself. It was just after 8 p.m. and Draco hurried from his study, intent on tucking Cal into bed before Harry came through.
Stormy grey eyes met his, and suddenly Harry felt like lying on a sofa in his drawing room in a tangled heap of half-clothed limbs, with the late afternoon sun casting weak patterns across the old rug he kept meaning to replace but never quite managed to, was in the most romantic spot imaginable. There was no soft music, but the harsh and rapid breathing of his lover, fiancé, bond mate,
They both looked up at the sound of feet slapping against the wood floor, loud in the otherwise silent corridor. Ron turned the corner, red-faced and panting.
Blaise choked back a laugh, and even Draco's grimly set lips twitched. Narcissa must have been in rare form to call Draco an arsehole in front of her young grandson.
Blaise kissed the tear tracks on Cal's face, making silly smacking noises as he did. Encouraged by the boy's reluctant laughter, he shifted him, holding him upside down so he could tickle his belly with his free hand.
Seamus waited until the Healer left, asking the silent Auror to wait outside while he did a physical examination. The Auror left reluctantly, obviously loath to let Draco out of his sight.
Harry groaned, a thin film of sweat covering his bicep, which tightened as he gripped his cock harder. He bit his lip, his breathing harsh as he concentrated on keeping his rhythm steady as he stroked and squeezed his aching cock.
Cal hopped down from the ledge, his sock feet barely making any noise as he snuck up on his godfather. Blaise was napping, sprawled uncomfortably on a Conjured sofa while Neville guarded the only entrance to the small cave.
He sat back down, logging into his regular email, dashing off a note to Theo to see if he and Ginny would like to join him for his standing dinner date with Cal tomorrow. He had some questions for them.
"You're quite welcome," Kingsley said, uncrossing his legs. He'd been in the drawing room for nearly half an hour, and he was getting restless. "I must admit, I was surprised when Harry invoked the ancient courting laws. A brilliant move on his part, though. He'll be able to control what information gets out about his relationship with Mr. Malfoy, even after their marriage."
"Ready?" Draco asked, his mouth watering at the sight of Harry standing in front of him, completely naked and impossibly aroused.
"It – he shouldn't watch it now," he said carefully, meeting Blaise's eye. "It's important, but it's not something he should have to deal with today. Not with – not with everything else."
Cal craned his neck, looking around the small grotto. His eyes traveled over the table and chairs, the magical fire, spelled to be smokeless, and his Uncle Neville, who was just barely visible in the distance at the mouth of the cave.
"I'll Owl you later to fill you in," Draco said, nodding to the wizard before he closed the connection. He had some paperwork he needed to look over if he was to present this himself.
As uncomfortable and frustrated as he was, Draco couldn't help but be proud of his husband. It had been an entirely Slytherin prank, and he'd executed it well. He just hoped Harry gave him the antidote before they had to walk down the aisle. He'd rather not have to hobble.
Harry swallowed, feeling his emotions surge. This wasn't the place for this conversation, and he needed time to think things through before he said anything he'd regret. Like begging Malfoy to take him home and fuck him.
Luna nodded serenely, making a note on her legal pad. He was sure it was either a doodle of one of her mythical creatures or a reminder to pick something up at the market – after all, she already
. He wanted to make sure he knew everything possible about the blond. What he learned left him with more questions than answers, though, especially about his failed marriage and subsequent two-year disappearance.
Draco hesitated, but clicked on the identification number. He keyed in his username and password, giving the site permission to contact the mystery man with Draco's own post. It wouldn't give his personal information, since his was also a high-profile membership, but it would give the man his e-mail address as well as a copy of his own ad.
Draco saw a thin blue light snake around them, circling them once and evaporating, leaving only a silvery mist behind.
Harry glanced down at the papers in front of him, edits he'd already perused the night before. He'd been unable to sleep, even after his 2 a.m. wank, so he'd brewed some coffee and worked instead.
"To skate," Harry confirmed, answering Draco's nearly forgotten question. The blond's mind went absolutely blank at the electric thrill of Harry's warm breath against his skin, all cohesive thought fleeing at the tantalizing almost-contact. Draco heard someone – probably Blaise – clear his throat across the ice, reminding him of their presence. "To date. To get to know each other. To share our lives."
"I know," Draco said softly, his lips curving into a slight smile. It was just another way Harry was trying to protect him, and he wouldn't let himself get irritated with the man because of it. He met Harry's gaze head-on. "I want you there when I do."
"I know that Neville is a loyal friend to both Potter and myself," Draco cut in, earning himself a glare. "As such, he feels it is his responsibility to repair what he erroneously perceives as a rift in my relationship with Potter."
"A formality," Ron said, rolling his eyes and making it clear that he considered the whole exercise to be a farce.
Draco pushed back from his desk, frustrated. They'd been working out the details of a major land sale in Wales for weeks, and the seller had just dropped out. Added to the pounding headache he had this morning – which he hadn't taken a Hangover potion for, letting himself suffer as a reminder not to overdo it again with whisky – the morning had been a complete and utter disaster.
Harry watched her go, feeling sympathy for the greeting he knew Ron was going to get, and without the benefit of the Hangover Potion Harry'd had. He let himself relax into the chair, breathing a sigh of relief. His fears had been ridiculous. He
Thankfully, he hadn't been awakened by one of the erotic dreams he'd been having about Harry this time. He felt his heart speed up at the memory of the dreams, which had become more explicit as the courtship wore on.
Harry's lips parted, and he swallowed dutifully. Neville reached behind him, two more vials in his hand. "Again," he said, pushing the vial against Harry's lips. "One more," he said, tipping the contents of the last vial into Harry's mouth.
“F-fine,” he managed, his hands clamped like vises against the bottom of the chair to keep himself from squirming even more.
Harry jumped up after reading his e-mail, hurrying to the fireplace and throwing in a pinch of Floo dust.
"Drink," Neville said, his voice harsher than Draco had ever heard it. He saw Harry fight against Neville's grip, but the other man was stronger. "Don't be an idiot.
"He says he wants a family," Draco said, his tone wistful, but slightly sad. "He seems different from the others, but I still wouldn't tell him about Cal until after we'd met."
Hermione shook her head, wringing her hands. "No, your bond won't calm down until you are married," she clarified, wincing at the shocked looks on Harry and Draco's faces. "I'm so sorry, but you'll have to be married immediately if you want the bond's reactions to diminish."
He switched hands, flexing his cramping fingers as he circled the head with his other thumb, letting it slide in the precome that had gathered there. A droplet of sweat hit the leather sofa he was reclining on, and he pushed his damp fringe out of his face in annoyance. He would
Harry pulled away from his touch and buried his face in the pillow. “Fire poker. Vernon was burning a Hogwarts letter and I tried looking at It as it burned, and he poked me in the back with it to get me to stop looking.” He cried at the memory that recently happened.
“She’ll actually be coming along a little later to talk to Andromeda regarding Harry’s situation. Minerva apparently was tasked with watching the house before Harry was placed with the Dursley’s and Minerva told Dumbledore that she didn’t think Petunia was a fit guardian for Harry; but you know how Dumbledore can be about family.”
Neville laughed wishing he would have followed his dreams of Herbology instead of his parent’s Auror footsteps, he was slowly run out of drive to be an Auror and wanted to do something else instead, maybe after the wedding he’d go and get his Herbology Mastery and his teaching certificate. He was just tired of being an Auror, it had been seven years and all that he did is want to marry Hermione and start a family.
“The person we talked to earlier mentioned he was your guardian but couldn’t supply paperwork; proving he was, and Grant just told me he had just signed it. We are going to move you to keep you protected. I doubt he has an evil intention toward you; but we at St. Mungo’s and the Ministry’s Department of Magical Child Endangerment and Abuse takes cases like yours quite seriously. So, until he hands over the paperwork, we plan on keeping you away from him.” Bellatrix explained to both Harry and Kieran.
Bellatrix laughed softly to herself. “You shouldn’t have told me that, now I’ll be coming to you with all the shake needs.”
“I know nothing of your history, all that I know is that Bellatrix asked me to come meet with you. If you don’t like me; or don’t want to talk to me that is entirely up to you. I will never force anyone to talk to me. It is clear you are fascinated by dragons; would you like to hear more about dragons?” He questioned know that dragons and other magical creatures were often considered a safe topic and would hopefully help Harry feel safe around him.
Regulus smiled softly at the child before standing up from the bed. “Just let me or Bellatrix know if you change your mind. It was nice meeting you; I just wish it were a different circumstance. Want me to adjust the blanket?” He asked not wanting Harry to get offended by his help. That was another thing he saw a lot of was children wanting to be independent and do things on their own. Even something as simple as pulling up a blanket and adjusting a pillow.
Adrien sighed wondering how the hell someone not even Hogwarts age already had a Brain Aneurysm with several MTBI’s on top of it. “Abuse?” He questioned looking at the parchment scan that Kieran had handed him. He found the Aneurysm easily enough it was in the Frontal Lobe close to the Motor Cortex it looked like a straightforward Aneurysm. “Were you hoping I’m free to do it now?” He questioned he had a surgery in a few moments.
Draco was curious about Hermione and Neville, also Ron apparently married a Ravenclaw, he couldn’t seem to process that. “Hermione and Neville?” He asked incredulously wondering how that came to be. “Nope single as ever.” He left the part off that he was gay, and while there were a few flings and one serious relationship back in America, nobody had managed to catch his attention quite like Harry stinking Potter. That was something he would take to his grave. “What about you, still dating Weasley’s sister?”
“Of course I remember. Hello boys.” She teased politely sitting down on one other wingback chairs. “I just wish it was a different situation.”
“Rubus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; of course, Harry should know all about Hogwarts. My how you’ve grown.” Hagrid said smiling at Dudley. “I remember when you were just a wee baby.”
Grant smirked knowing he’d probably end up owning Bellatrix a few Gallons for that comment. “I’m sorry Headmaster. Healer Reid is one of the few Senior Healers we have on staff today and it is a busy day. I’m sure I’ll be able to find a suitable Healer for you.” He saw the flannel wrapped around Dumbledore’s hand and there was hardly any blood on the white flannel. Really, he could probably pull out his own wand and fix it with an Episky judging from the lack of blood.
I would like to apologize for my lack of updates. When I started writing this in December I didn't expect 2021 to turn into such a crappy year so quickly for me personally but it did.
“Good, that is how we hoped you’d feel.” Bellatrix smiled and made the flannel disappear. I’ll be right back with wheelchair.” She figured the quicker they were able to get Harry transferred from Accident and Emergency the less Dumbledore was likely to question his wait time.
Harry chose to throw up from apparating and just barely missed Bellatrix’s sneakers. “It’s alright kiddo.” Bellatrix banished the sick from the floor with a simple wave of her wand. “We’ll get you all fixed up.”
Kieran smiled at Bellatrix glad that his wife had saw the signs and ordered the child something gentle for lunch. “Thank you for doing that, I was just about to talk to Grant about Harry’s lunch. Oh, his lab results came in.” He said handing her the parchment watching his wife’s face fall. A similar reaction to his own.
Although a cut was hardly something to bother the skilled staff with St. Mungo’s with. That was something Poppy Pomphrey could handle. Bellatrix had personally assisted with the removal of an elephant trunk before. A parchment cut was something that could be treated with a salve or a quick ‘Episkey’. She personally thought that if anyone could feel it with a basic charm that most students learned in Year 2.  Oh well she figured one of the Student Healers would be more than pleased to fix Dumbledore’s cut.  She touched her wand to the wheelchair so that it would follow her.
Harry smiled softly hearing the last part of Draco’s sentence, he didn’t really have much of a choice in becoming an Auror, his father was one, Sirius was one, and now he was one; besides Kingsley wanted Harry, Ron, and Neville to work with Theseus Scamander in catching Voldemort’s remaining minions. “Ron actually married Padma Patel, remember her? She was a Ravenclaw in our year. Hermione is engaged to Neville. What about you seeing anybody?”
“I’m only going to say this once. I am a Mind Healer, and I am here when I should be asleep. A patient has a Ruptured Cerebral Aneurysm, so you are going to talk to me or I’m going to lodge a formal investigation into tonight. Your choice.” He said flatly.
“You can pull it off, I can’t.” Harry said sipping his tea enjoying breakfast with his godson. “You better go get ready, otherwise you’ll make me late.” He said after sneaking a quick peak at the clock in the kitchen.
“Azkaban?” Harry questioned before downing the phial of pink liquid. “Good flavor.” He muttered handing the phial back to Bellatrix.
“Honestly one of the worst cases I’ve had in a while.” She muttered feeling a paper airplane get tangled up in her hair. She knew it was a note from Regulus, he was one of the few who would make his airplanes tease her. It was kind of their thing when it came to sending interdepartmental notes. She quickly handed Grant the phials of potion she was carrying and untangled the offensive paper from her mess of black hair.
Regulus sighed internally and sat down in one of the empty computer chairs to draft a formal investigation into what happened after Kieran and Bellatrix left for the night and that is when he noticed something shiny catch his eye from the trash.
“Hagrid, I’ll go ahead and take him, since you aren’t family, I can’t allow you in a treatment room.” He left off the part where children were more forthcoming about abuse if it were just them along with a Healer and a Mediwitch.
He gently placed his left foot against the hard floor and then his right foot. He had barely made it a few steps before he hit the floor with a loud *thud* and the world went dark around him. The darkness felt comforting like he had been here once before.
“I usually do flavour them for children, but that’s not a bad idea; some of them do taste horrid.” Draco smiled at Harry at his statement. “I assure you I take no pleasure of seeing you like this. I’m a Healer, I don’t like inflicting more pain on my patients.” He left off the part where he had heard enough screams of pain to last him a lifetime. It seemed like his father, Bellatrix, and snake face liked practicing the Cruciatus Curse on Draco despite his mother’s pleas to stop it that he was only a child. They never did listen to Narcissa about their love of torturing her baby; but he would not tell Harry that. No one knew the true story of how he was marked and just thinking about that night made him want to puke.
“Sure, can we just go a little later I’m afraid I might wake up with a hangover.” Harry commented not wanting to wake up hungover.
A few angry thuds later and the solid wooden door was suddenly laying on the floor and where the door once stood, now stood a giant. Dudley bolted up from the couch at the sound of the door falling.
Harry was stunned at Draco’s admission that he was a muggle doctor. “So, that’s why nobody knew where you were, you were in America getting your N.E.W.T.S. several wondered why you didn’t come back to finish them at Hogwarts. So, what was Ilvormorny like?” He asked wondering if it was like Hogwarts. “So how are your Slytherin friends.”
“Yes, you’ll have to tell us how it goes tomorrow.” Neville said grabbing Hermione’s hand as they stepped into the fireplace together.
“Considering she suggested a muggle bar I’m not too worried about her using me for my fame, besides she’s only 22. Tatiana is her name, and before any of you ask yes, she is blonde and very pretty. Now since I know very little about her, I would appreciate saving all of your questioned until after the date.” He said flatly ordering his usual coffee, glad that he come up with an alibi.
“Seriously Ron I’m tempted to ask Padma to charm your wedding ring so that every time you ask if a girl is pretty that your wedding ring will heat up and remind you that you are married.” Hermione said an evil glint in her eye.
Harry looked questionably at the Healer he was expecting to be questioned over everything the Dursley’s had ever done to him. Instead, the Healer wanted to talk about dragons. Which was alright with him, he would much rather be learning about dragons or anything else magical over telling another stranger personal details of growing up at the Dursley’s. “I’d like that.” Harry muttered glad the Healer wasn’t pushing or prying into things he didn’t want to talk about.
“My ribs are still tender from Yaxley’s blasting curse, my healer warned that they would still be tender today.”
Regulus sighed and flopped ungracefully into his favorite wingback chair and looked at his cousin. “We mostly talked about dragons, but I think he is open to the idea of me. He wondered how meeting me would work once he went to Hogwarts. I think he is willing to give me a few chances. Today we mainly spoke of dragons and his parents. I was able to see a few things lurking under the surface based on his body language or how he reacted to me telling him I knew his parents.”
“Who knows what he is thinking.” Bellatrix groaned. “What I do know is that Harry has a great team of medical professionals and Andromeda will not rest until she knows that boy has been placed with a family that is going to love him like one of their own.”
Kieran gently lifted the blanket and unbuttoned the snaps on the gown. He scooped a small amount from the tub and gently rubbed the thick pink paste against the obnoxious burn on the child’s back. “I know it is cool, that would be the Aloe.”
Harry gently took the phial from her black colored fingernails and downed the liquid in one go. It tasted like it did earlier. Not great but it was tolerable. He could see the steam coming off the dinner. He wouldn’t lie he didn’t know the last time he had a hot meal and that Shepherd’s Pie looked appetizing.
Vivienne took the parchment from the healer and quickly skimmed the five pages of parchment with years listed of when the injury occurred. After she got the fifth page, she quickly got up from wingback chair and bolted to the trash can in the corner. In her three years as head of DMCEA she had never seen something so horrid.
Bellatrix emerged in a light purple scoop bikini with a bow in the middle of her chest and holding two stemless wine glasses with a red in both. She sat the two glasses of wine on the ledge and got into the hot tub which was the perfect temperature. She took a seat in her husband’s lap and gently kissed his cheek forever grateful that this was the person Hekate decided was her perfect match.
“They are still really close friends of mine, we did however drift apart while I spend seven years across the pond, since it was hard to stay in touch given to communication in 1998. It’s also nice since Olivia doesn’t know my history or about Voldemort.” He said with an eye roll adjusting the sleeve of his shirt while grabbing a small piece of salted pretzel covered in butter and salt. He dipped into the beer cheese dip. “So, besides what we talked about yesterday what else is new with you in the seven years I was gone?”
“Mediwitch Black-Reid always a pleasure.” Adrien said following the witch into the room. He saw Regulus holding the child’s hand and Kieran pushing a potion into the IV. “What happened? Reid, I thought you said the Aneurysm could at least make it until earlier in the morning.”
“We also talked to Andromeda who is a social worker, and we have her looking into your life and anything she can find regarding your parents wills. She’ll also want to talk to you once you are fully healed. Every decision is entirely up to you right now.”
Draco smiled at Harry’s admittance that he was no longer dating the red headed weasel. “Do you mind if I examine your wrist?” He questioned not wanting to take the Auror by surprised. He should consider this a magical on his own that he was being allowed to treat an Auror of Harry Potter’s caliber.
“I didn’t peg Neville for an Auror, I can see Ron being an Auror. I also never saw you become an Auror, yet here you are.” Draco muttered silently. “So, are Ron and Hermione still dating?” He asked wondering what was new with Harry’s friends. It seemed like a safe enough topic to talk about.
The reply from the twins was almost instant. “Alright so I guess we will all be going to Alton Towers tomorrow.” He said as the elevator spat them out onto the second floor. The walked down the corridor to the cubical farm looking forward to their day of suspension.
“I am being dragged to Alton Towers tomorrow, so it couldn’t be tomorrow, what time are you off the day after tomorrow, I think it’s a Wednesday?” He suggested figuring he’d be off the rest of the week due to his suspension.
“Rubeus described a stand off between Harry’s male guardian who pushed Harry roughly against the wall. He heard Harry crying and Harry admitted that his wrist was broken so Rubeus brought him hear to St. Mungos where Bellatrix and I were just signing on for our shift. I took Harry from Rubeus who went to wait in the waiting room. Upon my initial examination of the left wrist and what Harry had said about Paracetamol I figured it was not a fresh break like was initially thought. The initial diagnostic charm confirmed my suspicion of it being a few days old break along with his wrist being broke seven times prior to this break.” Kieran paused for a few moments allowing Andromeda and Vivienne a moment to process what he had just said.
Harry sighed he agreed with Neville that he didn’t want to deal with the reports. “She diagnosed me with a broken wrist, punctured lung, and three broken ribs, she also gave me a potion to stop the Cruciatus Curse aftereffects. It could have been a lot worse.” He admitted tossing his coffee cup in the rubbish bin. “Now let’s just get this day over with.”
“The Aneurysm ruptured. He was fine when I left for the night, we had just made sure he had dinner and gave him a dose of pain receptor blocker and Bellatrix got him an extra blanket and he was close to sleep again. After a few hours the three of us were alerted that he wasn’t responsive. We rushed here and found him unconscious in the middle of the room; after a quick scan it showed his aneurysm had ruptured and that he had recent seizure activity. We got him safely back into bed and we have given him a blood replenisher along with getting the OR prepped.” Kieran explained as Adrien did his own scans of Harry’s brain.
Harry sighed at Bellatrix’s explanation about why he was being moved to a different floor. At least this time the people seemed to be on his side, rather the side of his ‘relatives’ and other people. He let out a small moan once the first sip of the shake hit his tastebuds.
Draco listened to Harry’s bitter admittance of his healing abilities. “I had a great training program, and you are a surprisingly compliant patient, you haven’t screamed or tried to hex me once.” Draco teased laying a comforting hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Can I get you to turn on your side, it will allow me to get to your injured ribs.” He helped Harry into a moderately comfortable position hearing the wince of pain.
Kieran grabbed the glass of wine and took a small glug. “So, what did you want to talk about?” He questioned feeling the jet massaging his lower back.
“it’s alright dear boy. I understand.” Dumbledore muttered looking at the former Hogwarts Student. “I don’t suppose you’d let me pick the Healer assigned to my case. Do you happen to know if Kieran Reid is available?”
Regulus scribbled down the information about Dumbledore and Ginevra Weasley on his notepad before turning his attention back to the chart the bile rising in his throat seeing the sheer number of previous injuries. He read all the details regarding the MTBI’s, PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and about threw up when he read that the young child had a Brain Aneurysm.
Trix, I’m finishing up with my last patient before lunch. I’ll see you at 1pm or a few moments sooner.
He buttoned the top of his robes and made his way down the grey staircase. He bought this apartment shortly after the battle of Hogwarts, he had refused to move into 12 Grimmauld Place since it was full of sad memories and he didn’t feel comfortable there like he once did. It felt about like Hogwarts what once filled like a home now felt like a nightmare. “Morning Teddy and Kreacher.” He kissed Teddy’s blue hair. “Thank you Kreacher.” He said eating his breakfast with a cup of tea sweetened to perfection. “Teddy don’t forget that you will be spending the night with the Weasley family.”
Kieran watched the child viciously attack the tray of food like someone who had been starved almost to death. He hated to think that this was probably one of the few proper meals he had in his lifetime. He ignored the lack of manners, he figured he would act the same way if someone had starved him for many years. “How is it?”
“Sorry Hermione, blame the boss.” Ron said with a mouthful of burrito in his mouth, a piece of steak dropping the end onto the table. “I’d much rather be in the field than dealing with Ministry paperwork.”
“Yeah, I got sorted into two houses, unlike Hogwarts who uses a hat, Ilvormorny uses statues representing the mascots of the house, on the rare occasion a wizard could be accepted into all the houses and then it’s their decision about which house they’d like to be in. It was a cool concept, although I did prefer the hat.” He said his love of Hogwarts not willing to change.
“We should probably go get our arse handed to us by Theseus.” Ron suggested finishing the rest of his coffee. “I don’t think we will see the field for quite a while.”
Umbridge walked into the room of the ill child and turned on the light and saw an offensive toy he was snuggling. “Wake up brat!” She demanded grabbing the plush toy from the child. She personally felt that anyone who was on this floor did not get to enjoy a comfort such as blankets or toys. In her mind they were the sort who needed to be banished from wizarding society.
“Oh, hello dears. I didn’t notice you there.” Minerva said sounding slightly embarrassed. “How are Elara and Rigel? Is Elara getting excited for her first year at Hogwarts?” She asked the two trying to be polite and not let her rage towards Dumbledore get the better of her.
Bellatrix laughed softly to herself watching the child drink the shake like it was the best thing to ever exist. Which the sad thing was that might have been one of the first few things he’d ever properly eaten judging from the broken bones, and the lab work. “Good shake?”
“Don’t.” Harry hissed roughly shoving the sleeve back down before Kieran could get a glimpse of the name.
He then went to the closet the Mind Healers shared that was full of toys and plushies. He grabbed the Opaleye dragon plush. The fur of the plush sparkled in the light it would also puff out little red smoke rings on occasion. He knew that Harry probably hadn’t received many gifts growing up and he knew from previous cases that plush toys could help keep children present and give them something to fiddle with. After being a Mind Healer, he was great at detecting non-verbal cues just based on how someone would play with a toy, their pet, or a plush toy.
Ron smiled glad that Harry was doing better. “I’m glad you are feeling well enough to come to work, I uh actually had some really good news to tell you and Hermione. He had promised Padma to keep it a secret but he was telling his two best friends this news. He grabbed his robes from the back of a chair and put it on haphazardly and didn’t bother to button it, besides the moment he got into the Auror offices it would be draped over his office chair anyway. It was the most annoying thing about being an Auror.
Bellatrix smiled softly she loved her husband dearly. He was always her voice of reason when she needed it the most. They came to the Accident and Emergency waiting room and saw Dumbledore lecturing Hagrid about something. She could see tear stains around the half giants’ eyes like whatever the Headmaster was saying was hateful. “Hello Hagrid and Headmaster Dumbledore.” She greeted pleasantly.
Draco laughed at Harry comparing Skele-Gro to Goblin Piss. “Do I want to know how you know what Goblin Piss tastes like.” He teased sitting on the rolling stool in the room. “I have a muggle Medical Degree, after the battle I moved to America and finished my last year at Ilvormorny. My main job is a pediatric emergency room physician, I only help at St. Mungo’s on occasion.”
“I typically follow the bottles suggestion for a dose. Which would be two 500mgs pills every six hours as I felt pain. Sometimes I would take Vernon’s special Paracetamol which is 650mgs.” Harry admitted wondering why they were suddenly wondering about the Paracetamol.
Vivienne carefully dropped a few sugar cubes into her tea before stirring it. “As much as I love hearing about the Black Family, I’d like to know why you requested us hear Bellatrix? Andromeda mentioned an important case.” She remarked wanting to know whom the case was about.
Bellatrix laughed softly to herself at Dumbledore’s sudden switch in behavior it was something a Slytherin would do. The difference being is a Slytherin would have been able to manipulate the situation better.
“Hello Harry.” Draco said entering the restaurant through the yellow door and heading for one of the waitresses. “I’d like to speak to the mayor.” He told the college aged waitress.
Then there was her sweet, little, Elara. People liked to joke given how close in age Rigel and Elara were that they are Irish Twins. Rigel and Elara couldn’t have been more different while Rigel was very studious and loved the knowledge of learning anything and everything. Elara was the planner of the family. She had a plan for everything and was freakishly cunning, she had managed to wrap all her cousins around her perfectly manicured nails like a typical Slytherin. In fact, sometimes Bellatrix was terrified of her own daughter’s cunning behavior. There had been more than once where Elara had involved Rigel into one of her plans and outsmarted both Kieran and Bellatrix.
“Actually, I’d rather not be in the same room as him. Mediwitch Reid are you open to a conversation. I know you can’t tell me anything, but I can tell you things, right?” Minerva asked the witch politely. She had lots she’d like to discuss about Harry.
“Send her in.” Kieran smiled he’d rather have a conversation with McGonagall any day then this conversation with Dumbledore. She at least could use her brain and could see reason.
“I’ll be back soon.” Bellatrix handed Kieran the navy blue hospital gown in the pediatric size and leaving the room.
“Harry, I’ll be right back. While I’m gone Bella is going to give you a pain potion to help with the pain of your wrist.” He looked at his wife and gestured to the note on the counter regarding the dosage. He didn’t want to tell Harry the dosage and make him get anxious that they were already picking up on the abuse signs.
Harry sighed angry with himself that he was even considering the idea of meeting with a shrink. He wanted to hate Kieran and Bellatrix the last time he trusted someone who had promised him help didn’t go well at all if anything the abuse got worse that year. So why did a part of him want to trust these people and talk about what Vernon, Dudley, and Petunia had done to him.
“How do you feel?” Kieran asked softly wondering if Harry felt satisfied from the shake and the potions.
“I promise you Harry that your parents loved you very much and that they were not negligent drunks.” Regulus said wanting to cry his heart physically hurt. He remembered finding out that Sirius had died trying to figure out who had murdered James and Lily.
Andromeda grabbed a piece of parchment after placing the health scan into her briefcase. She felt nauseated after reading that health scan and could feel the Black Family urge to go harm those that did this to an innocent child. “Is their anything Harry might have mentioned that we could look into. Did he mention where he was from? What schools he might have attended? Has someone else tried to get him justice?”
“Of course, your secret is safe with us.” Hermione said after mentioning something about how much fun it will be to be shopping for baby clothes. She looked down at her watch “I’ll see you all for lunch.” She stood up dusting a few crumbs from her dress and placed a small kiss on Neville’s cheek before leaving the table, her pumps clicking loudly as she left the three guys heading to her office on the third floor.
“My father always wanted me to attend Durmstrang over Hogwarts, while my mother always against Durmstrang in favor of Beauxbatons. I fought against both of those options when I was younger because I wanted to stay close to them, so when it came time to decide what I wanted to do for my eighth year I knew I didn’t want to attend either of those places, so my options still left on this side of the pond were Russia, Africa, or Japan. I don’t speak Russia or Japanese, and Africa is mostly known for its Astronomy students and while I received an O in Astronomy on the O.W.L.S it was never my favorite subject.” Draco elaborated. “I also liked the history of how Ilvormorny came to be. It was actually founded by a descendant of Salazar Slytherin who married a muggle.” He had refused to use American’s term for a muggle, really no-maj couldn’t they have come something better.
“You saw Draco?” She asked with a smile she knew that Harry was gay and she couldn’t help but think those boys would be good together. With Narcissa living with her she couldn’t help but she Draco on occasion and that poor boy had looked like he had been to hell and back. She also knew Harry was not as fine as he let on, and that he was hiding demons. Teddy had told her that Harry screams a lot in his sleep. She couldn’t help but worry about Harry after all he was the one raising her grandchild.
“Possibly, do you remember the last time I had a date their mate? I do it was about two years ago, and I scared her off by mentioning I had a five-year-old at home.” Harry said leaving off the part where he sometimes frequented muggle gay clubs to get some sexual satisfaction. It might have been two years since his last relationship, but it certainly hadn’t been two years since he last gotten any. It was just easier in the muggle world to have a one night stand and not have that leaked all over The Daily Prophet.
I'd like to think you in advance for the kudos, bookmarks, and comments. They make me happy and write quicker.
“Kieran do you remember which Medistaff member Harry was placed with tonight.” Regulus asked standing up and removing his gloves.
Regulus handed Harry the dragon plush. “This is for you.” He said sitting down on the edge of the bed noticing the child’s green eyes widen with excitement at someone giving him something. He watched Harry hug the dragon tightly which prompted little red smoke rings to emerge from the mouth.
“Have I told you how much I love you?” He muttered on the same page of a warm shower, his comfortable bed, and his arm wrapped protectively around Bellatrix’s waist. “You ready to go home?” He questioned leading his wife to the large row of fireplaces.
Kieran looked at Regulus and then pulled his wife tightly into his chest to keep her magic from once again trying to destroy something. “Regulus how do you think the child is mentally?” He wondered running a soothing hand down his wife’s back.
Draco smirked and gave Harry a smile showing most of his teeth. “I’m a pretty good Healer, huh.” He teased. “Do you mind lifting up your shirt so I can check out your chest?” He questioned. “So, when did Hermione and Neville get together?” He still was having difficulty picturing those two together.
“Try Adrien Burke, he was a Slytherin and from what I’ve heard he’s a pretty great Neuro Healer. He was also not a huge Slytherin ass during our years at Hogwarts.” Regulus remarked pulling a leather bounded notebook and grabbing his reading glasses from their spot on the desk.
Harry saw the green flames roar to life and soon found himself stumbling into his flat. He discarded the Auror robes figuring those were not appropriate for muggle London. He flipped through the closet trying to decide what to wear besides settling on a burgundy Henley a pair of form fitting dark wash jeans, and his favorite pair of black Converse. He fixed his hair and sprayed cologne before grabbing his cell double checking the address and trying to figure out an empty spot to apparate too. He grabbed his discarded work pants and grabbed his wallet, wand, and cell. He stuck his wand in his leather jacket, after all it was May and London was unusually chilly this year.
“I am an Auror, and why wouldn’t I be okay with you as my healer?” Harry asked dumbly wondering why he wouldn’t be okay with Draco healing his wounds. Sure, Draco was a Death Eater at one point, but that was because of Draco’s father. If you wanted Harry’s opinion he thought Draco was just a misguided child wanting to please his father. It was obvious from what he was seeing that Draco had certainly changed his life around, and he was sort of pleasant when he wasn’t shooting insults at you.
“Hello Harry.” Kieran said sitting on the edge of the bed. He had been a Healer long enough that Harry’s heart was beating rapidly, and he was probably close to a panic attack if they weren’t careful. “You are at St. Mungo’s. Do you remember me from earlier?”
“I think the salted pretzel sounds good, especially with the beer cheese.” Harry suggested figuring he’d need to eat something since he did plan on a three-drink limit, or less depending on how much of prat Draco was. “So, since you’ve been here before what do you recommend to drink?” He asked looking over the cocktail list not understanding a lot of the terms, he was used to Firewhisky.
“You know I can discuss work with you.” He said. “Maybe a little, you didn’t see him mother he has abs now. I did ask him to get a drink with me tomorrow, I used the excuse I never did get to repay him for his testimony at our trial.” He took a sip of the wine letting it mule over his tongue it had been indeed a long day and there was nothing better than having a glass of very expensive wine with his mother, well besides some hot steamy sex, but that wasn’t an option.
Dumbledore narrowed his eyes and then realized he should try a more polite tactic he might get the information he wanted. “I’m sorry dears, I’m just very worried about Harry. You were both students under me; surly you know that I just want to know that he is safe and being taken care of. Please, give me the information regarding Harry Potter. I am simply confused how I can send Hagrid to collect the child and let him and his family know that he is a wizard. Then the next thing I know Hagrid is letting me know that Harry is at St. Mungo’s. Surely you both as parents understand how I am feeling.”
“Your soulmate is my nephew.” Bellatrix exclaimed. “That makes you family.” She said softly running her nails gently through Harry’s hair. “We’d appreciate it if you stopped pulling your wrist away from us, it makes it harder for us to examine it.”
Regulus had just stepped out from a shower that he shared with Severus and every nerve in his body snapped awake. It was the spell he had placed outside of Harry’s room before he had left for the night. Not only was Harry’s emotions going haywire, but the spell was having trouble detecting movement. “Fuck!” He cursed quickly wrapping the towel around his waist. “Sev, I got to go.” He said running into the closet.
“You’re Welcome!” Grant said to both Harry and Bellatrix. “I should get back to A&E before it burns down without me.” He dramatically said leaving the room. It was almost the end of shift, and he was ready to finish his stack of paperwork and get home to Carina and their newly born son.
Andromeda smiled softly and embraced her sister and brother-in-law tightly before turning her attention to her cousin, Regulus. “Good to see you Regulus, how’s Severus? Nymphadora is going to miss him terribly this year; but I know she’ll make an excellent Auror.” She said pulling out Regulus’s office chair and sitting down. His office wasn’t exactly made for meetings with large amounts of people.
Bellatrix grabbed her wand from her scrub pants and unlocked Regulus’s office. She turned to look at her husband and sighed indigently before sitting on the couch in the room. Her magic felt like it wanted to break something and she herself wanted to strangle muggles. “He’s Elara’s age!” She exclaimed loudly hearing the books on the bookshelf shake with her rage. She didn’t understand how anyone could do that to a child, any child regardless of what was in their blood.
Grant turned to the bench and grabbed the bottle of protein powder and a bunch of other nutrient powders and mixed up a delightful chocolate shake with bonus whipped cream and a cherry on top of it. It looked like something that would have come from
“It was nice seeing you.” He lied turning the door handle and leaving the room to tend to Harry and figure out what McGonagall wanted to talk about. He tapped his badge to the sensor and the doors to the treatment area flung open.
“Good luck with Tati tonight mate.” Ron said with a wink stepping in the fireplace to take him home.
Teddy trotted down the stairs five minutes later dressed in his T jumper, jeans, and a pair of Converse. “I’m ready when you are.”
Bellatrix sighed loudly at the mentioning of Regulus’s thoughts on the child’s mental health. “Harry mentioned a Mrs. Gray and a social worker. Maybe Andromeda can find info regarding that. That might have been the first time someone noticed and tried to help, and it didn’t work out.” She wanted to see the muggles who did this locked in Azkaban or something far worse.
The Healer smiled gently at the child. “Your dinner will be here in a few minutes. While you wait may I apply some more burn paste to your back?” He held up the tub of burn paste. “You are due for another coat.”
He could see that the wrist in question had been broken seven times already mostly in the same spot along the proximal carpals and into the distal radius. It was a wonder with all the breaks that hadn’t healed properly that the child was able to even use that wrist. He was going to have to rebreak several of the carpal bones again in order to properly heal them due to improper healing. It was another check in the child abuse column that the child had never received medical care.
“Harry you have a Brain Aneurysm and if I had to guess what might have caused it would be the fact that you’ve had a concussion every year since you were one years old. Your parents sadly passed away when you were one. I just need to say yes or no if any of this was caused by some time of physical abuse.”
Regulus felt the rage throughout his body. He didn’t know Petunia all that well, he vaguely remembered her being present at the wedding and mentioning something about Lily being the favorite. He wanted to find them and yell loudly that the Potter’s were not drunks and that they loved baby Harry like crazy. He remembered how happy his brother was the day James and Lily had named his as Dogfather. He also could hear Harry’s excited squeals of excitement as he rode Padfoot around the house.
“Well Mrs. Riddle do you remember ten years ago when James Charlus Potter, Lily Rose Potter, and Sirius Orion Black were murdered? James and Lily had a son, Harry, who was the only survivor that night. Harry was brought to St. Mungo’s early this morning by Rubeus Hagrid who was sent by Albus Dumbledore to see why Harry Potter wasn’t answering any of the Owl Post about his Hogwarts Acceptance Letter. Rubeus found Harry in a cabin out in a lake. The Dursley’s had taken Harry and their other son, Dudley, to the cabin to escape the Hogwarts letters.” Kieran began making eye contact with the middle-aged witch and the terrifying wife of their esteemed Minster of Magic.
Harry glared at Bellatrix in fear she’d mention putting him in a gown and them seeing everything. “Only if I can keep my clothes on.”
“They apparently had another son that was quite overweight. Harry had no prior knowledge of being a wizard before Hagrid showed up. His family were at a cabin in the middle of a lake trying to escape the letters. Has he told you anything?” Kieran asked looking at the small boy curled into a ball in the bed.
“Aneurysm’s rarely rupture without cause.” Adrien muttered pulling out a shimmering memory of Harry’s and placing it into a phial. “Regulus this the last memory he had before going unconscious. If you wouldn’t mind watching it and letting Kieran and I know what it contained. Kieran get Harry ready for surgery for me and do change into a pair of scrubs.
Kieran placed the cap back onto the tub of paste and pulled off his gloves. “Give that a few moments to sink into your burn and I’ll pull your blanket back up.” He pulled off the gloves and the disappeared into the air. He heard a small pop and looked over to see a large portion of Shepherd’s Pie and a steaming roll. “If you eat all your dinner, I have someone bringing you a surprise for dessert.”
Draco hesitantly took the chart from the young Mediwitch, he figured this case would be the same, him going into the room and being screamed at for apparently trying to live his life, and rewrite the wrong done to the Malfoy name. Had you have told an eleven-year-old Draco, that he would go on to become a muggle doctor, he would have laughed in your face and then hexed you. Yet here was a twenty-five-year-old Draco, who longed for the colorful walls of his usual emergency department, instead of being yelled at for trying to do his job.
Bellatrix laughed softly at the name. “Love, he is an arse. A talented arse but he couldn’t give two shits about his patients that wind up near him. But we could use his talent and it isn’t like Harry will be spending time with Adrien while awake.”
Kieran walked over to the elevator and hit the first-floor level he figured that Burke would be on the first floor nearest the theatres. He also wanted to check on the A&E to make sure he wasn’t missing anything important case wise. Not that Grant would dare separate him from the case he was currently on.  He passed by the operating theatre and found Adrien just outside like he had just finished up with a surgery. “Healer Burke do you have a moment?” He asked politely.
Harry sighed loudly at the idea of someone other then his medical staff seeing whatever appeared from the scan, but at the same time after almost nine years of abuse; only five of it he could remember he wanted something to be done and wanted to get away from the Dursley’s and their hatred towards him. “I’ll get into the hospital gown on one condition.”
“Thank you.” Kieran told his wife politely watching her set the small file on Lily’s birth on the counter. He gently placed Harry down on the stretcher and he sat down on the stool next to the left side of the bed. “So, it is the left wrist correct?” Kieran questioned gently lifting Harry’s jumper sleeve up so he could get a better look at the injury.
“Ah, there’s your usual arrogance.” Harry snapped back wondering what had happened to Draco’s ego, turns out it was still alive and well. “I hate to admit it but you are a pretty good healer, probably one of the best I have had since being an Auror.” He muttered turning to the face the pillow not wanting to see Malfoy’s smirk of satisfaction. It was still the same Draco, just maybe a little nicer and good looking.
“Two years I’d be tired of my right hand.” Ron teased as the elevator took them to the second floor, home of the Magical Law Enforcement offices and the cubical farm, as he usually referred to it.
“Wrist is broken.” Harry cried showing the giant the wrist with Draco Malfoy written on it, it was dark in the cabin so he knew the giant wouldn’t be able to see the name and think that he was a freak.
“I guess I’ll meet with him. One meeting and if I don’t like him you two can drop it.” Harry sassed. “I guess you can do the in-depth health scan.”
“Hermione and Neville actually got together shortly after the battle. We were standing in the great hall and suddenly, she kissed him out of the blue; apparently, Hermione and Ron had a breakup shortly before the battle, and she had always had a small crush on Neville and watching him kill Nagini with the sword just sealed the deal for her. The two have been together ever since and are enjoying a long engagement. Ron and Padma had met each other for dinner one night just to talk, they had always been friends since the Yule Ball, and I guess things just spiraled out of control. They dated for about two years before Ron proposed. They have been married about three years now. Ron and Hermione never had any hard feelings with each other after the break up.” Harry said giving Draco a quick rundown on what had happened.
Kieran sighed walking away from the theatres and over to Accident and Emergency. He saw Grant behind the desk reading case files. “Anything interesting?” He questioned leaning his butt against the desk.
“Reg?” Severus questioned his husband it had been months before he saw that distance stare in his husband’s eye. He could tell judging by how quiet Regulus was when he got home that his husband had a rough day.
He walked the short distance to Harry’s room on the fifth floor. He appreciated the move since his office was located on the fifth floor. The fifth floor was where the Mind Healers personal offices were located, it was also the floor where most of the abuse victims were moved to after Accident and Emergency had diagnosed them or provided treatment. He could hear Bellatrix’s voice and it sounded like she was telling Harry a little story.
Harry watched Ron he felt the same way about the mountain load of paperwork. “Just four more hours their lad and then this day will be over and we all have the day off tomorrow since we now on suspension and all.” He was looking forward to staying out late with Draco and then spending most of the day with Teddy.
Harry grabbed the blanket and pulled it up to his chin. “Thank you.” He muttered rolling to his side and cuddling the dragon plush.
“I’m Healer Kieran Reid, I assume you have no knowledge of this world so I’m what is better known to you as a doctor. You are welcome to just call me Kieran though; and the woman with the interesting hair is Bellatrix she’s a Mediwitch which is like a nurse. We are going to take you to an exam room and check on your injured wrist and anything else you mention. Can I get your full name so that Bellatrix can check to see if we can find a file on you?”
Regulus had just finished explaining the two native dragons to the Untied Kingdom the Common Welch Green and the Hebridean Black when he decided to try his luck with Harry.
She watched Kieran scan Harry’s upper limbs and lower limbs as the quill angrily scribbled prior injuries and breaks. The parchment of previous breaks took up one and a half pages. It appears Harry’s bones were very susceptible to breaks which would be true of someone very malnourished.
Harry sighed knowing Vernon would complain about bills the moment he had the mail in his hand. He finished drying the last of Petunia’s good plates and got off the stool he was standing on. He placed it back in the pantry and made his way to the mailbox. He opened the mailbox hearing the usual creak as it opened. He grabbed the stack of mail most of which was probably bills; but there was a letter addressed to him at the top of the stack.
Kieran sighed and grabbed a pair of gloves hanging on the rack and the burn paste. He sat the burn paste on the bed and gently made his way to Harry’s head. “Sweetheart, I know you are tired and getting a proper rest is important, but it is now dinner, and we’d like for you to eat again.”
“You have a couple broken ribs, and you might have a punctured lung, it would explain your breathing issues.” Draco explained to the Auror letting him process what was wrong. He strolled over to the cabinet and grabbed a pain potion. “Here drink this, it will make the next part easier.” He handed Harry the phial watching him uncork the potion and down it in one go.
He shook his head, recording the vitals on the chart with his wand. "I don't know how – or why – you did it. No one's survived resistance at that dosage. Six drops – it's a wonder that didn't kill you on its own," he said, clucking his tongue.
“Jesus,” Theo groaned, scooting his chair back so Hermione could climb out from under the table. His eyelids, drooping from the force of his orgasm, shot open again as he looked at her. He hadn’t been able to get the full effect of her outfit before, and he felt his spent cock twitch at the delicious picture she made, all long legs and soft curves. The skirt was so short it barely covered her arse, and he could see her pebbled nipples through the sheer blouse.
"You know," Ron hissed, rolling his eyes. "About Harry? If there was something I should know? About Sly? The
He paused, grinning when he saw the interest flare in Draco's grey eyes. "That is, if you're up for it."
Draco had spent years playing the part of a devoted husband, but none of it had been true. He didn't intend to play the same role with Harry – he loved him too much to pretend. He would hurt Harry's feelings. He would forget anniversaries. He would interrupt romantic dinners to deal with business, he would go days on end without telling Harry he loved him. Of those things he was certain. It was in his nature to take things for granted, to overlook the importance of daily affirmations and whispered affections. But he also knew he would cherish every moment they spent together and love Harry more than he had ever loved anyone in his life, save Cal.
"Open it. I want to see what makes it so bloody fantastic that you had to comb every wine shop in London looking for it," Blaise said, picking up his cup of perfectly made tea.
"Draco," Harry said with a smirk, clearly over his earlier humiliation. He let his gaze trail down Draco's body, his smirk growing when he saw the bulge of Draco's erection. "See you in a few days."
"He – I – we – I can explain –" Harry stammered, reaching a shaky hand out for the paper to see exactly
Draco held back a gasp, the white-hot thrill he felt ripple through him bore no resemblance to the mere tingle he'd felt when he'd first touched Patrizia after their courtship ended. But that had been an arranged marriage, and one he wasn't overly interested in to boot. This, though – this was
His heart melted at the sight, but he stood his ground. The boy had everyone wrapped around his little finger, but Blaise knew better than to contradict a direct order from Draco.
, Harry thought absently, settling into his chair to look over the Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes paperwork he'd brought over.
The courtship ritual had been designed in a time ruled by arranged marriages, which were still popular among the pure-blood elite. Draco had entered into one himself, Harry knew. He'd researched Draco extensively, with Luna's help, before deciding to invoke
They both stopped when they heard the Floo roar to life, pausing mid-struggle to watch as Hermione and Ron climbed out of the fireplace. They looked tired and harried, the stress of the last few hours showing on Hermione's sun-browned face. Ron sported a light sunburn – he could never be trusted to renew the charm that blocked the sun at regular intervals – and a healthy amount of red stubble on his jaw.
"And Fred and Roxie?" Harry asked, afraid of the answer. George and Angie's twins were a right menace, and he had a hard time believing they hadn't played a large role in this fiasco as well. It had been Draco's idea to have all the older cousins over for a few days, saying it would be fun for Cal and Teddy.
Harry wasn't sure what emotions were flitting through Draco's eyes, but he knew he saw the love he felt reflected there, and that was all he needed to see. His eyes drifted shut as Draco's lips parted, his tongue darting out to lick a path up Harry's twitching cock, swirling around the head as though savoring the precome that had gathered there.
being the best, of course – and now he was into some of the ones he'd never seen before. He'd had no idea Hugh Grant had been in so many movies, but he was enjoying each one immensely.
Harry had originally balked at the idea of a game based around him, but he'd agreed when the manufacturer pledged to donate a quarter of the proceeds to a home for children orphaned in the war. Harry Potter Clue had been the first game, but now nearly a dozen different Harry Potter-themed games graced the shelves of most wizarding toy stores.
Draco tapped his wand on the Malfoy Seal, smiling when it glowed a vibrant green, darker than Harry's Black Seal had. The Malfoy Line was undiluted – Slytherins since the inception of Hogwarts. Not like the Black Line, with Harry's Gryffindor godfather.
"Not the ideal way to spend your birthday, I know, but she insisted you come in if you wanted the change made," Hermione said apologetically, leading James Evans through the familiar halls of the publishing house.
"I, Harry James Potter, Head of the most Ancient and Noble Houses of Potter and Black, do freely and gladly accept the yoke of a magical bond with Draco Abraxas Malfoy," Harry said, touching his wand to the bottom of the contract.
"I don't know. I expected a big scene when they found out. Yelling, hexing, fighting. Not this – this polite indifference."
He arched a brow at Blaise, who was looking a bit worse for the wear himself. Theo was completely pissed, though not as far gone as Potter or Weasley. The dragon tamer was chatting up a dancer at another table, surrounded by several other of Potter's Gryffindor classmates.
"To skate?" Draco asked, his voice sounding rough and hoarse, as though he hadn't used it in months, not minutes.
Draco silenced his husband with another kiss, breaking away after a moment to finish removing Harry's pajama bottoms. He tossed them to the foot of the bed, where they joined the ones he'd shucked before climbing in with Harry.
Draco read through the post twice, resisting the urge to tick off the compatible interests on his fingers. This bloke sounded nearly perfect to him, and he figured Blaise felt the same way, since the other man hadn't spoken up yet.
"My room," Harry said simply, ducking back out and into the corridor. It had been cramped when he was a child, but it was nearly impossible to fit comfortably in there now.
Draco sighed and pushed back from his desk. His response would have to wait. He walked toward the door, stopping to grab his briefcase and cloak from his secretary.
Harry nodded, happy he hadn't told her about last night's run-in at the Diagon Alley meeting. There were only a few people who fit the description Hermione was giving him, and he'd just seen one of them.
The room rang with absolute silence, the ragged breathing of the newly bonded pair loud within the confines of the drawing room. It was enough to snap Kingsley out of his stupor, and he grimaced slightly at his misstep before continuing.
Harry had jotted a few hasty words underneath in ink, but Draco didn't notice. He felt hot and dizzy. Harry Potter had professed his love for him in a best-selling book. Millions of people would see it. They might not know it was Harry, or that Harry was talking about him, but
Kieran looked at Dumbledore. “I can’t and am not going to tell you anything about Harry. Provide the documentation proving you are his Magical Guardian or leave the premise. If you don’t provide documentation, I’ll have security escort you out. I am terribly busy today and I don’t have time for you stating something; but not having the documentation to back it up.” Kieran turned on his heel and had his hand on the door.
Harry handed Draco his wrist. “Go ahead, you are after all a healer.” He trusted Draco to heal him, besides in the thirty minutes Draco had been in his room he had nothing but be pleasant and polite. He knew deep down in his heart after seeing Malfoy that he did make the right decision seven years ago. Draco Malfoy had truly turned over a new leaf, and if was possible Harry liked this version of Malfoy, but was asking the healer out a risk he wanted to take. He could see the headline now The Boy Who Lived, in Relationship with Known Death Eater. Merlin this was certainly a version of torture, not quite as bad as the torture curse, but close.
“And now for the Nutrient Potion which has everything your body is lacking.” She took the cork off that phial and took the now empty phial from the child and handed him the full green potion.
“Thank you.” Kieran said leaving the office. He figured he’d poke his head into Harry’s room and check on the child before finding Adrien Burke to discuss the brain aneurysm. He walked the short distance to room 505 which was the room Harry was in. He saw the lights were off and that the young child was fast asleep cuddling the Opaleye. He watched Harry’s breathing for a few minutes to make sure the child was alright before turning on his heel to track down Burke. He was glad to see that Harry was sleeping and wasn’t having trouble with the sleep, his breathing was even, and he looked relaxed.
Draco looked around the ballroom, searching for Weasley and Hermione. He couldn't find them on the dance floor, but he spotted an open door to the terrace. Figuring they must have stepped outside for a breath of fresh air, Draco made his way to the French doors, stepping outside quietly to give them his well-wishes so he could leave.
“Oh, then it’s too bad she’s left,” Hannah said, turning her attention back to her own book. She read silently for a few minutes, paying Theo no mind. Hermione kept up her ministrations, sucking the head of Theo’s cock into her mouth. He gasped at the sensation, throwing himself back hard against the chair when she slid her mouth down, almost fully engulfing him in the wet heat.
Snape smirked, enjoying the absolutely outraged look on his godson's face. He knew Potter had told Draco about the unfortunate incident he was referring to – the wizard had asked him about it a few weeks ago, after discovering Potter's identity and correctly guessing which professor the boy had been attracted to.
? Harry wondered, frowning as he wondered if Sly thought the author was attractive. He used an extensive glamour for his publicity shots and his book tours, changing everything about himself. James Evans was his height and weight, since those were beastly to change, but he was blond, with grey eyes and striking features.
"You're such a lightweight, Potter," the older man mocked, helping Harry slide into the booth their party had claimed two hours ago when they'd arrived at the club.
"Blaise?" Harry said, and the other wizard colored, assuming Harry was teasing him about the drunken kiss he'd shared with the younger Slytherin a few years back.
"I don't know, Malfoy, do you really think it would have been possible to fake those … stimulating … chats we had?"
. There were many reasons to be nervous. The joking, carefree man he'd spent the day with seemed different here in the privacy of Draco's study, drumming his fingers absently on the arm of the chair. He looked sexy, and more than a little dangerous.
Draco's eyes were alight, and he gestured animatedly as he spoke. Blaise grinned; it was a real treat to see his best friend so happy.
"Weasley, no," Draco snapped, leaning over Theo and Blaise to grab the redhead's robes when it became clear Potter was too drunk to realize what was going on.
She stuck her tongue out at Teddy, crossing her arms. She loved playing games with him – he was incredibly smart, and a better opponent than Ron was at almost everything but chess.
"Mr. Wedgewick," Draco said, bowing formally to the shorter man. His gaze shifted to the other man who had been called back, bowing to him as well. "Potter."
Harry mirrored his actions, his teeth tightly clenched to keep from moaning as his fingers slid over the soft surface of his wand, the sensation making his stomach jump in excitement. If these random touches felt this good, what would it feel like when Draco's hands ran over his body? Harry shuddered again, letting his wand fall to the carpet.
He expected them to argue, especially Ron and Hermione, but the others simply nodded, following Pansy's lead as she retreated to the kitchen. Blaise gave them a grim smile before placing the Pensieve on the table Harry pointed to, and Ron gave his arm a reassuring pat before following everyone else, drawing the study doors shut behind him.
Harry faltered before he could tie the small package on his owl's leg, swallowing back a sudden pang of sorrow for the loss of Hedwig. It had been more than a decade ago, but it felt as fresh as yesterday after dredging up all those old memories for Draco's gift. He let the package rest on the desk, waving the owl away. He wasn't ready to send it off just yet.
"Life's about taking chances, Harry. You could bollocks it up, or you could meet the love of your life. It's a risk you've got to be willing to take."
"Immediately? But how?" Harry looked down at the floor, afraid he might lose it if he looked anyone in the eye. "Alone, then. No friends, no f-family?"
He sat back heavily, feeling utterly drained. Harry grinned as he realized he'd screamed Sly's name as he came, wondering if the other man had done the same.
Harry was instantly alert, his head pounding as he sat up quickly. He panicked when his wand wasn't under his pillow, where it usually rested while he slept, but a quick perusal of the room – and himself – reassured him that everything was fine. He'd just gone to sleep in his clothes, with his wand still in its wrist holster.
"I'm sure he was planning to tell you," Ron said, his eyes traveling to a large photo of Cal. "It's a lot, I know, but – well, I'm sure he had his reasons for keeping it a secret."
She smiled, surprised at how happy she felt for Draco – and how that happiness was tempered with disappointment, since under different circumstances, she really did think Harry and Draco might be good for each other.
Neville laughed softly, his face buried in his wife's hair. They, too, were wrapped around each other, though more decently than Harry and Draco. They darted for the Floo after Kingsley left, headed back to France. Draco had already made plans with his mother and Blaise to watch over Cal for the night, since he wouldn't be returning until morning at the earliest.
"Well, it's a moot point," Ginny said, swiping the last of the butterscotch sauce off the plate with her finger. "He's managed to get your sister up the duff, which means he'll be the father of a Weasley child. There's no getting rid of him now."
Of even bigger concern was the fact that his good friend was now completely melting over the fact that Harry had sent him a box of Muggle candy. Malted milk balls. Draco hadn't paused long enough to explain the odd gift – even odder than the autographed photo and several dozen Muggle DVDs with titles like
A few of you were worried because I hadn't updated in a few days. It's not the start of a new trend, I promise you. A bad bout of the stomach flu swept through the dracosoftie household, and caring for a vomiting toddler and husband whilst vomiting yourself just isn't very conducive to writing boylove.
Draco shifted Harry slightly so he could work a hand between them. Harry found his cock tightly trapped between Draco's hand and his own belly, the former wrapped tightly around it and moving in time with Harry's own strokes. He tried to cry out Draco's name as his orgasm overtook him, to tell him he loved him, but his lips were unable to form the words. He felt as though he was riding a wave of climax that had been building for weeks, months, years. How long had he been harboring secret affection for the snarky Slytherin who had made his school days such hell? If he was honest with himself, and in this position he could hardly be anything but, it had been well before they left Hogwarts.
For the first time in years, Harry felt nothing but pity when he looked at Zach. He'd hated him for years, but it had been a mix of revulsion and regret, tempered with worry that the Hufflepuff had been his only chance at a real relationship. Harry could see now that he'd been wrong about that. He'd never had a real relationship with Zach. They'd been together for two years, and the man didn't know him half as well as Sly.
She picked her way through the study, stepping over the scattered pages of Harry's manuscript, which blanketed the floor. From the looks of it, he'd attempted to review some of the edits and gotten frustrated at some point last night.
"Cool it," Blaise said, waving the increasingly worried house-elf away. He'd given her explicit instructions not to let Draco leave without him, and she'd popped in to tell him Draco was home moments ago. "He's with us. Doing better, then? All healed? No lingering side effects?"
"I'm afraid there's only one remedy," she said, biting her lip. Draco was leafing through the chapter on bonds, half-listening to what she was saying. "You have to get married."
“Studies show you’re a manipulative bastard who will stop at nothing, even making up research, to get his way,” Theo said dryly, throwing his Transfiguration book into his bag. He’d been falling behind this week because he couldn’t master the latest spell, and he fully intended to cloister himself in the library until he had it down, even if it took all weekend.
They'd had this conversation many times, too. He wanted to compensate her for the lost income she surely suffered from not having Harry Potter as her client, but she wouldn't hear of it. Hell, he'd love to buy her and Ron a house, or start a vault for them at Gringotts, but neither would even consider it.
Harry smiled, his arm still tingling from the shock. He'd never seen it happen before, but then again, he'd never seen
– not the way Gryffin had become. He wondered briefly how Cal would react to the man, if it ever got that far, grimacing as he compared what he knew of Gryffin to the host of other partners Draco had been through. The thought of his Godson being raised by any of Draco's old lovers was abhorrent.
"He won't," Harry answered, heaving his now mostly sober self up out of the vinyl booth. He hit both Ron and Seamus with a mild Obliviate, shrugging off the protests from Charlie that Harry never let anything fun happy.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Lavender cried when Draco approached, clearly tired of trying to coax the boys off the table.
Draco watched him go, absently wondering why Potter's quick escape didn't give him more satisfaction. He'd lived for moments like these in school – the opportunity for abject mortification for his rival – and this should have been even sweeter, since for once he'd actually forced the cocky Gryffindor to retreat.
Blaise took charge of Cal, shepherding the boy to his rooms and helping him get ready for bed. He figured Draco needed the break or at least the chance to calm down. He hadn't seen him look so stricken in years. Even the mess with Potter hadn't upset him as much as his son's innocent words.
"Most men would have been happy to have a dozen good-looking witches hanging off their arm, Harry," Hermione said with a barely suppressed grin.
Neville sighed, tired of cryptic answers. In truth, he didn't know if Draco was alright or not. He'd barely gotten more than a half-dozen words out of his friend before leaving him to question Harry.
He was well prepared to present their case for the zoning change, which would allow the warehouse to become a club, and the alcohol permit, but he didn't want to engage in a debate with local homeowners who didn't want a bar near their homes.
Draco laughed, leveling his wand at Harry to cast a discreet Sobriety Spell. It wouldn’t completely ruin the dark-haired boy’s buzz, but it would make him coherent enough to realize dancing on a table and frotting against his best friend was probably a bad idea.
Harry grimaced, hearing the underlying stress and exhaustion in her voice. She'd been so busy, between wedding preparations and work, and Ron had hardly been any help at all. Not that she would have let the man do much, but the fact that he hadn't made an effort to even try annoyed her even more.
This gushing, ebullient side to Draco wasn't one Blaise had ever seen before, but his amusement was tempered with caution. He could tell Draco was getting emotionally invested in this Gryffin – something he almost never did.
He opened his eyes, arousal spiking through him at the sight of Draco running his hands over his own body. It was almost sensory overload, watching Draco touch himself but feeling those touches glide over his own skin. Harry moaned, biting his lip to keep from crying out.
Harry laughed, a fond grin spreading across his face. With everything they'd shared over the last month and a half, he felt like he knew Sly very well. He didn't think either of them would be satisfied by a quick coffee.
Harry knocked on the door quietly, worried about waking Ginny if she was sleeping. She called out cheerily, so he opened the door and rushed over to her bed, grinning from ear to ear.
He tucked the vial into a small box, blanketing it with charms to render it unbreakable. He layered on another spell that would respond only to Draco's magical signature, ensuring no one else could view the memory. He was positive he could trust Draco with this, but he didn't want to risk it falling into someone else's hands.
"Harry, many have said you left the wizarding world five years ago because you couldn't handle the pressure of being the Boy-Who-Lived. Is that why you took up with a Death Eater? Are you rebelling against the society that has made you an emblem of national pride?"
: A dramatic turn, but we're still only a few chapters away from fluffy smut, I promise. But hey, at least Harry knows about Cal now …
Draco looked at his watch, groaning. It was nearly 9 a.m. He rubbed a hand briskly over his face, debating taking a short nap before his noon appointment at the office. He tried to visualize the work waiting for him, wondering if any of the correspondence was important enough that it couldn't wait a few more hours. And that didn't even take into consideration all the emails he'd have. Draco jolted to full wakefulness with a start. Emails. Gryffin. Mother of Merlin, he hadn't told Gryffin his trip had been extended. What must the other man be thinking? Draco nearly kicked himself. Things had been going so well, but he hadn't even given the other man a thought while he had been in France tending to Caleum.
“You know Dumbledore will say something along the lines of it happened under a different Minister and how was he supposed to foresee that it would happen.” Bellatrix muttered hearing rustling in the bed beside them. She knew their conversation didn’t disturb him; she had personally cast a silencing charm around the bed.
She pulled the blanket up around Harry and looked at her husband who was signing his name at the bottom of the paperwork. “You ready to go talk with Dumbledore?” She asked.
“What’s wrong with grey hair?” Teddy questioned morphing his hair into a deep grey shade. “See not bad.” He went back to his signature blue after a minute.
First off I'd love to thank everyone who has left a comment, kudos, bookmarked, or subscripted to any of my stories. Thank you all sooooo very much for your love and support.
“Mother you want to hear something kind of funny, apparently, Hermione and Neville are engaged. I never would have pictured those two together.” He said finishing his own glass of wine.
A day had passed and soon the family of three and the freak found themselves in a cabin in the middle of a lake; because the letters had grown progressively more persistent to the point that Vernon was finding the letters in the French Press. Harry was looking at the foggy window and rubbing at his broken wrist. Dudley was fast asleep; but the pain was keeping him awake and, in the rush, he forgot to pack the Paracetamol. He looked down at the name and ran his finger over the dragons. He wondered why the dragons and what Draco was like. It had to be a joke right, dragons didn’t exist, and were often associated with fairy tales.
Hey look an update. I think I am just as shocked as you all really. I'd say I get better at updating but for all I know it will be another few months before the plot attacks me again. So I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and I would like to think you all for the bookmarks, kuddos, and reviews. They really do make me happy. :)
“Alright while he helps you with the gown, I’m going to contact Andromeda and Regulus about your case and work on getting meetings arranged.”
Harry burst out into laughter at Draco. “I am not trying to seduce you.” He said hissing in pain at the laughter. “See what you did, you made me laugh and hurt myself further.” He pouted crossing his arms over his chest.
Kieran soon saw Harry trying to wake up and processing his surroundings. “You are still at St. Mungo’s. You had an impressive nap; how are you feeling after your nap?”
“Mm better the bubblegum.” He remarked sighing when she mentioned contacting the people, he wished he didn’t have to talk to. He wanted the help of getting rid of the abuse and getting justice for everything he had endured for almost ten years.
Harry smiled at the Healer; he felt a feeling in his stomach that he hadn’t felt in a while. It was a feeling he occasionally got during lunches at school; assuming he was lucky enough to make it down to the cafeteria before Dudley and his gang. If he didn’t Dudley would often steal his lunch for himself. It was one of the reasons Dudley was the way he was. “I feel full.”
“I guess. You said you are on my side right and that you want to help me?” Harry asked breathlessly worried that he would lose the small amount of courage he had left.
“Ron, that is great news, I am sure you are going to be an excellent father. So, what did Molly have to say?” Harry asked knowing that Mrs. Weasley had to be extremely thrilled over the news. He knew that anytime one of her children had announced they were expecting she instantly went into grandmother mode. She liked to joke that she would like a whole Quidditch team full of grandchildren.
“I’m sure you aren’t.” Draco teased setting his wand on the table. “Sorry my hands might be a little chilly.” He said running his fingers gently over Harry’s ribs as he looked for any signs of discomfort. He heard the hiss and saw Harry’s eyes turn dark like he wanted to hex him.
“I figured you might like a case, you look rather bored just filling out paperwork. I can’t help but feel you are wasting talent.” The Mediwitch, Zara, said handing him the chart.
Harry laughed at the way Draco sneered his name, he forgot how sexy Malfoy’s sneer was. “Maybe.” He said looking down at his phone. “I can have Teddy stay the night with the Weasley’s, so how about seven.” He suggested. “I’ll let you pick the bar.”
Harry sighed and reluctantly got up from the breakfast bar, he didn’t want to go to work he could already hear Theseus’s disappointed lecture and knew that today would be spent in his cubical writing report after report, along with meeting after meeting over the remaining Death Eaters. Sometimes he wished that he could do something else career wise, sure he loved when there was a raid and another Death Eater was placed behind bars, but the waiting and constant meetings ignored him to his core. He followed the blue haired boy and found himself staring at the fireplace remembering the first time he flooed and landed arse first in Borgin and Burke’s and watched as Draco and Lucius tried selling something.
Harry grumbled feeling his wand alarm going off under his pillow. “Stupid thing.” He cursed turning the blasted thing off. He rubbed his eyes the dreams of last night coming back to him, obviously, the Dreamless Sleep wasn’t working like it once did, he figured it was probably time to up the dosage. He looked at the clock on his bedside table seeing that is was 7:00 am. He sighed wishing he could just call in sick, but he knew that Theseus would appear in his living room demanding a full report. That man seriously had no boundaries when it came to his job. He would never forget the time he was sick and Theseus appeared wondering where the hell his Auror was, it didn’t seem to matter that he was literately barfing up his guts. He sighed wandering his way to the bathroom to let the shower sooth his sore muscles and to wake him up.
Andromeda smiled glad to know that Harry didn’t kick her nephew out of an exam room. “It suits him.” She answered quietly glad that Draco had found his niche in life. “So, what made you get sent to St. Mungo’s? You really ought to think about Minerva’s offer you’d be a great Defense professor.”
Harry opened both of his eyes and stared at the man. “I’m not in pain!” He exclaimed it felt like he was always in pain. “Why am I not in pain?”
Regulus felt the bile rise in his throat wondering who would tell a child such a thing about his parents. “Merlin no! Harry your parents loved you like crazy. Lily had maybe one glass of champagne at her own wedding. She rarely drank and when James did drink, he never overdid it. Who would tell that about your parents?”
Harry snickered softly at Ron’s little lecture. “Sorry I got home from St. Mungo’s later than expected, Andy wanted to have a talk, and then Teddy wanted to watch Lilo and Stitch for the thousandth time, only for him to fall asleep during it. Now come on otherwise we will be late, and you know how Hermione gets when we are late. I feel a little sore, but it’s nothing I can’t manage.” If he were being quite honest he had dealt with far worse than tender ribs.
They'd found a few ways to lessen the bond's response to other people, though nothing failsafe enough to risk going to see Narcissa or Cal. Harry knew how frustrating it was for Draco not to be able to see his son, and they'd been working hard on their meditation and relaxation techniques. Hermione had been researching the bond and how to minimize its effects.
“She’s not coming,” Lavender announced, grabbing Ron’s hand and dragging him out of the chair and toward the portrait hole.
Draco smiled. He knew his secretary was confused about why he would send his personal owl on an errand instead of entrusting it to her and one of the company's messengers or birds, but he didn't want anyone to know what was in the carefully padded package on Orion's leg.
"What?" She asked, swallowing a sticky mouthful of peanut butter. "I'm pregnant. The baby doesn't care what's going on in there," she said, cocking her head toward the study. "She's hungry."
"Did you hear that?" He whispered, sinking into a crouch, his wand at the ready instantly. He hated combat situations, and he was loath to ever use his wand for violence again, but that didn't mean those instincts had left him. He cocked his head, listening. "There."
He paused, hoping the Veritaserum would let him stop there. He almost cried out in frustration when he felt the niggling in his brain again.
“– if you just adjust your grip like this,” Hermione said, her fingers wrapped around Theo’s, changing the way he held the base of his wand, “you’ll get much better results.”
Harry met Draco's gaze, smiling reassuringly. His left hand gripped Draco's, twining their fingers. "I do hereby swear a Wizard's Oath that I intend to marry Draco Malfoy."
: The courtship continues in the next chapter. Darn those rules about touching! *grins* No worries, though. They'll find a way around it …
"Of course," Draco said, his fingers flying across his keyboard as he logged in to his email, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the new messages for one from Gryffin.
Harry read the short email for the fourth time while sipping a gorgeous glass of Shiraz from the bottle Sly had sent. Pansy sent it over via owl earlier that day. Harry had been so excited he hardly knew what to do with himself. He'd never had such a thoughtful gift, not even from lovers he had dated for months.
"Who obviously didn't get this way –" she said, expansively gesturing to her stomach, "–on her own."
"I have my own inheritance, Ms. Ireson," Harry said, giving her a cheeky grin. "But I do have a job."
Draco watched Potter warily, his hand safely cradled in his lap. Far away from Potter. Potter, who was apparently the man he'd been corresponding with for the last two months.
"I only have a few left," she said, and Harry wondered if he was imagining the apprehension in her eyes. "Friends, mostly. My family was easy, and Molly and Arthur already asked me to fill out their table with Kingsley and a few other Ministry employees."
"You don't know the half of it," Harry groaned, earning himself a playful push from his son. "Teddy's the one who helped him come up with the plan. I'm adrift in a family of Slytherins!"
," Draco gasped, letting the barrier between them dissipate. He still wanted to pounce on Harry, but he knew neither of them had the energy to follow through.
"I wouldn't miss a picnic dinner and horseback riding for anything," Blaise said with a wink. "Picnics are very
"I appreciate that, I do," he said, holding up a hand to prevent Hermione from interrupting him. "But I'm hardly a conventional bloke, am I? I'm enjoying myself. I've never had the chance to get to know a potential partner slowly like this; they always know everything about me before I know anything about them."
today?" She asked, pulling a folded paper from the diaper bag that was now her constant companion. She was continually amazed at how much
Draco mused as he studied Potter, enjoying this opportunity to ogle his former rival. To the crowd, Draco knew he looked politely engaged, remote but attentive. In reality, he wasn't catching most of the questions Wedgewick and his cronies were firing at Potter, instead concentrating on the way his full lips curved when he smiled, parting to reveal straight, white teeth when he answered their requests.
“Theo, you did it!” Hermione cried, clapping her hands in delight. The movement made her breasts bounce under her sheer shirt, and Theo groaned at the sight.
"Feeling a bit rough, are we?" he asked, smirking as he dropped a bag of sandwiches in Blaise's lap.
Blaise laughed, tickling him until he surrendered. Blaise pulled himself into a sitting position, settling Cal on his lap.
He didn't know why he hadn't left yet. He'd stayed through the cake cutting and the first dance, compelled back into the ballroom by a sense of propriety that forbade him to leave the reception without complimenting the happy couple and dutifully watching their nuptial milestones. Something intangible had kept him there, born either out of the desire to see Potter's eventual explosion or admiration of this calm, confident man the once-volatile Gryffindor had become. He wasn't sure which.
Harry swallowed, the headache he'd beaten back with a Pain Relieving Draught earlier blooming behind his eyes.
"We really should think about Fire-calling someone and telling them we're still alive," Harry panted, his legs trembling as he slid to the shower floor.
"Oh, but it is," Ron smirked, nodding to the waiter to signal for their bill. He needed to get Harry out of the restaurant before the man blew. He knew Harry would be upset about an outburst later – this
"Abraxas Wedgewick, president of the board, will read the agenda," she said, folding her hands primly in her lap as she discarded the gavel.
"No," Seamus said, Summoning several potions from a cart near the door. Draco recognized the distinctive color of Dreamless Sleep in one of the vials. "Harry was very clear that you are to stay here. I don't know what he has to do with any of this, or when you two became friends, but he seemed to think you were close enough that you'd trust him."
he thought, his teeth clenched as three more chat requests popped up, none of them from the one user he wanted to talk to, each of them cheesier than the last.
"Is Harry Potter going to come live with us?" Cal asked suddenly, pulling Blaise out of his drowsing.
Draco clenched his teeth biting down so hard his jaw ached. It had been more of a statement than a question, and he hoped the potion would let him keep his silence. The building sense of urgency in his mind shot that theory down, and he was forced to answer.
"See you around, Zach," he said, grinning like an idiot as he made his way toward the door, Ron hot on his heels.
Theo nodded, heading toward the door. He knew better than to thank Draco for the advice. The blond’s reputation had taken a beating after Seamus let it slip that the Slytherin had been the mastermind behind his romantic gesture a few weeks ago, and Draco had been amping up the cold bastard routine ever since in an attempt to salvage his image.
Draco glared at the house-elf that popped in, holding it personally accountable for the unusually late paper it held in its trembling hands. He was usually a kind master – nothing like his father had been – but he'd had a short temper over the last week. Everyone but Caleum had been reamed over something by the irritated blond lately, and as a result, no one other than Cal came near him unless it was necessary.
This letter and its ramifications will be unexpected. But if I've learned anything over these last few months, it's that the unexpected happens frequently.
He didn't look up as the footsteps stopped, though he could sense her standing over him, watching him as he crouched on the floor, moving another plant into the finished pile. He saw a take-away coffee cup appear in his peripheral vision, and Harry reached up, grabbing it without looking away from his task.
Draco let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding, looking from Neville to Harry. The other man looked much better than he had a few moments before, but still decidedly sick.
“I can’t believe she’s missing the party of the year to study,” Lavender muttered, pulling Ron toward the dungeons.
Draco smiled weakly, opening his lips this time when Seamus held the draughts up to them. He swallowed them quickly, reassured by Harry's words and eager to stop the buzzing in his head.
No one knew if Harry and Draco planned to go public with their relationship when they married or not, so Kingsley had taken precautions to ensure their secret would be kept if that was what they desired. The ancient laws required the successful courtship and promissory bond be registered with the Ministry, but once the magic involved was satisfied that had happened it didn't prevent the destruction of the actual document afterward.
Harry felt Draco's fingers slide into him, unerringly drawn to the tight bundle of nerves that made him cry out and squirm. Their mouths were still joined, tongues battling for supremacy. Harry shamelessly ground against Draco's fingers, his total focus centered on that amazingly talented hand and Draco's firm and insistent lips.
"Do you think I should tell him now?" Harry asked, his fingers absently worrying the fraying fabric on the arm of the chair.
"She's perfect. Absolutely perfect, and one hundred percent yours," Luna said, her eyes sparkling with pride and unshed tears. "You two are excellent fathers, and I know she'll be loved and cherished."
"You're on thin ice, kid," he growled, pinning Cal's arms behind his back and rolling him so he was pressed against the back of the sofa.
Zach glared at Ron, his frosty gaze shifting to Harry. The dark-haired wizard just smiled benignly, not making any move to expound on Ron's words. His careful mask hid the swirling emotions and thoughts in his mind, and the traitorous little voice that was insisting Ron was right. He
"Whatever happens, happens. We've made no promises to each other, aside from discretion. It was just dinner, Hermione, not a marriage proposal."
Draco sat back, shivering slightly as the cool night air flowed over his naked skin. He grabbed his trousers off the desk, standing to step into them. He started to leave the room, hesitating guiltily as he looked at the computer again.
Draco frowned, his eyes moving from the stack of papers to Blaise's concerned face. As much as he was interested in Gryffin – and Merlin knew, he really wanted this to work out – he wouldn't do anything that risked Cal's safety.
"Wait," he said, catching her hand as she pulled away. He nodded toward the bed, and she sat, openly curious now.
He was still grinning as he made his way toward the maitre d', hoping his he'd be able to snag the table by the window he loved. The food here was excellent, and he'd had a craving for the restaurant's paella for a few days now. Not that the food really mattered – he'd come to a decision about what to do about Gryffin.
"I'm sorry, we only have time for one question per reporter. As it stands we won't even be able to give everyone that chance. I'm sure you understand," Harry said, shooting the woman a wicked grin. "You in the black cloak. Your question?"
Bellatrix vanished the phial like she did the one from earlier. “I’ll try and remember that flavor for next time.”
“Coming right up.” Bellatrix winked at the child and then walked to the door to see what Grant wanted and to get Harry a protein shake, and a basic nutrient potion for children, and the appetite booster. “Walk with me, was just about to get the kiddo a shake for lunch and grab some potions.”
“It’s disgusting.” Bellatrix groaned resting her head on her husband’s shoulder. “I already owled Cissy and she is watching Rigel and Elara for the evening. Draco is happy to have his cousins for the night and after the day we had I am ready for a shower, bed, and some much-needed cuddles with you.”
“I demand to know about Harry Potter I am his Magical Guardian.” Albus spat rolling his eyes at the idea of Harry being treated by Slytherin slime. Kieran might have been a Ravenclaw during his time at Hogwarts, but he married a Slytherin and that made him Slytherin slime in his mind.
“Want to me to make him another protein shake, or are you going for a proper meal this time?” Grant questioned politely.
Harry didn’t exactly like the idea of them leaving him alone with the Mind Healer after all he figured this was the magical equivalent to a muggle shrink and he was hardly nutty.
Kieran sighed internally and sat down in front of the child figuring it would be easier to have this conversation face to face. “I’ve talked to one of our Neuro Healer and tomorrow we will be fixing the Brain Aneurysm since they tend to rupture; right now, that is the biggest priority since you can have a few more dosages of pain blocking potion. Tomorrow morning, we will put you asleep and you’ll wake up with your Brain Aneurysm fully healed. We want to fix the Aneurysm before it can rupture since the side effects of a ruptured Aneurysm can be severe.” He glossed over the fact a ruptured Aneurysm could lead to death no sense in totally scaring the child.
“If at any point during the night you feel like you are having trouble sleeping or find your sleep plagued with nightmares let your mediwitch or wizard know, and they’ll be able to see Kieran’s order for that potion.” She said with a wink.
“Dumbledore begged, pleaded, and moaned that we give him you as his Healer. Can’t quite grasp the fact that a simple Episky is completely below your skillset and mine at this point. Seriously I could cast that spell at thirteen, and he didn’t even cut his wand hand could have easily fixed him it himself. I owe Bellatrix a few Gallons, because she told me earlier as you were transferring the kiddo that he probably would ask about you and her.”
Your parents are going to personally haunt whoever decided to put you in this situation. So, I need you to fight, and I promise I will work with Andromeda and Vivienne to get you justice for what these muggles have caused.” He looked up and caught Kieran’s glance and mouthed ‘Take care of him for us. Severus will never forgive me if I let anything happen to Lily’s child now that we know where he is.’
“This is blue raspberry and a Draught of Peace it is going to help keep you calm while Kieran does an in-depth health scan on you.” She handed the phial to the child and watched him chug it in one go.
Ever since leaving Hogwarts Neville had ditched most of the baby weight and was rather handsome. His teeth finally straightened out and he grew into his ears, they were now proportional to his head and since the battle he grew to become good with magic, and while never considered to be much of a close friend at Hogwarts he was now.
Minerva’s shoes clicked against the linoleum and she had her wand drawn. “I told you Headmaster that Petunia and Vernon were the worst sort of muggles and now I find out poor Mister Harry Potter is a patient at St. Mungo’s. You didn’t even bother to tell me yourself, instead you send me an owl.” She turned realizing she wasn’t in the room alone with Dumbledore. She saw Bellatrix and Kieran Reid looking at her lecture awkwardly.
Neville laughed and reached for Hermione’s hand. “Ron, she doesn’t have a Dark Mark, but that’s actually a really good idea to charm your wedding ring.” He teased. “So, a Russian?” Neville questioned, he was a bit taken aback that Harry had a date it seemed like the past year he seemed more interesting in raising Teddy than dating, not that there was anything wrong with that, it just seemed a bit strange.
Bellatrix tried not to feel hurt from Harry pulling away from her touch. She adjusted herself and offered her hand for hand holding if he needed or wanted it.
All that she could think of was of her own children. Her brilliant Rigel who was so much like a clone of Kieran. The twelve-year-old who was a proud Ravenclaw and who had bested every other member of his year in terms of grades. He loved knowledge and was constantly on the hunt for more books to read. He was a wiz at Charms and often said that Flitwick was his favorite Professor.
“Let me guess accident at work?” She said taking a small sip of the wine. “Are you still pinning after him? You know it wouldn’t kill you to ask him out on a date.”
Bellatrix smiled at the child who was curled up under a few blankets looking smaller than he should. “I have meds and news about Regulus and Andromeda.” She sat down on the bed and handed Harry the potion. “You might feel a little groggy after the potion. It’s normal and you are free to take a little nap while we talk to Dumbledore.” Regulus will be in around 1pm to talk to you and Andromeda will meet with you at 2pm.” She told Harry and Kieran.
“No Harry it wasn’t a dream. You are at a wizarding hospital and they can’t hurt you.” Bellatrix said running a flannel under the tap. She sat on the other side of the bed gently bumping her shoulder against Kieran. She gently placed the cold flannel against Harry’s glistening forehead.
She opened the paper airplane note first figuring it was from Regulus regarding a time he was free to speak to Harry about Mind Healing. She saw that he would be down around 1pm to speak to them and Harry. She waved her wand and watch the note from Regulus destroy itself after all it did contain information about a patient.
Harry snorted derisively at the healer. “Like the time Mrs. Gray called social services. Fat lot of good that did for me. Just fix my wrist so the giant man can send me back.” Harry sighed he wasn’t going to be telling them anything. The last time Vernon and Petunia had a visit from a social worker it didn’t end up helping him. It only made the Dursley’s madder at him for trying to ruin their perfect image.
“I’m tempted to suggest you make one for me.” She joked. “That looks exactly like something Florean Fortescue would whip up himself.”
“Wait dragons are actually real?” Harry explained hanging onto ever word the Healer was saying about Opaleye’s.
Kieran was usually a peaceful man but seeing the pages and pages of parchment documenting abuse, malnutrition, and possible starvation made him want to visit Surry and physically ripe the throats out of the muggles that did this. An Avada Kedavra was far too kind for the muggles. He ran a hand through his dark hair and grabbed a blank piece of parchment to write up a plan to heal Harry.
“We promise if you aren’t receptive to Regulus, we will drop it with no questions. For the scan I’m going to need to get you into a hospital gown. I know you refused the idea earlier, but it allows me the best access to what I need to treat. I promise I won’t ask if you don’t want to share or elaborate. Also, if you decide to seek justice for what they have done to you the scan will be available and Bellatrix or myself might be called to testify. It is entirely up to you with whatever action you decide to seek.”
“Harry not to be the buzzkill but aren’t you worried about her using you for your fame?” Hermione asked, it was what she usually asked before Harry went on a date with anyone.
Kieran gently cradled Harry’s wrist in his hand and saw two dragons and Draco Lucius Malfoy on his wrist. “Bella he’s family.”
“What’s Hogwarts?” He asked feeling the pain in wrist intensify again. He yet again wished for a big bottle of Paracetamol right now for his wrist.
Harry sat up in the bed feeling an intense pounding in his head and chest. That nurse reminded him of Vernon and felt alarmed that someone who was supposed to help him was being so cruel. He liked the dragon he never had something that he could call his before and she so cruelly took it from him. He was also missing a blanket over his bare legs and the light was insultingly bright. He sat on the edge of the bed trying to get his bearings.
Vernon snatched the letter from his hand and tore it open. It was from that school mentioned in the letter that was placed on Harry when he was a baby. He tossed the letter into the fireplace; the freak would not be going to that school. He grabbed Harry’s wrist. “Freak, who did you tell?” He roared hearing the snap of bone in the wrist. It was the wrist with that freaky tattoo with the name and dragons.
Grant waited until Kieran, Bellatrix, and the child in the wheelchair disappeared in the direction of the elevators before summoning Dumbledore’s chart and going out to the busy waiting room. He found the bearded wizard sitting in the same chair he was in earlier. “Headmaster, I’d like to apologize for the wait. It’s been a busy day for accidents and emergencies.
“That’s awesome mate.” Neville looked at Hermione knowing now was not a good time to announce that they had finally set a date for the wedding. “I can’t wait to meet the little bundle.”
She sighed softly and took a large gulp of her wine hoping for some liquid courage since she didn’t know how Kieran would take her idea. She figured he’d understand her reasoning; but at the same time, he was kind of a stickler for rules and while she was a Black and his family, she had also been his Mediwitch which was kind of a grey area with St. Mungo’s Policies. But Regulus was his mind healer and while she knew that Severus would happily adopt Harry, Regulus couldn’t do to the policies; and she didn’t think Andromeda wanted more children since Nymphadora was out of Hogwarts and was in training to become an Auror. So, family wise that left her and Narcissa; and while Narcissa wanted more children she figured with Harry’s being Draco’s mate they might want both to have some space.
“No.” Harry pulled his knees closer to his chest to prevent her from prying off his clothes and seeing the bruises and scars lining his body. “Please no.”
“Dolores Umbridge I’d like a word.” Regulus said flatly crossing his arms over his chest realizing he was still in a tee shirt and joggers.
Vivienne walked up to the Welcome Witch desk with a warm smile on her face. “Hello. How are you doing today?” She asked politely brushing a stray piece of her red hair that was in her field of vision. “I have a meeting with Mediwitch Bellatrix Black-Reid. If you wouldn’t mind letting her know that Vivienne Riddle and Andromeda Tonks are here for her.”
Harry nodded processing what Kieran was telling him about the social worker and the Aneurysm. He wasn’t used to making his own decisions. He was used to yes ma’am, sorry ma’am, I’ll do better ma’am, and please don’t hurt me. He could tell that this time felt different than that time Mrs. Gray tired and a social worker came to the Dursley’s, and Petunia and Vernon acted like the perfect parents that Harry was just picky when it came to food and was more accident prone compared to Dudley. He couldn’t believe the social worker believed the dung Vernon and Petunia came up with regarding his care.
“That is true.” Kieran said organizing the paperwork and putting it back in the file. “I can’t even begin to imagine the suffering he had at the hands of muggles. All because the Headmaster thought it was a good idea. I imagine once Minister Riddle gets word of what happened to this child, he’ll like to personally have a conversation with the Headmaster.” He laughed softly at the thought.
“I heard about that, I’m sorry about Lucius.” He said seeing Draco’s expression, he hadn’t released Draco’s bitterness towards his father. “So, Blaise and Luna!” Harry exclaimed wondering why Luna hadn’t told him about her new relationship.
She knew Regulus was right that his parents and Sirius would personally haunt whoever placed Harry with that rotten family. She still wanted to apparate to Surry and turn those guilty into a pile of dust; but at the same time, she knew it would be too pleasant of an ending. No, those muggles needed to know true fear and pain and the only one capable of such a feat was Azkaban and a Dementor.
“Merlin’s Beard that man is persistent. I’ll talk to Kieran and see about moving Harry to another floor. Can you make me up a good chocolate protein shake? Heavy on the protein and chocolate.” She asked as she grabbed the two phials’ of already made nutrient and appetite stimulate potion. Those two potions were usually flavored already. The patients usually said it tasted of a salad in liquid form, and while children didn’t typically like vegetables, she’d try it once without the added flavor.
“I don’t remember my first time using a floo landing in Knockturn Alley.” Ron snapped watching Hermione dust the soot from his black robes. “Thanks.”
“That is the question.” Bellatrix teased standing up from the bed to make up the potion Kieran mentioned. “Blue Raspberry again?”
The three of them bent down to quickly examine the child to figure out why the child was out of bed and unconscious.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you and don’t worry about the poor dear I got him. You go home and get some rest.” Dolores said politely giving the Healer a kind smile.
“Let me get this straight, Hagrid and Minerva can stay, and you are escorting me out; because I can’t provide documentation regarding what I say is true?”
Draco grabbed his wand and moved Harry’s arm above his head as he traced over the injured ribs with his wand, a soft purple glow healing the ribs. “Your all done, fair warning you might be a little tender for the next couple of days, and I would recommend you staying out of the field until the ribs are fully healed.” He warned not wanting to see Potter back in St. Mungo’s anytime soon, although he was secretly enjoying the view of Potter’s abs. “If for any reason your ribs still bother you some Paracetamol should help with the soreness. I’ll go get your discharged papers ready.” He told the Auror disposing of the potion bottles and leaving the room with a slight yawn. He forgot how much healing could take out of him.
Kieran sat back down on the stool and grabbed his wand. “I’m going to start with your head and work my way to your toes.” The tip of his wand started emitting a light blue light as Kieran started with the top of Harry’s head the quill scribbling madly against the parchment. Listing out scary diagnoses that no child should ever have to deal with. Eventually the quill settled against the parchment meant that the scan of the head was complete.
Vivienne smiled at Andromeda for taking the lead asking those questions for she was still feeling a little nauseated. She happily took the phial of red liquid Kieran handed her, she recognized it instantly as a stomach soother. ‘Thank you.’ She mouthed to the healer and downed the potion quickly. Throwing up was so unlike her; but something about reading five pages of injuries just got to her; or if anyone did hear she’d claim she was sick with food poisoning. Yeah, that would work she ate a dodgy salad in the Ministry Canteen.
Bellatrix looked up from the bed and saw Kieran in the doorway. She quickly jumped off the bed and returned to her human form. “Most of the Medi staff on the fifth floor don’t know about my cat form; so, I’ve been watching how the interact with their patients and keeping an eye on sleeping Harry. “You’d be happy to know he’s been asleep since I started watching him. Did you find a Neuro Healer?”
Harry could smell the potion and it smelled heavily of a vegetable garden. He took a small sip in case he had issues with the taste, he found it to taste of spinach. He quickly downed the rest of the potion realizing it was at least tolerable.
Kieran thumbed through the paperwork and looked at his wife. “Yes.” He placed the parchment back into the folder after charming it so only he or Bellatrix could read it.
“I will see you guys tomorrow.” Harry yawned wishing he could have a quick nap before joining Draco for drinks, but alas it was nearly six and the last thing he wanted to do was piss off Malfoy, although a pissed off Malfoy might have been good in bed.
Kieran sat down his wand and gently tilted Harry’s face towards his own face as he sat down on the edge of the bed figuring this was going to be a deeply personal conversation. “Is everything in these pages abuse?” He asked softly gesturing the stack of parchment. “You have an unusual number of breaks; did they starve you?”
Grant knocked at the door and poked his head into the room. “Healer Reid do you have a moment?” He asked politely figuring Kieran would like to know the information Hagrid had provided about the child.
Harry looked at the envelope cautiously like it might bite him. He turned the letter over and saw a strange wax seal that had a lion, snake, badger, and eagle on it, it was unlike any of the other envelopes in his hand.
Bellatrix grabbed a blue potion and uncorked the phial. “This is more pain receptor blocking potion that way you can get a proper night’s rest not feeling anything hurt or ache.” She handed the child the potion and watch his eyebrows raise. “I remembered you liked Blue Raspberry.” She teased softly taking the empty phial back.
Bellatrix placed her head on Kieran’s shoulder feeling the room feel a little quitter as her magic relaxed a little bit being in her husband’s arms. The books on the bookshelf were still and the room felt a little less angry. Kieran was great at grounding her anger when she started to feel out of control. Her anger didn’t happen all that often but when it did, it could rivel just about any active volcano. “That poor baby.” She muttered tears slipping from her brown eyes.
Harry raised an eyebrow listening to Draco’s muttering. He knew it couldn’t have been easy for the Slytherin, but he didn’t realize people were still harping on the war. He was still fucked up from the war, but he told no one about his constant night terrors, his mild addiction to the Dreamless Sleep potion, or the fact that he had to cast ‘Muffliato’ in fear of his screaming waking up Teddy. “I got hit with Cruciatus curse for a minute before Neville was able to stun Yaxley. I also got hit with several Bombarda Curses. It feels like a Hippogriff is doing a gig on top of my chest.” Harry admitted honestly. “I also think my wrist might be broken.”
Bellatrix smiled softly at her husband seeing the whipped cream running down the child’s chin. She grabbed a flannel from the cabinet and ran it under the warm water. Soon she heard the telltale sound of Harry mostly slurping in air instead of delicious liquid. She handed Harry the flannel and took the empty cup from the child.
He waved at Grant who was at the large workstation in the middle of everything and went to room three to poke his head into Harry’s room to check on the child. He poked his head into the room and saw that Harry was curled into a little ball the blanket covering him and the child was fast asleep. He sat down at the desk and opened the file to plan how to heal Harry’s injuries and everything else. He saw that the lab work he had requested was in on Harry. He grabbed the parchment the text unscrambling before his eyes. His blood ran cold seeing that Harry was iron deficient, was severely deficient in all the vitamins, his potassium was terrifyingly low.
Harry finished his hot fudge sundae in record timing really, he could have sat a new record for fastest hot fudge sundae ever eaten. “Dinner was great.” He said honestly dinner probably could have tasted horrible and to him it would have still tasted amazing.
“Your lab results show several nutrient and vitamin deficiencies so starting now and after we discharge you from St. Mungo’s we will have you take a nutrient potion and appetite booster until at least the end of this year. Unlike physical injuries that takes a while to fix. I’ll also meet with a nutrition healer and see if they can think of any specialty potions that I’m not thinking of or prescribe often.” He said honestly, he was an Accident and Emergency Healer who was used to breaking minor curses, fixing Quidditch injuries, and whatever else was basic enough that didn’t get sent to one of the more specialized floors.
Grant sighed wishing he could leave Dumbledore out in the waiting room for a while. “You know he will probably try to request you or Kieran.”
Harry wished after that display that he would have just stayed at home, he figured Theseus would be pissed, but not that pissed. He trudged back to his cubical and grabbed a stack of empty parchment and a self-inking quill and sat to writing his report, all that he wanted to do was go back to his bed, our perhaps Malfoy’s bed. He seriously needed to stop thinking about Malfoy because the last thing he needed to do was pull the memory. He could almost see Scamander’s face if he gave his boss a phial of his memories about Malfoy. He shoved those thoughts away and brought his wand to his temple retreating his memory of yesterday. He looked at his watch seeing it was about time for lunch, he felt sort of productive after all he had the memory retrieved and his report was nearly halfway finished.
"Since this press conference is about our family and not my career, I'll have to ask that any questions about my books be directed to my agent," he said, nodding toward Hermione. "Hermione Granger-Weasley can answer any inquiries you may have."
is in the next chapter, so just be patient. It's nothing dark or bad, and it's nothing that would force Draco to do anything he doesn't want to do. Harry has no plans other than fluffy romance, I promise.
Draco growled, grabbing his wand and quickly warding the portrait so Severus couldn't come back. He tapped it against his bracelet, muttering the countercharm that severed the connection between the bracelets. The feeling of Harry's hand on his cock vanished.
Draco rarely left during the day unless it was to attend a meeting or pop over to see his son for lunch, so the witch was a bit concerned.
Draco sighed, throwing himself into an elegant heap on the sofa. He could see he wasn’t going to win this one, and truth be told, he didn’t want to push Theo any further. He admired his friend’s determination, even if he questioned his methods. Then again, Theo didn’t have millions of Galleons in the bank as a safety net should his career plans tank. He was from an old pure-blood family, but they’d lost most of their money during the first rise of Voldemort.
Ron had been unable to spare Draco from this interrogation, going so far as to file a formal complaint against his supervisor when the man insisted on bringing the Slytherin in. As a result, he had been barred from the interrogation, which may have been a blessing in disguise. Draco wasn't sure he wanted Harry's best friend to have access to him while he was under the influence of Veritaserum.
Oliver wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders, dipping his head to press a kiss against her neck.
Draco gave him an easy shrug, smiling slightly. "I wouldn't know. I run Malfoy Industries. Keeps me pretty busy."
More shocked looks and frantic scribbling. He almost felt sorry for them. He and Draco were dumping so much newsworthy information on them all at once that they'd likely have a hard time figuring out what to lead with.
"Draco?" Neville asked tentatively, wondering if Harry had known the gift would upset the man. Was that why he'd asked him to be there when Draco opened it? Why would Harry have sent something that would distress the man he was courting?
"Nev and Daph," Draco explained, carefully transferring crispy pancetta pieces to a towel to drain. He threw chunks of chicken into the pan, letting them sizzle in the rendered fat.
"The club?" Harry asked, and Draco nearly bit his tongue to hold back his retort. Potter wouldn't like this – hell,
"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry whispered, pulling him closer. The scene dissolved again, and Draco flinched as he saw Harry and his friends battling against a dragon, marveling – even through his horror – that they'd managed to ride it.
Blaise grinned, feeling lighter than he had in weeks. If that was Draco's last objection, then things were about to get much better for the blond and everyone subjected to his moods.
"Where did you even learn that spell?" Ron asked, his heart still pumping frantically, adrenaline coursing through his veins. He'd been so certain Harry had been about to die.
She nodded woodenly, saying her goodbyes before extinguishing the fire. If Draco had reacted that badly to finding out his mystery man was James Evans, what in Merlin's name would he do when he found out he was actually Harry Potter?
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They don't belong to me outside the confines of my overactive imagination.
Severus. Draco's grin widened as he stared at Potter, unable to stop the words that flew from his mouth.
"I haven't had the chance to say it, but thank you," Draco said softly, settling into a chair a safe distance away from Harry's.
Draco chuckled, a dark sound that seemed to be directly tied to Harry's aching cock. He felt himself grow harder, something he'd not have thought possible just moments earlier, at the deliciously wicked laugh.
Draco's eyes snapped open, his body stiffening. Hair Thickening Potion's main ingredient was bicorn horn, and combined with the aconite in Veritaserum it would create thick fumes that were extremely poisonous. The effects were similar to a strong Memory Charm, essentially Obliviating the person unlucky enough to breath them.
"Fine," Harry rasped, forcing his gaze to move from Malfoy to Hannah, who was half-standing, leaning across the table to try to rest a hand on his forehead. "Sit, sit. I'm fine."
He clenched his jaw, willing himself not to fidget so the witch could finish pinning his tuxedo. Hermione had chosen to go with Muggle dresses and tuxes for the wedding, since her family would be in attendance. They'd still marry under wizarding tradition – meaning a full bonding ceremony – but she thought dressing the wedding party in Muggle clothing might make her family feel more at ease. Most of their guests, of course, would likely still come wearing robes, but there wasn't anything she could do about that.
“You aren’t drunk, maybe if you chugged both of your cocktails.” Draco smirked seeing Harry’s face. “Sure, we could try this again, I’m off tomorrow how does dinner sound at my place?” He suggested with a wink.
Vernon kicked open the kitchen doorway and found the small freak drying the dishes. “Good fairy.” Vernon muttered. “How about you check the mail after you’re done with the dishes.”
Narcissa giggled softly to herself at the thought of that relationship. “You can’t help who you fall in love with.” Merlin knows she wished she could. “Let me know how the date goes.” She said hugging him and kissing his forehead. “I love you Draco.”
Ron yawned leaning against the side of the elevator. “I can’t remember the last time I was expected to write this much, honestly it feels like I’m back in first year potion class.” He grumbled wanting food and quite possibly a nap. He hated the paperwork and the whole political subtext the Ministry had, he wanted nothing more than to quit his job and take George and Fred on their offer to become a manager at Weasley Wizard Wheezes, especially now that he and Padma had a little one on the way.
“A friend who works at London Grace as a nurse, she’s one of my closest friends since moving back. He said getting out of his seat to place their order to the bartender. “She’s the one who introduced me to this place, I like it because it’s quiet and not a lot of people know about it.” He said as the bartender brought over the two drinks and the jumbo salted pretzel with a large bowl of cheese.
She grabbed the pain potion from the shelf along with the blue raspberry syrup from the flavor shelf towards the bottom. She dropped five drops of flavoring into the phial and then dropped the dosage of pain potion into the phial. She topped it with the cork and gently spun the phial in her hands. She placed both the flavor and pain potion back on the shelf the belonged on. She grabbed the phial and went back to Harry’s room finding her husband working on paperwork.
“Thank you Nixxie.” He told the house elf going to the bedroom to change out of his robes and into Slytherin jumper and pair of fleece pajama bottoms. He lovely looked at his bed and headed into the bathroom to brush his teeth and to moisturize his face. Hospital air just did something to his skin.
“So, you just think I’m crazy?” Harry crossed his arms over his chest and glared at the Irish man. His left tucked protectively under his armpit.
For those who might be wondering what is going on with my other story The Edge of a Revolution have no fear I haven't given up on it. I am just having issues with one of the chapters and am in the process of rewriting the earlier chapters. Then the idea popped into my head and wouldn't leave me alone. So here we go.
Vivienne stood up after a few moments noticing her throw up had disappeared and the office smelled of a citrus instead of barf. “I do apologize.”
“Grant, if you need me, I’ll be on the fifth floor tending to Harry.” She told the other Mediwizard.
“I only came back to London three months ago, back when Lucius died.” Draco said resisting the urge to spit the name of his father. He was secretly relieved that Lucius had died in Azkaban, he didn’t have to worry about his father somehow judging him from his life choices. Ilvormorny is a very long story, as is why I’m now a muggle doctor.” He whispered softly. “Blaise and Luna Lovegood are apparently dating. Pansy and Theodore Nott recently married.”
“It’s going to be a good morning.” Bellatrix teased her husband as she walked over the giant that had just landed. “Hagrid?” She questioned wondering why Hagrid was in the accident and emergency ward. “What’s going on?”
Harry again took the green potion from her hand and quickly downed the potion. Again, it tasted of various vegetables with just a hint of dirt. It wasn’t terrible; he could think of so many things that tasted worse. Dudley’s dirty gym socks stuffed into his mouth was a great example. He was fairly sure those socks were washed once a year. He handed the phial back to Bellatrix and sat up in the bed glad to not feel any pain when he moved his legs. He figured the lack of pain was only temporary but even a few days without feeling like everything ached was incredible.
“We promise kiddo, no going back to the muggles if you tell us what has happened. I’d also like to an in-depth health scan it will tell me everything that has ever happened to you over the course of the years and I’ll be able to heal any previous issues that didn’t quite heal right the first time.” Kieran took a breath before moving onto his next issue at hand.
Teddy woke up and ran to the kitchen knowing that Kreacher would have breakfast waiting on them both. “Morning Kreach.” He teased the elf who handed him a glass of orange juice.
Bellatrix placed the note down and went back to the bed. “Harry I’m going to get the medication Kieran wants you to have; is there a certain flavor you are partial to?” She asked knowing that children often appreciated having their potions flavored to dilute whatever flavor the ingredients naturally gave it.
A loud ‘thud’ at the wooden door brought him out of his thoughts. He thought about waking up Vernon or Petunia but figured he’d only get in trouble for waking them and after all it was probably a bird accidently running into the door.
“Yeah Neville is an Auror, as is Ron.” Harry stated before uncorking the phial and chugging the contents. He wondered how Draco knew this potion tasted terrible but he let that question go.
Harry listened to Draco while chewing his bite of pretzel. “I imagine it couldn’t have been easy making the decision to finish your education across the pond in some unknown country. I’m surprised to didn’t choose to attend Beauxbatons or Durmstrang.” He said wondering what made Draco decide to run away to America.
“I’d love that it sounds painfully simple.” Kieran teased snatching the file from Grant’s hands and going into room four. “Hello! I’m Healer Kieran Reid.” He greeted politely sitting down on the stool. “So, what knee did the Bludger hit?
Reg, had to move Harry to the fifth floor due to Headmaster prying. See you soon. She transfigured the parchment into an airplane, and watched it fly out of the room.
“Alright you don’t have to.” Bellatrix knew that reaction from previous patients that the child was certainly hiding something nasty under the oversized jumper and didn’t want the questions.
“Alright, we will look into that once we get back to the Ministry.” Vivienne remarked. “Andy and I would like to meet with the child, but I don’t think this is the right time. He probably feels overwhelmed with Mr. Black-Snape and we would not want to overwhelm him any further. Why don’t we figure out a date after his healing with Mr. Black-Snape to discuss what he’d like to do about the abuse.” She stood up dusting the invisible crumbs off her grey dress.
“We gave you a medication to numb your pain receptors. So, you won’t feel pain.” Kieran sat down on the stool in the room. “I was thinking Shepherd’s Pie for dinner; but is there something you’d rather have for dinner?”
Narcissa hated the seven years her son was gone, it was so good to have him back. “A lot has happened in seven years, and I couldn’t be more proud of you.” She said finishing her glass of wine, she knew Draco had worked hard his last year at Ilvormorny, she knew how excited he was when he was accepted into Harvard’s MD and Healer program. She would be eternally grateful for Harry Potter and what he had did for her and Draco.
He gently pulled back Harry’s gown to examine the back and limbs and let out of a loud gasp upon seeing a nasty burn that hadn’t healed. “What happened here?” He asked gently examining the burn and he was certain it looked like the end of a fireplace poker to adjust logs.
“Certainly.” Regulus said heading off in the direction of his office and his pensive. It was oftentimes helpful to view the memories with his patients to work through the trauma and that is when he noticed his husband sitting on the floor next to his office door.
Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes at Malfoy, was it integrity possible that maybe underneath the blonde Malfoy hair lay a kind person? In the hour, Draco, had been attending his injuries he had been pleasant almost caring even.
He apparated out of his apartment onto a narrow street about a block away from the address Draco had texted. He walked the short block finding Draco Malfoy leaning against the restaurant. The blonde was dressed rather nicely in a pair of tight dark jeans that clung to his arse, a cranberry oxford shirt, and a pair of brogues. “Hey.” Harry greeted feeling suddenly nervous because judging from the sign it wasn’t drinks but rather a restaurant named ‘The Breakfast Club.’
