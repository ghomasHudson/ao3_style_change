They all have a lot to learn :)
Rosier can hear the smirk in the man's voice. Playful.
"What is it?" Harry asks and Draco holds the stare only for a beat longer before slowly shaking his head. Harry doesn't know. Either he is unaware of this little incident of his, or he doesn't think that Draco's noticed. Or maybe, and most interestingly, Harry Potter doesn't give a shit about what Draco thinks about him at the moment, and is just blurting out a natural, automatic response as a result of Draco's eerie staring.
But today, in that cave, whatever the potion had made Albus see… It had rattled him. He knew, theoretically, that Albus was just another wizard. Powerful, yes, with his hands in too many schemes to count. Intelligent and manipulative, yes. But also, just another man with pasts, and regrets.
The damage was done, not only is Albus now accused of endangering his students, but also for helping a convicted criminal. He's gone now. Severus is sure they would not be able to see or hear more of him unless he wants them to.
Ron curses under his breath, "Cannot he write to us?"
With one last gasping heave he sits back on his heels and looks around the darkened bathroom, his chest slightly heaving as he pants for breath and listens to the silent sounds of the cottage. He feels satisfied, unimaginably, and heinously satisfied with what he had done to Lucius and Rosier.
"You're not supposed to address your elders or people with higher blood status or political standing without their official title. But Severus is my godfather. So I can abuse the system."
His hands twitch at his side, and his eyes narrow. If Umbridge could, he is sure she would be skipping right now. She sounds way too cheerful than anyone has the right to be in such a situation.
Harry knows so, even though he also knows that this should be logically a creation of his own mind. He remembers going to sleep in Draco's arms in the station, he remembers his heavy eyelids finally falling close, and his aching body fading into the background.
Draco thinks he can intimidate a fucking muggle into giving him something that didn't come out of trash. If he can't even do that much, then what is he?
Harry throws one last desperate look at Malfoy, who doesn't return it, before slowly pushing himself to his feet. Umbridge watches his every move, a disgustingly wide smile on her face, stretching it like pliable dough.
"You really helped me out there," He tells the unconscious boy as he dabs his face clean, cringing at the thin trails of scabbed blood that have formed tendrils on Draco's face, the source of the infection. "Or I did. Not sure what the deal with the forest thing was all about."
Minerva gestures at them to shuffle closer, "Remus will be overseeing your detention in my absence."
Kingsley leans down over his own parchment, his brows knitted in concentration. "Tonks?" he doesn't look up. "You still haven't handed in your report."
Rosier's eyes narrow. "Which one?"
He has nothing to treat this. Not even water. He bites his lip, and reaches to Draco once more. “You need to wake up,” Harry curses his shaking hand and does it again. It might as well be pointless, Draco is like an inferno already, he could be delirious at this point.
Hedwig nibbles his hair, and affectionately rubs her face to his cheek. Harry sits on Uncle Vernon's chair, discontented by the ticking clock that's the only source of noise in the house. The soda stays unopened in his hands.
None of the machines are working, they look gigantic, infused in the walls, surrounding them from all sides.
The barn too, is abandoned, just like he’d thought. There are none of the animals tottering around like they had been the last time. One of the large doors is broken and hanging off the hinges. The paint is peeling and dull in the moonlight. It feels as rotten as Draco is feeling inside.
Harry grapples at the hands, the one blocking his mouth is hard enough to bruise, and his scalp prickles as Rosier starts pulling him backwards. Further away from the wards.
Harry has the urge to drink more water from his glass but holds Moody's eyes instead. "Not at all," he says.
"You know how I've never asked anything of you before?" He asks the apathetic man lounging on the couch, his hair unkempt and his tattooed chest bare under his blue sleeping robe.
"What about you? Does it hurt? Do you need a pain reliever?”
They clink their spoons together.
Draco groans once more and Harry swears, struggling to get on his knees before the boy. He has been an idiot. He’s been so worried and preoccupied with his own torture, and the werewolf thing that he completely forgot about infections.
"Potter, I need you to understand something, first and foremost. You. Weren't. There." Severus doesn't know when he stood up, but he is now standing, an arm's length away from Potter as the boy stares up at him, "Not when Narcissa was dying and not while Rosier was being punished. You never left this cottage or your home in Surrey, you never left your bed." Severus leans down, trying to drill the fact into Potter's head, "You seeing it from a certain point of view doesn't necessarily mean you are the wrongdoer."
He steers clear away from them and heads for the park, judging by the darkening sky and rolling clouds, it should be mostly vacant by now.
His hands have seemingly gone numb, and he can't get a good grasp on his wand, but Umbridge is still speaking, "The Dark Lord would be most disappointed, Draco. He had such high hopes for you."
"Why are you helping me?" he asks. He’s finally lowered his wand, but he can feel the ornate handle leaving indents in his palm as he holds it, trying to let it anchor him.
"It's fine," Harry waves him off. "I've noticed a pattern in the wards, they cannot get in here every day."
Kingsley cocks an eyebrow at the man, Murphy's earlier words ringing in his head. This isn't just incompetence. It's ignorance, bold, and repressing. Kingsley is very glad that he's joined the order once again. At least he's actually doing something for the war effort.
"Thanks," he says and Draco nods back, promptly digging back into his food. Harry doesn't know what the other boy's intention is behind the nice exterior, it's making Harry feel guilty, and all… weird inside. He doesn't know what to call it yet, he stashes it away as he picks on his beans.
It's like being squeezed through a narrow tube, it's disorienting and everything is blurry for a moment. Harry screams but can't hear a thing over the high whistling in his ears.
"By two percent," Draco shoots back, his logic was overpowering, it squashed down any hope with hard facts, like a boot trampling ants.
"Are there any further comments you wish to make regarding this accident, Minister Fudge?"
Severus purses his lips, well. The poison must be fading. At least that’s what he hopes. He hasn’t touched any of his old potions journals in literal decades, so the details are somewhat blurry.  He waves his wand in a simple purifying spell. And Albus relaxes minutely. He’s still severely dehydrated. Severus urges him to drink more water but the man refuses until Severus has looked at the Horcrux.
"Yeah?"
"Do not test me anymore, Evan," Evan's head lolls back to stare into Malfoy's eyes, grey and blue ornate with streams of murkish blood.
"Yeah but still," Harry's green eyes are stitched to his behind his glasses, "Don't you miss them? Any of your friends?"
"Still, such nasty claims." They look at the cursed article lying in the middle of their essays. Harry's face is plastered under the headlines. "I've known the boy since he was eleven,"
“There’s a-” he gasps out, pointing at the bag he’s still carrying, “A robe. The blood.”
Severus has seen Crucio victims before, hundreds of times, throughout his youth and onward. The degree varies, from Mad-Eye Moody's twitching eye to Frank Longbottom's constant seizures. Potter is dangerously tipping toward the latter.
"No," Harry says, a little sharper than he’d intended.
"My lord,"
"Still sounds strange," Draco murmurs, straightening up and dusting off his clothes. He cannot afford to ruin a second set of school robes.
"I think that is Professor Dumbledore's business. His choices in life don't define my reactions. As you just said, I'm only a child, and there's no danger threatening me at this moment, even if it were, you're here to protect us, Professor, " he takes a deep breath and musters up the fakest smile he has ever had pasted on his face, it feels greasy and disgusting. "Don't you think so as well?"
“Now, isn’t that tear jerking?” a foreign voice drawls. Rosier’s eyes are narrowed and his wand lazily points to Lucius as he leans against the fireplace, his other hand dusting off soot. It's because of years of experience as both a Death Eater and a spy that Severus keeps from letting out a litany of profanities from his mouth. Potter has no such reservations as he stumbles back, almost plopping to the floor before steadying himself against the wall.
"What's the favour?"
well,” she says, flicking her head towards Harry’s prone form, the boy has stopped trying to get up now and is watching them with blank, glazed eyes. “You need to take him to Slughorn. Horace Slughorn in Tattershall, in Lincolnshire, he will know how to help, but you don't have much time. There's going to be--"
Draco’s eyes flick over to Potter’s right hand. Which is… bloody again. There isn’t as much blood as yesterday, at least, not much that he can see, but it’s still smeared all over his hand.
"What am I writing?" Harry asks but knows the answer anyway.
Sirius gives a frustrated sigh, "How can you all hate this robe so much?!"
He's being too dramatic.
Harry doesn’t let him fall and the pain fades back to an almost manageable level eventually. And eventually lasts longer than he really wants to admit. His vision feels permanently tunnelled, edged with darkness. His breaths are laboured and he can feel Harry vibrating against him.
Harry
Murtlap Essence. Malfoy. That's all Harry tries thinking about. Because this detention had to end at some point. She's interrogating him, and Harry is in so much pain and frustration from his hand alone that he doesn't even care about the reason. He just wants to leave this office, before burning it to the ground.
Harry allows a small nod before turning away to the carrots once more.
"Insomnia, huh?" says Bill, crossing his arms on the kitchen table. "I've heard you had a rough day,"
Harry is getting more overwhelmed by the minute, even more so than when that man had rescued him from the Dementors. And
He wants to pull out his wand and cast multiple
“Do you want your fun or not?” Harry cannot see, but Bellatrix’s tone is dry and almost cooled with an air of unimpressed impatience.
His ears ring with no respite. Just ringing over his thoughts.
Hello dear all! We are SO in love with this chapter, and the one after this one~~~ Stay tuned for all that amazingness! Thanks a world to our Beta, you rock!
"All that stolen money though."
It cannot be the torture. Draco knows better than that. He just fed Potter, they exchanged words and he seemed sane enough. Besides, Draco has seen people who had gone mad due to the Cruciatus curse. Their eyes are never void of any emotions, they're overfilled with a conflicting abundance of them. Too much for anyone to handle, and the truth is, they don't. That's why they're called insane.
Yeah, he would do that. Nodding firmly to himself, and then stopping because it made him dizzy, he quickly climbs up the last set of stairs to the tower.
Harry hasn't heard of the man since the big scare the other day. He's still not quite sure of how it happened, but Remus appeared the night after, looking disgruntled and quite distressed as he pulled Harry aside and quietly told him that 'Yes, he's okay, and yes, it really was him, and no, he's not hurt, just shocked, '
Harry bites his lip for a beat. “Anything?”
With a sigh Harry shoves the bucket in the shed and walks inside, making his way to the kitchen to make lunch. Aunt Petunia is already there, wiping the counter with a rag but intently glaring at him once he makes his way inside.
His eyes flicker over to the window again. He wonders where Hedwig is right now. He almost regrets sending her away this evening. He doesn't want to be alone.
Harry dumps his cloak and album in the pile and grabs Hedwig's cage, his footsteps thundering against the floor as he races down for his pet. "Hedwig!" He calls and the owl comes flying at him, hooting.
“You’ve still got a lot of blood on your face,” Harry says quietly.
He’s being stood up. It takes a lot to be stood up by someone like Potter, especially after humiliating himself by offering to actually help the daft prat, but here he is, idly glancing around and huffing in irritation.
The one which his father had returned.
"She didn't say. She actually let me leave early because of the Dursleys’ death." Draco looks at Potter incredulously, past curfew is early? But then the rest of the sentence registers.
When Harry smiles up at her and she winks, when Harry's hand squeezes his wrist across the table, the waitress is the last thing on Draco's mind.
It's nauseating, frankly.
Warning(s) for: explicit language, mild/ referenced violence
"It's certainly not good, how many vials have you taken?"
“Are you asking me for personal experience?” is the man’s bereft reply and Harry rolls on the floor, facing away so that Draco wouldn’t see his face, damp in perspiration and his own drool. It’s disgusting.
It takes Draco a second to make his lips move against Harry’s. Warm and salty from tears. He can barely smell Harry, the scent of spices and their cleaner, over the smell of blood. But it’s there.
Harry's more than sure that it will.
Had he not been present in the Order meetings? The meetings declaring Umbridge as a threat, and that he must remain as far from Hogwarts as possible, and not try to contact anyone? Especially without prior notice. And he had to come in barging like the Knight Bus right in the middle of an arrest by the Ministry just to give Potter a ridiculous gift, endangering himself, three order members, and worst of all, mucking all over Albus' reputation.
"And I have my reasons for having spring rolls for breakfast, doesn't mean I'm right."
Draco agrees with him but there's no other choice.
"Come in," comes the muffled voice of the minister as Kingsley knocks. He turns the knob and walks in, softly closing the door behind him.
His mind has a lot to catch up on. Draco is painfully aware of how Potter seems to be surprising him on every turn, he’d expect him to do something and Potter completely disheveled every possible expectation by doing the opposite, or offering something entirely new to the table. Potter is supposed to be predictable. It is disorienting. Off-putting. And Draco doesn’t like it.
She's certainly not helping things. Two days have gone since Potter and Draco's absence and Dolores had not even once addressed their absence. The contrast between her, and the panicking staff was entirely comical at first, and merely pathetic once Potter's friends started getting really worried. Weasley had a detention with her now, if Severus is not mistaken. For blowing up at her in her class, apparently, Granger hadn't shown up to two of her classes along with the red headed boy.
Two means no lunch for Harry.
Twinky looks just as taken aback at the question as Draco, but then quickly composes herself and answers, “Twinky, sir.” She had always been the best elf in the Malfoy household.
Draco winces, more walking. "What if we took another--"
"You git."
Before either of them can continue the thrilling and yet mind-numbing banter there's a loud crack resounding from the porch. Harry's eyes widen, burning into Draco's as one of his hands close around the peeler and the other whips out his wand.
"Sure. And Ron?"
And at long last! The wait is over. Happy reading!
A bunch of thanks to our beta and feel free to tell us your thoughts on the chapter!
Ron growls, "This isn't a news conference. Harry is off-limits, either keep your silence or get out. We will start by reviewing some of last year's defence spells, and shields
Harry makes a face, "Maybe."
"What about the Dursleys?" He doesn't know why he asks.
"Remus, what is going-"
"What, you don't like it? Stop laughing, oh my god, you're awful!" Harry swats at Draco’s thigh.
Draco looks out the window, "I can't believe 'Market Deeping is the name of an actual place," Draco mutters, as they pack up their meal and shoulder the bag.
"This will be our secret," Harry tells Hedwig. He needs something sugary to keep him on his feet, and he knows that there's no chocolate around. Soda has to do for now. In the most likely scenario, he could say that Death Eaters took it when they attacked him. The thought brings a wry smile to his lips, even though he knows he would be far from smiling then.
sent a thrill of unease through him.
Harry’s not in the bathroom. He’s not in the kitchen or the living room either.
Harry didn't move one bit in reaction to Draco's fidgeting, or the scream.
Draco for his part seems to be enjoying his food, and doesn't seem to mind the awkward tension around the kitchen at all.
Val's eyes flash, "There's a clear difference between paranoia and common sense."
Harry doesn't allow his mind to follow through with the mental forehead slapping that is bound to come whenever he's being particularly dense. "That doesn't mean he's your godfather," Harry says, and he has a good point. He calls Remus and Bill and Charlie by their names, and they're not his guardians.
“Potter,” Severus says, himself a little breathless.
Sirius wiggles his eyebrows with an impatient huff. "So? Chop chop! Go do your thing,” he waves his hand, “Also someone bring me a pepper up from the kitchen."
"Harry?" asks Mrs. Weasley, exchanging an uneasy glance with her husband. "Maybe we should call Poppy and-"
He doesn't dare call Twinky again, this had to do for now. Just thinking about this makes Harry's hands tremble harder, because maybe, just maybe, he shouldn't be treating Draco at all. Maybe this death would be more merciful than the one awaiting them once Voldemort returned.
Green lights have already started flashing in his mind. He waits for it, his mother's desperate cries, that final scream that rings out,  not out of pain, but of fear. His mother's fear for him, he waits for it and it never comes, instead, there's only a myriad of green lights, and the faint echo of a statement which has been haunting him since the graveyard, curling up and burrowing into his chest and seizing him in its numbing grip. ‘
Harry sighs a little as he finishes the glass. His hands are still trembling badly. Draco doubts he could have held the glass himself even if he’d wanted to.
The feel of his neck against the back of Draco's head, his warm breath and his voice, although Draco has no recollection of what the words actually were.
There's a certain skip in Rosier's step, not easily noticeable but there nonetheless. He feels content, on a high. The rush of blood and the ear-blasting sound of the explosion is still ringing in his ears, the sheer
"Why wouldn't she? She had a double-edged blade, one for the ministry, and one for whomever she works with. Silencing Potter was the main objective in both groups. We have been too lax with your protection." Severus shakes his head once as he takes out a vial for the blood, mouth twisting in a sneer while speaking about Umbridge.
"They're Auror Partners," Ron says, "Apparently, really good together on the field too. Kingsley used to work with Sirius, like...way back during the first war."
“Where did you get these from?”
“Master?” Harry purses his lips. That has to be Lucius Malfoy. Of course, he wouldn’t let his son die. “He sent you?”
"A fucking dementor nearly sucked my soul dry today!" He slams his hand on the wooden table and it burns, but he doesn't care. "A man kidnapped me and then shoved me back to my house, defenseless and alone, I was so alone and you were all here?!"
"Foolishness," Fudge says and stares at John, who has carefully not instructed his quill to write down a single word.
It’s happening, because then Harry’s closed his eyes and his lips are on his.
This isn't good. Not good at all. He's beyond dead, a walking corpse really. Not once, not
“He’s burning up! It’s an infection, not a scraped knee. Infection kills, I don’t know why or how, but I know that much. Infection kills. What do I do,”
"How can I not? Do you have any idea--"
"Ummm…"
Harry is kissing him.
"I need to be with him. I like being with him," Harry says firmly. He won’t let Sirius- his own subconscious- ruin this.
If he leaves now, he won’t be back. He knows he won’t. This place is warded by the Fidelius charm and he doesn’t even know which county they’re in. If he leaves now, he’d be stepping into a dark abyss of uncertainty. He doesn’t have the faintest idea of where Harry is now. He could be walking into a full-blown Death Eater meeting.
"You're my best friend,” he continues undeterred, blinking back tears, “It's so weird, saying that. But you are. Just like Miss Simons, and Remus, and Ron and Hermione and even Puppy. You're all the same essence."
Draco's mouth turns dry as he glances down at the shell wrapped around his wrist.
“Go, Severus!” Lucius yells, he casts a shield around himself to evade Avery’s curse. Another blasting curse from Rosier, who is now getting up on his feet again, makes the whole room shake as the table is split apart. Draco staggers backwards, his head knocking against the fireplace as he grasps at its edges.
Harry stops walking.
"-CHECK THERE?" A deep male voice is shouting. "How many times have I told you-"
Harry regards the small, clear stream and then kneels to run a careful hand into the trickle. It’s cool against his fingers, and just by staring at it, Harry can tell that it’s the cleanest, most purified water he has ever seen.
"But it looks-"
The first rule of survival in Harry's books is 'adapting', but in this instance, he's not quite sure whether that's what's at stake or his general resignation regarding his fate. Because he is resigned to it.
This is one of our most emotionally charged chapters and we really hope you like reading it as much as we loved writing it. Thanks a bunch to our beta!
Albus closes his eyes and falls back against the couch, his skin pale and breathing slower than before.
"You don't sound too sure,” Draco laughs. “No, let me try again...hmm, Auror doesn't seem your type.” He cocks his head to the side, “A professor?"
"We need more. And a map, probably. Come along,"
Chapter warnings for; graphic depictions of torture, explicit language, blood and violence, panic attacks, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), minor character death.
Harry pushes himself off the mirror wall, and looks down, and it's the fucking mirrors again. He's walking on it. He's leaning on it. That's all there is.
"Okay," he says, breathless, “Okay.”
'But that someone has to matter. Who can really hear you over the silencing wards? '
He stands, then fidgets in place for a second before turning to Draco, also standing and staring at him. "When is our train due?"
“I haven’t the faintest," he snaps in absolute honesty. "Just tell me something different,”
Draco frowns. "The nerve soothers? Could they have worked as a catalyst?"
Harry is alive. Harry is alive. Harry is alive.
Because the fact is, this isn’t enough to deter him from following.
Draco does turn around, he looks at the closed stores, the phantom ridden streets, and the annoying lights Harry called 'Neon'. They are headache-inducing.
claims that you were also present, the day of the alleged 'attack'. I looked up your hours, and it seems that you were on leave that day,"
We decided to switch to weekly updates since there is only one chapter and an epilogue left of this instalment. We’re working on the sequel :)
It takes him a while to realize that the reason why his hearing is impaired, is because they have been clogged by his blood. His Lord stands over him, unimpressed by Evan's hoarse screaming and useless thrashing, as if he was expecting better, then flicks his wand and Evan's ears clear with a painful pop.
"It looks abandoned now."
He turns towards Harry, but something’s wrong. Harry shoulders past him without a sound.
He hadn't lasted long under the Dark Lord's wand. Not even a full ten minutes. Evan somewhat envies him for it. For how easily he got away. His bleeding fingers are laced with agony at the slightest bit of twitch, even as the air brushes against the tender flesh where his nails were supposed to be.
This all happened in one night. He made Harry dinner. He almost kissed Harry at dinner. Harry was taken. Draco found him because he always will. They kissed. They kissed and Harry likes him back.
Harry remembers that night. He remembers how he’d slipped off his stool whilst making dinner,  hitting his head to the sharp corner of the counter, he remembers Petunia's livid face as she’d dragged him by the arm, out of the kitchen, through the hallway, past his cupboard, to the door.
"Stop,"  Potter is blindly grappling for some sort of support to lean his weight upon, and Severus has no time to sneer at his foolishness. He was just getting the living daylight tortured out of him, and here he is trying to stand?
They only have three more vials left.
"Fuck," he mutters, his eyes stitched to the shoe.
It's not the dementor that does it for him, he realizes this with a faint sense of horror, it's this guy, whoever he is, basically kidnapping him.
"Or he could be like… dead--" cold dread seeps into her stomach. She’s been wondering that too. She needs to focus, she can’t think about Harry, and where he is, and how he is right now. But no one lets her speak.
"Minister Fudge," he nods at the man behind his gigantic desk, "You wanted to see me?"
“Did you know that the moon is moving away from the Earth at the rate of four centimeters per year?” Draco blinks. Then thinks it over.
"That's it," the man cooes, letting up the curse for a respite, "You should be honored, Harry."
“Okay.” Determination and panic are both equally prominent on his face as Harry grips at Draco’s arms to keep him upright, “Okay, what do we do, then?”
"How is your shoulder?" He asks.
"And you're the person I suggested,” Remus confirms. “It would be good for you, getting out of this funk, changing out of that ridiculous night robe--"
'Harry!'
Running away, if at all possible by an astronomical streak of luck, could be considered an option if she, along with his godfather, nearly half of the people he knows for sure and their parents weren't Death Eaters.
Umbridge looks awfully irritated by his response, and his smile turns a little more genuine, a lot more smug, though he tries to tone it down. "Yes, well, of course. Children shouldn't be occupied by such matters." She clears her throat, picks up her quill. "You're correct. It seems that the detentions are finally having an effect."
"Yeah,” Harry says, the smile back on his face. Knowing and sweet and just… Harry. “And I love having you around."
Draco is still watching. As if he cannot look away. He’s not morbidly fascinated by Harry, Harry knows that look. He’s just mortified. Harry really really wishes he would look away.
Sirius looks away and flops his head back down on the armrest, "I also skinny-dipped in frothy chocolate foam that same year."
Harry frowns. "Why not?"
“Yes, I got that much.”
"He's a blind fool," Minerva growls, referring to Fudge. "He's disregarding the signs. Of course, this attack was planned, and of course, it was meant as a warning. It couldn't have been clearer if they were dancing right in front of him in death eater robes,"
It takes Draco a moment through his haze of panic and confusion to realise he’s pointing his wand at Harry; and horrified, he almost drops the wand from his slack hands, and lowers it with lightning speed.
The whirl of the spell is as disorienting as ever, and he takes a moment to gather himself.
John tries to keep his expression the same as it was before. "Vague reports thus far indicate a Death Eater attack in the muggle community occurring yesterday afternoon, taking the lives of ten muggles, three of which were relatives of the Boy-who-Lived, or they are claimed to be as such, do you confirm this statement?"
But he doesn't know if he's alone. If Petunia hears, if she does, then she might not let him back inside, and Harry will be left, in the hall of mirrors, with nothing but himself.
"Harry, take a soother," this feels like talking to a wall. Useless and pointless. Harry’s hands are shaking badly and it's painful to look at.
"This place is the headquarters of the Order of Phoenix." Sirius starts. "It also happens to be my ancestral home, you've already had the displeasure of meeting my mother," Sirius pauses for Harry to exclaim or show any sort of outward emotion, but he passively stares back at his godfather and Sirius cringes.
his face, along with the portion of skin she's touching. It feels wrong.
Draco pushes open the bathroom door, illuminates it with a wave of his wand, and steps in, which results in him almost slipping and cracking his head open on the wet floor.
As a child, he was simply too naive to see, to really look, when he acquired the gift of seeing at the age of thirteen, he was too jealous, too spiteful of Potter to use it on him. Now he and Harry share something incredibly intimate. They share pain, and Draco allows his eyes to roam every inch of Harry's skin as if it cures it of all suffering.
to feel happy when Mrs. Malfoy was dead. Happy at Malfoy senior's misery and Draco's struggles.
The hallway is carpeted with a truly atrocious brown rug, and the walls are a hideous beige colour. There’s a lonely little table with a vase full of wilted flowers at one end. Draco can see, quite clearly, the way his parents would have turned their nose up at such an establishment. Only fit for the lowest of scums. For dregs and thieves and people who can’t afford even basic luxuries.
"Do you…" Draco sets his jaw against the pain, "Really want to talk blame right now?"
"So…"
Draco gapes, “You-- what?”
"Remus?" Harry asks and the man is still staring at the curtains with narrowed eyes.
"My ear isn't food, Hedwig," he distractedly runs his hand over her head and she hoots again, almost as if she's thinking of jumping into the fridge.
Harry snuggles back into Draco as gently as he can, mindful of both their injuries. He stares up at the plain ceiling so he doesn’t have to look at Sirius, the light fixtures casting a dull glare over everything.
“What do- What?
A voice behind him hisses in alarm. "I'm here!" the voice furiously whispers, but Rosier doesn't turn. "No need to wake the whole bloody street!"
He can't leave Harry's blood just lying around. That's so much worse than a shoe. He stops when he’s sure there’s nothing salvageable left of the shoe, and the only blood he can see is horribly contaminated or indistinguishable from Rosier's. He tightens his grip around Harry.
The walls of his room close in, trapping him inside like a bird in a heated cage. He heaves in another thrashing breath. He'd never been claustrophobic, he couldn't afford to be claustrophobic, not when he had been forced to live in a cupboard for the better part of his life. That was the first rule of survival in his books, adapt fast, or you're dead.
"I don't have anything against boiled carrots."
“Father,” the crack in Draco’s voice stops Severus from telling them to hurry up.
"If you cannot handle two teenage boys, then what must be said about the cause you serve to our Lord?"
"But aren't you a bit worried?” Padma asks, “He could be dead right now."
Friendly chat. Harry would rather throw himself off his rooftop than imagine having a friendly chat with this woman of all people. But he is in no position to object to what is clearly an order. Hesitantly, he puts his quill down, trying his best to ignore the throbbing in his hand. He cannot wait until he can plunge it down the Murtlap Essence when he's done here.
The door had been wrenched open with a harsh click and he was tossed outside.
Harry pulls out the dittany vial, which is slightly bigger than the others, and another pain reliever. His hand, then pauses inside the bag and Draco narrows his eyes.
Quite pathetic, in comparison to what he could and should have given Harry.
Which is very funny, Draco thinks. A corner of his mind is vaguely alarmed at his thoughts. It
"He laughed at my name!” He throws his hands up in exasperation, “Why are we even arguing about this?"
Harry throws Draco a small smile over his shoulder, it's dimmed but reassuring, Draco hates himself for feeling its warmth.
His lord sneers down at him. "You are a fool, Evan," Nagini finally moves down with a hiss aimed at her master, down Evan's bleeding chest and nestles on his hips. "Just like a mindless child, I cannot leave you to your own devices."
"Potter--" he says, holding his hand as far away from his face as possible.
"Headmistress-"
"I see you've been making adequate use of my clothes," he drawls.
Harry hums, "I keep learning all these funny things about you. You're french. Oh my god, this explains stuff." then he fails to elaborate what those “stuff” really consisted of.
Well, the curse didn't hit Harry Potter. It got to his godson.
Next update on 17th October, Saturday.
"I'm just saying that we're good company if he cannot sleep." Bill points out, shrugging in a way that jostles his ponytail. "That's why he was sneaking around in the first place, right?"
Draco still isn't used to the speeding cars when they find a bus station. It has chairs, a roof, and there's a yellow sign with grass sprouting here and there.
“Ohh, Harry, I just love it when you scream,” Bella says as she finally lowers her wand, only for a bit. “Like that halfblood snack Ruddie and I shared two weeks ago. She screamed so loudly, and she did it with style, do you know what I mean?”
"I didn't hate them,"
"So…" Hermione takes Remus's seat the moment the man stands up to conjure another one for Ron.
Harry looks all bloody but Draco can’t find any new injuries on him. Draco’s on the cold, muddy ground, face buried in his uninjured arm as he tries to breathe through the pain.
"He means only people with high pain tolerance can keep their mouths shut," Draco interjects. In a way, he’s almost glad Moody was the only outside party who knew about their location. Almost.
It needs to be looked at, probably with the same urgency regarded for his constant trembling and Draco's shoulder. And his cut-up face.
Harry just grins in response.
Draco immediately shakes his head, "I think you were just lonely. And I think that's lovely, not you being lonely, but...having such a strong mind."
The area where Draco
"I'm really sorry," he groans, "I really am but I've told you this before, even I don't know where Harry is. Not Sirius, nor any other Order member but Albus. You cannot send letters. I know this sucks, it does for us too,"
Remus' lips tighten, and his eyes turn sad, but he answers, "Your mother." He doesn't elaborate. And Harry is grateful for that. It's enough. He lowers his wand again, looking around. Even Tonks has gone quiet and is looking grim.
He moves over to Harry, crouching near his feet. He presses the holly wand into Harry's near limp hands and ignores the still sluggishly bleeding gash on his leg as he starts tugging the boots on Harry’s socked feet.
He doesn't even notice or acknowledge Draco putting the coat on him, and quickly changing his own shirt.
Harry slightly shakes his head, and his eyes focus on Malfoy, seeing the other boy's startled and confused eyes gazing back at him. Harry swiftly turns around, picking his Transfiguration book to stuff it in his school bag.
From the corner of his eye, Draco can still see Harry wielding the peeler as he glares at Severus, the man turns to glance at Potter as he feels the boy's unsettling gaze on him, and silently waits for Potter to unfold.
“What the fuck,” Draco says as soon as he can.
Harry is kind of counting on such a fate if he happens to befall to Voldemort's wand. Or Bellatrix's torture. Whichever comes first, a tiny part of Harry is ready for it.
‘Oh, the nerve of this guy,’ Harry wholeheartedly agrees with Sirius, his horrified face no doubt reflecting Sirius's.
"Remus?"
Harry doesn’t protest as he is led to a kitchen, passing a hallway with peeling wallpaper. Everything inside is dark, despite the lights. As he plops down on the table, a large block of chocolate is thrust into his face by Sirius, “Eat, you look way too pale for me to be comfortable.”
"You sure you're okay?” The woman butts in, “I can call--"
"Don't get ahead of yourself," Rosier spits out and reaches for Harry's waistband.
Harry is giving cooking another chance, and so far, it is going smoothly. Well, as smoothly as possible under the circumstances.
Hedwig's hoot is what brings Harry out of his momentary stupor.
"No." Harry says aloud, and Umbridge flicks an eyebrow.
He counts again as each sentence is scratched out, and somehow even his pain muddled brain is chastising him for expecting different results. It's always going to be five words, sixteen letters, six vowels, and ten consonants. It's not going to change, no matter how hard Harry wishes it to lessen.
A murder with an invisible murderer.
Harry looks up at Draco, who’s staring at him. "Do what?"
Then Harry sighs, and Draco can literally feel him shrinking with his eyes closed. He didn't mean that, he didn't mean it like that.
Sirius grins, "I knew they wouldn't sit still for long. Good for them, what's the favour?"
He pauses purposefully. Letting her simmer.
He occasionally encounters people, he only knows a few and studiously ignores them, but other than that no one really pays the too thin boy with overly large clothes and dark circles under his eyes any mind.
Lucius takes another step forward and reaches out; this time, slowly. Draco is tensed as Lucius drapes what Severus recognises as his school robes around his shivering shoulders. Draco is starting to sway when Lucius puts a firm hand on his shoulder.
Remus had fidgeted under Harry's blank gaze, his worn brown sleeping robes shifting as the man grabbed Harry's shoulder. 'He wanted to hand you a gift, a stupid old toy of ours. He found it in his old trunk, he got too excited to think about the repercussions…it doesn't matter.'
Harry knows that he knew he would die, but the harsh confirmation is such a shock.
The rain pattering on the windowpane is a mocking lullaby, soothing but with him unable to take any joy in it.
"Oh,” Harry flushes red, “Actually, that was... something. There was no second base. I don't know what was wrong with me. Sweetie?"
Draco watches him doing that a lot. Just staring into space, almost as if he's not aware of his surroundings anymore. There are no books to occupy him, no conversation, although Harry does start humming some times, without even seeming to notice he is.
He walks, and just… keeps walking. With no particular destination in mind. It's quiet, and no neighbors, despite whatever Aunt Petunia might think, are peeking out their windows to stare at the 'unstable boy that the Dursleys were so gracious to take in'. Harry thinks that they're too busy living their lives to bother themselves with Aunt Petunia's words.
It sounds downright awful. Harry would most assuredly smack him for it. Either with his hands or his mug.
"Well,” she stares at him, “It is a dreary night to stay out, yes."
Draco snorts, shoulders loosening at Harry’s apparent ease, and Severus half-heartedly glares at him. His face takes on a long suffering expression that often accompanies the man when Longbottom is near.
It’s both a heartbeat and a lifetime later that Harry pulls away.
is. If we wait on it, if we hesitate for a single moment, then we might as well not fight at all."
With a desolate look around their dreary cell walls, Harry wonders whether Twinky will answer to him instead of his masters.
"Please,” Harry interrupts, and he looks like he wants to touch Draco, but his hands stay firmly crammed into his pockets. “We
In the middle of the commotion, Harry hears Arthur Weasley over the shrieking woman. "No, still no word from the ministry," he says. Behind him, Remus pushes them both through the hallway, even though Harry's unconsciously digging his feet into the floorboards. "None of the dementors have been reported missing,"
And then everything

Of course, nothing of the sort happens.

Harry vaguely notices that Myrtle has disappeared again.
to recapture them. You
"Harry stop." All these nicknames are giving him whiplash, by constantly reminding him of the conversation they had prior to this moment in the train station. He’s not quite sure Harry still remembers that conversation, or all the awful things Draco used to call him.
He never seems to do anything, does he? No matter how hard he tries, the people he ends up caring about suffer the most horrific fates.
He scrambles for his wand, trying to take it out, he doesn't have time to lose. Harry barely notices that he's not wearing his glasses anymore. He leaves cursing his shitty eyesight to some other time and gets on all four, with one hand, he desperately pats the ground, clawing at the rough asphalt as he searches for them, his glasses, while he fumbles for his wand with the other. His fingers refuse to cooperate, to close around the wand, to do anything. His mind is still trying to catch up with everything that's happening. Something crunches under his knees, and he grimaces.
Draco wraps Harry’s arm around his own shoulders, gritting his teeth at the intense ache. He can do this for Harry, of course, he can. He stands up, pulling Harry’s light body with him. The scrawny boy clings to him for life, and Draco squeezes the arm around Harry's waist.
"Yeah, also… I love it when you swear," Ron says, actually
use any magic, do not let him get out of your sight, and do not be caught.” Her hand tightens around his injured shoulder, and she leans forward, her face inches from his, her voice lowering, “I won't save you again. Do you understand? Take him, take him now and leave."
Except that it didn't. Snatching Potter would have been the perfect atonement for his failure. His Lord had been trying to get the boy since that summer, he had stopped after the Dementor attack, and ordered Evan to kill the boy's relatives.
"Well, Mr. Malfoy, I have to say I am very disappointed," she starts, tapping her wand against her chin slowly, as if thinking very hard. Draco doesn't answer, just looks at her with a blank, bored gaze.
"I should hope so," Fudge says with a pointless chuckle as he twirls his own quill in one hand, his small beady eyes size John as if he's a dress robe, put behind a glass for sale. John Wallwind steadily holds Fudge's gaze, for nearly half a minute before he starts.
Sirius sighs, and finally sits up. He looks at Remus, that's beseeching and resigned at once, and heaves another dramatic sigh, "Remus? Take a look at me, buddy,” He gestures vaguely at himself, lifting his shoulders, and raising his eyebrows, “Do I look qualified enough to teach children so they could teach other children?"
"Okay." He puts the muffin inside the bag, and then turns to the garbage can again, Draco feels as if he might vomit any second. "You can look away," Harry warns, carefully folds the sleeve of his sweater back, and puts his shaking hand back in again.
Severus waits, stoic still even as his mind screams at him to hurry, body pulled taut, even though he keeps his stance deceptively casual. Lucius breaks the silence, stands up, moving towards Severus.
Severus gets the impression that he is being laughed at, by the picture.
"It's about the robe," she says.
After waiting day after day for them to include
"Wait, what was that?"
Stumbling on the low coffee table and the armchair in his way as Harry rapidly strides to the bathroom.
Dolohov is crouched in a crook in the wall, only narrow enough to fit one person, slander them in the shadows.
"Neither do you." he turns to Umbridge, "We're taking them."
"I hope so.” He turns his voice mocking, which is hard when your throat still feels like you’ve swallowed glass, “I hope she's not going around miscarrying one spawn after another. Don't you?"
(See the end of the chapter for
What could the man possibly want from them?
Draco’s first instinct is to snap at her, ‘How do you think I’m doing?’ but he holds his tongue, turning her words over in his head. He would have thought Father asked her to inquire, but if that was so, she’d have asked earlier. And phrased it differently.
He clutches the wand tighter, afraid that it’d disappear if he doesn’t. His mother had had this wand for as long as he could remember. It’s like having a part of her with him. He runs a finger over the smooth ebony wand, and his fingers almost seem to tingle.
“Perfect,” he whispers, and it is. Out of every kiss he’s ever had with anyone, Harry’s kiss is something they never could have compared with. He’d never thought kisses could feel so good. The circumstances around all dictate that this should be his worst possible kiss ever. But it isn’t. He couldn’t have asked for a better kiss.
"You just called me darling," he pouts.
Because they have to.
He looks at his hands, and in the dim, grey light sees that they shine black.
"Valentina?" he says, his voice choked and terrified. He doesn’t have it in himself to mask any sort of emotion right now, and he’s sure his face is a perfect mask of textbook terror.
Has he passed out again? Potter looks dangerously pale, and his hand seems almost bloodier than usual. Merlin, how can one lose this much blood and still be alive.
again. The hand drags him harder, throwing hasty glances over his broad shoulders. Harry tries to yank his arm away again.
Harry turns, against every nerve in his body that screamed at him to stay, and mechanically makes his way to the spiral stairs that lead down the tower.
"To Dave," he says after a beat of silence. They may as well.
“Well to be fair, we’re not exactly in top-notch condition. I’ll give you a pass for cooking for now.”
"It’s just...we're not going back, ever." Draco nods weakly in agreement. He's too deflated, too worn out. His face is sticky with dried tears, and his throat is raw, "and I didn't pack us--"
"Alright,” Ron throws up his hands, and this time even Hermione is starting to look skeptical, “He's gone insane."
He's never seen the old man look so weak and frail, he’d never seen him beg before this either. Albus Dumbledore had always seemed like this all-powerful, untouchable, unpassable, all-knowing figure. Being in his confidence had done nothing to assuage that image.
"You're not damaged," Harry responds immediately.
Draco can feel Potter staring at him. It's unnerving. Impossible to ignore. As if he’s trying to see right through him and digging out his deepest, darkest secrets. And there are plenty.
Evan's face stretches to a smirk once more, directed at the floor. "Your mercy is the reason I live,"
could probably sever her hand from her body, Harry muses.
"Kingsley Shacklebolt." he drawls, almost as if he's talking to himself. "He wasn't in The Order before. So, they're recruiting,"
"What?" Potter blinks.
"You've already consumed a large sum of my time Mr. Potter," Umbridge claps her hands once in resolution. "Detention tomorrow at two? I hope you wouldn't be late,"
“And you will never get to call yourself ‘Valentina Parkinson’. The Dark Lord’s feared knight… isn’t that the most tragic accomplishment of your life?”
Rosier purses his lips, "This is
He points at Williams, their newest recruit who's staring around him with doe-like eyes, looking more intimidated than one might in a battlefield. "I want the Davidson files sent to me by lunchtime, Williams, see it done."
"It's okay," Harry mutters, "Just a nightmare."
"Yeah. Yeah okay."
It's quite hard for him to comprehend, it's as if his body is trying to contain an inner earthquake that would cause havoc if unleashed. Harry wishes it to unleash, if only the tremors would cease.
"I'm doing this,” Harry shudders violently, “I am doing this. Stop annoying me. One hundred and seventeen. One hundred and sixteen, one hundred and fifteen--" he freezes.
"Draco," Harry mutters once the bus cringes to a stop.
"We're not taking that risk," Remus drops Harry's trunk on the bed and starts throwing Tonks's folded piles haphazardly into Harry's already messy trunk.
He toes the edge of his left shoe with his right, and distracts Rosier with his hands, scratching the hands holding him, hard enough to hopefully draw blood. And he does, but Rosier doesn't even flinch.
“Harry,” Draco says, breaking off a bite sized piece from the sandwich, “Eat.” When he is halfway through the sandwich, Harry makes a gesture with his hands, insisting he can feed himself. Draco is skeptical, but still places the other half in his shaky hands before moving onto his own.
He lets out a slow breath. Harry’s alive. Not gone or taken or dead. In the far end of the barn doing-- What is he doing?
They reach the store more rapidly than Draco wants them to, and he is still so confused. "What does that have to do with water?" He asks and Harry nods his chin at the bracket of water bottles near a fruit basket.
You are dead to me.
Harry forces him another half a vial of pain reliever, but Draco doesn't drink more. They should be careful with their supply.
"You can't touch them,” Val says, not sounding worried in the least. And Evan once again imagines her choking beneath his hands. It's his happy place right now. “Locked up in here, so stop ranting."
"And people do the most ridiculous things when they're afraid." Albus sets his cup down heavily, "Public denial is what's fanning Cornelius's flames. He would say anything to gain public approval. Not to mention, the Ministry is in no place to take part in a war. Not financially nor magically abled. Fudge is aware of that."
"Do you know that saying, Potter? The one that goes 'Curiosity kills the kneazle'?"
He’s never thanked a house-elf in his life. The fatigue is to be blamed.
"This is outrageous!" a clenched fist comes down upon the staff table, rattling cups and clinking the silverware. Severus Snape calmly regards the snarling woman, as Albus does the same.
She says ‘mission’ as if it’s a good thing, something to be proud of, and perhaps, once, Draco would have thought that too, would have probably taken that as an honour. Not anymore, not really. Somewhere, in the corner of his mind that’s not too numb, he pities her a little. He is waiting, almost. For her reckoning.
Severus jerks his head towards the stairs, gesturing for Harry to leave, but lingers back for a second and turns to him, “Draco.”
"Minister Fudge has his reasons,"
Narcissa Malfoy, Severus thinks, was one of the fiercest, most graceful women he had ever known, even coming as far as showing up Lily Potter, his former best friend. All that beauty and grace and she had been reduced to
The other wand is even more familiar than Harry’s. With a hand trembling almost as violently as Harry’s, his fingers close around the ornate handle. It fits perfectly in his hands. Just like it used to in his mother’s.
Next update on 11th December, Friday.
Any thoughts about Granger and Weasley vanish in the wake of the new revelation, "We're... we're friends?" he says dumbly.
"Harry is fine,” Remus says firmly, but he knows that he's trying to convince himself as much as Sirius. They’ve not received any correspondence. The only information they have has been via Snape and Moody. “Sirius we've talked about this, both Albus and Snape--"
The door doesn't budge. He releases the knob with one last half-hearted tug.
"Same, John," Fudge vigorously returns the handshake. "The sentiment is fully returned."
The homework is already too much, and Harry has nearly spent three hours a day in Umbridge's office, which is an overwhelming disadvantage compared to the other students. Harry's pretty sure he's the only one who has had detentions with Umbridge.
Or maybe his mind is just that twisted enough to think of the spells, ones so fundamentally gut-wrenching that bile starts rising up in his throat again, he prays for that not to be the case, wishes that maybe he has read them somewhere and promptly forgotten about them because of how horrible they were.
"He's being dramatic," Hermione says, rolling her eyes irritably.
The place wouldn't be abandoned otherwise.
Thank you all for the positive feedback, and happy reading.
He doesn't, instead, he takes them both to the rowed seats in front of the huge machines and they settle.
Harry has no idea why he just blurted out such a thing. It is true, what he said, he's tried it out himself quite a few times, mostly when he cannot sleep. But that still doesn't tell Harry why Draco Malfoy is privy to that information now.
Time passes. He keeps writing. Umbridge has gone back to some paperwork by now, so at least she isn’t staring at him. There is the steady scratch of his quill on the bloodied parchment, and the turning of Umbridge’s papers, along with the clock on her desk which is ticking at a steady rhythm. A few cats purr on the wall.
"I know," he whispers to himself.
He feels it in his blood, the happiness, the morbid amusement at the pathetic vermins surrounding him, at the ones lying on the floor, one dead and one wishing he were.
'This is a dangerous game, Harry.' Sirius is walking beside him, his strides matching his perfectly.
Draco hates his life.
He passes his cupboard without a glance, and obediently heads right into the kitchen, dodging Dudley's tripping hazard and Uncle Vernon's morning glare as they all wait for Harry to start preparing breakfast. Aunt Petunia is already cracking the eggs, and she wrinkles her nose at him when she sees him.
Harry imitates the act with an invisible brush, dramatically dunking it into an also invisible bucket as his eyes shine with amusement. “And I dunked it into the paint bucket and started painting the windows," he laughs again, "Seriously? I just told you that the moon is moving away by itself and this is what you're intrigued about?
"Not great. My relatives are dead. Fine is more socially acceptable." Well, at least Potter knows what’s socially acceptable.
"It feels like we've never been apart. It's like I've known you all my life." He stuffs another bit of ice cream in his mouth. And Draco stares. Harry’s halfway through his, but Draco has barely eaten two spoonfuls. He’s suddenly reminded of that day in Shell Cottage, sitting on the porch after a fight. Eating Harry’s mango ice cream.
“Hush,” Severus snaps at them again and firmly ushers Draco-and by extension Potter- down the dimly lit hall, decorated with ornate, antique vases, one of them Severus fondly remembers as Narcissa’s favorite, and a few scattered portraits, that are all empty now. Lucius has taken care of everything, it seems.
The wind blows and clouds rumble overhead.
Her cruciatus wasn't as strong as Aunt Bella. It wasn't, he knows it. His limbs aren't shaking as violently as they had the last time, and he can
"Better two than none."
“Help me get him to the couch, NOW!”
"For stunning two underage boys?" he rolls his eyes. "As if. Scram before you anger me, Umbridge. I'll send Dolohov along later,"
They find the bus station a while later. It is surprisingly modern compared to the rest of the picturesque town. It has a snack booth and everything.
“Twinky, please,” he tries again, this is his only hope. He has nothing to treat Draco with, and it could be hours before anyone comes down for another round. Harry knows that logically, this should work. He has called on Dobby many times before- although as a free elf- but every bone in his body is telling him that this has to work. Including the forest. The forest
There’s a small curl of displeasure on Harry’s mouth. “And if I have to tell you this one more time, I swear to Merlin, Ron I'm gonna drop a spider in your underpants."
"You were there. When she killed… Draco's mom. You were there, and you did nothing."
"Vernon and I are taking Dudders to Marge's tomorrow. She has hay fever, and she needs us around."
Harry hesitates only for a moment before trudging over to the bedside.
Potter not-so-discreetly buries his bleeding hand under the other one, scowl deepening, “None of your business, Malfoy.”
As Harry turns to raise his eyebrows at Bill, the older boy winks at him. "It's true," he says and points at his dragon fang earring. "She's not exactly a fan of my fashion sense."
to be reversible.
It sickens him. The mere idea sickens him and Harry wants to cry. He doesn't, he keeps cleaning the wound and pointedly starts thinking about something else.
Finally, Molly Weasley takes pity on him after she's finished attending to everyone's needs. She comes up behind his chair, her warm hands settling on his shoulder, and slowly leans to whisper in his ear.
"What?” Draco says, shaking his head. They have to get to Slughorn as soon as possible. He can’t let Harry suffer any longer. They’re so close. “No. The rain is gonna stop soon we can make it--"
"You said no one knows about this place," Harry says, a deep frown etched on his face.
"Because you did, didn't you? You killed the Diggory boy because he fell for your act the same way everyone did. Then you hid behind his ass like a squealing pig, and waited for him to take the brunt of it." He, of course, knows it isn't true. But at the moment, all Draco cares about is hurting Potter. And that comment seems to hit the mark.
Severus grits his teeth, and contains the urge to growl. Potter has been tortured, for two straight days, Severus is not going to snap at him right after. "We really don't have time for this, Potter." he says instead. "Just for once in your life, listen to me without asking incessant questions. I will answer each and every one of them once we're out of here, we have a very limited time slot and if you keep--"
"Fish do blink," is what Draco hears Harry mutter, before he completely straightens up.
This is the man who’d defeated Grindelwald in a duel, Severus reminds himself, watching as Albus shivers and groans. He sets the man down on a couch, where he slumps nervelessly.
"You prat."
Stay safe everyone!
But he manages to keep most of his whimpers to himself. He still doesn’t feel like his pain means much compared to what Harry went through, must still be feeling.
"Ron, I know you don't like action, like my dear furry friend, Remus. But you either want to live, or turn into a pink goop."
She shakes her head. Impatient. "Why Dumbledore was assisting him."
“You didn’t cuss,” Severus quirks a brow.
No, no, no.
“I'll be back."
"He squealed like a little pig, before I'd even started with him," she crouched by Rosier, grabs the man's clenched jaw, "He pissed himself by the time I was done. Disappointing, isn't it?"
"He's holding me. I don't feel like everything is going to shit when he does that. He found me." And it wasn’t the first time either. He’d found him before too, bought him back from death, in that bathroom, all those weeks ago. Merlin, it feels like a lifetime. Draco’s always saving him.
They were bound to explode soon if there wasn't an outlet.
But before Harry can open his mouth once more, clanking sounds interrupt them, and the sharp clicks of high heels against the damp stones echo around their cell. Harry drops his eyes and gulps. Draco curses under his breath and scoots closer to Harry as Bellatrix finally comes into view.
' You're falling apart,' Sirius folds his arms across his chest.
"I don't know." Harry suddenly looks worried, biting his lips as he mumbles, staring at his grotesque hand.
measures of retaliation. The other boy is getting too cocky. "You're still dripping blood everywhere, Potter." He points out, snark dripping off every word.
He does, he pats his robe to indicate as such.
"Your
Draco just hums in response. Harry will take care of him, he always has. It’s selfish, but Draco’s in too much pain to care.
Harry laughs around the spoon in his mouth. "We don't need to,” he wheezes, “We just push them through the mail box slot in the street. It gets back to them from there."
The door screeches loudly as they push it open, and Draco’s mouth tightens in a grimace. He half expects the door to fall off on them, and wouldn’t that be great.
And Draco had just watched.
'Thanks, imaginary Sirius, ' Harry drawls in his head with a roll of his eye and then straightens his back, rolling his shoulders with a wince. When Hedwig gets back, he's writing to his Godfather for real. Chatting with the man in his head is starting to feel a little bit like cheating, and it's making Harry feel weird.
"What, Malfoy? Did I strike a nerve?"
Harry is already shaking his head, "I need a moment," he shrugs his hand out of Draco's hold, "Please don't follow me. I'll be in the bathroom. I'll be back soon, okay?"
"You joined the forces," Harry gasps mockingly, scrunching up the empty bag of chips in his hands. A faint cramp runs through his palms.
Falling backward, he settles to just pulling his wand out, finally. His grip is pitifully weak on it, he isn't even holding it properly. But he has to do
“Draco, Draco, oh my god,” Harry says, almost hovering if not for the fact that his hands are shaking violently, that he too is flopped on the ground. “Draco, you’re bleeding, your shoulder. God, Draco, what do I do? Tell me what to do!”
He hates upsetting Harry, and he hates doing this wrong. He just keeps screwing things up. Harry hasn't been dating him for a full day yet and he might break up with him now on the spot.
The imaginary Sirius keeps on goading him, and Harry carries on with the light-hearted - albeit deeply sad and disturbed- dialogue in his head. In the end, when he's down to two remaining weeds, Ron and Hermione are included in the game as well, Ron on his own Nimbus and Hermione tucked under a tree with a gigantic book, because why not? That'll make her happy. Happier than she is in this life, probably.
"You shouldn't have to know!" Moody firmly taps his finger to his temple. "It's all about constant -"
He finds it almost instantly.
"Stop worrying about that."
"Whatever." Potter throws his hands up in exasperation, not understanding the severity of it, "That's not even the point! I know when it happened. It happened three nights ago, at midnight, didn't it?"
"Harry, we deserve this,” he forces himself to look back at Harry’s eyes. “No, don't look at me like that. We do, we deserve this."
Harry's eyes scan the rest of the people. There's another 'familiar' face. He opens his mouth, but Mad-Eye Moody beats him to it.
"Barely, Snape, barely."
"That's outrageous!"
Chapter warnings for; graphic imagery and disturbing themes, explicit language, panic attacks, drowning, graphic implied/referenced torture, descriptions of illness and injury, vomiting.
"Yeah, that tends to happen when you cut a whole sentence into your hand for four hours straight."
"No," Harry closes the tap with a firm shake of his head. "Heard nothing, saw nothing, the kitchen was empty when I came in," against his better judgment, he takes another long swig of his glass. "I was just leaving,"
“It won’t really make a difference, the shirt was too big anyway.” The strips in his hands are uneven, and Harry grimaces. But Draco is impressed, he hadn’t thought he would be able to do much at all with his hands.
Thanks a bunch to our Beta! We hope you guys enjoy this chapter!
"Why can't she come here?"
To his great surprise, all the seagulls are still there when Harry has stood up. He can’t recognise a single one of them anymore, but there are still all six of them.
"Hey, aren't they joining us?" Harry asks, craning his neck to glance at them over his shoulder whilst trying to match Remus's brisk pace. Lupin doesn't stop but extends a hand to Hedwig's cage in a silent offer to take it from Harry.
It is true. Valentina wasn't the sort of bitch, the dark lord just kept hanging off his arm. She is as much a snake as Nagini is to him. Precise and vicious. Evan is more than sure that the whore has at least some poison on her person right now.
"Be still, and pray tell, what is this?"
"Then why don't you tell
And then Harry starts looking uncertain too, "Aren't we friends?” he says, hesitant, “I thought that--"
Unlike Aunt Petunia, he doesn’t imagine her without a mouth, rather, he imagines her without her whole face, just a void where it should be starting from the top of her head, and ending just above her thick, meaty neck. Without those beady little eyes, tracking his every movement, or those lips that simper so disgustingly.
He lifts up his chin, making his voice as bland as possible, "How much more do I have to pay?"
That's what he's been taught all his life.
"How about honey?"
He realises, belatedly, that Harry’s not looking at him. Not in a way that shows he’s away in his head-- He’s… literally not seeing anything.
Severus grasps Potter’s elbow and helps him off the ground, quickly casting a knee reversing hex at Rosier, who stumbles and falls to the ground in a heap, his legs bent at a disturbing angle. His yell is loud as he casts the Killing Curse towards them, but in his rage, his aim is off.
Even though he's not aware of the cause yet, he cannot let it overwhelm him, the first rule of survival is adapting, and Harry adapts, whether the restlessness likes it or not.
The following is our reply to a lovely reader, who unfortunately deleted their comment before we could respond. In case they are still reading this story, here is our response. The rest of you guys...feel free to read for a bit of meta from the writers, otherwise, feel free to skip it ;)
Draco has practised his best pompous expression before in his head. "Two sundaes, if you would please."
Ron does so and they both throw Remus a wary glance. "Hello, kids."
"It won't do much," he feels stupid telling this to a man who taught this to him in the first place. "Fenrir Greyback did that to me."
"We're still here?"
He's only done it like five times.
Gryffindors.
He'll decide on names later.
to think about what happened before.
"I'm giving it a shot," he looks over the parchment Hermione draws out of the binder,  "and maybe we can even bunch Sirius in this little project, ever since... Harry's incident happened, he's been a bit antsy."
He knows nothing. Severus thinks he does, but he doesn't. Harry means nothing to Draco, and that smile isn't worth what his godfather thinks. Severus sighs and follows Potter upstairs.
"Traitors are to be punished with no deliberation." the man cuts in. "Dumbledore is as good as gone. We're taking the boy." he sneers at Draco over his shoulder, "And you,"
The others look at him in silence and Kingsley nods again. "Right."
"It's burning," he says, his eyes flicking down to his forearm for less than a second. "Which means you screwed up," he takes a step closer. "Which further means that your pink bitch screwed up. Which means we're all screwed up too."
"Um yes," he nods, "Yes. I was just…"
Just on cue, a flock of paper planes lands haphazardly from the ceiling, overwhelming their wide-eyed mail receiver, who looks about ready to cry. Kingsley flicks his wand at the poor man's desk, arranging the planes. "Take your time," he tells LionClaw who stares back at him with saucer wide eyes and a slack mouth.
He hears it in the distance, not from a particular direction, but from every direction at once, and somehow Harry still knows he has to head to the left, just under the old giant roots of a beech tree, make his way through the tall stalks and there he would see it, a small trickle that runs from the edge of his vision to as far as his eyes can see.
Harry’s still asleep. Limp and pliant in Draco’s arms as he drags the boy away from the nail with one arm.
"I had high hopes for you," the foot is moving down to his windpipe and Evan chokes on his own blood, his feet writhing and his arms uselessly flapping. He can barely make sense of the words that are coming out of his Lord's mouth.
Had Harry screamed? Called for help? Called for his name?
"And you better not. Fool around, that is." She grabs her rag once again, turning away from him. "Vernon doesn't have the patience to deal with your insolence. You don't want the repeat of last summer, do you?"
Harry grits his teeth.
Harry sees the silver gleam of a knife that's stuck inside the flesh. Hysterically, he wishes he'd been the one to put it there.
"And we just asked for your advice because we need new defensive spells and Hermione is running out of books."
He reaches the lower levels, near the cellar door, and that’s when he starts hearing the screaming. It is only with pragmatic practice years in the making that he doesn’t let his steps falter.
"She's basically throwing us out," George agrees with a dramatically wounded expression, a hand over his chest, and Mrs. Weasley huffs.
"Drink first and drink half."
They're meeting at the Astronomy Tower today. Draco had insisted that they don't stick to the same place for too long. Any other time Harry would have called Malfoy paranoid. He would have refused, would have tried to seek a way out of the 'blackmail', however much he found comfort in it; but now, knowing what he did, he understood.
"Stop teasing him," Tonks finally says, as she sees Harry's shoulders tense, "It's four in the morning, let him be."
Draco doesn’t answer, but rather points his own wand at her. He doesn’t stand a snowball’s chance in hell against her. Not after he lost so pathetically to Umbridge in his very last duel. She could kill him with one wave of her wand, she could be creative and she could be quick, or slow and painful and--
"Thank you, Draco," Harry keeps his other hand, the one in the garbage away from him, but Draco reaches for it, and then lets Harry take them back to the dumpster.
Next update on 25th December, Friday.
"Calm. Yeah, calm is easy.” The boy turns his head away and chuckles, the laugh bubbling out of him resembling something that’d suit Black more than Potter, “I just witnessed two murders and a gore show, calm is easily manageable."
Draco shoots up in his seat, "How long was I asleep?!"
He can’t go back to Gryffindor Tower like this, so he takes to walking around aimlessly. He is hungry, his grumbling stomach acutely reminds him of his summers with Dursleys and Harry groans. The food would have been long gone from the Great Hall, he only hopes that Ron had saved him some sandwiches or rolls like last night.
"It's gross."
"Look into his cereal bowl!” he points towards the littered coffee table, “It's beer! Instead of milk. Remus was wrong about this--"
His aunt finally relents and he can hear her heels clipping down the stairs. Harry twists the knob and pulls, feeling an irrational rush of relief as the door opens. Of course, she has unlocked it for him. How else is he going to make breakfast for them?
The second thing is the smell of fresh blood and old decay.
"Leave it," Draco barely stops himself from calling him by his name.

Albus goes very still as his hands touch the locket, and then he bolts upright so quickly that Severus takes a step back.

"You said it yourself," Harry says defensively when Hermione glares at him. "It's all rubbish. Let's just not read that garbage,"
Harry's eyes flash.
want that. "They take money for goods. Do you want me to find you something else?"
"Oh no complaints now, Potter." She turns around and looks over the horizon, "You have been terribly naughty." She clicks her tongue, the picture of a disappointed parent. He'd take the Dursleys over her any day. There was never a day where they hadn't been disappointed in him. Or rather, disappointed that he was still there in their house and alive. Harry had never liked them, but they'd also never sent his skin crawling like she did. And now they are dead. Why couldn't
"Well, you're not supposed to… oh nevermind."
"Did you pack us any food?" Harry lowers them both down. He feels most of the tension leaving his body gradually. Sleep should come easy, whether Draco wants it or not. He's so tired, and he's still in pain.
Nott’s face sours, “What do you want?”
"As you say so, but perhaps confiding in someone-"
“It does? But the moon doesn’t look smaller,”
Sirius watches them blankly for a second, before registering what Ron had just said, "Not with that attitude, Ginger. If you guys want to be me, then you have to cut out your old selves and start soaking up the room energy. Do you feel it? The amazingness of this?"
is there with Potter.
"Alright."
Before he can experience a full-blown freakout, Harry shrugs his hand out of Draco's and reaches into his coat pocket, where the wallet is.
It's just been there as long as he can remember.
Hermione also looks just as shocked, “Harry, oh my god, are you alright? You aren’t hurt, are you?”
"Yes," Kingsley drapes one leg over the other in an exaggerated display of nonchalance. "I haven't been on leave in over two months,"
'You're playing chase, like with Marge's Dog. Except the dog in the situation is me. Quite ironic, isn't it?'
Umbridge rests her wand against Draco's cheek, and he lets out a strangled noise. The touch repels him, disgusts him, and he wants it
There's a large, crooked nail, stuck out of the wall. And Harry's…
His scar feels as if it's splitting open, and there's a cloud of
Harry screams and rolls on the floor, his limbs are tense even as they jerk against the curse. Fuck he hates this. He really does.
Shaking his head, he sets the now broken quill on the table over the stack of unchecked essays, glaring at them as if they were the cause of the Dark Lord's return.
Harry furiously grabs the water tap and thrusts the glass under the rush. He needs to leave, now. He wonders if they can see the colour rising in his cheeks.
His jovial steps come to an abrupt stop before the double doors and Evan rights himself, slipping his silver mask in place with a smirk as he gently taps the wood with his knuckles.

around the unventured cottage in search of said kitchen. Severus starts peeling off Draco’s robe, and then his shirt, wincing at the claw like marks across his torso but focusing on his shoulder. There’s so much blood that he can’t even make out the wound.
He wrinkles his nose at himself for the vulgar imagery, and then all he knows is pain, once again.
"The dementor attack-"
Lucius just gives him a rueful smile, which vanishes as soon as it had come. “Go.”
"As far as I know, Merlin knows the Aurors are always the ones in deep shit in these blunders."

Remus knows this. He knows this very clearly. He’d been worrying himself sick over Harry too, but this isn’t the way to go, this way they’d be doing something. They can’t just sit idle and waste away. "He wouldn't want you to do this to yourself."

"And saving lives,” she says firmly. This isn’t about breaking rules. Breaking rules is… it’s collateral. This is about Harry and saving lives. “I'm not afraid, Ron. We can do this, for Harry, and for ourselves. Besides... you're a badass boyfriend."
"Am I allowed to leave now, Aunt Petunia?"
"Don't know about that lad, but I have this."
The children enter the office, and Minerva adjusts her robe. "Close the door behind you."
Albus is still shivering. Severus sighs, letting the paper fall from his hand. “Albus, you need to drink some more water,” he says tiredly, conjuring up another glass.
Draco almost pauses when the thought rises. Where did
!” Severus watches in horror as Nott’s curse grazes Draco on the shoulder. There is a moment of stillness before Draco roars in pain, Lucius is thrown off balance, wildly glancing at his son over his shoulder whilst trying to take Nott down in the same instance. Draco crumples down as blood spreads across his shirt and robe at an alarming rate.
"I haven't brewed it or the poison in more than five years. It won't take long to prepare." He turns to Draco once more. "You have been treating it with the vials you took from my office, yes? The usual?"
Fuck. Yes, he needs to get rid of the sweater, and possibly his shirt too. He can’t just magic them away anymore. The prospect of moving his shoulder makes him blanch.
The door slams open, thudding against the wall with a bang as he walks in. There is the soft tinkling of a wind chime, and he curses Albus and his frivolous antics, suppressing the urge to banish the object. He even raises his wand, but then stops and lets it be.
, compared to what you did to me. This isn't pain. This… this is child's play."
“Umbridge was a death eater,” Harry shoots him a look.
“Stop talking,” her jaw is clenched so tight she can almost hear her teeth grinding.
Rosier comes to himself quicker than Harry was expecting. The man rolls them over and Harry is now the one pressed against the harsh stones. Thick, slimy blood drips form in Harry's face from Rosier's. He's given the bastard a bloody nose.
The man cuts him off. "Adams."
"Did you learn nothing," she says, her eyes taking on a malicious glint, and dread pools in Draco's gut, "from your mother?"
“We need to go,” Harry says softly, and Draco nods.
dumpster. Food that could've touched anything. Infused with all sorts of muggle diseases. Made by them, thrown away by them.
Draco, at least during their time together, has cracked the puzzle. Sort of. Any word or expression even hinting on Harry's own welfare is uttered with irony. There's a hierarchy to the words as well, and 'okay' is surprisingly down the list as far as Draco is concerned.
It’s the little things, the forgetting thing, being cold all the damn time no matter how hard Draco tries to make it go away. It’s the nightmares. It’s that terrifying silence that accompanies Harry’s uncertainty on top of Draco’s.
Harry jumps off of a very familiar rooftop, his action is NOT intended as suicide, but rather the consequences is treated as such. If this is triggering to you in any way, feel free to skip the last section of this chapter. We want you guys to feel safe!
Harry is an enigma. A puzzle that Draco cannot quite figure out, no matter how hard he tries, there's just something about him, a mystic force field that had revealed itself a few days after they had successfully settled inside the cottage. The Shell Cottage, as Harry likes to call it.
The boy shrugs. "Kind of. I wouldn't know, I wasn't around uncultured wizarding families. You should ask your friends."
"Stop that!" the man barks and Harry promptly has the urge to reply with 'Screw you!' and kick the man in the shins, but he yells "Let go!" instead.
He steps out of the fireplace, dusting himself off, barely glances around the study as his eyes land on the figure sitting behind the desk. Lucius’ cane is resting against his chair and he has two wands in his lap as he stares at Severus impassively.
"The truth is rarely simple."
Harry smiles. "Thanks."
Potter goes very red in the face, his nostrils flaring. "Choose my words?!" he yells incredulously. "Who do you think you are? Get over yourself, you self righteous bloody prat! Your words mean nothing to me,"
"Use dittany to disinfect it first--"

Harry shakes his head, and Draco had already known that it wouldn’t be possible, but his heart still sinks when Harry says, "We don't have a budget for another set of tickets. We need to get to… um, jeez what was the name…"
Harry stares at him. "Everyone hates boiled stuff. Trust me. It's an ingrained truth. It gets squishy and gross when it goes cold, and there's no taste even if you dump a whole salt shaker on it, except for potatoes and that's only if it's mashed potatoes with the right milk and spices--"

"She tortured you," it comes out before he can stop it. The deluge of words.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, his voice hoarse and painful sounding. The way it used to after one of Bella’s torture sessions.
"Sir."
He was probably risking his life by helping Harry.
Harry doesn't quite agree with that. It's not that Snape saved them from freezing to death in a blizzard. It's just that Draco
