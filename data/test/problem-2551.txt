But there was no time for Draco to dwell on any revelations from his work with Lee, or to plan his next move. The Wizarding-Adjacent bill was being read at the Ministry in just a matter of days, and almost every waking minute was devoted to helping Lee prepare. This seemed to involve spending more time with Hermione Granger (of late, Granger-Weasley) than Draco had ever wanted to, and listening to Lee’s speech until he could recite it by heart himself. He could tell she was nervous by her studied pretence at indifference, and he didn’t blame her; she’d never been to the Ministry, and her experience of their staff – with the exception of Hermione – had been entirely patronising and unhelpful.

“Fly with me, then,” Harry said, his voice throaty and unfamiliar.
-induced fantasies, Draco’s obsession with Potter grew week on week.
Draco collected quill and parchment, and Neville busied himself with writing a note to Potter. Draco watched him, waiting, while
They were both breathing heavily by now, hands growing bolder, tugging at clothing, grasping at flesh. Draco drew back slightly to take Harry’s lower lip between his teeth, nipping at it softly until Harry let out a long, broken moan. It echoed around them, far too loud, almost pornographic in the enormous room.
Since their arrival, Draco had been entirely distracted with worrying about Leonie, trying to avoid being recognised, and remembering directions. It was only as they walked past the Improper Use of Magic Office – alarming bangs and crashes emanating from within – and an imposing stone archway came into view, that he even began to put the pieces together.
She laughed – not the unpleasant, scornful laugh of last time, but one of genuine amusement. Draco hadn’t realised how much he’d missed the sound.
Ron groaned loudly. “Fucking
“…grateful Han, really… as soon as I can…”
“What?”
“Oh yeah. I’m meeting Ron.” Harry grinned. “Merlin, he’ll be glad when it’s over. The amount Hermione’s been stressing about all this, I’d be surprised if she wasn’t freaking out somewhere around here right now too. Why, d’you want to walk there together?”
“Lila, this is Draco Malfoy, and Leonie Burbage, co-owners of
here for the Quidditch, that is – that I’m not going to be here for the next few weeks.”
A loud whistle sounded.

Draco felt powerful, bursting with
, he could picture a multitude of alternative ways that their encounter might have gone, and he spent every private moment envisioning them in vivid detail. As he walked into the lab, there he was, on his knees, slowly sliding his hand round to the button on Potter’s jeans. On his lunch break, distractedly stirring potions, he instead rose to his feet and straddled the other man, winding his hands into that soft hair before tugging his head back, hard. At night, in front of the flickering fire, he knelt up and reached for Potter’s face, pulling him forward into a deep kiss.
Present-day Draco jerked back into reality again.
As Harry rolled his shoulders and twisted from side to side, his back cracking alarmingly, a loud yell rent the air, echoing from the trees. A second later, Ron stumbled out of the woods, muttering and cursing.
understand, Draco. After your treatment at the Ministry? I’m not surprised you didn’t think you were going to get a fair shot without some kind of help. Yes, you lied. You lied, and you hurt people, and for that you’ll face the consequences.” He snorted. “Good luck next time you see Leonie, is all I can say. But none of it makes you a bad person. You’re not irredeemable, for Merlin’s sake.”
stooping low enough to deliberately fuck a Muggle!
He sighed, pushing his breakfast plate to one side. With each day holding so little purpose, Draco knew how easy it was to allow darkness to creep in, to let fear paralyse him in its grasp. He worried for his mother, for how she would react when the inevitable happened. Broken by the trials and grieving the loss of everything she’d known, his mother had already fallen into a pit of despair, so consumed by thoughts of
“How can you be so sure?”
Silence fell in the room. Harry took another long swallow of tea. Under the table, Draco watched Harry’s toes curl and uncurl again in their socks. He scratched absently at his forearm, trying to slow his breathing, wishing that Harry would just come out with it, whatever

Draco automatically recoiled, the words knocking the air out of him like a hex to his chest. But – he thought carefully – it didn’t make sense. There had been what, six people in the room at his interrogation, including him? He’d studied all of their faces for long enough. He’d have known.
“Mmm.” Harry’s eyes were on Ginny as he answered. “Sometimes I do. I don’t bring them up here.” He looked embarrassed. “I… we can get tickets for anywhere.”
But time crept slowly forwards. The nights drew in, pupils and parents stopped by to purchase supplies for Hogwarts, and gradually, almost imperceptibly, Draco began to feel as though this
“But you must be filling your days somehow. Minerva mentioned that you did well in your N.E.W.T.s...” Neville’s voice faltered then, as though he’d let slip a secret. Draco wanted to push him, to find out what McGonagall had been saying, but he found himself holding back; knew instinctively it was
“Lee?” Draco stretched his arm out towards her as she moved back towards the lab. She pushed it away, furious. “Lee, come on. Look at me.”
The blood rushed back into Draco’s frozen limbs as he savoured the warmth of the room, and he removed his cloak, draping it over the chair nearest the door. Lee followed suit with her coat and scarf; her tight sparkling gold dress underneath causing heads, predictably, to begin swivelling towards them.
The man snickered. “Oh, are we making small talk now, Malfoy?”
? “I mean, why did you come back here? You always make it sound like you were having so much fun in New York.”
At the bottom of the fourth page, the
, it’s a good job you’re pretty,” Harry heard over the rush of wind as he zoomed past Malfoy.
Ron groaned, shifting back and forth from leg to leg. “Mate! We had it in the bag! How did you…”
And he felt guilty – so guilty, for all the people he was deceiving.
“But your trial was such a farce, I couldn’t get it out of my head. It reminded me of the way I was treated as a child – and I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy.” He nodded towards Draco, mouth quirking upwards. “Ironically. So after the trials finished, as soon as I started at the Ministry, I tried to change all that, quickly as I could. Hermione helped me. That’s an advantage of us being us, people tend to listen. And Crowson got – well, not what he deserved, not at the time, but I thought at least no one else would have to go through what you did.”
“Do I?” asked Harry, far too brightly.
Weeks became months, speeding by in a blur of long days and restless nights, of

“How the hell do you sleep?”
He didn’t even have to worry about making his excuses to Neville: no sooner had he wished him gone than Neville clapped him on the shoulder apologetically, explaining that he had to visit his grandmother for an early dinner. Distracted, Draco waved him off. His mind was already on more pressing matters.
Draco stared in horror at the blonde-haired devil sat opposite him.

He barely made it halfway through this time before his head dropped forward and his eyes glazed over again.
It was no use. He was trapped, once more, in his own broken mind.
As he entered the room, lit only by the fire, Draco could only make out a silhouette hunched over the worktop. He stepped closer.

tried to hold Draco back, but he was too keen, and it was too fast, and Harry hissed as the fabric pulled roughly over the head of his cock, which sprang free, slapping against his stomach loudly. Draco winced, embarrassed by his own eagerness. By way of apology, he leaned in, without preamble, and guided the tip of Harry’s cock into his mouth, looking up at him through hooded eyes just in time to see Harry’s head drop back against the wall with a thud. Harry’s hand dropped down to cup the back of Draco’s head, his fingernails scraping up through the stubble of Draco’s hair, finally coming to rest on his shoulder.
There were no snakes crawling up the wall, the Dark Lord wasn’t sitting in his armchair, the roof didn’t seem to be caving in, nor had the floor turned to water. No more hallucinations then, he was relieved to note, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. There was an orange glow coming from the hallway, fast-shifting shadows moving across the wallpaper where his door was open a crack. The living room fire had been lit. Draco listened intently, and almost immediately heard a muffled scraping sound coming from the kitchen area. His heart set up a steady gallop in his chest.
But all that had been months ago.
, that was all. And Harry never had any of his mates round either – they’d thought he still lived at Grimmauld, and the state of the place had been a convenient enough excuse. They’d always just ended up at some bar or club instead.
He narrowed his eyes, voice trailing off, and Harry’s heart began to pound in his chest. “What?”

“She’s been invited to the Wizengamot in a few months’ time to speak for a new bill to improve rights for Wizarding-Adjacent people – Squibs, that is,” he added for his mother’s benefit. “She’s been working with support groups, met lots of other Wizarding-Adjacents. Hopefully, if the bill passes, the Ministry will start registering their births, and helping them to get work. It can be hard to find decent employment in the wizarding world – the stigma, you know – and I wonder whether Lee might know someone who’d like to work outdoors, knows a bit about magical plants, that kind of thing. Then, when we sell off the Manor, we could retain some of the grounds. They could even live in the old gatekeeper’s lodge, if they wanted. You could show them what to do. Of course―” he added quickly, “―that’s if you wouldn’t mind. I know it’s not – that father wouldn’t have liked – I don’t know

“Er, here, for you.” Harry frowned and didn’t take it, instead indicating his own ubiquitous cup. “I know,” clarified Draco, “but this one’s Irish. I thought… the weather… the Cannons…” He tried for a laugh.

“Oh, I could do Sprout, McGonagall, Trelawney – the lot of them. I reckon you’d particularly appreciate my Snape.” He cleared his throat, looked down his nose and drawled. “What now? Blown up the cauldron
had been either friendly to him or the kind of overly polite which seemed to stem from a deep dislike tempered by the potion. No one had ever made fun of him.
The guests on either side stepped away, conversation once again ceasing as Dennis stalked across the kitchen. Draco shrank back against the wall, palm sweaty around his wand as he weighed up his options. Dennis began raising his arm, and Draco heard a few murmurs of encouragement from around them. He braced himself to run, but in very next moment, thank Merlin, Neville was there, resting a hand on Dennis’ extended forearm, voice calm but firm. “Not now, please. I invited Draco.”
“Yeah, well,” said Malfoy, tracing the knob of Harry’s right ankle, and – Harry thought through his blissed-up mind – trying to disguise a grin, “all that moaning and complaining you were doing was driving me crazy. Although I’m not actually sure that this is any better.”
“No, no, Potter,” Malfoy said quickly, with a tired smile. “Please.” He beckoned to Harry, who moved closer again, relieved. As Malfoy began speaking, Harry allowed his gaze to drift down, captivated by the flex of corded muscles in Malfoy’s lean arms.
– the way the little vials nestled so comfortably in his palm, the confidence that would begin to bubble up inside him even before he removed the cork, the sour-sharp tang as the liquid slid smoothly down his throat. He swallowed, curling himself forward and tapping his fingers against the railing, watching the stream from the largest statue cascade down, disturbing the water below. He tried to empty his mind, allowing the loud rush of water to fill his ears as he stared at the bubbles, waiting for the craving to pass, just as his Mind Healer had taught him.
Hermione shook the memory lightly from her head. “This isn’t… I’ve never seen anything quite like it. He’s not

“What’s going on?” he asked, voice scratchy with sleep. He opened his eyes one at a time, squinting up at Draco. “You’re dressed.”
At some point, he must have drifted off to sleep, because he woke with a start to a loud rapping noise coming from the bedroom window. He tried to ignore it, but it didn’t stop, and Draco opened his eyes with a groan. The sliver of sky visible through the skylight had turned almost to black, and he could hear the faint patter of raindrops hitting the glass.
. Did she tell you about the one with the diary, the big underwear, and kissing in the snow?”
“Anyway, this term I’ve started teaching the first years. Merlin, some of them are obnoxious. I feel sorry for everyone who ever tried to teach us.”
? They could have been shagging for over a month now, for Merlin’s sake! Instead, he was going to have to put on dress robes and revisit the worst night of his life in the company of hundreds of people who now hated him. Brilliant.
“I want that too,” he mumbled, softly, speaking to the bathwater. “I do. I want that too, Draco. It’s only that―”
Half an hour later, Draco found himself pressed against the back wall of the club, head buzzing from the alcohol and the steady beat of the music, his legs like jelly as the Muggle’s hand worked over his cock with a relentless efficiency that told of countless similar encounters. Sex on

Neville grinned. “Almost, but not quite. Hannah’s just started breakfast.”
Harry’s head disappeared. He was gone a full minute, which was just long enough for Draco to start picturing the entire Auror force emerging from his fireplace. But then suddenly an outline appeared, silhouetted against the green flames, and Harry stepped neatly out onto the hearth, alone. He was wearing dark jeans and a red polo shirt, which, Draco couldn’t stop himself noticing, highlighted the swell of his biceps perfectly. A memory returned, unbidden: the two of them lying entwined on the bed, Draco running his hands lightly up the back of those arms, squeezing gently at the muscles, feeling them flex beneath his fingertips.

“No, Potter, I don’t. Even
“Here they come,” murmured Draco, tone almost awed. Harry shook his head, completely baffled. But sure enough, a few seconds later a motorbike shot past, and by the time they’d reached the edge of the hill, the evening air was alive with the hum of engines, backfiring exhausts, and loud, excited voices.
“It’s just – Harry asked if I’m going to the Mungo’s Ball.”
Potter merely licked his lips. “You too?”
Her words registered, then, and Draco was suddenly guilt-stricken. It was

The thing was, Harry really
Harry sighed, looking up. Far above them, Malfoy was still wheeling about in a leisurely manner amongst sleepy patches of cloud, apparently unbothered by the antics below. Maybe he had been right after all. The three o’clock comfort break was coming up, and then – well, a decent rest was sounding better by the second.

Back and forth Draco walked, staring at the bathroom door, feeling vulnerable and sick to his stomach. His mind was flitting erratically from possibility to possibility, his mood oscillating between utter terror and giddy over-confidence. Draco grasped in vain at any possible explanation, desperate for anything he could cling onto as the world he knew tilted dangerously on its axis.
Hogwarts had been an unpleasant surprise. He hadn’t counted on Potter – always

“Hmm. Whoever’s going to end up taking you home, perhaps.”
“And four,” finished Lee, “he practically invited you to a party.”
But stupid, honourable Potter stayed true to his word, chatting away to Draco about the
Pansy turned to Lee. “Tell me!” she demanded.
“You’re not so bad yourself,” breathed Draco with a grin, turning his head to capture Potter’s mouth with his own. Potter groaned, moving into the kiss, just as the first few notes of a rousing Viennese waltz filled the room. Draco pulled back with a wink, clasping Potter’s hand once more, and steered him swiftly into a practiced spin. They moved together with liquid grace, through turn after turn, whirling around the room as the tempo increased. Could anything be more perfect, Draco wondered wildly, than this? The two of them bathed in warm light, the melody surging all around them as the music reached its crescendo, and Potter’s face radiant, eyes shining with joy. Draco beamed back at him, taking another step forward, and –
hmm, now is this word cock, or sock? I can’t tell.”
“I know,” says Harry, cutting off Draco’s halting explanation, because he does, he

seemed weirdly on board with all this, but Granger and Lee together struck Draco as a lethal combination, and one best avoided.
“Okay, okay!”
“How fascinating, Luna. Please, do go on.” Draco winked at Lee, who glowered at him and slowly ground her stiletto heel into the side of his shoe. But Draco didn’t care – truth be told, listening to Luna Lovegood expounding on her crazy but harmless theories was vastly preferable to running the risk of bumping into someone who took offence to his presence.
. So I did.”
Harry’s lips twisted, the horrible ghost of a smile behind them.
His eyes were intense again, greedy. Draco’s face grew warm.
“You’d do that? Why?”
She looked up at him. She seemed so frail, her eyes bright and wretched. Draco frowned, unused to such candour. He’d been raised to see his parents’ words as law, their opinions sacrosanct. He’d never thought he’d hear his mother even intimate that her actions might have been misguided.
“I think I mentioned I’d started seeing Hannah – Hannah Abbott, you remember, from school?” Draco didn’t really remember, but indicated that Neville should continue. “I probably told you, she’s a trainee Healer now, works at St Mungo’s. Anyway, I saw Harry last week – Harry Potter, you know,” he added in a totally unnecessary aside, “and he was still all depressed about breaking up with Ginny. Asked if Hannah had any friends I could set him up with, you know, help him get back on the horse?”
Thank goodness for the
“―right next to the food stalls?”
Draco ducked back behind the counter as Potter fired another spell at him, laughing as he left.
Draco’s eyes were wide. “What was that?” he demanded.
Dropping his useless wand, Draco pulled himself to the edge of his bed. With a hoarse moan, he lowered his legs and let himself fall, as gently as he could manage, onto the floor. He lay there for a few seconds, naked except for yesterday’s underwear, prickly carpet fibres pressed against his cheek, willing himself not to pass out again. Then, summoning every ounce of energy left in his body, he crawled slowly towards the en suite.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t be ridiculous. Of course I

lead the way, until he could feel a steady rumbling beat, vibrating through the pavement, overlaid by excited voices laughing and shouting. As he rounded the corner onto Old Compton Street and found himself amidst a merry throng of revellers, Draco’s heart began to thud in his chest, jangled nerves only partially soothed by
. It was just short-term, after all, and he had already decided that he would only take enough to last during shop opening hours, and none at all on weekends. That would allow him to see his mother on Sundays, sober. Then after a while he could wean down the dose, maybe save it for special occasions. It should be straightforward. He just needed to be careful.
Draco gazed out towards Battersea Park, where Albert Bridge was illuminated beautifully, golden reflections coruscating on the surface of the Thames. His slow exhale formed a cloud as it drifted out into the icy night air. What hope did he have?
You follow them, the room shifting and changing, to the Portkey Office.
This was the wrong answer, clearly – Neville’s stunned expression made that much immediately apparent. Draco lowered his wand, allowing the empty cups to settling back on the side as he concentrated. Had Harry ever
“Right? But all that ordering people around stuff, it’s not really me, you know? I don’t care about targets and conviction rates and all that rubbish; I’m good with things as they are. And besides… I mean, I like my job, don’t get me wrong, but it’s not my whole life. I work the hours I want, chase a few bad guys here and there, train up the new recruits – and I still have time to get to the gym, play Quidditch, even help out up at Hogwarts now and then. And then there’s all the charity stuff, of course.”

The lab itself was in complete chaos, with outstanding Owl Order requests strewn over all the benches, cauldrons haphazardly dotted about – some far too close together to be safe – and a huge pile of letters shoved under a pestle and mortar at the back. Lee’s voice rose to a high-pitched, frantic thing as she’d explained how St Mungo’s had made an enormous emergency order of their salve, which she’d stayed up all night last week to fill. To top things off, Lee handed Draco an official Ministry letter – her hands trembling – which gave notice that they would soon be carrying out a long-overdue audit on laboratory conditions.

Yet still he
The next day, Draco didn’t think twice before drinking the little vial of
“Oh, it’s not that bad,” says Draco carelessly, his first language suddenly a stranger to his own ears. “Besides, I can usually find some nubile young shepherd boy to share body heat with.”
Draco looked around, nervously, for the source.
“And?”
But Pansy clearly had her own agenda. She leant forward, resting her chin on her hands and studying his face with curiosity. “Yes, I heard that you were doing rather well. And―” Pansy’s eyes glittered dangerously “ – I suppose Potter’s endorsement hasn’t hurt you a bit either, hmm?”
“I don’t think I ever told you before,” he said, softly, “but I like your hair like this.”
“Either way, you were here as our guest, and I felt… so…” She trailed off, distracted, waving her wand at the floating saucepan which was pouring baked beans carefully onto the plates. “Anyway, where are my manners? Can I get you something to eat? Toast? Eggs? There’s probably even a bit of bacon if you can get to it before Nev,” she said, waggling her eyebrows as Neville stuck his tongue out at her. When Draco shook his head, she grabbed a fork and wandered around to sit at the island.
“I just wondered if you wanted to grab lunch any time soon. That new café’s just opened up on the high street. I thought we might –” Harry trails off as Draco smiles at him indulgently, tugging him down and dropping a kiss onto the side of his mouth.
In the end, Draco had to concede that the Mind Healer had been right. It

, it read.
“So long as at least one of them is –” But the rest of Draco’s words were lost as Harry moved into him once more, capturing his mouth in another deep kiss. Draco stumbled back, bracing himself against the carved wooden banister post, Harry’s body pressed up against him, his lips hungry, relentless. As Draco moved to kiss down Harry’s jaw, the ornamental braids of the aiguillette caught on the clasp of Draco’s own robe. Draco paused, momentarily disorientated, a sudden flashback distorting his surroundings. He blinked, willing it away, and Harry looked at him curiously, keeping a firm grip on Draco’s arm. When Draco had composed himself, he nodded minutely, and Harry kissed him on the cheek before leaning back and making a complicated flicking gesture at the front of his robes. The clasp flipped open, the robes flying off to the side, as he repeated the gesture and sent Draco’s sailing after it. The thrill of Harry’s careful magic running over him again made Draco gasp and shiver a little, as their robes settled neatly over the stair rail.
“Nev, that goes against― ”
“Damn right you will.” Harry looked back up nervously, before relaxing at the sight of Draco’s teasing smile. “Anyway, don’t apologise, it was just about the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”
confrontations like this. He could taste the Firewhisky once more on the back of his tongue, the sharp tang making him queasy. He felt as though he were watching the conversation from a distance.
Narcissa Black had been a mere twenty-three years old when she’d married Lucius Malfoy, and not quite twenty-five when she’d birthed her only son. Widely regarded as a rare beauty –
He paced up and down, up and down, as for the first time in months the warm, comforting sensation of
Instinctively, Draco’s eyes flew to his little cabinet. The doors were closed. It looked as innocuous as any piece of furniture, as though Harry’s discovery had never even happened. Draco listened intently – yes, their hushed voices were right outside the door. He didn’t have long.
Draco sighed, rolled over, and let sleep overtake him once more.
After he’d finished with the potions, Draco took his time cleaning the cauldrons, finishing them off by hand and paying meticulous, unnecessary attention to detail. He needn’t have lingered over it, though, for after setting the last one back in its cupboard, Harry turned to Draco, asking him earnestly if he was working on anything new lately. So Draco dutifully retrieved his notebooks, describing his projects a little indulgently at first, noticing belatedly – and to his utter amazement – that Harry actually appeared to understand his esoteric ramblings. As Draco struggled to conceal his surprise at being asked yet another bizarrely insightful question, Harry rolled his eyes. “Look, you’ve told me most of this stuff before,” he said, shrugging, as though it wasn’t a completely crazy notion that he’d not only sat through Draco’s lengthy potions diatribes, but paid such careful attention that he remembered them years later.
“If it helps, Potter, I like the tattoo,” said Malfoy, the very moment they’d resumed their previous position.
He pressed the heels of his hands hard against his brows, trying to come to terms with the morning’s realisations. If what they’d said was true, Harry fancying him was neither a recent nor a temporary occurrence – he’d felt like that for
Stubble scratches at Draco’s skin as he speaks, making Draco squirm away, suddenly ticklish. “Bit of this, bit of that. Farming, mostly. Back in the autumn I helped out with the olive harvest. The beach is about ten minutes away – I cycle, can you imagine? – and one of my neighbours brings me English novels when they come in to the local library. It’s not much, but –”
. How was I… me? Are you…”
– solid. Malfoy was squirming about too. Harry looked down at him, expecting to be met by a look of discomfort, or revulsion or… well, anything
“Oh yes, hello Potter. Fancy seeing you here.”
Warmth spread across Draco’s chest, bubbling through his veins, as their mouths moved together. Finally,
to be your guinea pig?”
“Sorry,” Malfoy chokes out; his laugh so genuine – hearty, even – it’s startling. “Not a bad try. But –” he winks, smile wicked “– I’m afraid I’d know you anywhere, Auror Potter.”
“Oh right, right. Sorry.” Harry worried at his lip, then shrugged. “Pass it over then, go on.”
Neville took a big swig of his tea, looking down into the cup thoughtfully. “I don’t think it’s embarrassing. I think it’s good that you’re not sitting around the house feeling sorry for yourself.” He tugged on the sleeve of his jumper. “After the war, I found it difficult to think about the future, you know? I think most people I’ve spoken to who went through it felt the same. Like, are we just supposed to carry on as though nothing happened? As though loads of our friends didn’t die?”
, Draco rushed out of the lab, where he was confronted by Potter, face like thunder, left hand gripping a walking cane so hard it looked in danger of snapping, right hand raised in front of him. Draco felt the usual thrill of
“Ah well,” Potter shrugged, “you never know. At least I got to give my side for once.”
Draco begs, eyes red-rimmed.

The room designed for welcoming foreign dignitaries and high-ranking officials must have already been one of the most opulent and exquisitely decorated of the Ministry’s public chambers. For the evening’s event, though, it had been expanded and repurposed effectively as a ballroom, to stunning effect. In the centre was a huge gleaming dance floor, and along one edge a stage was set up for a small orchestra, although only the front few seats were occupied – by a string quartet, who were playing a lively waltz. Surrounding the whirling couples were cherry trees, appearing to grow directly out of the parquet floor; their blossom-laden branches extending towards the middle and swaying gently in time to the music. Draco could even see several pairs of bullfinches, the males with their distinctive pink breasts, fluttering around at the top.
“I don’t know,” Lee continued, tucking the phone away in the back of her jeans. “Owls remind me of school – passing love letters across the classroom and all that. I always thought it killed the romance. I mean―” She reached over suddenly, snatching the letter from Draco’s hand as he howled in protest, and unravelling it to reveal Harry’s spidery script. “Case in point! Just
The shop looked almost exactly as it had the last time he’d entered at age eleven – vast shelves on either side straining with the weight of a thousand boxes, the scent of sawdust lingering in the air. Draco could practically taste the excitement of generations of young witches and wizards, stood in this very spot, raw magic waiting to be tamed, their futures stretching out before them. He felt sentimental, hollowed out, as he thought of his own wand. Of all it had done, in the end. He took deep, steadying breaths – and as he did, he spotted a few subtle changes to the shop he remembered. Firstly, someone had carefully dusted and painted each shelf in beautiful, rich jewel tones, which brightened the place up considerably. And secondly, the person stood behind the counter was
Draco stared after her for a minute, gobsmacked, before sinking heavily into an armchair. He was still shaking with adrenaline and anger, but he couldn’t deny that it was a relief to see the back of her. He’d remembered Pansy as hot-headed, but Merlin, that had been

? Because none of what you just said came as a surprise. I mean, at school, for example. Do you think it’s possible―” he asked, gently, twisting his head to look at Draco “―that even back then you were occasionally the tiniest bit… irritable?”
“You’re unbelievable.”
“Of course not.”
It went on for some minutes, Draco and Lee attempting to talk him down from his panicked state. As that memory finally faded, Draco felt emotionally drained, completely wrung out, already. But Lee pressed on, encouraging him, and each recollection began to come forth easier and clearer, like tugging and tugging at a thread until it began to unspool. The memories tumbled down towards Draco, slotting neatly back into place, until Lee just had to say something like:
“…or, you know, just relaxing, taking a load off…”
, but – four
Draco raised a sceptical eyebrow at his reflection, turning from side to side to examine his entire outfit. The mirror was usually complimentary – of course it was – and the robes definitely suited him, but

“Don’t you tease me, Draco Malfoy.” He flinched neatly away from her attempt to jab him with her elbow. She lost her balance completely, skidding on the stones and very nearly pulling the both of them to the ground. They wobbled sideways, forcing the shopkeeper outside Eeylops to jump backwards, the pile of cages he’d been levitating falling to the floor with a loud crash. When they’d finally righted themselves, both apologising breathlessly to the tutting proprietor, Lee looked over at Draco.
“Wouldn’t be the first time, would it?” Draco replied. “Besides, I reckon there’s no harm in getting the word out.”
“How the hell did you learn to do
you were chatting to?”
“You’ve got a nerve, showing up here, I tell you.”
She turned to Pansy. “I’m sorry, you said he’d been like this for…?”
“I should never have kept you a secret.”
“Well, originally it was only a couple of times a week, and then only when I was working, but then coming down got harder and harder. So now―” Draco looked down at his shaking hands, giving a weary, mirthless laugh, “―now, I guess I’m a potions addict.”
“Because,” Draco continued, words soft but sure, feeling the flex of tendons beneath his lips as his mouth drifted down to Harry’s wrist. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I don’t think it’s a good idea. Not tonight.”
He lay on the floor, watching the swinging cabinet door and trying desperately – against his body’s wishes – to cling to consciousness. He rolled the vial between his fingers, focusing on the way he could feel its centre of gravity change as the liquid sloshed around inside.
After a few seconds, Crowson let out a grunt of frustration and began stamping his foot down, hard. Draco could do nothing except attempt to cling to consciousness as he listened to the bones in his arm splintering with each blow. Almost delirious from pain and fear, Draco could faintly hear an angry voice, which seemed to be getting louder – until finally Crowson took his foot off Draco’s mangled arm and pulled out his wand. He pointed it at Draco, but his heated words were directed elsewhere.
“Sorry ladies, didn’t mean to interrupt your little tea party.”
“Narrow-minded bigots who tried to help a psychopathic despot take over the country?”
“Well, I must be, er – lots to do. Busy day. Anyway.” His eyes flicked to Draco’s face for a few seconds warily, before he glanced around him as if he’d forgotten where the door was.
“Look, Malfoy. This might sound strange, but – do you still play Quidditch?”
above filtered around Harry as he moved, gilding his skin, Draco’s world condensing into wonderful glittering fragments of pleasure, beauty, and warmth. Overcome with the bliss of long-held desire finally realised, Draco shivered, his eyes rolling back in his head, unable to stop himself from thrusting up with each slow roll of Harry’s body.
“And there was me thinking you were limping to get my sympathy.”
!” Harry grips the trousers tightly, clutches them to his chest as though he’s holding onto Draco too.
Oh Merlin,
Draco swallowed, unsure how to respond. “Right. The Cannons. That… that’s why I’m here,” he said slowly, throat dry. Harry’s hands were twisting together as though he wanted to grasp something. Encouraged, Draco passed over one of the coffee cups, steam rising from the lid.

“I blame McGonagall. But that’s not the point.”
Draco paused, surprised at Harry’s words. He’d never really thought about it in that way. In fact, he’d tried to avoid thinking about it at all, really. But all this – all these revelations – it was too much to take right now. He put his head down and kept walking, ignoring Harry’s calls behind him and slipping inside his bedroom. He flopped down onto his bed, pulling the duvet back over his body in a childish attempt to hide. Surprisingly, Harry didn’t follow him into his room, although Draco could still hear his stupid footsteps stomping around outside. He pushed his face deeper into the pillow, trying not to scream.
fine!” Draco protested, voice still several notes higher than usual. “I didn’t realise that our breakfast room would now be a bloody gift shop, is all!”
“… guess?”
“Sorry!” he called again, not sounding sorry at all, as Harry fought to keep the smile from his face.
“I just don’t fancy standing around lying to my friends and assorted Weasleys all evening when I’ve got things I could be getting on with.”
“Oh, right,” Harry mumbled, confused and rather wounded. How on earth had he managed to misread
when sober. Things he’d probably have considered outright
Bemused, Harry gestured down the corridor. “Er, you’re sitting on the floor outside my office?”
A relieved smile spread over Draco’s face he realised – his eyes sliding a little too quickly back and forth from pygmy puff to hot dog, to pygmy puff, to hot dog – what he had originally missed. He focussed intently on the space between them. His mind began to fill in the blanks, and a familiar shape emerged – a silhouette against the sky, at first. As Draco watched, it took on colours, sharpened up, until all at once he could see Harry, sitting on the bench, match programme in hand. Even with the Notice-Me-Not, Harry had taken pains to avoid being seen – an enormous black and orange scarf was wound tightly around his neck, while a Muggle-style bright orange baseball cap sat incongruously atop his curls, brim wobbling alarmingly in the wind. He looked ridiculous and lovely, his head tilted to the left as he followed the teams flying their formation laps, and Draco could only watch him, stomach roiling.
“What?” Draco asked, his face the picture of innocence, although he knew very well what Potter was referring to.
Potter tilted his head, considering. “Of you? Hardly.”
“We-ell, that’s the thing. Me and some of the guys – and girls – working here on Diagon, we’ve got a team in the London amateurs league.” Draco nodded, his eyes widening. Surely not! “Our Seeker’s just quit – this morning, would you believe? – and we’re looking for someone to replace him as soon as possible. We play most Sundays… I don’t suppose you’d be interested in coming along?”
But times had changed; he was driven by desperation now, and besides, the war had greatly narrowed his options. If by some miracle a wizard didn’t recognise and reject him on sight, an accidental glimpse of the Dark Mark would definitely ruin the mood, and things could quite possibly turn nasty. Besides which, Draco was painfully aware of his sexual inexperience. Anonymity was clearly key, so Muggles it was.

Once Neville had left, Draco wandered down to his lab. He spent the evening working on some Diploma potions and waiting for the

scars that still criss-crossed over his chest. Instantly, he knew that he didn’t want Harry to see them, that he couldn’t have any reminders of their past shattering this fragile new connection between them. Fortunately, Harry’s eyes were instead drawn to the bulge at the front of Draco’s boxers. Taking advantage of this moment of distraction, Draco dropped to his knees, nimble hands moving to trace the outline of Harry’s cock where it pressed against the seam of his trousers. Harry let out a loud moan.

“I’m sorry.”
A random little something for @drarrymicrofic 's prompt 'back in the saddle'.
Ah, now
“Go on then,” said Neville, through a mouthful of toast. “Tell us what happened.”
By the time Draco returned, sipping lemonade from a champagne glass, Lee was engaged in a giggly conversation with several young witches, and so he opted instead to join Neville, Dean, and Seamus over by the fireplace. The three of them were staring shamelessly across the room to where Ginny Weasley was sat along with a few of her Harpies teammates, who were clearly already half-cut, lounging around a table full of empty glasses and playing a noisy drinking version of Exploding Snap. Dean and Seamus were arguing half-heartedly amongst themselves as they tried to work up the courage to approach the group.
This, too, was full of people. Neville was standing over by the oven, but he was facing away and deep in conversation, leaving Draco at a loss. As Draco pressed himself into a corner, his eyes flicked over many semi-familiar faces, and he cursed his stupidity and his potions-damaged brain. How naïve he’d been, somehow imagining he’d be welcome amongst his old peers.
“Look, Draco,” Neville started, raising his voice to be heard over the hubbub. “No one is denying that you’ve had a rough few years, or saying that you haven’t paid for your mistakes. But you can’t ignore the fact that you hurt people. We were both really pissed off at first – we felt used and let down, not to mention pretty stupid. When we told Leonie, she just about wrecked the lab; I had to
Draco remembered her all right – recalled her quick draw and steady voice as she’d turned him into a slug. Not wishing to incite a repeat, he stayed silent.
“Come on, don’t be ridiculous. Let’s get you sorted.” He scrambled to his feet, holding out a hand for Draco. “A few years ago – I’m sure I told you, back then – I had to give a speech at Hogwarts. I felt exactly the same as you do now. As soon as I walked into the entrance hall, I just froze. It was like I was trapped in a nightmare. God, I had no idea how I was going to cope.”
“Shouldn’t you be… at Hogwarts?”
“Yes?” She met his gaze, and he inclined his head, embarrassed.
He laughed, mock-offended. “Why, Leonie Burbage. Are you asking my intentions?”
?” The word hit Draco square in the chest. “Is that what I am?”
“I’m glad someone’s laughing.” Potter smiled grimly as the knife finally embedded itself in the centre of the board.
“Draco…”

ball of light within? He looked again. No, he must have been mistaken. There were definitely two. Two lights, next to each other.
“How does it feel then? Is it still sore? Is it stiff?”
The voices were strange – high-pitched and squeaky like house-elves. Draco fought the childish urge to giggle as they chattered away.
– a blonde Hufflepuff girl he recognised was stalking over towards him, clearly planning on continuing what Dennis had started.
“No. No, Malfoy, I mean… you flirt with
He hadn’t felt this powerful since… since fifth year, maybe? He’d been existing entirely, it seemed, as a hollow shell; only now, finally, was he being filled with the essence of the person he wanted so desperately to be. As the warmth surrounded him, suffused him, he felt his fears, his doubts – all his negative emotions – leaving him, one by one, fluttering away as though out of Pandora’s box. Never again would Draco Malfoy be seen as worthless, aimless, or cowardly.
The moment she arrived, Draco knew that it was going to be a disaster. She stepped out of the Floo dressed to the nines in a short leather skirt and heels, wielding a bottle of wine in each hand, and greeted him with air kisses. It was four o’clock in the afternoon – why on earth she’d assumed they would be day drinking and then going out somewhere, he didn’t know – perhaps she hadn’t even considered the alternative. When Draco explained that he’d feel more comfortable staying in, she quirked an eyebrow, looking around his modest flat with poorly disguised distaste. Draco reddened, hastening to defend himself and trying to conceal his frustration. To be fair, he supposed, the last time they’d spoken, he’d been heir to an enormous fortune and living in a mansion.
Something ignites in Draco then, something rash and dangerous, sat just behind his breastbone. Unaware, Harry grins. “Maybe we’d need a bigger house, but –”
“Do you really, though?” Neville persisted.
, and – no, after so many years of keeping this a secret, that was simply

“Er… that would be the Abraxan rodeo. Wyoming, 2004.”
Yet, this time, rather than fading a little with each calming breath, the noise only seemed to be getting louder. Much louder, and closer too. Draco squeezed his eyelids shut tight, inhaling deeply once more. Bitter-tasting powder coated his tongue and entered his lungs, making him choke violently, and his eyes shot open. He barely had time to register the way the plaster was fracturing all around him before the entire wall gave way and he fell forwards into darkness.
Frustrated, Draco balled up his hands. “

Theo, on the other hand, would have to be dissuaded at all costs. The very last thing Draco needed was a romantic entanglement.

That would be fine, Draco thought, if he only knew what normal meant. Before he could think of a suitable reply, Hannah looked away, attention drawn by movement. Her eyes widened with delight as she called across the lawn.
Harry jerked upright, wobbling precariously. His eyes flew open. “Huh?”

Draco slept heavily. The morning light didn’t disturb him, nor the usual daytime noises as life continued, heedless, outside. His eyelids barely even flickered when Mrs Gibson’s Kneazle ended up in a noisy fight with a stray, just as dusk was falling. In the end, it was the harsh yellow glare from the streetlight that woke him, stinging his eyes as it streamed unrelentingly past the half-open curtains. He rolled over, stomach lurching, vague memories of the early hours’ events flashing before him. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and when he wet his lips, the taste of sour Firewhisky made him retch. He dragged himself out of bed to the bathroom, where he emptied the bitter contents of his stomach straight down the loo.
A response was probably warranted here, thought Draco, blinking stupidly. He felt faint with the implications of Harry’s words. All those visits, all those conversations, over all those years?
“Mmm. So anyway,” Harry says, biting his lip, “I reckon that it makes most sense if I’m the one who arrives first…”

Malfoy’s laugh was short and disbelieving. “Jesus, he didn’t tell you?”
“It’s not working, Harry. There’s no point in pretending.” He takes a shaky breath. “You know I’m right. Come on – let me –” He pats Harry’s knee, the touch almost unbearably casual, although he still doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes. Harry realises then; this isn’t Draco being impulsive. This was planned, carefully considered.

The door creaked slowly open. Familiar green eyes gazed at him dolefully from beneath a pair of enormous curly horns.

rejected, after all – had caused him to do something stupid and hurtful. Something which he could possibly have written off as a bit of fun for old times’ sake, if Theo hadn’t told him about Daphne. Thank goodness sense had prevailed when it did.
“Yeah?”
His mother was surprised, but pleased, when Draco asked to join her for a walk with the Crups. Since his father’s death, she’d insisted on wearing only black, and had become – if it were possible – even more reclusive. Draco had deliberately avoided spending too long around her since the funeral for fear she’d bring up the war, his future, or something else equally awful, so he was pleasantly surprised when on their turn around the garden none of those topics arose. The initially uncomfortable silence was quickly broken when Draco tripped over into the Alihotsy tree, causing him to burst into an uncontrollable fit of giggles. Eventually, both of them were bent double with laughter. After that, the conversation flowed freely.

When Malfoy had returned from New York, a year or so ago, to work at the Ministry – his office right next door to Harry’s own, no less – Harry had expected one of two things to happen. Perhaps Malfoy would be his old, annoying self – all bullying and bluster – and Harry would end up socking him one to shut him up. Or maybe he’d come back a changed man, contrite – or at the very least content to ignore Harry, hopefully with the good grace to avoid him in the corridors.
Malfoy shuddered. “At least yours is…
“Fuck off, Russell,” echoed Harry, weakly, glancing back at Malfoy, who was rolling his eyes after the now-retreating Chasers. He turned back towards Harry, but didn’t quite meet Harry’s gaze – clearly, Harry thought, stomach sinking just a little, the moment was gone.
“Yeah. I’d cast a Disillusionment, sit right over there.” He pointed to a bench by the side of the road, right in the middle of the crowd of Muggles.

was keeping him level-headed, Draco thought distantly, because his sober self might have slipped and poked Potter right in his healing wound.
He was lost, distracted by Harry’s soft whines, entranced by the way his body writhed at Draco’s every touch, and it was only when Harry bit him gently on the shoulder – eyes hazy, pupils dark and imploring – that Draco thought to withdraw his fingers, shifting under Harry and replacing them with his cock: a slow, easy slide that had them both groaning with pleasure. Harry leaned back down then, rested his elbows on either side of Draco’s face, pressed their cheeks together, and began to rock his hips against Draco’s.
Harry was still smiling, his eyes crinkling with amusement and tenderness as he watched Draco hop off the counter and turn away. Draco exhaled, forcing away the wave of regret threatening to wash over him as Harry’s footsteps sounded across the shop floor.
“Universal adoration getting too much for you?”
She rolled her eyes. “Ugh, not

Potter recovered so fast that Draco wondered if he’d been expecting the rejection. “Sure, sure, of course. Anyway, I should go. I’ll see you around, Malfoy.” He dropped his hands to fiddle with his belt loop, Draco’s eyes following involuntarily. “Let me know – er, about that, and about the reference. If you need it. Say bye to Lee.”
Harry shrugs, embarrassed, trainers squelching as he edges across the flooded floor. His heart swells with affection as he nears Draco – his gorgeous, sexy Draco, barefoot in his pyjama bottoms, hair still adorably sleep-rumbled – and he leans in for a kiss.
so!”  Spittle flew from the side of his mouth as he aimed a couple of forceful kicks at Draco’s ribs, before turning his attention back to the Mark. He rested his foot directly over the ink, then shifted his weight so his wet boot was crushing Draco’s arm into the grass. A sharp pain shot through the Mark, a deep, burning sensation, and Draco was overcome by a wave of nausea, stars dancing around the periphery of his vision.
turned him into a risk-taker, always do-first-think-later, and while a complete change in personality had once seemed a bonus – who wanted to be Draco Malfoy, at this point? –he was beginning to find the loss of his own identity quite disconcerting. He didn’t even feel right when sober these days – more like a boring, miserable version of the old Draco, completely consumed by guilt and self-loathing.
“Oh, give it a rest, Ron,” Harry snapped, thoroughly exhausted, and more than a little irritated at the unwelcome interruption. “You were asleep for half the match. You let in roughly a thousand goals. Does it even matter at this point?”

Harry had squeezed his hand indulgently and nodded pleasantly at nosy Muggles, only half-listening to Draco’s angry mutterings:

Harry surrendered, his eyes rolling upwards as Malfoy worked his upper back with incredible skill, pressing his thumbs in deep and eliciting even louder groans of pleasure. Malfoy’s slow, slightly shaky breaths disturbed the hairs on the back of his neck and to his utter embarrassment, Harry suddenly found himself getting… hard. He shifted on his broomstick subtly, leaning back in an attempt to avoid putting any pressure on the area. But if Malfoy noticed, he didn’t say – in fact, he didn’t say anything at all, merely persisting in his gentle stroking motions, skilled hands running gently over the hills and valleys of Harry’s spine, drifting down, further and further until they were kneading his lower back through his jersey – and

induced blur of purchases and orders, and despite the unprecedented success, Draco was utterly exhausted by the end of the first week. He’d had to make small talk with hundreds of people, most of them complete strangers. He’d lie awake at night until two or three in the morning, replaying snatches of conversations in his head and worrying about who would arrive at the shop the next day, until eventually he’d fall into a restless sleep, only to wake with the first morning light. And so, on Friday evening, as the high of
“Draco?” he tries appeasingly, gently pushing the door. It opens slowly, revealing a sight so unexpected that Harry clutches at the doorframe, afraid his legs might buckle. Kneeling on the rug, two large suitcases open before him, is Draco. He doesn’t acknowledge Harry, only raises his wand, sending a pair of trousers flying neatly from the wardrobe into the nearest case.
“Hardly anything. Spits out anything I give him. I’ve been casting nutrient charms on crusts of bread, tucking them into his mouth while he’s sleeping. Wherever he is, though, he certainly

“Better?”
It was that easy.
Harry was very close – touching distance, really – and looking up at Draco through his lashes with a faint blush staining his cheeks. Lightheaded, and in desperate need of breathing space, Draco took a few steps back. He pushed himself up to sit on top of the counter, running his finger over the repaired burn mark – a rough indentation in the grain of the oak, barely visible now – trying to settle his nerves.

“No. You just – you should go. Both of you.”
Try as he might, he could not stop thinking about Harry.

Harry’s voice was soft, nearby. A fleeting movement heralded a feather-light touch to Draco’s chin, as Harry tilted his head up with a single finger.
“Oh, shit, Pans, I think he’s spotted us! Hide, quickly!”

Malfoy’s eyes flicked downwards, and all further rational thought left Harry’s mind. He leaned in, nudging Malfoy’s dirt-smudged nose with his own and closing his eyes as their wind-chapped lips finally met. The kiss was gentle, hesitant at first, just a soft brush of their mouths together once, then again, and again; a culmination of the long night’s events – unreal, a little hazy, but somehow perfectly right. Then Malfoy’s hand came up to cup Harry’s jaw, and his lips parted, hot and needy, making Harry groan with want. He swiped his tongue over Malfoy’s lower lip, the earth shifting beneath his hands and knees as he tried to line their bodies up, to press even closer. There were little mulchy leaf fragments everywhere; the damp plastering Malfoy’s hair to his forehead and wicking up into Harry’s clothes wherever his limbs touched the ground. It should have been disgusting, Harry supposed, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Lost in the lazy slide of Malfoy’s tongue against his own, and entranced by the soothing stroke of Malfoy’s thumb behind his ear, he had absolutely no intention of stopping.
“But from what I understand, back then – that night – you would have hardly remembered anything that happened between us, since we became friends. None of our conversations, none of the things I shared with you, the things I thought we felt…”
“I’m sorry, Draco. I’m not going to lie to you. It can’t happen.”
“Your room’s exactly the same, Draco. It’s hard for me to relax here when – well―” He looked over towards the bed, gesturing – whether intentionally or not, Draco couldn’t tell – at the exact spot where Draco had stood, shivering, that fateful night, a year ago. “I know you don’t feel comfortable at mine right now, and I understand that too. I want to keep doing this – I want to keep seeing you, Draco. I’m just not – I’m not certain exactly where we go from here.”
Draco reached up to press his hand against Potter’s warm skin, turning his palm over to cover the wound. After a few seconds he took his hand away and watched in satisfaction as the droplet sought out the puckered area, starting to spread out along it. Acutely aware of Potter’s eyes on him, he ghosted his hand back over the skin, and began to gently massage the ointment in, rubbing slow circles with the pads of his fingers until long after all the salve had been absorbed.
He sipped it deeply, letting out a satisfied sigh. “So, how’s all that going, then?”
“All right. Can I come through?”

had evolved to
Well, Harry was off, anyway.
But as he stood at the top of the stairs, Draco could hardly reconcile those memories with what remained today. This attic, too, had been ransacked, that much was clear: the place was chaos. Parchment scrolls were strewn all over the place, along with hundreds of old books – spines broken and pages loose. Ink pots had been upended over the lot, rendering everything barely legible. A set of antique dining chairs appeared to have been swung against the wall, fragments of their broken legs mixing with large shards of what was once a Chinese vase. The oak wardrobe still stood in the centre, spilling its contents – torn silk and lace, mostly – haphazardly onto the floor before it. Was there anything of value left up here? Draco seriously doubted it.
I leave him alone? Neville?”
Draco stepped out onto the street and watched Potter stroll away, hands in his pockets. His feet were growing cold from the cobblestones, and he was distantly worried that Mrs Gibson might have been watching the whole thing from her flat, but he felt frozen to the spot, unable to do anything except stare in the direction of Potter’s retreating form. His entire body was aflame, despite the summer storm soaking him to the skin. Potter had smiled

Scowling, Harry rubbed the back of his head. “Was that really necessary?”

“Oh, absolutely. I mean, they knew about the Noseless Wonder, obviously, and they’d all heard of the Boy Who Just Wouldn’t Quit, but – well, the whole war thing just wasn’t a big deal there, y’know? I think there was some major Quodpot tournament going on in ‘98 or something. So for most people the details were pretty… hazy. Lucky for me, huh?”
Draco laughs; a single, disbelieving note. “No, you won’t.”
. It had to be perfect. He had to be the best Harry had ever –
“If you want us to be friends, Harry, I don’t see any issue. Unless―” He took a long, deep breath in. Harry had frozen, face still half turned-away. “Unless, of course, the problem is that Lee isn’t all you miss.”
, he’d proved himself to still be pretty decent on a broom, wheeling around the pitch, dodging Bludgers and taking everything in as though no time had passed since Hogwarts. When he’d finally, dramatically, caught the Snitch, cementing a sweet victory over the staff from the Daily
“Can’t you increase the sedative again?”
“Thank you, really,” Harry says, suddenly serious. “It does mean a lot to me. It’s going to be a tough night. I need you there, Draco.”
To Draco’s dismay, Leonie hadn’t been exaggerating about the state of affairs in the shop. Somehow, over a few weeks, Draco’s thriving business had suffered a decline in fortune so dramatic that it was hard to even imagine a recovery.
, almost, the look was that intense. Potter was so distracted, in fact, that as he leant over to pour them both a top-up, red wine splashed out of his glass, seeping into the tablecloth below. Draco, transfixed by Potter’s heated gaze, hardly noticed; those gorgeous eyes always

things were bad the last time I saw you, you looked bloody awful.” She gestured to his cordial. “But now you’ve kicked it, right?”
“All right.”
Draco scowled, straightening up and turning around slowly to avoid an unpleasant head rush. He could feel his face flushing, sweat beginning to seep from his pores, as he desperately sought to evade Harry’s gaze. Merlin, this was embarrassing.
With another reluctant nod, Collins scowled and began to turn away. Draco gave him a wide smile, inclining his head exaggeratedly. “
Entering the courtroom was another matter. As soon as the door swung open to reveal the enormous steel chair in the centre of the floor, Draco’s entire body went cold. Teeth clenched, he stared resolutely at the ground as he slipped quietly onto the bench next to Lee.
Harry hesitated, bringing a hand up to squeeze the back of his neck, and for just a second, Draco thought he was safe. But before he could start to relax, Harry was moving again, his feet resuming their original path.
They stared at each other for a second, that familiar curious look back behind Harry’s eyes, leaving Draco feeling unusually self-conscious. But before he could start to worry what it meant, before he could even blink, they were kissing again. Draco guided them slowly over to his bed, lying back and tugging Harry over on top of him.
Draco forced himself back into the present, only to find Harry himself staring off into the distance, a contented expression on his face. As his eyes came back into focus, Draco inhaled deeply.
, you’ll be, by definition, better than half the teachers in that place.”
“In the end, it was Ron who got me through. He sat right in the front row, told me that any time I felt like panicking, I should just ignore where I was and focus on him. I did, and I survived, and now every time I have to make a speech, or do something which makes me… well, uncomfortable, I always choose someone I know, someone encouraging, to concentrate on. Just in case. These days it’s easier for me, you know? Anyway, my point is, if you need to, you can just focus on me.” He coughed, awkwardly. “Or anyone, really. Lee. You could focus on Lee.”
“Well, I…”
“It wasn’t entirely that. I was getting tired of proving myself over and over, of having to work twice as hard as everyone else to earn the same respect. And the job was perfect.” He shrugs. “But I needed to get away. You weren’t exactly easy to forget, either.”
home right now, accusations of cowardice be damned. Harry was nowhere to be seen, everyone present was staring at him with undisguised disgust, and – oh
was especially complex and unstable, and perfection was by no means expected. In fact, as it took six months to stew and they only started brewing it in the spring term, they had been judged purely on the appearance and characteristics of the initial mixture. Draco’s had seemed fine, but he knew that didn’t mean much.
Why does Draco have to
“No, idiot, at the bachelor auctions. Those―” he cleared his throat, “―posh rich boys. None of them do it for you?”
– he’s all sensation; arm burning where they touch, chest aching as though his heart is still swooping out over the ocean. A fevered forever later, Draco twists his head, so that Harry’s eyes spot the tip of a tongue, swiping across wind-chapped lips. He swallows once, then closes his eyes, reaching out to grasp –
Draco grimaced. The shaking had spread to the rest of his body, and he spoke slowly to disguise the tremble in his voice. “Not well. A combination of my own brewed Dreamless and a lot of Firewhisky.”

The way you trusted me, the way I let you believe you’d finally found someone who understood you. That’s what you deserve, Harry. Him. The man you thought I was. Merlin, I can’t fucking
“There are like fifty rooms in this place, arsehole,” said Harry fondly, winding his hand around Draco’s wrist and dragging him out through the door.
Harry sighed, deeply. “Sorry, I shouldn’t – look, I meant it, I can’t talk to you while you’re on
, the only thing in the world that could compare to that feeling of absolute power. This – utter, mindless bliss – was everything he’d craved for so long; everything he’d been looking for in the arms of Muggle strangers, or racing around a Quidditch pitch, or at the bottom of a bottle.
Draco began to feel a little overwhelmed again, his legs trembling, and he sank down onto a nearby stool. Harry wandered over, then, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. “Can we go back upstairs?” he asked, innocuously. “It’s just that I
Harry took a deep, steadying in-breath before replying. “Malfoy. I am Deputy Head of the fucking Auror Office. You’ve got about
Harry swallowed hard against the lump in his throat. He’d fancied an early evening ride to clear his head; had planned to fly over to Hogsmeade and grab a Butterbeer. The last thing he’d expected was to find Malfoy here, slumped against the back of the broom shed, eyes bloodshot, his old Nimbus clutched tightly in trembling hands.
Eventually, the last of the employees emerged from the Manor, setting a barking alarm and pulling the enormous front doors closed with a grunt. He shone a torch around the grounds for a while to check for any stragglers, before heading home. The moon hung bright in the sky now, reflecting off the surface of the lake. Draco’s face seemed paler than usual, otherworldly in its stillness. Harry nudged his head against his shoulder.
Malfoy must have felt the same because he wasn’t pulling away either; in fact, his other hand was working between them now, thumbing open the buttons at Harry’s collar, and then his own. Harry bent forwards, his stubble catching against Malfoy’s as he mouthed gently at the line of his jaw, licking a languorous path towards the hollow of his throat. Malfoy flung his head back, the leaves crunching beneath him, as Harry finally managed to work a leg in between Malfoy’s thighs. As Harry nipped at Malfoy’s collarbone, Malfoy mindlessly thrust his hips forward, and Harry was gratified to feel a hardness pressing against his―
Luna floats down the aisle in a sunflower-yellow dress, a crown of scarlet radishes atop golden curls. Draco leans over, opens his mouth. “Not one word, Malfoy,” warns Harry, elbowing him pointedly.
In an instant, Harry is by his side, taking his hand. “Come on, then.” Young Draco flicks a bare glance at the cauldron in front of him but nods again, more certain this time, and Harry drapes that strange, shifting fabric over him and tugs him, invisible, towards the Floo.
“It’s to
. He trusted you with things he never told anyone else.” She looked over at Neville. “What was it he said to you, Nev? That time, at Ron and Hermione’s? When Ron asked why he kept visiting Draco’s shop, and he got really annoyed?”
Draco hummed, choosing his next words carefully. Afraid to look at Harry as he spoke, he picked up a quill, and twirled the tip of the feather around his finger.
Having not seen any of his contemporaries in the flesh for almost two years (and hardly at all in the year before that), it struck Draco now how much both Neville’s manner and appearance had matured. As he examined his face in the mirror before bed, he wondered whether Neville had thought the same of

man in public.” Draco looked up in the direction of Potter’s voice. Out of the corner of his eye could see an enormous crowd, a blur of different coloured Quidditch jerseys. He could see Dean Thomas, running over towards them. But mostly, he could see Potter, standing with his arm out in front of him – no wand in sight – still pointing directly at Crowson. Draco tilted his head to get a better view. Potter stood stock still, although his hand was shaking slightly. His expression could almost have been mistaken for blank were it not for the fire blazing in his eyes, which were focussed on Crowson. He looked, thought Draco, like a hunter, dispassionately marking his prey. The air around him seemed strangely still, as though he existed in a different universe to the chaotic scene playing out behind him. The whole tableau was nothing short of terrifying, and yet, despite the sickening pains in his arm and ribs, Draco couldn’t look away from Potter’s face.
“That’s amazing.
's prompt 'remake'.
If only things were that simple though, thought Draco, watching as Harry’s head swivelled around for the fourth or fifth time. For all his teasing, Harry was clearly tense – his spine a little too rigid, his shoulders slightly too high – and he was sat forwards, instinctively holding himself just a fingers-breadth apart from Draco. Draco knew all too well where Harry’s mind was going, as another heavy sigh echoed through the room. Draco had removed the bathroom cabinet soon after he’d gotten sober, replacing it with a plain mirror – he, too, had been unable to bear looking at it. Had he known Harry would be bathing in here, Draco thought, regretfully, he’d have torn out the whole damn lot.

had brought to him; had wielded it effortlessly for years. But somehow, suddenly, his entire future rested in the hands of the Deputy Head Auror using Draco’s bathroom. He’d been stripped bare, helpless as a babe once more, and he shivered, acutely aware of his nakedness. His erection had wilted completely the very moment the door clicked shut, and he Summoned some underwear from his drawer.
“Don’t be obtuse. What would you
She peered closer.
Draco felt like he wanted the floor to swallow him up, and it must have showed on his face, because Neville continued. “Now, I’m not saying the things you did were all right, you know, but I reckon it affected you, too. Like you said, you were living in the middle of it for a year. And the house arrest, and your father… nothing’s the same as it was.”
Harry sighed, irritation melting away as quickly as it had arrived. “I suppose not,” he conceded. “Is that why you left, then?”
His good mood lasted for precisely as long as it took for the first owl to return. Two potioneers sent terse responses that they didn’t expect to have a position available. Another reply curtly declared that no Death Eater would ever be welcome in their apothecary, and certainly not as an apprentice. Draco had half expected these rejections, though, and had secretly been waiting for the response from Slug & Jiggers. The proprietors there were old family friends, who’d always hinted at parties with a wink and a nudge that Draco would have a spot reserved to work for them. But the friendship had gone quiet during the war, and as the weeks passed, it became clear that they weren’t even going to deign to reply. He hadn’t bothered with Hogwarts – he still remembered McGonagall’s disdainful response to Draco’s request to return for his N.E.W.T.s. He knew a lost cause when he saw one.
Draco began to reconsider his recent interactions with Harry – could he somehow have misread Harry’s intentions? Was he going to stand out here by himself all evening… or something even worse? Draco shivered, his mind conjuring up nightmare scenarios where old schoolmates took great pleasure in telling him that he’d been the victim of an elaborate prank.
“If that’s all your questions,
“Yeah?”
. How many from our year is that now, eh?”
Footfall to the shop had dramatically reduced – definitely a blessing given the backlog – but a slow stream of unhappy customers still found their way to the store, usually determined to give Draco a piece of their mind. More than one patron marched up to him, loudly demanding to discontinue their orders, while others whispered cruel remarks and made unpleasant insinuations as he carried out transactions. One old man – a jagged scar down his left cheek that ignited some distant half-memory – drew his wand on sight, screaming accusations as he fired a hex at Draco which bounced off the wards, knocking over a shelf. While Draco froze on the spot, Lee practically flew out of the lab, completely incensed. She skidded to a stop directly in front of the man’s outstretched wand, telling him bluntly that he’d better fuck off before she called the Aurors. Fortunately, he did, and no sooner had she slammed the door behind him than they mutually decided that Lee would cover the shop floor until things improved.
The voices were all around him, and he recognised the words they were saying, but none of it made sense. It was bizarre, thought Draco, to be here, but not

The bruising had receded, and the scar was growing paler still. Slowly, deliberately, Draco reached out lightly and touched it again.

“Stop.”
“I mean,” he said to Neville and Potter the next day, as they watched her adding salamander blood to the Wiggenweld Potion she was stirring, “I did get Vince and Greg through their Potions O.W.L.s, and Greg thought an Adder’s Fork was something you’d use for eating steak.

“Course, most people – Muggles, I mean – they want to see all your papers and such, before they take you on…” Bryn continued, oblivious. Harry was right behind Bryn now, opening his mouth to speak, but Draco shook his head urgently, nodding towards Professor Sprout. To Draco’s amusement, Harry did a mildly horrified double take at the sight of her. He threw one last hesitant look at Draco, before stepping away and vanishing into the crowd.

“Who says I can’t have a Wizarding-Adjacent assistant?”
“I know,” he says carefully, letting his hand settle casually against the side of Draco’s leg, “I know you thought I was ashamed of you. I know that’s what I let you believe, but I swear it wasn’t – it wasn’t that. Not really. It was selfishness, again. I wanted –” he swallows, “I wanted you all to myself. It was probably – no, definitely – the second worst mistake I’ve ever made. I’m so, so sorry, Draco.”

According to the Mind Healer, it was better to attempt this kind of thing in an unfamiliar environment – she felt it would be less confusing for his brain when trying to consolidate old memories, and so in the end Draco and Lee Flooed over to Lee’s flat and settled themselves down on the sofa. He explained to Lee what he needed her to do – set the scene for him, help nudge his mind into reliving the events. Fortunately for Draco, she was the perfect candidate: her eagle eyes never missed a single detail, and she was both willing and able to remind him of many a conversation his

Harry had no choice but to follow, throwing one last, helpless glance behind him at Malfoy as he picked his way through the undergrowth.
. He sighed, saddened to realise that Harry knew him better than he knew himself. Draco had lived his entire life a coward; it made sense that he would take the coward’s way out.
The Cannons’ next home match was two weeks away, Draco realised, spotting a flashing schedule on the stadium wall as he wandered miserably to the Apparition point. He felt more confused now than he had before the game. He thought about Harry, the way he’d reacted when he’d spotted Draco – his almost-laugh. Later, that big open smile. But he also saw Harry’s expression when Draco had asked him to get a drink; the way he’d headed off any attempt at conversation, face shuttered.

am gonna Apparate home, take a long and leisurely bath, apply industrial quantities of healing ointments to my poor, aching limbs, and then crawl into my lovely bed and sleep for at least ten hours.”
The days continued to tick by apace. Time was like that, Draco had found – whenever you wished for it to slow down, it would laugh in your face, and suddenly you’d find yourself another week closer to a future you didn’t really want. And it was becoming inevitable now: Draco’s speech had returned, his physical symptoms had improved, his cravings had (mostly) subsided. Alongside all that, he had learned to make sandwiches, and coffee, had cleaned his kitchen the Muggle way, had read several issues of
“Have you wanted to?”

Draco rolls his eyes dramatically. “Complicated. Did you know that if someone damages their wand arm, there are eleven alternative channels that magic can take?”
“No. No, no – I – I can change. Let me try, you’ll see.” Harry’s plea hangs in the air between them, and Draco looks over at him now. His eyes are softer, but no less resolute.
Draco stepped forward automatically – that inexorable tug he’d never been able to shake – but stopped as quickly as he’d started, suddenly uncertain.
Potter leant back, cold air replacing the press of his body, leaving Draco bereft. His eyes snapped open just in time to see Potter disappear through the door. He threw Draco a cheerful, “You should think about it,” before striding out into the rain without a backwards glance.
“But I’ve never seen anyone manage to take
Draco felt the start of a blush creeping up his neck and attempted to hide it behind his mug. “I’m beginning to see what Neville meant, to be honest,” he muttered.
“Well, that’s what Harry tells me. He says you’re a good listener, that you make him laugh. He also says you’ve changed.”

The agent frowns. “Oh, sir, this will only take a minute. You’re here now, surely you can just come up with me. If you like the flat, you can always –”
Potter’s expression was benign but curious, bright eyes flicking searchingly back and forth over Draco’s face.
Draco’s head snapped up, and he looked over, surprised. The fire had died back a bit now, the room settling into a gloomy monochrome, and it was hard to make out the other man’s features. Harry made no attempt to turn towards Draco as he spoke, and his profile gave Draco no clues as to what he was about to say. Whatever it was, it couldn’t be good. Good news didn’t tend to turn up at midnight. Draco half-wished the light was on; wondered whether perhaps Harry thought this would be easier in the dark.
The bedroom was where things had begun and where they’d ended, too. Maybe it shouldn’t be such a surprise, then, that he would feel like this, with every crack in the ceiling and every bump on the wall representing another opportunity lost. Regret, hurt and shame thunders through him, hard and relentless, and he aches with it, reeling back on the threshold, unwilling – unable, perhaps – to take a step further. The agent almost walks into the back of him – giving Harry an unpleasant nostril-full of cheap aftershave – and stands there grousing to himself as Harry takes in the empty room. Four circular imprints on the bare carpet are the only sign that anyone ever slept here at all.

There was no point arguing. Draco sighed. “Yes, I know.”
.” She inclined her head apologetically to Lee, who nodded. “And to be honest, I didn’t really believe it. I thought it might be some kind of gimmick, a publicity stunt or something. No offence,” she added quickly, as Draco winced. “But now, meeting you, I get it. Really, I do. The only thing I can’t believe is how you’ve managed to put up with Draco for so long.”
“Hannah not about, Nev?”
Pushing down the panic that was twisting in his chest, he groped about the bed for his wand, fingers curling around it instinctively when it finally rolled into his palm. He lifted it up, intending to Summon Pepper-Up potion from his dresser; but to his dismay, his whispered
Harry raised his eyebrows. “What would you call it?”

The tree arrived, as agreed, the very day of the party. It was beautiful, at first, with an artfully twisted trunk and tightly closed white buds which sprouted from its trembling branches as Draco levitated it slowly upstairs. But his pride at locating such a perfect present didn’t last long once he’d realised his short-sightedness: you couldn’t shrink living things, of course, and there was no way to fit it through the Floo. In the end, Draco ended up Apparating with the silly thing directly into Neville and Hannah’s living room.
“The Leaky’s good though,” Lee said thoughtfully. “For us, I mean. Like, lots of Wizarding-Adjacents might feel uncomfortable in some posh restaurant in the middle of Wizarding London, but we’ve all been to the Leaky. I guess it’s the meeting point of the Muggle world and the Wizarding one. So a bit like us, really.”
“I didn’t make those
made sure he wasn’t. Sometimes he’d take drugs with the Muggles, inhaling sharp-smelling fumes from little glass bottles, swallowing brightly coloured pills or snorting powders, dancing until the sun came up before stumbling – sweating, fucked-out and parched – back onto Diagon. Other times, he’d let someone pick him up and take him to their place, where, disinclined to stick around for awkward conversations afterwards, he’d make an excuse to use the bathroom and Apparate directly home to his flat.

Lee snickered, and Draco gave her a stern look. He sometimes wished Pansy would be a little less… Pansy. Not twenty minutes ago, Lee had been practically incandescent with excitement to see the first snow of the year, face young and delighted as she held out her hand for flakes, watching them drift lazily down and melt under the warming charm. Now she was giggling at Pansy’s sex jokes. It made his head ache.
Draco landed in his flat, miraculously un-Splinched, and fell down hard onto his knees. Lightheaded from hyperventilating, he rested his head on the floor, swallowing down the bile in his throat. He focussed on taking a few deep breaths, berating himself for his stupidity as his heart rate slowly returned to normal. What an
“Come to mine,” said Draco, voice trembling, a lump growing in his throat as he watched Harry rub the sleep out of his eyes. “Stay over with me. I’ll… I’ll make you food or bring you tea or… anything. Whatever you want. We can try this another time, me sleeping here. Another night, just not tonight. Of course,” he said, nervously, “that’s if you want there to be another night―”
Finally, Harry shrugged. “Well, what’s it been? Five, six months? Not a bad run. I shouldn’t be surprised – you’ve always been a stubborn bastard.”
“I know. Maybe I like the idea of you owing me a favour.” Potter grinned, crookedly. “After all, who knows when I might need some potions expertise?”
“Of course not, sir!” Malfoy affects horror, eyes wide. “Unicorn blood is illegal, and….”
For the ornamental rotunda that Harry and Draco are sitting on, think
They wandered the gardens for an hour or so. Draco trailed behind, enjoying the fresh spring air, allowing his attention to drift away from the pleasant sound of his mother and Neville discussing magical pollarding techniques and the best times to deadhead the rhododendrons. Just behind the folly, they passed a huge overgrown Moly plant, and Neville lamented the blight that had badly affected their crop at Hogwarts. Quick as a flash, Draco’s mother knelt, took two good size cuttings and called for Itti to bring some tubs and soil. As Neville left the Manor that day, this time laden with plant pots, he was beaming from ear to ear. He shook Draco’s mother’s hand effusively, promising her that he would be back as soon as he could with a sample of Sprout’s own-recipe slug repellent.
“Sorry. It’s just – they’re
“Oh dear, that’s a shame.”
“Well,” said Draco thoughtfully, “you said you’d wanted to wait a year.” He sucked his bottom lip in between his teeth, tasting salt in place of Harry’s fingers, watching Harry’s eyes darken as they tracked the movement.
is just about right, Potter. Look, c’mere,” he said with a sigh, whipping out his wand and jabbing it – unnecessarily firmly, Harry felt – against Harry’s arse. He whispered something, and Harry jumped as a cool tingling spread disconcertingly – but not entirely unpleasantly – across his buttocks.

always been telling him what to do: that’s how it had felt at the time, at least. As though he’d been annoyed at Harry; envious of his freedom, when Draco still couldn’t venture out safely in wizarding London. Jealous of him for having hobbies while all Draco’s time was taken up with studying.
Yes, her Gryffindor parents might have named her for a lion, but Draco was certain Leonie was a Slytherin at heart.

Harry rolled his eyes. “I remember Oliver.”
“No.”
“I reckon we’d better,” said Harry. “Let’s make it a good one, yeah?”
“It… just―”
She looked up at him, eyes bulbous through the fogged-up safety goggles. “You’re sure this time?”
What the hell is
“So romantic, Potter,” Draco scoffed, but a reluctant smile tugged at the edge of his mouth. He stood up, extending an arm to Harry, pulling him up and pressing another chaste kiss against his lips. He kept a tight grip on Harry’s hand as he tugged him away, around the hill and back out into the dark night. “Come on then. I fancy fish and chips, what d’you reckon?”
So distracted was Draco that he startled at the sound of a voice close behind him.
cellar, to be…” he began. Lee coughed loudly. “Er, I mean, it’s lovely to see you too, Luna. You look beautiful today.”
Eventually they land on the pier. Draco’s brought them back to Southend, Harry realises, but he’s strangely shy about it. Harry rustles up enough coins to buy a single ice cream – mint chocolate chip, Draco's choice – so they share, feet dangling over the edge as the waves crash loudly against the metal below. The sun dips low, the sky’s peach blush spreading across Harry’s cheeks when Draco slides close to rest a careful head on his shoulder.
Sticking firmly to Draco’s ‘no
“Ta very much for that little show, Potter. Honestly, for a man who says he hates publicity, you don’t do yourself many favours. Now get in here, would you?”
Draco didn’t recognise the voice, but then he could hardly hear a thing over the ringing in his ears. A shadow fell over him, before a foot to his ribs forced him over onto his back. He blinked up at the man smirking down at him, recognising it barely a second before a large glob of spit landed smack in the middle of his forehead. It slid sideways to the ground, breeze cooling the wet trail it left. Draco blinked, and the scornful face overhead came into focus. His breath died in his throat.
“How I’m doing?” Draco laughed incredulously. “You wanted to see how I’m doing? How do you think I’m doing? Your psychopathic Auror buddy cursed me from behind and then smashed my arm up. I’d say I’ve had better days, wouldn’t you?”
Malfoy blinked.
“No?” Harry raises his eyebrows, hoping he looks either interested or impressed; whatever reaction Draco was going for, anyway.
“Oh, come off it, Draco. Those pictures in the paper, the day you opened? Him and Longbottom, leaving your shop? What was that all about?”
But with no time spent sober where he could process what was happening, no chance to come up for air, Draco found himself sucked deeper and deeper into his fabricated world. The control he’d prided himself on in his early days of
remember Hogwarts, even if you don’t…” His eyes wandered slowly up and down Harry’s body, the tip of his tongue poking out to wet his lips. “Why not forget about it, just for now, and come back to bed. I’ve been thinking about it too, you know – God, the things I could do to you… I’ll make it so good, you’ll see. I’ll do anything you want…” He reached his hand out towards Harry, raising one eyebrow and giving his most persuasive, million-Galleon,

“Of course. I’ll… I’ll be right behind you. Just popping to the loo.”
“Mother, are you well? You seem anxious today.”
Hardly able to believe his ears, Draco took a tentative step forward. He wanted to grab Harry, to shake some sense into him. “This,
“Yes, yes, thanks Potter.” Draco scowled. “Sure, she can be a little… coarse at times, but she’s clearly a hard worker, and it’s not like I haven’t heard worse. Anyway, she’s been through so much shit since the war, it’s a wonder she’s handling it half as well. You know,” he said, lowering his voice and glancing back at the lab, “after her parents were murdered, the Ministry literally didn’t want to know. Now she’s stuck living in a completely different country, with Muggles who she barely knew, and having to hide all her knowledge of the wizarding world. I’d be pretty pissed off too.”
“Oh come on, you started all this, remember? Back in fifth year? All so I wouldn’t tell anyone that―” Draco stopped, cut off mid-sentence by the highly unpleasant sensation of an invisible hand, squeezing his throat.
That Saturday, his first day sober in over a week, he received two owls. Both of them were unsolicited and quite unwelcome, and served only to intensify the headache which had been threatening since he’d lifted his head groggily from his pillow. The first one to arrive was a short note from Theo. It mentioned that he’d seen the article in the

Or, Draco thought, perhaps he was an especially good teacher.
It was sitting on the counter when Harry padded downstairs, still wiping sleep from his eyes. Beside a steaming cup of Earl Grey, the accompanying note read:
“I’m sorry, I’m just thinking what a fortunate coincidence this is.”
Draco smiles hesitantly, moves to lace their fingers together. “It’s fine. Look, I – I hope I’m not overstepping the mark here, and this is possibly the worst idea I’ve ever had, but I can’t leave without asking. I’d like to see you again, Harry. Do you think, could we –?”

A similar situation had arisen the day that Lee asked Draco for help balancing the books. It turned out that the Occamy eggs – which to all intents and purposes disappeared after arriving in the store – were causing the confusion. Every time Lee tried to ask Draco about them, she would suddenly lose her train of thought and have to start from the top. In the end, Draco had taken the accounts book and Vanished the entry about Occamy eggs.

’s influence extended further than he could even imagine. There was the time that he realised he was running out of dragon liver, only to receive an Owl from Romania two days later informing him that one of the Longhorns had died unexpectedly and that he should expect a large shipment of supplies. Then there was the day that Lee discovered she’d accidentally put in for a double order of Wiggentree bark – and just half an hour later, a Patronus arrived from St Mungo’s with news of a freak accident in the Department of Mysteries requiring as much Wiggenweld Potion as they could brew.
“Sorry. I just… I’ve been waiting for it, you know? To have you alone with me.”

“There’s no one around.” Draco realised as he spoke that it would sound ridiculous – they were in the Ministry Atrium, for Merlin’s sake – but imbued with a healthy dose of
Malfoy was leading some kind of new Unspeakables Field Division, and although no-one seemed to know exactly what this entailed, Ron had returned from a joint mission raving about ghosts and voices and mind-control tricks. This had, unfortunately, only served to heighten Harry’s obsession. He fell easily back into old habits, scanning every room he walked in for Malfoy’s sharp face, his dramatic gestures, his easy, bright smile. Harry began bringing in a variety of cakes and biscuits, eager to hear Malfoy’s verdict on each one. And before he’d even appreciated what was happening, it was already too late.
Draco smirked. “So you like what you see, then?” Potter’s mouth twitched, the beginnings of a smile playing about his lips, even as he rolled his eyes to the heavens. Draco inched closer, his hand moving up to lightly finger the sleeve of Potter’s robes.
Pansy’s father was a barrister. Keen to distance the family from any lingering associations with Voldemort, he’d made arrangements for her to go straight from Hogwarts to his firm in Switzerland. There she’d worked – although to hear her tell it, there hadn’t been much of that going on – as a legal secretary for the first year, and was now back in England, partying, dating, and – occasionally – studying for the Bar.
– have. So, ignoring his inexperience, he braced himself against the wall, focussed on breathing through his nose, relaxing his throat, and pushing back against Harry’s gentle thrusts.

Harry nodded. “It was. I thought you might not recall much, since Lee wasn’t there. I only bring it up because, well...”
“Just a few more for the full set then! Here’s hoping!” With one final slightly-too-hard pat which had Ron stumbling forwards slightly, Draco stepped back. Ron was grinning, genuine this time. “I’m sure Harry wouldn’t mind arranging an Auror detail, if you’re worried.”

Lee sighed, indulgently. “Because,

She squealed with delight, rubbing her hands together.
His speech returned, little by little. That, too, Hannah helped with, running through countless boring vocal exercises she’d found in reference books, appearing to all the world as though there was nothing else she’d rather be doing. Her patience seemed limitless, especially to Draco, who these days was far too easily irritated – quick to frustration and even anger. He was so unused to moderating his emotions, so overcome with everything that had happened, that more than once he found himself – after failing to get out a simple word for the umpteenth time – shouting utter nonsense at Hannah’s tired face. But nothing seemed to faze her, and she didn’t even question his request – when he was able to make it – that she move the standing lamp out of his bedroom.
, it hurt.
“Right.”
Harry laid a firm hand on Draco’s arm. “No, I understand. I didn’t think, Draco. What can I do?”
, he knew with total certainty that no one would spot them. Impatient, desperate for more, he pulled Harry in for another searing kiss. Harry returned it for a few seconds, laughing helplessly against Draco’s lips, before turning his head to the side, forcing them apart. Draco gave a small moan of displeasure.
Draco took Harry in deeper and deeper until he let out an impatient groan, bringing his other hand to the back of Draco’s head, snapping his hips forward desperately. Draco closed his eyes, seeing

Great name, by the way.”
“Susan?”
Out of practice as he was at large public gatherings – and certainly at formal events like this – Draco should, by rights, have felt embarrassed, or at least a little uncomfortable. In fact, he felt amazing.
“Oh, Lee…”
. He was no good with other people anymore, not on his own.
“Oh Merlin, at least,” said Draco, playfully. “A

he thought quickly.
“Oh.” To Draco’s immense frustration, Harry’s tone was carefully neutral. Draco gently pressed for more. “What else did she say?”
“…and d’you know what, I really didn’t think they could top the whole tattoo thing,” said Ron, scratching absently at his hip, “but they’ve only gone and bloody done it.”
– do that.”
“Under Veritaserum.” He produced a tiny vial, which grew in his palm the same way the pasta had. The mere sight of it made Draco’s heart jump into his mouth. He sat forwards, glancing desperately at the door, sweaty hands curling involuntarily into fists.
“It’s not all bad,” said Harry, grinning. Draco felt all the buttons on his shirt pop open, followed by Harry’s, and he groaned, pulling Harry closer, tugging his top up and forcing his hands underneath, Harry’s bare back hot under his palms. He inhaled Harry’s scent, nipping and sucking lightly at the thin skin just above his collarbone, luxuriating in the closeness, in being
Unimpressed, Draco rolled his eyes. She nudged him with her shoulder, the corner of her mouth turned up in a wry grin. “Okay, fine. Too soon to joke about it. Noted.”
“Shh, shh… Please, let’s all just try to stay calm.”
, Auror Potter, for saving me from the nasty man!” He lifted his chin defiantly, watching as Potter recoiled.
He sighed. The letter was classic Pansy – teasing, unsympathetic, and self-involved. And just what was he supposed to do now? If she followed through on her threat – and it
Draco shook his head, covering it with his hands. They’d been in there for two days, waiting for their trials to begin. Denied more than a few seconds of sleep at a time, all Draco could do was focus on his mother’s weight as she slumped against his side, and try to stay awake by any possible method. Parched lips hardly moving, he cleared his throat and began reciting once more.

“Harry?”
A grunt of acknowledgement made Draco glance quickly over to Harry. He was staring out into the living room, expression inscrutable under the flickering light. With practiced fingers, Draco used a match to light the hob. The quiet roar of the gas igniting drew Harry’s amused attention. Draco moved the kettle onto the stove before turning around properly, surprised when Harry shifted in his seat, eyes darting away across the room.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Great. When you put it like that, I sound like a total wanker. But it’s

“No. In me. Need you,” he breathed, the sheer force of want behind his words giving Draco chills.

was still trying to compel him towards Potter – Draco spun to face the wall, adjusting his robes discreetly, and blurted out the first thing that came into his head.
Malfoy tilted his head thoughtfully, staring off into the distance. Several seconds passed, and Harry shifted his broom away slightly, suddenly concerned. “You don’t have to – I can just…”
, someone he didn’t want to hurt.
Draco laughed. “Thank you, although I should probably tell you that I was planning on growing it out again.”
“Ah yes. Thank you. So I had all that crap at home, but with the Yanks it was almost too easy. One decent Occlumency demonstration and they snapped me right up. Sent me off for advanced training in Legilimency, false image projection and memory modification too, then set me up with a nice swanky office, a hefty salary, and a fresh start. All at the bargain price of leaving behind everything I loved.” He shrugged, too casual. “Easy decision, in the end.”
“What? No! How―?”

Who would want to act as an assistant to a twenty-one-year-old ex-Death Eater? Draco dreaded to think. Even
“Oh, don’t worry about that,” she interrupted, picking up the second, half-empty bottle of wine, and slipping her shoes back on, her lips tightly pressed together. “I have no intention of staying a moment longer in your… home.”
“Someone could walk in at any minute. We’ll be – stop it!” he grinned, trying to bat Draco away as he continued kissing down the side of Harry’s neck. “I mean it! There are reporters here. We’ll be on the front page tomorrow if you’re not careful. Let’s go somewhere. Preferably somewhere with, you know, a bed.”
“Exactly,” Harry agreed, moving to do just that.
, Malfoy. You should grab a shower, bath, whatever, and get yourself dressed. I assume you haven’t eaten?” he asked, opening his palm to reveal a tiny cube. Draco shook his head. “Great. I’ve brought some pasta, I’ll heat it up.” The cube rapidly enlarged before Draco’s eyes until Harry was holding a full-sized plastic container. “We’ll eat, we’ll wait, then once it’s worn off, we’ll talk, all right?”
Harry stares miserably into his coffee, reminiscing: pale fingers tangled in dirty bedsheets, smirking mouth stretched wide around his cock, filthy promises gasped into sweat-soaked skin.
“Uh, thank you?” said Harry, instinctively tugging at the hem of his jersey, hoping to hide the ink below. He could feel himself blushing and hoped against hope that the light was dim enough to hide it. “But, uh, how is it that you’re so… intimately… familiar with my tattoo?” Harry asked tentatively.
Harry sighed. He must have moved closer now; Draco could feel the gentle caress of his breath on the back of his neck.
“Right! To new beginnings, I think.”
“Not that that’s
“Well, it’s a damn sight better than that fishing hut in Greenland, anyway.” He turns back, traces the curve of Harry’s smile with a gentle finger.
turned out to be the subject of their first disagreement. They discussed it just outside the bathroom – Harry with his hands on his hips, topless and barefoot, Draco in only his pants, balancing on one leg to remove his second sock. Draco – joints aching from the night spent lying awkwardly across his sofa – was desperate for a long soak in the bath. Harry seemed surprisingly hesitant at the idea. He fancied a shower instead, he said, going on to lasciviously describe shower-related activities that had Draco shivering with want. But in the end, Draco’s powers of persuasion won out, and so they ended up in the tub after all, Harry’s back resting against Draco’s chest, fingers dancing up and down Draco’s legs in a way that implied that getting clean had never really been on the agenda at all.

helped, Draco was fast realising that there weren’t enough hours in the day for him to complete all his orders. Although he’d played it as a positive to Pansy, the realisation he was going to have to hire additional staff was actually most unwelcome. He couldn’t even imagine what kind of person would respond to his advert. Of course, he couldn’t work with anyone he knew – anyone who might suspect him. But after less than a year and with only a Diploma to his name, he was in no position to take on a proper apprentice.
starting to get hurt now. He was hurting Lee, he was hurting Neville, and now Theo today – well, that had almost crossed a line that made Draco very uncomfortable.
He was going to die, here, alone in his bed, and be consumed by this awful, disgusting monster. He was getting dizzy, the lack of oxygen to his brain making his thoughts fuzzy. At least it would be over soon. Would his mother know what had happened? Would she miss him? Would Harry?
It was Potter, of course. Draco let out a loud groan. How was it
As Draco knelt on the tiles, pressing his head against the porcelain, tears welled up behind his eyes. He felt incredibly sick: sick, and dizzy, and
“And how can I prove that I don’t?”
“Look, at least you know it’s being looked after, yeah?”
“Here. You let me have that one earlier, after all.” He reached over and grasped Malfoy’s hand – his palm against Malfoy’s knuckles – and tugged it down between them and over the Snitch. Malfoy’s eyes widened in surprise as Harry pressed against his fingers, curling them around the tiny golden ball. Through Malfoy’s hand beneath his, he felt the moment that the catch registered, that familiar little sigh as the wings relaxed and the Snitch stopped struggling.
Later on, though, somewhere around the time they’d wound up in front of the deep red rope cordoning off his own childhood bedroom, noisy tourists jostling them from behind and cameras clicking over their shoulders, Draco had lapsed into a thoughtful silence. It had lasted ever since, as Harry had led them out and around the gardens, a peaceful breeze across their faces and the sun setting slowly in the distance.
“I don’t know,” said Harry, slowly, trying to lighten the mood, “you’re always swanning around like a bloody Lord at my manor.” It worked, and he grinned, ducking to avoid Draco’s mock-offended shove.
As Draco was getting into bed, he heard the tapping of an owl at the window. The message was brief.
“You’re withdrawing from the

do, Harry,” says Draco, squeezing his shoulders, forcing him to focus. “
Neville also continued to frequent the shop, sometimes bringing his girlfriend, Hannah, along. The first time she’d walked in, Draco had suddenly recalled that they’d taken Charms together, and managed to come up with an anecdote about a time that Ernie Macmillan had accidentally hit her with a Shrinking Charm. His description of Flitwick trying to force Hannah into a jam jar so she could be taken to the infirmary had all three of them in stitches, and from then on, as with Ron, it felt as though they’d always been firm friends. Hannah was a trainee Healer, and she and Draco could quite easily spend an hour discussing the pros and cons of different potions with Neville grumbling good-naturedly all the while.
“Well, at times, I suppose,” Draco conceded. “But―”

Just before Neville stepped into the Floo that afternoon, struggling to carry one of the larger textbooks from Draco’s extensive collection, he turned and extended his hand. Draco took it.
After Malfoy had finished gloating, he relented, finally, prodding his wand into Harry’s bum with even greater relish. Harry couldn’t help the – possibly quite indecent – moan that escaped as a delicious numbness spread once more down his aching thighs.
“Come on, Draco. I don’t think it works like that. And even if it does, you know Neville will sort it somehow. He loves a project.”
Draco turned around and rested his shoulder blades against the cool tile, body arching forward as he fucked into his fist harder and faster, until he felt his orgasm rushing up to consume him. Behind his closed eyelids, he saw Potter as he appeared in the

“Fuck you, Draco,” he whispered, voice low and dangerous. “
Draco wasn’t a fan of her delivery, but he could hardly argue with the accuracy. “Well – that’s about the measure of it, yes.”
“Oh my god, Malfoy,” he heard himself whimper –
The evening continued in much the same fashion, with guest after guest vying for Draco’s attention. Fortunately for him, the music was so loud that no one could hear clearly enough to have an in-depth conversation, so he could get by very well with nods, smiles and a bit of small talk. He’d never felt so in demand before, so admired. It surpassed even his heyday as the most popular student in Slytherin house, and it was completely intoxicating.

“Neville and Hannah, they―”
” He rolled it up and shoved it back in his pocket, winking at Draco as he rose to his feet, gesturing to the door behind them. “So, I wondered if you fancied it. You know, you can be the wealthy nobleman, I’ll be the poor stable boy...”
“It’s not the horse,” said Draco as they both stared up at the enormous chalk figure before them. His chin was raised, eyes narrowed, defying Harry to disagree.
“It’s neither of those though, not really. I’ve been thinking about it, and I owe you the truth. I’m afraid you’re not going to like it.”
Eventually their laughter died down. Harry looked over.
“You’re not wrong,” said Harry, slowly, with a wry smile. “In fact... well, to be honest, he asks me every month, Malfoy. Every fucking month, without fail. He wanted me to come straight in at Senior Auror, can you imagine? Right out of school – right out of the war.”
“It’s… it’s, er, Daphne Greengrass. I guess you remember her? I… well, it’s not been long, but I really like her. Always have.” He fiddled with the edge of the duvet nervously. “Honestly, I have no idea what came over me, but, er, it’d be great if you didn’t say anything to anyone.”
“Oh yeah,” said Neville, looking stumped, as Potter shrugged. “Yeah, you’d definitely better ask Hermione.”
going to get enough of this. “Anyway,” Draco prompted, rolling his hips languidly against Harry’s palm between kisses, “as much as I’m enjoying receiving the laziest hand job of all time on your dusty stairs, didn’t you say there was a bedroom somewhere?”
“Look,” said Pansy, “you already know he thinks you’re fit. He’s a man – trust me, that’s half the battle won. If I was in your shoes, I’d just flash him a bit of cleavage and he’d be handcuffed to the headboard before you could even say ‘chuck me that harness, would you?’”
Draco’s insides twisted unpleasantly. Harry’s words might have been teasing, but his voice held a note of scorn. Despite rehearsing this moment countless times, Draco somehow found himself speechless and gaping like an idiot. Merlin, how he missed the

At the sound of his name, Malfoy’s head snapped up towards them. Hermione could still see a smear of congealed blood below his lower lip, but his grey eyes were clear and sharp as ever.

To his relief, her face immediately relaxed and smoothed over, and she walked right past him into the lab without another word. Draco glanced out at the shop floor, noticing with a jolt that she’d neatly tidied and reorganised all the spilt packets of herbs.
“Anyway, I’d best be off. Got to get to Gringotts, then back to work by three. You coming or staying Neville?”
Kingsley had indeed brought a trophy, of sorts. It was about three inches tall and bore an uncanny resemblance to the glass owl paperweight which usually graced the Ministry reception desk directly opposite the Floos. Nevertheless, Malfoy put on his most charming smile for the cameras – and resolutely ignored its persistent hoots – as he lifted it high into the air. He made quite a sight – soaked through, and plastered from head to toe in mud – and as the journalists crowded around, his knackered teammates attempted to lift him over their heads. Ron kicked the ground sulkily.
Harry’s voice came from close behind. “It’s worn off, hasn’t it?”
Harry scanned the pitch, practised eyes quickly honing in on a familiar shock of white-blond hair. He moved quickly through the restless crowds, making his way over to where Malfoy was standing, back to Harry. He was leaning forwards to speak to one of the spectators – a young woman, who was twirling her hair around her finger and blushing coyly as Malfoy chattered away. As Harry came up behind him, he flicked his head to one side – shaking that damn fringe out of his eyes as usual, Harry knew.
“Well, what?” asked Pansy, reaching to flip over another page in her wedding catalogue.
“Suit yourself.” Harry pulled Draco’s plate towards him, settling in for round two. Draco delicately averted his eyes.
Panic suddenly rose up inside Draco, as he tried to lift his arms and then his legs in turn, completely without success. He attempted to move his head, but it was trapped, twisted to the side at an uncomfortable angle. The lights in the flat were flickering now, flashing in time with Draco’s heartbeat, which was echoing loudly and erratically in his ears. He tried to make sense of the situation. Someone must have cursed him. Was it Crowson again? Or his aunt? The Dark Lord, even? Who on earth could have gotten into his flat?
“Mmm… something like that,” said Draco, levitating the scattered clothes back up onto the chair. Willing himself to stay calm, he raised a careful eyebrow. “How can I help you, Harry?”
“Give it up, Harry. C’mon, move, let me spell it open.” Long fingers press insistently against the small of Harry’s back, a bony chin poking over his shoulder. None of it exactly helps matters, and Harry wants to do this the proper way.

“So…?” Draco prompted. At Potter’s blank look, he sighed. “What is it? What was so important that you had to drag me down here, piss off my neighbours and drip rainwater all over my shop floor like some bloody Crup?”
Draco hastened to clarify. It was a fucking awful idea, but frankly it was all he had. If he said nothing, Pansy would end up drawing her own conclusions, which could only be worse. “No, I’m going to cast a spell and then

Thomas relaxed, his face opening up into a smile. “Something like that. But hey, I heard about your dad. Must have been hard for you too.”
Draco let out a sigh of relief. “Go on, fuck off then, Potter,” he said with a smile.
Dean Thomas came to the shop to see Draco several times in the weeks following the Quidditch incident. He was terribly apologetic, bringing genuine-sounding messages of sympathy from most of their teammates. London was just on the cusp of summer, and with Draco’s arm and ribs fully healed, he found himself all the more desperate to get out on the broom. So when, inevitably, Thomas begged him to come back and play – even bringing Draco a list of the Magical Transportation team-members to reassure him that none of them were waiting to hex him in the back – Draco quickly agreed to return as their Seeker. After all, what was the point in living at all if he was forced to forgo everything that he wanted? Why should he stop doing something that gave him so much joy?
“I can’t – how the

Draco pulled the stopper out with his teeth and downed the contents. After a brief abortive attempt to remove his boots one-handed he gave up, Vanishing them along with his socks.

Draco pats the floor next to them. “Well, we’ve got sun now.”
Draco’s mouth twists unpleasantly. “Bit late now, isn’t it? The whole world thinks you’re fucking Katie Bell.”
“Nearly seventeen, although I don’t see why that matters.”
Draco took Harry’s hand once more, apprehension dissipating instantaneously, and let himself be led back up to the flat.
“What the fuck is wrong with you? Been hanging out with Longbottom and your lovely new Gryffindor friends a bit much, have you? All their sanctimonious shit rubbing off on you?”
“You should leave.” Smoke curls past Draco’s lips, his bloodshot eyes flickering warily over Potter. “This place, it’s not for –”
The blood rushed to Draco’s groin at the unmistakable meaning behind Harry’s words. “I… I will,” he got out, voice small.
He disappeared in a roar of green. Draco waited, impatiently, for the flames to die down, before, not thirty seconds later, he followed.
, have you, Looongbottom? What a surpriiiise.”
“Why do you think?”
“Look, I also wanted to apologise for Max. He’s a total prick, and he’s hated me ever since I started as an Auror. Before that, he used to head up all the prisoner interrogations―”
“We’ve got time though,” Harry said, running his mouth wickedly up and down the side of Draco’s shaft, forcing another desperate whine past his lips. “You can finish like this now and… no? That’s what you want, is it? All right then,” he said, amused, kneeling back up to straddle Draco. And then, “In the interests of expediency―” Harry muttered, reaching behind himself. He whispered a quick spell, flinching slightly as it took effect.
After all,
He unfolded his long legs and jumped down from the bed, moving quickly towards the en suite. With a dawning sense of horror, Draco remembered the vials of

business.
Draco uncorked the vial and lifted it to his lips. Slowly, he tipped his head forward and swallowed.
“Hannah?”
Draco’s out there, somehow, halfway up the steps, lounging against the wrought iron railings. Harry rocks back on his heels with a gasp – he can’t help it – instantly embarrassed to be caught here, of all places, for no good reason he can come up with. He wonders, stupidly, if by finally allowing himself to think of Draco after so long he’d accidently managed to summon him somehow. But no – Draco’s surprised too, although only someone who knew him as well as Harry would recognise the signs; the way his back straightens, the flare of his nostrils, the tightening of his grip around the rail. He looks brilliant, Harry thinks automatically, hating himself a little more.
“You didn’t dance.”

As soon as that realisation dawned on him, he felt suddenly repulsed. He tried to push Theo off.

-induced disaster might have passed its nadir. Before he knew it, they were decorating the shop front for Halloween, the business losses were finally slowing, and he hadn’t received a Howler in weeks. He was able to breathe easier again. Harry’s words about getting
“It’s not.” The force and certainty behind his statement surprised even Draco. “I want more than that. I want… I guess I... I care about him too, you know. Not that it matters, anyway. He doesn’t want anything more,” said Draco, quickly. “I told you what happened at Neville’s.”
Suddenly, a scream. It was one of the Holyhead chasers, with Ellis for the Cannons right in her slipstream, yelling urgently to her teammate as she raced overhead, forcing the front row spectators to duck and weave. Both Bludgers hit the wooden boards to the side, their loud cracks making both Harry and Draco jump backwards. A gust of wind followed the speeding players, and they reached out to steady each other as the ground below their feet wobbled. The moment was gone. Draco laughed, shakily, hand grasping Harry’s robe at the waist, feeling solid flesh below soft fabric.
“I remember,” Draco interrupted quickly. “What you said back then, that is. Most of it, I think. Isn’t that what Lee was telling you?” Exposed by his impatience, Draco stared down at his feet.
Draco unlocked the door, waving Harry through and casting a quick
Draco snorted. “Where do I start? You might not have noticed, Neville, but I have a slight Death Eater problem. Even leaving that aside, I’ll only just have finished my Diploma, and no one’s going to take me seriously without a UK apprenticeship. I don’t have any ingredients…” Okay, that one wasn’t entirely true, but Draco definitely wasn’t planning to mention his storeroom “…I’d need established relationships with suppliers…”

“I know, I know. You’re busy with work, you already said. And I know you’re probably just being nice, trying to let me down gently. But I like you, Malfoy. I want to get to know you better. Sometimes I think you like me too, but… well, other times…”
at the paper cup, but only managed to replace the sickly stuff with insipid lemon-flavoured water.
“I… I don’t know, exactly,” Draco admitted. “There are some gaps. Details, mostly. My Mind Healer… she helps me… it’s hard to recall specifics…”
“Well, yes… and no. Draco, you were on potions for
If he had expected gratitude, he’d have been disappointed.
“You alright there, mate?”
“Oh, Potter, don’t feel sorry for me, it all worked out for the best. God, I loved New York,” he said with a wink, “and she loved me back. Plus, y’know, the country is fucking massive – and they’ve got some really weird shit going on, let me tell you – so you’re sent all over the place. I basically ended up visiting almost every state, on MACUSA’s dime. There’s none of that academic ivory tower ‘ooh, Department of Mysteries’ bullshit you get round here, and way less red tape. Most of us were out in the field, actually getting to
“Well – and don’t laugh – I rather wondered whether you had considered opening your own apothecary. I mean, the timing couldn’t really be better…”
“Okay, fine!” said Harry, amused, waving his hand in complex arcing motions around the room. There was a deafening sucking noise, followed by a sharp pop as the sink and the toilet jerked themselves forwards, leaving a trail of brick dust, broken tiles and plaster behind them as they wobbled across the room to swap places.
Draco nodded, helplessly, as Harry continued his ministrations, rinsing and wringing out the flannel again, and moving to wash under Draco’s arms and over his chest. Draco could only stare down at Harry’s hand as the stroking motions, the cooling water, and the rough feeling of the flannel overwhelmed his senses.
photograph. Those days, it took Draco considerable force of will not to stop whatever he was doing and drag Potter up to his flat.
Draco inclined his head in acknowledgement. There was silence for a few seconds, both of them lost in thought, before Thomas looked at him quizzically.

at his hands – and on further thought, at the entire table.

hadn’t he asked Thomas who’d be there? Why hadn’t he said he’d come along to watch, tested the waters?
Draco nodded. He’d set boundaries early on in his use, and for a long time he’d stuck to them, even when
“All right,” said Draco, uneasily. He finished pouring the tea, placing the mug in front of Harry and sitting down at the table beside him. Harry took a few careful sips, relaxing into his seat, while Draco sat straight as a rod, heart beating in his throat, insides shrivelling under the weight of his anxiety. Just as he began to feel like he couldn’t take another second, Harry’s voice rang out in the darkness.
, he’d noticed that her hair was slightly greyer around the temples, the creases beside her eyes a fraction deeper. Those delicate hands had turned papery and weather-beaten, her nails jagged and bitten to the quick. Recently, there had been more changes – her shoulders were a little hunched, her movements much slower, and her breaths seemed laboured, and as though they sometimes caught her by surprise. All in all, she now appeared much older than her forty-seven years – and there was something else, too – a sense of desperation, as though a thin veil of defeat now covered her, head to toe.
“Granger. You knew me at school. Now, I like to think I’ve changed a bit, but I can assure you I’m still not one for random acts of altruism. Leonie’s been here two weeks, she already knows where I keep everything, she’s great on the counter, filling Owl Orders for customers and she’s brewing third year level Potions. She’ll be better than Potter within the month, I’m telling you.”
Harry sighed. “It’s complicated, Draco.”
He didn’t move.
They grab brooms from the Ministry store – nothing fancy of course, but that hardly matters – ditch their robes and head off, swooping high over London, chasing away hours of tedium and painful, biting tension, dipping in and out of cotton-wool clouds to wash the grime off their faces. They’re not racing, exactly, but Draco keeps up a relentless pace, occasionally glancing back at Harry with a grin before speeding up, and it’s not too far but Harry’s muscles are aching by the time he sees the sea.
. You want me, do you? You want me
“Nice day for flying, wouldn’t you say, Potter?”
Draco heard Harry’s sharp inhale then, felt his body tremble for a second against Draco’s chest, and he wrapped his arms back around Harry, holding him close. Harry trailed his hand in the water, mumbling a warming charm under his breath.
“I don’t normally do things that way, not if I can help it. Draws far too much attention. Although, of course, my wandless magic has improved loads, all the time I was spending around you…”
Potter just stood there, folded his arms and narrowed his eyes, waves of fury emanating from him so strongly that Draco felt physically repelled by the force of his magic.
“Thanks.”
“I know,” said Draco softly. “I have too. By the way,” he said, gaining confidence, “I don’t remember if I mentioned it before, but you look incredible in that uniform. Really.”
Oblivious to the hidden depth behind Lee’s words, Pansy laughed and stood up, grabbing a tumbler from the side. She used a neat charm which caused ice cubes to form in the bottom and gestured around the kitchen. “Hey, Draco I’m sorry for what I said about your flat when I was here before. I think it’s actually kind of charming.”
He was working so hard to mitigate
Draco tried, with only partial success, to string together a response. “No, it’s not that. It’s, uh, great. Yes! Walking home. Would be great.”
Potter cleared his throat. “Look, er, I don’t have long today, but I thought I’d pop in to say thanks again, and to ask… well, I don’t really know how to say this. Maybe it’s… well, anyway. I just wondered if you wanted to get dinner with me some time, that’s all.”

? You sure about that, are you?”
To Draco’s knowledge, Harry hadn’t visited since that one horrendous night. Sometimes, in those moments where Draco’s mind hovered somewhere between asleep and awake, he thought he could hear Harry’s voice – but by the time he opened his eyes, he was alone. And that was what caused Draco the most pain – he’d lost all the memories of his time with Harry, and he knew that they might never get the opportunity to start afresh.
Draco smiled, slow and lazy, skirting around the side of the counter. “Please do. I like a challenge. But anyway, Potter, did you just pop by to hex me, or…? Tell me, to what do I owe the… pleasure?”
After his trial, after the horror of the Veritaserum, he’d been so overwhelmed with shame and embarrassment that he’d briefly planned to write letters of apology to those he’d wronged over the years. Katie Bell, he’d thought. Loony Lovegood and Dean Thomas. Vince’s mother. Granger. Various Weasleys. Maybe even Potter, if Draco could work up to it.
“I thought he wanted to shag me! Repeatedly, maybe! I don’t know, I don’t remember, do I?! I didn’t get that far! All I knew is that I missed him. That I wanted to spend time with him.” Thoughtfully. “That being around him made me feel…” His voice faltered, a sickening realisation slowly dawning.
Harry sat back, looking thoughtful. But Draco had no time to waste. His mouth felt dry, his words beginning to slur together. He needed an answer, and he needed it
The sound of his name jolted Draco to his senses.

Pansy sat back, disappointed. Suddenly she jerked upright, as though she’d been kicked under the table. Before Draco could react, she looked towards Lee, who shot Draco a wicked grin before bringing her fist to her mouth while simultaneously poking her tongue into her cheek – the universal sign for a blow job. Pansy laughed delightedly.
But then, he thought, the irony not lost on him for a second, he’d never really been lucky after all, had he?

together’ and that
“God, I hope this is the right flat,” Harry gets out, laughing. He pushes his trousers to his thighs just in time for young Draco to swallow him down, to wipe the grin right off his face. Harry makes a guttural noise and tips his head back, eyes closed, and it’s Pavlovian, by now, the way your cock is already fattening in your hand as you edge closer to them. Your eyes are fixed on Harry: the long line of his throat, the way his tongue darts out to wet his lips, the curve of his back as he arches forwards, completely undone. His moans grow louder as your younger self reaches behind him, greedy hands squeezing that firm arse in time with each impatient thrust. Everything seemed so urgent back then, the both of you always chasing each other’s pleasure: almost as though you
As Draco eased himself down the stairs, he could hear the sounds of Lee opening up shop. Her tuneless humming, the squeaking of her trainers across the wooden floor, the scrape of the cauldron as she set up the day’s brews – all felt familiar, yet different, somehow clearer than before, as if he’d been listening behind glass and someone had finally opened a window. This eerie sense of jamais vu persisted as he wandered, trancelike, into his shop; for although he’d last seen it mere weeks ago, he’d hardly ever entered it sober. It was smaller than Draco remembered – the ceiling lower, the walls shabbier. The floors were in need of a good polish, and something had burned a huge hole across the dark wood of the counter. Most concerning of all, the shelves were sparsely stocked, with the few remaining jars and vials spread out to conceal obvious gaps.
“You must be Mr Black. I’m delighted to meet you, sir.” The agent beams at Draco, pumps his hand up and down effusively. Harry frowns. He certainly didn’t get that treatment when he arrived. He glances down at his own scruffy trainers, his hoodie, his old jeans – frayed at the bottom with a tiny hole at the knee. Of course, Draco’s wearing what looks like some fucking bespoke-tailored suit. Harry might have laughed, had he still been capable of it.
Harry grabbed a handful of Floo powder, expression playful. “You know, I did wonder how you didn’t choke.”
to trust anyone. He hardly ever goes out, and you must have noticed he still hangs out with the same few friends he always has. With everyone he meets, he’s always Harry Potter. Everyone he tries to date is
Much of the time was spent discussing the plants, which were flourishing despite the neglect of the past few years. Draco made note of several which would be useful for potions ingredients and encouraged his mother when she expressed an interest in taking up gardening again. Altogether, the morning passed quite pleasantly, and for the first time in months, they ate lunch together outside. When he was done, Draco stared up at the clear blue skies, and was surprised to find his thoughts turning to Quidditch. He spent the afternoon racing around the estate on his old Nimbus, chasing a practice Snitch until the sky grew dark around him. He returned to the house, his body aching, completely exhilarated.
, for fuck’s…” He shook his head, eyes taking on a wicked gleam as he looked up at Draco through his lashes. “Never mind him. I suppose I should be flattered that you’ve been keeping up with the

away from him in disgust. It smashed instantly into the wall, at the exact same spot where Draco had held Harry – had slowly taken him apart – earlier that evening. A lifetime ago. Thick liquid gold dripped down to join the fragments of glass which glittered dangerously atop Draco’s torn dress robes.
Harry smiled. “Oh Merlin, yes. I hate these things. Ron will make my excuses. Reluctantly perhaps, but he’ll make them.”
As the final few minutes ticked down, a small crowd began to gather again, cheering and shouting, and the mood amongst the players finally improved – their exhilaration tinged with an edge of exhausted hysteria. Harry himself was half-relieved and half-dismayed, wondering what would happen next as he inched his broomstick a little closer towards Malfoy’s.

“Right.” Draco looks up at the balcony. “So what did you think? It seemed…”
“Can I help you?”
have known better. Robards had a history of picking the worst possible times to discuss these charity things, slipping them in ever-so-casually between other topics and couched in so much euphemism that they teetered on the cusp of outright lying. The ‘themed photoshoot’ he’d mentioned on that dragon poacher stakeout, for example? Naked calendar. ‘Dinner and a show tomorrow?’ dropped in while they were queuing for the Floos (‘it’ll be warm, so don’t wear too many layers’, he’d added, ominously) – a sodding bachelor auction. And then there was the Friday morning that Harry had opened the door to the briefing room, only to be met by an uncomfortably appraising look and the bizarre question ‘you’re what, a 44-inch chest?’ One nervous nod, and before Harry could back out, he’d found himself strutting up and down on a makeshift runway in the Atrium, wearing an Occamy scale waistcoat and black trousers so painfully tight that they cut off the circulation to his balls.
“I did. Just―” he walked over to Draco’s bed, setting his mug on the bedside table. “Budge up, would you?”
Harry leant back, looking at Draco appraisingly. “Well, I don’t know about the other fools in there, but―”
“Yeah.”
, Draco. I’ll ride you, how about that? You’ll hardly even have to move, I swear.”
“Not at all,” said Draco, recovering himself finally. He dropped Potter’s hand and took a step back. “The shop’s pretty much ready. Just got the last couple of bits to sort out, then I’m going to get an early night before the big day.”
“…the flat’s
Potter smiled, vaguely. “Maybe once. But right now, it’s all you.” He stepped past Draco, coming to rest against the pillar that Draco had just vacated. Draco’s body instinctively turned to follow him. “Every witch and wizard in there wants you.”
Draco let his fingers run lightly under the braided rope pinned to the front of Harry’s chest, pulling him closer with the lightest of tugs. Harry’s expression softened, a brilliant smile spreading across his face as he pressed forward, crowding Draco back against the arm of a sofa, tilting his head. Draco closed his eyes, breathing shallow, impatiently awaiting the press of soft lips against his own. The air around him was still, though, the scratch of the dust sheet against his robes loud in the silence.
“Oh, I have a feeling everything’s going to work out just fine. Now are we dancing, or what?”
Draco was gobsmacked. He didn’t think he’d ever had a conversation with a Squib before; in his parents’ eyes, they’d been creatures to be pitied and hidden away. Of course, Draco could see clearly that a lot of what his parents had said was ignorant tripe, but he couldn’t believe that even now, any Squib would choose to work for a Malfoy.

“As a matter of fact, I didn’t. Like I said before, I know what everyone thinks of me. Believe me, I heard it loud and clear back when I was on house arrest. Who’s to say that the minute I landed in Mungo’s I wouldn’t get hexed by some poor sod who lost someone in the war and wants to take it out on me? Besides,” said Draco, gentling his voice, “you know I have all the stuff to deal with it here.”
have any friendships to write about.
Things had been at their best here, that much was for sure. No matter what else they’d disagreed on, the sex was incredible; had been from that first heated embrace. No-one since had ever compared, at least for Harry. But it was more than that. If Harry was honest, he still missed the nights; the way Draco would purposefully wind himself around him, fitting their bodies together so soft and easy. Harry had slept alone since childhood, and he’d always been restless. No matter whether in a cupboard, a dorm, or a tent, he’d always woken sweaty and nauseous from nightmare after nightmare. The gentle pressure of Draco’s head against his chest and the way he tucked his feet beneath Harry’s ankles had changed all that; had made things
… was rushing ever closer. As he slid into bed one Tuesday night, just over two weeks sober, he resolved to speak to Hannah about it all, the very next day.
