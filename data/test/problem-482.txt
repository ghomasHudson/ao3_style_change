spell. She wondered, for a moment, how Harry and Draco had resolved that little piece of their shared history. She’d never thought to ask before. In truth, she had forgotten about it.
Harry’s eyes drifted to Draco’ mouth, then found their way back to Draco’s gaze. “Me too,” he said, and kissed him.
Harry and Draco bid goodbye to Narcissa and the Weasleys and followed their friends back up to the dorms, hand in hand.
“You held your own just fine,” Ron told him. “It’s not your fault Ginny is better with the Quaffle than all of us.”
“Then you are a better man than my father. Which, of course, we already knew. It’s not the highest bar to clear, after all.”
She gave a small sigh. “Almost normal at the moment, actually,” she said. “The dizziness and the cramping are gone completely. And I was having some occasional sharp pain in my arms and legs, but that hasn’t shown up for a few days now.”
We're back to Vesper, which means we're going to get a little more insight into the Aurors and how they solve cases. I debated back and forth with myself for a while about whether or not the Auror stuff would be interesting for readers, or if it's just me. Feedback on that is welcome, as it could have a bearing on how I approach future chapters!
Not that she didn’t get along with those of the male persuasion. In fact, she usually had more in common with men than women, for the most part. But these were alpha male types, constantly preening and posturing and trying to outdo each other for how macho they could be. Dempsey had chosen to show his supposed “manliness” by giving Vesper a demeaning nickname within five minutes of meeting her. She could only assume that his thinking behind this was that by picking the “weakest” trainee among the group to torment, he would be less likely to have to endure any retaliation.
Harry felt a small pang of guilt in his chest. “I can’t take a lot of the credit,” he admitted sheepishly. “It’s mostly Andromeda. Being at Hogwarts makes it hard to be there for him most of the time.”
part), wanted to jump back into bed and have his way with Harry now. But his thoughts turned to the boy downstairs, waiting for them, and he knew in truth he wouldn’t change the way things were now. They had a whole day ahead of them, to eat, clean, play at the park, talk, relax, and be together. And he wouldn’t want it any other way.
Clint laughed. “I’m sure that’s true.” He met Kyle’s eyes for a moment, and Kyle rolled his eyes, smiling. In truth, he was rather enjoying the attention.
. But a group thing… it might be a step in the right direction. Anyway, because I thought you’d made plans, I felt like I could ask her. And I would feel really bad to take it back now.”
“Scorpius!” Hugo called from his seat as they grew nearer. Scorpius grinned in acknowledgement and made his way over, pausing only when he saw that Samara didn’t seem to be following. He turned back to her.
Off to their left they caught a glimpse of diners enjoying a simple and elegant meal in what looked like a Japanese tea house, and then farther up on the right a large party was watching their servers removing an entire roasted pig from a pit that had been dug into the sandy ground.
Harry groaned, unable to help himself, and Draco smirked above him. “Yeah, you like it hard, too, don’t you?”
Harry let them go at it, glad that Ron had turned his attention to Hermione, and that she was willing to assume the mantle of defending Draco, at least for a little while. He turned, looking around the room. Some people were staring at him open-mouthed, or glaring at him with open dislike. He mentally shrugged at that, not particularly caring. The only person he really cared about was sitting at the far end of the Slytherin table, looking at the article with critical gray eyes, his mouth twisted in thought.
Mac looked down at the half-written report with a knowing smile. “Why don’t we finish that up together?”
Yet still he said nothing, stopping in front of Harry’s desk while Harry stared up at him, wondering what he was going to do. To his surprise, Malfoy placed his palms on the desk and bowed his head, hiding his face from Harry’s view. It was almost as though he was trying to muster the wherewithal to say something, and Harry decided it best not to interrupt the process.
“Sir, I’m just trying to understand why you’re so against me teaching him this jinx. He doesn’t have to practice it with you, but at least he’ll be able to practice it on his own. What can it hurt?”
“Barely,” Ron said, sounding amused again. “And you know how? I went up to Gryffindor tower, surrounded my bed in the strongest silencing charm I could muster, and had the best wank of my life, thinking about you.”
“Anyway, yeah, him and Harry were out together, looking to pull,” Paul said to David. “Looking fit, too, from what I remember.”
“All right, but the kitchen only. I think Teddy should have to help with his toys tomorrow morning once he’s up.”
He nodded and set to work. “Well, I’m sorry they won’t be here. I know they were looking forward to it.”
“It is depending on the will of our masters, sir,” she replied. “Some masters, they is breeding us, and we is not having a choice of who we is being with.” She made a face of mild disgust, but that quickly faded. “But at Hogwarts we is being free to be making our own choices, sir. And sometimes it is being forever, and sometimes it is being only a short time.”
“Not at all,” he replied. “It would be quite a pain to lug these back and forth from Hogwarts. I just have to lock them up, to be on the safe side, until my return.”
“I thought we’d call Teddy and then have dinner here,” Draco said, getting Harry’s attention back. “And then I thought it might be fun to go out.”
“That he was,” Draco said with a sigh. “And we were growing up in complicated times. It’s not like that at Hogwarts anymore, you know. Inter-house unity is strongly encouraged. There is still some rivalry, especially between Gryffindor and Slytherin,” he added, thinking of the incident with Roger Paine that Harry was still dealing with, “but it’s not encouraged by the staff. Exactly the opposite, in fact.”
Draco lips found Harry’s mouth and gave him a soft peck. “I’ll just get to know your charming family a little better, shall I?”
Draco stepped back out into Diagon Alley, wondering if there was anywhere else he wanted to go. He didn’t need to do other shopping, but a leisurely trip to Flourish & Blotts was always a welcome diversion. Or perhaps he could visit Fortescue’s for an ice cream, indulge a little. He wasn’t meeting up with Kyle until that evening, so he had an entire afternoon to spend as he wished.
Luckily it seemed to work, as by the time Harry declared dinner ready Teddy was all danced out and came willingly. They all enjoyed their meal as they listened to Teddy talk about his day, especially his friends. Teddy was very focused on other people, what they were doing, what they were feeling, more than he was on himself. Vesper found that very impressive. She wondered if it was an inherent trait or if he learned it from being raised by Andromeda and Harry, two very generous, selfless people.
Harry mustered the energy to grab his wand, undoing Draco’s bindings, cleaning them up, and removing some of the wards on the bedroom in case Teddy needed them in the middle of the night. He then settled against Draco again, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and burying his nose in the back of Draco’s neck. He could already feel himself slipping into sleep, but he made himself focus long enough to say one more thing, because it seemed important.
fall in love with him. After a marriage of convenience like what you had before… This would be worse now, wouldn’t it? More difficult?”
Though the pronoun made her statement a little ambiguous, Hermione thought she could guess which “he” Ginny was referring to. She glanced at Harry again, who had taken to the air with Teddy once more and seemed to be explaining a new trick to him. Then she turned back to Ginny to find her smiling softly.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, Harry sipping his tea and contemplating what he was going to do with these realizations.
Blaise was quiet, and Vesper resisted the urge to ask him what he was thinking. Instead she closed her eyes, working on summoning the wherewithal to get herself out of bed.
“Oh, all right,” said Hannah. “The issue at hand, at the moment anyway, is that he’s not going to be around for the holidays. Usually we have Christmas with my father and then spend some time with his parents at the hospital. But apparently he’s not going to be able to make it to any of it. He says it’s because it’s his first year teaching at Hogwarts and there’s sort of an unspoken rule amongst the staff that the newer members stay behind to supervise the students who remained for the winter holidays. Neville says he feels… obligated to volunteer.”
“Not with your fit body pressed against me, that’s for sure. I mean, really…” His hand moved across Harry’s chest, teasing a nipple through the soft fabric of his t-shirt before descending lower, down his stomach and towards the edge of his trousers once again. “How am I supposed to resist this?”
That didn’t surprise Harry at all. “Finesse” was not a word he had ever heard in association with himself.
“Well good on you,” said Harry. “Ron won’t be up for another three hours or so, so this is prime, distraction-free work time, I guess.”
Draco sipped on his black tea and thought that over. “I can only hope,” he said, after a while. “It’s not as if I can do anything about it now.”
“Fuck,” Harry bit out, and did just that, spurting onto Draco’s arse and lower back with rope after rope of cum. “Gods,” he groaned, his eyes shutting as he reveled in his climax.
Harry held up his plate and took a bite of chicken, to demonstrate. Draco leaned over, watching his son as he considered the situation. Finally, Scorpius put the piece of chicken in his mouth and then reached for a piece of pasta from his bowl. Both men let out a relieved breath, their eyes meeting over Scorpius’ head.
Draco considered all that Harry had just shared. “I honestly think my experience would be similar to yours, if I tried it. So I don’t think I particularly want to.” Maybe he was imagining it, but he thought he felt Harry’s body relax a bit next to him when he said that. “I only brought it up because…” He huffed a nervous laugh. “I had this… thought, and it sort of…”
Pansy had stocked it with all his favorites, everything he could possibly need to emerge smelling normal again. He wasn’t surprised, really, just silently grateful as he grabbed the exfoliating body scrub and set to work. He felt no need to impress Pansy, of course, but her approval would most certainly mean that Harry would approve as well, and that
“She’s gifted,” Draco said lightly, pretending he didn’t understand his father’s disapproval. “Reminds me a bit of Hermione Granger, to tell you the truth. Though Miss McNeal doesn’t get in nearly as much trouble as Granger did. Of course, there’s also not a war on and secret Death Eater plots to thwart.”
Ron huffed in annoyance, but didn’t reply. Harry turned to look at Ginny, who hadn’t said anything all morning. Her eyes were fixed on her plate, where she was shuffling her eggs around with her fork.
, he thought, letting his broom slow as he reached the other end of the pitch. Why didn’t he do this anymore? When had he decided that flying was merely frivolous fun, and not something that was an inherent part of him, something he needed?
So what was it about Malfoy? It couldn’t just be that he was pretty. Lots of men were pretty. It couldn’t just be his competence, charm, and biting wit. He’d known other men with those things too.
“Are you sure?” the witch asked, looking from Draco to Harry. “I know you haven’t had much time with Teddy just the two of you today. I don’t want to intrude.”
Angelina scoffed. “That’s not true. He came in every week with a bunch of questions about charms he had desperately generated as an excuse to have conversations with you.”
Draco didn’t say anything else for a few minutes, and Harry chose to occupy himself with continued packing. He took a sheet out from one of his cabinets and started working on covering his foe glass, wondering, for about the millionth time, why he still kept the thing. It took up a lot of space, and Harry didn’t really have any foes to speak of anymore.
“Well anyway,” McNeal said. “I have to be off to finish packing. But I hope you’ll take a look at what I’ve written up and see what you think. We can owl over the summer, can’t we?”
He was on the late shift for patrol that night, though, which meant he was expected at dinner and to start walking the corridors promptly at eight. Curfew wasn’t until ten o’clock, but students were certainly capable of getting up to unauthorized activities before then. It was not uncommon for young couples, especially those in inter-house relationships, to try and find a quiet alcove after dinner to get to know each other better.
Harry decided it wasn’t quite the right moment to remind Ron that Harry was also dating a Slytherin, and most definitely not the right time to confess that he had known about Blaise’s feelings for a while.
Tired of the scrutiny, Harry stood. “I’ll see you in Defense, then, shall I?” he said to Ron and Hermione, then kissed the top of Ginny’s head before exiting the Great Hall without looking back.
But he felt a hand on his wrist, and a gentle tug, and he turned back to see that Draco was staring at him with an expression he had never seen before. He had seen both affection and lust paint Draco’s features in the past, but this was something different. His face was serious, intensely so, and his gray eyes were pure heat, tracing over every feature of Harry’s face, lingering especially over the mouth. Harry licked his lips unconsciously. “Draco?”
“I was never really allowed to get acquainted with him,” Andromeda said. “Lucius never approved of Ted and I, and he kept both Draco and Narcissa from me. It broke my heart, especially when Narcissa put up no resistance.”
And then Draco closed the gap. It was such a small space, but it made all the difference. The light pressure of those soft lips had Harry opening himself to Draco without hesitation, and Draco delved slowly in, taking his time. Harry massaged his tongue against Draco’s, and let a small but needy moan escape him.
“Yes,” Hermione said with a sigh. “He will recover fully, Thank Merlin. But he has a few hard months ahead of him, and even longer than that before he can return to the field. Robards may have been looking for the most convenient solution in the moment, but the repercussions… I guess that will be my first question to him. I want to know if he thinks it was worth it, risking Ron like that.”
It was so unfair. Evan always took their side, never seeming willing to see it from Kyle’s perspective. Like he cared more about them than he did about Kyle. He was so angry he didn’t have words. He didn’t want to look at Evan, hear him, touch him, anything. He wanted Evan to just go away and leave him alone.
Talk turned to the issue of a flower girl, and whether Victoire was really old enough to handle the responsibility. Teddy insisted that she was, and that he would watch over her and help her on the day, which made both Draco and Harry give in and agree.
Harry smiled softly. That was what he had told Teddy last time they’d had this conversation. “Exactly. He’s saving lives.”
She smiled a disbelieving smile. “You said you weren’t going to get involved. And yet here you are, being the go-between.”
Harry repressed a sigh. He felt as if he was walking on constantly shaking ground, unable to get a firm conversational footing. He wondered if this was just how Narcissa was and couldn’t help it, or if she was doing it on purpose. He remembered Andromeda’s advice and steeled himself to answer. “Before the war I thought I wanted to be an Auror, and I was taking the classes for it. But now that the war is over I’ve changed my mind.”
“That’s it. I swear, that script looks just like my potions master’s, the one I apprentice for. I had asked him for some information the last time I was with him, and he said he would send me what he could find out. I thought it was him, writing to me about it. That’s why I opened it without checking it for curses.”
Clint returned from the restroom then, to see that his spot had been taken. He seemed unfazed, taking a seat next to a passed out Hannah instead.
Also, if you happen to like my writing and have read my fic "A Secondary Education," I hope you will consider voting for it in the 2019 Drarry Awards! It's been nominated in the Best Angst and Best Smut categories. It would mean a lot to me, and to other authors that you love, if you let us know you like us! Voting closes Feb 10. Also, a BIG thank you to my nominator(s), whoever you are, for getting me in two categories this year!! I feel so honored and so grateful!
“I asked him why do people get married, and he said that they get married because they love each other and want to be together for all of their life. And
Draco spared a glance at the grandfather clock. “Twenty, maybe thirty minutes, before my mother has Pipsy fetch us for hors d’oeuvres and aperitifs.”
The man in question finally stirred next to him and rolled over to face Draco. He nuzzled into the pillow and made the sweet little chirruping noises of a person half awake. Draco smiled, watching him, happiness curling in his belly once more.
“I totally understand,” Hermione said. “I know these first few months are rough. When does she go in for the next round of treatment?”
They stared at each other warmly for a moment before Clint returned his attention to his glass, spinning it against the table with his fingers. “Can I ask…?” he began.
“Of course, but I want to be sure. Just give it a little. We’ll go down to the lounge, watch some telly, and snuggle up and grope each other. It’ll be like.. extended foreplay.”
“It’s this mystery lover, isn’t it?” said Pansy quietly. “You’re not over her yet. That’s why you’re so resistant.”
They wound up on the kitchen table together afterward, intertwined and naked. They were silent for a while before Draco spoke.
Awkward. It was awkward. Draco had no idea what to say. He was rather counting on Kyle to set the tone. But so far Kyle hadn’t said much of anything save for his initial words of greeting and a bit of small talk about how his current Ministry project was progressing. Now they were sitting in silence, and Draco kept wondering if he should wait for the other man to speak or if he should attempt to take some initiative.
Harry released Draco again, licking his lips as he looked into the blond’s dilated pupils. He climbed off the bed and removed his pajama bottoms and underwear, then climbed back on, his cock already in his lubed up fist. “Look how ready I am for you,” he said as he stroked himself, making Draco pant. “Are you ready for me?”
Draco thought a moment. “What about Bill and Fleur? I know it seems like a lot, pawning Teddy off on them when they already have the girls, but Teddy and Victoire get along so well. I bet he’d have fun there.”
Again, it seemed he had surprised her. “How considerate,” she said. She took the gift and unwrapped it, while Draco and Harry watched in silence. She weighed the black velvet box in her palm for a moment, before opening the top to reveal what was inside.
“Things got a bit strange with Pansy and me, when she had her son, especially after… you know… Astoria…”
“But, seeing as you’re late, and seeing as you two probably have some talking to do before you get back to work, it might be best if you wait.”
of all people, like they really knew each other, like they were just two normal students, like Harry didn’t know that Malfoy liked wanking in the shower with Harry’s name on his lips.
But now he had this, the note. Why Potter had chosen this method of communication, rather than simply finding him in person, Draco could only guess at. But he couldn’t help but feel that the implications were promising. Surely Potter wouldn’t have invited Draco to his quarters if he were going to outright reject him. And if they were going to be alone, in a locked room, together, with very little chance of being disturbed, Draco had to believe that perhaps talking might not be all that they would do.
for a few minutes. That really messes with your head, you know. But you don’t see me stumbling around, making a mess of my life.” He was thinking of Ron, in the early days, struggling to make sense of Fred’s death through an excessive intake of firewhiskey. He nearly ruined his relationship with Hermione over it, and it took the trip to Australia to recover her parents for him to finally find an escape that would keep him sober. And there were plenty of other war survivors who still turned to the bottle for solace.
After a tasty and enjoyable dinner, Draco liked the idea of watching something on Harry’s fancy new television, so they moved to the lounge and took a look at Harry’s DVD collection. Like with his CDs, he didn’t have all that many, but what he did have, he loved.
“Nice,” Harry said under his breath. He forced himself to meet her eyes again. “It’s not that I think you’re doing it on purpose. But you are doing it. And I don’t understand why. It’s you who wants to play Quidditch professionally. How do you think a loss like the one we’re in for is going to look when the scouts come sniffing in the spring?”
Harry looked slightly confused but did as he was told, immediately pushing his arse against Draco’s groin once he was lying on his side, facing away from Draco. The blond chuckled at his impatience and took a moment to lube up his own cock. Then he positioned himself, took hold of Harry around the waist, and slowly pressed forward.
Draco didn’t know anything, really, except that Vesper had been pregnant (she would have had to be, to be able to receive the prescription in the first place), and that she was pregnant no longer. Everything else was guesswork, and he had no one to speculate about it with. So he had just locked the secret up tight and tried not to think about it.
“All right,” he said, making sure he fully understood. Knowledge helped him, it seemed. “So you’ll stretch me, then put it inside me, and then activate it.”
“Sounds good,” Harry said, finally finding his voice, though it sounded weak and rough to his own ears.
“Mm, me too,” said Draco, biting back a groan as Harry nipped at his skin, sending jolts of lust through him.
“You said Molly is always dealing with crises regarding her children and grandchildren, so she doesn’t have time to help you. Since when are you
No, what was really worrying was what the article had to say about Sirius’ relationship with Harry, how they had been reunited after Harry’s third year, how he had tragically only had a couple of years with his pseudo-father figure before the man’s untimely death at the hand of Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry felt his hackles rise. He didn’t have to look at the author’s byline to know who had written the article.
He was so awkward and gangly and artless, and yet it only served to make him rather charming to be with. It helped that he had a nice, wide smile, graceful hands, and those brilliant blue eyes. But it was his personality, the sense that Draco could say pretty much anything to him and Kyle would probably be able to come back with something even more embarrassing about himself, that made Draco feel like the bloke had stumbled into his life at just the right moment.
She didn’t answer right away, and she didn’t look at him. Her face was suddenly careful and closed, and Harry stopped chewing, a small stone of dread dropping into his stomach. “What is it? What are you reading?”
Dursley cast Draco a furtive glance but didn’t comment on his presence, returning his gaze to Harry. “It’s Dad. He’s ill.”
Draco bit his lip and closed his eyes again. “Yes,” he managed, after a few seconds, as Harry began scissoring his fingers, stretching Draco just that little bit more that he needed.
But Astoria merely smiled at him and nodded. “It’s hard to believe. He was so small when he came out, remember?”
“I took it off for a time, after my divorce. I couldn’t stand to look at it, mostly because I felt like I had failed my family name and I didn’t deserve to wear it.” He looked at his son with a surprising amount of amusement in his eyes. “That was how I thought of things back then. It’s not how I think now. But at the time, it felt wrong to wear it. And then, eventually, I stopped thinking about it much. I forgot about the ring, in a way, for a time. It lived in a drawer in my study here at the manor, while I was off at Hogwarts, and I didn’t think much about it at all. That’s what I needed at the time, I think. It was a burden I didn’t want to bear, and so I let it go.”
When he arrived home by floo he was immediately hit with a wonderfully savory aroma, and his stomach grumbled. He made his way towards the kitchen, knowing what he would find there.
But coming to Hogwarts had changed everything. His days were full to the brim with class, studying, and captaining, and it was easy to get wrapped up inside the bubble of the Hogwarts grounds and forget about the outside world. He realized he hadn’t seen his godson in almost two months. Something really did need to be done about that, and he returned Andromeda’s letter speedily.
“Push with both hands to be most effective with that,” Kemp said from the outskirts of the floor, where he was observing the lesson.
“Yes, I imagine trying to live up to the dead ex-boyfriend would be a challenge,” Malfoy replied with a snort.
In truth, some part of him was relieved to be able to avoid a night out with his colleagues yet again. He still hadn’t fully figured out how he fit with them yet.
“Like I said, not a big deal, strictly platonic. But it felt weird, not telling you about it. I didn’t want it to seem like some big secret.”
Reluctantly, with her mouth set in a grim line, the woman lifted her quill and scratched out Teddy’s name.
He felt his cheeks go red, and he looked away a moment. “I see,” he said, unable to help a smile. “The tables have turned now, haven’t they?”
He and Draco remained entwined most of the evening, observing the goings-on around them and occasionally making quiet and snarky commentary on it to make each other laugh.
to Draco, and somehow believed he didn’t, even when Draco had explicitly told him otherwise. The only thing Draco could surmise was that Harry wanted to matter in a way that was beyond just a good friend helping another friend through a difficult time. He wanted to continue to matter. As more than a friend, if his other words were anything to go by.
Harry and Draco teamed up to keep Teddy occupied, so his thoughts weren’t lingering on Andromeda all day. During lunch they asked him all about school: his teachers, his friends, his favorite activities, and afterward they went to the park, where Teddy climbed on the jungle gym, swung on the swings, and made friends with a little Muggle boy who was there with his mum. Draco was nervous at first that Teddy would accidentally show off some of his Metamorphmagus abilities to his new friend, but luckily Teddy had good control over his powers by that point and understood that he had to keep them in check when he was with non-magic people. Still, both he and Harry kept a close eye on the boys as they played together, since Teddy’s control wasn’t perfect and his hair did have a tendency to turn unnatural colors to match his mood when he was particularly upset.
Harry chuckled, and Hermione smiled down at him. “You’re right,” he said. “As usual. This is why I keep you around, you know.”
It had been easier than either of them expected. Harry very smugly hinted that it was because being with him made Draco so happy that a Patronus was easy. And he had been doubly smug when Draco managed a real, full-fledged corporeal one and they saw that its form had taken on that of a stag. Just like Harry’s.
“I guess you’ve been shut out of your room temporarily,” said Harry. “I can send them a Patronus, tell Ron to clear out so you can go to bed.”
“It’s not luck so much as that I haven’t been on that many real dates. When you’re trying to hide your sexuality from your father, you pretty much have to hide it from the world, which made having any kind of real relationship difficult. My fourth and fifth year I mostly just fooled around in secret, nothing serious. And sixth year I had other things to worry about, as you well know.”
Still she said nothing. Ron, curious, leaned over and read along with her, and it only took a second for his face to register horror and disbelief, his eyes wide and his mouth gaping.
“That this doesn’t stay secret. I know it has so far. People know we’re friends but… they don’t know the rest. And I don’t want to hide it, if we’re really going to do this.”
As an added bonus, the entire Hufflepuff team was so distracted by Harry’s dive that it allowed Ginny to score again easily while no one was paying attention.
They finished their lunch with more pleasant small talk, until eventually it was time for Vesper to get ready for the afternoon portion of the day. She changed in the women’s locker room into her usual workout clothes: tight fitting lycra pants, a sports bra, and a matching top. It was what she always wore in the days of her training as a professional duelist, because it allowed her coach to see every aspect of her form and make corrections. Yes, in competitions she did duel in robes, like everyone else, but she didn’t rest on her laurels, and the way such clothing could hide poor technique. She strove for perfection, always.
“Why not?” Harry shrugged again, his a mouth a half-smile. “It’s what I love. Besides, I think of it more as taking on some apprentices rather than students. They already know a lot, and will be able to do a lot of their work on their own or together. I’ll be more of a supervisor.” He rubbed a hand across Draco’s back. “Come on, I’ll show you to your room.”
“It all sounds very sweet, actually,” she said. “Do you think you were falling for each other even then?”
He was expecting some quip from Draco about his own brilliance, followed perhaps by a taunt about Harry’s feeble and pedestrian mind, so he was surprised when Draco’s cheeks turned pink, and he said nothing.
Teddy took Harry’s hand as they walked out the door, and Harry smiled down at him, glad, at least, that Teddy seemed quite happy living with him and Draco.
He led Harry out of the bedroom and into another part of the suite, a small sitting room with comfy looking chairs by a fireplace and shelves of books lining the walls. Draco walked to a corner of the room, where something stood large and somewhat out of place, hidden under a blue sheet. Without further ado, Draco pulled the sheet off to reveal a silver birdcage.
What an odd conversation. Kyle wasn’t sure what to make of it. He realized he didn’t have much else to do but Apparate home as well, and so he took out his wand, readying himself to do just that.
. Now that he didn’t have Draco’s presence to distract him, he found himself burning with curiosity as to what Draco had brought him.
“I would, but I’m expected in my quarters for lunch. A weekend tradition, you know, when neither of us is on duty.”
He glanced at the grandfather clock against the wall of his sitting room and realized he’d whiled away the whole hour ruminating on his misfortune. It was time to join the rest of the staff, and, while he wasn’t in the most social of moods, he found himself welcoming the diversion.
Harry considered that. “And you think Hermione won’t be able to tell us off because we will be using an elf that was already… employed?”
Declan returned then, two whiskeys in hand. He put one in front of her and kept one for himself, though his beer was only halfway finished.
“So how many is a ‘fair few,’ if you don’t mind me asking?” Potter was loose-lipped at the moment, and Draco didn’t see the harm in prying further, so long as he was careful.
“I’d like to see you try, Potter,” Malfoy said with a smirk, clearly pleased that he had managed to taunt Harry relentlessly and yet still make him laugh. “My Occlumency shields are ironclad.”
He swallowed the resentment, though, chasing it with a sip of cider, knowing it wasn’t Clint’s fault he lived such a charmed life, pun intended. He knew Lindsey wanted him to make an effort, that Angelina wanted him to make an effort, and that spurred him to start a conversation with the wizard sitting next to him.
“Well, would you like some company?” Harry was saying now, still watching him from the bed. “I could stand to do some work as well, if you’re going to anyway. We could have the elves bring us a big breakfast, sit by the fire-“
kind of experience, then. “I’m sorry. Everything took longer than I expected. But I’m here now, and we have two full hours for me to get ready, so-“
Her heart fluttered a little at the invitation before remembering that she’d already made plans. “I’d love to, but I can’t tonight,” she said, genuinely sorry. “I’m having dinner with Harry and his godson.”
“I think we should enjoy the party a bit longer, though. Don’t you want to see what Vesper does next?”
“We are spending time together,” Max said, taking his hand. “I’m really glad you came tonight. I have more fun with you around.”
“I’m gonna fucking come!” Draco told him as he felt his pleasure peaking. “I’m gonna come from you tongue-fucking me, Harry! Oh, Gods!” He was amazed, and incredulous, and so completely turned on by the idea that his announcement alone was enough to send him over the edge. He came right into the sheets, gripping them tight with his hands while he rode out his pleasure. He moaned and moaned into the pillow as his cock’s pulsing crested before starting to wane.
Malfoy’s mask cracked, finally, though it was only with derision. “I have an entire Malfoy fortune with which to buy myself firewhiskey, Potter, thank you very much.”
years were in their common room, cramming all the last-minute work they could. The following few days of class were jam-packed with project due dates, since they were now at the end of November and heading into the final weeks before exams. Stress was at an all-time high, knowing that even when all the projects were complete, they still had loads of studying to do to finish out the term.
Draco was surprised to see something like guilt cross Harry’s face for a moment. “It was Teddy. He was ill all last night.”
Draco made to reach for his wand before realizing his wand hand was covered in spunk. “Clean us up, would you?” he said to the Gryffindor. “My wand’s right there.”
He had a community. And whatever happened, he would not be left to deal with the aftermath of this alone.
Draco shrugged. “Slytherins are pragmatic, and that has its upsides in a lot of cases. You should try it sometime.”
“And another thing, while I’m at it,” said Harry. “I don’t know where all this ‘not deserving’ bollocks is coming from, but I want you to cut it out. I’m so happy with you it’s ridiculous. I never felt like this with Ginny. I never felt nearly as free to be myself or as sure that I will be supported in my decisions. When something goes wrong, I come to you for help, don’t you see that? I rely on you. You do so much for me. I’m just trying to do the same for you. I’m trying to be worthy of you.”
wrong,” Hermione said, sitting up straighter on the bed. “He’s not some sports-obsessed moron, which you should know well by now considering he usually beats
Dempsey started and turned his head away, to show he was listening. Vesper smirked to herself as she followed Ron around to the other side of the cluster of cubicles.
Harry sighed. He didn’t know why he had believed coming down to the common room would make him feel any better. He had wanted to be alone. He just needed that, sometimes. But he still felt the unpleasant clawing of nausea in his stomach, and thinking about the dream wasn’t making it any better.
had been wanting to bring up for a few weeks now. Harry was willing to put himself out there, even when he was nervous. So Draco could too.
for Merlin’s sake. “It felt like some kind of joke the universe was playing on me, like it was taunting me almost. But maybe that’s not it at all. Maybe it was the sign I needed in order to know I should take the next step and come out to my closest friends.”
With Hannah temporarily down for the count, the other four made conversation. With Kyle in the mix, Clint suggested they talk about something other than Quidditch, and conversation went back in the direction of work, at least for a little while. Angelina, noticing most of their glasses were empty, called for another round, which Clint insisted he buy despite many protests.
“Yeah, well, you’ve been going through a crisis for a hell of a long time, it seems to me. It seems to me like you
“Well, we should have drinks soon, anyway,” said Draco. “It’s been forever. You can tell me and Pans all about it then.”
Hermione laughed too, even while her insides gave a light throb of pleasure. "And what happens then?" she asked flirtatiously, a hand slipping up under his robes. "I undress for you? You take me right here on the desk? I come crying your name, calling you Auror Weasley?"
“You were found in possession of a number of Class A and B illegal artifacts, which all told will give you quite the hefty prison sentence, especially if you made the artifacts yourself with intent to distribute.” The Auror cocked his head. “But that doesn't seem...
Harry turned to Draco with a question in his eyes, and Draco nodded, indicating he would follow Harry’s lead on this. Harry turned towards the door and Draco went behind him, throwing a small wave in the direction of Dursley and his wife.
So, assuming Draco wouldn’t mind, Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, and smiled when he felt Draco tilt towards him. They sat, and smiled, and breathed, and played with each other’s fingers as the morning waned.
She nodded, just the smallest jerk of a movement, and added another few drops of Asphodel to the cauldron.
She snickered a little at the thought. “I suppose that would be inappropriate, wouldn’t it? Especially with children present.”
“Every spare minute I have, I’ll use to come check on you,” he promised. Andromeda would be in the hospital for a few days after the treatment was finished, simply because it was so hard on the body. Draco would have ample opportunity to see her again before his forty-eight hour shift was over.
. I don’t know how to explain it. It was all rather passive aggressive and, frankly, difficult to be around. They just didn’t handle conflict well, between them. And there was a surprising amount of conflict. Little things, mind you. I think it just came down to that they got on each other’s nerves a lot and they didn’t know how to handle it.”
“It’s ok, Harry, it’s natural,” Draco said, his voice calming a bit now that he could see that Harry wasn’t hurt or upset. “It’s just the adrenalin from the foreplay, and the endorphins of your orgasm, probably.”
“Mm,” Molly agreed. “She will be a wonderful daughter.” She looked at Harry, her gaze suddenly piercing, and Harry swallowed. “Of course, I would feel that way about her whether she married my son or not.”
“Yes,” Harry said, pointing at Ron’s chest. “Yes, exactly. She would never say that. Would you ever tell her that you didn’t want her to be a solicitor? Would you ever tell her not to devote her life to creature rights, even when you think she’s going a bit overboard?”
Malfoy didn’t really answer, only hummed and stared at Harry as though he had suddenly become infinitely more interesting. And maybe, to Malfoy, he had. Harry very much doubted consensual polyamory was all that common in the pureblood world, and Harry’s lifestyle probably seemed very novel to him.
But that hadn’t happened. It probably helped that about six months after their breakup Kyle had discovered that one of his coworkers was harboring a quite substantial, secret affection for him, and had been since Kyle started at the Ministry. They fell madly in love after only one date, according to Lindsey, and were now happily married. And so any animosity either Bergeron sibling had once felt towards Draco was utterly gone, much to his delight.
“If you could describe for me what you saw, felt, and heard at the moment of your magical outburst?”
Harry nodded. “And don’t think I haven’t grasped the irony of that,” he said, his tone suddenly dry.
He heard Narcissa chuckle to herself softly and gave her a sheepish smile. She smiled back, hooking her arm through his.
“Yes,” the other wizard replied. “That’s it. If the sample turns white, your diagnosis was correct.”
Draco nodded. “I’ve got some research and reading to do, and I want it all to be done before I pick up Teddy from school. That way I’ll have the whole afternoon and evening to spend with him.” He yawned, finally making himself sit up.
He sat in the usual armchair in front of Kemp’s desk and thought about what he wanted to say. He’d had no idea what to say when he’d first arrived, and after Vesper’s revelations to him he felt even more at a loss. An apology was certainly in order, but then… what? What did he want to have happen?
“All right, you two, that’s enough lovey dovey for one evening,” Dean said. “More than I have the stomach for, at any rate.”
“Teddy’s happy when we’re all together,” Draco argued. Harry regularly showed his appreciation for the way Draco was making more of an effort around the house, but he still had a tendency to try to handle things himself if Draco let him. He was learning he had to be pushy sometimes, to get Harry to accept support. “And I should get up anyway. I have a full day ahead of me.”
Draco lurked in the shadows, waiting for them to pass. He knew what he was seeing now. This was the end of Potter’s date. The man with him was likely Callum Foster, the Ravenclaw Potter had mentioned. It appeared that Potter was taking Foster to his quarters, which would of course be near Gryffindor tower, as Potter was their head of house. He was taking his date home for sex.
“Or break the statute of secrecy,” Kyle said, closing the distance between them even more so he could keep his voice low, and so his breath could brush along Clint’s ear. Definitely that too.
“Oh, just hush up and eat your pizza,” he replied with a roll of his eyes. “You’ve given me a lot to think about, and now I have to think about it.”
It was nice to be alone with only a sleeping Ron for a little while. Draco stopped by to let her know that he had spoken to Harry, who would be coming by just as soon as he got Teddy fed and settled in at the Burrow. Hermione thanked him, and he left soon after. She was alone again to wait for Ron to awaken.
“Because it’s an interesting theory, and it may be the beginning of something for you to work with in the long run. You’re not NEWT level yet, but you will be, and this is just the sort of topic that could work well as a research thesis. I thought you might want the opportunity to get ahead.”
“All right, well… that’s good.” Draco wasn’t sure what to say. “I just don’t want to hurt her feelings. I think Pansy had it in mind that we would hit it off immediately and she set up some unfair expectations. It’s exactly why I hate set-ups, actually.”
“Yes, it’s unfortunate,” Ron said, which Vesper thought might be the understatement of the year. “The problem is, really, that you and Dempsey have quite similar profiles.”
He knew, in the back of his mind, that there was a down side to this approach. If this continued, if he and Kyle began to develop much deeper feelings for each other, Kyle was eventually going to have to hear some unpleasant tales. How would he truly know Draco otherwise? Draco wasn’t particularly looking forward to telling some of them. Would Kyle see him differently, after all was said and done? Draco’s past didn’t exactly paint him in the most flattering light.
“He’s a little social butterfly, isn’t he?” Audrey said as it was her turn and she bounced the baby on her knee.
“Oh, and what would that be?” Draco asked, his hands drifting unconsciously to Harry’s perfect arse.
“I told you I was open to it,” the brunet said. “But there’s no point if he won’t.... If he can’t apologize, if he can’t even admit-“ Harry stopped himself, swallowing, gripping Draco’s hand hard. “There’s no point, Dudley.”
“Well, congratulations, Healer Malfoy,” Lorenz said. “I had read something about it in the papers, of course, but I hadn’t realized today was the day.”
When they arrived at the correct door Draco could already hear voices and music on the other side. Harry didn’t bother knocking, but rather strode on in. They were immediately greeted with a welcoming cheer, many faces turning to them at once.
Draco licked his lips and tried to look demure, mostly because he knew how much Harry liked it. “And what would that be, then, Professor?”
On the surface, Draco Malfoy’s presence in the castle didn’t appear to change things very much for Harry. The blond had integrated quite seamlessly into the fabric of the staff and by all accounts the students were responding well to him. They’d had no major blow-ups or really any unpleasant interactions to speak of. When Harry didn’t give the issue too much thought, it was rather easy to ignore the potential strangeness of it, the weight of the history that hung over them.
“So the mystery lover was always supposed to be temporary, which is why you ended it. But this… relationship – whatever it is – with Kyle… that’s different?”
“Fine. I went by the afterschool program today. It’s been the first time in a while that I’ve seen it firsthand, but it’s doing well. Andrea, one of the other people in my department, has been keeping a good eye on it for me.”
She looked at him sadly, but there was resignation in her face now, rather than desperation. Draco felt himself relax.
She closed her eyes again. This was his power. This was the thing that got her every time. There were countless things about him that made him wonderful, of course, but
His father laughed harder. “You’re twisting my words a bit, you know. But maybe you have the essentials. As I said, there are no guarantees, and that includes that the possibility of you – or her – messing it up. For all we know, either Aria or Emilia could be the woman you choose to build a life with, if that’s the path you choose at all. On the other hand, it may very well be that your future partner is someone you haven’t even met yet, or someone you know but have never considered. You have plenty of life left to live, Scorp, and plenty more to see. From the way you’ve been reading that Scamander book, and all the books before, it seems pretty clear that you have some adventuring to do once you leave Hogwarts.”
“I don’t suppose you’ve spoken to her at all,” Tracey said. “Not that I believe you would, of course.”
The Auror Corps conference room had to be temporarily magically expanded to accommodate everyone inside, Vesper noticed idly as she and McInerney entered and looked around for seats. There had to be at least four different whole departments squeezing into one room. She looked around, seeing a couple of Aurors she recognized from the Murder Squad and another from Organized Crime. Her stomach flipped when she spotted Declan and his partner, a stocky, no-nonsense looking witch with piercing dark eyes. So, the Unlicensed Magic department was involved as well. Vesper swallowed, glad her ex hadn’t spotted her yet.
They wandered over to Ron and George, who sat looking relaxed with bottles of butterbeer in their hands and chatting with a pretty brunette that Harry had to assume was Percy’s mysterious but apparently quite likeable girlfriend.
He caught Ginny’s grimace before she smothered it. He figured she wouldn’t like that last bit, but he felt the need to say it, nonetheless. She needed to understand why he needed some distance from her.
He started to undress, aware that he still smelled like sex, like Harry. Flashes of the previous night inundated him a moment: the sounds they made, the taste of Harry’s mouth, the way Harry felt inside him-
Harry nodded. Hermione did have a way of getting caught up in her work and ignoring everything else.
In truth, he felt very little elation in the victory, because he knew that it had not been his doing. In many ways, he felt the win was in spite of his efforts. He entered the team locker room feeling dejected and confused. He had lost matches before, but it was always due to unforeseen circumstances or bad luck. Harry had come away from a match disappointed before, but never feeling like he had let his team down. He had even gotten over the incident with the Dementors in his third year, knowing it wasn't really his fault (winning the cup that year had helped with his guilt, too). This was different, though. He couldn’t help but feel that he had let his team down, as both their captain and their Seeker.
“I’ve noticed nothing,” Lorenz said, and Draco could tell by her clipped tone that she felt her competence was being questioned.
Unfortunately for him, Emilia was waiting for him in the common room. She wasn’t quite quick enough, though, and he managed to brush her off with a rushed, “Family dinner, gotta go,” as he reached the portrait hole.
He could let himself resent this boy, if he really wanted to. But it didn’t make any sense to. It wasn’t Octavian’s fault he was Blaise’s son instead of Draco’s. It was stupid, even cruel, to resent a child. He could save all of his resentment for his ex-wife and his ex-best friend.
“I’m not looking to go professional, at this point,” said Dean. “But Ginny will get a spot no problem.”
It was clear that it would be too much of a risk to return to Guensler’s house and try to finish the interview. She had left very abruptly, and there was a good chance that Patronus gave her away. She, Hermione, wasn’t named in the message, but Ron was. There was a chance that Guensler, if he understood enough about the war and its most famous participants, might put two and two together and realize she wasn’t who she said she was.
He had been expecting to have to fill out applications, just like anyone else. But, if he was honest with himself, he knew that wherever he applied was likely to take him on without even reading his application. Was there really any point in getting worked up over that inequity? It seemed more useful for him to simply move on, and choose something that would be a worthwhile endeavor.
“I’d like to do one more big dive,” he said. It had always been his favorite move. “And then we can take your mum up on her offer of tea.”
“Yes,” Harry confirmed, staring at the table. “It ended… he ended it, the morning after Jack’s party.”
Harry ran a hand across Draco’s back and gave him a warm smile. He liked how dispassionately Draco was able to talk about his past mistakes. It showed just how thoroughly he had moved on.
“Of course,” Draco replied, indignant, and had to remember to lower his voice again. “No one captures the heart of Harry bloody Potter and lets that slip away.”
The morning passed by quickly for Harry at work, and he was just thinking about having some lunch when there was a knock on his office door. He looked up to see his boss, Naomi, peeking around it.
“Good work. Keep practicing that at home,” he said. “Let me show you something else. This is one of the best spells I have in my defensive arsenal. It’s called the Impediment Jinx.”
An ecstatic tidal wave of noise erupted from the other end of the pitch, but Harry took a moment to search the faces in front of him, looking for one in particular. And then he spotted him, seated between Pansy and Blaise, who were both gazing up at him indifferently. Draco, however, was shaking his head, his face an amusing picture of pride and disbelief. Harry gave him a wink, and the Slytherin had to fight a smile.
Harry rolled over onto his back and gave Draco a wry smirk. “I was wondering when you were going to finally ask me that. I figured it was only a matter of time.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Are you doing that on purpose to wind me up, or can you just not help yourself?”
She seemed to be walking fine, so the boys let her go. Rico then followed, taking Hannah with him to the floo. Clint and Kyle were left standing in the pub, ready to go.
“It's fine, Ves,” Draco replied warmly. “You must know I'm already very familiar with the concept of confidentiality. And paperwork.”
She frowned. “Honestly, I’m not sure. It all depends on what sort of shape this task force ends up taking, and what you would like to do for the cause. We would sort of make up the position as we went along, I would think, playing to your strengths. You’d be helping me create the task force, so I imagine there would be many discussions not unlike this one where we would decide what our mission statement is and such. And it would probably involve meetings with our solicitors, politicians, legislators, people with influence, our clients, that sort of thing. Whatever you like, really.”
He sighed. “No, of course not. If you want to gorge yourself on wine and cake and nothing else, have at it. It’s your day.”
She broke the kiss. “The charm,” she reminded him softly. They had always relied on contraceptive charms to prevent pregnancy, since Vesper hated the way the potion made her feel and hadn’t been on it in years.
Warning! Explicit content ahead! So it begins... Although, to be honest, the smut in this chapter makes me laugh more than it makes me hot and bothered. Or maybe both? Can smut do that? I don't know, you tell me. You gave me such wonderful comments last chapter and I'd love to know what you think of this one too :)
“Ron doesn’t seem all that concerned with the wedding details,” she said instead. “But, to be honest, now that I have my dress and the venue, I find it hard to care about them, either. I think we mostly just wish we had all of that out of the way.”
He couldn’t blame him, not really. Yet somehow he managed to. Because here Draco was, alone and overworked, knowing he had done this to himself. He’d love to find some stress relief, and Harry would be the perfect person to relieve it, in fact. Except for the part where if Draco allowed himself to be with Harry again, he was only dooming himself to disappointment and heartbreak. And he was hardly going to do that, now was he?
Clint gave his usual shrug, his mouth lifting in a small, shy smile. “Frees me from all that paperwork, anyway. It was getting old.”
“What about when it’s for the benefit of others, not just yourself?” he asked. Clint looked at him, and, though he didn’t answer, Kyle could tell he was absorbing that. “I’d offer to just file the complaint on your behalf, but I think it would be stronger coming from you. Since you aren’t someone who complains. Ever. They’ll know it’s serious. And Rosemary could expedite the paperwork for you. You know she’d help you with anything you asked her to.”
“Let me,” Kyle said, correctly guessing the question. An elegant, long-fingered hand reached toward Draco’s groin.
Finally, mercifully, he and Molly reached the end, and he tore his eyes from Draco to give her a kiss on the cheek and the squeeze of a shoulder in silent thanks. She met his eyes briefly before turning away and finding her seat amongst the other redheads in the front row.
“It belonged to the Black family for centuries. They were dark wizards, for the most part, I think,” Harry said. “Is that why the house has… malevolent magic?”
“I’m not keeping it a secret,” said Harry impatiently. “We agreed to start telling people tomorrow. So I will tell you tomorrow. I promise.” In truth, Harry didn’t really think Draco would care if he told his friends now, or told anyone else, for that matter. But he just wasn’t ready for what Ron’s reaction would be. The thought of one more night of peace was too good to pass up.
“You don’t have the kind of pull you think you have, Malfoy,” the woman said. “After what your family has done, what your father-“
So many chances, and he missed all of them. And now it was likely too late. He hadn’t heard a word from Draco, and he was hardly surprised. The blond seemed quite happy with the cute brunet – American, from the sound of it. He clearly liked this Kyle person, and why shouldn’t he? What, really, did Harry have to offer, other than his love, something Draco could clearly get elsewhere?
He watched the two of them all the way up to the castle, hoping to see more signs of something unfolding between them, but not getting much more than some mild flirtation. They parted ways in the entrance hall with no more than a wave and a “See you tomorrow,” and Ginny headed in the direction of the Gryffindor dormitories while Dean headed towards the 8
They were joined a few minutes later by another friend of the couple’s, who pulled up his own chair and starting talking to the two women. It put Kyle out of the conversation a little, but he didn’t really mind. He was looking around for Max, wondering what was taking so long.
“Yes, thank you,” she said, taking that as a good sign. If he was going to serve tea, he was prepared for a full conversation, and might not try to rush her out the door.
“And the two of us have got to get going, actually.” He turned to Teddy. “Time to get your shoes and jacket on, Ted. And don’t forget your lunch.”
Harry turned to look at him. “You didn’t deny me anything. I was the one who chose to be a prat and refuse her invitation, just to be… Just because I couldn’t bear the thought of being there, with you, and not being…
“I don’t know what to do about Ginny,” Harry admitted. “I don’t know if I should try to talk to her or-“
“You wore them,” he noted, pleasure filling him. He didn’t have to look at Draco’s other wrist to know he would find the dragon there.
She had eventually decided it was time to go home. Blaise was kind enough to offer her his room, since it was so late, claiming he could easily find another empty room from one of his friends, since there were so many couples paired off and sleeping in each other’s beds. Vesper had appreciated the gesture but declined, not wanting to put anyone out and truly wanting to go home to Aurelian’s and the familiarity of her room there.
Hermione seemed to pick up on the nervous edge in his voice. “I felt that way too when I started my internship. But it only took a couple of weeks to get settled into it. I bet it will be the same for you.”
“Well… we learned the detection spells, but my NEWT professor also talked about ways to… intuitively detect dark magic, if that makes sense. There’s an energy around a dark artifact, kind of, and you can feel it if you’re paying attention.”
“I do. I think it’s exactly the sort of thing someone says when they care a great deal, but they’re hurt and trying to save face.”
“So some… some witch or wizard got upset and performed some magic and turned my parents brains to mush? I’ve never heard of such a thing.”
A Fire-head Curse. Vesper screamed, in spite of herself. She’d never experienced this firsthand before, but it
“True,” said Harry with a laugh. “I have baked a few disasters in my day. But I guess in the end, so long as I haven’t burned the kitchen down, I figure that at least I tried. And hopefully I learned something. Enough to do better next time, at any rate.”
“It’s all right, Harry. It’s like I said, I’m not exactly complaining. I just didn’t want… you know, to take advantage of you, on this day of all days.”
“Yes, I do,” said Harry, not wanting to beat around the bush. “It really worries me, Kingsley, I’ll be honest. I don’t think a lot of people realize how dangerous a law like that could be. And what’s next, then, if it passes? Are we going to start digging into pureblood rituals and customs, too, telling them what they can and cannot do?”
Kyle turned away, before he felt any more ridiculously awkward or found Clint any more ridiculously cute. He was well aware that as he made his way down the hallway he was feeling more and more elated, a grin breaking over his face that no one could see and an increasingly weird desire to dance his way back to his office.
He could sense Harry’s surprise more than see it. It was too dark to really make out the features of Harry’s face.
He shook his head at her joke, grinning as if in spite of himself. “So,” he said, “what did you think of the rundown they gave us on the departments today? Anything strike your fancy?”
Draco found himself thinking fondly of his godfather, Severus Snape, throughout that first week, remembering how the late Potions Master used to refer to most of the students (who weren’t Slytherin, or the occasional Ravenclaw) as “dunderheads” and complain about their incompetence and basic lack of critical thinking skills.
“Don’t forget we promised Teddy we’d floo call him at four,” Harry reminded his partner. It was the deal they’d made with Teddy, since it was the first time he’d be away for a whole weekend. Harry was glad, as he found himself wondering how Teddy was getting on at Toby’s house, and if his godson was feeling homesick at all.
Draco turned to Hannah and smiled. She was sipping her cocktail – something pink and fruity – through a straw while looking at him with twinkling eyes.
He wasn’t sure, because her expression softened even more and she stood up from her desk, came over to him, and wrapped her arms around his waist in a hug. She was considerably shorter than him, and her head came to naturally rest against his chest.
Draco thought about that while Harry took a few measured breaths. “I think maybe it’s more complicated than that,” he said. “There are all sorts of reasons that your uncle dying could make you sad that have nothing to do with him.”
“You are mine. Don’t ever forget. And that means, you don’t ride my cock like that unless I tell you to, do you understand?”
Draco sighed. “After I was cleared I did venture out a bit. To Muggle clubs and bars, mostly, where I wouldn’t be recognized. It was… quite unpleasant to have the name Malfoy in the wizarding world at that time.”
To his surprise, Kyle laughed. “Yeah,” he said with resignation, looking at the smooth cobblestones of the garden path. “That doesn’t make much sense, does it?”
“She agrees with me that it’s a good idea for you to have your post screened by someone,” Harry said rather quickly, knowing it was going to irritate Draco for him to bring this up again.
But Kyle had already taken the time to look at the relationship through a new lens, and he could see now that it was much more complicated than that, that Evan’s behavior had been more about Evan than it had ever been about Kyle. That Kyle had done the best he could, but it hadn’t been enough because it was never going to be. He would never have been able to fix Evan or their relationship, and he only would have become more miserable trying. So he’d done what he had to do to free himself, to free both of them, even. They were no good together; it had to end.
him… As soon as I refused to fit the picture of who he wanted me to be and the life he wanted to build he became totally distant. That’s when I realized he actually didn’t like me very much.” He was quiet for a few moments as he looked out over the gardens. Draco didn’t reply or try to push him, only watched and listened. “And that kind of sucks,” he said matter-of-factly. “It really sucks to realize that someone you thought loved you doesn’t even really
Harry hesitated. “I’d really like to see you on the day, though. You could… if you wanted, you could have lunch with Teddy and me. It’s not ideal, but-“
ago, you know. You haven’t even done the paperwork correctly. Form IBC3, which you ought to know must be filed…” She looked around at each of them, her right eye twitching in a way that had Kyle snorting in recognition. She hesitated for effect. “…in
Draco responded with silence, and Harry looked at him. He expected the blond to be wearing a knowing smirk, but he looked thoughtful more than anything.
They both bought sandwiches at the lunch cart and then made their way to the rec room to eat. They chatted pleasantly, and Vesper outwardly enjoyed the conversation. On the inside though, there was a bit of a war going on. Inviting Declan to the party had been a bit impulsive. She wasn’t really sorry she had; she did genuinely want to spend time with him. But she’d also just talked to Blaise about how she’d see him there as well.
“Yes, I suppose we’d be stealing Harry and Draco’s thunder a bit, in that case. Of course, they stole ours to begin with.” That ungenerous thought was one she felt she could only share with Ron and no one else, the slight resentment she felt that somehow, as with other things, Harry and Draco were getting to do it first. She knew it was petty, and she certainly wasn’t going to let it ruin things for her two good friends. But she had the uncharitable feeling sometimes, all the same.
Harry chuckled and handed her a scone, which she bit into with relish. She chewed, swallowed, and then kissed Harry again. “Just wanted to say ‘Hi’ and I’ll see you at lunch!”
It usually began with a shy question, hesitant, nearly not asked at all. But the darkness was freedom, and the bedfellow trustworthy, and so the question would eventually be asked, albeit softly, almost unheard.
“And now for Harry’s final bonding vows,” Arthur said, as another ring came floating up, next to Draco this time. As Draco made to pick it up, Harry couldn’t help craning his neck a little to get a good look, not having seen it before. It was platinum like Draco’s, of course, and he could see the same lattice design that his own essence had created in Draco’s ring, except this lattice was criss-crosses of a lovely, deep turquoise.
“I survived. Barely,” Draco said, turning his head to stare up at the sky. “Arithmancy was never my strong suit. I don’t even know why I took it through NEWT level.”
Declan ended up taking her for pizza, which to Vesper seemed perfect. It all felt very low-pressure, like all the times they had been out before, and after getting over a small attack of nerves right at the beginning she was feeling quite relaxed.
“Oh no, that’s fine,” Draco said, though on the inside he was panicking a little. He was just getting reacquainted with the woman. The last thing he wanted was to make things awkward by accidentally staring at her chest too much.
Harry looked a bit messy. He was dressed down in worn jeans and a t-shirt that was dusted with what looked like bits of plaster and paint. His hair was unstyled, as if he hadn’t yet showered. But Draco couldn’t help but think he looked quite sexy anyway.
Draco shook his head. “We never spoke of it outright. He didn’t reject me or tell me he wasn’t ready for a relationship. It wasn’t that. But I did end it because I finally realized my feelings for him were becoming serious and I didn’t believe he could commit. I didn’t have proof but… It’s like you said. I had no reason to believe he would change his mind for me. And I was still terrified of coming out. I couldn’t bring myself to take so many risks for him. But I also couldn’t stay with him as we were, because of my feelings for him. So I ended it. It was…” He swallowed. “It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. And it made everything… strange between us. Harry was hurt, I know that now. Though I didn’t at the time. And so he started avoiding me when he could, and I avoided him in turn, because it was just easier that way and…” He sighed. “Then the summer started, and I did everything I could to move on from Harry. I slept with a number of Muggle men that I picked up in clubs. But I got bored with that quickly. And then I met Kyle.”
Draco shook his head. “No. Because then I’m the arsehole who can’t tolerate the ex, even though I got the guy and she didn’t. And I’m tired of being the arsehole.”
“Put it away, Rita,” Harry said, a mild warning in his voice. In truth though, he really didn’t think he had the energy for this, not on this day of all days. He turned back to Colin’s photos, not wanting to have to look at her.
“How are you planning to wear your hair?” Vesper asked her. “Down, or will you do some sort of updo?”
“Mila, dear, it’s too early to know that sort of thing. The baby is too small,” Lorenz told the girl. Draco glanced back at her, having nearly forgotten she was there.
“No, actually. Those train rides were enjoyable, all in all, back then. Exciting. Now as a teacher, they’re just… loud.”
Harry came closer still, his voice so soft Draco had to lean forward to hear. “I haven’t been with anyone else since… since us. I haven’t been with
“All right, but I’m making carrot sticks and apple slices as well, and you must eat them all. Do you promise?”
“No problem,” said Harry. “We’ve just been passing the time lazily. Or I have anyway. Scorpius has been very productive, of course.”
“Sure,” said Ron. “Anyway.” He closed the cabinet. “That’s the InfiniVault. Convenient as all get out. I don’t know how we managed before.”
you’re pursuing a respectable pureblood man who your parents will no doubt approve of. You said it yourself about Longbottom, didn’t you? ‘Kind, intelligent, and a pureblood to boot?’” he quoted. “’The total package,’ I believe your exact words were.”
“I understand,” she said. “I don’t expect… I’m not looking to point fingers. I hope you know that.” How could she, when at least one finger would most surely end up being pointed back at herself? She had caused this in the first place. “I know that this is a complicated situation. But even if you don’t know everything that’s happening, I would still like to hear what you do know. Even a partial explanation is better than no explanation at all.”
“That’s not why,” Draco said, realizing he sounded a bit resigned. He knew Pansy wouldn’t believe him anyway.
Fawley walked out the door without another word, and Harry sat back down, slumping back in his chair. Well, at least it was done.
Vesper gave her a look, though it was obvious she was fighting a smile. “I wouldn’t call it a ‘thing,’ yet. It’s… a friendship.”
Harry looked at the color, undeniable relief rushing through him. He could live with that color. In fact, he rather liked it. He owned a fair number of shirts that shade or something like it, and Draco always responded well to him when he wore them.
“I’m not tormenting myself,” Kyle replied, his eyes returning to the paper. “I’m just coming to terms with reality.”
to carry everyone else’s feelings as his own responsibility all the time, and to advocate for himself. And that would make all the difference.
Draco searched the room and spotted Potter at a small table in the corner, a firewhiskey in front of him that looked mostly untouched. He was…
“I know,” Harry said with a soft laugh. Trust Teddy to quote his words almost exactly from when he explained why Teddy was going to be staying the weekend with his friend. “And I did have fun with Draco. But I missed you anyway.”
“Far be it for me to tell you what to do, Ves,” Harry replied. “If you want to date either of those guys, do it. I have no idea what Blaise’s game plan is. Maybe he’ll reach out to you, or maybe he’ll wait until he sees you in person again. I don’t know. So you should just do what you want, I say. I just wanted to… well… keep him in mind, I guess. If he does reach out to you, I wanted you to keep an open mind.”
It felt ridiculous to even think it, but the way it had felt… Draco had never been kissed like that. He’d never felt like that. Not with the girls he’d snogged in school, not with the woman he had courted before his parents arranged his marriage to Astoria.
“About what happened between him and Granger?” Harry nodded. “He pulled her aside after dinner, when you and Weasley had left for practice. He told her how he felt, that he was interested. And he said she just sort of listened for a while, and then she said he had given her a lot to think about, and could he give her some time. And he said ‘yes,’ and then… she kissed him.”
Harry couldn’t bear to watch as she rifled around for her clothes and put them on. Because a part of him, most of him even, was slipping into the dizzying abyss of panic, hardly able to register what he had just done. This was Ginny, his safety net, his home. She was supposed to be his family. And he was letting her go. More than that, he was pushing her out the door.
Ron nodded, likely understanding that Hermione was referring more to Blaise’s relationship with Vesper than his relationship with Daphne.
“Not at all,” said Kyle. “But I’m pretty tired of the takeout nearby. I’ve done it way too much recently. I want to find a new place.”
Draco waved his wand and their pants were gone in an instant, leaving them completely naked. He straddled Harry, kissing him passionately again. He rubbed his arse along Harry’s erection, making the Gryffindor moan.
They didn’t get to talk to Teddy for long. When they floo called in the boys were outside playing, and it was Toby’s mother Clarissa who answered. She went to fetch them, and both Teddy and Toby sat down in front of the fire and immediately launched into tales of all the things they’d done together so far. Toby was a very creative kid and loved to make up stories, which Teddy loved to act out with him and help him embellish as they went. It probably helped that Teddy’s metamorphmagus abilities were getting better every day and he could change his appearance at will to play pretend as any number of characters.
It wasn’t until his classes were done for the day that Draco decided to finally open the letter. He knew he should respond immediately; the woman didn’t make empty threats. But he still put it off, at least until he was sure he could be alone.
And he needed something else, too. He needed to live in Grimmauld. He needed a place to call his own.
Draco crossed his arms. A part of him liked Potter’s perspective on the issue, but it was hard for him to fully wrap his head around. “Ever thought that maybe most people aren’t as good at it as you are?” he asked. “Figuring out what someone else wants? Seems to me you just have some sort of sexual Legilimency or something.”
She sniffed loudly again. “Yes, I suppose you’re right. I just don’t… I don’t understand it at all. The girl has hardly shown an interest, passion, or attachment to anything. It is hard for me to imagine her wanting to mother a child. She is still only a child herself.”
She swallowed. “You know what my father is like when he’s angry. Blaise and I would both have had to suffer his wrath, and he would have forbidden me from seeing him ever again. He would have done everything he could to keep us apart.”
There was a part of him that wanted to rebel, to insist that he shouldn’t have to work this hard just to convince someone to be friendly to him. If Malfoy wanted to be an awkward git around him all the time, that was his prerogative.
