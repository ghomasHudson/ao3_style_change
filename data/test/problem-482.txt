“Oh, please.” Henry sneered at the background.
“Oi!” Seamus yelled, standing on his feet. “That some high quality chocolates you got there! Careful with it!” He scolded the students, sending Harry and Hermione a disapproval look. “Honestly, Harry, Hermione. It's just chocolate.”
The sudden sound of a cleared throat made them jump and quickly pulled away from their sudden close proximity.
Scorpius couldn't help but laugh. "What made you think it didn't give me a headache, I had to choose where to go when they stood in the same room."
“Can't we just leave that to ‘Mione and Malfoy?” Weasley groaned, and She Weasley immediately whacked his head, “Don't be rude, everyone helps.”
He smiled, what an adorable sight. They had been the highlight of his day, everyday without fail. Even if Albus can be a nuisance sometimes it gave Draco headache or when Scorpius- wait Scorpius managed to behave himself. Must be coming from his side. He bit his lips to hold back a grin, wondering what kind of traits must his future husband possess for Albus to copy those behaviors of his.
“Mr. Potter!” He beamed suspiciously, showing his gummy smile as he wrapped his hand around Harry's neck. Harry warily eyed him, “Yes, Scorpius.”
“Come here.” He croaked, opening his arms widely and the twins immediately jumped into his arms. He wrapped his arms around them as he laughed for the first time since his trial. “Thank you for coming here, both of you have done so much already. Now, let me take care of you, and then we'll find the solution for my curse.” He said and felt two eager nods on his chest.
He overheard that the boys would spend their time with McGonagall when Malfoy had to go to his class. Other than that, he mostly saw Malfoy brought his children to the library. Returning to their room- courtesy of McGonagall- with tons of books in their arms and seemingly to be working on something with Malfoy- if those close up discussion they were having given any indication.
Later that day, if his eyes strayed towards the Slytherin’s more often than not on a particular person during dinner, he blamed it on the expensive taste of the heart shaped chocolate.
His last words managed to fished a reaction from the blond haired boy; he scoffs humorlessly.
"...tter!"
Potter elbowed him, “And he was interested in you.”
Albus sighed seeing his brother's expression, he can't help but softened, “I know, but we have to do this. Together.”
Henry chuckled, lifting his hand to pat his head. “I know it's a shock for you but you don't have to be afraid, I'm here.”
“Oh, I see it alright.” said Granger, leading them both to their table. “You know he's just playing along, right?” she frowned at him, the moment they took their seats.
Glassy green eyes focused on grey, and Draco drew a soft smile for the man. “Do you miss your husband?”
Harry chuckled, shaking his head at his friend's antics, amused by the situation. It felt like everything was a ray of sunshine somehow.
“Al, this is Headmistress McGonagall and we're currently at the Headmistress’ office.” said Scorpius carefully once Albus stood next to him, his eyes were wild despite his calm demeanor and Albus know how much his brother wanted to expressed their success; a proper manner however, was what they need to show in front of a stranger- that was what papa always said.
“Well, it was me who was actually in that relationship, right?”
McGonagall only gave him a kind smile. "We were not on our best self during difficult times, Harry."
“Papa!”
“I agree with you.” Ginny piped in then, dragging Parkinson with her. “And his name is Henry-”
Draco wasn't sure what to feel about that.
“Harry Potter.” He greets.
The book that they have retrieved earlier from the library.
A sudden delight of shriek from the High Table grabbed their attention. Both of the boys’ eyes widened with a great amount of happiness and anticipation; opened and bright. The identical grinned turns into a full blown smile as they stared at the front of the Great Hall with wonders.
He couldn't let his eyes stray away from the spot Draco and Ginny had gone, until Ron came and gave a firm squeeze on his shoulder.
“That's your husband?” asked Parkinson.
“Draco, you're late for your class.” said Potter, snapping Draco away from his gossip with Pansy. He heard Granger give a colourful curses, and he immediately mimicked her movements, gathering their books in their arms as they quickly moved to leave the group.
Harry blinked at his last comment.
“Thank you for taking care of my sons while they were here, and I'm really sorry for any inconvenience that they have caused all of you.” said Henry kindly, stroking the twins head gently.
“Tough luck.” The man sighed in defeat and took his leave. Draco watched him go.
Harry blinked, aware that the expression was only reserved when Leo was trying to get someone into doing what he wanted them to do, and he always succeeded so; Harry can confirm it, he was one of the victims after all. He quickly dragged his eyes to Malfoy, weirdly anticipating how he would handle his brother's scheming look.
Draco can't help but laugh at his son’s words, covering up his mouth with a hand when heads turned to them again, perhaps traumatised to see a Death Eater freely laughed. Another warning look from Madam Pince got him to swallow his laugh. He bit his lips as he turned to his sons with mirth. “I did?”
“Uncle Blaise!” They exclaimed together.
Five years into his reign, with the help of his trusted friends and allies, Harry had managed to build a powerful empire. He was one of the most respectable Demon King ever existed, and he was also the youngest Demon King that managed to rule the Demon Regime. He has everything, and yet, he has nothing.
"I knew you couldn't resist me." teased Harry as Draco led them down to the dungeon.
Scorpius went rigidly still as the older man walked to his bed, stiffly moved out of the older man's range with Albus on his tail doing a terrible job at stalling the man away.
“Honestly,
"You're welcome." said Malfoy suddenly, breaking the awkward silence between them. Harry took his eyes up to meet the pair of grey eyes, tilting his head in confusion. "Uh, what."
“Well,” began Hermione with a thoughtful look, though there was a teasing glint in those brown eyes. “If you count an imitation of a dying fish as not too silly, then yes, I suppose.” She shrugged, biting her lip to prevent her from laughing when Harry stared at her in horror.
“Don't bother, Aunt Pansy.” said Scorpius, taking a bite of his food, “When papa and Aunt ‘Mione are in that mode, there's nothing can stop them.”
"Figured it's Malfoy." said Ron suddenly and Harry whipped his head at him to see his three friends had their eyes on him in amusement.
“Uh, thank you for taking care of James for me.”
“Yea.” Harry agreed. He can't completely point out, but there was definitely something about the boys that got him unable to take his eyes off. “Why do you think they were here?”
Draco pulled away to frown at her. “I did n-"
"Well, perhaps. One way or another." Harry shrugged. "Are you sure he didn't do anything to you?"
“Yes.” Potter nods, and stiffly smiles. “He's my son, uh, James.”
Harry softened at that.
Harry laughed, relief washed over him as he pulled Draco closer and bent down to kiss him again, aware that the loud applause of all the students echoed in the hall but he chose to to ignore it. Draco gave him a wide beautiful smile when they pulled away, he too had ignored the commotion as he tugged Harry to sit at their table, and with a thumbs up that he had sent to his delighted friends back at the Gryffindor table, Harry had spent his first dinner with Draco Malfoy.
“Well, why don't you?”
The twins nodded obediently.
As they get closer, Scorpius can help but felt overwhelmed and he knows his brother felt the same too. With a short jump, they tackled their father to the ground.
Potter didn't say anything, but kept his eyes locked to Draco that made him feel hot under his collar.
It happened too fast for Harry to sink it in, but when he recognised it was a body that he had pulled blindly towards him, it was almost too late to save themselves as the person he collided into slipped their feet making them fall backwards but before they managed come into the contact with the floor, Harry grabbed the person's waist with a Seeker's speed and forced his feet to hold their ground. Hands flew forwards to grab Harry's shoulders and he felt another body pressed to his as he bent forward to stop this person from falling.
"Malfoy." said Harry, just because.
“Where do you think it's coming from?” asked Harry, leaning forward to take a closer look of the chocolate when Hermione held it in between them.
“I don't think so, Ron,” said Hermione, “They look pretty excited for students who were just being shrunk.”
“Brilliant kids.” Weasley shook his head in amazement.
"Right." Harry nodded, and bore his eyes somewhere on Malfoy's shoulder, content on resting eyes there.
“Draco Malfoy?” The man says with hesitancy, as if he can't believe that he's standing in front of his old archenemy.
Potter widened his eyes in alarm as he quickly put down his plate. “No! That's not it!”
“Your sons.” stated Harry out loud.
Draco immediately fastened the baby securely in his arms, making sure he was in a comfortable position as he softly wipes the baby's tears away, and placed a soft kiss on his head. “Don't cry, love. I'm here now.”
"Also, because Ginny had accidentally saw him used the charm on Parkinson when she went to thank him." said Hermione, suppressing a smile when Harry regarded her with a great surprise.
“I went up to check on them when all I saw was our wands, on the floor.” said Henry, giving the twins an unimpressed look. He received identical sheepish smiles making the older man scoffed. “I can't wait until papa hears about this.”
Scorpius frowned a little. “Well, it looks like an ancient book of old curses, but that's all I can remember.”
“I hate seeing you getting injured, you know that.”
Ron's nose flared at that, “Oh, yea? Because-”
"He's impossible! You know I can't stand him!" Harry marched towards Malfoy, receiving an unimpressed look from the other.
Harry thought it was adorable and grinned. "I had my ways." he winked, heart weirdly calmed now that the adrenaline has settled down but he felt as if he could fly. "Now that I finally got you here, we can-"
Draco tilted his head, perplexed. He decided to let it go.
Hermione cleared her throat then, “Alright, if we can start with this already?”
No wonder he had never managed to grasp any glimpse of his culprit no matter how hard Harry tried to catch him back.
“Well then, are you ready now?”
Scorpius looked up to him and smiled, “Together.”
“Salazar, who the hell is your dad?” huffed Parkinson, “Now I'm dying to know. I mean to create both of you need good genes. Draco got intelligence, so your Dad must possess these-” She suddenly gasped and looked at the twins in horror, “Your dad was a Gryffindor, wasn't he?”
Draco felt his heart swelling in happiness, and he pressed his lips to control the big smile that threatened to escape. “Let me think first.”
"Blimey!" cursed Harry as he brought his leg as fast as he could towards the Great Hall. So much for trying to execute his plan early in the morning. He had slept too late that he overslept, and now he prayed to Merlin he was not too late for breakfast. Ron and the others were already gone the moment he woke up, and he sort of cursed them for leaving him.
“Don't you dare use that tone on me.” Harry warns and Malfoy lets out a humorless laugh. “Do I look like I care, Potter?” A vicious smirk on his face, eyeing Harry with a cold look.
Harry gave an amused chuckle, a contrast to Draco who felt himself shaking. There's- There's no way- He dropped his gaze to where he had his hands rested on Harry's chest, frowning to see that his invisible charm was still in place. There was no way a mere human managed to see him, let alone-
Albus and Scorpius.
“But to think that someone fancy you enough to make them act to this extent.” Ron whistled, shaking his head as his hands quickly adjusting the blanket when they fell off his shoulder caused by his earlier actions. “Wonder what made him hide his identity.”
“It's everywhere apparently.” said Ginny, looking around.
“I said, I think I'm falling in love with you.” He repeated, much louder and slower than before. Draco blinked stupidly as Potter fidget in his spot, peeking an eye at him.
"I am Draco Malfoy, son of the Grand Duke of the Demon Regime, Lucius Malfoy. You have my words, Harry James Potter, no matter what happens, I will come back to you." sworn Draco solemnly, with determination.
Scorpius, on the other hand, was an eager child. He was practically vibrating with excitement the moment they stepped into the library; bouncing on the ball of his feet while dragging his wide eager eyes throughout the large space of the library. It was clear to Draco that Scorpius loved to read, loved to search for information and learn new things looking at his sparkled eyes when Draco brought the books. He knows where to start once he grabbed a book, and immediately fell into his reading.
"Cheer up, mate." said Seamus, wiping a few tears that has escaped his eyes. "You still got time, eh?"
“Apparently I had fallen ill, cursed by an old magic. The only way to prevent myself from dying was by using my own blood to reverse the curse.”
He dragged his eyes towards Malfoy's broken arm that was resting on his stomach, temporary cast was put on. He was changed into a matching pyjamas that makes him look soft, and Harry chuckled when he saw the small army of the Golden Snitch decorating the clothes. Harry looked further down Malfoy's legs, relieved to see there was no serious injury. Perhaps there were bruises that can't be seen, hidden beneath the pyjamas, but Malfoy will survive.
Granger cursed. “Come, Draco!” She made her move and stood up, tightening her grip on his elbow and pulled his hard from his seat.
“Did you miss me?” He asked instead, drawing a playful smile.
He rolled his eyes at the clueless man, “How's things going on with Ginevra?”
"You know what, never mind that." Henry pursed his lips as he frowned at Harry. As if it was Harry's fault that he was talking like a mad man. "I'll let you help, okay? You won't stop otherwise so let's work together."
He heard a scoff making him snapped out of his daze and turned to face his boyfriend. He amusedly smiled, “Are you jealous, Love?”
"Harry," smiled Hermione, "Just be a Gryffindor about it."
"Good morning, Malfoy."
"What, like this?" asked Harry, playfully loosening his arms around Malfoy in an abrupt way and laughed when Malfoy shrieked, glaring at Harry with a disapproval look.
“He was an attractive man.”
Potter scoffed, annoyed apparently. “What space?”
A hand on his shoulder startled him, and he turned to see Hermione questioning his face. “Are you okay?”
He heard the growl next to his ears and saw the man backed away with his hands up in surrender. “Sorry, mate. Thought he was available.”
“Have you ever seen me looking at you?” asked Potter, drawing a smile on his handsome face. Draco shook his head slowly. He never took his eyes off Potter, so he was very much sure that Potter never once looked at him beyond their casualties.
They unconsciously straightened up in unison as the man stride confidently towards them with the twins by his side, faces beaming with happiness and relief.
The first thing Albus felt the moment his arse touchdown was the solid ground. He made a quick pat around his body to ensure everything was intact.
Honestly.
"Thank you, Potter."
He heard Potter sighed heavily and shook his head in disbelief, “Of course I miss you, I haven't seen you for almost two weeks!”
He really was in love with Harry Potter, wasn't he?
“Don't scare me like that!”
He nodded in acknowledgement, lips curled up seeing his twins' antic. “Now, do you remember what kind of book you read?”
The twins sagged in relief as they quickly reached out and gave their father a peck each on his cheeks, drawing a smile from Draco.
Draco watches until the bird disappears from his view, and he just had to chuckles. If he got to be honest with himself, he doesn't know if it will lead them anywhere, but he's willing to find out.
“Not going to stop you,” said Potter. “Who knows, maybe someday I'll fall for you.” He winked, and Draco laughed. Trust Potter to give him high hope.
“But it was supposed to be a pleasant surprise.” Albus pouted.
"He's not incapable, you know."
He already swore that he wanted nothing to do with anything if something ever came up. But somehow, the twins’ sudden appearance managed to make him agitated by throwing him sly looks every time they locked eyes across the room, and don't forget those little smirks they carry; a perfect carbon copy of Draco Malfoy. If he didn't know any better, their mother must be some kind of pureblood; perhaps Pansy Parkinson, seeing those black hair. But he had already voiced out his curiosity to his friends and while Ron had agreed with him, Hermione has smacked their heads with a book, huffing in irritation.
Draco slowly put the article on his table, and runs his fingers through his hair. He's not even sure if Potter was the one who put the stack of papers in his office, it might be someone else's doing.
He has been pursuing this man non-stop, hoping that the feelings will be reciprocated- even when he knew it will never happen- not in a million years. Yes, it was just a mere crush at first, but it turned into love along the way knowing him. It felt quite bizarre. He doesn't know what to do with the outcome.
He watched in awe as Malfoy moved closer to his brother and leaned down to press a soft kiss on the crown of his head, pulling away to give Leo a charming grin. "You know I'll do anything for you."
“He's quite a handsome old man after all.” Zabini commented. “You sure are on your luck, Draco.”
Harry brightly beamed at him, and pulled him closer till they're inch apart. “Please say yes, I'll make sure I'll treat you right. You can kill me if I don't.”
“Oh yes,” giggled Scorpius, “Dad always got himself submitted to St Mungo’s because of his work but nothing serious really.” He said, giving Harry a mysterious smile.
“We're late!” exclaimed Granger, as she continued to pull him making Draco grab his things as fast as he can, sending Potter a look but the man already turned his attention back to Ginevra, not even giving Draco a glance.
When he saw two identical smiles blooming upon Albus and Scorpius’ faces, he couldn't help but mentally sigh in relief. “Now, tell me which book did you read about the curse, Scorpius?” asked Draco as he gestured to the bunch of books around them. “Because these books we're reading are rather useless.”
There was a conflict written across Draco’s face, one that made him nervous to see when the other male went silent for a while.
Harry can almost feel his jaw touching the floor on how far they dropped.
Oh, dear Salazar.
“Draco?”
What he looked forward to everyday was those bloody mysterious kisses. Now that he thought about it, Malfoy’s lips-
"Accidental magic was a sign of children producing magic on their own." agreed McGonagall.
“What are you lot talking about?” Malfoy came in, cutting Hermione words and Harry mentally thanked him.
Draco heard as Granger continued her explanation, and he let her. He doesn't need to listen to what she had to say as he knew about it already. He then turned to observe his twins, to their rhythmic breath, pinky cheeks decorating their faces as they unconsciously sought each other's hand.
Draco nodded, and closed his eyes.
Potter only shook his head at them, entertained. “You'll know if I consider you my love interest, Malfoy." he grinned, and shoved a Treacle Tart inside his mouth. "Until then, I'm good.”
Not wanting to waste any more time, Draco excused himself without waiting for the man's reaction, not forgetting to send a quick waved of a finger to erase the man's memories of Draco. Just in case.
He sighed in relief when he saw both Harry and Ginevra were just turning around a corner the moment he stepped outside, and he immediately trailed behind them as he put on an invisible charm on himself, not risking getting caught in the act.
“I admit that she's the first person I have a real feelings with but that was a long time ago. We're really good friends now because Ron is my best friend.” Potter explained, catching the new tears of Draco with his fingers, wiping them away.
“We do have proof!”
"...ter."
Harry smiled, he remembered the proud feeling burst out in his chest when Ginny and Dean uttered the words bravely. He carefully reached out and took the pale hand into his, there's a few tiny scratches decorating the skin and Harry has to restrained himself from tracing his finger against the wounded skin.
Draco cluck his tongue, ignoring the painful feelings in his heart. “What a cruel man, you expect me to hang out with you after you broke my heart?”
Malfoy gasped, face becoming red expeditiously as he immediately pushed Harry upright by slapping his hands on Harry's chest. It made Harry winced, but he didn't let go of Malfoy's waist even as they had already stood up straight. Harry raised his brows when Malfoy tried to step away.
"Yea," replied their younger dad mindlessly, biting his lips and he frowned hard. He ran his fingers through his unruly hair and sighed desperately. He turned to Albus then. "I need to go somewhere, Albus. Can you stay here with Scorpius?"
“They seem familiar, don't you think?” Ginny tilted her head, calculating with her eyes. “As if we've seen them before.”
“It's not that easy, Potter. Time Travel requires a good amount of your intent for traveling. Albus and Scorpius were desperate enough to get here, that is why the magic allows them to time travel.”
“But, I also saw the way you look at her.”
"That, I am." agreed Harry easily, "Shameless, that is- only when it comes to you, though."
"They were everywhere, Potter," said Draco with a pinched look. "and I am nowhere safe in my own house."
“And you're very handsome!”
Harry frowned at them, not quite catching the meaning behind their words. He had a hunch, but they can't mean what Harry think they meant, right?
"Liar, I'm your husband."
"Are you sure?" whispered a somewhat familiar voice.
The twins may be denying it all they want, but with those sly looks, and knowing smirks, going to Harry for comfort when Malfoy got mad, and making themselves at home around Harry- he looked down in time to see Scorpius slipping his hand around Harry's arm and Albus somehow managed to gravitate his way and find a spot next to Harry now, getting himself comfortable.
To be honest, he doesn't know what to feel. It felt like a sudden force blowing up at his face and he was not ready for it.
“If you hate it, why don't you do anything about it?”
Scorpius gave an annoyed sigh, taking out the wand that they had nicked from their papa and tapped on the Map. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
“Alright.” Potter agreed, “We'll be back soon.” He said and stood up, moving to the door. Before he walked out, he looked over his shoulder to give Draco a reassuring smile. “Don't worry, we can handle this.”
It's decided then. He turned to ask his sons for the last time. "Are you really sure about this?”
, was a definite description of a menace. He was loud, obnoxious, and the perfect example of a person whose job was to make Harry's life difficult. He has been, for the past seventh year of knowing each other.
“If I feel the same, Weasley, it was none of your business.” drawled Zabini.
"-We're going to cooperate."
“Must be a powerful witch then, to cast a strong charm like that.” said Hermione in amazement and Harry just had to smirked at his friends.
Draco yelped, almost knocking the tray of drinks away and looking to his right to see Potter grinning at him, amused by his clumsiness.
"What- you can't just stop like that!" protested Draco, sending him a scandalised look.
With a sheepish grin, Harry quickly waved his wand, and felt a great relief when his magic started to wash away. He sighed in content once he was back to himself; scars and tattoos on display- he automatically rubbed his husband's initial tattoo on his ring finger as he always did, a constant reminder of where his home is.
"You may as well remove your glamour." said McGonagall with amusement.
Harry, who was looking down while playing with his fingers the entire time, looked up hearing the uncertainty in the older man's voice. He blinked when he saw Malfoy was facing the open window, face flushed with red down to his neck, spreading to his exposed chest that got Harry to flustered, heat creeping up his cheeks.
“What, that you've been snogging some bloke which you've never known about for weeks, and find that you actually liked it means you were gay?” Ron raised a brow.
Potter gave a soft laugh and nodded, “Stay safe on your way home, Sweetheart. Call me if anything happens.” He said, squeezing Draco’s shoulder in reassurance.
“Pansy?” They choruses in puzzlement, simultaneously turned to face the Slytherin’s table and watched in astonishment as Pansy Parkinson, of all people, waved back to Seamus, complete with a flirtatious wink.
“And leave you here alone?” gasped Potter dramatically. “I could never!”
"Listen, brat." Henry hissed. "Rule number one: never object when Draco made a rule."
"I adore you." Draco had whispered lovingly, and it was that moment when Harry decided he wouldn't mind spending his forever with the white-blond haired man.
“Bloody hell!” exclaimed Ron, widening his eyes in disbelief as he looked at the photo. Harry can't blame him, he can hardly believe it himself. It was a photo of an older Malfoy with the twins who seemed much smaller than they were now.
“I, I need to go! Bye, Potter!” He shouted, instantly turning around and ran as fast as his legs could carry him.
The only feature that separated their looks was the colour of their hair. Whilst they were matching sets of unruly hair, one of the boys had midnight black hair while the other had a white-blond hair.
"I just didn't have a clue that the two of us could be friends. I was a bit bewildered." continued Draco.
“Make sure you brush your teeth before bed, yea?”
It gave Draco a short circuit; he doesn't know what Potter was playing at but it's raising his hopes for Potter way past the roof. He doesn't know what to do.
"They were asleep," said aunt Ginny, voice was heard from the door.
“Oh! Pansy smuggled them for us!” said Seamus smugly, lifting his hand and giving it a good wave across the hall.
Draco’s heart started to beat into a mad rhythmic. He wasn't sure if it was because he was scared of this creature or because of his words. He decided to pull himself together, despite trying his best not to drop his knees.
“How are you?” asked Granger, smiling brightly at him.
“But we didn't say it out loud.” Hermione gave him a pointed look.
"One way or another," shrugged Draco, but Harry can see a tiny lift of the corner of his lips. "I told him if he wanted my forgiveness, he better get his arse back to his dorm and keep his eyes on my sons- well, your sons."
Malfoy gave him a desperate eyes as he said, "Potter, you can't do this."
"You sure are in a great mood, Harry." Seamus called, towel slinging on one shoulder as he took his steps towards him. "I take it things went well last night, yea?" He whispered.
Once they stepped in into the common room however, Harry was blown with amazement when he saw the place was alive. The place were packed with students, chatting amongst themselves as they were working on,
“Go away, Al.” Scorpius huffed, pinching his brother’s cheek lightly. “I was here first.”
“Albus, calm down.” Scorpius hissed but again, he was ignored.
Ron groaned aloud, “Harry, no. You can't be serious!”
Parkinson had agreed with the plan because
He suddenly felt like he had been neglected.
Headmistress McGonagall carved a warm smile as she regarded them both. “Nice to meet you both, gentlemen.”
Somehow, they unconsciously leant forward the twins, peering down at their faces waiting for the answer.
“Behave yourself, woman!” Weasley grimaced.
Harry smiled at him. "I see you're up and well now." he commented casually, as if he didn't know that the male had just visited his bed last night.
“Did you boys search through the section I always told you not to?” asked Draco blindly, but he watched in satisfaction as the twins cried out, “We're sorry, papa! We didn't mean to!”
Draco turned when a hand clasped on his arm to see a familiar stranger standing in front of him.
It doesn't.
“Draco!” Parkinson perked up, smiling at him. “Where's Henry?”
He may have become the King of the Demon Regime, he may have his victory, but it was nothing when he had lost everything.
It was frustrating.
Harry looked up to see Neville, holding onto his knees as he panted heavily over the wide open door. He watches as the troubled look written over his friend's face, and he heaved a sigh, reaching out to rubs his suddenly throbbing head.
“What are you doing?” asked Draco.
“You-"
He curses when his hand reaches for the offensive papers, pushing away his work - not that he can do anything to it when his mind was elsewhere - and starts reading them one by one. By the time he's done, he knows that Potter has been a single man since the last five years, he adopted James since he was still a newborn, he has opened a Defensive Class for two years already, he knows that Potter sometimes went to Hogwarts for the same said class and he also knows that Potter has come out as Bisexual, and there's even one or two articles that showed him in various dates with some witches or wizards.
“Today, we received special guests from far away,” McGonagall began as the students quieted down. "They are very precious guests to me. Therefore, I look forward to good cooperation from all of you. Apart from that, I would also like to address; under my protection, there shall be no harm to be done for the both of them or they shall receive a fair punishment.”
Albus suddenly burst out laughing, and they gave him a questioning look.
“Oh, but who says I don't want to?”
He opened his eyes in shock and looked down to Henry in an instant to see that the older man already got his eyes on him in surprise.
“Indeed,” said Uncle Blaise as he was calming down, eyes dancing with mirth.
He was thankful for his friends' who had shown their concern over Harry's love life; Ron was actually sad that the mysterious kisser had stopped their scheme on Harry whilst Hermione had advised him to stay positive as she said: "If he was the one for you, you will find him eventually."
Oh, yes. McGonagall is now very sure of their other father's identity.
Harry kept his eyes on Malfoy, fixed on holding his gaze when the pair of grey eyes landed on him. Bracing himself of an incoming sneer, Malfoy gave him a great surprise when he sent Harry a small polite smile which he mindlessly returned with a smile of his own. Malfoy’s eyes widened at that, before averting his eyes elsewhere in an instant. Even with the distance, Harry thought he could catch the change of colour in Malfoy’s face.
He blinked.
"Well, I had my ways of course." said Seamus smugly, wiggling his brows in a suggestive way and Harry did not need to know about that. He grimaced.
Merlin's beard.
“Pardon?"
"You will never know what will happen in the future. Your friendship with Hermione was something that didn't happen in a day. It took months, years even for the two of you to put a full trust towards each other." said Harry, slowly and softly as he carefully put a hand on top of Draco’s. His hands were cold, always did and it was Harry's job to provide him warmth.
Draco Malfoy was not the typical man when he developed a crush on someone. He was not the type to admire them from afar, or just probably sighed in content when their crush walked by or simply existed. He was not the type of person who would get shy when their crush simply looked at them or sat next to them. No, he was not that type of person.
“That would be my fault.” said Granger sheepishly. “I was just explaining to them about the cure of the Blood Curse that we've been working on.”
“You think so too?” Zabini suddenly leaned to both of them, while his eyes on Henry. “He does seem familiar, doesn't he?”
Draco scoffed, “Thank you, Weasley. And you, Ginerva. There's no need for that.”
“You were harassing him!”
Despite the confusion, Harry had to suppress a smile when he heard a faint sound of a skin being slapped.
He panicked when he saw that the lights had taken most of his lover's body, particles of bright sparkles went upwards dancing beautifully, as if Draco was someone it wanted to welcome to be amongst the Magnificent.
Malfoy, who was sitting next to the twins, patted the small boy’s head softly, “It was a very pleasant surprise, Albus.”
Henry scoffed, picking up himself from the floor and patting the dirt off his clothes. “I didn't harass him, it was an accident.”
Draco huffs an annoyed breath. “I didn't go to Dixon because you asked me not to, but he went overboard today. He fucking slap a first year right in front of me, Harry. I can't just let that go.”
Harry gasped happily as he promptly pulled him into a tight hug, laughing delightfully. He gave Draco a final squeeze before he pulled away, face dripping with happiness that tugged Draco's heartstrings since he never saw this expression on his face. He felt special.
Malfoy doesn't know who his future husband was but Harry knew he got his own suspicion. It can't be that hard, right?
“I think you're late for your next class, Malfoy.” said Potter suddenly, making Draco to check on his watch promptly. He curses at the time, and quickly stood up, gathering his things and piled them up in his arms.
It was the hand of a lover.
If only his heart was not taken, he will surely agree with this man’s proposal.
There were scattered torn robes across the floor, and he can see Zabini, Crabbe, Goyle and Nott were occupied with their own fights but that's not what made Harry stop dead on his track because right there on the centre, Draco Malfoy was in a middle of throwing a mean punch to Dixon's face.
The other twin plucked their hand out of Parkinson's grip as he went to his brother and gave his head a good whack and Albus yelped in pain. “Don't be an imbecile, Albus! If dad hears about this, he'll kill you for sure.”
It was Potter.
He had managed to lead his army, he had managed to execute their plan perfectly.
Draco can understand her implications. “I see.” He unconsciously sought Potter's face. “All of you?”
“Listen,” Malfoy sighed in frustration, apparently he can't help but roll his eyes at Harry. “I won't be here if it's not important.”
“Blimey, and we didn't even notice her presence!”
They parted away eventually, collecting their breaths as they leaned into each other's foreheads. Harry couldn't help the smile that grew upon his face when he heard the sound of a small chuckle come from his lover. Now that he can think more clearly, he realised that he had acted pathetically earlier.
The small fist on his collar loosen their grip, conforming Draco that the little wee has totally knocked out, and Draco softly chuckles, amused.
“What's wrong?” asked Potter, alarmed, and ran to catch Draco’s hand without thinking. “Are you alright?”
Kisses.
The ruckus managed to attract other houses; heads turning, while curious eyes widely watched as the younger Slytherins practically beaming to one another, speaking excitedly as they start to compare the identical packages they have received within themselves, whilst the older Slytherins shared bemused and unsure smiles, peculiarly as they read the cards that probably came with the packages. The first years, however, were over the moon seeing as they received much bigger packages than the older students.
Draco sighed, almost desperate that he couldn't be of help to calm the baby down when a song deep in his unconscious mind involuntarily stumbled out of his mouth.
“Ron!” Hermione immediately scolded once she noticed, “I can't believe you just eat it like that!”
“You can close your ears, Weasley.” said Draco flatly, sending him an unimpressed look.
They made their way towards the sloping lawn outside the castle, when Ron suddenly opened his mouth. “Was it got to do with the heart shaped chocolate?”
He ran his fingers through Albus’ hair. What a joyful child; both of them were. He reached out to Scorpius, caressing those soft cheeks of his twin. Seeing them like this, Draco thank Merlin that somehow in the future, he had managed to raise his children in a good environment.
He felt a small hand tightened their grip on him, and looked down to see Scorpius smiling sweetly at him, “Can I sit on your lap, please?"
Henry's brow furrowed, his eyes full of intensity that it caught Draco off guard when he was suddenly pulled into a kiss.
He softened his gaze, and nodded. “Yes, I trust you.”
Harry gaped, skin tingling from where the soft lips has touched and he stupidly watched as Malfoy smirked at him, grey eyes twinkling teasingly before he straightened up for the second time and turned around to walk straight to the door as he called, "Contact me anytime you want, till then, don't bother me."
“Then it won't be a surprise!” Albus announced, seemingly has stopped doodling the blank parchment as he already put his attention to Draco eagerly.
“So, when are you going to Madam Promfey?” asked Pansy when they had finished their breakfast, and now just lounging around enjoying the sun. She had her hand on Blaise’s hair, stroking them lightly as he peacefully enjoyed his little nap.
"I figured that was the reason you were here, weren't you? Seeing as I save the Wease- Weasley." Malfoy finished awkwardly, and Harry had to bite back a grin.
“That, I do.” said Draco, winking and the man chuckled before he took his leave. Draco watched him go, a bit distracted by the way the man's muscle back contracted every time he moved to avoid the mess of the people inside the packed club.
Harry quickly turned his head around to Zabini he almost got whiplash.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him hoping that it'll intimidate Potter but the git only narrowed his eyes in response.
“Fancy seeing you're out of your hole now.” Blaise grinned, stealing a kiss from a giggling Pansy.
Malfoy sighed at the both of them, pinching the bridge of his nose before he straightened up and regards Harry. “Now, Potter. May I know why you are here?”
Oh, dear.
“Yes?” asked Draco nonchalantly, as if he didn't know Scorpius’ intention. The small boy moved to wrap his arms around Draco’s neck, kissing his forehead before he slowly asked, “May I borrow you wand, please?”
Malfoy bit his lips, wide eyes locking with his friends looking hesitant to even say anything. He looked like a walking tree, too stiff to be in Henry's arm.
“What's wrong?” he asked, and Ron bit his lips, tilting his head as he regarded Harry carefully enough to make him shift uncomfortably. “What?”
He jumped when they simultaneously turned to him all of a sudden, and he was not quite sure of what to do except to stupidly stare at their expectant faces, brows raised in an identical manner as they leaned forward, invading Harry's personal space. It went like that for a while, just Harry darting his eyes to his friends back and forth when the pressure was too much for him to handle making him groaned aloud.
“Oh dear Merlin, I'm alive! Scorpius, we're alive!”
He waited for a few good minutes before he secretly took off his Cloak, not forgetting to check his surroundings as he duck down in between Ron and Hermione, felt her hand gathering the Cloak in her lap. He took a camouflage and dived down under the table when he saw Malfoy turned around all of a sudden, hitting his head in the process resulting a snort from Ron, and climbed out when Ron gave him a green light. With a whisper of good luck from his friends, Harry carefully made his way towards the Slytherin table.
“Well, he's clearly a major dick, so.” Harry shrugs, nonchalantly.
“It's your fault that he's angry.” His brother scoffed, curling his small arms around Harry's bicep. Harry stiffened but unnoticed by the boy.
"And for the hundredth time, I am." said Malfoy, placing a hand on his arm gently. "Thank you for looking out for me." he smiled.
He caught a movement on his right and gasped when he saw that Harry had the golden arrow between his fingers. Heavens, no other creatures can see the arrow except for Draco’s own kind. Harry however, did not only saw the golden arrow, he even managed to catch it effortlessly, and now he was playfully twirling it around as if it was a toy.
“Albus!” scolded Scorpius and McGonagall raised an eyebrow.
“Yes, but it's a little bizarre, isn't it? That's your freaking husband.”
“I can barely do it myself,” said Hermione.
They looked positively happy.
Malfoy's face was red with embarrassment that Harry almost felt sorry for him. Almost. He watched in fascination as Malfoy took a deep breath and sent him a mean gaze but Harry only blinked. Malfoy grew frustrated and Harry yelped when he was suddenly pinched on his bicep.
“I don't know either.” Granger sniffed back, taking a few firm breaths before she straightened up. “Alright, that's it.” She lifted her chin. “Let's skip class for today. We're already late, anyway. Let's call Pansy and Blaise.” She grabbed Draco’s hand without waiting for his answer, and led him towards the entrance. Her other hand fishing her phone in her sling bag, immediately dialing up the number when she got them in her hand and Draco let her. He was too busy to understand the pain in his heart to give his attention to anything else.
Harry Potter was straight as fuck.
Harry ignored him, looking past Malfoy to send Henry a death glare. “You said you won't do anything to him!” He barked.
“Why are you crying, stupid?” Draco sniffed, wiping his nose unattractively.
“He's yours?”
“Am I what?”
They were basically the same person, identical from the bottom to the top; a sole person. So it wouldn't make sense for Harry to harbour a crush on Draco when he was right there in front of Harry, always been. Why can't he look at him the same way he looked at Draco?
"Blimey, Scorp!" huffed Albus, scrambling for his dad's Marauder's Map from Scorpius under the Cloak, "You had one job!"
The soft hand moved down to his nape like a butterfly, giving them a gentle squeeze as they went further to his shoulder, and he frowned when he felt a continuous tap.
Potter lean to him, eyes dancing with mischief. “But that doesn't stop you from trying. isn't it, Sweetheart?”
They turned to the source's voice to see Ginny watching them with both fondness and annoyance from the camp's entrance, red hair waving when a breeze of wind blew her hair.
He observed his next target; a mid twenties young man with a rather obnoxious black hair that seemingly can't be tamed. He was wearing a simple black jeans, white t-shirt and a jean jacket and Draco involuntarily hummed in appreciation when the man turned to give the place a once-over, allowing Draco to see his face. The man was quite a devastatingly handsome young man.
"Besides," Ron piped in, face was teasing. "You were back to obsessing Malfoy these past few days, mate. Your eyes practically glued to him every time you saw him."
A sudden chuckle broke their staring session, and they turned to the sources revealing a tall young adult with brown skin, standing behind their father with an amused smile. “I didn't know you had kids, Draco.”
Albus, that calculative little prat managed to catch the exchange. “You're not going to get that part of information from us, Aunt Pansy.” He cheekily said, smirking a little.
“Uh.”
“You still haven't told me why you got two chocolates.” Ron piped in.
Instead, it gets worse as the baby's voice sounds harsher than before, wailing as loud as they can.
"What are we talking about?" appeared Ron with Hermione on his side.
Malfoy looked much better; content, healthy and handsome.
"I'm sorry."
“Very well, I am sure for your dangerous effort,” McGoganall began, making the two boys winced at her words, “The only thing I can provide for the both of you is to help you as much as I can give.”
Ron snorted, “Tell me about it.”
“Headmistress, my name is Scorpius Hyperion Potter and this is my twin brother, Albus Severus Potter.” said Scorpius with determination. When McGonagall’s eyes widened with surprise, Scorpius immediately continued, “We are Harry Potter's sons.”
“Headmistress, I wonder if you can transfigure our clothes into Hogwarts uniform?”
When the two boys shared a look, McGonagall can't help the strange instincts that she knows the identity of their other father.
"You wouldn't." teased Harry. "You know why? because- ah! You hexed me!" Harry gaped at the other male in disbelief.
“I'm not interested, sorry!” Draco gave the stranger an apologetic smile.
He sent his Patronus when he was meters away from the gargoyle; to inform McGonagall of his arrival, and proceeded to enter the Headmistress' office when it was already open for him.
“Hello,” The man greeted. His voice was deep and strong as an easy smile played on his lips. “I'm Henry.” He said, his nose flared as if he was trying his best not to laugh.
He marched purposely towards a small crowd of Slytherin, eyes locked to the particular white-blond head and growled when he got closer but yelped when he was suddenly yanked aside and met with a betrayed face of Seamus. He immediately yielded.
“Oh, look!” Uncle Blaise then called out, “I think you boys just broke your Papa!”
“That fucking dick had the balls to touch first years, like a fucking uncivilised people.” Draco says in heavy breaths, “I just had to show him how it feels.”
“And I am an attractive man myself.”
Potter. Right.
When Ron went silent and fidgeting in his spot, Harry rolled his eyes as Zabini snorted, “The least you could do was to defend your statement, Weasley.”
Harry gaped, taken aback by Malfoy's outburst before he snapped out and growled. Stupid Malfoy. He took a step forward towards the other male and something must've been painted on his face as Malfoy squeaked, took out his wand quickly pointed to himself as he chanted a spell and turned invisible in an instant right in front Harry.
"I have packed these chocolates in a box, as I can't hand it to you in person. There's one for each day until Christmas hols and Merlin, I can't say more but I did include a card for you-"
Right, they have run the test twice and the result stayed the same; the twins were definitely matched Draco’s magical signature.
There was a soft hand, caressing his head in a gentle manner. Long fingers threading through his locks, scratching his scalp with the pads of their fingers lovingly, and Harry had never felt this way before.
“Yes! Now Come on!” cried Albus, “We don't have much time!”
"Presents?" asked Harry, turning to Draco with a great surprise.
“I see the way you look at her, Potter. You can't fool me. You're still in love with her, aren't you?” Draco looked at the man who was now facing the ground.
Draco swallowed, “I don't think that's a good idea?” He took a glance at Ginevra who was watching their interaction with interest.
“Why, thank you.” smiled Granger, popping a chip in her mouth.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, moving to stand in front of him and leaned down to press a chaste kiss on the corner of his lips. "That."
Harry yelped when Hermione jabbed his waist. He gave her a side eye as he rubbed his abused spot and frowned at her. “What, Hermione?”
“Harry.”
He watched as Potter glowed up when Ginevra laughed at his jokes and he bit his lips. He looked down at his untouched food, and suddenly he didn't have the appetite to eat. A hand grabbed his elbow, pulling him to collide with a soft body. He looked at Granger who pressed her lips, eyes filled with sympathies making Draco roll his eyes at her.
Harry took a deep breath, gazing into Draco’s eyes before he nodded, and stole a kiss from his lover's lips. "I will wait for you, and if you take too long to come back, I will bring you back to me by my own self."
“You know I can't abuse my power, right? Just because I'm a Head Student doesn't mean I can use it every time my boyfriend did something stupid, like get into fights.”
He shared excited looks with his friends, grinned as they exclaimed in unison;
Eyes wide with shock as adrenaline ran through his veins, Harry breathed heavily knowing he had managed to save both their necks in the nick of time. More so when he realised he was looking into a familiar pair of grey eyes who was looking back at him with great surprise.
"Then I will exclude the two of you from this plan." stated Malfoy with a finality.
Draco gasped at that, flabbergasted by the sudden change of event causing him to lose his balance and stumbled on his feet. He fell backwards, about to land on the dirty ground before an arm took a place around his waist and straightened him up. He was then pressed onto another body, the grip on his waist was strong and secure.
“I'm sure we can find a way.” He heard Potter say, and felt a reassuring hand on his shoulder. He turned to the man and gave him a small smile, “I hope so.”
“Enough!” He yells, allowing his magic to flow out of his body enough to parted the fighting students.
Draco can't help but chuckled, “It was only two weeks, Potter.”
“Henry.” Malfoy warned, making the older man to huffed in irritation and Harry throw a smug face. “Potter, you too.”
Huh, they looked soft and pink, really pink.
He takes a deep breath as he rubbed his temple faintly, taking in the sight of Malfoy in front of him. As usual, he sits on the seat Harry pointed him to every time Harry called him in. But this time, instead of babbling his dissatisfaction towards the treatment he received, or defending his action on why he was in a fight; he simply sit there, doing none of those.
“Papa!”
“Potter!” Malfoy gasped, face flushed red as he looked up to Harry with a surprised look.
It has been a bizarre day, but at least he wasn't the only one who thought that the exchange was rather eccentric when he saw the same astounded look carved on Malfoy’s face.
Draco chuckled, wiping away the tears that were already running down his face. How pathetic it is to cry in front of children.
in the future later. Perhaps he deserved to touch and hold Malfoy whatever he wanted to but they were not married yet in this timeline, and hell if Harry would let the older man do what he wants.
“Great. Please strip for me.”
Ron dropped his jaw in disbelief, “One old man and they act like he's a bloody Merlin himself.”
"You'll see him tomorrow, mate. Don't worry, eh?" Seamus clasped a hand to his shoulder gleefully and Harry nodded, thanking both of them before he runs to find Ron and Hermione. It was more of running away from doing himself further destruction, really.
He let himself dragged by the twins, looking over his shoulder to see Malfoy already has his eyes on him, panicked. Harry forced himself to stop, making sure his grip on the twins secure and safe when they stumbled upon their feet by the abrupt change of pace.
Harry ran his eyes wildly over his face and let out an approving smile. “You are, Sweetheart.”
Harry's heart jumped at that, mind hastily working as he tried to recall anything that was informed to him. "I- I think Hermione did mention it, but it's really hard for me to pay attention."
McGonagall seemingly caught his action and immediately smiled. "I hope you've managed to make some progress with your inspection?"
Harry followed him in an instant, gathering his Cloak into his arms as he frowned at the white-blond Slytherin. "Why not?"
They are indeed.
When Harry heard the door was closed with a soft click, he immediately sprung up his bed, scrambling for his map under his pillow and quickly recite the password. His eyes pinned on the dot that was walking towards Seamus', watch with heart beating hard against his ribcage as they leave the Gryffindor tower straight to the Hospital Wing where Parkinson's dot was seen indicating that she has been waiting for them or perhaps has been replacing the original occupant's place in case of something happened.
Now, all he needed was a plan.
Harry chuckled, pressing a soft kiss on top of Draco’s head before he began with his memories of the twins growing up, tales of mischief and their little adventures were shared with enthusiasm. Cocoon in a warm quilt, the two of them spent the night talking, sharing their bodies' heat until none of them could keep their eyes open, and they fell asleep in each other's arms.
“Merlin’s beard.” Henry groaned, “I see what they were talking about now.”
One and only.
Draco put his head between his hands, resisting so hard not to grab his hair out of frustration. He looks down at his documents desperately, and tries to find a glimpse of concentration that he can pull in order to continue his work.
Draco slowly turned to Potter, drawing a slight disbelief look on his face. How dare this man ask such a question! He eyed the man up and down, receiving a smirk in return. He gave his own smirk, changing his demeanor as he sat up straight, looking down on Potter with his chin turned upwards.
Harry winced when strong hands gripped his shoulders tightly from behind. He growled when Henry dragged him away from Malfoy who eyed them warily.
"Our sons." teased Harry when he saw Draco’s face flushed with his slip up.
“I can't believe it!” said Weasley, eyes wide as saucers.
“It's because I had enough that I did all of this.” Malfoy says in gritted teeth, face still facing the window. “You don't know what happened out there ever since that son of dick came.” He balls his hand into a tight fist as he gives Harry a nasty sneer. “You sit in this bloody office all the time!”
“Told ya.”
“Come on, Granger. You're going to be late yourself.” Draco tapped her shoulder as she shoved the last piece of chips in her mouth, copying Draco’s movement in the process.
He saw Potter dropped his jaw at him with a surprised look on his face.
"Ginny." whispered Draco, "Save Ginny."
“Dad was a really loving person.” Scorpius continued, “He was really kind and he loves you so much. It broke his heart when you were cursed, papa. We don't want him to get sad, that's why we're here.”
What shock Harry even more is when a voice, that he's very much familiar with, shouted far from his right.
“I just said that, Potter.”
Malfoy straightened up then, and Harry couldn't help but felt a major disappointment when Malfoy turned to him with a small sneer; soft smiles and silken eyes were gone the moment his eyes landed on Harry.
And that was how Harry Potter found them.
As if he would believe that. What kind of demon who would not kill their victims? He already had a hunch just what kind of creature Harry was, seeing his display of power and when he usually stumbled upon these creatures during his assignment, he would always stay away from trouble and avoid them. Low rank demons won't be able to detect a high rank Cupid like Draco, but having seen the way Harry handled the golden bow and the red flash of Harry's eyes was enough to break Draco’s magic, he knew that this man in front of him was anything but a low rank demon.
Henry gave an amused laugh before a cool hand touch his right leg made him gasped. A foreign incantation of spells was heard then, as warm magic washes over him gently, making him shiver down his spine. He felt Henry's fingers touch every bit of his skin like a butterfly, slowly but surely as he inspected every inch of him. He savoured the warm feeling spread through his body, unaware of the hand that was slowly climbing up his body until he let out an accidental moan when Henry's hand touched his inner thigh.
"What are you talking about?"
“I want everyone back to their rooms, at this instant.” He says in authority that leaves no arguments, and looks over his shoulder for Hermione who gives him a nod. “The rest of you, please follow Miss Granger for further action.” He gestures to the remaining students body, as they promptly moves to take the fighting students, and the first years to follow the awaiting Hermione.
“We're 10!”
He felt overwhelmed suddenly. It was definitely tough for him to go through the eighth year even having Blaise and Pansy by his side. He barely sleeps with all the nightmares, he doesn't have the appetite, he felt down all the time, he was not happy and he always felt like there was a bloody hippogriff resting on his chest.
To his great surprise, the baby slows down, sobbing as he takes a broken breath in between calming down his cries. Draco’s heart swells when the baby drops his head on his shoulder, burying his face onto his neck and fist his collar with his miniature hand.
"I," began Draco eventually, and Harry looked at him with anticipation. "I want to be with you too." he finished with a shy smile, gazing up at Harry with sparkling eyes.
“You know,” Parkinson suddenly piped in, “Your papa never told us who's your Dad is.” She said, gesturing to her and Zabini but Harry saw her shared a look with Ginny.
“Okay, come on now! We're late!” Granger suddenly came and rescued Draco from his stupefaction, gaping stupidly at the grinning Potter who waved them happily as Granger led them away.
“Of course.” Draco stepped back, allowing Potter to move and walk away from Draco. He stops to look over his shoulder when he was about to disappear from Draco’s eyesight, a thankful smile drawn upon his face which Draco replies with a smile of his own and an awkward wave. With a polite nod, Potter continues his journey, disappearing from Draco line of sight and probably away from his life too.
“He was.” Harry reluctantly agreed.
Closing the door behind him, Malfoy has gone with a little bit of Harry's heart with him and he still can't tear his eyes from the door. He prays for Merlin to save him when they become boyfriends soon because he knew that he couldn't survive when the time's come.
“So, how are you doing?” asked the familiar man.
It was very Slytherin of them, but Harry thought if it wasn't because of them, Hogwarts wouldn't be in its current state; brighter and glorious. The students' relationship to one another has improved too, it doesn't matter which house they were in. Slytherins were treated much better than before; instead of walking around like a bunch of kicked puppies, now they have gained their confidence back. So were other houses, if back then they would have avoided lounging around Hogwarts, acted as if walking around the castle felt like a chore, now the students practically were hanging out everywhere. There won't be a place where the students won't be around. It was nice to see that Hogwarts finally healed.
“I'm not!” Potter protested out loud.
Malfoy just dismissed him with a wave, though his cheeks were pink. “I think they were rather clever for thinking up the solution.”
“Do you know why I was sitting in this ‘bloody’ office all day?” Harry asks, looking up as Draco shakes his head. “I had to work on Dixon previous disciplinary files from his previous school, so that I can have a concrete evidence to expel him from Hogwarts. Today's incident can be a strong point to expel him.”
“-which of course meant something.” Parkinson continued, wiggling her brows. “Don't you think so, Potter?” She looked at him with an expectant look, followed by the others.
The baby's face was already red, fat tears running through his small face as they kept twisting their body around, trying to escape from the witch’s hold.
“Chocolate?” Hermione picked up one of the small packages as she arrived together with Ginny and examined them.
"A bloody detention because of a kiss." said Draco, bringing Harry back to reality and just in time to see him shook his head in disbelief. Harry smiled, tugging the blond's hand through their linked hands to pull him closer.
“Do you really want me to say it to you?”
Harry groaned and rolled in his bed, laying on his stomach.
“Oh, out with it!” Henry shouted, startling Harry making him blurted out; “I wanted to see if you're okay!”
“I think I'm falling in love with you.” He quickly announced, pressing his lips together then in a timid way.
“Hello.” acknowledged Draco, smiling warmly at the man.
Harry can't help but chuckled, “That was a very brave thing to do.”
“So, you could give him a chance.”
“My husband.” answered Malfoy smartly, making Harry grits his teeth in annoyance.
“I'm sorry, but I'm here with someone so I had to decline.”
“Malfoy.”
“Just a possibility.” said Henry softly, carefully reaching out to place a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “That was the reason why I want to check your body. Properly, thoroughly, if I may.”
Draco raised his brows as he stared at Potter. Honestly, he didn't even think of that. That was actually brilliant, but it's not like he's going to say it out loud.
“Why are we sitting here, and they're over there?” He asked out loud.
Harry frowned at the man's sudden shy behaviour. “Well, let's hurry up. Don't want to get your husband waiting.”
“Thank you, Granger.” said Malfoy, nodding with appreciation. “But I really do need to speak with you, Potter," he gestured to somewhere behind his shoulder. "Regarding my sons.”
"Let," tried Draco, and he took a deep breath before he put on a determined face. "Let go of me."
He never bothered himself with the underworld, as he didn't think it was important for him to know. He was only a subordinate of the Heavens' Realm after all; he received his assignment and he executed them. He viewed demons as other creatures of another realm, best to ignore.
Harry grinned, heart palpitating weirdly and he quickly waved back. "You're welcome. Take care, Malfoy."
Dear Merlin, but his mysterious culprit didn't show himself today. No kisses, no heart shaped chocolate. Worse, Harry didn't even think about him; not once did the thought of a mysterious kiss have crossed his mind.
"Part of that, yes. Thank you for saving Ginny, but I really do want to see your condition." said Harry, smiling.
Malfoy looked like he was desperate to say something, opening and closing his mouth and giving Harry a hopeless look. He inhaled suddenly, and exhaled before he babbled, "I took advantage of you without your consent, I am a Death Eater and you're the Saviour and I am bad, and I am sorry for doing bad things to you and everyone else and I shouldn't have done that and I am a bad person and you shouldn't have kissed me or even look at me, I am a bad person!"
Draco looked up from his reading to see Scorpius’ curious face. It was the next day, and they were currently at the library occupying one of the tables with books sprawled on top of it. Albus wasn't doing much work, he was only thrilled to be in the Hogwarts' library for the first twenty minutes. By the time Draco laid dozens of books in front of him, he grimaced but took one book just for the sake of taking a part in their current mission. Draco had mentally snorted, amused with his antic, and let him suffer for a good ten minutes before he took a pity for the boy and pulled out a quill and a blank parchment and handed it to him. The great relief washed over his face the moment Draco released him from his suffering was entertaining.
Hermione gave Ron's arm a slap when he kept on laughing, silently scolded him for his actions before she started to make those faces to Ron, and they fall into a small comical talk using their faces, something that Harry had never quite master because apparently it was only applicable to people who were in a relationship.
Harry however, stared at him in horror. "Dean, where did you get the chocolate?"
Malfoy sighed, but sent a small unsure smile to him. "I don't know, Potter,"
"Wha-"
Potter doesn't need to fall in love. He was already is. He was already in love with Ginevra Weasley. It made sense now. The way Potter seemed too casual no matter how much Draco had flirted with him. He was too carefree, calling Draco his Sweetheart and all that. No wonder he doesn't blink an eye when Draco gave him kisses on his cheek.
"Then that's all I need for you to be, stay safe and be careful."
Henry rolled his eyes in annoyance, “Merlin, I didn't know I was such a- ah, anyway, I don't know what got you so worked up. It's not like it was you that I was touching.”
“What?!” Malfoy squeaked, whereas Harry involuntarily shouted it out of surprise.
"Y-you can't play arou-around w-with that."
“You did, papa.” said Scorpius brightly, “You nearly gave dad a heart attack when you went into labour two weeks earlier than expected.”
There was a hitched breath, but Harry worked his mouth against Malfoy, sliding an arm around the slim waist whilst his other hand snaked down from his side up to the white-blond hair and took a desperate fist of the soft strands that got Malfoy to gasped and moan at the same time. Harry smirked, and took the opportunity to slid his tongue in Malfoy's hot cavern and met his tongue. He felt their saliva ran down their chins as they fought for dominance, and he hummed in appreciation when Malfoy backed down.
"Not just us," piped in Seamus. "They even dragged the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs."
Papa.
“I'm letting you go!” Draco repeated, “You, Harry Potter are free from my clutch. You're a free man now.”
"What plan?" asked Harry.
He feels a great amount of emptiness once Potter has his son back in his arms, so he covers it up by stiffly straightening his clothes, felt it was a bit damp from where he had held James earlier.
His husband, who he will spend his lifetime with in the future, who shared beautiful children together with him, and the person who would do anything for him and his children.
Draco was surprised to see that she was actually one of his employees, which made things easier as he quickly asked. "Ms. Bloom! What happened?”
The green eyes sparkled brightly at him, apparently pleased that Harry understand the meaning behind his name. "Yes!"
Draco shrugged.
“Alright!" Scorpius clasped his hand together. "Next, you've memorised the spells?”
As expected, the younger version of his husband scoffed out loud. "As if! You left me with Potter!"
It almost gave him a heart attack when it happened to him the first time. He was only a few steps behind Ron and Hermione, content on watching his friends lovingly teasing one another when a hand grabbed his robes and stalled him from walking. He was yanked around, and felt hands on each of his cheeks before he was pulled into a kiss, enough to make him light headed and dizzy. But just like the way he appeared, his culprit vanished in a blink of an eye after stealing Harry's ability to function, leaving him with a heart shaped chocolate tucked nicely in his curled fist.
He continued his journey back to the common room with a lighter heart, lips spreading into a wide smile. He went straight to his bed as he arrived, slipping under the blanket and propped his hands under his head as he recalled his interaction with Malfoy.
"Thank you, professor." said Harry, as he looked up to McGonagall. "I really have no idea what I've been doing these past few years. I am lost without him, and I feel useless, not knowing what to do to save him."
Harry mildly paid attention to the sound of Draco hissing as he ended his spell with the last incantation, his spare wand making the last contact with Draco’s index finger before he lifted them and watched as the last golden spark emerging from the wand dissipating into thin air. With a satisfied nod, he slid his wand back into his back pocket when the sound of skin being slapped had Harry to look up just in time to see his younger self was rubbing his hand, wincing. His face was sorted into a wounded look as he looked up to Draco who was looking back at him with an annoyed look.
It was,
Now that he saw Malfoy's condition with his own two eyes, he couldn't help the heavy feeling rested on his chest, gnawing his heart when he ran his eyes over the wounds on Malfoy's face. There was an ugly healing scratch across his cheek down to his lower lip, his cheekbone and forehead was bruised, and there was a healing split near his brow.
He stepped forward when Malfoy stepped in front of his hiding spot, sneaked a hand out and took a grab of Malfoy's hand, and tugged him inside the Invisibility Cloak as he walked him backwards towards the hidden alcove and pinned him to the wall. Malfoy gasped aloud, and Harry didn't give him any chance as he immediately dived in and captured the slightly agape pink lips in a desirous kiss.
It has been going on for weeks now. Most of the days he'd catch him on his usual tree, some was when he fell asleep in an empty class but always, always when he was alone. Even so, Harry's favourite would be those days when his culprit was being sneaky like the snake he is, where he'd catch him while he was around his friends.
Henry yelped, a hand automatically wrapped around Draco’s waist while the other quickly dropped to the floor to prevent them from falling,
"Not yet," sneered Draco, though without malice. "You don't get to decide if I'm a cuddler or not."
Wasn't he?
"You were already thoughtful for bringing them spare clothes." said Draco, giving Harry a small smile when he looked up to him in surprise. He was in the middle of buttoning his pyjamas and walked towards the king sized bed once he was done. He lay down carefully down the bed, facing the ceiling as he sighed. "Merlin knows they didn't even think about spare clothes and a few items of the future when all they focused on was to travel back in time."
"Ron!"
“My…" Draco began, "My sons?” his voice may have cracked a little but Salazar, what kind of joke was Merlin playing at?
“Yes, that is true! Like dad, for example.” said Scorpius, giving his head a rapid nod as if trying to prove his point.
“So much, it hurts.”
Before he could even defend himself, a mist of black suddenly appeared inside the camp, halting their banter, and they watched as the mist turned into Ron, who quickly found Harry's eyes and nodded.
It was the tone that their dad had always used when he was about to go on a dangerous mission. He would always talk to them before he left, explaining that he had to be away for several days. Usually when their dad was in this mode, they know better than to ask many questions. There was this expression on his face; where there was a crease on his forehead and a stern look on his face when something was occupying his mind. Though it looked intimidating for other people, Albus can't help but think it was admirable, because he knew that their dad would always give his best on everything he did.
"It was not my fault he went and disappeared." protested Albus, spreading the Map in between them as they work under the Cloak, "Besides, has you seen his face, he was about to murder someone."
Harry chuckled as he stepped out of the room, silently closing the door behind him. He took a moment to just stare at the door before he walked away, a fond smile carved upon his face when Draco’s voice got higher by the seconds, even through the closed door. He decided to let the two young adults deal with it themselves. It was something that they needed to talk privately, after all. Though, he had to admit, he and his Draco had dealt with it much better compared to their counterparts. Perhaps it was because by the time it happened, they had already forgiven each other, way before they had met each other again years after the war.
Harry sighed in relief, and scratched his head as he matched Malfoy's smile.
‘My sons’ he said.
“Check!”
"You can't just kiss me and think it will solve the problem, Potter." said Malfoy, lips thinned despite his flushed face.
Looking at Harry's deep red face, Leo couldn't help but feel the weird tug on his chest. He was already suspicious of Harry's behaviour every time Draco was around, though he thought that he was fooling anyone by acting with hostility in front of Draco but Leo's was not fooled, and he tried to ignore his feelings, thinking it was nothing but Harry couldn't be harbouring a crush on his brother, could he?
Harry licked his lips, eyes bright as he carefully asked. “Can I kiss you?”
“I haven't found any other solution.” said Granger all of a sudden in irritation, closing the book in her hand dramatically. “All of the information led to the same way of travel.” She continued. She opened her mouth to explain more but Draco shook his head at her, pointing at his twins with his eyes. Granger immediately straightened up and shut her mouth, nodding in understanding. She put the book on her side as she reached out for a piece of bread instead.
“Show me.” Harry says as he pushes his chair and stood up, pressing his lips together in a thin line. He moves to walk towards awaiting Neville in a calm demeanor he can display, but quickened the movement of his feet. He hears several chairs move, and hurried steps following his trail. He ignores them as he focused to stay calm, hoping that the fight won't turn so badly.
“Harry, look at this.” said Hermione and lifted the chocolate she has received up to him. Ron copied her action despite his confusion and lifted his own half eaten chocolate close to Hermione’s.
Harry mentally quirk an eyebrow.
“I trust you.” Draco answered in a heartbeat.
He felt suffocated.
Their discussion went well. Harry was really impressed with the way Henry's mind worked; giving input when they had doubts about their plan, guiding them to make sure their plan would be successful.
“No,” Draco took a breath, “I mean, all this! Being kind to me, and paying attention to me all of a sudden. Am I that pathetic?” He choked out.
Right.
“Yes, but it's not fun without you.” said Potter softly, and Draco felt his heart slammed hard at his words.
Draco narrowed his eyes back.
“You see, Headmistress,” Albus continued, ignoring his brother exasperated face, “Our papa is currently has fallen ill, he's been cursed- a curse that turned his blood into poisons, and the only person who can save him is his very own self.”
“We've found the curse,” Draco heard Granger said as he pulled the blanket over his sleeping twins. Poor boys managed to tire themselves playing games with Blaise, Potter and Weasley. He took a glance at the small group just next to the bed; the food was long gone and now all of them gathered in a circle, each possessing transfigured pillows in their arms.
"Merlin, fine!" Harry reluctantly stepped away, regrettably letting go of his hands' new favourite place for the time being. "You don't have to be so feisty."
Honestly, Draco thought that was a rather smart thing to do for two small children. He was still impressed that the boys managed to travel back in time successfully, and he won't be that person who was going to scold their child without seeing the reason. He'll leave that to his husband in the future- poor thing must be losing his mind right now. The twins were just too clever for their own good.
Harry instantly rolled on his back, and pushed himself to sit. Eyes wide as he covered a hand over his mouth.
“Now I'm concerned,” Zabini frowned, “Did your papa willingly marry a Gryffindor?”
"You know the magic words, Lion." said Malfoy, cocking his hips to his side and resting a hand on his slim waist.
Harry fondly drew a smile as he walked towards the bed. He took a seat next to Draco, who had his eyes locked onto the ceiling, hands curled loosely around his stomach. He knew what was happening inside that pretty head of his, knew what he was thinking of. He thought that he was not worth all the hard work they put on him, because he was just a pathetic Death Eater, a person who did not deserve to be given a second chance and Harry did not want him to spend his time thinking about things that were upsetting him, things that could brought him into misery. This person deserved to be loved, and perhaps it took Harry years after the War to show him that, but right now, he wanted Draco to know-
“Yes, papa.” They answered.
However, as far as he knew, the Demon Regime was currently ruled by a new Demon King who overthrew its previous King; Voldermort. He was not one for gossip, but the war of the underworld five years ago was quite a huge scandal that even managed to reach his ear. He didn't know much about this new Demon King, but one thing that he was sure of; the Demon King possessed a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. A fact that even the Upper Officials knew. Knowing his luck, this seemingly high rank demon might be the Demon King himself.
“Ah, yes. I forgot about that part.” Harry pulled away slightly to look at Draco seriously. “I really really want you in my life, would you take the honour to be my boyfriend?”
Henry snorted, “That's your punishment for not telling me about your plan.”
“Bisexual, then.” Ron nodded, proud that he managed to conclude it for Harry.
It was when Ron personally dragged him to the common room, when he settled on his bed, when he recalled the kiss for the hundredth time that the thought had finally occurred to him; his culprit was using a strong Disillusionment Charm.
They jumped in surprise at his sudden outburst.
“That's- a really big development, Harry.” Hermione smiled, and Harry gratefully smiled back at her when he realised it. He straightened up as he looked at his friends with bewilderment.
it was, that look that was served specifically for his younger brother; gone was the smirk, or the teasing tug of his lips, or the mean stare that he kept for everyone as if they were beneath him, or the hard look on his face. It was all gone, and replaced with something that never failed to strum Harry's heartstrings because when Malfoy looked like this, he seemed ethereal.
Yes, Harry Potter was one magnificent creature. At first, Draco was attracted to his handsome face and his bloody fit body. But then, over the time, Draco was attracted to his personality and charms. Never once Draco has met a perfect man like Harry Potter.
Both of them stood there, staring into each other's eyes. Malfoy suddenly blinked, drawing a small frown on his features as he turned to steal a glance at Harry and back to stare at Henry again.
When he dragged his eyes to see their reaction, he was not disappointed; both Ron and Hermione sporting faces like someone just cast a Confundus Charm on them.
“Eat properly, Albus. The food won't disappear if you eat slowly.” said Draco, as he wiped Albus’ face with a napkin. The boy gave him a sheepish grin, taking the napkin in his hand as he slowed down his munching. Scorpius sat next to his other side, having his breakfast in silence. Draco smiled at the adorable sight of his twins.
"I just, uh." Harry scratched his cheek, thinking of a good answer and adjusted his glasses as he looked at Malfoy through his lashes. "I just want to see your condition."
“We noticed.” Hermione pointed out, moved to take a spot and sat by herself. Harry and Ron quickly followed. “They always appeared out of nowhere, and you'd looked like something possessed you.” She continued, and scrunched her face uncomfortably.
It was just a crush.
Draco lets out a huge smile at that, but quickly wince when his split lips burns. Harry stands up in an instant, bending down to inspect the injury closer. “Now I hate him more for making this beautiful lips hurt.”
Malfoy lean away, gazing over Henry's face searching for something making the older man chuckled.
Draco quickly blinked to focus, and locked his eyes to a pair of green eyes similar to Scorpius. He swallowed as he slowly spoke, “They can't go back without three things from the future.”
Ginevra laughed, clearly amused. “Well, I can see now why Harry decided to switch team.” She said in mischief as Potter suddenly spluttered vigorously next to her, “Ginny!”
Well, Harry, he just did.
“I'm just making sure!” Scorpius huffed, “Alright then, let's begin.”
"I said thank you," repeated Draco, turning to face him too. "You're being really kind to me."
Potter whistled, “Got to admire the man's enthusiasm, Ron.”
Draco threw his gaze at her, and cleared his throat, stealing a glance at beaming Potter before he answered, “Well, I'm over my mourning period now so I'm good.”
"Hm," hummed Malfoy, slightly smirking as he made a show to gracefully walk towards one of the tables, and rest his hips on top of it. "May I know why dear brother wasn't fit for the role?"
"It's almost dawn."
They followed his pointed finger, and watched as Henry was in a deep discussion with his sons, gathering them closer to him. The twins giggled and nodded at everything their Dad said. Henry put his hand on Scorpius’ shoulder, nodding to their direction and the boy immediately leap away and ran straight to Harry’s lap.
“Are you okay?” asked Draco, because the scene in front of him looked out of place in his eyes. Like there was something they were hiding from him.
Potter narrowed his eyes, unconvinced. “You sure?”
He immediately brought his eyes back to Harry and shook like a leaf when he saw Harry smirked wickedly. A flash of red appeared in his green eyes for a moment, easily breaching through Draco’s magic as he revoked his Invisible Charm. Draco hitched a breath when he saw his body turned visible, fingers apparently clutching onto Harry's shirt.
Harry snapped out when he heard a set of steps fading away into the background and quickly reassembled himself to stay focused.
There were a few moments of silence before it was broken by the loud laugh of disbelief coming from the last person Harry wanted to be in this plan of theirs.
“There you go, my answer to your question.” Draco huffed, continuing his steps. He placed down the drinks as he arrived, and hands immediately grabbed the filled glasses. He grabbed his own, taking his seat and Potter copied his movement, squeezing in the spaces between their friends as he regarded Draco with a look of concern.
“Papa is really scary when he's angry.” reasoned Albus.
Harry grinned, "So what, you kicked him out?"
"Who- what- what are you?" asked Draco timidly, he suddenly felt so small. There was no way Harry was a human, not with the power he had just displayed. He darted his eyes to where both Ginevra and Harry were before only to see that Ginevra was nowhere to be found. Heavens' luck, was he tricked?
“Blaise, go away!” Draco hissed, trying his best to shove the man away.
It was almost curfew, they sat themselves near the fireplace of the common room, having what Hermione called, ‘brainstorming'. The temperature was getting colder by the day, and whilst Ron and Hermione shared a blanket, Harry warmed himself by wearing layered clothing. If the way his friends huddled together in a comfortable manner reminded Harry of his single status, he decided to take comfort in his possible relationship with his anonymous Slytherin.
Henry turned, and gave Draco a fond smile which he returned stiffly.
He doubled his speed when he saw the door of the Great Hall, mind was set on the other side of the door that he almost broke his nose when it was abruptly opened right in his face. He stumbled forward, hands desperately searched for something just to prevent him from kissing the floor with his face and for a moment he was glad when his hand caught something that was apparently shouted in surprise when Harry pulled it towards him.
"Like a civilised person, Potter!"
In an instant, Draco felt like he was being sucked into those eyes, he can't look away. As he stared into the older man's eyes, he could see the sincerity behind them, he felt safe, and Draco knew he could trust this man with his life.
“Don't mind me, dear. It was nothing.” said Henry sweetly, and Harry rolled his eyes in annoyance.
"Harry, please have a seat."
Blaise whistled. “And they found a way for time travel.”
“Then you should stop looking at them like that!” She harshly whispered back.
Harry plopped back to his own bed, dropping a hand to his chest to feel the rhythm of his thunderous heart as he breathes;
“Malfoy, why do you keep getting into fights? I have warned you every single time, but none of those is getting in your head. You set a bad example on younger students, and it is not good for your image. What would your father says if he hears about this?”
“Malfoy…”
"Brother." he warned, but Malfoy was not having it.
"I won't let him." said Harry, grinning as he waved Parkinson away when the girl walked backwards and shot him with a finger gun. No doubts an influence from Seamus. Harry proceeded his way into the Great Hall, widening his smile when he spotted his friends at the Gryffindor table. It was unintentional, but his first step of operation on making Malfoy his was already on a good path.
Well, to think about it, he already had a hunch that his mysterious kisser might be a Slytherin seeing as they were cunning enough to pull such a scheme. Hence, Malfoy. He was powerful enough to cast a strong Disillusionment Charm, and don't even start with the chocolates. He knew that the chocolates were expensive, one that were not sold in Honeydukes and he had already eaten good chocolates from the shop.
Potter ignored his comments, but gave him a slight glare before he rubbed his face down. “Will you still hang out with us?”
“Well, where are you boys staying? I'm tired, these travelling things wore me out.” said Henry, yawning widely.
Scorpius hummed, “I don't quite remember, but I definitely will know it if I see it!”
“D-Dad?!”
"Hard work." said Harry, proudly smiling as he grabbed the present in front of him when he sat himself next to Ron. Draco had clearly stated that the presents were for all students, Harry included.
"Of course, I didn't know what exactly but they're going to launch it on the last day before the holiday." said Seamus.
“Come on, surely just for a moment?” asked the stranger, cocking an eyebrow in a very attractive manner.
Draco gave him a brilliant smile, "I will stay safe for you, darling."
Harry had enough.
“I'm asking again, do you have any excuses for yourself?” Harry repeats his question, pressing the words.
It was bittersweet, Harry thought, when a pair of lips that he knew by heart sealed the promise, when at the same time, it felt like a farewell.
Potter spluttered, “You can't do that!”
Harry gave Zabini a glare, “No offense to you, Zabini, but it's my eyes, I can do whatever I want with it.”
Never had Harry desperately wished for the ground to swallow him whole. He was pretty much sure that his face could rival ripe tomatoes now.
"Ah, you know I'm hardly civilised when it comes to you." said Harry, leaning closer as he whispered, "You make me want to act like a beast." and bared his teeth and growled playfully.
“You think?” Was the only words Draco can produce.
“Uhm, yea.”
It took a whole minute for him to understand Hermione’s implications and stared at the chocolates in a whole new light when he finally got it. This chocolate may be different from Harry's own heart shaped chocolate, may be a little less tastier than his chocolate, but he has seen them being handed out to the students by one particular Hogwarts house.
There was a small moment of silence before Malfoy scoffed, though his cheeks were pink. "You could've at least see me tomorrow, Potter. There's no need for a night escapade like this."
“Just for the night, yes.”
Before Potter could even reply, Pansy dropped her bum heavily on Draco’s lap, making the man groan at the sudden weight. “Pansy!”
Draco took a glance at Potter's kissable lips; they look tempting but Draco knows his place. “You're a cruel man, Harry Potter.”
It was weird, considering it was both of them. Sworn enemies since first years and now they were talking to one another without malice. It was really weird, but it was nice.
Sometimes the boys will look up and drag their delighted eyes throughout the Great Hall, taking the scenery around them and sometimes they will look at the students, table from table as if they were looking for something. They talked to each other, and politely exchanged conversations with some of the professors. Too engrossed with his watching, he was startled when the boy with the black hair suddenly turned his head towards their table and locked his eyes with him. The boy raised an eyebrow, his expression uncanningly reminded him of
Draco pulled out the second arrow and positioned his aim on Harry. As soon as he releases the arrow, the bond will take place and his job is done. Enhanced Magic for the entire year for his department. He grinned at that, enthusiastically pulling his bow string and launched.
His heart beating loudly that he was afraid it'll burst out of his chest. Doubled, when there was a sudden sound from the door startling him so bad that it got him to fall off his bed. He quickly climbed on, diving under his covers and fake a sleep just in time as the door was opened.
“Oh?” Draco raised an eyebrow, face clearly impressed with Harry's discreet acts. “I thought Head Student can't abused their power.”
will wait at Malfoy and the twins’ room while they execute the plan.
Harry was brought back to his senses by Draco's voice, and he blinked to see that Draco was still pretending to be interested in his inspection towards his robe, so Harry decided to be a bit cheeky. He shifted to put his weight on his right foot, and he gave Draco a look as he crossed his arms together. "You stand there half naked, and I couldn't do anything about it. Can you really blame me, though?"
Harry Potter; one gorgeous specimen ever created.
“You should call me ‘Harry’ by now, shouldn't call your boyfriend by their surname.”
What a cruel man.
He decided not to put much thought on that, though it did poked a little curiosity in him.
“Ronald!” Hermione hissed, giving the red haired boy a warning look that got him to immediately shut up, and send Malfoy his heated glares instead.
“No, no! No!” protested Harry, pulling Draco closer when he tried to escape. “You're mine, you can't go to anyone else!”
Potter looked up from munching his food, swallowing it down. “Eating?”
Was there something he missed?
“The usual. But this time it was with,” Neville pauses, twisting his face into a wince before he continues. “Dixon.”
“Bloody hell!” Weasley gaped, and Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Honestly, I don't see why that's a shock.”
Harry frowned.
Malfoy’s nose flares when Harry’s magic touch his skin, as he gives Harry deathful glares. “Don't you fucking think you can put me on a leash just because I'm dating you.”
Draco snorted, couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the remark but pleased, “I am.”
“If you don't mind me asking,” Harry heard Ginny start and he quickly turned to them. “What made Malfoy believe that you were his sons from the future?”
He squeaked and closed his eyes tightly, unintentionally tightening his grip on Henry's face. He felt Henry's hand mirrored his action by tightening their grip on his thigh, calluses palm brushing his skin that got him to moan, legs trembling involuntarily making him lose his balance and stumbled into Henry's lap.
"Do you have something to say to me?" asked Harry, carefully.
“We?” asked Malfoy next to him, huffing loudly when Albus suddenly jumped to him. “Me and Scorpius!”
"I can't believe this." commented Draco hours later as they made their way towards Slytherin's dungeon just after they had done their detention. It was fun to say the least, watching Draco grumble about the fault in the universe for making him mark the first years' essays because of a bloody kiss- here he looked at Harry with narrowed eyes, as if it was his entire fault that he had kissed Draco in front of the whole students. In his defense, it wouldn't have happened if Draco hadn't been so stubborn in the first place. He had immediately dropped a kiss on Draco’s lips when those grey eyes turned slit.
Draco scoffed immediately as he stopped on his track, throwing the man a mild irritated look when Potter has stopped and blinked at him in a questioning manner, as if he hadn't just said something offensive.
“Good. I want you to relax.” said Henry, cupping Draco’s face so they can look at each other's eyes. “Remember, I won't do anything that will displease you. Do you trust me?”
“Stop being stupid, Draco or you'll be late!” Blaise hollered, making him scoffed and moved to Potter.
“Wait, Draco!”
“Like you're looking into your future, Potter.”
Draco sip his drink as he eyed Potter, and the man raised an eyebrow at him when he noticed Draco’s staring.
Draco felt a hot rush to his face, spreading to his cheek. He stared at Weasley, flustered, as he tried to calm himself down. He can't let them see how much it bothers him now that they know his status.
The man's glasses were gleaming when the sunlight hit its surface as Potter knitted his brows together and Draco sighed looking at his confused face.
“Scorpius, proceed.” Albus instructed and the other boy nodded. They simultaneously fixed their demeanor by straightening up in their seats and placed both hands on top of their lap; a behaviour that Draco was familiar with. Whilst it amazed Draco that the two boys were in sync, it also sent him into a sudden alarmed because the behaviour was exactly what Draco would always do when he tried to convince his parents into agreeing with his ridiculous idea.
“And when I'm not?” asked Potter then, eyes turn calculating that made Draco sweat under his clothes.
"Where were you?" asked Draco, crossing his arms together, full with attitude.
"If you started with that Saviour shite and being a Death Eater again, I'm going to snog you." warned Harry, pecking on Malfoy's lips lightly just because.
Wait-
He probably won't see Potter again, the chance for them to be in each other's company are too slim and it's not like they were in the same social circle. He was a former Death Eater for Salazar’s sake.
"I guess you are."
Panicked and scared, he shut his eyes tightly and couldn't help the words that stumbled out of his mouth, "Please don't kill me, please don't kill me!"
Harry hesitated, but a tug from the twins managed to move his leg further down the door. He sent Malfoy one last look, giving him a reassurance smile before the door closed by Henry, and Harry heavily dragged his feet to follow his friends, with Malfoy’s tight smile imprinted in his mind.
“Merlin, fine!”
"What do you expect," said Albus, rolling his eyes, having an idea of what his brother was implying. "I'm part Malfoy, it's my job to annoy Potter."
He looked around for his brother only to see him standing in front of an old lady with a stern face, who was looking at him with a pair of wise eyes.
Draco Malfoy - the insufferable git who sneers at everything Muggle - was fighting, in a Muggle fucking way.
Not only that; Harry recalled the exchanged smiles every time their eyes met (
“Where's his parents?”
"Ah, yes." agreed Seamus, annoyingly draped himself around Harry. "Saw it myself, it was pretty wicked."
"I think I would master the charm myself if I had to live with a madman, don't you think so?" she raised her brows at him, giving him a pointed look.
“Potter!”
Harry can't help but gives a fond smile when he looks up at the handsome irritated face. “Seems familiar, don't you think?”
“What?” Ron gasped, “Oh no, that can't happen! Come on, Harry.” He marched, just behind the two Slytherins and Harry sighed, running his fingers through his hair.
"My, my, Potter." said Draco, tone was teasing. "We haven't had our first date yet and you want to sleep with me already."
“They must've loved you so much.” said Potter, biting his lips and looking at Draco with those eyes again, as if regarding him closely.
“I am sure there was a definite explanation regarding the sudden appearance of you both at Hogwarts and specifically at my office.” said McGonagall kindly, but her eyes were firm and calculating, darting back and forth between the two of them.
McGonagall slowly nodded, giving Harry a calculating look. "I thought it was a good thing, because it meant that his blood was pure?"
"Stop looking at me."
Draco blinked when he tapped his wrist for their matching percentage, surprised to see the numbers that popped up onto his skin and he just had to give a small amused laugh.
- he can't help but taken aback. He reached for the nearest person and continuously prodded his index finger at them, fishing for attention.
Ron, the traitor, laughed out loud. Slapping Harry's hard on the shoulder. “It was quite a sight, mate.”
So he ran.
Harry strayed him away from the War topic when he saw Draco’s eyes turned glassy, no doubt mind was thinking about what had happened. He himself didn't want to revisit the War, though his trauma and nightmares has been getting better since he has been seeing a mind healer together with Ron and Hermione.
"Thank you, love." praised Harry, kissing Draco’s cheek as a reward for defending him.
"Come and find me when you're done."
"I supposed." said Draco, feigning a nonchalant gesture making Harry laugh with his antics. What a lovely creature.
"Don't be too smug about it." said Draco.
Draco smiled and nodded. "Might as well give the students Christmas presents, right?"
In the first month, he only made sure that Potter knew he existed by giving the man a smile or saying ‘Hi' on the hallway. By halfway through the third month, Draco started showing his interest. He gave him compliments, giving him a hint of his interest and sent Potter his favourite treacle tart which became an everyday thing as Potter seemed to prefer the one that he gave- he actually baked it himself but Potter doesn't need to know that. On the fifth month, Potter acknowledged his interest towards him which made Draco attracted towards the man even more because instead of freaking out, Potter simply gave him an impressive smile; “That's cool.” he had said. On the sixth month and onwards, Draco doesn't need to hold back his flirtation. He even became good friends with Potter and his clique that made things much easier. Despite all that however, Draco made sure that he won't go overboard just in case Potter got uncomfortable. He needed his crush subject to be attracted to him, after all.
He didn't mind the isolation from other students as he already expected for it the moment he touched Hogwarts’ ground but he went through his days everyday asking if it was worth it for him to continue his life.
It was just a crush.
“We noticed.” Hermione nodded, reaching out to place a reassuring hand on his bicep as they walked out of class together. “You know we're here for you, Harry.”
“She's right, mate.”
“I supposed.” He sniffed, crossing his arms together, as he threw his gaze elsewhere. He heard the older man chuckled, and saw from peripheral vision as Henry stepped closer to him.
“Oh, Draco!”
"It's time."
"I didn't know my illness would affect him this much."
“Because!” Potter waved his hands around, opening his mouth to talk but no words seemed to come out.
“Unhand me, woman!”
Albus watched as his brother paced around the room like a headless chicken, making him grab a handful of his hair as he shouted in frustration, “Scorpius!”
"Potter," warned Malfoy.
“Liar!” Pansy coughed into her fist discreetly. Draco threw her a warning glare. “Shut up, woman!”
"Draco Malfoy."
“Pansy.” Malfoy sighed, and the girl quickly mimed zipping her mouth closed.
"That's none of your business." Henry turned to him with an unimpressed look. "You may go now, you're not needed. As you can see with your own two eyes, Draco is perfectly fine." He shooed Harry away, much to his annoyance.
“He started it first.” Henry grumbled.
"He is, professor." agreed Harry, smiling a little when he recalled the golden sparks dancing across Draco’s pale skin. Golden means purity, barely touched by others, blood pure as a virgin maiden. "It was a good thing that he was still a virgin, but-"
Why the hell did Potter suddenly look attractive?
“Is it?” asked Granger, and Draco shrugged, feeling hopeless of all a sudden but he shoved the feelings far down on where he decided not to bother.
Draco took a sip of his drink, eyes locked onto its current target; a young woman seemingly in her early twenties. She was wearing a tight short red dress that complimented her body magnificently as well as her long red wavy hair where she currently tossed the strands of those beautiful locks behind her shoulder gracefully. The action managed to capture hungry eyes that had been eyeing her in interest, but she delightfully took no notice of their attention.Instead, she put her attention to her companions, clearly having the time of her life.
Malfoy seemed to be nailed to the ground, standing like a statue. Harry watched as Malfoy swallowed when Henry halted in front of him.
Henry chuckled.
Draco waste no time as he quickly approaches the scene when one of the witches turns and cries out in relief when she sees him. “Mr. Malfoy!”
"Mysterious kisser!" hollered Seamus.
That was the first words Ginevra Weasley has said to him as soon as he joined the group back after three weeks since the incident with Potter.
Again, gasps can be heard from his friends while Zabini and Parkinson simply chuckled.
“I'm converting him, Granger.” sniffed Draco, trying to appear aloof. “Surely, you can see it yourself.”
“Geez, I'm just saying. No need to attack me.” huffed Weasley, back to digging in his food as he muttered more sulky words under his breath that definitely got ignored by the other three.
“Virgin blood.” Granger slid in and Draco nodded, “Most of the victims did not survive due to this reason. There was no way they could find their own pure blood unless they travel back in time which was what Albus and Scorpius have done.”
“You don't have to be sorry, you know.” said Parkinson, seemingly having gotten her wits together. “We only sit here together because of Albus and Scorpius. I can say this is the most civil we've been to each other.”
"What, it's still a night time?" asked Harry in surprise, dragging his eyes to look at their surroundings.
But who he was kidding. If anything, he was the one who has set his mind on Malfoy since the first time the incident happened.
"Good evening, professor." greeted Harry once he saw McGonagall peacefully sat behind her table, seeping her tea gracefully. She smiled at him when she looked up, putting her cup gently.
"I will." said Albus easily, and their younger dad gave him a nod, pet his head before he walked out the room with a purposeful stride, closing the door behind.
"Please don't remind me," groaned Harry, thumping his head on Draco’s shoulder. "My head was about to explode with all the studying."
By the time they arrived at the Great Hall, Ginny and Hermione were almost done with their breakfast. Ginny looked much better than last night, face pink as she announced that she was going to visit Malfoy and thank him in person. It took a willpower for Harry not to jump out and volunteered to accompany her to see Malfoy, but he managed to hold himself back. He was not going to look so eager in front of the Slytherin male, that would be embarrassing.
“You don't have to figure it now, don't want to hurt that pretty head of yours.” Henry grinned, patting the white-blond head.
“Oh,” said Albus innocently, “But he was a Gryffindor.”
“I think you forgot what I always told you, Potter.”
Harry stared openly at the older man with bewilderment, convinced that he finally lost it. He noticed Malfoy stepped closer to him, inch by inch until he was practically glued to Harry's back.
Harry put a hand to his chin, curling his finger as he gently lifted Draco’s head so they could look at each other. “And I can't take my eyes off you.”
The crowd of students immediately went silent at his display.
“That's me.” Harry immediately took the hand in his, and the man gave them a strong shake Harry almost stumbled to his feet. “You can call me Harry.”
Harry merely hummed, not even bothered by Draco’s heated glare as he tightened his grip on Draco, pulling him even closer than before, closing all the spaces between them. Their bodies pressed tightly onto one another, and Draco felt his face hot all of a sudden, spreading down to his neck.
“I know.”
The Slytherins, along with Ginny and Ron-
“Let me finish first!” stated Malfoy, throwing his gaze to the blank faces around him, Harry included.
“Then what?” Draco exploded, “You can't play with my feelings like that Harry Potter!”
Harry was forced back into his reality by the sudden shout of his name. He jumped, frantically looking around to realise that he was still in Potions, with an angry Malfoy glowering down at Harry.
"I wouldn't do what I did if I didn't."
"I didn't know it would leave scars!"
"Are you sure?"
"Yes, Malfoy." said Hermione, confident and clear. "I know we're not always on the same page, but we really need your help on this one."
“Perhaps, but we don't really mind about dad.” said Albus, “We’ve traveled back in time in order to save our papa.”
He waved another set of magic towards the pair, another detector for Draco to detect their movement as he turned his attention elsewhere, preferring to let the pair work on the magic by themselves without him watching like a creeper.
“You don't have to.” Henry smiled, approaching slowly. “You're safe with me.” He said kindly, but Draco remained stiff in front of him.
There was a Japanese proverb that said; 'fall seven times and stand up eight'. Where he had read it, he didn't know but what he knew was he was not going to give up.
“What?” Harry gaped, “He started it first!”
here he looked at Ron.
Harry gape as he sees Ron throws more words along the lines, Parkinson on his side with a triggered look on her face. Bunch of wands is in her fist and Harry understand now why there's no hexes been thrown. He frowns when he sees a small group of a terrified first years in between them, more when one was hiccuping hysterically as he covers a hand on his cheek.
Ginny and Hermione gasped as Ron choked into his drink. “I know that look anywhere!” Ron coughed heavily, “As much as I hate it!”
"Well," began Hermione. "I think if anyone could master the Disillusionment Charm, it would be him."
It has been going on for almost two weeks now. That bizarre things Potter did like starting to kiss Draco in his cheek every time they parted their ways instead of the other way around, compliment him every chance he got, paying attention to him when he talked, or walked him to his class when Granger was absent.
McGonagall bit her lips, thinking. "I believe, due to his magic separation with the twins. Just like during pregnancy, magical children will share the amount of their magic with their carrier until they are old enough to produce magic on their own."
Henry crooked an amused smile, “Of course.”
“So, I could give him a chance!”
He cleared his throat to cover up his embarrassment, "So, uh, how are you feeling?"
"Harry."
Draco nodded, as he nibbled on his finger and quickly sobered up before anyone saw that nervous habit of his. “They were too focused to get here, so I don't think they were even aware of it.”
Draco openly stared at Potter in shock, as it took a moment for him to comprehend. Maybe he heard it wrong. “I'm sorry, what?”
Draco choked in disbelief and blinked the tears that suddenly gathered around his eyes. He placed a hand to his wild beating heart, trying to calm them down. “You can't say things like that if you don't mean it, Potter.”
"Well, yes!"
Granger took a deep breath before she said, “Ginny is Harry's ex-girlfriend. They were going on and off their relationship, they broke up months before you came into the picture. But now that Ginny’s here…” Granger trailed off, turning her gaze away from his face to look down at the floor. “I don't know what to predict, Draco. Ginny has always been Harry's one and only.”
"That hurts!" exclaimed Harry.
"Potter!"
Draco blinked at him in confusion, but answered. “Granger and I are supposed to see Madam Promfey tomorrow morning to extract my blood. Enough to make a potion that could counter the Curse with several trials. We'll write notes, so Future Granger will know what to do.”
“Yes,” said Potter firmly.
Harry promptly paused the chocolate from entering his mouth, and stared at it in horror. “They poisoned it?!”
"You're impossible!"
He basically felt his brain disconnected.
"Fuck."
He decided to put the matters away - it's not that important anyway, and focus on his work. But he knows he's lying to himself when his eyes keep diverted back to the stack of articles.
"Well, what do you want to know?" asked Harry, grinning widely knowing that he got his little husband where he wanted him to.
"We can't!" shouted Malfoy all of a sudden, having the sudden strength to push Harry as he quickly clawed his way out of the Cloak, and away from Harry as he stepped out of the alcove.
Potter chuckled as he sips his drink, “Hm, I've heard your crush is not sure about that himself.”
“What's wrong with these chocolates?”
A man who will love him despite him being a Death Eater.
Harry put on a scolding face. "I wouldn't be here, kissing you in front of everyone in the Great Hall if I didn't like you, Draco."
Several gasped and shrieked broke out from other students who had been within Harry's hearing range.
He dropped his head on the bed, just next to his and Malfoy's intertwined hands and closed his eyes.
Harry stopped, suddenly aware that he was sobbing, tears streaming down his face. He looked up to McGonagall who appeared to be affected as well, as her eyes turned glassy. She blinked the tears away, and took a steady breath. "Harry, I am sure you have done everything you could."
"Tell me you're joking, because the day after tomorrow is the holiday." said Harry, exasperated. "I don't have much time!"
Harry had asked him about the chocolates, asked about who has been the mastermind behind the plan which got one of a hell smug look from Draco as he said; "Yours truly, of course. Father was in Azkaban now, so I can do whatever I want with the money, though the rest have pitched in too."
Somehow, they managed to fall into a civil conversation, asking the twins questions about their family and the future while the twins answered then in the most mischief way they could be without revealing anything.
“But I'm older!”
“Scorp, we've memorised it together!”
McGonagall pursed her lips with a pinched look, “You were hoping that the both of you will get the help you've wanted by meeting with the younger version of your father?”
"It was Malfoy, ain't it?" asked Ron, "Your mysterious kisser?"
Malfoy raised an eyebrow but answered, “With the kids.” He pointed, “Said he wanted to talk to them in private.”
All of them look to one another, sharing hesitated looks. A sudden jab on his side startled him, and he turned to see Hermione giving him a firm look, urging him to do something. He unsurely cleared his throat, “They've been wonderful to us. Great kids.”
“Say something, Draco.”
With that, the two small boys fell into a fit of laughter while the young adults were looking at them, horrified.
Harry frowned, “What makes you say that?”
"You two were being too supportive about this." commented Harry with narrowed eyes.
"I supposed not." said Harry, not even bothered to hide his amusement.
Harry bit his lips, a bit guilty for mentioning his father. “I probably shouldn't have mentioned your father, but this action of yours are getting out of hand, Malfoy.” He says in a soft but firm voice, knitting his fingers together as he put them on his table. “You have been in a good behavior, but ever since Dixon arrived, you stupidly go back into your old behavior, picking up fights, set up pranks. Don't you think it's enough already? You only get yourself hurt in the end!”
Malfoy nodded, pressing his lips together, “I have the same theory too, but I need to be sure.”
“Draco!” called Potter and Draco turned to him with a questioning look. “Aren't you forgetting something?”
And right now, right in front of him, were his sons. His twins, his future, his happiness and proof that he was definitely going to make it in the future. Tears began to gather around his eyes as he held it down. He shakily smiled before he asked, “Did I carry both of you myself?”
.” Henry spat, a perfect copy of the way Malfoy once did that got Harry to frown for the sudden reminder that the older man was Malfoy’s
It was the hand of a lover.
"Was there even any problem at the first place?" asked Harry, pulling away from the other male slightly to take a good look on his face. "You kissed me, and I kissed you, and if you didn't want to be with me, you shouldn't have pulled that stunt. You were the one who kissed me first."
“Are you?” Draco lifted an eyebrow.
"Merlin’s beard!”
A silly smile bloomed upon his face once the thought dawned on him. His culprit, the person who has been spending his free time kissing him mysteriously in his own cunning way turned out to be the person he harboured feelings with.
“Bloody hell!” Ron gaped.
“Come on, boys. Show me the way!” Henry sent Malfoy a wink before he started to walk, marching forward. “Let's have our discussion in our room.” He said then, gesturing to all of them.
And yet.
Draco gave her an uncertain smile, “I'm flattered?”
Harry brought his eyes to meet Henry who had his steady eyes on them. Harry drew a small frown as he addressed the older man. “Perhaps Malfoy can stay in my room too? To give you a space for yourself?”
“Definitely, Mr. Malfoy.” McGonagall let out a small reassuring smile, “As we have tested your magical signature earlier, their magical signatures matched yours.”
Draco snorted, doesn't quite believe what he just heard. “You're an idiot, do you know that? God knows why I fell in love with you.”
“I'm fooling myself, really.” Draco forced out a laugh and moved to stand. He took a step to stand in front of Potter and slap the man's shoulder.
He watched in glee as the arrow made its way straight towards oblivious Harry who had his eyes on Ginevra, giddy to see it landed on the young man.
He observed as the three men walked towards the bar, pleased to see that they were walking right towards Ginevra and her companions. When Harry was about a step away from Ginevra, Draco instantly waved his hand discreetly, and the effect was almost immediate when Ginevra suddenly stumbled off her seat right into Harry's arms who quickly caught her, hands dropped onto her shoulder and waist as he helped her up to her feet, giving Ginevra an amused smile. Ginevra appeared to be flustered, as she straightened up and Draco quickly snapped his fingers when their eyes meet, grinning when he saw his magic working right under their nose, making the two human locked their eyes in a dazed way, no doubt they were captivated by each other.
“You know,” Weasley piped in, “This has been going on for almost over a year already. Don't you think it's time to give up?”
"Are you sure?"
He sent Ron a confused look when the first years of Slytherin practically beamed at him when they caught his eyes, only to see that his friend was already by the table, waving crazily at him. Hastily, Harry marched towards him, blinking when Ron gestured at their table where hundreds of small packaged chocolates were literally lined up on the Gryffindor's table. He frowned, dragging his eyes around the Great Hall to see a similar situation seemed to take place.
“And by sheer dumb luck, trust and faith, the both of you decided to travel back in time without thinking of the danger and the consequences of your action.”
“Right, then let's do it.” said Pansy, grinning excitedly making Draco smile at her. It was nice to see her interested in something.
"Well, I'm trying!" said Harry, throwing his hands in the air. "But he kept avoiding me, and just looked at those Slytherins hanging around him."
Malfoy looked up to him, expression fond and he took his gaze up from Harry's forehead, his eyes, his cheeks before they landed on his lips. "Do you even like me, Potter?"
He can't ruin this now. He needs to be patient, because if his culprit and his crush were the same person… Well, he doesn't know what to do yet, but he will figure out something.
The arrow was about to hit its target when he caught a devilish smirk upon Harry's face, and it was the only warning he received before Harry effortlessly plucked the arrow mid-air, inches away from his face and turned to lock his eyes with Draco.
As if it was his purpose to prove Ron wrong, Harry was yanked backwards out of nowhere, strong but not to the point that it was hurting him. Hands firmly taking a grip on each side of his face before he was pulled into a fierce open mouth kiss that got Harry struggling for breath through his nose.
"Potter, you don't understand-"
“Hey, you two! Why don't you take a break for a moment?” called Parkinson over the fireplace but got dismissive waves from both Hermione and Malfoy.
Granger flicked him off, hooking her arms with Draco as they started to walk away.
One would say that he was only an empty shell of a man that used to live for the mere purpose of existence. He has no purpose, moving like a loving corpse, only breathing to execute his role as a King.
“Darling, don't encourage him.” sighed Henry.
“We have a theory that there might be a possibility that the curse might've been casted on you since after the war.” explained Henry, as he turned serious. “The healer said that the curse has been slowly poisoning your blood for a long time but we haven't got the real timeline of when the curse was casted. However, there was a huge possibility that someone may have casted them on you around this timeline."
“Alright!” Scorpius exhaled loudly, “Sorry, I'm just very nervous about this.”
“Draco Malfoy,” said Potter softly, as he gave Draco a fond smile. “It's hard not to fall for you when you keep pursuing me like that! It's been hell for me not seeing you for almost a month, and it was all because of my stupid action!”
"At least he was apologising to you, right?"
“And I'm interested in you, could you give me a chance?” asked Draco, tilting his head in a challenging manner.
To say that he was stunned by the sudden change of situation was an understatement.
A man who will accept him for who he is.
He sighs again.
By the time Harry got back, he was surprised to see the absence of his younger self. He raised a brow when a pair of grey eyes fiercely glared at him from where he sat on his bed, state the same as he left him; half naked with his robe covering his exposed skin.
“Almost forgot!” exclaimed Draco, ran towards the man and quickly bent down to paste a kiss on his cheek, “Stay safe, Love!”
“Here!” He shoved it at Draco excitedly, “It was us!”
"You found him?!" cried both Ron and Hermione at the same time and just then Harry realised that he hadn't told them about it. He quickly gave them a sheepish smile, adjusting his glasses.
“I am sorry for my action, Mr. Potter and friends.” said Albus, managing to sound genuine. His brother, who stood next to him smiled politely, “We are very sorry, Albus did not mean to hurt your feelings.”
"That's ridiculous!"
“Boys, what are you doing?” He heard Malfoy’s hitch voice, clearly taken by surprise by their actions.
“If you think the Slytherins were up to something, you were right.” Dean jumped in, holding up a hand when Seamus tried to protest. “I think they were up to mending back the houses together, Merlin knows how much the war has broken us.”
This is the moment, this is the sign for him to stop pursuing Harry Potter. He wanted his reasons, and now he got it.
"Ah, you know about it!" laughed Seamus gleefully.
Hermione huffed in irritation, “Well, which house do you think has been giving chocolates for the past two weeks?”
The man sighed in defeat, “Alright, but you know where to find me.” he said, smiling at Draco with his predator smile that got him to grinned with appreciation.
What he remembered instead; crawling towards the body of his lover with all his might when his body gave up on him. He remembered the dimmed light of the grey eyes greeted him proudly. He remembered the slight tug of the lips he adored when he managed to reach him. He remembered the shaky long fingers that tried to caress his face for the last time.
“Draco,” He calls softly.
He helplessly watched as the lights danced around his lover's body, taking him particles by particles, and closed his eyes when the last particles of lights brought his lover away from him forever between its sparkles.
"What do you want from me?"
Harry rubs his face and stands up, moving around his table to kneel in between Draco parted leg. He takes Draco’s hand into his gently, warily watch as Draco had his face facing the window again.
The next day, even more bizarre things happened during breakfast. The moment Harry entered the Great Hall, the entire Slytherins clan have already invaded their table, having breakfast together while chattering amongst themselves. Throwing warm smiles to every student that entered the Great Hall, their little action managed to put other houses in wary, Harry included.
They looked into each other's eyes and with a nod, Scorpius began the incantation and Albus followed. They recited the spells over and over again, overlapping each other's voices until a soft glow emerged through the possessions, creeping towards their bodies, seeping through their clothes and skins. The lights were becoming brighter and brighter around them, and Albus quickly held onto Scorpius’ hand when they felt the pressure of air pressing from all directions, sucking their bodies into thin air leaving two wands clucking innocently down the floor.
Harry had to look up at him, brows furrowed as he dragged his eyes in between the identical faces; Malfoy wore his hair short, while Leo had his hair long- chest length where he had loosely tied them behind his neck. They were identical, very much identical that it was hard for Harry to differentiate them the first time he met them back in their first year, save for their eyes. They were separated however, when Malfoy sorted into Slytherin whilst Leo was sorted into Gryffindor. That was how they became friends after all.
"I am," grinned Harry, feeling cheeky as he added, "For you."
Harry adjusted the grip on his Invisibility Cloak around him tighter with one hand, the other multitasking as he balanced his wand and the Marauder's Map securely. It was after midnight, hours after the whole scenario back at the common room; the main reason why he was out of his bed, why he had waited patiently for everyone to fall asleep before he sneaked out, walking alone through the empty dark hall straight towards his main purpose: the Hospital Wing.
Weirdly enough, as bizarre as it sound, Harry had replied to his letter, for he was suddenly reminded of Malfoy's wand that was still in his possession. Seeing that he doesn't see any reason for keeping the wand, he had sent the wand back to his owner hoping that Malfoy would understand it was serve as a peace offerings which led to Malfoy writing back to saying that it was impossible for the wand to recognise him as the owner unless he took it back from Harry's own hand which led to Harry being invited to the Manor and that was the last time Harry saw the Malfoys.
“Sorry, Albus, Scorpius. I didn't mean to scare you.”
“Draco!” Harry groaned, “Come on, I'm dying to kiss you!”
Draco scoffed, managing to cross his arms even as he was laying down the bed. "Well, I don't feel like I want to know something, so you can take your arm away."
Malfoy's eyes went slightly big at that. "At night?"
Of course when he'd actually set his mind on something, it wouldn't go as he planned. He had tried, so hard to get Malfoy's attention but apparently he had to compete with other Slytherins.
Harry rolled his eyes, "I heard you that night."
Malfoy frowned, “I don't speak to you, Weasley.”
"I know," said Draco, "But he won't stop apologising to me even when I said that I already forgive him. Stupid Gryffindor."
Easier said than done.
"I'm- I'm proud o-of you," his lover had whispered.
“How old are you both, anyway?” asked Ginny.
"Don't forget the chocolates she mentioned!" exclaimed Ron.
His twins will soon be going back to where they belong, far out there in future. Back to their real parents, the future him and his husband. Until then, he will wait patiently, and accept everything that he will have to get through to reach up that future later.
"Well," began Harry, ignoring Seamus. "I did and I forgot to tell you about it because that damn git was hard to approach!"
“Granger, my kiss!” He protested, trying to halt his step but he underestimated Granger’s strength.
Both of them looked up to their father's stunned face. His grey eyes dart rapidly between the two of them, as if the situation was too bizarre to be comprehend.
“Blimey, mate.” whispered Ron, “It must be the end of the world if Malfoy suddenly turned soft.”
They waited for the Map to appear, eyes immediately sought for their dad's name and cringe in an instant when they saw where he was headed.
“What are you talking about?” asked Malfoy, seemingly back to himself, face free from pinky dust.
Before Draco can answer, a hand snaked possessively around his waist, pulling him to collide with a sturdy chest. “That would be my job, thanks.”
Draco smiled, touched. “It's just a crush, Hermione.”
“Slytherins!”
Draco suddenly felt his heart turned heavy when he saw two little frowns on his sons’ faces. “Well,” He gulped down the sudden lump in his throat and reached out to touch his sons’ cheek. “My future husband sounds wonderful and he's going to give me two beautiful boys! Oh, I love him already!”
It has been two days after their incident in front of the Great Hall and Harry was desperate. It doesn't help that it was a few more days until Christmas holiday, and his plan was nowhere forward. Plus, he knew Malfoy had been avoiding him, using the Slytherins as his shield, turning the other way every time his eyes landed on Harry.
“Let's go home, Draco!” She slurred, clearly drunk her arse. Draco sighed, as he rubbed his temple. Another heavy weight suddenly falls on his back, choking him into nothing.
He was their dad.
Draco sighed heavily. Looks like he can throw away his plan to avoid Potter out to Hogwarts’ window. He was definitely not going to ruin his sons’ plan and if he had to speak to Potter, he won't think twice about it.
Well, if he managed to track him back, that is.
He had asked Seamus about it, but apparently Parkinson had spent less time with him, saying something about house unity that didn't make sense to the Irishman since she has been ignoring him. Harry could only patted him in sympathy, not that he had any luck with his own.
"But I thought you wanted me to let go of you?" Harry tilted his head, aiming for an innocent look but he could hardly conceal the smile from forming seeing Malfoy's irritated face.
"I mean, I know I'm handsome and all but you could have at least agreed to go out with me."
Draco ran his fingers through his hair, and locked his eyes to her. “I did say I'll stop once he got himself fall for someone.”
The information suddenly made Draco light headed. All this time pursuing Potter, telling the man that he will stop once he has fallen in love. It was a bad joke on his side, wasn't it?
Draco waited anxiously as Henry closed the door. It was not that he was scared of the older man, it was more of an overwhelming feeling. He can't help but feel nervous around the man, like he doesn't know what to do with himself.
Ginevra Weasley.
"I just did." said Malfoy.
The hot breath retreated as fingers reached out his fringe, brushing up his strands of hair to the side and he felt a finger caressing his scar in a soft manner it lulled Harry into a sleep. Harry was almost pulled into the dreamland when a soft voice snatched him back.
“I-I thought you would be happy?” asked Potter, perplexed.
- Zabini had snorted at that but he didn't disagree.
"Good morning to you too." replied Malfoy, bringing both of his hands to rest it on his lap, and Harry immediately felt warm spreading through his cheek knowing that Malfoy probably has woken up to their intertwined hands, and making no fuss about it.
As if on cue, Hermione and Ginny walked through the door of the Great Hall, several students from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff followed in. There were boxes that were levitating behind them, as they purposely walked towards the Slytherin table. Harry followed their movement with his eyes, noticed how everyone in the Great Hall had the look of anticipation on their faces except for the Slytherin who was watching the commotion with confusion.
“And here I thought you'll take this chance to get to know me better!” frowned Potter playfully, making Draco chuckled at the ridiculous face the man has made.
His sons.
"It was rude of you to assume that I would eat those chocolates without your kisses in exchange."
“Explain before I get angry!” Draco frowned angrily at the man in front of him, crossing his arms together to show his displeasure.
“Why not just use your blood from your future self, then?” asked Ginny.
"What!" exclaimed Harry, legs instantly halted as he wildly took his surroundings but Malfoy was already gone. He gritted his teeth in annoyance as he shouted, "You can run, but you can't hide!"
Harry took a deep breath and nodded, "I know he will be."
Great kids?
Now, Harry can't help but worries. Going for Dixon is like going for a suicide. No one had the balls to go up against Dixon, as he was vile, vicious and violent - Ron called him the Three Vs - and he's not hesitate to use heavy curses on the students. Merlin knows how many students he has sent to the hospital wing. Not even a warning from Harry's own mouth manage to stop him.
He had ignored the ugly feeling inside his chest, and proceeded to lead his army into the Palace of Voldemort with a sole motivation of achieving victory, defeat the Death Eaters and overthrown the King's throne.
“You've got to stop doing that, mate!”
As if he can't be pathetic enough.
His mind was rather preoccupied today.
He halted his steps and leaned his body against the wall, raising a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose as he forced himself to stay focused. This was not the time to be pathetic. His family needed him, his sons needed him, and Draco needed him. He heaved a determined breath at that, pushing his body away from the wall and continued his journey towards McGonagall's office.
“Don't tempt me, Sweetheart.” Harry hotly whispered, licking a spot just below his ear.
“I'm glad I amused you.” Draco grumbled, slightly annoyed.
He couldn't help but smile as he recalled that they had made love for the first time to each other that night; whispering forgiveness into each other's lips, confessing their desires, and secrets between wandering hands, eyes never leave one another.
Henry raised an eyebrow, and rolled his eyes when he saw the look on Harry's face. “Oh, please. Spare your Saviour trait on me, I won't do anything unpleasant to Draco. He's my husband for Merlin’s sake.”
“Yes, but you're a bloody virgin!”
“Well,” Draco began, “If anything, I know that your dad got green eyes,” He winked at Scorpius, “And a horrendous black hair.” He then gave Albus’ hair a good ruffle which sent his sons into a good fit of giggles before he came into a horror realisation.
Potter smiled in satisfaction as Draco stood in front of him, presenting his cheek to Draco  and tapping it lightly. “You forgot your kiss.”
What was he joking, even with all that, Potter won't look at him. He was a straight man. He was just too stupid to keep trying.
Draco recognised the look on Potter's face when Ginevra simply turned to him, or acknowledged his presence. That was exactly what Draco looked like when Potter did the same to him.
“Well?” Draco pressed, when Potter only stood there mimicking a goldfish. He waited patiently as Potter gulped, eyes searching into Draco’s eyes before he shut it tightly.
His eyes widened, thrilled that his own suspicion from the last few weeks are now confirmed. Oh, he can't wait to catch this culprit of his.
Harry, who was currently rummaging through his own rucksack, nodded in acknowledgement, though he mentally relieved that he did not put any suspicious items - that could have risked revealing his identity - in the rucksack. "Thank you for doing that. I really forgot about it altogether, what's with seeing you and dealing with everything."
"Well, obviously," said Draco, throwing him a look. "You didn't see him here anywhere, did you?"
"Da- uh, Mr. Potter!" said Albus too loudly than necessary with a terrible wide smile.
It took a few moments for Draco to comprehend the man's words.
“Potter, you're supposed to cut it vertically, not horizontally!”
He sent his sons a look just to see if they can crumble under his gaze but to his amusement, they did not wavered as they fixed a comical smile to him. He decided to let it go and shrugged, making no fuss about it. Besides, Draco did not mind if his sons were fans of Harry Potter. The git did save the Wizarding World after all. Also, now that Draco thinks about it, the plan was not that bad. In fact, it was the only plan that Draco thought they could manage without consuming more time than necessary. They were racing with time after all.
“Blood?” Hermione tilted her head, knitting her brows together the way she always does when she tried to pick an information inside her head before she gasped, “Was it Blood Curse?”
"Oh, no. It's fine." Harry shook his head, "Sorry, I just remembered something." He sought Ron's eyes as he said it, and gave him a stare when his friend stared back in confusion. He sighed in exasperation when Ron didn't seem to understand his innuendo so he waved him dismissively, and buried himself under his blanket.
Twins.
He swallowed. “Are you, are you saying that I managed to convert you?” He asked dumbly, unnoticed on how his voice suddenly turned croaky.
"You're impossible." said Draco as he shook his head. He brought his eyes to gaze on Harry's face, and Harry raised an eyebrow at that.
"Oh, he can talk."
“No!” Harry quickly denied when Ron got into his defensive mode. “I was- He was just-” Right, why was Malfoy angry with him? Ah, yes. “He was just frustrated that I haven't paid attention to Potions.”
If Harry got to be honest, it felt a little empty without the Slytherins' mischievous treat colouring the school. It was actually sad to see some of the students from other houses put the blame entirely on Slytherins for what has happened; as if there was no traitors from Gryffindor, no Death Eater from Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff.

“But it's true!” She continued, “Ever since Albus and Scorpius were here! Being a father made them want to get on with you.”
This was Henry, after all.
“Yea.” answered Harry mindlessly.
“They- they remind me of-"
Their conversation was cut out by the sudden loud ruckus from the portrait hole and they turned as Seamus and Dean stepped out, talking significantly followed by Neville, who's hand around Ginny’s shoulder, who looked rather pale. They stood in an instant, alarmed, and Ron immediately made a straight line towards his sister.
Harry cracked a grin, “I can imagine.”
And a lightning bolt scar appeared on the man's forehead before he was pulled into a heated kiss.
"And being with me is something you don't deserve?"
He follows the sound of the baby, and feels his heart squeezed painfully when he sees them in the arms of a stressful witch, surrounded by a few wizards and witches who probably tried to calm the baby down themselves and failed.
"You found out about the curse years after he gave birth, and his magic collapsed then. What about when you said it finally took a toll on him?"
“May I sit?” asked Potter, gesturing to the empty space next to him and Draco can only nod.
“Doing what?!”
"Potter!" gasped Malfoy, tightening his grip on Harry's shoulders.
"What happened to you?"
Henry snorted and rolled his eyes. "As if I would be jealous of you."
“I'm not scared.” replied Draco, and he should be proud that he managed to say it calmly. “I'm just nervous.”
“What?!” They exclaimed in unison.
Now that the situation has settled down, it dawned on Draco that he has never even taken care of a baby in his entire life before, let alone held a baby. He didn't know what possessed him to go and try to console the baby - he can't even believe he's holding a baby now. This would be his first time, and now that the baby has fallen asleep, he had no idea how he managed to carry the baby in his arms without dropping him.
Harry chuckled, knowing full well what his little husband was saying. "Ah, was it about your scars?"
He snapped out, and looked up to Malfoy’s expectant face. “Uh, well- I uh, I just-"
"Give me a good reason."
“I need you to undress, Draco.”
He knew he wouldn't be that kind of parent who proclaimed a study room as a forbidden room for their child because that was what his Father did and he doesn't want to raise his children with the same environment. Therefore, he needed to be smart.
Harry stared at his friends with his jaw hung loose, gobsmacked, as he asked with a hitched voice. “You noticed?!”
"Exactly, mate." said Ron, stepping forward to slap Harry's shoulder but hit Seamus' arms instead as they were draped around Harry's shoulder. He ignored the cries from the Irishman as he gave him a determined look. "Go and get him."
“Do your worse.”
“Oh.” Draco says, and nothing else. Not that he got anything else to say, knowing that the baby - James - in his arms was actually Potter's son managed to make him tongue tied.
“He doesn't care, Potter.” He says in a cold monotone voice. “You, of all people should know.”
“It's really good to see you in person! Well, we've seen each other before that but I haven't had the chance to meet you officially.” said Ginevra, smiling all the way and Draco doesn't know what to do with that. So he smiled back, “I've been a bit busy lately.” He reasoned.
“Perhaps we should take this matter to my office.”
Malfoy who heard the words, instantly nodding his head. “Yes, yes. I can do that. You can have the room all by yourself, Henry.”
"Shut up," said Draco, and gave Harry a light slap, but curled his body closer, getting comfortable in Harry's arms. "Now tell me what about Albus and Scorpius when they were three."
“Now, say sorry to Mr. Potter and his friends.”
Green eyes and grey eyes.
“We stay with papa, we go to our own room!” Albus announced.
Harry sobbed, turning to face his lover's beautiful face for the last time and dropped a chaste kiss to the parted pair of lips lovingly, before he turned towards the sparkles and lights. "Please let him be where he meant to be. Please take care of him for me."
“But Hermione said she's your one and only.”
"Hence, accidental magic." mumbled Harry, getting a grasp of what the Headmistress has been saying.
Since when he has developed this kind of feeling towards Malfoy, he doesn't know. He didn't dare to put any assumptions of what kind of feeling he was having. He took the comfort that perhaps, this time around, Malfoy and him can build a better relationship; like friends, maybe.
“He's alive!” Albus cried out happily.
Harry paused at that, not knowing where the future's information stood about their friendship. He forgot to ask his twins about that part. But then, he decided to at least tell him the truth about it. "Well, yes. The both of you were friends, in the future."
Henry looked up as Draco stopped on his underpants. “Do I need to take this off too?” He asked, trying to tame down the flush of red that was slowly creeping up his face. Merlin, but he has never been fully naked in front of anyone before.
“I’m afraid so, Mr. Malfoy.” said McGonagall, voice uncharacteristically kind and patient.
Harry's smile widened, eyes appeared mischievous as he answered, "You."
Harry hears the sound of cheers and shouts before he sees the commotion. There was a large crowd right in front of the Great Hall, as chants of names were thrown but Harry can hear who's name dominates the chanting.
Whilst Harry Potter doesn't seem to mind that Draco flirted with him, showing him his interest or his declaration of his admiration towards the man- he even played along upon entering the seventh month of Draco’s crush on him- there's a slight problem with that.
“Ah,” Henry grinned, waltzing closer to Malfoy and draped his hand around his shoulder. “You're going to stay here, with me.”
They went to class like usual after that, and Harry unconsciously sought for the empty seat of Malfoy in every class they shared, feeling like something was lacking with the absence of the other male.
“What happened?”
He knows he said the wrong thing when Draco tries to pluck out his hand off Harry’s but he keep on a tight grip. Draco stops once he realise his effort was pointless.
He looked around to see Ron and Zabini already munching down their own food with Parkinson in between them.
Malfoy, looked mesmerizing, somehow.
Henry snickered, and Harry sent him a death glare.
The finger stopped their movement on his scar, and a hand landed on his cheek, just resting. "I… I know, I'm a coward for doing it this way. It's wrong, and- and really, I just- what am I doing?"
It has been an hour since they've started their reading, he should give them a break already. He put down his book before he gave his son a teasing smile, “Well, why didn't you tell me then?”
“I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh.” said Henry once he calmed down. “Your face was just adorable. I can't help it.”
There's a deep sigh followed, and Harry intently listened to the steady rhythm of inhaled and exhaled that followed.
Merlin.
"Potter." interject Malfoy, with a small genuine smile back on display. "I understand."
Never once did Draco feel so self insecure until now. He glanced at his pale skin. That's him; nothing seemingly pretty about him. Pale skin, blond hair with grey eyes. Dull colours.
He repressed a smirk, forcing his body to stay flaccid and continue to listen to the hushed conversation that was getting closer and stop in front of his bed.
“Oh, papa was not that eager to know who his husband is in the future.” Scorpius shrugged, though a small smirk decorated his face. “He was just trying to help us as much as he can, and make sure that we get what we wanted for coming this far by ourselves.”
Harry calmly breathed out, while screaming out loud in his head. His culprit was just a few steps away from him and it took him a willpower to stay limp in his bed. His hand made a sudden jerk, muscle protesting for his lack of movement and he's praying to Merlin that he didn't notice that.
Automatically, Draco sought a hand to caress their heads gently by turn. “Yes, I don't want to leave them alone.”
Now it was Draco’s turn to be confused, “Why not?”
That was an hour ago and now Ginny and Parkinson went to hunt for food, while Harry, Ron and Zabini took their spot next to the bed doing nothing. The small crowd near the fireplace haven't looked up from the book; Hermione jotting down notes on a parchment as Malfoy doing the same. They will read it while discussing and give each other their insights. The twins latch up on their father as usual, Scorpius pointing out what he has read before while Albus agreed.
“I think we can manage that but you might not like it, papa.” said Scorpius sneakily while Albus lets out a small smirk, lifting up his head in a confident manner. Draco arched an eyebrow suspiciously. “Care to elaborate?”
There was a moment of silence after that as everybody practically dropped their jaw, including Zabini and Parkinson.
Memories of soft lips against his vanished in an instant as Harry snapped out of his thoughts. He blinked rapidly until his eyes refocused on Malfoy who was watching him with a slight frown on his face.
Draco sighed when the twins continued to bicker so he moved to wrap his hands around his twins, “Whoever kisses me first, can have the wand.”
He spent his time looking at the Marauder's Map for a few minutes, just until Parkinson and Zabini left the Hospital Wing, and until he was satisfied with what he saw. He put down the map under his pillow just in time as his friends were back, waiting as they dressed up while exchanging jokes and small talk.
Thinking back, everything he did will always strayed towards Malfoy by the end of the day. Merlin, he defeated Voldermort with Malfoy's wand, and let's be honest; despite everything that has happened, he'll take Malfoy in anytime if they were given a chance.
“Great!” The twins delightfully beamed. “Let's go now!” Scorpius scrambled off Harry's lap, pulling his hand to stand up.
“We did! We can't believe it ourselves either!” Albus grinned.
Ron scoffed at that, “What complete bullshit you are.”
With that, he pulled himself together and slowly blinked his eyes open, and subtly dragged his eyes to Harry's forehead. He let out a sigh of relief when he saw it was free from the infamous scar.
Really, now?
“How on earth did you manage to find a man like that?” asked Parkinson, her voice dripping with amazement.
The boy grinned, “We were wondering if we can sleep with you tonight.”
"Dad's coming!" squeaked Albus all of a sudden that got Scorpius to panic, jumping for the Invisibility Cloak in an instant once he saw it and draped it over himself just in time as their younger dad walked in with a troubled look.
"Indeed she is." said Harry, gazing down Malfoy's face fondly.
What the fuck just happened?
It has been almost a week after the commotion on the Great Hall and he can't see Malfoy without two little boys on his tail. The two boys will always hang around him, worshipping him as if Malfoy was the center of their world. Honestly.
His eyes fell on the lone occupied bed, curtains were fully retracted to ensure the privacy of the occupant and he quickly made a beeline towards it. He folded the Marauder's Map into his back pocket, along with his wand as he stepped closer, and draped his Invisibility Cloak by the foot of the bed.
"You really thought I wouldn't know?"
“Perhaps, both of you know me too?” A voice of a girl interject, crouching down next to their father and they immediately brightened, “Aunt Pansy!”
Scorpius repressed a yelp when he saw their younger dad grabbed a pillow, lifted it up revealing the old parchment that was tucked innocently just on the corner of the bed, right on where he was currently standing, thank Merlin it was away from their dad's view. He carefully reached out, slipped out a hand and tugged it off, and quickly hid it under the Cloak as he quickly moved to the other side of the room, and stood still, leaving his twin brother to deal with their dad.
"He doesn't tell." answered Albus, "Something about papa's body." he shrugged, dismissive.
Draco frowned, “What do you mean?”
Oh, why does he feel like he can't breath all of a sudden? His sight on Granger getting blurry, as he struggled for air.
“It's chocolate!” The red haired protested.
“He is a fan of Harry Potter, papa.” said Albus without a beat and smiled, far too innocent for Draco’s taste.
"Harry Potter needs my help." said Malfoy, a smirk appeared on his face as he started to walk teasingly towards him but stopped in front of his brother.
Sure, maybe there were other blokes who got the same genetic traits but the twins just narrowed it down for them.
Potter gave a sigh, but his eyes were soft. “I believe Hermione only sees what she sees. I am comfortable with Ginny out or in our relationship but like I said before, it was a long time ago. In fact, I can consider her as one of my best friends now.”
Pansy and Blaise hot on his tail; Pansy worried face mirrored Blaise while the Weasley siblings stayed on their spot, looking agitated. It took Granger a moment to process Draco’s implications before she hitched a breath, “Oh, Merlin.”
"We found Draco!"
Harry watches as Ron and Parkinson carefully help Malfoy up to his feet, and Harry quickly hold up a hand. “Ron, you and Parkinson need to follow Hermione as witnesses. Malfoy, you come with me.”
“Thank God for that then,” Weasley nodded approvingly at him. “Because you see, Harry’s been- ugh!” He suddenly coughed, holding onto his stomach, as Potter faked a loud laugh, patting on Weasley’s back rather harshly in Draco’s eyes. “You shouldn't speak while eating, Ron!”
Apart from that, he had also gone to meet McGonagall to express his thoughts, but whilst she had given him a rather strange twinkle look, all she said was,
