“I don’t plan for these things to happen, you know.”
As it is, Harry’s not as surprised as he is to find Draco here— not with the blanket that’s currently still wrapped around his shoulders. “You’re cleaning,” he says, throat feeling a bit raspy.
His stomach is in knots and his palms are cold-sweaty and they are suspended in what could be seconds or lifetimes before Harry breaks and, fueled with liquid-courage, presses his lips against Draco’s.
Months of pent-up longing urges him on and with each slippery stroke of his hand and each sound ripped from his throat, Harry’s guilt and shame blends with desperation and yearning. His hand speeds up, flying up and down his throbbing flesh. It’s a blur of movement as he thrusts into it, arse clenching as he brings his hips up. Legs shaking from the exertion, he fucks into his hand, the dirty squelching noises of lube and foreskin only egging him on.
“Doing what?” Fingers fumble on buttons and zips, and it’s doubly hard to focus when Draco, despite his words, is apparently trying to get him undressed. Not to mention there’s a sinful mouth attached to Harry’s neck—nibbling and licking and making him—
She almost sounds disappointed.
He still doesn't let go.
Draco frowns, dragging speculative eyes from Helios to Harry. “Like you, then?”
Still, he knows the look that Draco’s sent him is well-deserved, and Harry tucks his hands into his pockets, which will probably protect him from getting either poisoned or burned. Or hexed. Or all of the above.
Harry breathes against the light pressure on his lips. "Yes."
Draco frowns at Harry’s unbuttoned jeans. “When have you ever been the more sensible one?”
Beside him, Draco tips some meticulously shredded roots into their cauldron. The potion bubbles, and another gust of
Draco steeled himself and nodded.
“You are,” Harry answers, his mouth twitching into a smile.
“The point, Harry,” Lavender presses on, “is that it’s not a big deal. Whether Draco’s avoiding you or not, he can’t keep hiding forever. Either he comes out of his potions cave or you come barreling in.”
“Oh, fuck off.”
With a sweep of his wand, Harry directs the flow of light to Draco’s circle of mayhem. Draco’s shoulder-length hair is tied at his nape, and from where Harry’s sitting it’s gleaming—it’s as bright as the sun and Harry knows looking too long and too closely will just hurt his eyes, burn the image on the back of his lids, but he still does it anyway.
one?”
“Damn it, I should have called that,” Lavender ignores him, obviously doing some mental computation.
makes him feel quite giddy even after three years, and it doesn’t really help his situation any.
“Nngh—”
Draco chuckles lowly and murmurs against his lips. “Eager.”
He comes with a low groan, coating Harry’s stomach and his cock, making the slippery slide of his hand feel almost electric. His hand speeds up, tugging and twisting as Harry writhes underneath him, meeting every slide of Draco’s hand, the friction of their cocks rubbing against each other agonizing and wonderful and mind-blowing and
“Your forearms,” Harry points out.
“No, seriously, where did we go?”
It’s for him and Draco. Not for anyone else. ‘We don’t owe them anything,’ he whispers, just for the two of them. And as he straddles Draco’s hips, watches the uncertainty and questions gradually fade and burst into delight and affection and love as grey eyes watch him, Harry feels warmth explode in his chest alongside the courage that makes his voice fill the room. ‘What are you waiting for, Malfoy?’
“Still doesn’t prove that he’s not hiding,” Lavender says.
“Prowling about, I’d wager.”
He unclasps the top button of his shirt. His sleeves are rolled above his elbows but his forearms are still moist with perspiration. "You know, this would go a lot faster if you let me help."
Harry cannot help but quirk a smile. “I’m glad you approve.”
“You look terrible.”
“I can handle it. It was just—” Harry eyes dart to the calendar by the kitchen door— the last thing he remembers looking at before he found himself on the living room floor— and his gaze lingers only for a few heartbeats before it darts back to his mug of hot chocolate. “Just a bad morning.”
Harry considers this for a moment before answering. “Better,” he decides. “Thanks.”
“They’re doing a collaboration, did you hear?”
“You’re right,” Harry told Draco, his tone careful and a little wary, “I don’t know what it feels like,” his hand tightened its hold on Draco’s, thumb rubbing over smooth skin, “But I know what it feels like to lose someone you love. Someone who loves you. And I think that counts for something, don’t you?”
Harry bites back a sigh as he is half-dragged towards the hospital wing with one, lean arm around his waist.
“You are aware that this is Apollo we’re talking about and not you, are you not?”
Harry glances at Draco with a raised brow. “How is your hand already cold?”
Your grip tightens on the haphazardly-wrapped package in your hand. “
It’s of little to no surprise when Harry learned first-hand that Neville’s rooms are filled with strange, unusual plant life. Accepting the Herbology post has only encouraged his friend’s enthusiasm for horticulture, and though sometimes Harry’s concerned about his questionable rearing practices, he’s happy that Neville’s managed to settle into his own, not-so-little niche. Having shared a dorm with him for seven years, Harry hardly blinks now when he discovers that the strange plant that’s been trying to knot his laces together turns out to be a thin, brightly colored, vine-y thing. It’s finally given up and is now wobbling past him, only to plop itself in front of Lavender Brown’s feet.
Draco looks at him, and Harry’s body lights up like an  inferno. The air pulses between them, and Draco releases a shuddering breath before he closes his eyes. He rests his forehead against Harry’s and takes several calming breaths. It’s a span of heartbeats before he speaks. “I want you.”
Draco stills. “Excuse me?”
“You should probably stop for a while,” Harry offers, too quiet for Draco to hear.
“Neville must have a lot to say about that,” Draco shudders. “I, for one, have had enough of flying pots for one evening, thanks.”
He leans against Harry as he allows himself to be directed back to the couch.
The edge of the cream-coloured couch draws Harry’s eyes, as always, as the bright lights from the fish tank casts pretty colours on it, and evidence of Poseidon being recently fed floats around the now-green water. The quiet, mechanical buzz of the air pump only adds to the mixture of noises that Harry has long acquainted to
"Draco—"
Neville perks up, and Harry thinks maybe he should have just let him keep choking on his bloody pumpkin juice. “Three Galleons that Harry caves before Monday.”
“Better?” Draco asks.
Harry decides to take mercy on him. They have all the time to be twitchy and awkward tomorrow. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”
“…Draco?”
“You really do spoil him too much,” Draco sighs, parts-exasperated and parts-amused.
His mind flies off to familiar memories of Draco’s hands moving swiftly over his cauldron, steady and sure, and he tries to replicate Draco’s firm grip as he handles the pestle and brings it down over and over. He recalls the controlled flick of Draco’s wrist when he throws all sorts of pretty and odd and colorful things into his cauldron, making the room heated and suffused with interlacing scents, just as he makes Harry’s blood boil and his skin flare with unrivalled desire.
Draco looks at him, and his face is doing something Harry doesn’t even know how to describe. Harry likes to call it his thinking face but Draco disagrees. Not that that’s anything new. Draco waves his wand and the
Light spills through the open door, warm as the sound of laughter that fades to a soft hum as he slips his arms around you.
“Yes or no, Mr. Potter. It’s a simple enough question.”
and I can already feel a headache coming.” Neville tucks one foot underneath himself.
Draco shifts from one foot to the other.
This close, Harry still has a clear view of Draco’s chest. There’s a thin strip of skin that’s lighter than the rest, and it ribbons down from the right side of Draco’s chest to just above his belly button. Harry knew it’d be there, learned its existence from Draco’s drunken tirades months ago, but it’s still the first time he’s seen it, and the boiling guilt mixes with the molten desire in his veins, and Harry suddenly doesn’t know what to do with himself.
Harry tried to count back to the hours he’s been away at the Ministry, and his frown deepened. Seven hours. Draco’s been keeping this to himself for
Harry looks up, careful not to be displaced from the comfortable place he’s managed to secure for himself. In his peripheral vision, he sees Draco offering his glass, but the proffered drink doesn’t do much to interest him. He’s more interested in something closer: Draco’s lips are moist and slightly parted, and much more enticing than a glass of wine—than a glass of anything in Harry’s honest opinion.
There was a slight pause then Draco shrugged. “I saw you shivering last night in that beat-up old jumper. I know that you would’ve just waited for Molly’s gift instead of replacing it yourself,” Draco rolled his eyes, “But Christmas is weeks away, and that office of yours seems like it was built to wage war against warming charms. You would have frozen yourself while going through all that paperwork.”
hours. Harry pushes back the slight sting in his chest on why Draco didn't come to him sooner, maybe send an owl to inform him. He sighs. This was not about him. He knew Draco well enough to know his reasons behind his actions, and knew well enough not to question them on unfounded hunches.
They start a steady rhythm of undulating hips, and Harry’s cock throbs as it rubs against the fabric of his pants and the outline of Draco’s prick.
Pleased, seeing as that’s the closest thing he can get to a compliment for the moment, Harry says nothing and bites back a smile. They lapse into a comfortable silence until Draco deems the moonstone to be enough. He seals the small container and carefully stores it on the bottom shelf. Tomorrow, Draco will bring it to one of the tamer Greenhouses to let it rest under the moonlight, and maybe afterwards, Harry can convince Draco for a quick fly around the grounds.
There’s no rush now while their tongues tangle together, and Harry pulls Draco along as he moves them further into the room. The back of his knees meet the soft, bouncy mattress of Draco’s bed and he sinks down, sitting on the edge, tugging Draco with him. Draco follows, knees firmly planted on either side of Harry’s thighs, until he’s sitting atop Harry, mouth still moving in its languid exploration against his.
“No, but Neville says they’re growing nicely.” Draco’s wand does a little twirl and with a flick of his wrist, another glowing orb sits next to the first one, protecting both ingredients from the outside elements. “From his level of enthusiasm, I gather that they’ll be ready for harvesting for the next moon as expected.”
“Get some rest. I’ll check on you later,” he hears Poppy say, and the implied warning to
The loud
“Remind me to bet after Minerva next time.”
Draco nibbles lightly on the slope of Harry’s neck, and Harry leans against him. “Not here, I don’t.”
“Celestina and the Wicked Sisters.”
, Harry decides, he would very much like a taste.
"You're— I mean it's purr— ah, pretty."
Draco seems to ignore the smug look on Harry’s face as they settle down on the couch, and all time-related concerns and arguments about seating arrangements are forgotten once Neville provides them with much needed refreshments.
“Alright,” Draco snapped.
“They’re not,” Harry says. Now he sounds upset, Draco thinks, but he can’t be arsed to check for sure because he fears that if he opens his eyes right now to the bright lights in his sitting room— why did he even have so many lights open?— his pitiful excuse of a snack may very well make a re-appearance.  And as fond as he thinks Harry is of him, Draco doesn’t think that he’d appreciate sick down his front. “You’re burning up.”
Because now, now Draco’s finally back. He’s here and Harry’s covered in his scent and the air is filled with Draco’s magic—warm and safe and friendly— and yes,
And he wanted to fix it, of course he did. The only problem was that Harry was just as lost as Draco. He didn’t know what to say to close this sudden gap between them. So he didn’t say anything at all. Instead, he reached out and held Draco’s hand, clutching it like it was a lifeline. And when Draco squeezed back, Harry breathed out. It wasn’t much, but it was enough.
And in a sudden flash of comprehension, Harry understood. Yes, Draco had him and let Harry take care of him. But that wasn’t what he was trying to get across.
That sort of control, Harry thinks, would be a wonderful thing to wreck.
“Yes?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
They stare at each other, calmer now, even if the light, easy feeling of amusement is laced with a heavy, lingering understanding of wanting something
Their tongues roll together in a leisurely tangle of
“I think I want that, too.”
Harry’s body is burning, and the room is filled with his loud, ragged breaths, punctuated by the obscene sound of the wet slide of flesh on flesh. He thrusts into his hand, building a steady rhythm as the heat in his groin builds into licking tendrils of flame that makes the tip of his cock bead precum.
There are reasons for all of this—for the fancy mortar and pestle and the sapphires and the silver and the
Apollo scrambles to his feet, making one triangular ear flop—half-bent at a familiar, odd angle— at the vigorous movement.
The sky is clear, and the moonlight streaming through the glass walls is only made more ethereal by the sparks of color that are dancing out from the tip of Draco’s wand. Despite the hour, Greenhouse two is teeming with life—the more curious plants are decidedly awake and paying attention. At least, Harry thinks they are by the way that some of their appendages are waving and rolling around their pots and places in the soil. There’s a particularly daring flitterbloom just a few feet from Harry that has one of its long tentacles trying to invade its neighbor’s pot.
Draco’s scowl is rendered ineffective. There are pink, wide rims around both his eyes, and some of  the shorter strands of his hair are standing up from being clipped too long under the warm temperature of his work circle. He looks ridiculous, and by the way Harry’s heart starts to beat, he knows he’s doomed.
He untangles his limbs, stands up on surprisingly steady legs and, body still wrapped around the comforting smell of the blanket, ventures into the kitchen.
Poseidon wiggles back into his castle.
Harry’s eyes wander from the dishes that are piled by the sink— they’re clean now, and dry, and are apparently having a disagreement as to their places in the rack— to the small trash bags by the corner and he refrains from visibly flinching. He doesn’t recall the kitchen being so untidy a few days ago, and sure Harry hasn’t been cleaning after himself as frequently as he should have been but…
“You’re stubbornness must be wearing me down.”
“Your face is clean.”

as he’s going to get out of their snake, who’s busy exploring her new home.
“—only a matter of time before I can get it properly housetrained—”
“You’d be better off up there but I thought it best not to move you just yet.”
It’s enough, though. Draco’s face clears, and Harry’s amused to see the way it lights up. “Oh!” Of course, when Draco casts a
Harry masks a snicker into a cough, closes the distance between them, reaches out and wraps his arms around Draco’s waist, enjoys the warm flutter in his stomach when Draco relaxes against his chest after a mere moment’s hesitation.
“Draco?”
Draco snorts. “Well, that’s terribly charming. Must you always have such a way with words?”
Harry kisses Draco. Each kiss is a breath of air, each kiss is a pull to the surface, each kiss is leading them to shore, away from the tug of the dark waters they chose to hide in.
It’s a hard job removing Draco’s trousers and pants, especially when Harry’s fingers are shaking from the way the tip of Draco’s tongue is flicking repeatedly over a nipple, teeth gently grazing, mirroring the way his thumb flicks on Harry’s leaking head. By the time he manages to get Draco’s trousers unbuttoned and unzipped, Harry’s a writhing mess underneath him. Harry’s other nipple is subjected to the same ministrations, and it’s a wonder how Harry’s
Draco blinks, surprised. “You know how to cook.”
Arms wrap around his waist, and Harry pulls Draco flush against his back, snuggling into the welcome embrace. They stay curled against each other for Merlin knows how long, neither one willing to move. Harry’s not complaining—he’s quite comfortable like this.
He feels Draco lean against him, and he lets go of Draco's hand only to wrap his arms around Draco’s waist. “When will it get better?” Draco asked, his voice rough and slightly cracking.
Draco’s home. They’re both home. And the hot chocolate is just a bonus.
The snake sways her head side to side, quite eager at the prospect of a biting match. She slides down from Harry’s lap to a spot on the floor, eyeing the scene with something close to fascination. Harry would hate to disappoint her.
“Back to normal,” Draco mutters.
“Just now?”
“—is also
Harry pinches him.
“I actually gave him two days. He did pretty well, considering,” Draco quips.
“I’m revisiting that particular decision,” says Draco matter-of-factly. He takes off his cloak and sends it flying to a far corner of the room. The dark pink shirt reminds Harry of how Draco’s skin looked in the Greenhouse, and his trousers move like a second skin as Draco strides across the room and spells the flame inside the light orb. “If I’m just going to get dirty again, getting cleaned up now would be counterproductive, don’t you agree?”
“Well
able to get all of Draco’s clothes off him when he’s slowly being driven mad.
“Soup,” Harry answers simply. He places the bowl down before he helps Draco sit up against the pillows.
Slowly, in precise, measured movements, Draco rinses the plate in his hand and sends it flying off to the stack. He then Summons Harry’s plate and utensils as well, repeats the motions, and Harry waits in a comfortable silence only broken by the

“Can I—?” Draco’s voice sounds low and strained, and Harry reaches out. The tips of his fingers skate over Draco’s cheek, and every nerve-ending in his body ignites when Draco slides his hand over Harry’s and presses a chaste kiss on the center of his palm.
“Probably,” Draco answers in the same quiet tone.
“I said, the food smells good,” Harry answers as he gives their temperamental cat one last scratch and gets to his feet before Artemis decides to plop on his lap and demand more. She rights herself and brushes against his leg before sauntering off ahead of him.
“Yes.  Draco, look, can we—”
“You just want me naked.”

“Someone might see.”
“I think it’s about time we get you to bed,” is all that Draco says when he finally does speak up, and the quiet tone he uses does not help Harry work out where they stand in the slightest.
and Harry loses himself in the way Draco’s fingers pull and squeeze and tug. Draco starts to rock against him, and Harry feels a warm patch of wetness that’s dribbling on his hip. Harry belatedly realizes he hasn’t got a good look at Draco’s cock yet, and Christ does he want to—he wants to look and stare and imprint Draco’s body in his mind—but the desire to touch and be touched is overpowering now, and Harry knows he has time to get to know Draco’s body later.
“Have you seen the state it’s in? It would be a more acceptable lump of cheese than it would be as a sweater.”
“I mean, if you wanted me to stay so badly all you had to do was ask.”
Eyes speculative, Harry shakes his head slowly. “No, but some coffee would be nice.”
“Remember last time, Harry—”
“See?” Draco exclaims with a proud grin on his face that makes Harry feel warm all over. “Now will you let go of me, or did you plan on spending the night in the kitchen?”
“It doesn’t,” Harry answered, a sad smile on his lips, “It doesn’t get better.”
Draco sits him down gingerly atop the hospital bed, and the both of them let out a relieved breath. Harry feels parts embarrassed and parts guilty about the fact that Draco had to half-drag, half-carry him to the Hospital Wing— he wasn’t exactly feather-light, despite being on the lean, almost thin side— but he thinks about the disappointment shooting through his veins about how he has to stay on the bed, without Draco’s warm, steady arm around him, now that they were here, and the guilt almost overwhelms whatever embarrassment Harry thinks he should be feeling right about now.
Harry has a lot of things he’d like to say to that. But he’s not here to start another hour-long debate with his colleague and as much as he enjoys their banter and the way Draco throws him amused little looks when he knows that Harry’s going to give in, they
Draco quirks an eyebrow. “I’m very tempted to ask how you know that, but I think I’d rather not.”
When Draco’s hand finally wraps firmly around Harry, he groans in relief at the feeling of warm flesh against his own. His grip is sure and steady, and calloused fingers move and stroke with a certainty that Harry’s always been entranced with. He thumbs at Harry’s slit, just like Harry’s always imagined him doing. The digit swirls and presses lightly and swirls over the head again, keeps repeating the motion, sending sparks of electric heat to Harry’s groin, spreading beads of pearly fluid as Harry’s cock leaks with pre-cum.
, and Harry turns just in time to see Apollo racing out of the kitchen.
Harry tries not to roll his eyes and quip some remark about Draco’s ability of stating the obvious and unnecessary.
Draco’s crushing some more moonstone and there’s a sheen of sweat that’s starting to collect on his forearms. It makes the flower tattoo seem real and dewy from the perspiration, and Harry’s captivated. It’s been almost a year since they’ve become friendly, yet he still feels pleased about being one of the few who are privy to Draco’s exposed forearms. He’s also certain his mental faculties decide to take leave whenever he gets to see them. The first few times he saw Draco’s mark-laden arm uncovered, it had been difficult not to stare. A tightness in his throat had settled and became difficult to dislodge. But as he spent more time with Draco, Harry slowly realized that he had shifted from trying not to stare at Draco’s mark, to trying not to stare at the intricate curl and weave of flowers softening the skull and snake, to trying not to stare at Draco’s forearms full stop. By the time Harry realized that keeping his eyes from drifting to Draco’s bare forearms was a lost cause, the tightness in his throat had crept lower and lower, instead becoming a near-constant heat in the pit of his stomach and a discomfort in his groin.
“If you want me to.”
Harry grimaces. Looking up from his unappetizing lunch, he throws a scowl Lavender’s way when she plops next to him. Harry has to stop himself from pulling the seat away. It’s Draco’s seat. He stabs a potato with more force than necessary.
Harry bends his knee, then his ankle, and when he’s certain nothing’s broken or dislocated, he lets Draco’s stern voice lead him into their kitchen. “Oh for—
Harry licks his lips, and they tingle in anticipation as Draco’s eyes slide toward it. “What do you suggest, then?”
Harry rubs at the spot he just pinched, and Draco lets himself be soothed despite grumbling under his breath.
Draco squeezes his hand. “I’m here now.”
“What should we name her, then?”
Harry glances swiftly at their almost-pet snake, and shrugs. “We were wondering about names, that’s all.”
There’s a snarl of frustration above him and a growled
had sounded in his head, bouncing along the lines of his skull amplifying the headache that had grown so bad his eyes had started to sting and he’d thought he might just sick up.
“I was not, in any way,
“It was just on your hair.”
And then all of a sudden— as if Harry’s wordless cries had somehow reached out and snatched him from whatever corner of the world he’s been lurking in— Draco’s there, wrapping Harry in his favorite blanket and gently coaxing him back with his citrus scent and warm, sure hands, and touches of comfort and understanding and home. Draco helps Harry close up the old wounds that have re-opened in his mind until they’re nothing but scars again. And when Harry’s breathing finally matches his own, Harry allows Draco to hold him just a bit closer until Harry’s fingers are warm and his heartbeat is steady and slow.
“I. Am. Not. Sick.”
“No?” Harry plucks a bit of soil and Draco cringes. “I could Summon you a mirror.”
, and he doesn’t think he will be any time soon. Not with this Draco-
“I…” Harry’s hands are trembling, his body is warming up like a gush of fiendfyre has just set it alight. He really hopes he doesn’t set anything on fire. The back of his neck tingles. Sure, steady fingers thread against his. A warm forehead against his.
Harry peered inside and ignored the sudden lump in his throat. Draco’s back was to him, facing the large portrait that now hung beside Lucius Malfoy’s, but even from this distance Harry could see the tight lines on his shoulders, the too stiff upright posture.
Draco looks down, amused for the most part. “You haven’t worn me out
But Harry's dislike for Potions... well. If death hasn't managed to change that, then Harry thinks it's a lost cause.

, and he manages to throw his arms out and not break his nose, but his knee certainly does not appreciate the impact on the wooden floor.
This morning, Harry had dragged himself out of bed like he has been doing for the past few days. He’d trudged through the steadily growing pile of clothes on their bedroom floor and through the unpaired shoes littered across the living room to make his way into the kitchen to maybe put the kettle on before he’d chug down a pain potion for his throbbing head. But the kettle had been in the sink— as it had been sitting there for days— along with a stack of dishes and teacups and cutlery, and Harry had taken one look at the godawful pile and a resounding
“Sod off.”
Harry slips from his stool and walks over to Draco’s patch of warm circle. Careful not to touch anything else, Harry reaches out and squeezes Draco’s shoulder to catch his attention. “Draco.”
Draco, on the other hand, the tit, doesn’t even look remotely concerned. Not even when Neville blatantly stares at the angry-looking lovebites on his neck.
Harry folds his arms. “Please. I know what you’re trying to do, Draco.”
“It’s a perfectly good name for a dog,” Harry insists.
They surface, no longer drowning. They surface, no longer cloaked in heavy shadows, bathed in warm sunlight.
"No," Harry mutters. He feels the sweat collecting at his nape. "In my defense, it was too hot to concentrate."
“Like you might leap over my table and jump me at any second.”
“You know,” Harry starts, plucking his wand from his holster and pointing it at the sealed, glass container of moon seed. “Sometimes I think you only keep me around for the free labor.” Carefully, the container flies out of Draco’s Moon Kit and is gently placed on its designated spot beside the pot of powdered moonstone. Tomorrow morning, when Neville does his rounds between his greenhouses, he’ll cover the containers and shade them from the sun’s rays. By nightfall, they’ll have matured quite nicely and Draco and Harry will venture back into Greenhouse Two to collect them.
Draco shrugs, takes a sip of his tea, and looks at Harry with kind eyes that melt whatever icy feeling is left in his chest. “Nothing a bit of magic can’t tidy up.”
“Later. I might even let you do the honors.”
Harry does not even remember why he accepted Minerva’s invitation to come back to Hogwarts earlier than planned, if not only to get a head start on lesson plans and to gather his wits about him in preparation for the coming term.
Harry nods. “Should I even ask?”
“Still not doing it on purpose, Potter?”
Harry draws a shaky breath. “Yeah.”
A steady heartbeat underneath trembling fingers.
Harry doesn’t know many snakes who can sound as exasperated as the one currently sliding from his shoulder to his lap.
“No. I thought we’d gone over this? No touching without the proper equipment.”
“I... apologize,” Draco’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts, “That was quite insensitive of me.”
And with one look at that intense expression on his face, Harry knows that Draco is remembering that same night, three years ago.
“So nothing.” Lavender shrugs. “It’s only Harry who’s making a big deal out of it.”
“Oh,” Harry feels the heat rush to his cheeks as he quickly disentangles his re-transfigured leg from Draco’s. He didn’t even feel Poppy transfiguring one leg back to normal, “Sorry, I didn’t— I wasn’t—”
Harry tries not to sound too indignant. “I’m not doing it on purpose, you git.”
The striped red-white-yellow scales are still somewhat cold despite having been wrapped around Draco’s frame, but Harry doesn’t mind much. At least, the cool scales are the
much, yet.”
When that’s done, he lets himself stare a bit and tries not to grin at  the oddly charming sight of Draco Malfoy in bright-turquoise-framed plastic goggles and neon-green latex gloves. The front portion of his hair is clipped back, but there are still a few short strands that have managed to slip out and Harry’s hands are itching to reach out and clip them back in place.
Harry huffs. “You need to eat. And then I’ll get you some Pepper-up and a change of clothes. You’ll soak through those at this rate.”
“Did Master Draco happen to mention where he was going?”
“I’m good with my hands, yes,” Harry quips, amusement covering his concern just for a second.
Well. He imagines it a bit

Harry catches the way Draco cringes when Lavender pops a piece of chocolate in her mouth right after she takes a swig of her Firewhisky.
scars and into clear, grey eyes instead. “Don’t,” is all that Draco says before he’s kissing Harry again. Slow and sensual, licking into every crevice of Harry’s mouth, making him light-headed and dizzy and feeling like he may just spontaneously combust.
Harry merely quips an eyebrow and shoves another spoonful of tasty soup in his mouth.
Finally done with the washing, Draco turns off the spigot, twists his head to level a look at him, suspicious and wary, and Harry schools his expression into the one Draco’s called his Healer-face. “Now I’m really curious about the conversation you just had with her.”
with his wrist and fingers again. “—
Draco sends him a look that’s only further softened by the tentative brush of pale fingers against his. Harry’s shoulders sag and his leg settles.
He especially likes it when it’s Draco who’s doing the brewing. Not that he’s watched anyone else brew potions recently it’s just—there’s something about the steady way Draco handles the ingredients, the fluid motion of his wrist when he stirs, the intense look on his face, his lips pursed and his brow furrowed, as he dices with impressive precision, the elegant twist of fingers when he brings in some vapors for a whiff…
Harry pinches him again. This time, Draco jumps and proceeds to slap at Harry’s hand. “That is going to bruise, you heathen. Let go of me.” Harry tightens his arms around Draco and refuses to budge.
Harry is not, in any way, remorseful. “Well, someone needs to make up their damned mind.” With his fingers firmly clenched on Draco’s hair, he clashes their mouths together in a whirl of tongue and teeth.
“How bad was it?” he hears himself ask as he absentmindedly traces a swirl over his left arm.
Harry knows what Draco’s seeing and his heart thunders inside his chest. For a moment he has this ridiculous urge to cover himself, uncertain of how the scars on his body will be received. His fingers clench on Draco’s covers.
The food items, he could handle. The cutlery and pots and pans and kitchenware, he could let slide (who was he to argue when it benefited him and his curious attachment to the kitchen). The furniture and drapes and little trinkets around the house... he closed his eyes and tutted and staggered and grudgingly accepted. But the shoes and the coats and the scarves and the clothes,
“I don’t know.” Harry pulls on his hair, mildly ticked off. “It was Lavender’s idea; ask her.”
“That’s not what we agreed on,” your tone changes, and he notices. He always does. And as always, he stays rooted on the spot. Behind you. Against you. Around you. Stubborn arse. “Your children—”
“It’s not as bad as it looks, Draco,” Harry sighs.
When Draco finally releases him, Harry is breathless and boneless and brilliantly blissed out.
There’s no gentle caress of mouths or skin as Draco moves on top of him. Draco’s mouth is a roaring fire against his and his hands are precise and sharp as they ruck Harry’s shirt up. The nails of his thumbs drag against Harry’s heated skin, and Harry shudders almost violently. Draco breaks away from the kiss, panting, just to divest Harry of his shirt, and Harry’s glasses are knocked off as his shirt goes sailing off the bed. Strands of blond hair frame Draco’s face as he looks down, and there’s a fierce look on his face as he takes in Harry’s bare chest.
“Have you checked on the Aconite?” Harry asks as he heaves himself off the ground.
Harry blinks. Draco’s so close, Harry can count each eyelash, can see how the grey in his eyes are mixed with specks of blue. Harry has to remind himself how to speak. “For now, I suppose.”
The truth of the matter is, Draco can pretty much accomplish everything they do on Moon Night by himself. But Harry likes to think that, like him, Draco appreciates the company.
“I think Helios has an oral fixation problem.”
one thing that aggravates his loss of control.
Long, deep breaths guiding short, terrified gasps.
“Moonstone first. Then the roots,” Draco continues.
“No, you’re not,” Harry argues. Draco feels his hand on his shoulder, trying to push him back down on the soft, plump couch. “Lie down.”
Draco touches him like Harry’s worthy of this tenderness, cups his face and kisses him like he’s hung the stars and the moon, kisses Harry like nothing else matters.
Their erections rub as their bodies are pulled flush together. Draco’s body jerks and his low groan sends ripples of want crashing over Harry.
Half-heartedly, he scoops some potatoes into his plate and munches on pensively. It’s not quiet in the Great Hall—there’s the low rumbling of students’ voices and the quiet tones of his colleagues indulging in castle gossip—but he’s gotten so used to having Draco babbling some nonsense commentary beside him about one thing or other that lunch feels gloomy and distasteful without it.
The flitterbloom that Harry saw earlier is now engaged in one of the oddest wrestling matches he’s ever witnessed, and Harry knows it’s coming before it happens.
“I didn’t notice.”
“But—” Harry draws back, but Draco keeps his mouth firmly attached to Harry’s skin as it burns a path down his jaw, his neck, tongue dipping into his collarbone. “—we should talk—”
For all the flurry of life inside it a while ago, the Greenhouse is oddly still now. It’s waiting, holding its breath, Harry thinks. Like him.
Draco eases back into the cushion. “Easy for you to say when it’s your pissed arse I’ll be dragging back to your quarters and not the other way around.”
“This is entirely unfair.”
that sounds incredibly put out, and chaos ensues as Apollo barrels inside the kitchen, chasing Artemis who has his squeaky toy captive in her mouth.
. It’s a compelling sight, and Harry thinks it’s not really his fault if he forgets himself and is tempted to touch it. Again.
It's cold.
Draco smiles softly before his mouth resumes its languid sweep down Harry’s body, and he presses his hard cock against Harry’s hand. “Don’t you have some work to do?”
Harry could have accepted the invitation from Minerva, and Draco, instead of accepting his own invitation and coming back to Hogwarts two days after Harry arrived, should have just stayed at home with his son and stretched out the remainder of their time together before the term starts.
“This still doesn’t mean that I’m sick.”
Artemis
People.
“Normal people do not attempt to transfigure themselves into part-squid, part-scarhead.”
Harry’s breath hitches as he flicks his wrist, sweeps over the sensitive glans, and his legs quiver as he tries to chase his release. He squirms against the covers, mouth open as uninhibited sounds of pleasure spill from parted lips.
“You thought it was funny!” Harry argues.
“Don’t.”
It’s maddening, Harry thinks, the sheer amount of control that Draco has even when he’s not brewing anything.
"No. I'm still amazed at how badly you botched up our last potion. I'm not risking another one."
He imagines Draco’s bright grey eyes on him, watching him like he does when he explores Draco’s workroom, following his every movement, and Harry thinks that whatever spare blood is left in his body rushes to his aching cock. He sees Draco’s piercing eyes behind his closed lids, focused solely on him as Harry pleasures himself, sees Draco crawl over Harry’s supine form that’s already covered in a thin sheen of sweat. Mind-Draco is all sharp angles and measured movements, and he knocks Harry’s hand away, replaces it with his own, insistent in taking Harry apart by his own hand.
Draco snorts inelegantly, disbelieving, but the sound still tugs at the corners of Harry’s mouth. Draco’s silent as he looks at the snake that’s still regarding them with an intrigued tilt of his white-yellow head.
of glass and metal. He can almost hear Draco’s mind whirring, a complete disconnect on the calm and fluid motions of his hands, but Harry knows he’s thinking a mile a minute—feels it in the way Draco’s heart is hammering against Harry’s palm when he slides his hand further under Draco’s shirt.
It’s been a long day of swishing and flicking and running about the lemon-scented halls of St. Mungo’s, and Harry has barely kept afloat with the sheer volume and quality of patients under his department. Sometimes, on the bad days when he’s yelled at or covered with questionable bodily fluids or failed to see a patient through, he has difficulty remembering why he keeps at it. But, sometimes, like today, when the little girl he just discharged ran up to him before leaving, healthy and beaming and glowing with life, and gave him a tight hug and a warm thank you, pushed a drawing of the two of them into his twelve-hour-shift-shaky hands, it’s not that hard to remember the
Harry blinks at him, reigning down his panic, suddenly wondering if Draco is using
“Okay?”

sounds from somewhere in the corner.
spoil him too much?” Harry counters, trapping Draco’s foot between his own. “Who was it who bought him that squeaky toy the other day? Remind me again how much it cost?”
“Fuck, come here.” Harry pulls Draco into a searing kiss. Draco sucks on his bottom lip as his hand slowly goes down Harry’s cock, pulling the foreskin back, knuckles tickling the coarse hair at the base of his prick. Draco tugs and brings his hand down again in the same, unhurried motion. Harry feels like he’s melting. He shoves his hands underneath Draco’s shirt, bare, hot skin grounding him. He slides his mouth over the salty-skin of his jaw. “Why aren’t you naked yet?”
not the one who named our dog Apollo.”
Harry growls. “Fuck— Just—” He pushes Draco off just enough to get a better handle on his shirt and yanks at the fabric. The dark pink shirt slides off Draco’s shoulders and with a bit of tugging, Harry finally manages to remove it completely and fling it over the side of the bed. Harry thinks he may have popped off some buttons in the process of tearing the thing open, but, really, Harry doesn’t care. Not when he finally has Draco shirtless.
“Should I be worried?” Harry lifts a brow at the little brown-white-red pup. “What did he bring this time?”
“I did,” Draco nods. And just like that, the morose mood snaps back in place.
“Why are your hands freezing?” Draco mutters, flinching away from said fingers.
on him.
They haven’t had a Seekers’ game in ages, but Harry can also do with a bit of leisurely flying. The skies have been clear for the past few nights, and if the weather holds, it would provide magnificent flying conditions.
“I’m not a patient because I’m not sick.”
, and it only takes a few more strokes and Harry’s teeth nibbling on a spot on Draco’s shoulder before Draco stiffens against him and shudders with relief.
Harry’s magic mysteriously goes back to normal the following morning.
Harry thinks that sultry seductress is quite a hard look to pull off.
“W-wanker.”
“I won’t believe you if you keep doing that.”
“You come here,” Draco mutters, petulant. The dish he’s washing bobs rather ominously despite Draco’s steady hold of his wand.
Draco moans and it sends hot rivulets of desire spiralling down Harry’s stomach and straight to his groin. “Here, let me—” He adjusts his position and takes both of them in hand, and the feeling of warm hand and hot cock moving and rubbing together has Harry making all sorts of sounds he’d probably normally be embarrassed about.
After all, he doesn’t want to ruin the Wolfsbane. And he also doesn’t want to be on the other end of Lavender’s creatively colored nails.
He tried again, “Hello?”
Harry knows that he would have to fight her tooth and nail when she uses that tone with him. So despite not being all that ecstatic about a night in the hospital wing, he gives her a weary nod of resignation.
Lavender leans in front of him and slams a hand beside Neville’s plate. “Two Galleons that Harry caves first.”
The amusement is short-lived, however, and he stops in his tracks at the kitchen doorway. “Draco…” Harry starts, tone disapproving.
” Harry thinks he doesn’t even sound annoyed anymore. He can’t even bring himself to try—not when there’s a soothing hand easing up his thigh and giving it a calming squeeze.
Harry sighed, and then reached up to rub his face. Draco was upset. Again. It hasn’t slipped his notice that these episodes were becoming alarmingly common. He says something. Draco says something. One or both of them snaps. And it was disheartening that this was happening so near the holidays.
of his worries.
“Moon Night. Yes.” Draco’s face is luminescent. The glowing orb casts a purplish tint to his jaw and his cheeks, and Harry thinks it makes Draco look funny. Harry is also finding it very difficult to look away.
“It’s been known to happen once in a while, but more curious things have happened, I’m sure.”
him. It always works, Harry’s loathe to admit, but that doesn’t mean he’s just going to let it happen without one hell of a fight. It’s just the principle of the thing.
Harry thinks.
Long elegant fingers are worming their way into Harry’s pants, tickling as it dances with the coarse hair trailing lower and lower and stops short before it reaches where Harry desperately wants to be touched. They tease along the base of Harry’s cock, and Harry groans, trying to shift into the touch that’s skittering away.
Draco frowns into his cup. “I shouldn’t have agreed to a trip that long. Next time I’ll—“
Harry wonders, wickedly amused, without taking his eyes off his very cross partner.
“Let’s make the cleaning up worth it, shall we?”
Draco turned and gave him a quick kiss— a simple brush of the lips, sighing as he went. “Yes, you do.”
If he’s being honest, Harry’s in a ridiculously good mood that doesn’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon, regardless of any other bets he and his impulse control might be involved in.
Harry thinks he looks just as, if not more, wrecked. At least, he feels like he is. Broken apart by the thoroughness of Draco’s mouth and hands and fingers.
It doesn’t come.
“Well,” Draco replies, “given the circumstances, I wasn’t entirely certain.”
“Hey!”
“You can be a lazy sod tomorrow morning. Shush.”
“I should probably— erm. Cleaning charm.”
“Salazar, look at you,” Draco breathes.
There’s a spark of blue and pink and a flash of purple, and Harry’s eyes are easily drawn in with the way Draco’s wand is weaving pretty colors around the mustard pot. Draco’s silent for a long moment. “I thought you weren’t going to come.”
“You have a NEWT in Charms, too. Yet I didn’t see you putting it into use on that busty brunette you were eyeing two weeks ago when we went to… what’s-it-called.”
“It’s too soon.”
Harry thinks as Draco orders him to send the required mortar and pestle his way.
Harry turns his head, their lips brush,
Harry peels off his robe and throws it carelessly over the couch—it’s already messy, anyway, and he’ll clean up later, he swears. There are more urgent matters to attend to, if Draco’s cooking, singing self is any indication, and most of the time it is. He’s almost at the hallway when heavy thuds race toward him, and Harry grins, bracing himself for impact.
“Well?” Harry urges. “Have you thought of one?”
There’s a bark and a clatter, and a blur of a pup slides across the floor, stopping just a few inches from Harry’s shoes, all four of his little legs spread out as he blinks wide, excited eyes at his other owner.
Poppy narrows her eyes at him, as if she can see through the lie that has just slipped through Harry’s mouth.
Draco’s not looking at him, though, even as he helps Harry to his feet and steadies him. Harry’s stomach sinks. He’s going to be sick and he’s sure the nausea has nothing to do with the amount of alcohol he’s ingested and more to do with the certain knowledge that he’s bollocksed it all up.
“Palatable,” Harry tries the word on for size, delighted at the way it rolls off his tongue. But then Harry realizes that Draco sounds like a snob and he’s just gone and copied him, so he scoffs. He places his glass on the low table and sits back, the sudden movement making him feel incredibly light-headed. The couch feels unsteady, but he’s fairly sure he’s just tipsy, a couple of glasses short of being fully pissed. Draco’s shoulder is there to steady him though, and he allows himself to lean against it for a moment.
Ambitions.
“I don’t see what’s funny, Harry.”
Harry answers.
“You have things growing out of your head that are worse than your hair, which is quite a remarkable feat even for you,” he says, in an afterthought, “And your legs are useless, slimy, lumps of jelly.”
Seeming to be finally content with the amount of circles he’s done, Apollo barks happily, and with one last bump at Harry’s feet, speeds off to the kitchen.
Draco frowns. Shakes his head.
yes— I need you closer. I want to
“Lights, please,” Draco requests.
does.
limbs,” he says with a roll of his eyes.
“Oh,” Draco sounds and looks surprised to see Harry there. Funny, because if anyone here is supposed to be surprised, Harry reckons it should probably be him.  “Hello.”
“That’s cashmere, in a shade of green that’s particularly difficult to find,” the amused and partially exasperated voice said, and the sound of it made Harry’s aggravation melt just a little, “And you are defiling it with your clutching. Give it here.”
“Freeing another house elf,” Harry snorts, and Draco swears he can feel Harry's exasperated glare all the way over here. “What do you think? I doubt you’d eaten yet and you need to drink medicine.”
“Always running about. Honestly.”
He slots himself behind you and nuzzles— the coarse hair of his beard leaving a trail of goose-flesh as you’re reminded of the reddened-skin it’s imparted elsewhere on your body. “You need to shave.”
Draco’s leg brushes against Harry’s, and Harry suddenly finds that his is frozen in place.
Harry decides right there, as Draco’s arm winds around his waist in a firmer grip, that he has horrible colleagues and even more horrible friends, and that they are all going to hell.
Draco’s eyes are burning as they flick back up to Harry’s face. He doesn’t know what expression is on his face at that moment, but Draco’s gaze softens and Harry releases the breath he doesn’t even know he’s holding. More silky strands fall over Draco’s shoulder as he dips his head and starts pressing open-mouthed kisses over Harry’s chest. His collarbones. The ridges of his ribs. The planes of his stomach. The dark trail of hair disappearing into his pants. The straining outline of his cock against his jeans.
He didn’t even have to ask. Harry knew what he meant. “I won’t.”
“It’s the treats or my cuffs,” Harry chuckles, “Or my trousers.”
Harry rests his chin on Draco’s shoulder. “There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t miss Sirius. Or Remus, or Fred, or Tonks... I’ve just learned to live with it. That doesn’t mean that I’ve forgotten— not that I’d ever want to. But I know they’d hate it if I just let it eat me up. That’s not what they would’ve wanted.”
“I know,” Harry whispered back, in a no nonsense tone, before planting a kiss to Draco's shoulder.
“What?” Draco murmurs against his kiss-swollen mouth.
There are two mugs on the counter top, sitting away from the self-cleaning dishes, and Draco sends both flying smoothly to the table. Harry peers inside the one that’s settled in front of him, makes a pleased noise at the discovery, and proceeds to take an experimental sip. The hot chocolate warms him from his stomach to each fiber of his strained muscles, and Harry feels himself start to relax. He hasn’t even realized just how tense he’s been the past few days.
He’s achy and tired and famished, and he doesn’t have the energy to be on the other side of the debate that comes along with his favourite Draco-dish.
“I’ve went ahead and got a head start at the gifts, if that’s alright with you,” Draco said, motioning to the row of bags that Harry had indeed seen.
Draco makes an annoyed-sounding noise, which Harry promptly answers with a light kiss on his cheek. The skin is warm against Harry’s lips, and Harry absolutely loves the way he can see the red flush blossom from Draco’s cheeks to his ears, down his neck…
They still have to deposit the crushed moonstone in the Greenhouses tonight, but Harry is growing disheartened as the day trudges on. He wonders whether he’d actually managed to ruin his friendship with Draco after all. Last night though…
Harry eyes the brightly-coloured reptile—she looks quite content just draped around him like this, and he knows how this snake captured Draco’s attention, of course he does. It’s like Poseidon and Apollo and Artemis all over again. Still, he wonders just how many more animals Draco will be bringing home and just when Harry will be able to finally put his foot down.
There is one common factor in all the occurrences of wonky magic that has happened to him over the past few days, and he thinks that Poppy’s question at this point is merely a formality. She has pieced it together as well, maybe even sooner than Harry has. Still, Harry does not care to admit to the assumption in her eyes when the common factor is sitting beside him, leg wrapped up in his jelly thi— er, tentacle.
“It’s snowing,” Harry murmured. He looked to the gray sky. It looked like the beginning of a storm.
Harry pushed down the bout of unease in his stomach. He knew what Tippy meant. Draco rarely shuts up, more so on a bad day. That he was reduced to this... Only once has he been faced with a brooding Draco, and it did not bode well for him. The house elf left him in front of a large wooden door, bowing slightly as she left him with a worried, almost frantic look in her eyes as she disapparated with a quiet
Nonetheless, he tried to stifle the gnawing worry and panic that was brewing in the back of his mind. He called out, tentatively, “I’m home!”
“I want to see all of you.”
potion. Draco managed to successfully drill that in Harry’s mind in a way that Snape or Slughorn had not, but Harry just can’t bring himself to remember those reasons right now.
accompanied by such a knowing look that almost made Harry squirm like a guilty little school boy.
And Harry couldn’t be happier.
And when Harry's eyes flickered open, he saw that the earlier distress had gone. Draco was looking at him-- a smile on his lips, all warm gray eyes filled with that something that he could never name but made his stomach leap and gave his chest pleasant bouts of warmth-- and he knew.
Harry has the intense urge to shut him up again with something other than his mouth. His cock twitches against Draco’s lithe fingers. He thinks he should feel ridiculous, spread wantonly underneath Draco while he’s fully clothed. His cock’s jutting up, hard and red and begging to be touched properly. Yet, he’s never felt so desired as he watches Draco’s eyes burn, focused on the way Harry’s cock slides between the circle of his fingers as he pulls back the heated foreskin. Harry shoves his hips up to get his point across.
A cold finger traces the inside of his palm.
“Later. Maybe,” Draco stretches beside him, “This will do for now.”
Harry’s thick bed curtains muffle the growing whispers beyond it, but there’s no darkness to hide them now. There’s no ocean of moonlight to drown in. There’s only the brightness of grey eyes lit by streams of sunlight, threatening to be dimmed by uncertainty and questions as Draco looks at Harry. Waiting. Harry thinks, hoping.
“Merlin, I hope not. I’m only just imagining my fifth-years getting into
“I messaged you,” Draco points out, “Doesn’t count.”
“Harry!” Draco rubs at the spot, glaring at Harry through the corner of his eyes, but makes no move to step away from the circle of Harry’s arms.
Draco nudges him with his leg. “
Harry’s coiled tight from months of watching and wanting and this is not going to take long at all.
Or maybe it was all Draco’s fault in the first place.
Harry stiffens. His leg starts to bounce almost rhythmically. “Mornings are always better when you’re here.”
“No.” Harry peers inside his own glass, considering. “It doesn’t taste that bad.” Although, he supposes he understands its lack of appeal to Draco’s refined taste. “Do you want some?”
Just like how he’s feeling now.
“You should have told me that you weren’t feeling well when you texted,” even as he’s chiding Draco, Harry’s voice is soft and soothing, like the way his thumb smooths away the furrow on Draco’s forehead.
“You like my beard.”
“But—” Draco continues, none the wiser of the turmoil that’s warring in Harry’s stomach, “—I should probably train you out of touching things that should not be touched. Maybe with a bit of work we might make a proper lab rat out of you yet.”
Harry hums, gaze drawn to the flicker of movement that made itself known to the corner of his vision.
“Like what?”
Mind-Draco teases him with strokes of fingers underneath the glans, alternates quick tugs with slow, downward strokes.
He’s so close, and he knows once he allows himself to tip over there’s most certainly no going back for him.
Draco lets out a long breath.
They’re quiet for a few minutes as Harry scoops more soup and feeds Draco, and Draco lets him. There are worse ways to spend his Friday evening, he supposes. Staying at home and letting Harry Potter feed him home-made soup seems as good as any.
He should have seen it coming, Harry thinks, as he blinks a little less dazedly than a few minutes ago and tries to go over just exactly what’s happened here. He’s sat on the floor, leaning against the couch. There’s a warm blanket bundled around him— its well-loved edges are worn and the faded colors of the swirly patterns scattered all over the center only furthers the evidence of its age. It has a nice, crisp, citrus-y smell that gently coaxes Harry’s consciousness into being and does wonders in subduing the icy chill that has been running through his now exhausted body.
But at the same time, Harry doesn’t want them to know— how he has Draco’s body so deeply imprinted to his memory that Harry’s hands can see, and his mouth can feel, and his eyes can whisper, and even when all his senses become overloaded with Draco, confused and lost they are not. Even blind in the night, deaf in the forced hush of secrecy, incoherent with desire, Harry knows how to make his lover fall apart.
that Harry swore he could—
“Oh, leave him be,” Harry says, in a fond tone. “At least he’s not running into things or knocking them over anymore.”
He sucks on Draco’s bottom lip, earning himself a whimper, and Harry continues ravaging Draco’s mouth with his own. Their tongues roll together and it’s a battle of dominance as they lick into each other’s mouths—hands flying over shoulders and chests and arses, tugging and pulling
Draco’s breath fans over his lips. A warm hand ghosts over his own. Harry's eyes widen and his heart beats wildly against his chest. Harry doesn’t know what’s happening (not really, he thinks he
The fire’s crackling in the hearth, and Neville and Lavender’s discussion has moved from gyrating hips to Neville’s newest favorite pet plant.
He waited, but still only silence greeted him.
Draco raises a pale eyebrow and looks down at something between them. Harry follows his gaze and—
“I feel like I’ve just been robbed.”
Harry grins. “Yet?”
, drawing a low, satisfied groan deep from Draco’s chest. “Oh, fuck me, that feels brilliant.”
atop the calendar and the throbbing in his head had exploded until it had become a ringing in his ears, until it had fallen like a veil and clouded his vision, until it had squeezed the air out of his lungs, until it had siphoned the cold sweat out of his body and made him shudder so violently that Harry had crumpled to the ground in a ball of gasps and tears and heart being ripped out of his chest.
When Neville starts to wheeze, Harry thumps him lightly on his back. “I thought we agreed not to talk about that.”
“What was that?” Draco asks.
He felt like squirming under her studying gaze now, as she sent him that look again. Like she knew something that Harry didn’t.
“Is it?”
“I know,” comes the raspy response against his mouth.
Draco pushes forward. Harry’s eyes close.
“I’ll be in my study, then.”
turning more desperate with each thrust, but they’re no closer to relief than they were minutes ago.
“What’s that?” Draco’s voice sounds from the kitchen. “What did you break this time?”
In the end, all he manages is a small, dismayed sound and despite having just kissed the man, he refuses to look at Draco who is all pointy and motionless beside him.
Their snake repeats, and Harry feels the delight that punctuates the sounds sweeping across her tongue.
"Of course not," Draco agrees, "You sit there
Harry takes a long sip of his hot chocolate, relishing in the way the sweetness coats his mouth.
Artemis follows Apollo’s progress with her intelligent, sea-green eyes, stretches again, then paws at Harry’s leg. She sidles up next to him, rubbing her pristine, white, coat along Harry’s trousers, and nudges his hand, clearly asking for attention.
Draco blinks at him, spoon half-way to his mouth.
That was more than an hour or so ago, Harry thinks. Now, Lavender is currently fiddling with the Wireless and when she reclaims her spot on the rug with a sound of triumph, they find themselves graced with Celestina Warbeck’s low, luscious tones.
“No, I can’t stand the taste.” Draco scrunches his nose. “Wine is much more palatable.”
It works. Wide, curious grey eyes look up at him as Draco holds the pestle up, mid-crush. “What?”
Harry’s always tempted to touch loads of things when he’s in this room—can feel the way his fingers itch and his palms tingle with the desire to reach out and touch and feel.
The sharp scent of spices assaults Harry as he stumbles out of the Floo—strong and earthy, it whirls in the air and surrounds him as he rights himself and waits for his sitting room to stop spinning. His stomach rumbles in anticipation, even as wariness slithers along his skin and burrows into it, bone-deep, while he sniffs at the mouth-watering aroma.
He mumbles gratefully when he feels Draco’s magic wrap around his skin. The gentle cleaning spell sweeps over him and leaves a lingering touch. “So what happened to cleaning up properly?” Harry asks when he finally manages to catch his breath.
“Because I only have one set of these, which are currently in use, and you very well know why we can’t use anything else,” Draco explains, not really cross, as he motions to the mortar and pestle in question.
Harry laughs, and Draco refocuses on him, a bewildered look on his face. “What’s so funny?”
and Harry can do nothing but let it devour him.
The calming scent of citrus taming the trembles of a body— a body so deeply imprinted with years upon years of battle-earned scars— that echo past fears and pain and terrors so devastating that Harry thinks sometimes, sometimes it threatens to consume him.
“I’m not the one who named our cat Artemis.”
The aggrieved flitterbloom, now homeless, wraps its free tentacles around the instigator bloom’s pot and the resulting image makes Harry wonder just what sort of madness Neville has to witness in each of his Greenhouses on a daily basis.
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
He didn’t sick up. No, what happened, he thinks, was much worse.
“Your breath smells of Firewhisky,” Draco observes. “You are clearly inebriated, and I am not going to engage in a potentially important conversation with you while you’re pissed, and nor am I going to engage in anything else.”
and a bark and a
Draco’s lips are red and moist and sinful to look at, and Harry thinks his friends are really underestimating his impulse control because if it were up to him, he’d still be nibbling on that full bottom lip and tearing delightful noises out of Draco’s mouth.
He looked at the other bags, neatly placed in a row beside the fireplace, mind reeling just at the thought of how all the other purchases would be just as, if not more, expensive than the article of clothing he now held.
“Ha, ha,” Harry’s voice sounds from the kitchen, dripping with sarcasm. “You don’t need my help with that.”
He watches Draco’s retreating figure, and even when he’s nothing more than an indistinct shadow, Harry’s lips still burn with the fleeting touch.
“As long as master’s being in the wizard hole, Kreacher thinks,” the house-elf said, bowing deeply again.
Draco lifts a pale eyebrow, mid–donning, and Harry’s only partially distracted by the way his goggles reflect the bright lights. “What?”
Fingers rake through white-blond strands and Harry takes pleasure in the way that Draco’s becoming a blubbering mess against him. His rhythm is getting sloppy, and his thrusts are becoming frantic.
“I wasn’t going to touch it,” Harry repeats, louder so that he might capture Draco’s attention, which has already shifted from Harry’s grabby hands to the moonstone he’s just Levitated onto his shiny scales.
Helios continues her random path across their kitchen floor, occasionally bumping on fixtures, tongue darting out to take in the scents, head swaying this way and that in an almost giddy bend of her head. Harry thinks that that’s as much of a
“Git,” Harry snorts, focusing his attention back to Madame Pomfrey’s fussing about.
. The
“Bad morning,” Draco trails off, finger tracing the rim of his mug without looking away from Harry. He hesitates before trudging on, careful. Always so careful. “Or bad couple of mornings?”
fine.
Harry wets his lips. He sees the way Draco’s eyes catch the movement. Bright grey eyes chase the flick of Harry’s tongue on his lower lip and Harry watches as Draco visibly gulps.
With one last look at Helios, Harry bites none too gently on the slope of Draco’s neck, earning him a surprised yelp and a “What the fuck, Potter?” Draco turns in his arms to bat at Harry’s shaking shoulders, a colourful array of curses piling one after the other on his mouth, and Harry kisses him.
Then Draco turned around, and seemed to curl up on himself, shocking Harry into remembering the vulnerable sixteen-year-old trying to hide his tears in the girl’s bathroom.
He took a deep breath and unfolded the parchment, steadying himself for impending heartbreak. What Harry saw knocked the breath out of him, but for a much different reason than that of his expectations. He stared at the elegant cursive, unable to stomach the letters they formed. Two words— the parchment held only two words but they were enough to tip his world upside down.
Accepting.
Harry has half a mind to rush back to his rooms, whip out his old map and scour the grounds for Draco, but he thinks he knows it’s better to let Draco come to him. Harry’s had months to come to terms about how he feels about Draco, after all. He reckons if he’s managed to wait this long then he can wait for a few more hours. Or days. Hopefully not days.
“Draco.”
Harry grins against Draco’s shoulder.
Harry inches closer until their noses nudge against each other. Harry hears the sharp intake of breath and his heart starts to flutter like a Snitch’s wings. Puffs of air sweep across his cheek and Harry draws his own shaky breath.
The silence is heavy and uncertain as they make their way up to Harry’s room, and even though Harry’s sure he can walk a straight line without assistance—he thinks he can even do star jumps without falling into a heap of tangled limbs at this point, having been shocked near as sober by the mess he’s managed to get himself into—he still lets Draco hold him up. The physical proximity does nothing to bridge the careful distance that Draco’s enforced since he pushed Harry off, but Draco’s not running for the hills and he’s letting Harry nudge in close, and that’s something, at least.
“Draco—” His mouth is doing things to the slope of Harry’s neck and Harry’s skin burns where Draco’s finger trails down from his stomach to his hips to his thighs until it’s circling slowly, prodding at Harry’s entrance in question. “Fuck, please—” It slips slowly, slick from Draco’s come,
You twist your head to huff at him and end up inhaling the strong, spicy scent of his hair instead.
Harry wants to stir someone’s cauldron. Just not Celestina’s.
“Well, it’s a lump of cheese that I’m particularly fond of,” Harry said, “Besides, I’m sure Molly will—”

Draco cups him through his jeans and gives a firm squeeze.
“Hm.” Kneeling beside the open box just by Draco’s feet, Harry gives the thing a light tap of his knuckles. “Moon Kit?”
Draco’s not going to budge. He settles on, “I do not drool. And the floor in my room is much more comfortable.”
Honestly.
It’s minutes, hours, seasons before they resurface, and when they do it’s only to dive right back in and come crashing against each other again. Draco’s mouth turns from cool and searching to
The crushed moonstone gets transferred to the sapphire-lined pot for safekeeping—
“Always so impatient,” Draco mutters.
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Nothing!” Harry answers, indignant. He glares at the fluffy, white beast who looks very unsympathetic for someone who almost broke Harry’s leg, and says in a lower tone, “Must you, Artemis?”
"You can't expect me to just sit here until class ends."
“Harry—”
"Precisely. What makes you think you can—" Draco looks over at Harry, mid-clockwise stir, then snaps his mouth shut. Maybe the heat was making him see things, but Harry thinks Draco's eyes linger at his exposed skin—a second too long— widen, then dart away.
“I did try to tell you,” Harry says, watching as Draco sets his workplace to rights. “When I came in and you were bottling the Dittany.”
“Sod off,” Draco scowls. His head throbs.
A warm toe traces the sole of Harry’s foot before it’s given a light kick. “I would be deeply offended if you even tried to sneak off before I wake up.”
“I am.”
Harry doesn’t allow his mind to go to any thoughts of stroking.
Outside, people are talking. Whispering. They all know that someone’s here.
“Welcome,” Harry muttered distractedly, “Have you seen Draco?”
You've yet to open it, but you both know what’s inside. He's already wearing his. Green. Silver 'H'. The green and silver you've grown up with.
Draco’s hand twitched in his. He turned in Harry’s arms, and Harry found himself looking into grey eyes filled with grief. Draco looked so lost that Harry’s heart gave a painful squeeze. Behind him, the sun was starting to set, casting a warm glow on Draco’s pale hair. It was now aglow with a warm, rich color— a halo around the pale face that looked so beautiful it made Harry’s insides ache.
“Feeling better?”
Harry splutters. “I am not.”
There’s a steady supply of alcoholic beverages in the room and they’ve all had a bit to drink, but it is past curfew, and it’s a Friday night. And this is as good as tradition.
Harry suspects there isn’t much.
He feels the shiver of magic running through his head and when he raises his hand to check, he breathes a sigh of relief when he feels that the unruly mess was indeed his own hair, and not a bundle of moving, squiggly things.
Draco makes an unintelligible noise, and it’s clear that he’s so focused on crushing the stone that Harry’s words fly over his head. It’s difficult not to grow fond of Draco when Harry gets to see him like this, and crushing his growing affection for the git is not as easy as mashing those brilliant moonstones into powder. Harry knows. He’s tried doing both.
It is such a disorienting thing, Harry thinks— being in the company of someone who makes him hopelessly enamoured one moment, yet irritated as fuck the next. Or both. At the same time. Like what the arse is doing now.
Draco nods. “Tomorrow.” He seems to be at odds with something. Still, Draco reaches out and his thumb skims atop Harry’s lips. “Good night, Harry.”
Despite his lighter tone, the hesitation is clear on Draco’s face, and it somehow eases the rumbling worry that’s been racing through Harry’s mind for the past few minutes.
Apollo pads beside him, and Harry's almost envious of his boundless energy. His stomach rumbles as the scent of delicious curry grows stronger, and he allows himself to close his eyes and breathe it in. His mouth waters in anticipation and—
and a calloused thumb on his lips are all still on the forefront of his mind and Harry can’t help hoping that they mean something.
If he’s being honest, there was a brief moment when he considered actually sitting this one out. But they’ve done this together for months now, ever since Harry started making amends and insisted on helping Draco with the Wolfsbane (maybe with some unsubtle nudging by the Headmistress), and Harry knows he would be pacing about his room right now and wasting his time if he didn’t come.
Harry hesitates, then shoves another spoonful of curry in his mouth. “I think she wants some curry.”
They watch its progress, sliding around both of their bodies, across their shoulders, back down in a circle of white-red-yellow beside their feet.
that’s being coaxed out of Draco’s throat with each stroke of hand and cock, quickening, rapidly growing more urgent by the second, Harry knows he’s not the only one who’s coming dangerously close.
“Who is?” Neville asks, as he opens a foil of milk chocolate and sends it Lavender’s way.
Harry wants to argue that Draco wouldn’t begrudge Lavender her Wolfsbane, not for anything, not when he’s been working so meticulously on it for the past few days as he does for her each month. But Harry’s throat is closing up and his face warms like it’s been lit with a great, bloody
Rage and anguish chase away the last peaceful slivers of sleep just as Harry thinks of someone else seeing Draco right this moment— sleep-soft and languid and open and
“You know you’d get this done much faster if you let me help,” Harry tries.
Harry inputs, tearing his gaze away from Draco’s face for a moment to survey the scene before him. Artemis and Apollo have apparently both released the squeaky toy that is now rolling between them. Helios looks on at Apollo’s excited pawing and at Artemis’ calculated nudging, and Harry can see the wonder behind her pink-red eyes.
Harry’s eyes flutter close as hips give answering thrust, the welcome friction making him groan and dig his fingers into Draco’s thighs.
of glass tears Harry’s gaze away from their snake-guest, and Draco looks so thoroughly displeased that Harry finds it difficult to stop his mouth from twitching. “You are being rather rude, you know.”
The air is fuzzy with his magic, and Harry can feel the pleasant tingle that settles on his skin with each wave of Draco’s wand. Harry’s certain that Neville isn’t going to mind. Nor is Lavender. The set time has always been just a formality. Neville’s door is always open to them, but Harry knows better than to point that out to Draco. Not when silver and moonseed and Valerian root were all flying about in an attempt to return to their proper places. “But you were more concerned about my dirty hands.”
“Would you look at that,” Draco mutters. “Miracles do happen.”
know that’s only partly true.”
“The busty— Oh, you’re very funny,” Harry deadpans.
Harry hesitated. “The truth?”
Harry vaguely hears Neville offering to have him stay the night if he’s too pissed to make it back to his room, but he’s too busy wallowing to supply an answer.
Maybe he’s tipsier than he initially thought.
is clear in the way that she gives him a lingering look before she turns away and leaves them to their own devices.
“Of course it’s alright. Draco—”
Harry rolls his eyes. It may have taken a while—what with the kissing and touching and pressing against each other against darkened patches of wall on the way back to Draco’s chambers—but here they are. The deep-seated urge to kiss Draco and touch him still sizzles atop Harry’s skin, and it takes everything Harry has to stop himself from doing just what Draco’s surmised he might do.
With such a conspicuous absence on both their parts for most of the day, as soon as they entered the Great Hall for dinner together, they were greeted with knowing stares from almost every eye on the staff table. Harry thinks it shouldn’t have come as a shock, not when they were apparently the subject of a number of his colleagues’ long-standing betting pools, the bastards, but he still can’t help but feel flustered every time one of the more senior members of the staff looks their way.
...days like this when Harry feels like he knows what he’s doing, and there’s a drawing of him in his pocket that looks nothing like him, and there’s curry on the cooker that his tune-humming person is probably going to use to bribe him with.
“Do you even know how much of that poor excuse of liquor you’ve managed to imbibe?”
“Fine,” Draco snaps, tugging his foot away, and sends his plate to the sink with an agitated jab of his wand. He stands, the chair scraping loudly and the jarring noise and sudden motion jolts Artemis from her lounging about. She throws Draco an affronted look before she stretches and saunters out of the kitchen, stumpy tail stiff with offense.
, so much more than he deserves and Harry fears one day Draco would find someone else more worthy— who can give him as much as Harry takes each night, who can leave him with something more than Harry can each morning.
Outside, people are talking. Whispering. They all know that Draco's here.
“I’m serious,” Harry mutters. “Cleaning. Tomorrow.”
“Yeah,” Harry returns.
As he lies in bed recalling the warm weight of Draco’s body against his, a deep ache gnaws at his chest and longing prickles under his skin. Something gives, and Harry finally allows himself to take his cock in hand, imagining instead deft, skillful fingers gliding up and down the heated shaft. He rolls his thumb over the head of his cock, teasing the heated flesh slowly. Breath catching, he moves his fingers down, pulling the sensitive skin of his foreskin along with it. His body is taut with frustration and as he starts to move his hand in slow, dragging strokes, he lets himself melt into the covers with relief.
“How is it that you always win, Headmistress?” Lavender sounds petulant, but she’s looking at Minerva with interest, as if she’s about to divulge the secrets of the universe.
“Remind me again why I don’t hate you anymore?” Harry mutters. He wonders if Draco notices how he doesn’t really refute his statement.
Draco must be uncomfortable enough as it is. Even without the knowledge of him playing a part in Harry’s spell mishaps.
Harry also knows that the Stinging Hex that Draco sends his way when he fails to hold in a snigger is undeserved.
“Why don’t you ask her for yourself? It’s rude to talk about someone who’s just there, you know.”
.” He bristles. He’s watching Harry as he swirls his fancy wine, and Harry’s throat suddenly feels parched despite having only just drank his own beverage. Harry’s always been aware of the weight of those grey eyes when they’re trained at him, but it’s only much recently that he’s realized just how often that happens and just how much he likes it when it does. “And anyway, my rooms are by the dungeon,” Draco points out, “Yours is atop a moody, blood-thirsty staircase.”
“There’s no need to get violent.” Harry moves to the far end of the table for good measure. “I can wait.”
It’s with the warm memory of the shape of Draco’s mouth against his that he falls into a dizzying spiral.
A vanishing step would be really useful right now, Harry believes, as he tries not to think about the way his face feels too hot. “I’m not pissed,” Harry insists.
He makes good work of the huge chunks of soil atop Draco’s hair, plucking them off quite effortlessly until there’s a small lump of dirt by Harry’s feet.
“I was wondering whether I’d see you today.”
. The person they know by little else but the names they had chosen to condemn him with.
As if to prove Harry's point, Draco's knee nudges against his as his partner reaches over for some bottled Fairy Wings. Beads of sweat trail down Harry's chest and Harry swipes at them with a disgruntled huff.
“You know that’s not what I mean.” Harry narrows his eyes. “I am not going to be bribed with your curry,” Harry asserts.
It’s a whirlwind of chaos as his kitchen rights itself. And in the middle of all this chaos is Draco Malfoy.
It’s only by the time he’s done (and realizes how he could probably have just
Harry bites down the urge to inform her that
He runs his thumb over the curve of Draco’s arse a few more times before he lets his hands skim over the toned expanse of Draco’s thighs, pleased with the way Draco’s breathing turns more erratic. Harry tilts his head up, placing kisses on the curve of Draco’s jaw, nibbles on the apple-citrus-scented skin of his throat. Draco bares his neck, welcoming Harry’s unrushed assault on the long line of pale skin, sounding his approval with soft gasps of pleasure. Harry sucks a mark on the juncture of neck and shoulder and, with a firm grip on the back of Draco’s knees, pulls.
Minerva’s lips twitch as she peers at them from her place at the center of the staff table, and as his colleagues continue to discuss his apparently wretched impulse control, not for the first time, Harry wonders just how his life has come to this.
And there is that—a moment to breathe again. Draco eases off slightly, mouth still on Harry’s skin, and Harry shudders as he feels the hot breath mark a trail down his jaw to his neck.
, Harry thinks, feeling Draco’s hard length press against his inner thigh. “I hear a ‘but’.”
Draco’s looking up at him from his spot on Harry’s abdomen, his face is a bit blurry but Harry can still make out the spots of pink dusting over his face, and the blooming red marks on the side of his neck. His hair is a blob of white-blond on his head, probably dishevelled from where Harry’s fingers have been running through it earlier.
Heart hammering in his chest, Harry crosses the threshold and stops short, just a few paces from where Draco’s standing. “Aren’t you going to get cleaned up?”
The scars move like an undulating wave as Lavender quips an eyebrow. Harry is so used to it by now that he doesn’t need to remind himself not to stare anymore. “Please, I could see you making eyes at your roast potatoes as soon as I entered the Great Hall.”
He’s still feeling a bit unsteady but he’s slowly and surely coming back to himself. Slowly, because it takes a whole minute before Harry even realizes that he’s alone in the room again, as if the distance of the voice talking to him isn’t already a dead give-away. There’s someone puttering in the background and the familiar noise of clinking glass along with the soft
“Fuck—” with a firm grip on Harry’s hips and a warm mouth sucking on damp skin, Harry thinks he very much likes being shut up like this. He thinks this is the most trouble he’s had with trying to stay coherent. “What happened to ‘not here’?”
“Please, don’t,” Draco said, sounding almost pained, “You don’t know what it feels like to lose a mother.”
Draco’s face is flushed, and there’s a reddening patch of skin from where Harry’s mouth has just been. He smirks, mouth pink and parted, eyes heavy-lidded, and Harry’s cock twitches in his pants. “Payback,” Draco drawls.
The war changed a lot of things.
Draco pretends he doesn’t hear that. He wants to lift his head and look at what Harry’s doing in there, but his head is heavy and his body has decided to become useless and jelly-like. “What exactly are you doing in there?”
Draco raises a hand, and Harry’s mouth snaps shut. He watches the same long, pale fingers drag through white-blond hair. Harry can feel the weariness seep out of Draco in waves as exhaustion softens the hard lines and sharp angles of his face. Heat pools with a surprising rush in his belly. “Not tonight, Harry.”
fine. He is completely alright. It’s just a little headache. He can handle it. “Have you eaten yet? Do you want some tea? Coffee?”
As if to further his point, the
Harry tries to imagine it—how he would take Draco apart, slowly, piece by piece, and watch his careful restraint crumble under Harry’s hands, his mouth, his tongue…
“I have had that thought,” Harry admits, “For a while now.”
“Merlin only knows how.”
Draco leans in, laps at a nipple as he continues to circle Harry’s reddened glans with his thumb, making Harry cry out and arch into his touch. His mouth. Draco.
When he looks at Draco, of course the bloody git is smiling at him, eyes sparkling with something that makes his stomach lurch. And after all this time, he’s still surprised at how warm and open those grey eyes can be— having only been used to cold, hard glares back in the day.
Draco says nothing else to him until he deposits Harry in front of his quarters. “You’re not going to pass out on the floor if I leave you here, are you? I don’t want to traumatize any student who might happen upon you.” He pauses, considering. “Not to mention the potential drool.”
“But Neville’s pet plant has just showered me with dirt and I feel disgusting. And we’re in a
Harry tries very hard not to forget that he’s fond of Lavender Brown now and that, when it comes down to it, she is indeed a good friend. Well, he’s fonder of her than he was back in sixth year when she was too busy being attached to his best mate’s lips and cooing at him. Maybe he should remind her.
“I’ve dragged you back to your room loads of times, too,” Harry turns his attention back to Draco.
“Hey, Draco. Come here.”
behave. Maybe look pretty, if you can manage that."
Apollo looks up at him, tongue lolling out, and merely twists his head to slobber all over Harry’s fingers.
Alcohol-flushed skin colors even more under Harry’s heated gaze. The dusting of color along Draco’s cheeks is striking, and Harry’s fingers are itching to find out whether the dark pink will turn to red underneath his touch.
When he blinks, vision returning, it’s to three pairs of eyes staring at him with varying expressions of interest. It takes a few moments before he realizes exactly what’s just happened.
Because this morning, Draco still hadn’t returned from his mini-trip and a small Draco-sized hole had started to form in Harry’s chest in his prolonged absence.
Draco bristles but goes along with it, knowing that even if he protests, it wouldn’t really change anything. Potter’s stubbornness can give Draco’s a run for his money. Still, he can’t help but feel a tad bit annoyed. “I’m not an invalid, you know. It’s just a headache. I still have full and intact motor function.”
Harry smiled slightly, “Like you’re any better.”
“Yes, very hard to forget what with your jelly thing still attached to my leg, Potter.”
Harry barely spares them a glance as Apollo and Artemis plop on the floor, squeaky toy in between them.
Draco’s eyeing him with concern from the other end of the couch, and Harry has this overwhelming urge to crawl over and smooth the frustrating crease between his brows. Draco looks much better when he’s not frowning.
But Malfoy Manor looked the same as it always did. Save for the telling silence that echoed through the halls as Tippy escorted him to the West Wing, where she has informed him that— “
“Hey—”
“I’m not—” Harry bristles but immediately deflates. No matter how many times he repeats
Harry’s head falls back on the bed, and he’s reduced to a panting mess.
