"Today mate? But it sounded like you were- like you were... y'know.." Ron stuttered. "And then all those hickeys which clearly go under your collar."
"No matter what anyone says, you were never a bad person and you never will be. You've been a bit of a meanie.." Harry laughed and continued, "but it never bothered me as much as you'd think. I always quite loved how creative your insults were. So listen to me right now. I don't care how many times you are called a death eater or scum because I know that's not who you are. You're amazing."
Draco was rather nervous but today was special, and he was feeling more confident. This was probably a one time thing that would never happen again. He leaned down, grasping Harry's length and taking as much as he could into his mouth.
"Somethings wrong i- I keep coming closer..." Harry breathed, his breath warn against Draco's neck. "I can't help it." Draco slowly and unknowingly raised his arms and slid them around Harry's neck.
"Not on purpose! We were both drugged on the potion because we had refused to submit to it earlier. It wasn't like he liked me or anything. It was just the potion..." Draco finished that last part with a frown and a sigh.
Draco immediately complied, leaving his ass set high, hanging off the table for Harry to play with and claim as his own. He was already shivering in anticipation of tonight's sure to be rough escapade. Harry approached him carefully, hands grasping at Draco's ass as soon as it was within reach. The touch was firm but loving and he couldn't help but shake his rear teasingly. He heard Harry groan behind him before another slap landed on his cheeks. He gasped again releasing a breath-taking moan and shook his hips, begging for more.
"Harry, i-" Draco moaned, his hips jerking slightly when Harry slides back down to suck hard. He reached the bottom of his cock and took his balls into his mouth as well. . His tongue caressed and swirled around it as he sucked.  Draco's hips seemed to have a mind of their own as they bucked, repeatedly. Harry pulled off Draco's balls with a pop just when Draco was about to cum making his quiver is disbelief.
With that, he pulled the Marauder's map from his bag and immediately located his future lover. "Courtyard. Perfect."
"Thanks," Harry smiled, softly, putting it away. "I was with them but they're together now so they want alone time." Draco stared in shock.
"Granger and Weasley? I thought Granger liked you or Krum? Weasley? Really? She could've done much better."
"No! Shut up. Did I say anything odd last night? No! Wait- Never mind. I don't care!" he panicked as he ran around the room, grabbing his leather pants and pulling them back up. "Forget this ever happened Potter! It didn't happen. I don't even know what I'm taking about," He tried to convince himself but he just began to sound like a mad man.
Harry grunted, continuing his fast paced thrusts into his lover's tight heat. His hand came down in another slap to Draco's abused ass, making him moan continuously. Harry grinned. He loved the way Draco was moaning for him. It was so enticing, so intoxicating. Despite their usual anger,, there had been no disagreements in bed. In fact, Draco had even been willing to follow orders. The way he writhed and moaned and thrusted his hips back against Harry all added to how amazing he truly was.
The fingers were suddenly gone. Draco inhaled sharply but before he could complain Potter grabbed his shoulders and turned him around. He laid there on his back, legs spread open, cock dripping with pre come. And Harry stared him down, took in every inch of his light skin shamelessly. Draco felt exposed even though they were both naked. His hole twitched, stretched and leaking all the lubricant Potter had rubbed inside him and Potter stared. He fucking stared, jerking himself as he did.
"Happy now? Will you going to shut up and go to sleep?" Harry asked, smugly with a pleasure face. He'd had to spend his evening catering to Draco and didn't feel comfortable getting a shag out of it because Draco was drunk off his arse. Draco was yawning with a flushed face, warm and sweaty and had began snuggling into Harry's pillow. He mumbled something unintelligible over and over again until finally Harry understood.
Two hands groped Draco's ass as he was pushed against countertop. He gasped as Harry massaged his behind, grinding up against him. He was already half hard and Draco wasn't far behind either.
“Yes, all yours!” he said, but gasped as the realisation hit. What was he doing? This was wrong in so many ways but when those lips touched his and that warm wet tongue slid down his throat, he couldn't help it. He belonged to Harry. He wanted this so he'd let Harry get his way.
Everyone was in pairs. Seamus and Romilda , Millicent and Lavender, Neville and Blaise, Pansy and Hermione, Ron and Nott, Dean and Greg and finally Harry and Draco.
"Ugh, Hurry up Potter," Draco's muffled voice muttered, trying to be as incoherent as possible. He had almost got Potter's shirt off, just one more and done! He ran his hands up and down Harry's chest, slowly going down to reach the bulging tent in Harry's trousers, not caring whether Weasley and Granger would hear.
It had been a very adventurous night. Greg had been dared to wear women's underwear for the night. Pansy had been dared to steal something from Snape's office which she somehow managed and Theo had confessed to his crush, a girl in Ravenclaw. Very eventful. But after a shit ton of alcohol, Draco was indeed tipsy, probably a lot worse. And the best idea he had was to 'walk it off'.
"Your mark? You think I wouldn't date you just cause you made a silly mistake?" Harry's heart clenched. That's what he thought? Oh god.
"Oh come on, Harry!" She said, with a terrifying glare. These were the times when she acted like Molly, Harry could see it in Ron's eyes.
"Harry, fuck!" Draco shouted. His body shivered violently as well as his cock as he came, splattering Harry's hand, his sheets, and his own  white shirt which had been barely clinging to his body after it had been unbuttoned and raised when Harry left Harry hickeys.
"Look at me, darling." Draco's head shot up at the name causing a light chuckle from Harry. "You like that name? I'll remember that, he laughed with a wink. Draco laughed giggled too.
"So, what did you want to tell me?" Harry asked, changing the subject as he tried not to notice how hot his body felt when Draco continued to look at him like that.
"Me too, Potter..." Draco gasped, his breaths suddenly shorter and quicker than before. "My hearts pounding and I can't seem to find the cause."
“You're all mine now,” Harry purred in return, stroking Draco's hip. Draco nodded eagerly without thinking.
"Yeah," It was all Harry could say as he looked down at the floor. He had loved it so much. Having Draco in his arms. Hot skin against hot skin. Swollen, red lips and Harry's tongue down Draco's throat. In all honestly, it had been his dream since third year. He loved Draco so much. And now he'd never be able to face him again. Unless.. Maybe he could.
"What do you want, Potter?" Draco refused to meet those eyes again. He looked straight down to the floor. He couldn't risk looking at him.
Harry returned to his bed about twenty minutes later. After that night's excitement, he was tired and didn't want to sleep in any of the others' beds. He turned to his own bed where Draco lay sound asleep. He gently lifted the blanket and slid in next to Draco. He slipped his arm around Dracos waist and settled. Tomorrow morning would be very interesting indeed.
"Yours..." Harry said, quietly. "You were really drunk and I was going to take you to the Slytherin Common Room but you were whispering things in my ear and-"
Draco laughed. "Well I suppose I had to look good for my saviour." He winked back. Harry smiled. Draco was back to his sly, sarcastic self and it was perfect. Then, Harry clicked on.
"Oh shove off, Arsehole," Harry laughed too. "Anyway. I don't know about you, but I'm fucking freezing so I suggest that you and I go get a drink at the three broomsticks. What do you say?" Draco smiled for a moment, his nose red and his body shivering but then his face turned cold and he frowned.
Draco managed to open his eyes and struggled as he helped Harry clean him. The bath was warm and relaxing, only making Draco more tired. The sponge travelled up and down his body, the cinnamon scent filling the small room.
They were back in Hogwarts now, and it was only quarter to three. Harry was dragging Draco through the castle under his cloak promising he was taking him somewhere fun.
"Seriously though, Harry. Who was she?" Ginny grinned. "She has to have been pretty for you to like her-" Just then Hermione strolled over with a confused face.
"Come on. Just tell us. What happened between you two? I thought you were so called enemies. I don't mind you being friends but for goodness sake, get a grip."
"Potter!" he screeched as he leaped from the blankets. What an idiot. He fell flat on his ass with a loud bump and of course woke this woke Harry. FUCK Fuck Fuck. It was the end.
"Potter?" Draco said, slurred. Harry spun round so quick, Draco thought he was going to do a 360 turn but no. His eyes were glued to Draco and only Draco.
There was a sound of grumbling 8th years coming up the stairs. The other Gryffindors were back meaning Draco needed to leave now.
Harry was following Ron and Hermione to the Great Hall for dinner. Apparently, there was going to be a roast tonight with strawberry cheesecake tonight for desert and Harry really didn't want to miss it. He could smell the roast chicken from where he was and he was incredibly hungry, when he felt a sudden urge to go to the room of requirement.
"Um. I'm tired and I had a big lunch. I'm just going to sleep. Night guys," he smiled and fake yawned for good measure. Ron and Hermione smiled back and waved before carrying on their journey, this time holding hands.
Harry released Draco's hands, grabbing his thighs instead and lifting them, shoving and pushing deeper, gripping tighter and tighter until his fingers were numb from the tight grip. He'd leave marks there, crimson lines, and the thought made him moan. Harry bent down again, his mouth reaching Draco's neck. He sucked him there while he fucked hard and fast. Draco fisted his cock with one hand while the other scratched Harry's back repeatedly. Harry lifted his head slightly and reconnected their lips. Although it was rough, it was loving and meaningful.
Harry had just kissed him. Fuck. He had fallen in deep. God, he was beautiful. Draco couldn't wait for later. Him and Harry spending time together. Alone... He was so excited. Now all he could do was wait.
Hogsmeade was busy as usual but it was nice. Harry had missed this over the summer. Eighth year was going well so far, no murderer coming after him repeatedly. The only issue was the fangirls and the depression. People had been lost and mourning was a daily thing. But it was better to remember than to forget.
The moment they walked in, Harry leapt onto Draco knocking him down onto a soft bed with a lush duvet and silk sheets. One second they were looking at each other, the next they were kissing, rough and needy. Draco's arms wrapped around Harry's neck as Harry worked through the buttons of Draco's shirt. Not once did their lips stop touching. Not until Harry realised the time.
Draco looked around. They were on the seventh floor, facing a lovely clean wall which was opposite of a strange tapestry. Then it hit him. Fifth year. That stupid special room Harry had saved him in back during the war. The Room Of Requirement.
"So Harry," Seamus winked as he spoke. "Coming from a fellow gay, I would just love to know who topped. Y'know... for research purposes." Dean laughed at his boyfriends silly question.
Harry stepped through the doors quickly. He hadn't asked for any of this. He had only asked for the room to let him in meaning another person must've been here.
"Please Please Please," he whispered to himself. It had been about five minutes now, his head was feeling slightly better but still. He really needed to get up and leave before whoever he was with woke up too. He slowly raised his head and Oh fuck. It was a million times worse than Weasley. Well, maybe not a million... Weasley was pretty bad but he'd get to that later.
"I saw you wander up the hill and thought you might want your cloak back. I thought you'd be with Granger and Weasley?" Draco replied, folding the invisibility cloak and passing it to him. "Here". He then sat beside him, relaxing his shoulders and leaning back.
A second later Draco's lips had been on his. Draco pulled him backwards so that Harry was pressing him flat against the wall. Draco's lips tasted like fire whiskey, of course but they were also sweet like honey. Harry almost felt drunk on the feeling of his thumbs grazing the blondes back with his palms stuck tight against his hips. Then he remembered that Draco was very drunk so he pulled away; Even drunk, Draco was quite strong and he refused to let go of Harry's neck. Harry could every movement. Draco's bulge again his, Draco's smooth, pale hands in his hair. It was beautiful and god he wanted more. But he couldn't. He had to restrain himself. Draco was drunk. Really drunk so he pulled his face away.
But Harry wasn't quite ready for it to be over. He slowed his thrusts to a snail’s pace, a wrecked sob escaping Draco's lips as his pleasure was denied.
"Do you guys smell Malfoys fucking cologne?" Ron said, in a grumpy voice. It seemed his attitude this morning was getting worse.
He pulled out almost all the way before slamming his hips forward and spearing his lover on his thick cock. Draco screamed in pleasure, hands going to Harry's shoulders and holding onto him for dear life as he set a fast pace. Everything felt so good. From Draco's head to his toes, his body was humming and thrumming with the pleasure seeping from his hips.  Harry groaned from above him and Draco shivered as lips skimmed his neck. There was a soft bite on his collarbone and then sharp suction. Harry began to bite and suck his neck all over, marking him.
"Where did Harry get to?" Hermione asked in a worried tone. They had left him two hours ago saying they'd meet him in the three broomstick's but he hadn't showed.
Harry awoke to a lot of shuffling around him. He slowly sat up, rubbing his face and grabbed his glasses. This morning had already been eventful enough. What the fuck were his dorm mates doing?
"Heyyy. No bullying him," Harry nudged him in the side with his elbow. "They make each other happy and that's all they need."
"Let's just take that bottle away, okay?" Harry soothes, as he slid the bottle out of Dracos hand and placing it on the astronomy table.
"But i- bye.." Even if he had had the chance to finish that sentence, it wouldn't have mattered. In he time span of ten seconds, he had already been dragged back inside the castle. Before he knew it, he found himself under the stairs in the clock tower.
After a moment, Harry pulled away and let Draco lower his waist back onto the mattress. Gently, he helped him put his boxers back on. Once he was fully dressed again, Draco stared at Harry, fixing him with an 'I can't believe you just did that' look.
He slowly stood up his head drooping, a half-full bottle of fire whiskey tightly gripped in his left hand. His other hand was pushed against the wall being the only thing keeping Draco somewhat stable and balanced.
"Then stop talking and let me speak," Harry laughed again. "He is gorgeous, slightly taller than me but not much. He's sarcastic as fuck, hates mornings and he really is gorgeous. He's in Slytherin and we only got together today."
Another slap, this time to his now bare ass. It stung a bit more, but Harry made sure to smooth a hand over the reddened skin before landing another. The pattern continued. A rough smack and then gentle caresses or even a kiss to the abused skin. All over his rear. Both cheeks, and even up to his hips and down to his thighs covered in red smack marks. Around number five, Harry was grinding himself into Draco's leg. Around ten, Draco was rutting against the table. At fifteen, Harry leaned over him, lips scraping past his ear.
They didn't speak for the next couple of minutes but when Harry got up to grab his clothes, Draco reached for his arm.
Harry chuckled at his cheekiness, grabbing the base of his shirt and tearing it from his body. Draco watched him carefully, enjoying being out of the centre  of attention for a moment as he watched Harry reveal his beautiful toned skin. It was one of his favourite things about Harry, despite the scars littering his body, his skin was smooth and gorgeous as he had seen many times when "accidentally" walking passed the Gryffindor quidditch shower rooms.
“This is your punishment for making me wait so long..." he whispered, his hot breath gliding across Draco's neck.
"Yeah, I- I'd like that," he smiled moved closer. Draco nuzzled into his side and they stayed like that for a while enjoying the warmth of each other. .
"I think he just fucking did," Ron replied, mouth wide open. "Well, let's go then!" He grabbed Hermione's arm and started pulling her towards the courtyard.
"You were going to spit in my potion, you prick!" Harry retorted. He pulled out his tongue, Draco doing the same. The pair had tried to take the smallest dose possible but were caught by the portrait of Snape and ended up downing the whole vile. The glistening liquid was warms in their mouths. For Draco, it tasted of cinnamon and honey whereas for Harry it tasted of apples and mint.
"Um," he honestly didn't know what to say until something glimmered from the sunlight shining through the curtains. A white sticky substance on the floor at the side of the bed. Harry was equally confused as he looked at Dracos stunned face until he followed his awe-struck gaze and saw.
"NO. No you don't. You're just imagining things. You can't like me- Why would you ever-" he shouted, panic in his voice. Potter couldn't be serious. After all, there had been at least five years of bullying before everything got way to serious.
"I love you to pieces," Harry said, tiredly but then  saw Ron's glare. He rolled his eyes and carried on. "Platonically. Jeez Ron, I'm not about to steal your girlfriend. Anyway, I love you so much but, in the kindest way possible, please piss off."
Harry had never done that before but the second he laid eyes on Draco's ass, naked before him all he could think about was opening him, filling him up to get all those delicious sounds out of him.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were walking to the library on a cold sunday morning. Hermione had planned that they study since exams were coming up and Harry reluctantly persuaded a grumbling Ron to join them. Harry had been acting strange all week. Everytime he was asked what's wrong only resulted in "I'm fine". And Hermione was getting suspicious.
"Shush! No no no no NO! SHIT!" Draco interrupted, stressing. This wasn't supposed to do this. Fuck Pansy for persuading him to drink. Fuck the Slytherins for not helping him and joining in. Fuck Harry for not stopping him and casting a muffling spell on him last night. Fuck everyone! Please please please tell me I didn't tell him, please god please.. Draco thought.
"Fuck fuck, you- ah... ahhhh P-Potter this is..." he gave a choking moan when Harry began to lick him relentlessly, his own moans reverberating in Draco's skin.
So that was where he was headed that day, and that's how he knew his hair gel wouldn't hold his hair back long enough, because as soon as he picked up Teddy, the little boy ruined his hair. Draco smiled at the memory of the last time he saw his nephew.
“Fuck,” he whispered to himself. Draco looked around his room, taking in what he had done the night before. His clothes laid strewn all over his floor, and apparently he had simply thrown himself onto his bed, not even covering himself with the duvet. He had left that room in worse situations than this.
“In my opinion, I think you should talk to her, sort it out, and then shag the Nott kid. You obviously have feelings for him and you shouldn’t be repressing them.”
“Actually, we’re here to pick you up. We’re heading over to my house and have a couple of drinks,” Harry said. She blinked a few times.
“Most of them were. It took a while for Hogwarts to get back on track, so some of the orphans disappeared before getting called upon to attend. We never found them,” Weasley answered, his voice heavy. Draco hated this. Everything was supposed to be fine after the war ended, and still it seemed like the fight never stopped.
Draco sighed as he stood up, his heart heavy with the memories. He felt himself digging deeper into his loneliness, as if he would never be able to get out of this goddamned state of mind. He’d drown himself in liquor, fuck his brains out occasionally, but he always woke up alone. Always. He wasn’t able to keep his friends close. Apparently he had been closing off Blaise too, the one constant in his life until he decided to contact Andromeda.
He picked up his scattered clothes, vacuumed the carpet, scrubbed the toilet and changed his sheets. Once he was done, he noticed he had nothing better to do, so he threw on a warm sweater, grabbed a hoodie and headed outside for a walk.
“Don’t worry, Tom, I will,” Draco answered. He glanced at the group of ex-Death Eaters, if you could even call them that. They had gotten a bunch of chairs from the other tables, and were gathered in a group of about 15 people. Not all of them had served Voldemort, since Draco only recognized one or two. They were probably just wizards who still believed in pureblood supremacy and were there to spew hatred. Draco decided he wouldn’t let those idiots ruin Tom’s pub, and consequently his job.
“Draco, I’m your friend. I know we haven’t talked in ages, but I still care for you. Blaise told me it hasn’t been easy for you, but drinking isn’t solving anything, is it?”
“Daco,” Ted said, reaching to touch the top of Draco’s head and grabbing onto a fistful of hair. The kid’s ends started getting lighter, reaching the same colour as his big cousin. Ted still couldn’t change his entire hair or any features, but he was learning more and more each day.
“Bye, Crookshanks! I’ll be back soon!” she yelled, and closed the door behind her. She had grabbed a trench coat and pulled on a pair of fuzzy, soft boots. The three held hands and disapparated.
“What if they don’t get killed?” Draco said. “Pansy said they’re trying a less murderous approach this time. Maybe they would keep their promise, and actually let those muggleborns live.”
“I don’t think it’s coming back. They’re just a bunch of idiots who think they’re better than everyone, it probably won’t get big,” Draco said, turning to look at Blaise.
Pansy shifted in her seat and began telling the story of how she infiltrated herself in the group. Turns out she hadn’t gotten very far in ranking, but the information she had gathered was still good enough.
“Sure,” Malfoy answered, and turned around to grab a bottle from the back shelves. He grabbed a glass for scotch and set it in front of Harry. “This is a special Firewhiskey, smoked by dragon fire to give it a special taste,” he said, smirking, then poured a shot into the cup.
“Aw, you brought your cousin!” Pansy said as Draco stepped out of the fireplace. She extended her arms and grabbed Ted from Draco’s arms. Blaise was still awkwardly holding on to the baby bag but didn’t complain.
“Yeah, couldn’t sleep very well,” he said, running a hand through his messy hair. “When’s the meeting?”
There was only a group of old drunks left, and a few loners spread out. Tom had hired another kid to come in from 10pm to 3am to help out Draco. The kid, whose name Draco couldn’t remember, was finishing his break, so Draco was serving, as drunk as he was. He knew he shouldn’t drink on the job, but sometimes strangers challenged him to drink with them, or women liked to pay for his drinks.
“You seen those tossers over there?” Tom asked, pointing his sausage-like finger to the group of ex-Death Eaters Draco had seen when he arrived.
The building they lived in was for wizards only, hidden amongst two other muggle buildings. Thank Merlin their landlord, as long as he was getting paid, didn’t care who lived in his building, since Draco and Blaise had gotten rejected by at least 5 apartments because of their past and had been running out of time to find a place.
“I did,” Draco said, realizing his mistake. “Listen, Ginevra. We can’t meet up anymore. We can’t be seen together. If the wrong person finds out, this could go very badly for you. And I don’t want that. I’ll take this secret friendship of ours to the grave. I promise.”
“Sorry, don’t have any treats,” he said, his speech muffled from holding the cigarette in between his lips. The owl clicked its beak and flew off.
“Hey, Weasley girl,” Draco said, strutting up to where the redhead was laying on the bench in the courtyard, her eyes shut. She didn’t move. “Redhead freak,” he said again, poking her in the shoulder.
“Potter, we all know that being the Boy Who Lived and all, you were going to climb faster than anyone. And it’s not just because you’re famous. You’re a good kid, and have a lot of talent,” Mr Johnson said, uncrossing his arms. “There’s also the fact that I’m an old man, and I want to retire soon.”
After drinking his second cup, Draco headed back into his room. The door to Blaise’s was shut so he could only guess what those two were doing inside. Draco decided he had some cleaning up to do, so he went into frenzy mode as he arranged his room.
It was night by the time Draco got home. He stopped at a pizza place on his way, and was bringing home a steaming hot cheese pizza as a way to apologise to Blaise for being a dick lately. When he got home, Blaise and Pansy were talking in the kitchen.
“Malfoy,” she said, hopping off the table to stand in front of him. “Are you being forced to do something?”
That Saturday started off pretty well. It wasn't raining, although the weather was getting colder as each day passed. Autumn had just started, and Draco really loved this season. He was wearing black pants, white shirt and a black jumper over it . His hair was combed back, although he knew it would get messed up pretty soon.
Hermione stood up, her papers in hand, and cleared her throat. “Good morning. Hum, well, the reason we’re here today is because there’s a pub in Knockturn Alley that’s been heard to host groups who talk about pureblood-supremacy and anti-muggleborn ideologies. Our patrols haven’t been able to identify who’s part of the group, or anything about it really. All we know is that it’s frequented by some high-class wizards, so we should be careful to not cause any trouble with them.”
So Draco told him, as clearly as he could, what happened in a single night. From his encounter with that hate group, to Potter staking him out and asking Draco for help. At the end of his story, Blaise had a worried look etched on his features.
“At 8,” Hermione answered, and took a look at her watch. “Merlin’s beard! It’s almost 8. Let’s go!” She exclaimed, shoving her papers onto her desk and pulling her wand out of her hair. She threw her half eaten apple in the bin, grabbed a different stack of papers and ran outside, pulling Harry with her.
Harry looked up from his hood. “You know there’s a difference, Malfoy. You said you’d changed, but you’re working here, in this place that hosts these hatred meetings, and you don’t even care?”
Draco stood in the middle of the living room, looking at Ted as he walked around the place. He shook his head, the chaotic energy of his aunt still hanging around the room. Blaise walked out, only to see the small chaos Andromeda had left behind.
“I can’t. I’m sorry,” with that, he turned and marched up to the door. He turned to look at her once more, “Stay away from me.”
“He’s staying with us. And you’re gonna help me take care of him,” Draco explained. He picked up the kid once more, gesturing to Blaise to get the baby bag. His friend did so without complaining of having to take care of a toddler.
“This is the weirdest part. Apparently, they noticed that killing off muggleborns didn’t put people on their side the last two times. So, their plans are actually to recruit muggleborns to rise against the Ministry.”
You see, after the war ended, Draco spent a lot of time reconsidering his family, until he came to a conclusion that he needed them more than ever. So, he made up with his aunt Andromeda, who had been hated by his mother ever since she married Ted Tonks, a muggleborn.
“No, you daddy’s money helps you pay the bills,” Andromeda answered, turning around to face him. Her brows were furrowed, and her chocolate eyes were staring right into his. “We both know you stay there to keep yourself distracted. Drinking won’t solve your problems, Draco.”
“Fuck off,” he said, leaving the door open and walking back into his bathroom as she followed. “Why did you wake me up?”
“Got a package for you, Zabini,” Tom said, and grabbed Draco by the cuff of his shirt and pushed him softly through the door. “Good night,” with that, he vanished.
Draco sat on the couch and lit a cigarette, finally. He took a long pull and leaned his head back, sitting there in silence for a few minutes, until a quiet knocking on the window disrupted his peace.
He finished his usual morning tea with Blaise in silence. Their early mornings usually went like that, sitting in silence and sipping tea. Draco washed his cup, grabbed his dark green trench coat, said goodbye to his roommate and disapparated.
They both chuckled as Ron grabbed Harry’s shoulder and apparated them onto Hermione’s front door. She lived in a cozy studio downtown that smelled of green tea and was filled with plants. They knocked on her door and waited. Hermione appeared a few seconds later, wearing a Gryffindor jumper and leggings. Her hair was tied in a messy ponytail. She smiled at them and invited them in.
“I was bored. Blaise said he had some errands to run and left me here. So I thought, why not bother my old friend who has actively avoided me these past few years?”
hey everyone! thank you for reading and supporting me. here's the thing, i got in a writing slump for so long but during quarantine i began rewriting this fic. if you've read it before, please reread from chapter 1 since a lot has changed. i decided to just edit the chapters already posted since there are people who have already bookmarked it and have gotten invested in the story. anyways, i hope y'all enjoy your reading, and thanks again for sticking with me! :)
“Actually, I did. While you were in the pub, I walked around and heard a couple of people talking about how Aurors have been keeping an eye on the place. I pretended I was annoyed with that and started making conversation with them,” Xavier paused, taking a sip of water. “They said they don’t really know anything about those purebloods, and that all they know is that they never see them coming in or out, so they probably use the fireplace or apparate. Also, they told me the owner lives right above the place.”
After being scared of liking guys and being another disappointment to his parents, he and Pansy had sex. They were each other’s firsts, and Draco had actually enjoyed it. From there, they started fucking left and right. He was so glad he didn’t like boys that he couldn’t get enough of Pansy. Until Theodore Nott joined their little group.
Malfoy’s face contorted into a frown. He looked down in thought, crossing his arms and holding his cup.
Ted was bobbing up and down on Draco’s arms. Andromeda had probably gotten here through the Floo network and the kid had apparently enjoyed it. Draco gulped down his nerves and stepped into the hearth.
“I don’t know what to say, Dromeda. I’d love having a room here and not having to share that couch with Jinx. But it’s still Tonks’ room, you don’t have to do this.”
Harry woke up drenched in sweat, again. He was so tired of waking up trembling, crying and occasionally puking every day. Harry hadn’t slept well in so long, and it made him so angry. Voldemort had plagued him ever since he was born, and now, even after his death he still messed with Harry’s mind. He sat up in his bed, reached for his glasses and looked at the time. It was 5am, which meant he had slept for only 2 hours. Yet Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep, so he got up.
She smiled at him, that grin that irradiated warmth. “Good morning to you too. Yes, I’d love to come in,” she said, and pushed past him into the apartment, leaving the suitcases behind for Draco to pick up.
“So, let’s get back on track. I believe you should start with a stakeout, and if you are able to identify an employee, take him in for questioning. Peacefully.” Hermione said. “Then, if we can get any information, we’ll meet again to discuss what to do next.”
After Tonks and Lupin died, their son Ted was handed over to Andromeda, who was doing well taking care of a child once more. But Draco had gotten attached to his nephew, and ended up visiting the two every single weekend.
“Hey, aren’t you Lucius’ kid? What on earth are you doing at this dead end job?” One of them said, his accent showing that he wasn’t british. He had long black hair tied into a low ponytail, a long nose and thin lips etched into a scowl. The man’s hands were full of different family rings, yet Draco couldn’t recognise which one he was from.
“I don’t know if you recall, but my aunt is travelling and she left me to take care of him until Thursday,” Draco answered. “And then he’s all yours, dumbass.”
The thing is, Harry had bought this house thinking that they would all live together. In the end, Hermione wanted her own place and not to share anything with two other guys, and Ron had stayed at the Burrow because Molly couldn’t bear another kid leaving her.
“It’s because of people like you that families like mine are having a hard time getting accepted into society, and why this place is getting watched by Aurors,” Draco spat. “I think it’s time you leave. All of you, get out.”
He ate his breakfast and went out into his morning run. After the war, Harry used his family money to buy a house in Godric’s Hollow. It was a great place for wizards to live, and he wanted to feel close to home. It was small, and Harry was quite terrible at decorating, but it was his, and it gave him a sense of stability. Harry stretched himself and warmed up, and started running.
“I think so,” Draco said, but had never actually given it any thought. While Pansy did flirt with Theo, he had never seen her do anything more daring than that while they were together. Maybe she was in the same situation as he was, but in a hetero way.
“I thought about it, and I think it’s best for Ted to stay here with you. Blaise can help you around,” she said, putting the kid down and letting him wander around. He was about to slam his head on the coffee table when Draco picked him up.
“I think that’s enough drinking for you,” Blaise said, grabbing Draco by the back of his collar and dragging him down the hallway into his bedroom. Draco was too dizzy to object or see what he was doing, but he caught a glimpse of someone laying on Blaise’s bed as they walked past his room.
The next morning he was woken up by someone knocking viciously on his door. Wait, was it morning? Draco rubbed his eyes and glanced at the clock on his bedside table.
The men started either leaving through the Floo network or apparating, and in no time the pub had gone back to its normal chattering. Draco got back to the bar and stood next to Tom, waiting for the death stare that would imply extra hours. Yet when he looked up at his boss, the bald man was staring at the spot where the group had been.
“Ugh. You’ll trust that tosser with a kid? Sorry Drom, but that idiot Potter would most likely forget there’s a baby in the house to take care of.”
“Well, I have to get going,” she said. “Take care of my baby. I know you’ll do great,” Andromeda reached up to kiss Draco on the cheek and give him a quick hug.
“Of course not, Peter. We don’t even know who these guys are, a bunch of Aurors would cause panic and we could lose track of them,” Ron answered.
“No, dumbass. I’m here on a truce. I won’t do anything to you. All I ask is that you don’t talk about this to anyone,” Draco said.
As soon as they got home, Draco made lunch for everyone, and fed Ted as he ate. Blaise and Pansy talked, but Draco sat in silence. Potter had given them a few days so he could sort things out with his boss, and would be contacting them as soon as possible. Once they were done eating, Draco laid Ted to sleep on his own bed, casting protective spells around it so he wouldn’t roll off.
Ron and Hermione nestled on the couch while Harry went into the kitchen to grab some drinks. It was a small kitchen that barely fit a breakfast table. He kept his bottles of alcohol in a top cabinet, so he had to use the accio spell to get them. He summoned a firewhiskey and three glasses and went back to the living room.
He got back 2 hours later. He was sweating beneath his jumper, and the cold air was hurting his lungs, but it felt good to run off his intrusive thoughts. When he ran, he didn’t allow himself to think of anything bad, just the good things from the past and daydreams about his future. It was his daily medicine.
“She says I have way too many whatever creatures hanging around my head, and that it was messing with her, and she couldn’t stand it anymore. I don’t even know what that means, but yeah.”
So Harry lived alone in a three bedroom house, in the same neighbourhood his parents had raised a family, and that he now did the far opposite of that. His heart clenched, thinking about how if Ginny were here, they could be all cuddly and asleep like Ron and Mione. But she wasn’t. She was off playing Quidditch for the Appleby Arrows. Harry couldn’t blame her, she was living her dream. The same way he was living his. Sort of. He’d thought of selling the place, but he couldn’t get himself to do it. Harry had the feeling that he would in fact raise a family here someday. Maybe with Ginny. She’d promised she’d come back.
He turned to look and saw a brown owl sitting on the ledge, waiting. Draco stood up, opened the window and took the letter from the owl’s leg.
“Fine”, Draco huffed. He reached into his back pocket, grabbed his cigarette case and lit a cigarette. He passed one to Andromeda, and they both smoked in silence, watching the sun slowly dip down the horizon. It was half past five when they went back inside. Ted had waddled outside and sat on his grandmother’s lap, and there the three stayed, talking and laughing as if nothing, no secrets, no traumas and no nightmares weighed them down.
“I couldn’t really see his face, since it was covered by a cloak and a mask, but his hands were filled with scars and he had a family ring on almost every finger. He was a big man and I
“Oh. I’m sorry,” Draco said, and he really meant it. During their talks in the greenhouse, he had noticed how much Ginny liked Luna compared to other people she had hooked up with.
Their little group reached the inspection desk. Each of them gave their wand to be checked on, and the boy working at the table asked to see Ted’s bag. Draco rolled his eyes at that, but told Blaise to open it. It was filled with diapers, a few clothes, and a bottle.
Harry followed Malfoy up to the bar and watched as he crouched under the top and reappeared on the other side, to which Harry realized was his queue to sit at the bar. He took a seat in one of the comfortable burgundy stools, fixing his cloak so he wouldn’t sit on it and pull the hood back.
“There’s this friend of mine who needs help, but I’m not an expert on the subject so I promised him I’d ask someone who knew more about it,” Draco started. “He has… conflicting feelings about boys and girls. And since I’ve seen you kiss half the school at parties, not caring about their gender, I wanted to ask. Is it possible to like both?”
Draco waited a few minutes then walked to the greenhouse, where Ginny was sitting on one of the long worktables, her legs crossed and her hair up in a ponytail. He sat on the table opposite of hers so they were facing each other.
The group entered the elevator and stood in awkward silence until they reached the Department of Law Enforcement. It was one of the biggest sections of the Ministry, yet Draco could still recall some of it from the time he came here for trial. It was a crazy time, with his father trying to get into his head, Draco having to solve money issues, and his mother being hysterical.
Tom was one of those scary looking people that when you get to know them are actually incredibly nice. He was over 6ft tall, bald, with a bushy red beard and he was so built that he could probably crack a skull with the tip of his fingers. His nose was crooked, probably from a fight, and his eyes were small and black. Yet, despite his terrifying face, he was one of the nicest people Draco had met.
“So, how was it?” Amber asked. She had dark skin, her braided hair tied up into a ponytail full of little colourful beads. She was tall and stealthy, and was soon becoming one of the best in the Department, apart from Harry and Ron, obviously. Harry had chosen her for this mission because she was incredibly focused and a great spell caster.
“Oh, okay. Hold on, let me just grab my things,” Hermione said, and disappeared behind the door. The boys waited outside, chatting. She came back in less than a minute.
“Malfoy, you’re a great kid, and you know I have nothing but respect for you and your family. But you’re going over the limit,” Tom said, hauling up Draco to stand straight. “You drink yourself stupid every night, and you’re wasting your life working here.”
Draco greeted some acquaintances as he walked over to the bar, spotting a bigger number of those ex-Death Eaters than usual. He didn’t pay much attention to that, just found it odd to see so many of them gathered again. Draco reached the bar and lifted the small door to walk behind it. He spotted his boss and walked to the other end to reach him.
Oh God. Showing up to make plans with Aurors with a half breed baby in tow? He was definitely sealing his family’s reputation in a fucking golden coffin.
Draco turned around and poured himself a scotch. He wasn’t into most muggle things, but the few exceptions were muggle drinks, cigarettes and record players. He shot back the cup, filled another one and started working.
“You’re right. I apologise,” Draco said, lowering his head just slightly. As he turned around to leave, he heard one of the men say “heard he’s been mixing himself with that blood traitor aunt of his, the one that married a mudblood.”
They met up at the greenhouse almost every day for months. Until that goddamned day that he was selected to be the one to kill Dumbledore. That was the last time he and Ginny ever talked directly. He marched into the greenhouse that day, his whole body trembling with fear and anger.
Harry went into the kitchen, got his breakfast ready and as he sat there waiting for his water to boil, he thought about Ginny. She had gone off to play Quidditch after the war, and it had been hard. Harry missed her, and he knew she missed him too, but they both knew they had to follow their own paths. Harry wanted to find himself, give himself a purpose that didn’t rely on any prophecy, destiny or universe bullshit.
Ron was sitting on the corner, his elbow resting on the arm of the couch, propping up his cheek. Hermione was laying on his lap. And they were both asleep. Seriously? It had taken Harry less than a minute to get everything. Or did he dissociate in there? He shrugged and turned on the TV. He wouldn’t not drink just because his friends had fallen asleep.
“What aesthetic? Depressed Slytherin bachelor? Because that’s just what this place screams,” she said. Draco glared at her, but looked around the apartment. He and Blaise liked the colour black, and had chosen that for the theme accidentally, it would seem. The couch was black, and the two armchairs that sat on either side were dark green. There was no dining area, but the kitchen table was also black to match the cabinets. The only touch of colour was a painting Andromeda had done of the beach that hung in the foyer.
Ginny sat there watching him for a couple of moments while Draco stared back. He couldn’t figure out what she was thinking.
Next thing he realised, he was pointing his wand at the man’s throat. The man was old and fat, with sagging skin and crooked teeth, yet he had the balls to talk shit behind Draco’s back.
He then realized he was almost at the filter of the cigarette, so he stashed it into his cigarette butt box and lit another. Smoking was a habit he caught in Hogwarts, when a muggleborn Ravenclaw boy he was hooking up during his fifth year with offered him one. They smoked in the abandoned classrooms in the middle of the night, in between messy kisses and lots of groping. They never went further, since Draco was still exploring his sexuality and chickened out when the boy kneeled in front of him and started fumbling with his pants. Draco knew if he took that step he wouldn’t be able to go back to pretending with girls, so he just left. The boy tried talking to him again, but Draco ignored him.
“What makes you think they’ll talk? They’re probably terrible people for working at a place that hosts anti-muggleborn meetings. They’ll hide what they know, I’m sure of it,” Peter said.
It was around 9pm when they heard the door open. The two friends sat quietly, waiting for the perfect moment. Harry signaled to the other two Aurors to stay put. Harry couldn’t actually believe the person who had come out of the pub.
“You’re quite smart, Ginevra,” Draco said. She bowed her head in mockery then smiled mischievously at him.
“Yes you can, and you will let us through,” Pansy said. “We’re good now, kid. We’re only here to talk,” yet her expression held anything but friendliness.
Draco put down a squirming Ted to let him wobble about the now baby safe space, then turned to look at his aunt. She was dressed simply, in a soft wool jumper she had probably knitted herself, cream coloured trousers and knee-high boots. Her black overcoat hung on her arm.
Dromeda pushed past Draco and opened the door to her daughter’s bedroom. It wasn’t much, just a double bed, a closet and a whole bunch of posters of muggle rock bands glued on the walls. He glanced at his aunt only to see she was crying. He put his arm around her in comfort, and they stood like that until her tears dried. Draco didn’t know how long it had been, but he didn’t care. All he cared about was getting back the time they lost.
“Stop fucking whining, you sad sob,” Blaise said as he grabbed a cup of water and handed it to Draco. “First of all, I have no idea what you’re talking about. You know why? Because you never tell me shit. We sit in silence all the fucking time, and you think it’s because of me, but you’re the one who never opens his mouth about shit.”
“Language, Malfoy,” Potter said, eyeing Ted, who was dozing off on Draco’s lap. “What did you discuss in that meeting?”
Over the next weeks, Draco would appear in the courtyard where Ginny always hung out during breaks. He’d nod towards her, and she would stand up and head to the greenhouse. There, he would smoke cigarettes while he listened to her talk about her own experiences, how she had come to explore her sexuality, and how she was very possibly in love with Luna Lovegood. Well, she never explicitly said that, but the girl would just ramble on and on about the Loony kid, so Draco could just guess Ginny had feelings for her.
Together, they walked up to the desk for inspection. As they crossed the enormous hearth-filled hallway, heads turned and people whispered about their small group.
“Nymphadora’s room. Yeah. I think it’s time. I’ve been putting this off ever since she left home after Hogwarts, and now… I want to turn it into a guest bedroom. For you,” she said, smiling. Her eyes held the sadness of a mother losing her daughter, yet the tears that were forming looked like hopeful tears.
“We need to have a talk about your drinking. Again.” Blaise said. He leaned forward on the couch, resting his elbows on his knees and intertwining his hands.
It was around 2am when Harry heard a knock on the door. He clumsily stood up, drunk with alcohol and sleep. He hadn’t drank much, but he got easily messed up. He reached the door and peeked in the hole. Harry quickly undid his locks and wards, his fingers trembling. It had been so long. He swung open the door.
“You did the right thing. I’m tired of hearing bullshit just because it brings me money,” Tom said, and that was that. He didn’t need to say more.
Draco apparated in front of his aunt’s house, in a small beach town down in East Sussex. He glanced around, admiring the house. It wasn’t much, just a two floor, three bedroom exposed brick wall with vines that slowly but surely were starting to wrap themselves around the front of the house. There was a low fence and a small walkway that led through the carefully handled gardens, which were already looking quite dead because of the cold. On the small front porch sat a rocking chair, and on it laid Jinx, Andromeda’s old, fat cat.
“I think that’s a great idea, mate,” Ron answered. “I’ll apparate us, I don’t wanna get splinched. Again.”
It was Monday morning and Draco was getting ready to pick up his baby cousin, and then he would head to the Ministry. He stood in front of the mirror, trying to calm his nerves. Nowadays, he didn’t really care about family reputation and that sort of bullshit, but there was something quite outrageous about working with Aurors and mingling with a ‘muggle-loving whore and her beast grandson’, which was how pureblood families liked to describe Andromeda and Teddy.
“Ginny,” he said. The girl looked up from her book. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but thank you for being a friend these past months. You surprised me, I never expected you to be so full of depth and feelings. I guess I never expect that of anyone. But still. Thank you.”
“Hum… The house special,” Harry answered, unsure if he was even allowed to drink while on missions. But, at the same time, he had to blend in.
They each grabbed a piece and ate, Pansy starting conversation about their old days at Hogwarts. As the three of them sat there, eating pizza, talking and laughing, Draco felt the walls he had built around himself crack. It wouldn’t be easy, but he could actually get better. He’d fight on the right side this time, his friends beside him, and try to make the world a better place.
The four of them started spending all of their free time together. Pansy and Draco weren’t serious, so she would always hit on Theo. The kid was attractive, his sharp jawline and long, roman nose making his face completely harmonious. But whenever Draco and Theo were alone, all Draco could feel was his body all tingly, his hands sweaty and his dick going hard. And that was without touching each other.
“You don’t know the lengths people will go for money,” Ron said, scowling. He had never liked Peter.
Draco apparated into the back room of the pub, where employees kept their things and took their breaks. He shrugged off his mossy green trench coat, then took off his jumper, and carefully put it in his locker so they wouldn’t get wrinkled. He fixed his white collar, smoothed out his hair and headed inside. It was a Saturday, so the place was quite crowded. The walls of the pub were painted dark green, and for seating they had burgundy lounge armchairs in groups of three or four with low tables made of mahogany in the middle of them. The bar consisted of the same wood, with stools made of the same material from the armchairs standing in front of the bar, for the loners or those weirdos who liked to talk to the bartender all night.
“Just tipsy. Malfoy gave me this special firewhiskey,” he said. “How about we pick up Mione and head over to my house?”
“Are you sure it’s safe to tell the Aurors? While I want this to end, I don’t fully trust them,” Draco said, crossing his leg over his knee.
“Fine, don’t tell me. It’s not like you’ve told me every detail about Nott’s body, even his dick. And now all of a sudden we can’t hangout anymore? What am I to you, a plant that you just stare at and tell all about your gay adventures?”
Draco lowered his cup as he looked at his roommate, trying to process the information. He was still drunk as hell, his head spinning, so it was hard to focus his vision on Blaise.
He sat back down on the couch and opened the letter. His heart started racing as he recognised the handwriting, which had once been tidy and neat, now scribbled forcefully, yet the traces of an aristocratic man still remained. Draco didn’t know how, but apparently being a Malfoy gave you privileges even in Azkaban, so he unfurled the paper and started reading the letter from his father.
“I don’t know. We were waiting for the right moment, but you saw her on my bed yesterday, so we just thought ‘fuck it’”.
“You’re so fucking hammered you won’t even remember this. Come on, let’s go,” Tom dragged Draco to the staff room to grab his things, then apparated them to Draco’s apartment.
The girl pulled out a couple of blank papers and a quill which she enchanted to write down as they spoke. It reminded Draco of that bitch Skeeter, which had done quite a good job of slandering his name after the war.
It was weird, but at the same time, Draco felt like he was starting to accept himself. When Ginny finished talking, he would tell her about his upbringing, the prejudice rooted into him, and sometimes mention Nott. Sometimes. Okay, maybe a couple of times.
Harry walked towards his old nemesis, his face pale and contrasting against the dark. “Long time no see, Malfoy.”
“If you’ve truly changed, you’ll help us, Malfoy. We need to stop this before it spreads, again,” Harry said. He wished he could say more. He wanted to pour his heart out to someone, anyone, but he couldn’t spill all his fear on Malfoy at a pub in Knockturn Alley. That would just be completely awkward.
It took Draco a few moments to process the information. On one side, he found it hard to believe that Pansy would infiltrate herself into the group for the sake of the greater good, but at the same time, Draco had changed too. And Pansy had never lowered herself to Draco’s level. She was just lost at the time and found her comfort in people who thought outside the good-bad division of the world.
will you do us the favour of calling upon Potter and telling him that his friends are here to talk? I have shit to do, Josh, so you better be quick,” said Blaise. He smiled drily, the grin never reaching his eyes.
“Hey, Xavier, will you show them to the meeting room? I’m gonna get Ron and Hermione,” Harry addressed a man who was passing by. Draco didn’t notice who it was until the bloke stood right in front of them, his face completely bland and common. Harry then passed Ted to Draco and stalked off to find his friends.
Draco turned around and stripped off his clothes, not even bothering to clean himself up. He was too tired and way too drunk to think about those things. So all he did was lay on his neatly made bed, close his eyes and fall into deep sleep.
Those were the last words they had exchanged. It pained Draco to know that their friendship could have flourished, that maybe she really could have helped him. Sometimes he wondered what would have happened if he had never approached the strange and feisty redhead. He probably would have ended up fucking Theo without talking to Pansy first, and would have broken apart their group.
“Pansy, yeah. Now shut the fuck up and go to sleep,” with that, he shoved Draco into his room and slammed the door shut.
The good thing was Hermione’s office was located on the same floor as the Department of Law Enforcement. The bad thing was, that place was one of the biggest departments in the Ministry. They raced like crazy across the floor, crossing multiple offices, bumping into wizards, until what finally stopped them was a red-headed wall that appeared in front of them.
“Good evening, gentlemen. Need anything over here?” he asked. Draco hated being a waiter, he preferred staying at the bar and being able to watch everything, but he tried to swallow his pride as he spoke to them.
“No they won’t. You know I don’t give a fuck. I’m only doing this because it’s the right thing to do,” Draco took another sip of his water. “Will you help me?”
Draco and his aunt spent the whole afternoon rearranging Nymphadora’s bedroom. It wouldn’t have taken so long if it weren’t for the crying breaks Andromeda took every time she found something that reminded her of her daughter, something she should’ve probably expected, since it was her daughter’s bedroom after all.
The building they lived in was near a park, so that was where Draco was headed. There were muggle children playing on the swings, their cheeks red because of the cold autumn chill. Draco sat on a bench and lit a cigarette.
“What about it?” Draco asked, crossing his arms in defense. He glanced at Pansy, which had a look of worry etched on her face. “And does she have to be here?”
“I know, but it sure does help me ignore it,” he said, to which earned him a smack on the arm. “Ow! See, if I was hammered right now I wouldn’t even have felt that.” Dromeda hit him again and glared at him as he walked past the entryway and into the living room, taking in the faint smell of vanilla mixed in with sea-salt. It was a weird combination, but Draco loved it.
“Malfoy,” Ron said in an unfriendly tone. Draco looked at him, seeing the resemblance with the only girl of the Weasley siblings.
One day Draco had walked out onto the courtyard just to find Ginny was nowhere in sight. He walked down to the greenhouse in the hopes of finding her there. And there the girl was. She was sitting on her usual table, her hair disheveled, her eyes red and puffy and cheeks tear stained.
“There isn’t, Pansy. I’m just tired of all this bullshit. I just want some peace of mind. Which is something you’re making very hard to obtain right now,” Draco said. He peeked back into his room, where Pansy was picking at her nails. The shirt she was wearing had ridden up, showing most of her legs.
Draco and Blaise headed down to the lobby to use the Floo network fireplace. It wasn’t safe to apparate with a baby since they were squirmish little creatures and the popping sound could harm their ears. Blaise grabbed a handful of powder, stepped into the fireplace, said their location and vanished.
He shook the memory out of his head since it made his heart clench. He hated the way his parents had raised him. When Draco joined Voldemort, he always knew something wasn’t right, but at the same time, it made his parents proud in a way they had never been, so it felt so good going home to them and getting praised.
“I know. But it’ll be good for you both, now that we’re all doing fine,” Draco said, a lump rising in his throat because of the lie. His mother wasn’t fine, not at all, and he felt terrible for leaving her all alone locked in a country home in the cold northern England, but at the same time, he still had a life to live. “Come on, auntie, don’t be a chicken. I’ll take care of Ted, stay here a few days.”
They arrived at the meeting room just in time, and the Head Auror hadn’t even arrived yet. Harry, Ron and Hermione sat beside each other on one side of the table. A few more Aurors filed in, and soon came the Head Auror, an old, black man named Will Johnson, who was probably going to retire as soon as they found a substitute.
Draco stepped out around half an hour later. He had soaked in the hot water to try to make himself feel better. His stomach hurt, his head was pounding and his skin felt tingly. He hated the bad hangovers.
“Well, I’m gonna start from the beginning,” Harry said, looking around to see if anyone was listening. “We’ve heard of the meetings that have been happening here, Malfoy. Only thing is, this place is actually quite secretive, so we didn’t even know who worked here. We were just waiting for someone to come out,” he continued, taking another sip from his drink.
“There’s a chance. The problem is, they can keep the promise to the ones who joined them. What about those who denied them? Who stood in their way? They wouldn’t go after the muggleborns only. All of us are fucked,” Potter said, gesturing to all in the room.
Malfoy watched as Harry took a sip. It was strong, but the smoked taste was marvelous. Harry nodded at Draco in approval.
“What!?” The couple exclaimed. Hermione engulfed Harry in a hug, while Ron gave him a few pats on the back.
“Maybe, but we don’t know who works there. We know who the owner is, but that means we’ll have to wait for closing time to talk to him.” Hermione said.
“I like this place,” Draco answered, his face serious. He rarely smiled, and he definitely wouldn’t waste his emotions on supremacist scum.
Potter turned to Hermione and nudged her, breaking her glare at Pansy. “Hermione, you can start now.”
Draco stared at his door for a few moments. So Blaise is fucking Pansy, huh? He thought. I knew it. Blaise had been sneaking off a lot lately and acting weird whenever they mentioned their old school friends. There was one time when they talked about their old Slytherin gang, and Blaise had known quite a lot about what Pansy was up to, yet neither of them knew where Theodore Nott had gone off to. He could be dead for all they knew.
“I’m serious, Malfoy. We need to have a chat about something that’s been going on in your pub.” Harry answered, playing the honesty card.
“You wouldn’t. Everyone knows you’re on thin ice with the Ministry. Besides, we’re not doing anything wrong, it’s just a group of old friends gathering after a long time,” the man smirked, his voice heavy with accent, gesturing to the people around him.
“Blaise and I are kind of a package deal,” Draco answered. “And Pansy has decided to join us too,” he added after receiving a smack on the arm.
At around 9pm, he took his cigarette break. Draco went out into the alley, leaning against the wall as he smoked. The street was strangely deserted for a Saturday night, but at the same time, it was still early. He let his mind wander into earlier in the day, and he thought about that trip his aunt was taking to see his mother. The last time the two sisters had seen each other was on the Malfoy trial, where Andromeda testified for Draco, and back then they hadn’t had a chance to talk much because of the chaos that had been after Lucius’ conviction. He hoped the visit would be a good thing for both of them.
Harry sighed and threw his head back against the beanbag, raising the Firewhiskey bottle to his lips and chugging. He was so tired of being tired, of having nightmares, and feeling like he was getting behind on the paths of life. But at the same time, he was only 20. He still had some time. So he drank, alone, watching TV on a Saturday night.
“You brought Ted?” Harry asked, reaching out to grab the baby from Pansy’s arms. “How stupid are you, Malfoy?”
Harry chuckled at Ron. Having his friends here with him, every day, after all these years, was what was keeping him sane.
The meeting extended for more than two hours, in which Pansy did most of the talking. According to Pansy, that bloke at the Dragonfire Pub was one of the Spectre’s emissaries, and he was indeed just having a few drinks with his ‘friends’. In the end, they had a good picture of the group, and what they knew was:
“Right,” Draco said, and stood up. “I’m gonna make myself my hangover cure, and would like to be left alone. Excuse me.”
“Good morning, everyone. Ms Granger, please update us on the meaning of this meeting.” Mr Johnson said.
It was getting late, and the pub was getting empty. Since it had been such a busy night, Draco hadn’t been able to stop and chat with some acquaintances that bought him drinks, so he had compensated by drinking in between servings. Now, it was 2am and Draco was sitting on the bar sipping cheap scotch, waiting for the end of his shift. His head was getting dizzier by the minute.
Draco heard the door open and looked up. Blaise was wearing his pyjama shorts and a white shirt, his eyes heavy from just being woken up.
He stayed there in shock for a couple of minutes. His dream had come true. Ever since Professor McGonagall had told him he had the vocation to become an Auror, Harry dreamed of a future of peace and fighting for justice. And then his dream had become true, he had gotten a job as an Auror. And it was getting even better. He would be able to transform that place, the way he had wanted to ever since he stepped in there.
And so the three Slytherins headed home in silence, their minds reeling and hearts heavy. Draco understood politics very well, having been involved ever since he was a child thanks to his father. He felt like they were missing a piece. How could the Council tear down the Ministry without someone on the inside? He was sure that nowadays they did a thorough background check on anyone who got a position there. Draco was tired, hungry, and in dire need of a fag.
“Keep your hood up and walk behind me. I don’t want anyone bothering us, so don’t talk to anyone,” he said, and pushed past Harry. Harry followed, feeling a little silly and very much out of place. The pub was very well decorated, dimly lit and quite crowded. The low tables surrounded by armchairs were full, yet the bar was empty.
. He remembered he was supposed to babysit Ted. How was he supposed to go to that meeting when he had to take care of a baby?
Andromeda pulled out her wand, and with a flick of her wrist, the corners of the tables were protected, the drawers locked, and the couch covered in colourful sheets.
“I can’t believe we went through all that bullshit, fought for the wrong side, and now it’s all coming back again.”
“Okay, back it up a bit,” Granger said. “What would happen to the muggleborns of the Council if they succeeded in destroying the Ministry?”
“I sure do. Your little sister went lengths with me just for some change, back in the day,” Peter said, crossing his hands behind his head.
The group arrived at around a quarter past seven, and there they waited for someone to exit. The noise inside was loud, so it must’ve been pretty crowded. Harry and Ron settled on a crippling bench beside the employees’ door. And waited.
“What happened?” he asked, sitting on the table in front of her. It took Ginny a few minutes to compose herself. Draco passed her a water bottle, which she chugged to the bottom.
“We can ask to talk only to the three of them. They’re idiots, but we know how they’re always in it for the good,” Blaise said.
The three stalked past the garden, onto the back porch and into the house. The living room consisted of a leather couch, a wooden coffee table, a couple of beanbags and a TV. On the wall behind the TV Harry had hung a big Gryffindor flag. Beside the front door were the stairs that led to the bedroom, and at the far left was the door to the kitchen.
“I don’t know, Malfoy. Harry’s a lovely person and I’ve always liked him. I think deep down I was never over him.”
Draco didn’t really like cats, but he made an exception to Jinx. He was clingy and always wanted belly pats, but after much insisting, Draco finally gave in. He walked up to the porch, and once Jinx spotted Draco, he jumped off the chair and started meowing like crazy. Draco reached down and scratched the lumpy cat behind his ears, making him purr.
“I know it’s hard, but in our job we mustn’t let emotions get the best of ourselves. Much less some taunting from someone who clearly had inferior brain capacity,” Mr Johnson said, unfreezing Harry and Ron, who fell clumsily on the table. They scrambled to get back onto their seats. He turned to sit back down and whispered to himself “honestly, they’ll take in anyone these days.”
Tom knocked and waited for Blaise to open. Draco was leaning his head on the threshold, his eyes closed. His head was spinning, a million thoughts racing through his head. As drunk as he was, he could make some sense of what Tom had said. He was wasting his life working at the Dragonfire Pub, but what else could he do? He didn’t really enjoy anything in life other than spending time with his family. Everything was still so fucked up that he would never be able to get a decent job. Draco thought about what Potter had said, about knowing at last what it felt to be excluded from society.
“Great fucking friend. You disappeared after the war, hiding like a little mouse, and now you come back and think it’s all good?” Draco leaned forward, his wet hair falling onto his face. “Tell me, Pansy. What have you been up to all these years that you decide to reappear now? What have you been up to that you decide that you have to waltz back into my life by shagging my best friend, out of all the ways you could’ve gotten in contact?”
As the meeting dragged on, Ted started to get hungry and moody, and they decided to postpone it for when they had gathered more information. No roles were settled, since Potter needed approval from the Head Auror first.
“I won’t talk to you if you keep offending me, ferret,” she said, opening her eyes to look at him. Draco was towering over her. He rolled his eyes at the nickname. “Treat me with decency and I might consider listening to what you have to say.”
“Great. Head down to the Ministry on Monday,” Harry answered. Malfoy hesitated, as if he were going to object, but didn’t say anything. He nodded at Harry, who turned around and left through the small red door.
He looked at himself in the mirror, running a hand through his hair, which was already messy even if he had just gotten out of the shower. Harry halfheartedly flexed his muscles, which had gotten bigger after all his Auror training. He didn’t care if he was muscly now. Actually, he had never cared about his appearance. All he wanted nowadays was to keep everyone safe, especially those he loved.
Draco chuckled and shook his head, “Yeah, I’ve been caught up on work,” he answered, smile fading. The truth is, most weekends he couldn’t get himself to wake up before 4pm, which didn’t give him much time to do anything, since his shift started at 6pm.
Potter appeared a few minutes later, Weasley and the Granger girl in tow. The three took a seat across from them, and Xavier stayed standing up beside the now closed door.
Out of the shadows, a pair of round glasses, messy hair and that stupid lightning scar appeared. “Long time no see, Malfoy.”
After a day full of meetings and paperwork, they left for their stakeout at 7pm. Harry was leading the mission, and his group consisted of himself, Ron, and two other Aurors, Amber and Xavier. Harry and Ron would stay on one side of the pub, and Amber and Xavier on the other. They apparated into Diagon Alley, and walked all the way to Knockturn Alley, trying to blend in. Amber and Xavier were walking behind them, acting as a drunk couple, and Harry and Ron had covered themselves with their cloaks and tried to act unsuspicious. They could’ve used the Invisibility Cloak, but their approach was supposed to be peaceful, so a surprise attack would do no good.
“We’re going with you tomorrow to tell Potter and his idiot friends what we know,” Pansy said. He noticed she had thrown on a pair of leggings. So she had clothes. What was that in my room about?
“Hello, dear,” she said, stretching her arms out and pulling Draco into a hug. She smelled of sea-breeze, cookies and home. She pulled away and her smile melted into a frown. “We’ve missed you! Are you that busy that you couldn’t find time for your family?” Andromeda said.
Over the years, Draco had forced himself to do as many things as possible as to not let his mind slip into the place he dreaded. So days like this, lazy Sundays with nothing much to do, were the worst for him. Those days were when he noticed how utterly alone he was. He had always been alone. As a child, his father would be off sucking up to some high ranking officer in the Ministry, and his mother would always be busy with running the Manor. So that left him no one to play, since his parents never let him play with the muggle neighbours, always forcing into him the idea that it was better to be alone than in the company of muggles.
Draco sighed and waited for his water to heat. He had a massive hangover, and Pansy definitely wasn’t helping. He hopped in the shower once the temperature was perfect.
“Good morning, prick,” Standing in front of him was Pansy, wearing one of Blaise’s shirts and possibly only her underwear underneath.
“What may I get you?” Malfoy asked, resting his hands on the counter. The dim lighting made his eyes look black.
Xavier, the other member, was a small, scrawny man. He had brown hair and brown eyes, with an incredibly common face, and was as quiet as a mouse. And that was his advantage. He could blend in a crowd and no one would notice. Harry once saw him meddle himself into a small group of friends that didn’t notice he wasn’t part of the group. Xavier could listen to things no one could.
They reached the meeting room, a small place with a wooden table and multiple chairs around it. No one else was there. Draco took a seat in the middle chair, and his friends sat on either side of him.
Mr Johnson was still quite strong, yet you could see he was tired and done with the Auror life. He walked over to the head of the table, and sat down painfully, judging by the look on his face.
Pansy nodded. “Only saw him in a meeting. He goes by the Spectre, never learned his real name. The group is called Council of The Spectre.”
“Peter. I do not tolerate this kind of disrespect. The Weasley family is incredibly esteemed in the Ministry, and I will not stand for this harassment. Leave,” said the Head Auror, and Peter scrambled up to leave. He turned to the frozen pair on the table and shook his head.
He chose his usual outfit, a black button up shirt and black trousers. He threw a sweater over it, knowing it would be cold outside, and put on a pair of black boots. Draco was combing his hair back when he heard a knock on the front door. He waited for Blaise to answer it, but apparently he was caught up in something in his room. Draco trudged to the foyer, and in front of him stood Andromeda, Teddy bundled up in warm clothes on her arms.
Draco heard the door open, so he straightened up to see his aunt. She still looked beautiful, even after going through so much. Her light brown hair shone with white strands, and her brown eyes still shone with the loving, kind glow as they always had. She had crow’s feet, but Draco thought they accentuated her smile even more, as if they were a mark of those who had always been cheerful. She still moved around the house as if she were twenty years old, running after Teddy, cooking, cleaning, and painting.
Draco took a seat on the armchair beside the couch and turned to look at the two. It wasn’t the easiest thing to see them together, since Draco and Pansy dated for like a year in Hogwarts, but he had so much going on after the war that he rarely thought about Pansy. And now she was back in his life and fucking his best friend. Great.
Draco looked at her in silence. He didn’t know how it happened, but he had grown fond of the Weasley girl, and seeing her like that messed with him.
“Why thank you,” She replied, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Let me get you some drinks.”
“Oh- Harry, Harry Potter,” He let his hand out, gently shaking the man’s hand. Draco eyed Harry who interrupted him, but not on purpose.
“Students,” A man spoke up with a heavy tone. “Professor Snape, your chemistry teacher,” He added, eyeing the classroom with absolutely no expression on his face, in fact he seemed rather bothered. “Open your textbooks to page 532.” Harry listened, but his mind was pondering on the encounter with Draco, and he was still furious. He glanced at him and saw Draco whispering to Pansy. The two eyed Harry, and that only infuriated him even more. He didn’t want to start a scene, especially on his first day but he knew the two were bad mouthing him.
“I apologise,” Harry huffed, and Draco paused. “I’m okay.” Hermione and Ron stood a few feet away from the two.
“What? She’s friends with that Malfoy guy,” He snapped back at Hermione. Harry watched Pansy, staring at the smug look painted on her face as she grabbed her uniform.
“Harry, Ron!” Hermione swung their door open, seeing the two asleep in bed. Her eyebrows knitted, and she searched the room for an object. On Ron’s table laid a mini horn, and Hermione smirked at the idea she had in mind. She stood between their beds, pressing on the horn. It alarmed through the room as Harry and Ron jolted, their bodies shooting up.
High school was one thing, but college was another. Being a young adult, becoming independent as a person and financially. Being responsible, it takes a lot. And it’s something Harry wasn’t very prepared for. Living with his Aunt and Uncle, Vernon and Petunia and his brat of a Cousin Dudley, wasn’t much of a joy for him and in a way, he was quite relieved to go off to college. He reminisced about his childhood and his high school years, and how it all went by too fast. What broke his heart was that he wished his parents would have seen their son grow into a young man, but deep down he knew that they were looking down on him. They’re watching the man he’s become.
“It’s no fuss,” Draco told Harry. “I’ll leave you be.” They all watched Draco, Blaise and Pansy leave the dancefloor.
“Maybe talk to her tonight,” Harry suggested, removing his grey shirt from his torso and putting a plain, black jumper.
“Absolute children,” Snape sneered, “You’re in college for god’s sake, and it’s your first day.” Harry didn’t expect his conversation with Draco to turn that way, and he never wanted it to escalate. He felt disappointed in himself, and he wasn’t prepared for his meeting with Professor McGonagall. Draco Malfoy is going to make his college life a living hell,
“No, no, it’s fine,” He yelled, grasping a beer bottle. “I just wanted to welcome a new year with a party, so have as much fun as you want, get piss drunk or go dance!” Hermione joined them, handing them two martinis.
“What the fuck happened?” Draco rose his voice as Blaise yelled for Ron and Hermione. Draco held Harry whose head kept falling back, and so he placed Harry’s head safely into his palm.
“Draco and Blaise stay here. We’ll just see you tomorrow morning,” Hermione pulled the car door shut as did Ron. The two Slytherin students watched the car drive away, and Draco felt a burning pit cave inside his stomach. He didn’t exactly like the boy, but he didn’t hate him either. In fact, he felt horrible over what happened and all he wanted to do was crawl in his bed and sleep the night -away.
“Students, in ten minutes you will be appointed to your first class at Hogwarts college. Make yourselves comfortable and familiar within these walls, and may you focus on your education, but also enjoy yourselves,” The old woman concluded. “You are dismissed.”
An old man who was formally dressed up with a suit stood before all the students and the hall went quiet. He had a long beard and long hair that rested on his chest in the colour of ash. “Students, may I all welcome you to the college of Hogwarts,” He announced, receiving an applause from everyone. Many other professors stood beside him, eyeing the audience. “I am Professor Dumbledore, and may you all be introduced to your professor’s when you attend your classes. This may be confronting, that I do understand but it is also a new chapter.”
“Alright, sweet I have liquor too,” Blaise responded, “And nah, I’ve run out.” Ron scrunched his face as he listened to their conversation.
“Sit down,” McGonagall ordered, her eyes not leaving Pansy. “I’m extremely disappointed to hear this news. It’s the beginning of the school year, and Lord help me you will face serious consequences as a result of your actions,” She spoke to Pansy. Harry’s eyes fixated on the brunette girl. “Mr Malfoy and Mr Zabini have explained to us what occurred that night. Mr Potter,” McGonagall laid her palm out towards him, “I’m very sorry that this happened. I have contacted your Aunt and Uncle about it. They are fully aware.” Harry swallowed, thinking about how stressed Aunt Petunia probably was.
“Harry, that’s wonderful then. It’s better to start the year like this,” Hermione grinned, her smile leaving when the Malfoy’s conversation grew louder. They all watched as Lucius toned his voice down, standing in front of a very still Draco who almost appeared afraid.
“Guys don’t fight otherwise I’m going to have to kick the both of you out and I don’t want to do that, don’t give me a reason to,” Cedric said. Draco glanced at the tall brunette and then looked back at Harry.
Harry sat on the step on his porch, fiddling with his car keys as he remained deep in his thoughts. He gazed at his neighbourhood, the neighbourhood that he’d only see during his college break. Aunt Petunia opened the front door, joining the brunette boy. She was quiet for a few seconds, and then breathed in as she fiddled with a golden necklace between her fingers.
“Fucking prick,” Draco snapped, jumping from his seat. Harry didn’t flinch, instead he also stood up.
“I didn’t do anything!” He barked at Ron, stepping forward and leaving the smallest gap between the two.
“We’re not friends. I’d say we don’t dislike each other anymore though. We’re neutral,” The Gryffindor hummed. Hermione and Ron paused.
“I just wanted Harry to loosen up so I put a powder in his drink, it’s just a funny thing he’s gonna be-“
“I’ve told you the truth. I caught you when you blacked out. Yeah, you’re not my favourite person but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried when you fell. Look,” Draco huffed, “I haven’t spoke to Pansy since last night. Blaise and I aren’t happy with her, and she’s going to face serious consequences with Snape and McGonagall and that’s all I can tell you. You think I’m proud of what Pansy did?” Harry looked anywhere but at Draco’s alarmingly sky-blue eyes.
“Draco,” A voice echoed through the hallway, capturing many of the student’s attention. Draco watched his father approach him and Harry.
They rushed up the many flights of stairs to get to their room. “I can’t wait for the feast,” He turned to Harry, jogging backwards. “Like, how much food is there even gonna b-“ Ron bumped into another boy, his body jolting back.
“You know, you don’t have to tell me, Draco.” He blinked at the sound of his name leave her lips. “You don’t know me, and I don’t know you. So, we can just sit here.” A slight weight was lifted from his shoulders, and the tight knot pitted in his stomach unravelled.
“A game? We’re at a party let’s get pissed or something,” Ron shouted, shoving a shot of vodka in his mouth that burned his throat. Harry squinted at Ron’s expression.
“Goodbye, I will visit on my break,” Harry spoke out before he stepped in his car and shut the door, leaving his neighbourhood.
“There’s flyers about the party all over the school with his number on it dummy, I just wanted to text him about details. I also want to help him decorate the hall.”
“You look beautiful,” Harry told her, looking at the tight black dress that complimented her curves. Ron stared, for a bit too long.
“That’s alright,” Harry said, fluffing his hair with another towel which strands of his chocolate brown hair stick up in different directions.
“Hi, Luna. It’s nice of you to do that, I appreciate it. I’m fine thanks I’m just a little lost,” He spoke, gripping onto his bag of toiletries, “Well I’m going to have a shower, it was a pleasure meeting you,” He waved to her and she did the same. She watched him rush off, wishing she had time to have a conversation with him. He entered the empty bathroom, setting his bag down and taking a breath. He removed his pyjamas and stepped into the shower, letting the warm water trickle down his face. He hadn’t seen any teachers yet, but he knew that he’d be questioned about what happened last night. He felt anger about what Pansy did, and it only made him question if Draco Malfoy was in on it too. After he scrubbed himself and was finished drowning in his own thoughts, he dried himself off and wrapped his towel around his waist, stepping out.
The next morning wasn’t a good morning for a few of the students of Hogwarts. Some had an amazing night, and others not so much. Harry awoke, rubbing his eyes before he checked the time on his phone, the beaming light making him squint. It was a Sunday, so waking up a little late wasn’t any harm. He wearily looked around the room, seeing Ron scrolling through his phone.
“Eh,” Ron brushed it off and walked to a corner on his side of the room to change. “You think Malfoy’s gonna start a fight with you?” He said, his voice mumbled from a distance.
“Blimey… it’s beautiful ain’t it,” A voice spoke. Harry turned to his side to see a boy with bright coral hair. It was honestly hard to miss the boy. Harry parted his lips to speak, “Oh, I’m Ron Weasley,” The boy introduced himself before Harry could talk, reaching his hand out.
“Go ahead but be careful please, otherwise we’re going to have to babysit you,” Hermione sipped on a red cup full of lemonade. Ron suddenly pulled Hermione against his body, his palm pressing on the small of her back. He danced with her as she threw her head back with laughter. Harry softly smiled at the sight; he didn’t want to ruin their moment.
“Just a mix of soda and vodka.” Harry nodded, and the girl gently grasped his wrist, pulling him to the side of the dancefloor. “Harry is joining us,” She told Draco and Blaise who gave her a look.
“Have a drink, loosen up,” She passed him a drink and Harry happily took a sip of which tasted like lemon and vodka, mixed with a heavy bitterness.
“So tell me about yourself, Harry. What are your interests?’ Ron asked, making a conversation as he eyed the long line that awaited.
“Who’s asking?” The Slytherin student mumbled, not turning around once. Harry came to his side but kept his fair distance. Draco’s gaze averted to Harry. “How dare you speak to me,” He said through gritted teeth, standing still. Harry cleared his throat, looking anywhere but at Draco’s face.
“For fuck sake at least I’m asking you how you are!” Draco took a deep breath in through gritted teeth, running his slender fingers through his shiny hair. He hated that Harry knew that he cared. He didn’t want to show him that, so he felt better to convince himself that he doesn’t care. “I won’t bother anymore.” He left.
“Look, last night you scared us.” Harry listened, crossing his legs on his bed. “Pansy invited you to play truth or dare with Draco and Blaise. Hermione and I didn’t know because- well I was having the time of my life dancing with her. But then, you fainted, or you blacked out,” Harry was still. “You fell but Malfoy caught you. It was horrifying to be honest, I just heard Blaise scream for Hermione and I so we took you to the car. Pansy had put something in your drink,” He breathed, watching Harry.
“What is with that tall, dark and handsome nonsense,” Ron muttered, wetting his lips, “I don’t know who he is.”
Later that night, all the students of Hogwarts college began to get ready and leave to set up the party. “I wonder if people are going to drink and all,” Ron mumbled to Harry as the two jogged upstairs.
“Harry, we’re going to get you back to the college. Pansy Parkinson drugged you, mate. You’re okay we’re going home,” Ron reassured him. Harry couldn’t even process what he was being told, he was completely lost.
“Lavender Brown,” The Gryffindor student replied, “She’s a bit of a chatterbox… but she’s fun,” Hermione said. “She’s helped me plenty, she’s very beautiful.”
“Of course. Everyone does at some point in their lives. It’s just a matter of whether you want to be positive or negative about it.” Silence surrounded the pair, but Draco liked the silence.
The pair stepped out of the car, staring at the large hall that stood before them. Students were outside, smoking and drinking, and loud music bounced off the walls of the building. Two security men stood in front of the entrance; arms crossed. “Harry Potter and Ron Weasley,” Harry spoke to them, waiting for their approval. They nodded in response, opening the door which revealed a gigantic hall that was beaming with flashing lights.
“I can go if you want, I’m not sure why she brought me here,” Harry said, receiving a deep chuckle from Blaise.
“Miss Parkinson, I have also reached out to your parents who are very disappointed in you, as they should be. I won’t explain what you have done because you know better than anyone what you did. You will be suspended for two whole months from this college. You will be banned from any recreational activities and any parties or gatherings for the whole year. You also owe all of your teachers plenty of added work, and that will be sent to you.” Pansy’s eyebrows were knitted, and her knee was bouncing up and down at a rapid pace. “You are very lucky that Harry was safe. You are on your last warning, if I have to hear another peep about you, you will be expelled from Hogwarts college.” Silence filled the room as the Professor eyed her. “Do you understand me?” She barked, and Pansy nodded. Professor Snape and Dumbledore didn’t say a word, but Snape was infuriated about his student’s actions. “Leave.” The two shot up, leaving the classroom. “Oh,” McGonagall stopped them, “I advise you apologise to Mr Potter, but only do it if you mean it.” Pansy glanced at Harry who left the room.
“I’m not talking to Pansy now, because I hate what she did. We’re not friends but at least I’m bloody trying here,” He rose his voice.
“Well yeah I guess,” Ron’s lips were pinched to a corner. “Nah,” He breathed, “It’s just a crush, I just find her sort of fit, you know,” He chuckled.
“I don’t have a type,” Draco looked at Pansy who didn’t look satisfied with that answer. Harry felt drowsy, and his eyes were suddenly heavy.
“I’m Luna Lovegood, my apologies. I believe we have never met, but I saw what happened. I just wanted to check on you.”
“Okay anyway, we have to line up because we have to collect our dorm number, roommate and door key,” Harry explained as the two joined the long line.
The boy was startled, and he didn’t look happy. “Watch where you walk,” He sneered, brushing his black turtleneck. He was tall and lanky, and he had platinum blonde hair that slightly fell in front of his face. His hair wasn’t much different to the colour of his skin, pale and faded.
“Would you two stop it!” Hermione shouted. We need to get Harry to a hospital as soon as possible he hasn’t even woken up yet.”
“Leave,” Draco ordered, looking at the girl whose eyes appeared glass like. “Just go.” She stepped back, turning to walk back into the hall. Hermione held Harry who began to move his head, slowly blinking.
“You speak in my classroom?” The Professor said, eyeing the two Slytherin students. Harry turned his head, along with the rest of the students as they all fixated on Draco and Pansy. “Slytherin… what a disappointment.” Draco’s eyes fell on his books. “I will assess you all a partner, you will work on the task from the page number I have given you, do not speak to anyone else but your working partner,” Professor Snape explained, holding a piece of paper.
“Eating and sleeping I guess?” Ron chuckled and so did Harry. “Did you hear about the sorting house thing?” Ron asked Harry who had a look of confusion washed on his face. “My father read that we get put into houses, kinda like high school.”
“Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas,” Harry had never heard of those students and he watched them sit beside each other, instantly getting along with the task.
“Pansy, what kind of shit is this?” Blaise asked her. Ron took a deep breath in, wetting his lips and walking away from the group.
There was a dead silence between the two, until Harry scoffed and nodded. “You’re very shallow. How sad is that.”
“Do you need something?” Hermione sneered, her arms out. Draco’s gaze shifted to her, and he shot her a rather deathly glare.
“Um,” Harry muttered, grabbing a denim jacket from his closet. “Maybe try this instead of that jacket.” Ron changed his jacket, staring at the mirror.
“Hermione, I was just getting a crack outta you,” Ron shook his head and Hermione playfully rolled her eyes.
“Holy shit… that one isn’t happy,” Ron chuckled as Harry shook his head with a grin. His first day was already interesting. The college he goes to is the size of a castle, he made a friend already and he had a not so pleasant encounter which all just made him even more excited for the days ahead.
“What did you give to Harry before you brought him to us?” Blaise asked her. The rest of the group turned to Pansy who tugged at her sleeves.
“Good lord,” Ron muttered, watching her run in five-inch heels. She threw her body against Harry’s embracing him in a hug, and then gently gave Ron a hug.
“I’m sorry about chemistry last time, I just didn’t think you’d react that way, but you were asking for it if I’m going to be honest.” Draco kept his eyes on Harry as he took a swig from the bottle he held. He reeked of expensive cologne and alcohol.
“What happened?” Pansy shrieked as Hermione and Ron rushed toward the scene. Harry faintly heard the footsteps and voices of Hermione and Ron, but it became more and more of a blur each second. The rest of the students began to watch and approach Draco who had panic painted across his face.
“Well that’s why you have a map in your hand, is it not?” Draco slightly raised his tone. Harry parted his lips to speak, “Or are you just stupid?” Harry’s eyebrows were knitted. He was open to being acquainted with the Malfoy, but he knows where he stands now.
“What’s the matter?” He asked. Harry turned to Draco who he couldn’t clearly see. His vision became a blur, and Draco’s voice echoed in his ears. He felt the weight of his body tip, and he was about to meet with the ground until Draco caught him.
“About forty minutes away,’ Ron answered, his attention falling off Harry. A girl with light hazelnut locks that ended just above her shoulders waited in the front of a line. She wore a button up shirt under a washed-out denim jacket with black jeans and converse shoes. “Take a look at that one,” Ron sighed.
“Harry,” Ron said. “Her face, that dress and those heels… she’s an angel.” Harry let out a deep chuckle, patting his back.
It was odd, because he doesn’t know how to open up to anyone, especially a girl he has never had a conversation with, but for some reason he wanted to talk to her. He wanted to stay here.
“I’m going to head to the bathrooms and have a shower,” Harry shot up, grabbing his toiletries and a new change of clothes. He left the dorm and walked through the large building, passing many students who were already eyeing him.
“I’m not asking for a thank you I’m just asking for you to believe me,” He finished, pushing the door open and leaving Harry in the bathroom. Grabbing his clothes and throwing them on, Harry thought about the meeting ahead with Pansy, first week of college and things were already crashing.
“I’m bringing liquor,” Pansy shouted across the hall to another boy, Blaise Zabini. Harry and Ron listened, but didn’t pay no attention to them. “Also, you have a pack of smokes, right?” She added, scrimmaging in her purse.
“Fuck yes,” He mumbled as a wide-eyed Hermione sat before him. Harry’s face lit up and he made his way toward the Professor. He joined Ron and Hermione who were grinning, and Ron playfully punched his arm, chuckling at the end. McGonagall continued to call out the Gryffindor students, moving onto the next houses, and lastly Slytherin.
“It’s okay, I’ll catch you guys later,” Harry answered, opening a map that all the students were given. He looked around the college, his eyes rapidly shifting from door to door as he searched for his classroom number. Draco Malfoy walked in front of him, holding his books. Harry’s eyes fixated on the silver ring wrapped around Draco’s slender finger, but he couldn’t get a proper look of what it was.
Everyone got up, meeting with their friends, walking around the college and returning to their dorms before class starts. “So, who’s your roommate?” Ron asked Hermione as the three walked.
“What are you wearing? I want to at least look decent for Hermione,” The red head blurted to Harry and closed the door behind the two.
“Hermione Granger is a very pretty name… very nice,” Ron nodded, smiling with a clenched jaw. Hermione wore a look of confusion, following with a low chuckle.
“The fuck, Pansy?” Draco breathed, his brows furrowing as he looked at his friend who had no words to say to him. Harry remained seated at his desk and he could see Draco joining him in the corner of his eye.
Arriving at the college that was about an hour and a bit away from his home, Harry found a spot and parked his car. He turned his key, analysing the very large building before his eyes. “Hogwarts College” it read in bold letters. The building was beautiful, and it had a vintage look to it. Harry breathed in, opening the door and grabbing his suitcase and extra bags. The parking lot was filled with cars and there were students walking around, chatting and standing near the building. He walked in the building, receiving a few glances from students. The ceilings were far too tall, and the rooms were gigantic which made Harry even more excited to see the dormitories.
“I don’t know what you want from me, but I was not involved in Pansy’s stupid idea. I was just enjoying myself with Blaise on the side of the party, and then she brought you to us.”
“Luna Lovegood,” She hummed, analysing the drained eyes of the young man. “You don’t look so well. Can I help you with something?” Draco felt a tad bit awkward, but he suddenly felt calm. The panic that overcame his body suddenly left, and he realised he still didn’t give her an answer.
“Well, that can be remedied if you wish,” Harry laughs. Draco nods and Harry sets about popping the button and lowering the zipper before pushing Draco’s trousers over his tight arse and to the floor. Draco steps out of the puddle of fabric and Harry unashamedly takes all of Draco in.
“I’ll write to her some time this week then. I’ll let her know we are very much in love and happy and thrilled to be expecting our sixth child.” Draco’s hands find their way to Harry’s belly, caressing the place where their son lies. “I’ll also tell her that her opinions are not needed or wanted, and that she can kindly keep them to herself in the future. We can ward against her letters if she doesn’t get the message.”
“Matthew and I aren’t having sex. Yet.” James’s cheeks flush red. “But we’ve done some other things. And I’ve been pretty sure for a while that I’ll want to bottom, but now I’m scared I’ll end up like Dad.”
By the time they’ve enjoyed lunch, the outside of the restaurant is swarming with gawkers, reporters, and photographers. Draco wraps his arm around Harry’s waist as they pause just inside the door.
“Good. Yeah, that’ll be good.” Harry stutters, still desperately trying to process what just happened.
“You’ve not screwed up anything, Harry.” Draco exhales. He runs his fingers along the arm that Harry’s thrown over him. “I just want to know what’s on your mind.”
Harry closes his eyes and takes in a deep breath of crisp autumn air, holding it for several seconds before letting it out. Opening his eyes, he finally turns towards Draco.
“Well, you’re happy now, and I plan to make sure you stay that way. You can’t go back and fix the past, but we can make sure things are better moving forward.”
Harry’s face softens just a bit. He does know, Harry supposes. And it would give him somewhere to go besides home to an empty house. Harry gives a brief nod, “I…yeah…yeah. Okay. Lead the way.”
“Your canal is forming well thus far. We will regularly perform checks during your prenatal treatment to make sure it continues, but usually, if there is an issue, it would be complete agenesis, which you do not have.”
“I loved Ginny. Probably part of me always will. When she died, I didn’t think I’d ever want to be with someone else. It was me and the kids against the world, and I was ok with that. I didn’t date at all; I wasn’t looking to date.” Harry huffs another laugh. “That remained true up until about halfway through tea that day.”
He is exhausted and sore. His belly, swollen and squashy, no longer holds their son. He delivered the afterbirth and the Healing team spent a good amount of time with spells and salves to put his ravaged body back together, but it is still far from how it once was. Draco had helped him into the shower, where he wept, partially out of relief, partially out of pain, and partially out of just being overwhelmed.
“You both know basic protection charms, right?” Draco knows they do; Harry told him, but he figures Draco is using it as a good entry point for contraception.
The sound of the door being pushed open yanks Harry out of his cogitation and he swiftly stands upright, putting one hand on the wine bottle he’s supposed to be retrieving as Draco pokes his head in.
They’re stretched out on the patio, enjoying the sunshine while all five children zip around the Quidditch pitch on their brooms. Having been on bedrest for six weeks, Harry is more than a bit restless and has taken to spending as much time as possible outdoors. However, something more than being shut indoors has been on his mind on an increasing basis, and he can no longer keep it to himself.
“I’m at a good stopping point.” Draco stands and offers Harry a hand. “Why don’t we go downstairs, and you can get comfortable in the bedroom while I’ll make a quick cup of tea for us before she comes?”
Panic is beginning to set in. He tries to take inventory of his body. Nothing really hurts. There’s something cold and hard on his abdomen. Something is keeping his left hand warm. He feels…floaty. He can feel everything outside his body but not his body itself.
“We are,” Draco chuckles, pushing himself to stand and offering Harry his hand. Harry reaches up and takes the proffered hand and is pulled to his feet. He’s immediately engulfed in a tight hug and for several long moments, they just stand there, pressed together, basking in the knowledge that their forever officially begins tonight.
“We can still have plenty of sex. We can always come home for a quickie at lunch if you can’t make it all day.” Harry winks at Draco and laughs at the man’s intrigued expression. “I’m anxious to get back to our new project, but I’ll miss being with you all day.”
“That was five hours ago. You can have more.” Draco’s hands still against his back. “What about a warm bath? You can take a dose and we can get in the tub and see if the water helps.”
but routine. The sex is frequent and passionate, and Harry is enjoying the fact that they’re completely comfortable trying new things and finding out what works for them. But beyond that, Harry finds himself falling further in love with Draco every day. It’s not that they don’t disagree — they do, and it can be heated — but they care more about each other than about being right. Harry loves figuring out how to best take care of Draco’s physical and emotional needs and in turn, Draco takes fantastic care of him.
“Well, it’s not as if Draco hasn’t seen you in your everyday clothes.” Hermione gestures to one pile on the bed, and then to another. “And he helped you pick out your work clothes. He knows what you look like and he asked you for a date with that knowledge.”
Harry’s stomach flutters a bit and he bites his bottom lip. He hasn’t realised how much he wanted to see Draco again until now, with the opportunity laid out before him. Would it be too forward to ask Draco to join him for the dinner he’s already started? Before he can talk himself out of it, Harry strides to the study to reply.
“I did. We can go tomorrow. She can meet with us at three, then we can take all five kids for dinner after class. She asks that we return them by curfew.”
in the span of one summer?” He throws up his hands. “Plus, everything else you’ve read, which you’re clearly retaining, based on your ability to converse with Healer Carr today about
“Okay. Will you call James just as soon as you’re done? No matter how it goes?” Harry wants to make sure that Matthew’s safety is accounted for, regardless of the outcome.
He watches them clamour down the stairs before turning back to Minerva. The look on her face is difficult to interpret. Something akin to pride, perhaps.
Harry’s heart is suddenly full to bursting and he's grinning so hard his face is splitting in two and the poor pillow is being gently pounded with excitement. “I’d like that. Quite a lot, actually.”
Harry lifts his knee and Healer Carr’s charm washes over him and fingers slide in. He feels the hard spot in his abdomen shift with the internal pressure and press towards his hand.
“Yes.” Harry is grateful to have Draco’s presence at this moment and smiles back at him. “I have just never been very graceful using the Floo.”
“He did, Lil. But Matthew decided it was time to tell his parents that he’s gay, and it did not go well.”
“Regulus Etamin Potter.” Draco rolls the name over his tongue, words thick with emotion. “You certainly are our brightest star.”
Harry clears his throat and Draco looks up. Warmth spreads in Harry’s chest at the grin forming on Draco’s face. Draco immediately stands and looks at Harry earnestly.
Draco slips out the door as James and Matthew both slide off the bed and move to hug Harry. James gives Harry’s swollen belly a quick pat and smiles.
He pulls two books of constellations towards him and flips open the large one to a diagram of the constellations of the night sky, spreading it across both their laps.
“You’ve certainly kept that quiet,” Malfoy intones carefully. There's a carefully controlled edge of something in Malfoy's voice. Not anger, exactly.
Harry chuckles at the disdain clearly written on Draco’s sharp features. Somehow, even with his nose wrinkled, he’s gorgeous.
Harry breathes deeply and takes a moment to organise his thoughts. He wants to make sure he communicates everything clearly, and that seems more difficult given his proximity to Draco. “I’ve never done casual well. I’m sure it won’t surprise you to know that I rarely do things halfway.”
“You’re doing so well, Harry. I’m so proud of you. I love you so much.” Draco’s steady stream of comfort and reassurance grounds him and gives him strength.
Lily’s squeal could shatter glass as she launches herself across the room to Harry. He pulls her in, hugging her against himself and James. He looks over James to see Matthew looking at them intently with a look Harry can’t quite interpret. Draco’s arms full of Scorpius and Al and sheer joy radiating off his face matches Harry’s own.
“Al, why don’t you come with us? Your dad can Side-Along James and Lily and I can take you and Scorp.” Draco smiles.
Harry laughs softly and goes back to toying with the edge of the soft pillow. “I’m absolute shite at the flirting-and-showing-initial-interest part of a relationship, Draco. If I was better at it, perhaps you’d have seen that I definitely return the affection, and I’m open to…being pursued romantically.”
Harry requires Draco’s help to lift his leg for Healer Powell to check his dilation, and he mentally scolds himself for feeling weak. He’s birthing a human, for Merlin’s sake.
“I’ll see if they’ll let me brew at home while you’re pregnant. I can ward a lab in the cellar or in one of the guest rooms. Then I’ll only have to go in for meetings.”
“I know.” Harry turns his mouth against Draco’s ear. “I can’t believe your son is growing inside me.”
“Fuck!” Draco shouts and Harry pulls back, startled and wondering what could be wrong. Draco hisses at the loss of contact. “Salazar, don’t stop!”
As soon as they hear the Floo, Draco is stripping and sliding into bed next to Harry. Draco’s body winds around his and Harry settles his back against the blond’s chest. A hand snakes around to lie protectively over their son, and they both drift off to sleep.
“Then how would it be your fault?” Harry is not following James’ train of thought. He watches his son’s face form into something resembling determination.
“What about Astoria’s parents?” Harry inquires, curiosity getting the better of him before his brain registers that it might not be appropriate to ask. To his knowledge, the elder Greengrasses are still alive.
Harry turns from James’ room and heads down the stairs. As he nears the bottom, he hears Al’s voice and pauses.
“And now?” They move to have a seat in the living room, Hermione taking up her favourite spot in the overstuffed easy chair while Harry tucks himself under Draco’s arm on the couch.
“Scorp and I were both glad you and Draco started dating, we told you that!” Al pauses and Harry’s not sure how to interpret the look on his son’s face. “And the baby took a while to sink in, but we’re both happy for a little brother. Scorp has always wanted a sibling, and now he’ll have four!”
Harry rolls his eyes. He hates that he has to hide their happiness and their relationship because a bunch of nosy reporters can’t mind their own business. He knows that when they do come out publicly, it’s going to be front-page news.
“No, I’m not. I’m right here.” Draco heads for his usual chair beside Harry, pausing to help Harry undress beneath the blankets.
Draco seems just a little disappointed. “I know that will come later, but I wish I could feel it now.”
“It will become less of an issue when you turn seventeen, but you’re welcome here until you finish Hogwarts and beyond.” Draco gives Matthew an encouraging smile. “We’ll cross all those bridges as we come to them.”
Suddenly, Harry is empty, but before he’s given time to complain there’s the delicious stretch of two fingers breaching his entrance. Draco strokes his prostate again as he eases both fingers in and gently stretches Harry open.
“Healer Carr says everything is right on track. I’m due on 22 August.” Harry feels the warmth of Draco’s hand moving to lay on his abdomen.
“I suppose I can see that,” Draco says before laughing softly. “Has this conversation done to you what it’s done to me? Thinking about doing all those things to you?”
“Maybe?” Draco runs his hands down the page to Leo, studying the stars within. “What about Regulus? ‘The star that stands at the lion’s breast.’ The heart of the lion, brightest star in Leo.”
They all pop into the living room of Potter Cottage and Harry is suddenly exponentially more nervous. Deep breath and forced smile, he faces the kids. James is looking at him knowingly and Harry wonders if he’s already figured out what’s coming.
“I shall have to retire before then,” she quips, before breaking into a rare grin. “Congratulations, gentlemen. That is wonderful news. Am I correct in assuming that’s why the children were required at home?”
Draco bursts out laughing. Harry is torn between being upset and offended. He wasn’t expecting Draco to
“It’s not like they don’t know we kiss, Draco. Not to mention I’m pregnant, and they all know how that happens, too.”
“I think we should bring all four kids back here,” Draco says slowly. “Scorpius is already familiar with you and the house, and this is where we’re planning to spend the break.”
“What?! No!” Draco seems almost offended by the suggestion. His voice is filled with shock when he continues. “Harry. You’re pregnant.”
“No. Your dad didn’t even know he was a carrier. We were just as surprised as you.” Draco’s voice is gentle but resolute. “But we’re very happy about it.”
“We’d talked about you and I both having tellies and mobiles over dinner,” Harry explains, smiling at Hermione’s expression. “He asked me if I thought you’d be willing to ward a telly for him. I told him I’d ask.”
Instead of reaching out for the spoon, Draco stands from his stool and steps towards Harry. He puts his hand on the spoon, partially over Harry’s hand, and guides it to his own mouth. Harry’s eyes widen slightly and his other hand automatically comes up below Draco’s chin to catch any drips.
Harry squeezes Draco’s hand before looking back to Hermione. “I want to birth our son as Draco’s husband.”
“Press down lightly, Mr Malfoy. My fingers will apply pressure from underneath and you should be able to feel a hard, round mass about the size of your palm. That’s the womb.”
Before he can reach for the reset button again, he feels hands on his waist. Harry jumps and turns around. Draco’s beautiful silver eyes are gazing at his face with concern.
“I know, Al.” Draco’s voice answers. “It’s not what I had in mind either. But I love your dad.” Another pause. “Are you ok with this?”
“You really want to get married? Before our son is born?” Draco sounds less incredulous now and more…anticipatory, perhaps?
! At my pants!” Draco is struggling to maintain any kind of serious expression, his face contorting into various mixes of bemused, aghast, angry, and laughing. He finally cracks and snorts — SNORTS! — and sags against Harry, laughing hysterically.
This was what Harry had been afraid of. He clenches his fists loosely and continues, needing confirmation of his suspicions. “Would being possessed by a dark wizard regularly over the course of several months potentially cause damage?”
“Yeah.” Harry looks around, taking in the empty platform. How long had he been standing there, gazing at the spot where Lily had been waving before the train pulled away? “Are we the only ones left?”
If Harry thought he was tired Friday, he was completely mistaken. By lunch on Sunday, Friday looks positively energetic. He chalks it up to a very emotionally taxing weekend and, unfortunately, it’s not over yet. He looks at Albus who is settled at the end of Harry and Draco’s bed while Harry leans against the headboard. Talking to Al about his anxiety almost always ends up with an emotional outburst.
“I’m not encouraging you to have sex. I’d prefer you wait. There’s a lot of responsibility that comes with the consequences of sex. But I wasn’t much older than you when I started having sex, so I’m not going to pretend it’s not happening. I
“I love you. I never expected to have a chance to fall in love and be happy, and I most certainly didn’t expect that chance to come with you. But now, I can’t imagine my life any other way.”
“But if either of you has questions about sex, or anything else, really, you can always come to us together or alone, ok?” Harry looks to both boys, who nod. “Good. Is there anything else you need tonight?”
Harry stares out over London and just enjoys how right it feels to be with Draco. Never in a million years did he expect to have a romantic relationship again. He certainly didn’t think it would be with a man. And he would have bet all his gold in Gringotts against it being Draco.
“Speaking of your kids, apparently Albus has been quite concerned and has gotten upset a few times worrying about you. Scorpius said he cried the first night back, thinking about you here by yourself.”
Harry pillows his head on his arms, face to the mirror, and watches. Watches Draco’s finger disappear into his body. Watches one finger become two. Watches them scissor and stretch and press deeper. Watches Draco’s neglected cock twitch and leak.
“Yes. That’s one of the unseen places we’ve only learned to scan and detect damage in recently. Really only in the last 4-5 years.” Draco is clearly forcing his voice to remain steady but Harry still can’t look at him.
“I’m roasting,” he whinges, peeling off Draco’s hoodie, dropping it to the floor and settling back against his fiancé. A pale hand automatically wraps around him to cover his bump.
“Is there one that you’d like, love?” Harry steers Draco’s attention back to the large selection of men’s engagement rings. He knows only one of them will propose and he’s sure it will probably be Draco, but he wants both of them to wear that sign of their commitment. As much as he likes the idea of wearing a ring from Draco, he’s equally anxious for Draco to wear a ring from him, as well.
“Great. Draco just got home from work.” Harry gestures behind him to where Draco has disappeared up the stairs. ”We were wondering if you wanted to come through for dinner. I just put chicken and potatoes in the oven.”
Harry’s heart swells. He really wants Draco to be just as happy as he is and so far, it seems that he is. Harry’s always had a hard time accepting good things when they happen to him because they’re so often ripped away, but he’s trying — hoping — to see that Draco can be his
“That’s fascinating! It sounds like you’re making great progress.” Draco sounds proud of him and for whatever reason, that makes Harry’s heart swell. “Will that case make its way to Potions for anything?”
“What?” Harry asks, feeling like he should be defensive but with no idea why. They step into the elevator and Draco leans past Harry to press the button for the ground floor. Harry resists the urge to close his eyes as he inhales the delicious scent that is Draco.
“I’ll go grab the wine and pour us another glass while you decide.” Harry slips off the couch and retreats to the kitchen. The door swings shut and Harry braces both hands on the counter, closing his eyes.
“No fever.” Draco casts a gentle cleaning spell on Harry’s mouth, ridding him of that awful taste that lingers after throwing up.
“I am, as well, but your pacing isn’t going to do anything to help.” Draco sets his cup down and moves in front of Harry. Steadying hands grasp his hips and Draco’s soft lips cover his. After several minutes of languid snogging, Harry is less nervous but more aroused.
“I’d never let you hear the end of it if I found out from the Prophet!” Hermione pauses and narrows her eyes, looking at Harry more closely. “Are you not feeling well?”
“Ok. Everyone’s here. Answer my questions.” Albus’ voice is insistent and desperate. ”If you’re not dying, what’s going on? Are you still ill?”
“It’s Hermione. She will, hands down, notice the rings within sixty seconds of stepping through the Floo.” Harry laughs. “She’ll also nail down that I don’t feel well and will be pestering me about what’s wrong and if I’ve seen a Healer. I’m willing to bet she knows we’re engaged and I’m pregnant within five minutes of her arrival.”
“I would be absolutely honoured to have you as a Potter, Scorpius.” Harry’s voice is far more hoarse than he anticipated. He smiles impishly at Draco. “I suppose I’ll have you, as well.”
“It is. I made a larger batch of both, but James doesn’t need a huge supply at school, so I bottled these for him to take. Do you have the box ready?”
“We also talked about the kids and about how I’m trying to figure out what to do with myself, now that Lily has gone to Hogwarts.” Harry frowns slightly, thinking about his empty house. “He encouraged me to find something that gives me purpose and he didn’t push me towards what people would expect. I appreciated that.”
The tender motion becomes firmer before Draco’s finger finally slips inside. Harry gasps and immediately presses back, eager for that delicious feeling to continue. Fuck, his cock is already leaking and Draco only has one fingertip in. Merlin, it’s so much better when it’s — nggh… — Draco’s finger inside him instead of his own.
“We can tell them at the Christmas holiday?” Harry lifts it into a question, just in case Draco has other plans. “They’ll be home the second week of December.”
“Yes. The baby appears to be just fine.” Harry hears Draco release the same sigh of relief that he does. “You, on the other hand…Your partner tells me your nausea has been quite severe.”
“I wouldn’t mind in the least.” Harry follows Draco to the front door of the Malfoys’ penthouse. Draco opens the door and ushers Harry though, placing his hand on the small of Harry’s back for a fleeting moment. Heat skitters up Harry’s spine at the touch.
Swinging the door open, his first glimpse of Draco nearly makes him gasp. He’s dressed in black trousers and a deep plum dress shirt under his stylish jacket, and he looks absolutely gorgeous. Harry shamelessly looks Draco over before smiling up at him. Draco’s returning smile makes him melt, just a little.
He shoves away from the window and returns to the counter, glad that he spent the first two days without the kids deep cleaning the house. He even wrote Hermione to ask if he could borrow her copy of
“Oh, that helps.” Harry closes his eyes and tries to rein in his emotions. This pregnancy will be worth it in the end, but he’s just so fed up with being perpetually helpless and uncomfortable. And tired. So tired. “I’m just so ready to not be pregnant. This is miserable.”
They move to stand and, even as his mind is racing with what he’s just learned, Harry realises he misses the touch of Draco’s hand as soon as it’s withdrawn. He also realises just how comforting he’s finding Draco’s presence in this suddenly mental upheaval.
“I know what it’s like, Potter. I know what it’s like to put your child on the train and watch them pull away and have no one waiting for you at home. Let’s go have a cup of tea. It will get you off the platform, at least.”
“It’s ok. You were working.” Draco doesn’t sound at all irritated and Harry is hopeful that Draco isn’t upset. “Does something sound good for dinner?”
“…yes,” Harry breathes and the dam breaks and the words just tumble out. “I understand if you don’t feel the same way. It’s been a long time since I had to deal with this kind of situation and sometimes I think you might reciprocate those feelings, but I can never quite tell and I was afraid I might be misinterpreting and—“
“Tell her ‘thank you’ for me, please. I’ll go arrange for it to be delivered.” Draco steps away towards the electronics counter to purchase his telly. Harry’s gaze lingers on Draco’s retreating form for several seconds, then his fingers move furiously over his phone the instant Draco steps away.
Harry’s head suddenly spins as the connection opens and he closes his eyes as he waits for everything to settle. Opening his eyes, he’s met with Draco’s smiling face. And —
“I do. I’m actually quite nervous.” Harry takes a moment to look Draco over. He looks fantastic, even if he’s not as formally dressed as Harry. “I appreciate it even more since it’s you.”
Draco closes his book and places it on his nightstand with his glasses, and Harry settles against him. Harry feels Draco press a kiss to the top of his head.
“Merlin, I was such a little arsehole.” Malfoy shakes his downturned head with a derisive smile before lifting his chin to look Harry square in the eye. “But I really wanted to raise Scorpius to be the complete opposite of that. It’s part of why I went to such lengths to have an heir. I could change the meaning behind the name Malfoy. I could…I could be on the right side of something for once. I could teach my son to be everything I was not. I could teach him to be a good man.”
Within five minutes, a Magiscope is being wheeled into the room. And sixty seconds later, Harry’s eyes are pressed against it and he’s viewing his own core.
Draco’s eyes are bright, and Harry feels his own eyes well up. Draco drops one of Harry’s hands and cups his cheek tenderly. He is nearly overwhelmed by the emotion in those beautiful grey eyes.
“You absolute cheat!” Draco’s laughing voice booms. Harry hears the slap of Draco’s feet as he hurtles after him.
“That’s quite brilliant, actually.” Harry is impressed with how skillfully the magical community can be camouflaged that close to the Muggle community.
Harry finally lifts his chin to look at Hermione, who has her eyebrows raised with a very amused smirk on her face.
Harry spots James over the top of Lily’s head, hand in hand with Matthew, dragging his trunk behind him. He raises a hand to catch James’ eye and is pleased to see his son grin when he’s spotted.
“I’m glad you both have each other. There’s been a lot of changes in both of your lives the last several months.”
Harry shifts his position and keeps an eye on Draco’s face as he licks a long stripe up the underside of Draco’s cock. Draco hisses and moans, hips lifting slightly, and Harry uses one hand to gently hold Draco’s hips down. It’s been awhile since he’s had a cock in his mouth. Draco is long and thick and he doesn’t want to gag.
Draco helps Harry into the bed and takes his hand as Healer Powell begins checking him over. Continuous monitoring charms are put into place, and Harry hears the swoosh of Regulus’ heartbeat fill the room.
“Right this way Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter,” she says, leading them through a door and to a large pod with floor-to-ceiling windows all the way around.
“Harry!” Draco’s voice drifts up the stairs. The man in question makes his way, slowly, to the top of the stairs.
“Caffeine is always welcome.” Harry chuckles. “I do seem to require less of it now that the kids are off at school.”
Twenty-four hours ago, he had no idea he wanted a baby with Draco. And now…Harry lifts his hand to rest low on his muscled abdomen. The mix of emotions, and the speed at which he has travelled through them, begins leaking from his eyes. He lies there, hand splayed over their baby, and lets the tears flow.
“It’s been a long time for me, too.” Harry is flooded with relief at the fact that Draco isn’t upset at the proposition. A thrill runs through his groin, hoping that before the weekend is out, maybe even tonight, Draco will be buried inside him.
The wards shift and there are suddenly Hippogriffs tap dancing in his chest. A knock echoes through the house, and Harry strides to the door. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, trying to hang on to his excitement but banish his nerves.
missed her and doesn’t want her to feel replaced. Harry hears Draco descending the stairs behind him. He glances over his shoulder as Draco approaches.
“Perfect. James, you know all of this and you know it very well. You should be proud of yourself.” Harry’s certainly proud of his son and how hard he’s worked this summer. Both Draco and Hermione had taken to tutoring him and neither had gone easy on him.
“A benefit, I’m afraid.” Draco pops open the wax seal on the thick parchment scroll and unfurls it between them.
Draco looks almost sheepish as he shrugs nonchalantly. “I offered to meet you and escort you to the office. I thought you might appreciate a familiar face.”
Harry both hears and feels Draco’s breath hitch. His stomach drops and he’s certain he’s pushed too far too fast.
Draco kisses Harry softly. “Six weeks today. I still can’t believe I’m lucky enough to have a baby with you.”
“Merlin, this is going to get hectic.” Harry shakes his head. “Matthew can give his parents the break to calm down and maybe write them when he’s back at school. If they will allow him to come home, he can decide if he wants to do that. If they refuse to let him back in the house or he doesn’t want to go back, we probably need to figure out some kind of guardianship for the summer. Just in case there’s an emergency or he needs medical attention.”
By the time they are finished with lunch and ready to head home, they’ve chosen a beautiful, modern ebony four-poster bed with matching dressers, nightstands, and wardrobes. The mirror Draco mentioned has been added on, as well as a dressing bench they both loved. Together with the rest — bedding, paint charm, rugs and decor — Harry can actually close his eyes and picture
Harry eyes Malfoy speculatively, trying to decide how much to let out. “This is not public. I worked to keep it quiet and I would like it to stay that way.”
He lowers the phone and presses the speaker button. The sound of sobbing fills the kitchen and Harry wraps an arm around his son, who has joined his boyfriend in crying.
“That sounds good. James, do you want to help me with some snacks and Al and Scorp can get the telly set up? Matthew can save you a seat.”
Harry apparates to the lane leading to Potter Cottage and strolls towards the house. It was late afternoon, nearly evening, before he and Malfoy —
Harry is certain his heart will burst from the affection he feels for Draco in this moment. He’s sure he’s never loved anyone the way he loves Draco, even Ginny.
“And so you shall.” Hermione looks at Harry fondly. “We should make a list of what needs to be done. I can even take the rest of the week off work if you’d like. I have almost five months of vacation time backlogged. They can allow me a few days.”
“I think you’re right. He’s written to me four times in the three days I’ve been home.” Harry knows his son worries, but Al’s been particularly anxious over Harry recently. All the kids know right now is that Harry has been ill and admitted to St Mungo’s for a week. He can’t decide if it will be better or worse once Al knows he’s pregnant. “Next weekend, then?”
He lays there, eyes still closed, catching his breath for a moment. Draco’s smile is still in the forefront of his mind.
of you go anywhere by yourself. No one goes in any pair or group unless at least one of you has a mobile. Check in with us when you go into and out of a store. Just a quick text so we know where to find you in an emergency. Ignore the press if they show up. If they get closer than two meters, call Draco or me immediately.”
“We have found that Dark Magic, especially Dark Magic cast on witches before they hit puberty, can cause unseen damage that can manifest later in life.” Draco’s voice takes on something reminiscent of Hermione’s lecture tones, but alarm bells are ringing in Harry’s head. “We are trying to learn to seek and find that damage so it can be repaired and prevent those issues.”
“What’s the matter, Harry?” Draco’s voice sounds equally uncertain on the other end and maybe a little hurt. “If I’ve done something to upset you, I truly am sorry.”
“He’s right there, Harry. I can feel his head.” Healer Powell withdraws his hand and eases Harry’s legs back to the bed. “When your body tells you to push, I want you to push. As soon as that happens, press the call button so we can come set up for delivery. He’s almost here, gentlemen.”
“I think the baby knows you,” Harry grins. “It just happened again. It won’t be long before you can feel it, too.”
“I sure hope so. I sort of figured we can just tell them that we are in a relationship and let them ask any questions they have.” Harry really hopes Draco is prepared for the barrage of questions he is sure his children will fire at them — being able to ask just about anything and get honest answers. “If the living together doesn’t come up during that, we can bring it up once they’re done.”
