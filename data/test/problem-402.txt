Nigel consulted his phone and told Harry, who did not feel any better after hearing it.
“Hiya Harry,” she greeted him, and he was pleased to note that the circles under her eyes seemed to be less dark, although she still appeared pale and wan to him. The workload this year had not been kind to her. “I hope I’m not interrupting anything.”
“Doesn’t matter. I think you should try it.” Harry extended a hand to pull him up to standing, and Draco took it reluctantly. He felt foolish with his shirt unbuttoned to his navel and his trousers off.
Draco didn’t realize he was holding his breath until Harry approached him to give him a hug. He felt removed from the situation, as if he’d forgotten how to be a living human being, but he accepted Harry’s hug anyway because he didn’t want to hurt Harry’s feelings.
Draco thought to himself frantically as he pulled on his trousers.
Harry blushed to the roots of his hair, which was growing damp with sweat in the semi-tropical environment of Draco’s home. “D’you think it matters if I take the Z or not? 'Cause I’m going to need something to get me through this without feeling like a complete arsehole.”
Harry caught on, and found the words for the moment, blinking his foolishness away. “I think I can tell the
“Like now?” Draco’s fingers tightened around Harry’s, and he leaned in to breathe deeply from the place on Harry’s neck nestled between ear and jawbone, brushing his long eyelashes across Harry’s skin in the process. Far from feeling ticklish, Harry felt the now-familiar ache blooming below his ribcage, that he had learned to associate with Draco and his damnable magnetism.
“Mrs. Weasley,” they uttered at the same time. “She’s a godsend, honestly,” Hermione continued, topping off Draco’s wine glass for him. “When Ron and I first started living together, she walked us through a whole list of charms that she uses to keep the Burrow up and running. With Muggle dentists for parents, I needed all the help I could get.”
“Well, I’m hardly complaining. That one move you did, with the side hip thing, made your arse look amazing.”
Sorry for the mild cliff-hanger, I'm working on getting the next chapter up soon!
Harry couldn’t be sure, but he thought he heard sincerity in Draco’s voice, and he was heartened by it. “Ah, it was nothing. We can do it again sometime if you like.”
Speaking of thirst… Draco tapped the tea caddy at his elbow, which opened up and displayed a colorful array of flavors and herbs. “Astragalus and peppermint,” he uttered, and a teabag appeared in his mug. Potter took the hint and voiced his own preference – “chamomile” – before they subsided into awkward silence and sipping.
“Anything worth sharing?” Harry’s voice was slightly hoarse, and he began stroking Draco’s hair like he would a favorite pet.
Draco turned his head away, but didn’t make any attempt to withdraw from Harry’s touch. Harry lightly traced the scar of the Dark Mark for a moment, then leaned in to kiss Draco on the forehead. “Think about it. You don’t have to decide right away, but I imagine we’ll want to get things rolling by midday tomorrow.”
Harry had finally registered the fact that he was still unclothed, and started to get dressed in a fit of pique. Draco could feel the unaccustomed upswell of affection traveling from his heart to his throat, and fought not to show it.
Draco finished draining his glass, then turned a languid eye on Harry. “Believe me, I don’t mind it a little rough. I am a little surprised though, I thought you’d be a tame little cub in bed.” He adjusted his pillow and shifted closer to Harry. “Instead, I got a full-grown lion.”
The interview with the Daily Prophet was well underway, and Draco was sweating, to his dismay. Harry looked remarkably cool and composed, and Draco envied him the illusion of relative ease he had learned to adopt after years of living in the public eye. The interviewer, a chubby Wizard named Hodges, kept bringing up questions relating to Harry, but he would not be deterred from circling the conversation back to Draco. Hodges finally gave up on Harry and turned his bespectacled gaze upon Draco with the merest hint of disdain.
She chewed on her lip for a moment before telling him. “Well, it’s Ginny. She and Ron are having a bit of a row about her new relationship, something about keeping him out of the loop for too long. I guess she doesn’t take kindly to criticism these days.”
“Well, I guess I’m officially gay now,” he teased, his throat still raw.
“You have no idea.”
“Hmmm.” The sounds of writing paused. “What about you, are you afraid of anything in regards to your parents?”
A light of sympathy appeared in her eyes, and she leaned forward close enough to kiss his cheek. “Harry, you probably already know this, but – it’s okay to make mistakes. You’re going to affect people’s lives, no matter what, and all you can do is your best to make things right afterward.” She rested her head against his, and he took comfort in it. “It’s also okay to change your mind about who you are. And it’s okay to love someone you once felt hatred towards.” She sat back and took a deep breath of her own. “Not that you seem particularly hateful, but in case you do feel it sometimes.”
The good-luck owl thing in Dijon is real, spoken from personal experience. As always, there’s a website to explain it in depth:
When he reached the side of the wardrobe that contained Draco’s dress robes, he paused. It seemed so long ago that he had last seen Draco dressed as a Wizard, sitting with his chin set at a defiant angle during his trial before the Wizengamot. The young man he knew now little resembled the boy he had known then, yet he felt a tenderness for them both that was unexpected in its intensity.
By silent, mutual agreement, they started undressing each other on the spot in the living room. Harry’s need for Draco’s touch was spectacular, and Draco’s need seemed no less, although he showed more restraint because of the injury. Harry’s fingers fluttered in anticipation as Draco finished removing his shirt and started undoing his trousers for him. He was wearing nothing underneath, and Draco felt the familiar uncoiling of arousal as he knelt before his lover and took him into his willing, hungry mouth.
Harry tried to focus his attention on the pressure between their fingers, but Draco’s words stung too much to ignore for long. Was he really telling him that ultimately, his mother meant more to him than Harry did? Or was he saying that he wanted to show off his relationship with Harry so that no one could touch him, his mother included? Neither prospect sat well with Harry, and he felt ready to boil over with the sheer injustice of it. He set down his mug with a bang.
“Wait.” Brandon had gone after him. “Let me give you my number, in case you get lost or need anything.” He was scribbling in a tiny notebook that he’d produced from a pocket somewhere. “Wouldn’t want to have your fate weighing on my conscience tonight.” He tucked the piece of paper into Harry’s coat pocket and gave him a small smile. “It was very nice to meet you too, Harry.”
. A mutual acquaintance, indeed. Harry felt the automatic tension in his gut and took a few beats before responding.  “Yes? Well.” He didn’t know what to say. “What did you want to discuss? Anything I need to know?”
“Yeah, why not?”
Draco’s eyes were wandering and unfocused, but he gave Harry hope by squeezing his hand back. “Don’t do anything stupid, Potter,” he muttered. “We’ve already broken the bloody bank.”
“With a pair of glasses and a necktie on? I’m all for it.”
Draco reached out for the sausages and started to put together a plate of his own. “Harry, how do you get on? Haven’t you seen enough these past few days to know that looking good takes a lot of work?”
Harry wished he could sink into the floor and wipe all trace of this moment from the memory of everyone involved. He probably could make it happen with a little wandwork, but he didn’t want to scare the Muggles.
It was much as he remembered from the night before, but with the notable difference of daylight and pastries. Harry was taken aback by the spread of food that Malfoy had produced, and didn’t know where to put himself. Malfoy, bringing milk and sugar to the table, noticed Harry’s discomfort and asked him to sit. “I didn’t know what you liked, so I got a bit of everything,” he said.
The look of need etched across his face, and his outstretched hand, was like a hook in Harry’s heart. Before he could properly sort through his feelings, he dove toward Draco and kissed him firmly, dropping the coat on the ground as he cupped his face in both hands. Draco kissed him right back, gripping Harry’s shoulders as if he would never let go.
Once they'd settled in a bit at Draco's, it turned out that Feruza was an avid card player, and they broke the ice a little with some drinks and a few rounds of strip Exploding Snap, followed by strip poker. Ginny was very taken with the Felici-Fizz, and Draco had to cut her off after two mixed drinks, as she kept overplaying her hand. Feruza drank nothing but vodka on the rocks, and rarely cracked a smile, except when Ginny did something especially cute or outrageous.
Instead of leaving it alone, as a genteel, well-brought up person should, Harry persisted on the topic. He had all sorts of theories about how Draco’s mother would be more happy to learn how her son was faring than put out by the news that he was dating his former arch-nemesis.
Harry did not know, but he murmured thanks and paid with his Muggle credit card, which had been magically linked to his account at Gringott’s during the transition to Muggle living. Several hours later, he had come up with a new plan. Instead of trying to catch Malfoy at work, he would try asking his friends at the Ministry of Magic if they could find out where he lived. It had been a few months since he’d reached out to Mr. Weasley or the others, but he figured it couldn’t hurt to ask, in the interest of unity.
Harry rubbed one hand over his forehead. “I wouldn’t assume that, Draco. After all, your intentions were good, and you may have a chance of being acquitted, after having enrolled in this Muggle immersion program.” He paused, frowning. “Have you finished out the year yet?”
, he thought, stomach plummeting.
Thankfully, Harry was fast asleep when Draco eventually made his way to bed, and appeared to sleep through the night. Draco, on the other hand, did not nod off so well as he would have liked. Worrisome images and scenarios kept floating unbidden into his mind, and every time he dozed he could feel the edges of a nightmare threatening to engulf him. After the third time of jerking awake, he finally gave in and took a sleeping potion.
Hermione didn’t bother looking back at him, as she pulled out her wand and climbed to her feet. Harry filled in the blanks for Draco while she walked off to the kitchen to spell Ginny. “Pain relief charms aren’t intended for general medical use, because they can be so addictive. We covered that in Auror training, you wouldn’t have known.”
His voice cracked a little at the end of the sentence, and Draco’s heart was flooded once more with unfamiliar feelings of endearment. “Whenever you like,” was his reply.
. They can have my story, for whatever good it might do. They’re already living in a world without magic, can’t my name bring them a little bit closer to experiencing it, if only in imagination?”
“Good Godric, Potter, what kind of a clothing selection is this?” Draco held out one shirt like it was something a Kneazle had dragged in, then sniffed at it unselfconsciously. “At least it doesn’t smell as bad as it looks.”
“How on earth do you do that? Make it look so easy?” he murmured into Draco’s hair as they swayed in place.
Harry thought to himself wryly. What Hermione had to share was interesting though, he had to admit. Draco had been studying intensively the history of Muggle-Wizard relations, specifically around healing magic, and had come across some precedents of collaboration between Muggle healers and the Wizarding medical community. “Some of it was accidental,” Hermione explained, “an offshoot of alchemical experiments. But some of it was quite deliberate. I think it could be useful for brainstorming ways to build bridges with the modern Muggle community, although obviously quite a few things have changed, with the development of science.”
“I’m not exactly sure. Someplace in Yorkshire, I think, or maybe in the Lake District. I forget where it is geographically, but I made up a name for it too - Lake Friendship.”
Draco scoffed. “You should talk, I’ve never seen more scarf-wearing than among you Gryffindor lot. Or less taste in color coordination.”
Harry’s arms were crossed in front of him, puckering the green satin of his robes. “I don’t know, Draco. Why don’t you tell me what I should be upset about, you seem to have it all figured out.”
“Stop being such a gentleman,” Draco chided. “Go with it, let’s live a little.”
Harry hurried back to the kitchen to check on the sauce. “You’ll find out in a moment. Can I get you anything to drink?”
Harry stopped and turned on Draco. “Honest? You want honesty now?” He drew in a trembling breath. “I hate that I used that curse, and I hate that I can see the traces of a Dark Mark on your arm. I still have nightmares about that night on the tower, with you and Dumbledore, and I wish I’d never had to take your wand. But I can’t just brush it off like you. I don’t know how to do anything but feel the pain and go through it.”
“Look, you can take us out, treat us to dinner or something. The hour’s almost up, I need to get to work soon.”
Harry’s heart fluttered in his chest, and he allowed himself to play along. “Why Draco, whatever is the matter?”
He still carried his wand with him out of habit, but for the most part he had returned to living as a Muggle, minus the Dursleys and the cupboard under the stairs. Instead, he now lived in a cupboard at the top of the stairs, a third-floor loft that could barely be called a flat, it was so tiny and utilitarian. But, it was in the heart of London, and allowed him to take refuge from the downside of being a Wizard and a celebrity. It was a temporary reprieve, he told himself and his closest friends. But so far, he was not missing the Wizarding world much at all.
“Spelled in sick. I have a million days saved up, it’s no bother.” She busied herself with inspecting the living room for lingering bloodstains after depositing a bag of groceries on the tiny table in the kitchen. Draco must have done a pretty good job last night, Harry thought to himself, as she only had to cast a couple of cleaning charms before settling in on Harry’s couch.
Turning back toward his lover, Harry was relieved to see that his eyes had begun to open. He ignored the Mediwizard’s admonitions and leaned over Draco, attempting a smile. “Hey there, Drakes.” He reached down to hold his hand once more. “Did you miss me?”
Ginny still occupied a tender place in his heart, even after the dissolution of the relationship they had enjoyed for a few years. She was the one who had helped him the most with supporting his decision to withdraw from the Wizarding world, after seeing what a deleterious effect celebrity had upon him. Joyful celebrations with close friends had devolved into crowds of sycophants and hungry tabloid writers jostling for attention from the Boy Who not only had Lived, but had led into victory an epic revolt against the greatest villain of their lifetime.
Harry’s expression could only be described as a pout, and Draco was momentarily distracted by the deliciousness of his lips. “That’s not the same thing, and you know it. None of them have any idea that I’m involved with you, just some random Muggle I met in a bar.”
Their meal finished and their appetites curbed for the time being, Harry leaned back against the couch and reached out a hand to play with Draco’s hair. “How can you stand to grow it so long? Mind, I’m not complaining, but if my hair grew like that, I’d be itching to cut it all off.”
Harry groaned and slumped back under the covers until only the tips of his hair and fingers were visible. “I just wish it were over and done with.” He reemerged a few moments later. “D’you know, this will be the first time I’ve willingly shown my face since the whole breaking up with Ginny debacle? I can’t even remember the last photo of me that appeared in the papers, I think I might have been plastered.”
He swallowed before speaking. “Harry… the reason I don’t want to talk to her is because I’m afraid. Afraid that if she knows the truth about us before it goes public, she will have too much power over me.” He interlaced his fingers with Harry’s. “I don’t think I would have a choice but to do what she says, even if it means leaving you.”
The sauna Marcus refers to, when Harry asks after Draco in the bookshop, is Chariots Farringdon, described in their web archive as “offering a more intimate environment for the city gent” (make of that what you will o_0).
Harry’s enthusiastic hug nearly knocked the wind back out of him. “See, I knew you had it in you!” The warmth of Harry’s body surrounding him brought forth an ache in Draco’s heart, and before he knew it, he was choking up a little. He rested his head on Harry’s shoulder and hoped he wouldn’t notice, but Harry was too perceptive.
He contemplated standing up and assessing the damage before allowing Draco to see him, but the dizziness and the pounding on the left side of his skull was only getting worse, so he compromised by wrapping a second towel around his entire head like a turban.
Draco snorted weakly, then winced in pain. “Depends on which body part you ask.” At Harry’s look of concern, he clutched his fingers around Harry’s and nodded. “Yeah, I’m all right. Thanks to this massive healing spell around my ribs.” He licked his lips, which looked dry and chapped. “The bullet was cursed, you know, and it punctured my lung. If they hadn’t gotten to it as quickly as they did, I might be in much worse shape by now.”
Harry sat upright and crossed his legs at this new information, turning to face Draco before he spoke. “That’s tremendous news, Draco. If that’s really the truth, if it’s really what you want, then.” He swallowed. “I can’t stop you. Merlin, if I could…” His voice cracked, and he stopped to gather himself back together. “But I won’t. I’ve been so selfish, but I want you to have the freedom to do whatever you want with your life. Especially with your father back.”
“I couldn’t really say. He’s quite unique.” A little bit
They had stayed on the couch after, covered in a throw blanket rather than putting all their clothing back on just yet. Harry wanted to show him an eighties film about time travel, but for once, Draco wanted to talk first.
“Harry, I looked up to you, even if I didn’t want admit it. I also wanted you to care about me even when I wasn’t sure that I could return the favor. And now we both know that I do care about you.”
His answer teetered as if walking over ground littered with brittle shards of crystal. “Yes, but not in the way you might think.”
He didn’t realize that he’d drifted out of consciousness until he heard a commotion in the living room. It sounded like someone was trying to kick the door in, which was quickly interrupted by some shouts and a loud bang followed by a whooshing sound. Groggily, Harry propped himself up by one arm and made his way off the bed, across the bedroom, and to the door. The sight that greeted him was more dissonant than he could have imagined, and he stared for a few moments, trying to reconcile the two parts of his world that had just collided.
“Hermione, calm down. I didn’t have a thing for anyone back then, besides Cho and Ginny. This is a new development for me, I swear.”
You will notice right away that Draco is called by a different surname, which will be explained in a later chapter, although the reason may become obvious as we go along. Also, not surprisingly, Draco has attitude problems.
Harry kicked him gently in the shin. “You’re such a playboy.”
Draco scoffed. “
Harry took a deep breath. “Here’s what I think we should do. Before we go to any public events, why don’t we grant an interview to Witch Weekly, as a sort of warm-up? Maybe go to a Quidditch match together after?”
It was a sign of Harry’s faith in her abilities that he agreed to go along with her suggestion. Ginny hesitated, but Harry was eventually able to talk her around, insisting that it would be safer to work out a plan from inside the Ministry complex than from a limousine that only concealed its occupants from Muggles.
Harry’s eyes were bright. “Say it.”
Harry hesitated a little, and watched while Draco Summoned the scarf, made of a navy-blue silky material. If this wasn’t a test of faith, he didn’t know what it was. He reasoned with himself that if Draco really had any ill intentions, he wouldn’t have put up with Harry’s magical experimentation at his flat earlier that afternoon. “All right, I’ll give it a try. But I want you to know that I’m not trying it to prove anything.”
Ron didn’t seem to share his alarm. “Hermione, I swear, you’re going to be the next Minister of Magic.” She giggled and waved him off before heading back to the kitchen, and Draco felt something click in his mind as he watched them together.
“I can’t believe you actually have one of those. Do you know how incredibly rare they are?”
Under normal circumstances, Harry would have prodded further and had a good laugh over Ron’s latest antics. Instead, Harry found himself speechless with dread. In a burst of willpower, he blurted out, “Hermione, I’ve started seeing someone.”
inner Gryffindor.” Seeing the raised eyebrows and curled lip about to spring into action, Harry kept going. “You know you have it in you somewhere, the desire to do something daring without worrying too much about the specifics. Or the consequences.”
She waved a glass at him. “An Old Fashioned, thanks to Hermione’s mixology skills. Although I really would have been fine with just Scotch.” She took another sip and looked at him cautiously. “You’re not thinking of having one, are you?”
Harry looked at Nigel, shrugging. “As long as it doesn’t have booze in it, I could try anything.”
“What are you thinking, Draco?” Harry’s tone was light, but his eyes were serious as they entered the hallway together and started shucking off layers. “I don’t want to disappoint you, but I really don’t see the use of going to an event like the Christmas Ball. Unless – “ he paused as he finished taking off his shoes “- you want to make some kind of statement by going.”
Noticing his stunned look and his unaccustomed silence, she changed tack, her face softening a little. “Darling, we’ve talked about this before. You know we don’t mind that you had a little dalliance with him. Or with other men. What we do mind is anything that might ruin our chances to bring the Malfoy family name back into good standing, and you’re not at risk of that here.”
“What, like a librarian?” Harry was very interested to know more.
He jumped in like it was a cold mountain lake on a summer day, without giving himself time to rethink it. “I love you.”
“This display – who came up with the idea?” Belatedly, Potter looked him full in the face and sputtered to a halt. “Wait a minute –
The exhibit did indeed turn out to be erotically themed, although not in a way Harry had expected. The Surrealists had a truly bizarre take on what might be interpreted as sensual or perverse, and he found himself paused more than once before a work of art without knowing what he was supposed to be gathering from it.
Harry nodded without knowing what exactly he was getting into, although he suspected it would feel incredible. “I trust you, Draco.”
“You know, Harry, I haven’t really had a chance to check in with you about everything with Malfoy.” Ginny’s glass was empty, and her face pensive. “I feel badly for not being more involved, it’s just been so crazy for me lately. It was really nice of him to take me out to Harrods, by the way. I don’t think I ever properly thanked him. I was just so thrown by the whole thing after you got Splinched. Something about him brings out my inner dragon - it’s uncanny.”
He cleared his throat. “Well. I helped some Muggles find a book about haunted London.”
“Surely you’re joking. How do you expect me to climb on the roof?”
She hesitated, but once she recognized who he was, she informed him that he was still upstairs with his family. By family, Harry took it to mean Narcissa, who was not banned from entering the Ministry as Lucius had been after the Battle of Hogwarts. “Which floor?”
It was Ginny, and she was not happy. “Merlin’s beard on a stick, what the actual fuck is going on here?” Her eyes flicked between Harry’s wounded ear and Draco’s rumpled appearance, drawing conclusions before either of them had a chance to say anything. “Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t hex Malfoy right now.”
Draco shook his head. “She’s only recently come to terms with me being gay. I very much doubt that she would take kindly to me also being involved with the man who brought about the downfall of their dear leader, even if they hated and feared him by the end.”
She led him to the couch, still talking and divesting him of his coat as they went. “It doesn’t look too bad in terms of blood loss, have you been putting pressure on for at least fifteen minutes? I should get some dittany ointment on it anyway. Also some alcohol to disinfect, d’you have any?” Harry shook his head mutely. “Of course you don’t, I’m sorry I asked.” She started rummaging in her bag. “We can get you cleaned up in the bathroom, just one moment while I find – “
Harry did not look at ease with the turn the conversation had taken. “Sure, I’ve thought about it. Maybe even beaten off to it a couple times. But with Ginny, it just didn’t – really feel appropriate. I loved her too much to feel comfortable sharing.”
She Disapparated after shrugging back into her coat, leaving the two of them shell-shocked. “Did that – “ Harry began.
The tone of the conversation became less fraught as Harry explained to Hermione what he had been going through with Draco. “It’s – I don’t know how to say it, it’s almost as if we’ve been given a chance to revisit our past and rewrite the negative history between us. I can’t say things have been perfect. I wanted to tell you, and Ron, and Ginny, and pretty much everyone in our inner circle, but Draco made me promise that I wouldn’t. We were fine until last weekend, I’ve been avoiding him because he’s been so insufferable about wanting to keep it a secret from his family.”
Draco’s breath hitched a little, and Harry grinned into their kiss. “Can I – “
“Don’t you think you deserve their love?”
Giddy with relief that he had at least told her part of the truth, Harry kept going. “Oh no, nothing like that. Just someone I met at a bar. Without drinking,” he hastened to add. He took a deep breath. “The thing is, they’re different than the type of person I usually date.”
The winds conspired to push him off course as he walked, so much so that by time he reached the pub, he was absolutely freezing. Once inside, he decided to park himself at the bar and order some chips, furtively looking around to check out the clientele. It seemed like a fairly ordinary if elegant place, with cozy lighting and a small curtained stage area at the far end of the room he was in. He was surprised to see a rainbow flag fluttering above the window as he entered, but after his tour through Soho with Mysteria, he was relieved to see that not all gay-friendly venues involved thumping music or glitter.
Finally, every piece of clothing had been tried on, and Harry was thoroughly sick of the tinkling bossa nova music in the background. “Draco?” he called. “Can we go now?”
“So, Harry.” The drink seemed to be working on Draco already, if he was willing to revert to first-name basis. “What is this hovel you spoke of?”
Harry couldn’t quite believe what he’d done, offering Malfoy – Draco – a chance to go flying. But it really was a shame, that someone who was once so keen about Quidditch and brooms was no longer able to enjoy them, and he wanted to share some of that joy. He missed flying with his Quidditch friends, now that Ron was preoccupied with his new side gig and Ginny did more than enough flying at her job.
Harry took his first sip, and was pleasantly surprised. It tasted like violets and tingled sweetly across the tongue, with a bright lemony aftertaste. He wondered what the “essence of Felix Felicis” would do for his mental state.
Harry took him at his word and left shortly thereafter, declaring that he wouldn’t be back until Draco had agreed to meet at least one of his friends. It was the first time they hadn’t spent the rest of the morning together in several weeks, and Draco felt bereft of Harry’s presence. He passed the time by rearranging his record collection, then flipping through the small stack of DVDs that had sprouted up after Harry’s suggestion that he educate himself on Muggle films. The thought of watching one by himself was unappealing, so he spelled Harry to see if he was over himself yet.
The French magazine that Draco reads at night (yes, he does read in at least one foreign language, in my version of him), I chose mostly because of the title, which could be translated as "stubborn, obstinate, or unwilling to yield." The material is relevant to Draco's identity however, as you can see from checking out the Tetu website. ;)
“It’s a fish!” Harry was inordinately pleased with the quilted blue cosy’s form and how it complemented Draco’s dream. “Where on earth did you get this?”
“Honestly, Harry, I don’t know how you get by,” she tutted. “At least tell me you’ve been using one of those planners I gave you.”
“Oh yeah? Which venue is that?” Harry had noticed that Brandon licked his lips and swallowed frequently before he spoke, and wondered if he felt nervous around Harry. What there was to be nervous about, he couldn’t fathom, but it struck him as rather cute.
Once inside, he saw that Ginny had gotten there before him, and they had all gotten started on drinks. “Harry!” She embraced him with more enthusiasm than she had shown toward him in a while, and Harry thought wistfully of how nice it would feel to have just one drink, one escape from the prickly landscape of self-hatred that seemed to have replaced his insides.
, he thought with anguish. Across the city, and across the Wizarding world, people would be reading their interview, and likely glued to their radios as they listened to the unfolding news. To say that things had not gone as planned was a massive understatement. He fumbled for the Protean coin in his pocket and peered anxiously at its surface, but no message had appeared.
“I’ll still help you get there, don’t you worry. As soon as we’re certain that Ginny is out of harm’s way. Auror Hawken is very capable, but she is fairly new at the job.”
If Harry could have opened a window into Draco’s mind, he would have found a miniature tug-of-war under way.
Nestled in bed some hours later, Harry could hear Draco’s heart thumping away beneath his still-tender ear, and thanked whatever powers were listening that they were no longer on the outs. He still had to convince Draco that telling his mother about them was a good idea, but for now he could settle with telling his closest friends. So far, the blowback had been much less than anticipated by either of them, and Harry was grateful for it.
Harry reveals a few new things about himself to Draco, and they revisit a familiar childhood activity together.
Harry held up his hands in weary surrender. “Do what you have to do, Lovegood. Just make sure we have a team in place before the end of the night. We need to keep Ginny out of harm’s way.”
Harry was clearly not expecting this reaction. “Erm, sorry? You know me, I’m not really into fashion, or luxury, or any kind of shopping. Blame him if you have to.” He caught Draco’s eye and smiled a little. Ginny noticed the look between them, and seemed wary if slightly less ornery when Draco followed up with the first sentence that he’d been able to get in edgewise.
“Ginny, I really want to continue this conversation, because I think it’s important for all of us. Right now though, I think you’re right, we need to get back to the Ministry.” He stepped back and held out a hand. “Are you ready?”
“Draco, darling, I wanted to remind you about the gathering we’ll be hosting the weekend after next, for a select group of Ministry officials. Nothing too formal, it’s just another opportunity for your father and I to reestablish our connections.” She paused, and from the set of her mouth, Draco could tell that she was choosing her words carefully. “It might be good for you to know that I’ve invited a few old friends of yours. Specifically, Ms. Parkinson, although she goes by Ms. Danziger now, in honor of her mother. Mr. Zabini, with his partner. I also invited Mr. Potter.”
dunce, and I can live with that.” Their kiss was sweet and promised more to come once they reached the privacy of Draco’s home.
Just a hint of trouble in paradise for Draco and Harry. Draco’s Patronus is revealed.
Harry was suddenly reminded of his missing body part, and of the instructions given to him by the Mediwizards in the meantime.  “How much of this do you think I should take?” Harry asked, holding up one of the many tiny bottles they had left for him. “I forget what they said, and my glasses don’t work nearly as well with just one ear to sit on.”
Draco subsided into silence while his solicitor took up the slack. Her argument seemed to center around the fact that Draco had been immersed in Muggle studies with minimal use of magic and might therefore be forgiven for overreacting to a threat from a gun. But Harry tuned out her words as he grappled with a growing feeling of dread. Based on how this round of questioning was going, it seemed all too possible that they might not let Draco off easy.
Draco’s interest was thoroughly piqued, and he would not let this opportunity pass. “No, go on. I want to hear all the gory details.” It was really too fun, getting the rise out of Ron – he half expected flames to start shooting out of his ears at any moment.
Young man, he corrected himself, as he looked over Malfoy’s outfit. Harry did not know much about fashion, but he knew enough to appreciate Malfoy’s care for detail, down to the tasteful leather shoes and loosely buttoned jacket. Hell, he looked
“Thought you weren’t drinking.”
As if they had read his mind, Mysteria dropped him a wink. “Had you fooled, didn’t I? I’m a Squib, Mr. Potter, and proud of it.”
Draco returns to Malfoy Manor and has an awakening.
“I know you’re not supposed to do magic right now, at least not outside of your house. I haven’t been doing much magic myself, besides a few domestic charms and Apparition. But I think you might like this, if we can get you on a broom without triggering an alert.”
Harry followed along despite the whiplash he felt from Draco’s earlier words, his heart fluttering and rising into his throat. This was a side of Draco he had yet to experience, and he wasn’t sure how to take it. Was he being serious now, or was this just another, admittedly very thrilling ploy to avoid an important conversation and hide his true feelings from Harry?
The fireplace roared to life again, and Draco brought his head up with a start. It was his mother, and he found himself sitting up automatically with a straight posture, as he always did in her presence. She was smiling this time, and Draco smiled back. “Hello Mother.”
Harry did not like the direction this was going, and he had had enough of Draco’s stonewalling.
“What? Oh this is great, all my friends think I’m queer?”
“There’s a Christmas Ball for Ministry employees and guests coming up, maybe I can introduce you then. Will we see you and Harry there?” Ginny asked him, with a cocked eyebrow.
, thought Draco sleepily, before drifting into a weightless dream state. He couldn’t remember the last time he had felt so relaxed and at peace.
He winced at the sting of his thoughts turning upon him, and resolved to act less full of himself in the future.
Mysteria grabbed his hand and led him behind the waiter, who seemed bent on finding them the most exclusive booth possible. Once parked, Mysteria turned their gaze upon Harry. “What does it matter, you can still enjoy yourself, yes?”
Harry could not rid Draco from his mind that night, after experiencing the bewitching combination of his kisses and his undivided attention. He wanted more of both in the worst possible way, even while he struggled to come to terms with his newfound feelings of attraction to someone like Draco. Not to mention someone who was already intimate with other men on a regular basis. But the hour was late, and he would have to get some sleep before connecting with his former arch-nemesis again.
Hermione bristled in turn at Draco’s tone, but Harry preempted any further combative speech by sitting down, hard. He was much weaker and still more affected by drink than he had thought. Hermione rushed to his side and checked his pulse, then looked up at Draco with a worried expression. “He Splinched himself and lost an ear, if you must know. I’m not letting you move anywhere until I get him stabilized.”
“Harry, stay with me.” He’d forgotten about the wand in his hand, which was still connected to Hermione’s spell. “I need you to find something right away, and put pressure on your wound. Stay elevated, I don’t want you lying down just yet.”
Ginny pulled out the glowing pills again and evaluated them. “I’m not sure, maybe a half? I need something to split one for you. Harry, are you sure you don’t want the other half, for old time’s sake?”
“What am I even looking at? Is it just me, or is Draco’s taste all over the place?”
We're getting close to the end, y'all... I will do my best to have the next chapter posted over the weekend. This chapter was much easier for me to write, once I decided that I wanted to give the Malfoys a chance at redemption. :)
Harry looked as if he’d been punched, and Draco almost wished he had punched him, to shake off the awful feeling of being crushed from the inside by his own ill-will. Instead, he settled for staring Harry down, waiting for a response.
Draco wondered if he should object, but the prospect of Harry tutoring him in powerful magic was appealing enough that he decided not to say anything. Instead, he rose from the bed and Levitated the tray out of the way while he straightened the covers. “I’m going to bathe first, but feel free to get started while I’m at it.” His eyes swept over Harry’s mostly naked body for one more heart-stopping moment before heading toward the loo.
Draco had had enough of this conversation. “Let’s have something to eat first, I could eat a hippogriff.”
“I’ll spell you in the morning, how about that. You have the day off?”
He smiled at her through the lump in his throat. “I have a few things to take care of this afternoon, but I do believe I will take you up on that offer.”
“You never asked.”
Draco still struggled with his deeply ingrained image of Harry as an attention-seeking Gryffindor. “Doesn’t he know what a gift he has, though? Can’t he just enjoy it, without all that angst?”
Mariage Frères in Paris is real, and I speak from personal experience when I say that they had the best variation on Earl Grey that I have ever tasted.
Harry had failed to notice that Draco was carrying a four-pack, which he now set down on the low-lying table in Harry’s living room. Curious, Harry walked over to pick one up, and was surprised to see that they appeared to be Wizarding drinks. “FELICI-FIZZ,” the label trumpeted, with an artfully drawn witch who flew around the bottle in perpetuity, toasting him with a wink.
“It’s early yet, no need to get up.” Draco settled back into bed, spelling the breakfast tray to float above the covers out of harm’s way. “Unless you feel like it.” His stare was arch. “They’re all busy downstairs with preparing for our grand transformation after lunch, which means that you and I have a bit of time to ourselves.”
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “Not even Hermione? I tell her everything.”
The cacophony that greeted them was overwhelming, and it was all they could do to keep from turning around and diving back into the car. Every Wizarding reporter in London had a question for them, it seemed, and each question was accompanied by a frenzy of flashes, as the attendant photographers snapped away. Draco thanked his ancestors that there were barriers lined on either side of the red carpet, so that their way forward was relatively unimpeded. The sight of the Ministry building looming ahead had never seemed so welcoming.
“What did you tell Ron about last night?” he asked her first thing, when she Apparated to his doorway, neatly dressed in Muggle clothing.
do? What did
Harry reappeared at the door. “I may not be drinking booze right now, but I have other things, like sparkling water and juice. Or milk?”
“You’re damn right I did,
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry brought her a plate of breakfast and a virgin mimosa, which she sipped gratefully. “At a Muggle bookshop, of all places. He’s taken to working part-time through his immersion program.”
The one with the knife turned upon him, and several things happened at once. Harry stepped back, wary but not sober enough to react quickly. The person to the knifer’s right took advantage of the distraction and tackled him, while to Harry’s left, he became aware of someone hefting a weapon in his direction. Glancing out of the corner of his eye, he was able to identify the weapon as club of sorts, possibly a cricket bat, and it was rushing dangerously close to his head. He did the only thing he could think of to remove himself from the situation quickly and effortlessly.
Potter looked nonplussed, but Draco was too tired and drunk to care. He flung himself into the nook and Summoned a couple of mugs to the table, gesturing for Potter to sit across from him. Potter sat, warily. His Gryffindor signals were flying as clear as day, and Draco found himself wondering if Potter was ever able to turn it off, the curiosity and longing to plunge into every situation without thinking it through. The thirst for adventure.
impulse come from, and where in holy hell was his Seeker’s curiosity about to lead him?
The question was answered by Malfoy himself, who opened the door and paused on the steps between the door and the sidewalk, looking at something in his hand. Harry couldn’t figure out what it was until he lifted it to his ear, and then he understood. It was a mobile phone, and Malfoy was talking into it.
Draco flinched a little, but his only response was to cover Harry’s hand with his own for a moment before turning away and getting up from the bed. As he retrieved his clothing, Harry watched him with concern, mixed with admiration at how gracefully he moved. He didn’t understand Draco’s silence, but he could still enjoy the moment by watching him in the dying light while he waited.
Draco made a shushing gesture. “Now now, we’ll have none of that. First we find what makes you look best, then we talk pricing. Clerks can be – flexible.”
She reached out a hand to pinch at Draco's cheek in a mocking sort of way, but he dodged and glared. “Why does everyone insist on calling me a kitten?”
She looked taken aback. “Is that something that bothers you? That I’m famous now?”
“I can’t believe you like that rubbish. If you have to do it at all, why not go with George’s new venture instead and get involved in virtual Wizarding games?”
bloke in particular?”
His therapist looked at him with puzzlement. “I’m sorry. Did you say… Muggles?”
Brandon was looking at him with concern. “I think you’re a little drunk, are you sure you don’t need help getting there?”
Draco pulled his hand away abruptly, and looked somewhere into the middle distance. The light in his eyes had gone flat and colorless, and Harry noticed with a pang that his mouth had started to tremble in turn. Draco’s hands twisted themselves into the coverlet and picked nervously at a stray thread before stilling. He looked back at Harry.
Harry found himself obeying, even as he felt vaguely insulted at being commanded like a dog. Any protest he might have had died on his lips as he felt a familiar sensation of warmth and wetness surround his cock. Draco’s mouth undulated like a sea serpent upon him, and Harry couldn’t hold back groans of pleasure as the sensation carried on, relentlessly. Just when he thought he might be at the point of climax, Draco removed him from his mouth and slid himself up the length of Harry’s body till their hips aligned. He brought his lips to Harry’s ear and whispered, very low, “Do you trust me now?”
Harry was still gathering himself together, but Hermione seemed to be less on guard than before, if begrudgingly. “Why don’t I talk to Ron about it, maybe we can have the two of you over for dinner. Discreetly, of course.” Her expression was softened by the tears she had shared with Harry, and Draco felt that he might have been rather harder on her than necessary.
“Mother…” He skimmed his tongue over his lips nervously, refusing to look directly at Harry just yet. “May I have a word with Harry, in private?”
Harry left the shop in a daze, after exchanging a few more words with Malfoy, who looked more approachable somehow, in Muggle clothing and Muggle surroundings. The Quidditch display had thrown him for a loop, no question, and he wondered to himself whether Malfoy thought he was an insufferable berk for caring about finding himself illustrated in a book about Quidditch history. A whisper of Snape’s voice crept to the forefront of his mind, berating him for thinking he was Special. And yet, Harry had spent the better part of the year trying to erase his Specialness. What more did his conscience want?
“Harry, meet Nigel. Nigel, meet Harry.”
Hermione’s hand hovered toward her mouth, as if in suspense. “What are you saying? Is it – surely you’re not seeing someone dangerous, are you?”
Harry did notice a change in the air, and by time they reached the kitchen, he was almost sweating. “I guess you live up to the Slytherin reputation, eh? Cold-blooded and reptilian?”
“Private” ended up being a narrow hallway between two of the tiniest offices in the department (he suspected that his cousin Lucy occupied one of them, being the most junior Auror). A tiny window at one end illuminated Harry’s face, anxious and drawn. Draco finally permitted himself a good long stare, which seemed to hearten Harry. Poor sod.
“Draco?”
Harry cleared his throat. “Well, um, he’s very nice. A little hard to approach at first, but once you get to talking with him, he has a lot of interesting things to say. He knows London pretty well, and we went shopping the other day. He said I needed to upgrade my look.”
Draco closed his eyes and breathed in deeply through his nose. On the exhale, his and Harry’s chairs shot backwards, neatly depositing Harry on the ground. Or he would have ended up there, if Draco hadn’t tightened his grip on Harry’s hand and pulled him to standing. The fierce glitter in his eyes had returned, and as Harry rose, Draco’s other hand came around to palm one side of his face and pull him in for a kiss. “Sometimes I love it when you get mad and call me by my surname,” he whispered, in a rumble that sent shivers up Harry’s spine. “All those years of insulting each other, I think I was really just a glutton for punishment.”
He started gathering up dishes in a huff, but Hermione surprised him by leaning forward and putting a hand on his arm. “Don’t get up, Malfoy. I want to hear what you have to say.” He sat down again, taken aback and not entirely convinced that she meant well. But Harry was there, and the beseeching look in his eyes was more than he could bear.
“Magic is… a force to be drawn upon. It’s everywhere, but available only to the people who know to look for it and can use it with proper training. It’s another way of tapping into the wisdom of the human mind, and not everyone is lucky enough to access it.”
.” He tossed his head so that the ruby tinkled lightly against the small golden hoop it was hanging from. “The earring was a last-minute idea from Nigel, who sent it to me.”
Draco did his bidding, astonished at what Harry’s request meant for them.
His robe had slipped to one side and he could feel Harry’s eyes grazing over him in a not disinterested way, but the moment passed quickly. “Transformation? What are they going to do, turn us into hedgehogs?” Harry looked amused with a side of queasy. “Surely it won’t take that long.”
Harry did so, tingling with the simultaneous feeling of pressure on his groin and Draco’s imagined gaze sweeping over his backside. The warmth of Draco’s body soon settled over Harry’s, and he thrilled at the sensation of him resting squarely on his sacrum.
Harry, at the moment that Draco was bemoaning his absence on his therapist’s couch, was not doing well. He longed to spell Hermione and unload everything on her, but it wasn’t the end of the week yet and besides, he couldn’t betray Draco by revealing his identity. He was still angry at Draco for putting him in this position of dishonesty, yet at the same time he really couldn’t blame him. The rules were different in his world, and Harry despaired that he might never be able to connect with him in a meaningful way, especially after holding out against him while he waited for Draco to come around and agree to share their secret with his friends. Why did he have to be so set in sticking to his principles all the time? Couldn’t he, for once, indulge his Slytherin side and throw integrity to the winds?
, of all people. But there they were, and he had to accept it. “Besides, I don’t know how else I would have broken the news to my parents, they are absolutely mental when it comes to my romantic prospects.”
“Well, actually – “ Malfoy didn’t seem any more enthusiastic about the idea than Harry felt (his previous magnanimity toward Malfoy all but forgotten), but it was too late. The posse surrounding him had decided that they were going to sit together, and that Malfoy and Harry wanted to talk. Which is how they found themselves squashed next to each other in a wine bar in Soho.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco grinned, which felt out of place on his face. “No, I’m working this weekend, so I have today off too. Why don’t you come around for teatime, I can make you a real cuppa then. Learn more about your chequered past.“
Draco put a stop to any further mental gymnastics on Harry's part by stepping into the bathroom. “Harry, I think what she is trying to say is, Ginny thinks that watching you and I together would be really hot.”
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Kbrick's beta support during the revising of this chapter was invaluable. I really am going to stop now, it goes without saying at this point. :)
“Yes?” she nudged him gently in the silence that followed. “What is it that you wish?”
Once that was taken care of, Harry pulled on an extra jumper, checked the mirror to see if there were any leftover traces of snogging Draco, and climbed through the skylight to the roof with his wand between his teeth. The window was big enough that he could see below if Draco got up and went anywhere. With the sun just beginning its final descent into night, Harry activated the com-spell, only to panic and end it before she could pick up.
“Bloody hell, Granger, can’t you cast some kind of pain relief charm? He said he’s hurting, and I think you should listen to him.”
Hermione was smiling a little, and Draco felt less uncomfortable about baring his soul to her. “You know, I’ve been meaning to ask you – what would you say to meeting up and having a proper academic discussion about the material I’ve been studying? Muggle history, and alchemy, and such?” He saw her hesitation, and tried to sweeten the deal. “Mind, I know you’re busy and all, but I do miss having a like-minded Wizard to talk to about these sorts of things. I love Harry, but in-depth intellectual debates aren’t really his thing, are they?”
It was clear she was just as shaken as he was, turning a wide-eyed gaze upon him that quickly narrowed into fury.
Harry felt clumsy, out of his element, and insanely turned on by Draco’s nearness. He even smelled good, the wanker, like the sweetness of rain after a dry sunny day. “What’s a man ray, is it some gay thing I don’t know about?”
Their kisses came hot and heavy now, rife with tongue and teeth and shimmering lust, and Harry’s hands found their way to Draco’s arse, which seemed made for him to hold on to. Draco’s kisses began to wander downward, and his hands wandered even lower until one encircled Harry’s cock and the other, with Harry’s permission, reached underneath to penetrate him with a well-lubricated finger.
“Draco, I’m serious! This is very new territory for me, I hope you’re okay with that.”
Draco met him at the center of the room, and it was as if their surroundings fell away, leaving only two minds, two heartbeats, two sets of eyes that drank each other in.
Salvador Dalí’s
Satisfied, Brandon turned toward the barkeep and raised a hand. “Hey, Sam! A pint of your finest ale for my new friend here.” Seeing that Sam was still entangled with the cluster of women, he called out, “Shake a leg, will ya?”
“Well, Mr. Malfoy. It’s quite a transformation you seem to have gone through. What prompted you to give up your Pureblood views and take an interest in Muggles? Or are they just another academic project for you?”
Draco looked to be on the verge of cracking an expression, but Harry’s eyes were blurring already at the gesture of truce between them, as preliminary as it might be. He felt maudlin and laughable, like he had two left feet and could take off toward the ceiling any minute in the manner of an escaped balloon.
“Luna!” Harry had no such reservations, and plunged forward to give her a quick hug. “What brings you here?”
Harry couldn’t help but be impressed. “Wow, that’s really… Wow. Not what I was expecting to hear.” He shifted a little in his seat. “Why are you telling me this, exactly?” The worried look on her face wouldn’t go away, and he was starting to feel alarmed. “Is it – is he okay?”
Draco goes on trial, and Harry and Ginny have a moment.
Ginny shook off his arm. “Not that, I mean what was a deranged person like that doing on the red carpet outside the Ministry? And with a
“Oh for Merlin’s sake.” Harry snatched up a bottle and closed one fist over the top. There were not many occasions for it now, but the bottle-opening charm had stayed with him from his wilder days. It really drove home for him how helpless Draco must feel, not to be able to exert even the simplest magic outside of his home.
Draco had hoped he wouldn’t bring that up either, but Harry was like a Crup with a bone once he got going. “Well, you know my father was in Azkaban for a little while, right?” He skipped over the part where Voldemort had broken him out of prison and made his life a living hell, and tried to express himself as neutrally as possible. “He never quite managed to rebuild his life once the Dark Lord was vanquished, although Mother did her best. I still haven’t seen him since he left.”
“You might as well have, for all we knew of each other. Where were you when I was trying to hold it together, on the run looking for Horcruxes and watching my friends get murdered? Where were you, Draco?”
To any potential beta out there: I had some trouble coming up with an effective magical means for communication between wizards on the go, before mobile phones were ubiquitous, but eventually settled on com-spells, short for “communications spells,” which are sort of a modified charm based on the Floo Network. I am open to revising if you can help me come up with something better.
Would the animal metaphors never end? Harry was going to say something snarky but let it go when Draco closed his eyes and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. If anything, Draco reminded him more of a cat, while Harry felt – well, he didn’t know what animal he felt like at the moment. Possibly an otter who was ready for a nap after frolicking in the water for too long. The contemplation reminded him of a question he’d had about Draco for a while.
They repeated the exercise a few times before landing in an upscale wine bar and restaurant. Harry was hungry by that point, and indicated that he wouldn’t mind eating, as long as the stranger didn’t think it was a date. “What is your name, by the way?”
Draco thought to himself.
It was odd that Harry didn’t want to talk about it, but Draco was feeling patient. He coaxed the story out of Harry, bit by bit, even the parts that made him feel closed up inside.
“Never mind the details, I just want to finish my thought around my conversation with Draco.”
, I’m asking you now. And you’d better tell me, or you’ll be fixing for a tickle.”
Harry frowned a little deeper. “Nigel’s back?”
“Hi Harry. Sorry about the wait, Nigel and I were – busy.”
When the kiss was over, Draco locked eyes with Harry and told him what he had been wanting to say for several days. “I think it’s time for you to show me. How to cast a Patronus.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right, the interview.” Harry nervously ran his hand over his scalp again. Any feeling of disappointment or relief at this piece of news was dwarfed by his concern for Draco. The press could do what they wanted, as long as he could know for certain that Draco was all right.
The new Auror inclined her head gravely and offered a hand to Harry. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Potter.” Her gaze moved past him toward Ginny, who was beginning to stir from slumber, although Feruza appeared to still be fast asleep. “You all must be exhausted after going through what you have. Ms. Weasley and I have met before, under different circumstances. I had hoped it wouldn’t come to this, but here we are.”
“Oh Harry,” was Hermione’s response, when he first outlined their plan to her. “You never go by halves, do you.” She was doing the washing up and magically flicked aside a couple more dishes before settling down and taking him into her full attention. “Was it Draco’s idea or yours?” She had taken to calling him Draco instead of Malfoy, and Harry loved her for it.
, and so he did, without a moment’s hesitation. By time he had reached Ginny’s side, the stranger had a gun pointed toward her and seemed about to use it, so Harry acted upon the second thought that popped into his head, and grabbed her arm to Disapparate them both to safety.
Alone at last, Harry found himself fidgeting with the now useless Protean coin. Pulling himself together, he stepped forward and sat on one side of the bed after the briefest inner flicker of hesitation. “Drakes.” He stretched out one hand to meet with Draco’s, lying on the coverlet. “Are you all right? Did they get you all patched up?”
No matter how he thought about it, he couldn’t break his promise to Draco and reveal his identity just yet, and so he resolved to only share the bare minimum. Which still took courage.
After Draco and the team with the stretcher had vanished, Harry felt abandoned and overwhelmed. He almost staggered with the weight of it all bearing down upon his heart, and looked around for something, anything, to distract him from the pain of not knowing what would happen to Draco. He landed on Ginny, who was huddling with Feruza, looking miserable and cold. He walked over and cast a Warming Charm over the three of them.
She nodded and took his hand in hers. “Remember, Shield Charms up as soon as we get there.”
“I missed you too.” He really had. “But I should tell you something.”
They circled around the lake several times before Draco finally piped up and said he would like to go back to the city. Harry obliged and Apparated them both to Draco’s street without thinking. Fortunately, it was late enough that the street lay empty, illuminated by elegant lamps and absent of prying eyes peering through windows, as far as they could see. Music throbbed somewhere in the distance, but Draco declined Harry’s offer to go somewhere and invited him inside instead.
“I’m glad you and Ginny are starting to get along,” Harry declared, placing one arm behind Draco along the back of the seat. “Although I feel like you’re speaking another language sometimes.” He buried his nose in the hair at the back of Draco’s neck and breathed deeply of his scent. “You must think I’m a total dunce when it comes to fashion.”
Draco clearly struggled to answer, but he waved aside any help from his defense. “I cannot say that my actions were directly tied to Mr. Potter’s influence, no.” He paused for a heart-stopping moment. “I will say however that I would not have been present if it weren’t for Mr. Potter and our desire to be positive role models for the Wizarding world.” His eyes barely flickered in Harry’s direction. “My actions, while misguided, were carried out with good intentions.”
“Sorry Harry, I don’t think I can say no.” She looked Draco over and stood up to go. “I have a big do coming up, some promotional thing for the Harpies, and I need a new gown pronto. Maybe this’ll be a good way for me to understand a little more of whatever you two think you’re playing at.” She refused to shake hands but gave Draco a slight nod. “Thanks for looking after him last night. I still think you’re a pretentious prat, but at least you have some sense when it comes to men and fashion. Spell me when the two of you are ready to retail, I’m free for the next few days.”
There were several repeats of this throughout the next couple of days, as the Saturday of the Christmas Ball loomed near, and Draco contemplated spelling up Ginny, or Hermione, or Salazar’s balls, even Ron. He knew that Harry could be anxious from time to time, but never had he seen him so thoroughly trapped in the coils of his own making. It almost helped to negate Draco’s own feelings of trepidation around his mother and her inevitable reaction when the news hit.
“Oh, I doubt we will. Sometimes I use my Invisibility Cloak, but only if there’s daylight out.”
Draco blinked at Harry’s question, considering. “I suppose I never thought of doing otherwise. All the men – and women – in my family tend to grow their hair long as they get older. Especially the blond ones.”
He could almost see her ears perk up as she leaned forward slightly. “No, who is he?”
Tonight, however, was different. He dreamed that Potter showed up in a magic shop, looking for a new wand, and Draco, in the role of shop assistant, helped him to try them out, one by one. The magic shop felt suspiciously like a play set, and Draco was not surprised when it turned out that they had been performing in front of an audience all along, only to feel the bottom of his stomach drop out when he saw that the audience consisted of Dementors. He woke up then, his legs kicking themselves free of the sheets and his arms gripping one of the several pillows surrounding him. He swung himself up to sitting and Summoned a glass of water, hands trembling. The demons might take a different form tonight, but they were still there.
Draco was aghast to see that tears had started to spill from Harry’s eyes. Because it was Harry, he willed himself not to back away or make overly light of the situation, even if he wasn’t entirely in the wrong. “Harry…” he stretched out a hand… “I’m sorry.”
I thought it would be cute to make a reference to the popularity of the Harry Potter series in the Muggle world, without mentioning the author’s actual name. I happen to disagree with JKR on some issues, but if any characterization of her sounds disparaging here, that was not my intention, just Draco’s (!).
After an uncertain glance at Harry, who nodded reassurance, she accepted Trevor’s arm and ushered Feruza along with her as they headed back toward the limousine. Harry brought up the rear, looking nervously over his shoulder for any potential attackers or press, but it seemed that the mob of people outside the barriers had subsided. It was a small, and unfortunate, relief to Harry that the crowds had been spooked by the night’s events, and he wondered how the Daily Prophet was going to handle the flow of news for the next twelve hours or so.
“Really?” Harry removed his hands from Draco’s shoulders and peeled his jumper off, before making his way into the kitchen. “Then you’re not as brave as I thought.”
Harry was frozen, lips responding but hands limp at his sides, as if they’d forgotten where they could go. Draco grabbed them with a hiss of impatience and placed them on his hips, leaning into Harry with as much weight as he could manage without crashing into the wall behind. Harry’s hands had finally come to life, and Draco could feel a moan of relief bubbling to the surface as he relaxed into the familiarity of it. Godric, he would miss this.
When Nigel returned, a deep ruby drink garnished with orange peel in either hand, Harry was just beginning to look through the collection of records that Draco had amassed in a large cupboard across the room. “Pretty impressive, innit?”
“Er, no, not really. I’ve had more than enough of that, remember?” He tapped his scar for emphasis. “I’ve only just gotten used to not being papped every time I try to go on an errand. Like when we were living together.” He shuddered. “It was awful, and I’m sorry if that’s something you’ve had to get used to.”
She raised her eyebrows. “I’ll see if I can come up with something else, but it’ll do in a pinch.”
Draco’s head vanished before Harry could question him, and Harry was reduced to feeling foolish as he put each clothing item on and struck a cheesy pose before the mirror. It was almost as bad as the photo shoot he had endured during the one interview he’d done with Witch Weekly. But Draco was true to his word – by time Harry had finished trying everything on, Draco brought him a smaller selection and removed some of Harry’s rejects.
Draco could, oddly enough, but he chose to keep his feelings inside and smiled pityingly at him instead, wanting to keep the upper hand. “I can see, but I don’t believe.”
“Wow. So Ron knows about you, then? That must have put his knickers in a twist.”
Harry mustered up as much as he could and cast again. This time, Hermione picked up right away, as if she had been waiting for him. “Harry! Something went funny earlier, were you not able to get through?” Before he could answer, she carried on with a note of exasperation in her voice. “It might have something to do with the product Ron’s been developing, which has a disruptive magical shield component. He and Mr. Weasley have been tinkering forever, I’m just about ready to hex them both.”
“Look, you know that I’m not used to being with men. I’ve never even so much as kissed anyone before you.” Harry’s gaze dropped a little, and he swallowed, mouth dry. “I still don’t know if I would call myself gay, but I do know that I really enjoyed this.” He shifted a little to push Draco off his chest and sit up cross-legged on the bed, which hadn’t had time to lose its covers before he and Draco had thrown themselves upon it. “I hope that’s okay with you, that I have so little experience with men.”
Brandon laughed at him, without malice. “Glad we have that cleared up, Harry. Are you doing all right with your drink, or should we get you something a little less strong for the road?”
Harry looked lost for words, and so Draco continued. “She’s been having me followed by a private investigator, which is why she knew about us and was able to get the interview pulled, with some help from an old friend whose family runs the Daily Prophet. She also said something to the Ilvermorny school board, I’m not sure what. Probably something nasty, she can be pretty ruthless sometimes. Whatever it was, she convinced them to end the terms of my contract a few weeks early so I could go back to doing magic, without losing my standing. However, there’s a catch.” It was his turn to stare at the floor. “She’s heard from my father. He’s coming home, and she wants me there, so we can have a go at being a real family again.” His eyes still on the floor, he willed himself to keep speaking through the growing mass of emotions in his throat. “I want it too, but she won’t do it with you or anyone who isn’t family around.”
Brandon smiled and ran one finger around the rim of his glass. “It’s not just here, you know. The World’s End, a rival pub just down the block, is also rumored to be haunted. Particularly the music venue in the basement.”
.” Harry spat out his name in a passable imitation of how Draco used to say his own. It felt oddly satisfying in the moment. He wasn’t prepared for its effect on Draco however, who instead of looking hurt, or confused, or angry, almost looked as if he were – pleased?
“Yes. Only it wasn’t colorful, it was just glowing. It seemed friendly though.”
Draco had the decency not to leer, and stepped back when Harry made a move to enter. “Make yourself at home, I will get dressed and be down in half a tick. With Nigel.”
When he re-entered the main room of the loft, he saw Draco looking at the décor. There were a few paintings hanging on the wall, a reminder of his Grimmauld Place inheritance from Sirius, which he had studiously avoided inhabiting since the end of the War, and Harry wondered, not for the first time, what they said about him and his taste. Ginny had seemed to like them, the few times he’d invited her over, but he had a feeling that Draco’s opinion would be more critical.
“Gay.” Draco’s tone was impudent.
“No, that didn’t work out in the end. He said he’s coming back to London and might be at the Christmas Ball tonight. Won’t that be a hoot, introducing him to Ginny and the rest of your friends.”
She nodded, made a note, and fixed him again with her gaze. “And do you feel that you yourself are not one of them?”
Harry could not believe what he was hearing, nor could Draco, from the looks of it, although he masked his shock quickly once Harry’s eyes darted toward him. Harry willed himself not to act defensively and tried to steady his gaze on Narcissa’s face. “Mrs. Malfoy, with all due respect… I think Draco should choose where he wants to call home.” Heart pounding, he stretched out his hand and looked over at Draco.
“Ugh, fine. We don’t have to take Nigel out for dinner, but I do insist on inviting him over to my place. With you there. We owe him that much.”
There was nothing so disorienting as waking up in a familiar location, such as his bed, with several unfamiliar factors at play. There was Draco, factor one, looking silly but delicious in a pair of Harry’s pajamas that were blue covered in jellybeans (a gag gift from George). There was the sensation of gauze wrapped around his head, and the slight itch of his recently reattached ear. And there was the angle of the light, which was much different than his usual hour of waking.
Harry went a bit pink. “Why don’t you try tasting it first before you say anything.”
Harry choked on his food and dove for his falling napkin, still coughing on his way up. He waved away Draco’s offer to bang him on the back, and gradually returned to a state of pink-cheeked calm. “Up until recently, I don’t think I would have thought of that.”
He seemed surprised when Harry treated them to lattes and biscotti later.
She waved him away, smiling a little. “Oh no, that won’t be necessary. I have everything I need.”
Draco snorted. “Witch Weekly? Fuck that rubbish, if we’re granting any interviews, it’s going to be to the Daily Prophet. As for the match, I love Quidditch but I’d rather make our debut at an event where I can dress to the bloody nines.”
Draco was not entirely sure where this might be going. Harry had followed him to the den, and what’s more, had put up with Draco’s not so subtle hint. As soon as he had finished adjusting his collar however, he was taken over by an unhabitual shyness and moved back to the matter at hand, which was to thoroughly beat Harry in cards. It didn’t seem to be working, however. Harry proved surprisingly fast and ended up with far more cards in the end than Draco could have anticipated. The Felici-Fizz he had drunk that night, it seemed, had made him overconfident.
“Can’t you think of something more interesting to say? Like what life was like before you became famous Harry Potter?”
Draco finished toweling, then took the wand. It felt uncanny to him, like an old friend he hadn’t seen in a long time and who had changed drastically in his absence. “Ten inches, hawthorn, with a unicorn hair at its core,” he murmured, as if channeling Mr. Ollivander. He gave it an experimental flick.
“Continue the family bloodline. What happens then?”
Harry was not, to Draco’s chagrin, and over the next few days, it became apparent how serious the situation was. A drought of Harry had begun, and Draco was furious.
Ginny makes her first appearance, and there is a bit of swearing, as well as a moderate amount of drinking by the end. No body parts were harmed in the writing of this chapter.
Draco’s hand swung up to stop him. “I’m ticklish,” he explained. “And I don’t do cuddling usually.” He turned around to face Harry, still a little bit flushed. “That was fun though.”
Harry perked back up once Draco had agreed. “Wanna go now?”
“Mr. Potter,” she intoned, heavy-lidded as usual. “I want you to know that I am a big fan of yours. But, my admiration for you and your cause has its limits. I do not want to share Ginny, nor do I think you want it either.” She paused, irresolute. “However. Ginny has shared with me that she would very much like to – what is the expression – ‘get off’ while watching.” She jabbed a finger in the direction of the bedroom, where Draco was waiting. And listening, Harry was willing to bet. “She thinks that Draco is, and I quote, ‘yummy.’ ” A feeling that Feruza clearly did not share, but Harry was oddly touched by how much she seemed to care about presenting the case of Ginny’s fantasy to him, as discomfiting as the gesture might be.
Harry grinned, relieved. “Well, that part I like the sound of. But really, have you seen me try to dance?”
The Chief Warlock had several questions for Draco after all of the other witnesses had been called, but his solicitor requested a brief recess. It took an inhuman amount of effort for Harry to prevent himself from running after Draco as he exited the room. Why was it that he, media darling and Draco’s closest ally, couldn’t be allowed the satisfaction of talking to him?
Harry’s smile widened, and Draco was put out to find that all three of them were chuckling. “Sorry, Sir Ocelot, we can’t help remembering the time you were turned into a ferret.” He put an arm around Draco to take the sting out of his words. “Old Mad-Eye Moody really had it in for you that year, even if he turned out to be Barty Crouch Jr. in the end.”
“What? You never learned how?” Harry’s astonishment made his voice climb an octave.
Harry opened his mouth to correct him, but Mysteria swept in before he had a chance to set the record straight. “School chums, how sweet. You must have some catching up to do.”
“Harry.” Draco’s look was scathing. “You’re the Boy Who Lived, and Vanquished. I think they might have room for you, even if you don’t technically work for the Ministry anymore.”
“Well, Draco, I’d like to ask you over to my place. For dinner. I think I can explain better that way, why I’m living the way I am. And why I’m not eager to return to being the Boy Who Lived.”
Harry’s eyes were still wide when he turned to face Draco. “Merlin’s beard, I don’t even know. I can’t quite believe – did I really just come out to the Daily Prophet?” When Draco nodded, Harry buried his face in his hands. “What was I thinking, how are we supposed to go through with the Christmas Ball after that?”
Draco accepted the clothing but made no move to dress just yet. “I think it’s more about reversing roles, and being looked down upon rather than feared and respected. I don’t mind a little pain, but it’s really the insults to my ego that get me off, as far as you’re concerned.”
“I’m not sure what kind of a statement we’re trying to make here, but damn you look good.”
“Harry, have you been drinking?”
This was usually the point when they agreed to disagree, but Harry felt like he had gone too far this time. “Draco Malfoy, I wish you’d listen to yourself more often. You can sound like a real arsehole sometimes.”
He was about to start spelling contacts at the Ministry when someone knocked on the limousine window closest to Harry, causing all of them to jump. It was Luna. He ignored Trevor’s scowl and rolled down the window.
Malfoy – Draco – appeared to be mollified, but he did not sit down, choosing instead to start clearing away the dishes. The food vanished as it approached a dishwashing unit under the counter, and Harry found himself momentarily mourning the loss of such fine pastry.
A few hours later, after switching to the less violent game of
(See the end of the chapter for
. Harry couldn’t decide whether he was more pleased or mystified by it, as most of what they said was gobbledegook to him. Confronted with a multitude of gowns to choose from, Draco urged Ginny to “try the Givenchy, I think it will look darling on you.”
It took some prodding, but after Potter had taken several sips of his drink, Draco was gratified to learn the story of his upbringing and why he seemed relatively at ease in the Muggle world. He did not consider himself an empathetic person, but after hearing about the Dursleys and the cupboard under the stairs, he started to feel almost sorry for Harry. Not to mention the whole thing about his parents dying at the hands of the Dark Lord. His troubles with his own father paled in comparison – at least he knew that he was alive, even if he couldn’t see him any more.
“Forget that, I’m ordering a limo.” Apparently this was easy for Ginny to accomplish, for within fifteen minutes they were collecting their coats and breathing in the cold night air as they stepped outside. Draco directed the driver to his street, which was not too far from where the ball was being hosted. He couldn’t help noticing the whispers and giggles coming from Ginny’s side of the limo, as she and Feruza got very cozy indeed.
Draco thought back to the bedroom antics of the previous night and decided to share as little as possible. There were some things that exes did not need to know. “Going quite well, thanks. We had dinner with Hermione and your brother the other weekend, which was more pleasant than expected.”
“Erm, thanks, that’s really nice of you to offer.” Harry didn’t want to break the spell, but it was growing late and he had to leave before he got in too deep. “But I’m not much into music, and I have someone else.” He felt badly when he saw the light go out of Brandon’s eyes. They were such nice eyes, alternating blue and green in the warm glow of the pub, and Harry felt the stirrings of desire in places that had formerly been reserved for Draco alone. What was happening to him? Was he doomed to fall in lust with every attractive man he met?
“Morning Harry. Glad to see you made it home in one piece.”
“Harry.”
Harry exchanged looks with Draco, who did not seem to be much fazed at all by the situation at hand. In fact, he seemed a little bit too into it, for a man who touted himself as gay. Maybe it was the effect of the drug, which was starting to settle over Harry too, like a warm coverlet made of marshmallows. He clutched at Draco’s arm and closed his eyes for a moment to feel the steadiness of his own heartbeat. A beat that was mirrored everywhere he looked, listened, and tasted in the dimly lit den.
Their little moment passed, Draco wanted Harry all to himself. “Well, this has been lovely. Shall we carry on at another time? Maybe over drinks, if Harry doesn’t mind?”
“Oh you were, were you?”
Harry’s mouth was starting to go dry at the thought of what they were about to do. His feelings could only pale in comparison to Draco’s, and yet Draco seemed to be more put together about it than him at the moment. He was moved to a sudden impulse of honesty, and clutched at Draco’s sleeve to pull him aside.
By time Hermione and her contingent returned with Harry’s ear, he had all but drifted off into slumber against Draco’s chest. The ear had to be cleaned first and treated with a series of potions, which they fortunately had on hand (apparently the severing of body parts was not uncommon among Quidditch teams, even the professional ones). Harry was grateful when the moment arrived that his ear could be reattached to his head. The bandage was still on, to hold it in place overnight, and the pain potion was rationed out so he had enough to get him through the following day at least.
“Draco? He don’t usually work Thursdays, but yeh might find him in Farringdon.” When Harry looked at him with puzzlement, the clerk winked. “You know, the sauna?”
When Harry re-emerged with a couple of plates in hand, Draco had relocated himself to the second chair across from the couch, a fresh Felici-Fizz in hand. He waited until Harry had set down the plates before wordlessly holding out both bottles. Harry was clearly hesitant, but politeness won out and he opened them.
Two chapters in one weekend, oh boy! The last chapter was pretty short, so I wanted to end the week with something that has a little more meat on the bone. ;)
“No, but it’s kind of hard to not hear about it. The books are immensely popular.”
Splashing cold water on his face, he jumped in fright when he saw Feruza’s reflection behind him in the mirror. Clad only in a matching set of sparkling black underwear, she was still more intimidating than attractive to Harry, whose head would barely skim the bottoms of her ears.
Harry took a cautious sip, and found nothing to complain about. The cola fruit taste was off-set by a spice, perhaps cinnamon or a touch of nutmeg, and ended with a bitter note.
Clocked in with outer layers shed, Draco returned to the main body of the shop. A few customers were browsing the shelves, and Draco did a double-take when he saw a young man with unruly hair and glasses flipping through the books near the Quidditch display. Was it – could it be – Potter? If so, what was he doing in the place like this?
Ginny seemed to have other plans. Holding out one hand, she flashed them a glimpse of what appeared to be glowing yellow pills in her expensive-looking clutch bag. “What? I know someone,” she responded to their questioning looks. “Haven’t you ever tried Z before?”
“Erm - what is this?”
Draco found the bitter pill of her words hard to swallow, but he knew she was right. Damn, she thought of
Ginny sucked in air with surprise, and Harry knew exactly how she felt, because he felt it too, twisting in his gut. The green flash of light could only mean one thing, and Draco wasn’t even authorized to do magic in public, let alone one of the Unforgivables.
Draco was hungry, but had to concede to Harry’s point, and followed him out to the kitchen. “Where did you learn to cook like that, anyway?”
“I dunno, seems like a few things might have changed tonight.” Harry felt himself blushing a little after he said it, which turned to a lot when Draco stepped closer in to adjust his scarf for him.
Draco did not look as well-slept as Harry felt, which somehow made him look even more alluring, jellybeans notwithstanding. He didn’t seem to mind the kiss that Harry offered, and they spent a pleasant couple of minutes pressed up against each other before Harry remembered. “Bloody hell, what time is it? I have to spell Hermione.”
“All right Hermione. It’s been great, I’m really glad we had this little chat. Catch you next week?”
Harry took the hint and kissed him. He continued with, “Well, the physical connection, for one. We also both had questionable childhoods, if in very different social circumstances, and found relief in going to Hogwarts and playing Quidditch, at least at first. We survived being in close contact with Voldemort, and we ended up resorting to Mugglehood to get away from the spotlight. And we both can cast a fully corporeal Patronus.”
The time was late, but Harry was able to get dressed and start cooking by ten-thirty. He spelled Hermione from the kitchen while Draco was taking a shower, after gingerly removing the gauze bandage from his head.
The space between them was warm and taut, as they sat in Draco’s kitchen and sipped yet another cup together. Harry couldn’t tell if it was a lingering effect of the Felici-Fizz, or if he genuinely thought that Draco was even more striking than usual, with the color whipped into his cheeks by the wind off the lake. His appreciation of Draco’s looks had crept from aesthetic to something more visceral.
“All right, let’s go then.” Draco grabbed Harry’s other hand. “You can Apparate us, right?”
“Nothing. He was fast asleep when I got home, and he had to leave early this morning for a product meeting at George’s. So we’re in the clear, for now.”
He cleared his throat judiciously. “Well, if you must know – and surely you must have heard from the Daily Prophet or some such rubbish – I’m carrying out a magic-free gap year in Muggle immersion, as part of the new Ilvermorny Abroad program. And I work here as part of that agreement.”
“What’s it to you?” was Draco’s response, as he stepped in front of Harry, chin up. The woman was clearly a Witch, or at least not a Muggle, but instead of producing a wand, she raised a camera and asked if she could get a picture of herself with Harry. “Absolutely not,” was Draco’s reply, and he led Harry away while she stood crestfallen among her friends.
“Move along there, move along.” A Mediwizard approached and was chivvying away the cluster of people now surrounding Harry and Draco. “I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but I must ask you to move aside while I check his vitals.”
Draco felt further drawn into Harry’s world and wanted to understand more of the landscape. “If you could completely let go of that identity, rather than just going in temporary hiding like you are now, would you do it?”
Overcome, he dropped to his knees and snatched up Draco’s hand, which had grown deathly cold. “Please, please, oh Godric, please…” He didn’t know what to say, just pressed his lips to that icy hand and willed Draco’s eyes to open again.
“It’s called The Underworld, appropriately enough. You should go, if you haven’t gone; they have some great alternative bands there sometimes.”
Draco thought for a moment, then told Harry about the small creature he’d encountered. “In my dream, I think my Patronus was – a carp.”
Malfoy quickly cut back. “I beg to differ. You and your cronies always seemed to have it figured out, you and that clever Granger, not to mention the godawful Weasley clan.”
“Really happen?” Draco finished. “Yes. Yes, I believe it did. Harry, why didn’t you didn’t tell me how cool your ex-girlfriend is?”
“Not unless you want to look like a sixteenth-century gallant.” Nigel couldn’t seem to resist bantering, and Harry was irritated with it.
The silence between them was tense, and by time Harry finished his milk, he was ready for some action. “Draco, for what it’s worth, here’s what I think.” He began to outline his thoughts while Draco listened, still sipping. It wasn’t until Harry mentioned the Weasley name that Draco showed any sign of disturbance, setting down his mostly empty glass with considerable force on the tray.
It wasn’t his plan to fall asleep on the couch that night, but he did, consequently falling off and waking himself up at an ungodly hour. Heart still racing from the dream that had sent him tumbling, he reached out to turn on a light, then paused. Who was it that had made an appearance in the dream? He had a vague memory of being outdoors, sitting next to a pale someone who was Levitating an object in his hand. Harry’s dream vision focused sharply upon the figure, who transformed before him into a young Draco as he had seen him when they first met at Hogwarts, hand extended as if in friendship. Meeting his eyes, Harry felt something unfamiliar stir to life within his chest. Rather than the usual nightmarish sensation of icy terror, he felt a different terror instead, imbued with warmth and trembling.
Harry looked at him in puzzlement, then gasped as the memories came flooding back. “Oh Godric.” He had forgotten the change of wands that had happened during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor, when Draco was still loyal to the Dark Lord. “That was stupid of me, what was I thinking?”
Whatever she thought was lost in the events that immediately followed. In rapid succession, the stranger raised an outstretched arm toward Ginny, and a squad of security rushed in with the intent to stop whatever unspeakable deed was about to take place. There was a flash of orange light and a rushing sound like the approach of a speeding train, and suddenly half the guards had keeled over on the red carpet, leaving Ginny exposed. Draco had just enough time to flinch back in horror, when he felt Harry break away from him and start running toward Ginny.
He had an impressive collection of chocolates stored in the kitchen cupboard, courtesy of his mother. When they had sufficiently stuffed themselves, Harry asked a question that he had clearly been wanting to ask for a while, but felt too polite to bring up.
?” She stepped in Harry’s direction with a menacing expression on her face. “Was it not enough that we refused to betray you to the Dark Lord, and that you were able to defeat him with the help of my son’s wand? Why must you continue to pursue him with your misguided affections? We don’t need your charity, and Draco certainly doesn’t need your help now, if he ever needed it.” She was a tall woman, and her nose was almost level with Harry’s by time she had finished. “You’ve had your fun, now it’s time for Draco to come home.”
One possible reason for why he looked so put together became apparent when Harry followed him to the end of the street, at a distance so Malfoy wouldn’t notice him. Waiting for Malfoy was another young man who could only be described as – well, Harry’s suspicions were confirmed when Malfoy put away his mobile phone and greeted him with a kiss. He was too far away to hear what was said, but the body language was unmistakable.
“And what is that?”
Harry nodded. “Thanks. I really appreciate that you don’t seem to mind hearing about this.”
Draco took a deep breath and willed himself not to shut down, or pitch a tantrum, because truly he felt it could go either way. “I don’t really care to have this conversation right now, Harry. We have enough on our minds as it is. But, if you must know, my only intention as far as Ginny is concerned is to make up for what a humongous prat I’ve been to her over the years. Especially after what my father did to her in second year.” He stretched out his legs before him and glared at Harry. “As for Nigel, I don’t think he meant anything by it. But I will leave that for you to determine all by yourself. You’re a grown man, I know you can handle it.”
Draco shrugged. “He’s – well, I guess you could call him that. Although I'm not sure friends would shag the way we do.”
“Stop it.“ Harry appeared to have rallied and swiped Draco’s hands away. “I like my ears, especially after losing one.”
“Absolutely not.”
“Where’s Draco and what have you done with him?” Harry muttered after Ginny had disappeared into the ladies changing rooms. He sidled up to his paramour and gave him what he thought was a debonair grin, but Draco took little notice. “I’m just saying, you’re really channeling Nigel right now. Speaking of, where is Nigel? Shouldn’t he be swooping in and giving out his opinion left, right and center?”
“Yes, because I love being talked about like I’m not here,” Draco grumbled. “Besides, I’ve been so out of touch with the Wizarding world for the past year, it’s not like I have much to talk about with you lot.”
This Draco was not neatly dressed or impeccably groomed, but wore a pale grey silk bathrobe and his hair swept sideways at a decidedly rakish angle. The color in his cheeks and lips gave Harry a clue as to what he might have been pursuing moments before, and a wave of crimson heat crashed over Harry as he looked at Draco, stunned into silence.
And yet, there was something comforting in the feel of settling onto a broom and wrapping his arms around Harry. His back was unexpectedly broad, and when Draco turned one ear toward Harry’s spine, he could hear his heart hammering away in a reassuring staccato beat. Draco was very aware of his hands, not knowing where to put them, before landing just below Harry’s waist, resting a hand on either hip. He was suddenly taken over by a feeling of vertigo that had little to do with flying.
Harry reoriented himself so she could see his face, half smothered by fluffy blue terry cloth. “Yeah, I did. I should probably try and work a charm to stop the bleeding though, or at least keep it from getting infected.”
“It’s just – I can’t stand how helpless I feel without him around,” Draco grumbled. “A person should not have that much power over someone else.”
Harry had an idea, based on something he used to do with Ginny, when they were living together and feeling frisky. He wasn’t sure how it would go over with Draco, but Draco had let him put a hand down his pants after all, and he was feeling daring. “Do you trust me?” The question came out more intense than he had intended, and Harry quickly followed up with, “I’d like to try something, if you don’t mind letting me take over the undressing part. It might feel a bit – weird, at first. But I promise it won’t put you in danger or anything.”
Consider the itch well scratched. But he couldn’t help thinking to himself, as he sat in the kitchen with his habitual morning mug of Earl Grey, that there had to be more to life than this. More than living in a well-appointed townhouse paid for by his family’s fortune, surrounded by any form of entertainment he desired. More than working occasional afternoon shifts at a Wizard-owned bookshop that pandered to Muggles, which was part of his contract during his immersion experience. More than visiting with his Muggle therapist twice a week, who somehow seemed to be convinced that their sessions were having an effect.
Draco clapped a hand on his shoulder. “Mate, I would gladly take a dive into being an arsehole with you. Split one and see what happens?”
Draco wasn’t quite sure how it had happened, but he was certain that he could not be imagining that Potter was in his home. After waving a hand in the direction of the door until it locked, Draco let Potter steady him as he removed his shoes at the door and stumbled toward the kitchen at the end of the hallway. “Tea,” he croaked at the kettle, which began to boil instantly. “Care for a cup?”
Draco didn’t have an answer to the question, but Harry’s quizzical look wouldn’t go away, so he made a stab at it. “I don’t really know, Harry. I do rather like it here in London, but it’s a lot harder to get away with magical activity in public. I suppose I will have to go back to the Manor eventually, get things sorted out with my parents.” He put the lid back on the box of chocolates. “I was working on getting their archive of ancient artifacts and documents organized before I moved here. Maybe I’ll finish that project up first.”
“Stop it.” Harry smiled at the innuendo, but he was beginning to feel deeply tired. “I think it turns that way because of my dad. He was an Animagus, you know.”
“Because you said you like this kind of thing! And because I wanted to try something different.”
“Well, tell me then. Or show me.”
Also, I'm sorry to say that this will be the last mostly fluffy chapter for a little while. Buckle up kids, it's going to be a bumpy ride!
He cleared his throat and began to make his case.
“Only on days when I feel under-slept.”
“It’s for Feruza,” she explained. “The silver lace is pretty, but it stands out too much.”
She turned startled eyes upon him. “What did
, Draco thought to himself, with more affection than scorn.
Harry’s jaw tightened, and he stopped looking over at Draco. “Sounds pretty special, I wish my exes would give me expensive jewelry even when they are clearly over me.”
It was Ginny, dressed in a flowing royal blue gown that somehow did not look out of place amidst the robes that everyone else was wearing. Feruza was not far behind, wearing black lace robes shot through with silver, and a sulky expression. The wave of flashes and shouted questions that greeted them was almost as abrasive as it had been a few minutes earlier, and Draco felt a twinge of sympathy for Ginny, who seemed to be bent on grimly soldiering through rather than trying to engage with the crowd.
It was easy enough to Disapparate from the stairwell leading up to his flat, and it wasn’t long before he was deeply immersed in the world of Black Orchid and her quest to take down Ultratech. Being surrounded by strangers and the cheerful colors and chaotic sounds of mayhem at the arcade was just the thing to distract him and lift his spirits.
Harry shook his head and cast his mind about for an alternative. “Maybe the map on the shower curtain?”
The London Eye had just been opened in early 2001, and was still called the Millennium Wheel at that point. I think I covered all my bases, but as usual, correct me if I’m wrong about any historical details. Please don't be shy about leaving comments, as long as they are positive or constructive in nature. I like to know if people are enjoying my work or if there are specific ways I can improve my writing.
Harry is too nosy for his own good and suffers the consequences, although he mostly gets over it by the end of the chapter. Draco goes a bit overboard with the drinking. There is glitter.
She was a little pink now, and possibly tearing up, although Harry couldn’t tell through the blurring of his own vision. Her words were like a much-needed balm upon a newly exposed wound that he didn’t even know he had until very recently.
His voice trailed off as Harry tumbled sideways on the bed to tackle his next experiment with all of the enthusiasm and grace of a spaniel chasing after its quarry. Harry thought he’d have more self-control about it, but once he got started with something new and exciting and after way too many months of no sex, it was hard to stop. Draco had put up with him so far and he was still feeling daring, so he decided he would like to see what Draco tasted like.
Hermione’s reaction was swift and positive. “Oh Harry, that’s wonderful. Is it someone we both know, or is it someone you met in the Muggle world?”
Draco was perplexed, if flattered, by his statement. “Just a thing with me? What do you mean?”
Draco felt a small thrill that the youngest Seeker of the past century trusted him enough to fly his broom, but reality quickly settled in. “Thanks for the offer, but it’d just buck me off if I tried. Part of the immersion terms.”
He could hear her writing something on her notepad, and he suddenly felt doubt about his perception of the whole thing. “Look, my mother at least has made it pretty clear that she loves me and wants me to thrive. It’s just that her idea of thriving doesn’t exactly include serious relationships outside of a certain level of society. I think she’s afraid that I might fall out of touch with them altogether if I go too far astray.”
“Come here, I have something I’d like you to try.” Draco opened the fridge and pulled out a bottled drink that was darker than Felici-Fizz. “It’s from one of Nigel’s many family ventures. Some arrangement they made with South American shamans.”
Ginny chuckled and threw one arm around Harry, who did not look pleased with the way things were going. “Tell you what, why don’t we all get out of here, and you can find out what Z is all about?”
Today’s conversation took a somber turn when Hermione broke the news about a terrorist attack across the pond, in New York City. “It was Muggle-related,” she reassured him, “although that doesn’t really make it any less horrible.”
“You're right, I might be due for a checkup.”
In a surprisingly strong motion, Draco flipped them over to begin a predatory descent upon Harry. Harry closed his eyes and could have wept with anticipation as Draco’s hands drew ever lower. Yet he was unprepared for the shock of warmth and wetness he felt as Draco drew back his pants and took him into his mouth in turn, and he gasped a little, his eyes fluttering open to look down at him. He had received many blowjobs before, but this one had the added benefit of Draco watching his every reaction, his grey eyes partly obscured by a fringe that had developed in the last several minutes.
“Which one? Harry, there are a million haunted pubs and other places in London. I can tell you because I work in a shop that sells books about that very thing. Tourists eat that stuff up.”
“Him,” Harry clarified. “He’s a him.” The ale was making him forget his words a little, and he wondered how high the alcohol content was. Surely one beer wouldn’t affect him that much, would it?
Draco couldn’t say no, not while Harry was looking at him like that, like he’d discovered new treasure.
Not long after the thought had occurred to him, Ron appeared in the living room, with Hermione close behind. “Harry, you’ll never believe what we just learned from the Ministry,” he said. “Draco’s been acquitted. He didn’t cast the Killing Curse.”
“Hi Ginsey.” His pet name for her resurfaced out of habit. He kissed her cheek and could smell the drink on her breath. “What are you having?”
“Do you think you will want to go back to being an Auror?”
When Draco drew away, he wished he could see Harry’s expression better in the darkness, not knowing how his kiss had been received. Before he could ask, Harry’s hand reached around to grasp the back of his head firmly, and Harry’s lips returned, kissing with more fervor than grace. Draco’s surprise came out in an involuntary gasp, and Harry’s hand clutched more tightly, the other still holding his broom in place while he straddled it.
The climb upstairs to the bedroom was torturous. Potter pulled him through it with a steady hand and some encouragement, the tea mug floating behind them. He avoided entering the bedroom but stood at the door and made sure Draco didn’t pass out as he made his way to the bed. “Night Malfoy,” he said at last, raising a hand awkwardly. And with that, he left.
“Draco!” Someone was shaking him, gently but insistently. His eyes snapped open and saw Harry’s face before him, his green eyes still muddy with sleep. “Wake up! You’re having a nightmare.”
Harry brought Draco’s hand to his own lips. “I’m so glad you’re alive.” He couldn’t prevent his mouth from trembling, and held Draco’s hand up to his face rather longer than was necessary before getting himself under control again. “Listen, I know you were acting in self-defense, but.” He had a hard time getting the words out. “Using the Killing Curse against anyone is really serious. As in Azkaban serious.”
She looked at him with something like disappointment. “No. I mean, yes there is something I wanted to discuss, but there’s nothing you
Draco leaned back, smiling. “Ah Harry, that’s where you’re wrong. You see, in the mind of a Malfoy, or any socialite Wizarding family really, appearances are everything.” He ran a hand through his hair and over his mouth in an unconscious reflection of his words before continuing. “It looks a lot worse if they threaten to disown me
Draco permitted himself a smile. “I think the question you really want to ask is, what on Godric’s green earth does Harry see in me?” He glanced quickly at Harry, who was smiling too, in a nervous sort of way. “I don’t want to put words in his mouth, but I think… after the war, and after what happened with my parents and Lord V, we both wanted to make amends. Admittedly in different ways.” He colored a little when he realized that he was about to bring up his sexuality, but there was nothing for it. “I’m gay, you know, and Harry wasn’t fully aware of it until recently.” He crossed his legs the other way while he fumbled for words. “I don’t think I need to point out that Harry is an immensely attractive person, and I just happened to pick up on that fact before he saw me in a similar light.” He quickly backtracked when he saw Hodges’ eyes light up as if presented with something juicy. “Not that I forced myself on him, or anything. Our romance grew quite organically, and privately, as you know. Harry’s privacy is very important to him.”
“Balls?” Draco offered, one corner of his mouth twitching upward.
It did not go unnoticed that Draco had used Hermione’s given name, and Harry decided to propose a toast. “I would like to thank both of you for being open enough to welcome me and Draco into your home tonight. Not that I thought you wouldn’t, but I know it’s a lot to process after our mixed history. I don’t intend to forget what has happened, but I also don’t want the past to spoil the possibility of change. So, here’s to starting a new chapter in the history books.”
Harry didn’t think much of being called Ginny’s “leavings,” but he also wanted Ginny to have the dress if she wanted it. He knew she probably made buckets as a Chaser for the Harpies, and he also knew that Quidditch players had a short shelf life. She might as well make the most of her time with them.
The interruption and Nigel’s abrupt departure made Draco change his mind about dismissing Harry just yet. Seeing him smile, for him alone, was more of a gift than he could have imagined.
“Someday you’ll have to tell me just what it is you like about them. Not today though. Today is my day off, and I think we should take Nigel out for dinner. What do you say?”
It really hit home then for Harry, that Malfoy was not any more a part of the Wizarding world than he was at the moment, possibly even less so. Harry at least had the privilege of carrying his wand and using his broomstick, without the Ministry checking his every move. He couldn’t quite feel sorry for Malfoy, but he did feel more warmth toward him than before, and strengthened his resolve to make a connection with the boy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry did not look any less cornered, so Draco decided to lower the stakes a little. “It doesn’t have to be tonight, of course. We can warm up to it, I have loads of records at my place. We can practice together.” He couldn’t resist reaching around and squeezing Harry’s backside for emphasis. “And no drinking, I promise.”
“Later, Harry,” she cut through his panic. “Right now I just want you to concentrate on getting back inside and finding something to stop the bleeding. A towel or some gauze if you have it.”
“It’s because of the money, isn’t it.” Harry was breathing quickly, and he ran one hand fiercely over his lips as if to wipe away the memory of their last moment of intimacy. “You can’t stand the thought of being cut off, even if it costs you your life. Your soul.”
Draco did not have the same faith in his skills that Harry did, but he was willing to try. They started with the incantation. “You have to say it like you really mean it,” Harry said. “Not that you have to shout it out or anything, although that can help in some situations. I think we’re pretty safe here in your living room, so if you just say it firmly, while holding a happy memory in mind, that should be enough.”
Harry did want, but not there, not then. “Let’s wait a bit,” he said while gently placing a restraining hand on Draco’s collarbone. “Maybe have a bite to eat in the café, once we finish with the exhibit?”
Draco shook out his shirt and tried to calm himself by reflecting further.
“I do.”
“Draco, do you want me to go? I can head home if you’d rather sleep on your own tonight.” Harry began to move the bedclothes aside, but Draco’s hand stopped him.
Harry didn’t know, but he did have a vague memory of there being something off about the attacker’s arrival. “Maybe it had to do with the fact that he wasn’t carrying anything magical, except for that antique cursed gun,” he mused out loud. “They did say he had a history of assault and had been stripped of his wand, hence the Muggle weapon. Although it wasn’t just any Muggle weapon; there was a pretty awful curse laid on it, possibly by a Grindelwald sympathizer back in the day.”
She stared into her glass for a moment. “It’s not so much a question of getting used to it, for me. It’s more about – acceptance. That life in the public eye is going to have its shitty moments, just as it continues to have its marvelous moments.” She smiled. “For me, being on a broom for several hours a day is worth it. At least until recently.” She turned her gaze back on Harry. “What would make it worthwhile for you?”
Draco couldn’t help but smirk a little. “Yes, I imagine meeting Feruza would be a bit of a shock for someone like your Weasley.”
Harry’s eyes flashed wide, and he stood up from the bed, nakedness forgotten. “Merlin’s beard, Draco. All I asked was for some kind of response after the most incredible afternoon I’ve had in a while. It’s not a bloody proposal.” His arms were crossed over his enviable chest – under different circumstances, Draco could have written an ode to the definition carved across every muscle – and Draco sensed that Harry was about to launch into a monologue of his own.
“Thanks for everything,” Harry said as Hermione and Ron waved them off from the doorstep. “It’s been a pleasure,” they responded. Ron’s arm had settled around Hermione, and Draco felt reciprocal comfort when Harry’s arm settled around him in preparation for the jolt of the Portkey. Snow had started to fall, and the moment would have been just right for a kiss if they hadn’t been clutching a dirty old tennis ball between them. Draco decided to make up for it once they returned to London.
Ron brought Harry a sparkling water and encouraged him to make himself at home, before being called away by someone trying to reach him through the Floo upstairs. Hermione was out of sight for the time being, getting started on dinner. Harry took comfort in the familiarity of sitting near Ginny, without reminders of his other, shattered life around him for the time being.
“Is that really all you can think about, bringing honor to the Malfoy name? Are you that much of a manipulative bastard, or are you just miserable about being stuck with a hidebound family who cares more about saving face than about your happiness?”
Harry shifted position under the blanket so that his feet were right up against Draco’s.
Hermione took a deep breath. “Right. Where did it happen?”
Draco saw what she meant when they entered the living room, after depositing their outer layers in the tiny coatroom. One side was arranged neatly in front of the fireplace, with furniture in tasteful tones of earth and beige and a watercolor seascape on the wall above the couch. The other side was a riot of color, largely featuring orange and yellow, and centered upon a table strewn with various Quidditch-related paraphernalia. “Ron’s workspace,” Hermione explained, before raising her voice to inform Ron that their guests had arrived.
Draco was in conversation with a tall Witch whose back was turned to Harry, and had not seen him yet. He took advantage of this fact and slipped furtively into one of the several rooms that led onto the entrance hall, where he was promptly offered a glass of something sparkling. Without thinking to ask whether it contained alcohol, he accepted, and had drunk down half a glass before he felt composed enough to look back in Draco’s direction. This was starting to feel like a bad idea, but Harry stayed with the feeling and tried not to look too much like he was lurking and staring, even though he was most definitely doing both.
Draco had thought the exact same thing to himself, and had probably complained about it to Pansy before. He couldn’t help but warm to her again, despite his own changed feelings about Harry and his friends. “Thanks for coming, Pansy. I know things were – awkward – when we saw each other last.”
Harry swallowed. “Um, because he’s too pretty?” Ginny’s face twitched in disbelief, and Harry backtracked. “I’m sorry, let me rephrase that. I’m not sure if Hermione filled you in, but Draco and I are dating now?”
“Look, Harry, I appreciate that you were willing to step outside of your comfort zone and have a little fun with me. Hell, it was more than a little, you should really consider going gay full-time.“ Harry’s smile curled up briefly, then faded as Draco went on. “But really, who are we trying to fool? I’m not the type to stay committed for long, and you’re not going to want to stay in hiding forever, and I don’t want any kind of publicity that might displease my family. What would be the point of carrying on?”
Draco was awake, if begrudging his wakefulness. “I wouldn’t know, I never learned how to produce one.”
Judging from the expression on his face, Draco was already there.
But really, what was there to reconcile about? The Dark Lord was dead, and the Death Eaters disbanded, and both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds were safe again, or as safe as they could be under the usual proceedings of human trial and error. Getting involved with the Malfoy heir would not change anything for Harry, except perhaps make his existence a little less monotonous while he tried the plumb the depths of Slytherin opacity.
. Fiercely, he pushed them to the back of his mind and leaned toward Brandon, who was growing a little ruddy around the cheeks. If this wasn’t a perfect opportunity to forget about his problems with Draco, he didn’t know what was.
The question stopped Draco’s mind for a moment. “I’m sorry, if I don’t what?”
“Right, that’s settled then. I’m just going to clean myself up a little, and then we’ll be off to dreamland. Together.”
Well, not
Patting him on the back as they separated, she replied, “Well, that makes you one in ten million then.” She sighed loudly as if she’d been holding her breath. “I really hope it works out between you and Draco. Despite what everybody might say.”
Normally, Harry would have wondered what exactly she meant and probed further, but he was too distracted to care. He strode over to the cluster of Witches. “Er, sorry to interrupt, but are we all set for a plan to get Ginny to safety? I’ve just got word from St. Mungo’s that Draco is awake and wants to see me, so…” He waved the coin at them awkwardly.
Draco seemed hesitant, so Harry gently took him under the chin and guided his face back up to kissing level. It wasn’t so different than being with a woman after all, if he ignored the slight rasp of stubble and extra hair, the lack of soft curves, and the brash layer of masculine lust that enveloped the entire experience. But why would he want to ignore any of this, the gift of self-discovery and of finding new inroads of pleasure with someone as beautiful as Draco? “Godric, this feels so good,” he whispered, before kissing him once on the nose and reaching down between Draco’s legs yet again. Draco’s expression was lax, unfocused, clouded by desire, and Harry relished the deep red hue his lips had taken while sucking Harry off.
“Morning,” he yawned when Draco’s face appeared before him. He looked much more awake than Harry felt.
He wasn’t about to share any of those details with her, a fragile Muggle, so he opted for a different take on the truth instead. “I believe they wouldn’t think he’s good enough for me. They had all these big plans for me, you see – I’m their only child after all, and it’s important for them to continue the family bloodline.”
“Absolutely not,” insisted Harry.
Not for the first time, he wondered if the Sorting Hat really knew what it was doing when it divided first-years into their respective Houses.
Draco shook his head at Harry and summoned Mysteria over to fix his makeup. “A little less eyeliner, please. I want the overall effect to be more neutral, otherwise I’m going to have to get rid of the earring.”
(Lee Miller was a woman, by the way, but Harry doesn’t see that in the photo. Perhaps a reflection of how blurry the lines between genders can be).
blind. Curious, he pulled back for a bit and watched Draco as he continued to stroke him up and down at an unhurried pace. Draco’s eyes were closed and his hair was falling across his forehead a little, mouth slightly open as he leaned into Harry’s touch. He closed it as soon as he realized that Harry was watching him, and made an impatient motion with his head. “Come on then, let’s get the rest of these clothes off.”
It was, to Harry’s gratification. His enjoyment of the appetizer plate he ordered was spoiled, however, when he looked up and saw Malfoy approaching with a cluster of good-looking men. Mysteria saw the expression on his face before they saw Malfoy, and twisted around to look in his direction.
Their conversation had reached its natural end, and Harry was growing antsy about Draco. He had forgotten to check the skylight during their conversation, and with the sun nearly gone, he couldn’t see whether Draco was still inside.
“It was probably the person who sent those death threats to you. He shouted something after you and Harry disappeared, something about the balance of the world being disturbed, and started waving the gun around like it was a magical weapon. Claimed it had cursed bullets in it. None of the Wizards around were able to touch him with a hex, he must have had a powerful protection charm in place. Malfoy here, he – “ Feruza paused for breath – “he was either really brave or really stupid. He just stood there calmly while all the spells were being cast around them, and started walking toward him. There was some kind of bright white light that shot out of his hand after he tried talking to the man for a bit, which spooked him into shooting. Malfoy was injured first, but before he fell to the ground, there was a flash of green light and the man was dead.”
“What makes you think that they wouldn’t like to hear about him?”
“Harry, over here!” Draco waved at him, his pale hair fluttering in the breeze.
Slowly, gradually, he swam back to consciousness. Draco removed the blindfold and handed Harry’s glasses back to him. The smirk on his face would have been annoying, except Harry was too blissed out to care. “Godric, that was – I don’t even have words for how fantastic that was.”
Harry regretted their agreement as soon as the com-spell ended, but he didn’t have the heart to cancel. The dream of several nights ago was still lingering at the edge of his consciousness, and he wondered if it was making him more twitchy than usual.
Draco coughed into his breakfast tea. “Excuse me. I hate to throw cold water on your logic, but I can’t say this little development was completely unforeseen. Didn’t Granger tell you that all your friends thought you were gay before you had cottoned on?”
Draco looked a question at him, but seeing Harry’s eagerness to please, and very much wanting to get back to feeling each other up sans clothing, he nodded assent. Harry prodded him into a seated position, sneaking in a kiss or two in the process, then began the first step. It involved wandless magic, in which he had become secretly adept after returning from his walk through the afterlife with Dumbledore, but he hadn’t done it in earnest for a while.
“Poached please, with crumpets.”
The advantage of not having a job gave him plenty of time to clean out his flat and decide what to cook. He could make an excellent
The interview wound down several questions later, and Draco felt a bit lightheaded when they finally rose from their seats and shook Hodges’ hand. He waited until they had left the interviewing chamber before wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulder. He could feel him trembling through his robes, and dropped a subtle kiss to his ear while whispering, “All right there, love?”
Draco pretended to think about it. “I dunno, maybe three months? I’ll have to look at my calendar.”
“Ginny, wait, we have to think this through. Whoever that was, they clearly meant you harm specifically. I doubt they’re going to start shooting random people once they realize that you’re gone.”
“He seemed to accept it by the end. I do have so much fun getting a rise out of him though, it was almost a shame.”
“You and men! You’re so sensitive, and kind, and you do tend to develop deeper friendships with them. Plus I always thought you had a thing for some of the Quidditch players you rolled with back in school. I knew you liked men too, I knew it.” She looked far too pleased with herself, and Harry felt a bit annoyed by it.
The beer tasted wonderful, like coming home, and Harry found himself enveloped in a haze of mild-mannered euphoria as the evening wore on. Brandon was pretty to look at, in a solidly masculine sort of way, and Harry felt more and more curious about whether his attraction to men extended beyond aristocratic Wizards like Draco. Brandon was not a Wizard, as far as he could tell, but was studying abroad in London and had become somewhat of a regular here at The Black Cap.
It turned out that Draco was right. With the copious application of lubrication charms and a reinvigorated hard-on, Harry found himself staring down the barrel of impending release again in no time, especially after Draco began imploring him not to stop. As he jerked forward on his hands and knees, he could feel the rhythm of Draco topping himself off by hand underneath him. He choked out Harry’s name at the climax as if it were a powerful incantation, and Harry came again seconds later.
“But enough about me. You still haven’t answered my question about your Wizarding friends. Besides Nigel. Who I still don’t really understand.”
His worst fears were confirmed when he arrived, pushing any obstructing people aside in his haste. It was Draco, lying flat on his back with a damp stain growing down the front of his robes, subtly darkening their color by a shade or two. His eyes were closed, and one hand was clutching feebly at his side as he gasped for air. Casting around frantically for an explanation, Harry saw that the second body, lying with feet pointed toward Draco’s, was the stranger who had brought the gun. It was a man he didn’t recognize, and he was clearly dead.
“It’s okay, Draco. Just let it out if you need to.”
“Oi, Malfoy!” He turned his head quickly in the direction of his name, startled. It was Ginny, dressed in royal blue, who walked up to him. “Fancy seeing you here, I thought you were banned or something?”
Harry finished gulping and glowered at Draco. “I didn’t know what you wanted. Fine for you to criticize, after all the fancy drinks you’ve foisted upon me.” Belatedly, he realized that he had a milk mustache on his upper lip, and licked it away with a couple swipes of the tongue. The gesture seemed to soften Draco, who started sipping without further comment.
Thank you yet again to Kbrick for sweeping a discerning beta eye over my manic scribblings. :)
Harry laughed with only a slight catch to his breath and turned his attention back on Draco, grinding his hips up toward him until he growled. “What’s wrong with a little Levitating between old friends? I’d much rather be dancing on the edge of the universe with you.” He sucked on Draco’s fingers one by one as they continued their rhythmic movements together, fixing him with a bold python-like stare, and Draco was suddenly much more willing to forgive him for levitating Ginny. Heightened by the knowledge that she was watching, they resumed winding their way slowly up the tower of Eros, until they were poised like skydivers ready to leap into the void of bliss waiting below.
“He and I have been discussing the possible benefits of introducing magical treatments to Muggles. To help with some of the more pressing problems in the medical world, particularly around finding possible cures for diseases that currently are considered incurable.”
“Tell me about Auror training, I can’t seem to get much out of Harry about it,” Draco urged him when the list wound down. “Surely you have some hair-raising stories to tell.” Draco could feel the effects of the Glenfidditch settling about him like a warm cloak, and snuggled a little closer into Harry’s side.
Harry shook his head to clear it. Why was he even thinking this way, when all he had said was hello? It wasn’t as if Draco would suddenly show up at the door, begging to take him back. In fact, he expected quite the opposite, if the opposite meant doing nothing.
“Sorry Marcus, it’ll have to be someone else. I haven’t clocked in yet.”
He tucked a lock of hair pensively behind one ear before continuing. “After I finished out my eighth year at Hogwarts and passed my N.E.W.T.s, she asked me if I would be willing to make a sacrifice for them, so that they, and I, might be able to re-enter Wizarding society again someday without being treated like pariahs. I agreed. It took some string-pulling, and some negotiating with the Ministry after I was acquitted – you remember that trial – but they finally landed on an arrangement with Ilvermorny that might show that the Malfoy family was no longer a menace to Wizarding society. I would carry out a year with no magic outside of my home in London, and complete a course of Muggle Studies to go along with it. My father would continue to remain in voluntary exile. I still don’t know where he is, but that’s the way he wanted it.”
Harry’s choice was much easier: warm milk, his go-to when needing to relax at the end of a trying day. He settled into the chair next to the window while Draco surveyed the tray of juices before him, then turned a tolerant eye back on Harry and his milk. “Gone a bit overboard, have we?”
“Oh come off it, Harry. I was only joking. I assure you that he knows how to be discreet, especially with celebrities like yourself.”
Groggily, Draco looked around the room. Everything looked normal, with the obvious exception of Harry’s presence in his bed. The offending wardrobe stood meekly against one wall, and Draco felt his heartbeat start to slow with relief. He sighed out loud and put his head in his hands, cupping his palms against his closed eyes. “Gah. Too many dreams.”
Harry had sincerely hoped that his days spent before the Wizengamot were over. Nonetheless, he found himself tasked yet again with speaking up for Draco Malfoy, this time in the company of considerably more witnesses. Ginny had been reluctant at first to make an appearance, in light of continued uncertainty around her safety, but Harry was eventually able to talk her around to it, with some help from their mutual friends.
“Yeah, I know. Crazy that it’s survived this long, you have no idea what I got up to at Hogwarts with it.”
The response wouldn't come. Harry, in a gesture of defeat, sat down on the floor in the tiny square of light filtering into the hallway, and put his head in his hands. He stayed there for so long that Draco finally gave in and sat down next to him, leaving a careful gap between them.
“Oi, save some for me.” Harry’s voice was indignant but when Draco looked at him, still munching away, he grinned slyly. “I can’t have you keeping all the sausage for yourself, you know.”
Malfoy hesitated, frowning. “That’s true. I would like to know why you are here. Or why you were even in that bar last night, when you clearly don’t fancy other men.”
to know about him. Personally speaking.”
Harry laughed. “Always full of yourself, Ms. Granger.”
Draco had had many awful days and many wearisome days in his life, but today was turning out to be the most exhausting combination of both. As if getting questioned to within an inch of his life was not enough, he now had to deal with being caught up in a tug of war between his mother and Harry, of all people. He had made up his mind, and yet he felt a flicker of irresolution when he looked too closely at his heart. If he continued to defy his parents, the possibility of being disowned and of losing any possible meaningful connection with them came closer to reality, even if he was their only child. If he turned his back on Harry, he risked rejecting a part of himself that he’d never known he had until Harry had shown it to him. Not to mention Harry himself. And yet… he felt so betrayed, so very
Draco had turned to face him, half seated on the table, with flushed cheeks and heavy-lidded eyes. “What are you babbling about? I’m still stuck on replay of the last several minutes. That – was really – hot.” His eyes widened from grey to silver-blue and his reddened lips lifted into a crooked smile. Harry was compelled to kiss him, as meekly as he was forceful just moments earlier.
Harry shook his head. “Yeah, just because we defeated the Dark Lord doesn’t mean that stupid, violent things don’t keep happening. I half expect Parliament to go up in flames one of these days.”
Speaking of time, Harry was alarmed to see that the afternoon was half over. “Hey, if we’re going to get anywhere with buying shoes, I’m going to need tea soon, I’m famished.”
“I – er, I don’t really know, I was pretty disoriented at the time. See, there was this group of Muggles with a cricket bat -” Judging from the look on her face, he wasn’t making a lot of sense, so he decided to cut to the chase. “I think our best bet is to do a tracing spell, on magic performed within the last hour outside The Black Cap in Camden Town. Maybe the trail could lead us to it.”
“Mmm. Draco. What time is it?”
Harry left his overnight bag with them – who knew how things would turn out? – and used the Floo to arrive at the inner Ministry entrance. Fortunately his access did not seem to have been revoked, and he scrambled out of the fireplace with only a slight wobble to his gait. Using the Floo Network in this way had never agreed with him.
PS – I couldn’t resist dropping in one more tidbit of research. “Afterfeathers” is a term in ornithology, and according to Avian Report.com’s Guide to Bird Feathers: “The primary function of the afterfeather is to enhance insulation. The Ptarmigans exhibit a variation in the length of the afterfeather in their summer and winter plumages. They have longer afterfeathers in the winter plumage and shorter and less complex ones in the summer plumage when insulation is not vital to the bird.” It seemed appropriate, given the cyclical nature of this story and the relationship between Harry and Draco. :)
Harry looked up at him through his eyelashes, then let go. “Nothing, just sorry for being an insensitive idiot. If you want this to stay on the down-low for now, I can handle it. You’re probably right, anyway.”
Harry couldn’t agree fast enough.
Hermione turned back to him, her forehead wrinkled with concern. “I know you don’t want to get Ginny involved, but we don’t have a choice. I’m going to spell her and see if we can’t get one of her private Mediwizards to have a look at you.”
“Yeah, well, you’d be happy to see it now. I still haven’t gone through all my jumpers, scarves and socks from Mrs. Weasley though, I can’t bring myself to get rid of them. Anyway, he likes my cooking, and he doesn’t pressure me to drink. Alcohol, anyhow.”
Hodges seemed mildly interested, and moved on to his next question. “When did you first see Mr. Potter as an ally, and not as your enemy?”
Harry’s hand had crept to the back of his neck, as if to stop the heat there from spreading forward to his face and ears. “Um, yes? A little?”
Inside, the space was vast and glowing, decorated sparingly with fairy lights and snow sculptures. The area for dancing boasted a midnight blue stone floor, which twinkled like the night sky in time to whatever music was playing. Harry covered up his nerves by immediately heading to the bar to get something for Draco, while Draco stayed in place, surveying the magnificent array of people before him. Most of them he did not know, but he thought he recognized a few familiar faces here and there.
The Surrealist exhibit at the Tate Modern opened in October of 2001, and I had quite a bit of fun researching it. The museum website has photos of the works of art mentioned - Dali’s Lobster Phone and Man Ray’s Lee Miller (Neck) - if you want to see what perplexed and captivated Harry so much. :D The NY Times also had a good write-up about the exhibit, for you art nerds out there:
“Enough about me, what about you, Draco?” Harry’s demeanor was much more relaxed after the second Felici-Fizz, and Draco liked it. “Any hair-raising stories about life at Malfoy Manor?”
The silence was so long that Harry wondered if he’d fallen asleep. “I know we were enemies while we were at Hogwarts, but I always wondered what it might be.”
“It’s not that I’m worried about, I’m just not ready to see her.”
“Hiya Draco. Wanna give me a hand?” It was Marcus, the friendly Muggle who was under the mistaken impression that Draco was a person who naturally wanted to help people Do Things. Draco did not oblige.
“Brush it off? Is that what you think I did, after Dumbledore died and my family fell apart?”
“Wait, Malfoy can’t do magic?” Ron seemed confounded at this bit of news, and Draco braced himself for pity. “That’s the best thing I’ve heard all week. Sorry, but it is,” he protested as both Hermione and Harry turned aggrieved expressions upon him. “I don’t see how you can expect me to feel happy about this new development. Not about you liking blokes, Harry,” he hastened to reassure him, “but why did you have to pick
Draco glanced over with lukewarm interest. “I think they were in our year at Hogwarts. Weren’t they in your House, and on your Quidditch team? I can’t remember their names; I think the blond one might have been Irish.”
They did eventually get tea, and Harry received double advice on shoes. Night had fallen by time they parted ways, each party clutching a Harrods bag and Draco’s wallet figuratively lighter than when he had entered. “I still think you should have gotten the Louboutins too, those red soles are all the rage these days,” he told Ginny by way of farewell, after kissing her on both cheeks. “But the Givenchy frock is a classic.”
“Sure, but why would you want to miss out on my fabulous cooking?”
“Do you really mean that?” Potter’s tone was soft, and Draco wondered with sneaking horror if he was pitying him. “Cause I’ve lived in hovels, or pretty near it, and I wouldn’t go back to that for the world, even with magic to help me.”
“Hmm. That’s sweet.” Draco’s eyes had closed again, one cheek nestled into his pillow.
“Wow, they really have you on a tight leash, don’t they.”
Draco couldn’t look at him, not while his heart was steadily crumbling into a million little pieces. “Of course this isn’t what I want, not in this way. But it feels more important to pay attention to what my family wants right now, what little I have left of it. If – “ he couldn’t believe he was saying this but charged forward recklessly anyway, finally looking up at Harry – “if I ever manage to smooth things over with my parents, you’d better believe I’ll be coming back for you.”
Harry was offended. “I’m not a bad cook, I’ll have you know. Just ask Ginny.” He paused, thinking twice. “Or not.”
Several questions later, the Wizengamot was finally ready to take a vote. “All in favor of sentencing Mr. Malfoy to two years in Azkaban for involuntary manslaughter” was met with a healthy showing of hands, but Harry was relieved to see that the next statement – “All in favor of reducing the sentence and reconvening to discuss appropriate steps” – garnered slightly more.
Now that was going too far. “I’m sorry, are you more upset about me treating Ginny? Or about Nigel treating me?” Draco could feel his hackles going up, and he hoped the window between the driver’s side and the body of the limousine was good and thick, because this could get embarrassing.
, Draco thought, but stopped short before saying so to Harry. It had suddenly occurred to him that he might be at an unfair advantage. He did have Nigel to talk to, after all, who had definitely picked up on the not-so-subtle cues of interest building up between him and Harry during the course of the evening. And didn’t Draco also have a therapist, even if she was a Muggle?
Draco looked bored as he flipped through a rack of polo shirts. “Nigel has gone south for the winter. He usually waits until after Christmas, but he decided to leave early this year. Something about a new boyfriend who’s a prince.”
Harry shook his head. “No, no, I’ve worked out a system, trust me.”
Remembering his parents and society’s general expectations for him, his thoughts turned in a more pragmatic direction.
“I’m ready for a drink now. Care to join me?”
“Fine. Let me just finish preparing the sauce, we’re almost ready to eat.”
She strode over to the loveseat and put a gentle hand on Ginny’s arm to wake her up. Ginny looked startled at first, and then her expression melted into one of relief. “Oh thank Godric, it’s you.” She struggled to move Feruza’s lolling head off her shoulder, and the new Auror helped her to stand. “Where do you want me to go, and what should we do about this gown?”
“What is it about Harry that makes you feel better?”
He took a deep breath. “Godric, Ginny, I don’t know. That is, I think I might know, but I haven’t been able to articulate it.” He looked at her with remorse. “I’m so sorry for all of this, and for exposing you to the public eye the way I did when we were still together. You don’t deserve to receive death threats, or threats of any kind.” His voice felt very wobbly, and he sipped at the drink in his hand to steady it, before going on sheepishly. “But to be honest, up until that madman showed up, I was almost enjoying myself, talking to Luna, with Draco at my side.”
“Morning Harry.”
I did an inordinate amount of research on fashion trends from the late nineties and early aughts while writing this chapter. This is the dress that I envisioned Draco picking out for Ginny, minus the hat (no idea what the price was though, or whether it was actually possible to buy it through Harrods): https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ed968135d8098eb24babbd0/master/pass/givenchy-by-julien-macdonald-fall-2001-couture-016.jpg
The end of the conversation was long overdue, as far as Harry was concerned, but he also thought Draco as a drunk was rather irresistible in the moment. “I am not answering that question, Mr. Malfoy. Right now, I just want to enjoy –
Hermione’s eyes were still sparkling, but she nodded and stopped bouncing in her seat. “Go on then, tell me all about it.”
Hermione was sprawled on the ground with her bag tipped over and the contents spilled. She was conscious and unhurt, as far as he could tell, but the horrified expression on her face made it seem as if she had suffered a serious injury. Pinned against the door, which was hanging half off the hinges, was Draco Malfoy, who appeared to be unconscious.
Back out in the world, relieved to be free of the crowds of gawking people and bothersome reporters hounding him for a new angle on the Draco Malfoy story, Harry Apparated home. In a fit of self-disgust, he had a good tidy and managed to get the flat in relatively presentable order by mid-afternoon, before packing himself a small bag to take to Ron’s. They worked out a Portkey in no time, and before Harry could succumb to the temptation to spell Draco – or worse, his mother – he arrived on the front step of the cottage.
“Draco, I can see where you're coming from, it’s just that I can’t help feeling empathy for them. Imagine what it must be like, to find out that your mum or your dad or your brother died in one of those towers. Wouldn’t you want to make the world a bit better for them?”
“Love? Well, sure, but love isn’t everything. Not to them.”
“I’m the new fashion correspondent for the Wizarding edition of Vogue, didn’t you know? Mind if I ask you a few questions?”
She smiled at him. “Well, all right. As long as you’re both on board with it.” She sighed and steepled her hands before continuing. “I think the first thing to consider is, how do you want to frame your change of heart? For example, is Draco coming from a place of curiosity and open-mindedness, after enrolling in a Muggle immersion program? Or is he coming from a place of wanting to make amends, after being so horrible to you for the past ten years? It can be a combination of both, but I think it’s important to delineate each and every point so that there can be no misunderstanding. Otherwise, in the eyes of the general public, he’s just a former Death Eater cozying up to the enemy, so he can save face for his traditionally-minded family.”
“Harry!” Ginny had caught up to him, one hand hovering over her mouth in horror when she saw Draco. “Is he going to be all right?” She dropped down to one knee next to Harry when he didn’t respond, still frozen in shock. “I’m so, so sorry, but I’m going to have to leave you for a moment and find out what happened to Fer. I will be right back, I promise.” She gave him a teary sideways hug before running off again.
, this – this manner of being, I suppose, that gets under my skin. In a good way, or at least I thought so until recently. He makes me want – to be a better person, I guess.” His words felt woefully inadequate. “I feel miserable without him around. Not just because of the sex – although that’s a big part of our relationship – a
As soon as she faded away, Harry remembered Draco.
“Deal.” He held out a hand to Draco, who shook it elegantly, like he was holding something delicate. Harry noticed for the first time that Draco’s eyes were ever so slightly more blue than grey, then chided himself for staring again. “See you – tomorrow?”
Draco closed his eyes again, trying to put a finger on what it was about his parents that made him feel afraid. There was the money, of course, although he was pretty certain that they wouldn’t be able to fully disinherit him, given the lack of immediate family in Britain. There was that one cousin who went to Ilvermorny, but he doubted that his parents would go so far as to pass the Malfoy family fortune on to her.
Harry was a little shell-shocked at his own temerity. Had he really just asked Draco for another night fly, and had his feelings toward his former arch-nemesis changed so rapidly? Apparently yes, and Draco was into it. Harry felt a giddiness settle over him at the prospect of a new adventure with destination unknown.
Draco was touched by Harry’s gesture, but thankful for the change in topic, as he wasn’t anywhere near ready to dig through that basket of snakes. The meal turned out to be delicious again, a ragout served over polenta with a side of asparagus. Draco wondered to himself if Harry knew about the side effects of asparagus, but he needn’t have worried, as Harry pulled out a small bottle of Digester-All potion and two shot glasses. “I take it so I don’t have weird-smelling piss afterward,” he told Draco by way of explanation.
“Oh my Godric,” she breathed, “are you Harry Potter?”
Draco cleared his throat, reminded of the previous night’s conversation with Hermione. “No, I suppose you’re not. Nothing wrong with that, though, we have plenty of other things in common.”
me. I didn’t come all this way just to be thrown out for dragging in some pleb off the street.”
“Don’t bother, I don’t know why I asked. It’s stupid, really, I’ve just gotten so used to not seeing myself, or any reminders of the Wizarding world, I was taken by surprise.” He took a moment to inhale and exhale, slowly. “It’s okay, sorry to trouble you.”
