"Yes it does Harry. We just have to go make it official. I have a few friends that can go around Dumbledore's head for this. Then you will be my son." He spared a small smile for him. This boy had been through so much, and he had no one he could turn to. He was grateful for Draco bringing this to his attention. "Come on. Do you want to leave the glamours off or have me put them back on?"
Harry turned to Snape for reassurance. Upon seeing that he was still there, he turned back to the mind healer. "My parents were killed when I was a baby. I was put in my aunt and uncle's care, if you could call it that. Food was withheld from me from the beginning. My Uncle Vernon started beating me when I was three. He started teaching my cousin Dudley to beat me too. That continued until I was five, when he decided that it wasn't enough. He got a whip and would whip me if I messed up, which I did often. I would be whipped multiple times a day sometimes. I learned quickly that if I made any noise during the punishments that they would get much worse. When I was seven... my uncle raped me." Harry paused, clenching his fists. "All of that continued up until Hogwarts. Towards the end of my first year, I asked... er... begged Dumbledore to let me leave my aunt and uncle's forever. He told me he had to stay there for the greater good, whatever that meant. When I had gone home my uncle somehow knew I had asked for help from someone, and I got beat so much worse than before. He had poured bleach on my back. I got sick, but never got taken to the hospital, because then they would've known. I somehow managed to make it back to the school alive, but I was in bad condition. Madam Pomfrey fixed me up. She doesn't know what actually happened. I had to lie to her. The summer after my second year wasn't much worse than normal, because I left early. My uncle's sister visited, and she had insulted my parents. I accidentally blew her up... I ran because I was afraid of what would happen to me if I stayed." Harry paused, thinking. "I think that is the basics. Oh, most of the whipping was done to my back."
"I don't know Blaise! I just know I'm worried! I'm nearly positive Dumbledore knows about what is going on and he just lets it happen!" Draco's anguished voice cracked on the last word, and it became painfully clear to Blaise that Draco was fighting tears.
The effect of those words was instantaneous. Immediately Pansy stood up straighter, and dragged Harry into a broom closet. "Talk. Now. What is going on with Draco."
"Today we will be making a Mimic Potion. If brewed correctly, the user will repeat everything said for three hours. If brewed incorrectly, the consequences may be.... severe. This is a simple potion, and I expect even the most dimwitted of you all shall be able to brew it properly." Snape's eyes lingered on Harry, Ron, and Neville. "We are going to make this potion in pairs. Potter, you're with Malfoy." Ignoring the strangled protests, he continued on. "Zabini, with Parkinson.Weasley, you're with Bulstrode. Longbottom, with Granger." He then continued to pair up the rest of the class.
Finally stopping, Draco turned to look at the doorway. He looked around for Harry, not seeing him. He then looked closer at the small child in his godfather's arms. "Oh my goodness Harry, what did those horrible people do to you?" He said quietly, in disbelief. He quickly shook his head, clearing it of those thoughts. Harry was safe now, that was what matters. With that, he allowed a smile to grace his face. "Harry!"
"Out of my way everyone. Neville. What was the last ingredient that you put in?" Snape was by Harry's side, checking his pulse.
"I don't have any apples on me this time! See!" He held his hands out. He thought he got away with the lie until Blaise opened his bag.
Everyone else nodded. "We're here to help you, first by confiscating those apples. You can keep one." Blaise stated. Rolling his eyes at Draco's groan, he opened his bag and tossed an apple to everyone. "Hope this apple was worth waiting for, Harry."
Ron, who had been watching Hermione's confusion with an almost amused look, jumped. "Wait, what's going on? Tell us what? You know you can tell us anything mate. We're your friends!"
Hoisting Harry back onto stable ground, Severus took a look at what Harry had grabbed. It was a simple ring, but the engraving on the inside marked it as belonging to James Potter. Harry pocketed it as well. "Dad?" Harry paused for a moment. "Thank you for taking me here. I think I'm ready to go to the graveyard."
Saxton sat down behind his desk, and quickly drained the vial of the contents. Immediately the room began turning black. The room disappeared, and in front of him, a new scenery began to form.
Severus turned to look at Harry briefly, who was kicking his feet absentmindedly. "And what if we can't calm him down quickly?"
Snape nodded. "Follow me to my room, Draco. I don't believe we should have any chance of eavesdroppers in there." He strode quickly, Draco practically running behind him, before stopping abruptly at a portrait. "Lily." A hidden door opened and he slipped inside, making sure Draco got in before shutting the door. "Talk."
Ron stopped for a second, and gave a wary gaze towards Snape. "Don't hurt him. You've been mean to us for years. I don't want my best mate to go through anything like what he did again."
Draco stood in shock. He wasn't entirely sure he heard Blaise correctly. Normally, Blaise was the one to make the plans. He knew his godfather would protect Harry as well as he could, but Harry needed protection outside of potions classes. That was where his plan came in. Harry would never be without either him, Blaise, Pansy, once she was told, or Severus. He would have protection no matter what, in case someone at the school tried to attack. He doubted an attack would happen, but it was best to be prepared. He quickly explained his plan to Blaise, and was met with approval. They wouldn't leave Harry alone with the headmaster either, as he had proven he couldn't be trusted.
Harry nodded, his eyes full of wonder. "My family didn't sign my slip so I wasn't allowed to come. Ron and Hermione told me all about the sweetshop and butterbeer though!" He looked off, not daring to ask. He had been given so much today, he shouldn't want for more.
"Nightmares again? Be careful, Filch was seen in this area a little bit ago." She bid him farewell as he left. She had begun to grow fond of him, as he almost always chatted with her.
Harry asked not quite ready to jump into the topic of Draco straight away. “You have some dirt on your face, you might want to clean it off.”
“None of us do, but seeing Hogwarts now, rebuilt and with happy students, it helps erase some of those bad memories.”
A rustling noise reminded Harry that the roses he had bought were currently being squashed between them. He pulled away and held out the bouquet to Draco.
Draco’s long fingers gripped Harry’s shaft and began to stroke him, slowly slid them up his length, squeezing lightly when he reached the top before slowly sliding back down. Harry pulled Draco towards him, desperate to have more contact, placing his mouth on the slender neck he sucked at the white skin. Draco groaned, Harry felt the rumble from his throat beneath his lips making his cock jump in Draco’s hand. Still sucking at his neck Harry’s fingers fumbled to undo the buttons of Draco’s shirt. Draco froze.
“You mean you are ok with me and Draco?” Harry was astounded, he was sure Ginny would have been as upset as Ron.
Draco smiled sadly. “Bringing up the fun memories won’t work, I’m not doing any magic. I didn’t even want the spell modified but I would have been struck off the wizards roll if I refused.”
Draco took a long swallow of wine. “After the war I was in a really dark place, so dark that it was suffocating, and there were times when I thought about ending it, to make the darkness permanent, at the time it seemed infinitely more preferable than living with the guilt and the horror of what I had done. Music was the only thing that I held on to, it was the only thing that made me keep going, it was the way I climbed out of the black hole I was in.”
Hermione huffed as she moved the papers around to clear a space for Harry’s cup but placed the china container that held sugar packets between the cup and her papers, Harry supposed it was there to act as a dam in case he spilled his coffee.
“You will get coffee stains all over the papers Harry!” Hermione admonished. “These are Ministerial papers, I can’t take them back with coffee stains on them.”
The days until Draco returned moved at a snail’s pace, Harry was becoming more and more disenchanted with being an Auror and it was a struggle just to find the enthusiasm to go to work. Despite the daily calls and messages, and a few late night phone sex sessions, Harry missed Draco more and more every day, it was like an ache, and he was miserable with just about everyone. Hermione had threatened to spike his coffee with a laughing potion unless he pulled himself out of his ‘self-indulgent misery’ and got on with life ‘like a normal person’. The day finally arrived for Draco’s return, Harry didn’t even bother going home, he had brought his bottomless bag to work with everything he needed, and apparated straight to Draco’s apartment as soon as he had finished work for the day.
“Mistress Hermione, a very happy birthday, Master Ron so good to see you! Master Harry, Mistress Hermione and Master Ron are here.”
“If Draco hadn’t have acted so quickly we would have lost you Harry,” Hermione’s eyes were bright with unshed tears.
Harry let out his breath in a ragged gasp as Draco’s hand closed around his throbbing erection, pulled back the foreskin and ran his thumb over the tip smearing pre-come across the engorged head.
, interesting article on the gulping plimplies plague, who knew they only appeared once every fifty years?”
He still wasn’t sure about meeting him on Saturday but he still had time to back out if he decided he didn’t want to go. Harry set the alarm on his muggle phone, another useful feature that he used, with a yawn he extinguished the lights and settled down to sleep with a smile on his lips.
“I just see Malfoy being Malfoy,” Ron said as he reached across to grab more toast. “He’s always been weird.”
After a sleepless night Harry headed to work on Monday morning in a sour mood, even though he knew the argument with Ron was not his guilt to own, to use Luna’s words, he still felt sick to his stomach about how they had left things. The morning passed slowly, after his pigeon fiasco he was now double-checking all his work, which was both laborious and tedious, and by lunchtime he was ready take a break.
He darted from the room on legs that felt like jelly, vowing not to return for at least ten minutes. The last thing he heard as he closed the door behind him was Pansy telling Draco he needed to remove his underwear, and he very nearly fainted.
“Ok, text me when you get home,” Draco said as the cab stopped by the curb. “Another awkward quick hug?”
Draco took a long swallow of wine. “So as the new improved Draco I wanted to reach out to those people that I wronged in the past, not to make amends because I can never change what happened, but to see if I could perhaps build some bridges.”
“Took a quick trip to Malfoy Manor this morning. I still have a fully stocked potions room there.” Draco handed Harry a small vial containing a murky brown sludge. “Yes, it does taste as bad as it looks but it will help.”
Hermione stuck her head around the door. “Dinner’s ready, Nev just arrived, he’s in the dining room with Ron.”
Harry was secretly relieved, the relationship with Draco was still so new he wasn’t ready to take if any further just yet.
“Harry dear!” Molly bustled over and enveloped Harry in a hug. “Are you alright? Ron told us what happened with Rowle, you are lucky to be alive.”
“Of course Master Harry, I have prepared her favourite; turmeric and ginger soup with duckweed cress.” Kreacher saw the look of disgust on Harry’s face. “Master Harry will be served beef stew with dumplings.”
Harry couldn’t judge Draco’s mood from the texts, and he couldn’t think of a really good reason to refuse.
Back at home that evening after Kreacher had removed Harry’s empty dinner tray and left him a glass of wine, Harry reread Draco’s letter. The letter brought forward a sting of painful memories; Draco had been a total twat at school and had made Harry’s life miserable at times, but far beyond schoolboy teasing and pranks were much darker things. Draco had tried to kill Dumbledore and had hurt other people in his attempts, and although he didn’t kill Dumbledore himself he was instrumental in his death. Draco had worked with the Death Eaters, helped them to follow Voldemort’s plans to bring about the destruction of The Ministry and the death of Harry himself. Yet Harry had seen the desperation in Draco when he confronted him in the bathroom, saw him lower his wand rather than strike at Dumbledore, and heard him deny Harry’s presence at Malfoy Manor. The latter actions were those that Harry testified to at the Malfoy’s trials but even when giving that evidence he did not feel any friendship or warmth towards Draco, he was just doing what was right.
"Tonight so happens to be the opposite of when Voldemort returned. I theorize that it may be when his magic is most dormant, and therefore, the Mark may be more susceptible to being altered. Further examination and consultation with others has shown that the Mark reaches into the branded person's magic itself. Destruction of the Mark. Would require destruction of the flesh itself, perhaps destruction of the source of the magic it bound with. "
"Taffy, could you go fetch Miss Granger a cup of tea? The ginger chai from Bombay should do the trick. That's a love." Eyes closed, Draco smirked as he savoured the rich dessert.
(and maybe he yelps), and Potter chuckles and goes to do the other and just stops, just STOPS, and Draco's brain is so confused but his cock is just waiting for the next thing and nothing's happening and then -
And then the straw that broke the camel's back - feeling Potter's magic envelop him in blissful white light, so bright that it became hard to see the tattoo at all, and sinfully good as it thudded into his back and dissipated all down his spine, running down his casting arm and through his fingertips. He was only
, there's only so much sensation that a man can take like this! He was choking back moans every time Harry recast. It didn't help that Blaise was clearly feeling the heat too, also trying to stay professional. And as he kept tattooing, he started to wonder about the emotions behind Potter's Patronus. Was that just friendly love he felt through the Patronus? Or was he starting to feel a trickle of lust, want tamped down hard, some curiosity in how the Patronus would nuzzle him and then fizzle into his skin? He couldn't be sure. But he hoped.
Moments later, Potter drapes himself over the side of Draco, using a leg to pin his two down, leaning on his elbow, hand tracing slowly over his collarbones and flirting at the base of his neck. Draco's hands aren't pinned, per se, but he went to move one and a little shake from Potter's head stilled its movement again. He's panting, exhaling shaky little breaths, and hard as he's ever been, surprisingly close from so little direct stimulation.
Long moments passed, of Draco breathing with conscious effort, slow and measured, not wanting to disturb the snake or her handler. When he realized that the fingers had stopped walking, he realized his eyes were shut, and he opened them. An audience. Of course. Hermione intently studying the snake, now undulating slowly just under the left side of his ribcage. Luna, smiling directly at the snake, disconcertingly close to his nipple. Bill, checking the magic threads, combing through where the snake had unwound hers from the black tangles, trailing emerald green threads herself. Blaise, still smirking in the corner, the bastard.
Not now, brain, not helping! But Potter was still crouched over his lap, holding his arm so carefully, and hissing directly towards his crotch. He wasn't prepared for this. He was prepared for pain, for agony, for tears... but not this. Not Potter, stroking his forearm gently, literally running his fingertips right by the Mark, where everything was hypersensitive and already raw from everything today.
"As I had already said, Draco, the ritual will likely comprise of multiple parts, and that was going to be involved in the third step." He nodded, sagely, definitely paying attention."I just wanted to clarify with you since this is such a complicated procedure." He didn't think anyone bought the excuse.
Draco meeps out a brief hello, then looks away, looks at anything but those eyes before he gets stuck, and finally sees his arm. His arm, which no longer has a dark mark, but instead has beautiful, lush foliage choking out a skull. He stills, and stares. Potter, following his eyes, looks down and mutters out an
And then Harry fucking Potter, of course, backlit by Draco's golden magic (looking sexy as sin), threw his stupid heroic self between the snake and everyone else, hissing right back, gesturing wildly. They went on for minutes, and Hermione crept up on it, wand drawn, until Potter waved her away. One long last hiss from the snake, and it seemingly went back into the skull, and stuck its...
Potter ushered her away, then returned and met his eyes. And Merlin, Draco wasn't feeling quite so sleepy anymore, was he. Internally kicking himself, he tried to slouch back down to his former position as Potter stared at him, mouth moving and sounds occurring but not quite making any sense. And then
catching his breath and holding it for long moments, thighs flexing rhythmically underneath Harry's leg.
, the cord was broken, snake slithered back into the skull, and all of the threads just retracted back into his arm so quickly that he barely realized it happened, until he registered the pain.
Luna suggests that this is likely something best tackled with others who might know more about it. She offers to call in a specialist who might be able to help with the magical theory behind this. Why not, he thinks, it's not like anyone in the wizarding world doesn't know what a disgrace I am. Apparently he says it aloud, because Luna giggles and bounces excitedly and before he knows it, Granger has just flooed in, looking as baffled as he feels. She darts a quick glance at Luna, who just smiles warmly and puts her hand on Granger's arm, then motions at Draco. Flustered, feeling the flush rising fast across his face, he thanks the witch for coming in today. Deep breath. Then an apology, with a
, just for a moment, just enough for Draco to shudder. He's so gone, already. He's not sure how long Potter has been commenting on things, these little mundane observations and thoughts, so at odds with the fires he's experiencing throughout his body. His brain is lulled into a false sense of security, trying to listen to these words that have no real purpose, while his body just aches with increasing desperation. At Potter's next question, some idle curiosity about what Taffy might serve for breakfast, Draco's mouth takes a mind of its own. "
He doesn't tell the others, but he starts experimenting with what he learned. When he tried to cut out the mark the last time, it was as if the flesh surrounding the mark were made of stone - unyielding, knife skittering across the edge of the stone, though blood welled up in its tracks. If he focused on his own magic, he could see the brand in his mind's eye, sinisterly curling into his own at that location. Yet if he tried to tease apart where the Dark Lord's separated, he found himself unable to do so. It danced away from his prying, scattering, splashing even further away from the mark. He stopped that experiment at once, hoping that the dark embers of magic didn't settle into other parts of his body to grow. He tried again, this time with using his wand to nudge dots of tattoo ink into the scar surrounding his mark, and then watched in horror as the snake, so long dormant, hissed once again and slid over to the dot to devour it. His insides quivered and squirmed, uncomfortable yet again with just the sight of the Mark. He wondered if trying it again would just feed the beast.
Potter. He's drowning in a sea of Potter and he's not even trying to stay afloat, just letting him run his hands all over, gently squeezing, manipulating, massaging.
Draco fights down the squirming, though he's sure the blush extends far past his neck at those point. There's no way Potter didn't feel his cock jump with that either, thumping eagerly against his arse. And oh, judging by the way Potter just ground his hips back, he definitely knows.
Sweaty, exhausted, and just plain worn out, they finally stopped to admire their work. The skull was still there, obviously. But bulbs had been planted all around and through it, with the early start of some green already peeking out, roots entangling into the skull. A ring of ferns encircled the skull, though the daffodils would likely spill over soon enough. And it all felt so alive, so fresh - Draco could almost smell the rich dirt and the smell of spring when he focused on it. Blaise seemed oddly satisfied as well. And Potter. Once he finally turned to look at him, their eyes caught, and held.
)  and hisses, the snake quiets down and seems to settle again, and Potter rocks back to sit on his thighs and settle as well. He studies him, from up there, a curious tilt to his head, that messy mop curling over his forehead and obscuring his eyes just a little bit, a tiny smile playing on his lips. Draco goes to touch him and finds that his wrists are still being held, albeit lightly, and he tries to cover up his moan. Potter's eyes blaze, alight with what looks like amusement and lust as he leans down to trace Draco's lips with his own, flicking his tongue against him oh so lightly.
While Potter swanned around being useless, Draco had been put through the ringer by Bill and Hermione. They had been rotating who cast protective charms, and who went digging through the mess of his magic in his arm. The errant black web of the Dark Lord's work still evaded them, and pretty much slapped Bill's hand with an insolent hiss of magic when he finally seemed to be getting somewhere. Bill kept rubbing his arm - the lash was pretty raised.
"Hey, umm, Bill, she's just pissed because we are tugging on her body and she didn't know why, but she's calmer now and if you could just cut that bit around her tail? I don't think she actually wants to hurt us."
Lips locked, Draco's squeal is swallowed by Harry as he arches his back and comes, messily, liberal amounts smearing between them both, hearing nothing but white noise and the loud sound of his heartbeat trying to thump through his chest. As his senses come back to him, he sees Harry sprawled next to him, limp and languid, also trying to catch his breath.
? And here he thought the Golden Boy would be a prude! Be still, his heart, pounding away wildly in his chest. Wait, does those mean the girl Weasel was kinky? Obliviate that thought right this second.
Even Neville Longlegs or whatever, the boy who actually turned into quite a decent looking man, even wrote him the other day, writing about types of inks made from less common species, possibly even imbuing their own powers. A galleon that Luna probably mentioned his predicament to Longbottom.
No, the biggest shock was answering the door and expecting to be greeted by the no-nonsense Ms. Granger, and seeing those damned bright green eyes once again.
So despite the books prickling his fingers as he turns the pages, or his most recent mishap of ink squirting out of a particularly enthusiastic book, he finds himself looking for ways to add to his mark, not remove it. It feels like reclaiming his past. It feels like redemption. The artwork needs to be strong and dark enough on its own to battle the traces of dark magic still in it. It needs to be passionate magic, enough to best the rabid dedication of Voldemort's followers and the power they lent the Mark. And yet... He wants it to be beautiful, something that looks like hope, and peace, and maybe even happiness. He has no idea what that looks like. He spends so much of his self-imposed isolation (now it's by choice, so it's
It doesn't take long for his brain to be fully revved on, and Draco distantly admires the full, luscious bubble butt right next to him while also panicking internally. Thankfully all his clothes still appear to be on, though Potter seems to have abandoned his trousers halfway across the room, and only one sock is visible, chucked over the rung of a chair. His left forearm tingles faintly and he rubs it absent-mindedly, just as Potter stretches, yawns, and rolls right over. Blinks. Opens his eyes.
But the biggest shock wasn't Longbottom's note, out of the blue. And, it wasn't Hermione running late after she messaged urgently by falcon,
Malfoy, I'm bringing company to help with this, but I'll be there in 30 minutes. We've got to do this tonight - exactly 6 months from the anniversary of when you know who was raised again."
"Draco. Really. Fuck you're hot like this, you're killing me, but I just need to know. Yes? Too tired to tell? It's really okay, I'll just need a few minutes."
Draco is pleased to note that Harry's a very good listener when motivated. Harry's biceps feel even better than anticipated, and he's
Long, slow, sibilant sounds emerged from Potter's mouth, and the snake revealed itself (herself? Himself? How do you sex a tattoo snake?! Does she even care about gender? She's definitely a she). And as Draco tried to will his body to calm itself, she wound her way up Draco's arm, the very image of her looking more and more real. He could
, Potter befriended the scaly beast. Oh, Circe's tits, what was happening with the day. Bill cast a sharp
She started casting again, visualizing the magic again, elevating what she could. Slowly, thin golden strands of Draco's magic were raised out of his arm and into the air, looking like harp strings, but with tangled curls of matte black clumped down below, rooted into the Mark. As Bill used his wand to slowly tease out the clumps from each other, casting tiny severing charms here and there, it started to do finally look like two distinct masses of black, rather than the initial jumble. Dark strands fell away as he delicately peeled them out of cords of gold. But then, the snake of the Mark started unfurling. They were so engrossed in the weave of the magic that they didn't see, but Draco started to shake.
"Alright Draco, I think we've got a new idea that might really help us out with this. Just hang tight for a second - Bill is going to see if he can pull the two apart, and it might twinge a little. I'm sorry. You'll need to just hold still, maybe help hold up your magic while Bill works on the rest."
The last one (hopefully! And only 5 years after the end of his world as he knew it), sits perched half on top of her recliner's arm, with one leg dangling over the side. Today, she's wearing earrings that appear to be disco balls, and sunglasses that walk the line between high fashion and absolutely ridiculous. Of course, it's none other than Luna. He had his reservations about going to her, especially since she was directly involved with the whole thing, but she assured him that she was impartial as a Jupiter Rabbit, and could look through her mirror collection for more clarity if needed. Whatever that meant. And it seemed to be working, maybe because he had no worries about her judging (because really, who is she to judge how messed up someone is?), and he, strangely enough, just trusted her to have his best interest at heart. She was surprisingly insightful, though sometimes he wondered if it was him reading deeper thoughts into her statements.
. He picks up Draco like he's weightless, and Draco buries his face into Harry's neck, his collarbones, where his very ugly but very soft t-shirt dips a little too low with years of wear. But it's so good, it's all so good, Draco feels like he's floating and loved and cared for and his brain is absolute mush.
Exactly ten minutes later, Hermione was back in front of the recliner, Draco lazily blinking in her direction.
It's not a surprise to anyone who knows him, but he LOATHES the Dark Mark. He hates needles - so violating and invasive; he hates their permanency - a mark of who you were in the past, never able to erase it; he hates the attention - how people's eyes flicker to that immediately, and assume they know all about his life.
her scales sliding along his arm, raising goosebumps in their wake. The dry flicker of her tongue, delicate yet intense, along his bicep.  Draco was frozen. He couldn't move a muscle; just felt her sinuous (and sensual?! Oh no) glide along his shoulder now, oh Merlin, and now along the side of his neck. Harry must have looked up and seen Draco's eyes, for he let loose a soft chuckle, then beckoned to her again, walking his fingers down over his naked collarbones, down his side. When the fuck did he lose his shirt?! He's shirtless and getting aroused by a snake and
And then oh, this must be real, because Potter rucks up his shirt and nips at his right nipple and it
"Alright, so, we'll have to negotiate properly later, but how do you feel about edging for a bit?" Draco nods eagerly, head spinning with the implications. Edging?
At apparently 5:23am, Draco wakes up with a start, feeling awfully like he was hungover, but a little different. He goes to reach for his wand on his nightstand and hits a wall of flesh instead.
, did I fall asleep on you?!" Flustered and embarrassed, Draco makes as if to get off the bed and leave in horror, forgetting that his arm is still being held by one very handsome, and apparently entertained, Harry Potter.
Instead, he gets pulled down onto the bed, warm lips descending on his. So soft, so plush, so warm, the rich feel of Potter's magic rippling down through his arm and all around him, flooding his senses. Everything he breathes feels like Potter, smells like Potter,
"So. Here's the deal. You were awfully cute all snuggled up, passed out in bed, but I had a wicked pair of blue balls to work through before I fell asleep. Didn't want to jerk off in your bed without you being conscious, that just seems rude. So. I think turnabout is fair play here." He sits up straight, eyes sharpening. "I propose a little game here. I've been wound up all night. You, not so much. Are you familiar with edging?"
Potter gives his lips a bit of respite but wreaks havoc on his senses as he moves down his jawline, giving a little nip to his earlobe, breathing out a "
Having dragged down Potter in a heap of limbs and residual magics (He can feel Harry's magic IN him, in his arm but slowly pulsating throughout his body), he wonders if he's died and gone to heaven.
Draco's arm ached, though more muscle pain than anything else, maybe from clenching his fist so tightly. Come to think of it, his jaw hurt a good bit too. Maybe he's just clenching everything right now. Before he could assess further, he heard Bill mutter under his breath, and call Hermione over. Something about needing to separate the skull and the snake, untethering the two and seeing where that went. Draco wished he could go over and see what Hermione was now diagramming, but he was really just exhausted at this point. Not like they wouldn't be coming back in just a moment to torture him some more.
“Not me Master Harry, it was Master Draco. It was to be a surprise but now you have spoiled it.” The elf’s ears dropped down over his shoulders in despair. “Master Harry was supposed to see the tree when it was finished not before.”
Draco gave Harry the middle finger salute. “Seriously, could you imagine me being married to Daphne? She was as dumb as a bag of rocks, and she doesn’t have a cock. It was not a good match.”
Hermione stepped forward and held out a small silver muggle coin to Kreacher. “A thank you gift for dinner Kreacher.”
“But you get all those girls squealing at you,” Harry poked Draco playfully in the ribs, “that must be nice.”
“Just let it go Potter.” Draco’s voice was hoarse with emotion. “You can’t help me.” He dropped his head onto his knees. “No one can help me.”
“What the fuck,” Draco sniffed as the closing credits rolled, “that was not a movie for kids. That was the saddest thing I’ve ever watched.”
“Professor Crane is retiring too.” Crane was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor that had taken the position after Snape’s death. “Minerva is having a hard time finding a replacement.”
Harry’s mind was racing trying to find a solution, he came up blank but if he could talk to Dumbledore he was sure they could come up with a plan to save all of them.
Draco gave a rueful smile. “Oh but it is, it was always about you. You know what is on my arm don’t you?”
“Neither I or my mother were exactly welcome in the wizard community nor were we able to use magic. I started going out to Muggle music concerts, met my bandmates and I decided it was best for me to just leave the wizarding world behind.”
Harry guided Hermione to her chair and gave her a bunch of paper napkins, she mopped her eyes and took a large gulp of her coffee.
Malfoy was dressed in all black, covered by a black formal robe and his hair pulled back into a neat ponytail; he looked so much like his father that Harry did a double take. Draco held his back straight, head high and eyes forward but Harry could see that this was not out of arrogance or pride, this was the stance of someone just trying to keep himself walking without breaking down. Malfoy passed within feet of Harry but either did not see him or chose not to acknowledge him, and carried on walking towards the elevators. As he passed by the crowd began talking in excited and shocked whispers.
“I just can’t relate to their lyrics,” Draco said one morning, as they lay entwined in bed. “If I can’t relate to the lyrics I can’t sing them, really
“I’m sorry. I wish people could see how much you’ve changed. You are so different now, like you reinvented yourself.”
“This is a song I wrote about a friend of mine who is here tonight,” Draco glanced over to the spot where Pansy and Harry were standing. “It’s called ‘My Heart Is Green’.
Malfoy smiled sadly. “Not far enough Luna, but I’m working on it.” He turned back to Harry and held out his hand. “It really is good to see you Harry.”
What did Muggles wear to a rock concert? Harry had no idea so he called Dudley who now ran a successful plumbing business, and had in fact replaced all the plumbing at Grimmauld Place. After laughing, not unkindly, for a good five minutes Dudley suggested black jeans, t-shirt and a leather jacket. Harry had rifled through his wardrobe finally settling on an old faded pair of black jeans with tears in both knees, a plain black t-shirt, and a lightweight black hoodie in lieu of a leather jacket. After unsuccessfully trying to tame his hair in to some kind of style Harry shouted a goodbye to Kreacher and set out to meet Hermione, Ron and Luna at Alexandra Palace.
“Kreacher? Where did you get a Christmas tree from?” Harry asked his elf who was directing the house elves, telling them where to drape the garlands and which baubles to hang from which branch.
“No!” Draco snatched his hands away and shot up off the sofa. “For fucks sake Harry don’t you get it? I can’t do any of those things, I can’t do anything but play my part, do what I’ve been asked to do.”
Harry reversed the spell with a big grin on his face. “Remember when I hit you with that spell at Dueling Club in second year?”
Draco gave a wry smile. “That’s probably a discussion for another time. How’s Ginny, what is she doing now?”
The energy in the room was electric, the fans were jumping, screaming, dancing and singing whilst the band provided the sound of soaring guitars and the pounding drums driving the beat to which the crowd reacted. And, in the middle of it all, was Malfoy. He was leading the performance by running across the stage stopping to play guitar to sections of fans who screamed and yelled at the blonde whilst he shredded the tunes in front of them. Running back to the mic in the middle of the stage, Malfoy sang the tracks with thousands of voice shouting the lyrics along with him. It was incredible. Harry was mesmerized by the sight and sound of Malfoy; the sheer energy as he ran around the stage, the rapport he had with the crowd, the way he slung his guitar around, the way his voice could scream out a rock song but could also softly croon a slow song. Luna was out of her seat swaying dreamily along to the music, she pulled Harry up to join her and soon Harry was clapping and cheering with the rest of the crowd. By the end of the set Hermione and even Ron were on their feet clapping the performance as the band waved and the stage lights flicked off leaving the stage in total darkness. Harry thought it was over but the crowd began to chant ‘Draco, Draco, Draco’ over and over again, several minutes went by and by now the crowd were in a frenzy of chanting and stamping their feet. A single spot light flicked on and the crowd fell quiet as Malfoy stepped forward into the light; he was still drenched in sweat but his hair looked as though he had combed it as it fell in sleek waves over his shoulders and his habitually white skin was tinged pink with the energy he had exerted throughout the show. The band behind him, still in complete darkness, began to play but this time the drums were soft and muted and the guitars acoustic. When Malfoy started to sing it sent shivers down Harry’s spine; the quality of Malfoy’s voice was exquisite as he sang about love and hopelessness, of passions and tears with an anguish that pulled at Harry’s soul. Never in his life had he seen anything so beautiful as Malfoy standing on a darkened stage, lit by a single spot light, eyes closed, hands clasped around the microphone stand, singing a song about lost love and loneliness. The song ended and the stage exploded into life as the stage lights went up and the band launched in to their final song back to electric guitars and thumping drums. The song contained the lyrics which the crowd had been chanting before the show and as Malfoy sang the words ‘Lumos Solem, Lumos Solem, in the dark we find the light’ the crowd used the lights on their phone to hold up towards the stage. The effect was amazing, a sea of lights across the venue waving and bobbing as Malfoy held up his guitar to strum the final chord that brought the show to a close. The house lights came up and the buzz of excited chatter from the audience filled the space that the music had previously occupied.
“How completely bizarre,” Hermione muttered, “I should report it to The Ministry, might be a wizard gone rouge and trying to expose the wizarding world. That would be a massive cleanup job for the Obliviators.”
The crowd cheered and suddenly there was Malfoy. He was wearing a dark grey shirt, partially unbuttoned as usual, skintight black jeans and dragon scale black boots. With only the tiny white bulbs backlighting him he look ethereal, he raised his arms and bowed his head, blond hair covering his face. The whole crowd raised their arms in salute and as Malfoy screamed the words to the opening song into the microphone the entire place erupted.
“Hi Harry,” Luna continued to peer under the rug, “I thought I saw a Nargle hiding under here and I don’t want it to steal my shoes again.”
Hermione was perched on the edge of the sofa, sitting on her hands and it seemed like she was quivering.
Harry finished his glass of wine and made a decision, he poured another glass and pulled his muggle mobile phone from his backpack. Like his laptop Harry had bought the phone to keep in touch with Dudley but the muggle phone network was becoming more common in the wizarding world, it was quicker and more convenient than sending an owl. Harry opened up the phone, saved Draco’s information in his contact list, then switched to the text message function and typed a message.
The week passed slowly; Harry was becoming more disillusioned with being an Auror with each passing day, far from the exciting vision he had of secret missions and daring raids most of his time was spent tracking owls, reviewing tracing spell data and writing dreary reports. It wasn’t that he hated it, he just didn’t love it the way he thought he would. In complete contrast Hermione was in her element with her job in The Department of Mysteries, and Harry wouldn’t be surprised if she ended up as Minister for Magic, she was cut out for the politics and bureaucracy of the Ministry but Harry wasn’t. The only things that Harry looked forward to on a daily basis were his messages and calls from Draco. Their schedules were somewhat offset, Harry worked a day shift whereas Draco’s day tended to start at four in the afternoon but they managed to find the time to talk on the phone every night and sent messages constantly through the day. Draco was due back home the following Friday and Harry couldn’t wait to see him. Harry had not yet broached the topic of his relationship with Draco with Hermione or Ron, he was not sure how they would react, Ron in particular, so he had said nothing but felt a coward for not being honest with them. As Neville had suggested Harry had asked Luna if he could book a session with her at her mind-healing clinic, and whilst she had initially declined, as Harry was a friend, she finally agreed when Harry said he needed her advice as a friend. She refused to see him at the clinic and was coming over to Grimmauld Place that evening for a late dinner to talk and advise him as ‘a friend not a client’.
“It’s nothing awful, just come on.” Harry dragged Draco by the hand leading him along the path towards the terrace.
“Then he’s a lucky boy,” She said with a wink. “I hope he enjoys them, they should last about a week if you take care of them.”
“It’s a metal detector, to check that people aren’t carrying knives or something.” Hermione replied.
Harry gave a small nod and placed a soft kiss on Draco’s lips. Draco let out a low moan as Harry trailed a hand across his chest. Harry was enthralled by the softness of his skin it was like silk, totally smooth and hairless, he then walked his fingers down his stomach following the thin line of fine white hairs that led down under the waistband of Draco’s trousers. The bulge concealed beneath the fabric jumped when Harry popped the button and pulled down the zip, and as he pulled the material away he could see a wet patch on the underpants where some pre-come had leaked out. Harry pulled both trousers and underwear down over Draco’s hips revealing his hard manhood jutting from a thatch of platinum blonde hairs. Harry had never seen or touched another man’s erect penis before and he hesitated slightly, Draco seemed to sense his nervousness and resumed his stroking of Harry’s hard dick. That was all the encouragement Harry needed, he wrapped his hand around Draco’s rigid member and began to stroke him in time with Draco’s movements on his own cock. The blonde’s cock was slightly longer than Harry own dick so he adjusted his stroke to accommodate the additional inch.  Draco gripped Harry harder than he would when he wanked himself but with a slower stroke, the combination was one he found he liked and he moaned as Draco completed another languid stroke. Draco leaned in and smashed his lips against Harry’s; the kiss was passionate, fierce, hungry. Draco increased the pace of his strokes, Harry followed suit knowing neither would not last long now before they came.
"Yes, Neville says he's done a bit of research, and we're going to delve further into the mystery of my silent roses." Her voice is even, but Harry can see a glimmer of excitement in her eyes.
In the next second, Potter apparates them to what he assumes is Potter’s bedroom, but he can’t look around to confirm. Not while Potter is pressing his hands against Draco’s chest and is doing a magnificent job of peeling Draco out of his suit, piece by piece. His only assist is to kick off his shoes because Potter has Draco otherwise occupied with panting roughly into his shoulder. Soon the five-thousand pound Huntsman is scattered across Potter’s floor and Draco can’t be arsed to care.
"I had to pretend," Draco replied coolly. "His whole purpose was to draw you out, and I had to stay alive long enough for you to show up. If I hadn't, he might've killed me just to spite you." Draco's lips turned south. "It was never about me, anyway. He didn't want me anymore than you do. It was about getting to you. Which he did. You showed up as expected."
"Come in here before you wear a hole in the carpet," Narcissa's voice calls out from the cracked door of her room, chiding but gentle.
“Bullshit. You don’t get to do this,” she warned. “You don’t get to push us away, and then when we leave you in peace, get pissy because we don’t come begging for your attention. You didn’t want to be part of this family anymore, so we let you go. And it nearly broke us all. But Draco needs family now, and Molly has things that he needs to hear. The fact that you’re along for the ride is par for the course.”
Harry follows her line of sight to see Neville and Narcissa standing close to the hors d'oeuvres, chatting.
He turns and sits cross-legged on the grass, facing her. "Do you transplant your cuttings from here to the garden by magic or by hand?"
Draco looks surprised at that and slips out of the shirt with much less fanfare. He walks to the other end of the sofa, folds the shirt and places it on the cushion. He divests himself of his shoes, placing them neatly on the floor, tucking his socks inside.
“Of course,” Hermione said smoothly. “It says something that he retained his magical abilities after his Turning. I don’t think that’s happened in what,” her glance flicked to Silvestri, “eight hundred years?”
The point of a pearl-white fang peeked out as Potter's bottom lip rolled between his teeth. A tiny drop of blood welled there and he licked it away without thought. Draco's hard cock twitched under Potter's unwavering gaze, and the thought that Potter liked what he saw was a satisfying stroke to his ego. Potter's hand curled at his side and his eyes snapped up to Draco's face.
Potter shook his head firmly. "No. It doesn't erase anything, and I don't expect you to just forget the way I treated you. I have good days and bad days. More good days now than anything. But I want you in my life, Draco. Every day, present, real. Not owl post every other day."
Too eager. That should have been his first clue. A true sub would have made Harry work for his submission, to prove himself worthy of such a gift. He snapped his fingers and Owen jumped. Too easy.
"What was I supposed to do?" Ron throws exasperated hands into the air. "I mean, you tell us you'll owl, and we don't hear from you, you're not at home, you don't have an office anymore—Circe's tits, man, you practically disappear, and I find out you're here, of all places!" His eyes go soft around the edges, and Harry sees the long-time friend lurking beneath. "Christ," he mutters, "I thought something had honestly happened to you. I wasn't going to stand for it. You should know that by now."
Harry's eyes flick down to Draco's chest and he inhales sharply before meeting Draco's gaze again. "Think about what I said. I mean it, I won't chase you. The choice has always been yours." He steps back and retrieves the dressing gown from the floor. "And Draco, when I mark you again, it will be because you want me to."
Draco turned, and the wan expression on his face faltered into a resigned smile at the corner of his lips. "I used to think so."
Hermione's eyes narrowed through the connection. "Did you really expect him to? I know things have been strained between you. He's not been acting the same."
"First you make me wait, and then you subject me to terrible aphorisms?" Draco clucks. "I cannot abide such treatment."
Because that's what he is. A freak, an anomaly. Something that doesn't exist in the wholesome. Something dirty that feeds in the perverse dark.
Potter’s finger was dexterous, moving slowly back and forth until a second could be added. The pressure at his neck lessened as Potter slid another finger inside, scissoring them in a delicious stretch. The vampire’s cock pressed at his groin, rubbing in short stabs that mimicked the movement of his fingers. Nonsensical sounds tumbled from Draco’s lips, a chant of gasps, hisses, and broken pleas as Potter’s fingers pumped in and out of his arse with focused precision.
"Wonderful." She glides forward to Harry and presses her hands to his forearms, sliding them slowly upward over his shirtsleeves. Misinterpreted, it would be a lover's caress, but her under hands all Harry feels is gentle strength and reassurance. It's a mother's touch through and through, as old and eternal as time itself. Her hands rest at his shoulders and she assesses him with that same motherly gaze, like she's taking stock of his health. She pulls him softly toward her and Harry goes without hesitation. He eases into her embrace and winds his arms around her slight frame.
Harry doesn't say anything, but keeps his smile in place. It's only a second or two before Draco sighs and shakes his head.
Traces of the old Hermione ventured forth as she tsked him. “Honestly, didn’t we take the same classes at Hogwarts?” His eyes snapped up to her at the chiding comment. “A Consort means you are magically bound to this person, that you may only feed from them, and them alone. You will cohabitate, as the bond necessitates proximity. Basically, you’ll be married in the eyes of the law, and the only one you can legally feed from is your Consort.”
“Don’t worry, Potter, I won’t be trying off you with sunlight.” Draco gestured with a finger between them. “This is supposed to be a mutually beneficial arrangement. I have no plans to kill you now or in the near future.”
He's planning on spending the better part of the day in the studio again, but there's something about the soft, earnest quality in Draco's eyes and his gentle awkwardness that has Harry wanting to put him at ease. And frankly, the thought of spending an uninterrupted hour or two in Draco's presence just
Narcissa lets out a hoot of laughter, and the unexpected sound is warm the air. "Darling, it's not your virtue I'm concerned with. If you're not careful, Harry here will steal your heart."
Her eyes shine, dangerously close to something liquid, and before he knows it, her hand is now cradling his cheek. "Such a fine young man you've turned into, Harry. Your mother would be so proud." The way she says it, it's almost a whisper in the air, a sort of hushed declaration that hooks into his chest and
It's volatile, unstable and terrifying, this feeling that's coursing through her. An onslaught of sensory input that she's not equipped to handle at the moment. Maybe she never has been, because no man has ever kissed her like this. Not even Lucius in his most passionate moments, which were few and far between and rarely ever meant for her specifically.
"Merlin, you're so shortsighted, you can't even see what's happening to him," Snape came around to the forefront of the portrait, flinging his arms in vexation. "Look at him!" he gritted through clenched teeth. "He's about to reach his breaking point, and when he breaks, he will run. He will not look back. Because that's what Draco does. He runs. If there's one thing Lucius Malfoy managed to beat into the boy, it's self-preservation. The need to save face at all costs."
"No, he hasn't," she said, shaking her head. "He's been relaxed, affable. He smiles, he's sweet, funny and affectionate. Underneath all that ice and poise, he's a different man. Surely you've seen a glimpse of it?"
Draco's eyes are still firmly fixed on his half-empty plate, and that attractive blush is creeping into his cheeks again. Harry's not sure if it's from the scrutiny he's giving Draco, or more the fact that Draco doesn't like to be talked about as if he's not even in the room.
"Don't be impertinent." He leaned forward, as if he were real once again, but stopped at Draco's wide smile.
Draco backs off and pads to the door across the room without question. There wasn't a cabinet in there before, but now that Harry wants one, he knows it'll be there. The Manor has been particularly on point with his wishes thus far.
Harry turns back to Draco, who is smiling like this is the best thing he's ever seen. "Would you mind?" he says, jerking his head to the door.
die before it could grace the open air, not ready to admit to emotions that he didn't understand himself. "Who was that?" he asked quickly, hoping it would cover his pause.
The guard outside Potter’s cell gave him a derisive once over before stepping aside. Draco ignored the slight and went in without hesitation.
He can see the moment it clicks into place for Ron, because his eyes grow wide and terrified, and his mouth falls open on a gasp. "Merlin, she's going to kill me, isn't she?"
"Well, here we are," Narcissa says, a little breathless. She exhales softly, partly to steady herself from the chill, and partly to steady herself in general. For some reason, Neville Longbottom has her spinning off-kilter. "Care to take a closer look?"
Lucius turned to look at Snape with an amused yet worried smile. "Are you sure he's actually thirteen? He's so small, and he definitely does not look thirteen. He barely would pass for eight, and even eight is a stretch."
I'm gonna be honest. I was never expecting people to like this. I was just writing for something to do. It makes me so happy to have people enjoy this. Thank you for reading!!
"C'mon Harry. Let's get you back to your common room." He stood up and held out his hand to help Harry up. He had noticed Harry was acting a bit different then normal, like he was younger. Harry took his hand and stood up, but didn't let go. Draco didn't mind. The duo quietly left the kitchen, slowly walking to the Fat Lady's portrait. When they arrived, Harry said the password and climbed inside the hole.
Panting, Harry woke up, doused in sweat. His back was on fire, and he wasn't entirely sure that the gashes weren't bleeding. He stood up and grabbed his invisibility cloak, intending on walking until he didn't think about it anymore. He snuck out of the dorm and walked out the door. The Fat Lady was familiar with his nighttime wanderings.
Snape led Harry into the room, sitting him down in a comfy chair in front of the man. "My name is Severus Snape, and this is Harry Snape. I just adopted him today. He was from an abusive household and we want to assess the mental damage done." Snape continued standing.
"Harry, you shall never be going back to that house. I promise. I have an idea to keep you from going back, but only if you're comfortable with it." He waited for Harry's nod before continuing. "Harry, I want to adopt you."
"I cannot believe you! I'm not going to stand for this. You're supposed to be the leader of the light, but you are worse than the Dark Lord! Since it has been made apparent that you cannot be trusted, I will be taking matters into my own hands. But first, how long have you known. How long have you known that this boy has been treated that way?"
Harry and Severus carefully made their way into the building, Severus going first to ensure nothing would collapse on them. As soon as Harry touched the door however, a sign appeared, stating the house stays where it was to show the sacrifice made by Lily and James Potter. Harry peered closer, and noticed all sorts of writing on it, full of support for him. His emerald eyes began to fill with tears, which he quickly wiped away. The sign had given him the courage he needed to continue. He grabbed Severus's hand and continued inside.
Harry snuck around the corner, hoping no one would see him sneaking down to the dungeons. Seeing a familiar girl, he hid behind a set of armor. "Parkinson!"
The child looked at the whale of the man, terrified beyond all belief. "Yes sir!" Visibly shaking, the small boy moved his rag over to the mess made by the person Saxton assumed must be his uncle. However, as his rag moved over the shattered ceramic, the boy got cut, but made no sound. Without even showing any sign of pain, the boy picked up the rest of the ceramic, depositing it in the nearest trashcan. He quietly returned to the mess, finishing cleaning it up, a small amount of his blood mixing in with the liquid from inside the cup. The boy then peered up at the behemoth of a man, his eyes dead, but also seeking approval that he doubted he would ever receive.
Harry mumbled something into Snape's chest, not wanting the hug to end. Snape understood quickly. "Harry, is it alright if I just picked you up and carried you? I know your legs must be tired from all the walking, and this way you can get a little bit of cuddle time too."
"Will he be okay, Madam Pomfrey?" The boy averted his eyes, which was unnatural for him, as he normally was full of self-confidence.
Snape knelt down next to Harry. "I'm so proud of you. You are incredibly brave. I wanted to thank you Harry. You gave me a chance even though I haven't been the nicest to you before. I never really realized how I must have seemed to everyone, and I have to thank Ronald for making me aware of that. I promise Harry, I'm going to try to be the best dad for you. You really do deserve the best." Snape ran his hands through his son's unruly hair.
Severus led him up the stairs to the room he knew was Lily's and James's room. Harry's nursery was completely destroyed, but the master bedroom was mostly intact. Harry quietly began looking around, his hands touching surfaces he knew his parents had once touched, and briefly felt their comfort. His hands roamed a dresser, and stopped upon a hair brush. Engraved into the handle was a flower. A lily, he thought. He carefully pocketed it. As he made his way over to the side of the bed, he noticed most of the floor here was decayed and broken. He decided he didn't want to risk it until he saw a glimmer of something reflected on the nightstand. He carefully crawled over the bed and grabbed it, but the momentum nearly caused him to fall through the hole. He looked back to see Severus had grabbed onto his leg just in time to prevent him from plummeting to his probably gruesome death.
"Harry, you will never be too much work. You need to actually be able to be a child, and live life happily. And it doesn't matter if you're annoying. You will still be my son. That is, if you say yes."
I'm sorry for it being so long since my last update. On brighter news, my spouse and I found a stray kitten while walking our puppy, and we raised it from 3 weeks and now our animals are great friends. In times like these, I find myself relying on them to put a smile on my face. I hope this chapter puts a smile on yours.
The two quickly reached the door they were told to go to. Snape reached out his hand, but before he could knock, the door swung open.
Lucius quickly maneuvered them out. "The Being division should be just around the corner. That is where we are going to get everything set in place. I can pull some strings and make it impossible for Dumbledore to meddle in this. Trust me, he will try. At this point, we shouldn't trust anyone on the supposed light side." The group turned a corner and knocked on a door titled Wizarding Adoption Services. He walked inside after hearing a quiet greeting. "Hello Madam Parkinson. I need your help. Severus here would like to adopt Harry Potter. He had discovered the boy was horribly abused and Dumbledore knew that all along."
After waiting a brief period of time, Harry snuck out and headed down to his first class of the day. Walking into the Potions classroom, he sat down next to Ron and Hermione.
Severus carefully led them out of the building, Harry keeping his hand in his pocket around his parent's items. As they made their way to the graveyard, he marveled at the fact that those items were still there after all that time, just waiting for him. It was like his parents knew he was going to be back. Before he knew it, they were standing at the edge of the graveyard.
The second the man was in the room, he threw a punch directly at the child's head. There was a sickening crunch, showing the man had made his mark. Still though, the child refused to make a single sound. Already he was bruising, his right cheek turning an ugly purple. Still though, the man wasn't done. In a second, the child was pinned against a wall, a giant hand wrapped around his throat. The monster, Harry's uncle, ripped his shirt off, revealing a series of gruesome cuts across the child's back, most of which looked infected. Vernon made a small noise of approval, and threw the child back down on the ground. "You deserve this, you freak. You deserve every second of this, and so much more. You're going to be my puppet, my slave. You'll never be free from me." With those ominous words, he left the room.
Severus released a breath he didn't know he was holding. "Are you quite positive he's going to be okay?"
Severus walked briskly to the Gryffindor common room. He caught a glimpse of Harry slipping through the portrait on his way to his classes. "Mister Potter, a word with you please. In my office. Any and all classes you miss will be excused."
The giant man gave a slight nod, out of things to make a mess with. "Its decent, freak. Now get out of my sight!" With that final word, he aimed a kick at the child's rib cage. "Go on then! Get out of here!"
"Thank you, Dobby. The cookies look wonderful." Harry gave a smile to the house elf who beamed with pride before vanishing.
Saxton stood up and walked over towards him. "Harry, can I see your back please? I won't touch it, I just want to see how bad the damage is."
Severus knelt down next to Harry. "Yes it is. Your mother and father died to ensure you live safely and happily. I am sure they would have never wanted you to be put in the hands of your aunt and uncle, but now we can ensure they will get their wish of your safety and happiness. Would you like to go visit the house before we visit their graves?"
"See you, Malfoy." Only after Malfoy left, did Harry realize that he called him Harry. A small blush spread across his face. He turned to Madam Pomfrey, who was watching the exchange with amused eyes. "When will I be released?"
"That isn't the point Parkinson! Are you gonna help me or not?" He glared at Pansy, silencing her. "Please..."
"I will talk to Professor Dumbledore in the morning. He will do something about it." Despite him saying that, a heavy doubt settled across his features. He knew Dumbledore had checked up on Harry. "Draco, I want you to go back to your dormitory and try to rest for a few more hours. The moment the sun comes up, I'm going to speak to the Headmaster."
Harry sat down and quickly drank the potion, coughing slightly. After about three seconds, he slumped against the chair he was seated in.
"Wait... How did Harry even notice when you didn't?? You sit with me every day!" Draco shifted the attention to Harry. He had just started noticing everyone was using each others first names and it was throwing him off.
"I'm glad you're my son. Thank you for saving me Harry." Snape wiped away his own tears, feeling immense love for the small black haired boy in front of him. "What do you say we go tell Draco what's going on? Seems to me he's been pretty worried. I think he'd be happy to know that a certain boy is safe."
"Of course, Harry. I will always stand by my word." With that, Snape led Harry to the Three Broomsticks and walked in, heading straight for the table he always used.
"I... may have been observing you?" It nearly sounded like a question, the way he said it. His face was tinged with red. "After a while I started noticing it. I started getting worried when I realized it had gotten to the point where there were literally no apples left in the castle. I even checked the kitchens."
"Thank you Potter." Malfoy was working intently, already adding and mixing. He hadn't even noticed he thanked Harry. He quickly became absorbed in his work.
Snape's expression darkened and he nodded. "I'm positive." He then began leading the group towards the elevator. Briefly he wondered what the trio looked like to all who could see them. The terrifying potions professor holding the hand of a small child who is dragging along the intimidating Lucius Malfoy. He had to suppress a small bit of laughter before they got in the elevator. Turning to Lucius, he raised his eyebrow. It was obvious that Lucius had the same thought he did.
Severus led Harry to the lobby. "Are you ready? I think it's finally time you get to visit your parents."
"Enter." Albus Dumbledore peered over the top of his half moon spectacles, wondering who it was this early in the morning. He was surprised when it was Severus, not Harry begging to get out of the household he lived in.
Harry jumped on the subject change. "Yes, I'm safe, and yeah, Snape is my dad now. He knew the only way to keep me safe was if I was his son. He's the one who got me help. He's the reason I don't have to hide anymore."
Dang, this chapter took forever! Sorry about that! I had a lot going on. Finally got out of the depressive slump I was in, but then I ended up bursting a tendon in my foot that I had surgery in, and was in a lot of pain and just wanted to sleep. I'm currently working on the deage Harry Potter/Neville Longbottom fanfic I've been dreaming about. I will be posting the first chapter of that soon! My birthday is on July 21st and my next surgery is on the 3rd of August, so there will be a small lapse in the hopefully more common updates. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope you enjoy!
Saxton took a moment to compose himself. He put his wand to his temple, extracting a silvery string of memory, placing it into a labeled glass vial. He then put it away in a case on his desk that was labelled for Harry. Turning to the duo again, he took a deep breath. "I'm glad you're out of there now. Mister Snape, there was concerns about the age regression?" Upon receiving Severus's stiff nod, Saxton continued. "It's perfectly normal in abuse cases. It's a coping mechanism. Chances are, it will stop after therapy, but there is a chance it won't, which is also normal. There is nothing wrong with it. I promise. It is possible his mental age will fluctuate a lot, finding an age he feels safe at. Don't be surprised."
Malfoy did a double take when he saw Harry standing next to Pansy. "Potter? What are you doing here? I thought you were in the hospital wing?" His eyes darted to everyone present. "What's going on here?"
"I love you too sweetie." With a gentle kiss to the mess of hair, the two made their way towards the library, taking the back way to avoid any people to make Harry feel safer until he was ready to face the world as himself rather than the glamours. The library was nearly empty, except for a set of three kids, two sitting at a table reading intently, and one pacing around them.
Harry vaguely considered going down to visit Hagrid, but he realized the doors to the castle were most likely locked at this time. He ended up just letting himself wander, ending up somewhere in the dungeons. Looking around, he realized he was lost. "Bugger. This isn't good. I'm glad I'm wearing my cloak."
"After classes. I don't really fancy you visiting me twice in one day, Mister Potter. While I do enjoy the company, you are in here way too much. I still don't know how you end up here so often, especially on the first day back at school. I still find it hard to believe you fell down stairs at your home while bringing your trunk down." She was reminiscing, and didn't notice Harry's face go dark. Harry knew she would become suspicious after a while.
Snape stood up and strode to the small boy, wrapping his arm around him and pulling him into a hug. He knew he wasn't technically his son yet, but he had a surge of affection towards the small child. "Harry, I promise that isn't true." Harry turned his face into the robes of his professor, clinging on to him. "I want you. I don't ever want you to be hurt again."
Draco kneeled next to him. "I'm sorry Harry, I should've thought. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise." He slowly raised his hand, watching Harry for reactions. Harry stiffened, until he felt a gentle touch on the top of his head. Draco ran his fingers absentmindedly through the boy's hair.
SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG!! It's been a hectic few months! After that surgery I got in a couple abusive relationships (I wasn't allowed to do anything other than talk to them), got extremely sick, PTSD started acting up and I couldn't write about abuse, and two days ago I got rear-ended and sprained my hip and shoulder! It still really hurts to type because of my shoulder but I was desperate and wanted to update! To be honest, writing abuse still really makes my PTSD act up but I needed to for the story. (My boyfriend got upset that I forced myself to do it tbh). Don't worry guys, this boyfriend is amazing. Thanks everyone for the support! It means a lot to me. Also, sorry it's so short!
Pansy stood and bid the others a farewell, as she had a little bit of homework left to complete, and ran to her dormitory, leaving the boys in an uncomfortable silence. They were both certain she had actually left because she was about to cry. Pansy may appear blunt and heartless, but they knew she cared deeply about all of her friends, and Harry had quickly made his place as one.
Madam Parkinson turned to Harry and smiled. "Harry, you're now safe. Your father will protect you." Turning to Snape, she spoke. "I would recommend taking him to Mungos to see how bad the damage is. He appears to have gotten back to his actual age for the time being, so now would be a great time to do it. I'm going to go ahead and set up a few protection spells to prevent Dumbledore from meddling like he always does. You are free to go."
"You will want to go to Philip Saxton. He's just down the hall two doors to your left. He will be expecting you." He raised his wand, sending a patronus to alert the healer of his new patient. "I hope everything turns out well. He's great at what he does. Your son is in great care, I assure you." He gave a small smile towards the duo, and they began walking down the hall.
"Can you just bring us some snacks please? Something warm and comforting would be nice." Draco's voice was kind, and Harry nearly did a double take. Draco being nice to someone beneath him was almost unheard of... at least that's what everyone said.
"I was talking to Harry, I found him wandering out late at night, looking really upset. It took him a while but he told me what was going on... well, technically he didn't say anything. He was too scared. He gets abused at home. Badly. He told me that they would kill him if he said anything. After that, he started acting different. Younger. It made me worried." Draco looked down. "I tried to stroke his hair to calm him down but he got really scared, and that's when I really knew. He started begging me not to hurt him, saying he was sorry. Please, you have to get him out of there." Draco's eyes glistened with tears, and he wiped them away angrily.
“Yes. The band is making me miserable, I used to love being out on tour with the guys but I hate it now.”
Neville was seated at a table with four mugs of frothing butterbeer, his hands were covered in small cuts, his fingernails were grimed black with dirt from his herbology work, and he had a smudges of soil on his cheek and forehead. It reminded Harry of the Neville during the battle, with his hands encrusted with blood and dust, his face a mess of cuts and filth. Neville had been the one to stand up against Voldemort when they all thought Harry was dead, and he had been the one to wield the Sword of Gryffindor to kill the snake Nagini.
Harry rolled his eyes, Hermione hadn’t changed one bit since their school days. She now worked in the Department of Mysteries, where she was permanently snowed under with research, and she loved it.
“Great, see you Friday night,” Hermione said over her shoulder as she walked away, “I’ll set the floo to be open for you at seven.”
“Your Muggle device has been making sounds all night,” said Kreacher. “Kreacher did not know how to make it stop so I hid it under your pillow. Would Master Harry like some breakfast?”
in half an hour. Harry decided to leave now and go for a walk to clear his head before meeting Hermione. He wandered through the streets, mercifully it was not raining for once, rehearsing the things he wanted to say to Hermione in his head, eventually ending up at the coffee shop five minutes early. He ordered their usual drinks and treats, picked a table towards the back and waited for Hermione. She turned up a few minutes later and she looked awful. She should have been glowing and happy with the excitement of the engagement but instead her skin was sallow, eyes red rimmed and she was visibly upset. Harry rose to greet her and she fell into his hug with a gut wrenching sob.
