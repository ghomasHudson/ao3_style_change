"I can't resist young men innocently entering the den of evil," he winked.
"You're surprised by the fact that I'm glad you're healthy and can have little Potter babies one day?"
"I don't really miss them. I don't have any memories of them. I've always been with my grandma. All the adults always assume I'm sad, but I'm fine. Scorpius won't be sad either, you know. I think. Besides, he's got his daddy."
"It's not silly at all, Draco."
"Try to cast a spell."
They cuddled in silence. Through the bay window they could see the garden, the blue-lit pool and the moths that cast their huge shadows when they approached its lights. The living room was lit only by a small lamp with a warm light.
"That's it. You know everything."
He owed his life to the love of two mothers for their sons. His own's for him, and Narcissa Malfoy's for Draco. It was strangely poetic. Mostly, it made him believe that Narcissa couldn't be that horrible. Harry smiled at her.
"It's too late for that, Mr Malfoy." Harry grabbed the large wooden ruler lying on the desk and played with it. "You should have thought of that much earlier in the semester."
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, too absorbed in the pleasure. He probably missed an interaction, because another Dom had approached and Draco was jerking him off as he continued to pleasure Harry with his mouth. Surprisingly, Harry didn't mind sharing. He was too busy being turned on by the sight of Malfoy generously satisfying men's desires.
Harry was tired, a little drowsy from the previous day's alcohol, the morning's sedatives. Elena Dunne. Harry had worried sometimes about his groupies. But he'd worried about being followed, or having dirty pants stolen, or being publicly proposed to by a stranger. He had underestimated them. Their obvious fondness for him had led him to fallaciously believe that they were, at heart, rather harmless. The more he thought about it, the more stupid and responsible he felt for the situation. He should have... He didn't really know. He should have done something, anyway. He should have protected his boyfriend.
"How so?"
"Daddy, no!" protested Scorpius. "No kiss!"
Or "the chapter where Harry and Draco come out of their secret love bubble".
Work and sex, then. That would have been more than enough for two men. But they had more. They had immensely more. They had the knowing smile that spoke for itself. They had the kisses in the morning to soften the sound of the alarm clock. They had the treacle tarts that Draco would bake at any opportunity so that Harry could bring slices to the office. They had the 'I love you' in the shower together after a long day. They had the little kitten, whom they had named Salem, who grew up without losing his cuteness or his love of snuggling, and who managed to make eyes until he was brought to work either by Harry or Draco. He was unanimously adored by the DMLE and Sectumsempra staff, a universal mascot of sorts. But the person who adored him the most was Scorpius. The baby could have watched him play for hours. He particularly liked to wave the fishing pole with a ball of yarn attached to the end, which the kitten would chase and jump to reach.
I love this chapter. I hope you will too.
He wanted Draco back. He was with him all the time, of course. But he no longer allowed himself to kiss him on the mouth. Or to call him anything but by his first name. He had to turn away, embarrassed, when someone talked about the future, even the immediate one. Sleeping in Draco's house was torture. This morning Harry had felt like crying over his bowl of cereal, thinking that when Draco could take care of Scorpius and Harry would never set foot in his house again, he would never be able to eat breakfast from his perfectly sized and shaped french ceramic bowls again. Harry was going crazy.He sniffed Draco's scent every chance he got in his walk-in closet, and he was close to stealing a pillow or a throw as a souvenir to keep at home so he could cry on it when Draco began to make his life without him.
"Yes. Draco bought me an iPhone, I'll have to show you that, you'll love it. We have all the Muggle devices you can imagine."
Potter flipped through a few thick, satiny pages at random, coming across a photograph of a man lying on the floor on his stomach, his back and buttocks scarred by a belt, taken from above. The light contrasts on his skin were formidable. On the next page, a poem. On the next, a photo of a Dom, cut off at the chin and hips, wearing a leather harness over oiled muscles, and holding a whip. The lines of the harness, the whip, his arms, the muscles of his torso met, forming proportional triangles that drew the eye to his navel.
It was true that it was never explicit that they talked about money. Instead, they talked about projects, about causes. And Harry had causes. Gay marriage. Increased funding for the Auror Department and for security in general. A justice system that paid as much attention to the deaths of the Knockturn Alley prostitutes, the disappearances of Goblins and the attacks on honourable ex-members of the Order of the Phoenix. More than just lip service to the orphans of the war. Compulsory Muggle studies for all students at Hogwarts. And suddenly, all these things to which he had contributed by his statements, by his donations, became within reach. It was always the same. Draco would run into someone at a gala, and he'd smile, and he'd shake their hand, and he'd put his hand in the small of Harry's back, and he'd so easily steer the discussion to one of Harry's projects, and always, the person they were talking to was the perfect match to make it happen, and was more than happy to help.
Draco fell back into the chair he had elected as his own in this office.
Callum burst out laughing, quickly followed by Harry. "Pansy said there were two possibilities in this situation," Callum explained. "Either you explode with anger and kick Harry out for his presumption. Or you give him a half smile in spite of yourself, and Harry still has a chance."
Then he locked himself in the upstairs bathroom and sat on the floor to cry.
"It's not the kind of disagreement we can put behind us. Harry... he wants children. Blood children."
"I'm so happy to see you, Draco," said his mother with emotion. "You too, Mr Potter. It's been a long time."
A babble made him retrace his steps. The man had finally decided on a packet of cereal, and he had turned to put it in his shopping basket.  Harry could see his face now.
terrified of the woman who used to be your wife."
"I can go to the table..."
On Tuesday night, Harry went out to a bar in his neighbourhood. He went home with a woman, they slept together, the woman left, and Harry went to sleep at barely one o'clock in the morning, incomprehensibly frustrated.
Harry and Callum finished the full bag between them. After his third burger, Harry grunted and gave up. Callum's mobile rang, a message from Benjamin. Callum sent him a quick text. Harry saw on the screen that it was already six in the morning.
"Yes, I do. And you need to check out a certain bar nearby called the Proud Lion."
When Callum slipped away upstairs to change his shirt after spilling rum on himself too quickly for any wizarding reflexes to stop him, Draco went upstairs with him to the bathroom. Out of habit, or kindness, perhaps, Draco undid the buttons for him. Callum took off the open shirt. Draco took it and, hanging it on a towel rail, carefully ran his wand over the fabric to try to save it.
"I tended to get depressed easily. She thought I was dwelling too much on the war, that I wasn't moving on. She had good intentions, but the result was that I stopped telling her when things were not going well, stopped confiding in her, stopped communicating. I was afraid to bother her. As a result, she found me distant, not invested. I think I never really found my place in her life. She was strong, independent, brilliant. I felt useless, awkward or burdensome whenever I tried to reach out to her."
"Don't tell me he's asking me to decide whether or not to remove the magical devices."
"All in good time."
"We've covered the basics," Callum replied quietly, his irises dilated with desire. "Are you feeling all right?"
"Will you allow me to kiss him, Callum?"
They spent the rest of the morning testing the new Orb. Harry was unable to break through its barrier when he tried to cast spells from the outside into the force field. The only flaw that needed to be corrected was that sometimes, when the Orb bearer tried to cast a spell at the same time as an attack was being directed at the forcefield, a sort of loud detonation would occur and make the shield fallible for a few seconds.
(For curious readers, here is what Blaise (the pampered and impolite boy) said to his mother in French:
"You've changed," Potter commented as the girl left. "You're so... commanding."
"I don't want to do them."
"Fuck! Master, Master, Master... Fuck!" Draco felt possessed. He rubbed his cock against the hard board, lubricated by his own precum. His head was spinning - he forced himself to breathe. Every breath was freezing and aching in his lungs, Circe, the outside was so cold, and Draco was burning, and Harry's fingers, and...
Harry removed his leather belt. Callum had told him about Draco's boundaries, and what he liked, what Hary could and couldn't do. Draco remained perfectly still as he had placed him, his hands flat on the floor beside his shoulders, his thighs spread.  Harry listened to his breathing. He realised that he could no longer hear the birds, the water in the pool still splashing furiously, the wind in the leaves or the distant laughter of the neighbours. But he could hear Draco's heart beating.
"So you don't intend to stay with my son for very long."
Flabbergasted, Draco watched as his Dom, who was perfectly available, and Harry Potter arranged to have dinner together next Saturday and then go out to Bound Gods. Callum offered to drop by a Muggle S&M club afterwards, if there was nothing interesting going on at the wizarding club. Oh, Draco was screwed. Potter did seem interested in the scene. If they ended up having sex without him, Draco hesitated between asking Callum for the memory for his Pensieve and gutting them both - he wasn't sure why.
Harry looked for the lie in the beautiful silver eyes. He kissed Draco's forehead tenderly. He seemed to be doing almost fine. Harry too was on thin ice. He hadn't had any panic attacks or overwhelming memories, but this place filled him with a special nostalgia. There were both his best and worst memories here. Deaths. Friendships. Tortures. Wonderment. Hogwarts.
Draco wondered if he had seen his logo in his bathroom, if his wife was, by any chance, using one of their products. The man said nothing, but nodded.
"I know we said until noon, Harry, but this is so cool! I got to catch the pom-pom on the trampoline! Please, please, please, please..."
"And Harry?" the Head asked, his eyes on his parchment. He had already ticked his name off the list when he looked up to see Harry shaking his head. His superior opened his mouth, crossed out his name and looked for another forced volunteer.
The consultation was the most positive since Scorpius was born. Between his magical signals, his reactions to the various tests and his first accidental manifestation of magic, Spindle was very reassuring and suggested that Scorpius be exposed to magic, without Orbs, for a maximum of two hours a week. Depending on his reactions, it would be seen in a few months whether this time could be increased. Harry could already imagine what those two short hours could mean, all the places and pretty spells they could show Scorpius, all the magical toys he could discover. Riding a baby flying broom was definitely high on Harry's list.
"If I die one day under mysterious circumstances," Draco said, "I want you to know that it was them. I didn't lose my title because I married and carried on my 'pure' bloodline. But in their eyes, I am an enemy now."
Harry didn't agree at all with what they were saying. Draco hadn't deserved this.
"Darling?"
"I don't want that either," said Harry.
And Harry... Harry and his halo of Good, Harry having just learned something that big about Draco's son, Harry thought of
"There's nothing to excuse.  That's your job. And I'm an ex-Death Eater, routine checks are part of my sentence. I figured it would happen one day. I don't blame you."
"It burns." Draco's voice was much huskier than he had ever heard it. Harry was crazy about it. "I love it."
"That's kind." Harry was grateful for the opportunity to not have to leave the room to shoot up caffeine or theine. What he didn't know at the time was that the small kitchen would mostly provide cold storage for the dozens and dozens of dishes that the dozens and dozens of visitors would bring in, to the point where Draco's room would approximate a cafeteria at some point and Harry would gain ten pounds from being stationary and eating.
"Mmmh..."
Thomas did not return their greeting, even though he had seen them both clearly. He pulled something from between the folds of his coat. The building's defenses went up before Draco's eyes could process the information. As if a lasso had encircled his waist, Draco felt himself being pulled violently, fell to his knees and slid several feet towards the glass façade of the building. He pulled his wand from his holster against his forearm and tried to stabilise the building's magic and his own, to balance their connection. His lungs had been drained of air. When he no longer felt as if the magic link might throw him against a window, he opened his eyes again and analysed the scene.
"Oh, bribing an Auror, too? It is no longer in your power to
"What's a cartoon deevee...?"
Draco opened his eyes again, lying on the floor, his feet up on one of the armchairs in the hall. He hadn't realised Callum had moved him.
He saw under the door the lights in the corridor turn on, and wondered if that meant it was already nightfall. Shouldn't he have heard something? He rubbed his eyes and went out into the corridor. There were two Aurors sitting out front. "You can't be serious. You're watching me?" The men shrugged sheepishly. Harry sighed. Should he have gone into the murderous, vengeful rage that everyone seemed to expect? Was he reacting in the wrong way? He couldn't think about that. He could only think of Draco. Even his attacker meant nothing compared to the terror of Draco's health. "Have you seen any doctors come by? I just want to know if there's any news."
"It's interactive, there are magical effects among the audience and up to our eyes. If it all disappeared once within a few feet of Scorpius like a burst soap bubble..."
Draco and him would be fine.
"For dinner tonight."
"I don't understand."
Dear mother, dear father
"Of course. Nobody's dead. We need to stop being so emotional."
He had planned everything. He had done all the blood and magic and physical examinations. He had found the best specialist on the continent. He had created his own fertility potion. He already had a stock of homemade prenatal potions and vitamins. He had recruited a general manager for the Spanish branch of Sectumsempra; all the national branches had a competent person in charge, Draco only had to manage the distribution of the global budgets according to the projects that would be proposed to him, as long as the company did not expand.  He had bought animal blood from the most famous apothecary in Diagon Alley so that reporters and gossips would eventually come to the conclusion that this was when he had performed the activation ceremony for his carrier gene. He had ordered books on male pregnancy from four European bookshops through owl. He had planted discreet but credible evidence, findable by the next reporter who tried, to appear as a young wizard about to experience his first pregnancy.
Potter saved Draco and spoke first with a sigh. "I thought we'd already talked about this, Lucius. When you want to talk to me, you make an appointment like everyone else, and you certainly don't walk into my office demanding things. For example, you can start by saying hello to your son and me."
Harry continued his gentle administrations. A kiss on his wrist, several on the softest part of his forearm where there was no hair, then on his elbow. A small muscle in Draco's arm twitched. "You're awake, I think," said Harry. "I hope you're okay. I've had some news from the investigation. They've managed to explore Dunne's memory. They have evidence that she was the one who attacked you. Legilimency, by four different experts - not Veritaserum. She's not going to stand a chance at the trial." Harry sighed. His warm breath tickled Draco's skin. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for what you went through."
"Am I mute?" he asked Harry in his head.
"That's not funny at all. And yes, of course I'm would. Otherwise, I can also support you without you having to work."
"How about we give Harry the cake you made this afternoon, Scorpius?"
"Because you no longer believe in your own superiority?"
He gently pushed the pile of newspaper articles towards Harry and pretended to dive back into his financial journal. Harry did not leave immediately. He didn't storm off, didn't shout. His hesitation seemed sad.
"The last time, when he realised it was me, he took his clothes and left. I had to beg him. I assure you, he's not interested in me. And even if he was, it's too soon for me. Too soon after Astoria, and especially too soon after Jules."
He sat down in the chair. "Are you okay today?" Draco nodded and put his thumb in the air, abandoning the idea of the writing. "It's good to see you sitting up." The nurses were helping Draco to sit up for longer and longer periods. He hadn't been unconscious long enough for his deep muscles to melt, but it was more a matter of balance and the ability to work the commands in his body. There, propped up against the cushions, he was fine. His head was a bit heavy, but he was fine. For the last three or four days he had been walking a little, under the supervision of the doctors. He was doing well when he had just taken his painkillers, despite the weakness of his injured thigh, but when the pills, less powerful than the previous ones, had been taken a few hours ago, each step was a stab in the stomach.
Potter stopped kissing Callum, leaned over and sucked Draco's cock, which was just sticking out of the water. Draco wriggled between the two men, already excited about the next step. Callum insulted him cruelly for his impatience, calling him a cockslut and a hole, and Draco could only nod, breathless. When he called Callum "Master", Potter whimpered around his cock.
Draco nodded.
"I know, baby. Oh, I know. I feel your goosebumps, and the warmth of your skin, and I see it on your face. I'm here for you. We'll wait together. Look at me." His lover's dark irises were not panicked or sad, but in control. Oh, Circe, that was exactly what Draco needed. He'd noticed Callum's near breakdowns several times when he thought Draco wasn't aware of him, and it had disturbed him greatly. He knew Callum was a man after all, but he felt more stable by proxy when his Dom was well and acting like himself.
"Did you just say 'that's selfish'?" repeated Harry. "You care about what's selfish now? Draco Malfoy, the man who taught me to follow my desires?"
"It's excellent, Master."
And then Malfoy said two little words, and Harry understood what he'd meant by 'magic card' the evening before.
"Perfect."
When he left, Harry had too much information to process to know where to start. But the first thing that came up was "He's dominated him before too, hasn't he?".
"Blaise has a
"Mmh..." Draco sat down, then lay down in the middle of the grass. The trees in the forest were huge, and the ones in the grounds, obviously planted by man, looked at least fifty years old. Everything was perfectly quiet, he would not have thought it was so close to the village. Little birds were singing. "Do you want a country house?"
"A few centuries ago," Narcissa recounted, and her voice was so captivating that Scorpius looked at her face, gripped, as if reading a story, "for two generations, all Pureblood wizards in England were born male. French Purebloods were suspected, or Russians, but it was never clear who was responsible for the curse. No more girls of wizard blood were born into the old wizarding families."
"He knew my dueling style. It was smart, what he did. He knew he had little chance of getting away with it, but he wanted to eliminate me in particular, for the symbol that I - that you and I are. He knew I never used an AK. He thought he could kill me by taking advantage of my reluctance to counterattack with an equivalent spell." He probably would have succeeded, if Harry hadn't used the AK.
"Not really."
Harry continued to hunt down the HPA. The first trials took place. Harry reported everything. The small, harmless spells, the seemingly benign tricks that drove people mad after a few months, and the more violent attacks. The administrative department looked into his files, and found more offences. Former Slytherin students who had had their exam grades doctored so that they failed their studies. Purebloods expropriated through the use of whimsical and abusive laws, some of which were perfectly made up. Property was restituted. Fines were handed out. Many people who had discriminated for years against former Slytherins, former Voldemort supporters, Purebloods, or their descendants, or their relatives, or their spouses... were fired from the Ministry and from several large companies.
"So the only difference is that he said you're not together anymore."
Just then a second questionnaire appeared in the previously empty envelope, and Harry understood what Draco meant in his letter. Several dozen pages listed all of Draco's answers to the questionnaire. He had gone even further than a mark out of 10 and added comments directly to Harry to guide him: the places on his body where he particularly liked or disliked a particular instrument, the number of strokes of a particular instrument he could take without difficulty and the maximum number, directions as to what a particular physical reaction meant for him... A second handwriting sometimes intervened, one that Harry recognised as Callum's, also adding directions and warnings.
He didn't say it in a very threatening tone, but Harry sensed all the same that if he lifted a finger at Malfoy, he would be in serious trouble, wizard or not.
Unlike Thomas, Draco did not moan or grunt. When the sensation became too much, he tended to hold his breath for a few seconds. Harry watched him carefully - there had been several occasions when he'd forgotten to breathe at all. He used his free hand to wank Draco, again very generous with lube. Everything was slippery. His hand inside Draco, his fingers on the slick surface of his balls and his penis. The sight of his legs tangled in rope and the soft pale skin of his buttocks, and the contrast of the black glove disappearing inside him and the one caressing his parts... Harry wasn't sure how to breathe either.Draco sometimes contracted around him hard, but Harry was inside him, Draco allowed him to be inside him, to stretch him, to spread his hole completely offered by his position, his restraints and his devoted attitude.
"I'm fine."
"So wizarding gay marriage is going to be allowed in the UK."
"All by yourself?"
Harry felt empty. He knew he couldn't blame it all on his fame. There were thousands, maybe millions, of rich and famous people in the world, and they were still making connections, falling in love, living. So it was probably Harry's fault. He always felt so empty when he was trying to form a relationship. He didn't know how to make conversation. In fact, he didn't know what he wanted. He liked to hang out with his Muggle neighbours from time to time, but he didn't want to blend into the Muggle world. He liked to hang out with his wizard friends as often as possible, but it was painful to see them happy, in love, to see their children, their plans. Harry was empty, because he knew now that even if he ever found someone, they would probably never have children. What person would accept that? And more problematically, what person would accept spending their life with a man who hated himself, who felt empty, incomplete, who couldn't get over a war that happened almost a decade ago and the new knowledge, not so dramatic compared to the other horrors of the world, that he was probably infertile?
The reaction of his friends did not disappoint Draco. He was hugged and they cheered and screamed and he felt loved and was glad that no one seemed to have even the slightest inkling that this wasn't necessarily a good idea. Gryffindors and Slytherins had come a long way since Harry and Draco had hooked up.
The doctor opened the door for Harry, and entered after him, closing it.
"What do you mean?"
"No, don't be. It was nice of you to offer."
Draco nodded his understanding.
Harry won. By now the track was a giant paddling pool covered in slime, unidentified substances, and wizards on the ground who no longer had the courage or strength to get up and were laughing hysterically as the last wizards in the race passed by. Harry was covered in egg and flour, but as soon as he crossed the finish line, he took advantage of his regained right to use his wand to clean himself up with a quick spell. He was carried in triumph with the next four runners. By the time the rest of the participants arrived - apparently a good number of them were stuck in quicksand - Harry deftly stepped down from the stage and joined Ron, Draco and Scorpius. He kissed Draco on the mouth and took Scorpius from him. "Are you proud of Daddy, then?" asked Harry to the little boy, who wrapped a powerful grip around his neck. Draco took Harry's Orb out of his pocket and put it around his neck. "Can I steal him from you?" asked Harry in his ear. Scorpius didn't seem to want to let go of him anyway.
The streets were quiet as usual, but the neighbours were out in their gardens having barbecues or reading around their pools as the oppressive heat of the day abated. Most were well hidden behind vegetation, but Draco could hear the laughter and smell the rich food. The odor of grilled meat made him a little nauseous, reminding him that he had thrown up this afternoon on his way back to the office. He really had to stop that, and fast, before his son could ever notice.
Scorpius fidgeted a little, but the nurse was so eager, now asking about Draco's voice - still weak, a mere whisper in the evening when it had been used a lot, sometimes painful, but quite functional - that Harry let them talk, moving away a little as he cradled the boy. "What's the matter? Are you hungry?" He paced up and down the corridor.
"You've come on a good day, Leo. Those two..." Benjamin glanced at them appreciatively.
Then Draco started to cry.
Harry read it.
"You should come and see him more often," Harry said. "He's happy when you're around."
"Was that a regular meeting between you?"
"I see. Here, I give you the little guy back." Draco picked him up with obvious relief and dressed him again. Scorpius tugged at his jumper, obviously too warm, and whimpered until Harry took it off him. The month was cold, but the ward was heated. "Look, everything is fine. I can see from his magic spectrum that something has changed, but his gauge is barely tapped. I think we can go for two to three hours a week, and I'll see you next year to see where we stand?"
"All sorted?" asked Harry gently, looking up from the dining table where he was working. "You were quick."
"Please Nora, tell me he's available," Draco said, clasping his hands together in prayer. He offered her his second croissant, and the woman winked at him.
"In true Slytherin fashion, you didn't need a proper invitation anyway. You still managed to slip into my house and under my skin."
Harry understood what Draco meant by 'Malfoy move'. He felt as though he was experiencing the essence of what being born rich felt like: end up at two o'clock in the morning in Michelin-starred kitchens and eat turbot on a bed of razor clams while getting drunk with friends on absolutely delicious overpriced wine.
"Yes, it was."
"You're welcome. Is everything okay?"
Thank you for your kudos and comments. I'm so happy to be able to talk about the story with you and I love hearing your theories and predilections.
"You're always saying these things about me..." Draco explained as he started walking again. Like you're madly in love with me. "Like I'm an amazing person, like I have an outstanding behaviour... But it's just normal. The way I treat you is just normal."
Nor did he understand much about the evening he was experiencing. What he did remember, before his memory became seriously defective, was that he and Draco had returned to their true bodies and faces, and then he had found himself sitting in the middle of the kitchens of a Michelin-starred restaurant with the chef. She was a fifty years old, plump blonde woman with her hair in a messy bun.
"No, I didn't put him in nursery."
"Please. Please," Draco whispered, his eyelids twitching.
"I don't understand the problem, Draco. Since you have the Orb..."
Draco opened his mouth, but settled for nodding in the end. Molly had imagined it was about adoption, not this. She was surprised that Draco was willing. He always seemed so concerned with his appearance and his career. And he already had an heir, after all.
They had just finished the briefing when the alarm sounded. A voice echoed throughout the department - the entire building, perhaps. "The heads of department are expected by urgent Portkey in the Minister's meeting room. All departmental staff are to return to their workstations and prepare for possible intervention." Harry stood up and ran to the front desk of the Aurors' office. The secretary handed him the emergency Portkey before he even arrived, and he disappeared in a flash, opening his eyes in the circular room next to Shackelbot's office. The officials all appeared within seconds, out of breath.
“Did you say the school was called Hogwarts? Are you sure?” Petunia asks him hurriedly.
As Harry is reaching for a chicken leg, he feels the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. Shivering, he rakes his gaze across the head table, his eyes finally falling upon Severus Snape. The professor looks Harry in the eyes for a moment before nodding, then smiling. No, it’s not just you, Harry can’t believe it either. Harry nods back at the potions master before shifting his attention back to the food on the table and the conversations going on around him.
Harry watched Draco's face for a long time.
Draco held out his hand, and she shook it with a smile. "Are you going to be okay?"
The war... The war was not over at all. It wasn't over in the least. There were little children who lived every day with the knowledge of the parents they had lost to Voldemort, to Death Eaters... to Draco, indirectly. And worse, there were kids who still thought that ideology was bloody good, with a resentment as big as a mountain against the side of tolerance. Nothing had changed. The generation responsible would die, and a new one would replace it. The lure of domination just seemed too strong. Draco understood them perfectly. As a child, as a teenager, he had been them. What could stand in the way of the prospect of world domination? Of being looked upon as masters, as demigods by the submissive Muggle mobs, as the chosen ones of Magic? The dream of becoming wizard-kings was not going to go away any time soon.
"There are several types of reaction. The amazement, the "I knew it", the "it's a candid camera?". The questions. Why don't wizards put an end to disease, to war, to world hunger? Can I ask my wizard colleagues to create counterfeit money for me, or to cast a hex on my asshole neighbour? Most of the time, people have a great sense of humour. Thomas will take it well. He's not very Cartesian, he thinks there are mysterious forces in the world. I'm rather looking forward to telling him, actually."
The wink made Draco melt a little. Oh Circe, give him strength.
"Perhaps your Dom will find it in his mercy to give you special permissions on this matter," Harry said with a wink, trying to return to a lighter tone. Draco smiled at him and waggled his eyebrows, clearly not averse.
"No."
"We never knew why. That's what ate us up. I told you earlier that Pansy is frowned upon by a lot of people. Everyone knew what she said, before the Battle of Hogwarts. That we should turn you over to Voldemort right away to avoid the battle. She regrets it, by the way. She was just terrified. We knew a bit about Voldemort's followers from Draco, and believe me, none of us wanted to be around them. It was nothing personal. She just wanted to stay alive. And stay... untouched."
They laughed heartily and Harry offered him a drink. He learned that Benjamin was a very curious and knowledgeable old-timer, that in his day he had been a Ravenclaw, and that he was neither dominant nor submissive, but fond of some far from vanilla toys. He really put Harry at ease, and the barmaid smiled mischievously at them from afar. As they talked about the Harpies' last game – of course, it had to be the Harpies who had played the night before... – the hall fell silent. They turned in their bar chairs to see the floating stage lowered to the floor.
Harry's and Callum's dripped from Draco's hole.
Harry kissed Draco's cheek. "Hi, darling. It's December 18th. You've been at St Mungo's for five days. You've been injured by several curses, but you'll be fine. Scorpius is fine, he's at home with Madeleine. He tried to pull down the Christmas tree by tugging on a bauble, but I managed to stop him in time. We can't wait to see you again. Oh, and there's news today. The doctors are going to allow visits from people other than Callum and me. I wonder who'll be coming in first."
Draco didn't. Potter appeared to have emerged from his orgasm. He frowned at the mug Draco was holding, and with a flick of his finger switched on the kettle that was balanced precariously on a pile of files in the corner.  A clean mug with the slogan 'Harry Otter' landed in front of Draco, and Harry let him choose from a box stuffed with tea bags which he pulled out of his drawer.
"How many do you want?" asked Harry with curiosity.
There were no headstones, though. There was nothing but rocks and grass.
Draco had been attacked while looking for a Christmas present for Harry. He had overcome his anxiety to go into the wizarding world to find something Harry would like.
"Jules loved watching us."
Harry sighed and ended his glamour. He dipped into the water to wet his messy hair, which was longer than when he was Leo, and looked at Callum. He intercepted his glance at the scar on his forehead. Callum knew a few things about wizarding history, then.
Draco nodded, clutching his son tightly in his arms. "They were outnumbered. The Dark Wizards were using Legilimency, too. With the backup, the Aurors managed to make it through and no Aurors were mortally wounded. But some of the mages got away. The Aurors were afraid they might have picked up on my location in Harry's mind through our marriage bond - he's not infallible in terms of Occlumency. Until they caught the last of the suspects, they asked me to leave the house and preferably go somewhere where there would be a large number of magical signatures to cover ours. I thought of a wizarding hotel, but I didn't want Scorpius to be too disturbed by the novelty..."
"Of course." Jules opened his satchel and magically flipped through some documents, which scrolled quickly under the small movements of his wand. He found the page quickly and elegantly levitated it close to Harry's hand. He only had to open his fingers to grab it. "This is an investigation into the practice of necromancy on Mr Malfoy's estate in February 2006."
"Total honesty. Do your worst."
Callum wasted no time in penetrating Draco’s opening. Under his warmth, the paint liquefied a little again and dripped onto the Dom. Callum shivered and ate Draco's mouth like a starving man. He carefully inserted some of his fingers next to his cock.
"Surprisingly well. The drugs are knocking me out completely, but I feel like I'm progressing fast. You?"
"Happy New Year," he said as he entered. Harry blinked. "Oh. It's January 1st..." he clarified.
The flames. The flames. The flames.

Draco sighed ostentatiously. "You don't have to answer, Harry."
Draco shook his head 'no'. "If it hadn't been for my mother, maybe, I don't know. But there was my mother. So no. I never wanted to die. I was too afraid of what would happen to her. That was also how they got me involved. They were threatening her."
"Yes."
Draco wanted to protest, but Harry looked at him with his big green eyes and...
"Perfectly well."
Draco and Harry took a little longer to recover from the discussion they just had.
Harry grunted. He crouched back down and turned Draco over, his chest against the tiles. Harry hadn't been able to stop himself from taking breaks from his work this afternoon to start exploring Draco's gift. He kept coming back to the same page, the one of the man marked with belt strokes, their colour shading across his skin. Like paint on a canvas.
It hadn't had anything to do with what he had with Draco, obviously. But it had felt good. The heat. The pulsing around him. The shaky exhalations in his ear.
He rubbed his face, took a breath, and entered the corridor.
"For you or for Scorpius?"
If there was one thing Draco knew how to do, it was make men come.
"Yes: he's in the building. His magical signature is very clear and very heavily stressed. He's inside."
"If we have to 'do', we'll do a war!" spat Corvus Selwyn. "For eight years we've been despised by everyone. Our name is trampled on because our parents were Death Eaters. We are disrespected in the most elementary way. We can't get a job. We can't even speak out! As soon as we don't say that Muggles are the best thing in the world, as soon as we try to express perfectly sensible ideas like the fact that they're a potential danger and that we need to protect ourselves from their numerical superiority and their overdeveloped weapons, we're locked up, in prison or in a fucking orphanage, waiting for us to conform to the dominant ideology!"
Draco clenched his jaws to stop himself from asking what had happened. Harry was fighting the Dark Arts practitioners. There was a not insignificant chance that Draco was well acquainted with the murderer, or at least his last name, and it was probably wiser not to know.
Draco's room was gradually beginning to resemble a jungle because of the bunches of flowers - there were also a few balloons jokingly brought in by Draco's friends who knew, like the others, that it was far too tacky to please Draco.But one morning Harry found the whole floor in bloom.  There were bouquets on the tables in the waiting rooms, in the staff break rooms, bouquets hanging in the corridors, and two huge ones in Draco's room, all in the same shades of red, green and white: roses, mimosa and ferns.
"For ten million pounds? Oh no."
"We're both idiots."
"Almost," smiled Draco. "Normally, fish live in the wild like they do here. They can travel across the oceans. At the aquarium they're in captivity."
"Want to help me blow out the candles, baby?" Scorpius shook his head, a little intimidated by the large cake and its candles sparklers. Draco kissed him and blew out his twenty-seven candles. Everyone applauded, even Scorpius, laughing.
"You haven't been here since we've been together," Harry remarked.
simply because he was freaking out?
"To avoid cases like me," Draco smiled without resentment at Harry's cautious words.
"New tooth?"
"Can't he breathe on his own?" asked Harry, not daring to approach. He put the bags on the floor, took off his coat in the heated room.
He hung up.
Baby phone in hand, little kitten in Draco's shirt pocket, very happy with his unprecedented view of the world, they removed their Orbs in the hallway and hurried to their wizarding home in the cold evening. They had set up a gate connecting the two gardens, and the forcefields recognized them easily.
"We have a rule saying we don't throw away the rug on which Harry Potter lost his anal virginity."
"Can't you tell me anything about his state of health?"
The man nodded with an air of satisfaction, no doubt expecting a good tip. He closed the untinted window that separated him from the passengers, and Callum buckled Malfoy in and pulled him against him. Malfoy cuddled up.
There were not many gay wizarding clubs, even in London. Harry had half a dozen establishments to choose from, including one that was a little too extreme for his taste and one that was a little too quiet and aimed at an older crowd. When Harry was in a festive, wild mood, he liked the gay and lesbian club, a slightly hysterical but always exotic explosion of colour. But tonight he was in the mood not to go home alone, and the Two Thick Wands was the best way to accomplish that goal. Harry smiled as he reached the front of the building, which was blinking "Dolce Vita", the theme of the evening, apparently. It was past midnight and the place was crowded.
"Where's the catch?"
Unfortunately, Harry did not give up. He said carefully, softly, "I don't really agree. In that light, Teddy being a Metamorphmagus is unnatural too."
- Summer 1998: Harry's Auror career begins, Draco moves to Paris and meets Assane
"I have a principle, Harry. It is to respect my partners enough to tell them all the truth I can. I refuse to sink into lies and cover-ups."
Pansy took him in her arms.
"The screams of my parents when they died. Cedric's death during the Triwizard Tournament. Sirius' death at the Ministry. Dumbledore's death."
Blaise approached slowly, feline. They melted into each other, mouths hungry, penises painfully hard in their trousers. Harry sought friction against Blaise's hip. He was absolutely gorgeous, Harry realized as he undid his shirt. He had not a single scar, not a single mole, Harry couldn't find a single flaw. When he reached the last button on Blaise's shirt, he naturally undid his belt, his trousers and his fly in the process. Blaise's sex was straining in his white boxers. Harry's hands shook a little. In the last few months, his lovers had often been half-naked already. Undressing someone new gave him a shiver.
Draco swore and screamed and cried, which was still a little unsettling for Harry, but he trusted Callum to draw the line and respect Draco's boundaries. Besides, the blond didn't try to pull back, to get out of the way, to push them away. He was kissing Callum as if his life depended on it, and one of his hands was scratching the back of Harry's thigh, as if to urge him on harder.
"Crucio. What it feels like to be a victim of it, and what it feels like to throw one at an innocent person."
He removed the blindfold and continued his careful fingering, filling Draco's hole with lots of lube.  He loved this part of Draco. The skin was thin, soft, pale and pink. He didn't shave it, but even then, his hair was fine and light, soft. Harry liked to feel them on his tongue when he was eating his ass. Speaking of eating his ass...
(See the end of the chapter for
They lazily kissed.
Of course, the Minister was right about one thing: hiring Thomas had been illegal, if one followed English wizarding law to the letter. But Draco had trusted Callum, and Callum had trusted Thomas, and Harry still remembered how easily the decision had been made, without any particular fear. And it had all worked out well; Thomas had harboured nothing but fascination for his discovery of magic, and he had adapted easily to his job. Harry didn't believe for a second that he could have deliberately set off a bomb in front of the company. But the facts all pointed in the same direction: a Muggle who had discovered magic when he shouldn't have, who had harboured hatred or jealousy or fear of wizards, to the point of hatching this plan against his own colleagues.
Draco supposed that given the state of his bowels after the shredding spell, it wasn't too surprising. The only problem was that Draco had taken two powerful potions an hour ago to reform the tissue in his vocal cords and throat, and those potions reacted very, very badly with anesthesia.
"I think it's just you turning me on."
"I think it's suspicious too, but there's no information on it, so... Maybe we should look in the Muggle press?"
If the nurse was surprised at their closeness, she did not show it. Draco nodded once at her routine questions, but he didn't listen much. She got the message, smiled and walked away, leaving Draco to his imaginary magical adventure.
"Does it involve the death or torture of someone? Does it directly harm an innocent person?"
Harry looked around the round, high-ceilinged lobby, a glass and wrought iron ceiling that looked delicate. He sat down in a black leather chair so comfortable he wondered how he would get up. Curious, he cast a wandless spell to listen discreetly to the wizard, who was walking towards the counter held by a smiling young black woman.
Harry was about to enjoy his best night in a long time. He drifted off to sleep thinking that despite all the complications, nothing had ever made him as happy as Draco Malfoy.
One day Scorpius scraped his knee a little while running, and he cried "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy", and spent half an hour against Harry. Draco watched them from a little further away, his eyes curious and tender, letting him handle things. And Harry felt his chest tighten. This was no longer about a game, or a song, or a routine. This was the little boy looking for him when he was vulnerable, when he was hurt, when he was afraid. It was his little boy.
"His company is offering to develop items or potions for us. I have a few ideas of things that might come in handy."
His Dom reclined on the same sofa as the first time, a large, thick, camel-coloured leather piece of furniture, leaning against the high armrest and spreading his legs to make room for Draco. Draco drank standing up, aware of the immediate impossibility of sitting, and crawled on his stomach between Harry's legs, his chin resting on his chest, because he wanted to look at him. Harry kissed his forehead and proceeded to stroke his fair hair.
Sectumsempra UK went back to work. Draco went back to work. Harry stopped talking about his investigation into Thomas. Draco was surprised to find that public opinion was quite favourable, highlighting the company's contribution to society and portraying it as a victim of tragedy rather than the cause of an attack. But the wind was ill. A law was passed clarifying the rules for disclosing the existence of magic to one's Muggle spouse, with precise minimum periods of engagement, a register in which to record the identity of the Muggle who had been told, and possible monitoring by the Ministry. A hybrid company now required a legal document from a Muggle family member or spouse, certifying that the Muggle had been made aware of magic in a personal and authorised capacity, in order to hire them. Rumours continued. Monitoring cooperation even more. Monitoring Muggles and the development of their weapons. A new Ministry unit was given a lot of resources to track down any Muggle organisations or terrorist plans against wizards. All of this was burdensome. Disturbing rhetoric reemerged, fearing Muggles, calling for a return to the wizarding community alone, for a limit on interaction with them. It wasn't quite the supremacist rhetoric of a decade ago, but it shared many of the same arguments and made many people uncomfortable, Draco included.
"Even after seven years, it's still strange to me," Callum admitted to Harry as he met his eyes. "He's... pretty terrifying, in real life, isn't he? But after sex, after the scenes, he becomes this cuddly, vulnerable, dependent man. It must be weird for you to see him like that."
"See, Baby Dom," one of the older men said to Harry, "that kind of smile means you're going to have a sore dick for a week."
Lucius had sent him a list of crimes. That he had committed.
"Do you miss her? His mum?" asked Teddy to Draco.
And the best was yet to come: the article was actually about Astoria's arrest in 2002. During the trial of an Irish Pureblood wizard who had repeatedly raped her son as a child, Astoria had stabbed the rapist in the eye with a well-aimed spell when he had told the whole court that he didn't understand the problem, and that it had always been ignored in his social circle. She had gotten out of jail without a sentence, but it had led to a few articles and a photo of Malfoy coming to pay her bail, leaving the court with his wife on his arm. Harry could clearly see the glint of pride he was trying to hide.
Once he was satisfied with his slave's state, Harry untied him and helped him to his feet. His legs looked unsteady, and he was devastatingly good-looking. "What are my duties for the evening, Master?"
"Honestly, I'm not that surprised," replied Hermione.
Sometimes one of his limbs or muscles would move of its own accord in his restraints, as if by reflex, but beyond that, Draco surrendered. If not for the "good boy" and "you're simply perfect" regularly slipped in his ear that made him shiver, for the feeling of absolute relaxation that won him over in pain. The real pain was nothing compared to the panic. To the ghosts of past pain. Draco felt himself returning to his body, reclaiming it, while it was Nikolaj who was using him, controlling it, taking possession of Draco.
"He's a lawyer now. But he went to medical school, yes. Twelve years as a surgeon at St Mungo's."
She remembered being in his shoes. The worry. The unpredictable daily routine. The constant anxiety that you weren't allowed to show too much to others. The others always assumed that because he was Harry Potter, he was safe. Ginny disagreed.
"I'm so proud and grateful to be with you," Harry told him. "I don't want to hide anymore. And that's not my cock talking."
"You don't need anything?"
No matter how hard Draco looked at the problem, his brain was unable to comprehend Harry as anyone other than his boyfriend. It wasn't for lack of trying. But Harry was not a Dom. Harry was not a lover. Harry was not an ex. Harry was not a friend. He was special. When he wasn't around, a small part of Draco was always on the alert, waiting for him. When he arrived, every instinct in Draco told him how much he needed Harry Potter. It might have been different if Harry had left when Draco broke up with him, or if he had continued to treat Draco like a boyfriend instead of distancing himself slightly - that would have made Draco angry because Harry didn't respect his decisions. But as it was, Harry had been nothing but perfect. How could Draco stop being madly in love with him? He was simply unable to keep him away.
"It's not that I think Muggles would necessarily raise wizards badly. Some children preferred to go to their Muggle families when they could, and they are fine with it. All I wanted was a welcoming place for those who didn't feel comfortable with Muggles. Some people are a bit scared of wizarding children. Some people get downright jealous of them, or hate them. This is a real danger. Hence the orphanage, yes."
"You know, for a long time since things went south with Ginny, I've been terrified of this day coming. I imagined her with a better husband than me, delivering a perfect little baby, all the Weasleys coming to congratulate her, and me getting drunk in a corner to forget what a failure I was. And now that day has come, and... I don't care. I don't care at all. No jealousy. No regrets. No anger. No self-hatred. All I could think about was crossing my fingers that I wouldn't have to see her vagina. And coming back to you."
"See? Already Gryffindor reflexes are grasping me from all sides. You've rubbed off on me."
"It's February, baby."
After his birthday party, he couldn't wait to get home. He needed sex. He planned to put on his most Dom outfit, follow in Callum's footsteps and find a little sub to play with. Nothing too fancy, he wasn't qualified for that yet. But he wanted to be and would be. The power, the calm, the absolute control of the club's Doms appealed to him to the point of physical pain. He'd always been very commanding in bed, even more so since his divorce when he'd really let loose, but
"Do I please you?"
Draco looked up from the tickets at Harry.
"Who?"
Harry burst out laughing and rubbed the tip of his nose against Draco's cheek. "I'm happy if you like him."
"The solstices and equinoxes are the four landmarks of the traditional wizarding calendar," Draco explained as they walked through the forest. "Many potions and spells are only possible in certain quarters of the year, or specifically on the days of the equinoxes and solstices. These are the days when the potion masters have the most work to do. This is partly why Purebloods rarely work professionally in potions: all the important festivals and celebrations fall on days when the employed potions masters have to work."
"Sure. It's certainly big enough."
One day, at the end of November, Harry was held up on the field and he urged Draco not to waste his evening when the babysitter was working and to spend the night with Callum.  They apparently found time to plot in between their intense BDSM programme, because the following Saturday they had an idea in mind. Harry, Draco and Thomas came to Callum's house to enjoy his very, very well equipped basement.Callum had reconfigured a rather unremarkable cellar into three S&M rooms, including a dungeon that curiously reminded Harry of Hogwarts. "Orion and I realised that there was one thing you two had never experienced," Callum explained.
She hesitated, taking a sip of wine. "Did Harry tell you a little about  what you might find in the files...?"
Harry knew exactly what had happened. The whole department had been thinking 'damn, it's Harry's boyfriend', and Ron had been the one person perceived as unlikely to be murdered or bribed by Harry to tip the investigation in Draco's favour. Harry was willing to admit that he had been a little defensive this past month, very protective of Draco and not tolerating anyone talking against him around him. But that didn't mean his entire department should be afraid of him...
After the tour of the Reserve, Krzyszek invited them to his home. They still had two hours before they had to go back to look after Scorpius, and Harry was curious to find out how a Dragonologist lived.
. Callum smiled at him, "Like we're fish? Or like some kind of magical underwater kingdom?" Draco held up two fingers. "Magic kingdom it is. I'll probably spout some Muggle nonsense about my vision of Atlantis and mermaids - don't blame me." Callum continued to tap Draco's thigh with a perfectly even rhythm. Draco held that outstretched arm with both hands, the muscles bulging under the tanned skin. Callum's other hand was busy lightly stroking Draco's shoulder, his face, his hair. Callum guided him into hypnosis. Draco was so deep in it that he almost believed they were, indeed, in the sea world Callum had fantasised and described.
"I'm sorry," said Draco. "I shouldn't have spoken to you like that."
Draco just snuggled up to Harry. He still felt too good to think, but whatever he chose when he came to his senses, it would be a beautiful evening.
Draco blinked at him, but Harry seemed confident in his choice.
"Well, it was very real to me. Getting married was our decision, not our parents'. We admired each other. I thought she was so stunning, so elegant and self-assured, and beautiful. We had common passions and similar views of the world. We loved spending time together. I adored coming home in the evening to her. We often slept in the same bed. I liked waking up with her, and talking to her, and we cooked together, and..." He paused.
Harry took a deep breath. Total honesty. They had promised each other. Anything they could say to each other, they would say to each other. It had always worked so far.
Finally, I haven't forgotten the readers who are thirsty for small details: in this chapter, Callum reveals that his boyfriend is called Benjamin. It's the same Benjamin that introduced Harry to the BDSM scene the very first time Harry came to Bound Gods (yes, the tattooed man with the trans flag t-shirt)!
. We all won. If Voldemort had won, we'd
After the meeting, Ron invited him to lunch at the Pakistani place where they often went before Rose was born. Harry wasn't too keen - he'd planned to get Lola to find out where Draco was going to eat lunch and surprise him there. Never mind. He hadn't seen his friends for a long time, so he didn't have the heart to say no.
But he heard a few things. He heard when the old President of the Constitutional Court asked Harry who this beautiful little man was, and he proudly replied, "He is my son and Draco Malfoy's. His name is Scorpius."
"Is he coming to see his papa?" the doctor on duty asked affectionately, passing by on her morning rounds.
Callum didn't stop telling the story until Draco had fallen asleep.
"Of course I do."
Draco hated himself.
Many thanks to the first reviewers. You brighten my days.
Harry shook his head. He told Benjamin and Callum his idea in their ears. They burst out laughing. "By all the founders of Hogwarts, Callum, if you let him do something stupid..."
"I want to try. And if you tell me you don't, I'll have to use the magic card."
Harry hesitated for a long moment in the upstairs corridor. Was it better for him to sleep in a spare room, or with Draco? The bed wasn't very big, and he might be disturbed by Harry, as he needed some rest for the few hours before a long day of work at Sectumsempra. But Draco had often told him that he did not like to sleep alone...
"You're a good father," Molly said as she stared at the beans, repeating the same gesture. "You've gotten everything under control." Even cleaning the kitchen while having a professional meeting, apparently.
Draco put the newspaper on his bedside table instead of giving it back to Callum. He wanted to read it again. To think about it. Callum did not ask him to return it. Didn't ask for his opinion on it. But he looked at Draco with a small smile that said it all.
"Very well. As it is, of course, it would only be temporary custody while Draco regains his full capabilities. During that time you will have sole custody of Scorpius and the right to make all decisions regarding his life. Should Draco die, I will file the official adoption papers. In that case, all of Mr Malfoy's property and assets, including the castle in Provence, the London house and of course his business, will revert to you until his son comes of age. One last thing. I have a letter for you."
Harry could see that Draco was trying to prolong the blow job. He grinned stupidly in his direction, equally thrilled at the thought of the night ahead of them. Starting with an orgasm was a good idea, or Harry would have quickly felt like he was about to explode.
Draco woke up early, out of habit. They had moved in the night, and it was no longer Harry in his arms but the other way around. He was surrounded by an aura of tranquility and security. He tried to wriggle out of the embrace, but Harry grunted and tightened it. "Don't move," he asked in Draco's ear. "I'm in deep concentration." Draco smiled, puzzled, and craned his neck to try and see Harry's face. His eyes were closed, his eyebrows a little furrowed.
"Damn Slytherins..." sighed Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nodded and tilted his chin.
But now Draco was a little, just a little bit less angry with Jules, and it was suddenly much, much harder to bear his presence, especially after the long confession he had just made. Draco had never thought he'd say that to anyone - it wasn't even his secret to tell. But he had no choice. A suspicion of necromancy, from a former Death Eater... It would have been prison, if the French authorities had wanted to act. And Draco certainly couldn't go to jail. Not now that there was Scorpius. His higher loyalty would always lie with his son.
"What's your problem, Ginny? I'm not asking you why Euan is better than me or why he makes you happier than I did." Her face darkened. She didn't say anything. Was she... was she unhappy with Euan? They'd had a baby early on, yes, but they seemed to get on well, from what Harry had seen. But her expression was obvious to Harry. And Ginny saw that he understood. Oh. They weren't that happy, then. That probably explained his ex-wife's sudden anger.
"Okay. If you want to go alone, go alone. Daddy and I are watching you."
"Sectumsempra continued experimenting with the Orbs. We tried to take it to the next level and remove all the magical rays, all the magical aura of the person. This generation of Orbs, like the one in your hand, suppresses all the magical vibrations that naturally radiate from a wizard at all times."
"St. Louis Hill?" read Draco. "That's my neighbourhood."
"Only if they can prove that you individually made the decision to hire him. If they don't find a clear culprit..."
"Rose is coming?" exclaimed Scorpius.
Harry reassured him. Harry hugged him.
"I don't know if it's a good conversation to have."
As Draco felt himself about to cum, Callum thrust one last time into him and pulled out. The sudden loss of penetration made Draco want to cry.
No, Draco didn't know that. On second thought, it wasn't totally delusional. Most of the greatest wizards in English history were Slytherins. And if Harry had managed to win against Voldemort, he couldn't have been 100% Gryffindor blood.
"I'm starving," Draco explained. "Do I get one Malfoy move, or are you two going to tease me for the rest of my life?"
"A bit. You lost four babies."
They were so cute together that Callum had to keep from smiling in their presence. At work, Draco would talk to him about Harry with heart-shaped eyes. At parties, Harry would talk to him about Draco with heart-shaped eyes. They were dancing around each other. They provoked each other. They fell into each other's arms. Since he was with Harry, Draco was dazzling.
Someone had tried to kill him. Had locked him in his mind.
"You saw Scorpius?"
They had Scorpius. A little sun. He walked and tried to run and wanted to see everything and know everything and touch everything. He still preferred Draco for cuddles before bed. But he always called Harry "Daddy". He would ask him to sing. His favourite was when both Draco and Harry played with him at the same time - then he was ecstatic. He often hiccupped because he was laughing so hard.
December was freezing that year. It snowed almost every day.
"Ah... We use a variant of Veritaserum on them during their psychological examinations. It's not... ideal, but the Ministry refuses to let such radical young people loose."
They entered the water basin. Harry knew that the enchanted boat was floating somewhere in the middle of the lake-like expanse of water, on a predefined and secure route, surrounded by spells that kept them safe, kept them from getting wet, kept them breathing. But lying there, they could not see the boats in front or behind them. And they could not foresee the scenery, the creatures that would appear a little further on. Harry lost himself in contemplation: the blackness before them, and the vague glow of the surface hundreds of metres above. Phosporescent corals and strange algae lit up the depths. First they saw luminescent jellyfish, hundreds and hundreds of them. Harry reasserted his grip on Draco's shoulders and gently stroked his face with his other hand. They remained in silence throughout the journey through the deepest part of the great lake, pointing at distant creatures.
"I would define 'being together' as being in love. Spending free time together. Having plans," he clarified.
Harry cast a sobriety charm on himself, and when Draco nodded, on him too.
There, that was said.
"So all three of you have broken the law for me."
"Got any triggers in particular, Harry? Anything I should know about? It's not going to give you hallucinations or anything, just illusions of sensation."
Draco nodded and forced himself to be calm as the doctor pointed his wand at his stomach, closing his eyes. His shirt and jumper seemed a weak shield, but he was glad to have them anyway - he didn't know how Muggle women got their bellies rubbed half naked.
Draco Malfoy had turned his brain inside out.
"I'd like to see a kitten. The one without magic? It was white."
"What do you mean?"
He wondered what time Potter would be home from his disastrous birthday party. His penis perked up at the thought. Draco was hot. He hadn't had the opportunity to do this sort of spontaneous things since Scorpius had come into the picture.
Harry cleaned and dried them with a wave of his wand. Draco was as pliant as a melted marshmallow and followed Harry very obediently when his Dom took his hand and led him back to the house, levitating the leftover wine behind them. Their clothes were folded on an armchair, and Draco retrieved the wrapped Orb from Harry's pocket and carefully replaced it in his own so as not to forget it, while Harry went to the kitchen. He returned levitating a tray of unusual fruit juices, including a clementine/coconut water/ginger which Draco politely begged for. The sugar in the fruit was perfect after a scene, but it wasn’t caloric enough to make him panic – did Harry know that? Harry served it to him.
"A bit lonely, but very lovely. I'll show you the photos when I get them printed."
"Was that... was that the illegal thing you told me about that you couldn't share with me?" Harry asked softly, resting his ass on the corner of his desk.
Draco closed his eyes.
Harry felt angry. He looked up at Draco, face tense. "I know what I want. No one can say it for me. Not even you."
"But no one knows how I got into this situation" Blaise continued, ignoring him. "We were playing the 7 Truths game in the dorm when Draco got the card asking him his 'overwhelming desire that he can't quite understand'."
He could count on one hand the number of times he'd heard Draco talk about Astoria to Scorpius. If she had died shortly after giving birth to him, wouldn't he have been more keen to pass on her memory?
"Wait a moment."
"Uh... Yes. Yeah."
Draco looked at the small drawing of an otter with a lightning bolt scar on its forehead, and smiled contentedly. Once he had served him his tea, Harry took the gift box from his desk and opened it. It was a black leather-bound book, a gem in Draco's eyes. The majority of the pages were black and white photographs - it was a Muggle book, but Draco didn't find their stillness a fault. The angle, the light, the composition of the pictures was a Muggle art that the wizards knew nothing about but that Draco had learned to appreciate.
"You want me to send your mother an owl?"
"That's right, sir."
"Go tell that to the reporters waiting outside the Ministry. I don't even dare cross my colleagues in case they ask me if it's true."
Harry ran his fingers over the blond pubic hair. And gently over his satisfied, flaccid cock. "No. No, not tonight."
"Finally something you're not very good at."
Draco shook his head. "No, it wasn't why."
"Me."
Draco went home. It was suspiciously quiet.
Harry took his hand and kissed it.
They lay in bed, sticky, and kissed for a while, catching their breath. Blaise found his wand somewhere under the pillows to wipe away the semen, the sweat, the saliva. His spells were precise and of excellent quality, and left no unpleasant impression on Harry's body. "Thank you," he said. "I'm in no condition to shower."
Harry will protect him.
Draco texted Madeleine to see if she could spend the night at his house. She was doing a Netflix marathon and replied that she would be very happy to move it to Draco's massive living room screen. Draco smiled at her answer, made her some popcorn in advance and went to change.
Blowjobs in the 69 position, lazy and generous, accompanied by lots of sighing.
"Shh. Let's not talk about that. You have all the time you want, love. Take all the time you like. We'll speak of it in due course."
"A quiet one."
Mostly Harry and Draco were going to show Teddy the progress of their new house - but no one knew about it yet. Teddy was starting to get anxious about going to Hogwarts, according to Andromeda. Harry thought that if his godson knew that he could spend weekends with him from time to time, he would be less scared.
Harry sipped his tea. He seemed to be thinking fast. Draco admired his ability to remain entirely professional. He looked older and more powerful in his big chair as quasi-head of the Aurors.
"It's sunny. May I go fly with my cousins?"
"It happened in Diagon Alley. A large team is on site, we don't know much..."
Harry dug deeper into his research on Jules. The little royal bastard didn't even have a surname. The press called him Prince Jules. He had a list of titles as long as the arm, underneath his identification papers elegantly embellished with a 'Jules de France'. He wasn’t the crown prince, but one of the grandsons of the Wizard King of France all the same. He was 31. Harry probably shouldn't have consulted the international civil registry just to satisfy his curiosity. It was unprofessional and even rather illegal. And creepy.
Harry listened intently, almost seeming to hold his breath.
Draco crushed Harry's socked toes with one of his shoes and Harry smiled boldly. "First of all: no, who do you think I am? I told you this man literally saved my life. Secondly, it wasn't the kind of break-up where you throw plates at each other. At the beginning of Sectumsempra, we worked all the time. I was away all day looking for locations, recruiting candidates, finding investors, getting loans... And he was in the lab all day or learning more about magic from the very first wizards we employed, figuring out what their first orientations would be. I started to manage on my own, to find my independence, to dare to meet wizards again. I think... I think Assane liked me better when I was a helpless little thing, a survivor of a cult, a little wizard lost in the big Muggle world. When I didn't viscerally need him anymore, he kind of... lost interest."
"Alright," he said with a smile, trying to make Draco understand that it wasn't a big deal at all. "Not in your house. At my place, if you want. You know where to find me."
"To the nearest Muggle pet shop, then?" he asked.
"You handled those bloody journalists like I never did. They were polite! They respected the precise moment they were allowed to take pictures! And the restaurant staff didn't even try to record or photograph us without our knowledge..."
Harry didn't understand much French, apart from the fact that Draco’s voice was hot as hell.
"What? I'm curious, yes, I admit it. I don't know anything about it. It could be fun."
Harry hoped that this way, Draco wouldn't feel pressured and that he would wait for the time when he was truly ready, and not do it early just to please him. It was easy to tell your partner "no need for a condom" in the heat of the moment. Getting up one morning and, alone in the bathroom, not taking his potion was something else. More thoughtful, calm, safe. Harry wanted Draco to make the best of it.
"Yes," opined Daphne Greengrass, a little surprised.
Draco was slowly waking up according to the doctors, but the progress wasn't obvious. Harry thought he could see or feel his fingers moving a few times, but it was so faint and he was looking forward to it so much that he didn't know if it was his imagination.
"You are mine. You will always be mine. You could end it. You are only here because you want to be here, because you are crazy about me, because you love to be at my feet and worship my body. You are here as long as you want to be. But I know you will always want to. And that you won't stop it. I'll be the last man in your life. Because I'll take care of you, pet. I'll drive you crazy. I'll leave you pining. I'll satisfy you violently. I'm going to surprise you. I'm going to do the right thing, to be worthy of a treasured little slave like you. You are mine, and I intend to give you all the pleasure and pain you could possibly wish for, all the days of our lives. I will be your last lover, because I will know you so well, make love to you so well, torment you so well, that I alone will haunt your mind and make you hard on command." Draco was painfully erect in his tiny white panties, and he seemed to be struggling to breathe. "But today, I want to know what it would have felt like to be your first."
"I'll go," said Draco.
Harry thought for a moment, and accepted the idea that Callum was not an adversary on the love front. But on the rest...
He rang the bell. Draco came out with Scorpius propped up against his hip. "Still got your old Seeker reflexes, Potter?" he shouted.
By the fifth blow, Draco was in tears. But he kept his eyes wide open, watching in the mirror. It took a long time to get all the wax off his back, his buttocks and his legs. At one stage he stopped crying, too tired or too far into subspace. Later he began to cry again, to scream. "Stop!" he shouted.
Frustrated, hard, drunk and tired, Draco decided to show him the extent of his impatience by straddling Blaise - who had stayed for 'a bit', the man had an eye - and slowly french-kissing the hell out of him. He hadn't touched Blaise like that for years. He had the most satiny skin he'd ever felt.
Harry listened carefully. He was all too aware of this; it had been the problem he'd faced with Liam.
In the comment section you will find the list of Harry and Draco's 77 hastily thought-out wedding vows, and a comment listing some of the clues left in the story as to Scorpius' conception.
"Can't I do anything?" asked Callum.
Harry watched Draco Malfoy cook in the Muggle way in his kitchen as one would watch the apparition of the Virgin.
Harry kissed his hair. The gesture surprised Draco, directly in front of his friends. His ex-wife's brother.
"I've realised I don't know you," Draco said. "I know the broad strokes of your story, and I know your body and its effect on me, but... you're a stranger. And I to you. I'm not the man I was at Hogwarts, or during the war. Neither are you, probably, or you wouldn't be divorced from Ginny Weasley, you wouldn't be going to gay bars or the BDA, and you wouldn't have slept with me knowing it was me."
Harry made a scandalized pout.
"I could take him to the hospital," Harry understood.
"So I figured there weren't enough blonds in the house..." said Harry with a shadow of a smile.
The castle was, if possible, more glorious than Harry remembered. He had never been back after the funeral ceremonies. There had been anniversary commemorations, but the ones at Hogwarts... Harry hadn't been able to attend.
"You don't have to see her."
Draco stepped into the warmth of the house. He set the bag down in the doorway, and used both arms to hug Scorpius's sleeping little body. "Sit down, dear," said Molly. "I'll make some herbal tea."
"You're a tattoo artist, then?" asked Draco of Thomas.
Harry gripped the intangible hands tighter. Draco saw his movement, even though he couldn't feel it.
"You didn't tell me Papa could talk," Harry reproached Scorpius with a funny face, and the baby laughed, reaching for him.
"You two play, if you like," Draco added.
Draco's eyes were unfocused, and he was curled up in a ball on the sofa. Salem was licking his hand. "I'll be fine," he assured Harry as he petted the cat, but it sounded more like a question than a certainty.
"Can we borrow him, Callum?"
"Well the basic principle of Sectumsempra involves at least some of the magical employees being well versed in Muggle science, and at least some of the Muggle employees knowing about the existence of magic. For this, normally, you either have to have wizards in your family or to marry a wizard. The Department of Justice has long made an exception for long-term couples, relying on case law from 1955 that a Muggle has the right to know about magic before marriage, to make an informed choice. But Sectumsempra has asked for an interesting exception for same-sex mixed couples. They would like the ones in their company to be given exceptional permission to inform the Muggle partner of the existence of magic. Can you imagine that up until now there has been no legal provision for a gay wizard to tell his Muggle partner who he is, since they can't get married, even if they've been together for 30 years? The same goes for lesbians. Technically, that would be a violation of the Statute of Secrecy!"
So Draco refrained from asking if it was true. "So the plan is not to eat today?" he asked instead.
Draco shouted at him, his face twisted with rage. "I know what this is!" He stormed pass them, his hands clenched to fists, shaking with anger.
By the time for lunch, Harry was
"Thanks", Harry said with a smirk before George moved to shake Draco's hand.
ashamed of you and I
"Would you like that?" Harry murmured.
"It is", Harry said confidently, turning towards the crowd again. He let his gaze travel around the hall, seeing lots of familiar and not so familiar faces waiting on their seats.
"Sounds good", Draco said. "Want some company?"
"Yeah", he said with a nod before letting go of his hand, hesitating. "I... guess I should... thank you", he finally added. "For listening." He turned his gaze towards Harry's door, avoiding eyecontact. "And for not laughing at me. I can't believe I told you all that stuff about me..."
"You were worried?" Draco snarled, rolling his eyes again. "What a joke!"
"Okay...? See you in the morning?" Hermione called out after him with a worried look on her face.
"It was", Harry said. "You know how much she hates you! She
sorry, Ginny, but I can't go on with you anymore. There is... someone else that I..." He lowered his face, staring at his feet instead of his girlfriend. "...that I want to be with."
He turned to Draco, a small smile rising to his lips. "I can't believe we actually just got
He had been so sure that they were going to spend the rest of their lives together. Harry had already proposed to him and they had been supposed to get married soon, they'd already started planning their wedding, they had even talked about
Draco was now looking at his fiance with wide eyes, his jaw wide open.
"If only things were different, you know...", Harry sighed. "But they're not..."
"I... I don't know", Harry grunted, feeling disoriented.
", Malfoy said with a snort. "The one who killed Voldemort. No one cares. It's different."
do it. I don't know what's wrong but it just doesn't feel right."
"Wanna talk about it?" Malfoy finally asked.
They all sighed heavily and entered their bedrooms. Harry quickly changed to his pyjamas and went to bed, closing the curtains around it.
Harry couldn't. He finally got his pyjamas on and was starting to get up, but was immediately stopped by the Slytherin's hand that landed on his shoulder.
Harry gave a nod. "Yes. That was my last case."
After the portrait door closed after Ginny, he suddenly remembered he wasn't alone in the room.
"And you won't either?" Harry still insisted.
"Uh...", was all that Harry was able to come up with, staring at the Slytherin. Now that he was standing there, he didn't know what to say anymore. "Could I have a word with you, Malfoy...?"
"Draco! Don't go!"
"Whoa. I must say I'm surprised. This is... okay", Malfoy said. He wasn't quite able to hide his disappointment for not being able to belittle him at all like he had certainly been looking forward to do. After all, the man was Draco Malfoy who still very much enjoyed tantalizing and boasting whenever he got the chance, even if he wasn't as mean as he used to be in the past.
gay, I don't think he would say no to Theo."
"I... don't know", he finally muttered. "To be honest with you, I don't know if it's working between us anymore, so..."
"That's what I've been thinking", Harry admitted. "All we do is argue and no matter how many times we make up, nothing ever changes. It's not how it's supposed to be. I think it's wise to finally call it quits."
"Well… I'm not going to lie. You can be quite big-headed and very, very annoying at times, but I don't hate you… Because I know now that deep down you're not a bad person", Harry answered. Malfoy's teary eyes were now boring into his own and Harry felt himself drowning in them, once again. His eyes were like the color of gathering storm clouds in the sky with a silvery glint, full of restrained emotion…
"Thank you", Harry said, smiling warmly.
Harry curiously unwrapped the gift paper, revealing a small black box inside. Frowning, he took the lid off, instantly gasping in confusion.
At first they hung around at Grimmauld Place, just relaxing and enjoying each others company. Harry loved talking with Draco, at the same time getting to know him even better. For example, Harry had known that Draco liked reading, but he hadn't known what kind of books the blond preferred the most. He hadn't known that Draco's favourite colour, instead of black that he usually loved to wear, was actually white. He hadn't known that after they were going to graduate, Draco was planning to move to London as well and get his own flat. There were a lot of things he hadn't known about the Slytherin and he wanted to learn every single detail about him.
"Tell me about it", Blaise snorted, shaking out his hand. "I can't even feel my hand anymore!"
They were sitting in silence for a good while, both deep in their own thoughts, just staring at the fireplace until the silence was interrupted. There was a sudden sound in the back of the room and they both quickly turned to look behind them.
about having sex with someone else than to
Malfoy stayed quiet for a while. "Yeah", he then finally agreed, turning around without another word. He headed towards the bedroom corridor, throwing one last quick look at him from the door, and then he was gone.
"I like that", he answered, flashing a smile back. "So, you ready to go,
Harry wasn't sure where he should start from, so he decided to just ask the question that crossed his mind first.
He could picture it in his mind. Malfoy walking along the lakefront with Theodore, hand in hand… Malfoy looking at Theodore, a blissful smile on his perfect, pink lips, his beautiful eyes glimmering in the sunset… Malfoy kissing with Theodore under the same tree where he had been sitting with Harry weeks ago…
"What?" he asked.

"Calm down, Theo", Blaise said, roughly leading his angry boyfriend towards the living room with Greg's help. "Violence won't solve anything. Besides, if anyone has the right to kill Potter, it is Draco. Not you."
"Ginny, we need to talk", he said. All warmth was completely gone from his voice.
him was the last one on his mind.
Harry nodded. "Yes", he said like it was not a big deal at all. "He asked me to go flying yesterday."
After he and Draco had started dating openly his life had changed to a lot better. Of course people had first been glaring at them and talking shit about them a lot. Also, they had soon been on the front page of the Daily Prophet as well - just like Harry had figured that they would:
"So? You eat way too much sugar, Ronald", Hermione said with a heavy sigh, shaking her head.
Harry watched their entwined hands for a while and finally lowered his gaze back to his notes.
Instead of Theodore, however, he saw both Ron and Hermione coming in, and from the looks on his friend's faces he knew they had heard about him and Draco.
Harry became even more absent and quiet. He hardly smiled or laughed anymore, mostly he was angry or looked really tired or sad. His work days became even longer and longer, he went to sleep earlier, and he showed even less interest in being close to Draco as well.
in Draco's opinion. Draco had turned out to be a gourmand when it came to sweet treats, and it made Harry smile.
"I now present to you, the newly married Harry and Draco Potter", Rivers announced loudly in a happy, warm tone. "You may kiss."
"Well, how was it?" Draco asked with a smile on his lips, stroking Harry's messy fringe gently with his fingers.
"Then fucking PROVE IT!"
Ron gave him a weird look. "You spent the rest of the night with
Malfoy looked surprised. "You wanna play again?" he asked, raising his eyebrow.
, not Theodore.
them!"
about this, I
Malfoy snorted. "Good grief, Potter! Never in a million years", he said. It made Harry laugh and he could see Malfoy's lips curve into a smile too.
And believe it or not, they really did talk that night, even though at first the conversation was very, very uneasy. In the end, they ended up talking for hours.
"See you at school", Draco said abruptly, leaving Harry to stare at his back as he walked away, not even once glancing back at him.
Harry was quiet. His eyes followed as his best friend passed the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables from the front of the Staff table and headed towards Malfoy and Goyle. Soon Ron was already leaning over the Slytherin table, covering Harry's view so that he wasn't able to see the two Slytherins anymore. Harry, feeling very restless at the moment, quickly forked a piece of lamb to his mouth. He was staring at Ron's back, wondering what the heck took him so long.
"Oh yeah. Now's the time for the
Draco didn't embarrass him by insisting on his admiration. He supposed that being... close to Harry Potter meant being frequently dumbfounded by his ease of using magic, and learning to pretend not to be.
"Tell me, gorgeous."
"No, you were right, but... it's just the Manor. I don't know how I'm going to react when I see it again. What about you, will you be okay?"
Harry grabbed his hair and pulled him back hard. "What on earth are you doing, Mr Malfoy? That is strictly forbidden by the school rules. What a naughty boy you are. I'm going to have a word with the Headmistress about that."
"About a month ago, when he last updated his arrangements."
"This morning we were called by a jeweller in Diagon Alley because of a confrontation in his shop. We found Malfoy and the other suspect unconscious on the floor. Witnesses saw the suspect throwing curses at Malfoy, but they also saw Malfoy set the suspect on fire. According to them, the suspect cast a final curse on Malfoy before losing consciousness from the burns. The suspect's robes and skin melted together..." Ron cringed.
"The Aurors didn't let any information slip through," Zabini replied cautiously. "The press is just speculating."
Sex with Draco was another plane of consciousness, was out of this universe, but his family would always come first in his priorities. Family was all he wanted. The meaning he wanted to give to his life. What he felt he was on earth for. Right now it was Draco and Scorpius, and of course the Weasleys and all the rest of his family. But to expand his little family with his husband... He would do literally anything. Anything at all.
"Good boy," Harry murmured as Draco laid his head on his chest, gently resting his hand on Harry's belly, and no lower, not trying to rub his lovely body at him either, or make him feel his probable erection.
"There are things from the war that I remember as if I had been told it happened to someone else. But this scene is still engraved in my memory. I remember your voice. You looked terrified. When they tried to attack me, you shouted to your mates "Don't kill him! DON'T KILL HIM!"."
"Can you hold me?"
Inside, Harry found himself alone with an employee who was naked except for a leather harness and small white wings that wriggled on his back. His cheekbones were covered in blue glitter.
Those words disarmed him even more.
"Et pour te répondre, c’était à cause de ses parents, évidemment. Pour connaître un peu Lucius, j’avais peur que tu tombes sur un cadavre décapité dans un placard ou dans leurs donjons en jouant à cache-cache. Pourquoi ?"
Harry stood up and picked up the strap again. He turned the last of the cold wax from Draco's body into miniature black snowstorms that swirled around the room. His sub's skin, now free of all black, was not white. It was pink, and red, and purple. Harry stood in front of the mirror and jerked his cock, in full view of Draco. After only four or five flicks of his wrist, he covered his sub's back and buttocks with cum. "Thank you," Draco whispered, exhausted. Harry smiled.
"Are we anywhere near Hogsmeade?" guessed Draco as he looked around the landscape. His stomach tightened a little. He hoped Harry wasn't planning on getting too close to Hogwarts. He wasn't sure he was ready for that. Too many bad memories.
"Do you know why we've been invited today?"
"You're really serious!" exclaimed Ron, who was making his daughter jump on his lap.
The Aurors looked at each other awkwardly, no one daring to elaborate. Harry didn't have time for this.
"Eleven o'clock. We went to bed late."
"Hell and damnation, so he'll spend a good half hour hard and unable to get any relief. Just like he makes you feel on a daily basis. We'll see if he gets any compassion from that."
"There was honestly no way I was going to get away from your glorious body long enough to do it manually."
Harry frowned. Blaise got up to a switch on the wall. He flicked it and a few notes of music sounded in the receiver just above.
They had to take brooms in town to get there, as it was framed by anti-Apparition wards. It was a very long ride, despite their excessive speed. Flying in Poland was an incredible experience, because the wizarding cities there were miles away from any Muggle presence - they could fly as high or as fast as they wanted without having to make themselves invisible. They flew over the territories of several dragons from a distance and Krzyszek showed them around the nursery. Harry and Draco looked curiously at the intact eggs, the cracking eggs, and the tiny shapes that would become powerful dragons. Harry found himself hugging Draco from behind and kissing his ear while he was absorbed in watching three little green dragons struggling to eat small pieces of meat.
"At this stage, yes. He is beginning to regain his physical abilities. He moved his eyelids and fingers in the night. I thought I'd dreamed it, but that and the change in his vital signs... They say that's an excellent sign."
"First, a sacrifice to magic," Draco explained. "A part of you. It can be blood, hair, organs."
"I'm having contractions, but Euan is at the Asian Quidditch Championships, so by the time he finds a Portkey..." She panted a little and continued on towards the reception, Harry following suit. "How's Draco?"
From the way Harry looked at the child and his ex-wife, Draco knew he hadn't lied to him. It all meant nothing to him anymore.
Harry elbowed him.
Draco thought about it and finally shrugged his shoulders with a mischievous smile.
"Tell me."
Draco leaned into Harry's chest, lying on top of him. They kissed gently before Harry pushed him upright again.
On the way, he unlocked his mobile phone, gradually reconnecting to the outside world. He looked at the latest messages sent. Nikolaj had sent shortly after his arrival to Lola "I went home, see you tomorrow", to Madeleine "I'll be back late or not at all tonight. I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier", to which she replied "No problem, Draco! I'm staying at your place with Scorpius", and to Callum "it's Nikolaj. Draco Apparated to my house in a panic attack and hyperventilating, apparently subject to phantom pain from curses. I'll take care of him" and his address in case Callum saw fit to come. Callum had not replied. He was probably busy with his latest little sub, only switching off Dom's phone when he was in a scene or dealing with a panicking sub.
"But?" Harry insisted, as if the next part wasn't obvious.
"The Aurors think the group he's tracking may have had access to my magical signature via Legilimency."
"No one knows here but me, Draco. And no, I don't regret anything, calm down..."
Harry laughed and slid in behind him, spooning him, as the ad ended.
"If I ever want to propose to him, I'll have to get the Ministry of Magic to allow gay marriage first," Harry replied factually, knowing that on this point only wizarding law mattered to Draco. Then he fell silent and realised what he had just said.
Harry followed him into the shop.
He crouched in front of Malfoy and ran light fingers through his hair. Malfoy moaned, and the man insisted on a particular spot on his head, generating almost mewing sounds that made them smile.
"You said it was only done by misogynists and supremacists. I'm sure you're right about the past - you know the Pureblood milieu better than I do. But over the last twenty years or so, people have done it for love. Ordinary people. Ordinary families. They haven't had any particular problems."
"You're allowed to look, you know," she said gently.
first, of Scorpius, of how to help Draco, of how to make sure Scorpius got to experience the highlights of a little wizard's life and...
Satisfied with his answer, hydrated and safe, Draco fell asleep in Harry Potter's arms in the highest tower of Hogwarts.
"Papapapapapapa..."
Draco thanked Thomas warmly and began to explore the shelves. "Harry, help me choose." Harry wasn't much help, as he pressed himself against Draco's back to look with him and his erection distracted him more than anything else. But at the end Harry spotted a simple earring in the most expensive display, a small white gold loop with a dainty diamond-shaped emerald attached to it.
Callum stood up. Harry imitated him, and gave him a hug. Callum held him for several seconds. "I'd stay, but I have to go home. I left someone chained up in my basement."
A few weeks ago, while searching for a particular thong that was the only one Draco could possibly wear under a pair of particularly tight leather trousers, Draco had opened a certain drawer in his room. The one that held his collars. All the collars Callum had gifted him over the last ten years. There was leather, and suede, and vinyl, but mostly leather: nubuck, buffalo, lambskin. There had always been a special occasion. Draco had thought long and hard about it. About Callum. About Harry. Finally, a few days before tonight's dinner, Draco had put all the collars in that box. All but one, all but the one Callum had given him on the day they'd signed their first contract.
Harry reached out, and Draco gave him the Orb again, and Harry put it around his neck. It vibrated for a moment before settling, and Harry crinkled his eyes, getting used to the effect of being stripped of his magic.
"I'm sure it's not too late to find a solution, Professor. I'm willing to do anything to get you to raise the grade on my last paper a little. Anything at all."
"I don't think so."
"You're the one tying him up with the ropes," Ron commented to Harry, his eyes squinting. "Not him."
Months passed. Draco's body slowly healed. He and Harry had fewer and fewer nightmares, fewer and fewer anxiety attacks, until they disappeared completely without them even noticing.
Draco could have. But he was too genuinely moved. He gestured "no" with his eyes.
"It's true. I feel... alive." And coming from someone who had literally died one day, that was special. And Draco considered it too. Because Draco thought of everything. Draco respected his desires. Draco remembered what he liked, what he wanted, what he'd talked to him about once six months ago, that thing that had worked one day or that he'd disliked one day. Draco cared so much about him. Harry had never been taken care of like this. He hadn't had a father, or a mother, or siblings, and his wife, after growing up with six brothers, wasn't the mothering type. Draco was. Draco was a kissing, cuddling, cooking, massaging, encouraging kind of man. He dropped everything he was doing to take care of Harry, to pay attention to his day, his mood, his needs. "What did I do to deserve you, again?"
"Salazar help me, of course I can be blamed. Just because I've never killed anyone doesn't mean I'm innocent. Maybe if I hadn't been sorting through the papers I was asked to classify some day, someone would have escaped a raid. Maybe if I'd had the guts to sacrifice myself to kill a few werewolves in their sleep while they slept in
Draco smiled broadly and finished hanging camellias from an archway before jumping from the chair he was standing on and running towards him. His cheeks were a little flushed - from the sun? The excitement? Harry intercepted him and spun him around, holding him tightly in his arms and kissing him all over his beautiful face.
"I don't have your self-control."
"You do?"
"Ha ha."
Harry approached the entrance to Sectumsempra. It was a strange sight, for just in front of it the impact of the bomb seemed to have been very strong - there were no signs, no bins, nothing but desolation - but the building was perfectly intact. It was surrounded by thick semi-opaque layers that gave off a dangerous ringing sound. The shield was too thick to see inside. For the fifteenth time, Harry pressed the call button on his phone again. No one answered. But a text message appeared on his screen. Madeleine had asked them on their group chat if they knew where the scorpion plush was - she couldn't find it.
Once Harry had thanked them on Draco's behalf, the blond man said simply, "I think I'll go to sleep now, Harry. See you soon." The library disappeared. Harry found himself in front of the house again, but the door was closed. The building was fantastic. Sometimes Victorian, sometimes overgrown with vegetation, sometimes colourful. In many places it was in very bad shape. Boards were blocking off some of the windows, columns were crumbling like sand. Harry put an end to his spell.
And so Harry participated in his first ever double penetration, Callum under Draco, Harry on top. Draco was particularly stretched, the dildo having done its job, but still both men were well hung. The moment Harry penetrated him too, Draco broke his silence. He began to swear... in Muggle.The whole family and all of Jesus' apostles went through it, in imaginative metaphors. Callum did not ask him to be quiet. Somehow the cursing only added to Harry's excitement.
Tonight too, Julia was one of the people working at the reception. She didn't say anything, didn't even look at him insistently, but Harry knew at once that she remembered him and recognised him.
He was doing the dishes when his mobile rang.
"But we're not ordinary, Harry, that's the point. If I do it, it will be frowned upon. Don't you realise that?"
"You can challenge him, if you want. If you need that to trust him and see that he's willing to fight for you, that he's serious."
"Say something in Russian, Draco!" shouted one of the twins.
Draco let out an irrepressible laugh and kissed Harry's cheek as if he were an ignorant, naive, cute little creature before pulling him outside. He sped up as soon as he hit the pavement, and Harry sprinted to catch up with him after checking the wards around the house.
"I told you he was innocent."
Without thinking, he placed his clenched hand on Draco's thigh under the table. Draco took it nonchalantly, obviously trying to instil some relaxation, and refilled Harry's wine glass. Harry kissed his temple, staying close to his face for a few seconds to breathe in his scent.
He would relish being with Harry for as long as he could.
"That's not all," Harry said, biting his lip. Callum came out of the bathroom, but urged him on with a gesture, leaning against the window. "Blaise helped me hire wizard bodyguards. For Scorpius. And you. And me. We put together a team of ten. Eight men, two women. Some of them trained together in the same class at the Uzunovo Institute some fifteen years ago, others are a bit younger and English. They are all very experienced duelists in personal guard. I recruited some of them from the escorts of Black Magic courts. I watched them in training to select them. I'm pretty sure at least half of them are better wizards than me in defensive terms."
Harry prepared Callum with a generous dose of lube. He didn't even have to deal with his cock, which Callum was rubbing against the sheets. Draco's penis seemed very interested. Callum lazily lapped at his balls and wanked his cock.
wrote Draco, dumbfounded.
He found him in the kitchen, naked except for a small white apron that had belonged to Ginny and which Harry couldn't even remember where it was kept in the cupboards. Draco turned to stir the scrambled eggs and Harry had to consciously restrain himself from whistling as he caught sight of his muscular legs, the two bouncy shapes of his rosy buttocks above which the white bow was tied, his back where the cuts, which already looked in much better condition than yesterday, formed dotted lines following the pattern of his muscles, like the starry skies of Van Gogh's paintings.
The dining room was lit only by candles and a warm lamp on the chest of drawers containing the tablecloths. It was intimate. Harry complimented his cooking. "You always do the cooking," he remarked suddenly. "Tomorrow I'll be making dinner."
"He sensed something was going to happen to me?" asked Harry, hissing as his frown pulled at a cut on his forehead.
Draco opened his mouth, "He is gay?"
Draco made an 'L' with his hand.
"Traitors. All traitors..." whispered Draco.
It helped that the boats ahead and behind them, some twenty metres away, were occupied by their bodyguards. Harry was always on the alert in public, and he had expected to be very worried so soon after Draco's attack, but the presence of the very talented wizards calmed him. Harry had observed them all in action, but also personally faced them in close combat to test their abilities. He had kept bruises long enough to trust his employees. Ugh, his
"Is this too much?" asked Harry, panting. "Answer honestly."
"Do you prefer Nina or Madeleine today?"
"The difference is that you're talking about involving a child. That's selfish. Because we want a baby that looks like us, we should expose a child to suspicion, to shame, to being singled out, spied on...? You want Rita Skeeter to come out with articles on the mechanics of its conception, to bring out sources on the spell cast by evil Purebloods centuries ago, to conjure up theories of black magic, of..."
Draco pulled out his mobile with trembling hands. Callum did not answer. He called his specific Dom number. It went to voicemail too.
The judges returned. Draco thought he saw one of the men who made up the jury smiling quietly at him, but he wasn't sure.
"Yes, we are going to see Papa," Harry assured the baby.
"Mmh, I see... But where's the fun in that?"
Hermione yawned a little louder, and noticing that Rose had fallen asleep, looked at her for a moment with love.
In the autumn, Draco and Harry reflected. They had lived so much in the last few years. They had lived so much since they were born, in fact. For Harry, a traumatic childhood, and a war, and saving the world, and a marriage and a divorce, and a demanding career, almost daily life-threatening situations, and his depression, and meeting Draco. For Draco, being raised among dark wizards, and a war, abuse, exile, his business, his marriage, his son, Scorpius's allergy, and meeting Harry. For the two of them, their relationship, and the people who'd opposed it, and Dunne's attack, the hospital, and the explosion, and the revelations... For a long time, both of them had survived in a perpetual flight forward. In violent pleasures, a life on the fast track, because if they stopped, they would fall off. Like on a bicycle, from what Draco had understood of the strange device.
Draco smiled at his son's reaction, and did not insist on trying to get him to like the animal. Harry returned the baby to his grandmother and approached Draco alone, placing a calm hand on the horse's muzzle. It pushed against his palm, seeking a caress. "He's mine," Draco told him with a sunny smile. "I got him for my tenth birthday. I had..." Forgotten him? Draco didn't say. Not quite, apparently, since he had readily accepted his father's offer to ride for a while in the countryside.
"What are you getting at, Gin?"
Harry took his hand, wrapped him in a long cloak and ushered him to the wizarding house, to the room with the largest bed.
When Callum slipped away to the bathroom, Draco allowed himself to reach out to Harry with the hand that wasn't holding his tea. The dark-haired man smiled at him as if he'd been offered the moon, gently took his hand between his own and brought it to his mouth, kissing it and then holding it to his cheek. He had just shaved, it was perfectly smooth. Draco moved his knuckles slightly to enjoy the fresh smoothness. He knew he shouldn't have. It was cruel and far too close to a romantic gesture. But after the evening he'd had, he allowed himself to. He felt fragile. Not broken yet, but as if all the pieces of himself might suddenly implode if he wasn't enveloped properly.
The grounds were a few miles from the village, on the top of a hill. It was a vast expanse of grass and trees hidden from view by the forest. On one of the borders of the land, there was a small pond. It was all very green, a bit mysterious, with weeping willows, trees covered in ivy.
Surprisingly, Draco burst out laughing. Ginny smiled at him.
"You can always try, Professor."
"Scared, Potter?"
"I've just finished folding the laundry while I was waiting for you; it needs ironing. There's the upstairs bathroom to clean. And I had to tackle the public image department file in preparation for my interview in a few days."
"Go for the fourths."
"Oh yes. Something cold."
Harry pressed his nose against the pale neck, the Adam's apple, just above the collar. Draco was now completely surrounded, encased in Harry's magic. Harry could feel his whole body as if it had enveloped him, he could feel the soles of Draco's feet, his shoulder blades, his navel, his ears, their every movement, their shape, and the blood that circulated under his skin. And Draco's magic didn't stop him.
"I want a taste."
"What?" asked Draco, smiling sweetly. "You'll put up a force field around me? Knock on the door of every wizard in the world and tell them I'm a good guy now?"
At the highest point of the island, they joined hands and took one last look around.
Draco nudged him, but he couldn't help but smile. What an amazing idiot.
"Of course, the fact that he's a Muggle complicates things," Nikolaj added, "I've just filed the official request for him to be allowed into the hospital. It should take a few hours."
"Have you changed offices?" remarked Harry politely as his son was examined. Draco was tense.
"I don't understand. Doesn't he leave his son's custody to Lucius and Narcissa? Or to Scorpius' Greengrass grandparents?"
Draco spun around in the middle of the clover and daisy covered lawn. "Why?" he finally asked, a little unsettled. "Why here?"
"When can I see you again?" Harry asked.
He walked out of the office and down the corridors. He knew the Ministry like the back of his hand. He took a shortcut through a toilet, and a filing room, and took the back stairs instead of the lifts. He entered the Auror Department through the emergency fire exit. He was four rooms from the cells when he was intercepted. "Let me through." The two Aurors - his colleagues - looked at each other apprehensively, and raised their wands. Harry laughed. He silently disarmed them, sending their wands flying across the office, and continued forward before they had regained their composure. His magic was boiling. He disarmed his own colleagues, not hurting them, but preventing them from stopping him. He no longer needed his wand. His magic knew what he wanted - he wanted to pass. It did what was necessary for him to get through, making the wands fly in his path and creating a safe route, like a tunnel teeming with magic in which he could not be reached, for Harry to get to the cells. There were screams, he knew, but he couldn't hear them.
Harry cleared his throat and added, "And I mean... It's not dependent on the way things are between us. I care about you. And Scorpius is so lovely and... and he looks like you and... Even if things don't turn out the way we want them to for the two of us, I'll help you with the Orbs, I promise."
Besides, Narcissa would never hurt Draco. Absolutely never.
As you may have seen, this fic will probably have 20 chapters in total. I'm thinking of opening a series for 77 Wishes to add in some oneshots and probably a sequel, but the story will be perfectly self-sufficient and will close out all the developed story arcs.
Harry nodded. "Thomas had nothing to do with it. We were right."
And then they flew to Italy. They spent two weeks at Blaise and Pansy's estate. The property was rural and opulent, surrounded by vegetation and vineyards, with an infinity pool, and only a few minutes walk to the sea, a beach frequented almost exclusively by locals. The Muggle village nearby was very small, but its town centre was busy until late at night. The five of them would go for ice cream, bruchettas and pizzas and eat them on one of the beaches or at the port. They wore swimming costumes from morning to night, putting on loose, transparent, light-coloured clothes over them, like in the elegant French movies. Early in the morning, when Scorpius was still asleep, Draco and Harry went to the beach. It was still deserted at that hour, and the water was cool. They swam far out into the salt water until the lighthouse looked very small. They lay on the sand, out of breath, afterwards. Draco's hair was getting longer and longer and almost curled after the salty water. The drops glistened on his skin, which had tanned slightly from exposure to the sun. His muscles were gradually returning.
"We've never had the big exes talk together before," Harry mused. "That's weird."
"Aquaium!" exclaimed Scorpius, looking as far over the side of the ship as he could.
"What should I do if you have these pains one day while you're with me?"
"Teddy was born that way."
Papa froze. He crouched down and set Scorpius on his thigh, looking him straight in the eye. "What are you trying to tell me, baby?"
Harry and Draco ate, bickering and touching each other. Draco insisted that Harry should go for a nap, and they made their way to bed, but Harry insisted on looking at the photos taken that night together. Draco leaned into the crook of his shoulder to look at the small screen of the camera. Overall, there were photos taken on the spot, and others taken with considerations of light, perspective and angles that made them more like artistic photos.
"Nobody got your address. Harry gave us little bells to wave once in the Floo? They brought us here without us saying the address of the fireplace." Oh, Harry. That was a hell of a thing to ask the Ministry for, those bells. Draco smiled.
He was pregnant. He had succeeded.
"Legilimency?" guessed Harry. Draco nodded, obviously glad he didn't have to write the rest of the word. His fingers twitched. "Would it be possible?" Harry asked the doctors.
Scorpius watched them with squinted eyes. The expression reminded Harry of a young Draco Malfoy in deep thought and made him smile. "Daddy," Scorpius suddenly repeated amidst the twins' cries of joy.
"Differently with each one."
"Astoria is alive," confirmed Draco. "And extremely happy, as far as I know. She and Clara are very committed to women's rights, to the protection of children and animals. They must not be getting bored there."
"Wandering around your domain..."
Harry played with his coffee stirrer. He sighed and threw an  anti-listening dome around them, begging his tired body and tired mind not to make him burst into tears in the middle of the cafeteria. People were polite enough not to come and disturb them, but Harry knew they wouldn't be courteous enough to sell the information to the media if he broke down here.
“I’m really glad you didn’t die.” Hermione pulls away, her gaze shifting between Harry and Draco. “Both of you.”
Harry grins and bows dramatically, one arm across his stomach and the other thrown out to his side. “Of course, M’lady!” Harry straightens and takes Hermione’s arm in his own, hearing Draco laugh at his antics.
Yours sincerely,
The Hufflepuffs, true to their house’s nature, cheer right along with the Slytherins supportively.
“Damnit!” He whispers to himself. If only there was a way to get out of this house; A way to go to Hogwarts; A way to start living. But at this moment in time, escape seems so far away.
Petunia shoved her spatula into his hands, snapping him out of his thoughts. With this, Harry went over to the stove, flipping the eggs that are still cooking in the pan expertly. Cooking came naturally to Harry at this point. And why wouldn’t it? He had been cooking for the Durselys since he was 6 years old. Shaking his head, he puts those thoughts aside. ‘Best not think about it’ he thinks to himself.

When Harry was with his parents, he had only known love and laughter. He hadn't known what it was like to go hungry. Never known what it was like to have a hand raised against oneself. Never known what it was like to be yelled at and belittled. He was their everything. But, on Halloween night that all changed.
“Yeah sure, Granger. That’s why you did it.” Draco joins in with his own sarcasm.

She went toward the kitchen to prepare a bottle for the small child, correctly guessing he was hungry when he started to fuss again. After preparing it with practiced ease, she walked toward the living room and gently placed him in her son’s playpen by the couch. She handed the baby the bottle, from which he drank greedily. She sat on the couch with the letter, realising it was addressed to her. She opened it and recognized the paper for parchment, somehow knowing this has something to do with her sister, Lily.
“Of course we knew,” Petunia begins,” How could we not? What? With my perfect little sister being what she was. When you showed up on our doorstep, I knew you’d be just as strange, just as unusual. I knew you’d be a freak, just like you mother and father.”

‘Thank you, Dudley, for yet another thrilling addition to the conversation.’ Harry thinks sarcastically. Harry looks at Dudley… And promptly ignores him.
He goes to sweep the floors. When he’s finished, he heads to the kitchen. He always leaves what needs to be done in the kitchen for last, the room triggering memories of thrown plates breaking over his head and the lashings of his uncle’s belt against his back. He winces as he enters the room. ‘At least it’s empty today’, he thinks. The last time he had been doing the dishes, Dudley had been at the kitchen table. That day, Harry’s cousin had made it his personal mission to annoy Harry as much as humanly possible. ‘Either that or he really wanted a broken nose.’ Harry laughs at the thought of Dudley running around the house, blood running down his face, screaming for his mummy and daddy. Harry scoffs, ‘I’d get my ass beat into next week for that. But, seeing my cousin look like an even bigger idiot than usual would be so worth it.’
The heavy silence fades almost as quickly as it came, leaving Harry walking through the Hall to the sound of dull conversation. Suddenly, a voice cuts through the din of conversation, gaining both Harry and Draco’s attention.
Petunia woke up to the faint cries of an infant. Believing it to be her son, she rushed to Dudley’s room, ready for anything and expecting the worst. She soon realizes that the crying she hears isn't coming from inside the house, but from the doorstep. She reaches tentatively for the knob, hesitating slightly. She finds her resolve and opens the door.

Much Love,
“Hey,” Draco nudges Harry, leaning into him softly and staying there before continuing, “It’s been a pretty great year, hasn’t it.” Draco says this as a statement, leaving no room for question.

Thank you so much to those who have followed this story through to the end! We hope you continue to follow the series, because we have a lot in store for our amazing readers.
“Yes, yes, well done Ravenclaw, well done. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award.” The Great Hall falls into a hush, confusion flooding the room. Harry and Draco glance at each other, both coming to the same conclusion about where this is going. “To Mister Draco Malfoy and Mister Harry Potter, twenty five points each for the use of cool intellect while facing great peril.”
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.
without her usual amount of bite. She seems tired; Harry almost feels sorry for her. But not quite.
“I got a letter the other day and –“
“Perfect, I'll go get the bed.” Vernon said as he left the room.
Chapter 2
A/N: Thank you to those who are reading this story. I am going to try to post a chapter every Friday. If there is ever an occasion where I won't be able to post for a while, it will be put in the A/N at the end of a chapter.
“Well, obviously I didn’t do it for you. It was purely to maintain the reputation of my house.” Hermione smirks playfully, returning Harry’s banter.
“He’s right, Ronald. Just let it go.” Hermione’s voice is light in tone, but it carries over to where Weasley’s friends are sitting and gaping at the bushy haired girl.
In relation to the previous paragraph, I would like to reestablish that comments and CONSTRUCTIVE criticism are completely welcome. We enjoy reading your feedback and have incorporated a few your ideas into the story in one form or another. Once again, thank you all!
When they reach the table, the three of them untangle their arms with amused chuckles. Hermione looks Harry up and down before pulling him into her arms. Harry quickly reciprocates, squeezing the bushy haired girl tightly.
2.  Folding Dudley’s laundry
The Slytherin table erupts in ecstatic celebration as soon as Dumbledore finishes speaking. Harry and Draco can’t help but grin at the joyful looks thrown their way and the pats on the back they receive from their housemates.

Despite Harry’s problems with this room, he doesn’t actually mind doing the dishes. The procedural movements help to reclaim a sense of order in this absolute shit-show he calls a life. He notices his aunt standing behind him, waiting for him to finish so she can start dinner. He looks to the clock and is startled to see it’s nearly 5:30. He’s a half an hour late finishing up his chores. That means he won’t be eating dinner tonight. Just add it to the list of things he has to look forward to. Harry rolls his eyes, anticipating the annoying hunger that will undoubtedly begin to gnaw at his insides soon. He wipes off the counter, turning to his Aunt.
“Just sit down, Weasley. Every time you open your mouth you lower the reputation of your entire house.”
“What in god’s name have you been doing you lazy brat? You know what is expected of you, yet for some reason you think it’s okay to slack off? The dishes are still piled in the sink and the floors are absolutely filthy. Well? What do you have to say for yourself?” Harry’s aunt rants at him relentlessly.
Much Love,

So deep in thought, she didn't notice as her husband, Vernon, entered the room.
He turns back to his Aunt and Uncle saying, “It came yesterday afternoon. It’s from a school called Hogwarts. They… they say I’m a wizard. They say I have magic.”

As she takes her seat, mass amounts of food appear on top of the tables in the Great Hall and, as expected, everybody digs in immediately.

When the eggs are done he places them on a large plate and brings it to the table where the Durselys are seated. Dudley, who has already helped himself to the bacon and pancakes made by his mother, tears the plate from Harry’s grasp the moment it is within reach. Harry rolls his eyes, exasperated.
Instead of a verbal response, Petunia handed him the letter. As he finished, Vernon pulled petunia in a hug. He knew even though she may not have talked with her sister in years, she still cared for her, and through his anger he knew his wife would need the comfort.
Finally, there will be a rewrite posted eventually. We have been going through the story and finding quite a few issues with tenses, grammar, and phrasing that we would like to fix in order to give people a better reading experience. There shouldn't be any changes to the story line, and if there are, they won't be very major. One thing that we are not sure about is whether we should just edit the existing chapters or post the rewrite as a new story, so if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.
"You don't look so good," Callum commented over a spicy Firewhiskey coffee.
"Yes, my love?"
"Hello?"
"People died," Draco protested weakly.
Draco returned the smile. He was feeling bold, yes. It would have been so much easier to go back to England and remarry. Raising Scorpius would have been easier. His son would have had a mother. Reintegrating into international Pureblood society would have been easier. He would have found support to treat Scorpius's allergy, got a pass on the extra permits he needed.
Harry moaned around the first prawn covered in thick sauce. He pressed his lips to his glass and finished it in one gulp, realising that he was thirsty. Draco refilled his water and sat down on the floor in front of him, his cheek resting on the inside of Harry's knee.
"Callum always says that it's akin to curbing your emotional expression and that's not very healthy, so... Go ahead. Feel sorry for yourself. Normally it's less painful once it's out."
Draco rolled his eyes and removed his shorts, and his jock strap at the same time for good measure. He mimed a little warm-up, bouncing on his running shoes and making his cock and balls bounce too of course, and Harry wondered if going out in the February cold was really worth it and if it wouldn't be better to jump to the conclusion of their jogs immediately. "Is that better?"
