“Oh shoot, I forgot my old clothes in the shop. I should at least throw them out. If you want to go ahead you can, I’ll be quick,” Harry made a shoo motion toward Draco and didn’t turn around to leave until Draco walked away. Draco gave him an odd look but walked up the hill. Harry waited until he was just out of sight by some people and darted into the sweet shop. He had a few moments before Draco began to suspect. He looked for the sweets Draco had been looking at in the window earlier.
“Wait!” Came a shrill voice from behind him, he turned slightly to see where the voice had come from. There was a curly-haired brunette girl, running from the back of the room towards him. His eyes widened as she stepped in front of him in a protective stance. “Your majesties, you simply can’t kill him. You haven’t given him a fair trial, what is he guilty of?”
“Tell Cedric to create a beautiful feast for Harry Potter, he has not eaten in a long while and he will be of no use to me if he dies of starvation.” Draco ordered. Harry couldn’t believe his ears as he watched Draco order the elf.
“Silencing spell,” she said. Her voice was soft. Harry nodded and laid back. He stared at the ceiling. He heard Hermione sigh, and a slight thud of a book being set on the floor. “I’m sorry he did this to you, but really you should have known better than to talk to him in such a manner. I’m not saying this is your fault, or that it explains his reactions. I’m just hoping you’ll watch what you say to him, in order not to set him off on you.”
“Um, Draco hurt you. He, um. I don’t think he meant to Harry,” Luna whispered. Ron took an angry step forward.
He came across a bunch of dead leaves and reached his hand out to grab them when he heard a crinkling in the leaves off to his left. He paused and crouched low in the brush to peek under the branches. The leaves crinkled again and he realized the noises he was hearing were footsteps. They were light against the grass, careful almost. Harry’s breath hitched when a young fawn stepped into his field of vision. He made eye contact with the deer, and he moved ever so slightly against the brush to get a closer view.
He came to a rough stop by Draco, and then tried to get Hedwig to return her pace, and match the Prince.
“He’s the prince!” Harry mocked in a high pitched voice to himself, before he squatted down beneath the low branches of a tree to pick up some tree bark. He knew he was being childish, he was just angry.
“What do you mean you’re fine? You’re wearing rags Potter. I realize you didn’t have much with you when you got to my castle, but even the other servants have nicer clothes than you do.”
“I can take you out shopping. I'm the prince, my servant has to look good.” Draco muttered, and licked his bottom lip. Harry watched as Draco’s tongue curled over his bottom lip, and he realized it wasn’t the first time the blonde had done this. Harry looked up into Draco’s eyes for a second and nodded. He decided to bow out of respect for the Prince.
“Some people look brilliant enough without having to flaunt their wealth, perhaps I don’t have to try as hard to look beautiful as you do,” Draco taunted. Harry snorted, but took a drink. Draco preened under Harry’s laughter.
“Excuse me, Princess Astoria told me the people with red ribbons were servants of hers?” Harry asked.
Draco settled down onto the bed and laid his arms out above his head in a 90-degree angle and tucked them under his pillow. The muscles in Draco’s back and shoulders were flexed with how the muscles stretched and Harry realized the weight of this situation he was in now. God, he hadn’t admitted it to Luna but looking at the boy next to him now there was no way that if she asked him now, he’d be able to deny it.
Harry looked around the room, suddenly wondering why they didn't put a Glamour on it or transfigure it into something more homely.
“I can leave you to be on your own then if you’d like,” Harry offered. He hoped that maybe he could stay next to the Prince. There was a calm surrounding them, perhaps because on the backs of their horses they were on equal ground. Away from prying ears and judgement, it was peaceful and calm. Luna was talking to her horse in the background, and Harry smiled at the image.
“Hello, Hedwig.” Harry whispered, and reached his arm through the stall bars. It was then that Luna walked out of the back room. She stood quietly for a moment, and then walked over to them.
Draco's eyes widened and he stared at the boy before him. He cleared his throat and looked past Harry to the kitchen. They were still standing at the bottom of the stairs, not really doing anything important, waiting perhaps, Harry thought. Harry turned around and looked at the kitchen, and when nothing happened for several minutes, sighed. Draco hummed.
She answered with pride, “They’re muggles, they work in the village. I visit them as often as I can to bring them food and clothes.” Harry admired her for not looking down on her muggle parents, but then her admission hit him. Hermione was muggle-born, and the Malfoy’s from what he could tell, were racist.
Harry shook his hand and wondered if everyone in the Greengrass’ palace was as decent and gentle as the people he’s met so far.
“Alright, but if you try anything Potter, I’ll hex you into the next year,” Draco whispered and began to sit up. Harry was about to inquire what the blonde was doing until Draco grabbed the bottom hem of his shirt and began to carefully lift it over his head. Harry was sure his eyes were as wide as saucers. He wasn’t expecting the boy to take off his shirt at all, he figured maybe he’d massage over the boy’s shirt.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen Prince Malfoy alone together with Luna, so I don’t think that they would have any sort of interaction of those sorts. He doesn’t harm her in any way, I know they’ve been friends since they were children. Maybe that’s why she’s fond of him. Now that you mention it, I’m not sure why she would be. He’s a horrible person, perhaps he’s managed to trick her,” Hermione explained, her eyes came back into focus.
Harry shook his head, “His highness is dressing right now.” The words felt weird coming out of his mouth. Hermione looked up at him from where she stood a few stairs below him, and furrowed her brows in confusion.
Harry half-heartedly agreed with her, he wasn’t too sure about staying with Draco after everything that had happened. Also, because of the strange attraction he had to the blonde, it would be awkward. He thought about what Draco said about letting his guard down around the servants of this castle. They’ll strike at any sign of weakness, and what time would he be weaker and more defenseless as when he’s sleeping?
“Don’t talk about Draco that way. I don’t care if that’s what you think of him, just please do not speak of him that way when you’re around me.” Luna glared. She crossed her arms and pursed her lips. Harry stared at her, dumbfounded.
He nodded, made sense. He thanked the servant, and walked around for a little bit watching all the servants prep their ingredients. He wondered what the meal would be tonight with all the ingredients being thrown together.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. The prince was clad in a tight fitting green shirt that tied loosely in a V below his collarbone. His pants were black and fit to his legs in places that made Harry blush to look at. His wand was holstered to his hip, but Harry also noticed a small dagger, one he hadn’t set out in the morning. Draco had decided to wear the outfit he’d picked out, and he looked damned good in it.
Draco shivered and moaned. Harry’s eyes widened and a strange heat ran through him. He sprang back and held a hand over his mouth, before he let out a sound. He was still sat on the boys back. His heart was thumping in his chest so loud he was sure Draco could hear it. There was a bright heat at the base of Draco’s hairline and a similar one settled on Harry’s cheeks. The sound replayed in Harry’s mind and he had to will himself to calm down and pretend like he didn’t hear anything.
“Wow, you actually look like a Prince,” Harry muttered, his voice had a breathless sound to it. Draco shot a look at him, and he waved his hands in apology. “I just meant, you look like a Prince, you look..”
“What do you mean? See what?” Harry asked, he stood up, eyes blown wide, and he took a cautious step back from the blonde. Luna smiled at him, her eyes crinkled in the corners, and she took a step towards him. She leaned in and whispered,
“He’s not that bad honestly, you guys held a good conversation on our way here. You’ll get used to him,” Luna stood her ground on the subject.
“He killed my parents, my whole village in fact. I’m the only survivor. He tried to kill me, so I had to run away. I don’t mean to cause trouble or anything, I just wanted a place to stay.” Hermione touched his shoulder, and brought him in for a slight hug.
Luna laughed. “After what I witnessed yesterday, I decided to knock. You can blame Harry, he’s tamed me.”
“I-I’m hiding, I guess you could say,” Harry stuttered. Ron leaned in, curious. Hermione nodded for him to continue. “From Lord Voldemort.” Ron’s eyes widened, and Hermione gasped.
Draco’s name sounded weird coming out of her mouth. Harry wasn't sure why the thought occurred to him, each of the royals in this castle shared the name, save for Luna. A light bulb went off in his head.
“Don’t touch me!” Draco screamed. Harry watched in shock as the realization dawned on Draco’s face at what he’d said. “I don’t want your filth on my clothes, these were specially tailored for me, it’d be a shame to burn them.”
“Fine. Should I meet you both back at the castle then?” She sniffled. Harry’s heart lurched, and he reached out for her. She moved her arm away from him. “Don’t touch me.”
“We barely pay you anything as is because you are basically a prisoner to us right now. We don’t know why you came here, and what you were running from so until we figure that out you make only a little. I don’t mind buying you clothes, it’s nice to go out shopping with someone. Especially if I can make them look better.” Draco explained. There was a small skip in his step that Harry did not miss.
Both boys mounted their horses and started back toward the castle. The silence was deafening. Harry hoped Draco hadn’t seen him leaving the sweets shop. He decided to make small talk.
“We should be good to leave in the morning.” Luna sighed. The air was heavy around her, something seemed off.
Since dinner was supposedly already being prepared, and he’d never served dinner before, he absolutely needed to wake them up. Under any other circumstances, where he knew what the fuck he was doing, he would have let them sleep. He glanced around, before he muttered a cleaning spell at them, an action he could do wandless. He would’ve removed their clothes physically but he figured it would be painless to do it with magic so he wouldn't have to peel Hermione’s shirt away from her new and slightly old injuries. He gently shook Ron to wake him.
“Ron helped me re-bandage it this morning, it’ll heal. The castle has three floors, plus the dungeons. We don’t clean the dungeons. First, we sweep the floors of every room.. Then, we wash them with bucket and rag. Next we clean the windows, borrow a ladder from the garden, make sure it’s clean, we don’t want to dirty the floors again. After the windows are cleaned, it should be time for breakfast, we go to the kitchen and ask the elves to prepare breakfast. You will help me set the table, and wake the Queen. Ron’s is the manservant for the King, but you are shadowing me today. Is everything clear?” Hermione rattled off to him. Harry nodded, and his stomach grumbled. He had a long day ahead of him. With that, Hermione took off down the hall with her dust pan and broom.
Draco led him back to the Throne Room, which was at the end of the corridor. The room was empty except for the King’s throne. The King and Queen had left the room it seemed, and it was just the two of them now. Seamus and Dean walked in, and set up a wooden table. Draco gestured for Harry to sit down on the bench seat, so he did.
“Don’t make me repeat myself you twat. You heard me, I’m not saying it again.” Draco suddenly found the laces on his shirt far more interesting than Harry’s face. Harry’s mouth was dry, so he swallowed and coughed.
“Oh! That’s right. How’s your back?” Harry asked her. She hugged herself and smiled lightly at him. She walked over to a closet and grabbed a broom and dust pan. She handed him a broom.
Draco’s room was a deep green color, with black curtains hanging across the bed poles, draping over the side. His sheets were black, and his comforter was a dark green. The wall had a giant plaque with a silver snake on it hanging above his bed. Draco walked out of what looked to be a walk-in closet. Harry looked over to him, eyes skimming the other details of the room. There was a large painted black desk with a quill and ink. There were bookshelves, filled with many books of all lengths and colors.
“So that? All of that was an act? You were just pretending to be nice?” Harry nearly yelled, his voice cracking. He hated himself for being upset, he hated himself for having had hope. He should’ve listened to Hermione, he should’ve trusted her. She’d been around longer, she’d know if Draco had the ability to care about others.
Luna was behind him in a second, she brushed her hair through his curls. The gesture made him miss Hermione with everything in his soul. He missed staying up late with his friends and joking with them. He missed Ron’s rowdiness and sarcastic comments about the royals. He missed being home. ‘Home’ because that’s what it was to him now, wasn’t it? He ached to return.
“Where’s your gold Draco?” Pansy asked, gleaming in her diamonds and gold jewelry. Draco puffed up and smirked.
“Ulysses,” Draco answered. “The English term for Odysseus, on of the most powerful men alive in Greece. Even so that he was revered among gods. He won many battles with his mighty power and won over many women. He could have had anyone he wanted, and no one would have questioned him.”
There was no tiled art on the walls, there was no fancy tile on the floor, the ceilings had sloped downward, and there was a slight funky smell coming from the walls. It looked like the entrance to a dungeon. The guard stopped in front of a small rickety door and pushed it open.
“Yes, sleep.” Ron moaned, and then was out like a light. Harry watched as Hermione flicked her wand at his bed, in which the covers pulled away from Ron and over his sleeping figure.
He crossed his arms and glared at Luna, “Loony, what if I was naked when you barged in? At least knock.” His eyes flicked to Harry’s and smirked when he saw the flustered look on the servants face.
Draco paused, Harry noticed his boots scuff the mud as the Prince turned to him. He hadn’t really thought about his words, not that they weren’t true, but he didn’t think about how the Prince would feel beforehand. Though he probably didn’t mean to come off that way, the Prince seemed quite sensitive.
It was more form-fitting than he’d first thought, and it fit him well. He’d fill out the chest later when he began to train his muscles. He loved the color. He tried the black one on as well, and it fit the same as the red. He put the red one back on and wore it with his brown pants. He walked out from behind the curtain and gave the thumbs up to Draco. Draco handed him nearly a hundred more things. Harry set the other clothes off to the side and grabbed the clothes Draco had gotten for him.
Once they reached their room the guard stopped and reached his hand out to knock on the door. The door swung open and Harry couldn’t control his surprise. Draco frowned at him and raised an eyebrow at the noise that had come out of Harry’s mouth. Harry chuckled to himself, embarrassed. He cleared his throat and stood back up, as he’d taken a step back in his surprise. There was a pretty girl on the other side of the door. Harry felt stupid, he thought maybe the knock had opened it with a sort of wandless magic, but someone had simply opened it from the inside.
Draco curled his lip in disgust. Harry remembered what Hermione had said on his first day. Draco didn’t like meeting princesses, he never paid them any mind. Harry would never understand the need to find someone to marry at the age of fifteen.
“You could do that Harry, I’m not sure he’ll answer you directly, as I’m not sure if he knows himself who he’d want to marry. Both would stay faithful, and Pansy is a frightening ruler, but she has no pity and little love to give. Draco needs a balance, not someone he’d quarrel with all the time over small things let alone quarreling over power. Astoria would bring peace, would be loving and tender, but probably doesn't have as many benefits to their kingdom as Pansy.”
On his walk through the castle. He tried to figure out where Luna’s room was to see if she was there. Confused about the layout of the castle, Harry walked up to a servant with a red ribbon tied around his belt.
Harry didn’t look over his shoulder as he walked away. He heard the bed move. A slight creak, a shift of weight. Perhaps the sound of someone sitting up, perhaps out of confusion, or out of fury. If Harry didn’t acknowledge that he knew Draco was awake, he didn’t have to deal with that outcome.
Harry had so many questions for the red-head. They were sitting in an old storage room it seemed. There were three tall, thin, windows along the wall. It seemed to be the only source of light in the room, aside from a few stray candles. There were books in stacks all around the room, and a small desk with several quills in a bottle. There were several empty beds, though they seemed to be planks of wood or slabs of stone covered in sheets and a blanket.
“S-sorry, I didn’t mean to stay out too long,” Harry apologized, and bowed a full 90 degrees to the Prince. Draco snickered, and knocked his feet out from under him, sending him falling into a small pile of muck. Anger boiled in his chest, and he got up off his face to growl at the prince, but he’d already began walking away.
“Luna!” He whispered, shouting. He looked over to Draco, who stirred in his sleep. Luna dragged him back to his cot and threw him onto the bed before closing the bamboo divider behind her.
“It’s amazing isn’t it?” Luna laughed beside him. Her horse ran beside his. “The wind in your hair feels amazing!”
They gathered together on Ron’s bed, since he was in the middle. Harry carefully moved the candles onto a book-stand Hermione set up. They were cozied up with their blankets from their beds. They chatted about pointless things, until Hermione changed the subject.
The smile dropped from Harry’s face, and he stared at his lap. He wondered if he should tell them. He quite honestly didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t even know what to say, but the look in Hermione’s eyes told him that it was okay. He bit his lip, and sighed.
“I mean honestly, I think he’d take it as a compliment.” Ron shrugged. He yelped when Hermione grabbed a book off of one of her many stacks, and hit him with it. “Ow! ‘Mione.” He whined. “Don’t stress your back muscles. You’ll pull the bandage off.”
This took longer to get out than planned, but it also turned out longer so hopefully that makes up for it! Hope you enjoy it!
“To make sure we don’t overthrow them, of course! If they only employ the weak, and those they can control they’ll never have to worry about being overtaken or killed. You must have noticed this in your palace Harry.”
But somehow the prince had assumed that harry wouldn’t hurt him. There was an underlying trust, and Harry felt something in his chest move at the thought. He couldn’t discern what the emotion was that he felt.
“Yeah, I really like her, she’s great.” Harry nodded, and folded another pair of trousers. Draco was quiet, and Harry felt a nagging inside of himself, something in his gut that didn’t feel right.
Harry pondered to himself too long, as he realized he could no longer see the two blondes in front of him. A slight panic shuffled through his body and he glanced around in the dark of the night. He double tapped Hedwig’s sides and took off in the direction he assumed the royals went. Pain shot through his rib cage as his muscles shifted with the movement from his horse. He took a big breath in to calm the muscles. He could see the dapple speckle of Luna’s horse and sped up to catch up with her. He gripped the horn like his life depended on it. He strode past her on accident, the wind running through his hair, it was thrilling. He laughed. He’d never felt so alive.
When he finished washing her, he covered her wounds with a bandage and handed Hermione her shirt. She stood up and walked over to her bed. She sat down with her back facing the boys, and removed the blanket. Ron drew his eyes away from her, as she slipped on her bra. He knocked Harry in the head and glared at him for staring.
He found he quite liked the laces, as he’d found them attractive on Draco. He figured he’d try one on. He kept looking around the shop, finding a pair of trousers he figured were in his size, and folded two over his arm, one in grey and one in black. He walked over to a section of mediums, and found a nice heathered looking red shirt. A pullover loose fitting long sleeve shirt, and he also grabbed one in black and walked back to the changing curtains.
Harry’s eyes widened when Draco pushed the door open to the servants’ commons. Every single servant in the room froze when they saw Draco enter. Some started crying; the women, the girls. The men jumped up to protect them, putting their bodies in front of them. Harry’s eyes flicked to Draco, and then at the servants.
Harry started with a slow touch to the middle of Draco’s shoulder blades. Draco jolted and Harry slowly rubbed a circle on the muscle to relax the blonde. Draco relaxed slowly and Harry was able to work the tensed area more. He began running his thumbs along Draco’s spine all the way from the base of his neck to the tip of his tailbone, spreading his fingers out at every knob of the Prince’s spine. He stretched the skin of Draco’s sides as he worked the kinks out of Draco’s body. He began to massage deep into the mid back, lower ribs area.
“Ah, yes. I haven’t eaten in a long time.” Harry looked up, but avoided eye contact with Draco. He tried to remember the last time he ate food. It took him at least four days to travel from the outskirts of Lord Voldemort’s kingdom to the Malfoy kingdom. He hadn’t eaten the night before, and he’d been interrupted earlier before breakfast.
“You don’t get a say in who you marry?” Harry asked. “You can’t marry for power, marriage is for lovers.”
“I’ll tell you mine then.” Luna whispered. She sat down on the ground next to him. They sat there in silence for several minutes. Harry almost wondered if he’d misheard her, until she started talking.
Harry’s chest tightened as the ground began to sway beneath him. He looked at Luna, past Luna, around Luna, but avoided her eyes. His head began to ache and he couldn’t get enough oxygen. How could she know? How could she tell?
“Shut up.” Draco spoke to her, his voice was smooth, and cold, it sounded menacing. Harry couldn’t do anything but watch as Draco slammed her head into the stone tile of the Throne Room floor. Harry was too scared to move, too scared to make a sound. He watched in terror as Ron ran to her, but was stopped short by Draco. Draco kneed him in the stomach, and Ron dropped to the ground. He held his stomach, and stared at Harry. Harry’s heart felt like it were on fire.
“Did you grow up as a servant?” Harry inquired, shifting his position on the bed, relieving his sleeping foot. He winced as the tingle started.
“Some great man, that is.” He muttered to himself, and looked up at Luna who shook her head in pity. She helped him up, and began to wipe the muck off his face with her rag. He sat down on a fold-able chair.
Harry’s eyes filled with tears at the memory of his mother, he never had any bad dreams when she held him. He grabbed his sheets and pulled them off his legs, and swung them over the side of the cot.
Harry’s body burned under the Prince’s gaze, and he looked away from Draco and cleared his throat. He looked down at the horn of his saddle and ran his hands through Hedwig’s mane.
Harry froze, and his eyes widened. He set the shirt he was holding on the bed, and turned around to look at Draco. Draco nodded, and looked down at his feet, and then away.
“Hello Draco, always with the few words. So stoic of you, so much like your father. How is he, finding his power a little lacking lately?” Draco stiffened at her words. Harry already didn’t like the vibe of her aura. Harry didn’t miss the jab at King Malfoy’s power, though he didn’t understand it. “Oh, and if it isn’t Loony Lovegood, we’ve missed you terribly here. The servants have been restless without their favorite toy hanging around, they’ve almost been asking for more work.”
Harry looked up at Draco in surprise. His stomach grumbled and he glanced down at the floor in shame. Draco tapped his boot on the floor impatiently.
“You, slave. You dare laugh?” Pansy snarled at Harry. Harry’s eyes widened, and he glanced at Draco.
The touch of her skin, brought back all of his memories for the hour before. The way Draco had laughed, and the noises he’d made under the touch of Harry’s palms. He’d laid defenseless on the bed, a young man over him, and he hadn’t panicked. Harry was positive he could’ve turned around and slit his throat open with a hidden blade if Harry intended to hurt him.
“They only allow older men and women to serve them. Those that can't fight back or are easily subdued. The Malfoy's are afraid of being overtaken, so they threaten the lives of the men and turn them into soldiers for the war. If the men were to try anything against the King or Queen, their family would be killed off one by one in public.” Ron explained. Harry's mouth hung by the end of Ron's explanation.
“Oh hello Harry! Did you find the room okay?” She closed her journal, and turned to face him. She was wearing what looked to be a long sleeved blue shirt with a long maroon skirt underneath. Harry wondered for a moment if she was as fashionably challenged as he was.
He then pulled his shirt off over his head, and the moment his skin was exposed he felt a strong gaze on him but he refused to look in the Prince’s direction. His skin felt hot under the Prince’s gaze, and it made him fumble with the edge of his new shirt. A nicer navy blue shirt, with a slight frayed hem. He stretched his arms out into the sleeve and brought the shirt over his head. He pulled it down over his belt, letting it hang rather than tucking it in. He rolled up his sleeves and brushed out the wrinkles of his shirt. He slipped on some brown boots and looked back at Draco.
“Well you look loads better than the last time I saw you. Got an upgrade, did you?” She flicked her eyes to Harry and he felt his heart seize. He fought to keep his expression calm and serious as Draco had told him to do.
“Potter! You’re late.” Draco spat. Harry knelt down as an apology and panted in front of Draco’s feet. Draco looked down at Harry in amusement. “Are you hungry?”
“I don’t know why you keep it a secret,” She whispered to him. His eyes widened and he looked up at her in shock. “I can see it, I can tell.”
Luna sighed to herself. “You shouldn’t have said such mean things, Harry. He didn’t deserve them, especially because he didn’t even instigate it.” She bent over to fill a bucket with water for the horses.
“I have a spell on him,” She whispered. Harry’s eyes widened. “He’s had bad dreams for a while now, and I cast a spell in order to track his sleep. So when it was abnormally quiet, the spell alerted me that something had changed. That's why I came into the room to check on him, and I found you in bed with him. So I ask you again, Harry, what did you do to him?”
“They came. The dark wizards. They ransacked my village, burned the houses, took prisoners, killed people. He killed my parents in front of me, Voldemort did. He tried to hit me, with some spell, I don’t remember. But I got away, and I ran for days. I hid in the fields, and the surrounding trees. They followed me, for awhile, but once I got too close to Hogwarts they stopped and turned back, so I kept running here. Now here I am.” Harry gestured out at the field before him.
“Get up. We’re going to the kitchen.” Draco nudged him in the chest with his boot, sending Harry falling back onto his butt. Harry’s eyes widened and he gasped in surprise.
Harry’s eyes widened, and he heard Hermione gasp behind him. Everything went silent as he made eye contact with cold grey eyes. A shiver rolled down his spine as a smirk formed on the blonde’s lips. Draco rolled his tongue over his lips, and bit his bottom lip, before smiling at his new servant.
“Why are you hiding it?” Luna asked him. She was walking towards him and he couldn’t seem to scoot away fast enough. His eyes flicked around the hills and saw no one, this wasn’t a trap. Everything was okay, wasn’t it?
“Yes! How can I help you?” The boy smiled brightly and held out his hand, “You must be Harry Potter, Prince Malfoy’s servant. I’m Colin Creevey, it’s wonderful to meet you.”
Harry felt heat rise to his face and he coughed and shook his head. He couldn’t, scratch that, wouldn’t ever change Draco’s clothes. He would jump out a window first before having to awkwardly remove and put on Draco’s pants and shirt. The idea that Draco shouldn’t be dressing himself was ludicrous.
“And what, Harry Potter, was a muggle like you doing in the Malfoy Castle?” She asked him. Harry swallowed, and his throat felt like sandpaper.
Harry was puzzled for a moment but continued cutting. He wanted to mention that he saw her earlier but didn’t know how to bring it up. He kept sneaking looks at her out of the corner of his eye.
“No, I’m sorry. I just have a lot of questions. I’m curious about you, sorry. I was from a distant village, I’ve never been around royalty.” Harry’s hair stood on end at the base of his neck, as he remembered his home. The little cottage just outside the barriers of the kingdom walls. Draco pursed his lips, but sighed.
Harry reached out and held Draco’s hand that clutched the bed sheets, and brushed his thumb over the soft skin. The touch seemed to shock Draco, and the boy’s demeanor suddenly changed. The movements stopped, and the boy stopped shaking. Harry watched as Draco curled in towards the body heat he presented at the side of the bed. The grip he held on Draco’s hand loosened when the grip was reciprocated. He slipped his hand out of Draco’s and walked back towards his cot on the other side of the room.
“When I was little, I lived in a castle. It was a beautiful castle, the walls were this gorgeous shade of white, weird as it is to say that. My mother, she would slide down the railing on the stairs. She would wear this bright blue flowy dress, that when she landed would twirl around her waist and flutter at her ankles. She was wonderful, and kind, she would bake me sweets, even though we had elves for that. She was an amazing witch, she was a scientist too, would create potions and serums of the sort. She once told me this inspiring story of how a prince would come for me, and we’d fall in love and he’d give me a rose. At the end of her story, she created a rose, and brought it out from behind her back. I laughed and laughed. She died when I was nine.” Every word flowed from Luna’s mouth, expressing an image so terribly bright in Harry’s mind. Luna smiled sadly at the memory.
Harry wondered if Draco was out of the room now. He walked back out of the kitchen and into the hallways he’d walked through with the guard. Remembering his steps through the palace, he wondered if he prepared enough clothes worthy of wearing to a ball.
“I’m glad you think so! You must be Harry Potter, Narcissa said that you’d be joining Draco on his journey here. How do you like being a servant so far? I love the work. The House Elves must get so tired of helping all of the rather terrible people in this castle. The poor things. I try to do as much as I can whenever I visit. Your fashion taste is quite nice, I figure you picked out Draco’s outfit.” Draco ran a hand down his face as the Princess started to ramble. Harry didn’t know where to begin as he answered.
Harry somehow doubted that. Whenever he was left alone, his mind would retract into memories of his family, and many other things he didn’t want to think about. He didn’t know enough about the Prince to know what troubles he may have, but too long on your own can bring any bad thought to surface.
In the group Harry noticed the girl he’d seen crying in the hallway, her brown hair was tied in a braided curl on her head and pinned. Her skin was darker than he’d seen. Her corset was plain, a light blue, and her skirt was a dirty white. She brushed her hands on her dress skirt, and grabbed a bunch of potatoes to transfer to a different surface. She began to fumble and drop potatoes. Harry decided he was in -what seemed to be- the comfort of others like him. It wouldn’t to let his guard down a little. He looked around briefly before making his way toward the girl, avoiding contact with the rushing workers.
“You may enter,” a soft voice called from within the room. Harry cracked the door open a smidgen to peer into the room, before stepping fully into the room. Luna was sat at a desk, writing away in what looked to be a diary.
Draco crossed his arms and sighed through his nose. Harry took the moment to look him up and down, he noticed the blonde had changed. He was dressed down, in black slacks and a green t-shirt. There was a small snake embroidered onto the front breast pocket of the shirt. Harry groaned inwardly at noticing how well the shirt fit Draco. He tore his gaze away from Draco's clothing to his own. He was wearing the extra clothing Ron gave him, they were baggy and long. What a sight he must be, especially compared to the blonde. A question popped into his head and he looked over at Draco.
They walked into a store, the walls were made of brick. It was warm inside, and in the back of the store Harry could see curtains hanging around certain poles. Perhaps they changed and tried on clothes behind those.
When Harry got to the top of the hill Luna was gone, inside the house Harry presumed. He ran in the back door. He glanced down the hallways, and Luna was not in sight, he sighed and ran past the kitchen to his Masters room, and just missed the blonde exiting. Harry stumbled out of Draco’s way, and stood against the wall, bending his head in a slight bow.
“Want to make it a race Lovegood?” Draco called from the other side of Harry. Harry whipped his head the his left and made eye contact with the Prince. There was a brightness there that Harry had never seen before. Luna, on his right whistled and her horse took off ahead of them both. Harry laughed in amazement at her speed.
Draco was gathering small sticks and logs. Harry decided to gather dry and dead leaves from the area around them in order to start a fire.
Harry recoiled. He gripped his shirt in his hands, Draco had been watching him change that day. He’d seen the scars and old bruises from the attacks on his village. He hated his body, hated how small he was, hated how frail he looked. Draco had heard him the night before, his sentence proved that without a shadow of a doubt and he’d used it against him. Draco had slammed the nail on the head of his insecurities.
Hi guys! I bought a planner to work out what days I’ll be updating. This chapter goes up tonight on the 31st of January. The next chapter will be up on the 12th of February.
“You’re right, Potter. Who would want to see you naked? Such a scarred scrawny frame, not a single person would find you attractive. Though according to your preferences, you should have the pick of the litter.”
Draco began looking around at the columns of clothes they had. They were set up both on columns and on tables. Trousers, pants, and other undergarments -perhaps for women- were hung but the shirts were folded nicely on tables. Like the store he visited with Luna, they were organized by size and sorted by color within the sizes.
“And that’s all it takes for Hermione to like someone really,” Ron interrupted. Hermione jumped in surprise. “Just treat the house elves kindly and she’ll take a liking to you. Even if you’re a rich princess that may end up marrying our royal asshole,” Ron chuckled. Hermione punched him in the arm and scolded him for his loudly spoken words about Draco. Harry didn’t disagree, he was just shocked that Ron had enough guts to say something like that so loudly.
Harry shut the door and walked away from it, still slightly flushed in embarrassment. He wondered if Draco found that outfit fit for a prince, or if he’d find his own outfit in his drawers. He sighed and looked around the hallway, before looking down the stairs, to see Hermione walking up the stairs to him. He smiled at her.
“Why do you keep jumping around on all the subjects Potter? Have some kind of agenda I should know about?” Draco squinted at him. Harry waved his hands in apology.
“Sorry, Malfoy. I overslept.” He’d had a busy night after all. Draco raised an eyebrow at him but didn’t say anything. Harry walked over to the wardrobe and opened it to choose an outfit for Draco. “What are the plans for today Malfoy?”
Panic flooded through his system as he looked around. He was in a large room, with only a single throne in the middle. There was a man with long blonde hair staring down at him from the throne he sat upon. A woman stood next to him, thick streaks of blonde in her otherwise brown hair.
“She’s busy with the Queen, Malfoy. What do you care? As long as I understand the point of me being with you on this trip, it doesn’t matter. Go about your daily duties, I have cleaning to get back to.” Harry sighed. Draco took a step toward him. Harry didn’t move away, but shrunk back at the sudden closeness.
He dug into his bag and grabbed his small coin pouch. “Please give me as many of those sweets as this pays for.” He pointed at the round colorful candies and placed the pouch in her hand. She smiled at him.
The cockiness returned to Draco’s voice as he boasted about the origins of the name. It was as if he was preening his feathers. His last sentence was tinged with a light sadness. Curiosity peaked in Harry, as he remembered something Hermione had said.
“Dobby!” Draco shouted. Harry furrowed his brows, what on earth was a Dobby? A small elf appeared before them.
His heart was in his throat by the time they reached the gates of the castle. The gates looked menacing, almost more so than the Malfoy’s. The gates began to open as they approached. Draco sat up straight, rolled his shoulders back and pointed his chin up. The air around him changed, Harry felt it shift and it reminded him of how Draco acted at home.
“That’s quite alright Harry, you need not worry about it if it makes you feel uncomfortable. I can have one of my girls help me. Sorry for the trouble Draco.”
“Harry,” Luna spoke from beside him. She’s slowed her horse down to walk beside his. “You hold those ropes, they’re called reins. You guide her by gently moving them, if they cross over her neck in either direction she turn her head to move in that direction. If you press your foot onto her right side as you move the rein to the right she will turn more sharply. To make her go faster you lightly kick her sides with both feet. Just say ‘woah’ or ‘calm’ if you need her to stop, while pulling up on the reins.” Luna demonstrated by making her horse stop.
“You have a beautiful friendship,” the barber adds. Harry had forgotten where they were for a moment and didn’t realize they had an audience. His cheeks heat, and he clears his throat. “I’ll make you an attractive man yet, young sir. All it takes is the right haircut.”
Harry scrubbed each piece of metal, two times over, inside and out, to make sure they were clean. He put both sets of armor back together, it wasn’t hard, just time consuming. He’d still ask Hermione about cleaning armor, and perhaps ask Ron if he knew how to fight, it’d be good to learn.
“It’s Prince Malfoy to you, Potter.” He spat at the brunette. He turned back to the door and walked out of it. “You have ten minutes.”
“She’s a distant cousin. Not closely related, but her father is related to my father somehow. They didn’t get along in the slightest. So he decided to run off with some whimsical princess and start his own kingdom. They produced Luna, who my father adores. It’s only because of that adoration that she’s allowed to stay here. My father is not exactly forgiving.”
“I bloody think you’re attractive as well!” He answered, and realized he hadn’t whispered. She’d left him feeling so flustered he forgot to remixing quiet. Draco didn’t make a noise behind them, and just crawled into his blankets behind Harry. Harry grimaced, he didn’t quite know how that sounded if he hadn’t heard the rest of the conversation. “He’s a royal prat.”

Harry knelt down on the ground and began to scrub the floor where the plate pieces had fallen, double scrubbing certain areas so that he was sure he had cleaned everywhere. He tossed the rag back in the bucket and stood up.
“And where are you going?” He asked the brunette. Harry froze. Did he forget something? He whipped back around and started scouring the floor. There weren't any pieces left. He frowned.
“This is the servant’s quarters. My name is Ron. This is where Hermione and I sleep but, since she’s training you now, it’s your room now too.” The redhead muttered to him.
He takes a step back, and then a few more. He stumbled back, over a rock, and crashed to the ground.
Harry had been following her instruction this entire time, neither boy making a sound as she taught. He wondered how Draco would’ve taught him, probably with a harsher tone, and an impatient voice. He walked over to wear he’d placed the shoes just hours before, and grabbed a nice pair of black boots. Draco put his shoes on himself.
“We’re about half way there now, we’ll reach there about midday tomorrow. We should eat something we prepackaged and we’ll hunt in the morning for a larger meal. Rabbit or deer or something. We need a good night’s rest, especially with our long day ahead of us tomorrow.” Luna rolled her eyes at Draco when she spoke the last sentence. Harry rose his eyebrow at her, and sat down on his makeshift bed.
Luna sighed and glanced at the door behind them where Draco may have gone back to bed. She paused, and when she thought the coast was clear she looked back at Harry.
Suddenly something started glowing on Luna’s arm. Harry’s attention flew to the pale blue light that encircled her arm and he realized it was a bracelet. She had charmed it, from the look of it. He noticed her look toward his and Draco’s room, and it clicked for him that the blue light meant Draco was having dreams.
“Excuse me, ma’am. I would like five more shirts of the colors my servant just mentioned. Thank you.” Draco told the lady who’d taken Harry’s reject clothes.
Harry’s eyes widened, and he looked back towards the King and Queen, who looked a little more than unhappy with their son’s decision. Harry walked quickly over to Hermione and Ron, and grabbed their arms. He should’ve asked for permission to have help, but Draco probably wouldn’t have allowed him to even care for them if he’d asked too much.
She smiled slightly at him, “Oh, I know what they think of you, what each of their opinions of you are. I see things, remember? I keep secrets as well, so if you don’t want me to tell anyone I won’t.”
“I’ve got it Malfoy, you can rest.” Harry whispered, sliding his hand over Malfoy’s to take the knife and the squirrel. Draco’s hand twitched as Harry’s fingers brushed over his knuckles, and he jerked his hand back. Harry didn’t question the action, nor the tingling sensation that crawled up his arm. He began to skin the two remaining squirrel. Draco stood up and wiped his hands clean on a rag.
“Of course, a good Prince is one who visits the people who feed him,” Draco replied. Luna seemed absolutely gobsmacked. Draco’s reply was curt but not hostile. She had obviously thought he would have gone off at Harry. Harry smiled at Draco, trying to show that he was glad Draco had taken it as a joke.
Harry smiled at Luna, who decided to join for breakfast, and grabbed Draco's plate. He bowed to the King and Queen, before turning away, and watching out of the Throne Room.
Draco’s voice was muffled by the pillow but Harry could just make out the words. ‘It was just training, nothing special. It happens from time to time.’
Harry started reaching for further pieces, and Draco kicked them even further away. Harry huffed, and crawled to the scattered pieces. He gathered them in his shirt, and carried them over to the trashcan to throw them away. He shot a glare at Draco, as he dumped them in the trash.
Hermione blushed, and Ron, who stood in the hall, shot him a glare. Harry immediately rose his hands up and laughed sheepishly. “I meant the three of us.”
“Woo, flirt, court, date. Pick your term. He’s being sent there to impress and date the ladies who may eventually become his Queen. The Malfoy’s like Pansy for it, but Astoria is the sweetest, when she visits she’s nice to both servants and House Elves alike.” Hermione told him.
The guard led Draco and Harry into a large barrel-vaulted hallway. Harry walked slowly to admire the art on the walls and the textured tiles that made them. They looked to be all hand painted with delicate work. Draco glanced at him and whispered, “They were made by the townspeople.”
“Why Prince Malfoy, just what do you have in store for Princess Pansy, that you would feel the need to go alone?” Hermione giggled. Draco blushed and glared at her, though it didn’t look so menacing with the blush on his face.
“I don’t exactly know where to find the stuff we need.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck and glanced away. Luna nodded, and tied Hedwig’s lead to a wooden post, she brushed her hands off onto her blue jeans, and stretched, popping her neck and back.
“Ah yes, I think I look rather good as well, thank you. I see you’re still doing the work of servants, Astoria.” Draco preened under the praise.
Harry watched as she got up, and offered him a hand. He took it and she pulled him onto his feet. She gestured to the lowering sun. “We should head back, you’ll have to be serving dinner soon. I’ll hope to see you there.” With that she skipped up the hill and back to the barn, which had been lit up with lights from the inside.
Harry ran a hand through his messy morning hair. Draco hadn’t poured water on the fire yet, to  cook the meal, so Harry finished packing. He decided to go wander looking for more kindling.
Harry crawled onto Draco’s bed and curled up on top of the blankets, facing him. He began shushing Draco, any whimper that escaped the Prince’s lips was met with a quiet ‘shh’ from the servant. Harry wiped the tears from his Prince’s face with the pads of his thumbs. Draco’s cheeks were softer than the skin of his stomach. An embarrassing comparison to make, Harry realized. Draco’s whimpers had stopped, but the boy still continued to shake. Harry brushed the pale blonde locks from Draco’s eyes and traced gentle touches on the boy's face.
Harry heard the quiver in the Prince’s voice and he wondered if it was a lie. Harry didn’t know how to control the anger he felt, and he didn’t understand it either. He couldn’t understand how he felt so angry over a bruise on his Prince’s alabaster skin, but couldn’t even find it in himself to be angry over the broom beating Draco had given him. Someone was hurting Draco and he needed to know who it was, for his own personal sake.
“Ah, my bad. I’m used to doing that with Luna’s hair whenever she gets it cut,” Draco replied. Harry hums to himself, Luna would look really cute with short hair. They walked back up the hill past the sweets shop and Harry gasped.
Harry opened and closed his mouth searching for an answer. He decided to end the conversation, and they just stared at each other for awhile. She glared at him, and returned to caring for the horses.
“Is that true, Potter? You waited in a woman’s room while she dressed?” He sounded angry. Harry swallowed and nodded.
“By walking down my own hallway? What are you doing anyway, isn’t Granger supposed to be teaching you the importance of slaving for me on our trip?” The blonde sneered. Harry sighed.
Normal. A strange term, since he’d only been a servant for a bit now, and Draco’s mood seemed to change like the weather. At first, he had hated him, with a burning passion really. The more time he spent with the Prince made him realize that he’s not so much of an asshole, but just that he has a lot on his shoulder for his age. No kid their age should have to hold up the weight he has to. The side Draco shows in front of others is different than the side he shows when he and Harry are alone. He’s learned to actually enjoy the company Draco brings him.
“What so he accidentally hit Harry six times with a broom? Woops, my dignity slipped, guess that means I have to accidentally drop this broom on you several times.” Hermione grabbed Ron’s arm and shook her head. He shook her off and walked out the door into the common room. Hermione watched him leave, and then turned to her bed and sat down on it.
“Why are they unconscious? Who did that to them?” The boy followed Harry as he lifted Hermione up bridal style onto her bed, caring not to touch her wounds from the night before. He tucked her in carefully. He rushed over to the bucket and rag they used last night to wipe her forehead from the blood pooling in the creases. He’d have to help them with that later. He needed to get back to Draco before he ended up headless.
She smiled at him over her shoulder as she walked into a connected room. He looked around and realized in that moment, there were no fire ovens or pots to cook things in this room, so she must’ve gone to cook them in a separate room.
The barber began casting spells on his hair and Harry didn’t understand or know any of them. He began to notice the changes right away. The man grabbed a special knife and began to shave away at the sides of his head, and behind his ears. Harry made eye contact with Luna through the mirror and when she nodded at him with a smile, he closed his eyes.
“What outfit did you choose for the dance?” Draco leaned forward and looked at Harry. He seemed interested, so Harry decided to tease him a little.
“Probably. I’ve a lot of wishes you don’t know about, we’ve just met after all,” Harry smiled. Ron laughed as he started cleaning the plates up and away with his magic. He turned round and grinned, saying,
“Yes. I have to ‘court with’ as you put it, all the princesses. My mother says that both Greengrass princesses are going to be attending the ball in the Parkinson kingdom. My parents firmly believe that Pansy is the best fit for me.”
“You think he’s attractive!” Luna whispered, she leaned in close to him and held her hand over her mouth. Harry panicked, and his heart jumped into his throat.
Harry wanted to guess that he'd spent about an hour cleaning. That's what the giant wooden clock said on the wall in the hallway, though he didn’t quite understand how to read it. Harry was exhausted, but at least he was full. Draco had been called out by one of the guards to go talk to his father about something or another. Harry didn't exactly know, he just kept cleaning. When he'd finished he'd put the rag and bucket away and had walked into the hallway.
“Not bad, you should know I like the color black. It's a must in all of my clothing choices.” Draco smirked. “Are you going to watch me undress Potter, or are you going to leave?”
Speaking of which, Hermione had told him to go meet her at the stables with all of the blankets, clothes and pots to begin packing, and setting the horses up. Harry sighed, stuffed his hands into his trouser pockets and walked outside, passed the sign, and headed to the barn.
Harry glanced over to Draco, who hadn’t moved. He thought back to what Hermione said about him changing the clothes of the Prince, and that it was a part of his job. He swallowed his embarrassment and walked over to the bed.
“You’re what?” Harry asked, still in shock from the sudden apology. Draco looked back at him and scowled.
“Hello Harry, I need to have a word with Prince Malfoy,” She spoke sweetly to him. He looked back at the door and heard quiet shuffling.
“So you’re telling me you knew he had dreams like that? Is that why you were worried about us sharing a room? I bet you also know the answer as to why he has those bruises, is that another reason as to why you wanted him to room alone?” Harry turned the questions back on her. “Or are you truly only worried about me rooming with him because you know I find him attractive?”
They were in a small clearing of the woods, Harry hadn’t noticed the thick brush until Hedwig took off. He was new to riding, and nearly took his head off a couple of times from hanging branches and vines.
Draco was standing in the room with long black trousers already on and hanging loosely around his waist. The curve of his hip bones jutted out just above the slouched waistband. The blonde paused in his ministrations as he’d been lacing up a white shirt. His shirt hung open and Harry could see the hard packed muscle of his chest, his heart started racing as he glanced up to meet Draco’s eyes. There was a light blush under his eye but nothing more.
Harry opened the door, and set the plate down on Draco's study desk. He then walked over to Draco’s closet, retrieving the clothes he figured Draco would wear that day. He then walked over to the window, and pulled open the curtain. The blonde groaned from under the covers.
“What do your parents do Hermione?” Harry asked, thinking perhaps a change of topic was best. Hermione beamed at the question directed at her.
The three started talking about the horrors of camping with Luna and Draco, and he couldn’t stop himself from smiling. He was walking behind the two, and slung his arms over their shoulders as they walked towards their room. Hermione and Ron gave him amused confused looks, as he gripped their shoulders and beamed. It felt like home.
He folded the shirt over his arm, and went to find some trousers and a jacket. When he walked over to look at the rows in front of them, he rummaged through the trousers until he found some brown ones in his size. He wondered if he could fix the hem to have some gold sewn on, perhaps he could ask Luna for some thread. He also grabbed a nice leather jacket without sleeves, so it was almost like a vest, and put it together in his pile.
Harry sighed, and closed his eyes tightly. He really didn’t want to go on this trip. He ran his hands down his face and was shocked by the cold. Perhaps he should bring mittens? It would get cold at night, Hermione said. He’d need several sets of blankets, pillows, clothes, and pans from the kitchen. How were they supposed to get food? Hunt? Harry had never hunted before, though perhaps Draco and Luna would do the honors. He mulled it over in his head, probably Luna.
Oh, that was nice. It made him wonder again, about his aunt and uncle. He hoped with a small part of him that Lord Voldemort had not spared them a single glance when he wiped them out. Or maybe if they had survived, they were far away in some outland.
The boy demanded so much attention, just by his walk. He looked over at the servants and smirked. Harry felt a shudder go through him. Such a beautiful boy, with such a terrifying smile. He looked over to Hermione who covered her stomach with an arm and stared at the floor. Ron held her gently, his arm behind her back. Harry’s eyes widened, and he looked back at the boy. The boy grinned at him, his eyes flaring with pride, before going to his seat at the table.
“So majestic, a Prince walking down a dirt road,” Harry scoffed. He smirked at Draco who glared at him. Luna turned a look of bewilderment on him.
“No, you haven’t met them yet. I believe you might sometime in the future. They are part of a royal family that doesn't get along too well with Draco’s,” Luna explains. She blushes and looks off into the distance. Harry noticed she didn’t specify which gender, but he didn’t want to push it any further, just in case she was worried about her crush being outed to the general public. If they didn’t get along well with Draco’s family, they probably didn't get along well with the Parkinson's either. So it was probably smart to keep their identity as secret as possible.
“What is going on here? Why are you here?” Luna asked. She looked at Draco, stepping between him and Harry just slightly. Harry didn’t like that too much. He backed away and stood off to the side. Draco glanced at him over Luna’s shoulder. “Draco, you can’t just leave the castle. We came here specifically for this, you can’t just leave them when it’s your duty to court one and choose.”
“Execute him.” The woman ordered. A few men came from his peripheral vision that he hadn’t noticed before.
Harry suddenly wondered if Hermione had to change Draco in the mornings in the way she’d taught him how to do. He wondered how Hermione felt about that. He wondered if she’d cared to notice his bruising or if maybe he had hid it from her. After what he’d overheard Draco doing to her, she probably just didn’t care.
There was a thud somewhere in the room, and before Harry could open his eyes and look around a strong hand gripped his arm and yanked him from the bed he was lying on. He yelped in shock and fell off the side of the bed. He looked up bewildered, his gaze was blurry from sleep but the long blonde hair alerted him that it was Luna.
“He is a good man. Not many people see it, but I can. I see a lot of things, Harry Potter.” Luna replied to him. Her voice came out as a whisper, but she was adamant on making him believe her, so he shut up about Draco.
“Hi, can I help you with something?” A sweet voice called from inside the barn. The doors were open, and the barn was dark inside. He couldn't see the person who spoke, but they could obviously see him.
“Astoria dear, elbows off the table, and sit up straight, don’t lean,” Daphne corrected. Astoria sat up straight, arms off the table but still looked quite interested.
Harry wondered how he didn’t fall off his horse, as they came to a standstill outside some trees. Luna and Draco were bickering by the time he arrived.
“Draco, I disagree with your decision to keep Harry with you. As much as I do agree that you need him, is it safe enough for him to stay on the same level as the royals? Shouldn’t he stay with the servants? He could also stay with me as well.” Luna whispered. She glanced around at the guards and servants to make sure they did not hear her.
“Why’re you so worried about Luna?” Draco’s question was nonchalant, but Harry detected a hint of the usual protective jealousy. Harry shrugged.
They cleaned the rest in silence, only speaking to give thanks to Cedric from Luna. The silence was comfortable as they walked into the common room. Harry heard a humming in the distance, signalling to him that Hermione as awake. Ron knocked gently on their closed door, and she opened it. She had cleaned the room, and organized all of the books into neater stacks and washed every single item of clothing.
Harry was beginning to see the silver lining in being a servant to the royal ass. Harry cleared his throat and breathed in again, having forgotten that he’d stopped breathing. Draco looked over at Harry and rose an eyebrow, seeing the boy freeze, he smirked and looked back over toward Hermione.
His ears flushed with embarrassment. “Sorry I was,” he paused.  “Why were you crying in the hallway earlier?”
With that she waved at the two boys and walked down the hallway. Draco sighed behind Harry and when Harry turned around to inquire, the Prince had wandered into the room. Rather than a joined room they had asked for there was simply a small divider with a bed behind it. Harry figured it was for him. Harry closed the door behind him when he entered into the room fully. Draco collapsed on the bed, and buried his face in the pillow.
“Good eyes, Harry! Draco, what are you doing here?” Luna laughed. She patted Harry on the back, and Draco watched the movement with his eyes before trailing them up to Harry’s hair. They locked eyes for a moment and Draco blushed furiously, Harry raised an eyebrow at him. He ran his hand through his new hair in confusion. Luna cleared her throat, and Draco flicked his head to look at her. She smiled, and he cleared his throat, his cheeks going pink.
Harry couldn’t see the Prince’s face, but he knew he didn’t need to, to know how the Prince was feeling. Draco was about to begin a decision that would change the rest of his life, and he didn’t even have a choice in the matter. Harry swallowed, realizing his throat was dry, and nodded. Draco made the servants seem nasty, and from what he’s heard from Luna and Hermione if their Princess was just as nasty then he’d understand.
“What is this?” Harry asked, finding it hard to keep the shakiness of anger out of his voice. Draco gripped the pillow beneath his head tighter. “Who did this to you?”
“Who are you? How did you get into the castle? How dare you just walk towards Lady Astoria? Filthy bastard, what were you planning to do to her?” The guard started dragging Harry towards what he presumed to be the door to the castle to throw him out.
“I’m Harry Potter, and as you already know I’m the servant to Prince Malfoy.” He finished cutting up his potatoes, and he scooped them all into a large clay bowl.
“I needed to escape. I could not stand to be there any longer,” Draco sighed. “I don’t understand how they work, I’m not ready for this. Where are your horses?”
“About what, mate?” Ron asked. Harry was shocked, absolutely flabbergasted. They didn’t believe a word Luna said, thought she was making up stories. Though to them perhaps she had, but Harry knew she wasn’t lying to him, he could hear it plain as day. She wouldn’t have faked the sadness in her voice as she spoke about her mother. Luna was not lying.
“Sorry, sorry.” Harry muttered, heart beating rapidly in his chest. He willed himself to calm down, before he died of embarrassment. “You just startled me.”
“She's my friend, I don’t like seeing my friends hurt.” He huffed. Hopefully putting Draco’s fears to rest. Heaven forbid Draco found out Luna liked someone, else he’d send the dogs.
“What’s your name?” He decided to change the subject, both as the one in his mind was growing confusing. She grinned at him and returned to her onions. The world around them seemed to slow as they started their conversation, everything in the kitchen moved as if it were a blur passing by his eyes in slow motion. He wondered if he was witnessing magic in its purest form of wonder, or if he was simply in need of water.
Harry felt like he was about to collapse by the time they finished cleaning the castle. Hermione had sent him down to the kitchen to tell the elves to make breakfast for the masters. He was on his way back up to the second floor to set the table for breakfast. It had felt like an entire day had passed, but it had only been a few hours, Harry wanted to sleep, eat, something.
His bare feet touched the cold floor and a shiver ran through his body as he walked towards the Prince’s bed. He clutched his nightshirt closer to his skin and hoped he wasn’t doing anything terribly alarming. He stood at the side of Draco’s bed for a moment, hoping he didn’t wake the Prince with his shuffling. Tears had made trails down Draco’s cheeks, and his face was scrunched up.
As he stood up he caught a glimpse out of the corner of his eye of red hair. There was a familiar sense in the air and he could have sworn that he heard a light bubbling laughter come from the direction in which the deer ran. Tears pricked at the back of his eyes as he thought of his mother, running through the woods with him as a child. He wondered if maybe the deer was the afterlife of his mother passing through.
“’Mione!” He shrieked. Hermione collapsed in Ron’s arms, her shirt cut open from the back and dangling from her shoulders. Ron pulled her into his chest so neither he nor Harry could see her nakedness. “Harry, go to Hermione’s bed, it’s the one next to mine. Grab a shirt, and a blanket. ‘Mione, Harry’s going to hand you a blanket, okay? I want you to cover your front with it, okay?”
Ron nodded vigorously. He held her as he moved to get up, and when he made sure she was covered, he walked past Harry to a bucket. Harry hadn’t even noticed it was there. He watched as Ron dipped the rag into the bucket, and began to dab it onto Hermione’s back. She began to cry. Harry walked over to her, and kneeled down in front of her. She tightened her grip on the blanket covering her chest.
Harry stopped walking and stared in the stall at the black horse. It was beautiful, it’s coat was brushed, and shining. It’s mane was long and combed, and it’s tail hung down to a little before it’s hooves. He looked at the stall door for a name; ‘Hedwig’.
Harry said nothing. There was an emptiness that filled his body. He stared Draco in the eye, tears welling, threatening to spill over. Draco’s eyes widened.
“You seem to get along with Luna well enough,” Draco started awkwardly. Harry blinked, startled. Draco was trying to make conversation.
“Really?” Harry asked as he stood up, ruffling his hair. Draco stood on the top step, and looked at Harry over his shoulder and said with a light smile,
“Oh Harry! There you are!” Luna, his savior, shouted from down the hall. She jogged up to them, grabbing Harry’s arm that was gripped tight in the guard’s arm. “Sir this boy is a guest here, he’s the servant of the Prince Malfoy. Please unhand him, I’m sure he just got lost looking for the kitchens. Didn’t you Harry?”
“Well, I didn't bring any belongings with me, so I don't have any clothes. These are Ron’s and they don't fit very well. I thought maybe if I made money on the job I could buy myself some clothes or something. I'm not asking for money or anything, I was just curious about it.” Harry explained, holding his hands up as reassurance. Draco nodded, understanding what the brunette meant.
“I find it best to start on the end where the stairs are not, so that when you work your way over, we can go straight up the stairs. I have a system. If Queen Narcissa decides to keep you, which I hope she does, she’ll give you your own assignments, and you can clean how you want.” Hermione smiled. She seemed to do a lot of smiling, for having just been tortured the night before. Harry guessed it must’ve had something to do with Ron.
“Oh yes, Colin helped me find it. He’s an interesting guy. Have you met him?” Harry asked. He was still standing in the middle of the room. She stood up from her chair, and pushed it back under the desk. She grabbed the crook of his arm and guided him to face away from her while she walked away.
As they walked down the street, they passed another sweets shop, this one a permanent store. They were making all sorts of things, and passersby could easily watch them through the window. Draco seemed transfixed on a type of candy inside the shop window. Little colorful sweets, perhaps a sweet or sour candy.
The sun had begun to set on the horizon, as Harry mounted Hedwig for the first time. His thighs ached at the stretch, Hedwig could use to lose some weight. He trailed his eyes along his steed, her muscles contracting under his weight. Luna had taught Hedwig well, he knew by the first step that Hedwig knew to follow. He on the other hand, did not.
Draco sat up slowly, Harry could tell his body was stiff by the way he moved. Draco winced as he sat up fully, looking sleepily around the room until his eyes landed on Harry. He scowled. Harry smiled warmly at him, and picked up the plate, and handed it to the blonde boy. Draco blushed slightly and tsked. Harry's eyes widened a fraction, and he looked away.
“You’re lucky my father approves of your mouth. Perhaps eventually I will as well,” Pansy flirted. Harry felt very uncomfortable suddenly, and shifted in his seat. Draco climbed back up onto Ulysses and gestured to the gates. He ignored her comment about his mouth, Harry noticed.
Harry jumped, and looked over his shoulder. Draco was stood behind him holding several squirrels attached to a string. Harry stood up and brushed himself off. He grabbed the kindling he’d found and faced Draco.
“What fairy tale do you live in Potter? I must find a good pure rich woman to take over the kingdom with me as my Queen. It is not about love, it is about finding a powerful suitor to hold power over a kingdom. It is about respect, it is purely business.” Draco snarled at him, with a not-so-hidden scoff.
“Alright, I can show you where to get the blankets and pillows, but you’ll need to retrieve Draco’s clothes on your own. I don’t think he’d take kindly to my being in his personal area,” Luna sighed. She started walking up the hill, not waiting to see if Harry was following.
“Well I have things to check up on, I’ll leave you be Harry. Make sure you’re well rested for the trip, and please refrain from pissing off Draco,” Her smile was sad, and she walked out of the room, her boots clicking on the wood floor. The door creaked shut, and Hermione and Harry were alone. There was shouting outside the door in the common room, and then it went silent. Harry glanced over at Hermione, who had her wand pointed at the door.
Harry sighed and handed his clothing over to the woman. Draco paid her, and Harry tucked it all into his bag. He was surprised it had fit in there but he remembered that Hermione had charmed it to grow with what he put in it. It amazed him if he were honest. Magic had never been a huge part of his life. His father had been a pureblood, but his mother was a muggle born witch, and his parents hadn’t taken too kindly towards it. Hence the reason they’d moved out to the kingdom she’d lived in. Which was the outskirts of what was now Azkaban.
“My name is Neville by the way! It was nice to meet you, Harry!” Neville yelled from down the hall. Harry threw a hand up as a slight wave in response, and then practically galloped up the stairs to the third floor.
“Narcissa has surprise checks on everyone's rooms. We're servants, we shan't be living in comfort. You'll receive a lashing for every item you've transfigured. Usually Narcissa does them, but sometimes she makes Prince Malfoy do them, the lashing I mean. Prince Malfoy would never step down here.” Hermione explained, shivering.
“Well, well Potter you seem to have gotten better at your slave duties, imagine that. Well done, I needn’t even ask.” Draco smirked and slid his leg over the horse. Harry felt his neck heat at the praise, although it had come with the sass as well, he’d done something right.
Draco opened the small wooden door that led into the kitchen. Harry hadn’t been inside yet, even if the commons for the servants quarters was directly behind it. The kitchen was massive, much bigger than the room looked from the outside. There were tables and tables of foods Harry had never seen before, fruits and vegetables. His stomach growled as he looked over all the freshly cut meats.
Draco stopped. Harry took another step back away from the Prince and towards the door. Draco looked regretful, in a way. Harry didn’t care, he kept going.
“It does not matter if I agree with it. The choice is not mine to make. I am fifteen years old. We will be done with this subject now.” Draco took off over the hill, leaving harry alone. He’d crossed a line somewhere. How awful, no wonder Draco had been silent for part of the trip, he was being forced to choose a suitor at such a young age. Harry never could have imagined, he wondered if the Queen love the King in Draco’s family, if maybe there was a sort of bond there rather than just power. Perhaps it explains Draco’s behavior towards others, how did his family treat him?
She led him to a shop that had a large white canopy over it. The sun was bright and cast large shadows into the tent. A woman was standing just inside the entrance. She smiled brightly at Luna, who hopped down from her horse and hugged the woman tight.
They were led down a hallway opposite the Prince’s quarters, and the change in artistry on the walls began to dissipate. Harry got a chill down his spine, and wanted to curl in on himself due to the aura that wafted down the hallway. Luna had her arms crossed across her chest, and was looking around at the plain painted walls.
“I’m the King’s ward. I’ve been living here since I was nine. So, I’m sorry if you don’t like them, but they’ve been taking good care of me for several years now. I simply can’t listen to anyone’s harsh comments.” Luna smiled at him. “Thank you, by the way. Your compliment was much appreciated.”
Harry climbed onto the bed and waited to see if Draco complained but when the blonde didn’t say anything, he continued to crawl over him on the bed and sat himself down on top of Draco’s arse. He blushed at the plushness of it, and was rather glad Draco was facing away from him. Though if he kept having such indecent thoughts Draco wouldn’t need to see his face in order to know how Harry was feeling.
The streets were dirty, covered in a dampness from the morning dew. Luna was wearing an interesting pink dress, he didn’t know quite how to explain it. Didn’t think he could if he tried. She bounced the heels of her boots against the stirrups. Hedwig neighed softly as Harry led her towards where Luna started toward a small hut. He noticed, while following her, that there were small stands that were selling street food, and candies.
“You trust too easily,” Hermione whispered, opening her eyes to look at Harry. She pulled away from Ron's embrace and turned to sit on Ron's bed. Ron sat across from her and motioned for Harry to sit as well. They had formed a triangle on Ron's bed.
“I was sleeping next to him. That’s all. My mother used to sleep next to me when I had bad dreams. So I thought I could help him because I couldn’t take it, hearing him cry like that.” He left out the details of him touching Draco, and soothing him, and brushing away his tears.
Draco turned back into his room, Harry followed suit, and shut the door. He began grabbing various shirts and pants much like the ones Draco was wearing, and placing them into a large satchel like bag that was laying on Draco’s bed.
Harry watched out of the corner of his eye as Luna turned around and began to change, her back facing him. Draco sent him a side glare and he looked away from the Princess. When Luna was done dressing she faced them and began to set up her cot. She spelled different things out of her pack, including what looked like a book. Harry sat down next to her on his bed. Draco began to move out of the corner of Harry’s eye. He began to peel his shirt off in front of the fire, grabbing his night clothes from his pack. Harry’s eyes lingered on the blonde’s smooth skin, the firelight licked the edges of his ribs and along the edges of his spine. There was a light around his hair, and the flames flickered light amongst the shadows. Harry swallowed thickly as he found himself wanting Draco to face him, and looked away when Draco pulled his night shirt over his head.
When he arrived at the stables, Harry found that Luna had pretty much packed everything onto the horses already. His blankets were neatly rolled and strapped onto the back of Hedwig’s saddle, and his bags of food and equipment were strapped to the sides.
“What are you doing?” The boy asked. Harry looked up at him for only a second before dragging Hermione and Ron to their shared room. The boy followed him in there and Harry sighed in slight annoyance.
“You’re dismissed, I’ll come get you if I need you.” He heard Draco say. Harry nodded to the blank space in front of him and walked out of Draco’s room. He shut the door with a light click, and walked down the hall to the stairs. He wanted to go outside, to see the gardens, and perhaps the blonde girl.
Luna turned and jumped when she saw him, holding a hand to her chest and calming the horse she startled by patting its nose.
“I hate him,” Harry seethed. He clenched his fists, and slammed one into the wooden kitchen door. Blaise jumped, and nearly spilled the trash on the ground. The boy glared up at Harry, and gathered himself quickly. Cedric handed Ron and Harry the plates they needed to carry, they’d return or more, since Hermione wasn’t there to help.
“Oh, no I was just exploring. I'm sorry to intrude.” Harry blushed, he must've looked like a fool just standing there. He rubbed the back of his neck with his hand and walked towards the barn. His eyes widened when he saw the pretty blonde girl from before.
He walked over to his bed behind the bamboo sheet. He shuffled through his clothes until he found his nicest pair of trousers and a nice shirt. Without looking in the Prince’s direction he began to undo his loose brown pants. He dropped them to his ankles and quickly changed into his nicer dark brown pants, hooking the tie around the cloth knob. He grabbed his cloth belt, and laced it through the loops atop his pants.
“Let’s go select your clothes for dinner, and get Draco fitted into something nice.” She walked out of the room, leaving him mouth agape staring after her. He walked down the hall, perhaps she just didn’t want to talk about his personal business. They reached the room Harry shared with Draco and Luna invited herself in. Harry paused for a moment before entering.
“He instigated it by existing! He acts like he’s so great, that he can do whatever he wants, and can treat whoever, however he wants,” Harry vented. Luna set her bucket down and walked up to him. She poked her finger into his face and he leaned back at the close proximity.

Harry looked up in time to see Cedric walk in carrying plates in his hands. They were filled with the most delicious, most delectable looking steaks Harry had ever seen in his life. There were different kinds of fruit, cut into small squares; oranges, apples, mangoes, a weird white and black speckled fruit. Harry grabbed it and popped it into his mouth, the taste was faint, like a pear but very light. It was chewy, melted in his mouth, and the seeds didn’t grind on his teeth like he thought they would, they just dissolved on his tongue. He ate the rest of the fruit slowly, enjoying the sweetness, fearing he may never taste anything so wonderful again.
“Let my servants show you your rooms. I suppose Draco, that you expect to room with your muggle mutt?”
“Malfoy, please. Allow me to care for them and bring them back to our room.” Harry pleaded, even bowing slightly. Draco looked over his shoulder.
“And what is it you’re laughing at?” Harry grumbled. Hermione shook her head, as Luna glanced over at her. Luna smiled at the both of them.
Harry followed Luna out of the room when she started towards the door. Harry didn’t miss the look of confusion on Draco’s face as he laid back down in bed.
“Oh! Prince Draco, how lovely you look! You’re positively glowing.” The girl had long braided dark hair and her smile was so bright Harry’s chest fluttered at it. This girl was so much more pleasant than Princess Pansy.
He covered her hand with his and squeezed it. “You know you’re very motherly when you try,” Harry laughed. She flushed and pulled her hand away, swatting him.
“It looks.. Lonely.” Harry whispered, looking back at Draco. The blonde’s eyes widened a fraction of an inch, but Harry caught it, and his own eyes widened. Draco tore his eyes away from the brunette’s and pointed to the closet.
The next morning, Harry woke to birds chirping outside the long thin windows at the top of the room. Harry dressed for the day, and looked around the sunlit room. He didn’t know what to expect of the day, he'd refused to hear Luna out any further.
“No, I never said I did,” He countered, and took a step back. “You didn’t answer my original question. Stop avoiding the question Luna.”
This is a note from the author. When I stopped writing this fic I was going through a lot, in the end life got in the way and I forgot about the story. I am so sorry that I just never updated. Thankfully though, my life is better now. I plan to continue the story, I hope you’re all still interested in it. Thank you for staying by me.
Harry went to search the chest where he’d put the trousers and other things that weren’t shirts. He grabbed a nice black belt and held it out for Draco. Draco fastened it around his waist and then began to spread his arms out. He was still and silent, and Harry wondered what thoughts were running through his head. Perhaps he felt Princely.
“Well I bet you’re both starved after that riveting discussion about the ‘royal prat’ last night. Why you kept talking about me although I was right there I wouldn’t know, would you happen to have something to say to my face, Potter?” Draco asked the next morning. They packed up their stuff as Draco was grabbing his hunting bow and sword.
Draco pulled the covers up over his head as the two continued their conversation. Harry felt strange, the royal prat hadn’t said anything to either of them, though he’d most definitely heard them. Harry left the subject be, and laid down in his bed. Draco was turned away from him, facing away from the fire, and Harry had the strangest urge to apologize.
Harry pulled away from the hug and looked up to see Draco walking down the hill towards them, a bag slung over his shoulders. He tossed it at Harry, who fumbled to catch it, and draped the bag over the horn of the saddle.
Harry waved his hands defensively, and blushed. “That is not what I meant, I’m bad with words. I’m sorry. What I meant is that you’re beautiful Malfoy, you don’t have to worry about what anyone says.”
“What will Luna and I be left to do whilst you ‘court’?” Harry asked, using the terminology Hermione had used at the Malfoy castle. Draco chuckled a little at his sentence. He shrugged.
Harry scrambled to his feet, and stood facing the Queen. The King walked into the room as well, followed by Draco. Hermione and Ron entered the room after him, and shut the door.
Draco was tense as Harry touched him, and it was beginning to annoy Harry. He was here trying to relax the blonde and the boy beneath him was only growing more tense. Harry leaned forward over Draco’s body towards his ear and whispered.
“I…” He looked up at her. Her expression was calm, and he wondered, how she could look so calm when she just blew his secret, everything he had tried to keep from coming out in the open since he ran away from home. “I don’t want to cause them any trouble, they- they don’t sense my magic like you do. They think I’m a muggle.”
Harry walked into the shop after the, and wandered off. It was a large outdoor store with the big white canopy he’d seen earlier, draped over poles rooted in the ground. There were rows and rows of tables, and on each table was a different item of clothing. Socks, trousers, shirts, belts, jackets, even hats. They seemed to range in price and materials.
The servants stared at them with wide eyes as Draco pointed out certain things. Things that the servants themselves could have shown him. When Draco turned and looked Harry in the eye, Harry saw a flicker of an emotion he’d seen plenty of times before. Draco wanted to show him the common room, because he knew the people were scared of him, and he
As he walked through the halls, he wondered who could have done such terrible things to Draco that could cause him to react so badly and in such a way. He wondered if Luna knew, if she knew who was doing it to Draco. He didn’t want to dwell on the thoughts. He put the thoughts aside and went to go find a House Elf or a maid to ask where Luna was.
Draco walked up behind Harry to say something when the Princess turned around again. Draco had paused and Harry looked over his shoulder at him ready to ask something when Astoria shouted, “If you need some help with the dinner tonight Harry you can ask one of the Greengrass’ servants, they’ll help you with anything. They’ll be wearing a red ribbon in their hair to help decipher the difference between everyone else who works here.”
“Well I watched you too. It doesn’t mean anything.” Harry side glanced to see if Draco was paying attention to their conversation. The blonde was doing something with his pack, not showing any signs of having heard them. Harry sighed in relief.
“Aren’t the stories she tells beautiful?” Hermione smiled. She hugged herself in content. Harry frowned.
“What, Harry Potter, did you think you were doing?” Luna’s voice rattled in her throat. Her eyes flared with something Harry hadn’t seen before.
Harry realized that the third floor was much nicer than the first and second, this must be where their rooms are. The stone was much lighter, had more of a slippery feel to it. Hermione had cleaned the third floor, she knew it better. Harry could almost tell the difference between his and Hermione’s cleaning. Perhaps Draco was right to make him clean the Throne Room again.
“Thank you, Harry.” Hermione whispered, pulling her head away from Ron’s shoulder. She looked up at Ron and smiled, despite her tears. Ron brushed some strands of hair out of her face. “There should be a cloth in a water bucket somewhere, Ron could you grab it?”
“Ah, yes. My father discussed this with me recently. Though I had no idea he had decided without me, that I am to be meeting with Pansy, and bringing Potter at that. I am well capable enough to go on my own.” Draco frowned. Hermione smiled and bit her lip.
“Luna, did something happen?” Harry asked, stepping closer to her. She brushed him aside, and started fixing together the bridles and saddles to bring down to the stables. “Luna, please. You don’t usually act like this, from what I’ve seen anyway.”
“Help me carry these to the table please.” She turned around to grab onions off the table she’d been peeling them on, and went to set them on the cutting board. “Well don’t just stand there, if you’re going to help get on with it.”
“Stories? She was telling the truth,” Harry gritted out. Ron glanced down at Harry’s fists, and raised an eyebrow.
“Outskirts. My mother was poor, and my father, though he was a pureblood, he moved in with her. We had a farm, a house elf, a dog. We had big open plains, but we survived on very little. He took everything, we had porridge and corn, that was it. We were happy, but we weren’t good enough for him.” Harry whispered. He buried his head in his arms and pulled his knees to his chest.
He brushed off the dirt and patted down the pillow to remove the dust. Perhaps Hermione could teach him home how to clean beds first. He turned away from Ron and looked at the books next to his new bed. The door to the servant’s room creaked open, and his eyes widened. He quickly glanced over his shoulder to see Ron bolting out of bed and towards the door.
