Harry, Draco and Neville soon followed the two and walked with their partnered Bridesmaids, Luna and Ginny, whilst Ron had three groomsmen Hermione had decided to only have two bridesmaids. Leaving Neville, the tail of the line.
Draco wrapped his thin arms around Harrys torso, Draco didn't know how one person could make him feel so warm and… Complete. Harrys strong build encompassed him, for the first time in a long while Draco felt content, he felt safe.
Harry listened intently and the gratitude that he already felt towards Minerva quadrupled. The two soon had arrived at Harrys classroom. “You don’t have a class next?” Harry asked.
Harry sighed and got up. “I have to go get my books anyways, I’ll see if I can find it, its probably under your bed or something.”
Harry turned around at the sound of Draco’s voice calling him. Harry really didn't want to turn around but he knew that he couldn't avoid Draco forever and he didn't want to be rude.
Draco flopped onto the bed once again, this time slipping under the covers and trying to go to sleep. But he couldn't. The emptiness on the other side of the bed unfamiliar and uncomfortable.
Harrys turn soon arrived, for some reason he was placed at the last of the line, this reason was unknown to him, but the Great Hall became absolutely silent when Professor McGonagall called out his name.
Harry smiled lightly at him, having to slightly force it, “I’m okay thanks Neville, sorry for waking you all up.”
Realisation struck Harry as Hermione spoke and he groaned, for he had forgotten momentarily about Sirius and Remus.
Harry nodded and got comfortable in the bed, the mattress was nothing like the soft pillowy mattresses of his dorm, but it sufficed and soon the affects of the potion over came him.
“Ger’ off.” Harry mumbled; he could hear Hermione rolling her eyes. Harry finally sat up, rubbing the heaviness away from his eyes.
Harry quickly turned to Sirius and Remus, fiercely hugging the both of them, both men had tears swimming in their eyes, Harry himself was beginning to tear up.
Harry perked up when he heard footsteps coming from the stairs and was a little surprised to find it was Hermione. Hermione smiled at the sight of Harry and she strolled over to him, her arms full of books.
I only stuck my tongue out in defence. I buttered my toast and put the leftover bacon onto it, I took a big bite and let out a deep moan as the greasy meaty flavour took over my mouth.
Hermione seemed to relax a bit more, but he knew she would continue to worry until he saw how he really went in his first game.
They both continued to walk in amicable silence, not really any aim to their walking, just walking. When unfortunately, the loud sound of footsteps made them suddenly remember the sort of situation they were in.
“The Sorting Ceremony will be beginning shortly, come line up in the order that I call your names in and wait quietly please.”
The soft cooing of Blue woke Harry up. Blue perched on his bed side table softly pecked at Harrys fingers, a letter lay on Harrys bed. Harrys groaned and old man groan as he sat himself up and placed his glasses on. The letter had the Hogwarts seal on it, Harry opened it with anticipated breath.
Harry finally made it to the dungeons and to Snapes classroom. He took a deep breathe before knocking on the door twice.
He searched the field, his eyes darting and tracing for any sort of gleam or golden colour, finally what felt like hours he finally noticed a golden gleam reflect from the corner of his eye, Harry quickly swivelled in the direction of the snitch, hovering by the goal posts. He shot straight towards it, for he knew how fast those little shiny balls could be, and he would have to use the art of surprise to have any advantage on the tiny snitch.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut as the thundering came closer and closer, he cringed and waited for the impact of the troll breaking the door open, but it never came. The thundering soon became distant, the troll had gone past him. Harry sighed in relief, he quicky scrambled out of the toilet and waited by the door to make sure that it was clear before he opened the door.
The memory was one to last, Ron ended up in State Mungos with a broken leg and multiple hexes to treat, Hermione soon turned up, nights when Ron went out she was always prepared for the worst. Harry making sure that Ron would be okay left with a smile to both Ron and Hermione. At least they caught the bastard.
"Well Harry for this interview I am just going to ask the usual questions and you just answer them to the best of your ability." Her voice had gone to the way that he always remembered it from his Hogwarts days.
The room filled with silence. "You know I don't blame you Draco." Harry this time looked into the stormy grey eyes of Draco, Draco looked back, his eyes deepening in colour.
McGonagall nodded. “Yes, that is true, and it took a great amount of determination to persuade Professor Dumbledore to allow you on the team even though you are a first year.”
"Nothing that Ron can't take of I'm sure." Neville beamed. That was true the past six years that Ron had been with the Aurors Ron had certainly become a formidable wizard, some would say almost better than Harry.
Harry and Draco sat together and watched the married couple have their first dance. "This is all quite a lot." Draco stated, but his eyes softened with warmth. "Yes, Hermione got a bit excited I think." He chuckled softly. Dracos hand unconsciously found Harrys and held it softly, wrapping his fingers in between Harrys. Harry smiled at him softly and for the rest of the night they continued to hold hands whilst mingling with the new married couple and the guests.
Harry finally emerged out of the room, his black suit on but his blue tie crooked. Draco once again sighed and rolled his eyes at Harry. "Come here." Harry smiled sheepishly and stood in front of Draco who had to retie the mess Harry made and straighten it. "Thank you love." Harry placed a soft kiss on Draco's lips. Even after three years of being together, Draco never ceased from giving him butterflies. Dracos eyes fluttered opened when Harry leaned back, separating their lips, Draco still would never get over that Harry was his, and he was Harrys.
“Yeah I slept really well too.” Harry replied. Draco smiled that smile of his and turned away to the kitchen. “I guess we’re going to have to skip breakfast this morning, ill just call an elf to bring something for us.”
Harry made it to his class room with a minute to spare, the class had already let themselves into the room and taken their seats.
Harry began. “I’m sorry I honestly know how stupid I was being, but I was being a coward and didn’t want to face you… cause I don’t want to lose you.”
"What are you thinking?" He whispered, a shiver ran down my spine, his husky voice resonating to my core. "I'm thinking about how I can't believe that you are mine."
“Of course.” Harry nodded, happy to be able to share at least something that he liked to do in his spare time with someone else, Ron really was his only friend his age and he wouldn’t dare to touch a book.
The first years made way to the bank of an ocean large lake. All awed as they saw the castle glistening in the dark night, the castle looked like something out of a fairy tale book.
“Well you can walk Neville back to his dorm then, he’s all good to go.” The nurse said, she gave Neville a friendly pat on the arm, Neville smiled at her and quickly made way to Harry.
The food quickly appeared with his words and Harry looked amazingly at all the food on the table. In his excitement he completely piled his plate with food and instantly dug in. The food was amazing but a sudden pang in his chest reminded him that this food would never be as good as Remus’s home cooking.
Even though my wand was returned to me, I still enjoyed the simple and rewarding pleasures of cleaning and cooking by hand, not just allowing my magic to do it all. The fire crackled from the living room and footsteps soon greeted my ears.
“Merlin the food smells amazing what are you cooking?” Harry stepped into the make-shift kitchen that Draco transfigured when he cooked meals like these, the tiny sink that his room regularly contained would not do to make hearty home cooked meals. Harry took a peak around Dracos shoulder, a white apron wrapped around his lean figure and a casual grey button up that he wore beneath. Harry took opportunity to look at those delectable collar bones of his. Draco cleared his throat, Harry knew this as Draco trying to cover the embarrassment he was feeling. Harry took a step back once he knew that he had accomplished a nice blush splotching around Dracos neck.
By the time he was finished with the first shelf his fingers ached and his back was sore, when checking his watch, it was already ten at night. Snape had been in and out of the classroom, they never spoke a word to each other. Snape had come to his desk once to ensure he was cleaning the jars properly, seemingly satisfied he walked away without saying a thing.
Hermione nodded and closed her eyes, she took a deep breathe and relaxed her shoulders. After a moment she firmly said, “rise up!” And the broom shot into her hand.
His pale freckled face lit up with a smile and Harry couldn’t help but do the same. Of course, Harry himself was excited for Hogwarts, he had been dreaming about attending it since Sirius began telling him stories about him and his Marauder days. However, there was still this spreading ache in his chest the further and further that he got from home, he didn’t know how he was going to last till Christmas to see his uncles.
anyways hope you guys enjoyed this cute little chapter and the bonding with Draco, its so soft and mushy it always makes me smile when i read it.
He pecked me on the lips and moved towards the kitchen. "I'm starving!" He moaned and sat down at one of the kitchen stools.
"Hmmm." The man stroked his short blonde beard in thought and soon came to a resolution. "I think you may be a worthy enough candidate, when I release him from the cage and place him on your arm, if he rubs his beak across your cheek, he has accepted you, however If he doesn't he will probably shred your arm to pieces."
“And impressive ten minutes and thirty five seconds!” Oliver beamed out, clapping his hand heartily on the back of Harrys back.
"Blimey we better hurry if we don't want to miss the ceremony!" Hagrid lifted himself off his stool threw a bone at fang before he closed the door. Harry and Hagrid hurried across the lawn towards the great hall, making it in time before the ceremony, however the hall already packed with all the students at Hogwarts. Harry smiled at the students as he walked down through the house tables, conversations dulled down to whispers as Harry took the empty seat next to Draco. McGonagall walked up and placed the sorting hat and its stool in the usual spot. The sorting hat sang its song that had taken all year for it to conjure then fell back into its usual silence, waiting for the first young head to be placed upon it.
“Wingardium Leviosa!” Someone yelled, Harry quickly turned and there was a red flushed Ron standing next to him along with Hermione.
The next day Harry awoke feeling excited for the day, today was the first day of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry quickly got dressed, he was once again the first one to wake up in his dorm. Harry picked up his DADA textbook and slowly made his way downstairs. He picked up a little cushion from one of the couches and placed it on the windowsill, a nice little seat for him and his new reading nook.
“Twenty points from Gryffindor and two weeks worth of detention with me.” Snape sneered but before Harry walked into the classroom Snape spoke once again.
Harry gave him a serious look, “doesn’t mean I appreciate you treating my best friend like that.” Harry said trying to keep his cool demeanour.
“Go put on one of the aprons and I want you to first start by taking each shelf of jars down and cleaning them, sit at that table over there there’s already a cloth and water, you can go back to your dorm once you’ve cleaned a shelf of jars.”
Harry eyes widened with realisation, “oh well they’re sort of like dwarves cause they’re small, but they look more like human except they have really big feet.”
Draco my dear I think it is wise for you to stay at Hogwarts for the holidays, this is not up for debate.
"Rose you're making a mess!" Hermione complained and quickly went to clean her dress, I couldn't help but stop her.
“I always knew Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus loved each other, so its okay to show me that you love each other.”
The end of the year came and went for Harry and in two week's time he would be starting his new job at Hogwarts as the new professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry and Malfoy had been corresponding back and forth for the last two months since he got accepted for the job, and for some reason Harry was feeling extremely nervous in seeing Malfoy in person. It was a lot easier to talk to him by letter than in person.
Draco swallowed, his adam's apple bobbing smoothly up and down, drawing Harrys eyes away from his face. "Wh…" He took a deep breathe. Come on Draco you can do this for Merlins sake! He yelled at himself.
“Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me," Hermione gushed. "Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.”
Harry jumped out of bed and quickly changed into his uniform, he looked down too his watch and realised it was only six in the morning, that would explain why no one had woken up yet. Harry decided that he would poke around the common room whilst he waited for Ron to wake up. He slowly went down the stairs, trying to make as little noise as possible.
"Good to be home." He whispered, his lips met the side of my cheek, causing butterflies to explode in my stomach, his lips continued to kiss down my neck, I moved my neck to the side to allow him more access, my eyes fluttered shut.
“Well two weeks of detention isn’t so bad, once the twins exploded a cauldron in Snapes class on purpose and they got a months’ worth of detention cleaning the toilets with filch.”
“Going to lunch little shit.” Fred snickered, he rubbed his brothers hair and began to walk away, George giving him a soft punch on the arm in passing.
The multiple cracks of wizards arriving alerted both the men, Remus instantly had his wand pointing at the door, Sirius stepped slightly behind Remus and hugged Harry closer to his body. The thundering steps of multiple wizards storming up the stairs caused both men to hold their breathes in anticipation. Remus could hear both their hearts racing against their chests, he was however constantly aware of Harry, who had the calm heartbeat of a sleeping baby.
They ate breakfast, and unusually Professor Quirrell was not seen during breakfast, Harry hoped this meant that he was preparing an awesome first lesson. After eating, Harry once again saw Draco, but Draco was talking quite animatedly to a boy that he recognised but couldn’t remember the name of.
Draco looked up as if sensing someone looking at him, he looked towards Harry, his eyes sharp grey locking with Harrys stormy green eyes. Draco nodded and looked away resuming his lunch. Harry looked away and down at his food, he had known about Neville but not about Draco, when the bloody merlin had Draco started teaching here?
“It’s so unfair, I now have two week’s worth of detention with Professor Snape.” Harry sighed; he was really dreading it.
Harry didn’t know how to react to this sudden exposure of emotions that Draco was showing. Draco wiped away a few stray tears with the sleeve of his black cloak and sniffed. “I’m sorry about that.” Draco forced a laugh and picked up a cup to occupy his hands.
The both semi crawled through the small entrance, there wasn’t enough room for them to stand up straight so they had to bend quite far down to shuffle through. Thankfully the little tunnel was short and soon Harry found himself situated in a giant kitchen buzzing with little creatures, Harry took a moment to remember that they were house elves.
Draco cleared his throat. "Yes well, I wanted everyone here to know that I am not what I used to be, I try to be a kind and understanding professor where possible." Draco kept his head forward, Harry thought this understanding of Draco, knowing how hard it would've been for him when he first started and the lack of respect that he got from his students.
My eyes open to find I am no longer sleeping cuddled against Harry, but a child perhaps at the age of two or three is wedged between us. The child is turned away from me, but his hair reminds me very much of Harrys, midnight black and unruly.
“Goblins love gold, that’s why the ministry have employed them as our bankers, they would do anything to protect gold, even if it means working for nasty old wizards like us.”
Harry and Ron were very quickly shoving their faces with food, whilst Hermione ate with grace and manners. Harry felt sorry for Hermione having to stick with their horrible eating habits, and surprisingly a girl from his year sat next to Hermione and began talking to her. Harry desperately tried to remember what her name was but it wasn’t coming to mind, he would have to ask Hermione later.
Harry turned to Draco, his emerald eyes searching him peculiarly. “Yeah what’s up?” Harry continued to pack his bag as he waited to for Draco to ask him about this something.
Draco’s face falls in disappointment and Harry doesn't know why. “Is that what you want Harry?” Draco asks.
“Nah Harry I say good job on defending yourself, he’s a teacher, but that doesn’t mean he gets to be so horrible to you.”
"What didn't you tell me?" The toaster jumped out of the toaster, which slightly scared me, but I composed myself and quickly took it out with my fingertips and plopped it onto Dracos plate.
“Why did you have to think so hard about that?” Harry turned away and kept on walking, it seemed they were walking towards the greenhouses. Draco quickly caught up with him, and once again they were walking in a natural unison.
Draco still felt utterly confused with what he was feeling with Harry, just thinking about Harry made his heart pound and cause shivers to dance across his skin, and being in the presence of Harry just made those sensations all but greater. Harry turned around and cleared his throat to awaken Draco from his thoughts.
On his way back home, Harry wondered whether or not he should call Sarah or if he should just let the number lay forgotten. However, he did not have much time to worry about that, as soon as he made it to his front door something felt incredibly wrong. The hair at the back of Harrys neck stood on end, Harrys wand instantly appeared in his hand. The first thing Harry noticed wrong was the wards that protected him home from intruders had been broken. Harry didn't know whether or not to enter his house or to call for backup. His wards were one of the most powerful wards that he could conjure, they were almost on par with the wards protecting Hogwarts.
“Oh no no its fine we’ll take it.” He said hurriedly. The elf smiled and handed him the basket, Harry took it and nearly dropped it due to how heavy it was.
Harry Potter looked up into glistening grey eyes of Sirius Black and he instantly calmed down. Sirius face was taught with grief and tears that he could not stop streamed down his face. The crack of someone apparating alerted Sirius and he desperately looked around for his wand which he had placed somewhere in his panic. But soon the familiar face of Remus Lupin bolted through the nursery.
“Tell Professor McGonagall that I will see her after her lesson.” Snape gave one last disgusted look at Harry before turning around and flowing away.
“Hmm I remember, but I also recall a little something about you laughing at my snoring.” Harry said, a small smirk playing on his lips as he stepped closer to Ron.
Harry hurried to his next class, and the day went by in a whirlwind, his head was still stuck on that quidditch field, chasing for that snitch and he was quite ready to leave yet.
"Welcome home love." My chest somehow felt lighter now that Harry was home. He always brought this irreplaceable sense of calm to me.
“Well Harry perhaps this discussion is coming to a close.” Minerva gets up from her seat, advising Harry to do so. He gets up, thankful for this conversation to be ending.
"Harry?" Draco called softly. Harry looked up and swung the chair around to face Draco. A small box lay in his lap and a trickle of tears streamed down his face. "Harry what's wrong!?" Draco exclaimed rushing to be closer and went down on his knees to be eye level with him.
“I’m sure you will, after everything you’ve been through after all.” Hermione said, Harry got a little upset about this, he barely knew Hermione and all she knew was something written in a book, she didn’t know anything.
“I was just saying hi that’s all, I think he’s my friend now.” Harry shrugged, he sat down next to Ron and put some more toast onto his plate.
"How have you been Harry?" She continued. Harry looked up and thought whether or not to answer her honestly. "Good as I can be I guess." He shrugged. Then he remembered something that turned the conversation around. "Hey I heard you got drafted into the Harpies." Ginnys face lit up.
“I’m not really sure, I think I wanted to show off by showing I could easily become friends with The Harry Potter.”
So, he picked up his smile and continued to introduce the lesson, the bell rang and all the students left with smiles brightening their faces. Harry let out a sigh of relief, by some miracle the class paid attention and didn’t question him about unnecessary things that weren’t related to the class.
Draco clapped his hands to break the warming atmosphere, they had no time to mess around or they would be late. "Okay we need to go or were going to be late, do you have everything, wand, the gift, wait I almost forgot!" Draco rushed into the study and grabbed the promise ring he received from Harry for their first anniversary. Harry frowned. "Why did you take it off?"
I shivered and smiled softly, the ache in my chest suddenly disappearing just from the sound of his voice. Harry took my hand and kissed it gently. "I think I'm ready for that talk." He murmured.
Harry stumbled and stood, still grasping his wand in his hand he now pointed it at the troll, but any spells that he remembered suddenly evaded him.
“I am going to test you, a seekers main goal is to catch the snitch, so for now I want to see if you can achieve this.” Oliver stepped towards him and handed him a broom that wasn’t used for quidditch lessons, it felt a lot younger and more reliable, this must have been one of the teams brooms.
“No, it’s just I’m surprised is all, you can stay and eat if you would like.” Malfoy seemed to have gathered himself some more and he sat up straighter, brushing down his clothes with the decorum of a snobbish person.
Sirius shuffled through papers that needed to be read and signed and flicked through tax files that he had to approve of. He had multiple party invitations from families that he had not met in years to decline and business proposals to regard. The waning hours of the night soon drifted into the morning and the light patter of feet coming down the hallway indicated that Harry had woken up. Sirius opened his door from his office and greeted a yawning Harry with a bright smile.
Draco gave him the side eye, “sorry I guess I got a bit nervous talking to you whilst you were with your friends.”
“Well, if you want it then… you’ll just have to get it.” Quickly Zabini mounted his broom rose high into the air and threw the ball as hard as he could. Harry without much thought hurriedly grabbed his broom and zoomed after the ball, desperately hoping he could catch it. He flew, adrenalin rushing through his veins and outstretched his hand the ball falling in what felt like slow motion. Finally, his fingers clasped over the ball and Harry had to do a flip in order not to crash into the wall he was very close to hitting.
Feeling satisfied he opened the door and quietly stepped out of it but gasped as he found himself facing a very angry troll.
He wore a light blue woollen cardigan and pressed jeans with a pair of black shoes, his cardigan matched the colour of his eyes and his jeans hugged the shape of his legs. I stopped roaming his body with my eyes and looked to his face, a slight smirk sat there.
One thing Draco learned in the time he shared a dormitory with Harry was that he had an unusual habit of sleep walking. Harry mumbled something that he couldn't quite hear and crashed into one the couches.
Sirius just smiled widely and ruffled Harrys too, “that’s my little man.” He said, Remus nearly burst out crying.
"Can I see if he will accept me?" I asked hesitantly, the Gryffindor in me wanting to take the challenge.
Harry doesn't know what to say, usually he had plenty of things to say but he really doesn't. First he had to try and make out what Draco was trying to say, was Draco trying to say that he liked him, or was he just angry that Harry had been avoiding him all day?
“Sirius!” Remus gasped, he already had tears falling from dark green eyes. The two young men stood together, communicating although no words were spoken whilst Harry finally fell asleep in Sirius’s arms.
“Don’t worry Harry im sure you will do fine.” Oliver smiled, noticing the shift in Harrys expression as he eyed the snitch.
With lunch being over and still twenty minutes to spare before class, Harry and Ron decided that they wanted to explore around a bit, Hermione begrudgingly agreed. Harry once again took out his map and they wandered around for a bit, when they suddenly ran into the Weasley twins.
“I was just about to get my books for class.” Harry said, hoping that he could avoid whatever McGonagall wanted him to do for the morning.
A house elf poked him in the cheek. “Professor Potter needs to wake up.” The elf squeaked, feeling conflicted in having to poke the professor in order to wake him up. Harry moaned and swatted the hand away, the elf squeaked again, this time in shock. Harry grumbled something that could not be understood and slowly opened his eyes. “Dobby?” Harry mumbled incoherently. The elf quickly shook his tiny head. “No professor I am not Dobby, I am Winnie.” The elf bowed their head.
Everyone shuffled along, trying to get to a broom, Harry stood next to his feeling confident in his abilities, as he looked around, he could see some were a bit nervous and some like him were confident.
Harry slowly makes his way to the Great Hall, he woke up way before breakfast, however he also didn't want to face Draco so early in the morning. Harry looks down to his watch, there's still 15 minutes left of breakfast, maybe he should just hike up his shorts and be a man. As he makes his way to breakfast a few last minuters rush towards the hall, all bed hair and unstraightened ties. Harry goes through the back entrance, eyeing the table and seeing that Draco has already started breakfast with a seat empty to his right. Harry cleared his throat and casts a quick scourgify on himself, careful not to aim towards his face, he really didn't feel like some soap in his mouth.
"You can always call if you need backup." Harry chuckled back, his heart softly aching with the knowledge that he would no longer be working side by side with Ron. Ron and Hermione left too, with a wave goodbye Harry closed the front door.
“What do you mean Harry? The new seeker, but I thought only second years and above could try out for the quidditch team?”
Harry stopped and turned, he sighed internally, there was only two reasons why McGonagall would be looking for her. One, there was a task that he wanted him to do, or two, he had homework that he had forgotten to hand in.
Draco blushed and slipped onto his right-hand ring finger. "I was playing with it and forgot to put it back on." Harry breathed out a breath of relief. "Oh okay, jeez you scared me!"
"What… What are you doing here… No how are you here?!" He did not say anything but simply fluttered past me, I could do nothing but follow. His ghostly figure floated through the aisles until he stopped beside a red owl. The owl somewhat represented a phoenix but had the distinct features of an owl, its dark red eyes wild and fiery, almost as if fire was sprouting out of them, its feathers saturated with the dark shades of red and a touch of purple. I looked to Dumbledore to ask another question, but he simply winked and disappeared. Soon a door opened and shut, and a man of short stature and curly blonde hair made his way towards me.
"Go to bed then." Harry ran his fingers through his hair stress-fully. Seriously what is so important about this thing that he is looking for? Draco thought tiredly. His patience now beginning to walk on a thin line. "Fine then I'm going to bed!" He huffed and stomped to the bedroom. He was hoping Sirius would be on the couch so he could scoop him up and make him sleep with him, but he wasn't and Draco couldn't be stuffed going to look for him.
Draco got out of the shower wrapping his soft white towel around his torso, Draco now knew that he couldn’t face Harry tomorrow not until he figured out exactly how he feels about Harry.
They all rushed into Charms out of breathe. Professor Flitwick who was standing on a tall pile of books gave them an appraising look but said nothing, letting them bustle into their sits before he continued his introduction to the class.
“Good, you’ll have to listen to every word I say mistakes can’t be made when helping me with these precious ingredients, they are grown by a friend of mine and I do not wish to waste them.”
"Here will be your room, feel free to unpack now, and oh I almost forgot Hagrid is waiting for you down at his hut."
Harry walked quickly back to the dorms, he needed to hurry if he didn’t want to be late for class. He would have to hurry looking for Hermiones book or he wouldn’t be able to hear the end of it.
"Draco." Harry breathed. He took a small hazardous step towards him, Draco too stunned to take one back. "My patience is wearing thin." He leaned forward to whisper in Draco's ear, he had to use all his will power to repress the smile knowing the shiver that Draco responded with was caused by him.
“Sorry you must have been waiting pretty patiently.” Sirius chuckled and he put the glass down heading towards the shelf, “what book do you want kiddo?”
The night soon came to a rest and everyone climbed into their beds. Harry was exhausted and feeling very full from the feast. He slept dreaming of long hallways, moving staircases and Remus’s homemade dinner. He awoke feel well rested and excited for first day of classes.
"This." He proclaimed before taking Draco's mouth against his own. Draco too shocked did not respond to the warm lips against his own. This feeling so very unfamiliar to him. He had dreamed of this moment countless times but did not know the true spectrum of feelings that would erupt in his stomach when it finally happened.
“What does your garden smell like?” Harry asked further, his yearning to want to know everything about Draco slightly shining through.
“Haven’t seen you here in while Mr Malfoy, how are you?” She asked as he plopped his usual in front of him.
“Please Professor McGonagall they were looking for me.” Hermione spoke, a blush splotching her cheeks, both Harry and Ron turned to her with identical shocked expression.
Lavender watched on with an amused smile on her lips, almost like she knew exactly where they had been.
The weeks fluttered by. With Harry and Draco continuing their relationship in secret and students quickly realising what was happening behind the scenes.
The bell rang and the door opened, Professor Quirrell had a nervous smile on his face as he let the students in. Quirrell still had the same purple turban on his head and Harry wondered if the man was trying to make some sort of fashion statement or if he was simply afraid to show that he was bold. Harry when looking at Quirrell realised that the Professor was avoiding eye contact with him. Harry found this weird, no one had ever tried to avoid eye contact him, even Professor Snape who he had found was sometimes glaring at him.
Harry although he liked being with Ron in classes yearned that he would be sitting with Draco, he tried his best to pay attention to Snape, but he couldn’t help but have his eyes on the back of Dracos head for half of the lesson. Snape although in a fowl mood taught clearly, his instructions were easy to understand and simplified enough that even six-year-olds could’ve learnt to do the potion they were learning if they tried enough. Harry noted everything that Snape said diligently, making sure to not lose a single detail that was told.
“Yep I hope we have good classes for our first day.” Harry nodded, smiling back infected by Hermione’s smile.
“No well I am of course, but the Slytherins are quite cold to each other sometimes and its just so different seeing you Gryffindors being all warm and close, it makes me want something like that too.” Draco said, choosing his words carefully.
The last week of school passed by fairly quickly. Draco mostly lived through it by ignoring Harry in every way possible and leaching himself onto Blaise and Pansy. Harry lived through the week puzzled and feeling slightly upset by Draco's behaviour.
Ron laughed nervously, “hey now are you forgetting that I’m your bestest friend in the world and that you love me.”
“Even though Draco is my friend now, he’s never gonna replace you, who am I going to talk about quidditch with or get absolutely murdered in Chess or sneak around pulling pranks? Cause I can’t do all of that with Draco, he’s too… Draco.”
“No but if you don’t hurry up you will.” Harry threw the duvet off Ron before quickly rushing down the stairs, Ron narrowly missed his head with the pillow he threw.
Time moved on and soon dinner had come and gone, with neither Draco or Harry mentioning what Harry was going to say that night. They both made way to their respective rooms, Harry needed to somehow mentally prepare himself for what he was about to do. There were three potential ways that this could go.
Harry tries to swallow the growing lump in his throat however it just seems to get bigger and bigger.
That Draco Malfoy was next, he placed the hat only slightly on his head and the hat instantly bellowed Slytherin. Draco sniffed proudly and strode to the Slytherin table, sitting next his fellow first years, a few pats on the back from other year levels were awarded to him.
Harry landed by Zabini, “look Zabini I know you want to show off and be cool but messing around with other people’s stuff or bullying people isn’t cool.” Harry said, he left it at that and turned around going back to his friends and sitting in the grass with them.
Harry walked into the dorms and quickly grabbed his book bag with the things he would need for charms. He looked around and found Ron already asleep in his bed. Seamus and Dean were murmuring about something on Deans bed.
"Jeez you really love your bacon don't you love?" Draco looked semi-disgusted as he watched me chew on my heavenly toast. I only nodded my head, as I knew how much Draco hated when I spoke with my mouth full of food. Draco and I finished the rest of our food in silence. Draco finished before me and went to get ready whilst I finished munching on my bacon toast. He emerged out of our bedroom in casual clothing, over the years of our relationship I had slowly coaxed him into dressing with muggle clothes, however he still kept his fashion quite high standard for muggle clothing.
“Yeah, they made me catch a snitch, caught it in ten minutes, it was… one of the best things that I have ever done.” Harry smiled nostalgically, even if this event had only occurred this morning.
The snitch nearly at arms lengths finally darted away from Harrys reach and shot high into the sky, Harry followed with determination, flattening his body against the broom to gain speed and elevation. The snitch now closer than ever, Harry uncurled his right hand from the tight grip he had on the broom and outstretched for the snitch, his fingers straining as he desperaley tried to keep both speed and balance in order to catch the snitch within his grasp.
Draco only nodded his head, keeping his eyes away from mine, I will always love how Draco still gets embarrassed by me, always. I quickly chucked on a white t-shirt and a pair of loose jeans, I accioed my sneakers from my closest as I knew I wouldn't be able to find them any other way. I hurriedly slipped them on and tied them, as I exited the bedroom Draco was there waiting by the fireplace, fidgeting with the end of his cardigan.
"Draco!" He growled. My lips curled into a smile on his skin, I moved my hands to his buckle and unbuckled it almost in slow motion. Harry's chest rose and fell quickly, I could hear his heart pounding violently. With the buckle gone Harry lifted his hips up to make it easier to slip off his pants, all that was left restricting him was his underwear, and soon they were gone too.
“Why don’t we go back to the tower to just get our books in order than we can make our way to the greenhouses?”
Draco than thought was a relationship worth ruining the friendship that he so adored with Harry? Could becoming his boyfriend ruin everything that he had worked so hard for with Harry?
“Okay Uncle Remus firstly, I asked Sirius this, but he wasn’t sure, but do Hobbits actually exist?” Harry asked, the book wide open as Harry skimmed through looking for references for his questions.
Madame Hooch nodded her head and left continuing to make her rounds. Harry desperately just wanted to shoot into the air and fly around, but he didn’t want to get on the bad side of Hooch. Eventually they were allowed to begin to do low laps around the quidditch field, Harry and Ron raced laughing gleefully, Hooch thankfully didn’t yell at them.
Draco makes his way outside of the castle wards so that he can apparate the rest of the way, however as he leaves the wards he decides that a nice walk in the crisp morning air is a good way to clear ones mind.
I sighed and rubbed circles around his wrist with the pad of my thumb. "Harry as long as I have you I will never be scared." I whispered into his ear.
Ron cleared his throat and waved his hand at the sleeping rat, “sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” The rat did not move and neither did it turn yellow.
Ron kept trying to encourage Hermione about riding brooms for the rest of the way to the Great Hall, Harry thought it was pointless himself so he just listened in or zoned out and thought about his day with Draco yesterday.
Hermione just giggled a little. “It’s okay, so have you and Harry known each other for a long time then?” She asked, slowly eating her food with small mouthfuls.
“Yeah well, my parents don’t cook so I’m not really sure what a nice home cooked dinner smells like, and the next best smelling place in my memory is my garden.” Draco shrugged. Harry stored this piece of information into a safe place in his brain, this felt like it was something that Draco wouldn’t tell another person.
This made Harry feel better slightly, but also nervous, what was Snape going to make him do for two weeks? Hermione gave him some encouraging words before he started heading down to Snapes office after receiving a note stating that he was to meet with him at his office.
“Well you know this morning when you were like absent...” Draco pointed to his head to finish his sentence. It took Harry a moment to realise what exactly Draco was talking about.
Harry nodded, the only other family he had known was the Weasleys, and they were pretty much his cousins.
"Y…You haven't even let me say anything yet." Draco averted from Harrys shimmering green eyes, no he averted his eyes from his whole deathly handsome face as he knew that his own would be brighter than an apple fully ripe. Everything in him screamed for him to run, to run and never face this situation again, but he knew that for once he shouldn't, couldn't run. Harry admitted his feelings and it was time for Draco to do the same.
There was a Professor with long greasy hair and a large nose, Harry instantly identified him as Professor Snape who he had also heard about from Sirius and Remus. Snape went to school with Sirius and Remus, Sirius always had a scowl on his face whenever the mentioning of Snape popped up in conversation, Remus had to remind Harry that he had to show respect for Snape, after all he would be Harry’s Professor. Harry moved his eyes over to a weird looking man with a large turban wrapped around his head. The Professor who he did not know seemed to feel eyes on him and looked to Harry, Harry instantly felt pain flare up in the spot where his scar was, he looked away and hissed.
Harry watched Hermione now, she was a bit rocky and clutching the broom far too tightly, but Harry could tell that she was slowly gaining confidence. Draco and most of the Slytherins kicked off smoothly as he and Ron had, the rest of the Gryffindor class were a bit shaky but other than that they were confident, Neville was still on the ground trying to get his broom to rise. Harry sighed and decided he would try to help. He got off his broom and went to Neville.
Hermione looked to him now, a panicked look on her face. “Oh, Harry I didn’t mean to offend you, I just mean you have to be pretty brave keeping that calm look on your face all this time.” Hermione seemed to be careful with her words, Harry relaxed a little, he knew she didn’t mean any harm.
“Your brothers seemed kinda mean.” Hermione said, walking alongside Harry. Harry cringed internally; Ron always got touchy with people if they said anything bad about his siblings.
With a few waves of her wand Harry groaned as he felt his nose move back into his place and then he sniffed, it felt good as new.
“Yeah I felt like going for a walk and I guess my feet just took me here.” Harry shrugged, he still felt spacey. Which was weird for him, for he was always so alert whenever he was with Draco.
Once all the Gryffindor first years had arrived at the hall, Professor McGonagall swept through and handed out their timetables. They all looked down excitedly to their timetables, their first classes for the today would realistically determine the mood for the first day.
Harry could confess that he was starting to have a crush on Draco and that he found him sexually attractive. Draco could take this three ways. One, he could reject Harry and pretend that nothing ever happened. Two, he could reject Harry and not want to be friends with him anymore. Three, he could accept Harry and then they have a hot make out session that could turn into much more. Harry shook his head, it was not the right time to have some sexy day-dreams of Draco right now.
“And what do we have here Mr Potter?” The voice said. Harry cringed, for he had heard this voice before and knew exactly who it was.
I slid the almost cold bacon onto Dracos plate and plopped the scrambled eggs on his toast. "Ron convinced me to take the week off, and I thought it would be good for us." I tried to keep the pink tint away from my cheeks. Draco still looked at me perplexed. "You took the week off…" He murmured, he shook his head and pinched his arm.
“You’re just some Slytherin to me.” Ron snapped out, Harry took a step forward and placed his hand on his shoulder.
“See not so hard is it Neville!” Harry smiled proudly; he gave Neville a congratulatory pat on the back before going back to his spot where he continued to hover. Neville was extremely shaky hovering, but at least he was on a broom now.
A voice in his head said just go for it, Harry smirked, yeah why not just go over and say hi to Malfoy?
“Alright enjoy.” He handed the book to Harry and went back to the kitchen grabbing the cup of water.
“Wait so if you weren’t sure if you wanted to be friends with me then why did you try becoming my friend on the train?”
Harry took a deep breath and entered his house, leaving the groceries behind on his front door step. He held his wand tight in his hand, his knuckles turning white for how strong his grip had become. The house silent as he slowly entered, the creaking of his footsteps the only noise echoing around the house. Harry slowly stepped into the living room and the lights flickered on, Harry with his wand at the ready went to shout Expelliarmus, however quickly stopped when cheers spread throughout the room. "Congratulations Harry!" Someone popped a party cannon and confetti flew around Harry. Harry let go of the breath he didn't know he was holding and broke down into a laugh. "I really hate you guys!" He yelled as Ron and Hermione rushed towards him with presents in arm.
Harry doesn't know what to say, and he doesn't know whether or not to take offence, however she is right. Emotions are something that he is not good at.
"Don't be silly Harry." McGonagall waved her hand to object his concerns. "You must be famished come let's go." She stood up and made her way out of the office, Harry followed behind her his heart pounding in his chest. Harry could fight deatheaters, Harry could stop dark magic, however Harry could not help but be frightened by sitting in front of hundreds of students
"Don't you think?!" I wanted to yell, however my voice came out as a mumble from under all those clothes. We walked to the cash register and I dumped the clothes onto the desk. The witch at the register rose her eyebrows at us.
“I don’t really understand so I’m not going to say I understand you, but I’m here and I’ll always listen and try to understand.” Harry said giving Draco a tentative smile.
“Wow.” Harry said lost for words. The kitchen smelt amazingly like Remus’s home cooking and the lighting cast a warm soft glow on everything.
“You don’t have to be sorry.” Harry rushed, trying to think of the right words to say to Draco. However, he honestly couldn’t think of the right thing to say.
"Like what you see?" He smirked. I put my plate into the sink and headed towards him, once I reached him I wrapped my arms around his waist and pressed him against me.
“Er alright.” Ron said, a small blush splotched his cheeks and Harry instantly knew what spell Ron was about to attempt. Harry wanted to giggle at Ron, but to save his mates ego he kept it in.
Harry remembered exactly why he wouldn’t wake up and he immediately felt a heat rise up his neck. “Oh umm well thanks for waking me up.” Harry stood up from the chair and cleared his throat, feeling somewhat awkward. He didn’t want to wake up this way with Draco, he wanted to wake up before Draco and see that soft expression of his on his face.
Remus looked away from Sirius and rubbed the tears from his eyes. He spotted the body of Lilly still lying on the floor, her face frozen in the expression of one of determination yet utter desperation to save her son.
And yeah that's all I've got, I've pretty much lost all motivation for this fanfic, I don't particularly like it anymore, but I felt for those few who are reading it, might want a little more finality with the kiss scene. Who knows I might decided to pick up this fic again, but right now I have no idea how to continue Draco and Harrys relationship nor how to finish it. I ended it with the student line so that you guys can come up with your own how Draco and Harry will continue their relationship as colleagues and working in the castle, and how they develop their relationship in the future. But thankyou all for those who have read this and I'm so sorry that I've lost all motivation for this but I just cant really continue to write it. If you really enjoy my writing I have two more fanfics completed if you would like to read those
"Harry!?" Draco exclaimed, Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, "Yeah I was hoping we could talk."
“Welcome First Years, I am Madam Hooch, I am the riding instructor here at this school and you all will listen to every word I say, is that understood?”
Draco finished his first plate at around the same time that Harry finished his second. He took the dishes to the sink but Harry stopped him before he could start washing up. “Please let me at least clean up, you did all the cooking after all.” Draco wanted to protest but he couldn’t ignore the puppy eyes that Harry did so well. “Fine.” He huffed and sat down on one of the arm chairs that occupied the fireplace.
Draco face deepened in colour and he sheepishly looked away. "Thankyou." He whispered. My face instantly lit up with a smile. "Always." I pecked him on the lips and stood away.
Harry awoke with screaming echoing through the dorm. Harry shot up and looked around widely to where the danger was coming from, but everyone was looking at him with the same expression.
The two boys walked back to the dorms just chatting about their day. Neville Harry had learned was quite good company to have, but he was a quite a bit forgetful and timid, he wasn’t really sure how he had been sorted into Gryffindor, but he knew that the hat was never wrong.
“I would’ve thought so too, I was so nervous.” Harry laughed. Draco continued walking with Harry until they got to the stairs of Gryffindor Tower.
Everyone clapped and applauded when Hermione and Ron finished their vows with a kiss. Draco took Harrys hand and squeezed it, the smile on his face had not left since they arrived. The now married couple walked down the aisle hand in hand, Ron looking back and beaming at them.
Harry finally made it to the entrance to the Headmistresses office, he quickly mumbled the password and shuffled his way down the winding staircase. The office almost looked identical to the times of Dumbledore, the portrait that held Dumbledore looked up from the book he was reading and his eyes twinkled in their usual manner as he smiled at him. Harrys heart raced, he smiled back at the portrait and made his way into the seat opposite from Headmistress McGonagall's desk. McGonagall finally made her way through into the office.
I take another deep breath, we need to talk about this I keep telling myself, I don't care the consequences, I don't care if puts a wall between us, I need to say how I feel, and he needs to know.
"Okay next stop the potions shop then we can go home." After a while I whispered Wingardium Leviosa and just let the bags hover behind us. Draco was choosy with his products and made sure he was getting the best for the price, after about half an hour of him still shopping for ingredients I wanted to go look in other stores, he agreed and let me leave, but not before giving me a warning about buying that broom, I promised I wouldn't and quickly left.
“Hey wait up.” Harry lightly jogged, Draco was walking extremely fast for somehow who typically liked to save face. Draco slowed down and turned to Harry a more relaxed expression to his face.
Draco opened his mouth to respond but Harry quickly stopped him, “no don’t say anything it’s okay, i think you should think about it more.”
The sound of Kreacher banging around in the kitchen awoke Harry from his sleep. Today was one of his beloved days off and today he would be visiting Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for one of the first times since the end of the war. He mumbled words that he too did not understand and sauntered out of bed. The breakfast that Kreacher assembled was a bland one, however Harrys stomach was rumbling so loudly that he made no objections. He galloped through his breakfast and accioed his wand to him. Harry over the years working with the Aurors had quickly learnt the art of wandless and wordless magic. Many still became astounded at how he managed to do so much magic without a wand. Harry himself did not know how, he never really practiced it much it just came to him like riding a broom did.
“Harry whats up with you today?” Ron asked, a slight tone of worry to his voice. Harry than realised that he hadn’t told Ron or Hermione the big noise.
Professor McGonagall quickly clipped by with the large scroll still in her hands. Quickly she started to read off names, Harry watched as the students placed the hat on their heads and the hat bellowed out house names. Hermione Granger sat with slight trepidation, and the hat only took a moment to sort her into Gryffindor, Harrys heart fluttered lightly at hearing her being sorted into Gryffindor, he hoped even more that he would be sorted there too.
Harry enclosed the letter into an envelope and placed it in Blues cage for her to take when she gets back from her hunt, she would know where to take it.
"Hi Harry." Draco smiled, not a smidge of annoyance or malice evident in those clear grey eyes. Sometime over their letters they had started to call each other by their first names, agreeing that it would nicer to do so. Harry still couldn't quite grasp how three sixty Draco had become. His personality was nothing like it was when they were children bickering as they passed each other in the halls or in the great hall.
"Kreacher." He moaned, Harrys heart pounding against his chest. "Urgent call from Mr Weasley, he is waiting in the living room." Harry shot out of bed now alert and rushed to the living room, there was Ron's head flickering in the fire.
“Potter?!” Malfoy exclaimed, Harry removed his glasses and gently wiped the lens with the end of his robe.
Harry still couldn't believe it. He is now a professor at Hogwarts. Blue cooed again for his attention, Harry assumed she would want some food however another letter fell to the floor. Harry picked it up and instantly recognised the handwriting to be Malfoys.
Soon steps could be heard rushing towards them, Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape soon faced them with shocked expressions on their faces.
"That was a lot better than my imagination could ever come up with." Harry said, a small chuckle rolling off his lips.
Harry popped back from the corner, if he could somehow manage to not be seen by the troll he could quickly pop into the girls bathroom that lay just before him, but he would have to hurry, the troll was quickly coming up to his not so good hiding spot.
I turn around and put my hand onto his cheek, he closes his eyes and presses his hand against mine. "We still have a lot of talking to do."
“Oh, there you two are! Where did you boys go wandering off two? Lunch is almost finished.” Hermione crossed her arms like a mother chastising their child.
Draco this time turned to him, and Harry couldn’t stop looking into those captivating grey eyes. “What do you mean by that Harry?”
“So how was it?” Draco said half scaring Harry to death. Harry nearly fell over at the sight of Draco appearing out of thin air, he had to take a moment to catch his breathe before he could say anything.
"Checkmate!" Ron shouted, a proud smile on his face. Harry slouched back into his chair. "I don't know why I keep playing with you I'm not getting any better at this stupid game." He groaned. He lifted his arms in the air and took a long stretch. Draco took this time to admire the taught biceps and the large hands that he so desperately wanted to hold.
“I, I’m sure I can organise something.” The Professor nodded, Harry and Ron both looked at each again, feeling even more confused than before. But they went back to reading, Harry and Hermione quietly discussed what they had read once more whilst Ron finished reading the chapter.
"Draco I'm surprised that you want kids." I looked to him almost sharply but mostly in puzzlement, "and what do you mean by that?"
“Remus you’re better!” Harry rushed over to Remus and crushed him into a hug. Remus winced a little, his ribs still a bit tender. Harry noticed this and instantly let go.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded. He didn’t really know how to talk to girls, and Hermione especially. There was Ginny at the Weasleys, but she was always too nervous around him so he could never hold a proper conversation with her.
Draco waited with his wand in his hand, hearing footsteps pass his door he quickly murmured, “point me to Harry Potter.”
"Draco our love is the strongest magic, of course it will work." I searched his gray eyes, and they soon lightened with relief and his shoulders relaxed, he let a small smile show through.
“I’m not ashamed by it!” Harry defends himself. Because it’s true, he really isn’t ashamed of his feelings for Draco he’s more ashamed that he couldn’t keep his feelings under wraps.
Harry packed the trunk that would carry his belongings for the year, Harrys heart raced as he checked the time, he wanted to arrive early and pop in to say hi to Hagrid before he was introduced to the school. Harry decided that now would be a good time to leave and he popped he shrunk his trunk down to a size where it would be able to fit into the pocket of his robes. Harry made sure that he had everything before he left, said his farewell to Kreacher and disapparated to Hogsmeade. Harry took in some quick sharp breathes before making his way up to Hogwarts. The air crisp at this time of year, Harrys breathe condensates as he breathed out. Harry finally makes it to the entrance into the castle and takes one last deep breathe before making his way into the castle. McGonagall is waiting for him at the entrance.
Harry quickly went back to his room, which wasn’t far from Draco’s. He poked the watch that his portrait guardian wore, the guardian a sixteenth century nobleman, who was currently clothed in clothing far too tight and far too bright. The sleeping nobleman jerked awake at being touched and sent the most offending glare that he could towards Harry. Harry paid no attention and stepped into this room. The room was something that did not particularly stand out, simple and decorated with the bare minimum. The arm chairs that occupied the fireplace and the small kitchen enough to boil a kettle. The bathroom had the necessities, a shower and a bath. Harry hoped it would be nothing like the prefect’s bath.
Draco chuckled to himself thinking about the childish things he did to receive Harry's attention. His obsession he'd had on Harry since he could remember had not faded at all but had only grown stronger. However, the thoughts of all the wrong he had caused weighed him down and drowned his hopes of ever being with Harry, let alone to share how he felt for him!
It took a long time for Harry to gather the will to adopt another owl, after Hedwig he didn't think he could go through the pain of getting another and losing it again. However, on a mission in South America he came across Blue's small and fragile body fallen from his nest high above in the canopies. Harry quickly took him to a someone who would know how to take care of him and ever since then Blue became his. Harry wasn't sure if he could use Blue as an owl to do deliveries for him as he never really trained Blue how to, however Blue somehow knew, just like Hedwig did.
“Okay class now mount your broom and after I give the command you are to kick off the ground, I only want there to be hovering, no going up past two metres!” She blew her whistle and everyone mounted their brooms.
“Oh, I’m excited for charms!” Hermione spoke, she was finished with her breakfast and standing up dusting off her robes.
Draco cocked his head to the side, and Harry was immediately reminded of a puppy, however Draco’s face didn’t really hold that adorableness of a puppy, it was too pointy.
“Harry..” Minerva sighs. “I have known you since you were eleven, I have seen you grow into a fine man that you are now, but emotions well they are something that you are not good at.”
“I’ll be back in a minute I guess.” Harry gave them a reassuring smile before following the direction that Draco had already started walking away in.
“Okay so how about this, just imagine something else that you like doing when you call for the broom, try not to think about it too much.”
“Blimey I wouldn’t know I was too terrified looking at the massive three heads!” Ron cried out; face still red but he seemed to have his breathe under control now.
I set to cleaning the dishes and filling the sink with water. After the war I was allowed to finish school then put straight on trial, with the help of Harry I managed only to come away with a 3-year probation. However, the probation had taught me how to live without magic, how to simply be a human being.
"I can't we're so close to cracking this case right open, the trail is getting hotter by the second, I can't just take a week off and lose all the progress that we have made."
Draco chuckled softly, too quietly for Harry to hear and ate his own in a more graceful manner. Harry was the first to finish and eyed the leftovers eagerly, however Draco knew he was holding back to be polite. “Feel free to have more, I don’t really have a fridge to store the leftovers.” Harry blushed lightly and plated himself some more pie. Draco watched on proudly, he felt like a mother that had finally gotten her fussy child to eat something other than packet noodles and candy.
“Oi wait up, we don’t need our books we’ve got Herbology first up don’t we?” Ron said, feeling slightly output.
Draco lead Harry into a corridor that was covered with paintings of fruit, Harry found this weird as he had yet to see paintings in the corridors that weren’t of people. Draco ushered Harry over to a painting that had a pear in a bowl sitting directly in the middle of the painting. Draco put his finger over the pear and rubbed it, Harry watched curiously wondering what this would do. Then the pear giggled and Draco quickly took a step back pushing Harry along with him, the painting swung open and there was a small entrance.
The boys did not go without punishment, eventually they were caught whilst trying to sneak back to class. Harry and Draco had split off at this point, with Harry heading towards the Transfiguration classroom and Draco to Charms. Harry when about to round the corner to his classroom was stopped by a droning deep voice.
“It was alright, I had mother send me my silk sheets from home, I am not going to below myself by sleeping on those cotton abominations.” Draco sniffed, carefully plopping a spoon of cereal into his mouth.
The password he knows and the entrance opens. Going down through the spiral stairs Harry’s mind races trying to come up with excuses for his behaviour. However his mind is completely blank, Harry curses himself under his breath. He knocks on the door and Minerva welcomes him in.
Harry and Ron tried to go as fast as they could, slowing down their paces slightly as they were passed by their peers. They once passed Professor Snape who had a horrid look on his face, but he just glared at the boys as they bobbed their heads down, luckily he made no comment.
“Uh Mr Potter finally decided to show up for class, did we?” McGonagall spoke, stopping her talking and the whole class turned to him. He walked up to Professor McGonagall and murmured, “Professor Snape will see you after your class.”
“Okay class as I was saying, today we are just going to do some theory work for the levitating charm, then next lesson we can begin to do some practicing. Does anyone know what Latin is used for the levitating charm?” Professor Flitwick surveyed the room and smiled at Hermione who was the only one that had her hand up.
Harry turned off the shower and stepped out of the shower, dragging a towel around his waist and grabbing another to dry off his hair. Today he didn't feel like going to work, he went to the kitchen and quickly scribbled out a letter to excuse himself from work. Blue was not in his cage, Harry assumed he would be delivering the letter he had written last night to Malfoy. Harry sighed for what felt like the tenth time that morning and it wasn't even ten o'clock yet. Kreacher popped in the kitchen and brought Harry a plate of tea and biscuits. "Master Potter needs to get food." He grumbled. Harry nodded his head and dunked the biscuits into the tea to get rid of the stale texture. Kreacher tried to do the least amount of work that he could get away with around the house, and something that he never did was shop for the house, leaving the shopping up to Harry. Harry finished the biscuits and the tea then put on his usual muggle attire, a pair of washed blue jeans and a simple t-shirt, today's weather was nice enough that he wouldn't be needing a jacket to fend off the cold. Harry grabbed his wallet which contained enough muggle money to do a week's worth of shopping.
The trio wandered around for a little longer, Harry interested in ever nook and cranny hoping to find some sort of secret passage or room. Eventually Hermione started to get anxious, constantly looking down to her clock and sending the boys looks of minor panic and exasperation.
I finished dunking the tea bag from the pot and took the trayful of tea cups and the teapot out into the living room. Hermione and Ron sat thigh to thigh, their youngest Hugo barely a year old sitting on his fathers lap and a three-year-old rose sitting next to her mother patiently.
Harry had never heard Ron call Hermione that before, but he joined in the conversation. “Yeah Hermione, you’ll be fine, it not as scary as you think it is.”
I slowly disconnected our lips to rest my forehead on his. Our breathes dancing together with harmony. Harrys eyes fluttered open and my breathe caught in my throat. He was so beautiful, this man before me, he still made me astonished that he was mine
Harry looked more closely at Draco, and suddenly realised that he looked really good, healthier. The shadows underneath his eyes had all but disappeared, weariness lines had become less defined and his eyes seemed brighter than they usually did.
“Harry why don’t you come with me, I would like for you to meet someone.” McGonagall did not have a smile on her face, but it was bright with anticipation, which meant that he probably didn’t forget to hand in his homework.
As Harry walked behind McGonagall into the great hall all chatter slowly died down and curious eyes plastered to him. Harry kept his head low, he sat down into an empty seat next to a Professor that he did not know. The professor with a bright smile extended out her hand and smiled, "I'm the transfiguration teacher Professor Greer, but you can call me Myra." Harry smiled back at her and shook her hand. McGonagall stood and called the attention of the students, she made a few small announcements and then commenced lunch. The food quickly appeared, Harrys stomach growled and he quickly but politely dug into the array of food that was may more appetising than the usual dinners that Kreacher presented. Harry leaned over slightly to see the other Professors. Flitwick still present, Professor Sprout and beside her Neville Longbottom, Harry momentarily surprised but then remembered that he had been training under her eye for this year preparing him to replace her at the end of year. Harry's eyes continued to wonder through the teachers until they landed on someone that he had not expected them to land on.
Harry was not that surprised by the news, it was difficult to explain to Harry the new dynamic to the relationship, but Harry just shrugged and had said in his little toddler voice.
Sirius turned around with a slightly burnt plate of eggs and bacon and placed them in front of Harry, sticking his tongue out to tease him.
Remus smiled, of course to a child it sounded like a simple and tiring job, and he wasn’t one that was going to refute it.
"Yes, dear I placed it out for you so you could find it easier." He sneered, before turning and strutting out of the room. Then mumbled to Sirius, a black and white cat they adopted when they moved in together two years ago. "Seriously he's blind, do we have to get his eyes checked again, three years I have had to deal with this!" Sirius only winked in reply.
Harry felt a slight pang of pain go through his chest. “I uh do, aren’t we?” Harry asked, he could feel the slight blush of embarrassment crawl up his neck.
