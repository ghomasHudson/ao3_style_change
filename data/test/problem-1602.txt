Sirius shut the black door and bolted it, leaving the lasting image of Harry and Arthur walking away in his mind.
"Was he right, then?"
" He hissed under his breath.
“Well things change, don’t they?” Harry snapped back over his shoulder. “That was before I almost died -
"And if you guys could pull these off, they'd be an absolute
"Two."
And on cue, the dog morphed in to a tall man with long black hair and enough tattoos to send his mother in to a fit. So this was his cousin, Sirius Black.
"Hey, was it you who laughed at my joke during Potions?" Harry asked, now feeling daring and confident speaking to the other boy. He saw Malfoy flush and look away, and Harry knew the answer.
Harry glanced at Draco, who seemed more perplexed than scared. Mrs. Weasley and Tonks came bounding up the stairs, darting forward to try to tug the curtains shut over the old woman. As Tonks failed to draw them over the woman, Mrs. Weasley made haste by stunning all the other portraits. A few seconds later, just as the woman begun another tirade, Sirius came charging up the stairs.
"It's quite alright, Harry." She said calmly, retracting her arm gently. "I can understand how it might have been frustrating for you."
"Oh, thank Merlin." Molly blew out a relieved exhale.
." Ronald said pointedly, although he didn't look angry. "What on earth's going on with you today?"
"Oh, I remember that!" Draco gasped with a smile, "It was a boy in the year above. Usually someone comes running in from the Common Room to warn us that Snape was doing his rounds, but the kid was in the shower at the time so he came back and started changing just as Snape walked in!"
Ron huffed, but agreed anyway. “Fine.”
"Unforgiven."
A flicker of something passed over Malfoy's face and Harry feared he had screwed everything up. Luckily, the boy's face softened.
Without thinking, Draco stood. Blaise next to him grabbed his arm.
-o-o-
"Harry." Ron said seriously, "You two actually did it? Hands together, bonder and everything?"
“Did you see how she looked at you? Like she was going to eat you right up!” Pansy exclaimed in a harsh whisper. “I can’t believe her!”
“I’m sorry,” she spoke in a monotone, nasally voice, “we don’t take walk-ins for submissions-”
"Shut up, Blaise! I'll hex you!"
"Haven't been able to walk more than five meters since." Ron said exasperatedly behind the twins.
"Boys!" Harry heard Molly's voice call as Harry bounded up the steps to catch up to Draco. "Not too loud or you'll wake up-"
" He said proudly. That's what broke Malfoy a second time, a small laugh escaping his lips. He stopped laughing almost immediately, and glared at Harry.
Malfoy shrugged and said, "You're really not, but…I can't really tell anyone else. People in Slytherin are…"
” Ron retorted. “The wounds are deep. They’ll
"All will be well, Draco." Dumbledore said, but Draco wasn't convinced. "This is just to sate the beast's appetite for the time being."
"'S okay." Harry muttered soothingly, although he didn't know if it was Buckbeak or for him. He felt the vibrations of the beast beneath his hand as it began to purr.
" Snape had to be involved. He was a Death Eater. He had to know if something was about to happen. "Where is Harry?" Draco gripped his wand behind his back.
"It's nice." Harry said softly. And it was.
The door knocker sounded. Walburga's painting gurgled something indiscernible. It was probably Harry!
"You will all be competing for the title as Triwizard Champion through a series of obstacles and tests placed around this labyrinth! The first to navigate and find the cup will be crowned! On you marks, gentlemen…"
It was just him watching people around the room. It felt nice to blend in to the aura of being around so many people. Where they'd all just look over him if he stayed still enough, quiet enough. It made him feel small. Not necessarily inadequate. A good small. Like he didn't have to worry. Why was he at a Ball, anyway? He couldn't recall. He didn't like Balls. Hadn't so since he was forced to attend them as a child. They were boring, and the company was always horrible. Some bland pureblooded child or the other, demanding to see his things and see if they had something better. He was confused. He didn't understand anything at the moment.
"Oh fuck
Harry smiled weakly, not looking at Draco and getting to his feet.
"Oh, no Professor, I'm with Potter." He said sweetly sidling up to him. Harry stiffened because he really did not want Malfoy anywhere near at the moment.
Pulling on his uniform so he wouldn't have to come back and change, he crept out past his sleeping dorm mates with his bag slung over his shoulder. He left through the Common Room, where he was pretty sure he spooked three different house elves whom were dusting the furniture inside on the way out. One of them looked vaguely familiar somehow, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. It didn't matter though, because the elf disapparated with a yelp as soon as it saw Draco. Weird creatures, they were.
"I just got here, Harry." Draco smiled slightly at the befuddled boy, never having seen Harry like this before.
"Why not the Weasleys?" Draco couldn't believe he would be vouching for them to the Headmaster in his lifetime. "I'm sure they can protect him."
when he got back from Hogsmeade and saw Draco laying down in their spot. He didn't know the boy would be bloody Sherlock Holmes when it came to deception. Not that Harry was any good at hiding his emotions.
"Well I think it's a good change, Harry. You both put away your differences very maturely." She said.
They were standing in front of the front door, Draco set to leave later to go back to the manor. Harry was still unconscious in his room upstairs, and unfortunately Snape had some business to take care of the next day, so they had to leave earlier than expected.
Harry enters and usual shitty Umbridge tactics ensue. She gives him the quill and makes him do lines with it.
And they continued to dance.
"He was insistent on the Vow so that he wouldn't." Harry confirmed. "He's deathly scared of his father, I can tell. Said he'd rather be dead than be like what he is. I don't think he still knows how to trust himself around him."
"It's great, Ronald. Harry's too unstable to be in a position of power, anyways." Draco said dully, and Harry scowled at him.
"And you agreed to…talk?" Blaise asked in confirmation. Draco sighed and kneaded his forehead as if he had a headache. Unfortunately it was just Blaise's presence.
Draco froze, "Erm, no I don't think you're..." He said slowly. "I'm sure it's nothing…"
"Granted, I'm no less than surprised. But you can't really help it, can you? It's not your fault. You shouldn't be in this Tournament in the first place." He said noncommittally, as if he were talking about the weather. Harry thought about the words for a bit.
“Look!” Draco hissed sharply, keeping his volume minimal. “Now everyone’s leaving! And you’re hurting me because I’m
On one particularly warm day, Draco had been laying under the tree while everyone else had gone to Hogsmeade and was watching the leaves, now brilliantly green, sway above him through filtered sunlight. He raised up a hand above him and stared at his palm, thinking about nothing at all and letting himself settle in to a hazy state between wakefulness and sleep.
"What colour is yours, Hermione?" Ron asked, dipping his quill in to an inkwell rapidly as he speed-wrote.
“Excited to pummel you into the ground.” Draco crossed his arms.
The wand moved. His heart skipped a beat.
He cleared his throat, readjusting himself on his seat. Pansy was to his side, talking to another one of the children by the window of the train. “Well, if you want to be in Slytherin, you will be, won’t you?”
, I went to the ball with Harry Potter.
"Yes, Sir." Harry and Draco said quietly.
"I'd like an explanation, please." Draco crossed his arms, his eyebrows pinched.
“Oh, because you’re...you!” Hermione snapped. “Harry knows what i’m talking about, right Harry? At the end-of-term feast last year...”
"I thought you weren't going with anyone." Draco was confused. So Potter had a date? "You didn't say anything when I asked."
if some parts sound familiar, that's because i siphoned them off the sacred texts (the ootp)
Draco stayed silent, slightly taken aback by the statement but wanting the boy to continue.
“He’s fine.”
As if looking to see if anyone was around.
“Hey.” Dean’s voice said behind him, and Seamus said nothing, seemingly absorbed in his posters. “All good?”
"Where is Granger?" Draco interrupted coolly, looking casually past Ronald to the door, "Why don't you go annoy her."
Blaise nodded, still gazing out at the archives. “Low-class files. Things open to any member of the Ministry and any civilian with the proper permission.”
"Don't be an oaf." Draco said sitting down next to Potter. The boy said nothing, throwing the poor apple between his hands absentmindedly. "Give me back my apple. You'll bruise it." He added, holding out his hand. Potter stared at the apple then looked at Draco irritably. He handed Draco the apple with a huff and sat back again in silence.
"Yes. Nothing is done at one-hundred percent, Potter. I'd say sixty-eight percent are good chances. Nothing can be done without risk, you should know that."
"Oh god. What will my friends say?" Harry realised with horror. He touched his head as if it might get up and walk away.
“Maybe they suspect him.” Harry countered. “They would have reason to.”
He wondered where Harry's muggle relatives were. Draco almost hexed himself right there for not bothering to ask after his arrangements.
"The diary possessed Ginny and she opened up the Chamber of Secrets."
“You haven’t given me any ink,” he said dully, trying his best to reign in any rudeness but probably failing.
"I feel like," Draco murmured to him on the way down the stairs, "I'm a very nice piece of meat amongst a pack of hungry wolves."
A roaring flame of indignation raged inside of him. Without thinking further, he pushed himself off his chair, making it screech loudly in the quieted Library. A few feet away, Madam Pince shot them a sharp, warning glare.
Blaise pondered it for a moment, turning his eyes to the fire. He let out a short, contemplative hum before looking back to Draco with a small smile.
"Harry." Draco said warningly. Harry's head bowed and Draco heard him sigh.
Draco folded up the note quickly, letting go of it and pressing the bridge of his nose with a sigh. A dream about You-know-who? It was safe to assume they weren't even dreams anymore. What was he planning? Using Wormtail as a servant, but he failed to do something. A 'blunder' as the voice had called it…
But until then, he could sleep and hopefully forget about it all. Even for a little while. He had a few fleeting thoughts of Harry of all things as he lay staring at his ceiling, and he wondered where the boy was. Nobody knew his muggle relative's address, so he couldn't even send him an owl if he wanted to. He felt a twinge of sadness at the fact that Harry may be surrounded by people who didn't understand what he'd been through that year. What's worse was, Harry gave the impression that his relatives didn't even like him. If that was the case, then either nobody really knew about it or he was being forced to return to that house every summer regardless of his situation.
It wasn't before a tall, dark-skinned boy walked in whistling and caught him with tears on his face did he manage to compose himself. He didn't look quite as phased as he should have been to see someone like Draco crying to themselves in the bathroom, but since he was also starting Hogwarts that day and needed to make a good impression, he offered Draco his friendship in that very bathroom (Draco willingly accepted despite the tear stains on his face that he'd desperately tried to wipe away moments before). Draco never really revealed why he had been crying in the bathroom to the boy, whom introduced himself as Blaise Zabini, but was pretty sure Blaise had figured it out eventually to his own amusement.
"I'm here!" Harry shouted, rousing the attention of McGonagall and Dumbledore.
“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?” asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.
"And the next task?" Draco asked, having wondered about it since the last one ended. Harry shrugged vaguely, as if he wasn't almost going in to shock from the idea of the last task.
"But what if I-"
“Me mam almost didn’t let me come back.” He turned back around to fold some clothes.
Draco woke up the next morning to Blaise sitting patiently at the end of his bed, smirking like the bloody idiot he was. When he saw Draco had awoken, his mouth curled from a smirk in to a full out malicious grin.
“Yeah.” said Draco. “Maybe she’s especially annoyed with him or something.”
"Well, not exactly. Can you promise you'll let me explain?" He asked intently. Draco almost refused and demanded to know what the fuck was going on, but his curiosity overruled him. He nodded slowly, half-expecting Black to just pop up out of a bush somewhere.
"I could've done
“I’ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar.”
Draco nodded matter-of-factly, "He works there, or throws Gold at them time to time. I always mix it up. Think it’s the same thing."
"You mean not at all." Harry sighed.  "Right. So you're proposing a series of complex magic, one that has the possibility of
On the back of his hand, briefly, was the same ruby red that the ink was coloured. It was quickly silvering over as the indents in his skin healed before his eyes, carving out the very words he wrote on the parchment into his flesh before fading back into nothing.
“To us, however, to the Order, you can predict how that may be troubling.”
"Blast!" Uncle Vernon yelped, his body coiling away. Harry took this opportunity to shove past Vernon, grab his things and head towards the door. He unlocked it wandlessly, and stepped in to the cool night air. He heard his Uncle bellowing behind him, but there was no move made to follow him from anyone in the house.
The rest of the day’s subjects went relatively uneventful from then on (despite his stomach deciding to rumble at the most impromptu moments in class). The teachers were in haste to finish off the syllabi before exams in a few months, but the familiar comforts of napping in Arithmancy and watching Harry mess up in Potions to the point where Snape had to vanish it away were what kept him grounded (although Harry
"Professor Dumbledore." Draco said again, voice sharp but still slightly shaky, "You need to call off the task. Something's about to go wrong."
Potter's words ran through his head for a moment. They seemed to make sense, especially when he felt so at ease out there than anywhere else in the school. Who knew it was also with the only person in school that hated him the most?
"Previous owner of this house." He said grimly.
1823… By Merlin… What kind of things might he find in Level Two if it’s been there that long…
Umbridge turned to Draco again, the same creepy smile reappearing. “Well, I just wanted to take a little peak at the future leaders of Slytherin. I schooled as one myself, if you should know.” The sentence was punctuated by a high-pitched giggle that gave him an unnerving amount of goosebumps on his arms.
"I know it was, Potter! Does your school know you're using that vile thing?" He glared at the wand in Harry's wand and back at him.
"Is shouting helpful? Is any of this helpful, at the moment? It was between Harry and I. End of story."
Harry caught the hand Draco had used to tap him with, holding it and stopping them from walking further. Draco turned to him, eyebrows raised as Harry opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out.
"Rethink what?" Harry asked insistently, hands tightening in to fists in his lap. "What's happening, Professor?"
-o-o-
"What-" And turned back around to see Draco walking to where Harry was sitting, wand drawn.
"Do you want some of mine?" Draco pushed the plate towards Harry a bit, and the boy paused, staring at it. "I just…It's way too much."
"Ah, Draco." Snape drawled as he looked up. "Sit down." He said, gesturing to one of the stools on the table he was working at. He got closer and sat down, seeing a deep green mixture in the cauldron that had metallic undertones.
"Oh, too long for me to admit." Remus said with a full smile. "Since our school days, if you can imagine that far."
haha hey :)
She placed a few eggs in front of him along with some flour and some weird spoon objects. "Measure these out and put them in the bowl." She said promptly, then pointed to a parchment with some measurements. "Add the dry ingredients first, then the eggs."
"I'll see you tomorrow." Harry said when they reached the entrance where they had to part ways.
"It doesn't matter." Harry bit out, glancing at Draco across the Hall whom was engrossed in a book and laying in to a croissant even Harry could tell was over-buttered.
"Just spill it, Potter." Draco said sternly. He wondered what could have possible happened to make Harry so nervous, especially since it seemed to do partially with
"Ron!" Hermione called out, and the boy's head immediately shot up to face her, "Come over here."
Draco was busy rustling through his overnight bag, thoughts swirling after the events of the meeting and what had happened afterwards with Harry and his friends, when he felt a presence behind him at the open door. His first instinct would have been to assume it was Harry, but the tingling in his neck and difference in sound on the floorboards had him turning around quickly.
"I'm not sure." Harry said honestly, "I have a head start along with Cedric, but everyone there's tough competition, you know? And they're older than me."
"I gave them my Triwizard winnings last year." Harry said, picking up fallen Doxies off the ground and putting them in to the bag.
“About Mr Potter... How is he?”
be warned! umbitch is heavy in the next chapter. god i hate that woman.
Dumbledore pondered the question for a moment, the Phoenix beside him wilting away steadily.
. Sure, he'd been tortured by a Death Eater, almost killed and now on constant threat of his life as he willingly agrees to betray one very powerful Dark Wizard, but he'd never felt more like himself. Neither his parents were quite so adventurous, but Draco found a thrill in the danger and chase of things that he realised was individual to himself, and he wouldn't change a thing. The pain in his chest was barely there, and every day he tried to quell the shame of his past actions and mend his beliefs. It was a constant task of reminding himself that his first impressions of others on terms of blood were taught by his father, and were in no way his own individual beliefs. It wasn't easy, especially as much as he slipped up internally around himself and had to sit down and think things over, but he was a smart person. If he could learn complex arithmancy formulas, he could recondition his way of thinking
"And outside of this group, no one will know about this Vow." Remus said to everyone, tone grave. "You haven't told the Order, right?'
"You've changed, Draco." She said, never breaking eye-contact. He stilled again, trying to quell his breathing which had become heavy leading up to that point.
"Better not then." Draco said, smiling wryly at the other boy. A comfortable silence settled between them, but discomfort was still nudging the back of his head. He cleared his throat then asked tentatively, "How are you?"
Then he ran in to none other than Malfoy in the Hall. The exchange was weird, and extremely docile compared to the ones in their past. Harry was too busy catching his breath at the time, but he could have sworn he saw Malfoy start to blush before he was dragged away. At least he wasn't the only one who found it bloody weird between them, but it was definitely easier to not waste energy on egging each other on that early in the day. Harry almost felt a sense of loss when Malfoy left without ever throwing him a sneer or insult.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right, then.” Umbridge checked a pink clock stuck on to the classroom wall, a cartoon kitten painted onto its face. “I’ll leave you to it. I do believe you have a class with me, today?”
The rest of the day was spent finishing off the homework he couldn’t get done during the week because of that letter, which is what brought him to the position he was in that night, sitting by the fire with Blaise, the two of them the sole occupants of the Slytherin Common Room.
"Come on! Count on your fingers right now!"
"Felt impressive. I feel way better." Harry stretched his arms up and laid back down. "Wish I could stay here all day."
," He shouted at the room full of adults, "You can expect none of my cooperation about anything important for a very long time!"
"I am." Remus nodded, smile going full wattage once again. "You do seem to be taking it quite well, however. Us both being…"
Soon, the feast began to come to a close and it was time for students to return to their dormitories for the evening.
Harry just stared at her, too tired and too numb to even feel anger. He should have expected such a response anyway. Was this what Draco had to deal with? This woman was levels above what he’d thought she was, even after all their previous encounters. She had a truly cruel, unforgiving aura that made Harry wonder if she really wasn’t in arms with Voldemort himself.
Harry glanced at Sirius, and the man nodded.
"Two hours and…" Malfoy checked his watch. "Forty-five minutes. It's impressive, really."
“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,” she said, smiling down at his hand with a look of such maternity that it took all of Harry’s self-control not to bolt out of the room. That was his
“Evening.” Blaise ventured without looking up from his book.
Walking back to the Hospital Wing underneath the cloak was one of the most deviously fun things Draco had done in a while, and he'd stolen Gillyweed from Snape's office a few months before.
After another awkward tea with his mother, Draco collapsed in to his room and it took all his willpower to drag himself for a bath before bed.
He continued to stir his cup of tea idly, ignoring her.
Finally settled in the Hospital Wing, Harry was too restless to sleep. Madam Pomfrey had given him some potions for the pain from the Cruciatus and healed the wound his arm, now a silver curved scar.
Like a frozen Lake with hundreds of thousands of fractures and fissures that would break through if he moved even an inch.
Must be that illicit oaf, Hagrid. The man would breed a Basilisk in his little hut if he had the chance.
Draco froze, but Blaise didn’t seem to notice.
"I…" He thought for a moment. "I don't know. But it doesn't matter if he does or not. He won't act like he used to."
House Elves. His name's Nutter, you say?"
. Draco had been on the receiving end of Blaise's verbal assaults
"Then you are no better than a mudblood." Moody declared. "You of all people will know what mudbloods are to us." Moody pointed his wand at Draco, Draco's own wand in his other hand. "Less than the dirt under our shoes."
"They were probably on to something when they wouldn't let the younger years participate.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know! I honestly didn't expect him to-"
"Why are you apologising?" Harry said finally.
Ron collapsed in to a fit of giggles, and Harry side-elbowed him but couldn't hold in the laugh of his own. At Draco's glare however, he quickly wiped off the grin on his face.
“The Ministry, or even as much as an ideal. It explains why she was drawn to politics and very much lives by the word of law.”
that he begun to wonder if someone had been polyjuicing as Draco for the last six months. Sometimes he woke up still thinking Draco was
"Plus, the biggest reason of all." Ron said, and everyone looked at him suspensefully. "Quidditch!"
"It was
He looked at her expectantly with an air of urgency that only made the woman scramble to think for herself harder.
"Well, it's like you said. No expectations, no reputations to uphold. You certainly don't give a shit about that stoicism bullshit, so why should I walk on eggshells?"
"Yes." He swallowed and looked down at his lap. "Second highest." He muttered.
"It's about Barty Crouch."
"Nothing makes me think that." Draco waved him off. "But what are they going to do? Kick me out? I know their Headquarters location
"Bad to admit that you're worried about him. Aren't you two friends?"
"And Ron." Harry sighed, letting go of his sleeve and Draco let go of his wrist. He brushed past Draco to the door, and Draco waved his wand to dispel the silencing charm over the room behind his back.
"Shit." Harry unveiled himself like a cloth of the horizon being torn off him. The Invisibility Cloak, Draco assumed. "I was going to wait and see how long you'd last." The boy said sadly.
Harry exhaled harshly, taking the toilet paper and using it to wipe his mouth. He grimaced as he realised the sour aftertaste in his mouth. “Just trust me, alright? I can handle it. I can’t show her she’s got to me.”
"There will be no need for that." A breezy voice announced. Albus Dumbledore was waltzing in, a definitive look at Draco having him lowering his wand. "Good morning, Professor." The old man twinkled. Snape barely held in a scowl as Dumbledore turned to regard Draco.
Draco nodded. "Okay then. Other than that, there was nothing else. Just tell me if you want to be involved in those meetings, and I'll make it happen."
." He heard her cry in to his shoulder. It confused him at first, before he realised she probably wasn't just talking about what had happened moments prior.
Draco blew out a huff, "Fine." He said. "Not like I have a choice."
"Enter." His father's voice sounded from behind. He exhaled quickly, then opened the door before he could scare himself out of it.
“Er, yeah. Why does it mat-” Blaise froze as well, his expression dropping. “No way.”
"I don't actually, but go on." Harry said obligingly, earning a glare from Draco.
before!”
"Stop resisting, ferret." Weasley's breath in his ear, strong arms coming around his shoulders from behind.
“Are you even listening?”
He was also a member of the Order, which was why Hermione explained Ronald’s theory (yes, their Ronald. Who would have thought?) that Podmore had been framed by the Ministry itself. Given Draco's current opinion of what the Ministry stood for, he wouldn’t have been shocked if that were the case, and reluctantly agreed with the theory.
Potter nodded, staring at the couple. Draco saw his an almost longing look in his eyes, but this time he was confused on who it was for.
"Oh, shut up, Potter! You're insufferably intolerable!" The voice was farther away now, and Harry saw the privacy screens around his bed lift up. "See you
"Enough about Potter for the moment!" She cried. "Everyone was bloody watching you two just now. They were
Ron snorted, "You're telling me." He said, glancing at Hermione. He looked at Harry pleadingly, "This doesn't mean that we all have to be…bummy with him do we? I don't think I can handle being friends with the ferret, Harry."
"It's
"There'll probably be obstacles. Things that might kill you, knowing Dumbledore." Draco said afterwards.
"Uh, nothing. You just remind me of Hermione." He said sheepishly. Draco stared at him for a moment blankly before shaking his head and continuing.
“Harry.” Ron exclaimed, out of breath as he slid down to Harry’s side. “We- The Keeper tryouts just finished and I saw
"Of course, Bill." And everyone left the room, leaving Draco with his teeth clenched and a shit ton of new problems to deal with.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry!" Ron erupted next to him. Malfoy's mouth hung agape as a retort failed to leave his mouth.
Harry glanced behind him, seeing Draco hanging back awkwardly. He made a motion to beckon him, but the boy shook his head, going to sit next to Bill at the other end of the table.
"Harry?" Hermione gasped, looking between him and Malfoy in shock.
"Er, yeah. It was him." Harry said, suddenly feeling self-conscious.
to the ball, are you?" He was sauntering up to the three of them in a dramatic billow of his Slytherin robes and a shit-eating grin on his face. Hermione opened her mouth to reply before Harry stepped in front of her with a scathing look.
"Don't I get a say in this?" Harry said angrily, silently fuming as he watched the exchange.
Next introduced was Cedric, and Harry craned his neck to see who he was going with. He spotted an eerily familiar length of jet black hair being led to the floor. Cedric spun the girl around and, to Harry's horror, Cho Chang turned to face him. Feeling as if his heart had been stopped, Harry took a shuddering breath and gasped, "
Potter watched him chew for a moment then looked away quickly, "I don't know."
This was it. It was finally over. All he had to do was get through this one last task, and the Triwizard Tournament would be nothing more than a memory.
"But Harry," Hermione said, "You really could have told us."
"Erm, no." Draco admitted.
"I had a go at him too, when we first spoke. You're not in the wrong for saying what you wanted to. Not after what he's done in the past."
It was then that Draco realised Potter hadn't been at dinner and he was there currently holding a multitude of croissants to his chest like a child. He sighed and knew he had no choice, wondering when on earth the planets had aligned so Draco would end up sharing food with Harry Potter. The planets were cruel, fickle beings.
The next week passed in a flurry within Hogwarts, with Umbridge being announced as the school’s new ‘High Inquisitor’ by the Ministry.
"It's not like…like that…" Theo mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck.
“...Draco?” Blaise’s voice popped back into reality.
Malfoy looked at him quickly with a hint of worry. "What is it?" He asked. Harry smiled a bit, immediately spelling the worry from the boy's eyes.
"Exactly!" Fred exclaimed. "We always told each other how much there was more that could have been done in the market that Zonko's never even tried to do."
"Oh. That's why your eyes are the same colour." Harry said off-handedly, lapsing in to a thoughtful silence again.
"You're one of the last heirs." Ron remarked to Draco, "You and Sirius, but you don't even have the last name."
Draco knocked twice at the door of the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, shot a fearful look at Pansy, and pushed inside after a curt, wispy, “Come in.” was heard.
“Everyone here?” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. Harry glanced to the far back of the group where Draco was lingering with his friends - Parkinsons and Blasé -  as the three tittered gleefully about something together. Draco was between them, arms crossed over his chest and seemed to be eyeing the Professor and muttering things under his breath for the other two to hear and snicker at.
"I hope you have a plan." Draco countered levelly, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees.
just for her to pull the Fool Tarot card for you! What in Merlin, Morgana and Circe's fucking
"You are beyond repair." The man declared, "I will carry out my master's vision starting with you."
She looked, unlike her usual self, ridden of the usual pompous poise and condescension. Harry straightened up, satisfied that he’d won. Without another word, he brought back his chair and sat down. Umbridge did the same, carefully settling herself back in her chair and resuming her marking with a notably shaky hand.
"But he hasn't woken up in hours-"
“I….” Umbridge said, smoothing over a single wrinkle on her sleeve primly. “I do recall...something about...”
"What's it for?" Draco asked, trying to avoid the coming conversation.
"But he couldn't have Disapparated out." Draco said thoughtfully.
He shot out of his seat, his chair scraping across the floor behind him. “Detention for what? Telling the truth?”
"Sunny side's." Draco repeated, "Right."
"Harry, was that
"See you then, Malfoy." He said with a wink and a mischievous grin. Draco rolled his eyes and made his way to the Dungeons. He needed to talk to Pansy.
"I…erm." Draco trailed off, looking the most inarticulate Harry had seen him yet. "Right." He said bluntly with a hint of fake nonchalance, "And why would they…not care, exactly?"
Dumbledore, McGonagall, Hooch, Sprout. All seated and watching avidly. Draco looked closer. Next to the half-giant. Between him and Flitwick.
… This is the Black family home? The…what was it called…."
“You’re not fine, mate. Do you need Pomfrey?” Ron said, bending next to him. “Why are you bleeding? Your hand….It’s all…”
“Merlin.” Blaise exhaled. “And this is just Level Four.”
"Harry." Draco said, snapping him out of his thoughts. "What the hell is going on?"
“I just remembered I had something to do,” Draco replied calmly, shoving his things into his bookbag. “Sorry, you stay here and finish your essay. Don’t wait up, I might be a while.”
"Oh, please. And people think
The door bust open, and Moody was immediately stunned and bound by Albus Dumbledore. Snape walked in after him, face falling when he looked at Draco.
“Oh, Merlin.” He murmured.
Something stuck in Draco’s throat at that. On one hand, he was pleased the kid knew the House so well and saw it for what it really represented. On the other, however, he had no idea how to convey that Slytherin just...wasn’t like that anymore. It was heavily embedded with Pureblood culture now, so much so that it sometimes completely rebranded the house entirely. This child...they knew Slytherin at its barest bones, but there was flesh and blood and other things that surrounded it that would make things much more complicated for them.
Draco's eyes widened, "Barty Crouch's son? But he's the Head of the DMLE!" He whispered harshly.
"I don't know anymore."
Harry jumped backwards as if the person had electrocuted him. “Oh, H-hi Cho. What’s up?”
wasn't present.
"Not the covers." Draco said. "Inside. Gossip sections. Politics. Wherever they can. After Dumbledore's speech, talk of Voldemort coming back spiked panic. The papers are trying to make you look even more insane and now they're trying to do the same to Dumbledore, calling him senile and all of it a hoax. It's probably the Ministry's doing, trying to downplay his comeback."
“Correct!”
"Surely Dumbledore can snuff out a mole easily." said Ron. "He's not the most powerful for no reason."
. Fine, Hermione." He moved in closer and she leaned in the slightest bit.
Draco couldn't help the beaming smile that spread over his face. "Thank
"Hermione! You have to help me-" Harry started, urgently in a hushed tone.
." They made their way back down the stairs to where Ron and Hermione might have run off to.
“At this moment, no.”
“Pass.” Blaise smiled slightly, the corner of his mouth twitching. “And her new one’s not too shabby, if i’m being honest.”
Two chapters at once! I felt bad leaving a cliffhanger, to be quite honest. We're almost done with fourth year, but not even near the end. What have i gotten myself in to.
He thought, more tears rolling down his face.
"Oh, ho, ho! Someone's cranky, today! Not sleeping well? Or are you still fainting like a sick doe every so often?"
"Yes, dear." She started leading him towards the flight of stairs with her hands on his shoulders. "Now while walking up the stairs you may come across a draped painting. Do
"What about it?" Harry asked, looking at him confusedly as if he had no idea Draco would be concerned about it.
Something lodged itself in his throat, his heart dropping as he thought about the mindset he had had back then.
Snape seemed to have it in for Harry even more than usual, which he'd thought impossible but was unfortunately proven wrong.
"One."
Another triangle note was in his hand.
"What exactly is the nature of you and Sirius's relationship?"
He quirked his head. It seemed his mother wanted to have tea with him again. Usually she just left him alone over the holidays.
Luckily, however, his father got his post from a separate part of the house, and Draco could always keep using Hedwig. He had to anyway, since he still didn't know Harry's muggle address. How did he get Draco's, anyway? Knowing Harry, he probably said something stupid like say 'Draco Malfoy's house' to his own owl. The poor soul was simple like that.
The boy's eyes widened in panic before Mrs. Weasley honed in on him like a vulture.
Draco swallowed heavily, taking Bill's hand. "Draco."
Stepping on to the platform of the Hogwarts Express, Draco was hit with the full rushing atmosphere of school students and their families making their farewells. He tried not to crane his neck or make it obvious he was scanning the crowds for the Weasley's. He'd never gotten a letter from Remus, so he assumed Harry was just fine.
“Nothing. Tch.”
"Fuck off!" Harry called back, already down the hallway.
"No, wait." Bill cut him off. "I didn't - I'm not saying this to make you apologise. I'm not looking for that. Even telling by your reaction, I know you recognise where you went wrong. What I'm trying to get at here is I - hell, all of us are here fully well knowing what you were like few years prior. Ron told us enough, I'm sure you can imagine." Bill grinned humorously, but Draco didn't feel up to returning it. "So once us and the rest of the Order heard from Dumbledore that you would be joining, good half thought it was a joke. The other were…less receptive, if you can imagine."
"What? This isn't because of
"Slightly relieved at the drop in uncomfortable conversation..." ----> "He took a moment to really take in the words and almost laughed aloud."
"Start working or shut up."
"Oh…er. Alright, what is it." Harry said nervously.
"Good." She said. She walked up to him, holding out a hand to shake. "Call me Hermione from now on, then."
“Maybe it’s an old weapon,” Harry suggested, which earned him an unimpressed look from Draco.
He looked up into the mirror, seeing someone he barely recognised. Their hair was messy, but patched down at the hairline with sweat. Their glasses were sliding down their nose and their messy, untucked shirt stuck to their heaving chest, as if they’d just come from running a mile.
"The task is tomorrow!" Harry exclaimed, trying to reign in the volume of his voice, "We don't have time.
I can’t provide you guys a tumblr @ or something which i think a lot of writers here use? idk man i feel like i dodged a bullet never having it.
Lancaster, for the first time that morning, seemed to realise that the information he was giving them was a bit overboard. “Well…” he trailed off, eyebrows falling.
"Naturally." Draco remarked, and ignored Harry's glare.
"I know. But don't feel obligated to have to know these things before they happen. And don't feel obligated to save me from them."
The idea of using a 'spot' in dueling was another outdated, traditional technique. It was done by having your eyes fixed on the middle of the target, and allowing your focus to blur just slightly so you could take in information from you periphery as well as your normal line of sight.
"You shouldn't be in this Tournament. You're just a boy." Draco said to him, so softly it could have been wind rushing past Harry's ears.
Draco stabbed a finger on Harry’s chest, “Back before Dumbledore charitably shoveled points into your house in First Year. Don't start this conversation with me because Merlin, it gets me mad, Harry.”
Harry stiffened, hands clenching the blanket covering him. "Are…are you sure?" He asked cautiously. "Like really,
"Good." Ron deflated, and Hermione smiled at him warmly which he returned wholeheartedly.
He wiped his cheeks some more.
He heard stomps from the top of the flight of stairs, seeing Draco doubling back to see him with the most shell-shocked look on his face as Harry lay flat on the floor.
A few expletives from Uncle Vernon, and another pair of footsteps sounded, this time lighter. Aunt Petunia, then. The locks on his door jingled and the handle jostled before Uncle Vernon came bounding in, looking extremely sweaty and wild-eyed. His eyes immediately locked on Harry's wand still held in his hand, and he seethed.
"Okay, sir." Harry said, wincing at his sensitive muscles sending shoots of pain through him, "Just give me a moment to get up." Slowly, he came to stand, legs protesting and his head going slightly light and dizzy. McGonagall watched him as if he might as well have been on fire in front of them.
"Potter, are you bloody listening?" He heard Malfoy snap, bringing himself out of that particularly scary train of thought. Harry smiled sheepishly and gestured for Malfoy to continue.
Harry thought miserably,
. When he told me that he believed the Dark Lord would be back, there was absolutely nothing on his face that suggested he believed anything otherwise. Don't expect me to ever admit this outside of this room, but I believe the git. He may be an idiot, but this is one thing he is right about."
“Merlin,” Draco muttered distastefully. “Guess Ha- Potter isn’t failing one subject, hm?”
Harry looked up in time to see Remus wince. "Merlin, don't make it sound like we're plotting against him."
The day after, he passed Harry in the corridor while on the way to Transfigurations. He was backed by Granger and Weasley, whom barely spared a glance at Draco as they passed.
Ice ran through Harry's skin when Snape mentioned the Gillyweed, and it took all of him not to furtively glance to the side where Draco was leant over his potion. Snape didn't wait for a reply, and swished off to torment Neville's explosive cauldron.
He stepped in to the warmly lit parlor where his mother often sat for tea. There was already a tray laid out with his favourite pastries, and he melted at the sight as the tension in his body left behind a dull throb of hunger.
“Draco?” Blaise ripped him out of his thoughts again.
"It's about everything." Harry said. "Some more than others."
The Gargoyle began to move, revealing a spiralling staircase that led up to Albus Dumbledore’s office. Draco stepped in as it started to move upwards.
Draco thought for a moment, realising that there was Quidditch practise that he’d completely forgotten about. “Yes, actually. At two.”
"She may just trust you." Dumbledore said. "My sources say that no matter her position, she always keeps a close circle of people whom she works with to delegate tasks. I'm going on the assumption that as a teacher, things won't be so different."
Draco stretched out his muscles, which were tight with fatigue. A few hours of sleep was bound to show up his face, and he still had to chase after his wand. Gathering up his clothes, he checked his watch and quickly went to shower, hoping to catch Potter before class so he could get his
"Oh." Draco said dully, "Where's the rest of it." Snape coughed suspiciously in to his sleeve next to him and Draco looked back down at the paper, "And what's this for?"
"Almost there." said George. "We've been testing them out on each other - taking turns at least."
"We went to sit by the Lake, or rather Potter did. Wasn't going to get my robes dirty." Draco said, "Then Potter started talking about Merlin knows what, and then he said something about my father, then I said something about his lack thereof…"
“Like about Dumbledore and I being crazy? Being liars?” Harry couldn’t stop his voice from growing in intensity, his fists clenching at his sides. He broke out into a cold sweat, breath starting to come out fast. He was sick of it; sick of being singled out like this all the time. Being stared at and having judgement passed on him without having any say in it by people who didn’t even know him-
"And I promise I won't ever antagonise you again. Neither will I do the same for any muggleborn ever again."
Put shortly, he was positively obsessed with this bloke and it was taking over his brain.
"Yeah." Harry said again apologetically.
"You can't have help from non-competitors. Why not ask Cedric or something? He's a Hufflepuff. I'm sure he'll spill it." Draco said simply.
Once again, the shining ruby ink showed up in his messy scrawl, and his hand only began to sting along with an uncomfortable itch. He looked at it briefly, wondering if a Bowtruckle earlier that day took a bite out of him before gasping loudly, the sound echoing in the silent room.
"I'm waiting." Harry sung, thoroughly enjoying the moment. Malfoy scoffed and tried again, taking a gulp of air.
“Which part?”  Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had probably intended. “Professor?” he added in a more polite tone.
(See the end of the chapter for
They lapsed in to silence, just like the day before, and as weird as it may have looked, Draco relaxed slightly in to it. The hushed quiet, his aching body and the warmly lit room from the fire across them made him want to melt in to the chair.
"It's done now, Hermione." Harry said quietly. "There's no point…" He gestured vaguely with his hands, "Telling me it was wrong."
"I'm not going to apologise about anything I've done to you over the years, because quite honestly you deserved them. You're a bully, you insult my friends and you almost killed me last year with the dementor episode. That being said, if you want to start over, I propose a truce. You're not so bad, if you don't open your mouth as much."
"The Order of the Phoenix." Dumbledore said. "As of today I am reinstating it." He said to the surprise of Snape next to him.
Draco looked away, feeling himself flush, "Not exactly…No."
"What about him?"
Harry blew out a sharp breath, pocketing it. "You scared me." He remarked.
“Do you need me to write it down for you?”
"I- I just bonded them. It wasn't
"BOYS!" Mrs. Weasley bellowed from one floor down. "LUNCH!"
"Draco, you look like shit." Blaise muttered, leaning in. Draco weighed his options on how to reply, not wanting to possibly anger the boy again. He hadn't quite planned an excuse for why he might have looked marginally sub-par in appearance than usual. Of course, he wouldn't have needed to if he had his wand to cast at least a few glamour charms on himself. He just shrugged and acted like the butter on his croissant required the utmost precision.
“You okay?” Ron asked next to him. They were squeezed on the same armchair they’d sat in on the night of the Yule Ball. Harry was pretty sure it was a much tighter fit than last time, accredited mostly to Ron’s large growth in height as opposed to Harry’s lack thereof over the last few months.
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” There was a cold edge to her surface-level sweet tone.
Harry quickly made his way to her front porch where she was standing and peering around furtively along the street. He stood in front of her for a few moments, before her eyes finally landed on him her lips tightened impatiently.
"Of bloody course. Bloody Gryffindors. Bloody Huffelpuffs." Draco grumbled, and Potter laughed again. "But you really should do the egg thing, though. Do what, take a bath?" Potter nodded, "Right. Go crazy with it then. Merlin knows the boy may have been on to something." Draco assured him disgruntledly.
"What I don't get is," She said to Harry as they continued to work, pointedly ignoring the two behind them, "Why have a separate meeting with a few people and Draco without the rest of the Order?"
He glanced at the letter with anticipation, then shook himself and went to open it before he could hesitate again. He was pleased to see Draco's neat script when he unfolded the paper, and blew a sigh of relief. Worst case scenario, the Owl got to Draco's father…Harry shuddered again at the thought.
It was moments before he realised his shoulders were heaving in to the space his body was curled around. His shoulders were moving like he was laughing. It was odd, because he didn't find anything particularly funny at the moment.
He'd been sitting there for majority of the afternoon, unable to be in his spot by the Lake because of the dreary weather much too soggy for a day in march.
"I would hug you, but I don't particularly want to look like I regularly engage in embracing air." Harry surmised.
"The Dark Lord will not have blood-traitors serving him. You are a disappointment to your family name, Malfoy. How
"Alright!" Harry exclaimed. "God, you're insufferable."
“She’s the new Defence teacher.” Draco said casually, careful not to let on that he knew more than he should.
The first thing Harry felt when he woke up was a familiar blunt pressure on his nose, which meant he had fallen asleep with his glasses on again. Bugger that. But why did his bed feel so…soft and stiff at the same time. It was almost as if he was on the…
"Sorry." He muttered, turning away.
“Quidditch?” Hermione asked. “Wh- Are you trying out, Ron?”
Harry raised an eyebrow again, huffing in amusement. “You...you don’t remember, Professor? It
The Professor frowned for a second, before turning to Draco. “And you?”
But when he did have them, it was Moody's wand pointed at him and the sound of someone screaming that he couldn't place to a face he knew. He shut his eyes quickly and took a deep shuddering breath.
Draco turned to Harry, eyes wide in disbelief. "You went
-o-o-
“What?” Harry said, horrified. “Can’t you-”
"I'm serious! And
"Personally, I'd have welcomed a Dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. At least you've been able to get out, I've been stuck in here for a month -"
"Someone actually owns this place?" Draco said, whom had been silently thinking up till then. "I would've thought you found it by chance if I didn't sense so much dark magic inside. It's absolutely
The last thing he needed was Rita Skeeter seeing Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy leaving the Yule Ball early together.
But he couldn't really understand what the boy meant by them, so he put them away in his mind.
"Oh, none of that, I'm not your teacher anymore. Call me Remus."
"I'm a very good liar." Draco retorted.
"Nothing else? Nothing suspicious?" Draco pressed on. He tapped his index finger impatiently. There was something more, something he was missing. He could tell he knew it but couldn't seem to recall.
Sirius didn't even bother to register what Draco said, already pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes as if begging for strength. "The things I could do with that…" He said almost painfully, "If his father hadn't given it to him I'd have taken it for myself. He can do a
“You were spacing.”
"Shit." Harry said under his breath. "Fine. We'll talk after lunch - all of us. Ron and Hermione are in on it, too."
"Yes." Draco threw his mind back to what it said about the spell in the book he had found it in, "A Fidelius Charm is an extremely difficult, multifaceted and potent charm that can be used to conceal a secret inside an individual's soul." Harry's eyebrows drew up in surprise, and Draco continued, "The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it."
with him…
"It's alright, but stop saying sorry so much, will you? You're freaking me out to be quite honest." Harry said jokingly, but he meant some of it as well. Malfoy smiled again, something Harry felt like he would never stop being startled by.
“Come here.” Umbridge said finally after what felt like hours, her voice soft with a hand held out. Harry momentarily chased that softness without thinking, reaching out with his hand to put it in hers before stopping himself abruptly. His hand hovered in the air before hers and it just retracted slightly before Umbridge grabbed it - not roughly, but with enough grip to make him surrender the limb.
He pushed in the parlor room with a little more force than necessary, and slumped in the lounge chair across his mother without caring if he'd get reprimanded for it. Luckily she said nothing from where she was sat across him.
"Out of the way, Potter. Merlin knows all you're good for is wasting potions ingredients." He drawled. Snape came up behind him and did what Harry thought was smile.
"Weird?" Malfoy looked surreal, like he couldn't believe he was there.
-o-o-
Draco winced at the sheer vehemence in Blaise's tone, but didn't feel too bad for Nott because everyone in Slytherin knew about Blaise's infamous temper. It wasn't that the boy was particularly dangerous when he got angry, but once you pushed him far enough, you'd almost wish you were
"Yes." Harry said noncommittally, shoving it into his lap. Draco's hands immediately went to grasp the soft fabric, seeing his hands disappear beneath them. "Just until after the task. You can use it to come see me afterwards, since you're so worried I won't come back."
"You were just a kid, Draco. It's not your fault. He manipulated you."
“That Voldemort-” the woman flinched, to Harry’s pleasure, “-is back and alive. Oh no, that wouldn’t be a good idea at all.”
pink than that of the other day. There were porcelain plates hung up on the wall behind her, sporting various cartoon kittens and surrounding a clock of the same severity in design. Her desk seemed to have some sort of lace cloth over it, that vaguely reminded him of his Aunt Petunia’s frilly curtains (although not even his aunt would go near such a shade of pink). Everything else on top of the desk was no better, and Harry thought that maybe the school surely had regulations on this sort of thing. It was truly foul.
“Seamus-” Dean got up and grabbed the boy by the arm harshly, whispering so harshly that everyone in the room could practically hear it. “Let’s not hound him.”
he said back to the voice. He almost even believed it. The voice replied with something that he blocked out immediately, making it nothing more than a muffled string of words that as much as he rejected with his every being, sent fear running through him all the way to his bones.
.” Harry insisted, “She already hates me. All I have to do is drop a pencil wrong, and she’d find a way to put me in detention.”
Harry scoffed, letting out a small chuckle at her. “Try again, Professor. I’ve already said it, have I not?”
"Thanks." Harry said, "So we were forced to yell at each other. But then his father came up, and apparently he doesn't actually tell Draco anything."
"That can be arranged, traitor." Moody said. He readjusted his grip on his wand and pointed it in their direction. It was uncertain whom the spell might hit, but Harry didn't have it in him to move.
Draco scoffed humorlessly, “I’ll trade you.”
"Yes, please."
"I need to go tell Mum." Ron said, engrossed in staring at his badge and letter. "See you."
"I know. If he'd wanted a date so badly, I don't think this is the way to g-"
"Get up there." Vernon said, his eyes glazed over beyond the edge of rage. He had a painful iron grip on Harry's arm as he handled him towards the first step.
The black leather wristband of his watch caught his attention, reminding him of the time. Becoming aware of his surroundings once again, Draco gave one lasting look down at Ronald before continuing on his back to the common room. Hopefully, Blaise would still be up.
"Yeah." Harry snorted. "This one's way better, at least. Just got to shoot a few spells and I'll be on my way." He leant back on his hands lazily.
It made her so easily manipulated, just like this. Such a woman, cruel and unforgivable, and yet she was somewhat still a child.
"I will." Draco said, his voice stone cold and not a hint of uncertainty beneath them. A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.
"And you said yes?" Blaise asked, now heavily invested in the situation. Draco hummed and Blaise drew a sharp intake of breath.
It was around two in the afternoon when the front door knocker sounded, and several pairs of footsteps sounded on floorboards across the house.
"Again." His father said, already walking away. Draco got up, rubbing his sore back and bruised arms with a sigh. His muscles felt tight and weak, and if he spent too long in one specific position they'd start to shake.
Once settled at the breakfast table with Sirius, Remus, Tonks and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, barely even minutes later did Harry come barreling in. His clothes were obviously haphazardly thrown on and of course his hair was unbrushed. Draco would've bet Galleons the boy didn't even own a comb.
look at me, posting one week after the other ;))
potter." Malfoy drawled when he finally managed to regain his cocky composure, "Like any Slytherin would go with you! Whoever actually agrees to go with a plebian Gryffindor like you could be the biggest fool in the school!" His composure was once again slightly slipping - Harry could tell.
Hermione frowned at Ron. "He's not a
Harry kept his eyes on the ground, sweeping at almost nothing. "Fine."
He screamed inside, but nothing came out of his mouth. His body felt slow and sluggish, adrenaline subsiding. He couldn't think straight. Everything was a muddled mess, and his muscles ached from the Cruciatus and then the duel.
"I'd hate to have been that kid..." Remus said with a fearful expression. All six of them begun to crack up, and Harry noticed more people were filing in to start lunch.
Harry glanced down at it pensively. He rotated his wrist, making the lights above bounce off of the damaged skin.
His father turned around quickly, piercing blue gaze on him in an instant. "Yes,
"What did he say? And what's a red-herring?" Draco asked confusedly. Potter chuckled slightly.
"Draco?" Harry peeked at him from under his arm, "You okay?"
He closed the door, pausing for a second before shaking his head to himself and leaving. Walking away, he was hyper-aware of the steps he took, as if Draco was tracking him through the entire house. Creepy bastard.
Harry smiled weakly at them, wanting to tell them not to worry and that it wasn't difficult. That he really was alright. He wished he had the energy to talk to them normally again or have a game of chess with Ron.
"Probably not." Harry shovelled an entire egg yolk in to his mouth, and Draco had to avert his eyes. "Unlike you." He said with a stupid grin that irritated Draco even more.
Draco shivered, and quickly packed up his stuff to go back to the Common Room where a couch by the fireplace had his name on it. He had much to think about.
"Molly's just fine, dear." She said, pulling back with another warm smile. Draco tried to replicate it, but feels like it comes across more pained than friendly. "Now, how are you?" Her eyes passed over him and Draco is terrified to see a glint of unsatisfaction in them.
“I see.” Draco nodded. “Any particular reason for the correspondence?”
anyways, that's enough sap for a lifetime. thank you all once again. I'll keep trying my best from here, I promise!
was there...and you were there and Cedric was…
Draco mirrored him a moment later, "We should…go get some sleep, though. You've had a long day."
They walked to the side that was the most quiet, and seemingly the one that most families steered away from.
Hedwig swooped in, dropping the letter on his desk and settling on her perch inside her cage. Harry quickly ruffled through his trunk for some owl treats and stuffed far too many inside next to her. She hooted happily and he left her to gobble it down.
"See you later?" Harry said, stretching his arms over his head with a big yawn. Malfoy echoed him, although he looked far more graceful doing it.
"Well then just ignore him or something." Harry said. "And from now on what you tell me, we share with them."
“Gryffindor is for bravery and nerve.” They waved Draco off, which he had to admit he found quite amusing. “It’s not the same thing, obviously. Slytherin is what I really want.”
"Yes, ma'am." He said, and she huffed and walked away to summon some food from the kitchens.
"Be careful, Harry." Sirius said, his grey eyes burning in to Harry's in a sort of familiarity he couldn't quite place.
"Wow." said Draco, genuinely in shock. "Zonko's doesn't even have anything like what these would be. This also explains those extensive ear things."
"I mean where were you at breakfast? Ron said he also didn't see you in your bed this morning. Harry if there's anything you need you can talk to us-" Anxiety spiked in Harry immediately. He hadn't realised how much energy he'd spent trying to avoid the topic at all.
He just wanted to see his Patronus again. That was it. The blazing stag was something he could never forget, but seeing it each time was also as if seeing for the first time.
"Hey" Harry said softly. He closed the door and went to sit on the bed that was propped against the opposite wall to Ron's. Laying his elbows on his knees, Harry sighed. "What's up?"
Viktor Krum was the next to leave the maze unconscious.
side."
“Finite.” He panted. His body felt leaden with fatigue as he held it over the sink. “Finite.”
"And will you, to your best ability, put your own safety first even if it meant harm becoming of me instead?"
Harry considered throwing himself in to the fire very seriously at that moment. It genuinely had no downsides except agonizing pain. No Tournament, no Parvati, no dancing and most of all, no Malfoy! Harry sighed dreamily at the thought.
"They all learned to become Animagi because of…something - unregistered, of course. Pettigrew's Animagus form was a rat, and he'd spent the years as - and please know I'm telling the truth - Ron's pet rat Scabbers."
-o-o-
Draco swallowed, walking a few more steps in with his heart pounding. Once he a safe distance away in case the thing decided to maul him again, he stopped. He kept his shoulders back, keeping unfaltering eye contact as the pride within him fought the urge to submit completely.
Remus's eyes widened for a second. "Of course, anything."
"No, we mostly talk about the weather so we don't have the time." Draco said flatly, and Pansy harumphed in response.
. Trust Potter to forget to give it back at all. It was all his
"It's late. Why are you here?"
He braced himself and took a quick breath. He needed to be quick if no one saw. Too slow, and it would catch someone's eye.
Draco shook his head, “No, why would they intercept an Owl to my father if that were the case? He works for the Ministry. Not to mention it would be illegal to intercept the Post...”
Having been mildly educated on how to duel just last summer, he remembered to not react immediately when a spell was cast, but to watch and listen first in the spare millisecond the spell was leaving the wand. Of course , that was a risky technique for obvious reasons, but it was highly effective when done properly in that you could block or dodge the spell appropriately, since some like the killing curse couldn't be blocked.
"Only because of you." said Fred. "Of course we're only doing it through mail service, for now. Mum would go absolutely
"It must have been
hits him quicker than he can react, and he only has time to angle his body away before he lands on his back with a dull thud.
Harry woke up to Hedwig tapping on his window, and he immediately jumped out of bed. He quickly scrambled to throw on his glasses on to his face, and barely suppressed a whoop of joy when he saw a letter in her claws.
Hermione and Harry had unanimously agreed to pair Ron and Draco off to clean one half of the room while they took the other as a sort of bonding exercise. Hermione had suggested it would force them to work together and set aside their differences, but so far it seemed to only be filling the room with constant arguing and tension from the two.
"You'll live." He croaked. Harry patted him on the back as he walked by to retrieve another pan, and Draco was luckily given respite for his trauma, steered by Molly to sit across Sirius at the dining table away from the carnage. The man was stirring a spoon magically, his tattooed and heavily ringed finger waving in lazy circles. With further study, he realised Sirius didn't have a wand on him and was using magic without it.
Ron snorted in to his hand, and Harry and Hermione stared at him.
Harry sighed and took off his glasses, rubbing his eyes. "Can you really tell when anyone is lying?" He started cleaning his glasses with his shirt.
“Five seconds,” Blaise announced. Draco glanced at Snape, who was watching glowering at them from behind his desk. It was safe to say that the man definitely knew something was up, but Draco figured that he either had entirely no evidence to actually accuse them or really couldn’t be bothered.
"I don't give a toss! Don't trust him just because he's a good Quidditch player!"
"I'm sorry." He said.
"Draco." A voice called. He looked around to see Bill popping his head out the kitchen door. "Meeting today. Dumbledore will be here soon."
"-ated it. You're part will be most useful." One of the men said, walking out with his father right behind.
He gulped and made his way to the desk where the chair and parchment were already beckoning him.
The amount of times I've misspelled Blaise's name in this chapter???? Fucking rude. I almost killed him off mid chapter for no apparent reason than never having to write 'Bliase' every again.
on his wand, he'll hex Potter with his own tenfold.
On an especially stuffy day, the Potions classroom was stifling and even Snape couldn't seem to handle the heat. The man was billowing his robes much more than usual, and nobody missed the sheen of sweat on his brow which he tried to wipe away surreptitiously from time to time.
"It's like Potions, so you should be fine." Harry said conversationally, glancing at him as he worked. "You should roll up your sleeves, though." He gestured to Draco's long sleeves then back to his own rolled up ones.
“I . . .” said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. “I...Well...Wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really —”
When classes ended that day, Draco went straight to his dormitory and fell asleep for about three hours, uniform and all. His friends luckily didn't notice much was wrong, or didn't bother to find out, which was just as well to Draco. One of the good things about being at Hogwarts was being away from the over-nurturing of his mother. He knew she meant well and he loved her for it, but the woman hung over him like a shadow over every little thing. She alone was the reason why Draco had scarless pale skin all the way from his childhood. He was pretty sure she used to punish the house elves if he came back from playing with even the smallest scratch. Now he'd rather just be left alone. He didn't care much about scars, on or not on his body.
“Good night.” he said when Umbridge told him he could leave. Harry noted that she hadn’t made eye-contact with him the whole evening. He smiled slightly and left.
"So what is it you want." He said.
Draco sat up on his knees, letting the book in his lap fall away to the ground. He pressed his hands to the glass, getting as close as he could to garner any sort of view better than the one he had.
"-Ron." Harry said warningly.
, Harry." Draco chastised him gently, pulling the boy's hands away and dabbing his face carefully with the tissues. He might still be sore from the effects of the Cruciatus, just like Draco was at that moment, but was ignoring. Harry sat there, letting Draco clean his face completely unresponsive.
Then the apparent resurrection of The Dark Lord from the use of the potion from which Harry's blood was forcibly taken.
“Good Morning, Professor Umbridge. My name’s-” Pansy started politely, but was interrupted by the woman holding up a stubby finger and an uttered, “
He urgently waved her off, a hand already massaging his knee. "M' alright. Go see Harry."
Harry snorted beside him, "Maybe I should be glad I'm not going, then."
Draco looked pointedly at Harry, who stiffly said, “I was sent to see you.” He held up the pink note with two fingers as if touching it fully would burn him.
“He thinks I’m crazy, and so does his Mum!” Harry yelled back, eyes wet. “Just what the stinking Prophet says, and everyone else thinks the same thing! Everyone!”
Everything went quiet for a while, but Harry could tell that Ron was silently communicating with the others in the room. He didn’t dare look up, but heard the sounds of them settling into bed quietly. What was wrong with him? Maybe he really was unstable. First what happened at Grimmauld Place before he’d passed out, and now this? He was clearly unfit, maybe even dangerous. Maybe the papers were right…
"Bloody hell, you don't just say things like that, Harry." He muttered with a flush and looking around if anyone heard.
Hermione, to Harry's surprise, swore colourfully and crossed her arms over her chest. Harry let out a huff and leant back in his chair.
"You made it very easy to suspect you!" Harry said defensively, face burning. "Tell me it's not easy." He gestured to all of Draco.
With a long sigh, he leaned his head back on the back of the lounge chair so his head was facing the ceiling. He closed his eyes, letting the crackle of the fire fill his head instead of the repetitive phantom echo of spells flying by his head and his own laboured breathing between casts. He needed to learn some more spells. And how to cast non-verbally. His stamina could have been a bit better too, having not been able to play Quidditch that year. His father was bloody quick despite being…however old he was. Draco never bothered to know.
Draco was too tired to get angry just then, but he closed his eyes and fell asleep with the last fleeting thing on his mind a very pleasant daydream about hexing Albus Dumbledore.
“Nothing much.” She said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.
"They're all here because they believe in you, Harry." Draco said insistently, "The only reason anyone is in this damn
"Er…Yeah. Barty." And Harry proceeded to tell him about seeing Crouch in Snape's office on the Map.
"And he's paying for it now." Draco looked at Blaise squarely, determination burning in his eyes. "I know what I want for the first time in my life, and its every antithesis to everything my father is." He didn't realise until then he was shaking, anger welling up inside him almost instantly he was surprised he hadn't noticed it before. "Harry will help me with that. He'll help me destroy what my father's existence rides on, and he'll pay for his mistakes."
He clenched his hands tighter to his sides, his back feeling like it was stuck with a bloody iron pole. They continued in silence again, and Draco had never felt more uncomfortable in his life. Was the whole summer going to be like this?
with people like
Harry, the git, laid down where he was sitting and closed his eyes, "Bugger. A nap sounds great, Draco. Wake me up when the sun sets, please." He said sweetly, and Draco whacked him once in the stomach.
" Sirius objected warningly. "Remember what I said earlier." He hissed, immediately making Draco's eyes retract their venom slightly. Harry looked between the two, sensing some sort of unspoken agreement he wasn't apart of. He didn't press it further, just glad it got Draco off his back.
"You're a fool, Harry." Draco spat, "That wasn't what we agreed-"
“I’m serious.” Ron said insistently, going back to his bed to grab his red and gold school-tie and loop it around his neck. “It’s terrible. Mum would have a fit if she saw it.”
Shaking, he straightened his body out. Buckbeak rose again, and beside him stepped Harry. He bowed slightly, gaining an accepting bow from the bird, shorter and more curt than the one it had given Draco.
Draco looked to the side at Harry again. His face was alight with a simple kind of joy. It seemed strange to Draco how he could find peace in the smallest of things. As big as a place Harry had in this world, he didn't ever seem to seek more than he could have, and watching as he found joy in just the act of interacting with this great beast had something in Draco's chest hurting something fierce.
Lancaster gnawed at his lip, looking agitated at the subject. “There is one person… A man they told me was the ‘Supervisor’ of the Organisation department.”
"What is it, Harry?" Hermione said urgently.
Malfoy sighed like he was talking to a child, "Like I said earlier, Potter, it's all political. People do things like this at Ball's all the time."
Harry stared at the face of Regulus. He hadn't known Sirius had a brother, let alone one that was dead. He wondered what had happened to him for Sirius not to mention him.
"Merlin, is it getting worse?"
“Erm, yeah,” Harry said, shifting in his chair uncomfortably. He would have just started doing the lines as normal if not for Umbridge withholding that bloody quill of hers.
"So you and Potter…a truce?"
“Sorry.” Ron said hurriedly, shaking on his school trousers so messily that Harry was unsure whether he was even putting them on the right way. “Was talking to the others. Forgot you were still in bed.”
“But - you said it was him...Yet you…” She stopped and looked up at him slowly. “You were there…”
"F...Fuck you." Draco croaked, feeling saliva running down his chin. Moody got up, bracing himself with his wand pointed at Draco again.
Harry's eyebrows rose, amused, "Ah, I see." He stood up, brushing off his jeans. "Fine. I'll do your portion of the cleaning too, tomorrow."
-o-o-
"I'm her
Draco nodded, looking down at his lap instead of Bill's face.
. I could tell he's been lying to me for a while but I was too ignorant to do anything about it. He never spoke to me about his 'business' dealings, what he did all the time."
Pansy clicked her tongue next to them, adding another wrong shaped leaf to her diagram.
Harry leant forward as well, eyebrows drawn in concentration. “England, Wiltshire, Mal- Malfoy?” He squinted his eyes, jostling Draco slightly as he went up close to the parchment and read aloud, “Malfoy Manor…. Dear Lucius…” He drew back quickly, turning to Draco, “Umbridge knows your father?”
to recognise how they would apply to you. Now
"It's a
He joined Ron and Hermione in the Common Room, where they waited with tense smiles as if waiting for him to fall over and break like a fragile piece of glass. He grit his teeth and said nothing about it, barely returning the smiles they gave and juggling his trunk and Hedwig's cage, where the bird was hooting irritably.
Draco brightened. "So am I the first the figure it out?"
at Draco.
Those were all thing Harry thought about every morning, and it always piled up as the day went on, carrying on to the next day.
“When I was at the hearing about Harry’s expulsion,” Dumbledore interrupted him, “I stood next to him, and for the smallest moment, I felt a presence.”
"Draco." Bill's voice called out behind him from the hallway. "It's time."
"Isn't that all a little…too much?" Harry said slowly.
“Save it, Hermione.” Harry cut her off, slumping down onto the bench with a sigh.
He nodded without thinking about it, and she smiled politely again. His movements feeling sluggish, he gestured for her to walk first in to the house. His mind buzzed when the idea of walking in to his father's office caught up with him.
“Ahem.” Blaise cleared his throat, prompting the woman to look up at them from where she seemed to be writing...well, nothing at all. On the page were nothing but vague doodles and what looked like a grocery list. Draco deftly noticed a copy of the Quibbler hidden under a stack of miscellaneous papers on the desk as well, but he minded his business about it.
"And you hid from him…under an Invisibility Cloak?"
Blaise waved him off. “When I need something done, I’ll tell you then.”
"Fuck you. You panicked just as much as me."
. Humiliated. Directionless. He broke down in front of Blaise, and the boy surprised him as he wrapped his arms around Draco as he cried, and wondered why he could never sate the sensation in his chest that just hurt so much. Day by day, the clawing feeling festered inside him. It made his stomach uneasy, increasing with every muggleborn he scorned and every sneer at Potter. He didn't know who he was, only that he wasn't who his father wanted him to be anymore. As much as it hurt to force himself, he found himself believing in it all less and less, and it scared him like nothing had before.
Draco nodded, "Pretty much. It's just how Slytherin House is, and I never really realised it properly until after the Ball, after what you said. Thanks for that, by the way."
" He moaned once out of earshot.
His body felt as if on fire as it kicked in to a fight or flight response while also adjusting to the frigid temperature invading upon the room. He heard a faded scream in his ears, but it was so familiar to him that he didn't even have to remind himself that it was from inside his head. His mother's cried filled his head as he felt himself slipping further in to the abyss in his mind, and panic gripped him so hard he felt his fists grip the sheets of his bed.
Harry’s stomach unsettled again and he put his toast down.
And Nott withered in to himself once again as Blaise paused expectantly.
"Okay. I won't. Thanks for telling me that, though. I know I'm not exactly preferred company."
The sun had now completely emerged and it was becoming almost painful to look at. The brightness made every speck of dust in Potter's glasses glow tenfold and Draco itched to clean them. He clenched his fists and thought about something else.
Hermione rolled her eyes at Ron and ignored him, "I was wondering how you managed to do that, Harry. You were never good at cutting charms."
"Yeah, er. Well we started fighting first, then I said some thing about his father, and he started on the mudbloods, blood-traitors bullshit again."
Harry stayed silent after that, fuming. Draco shrunk away from him slightly.
"Right. I know you all have questions, but I do not care.
"I'm…" He said, feeling something catch in his throat. What did he want to say? Why couldn't he say it if he knew? "I'm just…"
"I still need something more tangible, though. To make sure we both honour the agreement." Harry said.
“Oh,” Ron said, sounding slightly put out. He was glancing across the Hall at the Slytherin table, where there was no sign of Draco. “You mean...one of
“Are there not?” Harry countered, remembering the supposed weapon that Voldemort was looking for, deep within the Ministry. He knew it could only be true if Lucius Malfoy was lurking around there. “The Department of Magical Archives…” he said vaguely, watching her expression closely. “The Department of Unspeakables… the Department of Mysteries….” Umbridge’s eyes flashed at his last guess, and he snapped his fingers, “Aha. The Department of Mysteries, is it?”
“Well, I’m sure your friends have tried to say something?”
"Me neither." Harry matched his awkwardness unfortunately, and cursed himself for looking like a prat with his hands shoved so far deep his trousers they might as well be peeking out the hems.
When he opened his eyes, he smiled. His wand was nestled in his palm, the side-table now bare.
"Fine." Blaise said, smiling knowingly, "As long as you don't go traipsing in to danger like a Gryffindor, the Slytherin will survive in you yet."
“...how else would you buy all that property - in Italy no less! You know my mum loves it there-”
and last but not least, imagine Blaise's robbing-the-ministry fit to be like really attractive. Draco just looked like a professor in contrast (had I added a monocle, it would've sealed the deal).
"The Ministry is trying to close in on us." Dumbledore said coolly, "They insisted she be there to watch over-"
"Yep." Draco patted his trunk beside him.
“Level Three is for units that
"How are you?" Harry asked, still sitting propped up on an elbow. Draco snorted, eyes crinkling as he smiled.
"Did you say Map?" Draco interrupted midway. Harry considered telling him for a moment, and realised that it wouldn't have been the worst thing he's told Malfoy. In for a Knut, in for a Galleon.
Draco sat back with a relieved sigh, but grimaced immediately and crawled up to stand when his knee protested. If he could jump for joy, he would, and if he could let out a celebratory yell, he would. Neither his blasted knee nor his mother's possible intrusion would allow it though, so he settled for flopping on to his bed with a contented sigh.
"He swore them?" Hermione asked in disbelief.
“A connection, though?” Draco crossed his arms over his chest again, but this time it was to fight off the chill that the idea spurred on his body. “What would that mean, exactly?”
“My mum said-”
“Right…” Harry stared at his friend a moment longer before looking away. It wasn’t something he had the energy to think too much about at the moment, so he let it go.
"Theodore Nott, I think his name was. Decent enough for a snake. Still a bit poncey if you ask me, but he was good to Parvati."
"Malfoy?" He asked nervously.
"Oh. Erm, sorry." Harry muttered, feeling stupid for pressing Draco about his father when it wasn't really any of his business.
Harry felt Ron’s eyes on him at his side but he pretended not to notice.
"I like it too." He whispered back, just before succumbing to the darkness.
"Here where?" He asked. The question was so open, Draco felt like he shouldn't have known what he meant. A snowflake fell on his nose, but he didn't feel the cold he expected.
"I reckon he looks more like his mum's side." Hermione said.
“Oh - Hello, Harry!”
"They'll expect Polyjuice before anything else, so we'll be fine." Draco said with a tentative smile, finally glancing at Harry.
"Good. Merlin knows you'll actually have a chance with her around to help you." Harry bristled at Malfoy's tone because it was so often used to antagonise him and his friends, but now it was almost like…he was complimenting Hemione.
Both Blaise and Pansy were silent for a moment, as if waiting for him to add more.
He spotted the flash of white hair easily through the crowd of the platform. Levitating his school trunk behind him, he made his way through the rumble of people until they were stood in front of each other.
A tense silence fell for a moment. "What about it." Harry said seriously.
He sent both Ron and Hermione and letter the day before, and only got curt, infuriatingly polite responses. He didn’t want to be asked about how his summer was going, he wanted to know
Harry couldn't help but let a small smile waver over his face. "I meant that I was sorry that you had to…you know. Be here. See it."
Ron immediately assessed the board, made one move, and at Seamus's cry of fury, said "Checkmate." and made his way to Harry and Hermione.
"Shall I send you an owl? To tell you when he wakes up?"
Draco turned his head to Harry slowly, feeling the slight shake in his head as he did so. Harry was looking at him surely, his hand on his shoulder certain. Draco looked back at the man and let out a deep breath.
Harry thought for a moment, remembering Draco telling him not to tell anyone what his fears had been about his family. "Well, he assured me that he had nothing to do with his father's past actions." And Ron scoffed, but Harry held out a hand, "No, Ron. Wait."
"Wish she was here right now." Ron said. Harry chuckled, rubbing his forehead with a long sigh, fingers bumping on his scar. The chair wasn't meant for two people, so Ron and Harry were squashed together and the wooden arm was digging in to his side. It seemed he was destined for a life of pain.
Harry hiked up his school bag on his shoulder nervously, then without a word went to sit in the chair across from her. His sense of unease only increased with his proximity to the woman. He tried his best not to make eye contact, staring down at the blank parchment.
to be in Slytherin. As powerful as the House was, they weren’t exactly winning popularity contests like the Gryffindors.
Then again, so was Harry. What was he turning in to?
“No thanks.” Draco said quickly, memories of the ferret incident rousing from the depths of his mind.
Draco stiffened and Harry bristled at the cool tone of Remus's. "Y-Yes, Sir." Draco said shakily.
"Draco?" Harry spotted him immediately, eyes narrowing in worry. He didn't look that bad, except it definitely looked like he'd run his hands though his hair way too many times, and now it stood even wilder than when he'd left.
"Who on earth would-"
Harry couldn't help but let his face react to that. The words opened up doors in his head he didn't know what to do with. He needed to set them away. He couldn't figure them out, not right now. They made him feel like he was plunging in to a bottomless, cold lake. Unsure, unstable, unable to float himself if he sunk. Harry preferred it on land, where he could stand, where he could see the lake but nothing in its icy depths. Listening to the alarm bells in his head, Harry's walls went back up, the doors closed with just force, and Malfoy became what he always was. If Harry had to elaborate on such a label for the boy, however, he wouldn't have been able to.
Draco paused for the slightest second.
He gulped, mouth dry. “Alright. Just us.”
“But….If
. And so I need you to get me out this bloody house somehow. Even for a day, I just want
“This.” Draco pointed to the parchment, finger hovering above it unsteadily. “It’s a letter, but look at the address.”

"What you did…from your explanation, I can understand why you had to, to some extent. It would have been too much of a risk if Draco was allowed to go between the two extremes without proper boundaries. I understand where you were coming from."
thank you for reading <3
Harry huffed a hollow, humourless laugh, but Draco continued, "
Harry had the gall to scoff. Draco wanted to throttle him.
"That sounds barmy, not going to lie." Ron stated. Hermione smacked him on the arm and they continued through theories.
"And Harry?" Draco asked, not caring about whatever shoddy club Dumbledore had going on.
"We'll see each other soon, won't we? Over the summer?" Hermione said over Ron. Harry nodded and Ron just scoffed again but muttered a pained, "Yes."
Remus placed a firm hand on Draco's shoulder, stopping him. "He'll be fine, Draco. He just needs to sleep it off. Whatever happened must have exhausted his mind."
"Good. You're here." Harry said hurriedly, quickly starting to pace next to Draco.
"What did you do?" He asked flatly.
“You not coming with?”
"The potion is…er…"
Sirius stared at him for a few moments afterwards, and Harry rubbed his sweaty hands over his jeans as he waited for the man to say something.
Thank you for all your sweet comments! I can't believe people take the time to just be nice. It's so weird.
A small part inside Draco felt genuinely bad for the fellow, but he swallowed any hesitance as he leant over the table inside Lancaster’s office to pour more amber tea into the man’s cup. Just as he held the teapot over the cup, Draco silently popped open a small vial concealed in his palm and let the clear liquid fall in and mix seamlessly with the tea.
Throwing the Cloak over himself, he crept past Ron and Hermione discussing something in the Common Room and slipped through the Portrait when it flew open for somebody else. He crossed through the corridors with the aid of the Map, all the way to the third floor and up to the entrance to the Prefects bathrooms.
He passed through towering trees and over far-reaching roots that could have been bigger than he was if above the ground. The canopy of leaves above him obscured the sky, and it felt cooler than on the walk there from the lack of sunlight. A layer of moisture settled on his skin, making his shirt stick and the hair at the nape of his neck curl. He could hear the distant whistle of birds and whirr of insects around him, but Draco kept his focus on the ground as he began to count.
"Draco." Ginevra said beside him. She'd been incessantly nagging him for - he checked his watch - twenty minutes now. The girl seemed to have a
“I wonder how Defense will be.” Hermione mused as they all walked to their first lesson. People seemed to be veering around them at an equal radius on all sides, which Harry just took as a blessing in the busy halls leading to class.
“As I said earlier, it is only my suspicion.”
"It's not, but they will wonder. Maybe they'll think you've gone weak."
"Right." Draco wrung his hands some more, and Harry felt a moment of irritation when it looked like the other boy
Harry grunted in acknowledgement, the both of them falling into silence again. Above them, an owl shrieked loudly, turning their attention to the ceiling. They stood looking upwards for a bit after that.
“Oh for-” Harry swore under his breath. The last thing he needed was History of Magic first on a Monday morning.
"Right." Draco fumbled with the Cloak, trying his best to fold it despite it's…invisibility. "Sorry again. Here." He handed it to Harry with both hands, eyes averted. Harry took it from him, slinging a bit over his shoulder.
"Fine." Harry said through gritted teeth as he wrenched his gaze from the sickly display. "I'm going."
Eventually, the voices hushed and he actually heard the soft murmur of Harry's voice, making his heart jump. Footsteps started up again, and they all approached the kitchen.
“Class is starting!” Hermione cut in quickly, grabbing Ron and Harry by the back of their robes. “We’ll be seeing you, Cho!”
"So, Harry, where were you this morning?" Ron was sitting next to Hermione in his usual 'I'm on her side' stance.
. You need to prepare him. He's been traumatised, and you just want to ship him off? Would he not be better off living around other wizards and witches? Among magical people he can talk to and trust that will understand him?"
Draco's face softened at that, and he pinched the bridge of his nose, "I know. I'm…sorry. But you can't become complacent, okay? Not many wizards have figured out how to spend copious amounts of time underwater. It won't be easy. Why they'd make
"Yes. A skill courtesy of my father. Now stop deflecting." Draco said in one breath.
It grated on Draco's nerves, too, if he was being honest, but he persevered out of spite.
"Yes, Blaise! I do!" Draco erupted. Taking a deep breath, he pinched the bridge of his nose trying to calm down. He gave himself a moment, then continued.
"Right." Harry said, obviously unhappy.
“Because…” Seamus whirled around, sputtering. His eyes locked on Harry angrily, stabbing a finger in his direction. “Because of you!”
"No, I'm sorry." Draco said, his tone softer than before. "I shouldn't have said it like that. I don't want to fight before we leave." He was looking at Harry so damn
Harry, the git, only chuckled as if they weren't really speaking about his possible death in the near future. "I won't die."
that he still hadn’t gotten started on. Two days, for Merlin’s sake!
"'m fine." He said, his voice rough and jagged and slightly frayed at the ends in utter betrayal. Malfoy's mouth was slack, wide eyes looking over him, assessing something Harry didn't know. He didn't want Malfoy to see him in that state, but there they were, and he was waiting for the boy to make a snide remark or sarcastically insult him. Maybe Harry deserved it. It was his fault for crying at all.
He was just about to bolt before Harry kicked him with his foot. "Stay." He said, with a steely look In his eyes. Damn, now Draco was
"What? No, I never knew, Ron!"
He walked all the way to Arithmancy with his mask of indifference, glad he didn't share the class with either Blaise or Pansy. He wasn't in the mood for either his friends pestering or Professor Vector's droning about Rune calculations, and was quite hoping to try and subtly take a nap at the back of the class. He pushed down his uneasiness from the encounter with Potter and settled for the comfort for having his wand back.
"Oh, a shade of red."
dancing.
Harry smiled back at him, glasses obscuring the view of his eyes with the reflections on the moonlight on them, "It just helps me think, is all." He said, throwing Draco's words back at him from before. Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise. It wasn't anything new, but he had realised Harry wasn't actually dumb as he'd thought, but rather intelligent be it in a different way. He was quick-witted when he wanted to be, and had the ability to know just what to say to different types of people that let him get along with them. Draco supposed that was why Harry was so good at Defense and spellwork. It was also probably why he knew how to keep up with Draco in their usual verbal sparring, or in whatever their resemblance of getting along.
." Ronald said again, annoyed. Draco wordlessly switched the object's place another time.
"Goodnight, mother." He bowed like always, feeling a sharp twinge in his lower back that made him grimace.
Draco frowned and laid back on the ground, still clutching the book to his chest.
“Shush!” Draco hushed him quickly as they both stepped inside. “Now, floor six?”
"What about you, Draco?" Remus asked him.
“Oh, you won’t need ink,” said Professor Umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice. Harry barely rolled his eyes. Pretentious bitch.
He was so close…Just a little more…
"My, what a shame." Draco sighed sarcastically, "A loss for me, really."
Draco trailed off, his teeth gritting together. Images of Harry and Ronald’s stupid faces, snickering and entering the common room as Crabbe and Goyle flashed through his mind.
"Who's Moony?" Draco tried to steer the conversation away. Harry smiled at that, giving him a side glance.
"You're barmy, Malfoy." Harry makes out through wheezes. "Completely fucking insane." And Malfoy just shook his head and rolled his eyes back to his work, continuing to scratch on to the parchment with a small ghost of a smile still on his lips.
Did he really need the cloak? Maybe not! It was way too early for a student to be out in the halls, and the chances of running in to a teacher were low for the most part. Draco just reveled in the idea of being completely unseen, which was a feeling unlike any other because of the way it gave him an upper hand from the get-go if any situation arose.
"Longbottom! Finnigan! Hogwarts spends more on cauldrons for you twats than on then entire faculty payroll!" Snape snapped, but even that felt weak.
Harry swallowed, the way Malfoy's voice sounded almost unrecognisable, and clattered around with alarm bells in his head. It felt wrong, but also right.
"None other than our Chosen One!" Draco puffed his chest out.
"And you can trust him?" Hermione asked, eyes intense just like Sirius's earlier that day.
"Well, at least I have a good place to start, if I did do it." Potter said musingly, obviously setting up some sort of bait that Draco was going to have to take. He ignored the boy in hopes he'd find the silence awkward and continue but it stretched on, and Draco wasn't one for unfilled silences.
"He was in a pout since you left." Hermione appeared on Harry's other side. "Pretty sure he almost made Snape hex him in the meeting earlier."
"Dobby…" Harry yawned and rubbed his eyes, "What are you talking about…"
"What for?" Harry prompted, his chin resting on his palms staring at the boy.
Harry sat forward, a little too interested in a Slytherin educating him about dodgy plants he was supposed to eat. He nodded for the boy to go on.
"Albus Dumbledore says that the Dark Lord has returned." He tried to make his tone hopeful, nonchalant. "And it was him who killed Diggory."
"Your father definitely still believes in it all."
you sound right now, woman."
"Tch." Snape said beside him, stopping and holding out an arm to side-along apparate. "That sentiment better boil away by the time you see your father, I hope you realise."
"I trust you know what occurred that night when the Diggory boy perished?" His father inquired casually, and Draco's heart almost stopped.
Draco regained his dueling stance, with legs apart and knees locked. His wand arm was raised at chest level, and the other was held up as well behind and close to his body to give him the most efficient amount of mobility. "Yes, sir."
." He heard, and could clearly imagine the smug little sneer Draco probably had on his face to go with it. Prick.
"Mhm." Draco agreed, hoping he wouldn't have to talk about it again.
Harry saw Draco's eyes narrow at the man, and he interjected before the other boy could possibly say something rude, "Yes. We're sure." He pulled his most reassuring smile, but could tell  Sirius could see through it easily from the unamused look in his eyes. It had taken half an hour alone to convince Sirius to be their bonder, but with a lot of whining on Harry's part and pestering drawls from Draco, he finally relented. It wasn't quite as hard after they finally explained what exactly the bond was about.
"He'll be fine. Just some well-needed rest for his nerves to repair themselves." Madam Pomfrey assured him when he asked. He was meant to be asleep too, Sirius guarding him from outside in his Animagus form, but he couldn't let go of the tension from the past few hours.
The shame was new, the more he lived like this. It didn't take until Harry talking to him that night of the Yule Ball, finding out about his father's involvement in the opening of the Chamber of Secrets and realising that yes, a war really was coming for him to see how blinded he was. He never told anyone - not even Harry -  how he'd gone to sleep the night of the Yule Ball with his chest feeling like the gaping wound in it had been ripped open again.
Harry shook his head. “Not like this. I don’t even have time to think. I must be really terrible-”
the dumb one here!"
Harry grinned, "Did you forget you're talking to a Gryffindor? Hell yeah I'll do it. I told you I would before."
“Don’t say that!” Ron exclaimed in a whisper. “It’s not normal, being so watched all the time, you know? I’d be ready to crack one in if I was you, too.”
"Watch it, Scarhead." He spat, almost wincing when he remembered Potter telling him how his scar hurt sometimes, "Not everyone has to move aside in the halls for the Chosen One." He successfully garnered a few looks from people around him. He fought the urge to look back at Potter as he walked away, but heard a weak, "Fuck you, Malfoy." just before he turned the corner. Draco felt a stab of worry at the lack of conviction or strength in the boy's tone. It was a pathetic response, and Draco wondered for a moment if Weasley and Granger had something to do with it.
Harry said nothing for a moment, causing Draco to look at him curiously. His face was impassive, but it wasn't exactly the openness it was before. "Something like that." He said after a moment, and his tone indicated the matter be left alone, so he did.
“Gryffindor can do the same thing, I promise you.” Draco countered, both testing their allegiance and trying to convince them that they had other options. Options that weren’t Slytherin House, and it’s cold common room and strict acts of etiquette and bloodied history of Dark Wizards.
"They can't seriously fight any longer than this." Harry swept a hand over his brows, exasperated. "We just need to…wait it out."
you used to thwart your way through that tournament."
Fourteen days before the Second Task, they had yet to sift through even half the books they'd collected. Every volume from
"The position was vacant-"
"Wasn't he…one of them?" Harry asked.
"Oh." He said. They lapsed in to silence again, but this time there was something there he couldn't quite put in to words.
"Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,” Draco drawled, sweeping away a stray strand of hair that had fallen over his eyes. "Wouldn't want our golden boy to get punished on the first day, now would we? If we're going for a track record, however, that may be one of
"Er, right. Sorry. Then I started thinking about Potions for once - rather the class and not the homework - and I realised something felt off but, I couldn't tell what. Then I realised that it was Malfoy's snobby arse not in our faces all the time. I realised I hadn't seen much of him all the way since the Ball, and so I asked Hermione if she'd seen anything-"
." Draco hissed, but sat up to begin speaking anyway, ignoring Harry's hard stare. "But it was about you, actually."
"Oh don't change the subject!" She said, snatching her parchment away and rubbing something out on it, "I've tolerated your little tryst with that blundering Gryffindor idiot all this time, but now it's getting annoying when you're so stressed about him all the time."
“I know it’s a big - no, a
"Morning, Granger." He said gently, his heart slowing down once more.
Through the wrought-iron bars of the long winding staircase of the Manor, he peaked through at the large wooden doors of the dining room. From where he was crouched, he was hidden from view but was still able to watch his father and four other men disappear in to the room just an hour prior.  He had been given a day off from training unexpectedly just that morning, the first he'd had in the last few weeks since he'd arrived.
half-blood in to the family, let alone a bloody elf!"
"What's the need for a weapon if it won't kill? Isn't that his whole thing?" Ron countered.
He screamed at himself.
to go with him with the most shit-eating grin on his face!"
Harry froze, his bandaged hand visible as it was placed over his stomach. “Erm…”
Harry turned around to face him, dropping Draco's hand back to his side and his eyes suddenly alight with curiosity as he looked up at Draco.
"And when your father asks about your time away, you say…"
of a house is because they believe in what you said. They trust you and your word. Dumbledore, the Weasley's, all of them. You're not particularly going to get that kind of reception anywhere else."
“The old hag!” Ron said in a revolted whisper when Harry reached the part about the wound no longer healing. He clipped up the cloth and tidied up the first-aid items back into the bag. “That’s got to be illegal-”
And he continued like that until his legs ached and his knee throbbed, reaching the number ten for each ingredient three times.  He stopped walking after that, standing still in a small clearing he had never seen before. The trees broke just enough for a ray on sunlight to rain down on the area. He brought up a hand to block the light as he looked up at the sky again, the wind dancing through his hair and clothes unexpectedly. It smelt of rain and earth, but the air felt fresh in his lungs.
"Wretched."
Seeing as he ran there without any of his things, Draco simply returned the book back to its place on the dusty shelf and walked out the room, Mrs. Pince’s gaze on the back of his neck the entire time.
“What’s the matter? Kneazle got your-” Draco started irritably, walking further into the room before his line of sight passed a stone pillar that had been obscuring another girl standing next to Harry. “
-o-o-
At that thought, he poised his quill again to write. He wanted to know how Harry was. What he was doing with those muggle relatives of his. Did he feel lonely? Did his friends write to him?
“W- What?”
"Yes, mother. Goodnight." he said anyway, and left with a quick bow.
"Uh." Draco said, mildly confused. "Yeah. Not forever, though."
Draco sighed at the address at the front, ripping open the envelope. "Got to hide this from my dad."
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, but -”
He snuck through the house and made it outside without meeting anyone on the way. Luckily, the weather was as warm as he'd hoped it was when he saw from inside, and he was glad he'd forgone an outer jumper or coat. A warm wind sifted past him, and the inside of his white cotton shirt cooled with it. He wasn't quite used to such sunlight, and his mother surely wouldn't have approved, but he couldn't see anything bad about it at the moment as it beat down on his skin and fought away the chill he got from the Manor's dark halls. He made his way across the grounds, closing his eyes and turning his head up to the sky. He felt the tip of his nose warming, and his fingertips buzzed as they thawed. He never realised how cold he got inside the Manor because he'd grown so used to it over the years.
"You lot are old enough. Mature. Dumbledore said not to tell you more than you need to know, but…"
"Slytherin?" Harry asked, surprised. Ron nodded mournfully.
“I know what the ritual did.” Draco snarled. “You’re telling me it may have caused a connection? And you’re only following up now?”
But Draco shook his head, "No, I have a feeling it'll be soon. My father's been having guests at home - shady tossers - over the summer. I think they were all also ex-Death Eaters that never got convicted like my father. They've been having meetings at the Manor, but of course, I was never involved and told to lock myself up in my room." He said bitterly. "And remember the World Cup? The Dark Mark in the sky once again isn't a good sign. If his followers are banding together again they must have plans for the Dark Lord's comeback."
Draco stared blankly at the offered hand directed towards him.
I've been writing ahead lately and wanted to be legit and post chapters once a week, but i'm incredibly impatient!!! Here's another chapter and another may be coming soon because i have no self control.
Harry scrunched up his nose, "Yeah. I know." He said, imagining if someone like Crabbe or Pansy knew his weaknesses too.
"This is good." Theo muttered as he looked between their parchments and made adjustments. Draco saw Blaise gesturing out of the corner of his eyes, and side-eyed him.
"Mhm. Caught a look once when my father raised his cane at me and his sleeve rode up."
Harry was relieved to sense a hint of uncertainty, which gave him an idea.
"He will return to his muggle relatives for the summer, where he will be safest."
And he couldn't help but panic just a
"Wow." Harry sat back, running a hand through his hair. "Why did you have to have a go at them, then?"
“Visitors, as in those needing something from Level Four?”
His heart hammered in his chest, and he started flailing around wildly and not bloody knowing what to do. Should he hide? Hide the wand? Run away? No, that was stupid. It would be Second Year all over again. His eyes flew to the window, half expecting a Ministry Owl to be waiting there already with a letter telling him he was expelled. He couldn't be

"Muggle reference." Draco scrunched up his nose at that. "He just asked me to take a bath with it." Potter said, ignoring Draco.
“Doesn’t matter who knows me, if the Prophet’s going to just tell people who I am anyway!” Harry yelled. Mrs. Finnigan didn’t know a damn thing-
, dear Blaise, that I'm keeping my options open for the time being. If there is really a war I don't want to caught dead on the losing side - that'd be terribly embarrassing." He said, inspecting his nails nonchantly.
"I should be asking you that." His face softened and he looked at Harry worriedly.
"Then?" Prompted Hermione.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked, leaning in. Blaise leant back in his chair, crossing his arms over his head.
"We can just discuss this-"
“It’s worse than yesterday.” he heard Ron mutter when he examined Harry’s hand, but other than that, there were no other complaints or objections.
“I don’t care. Now what did you want?”
Ron scoffed, "I wish." He muttered.
A silence fell upon everyone in the room, words escaping them in response to Remus's words.
The two were silently looking at something the wall across the room, shoulders almost touching as they stared at it. Harry and Hermione glanced at each other carefully, then slowly made their way to the two.
Harry caught his breath and laid down the same way he did the day before when he had fallen asleep. He closed his eyes but didn't let himself fall in to oblivion, instead letting the cool night's breeze sift through his hair on the ground.
Before he knew it, the first week of school ended and it was a brisk Saturday morning. The few days before had passed in a flurry of homework, OWLs revision and the letter taking up his mind, which is how he found himself in the Owlery just after dawn broke.
"Does yours hurt too?" Harry asked worriedly, reaching for one of the pieces of the sandwich.
, Ron. Not my fault you inherited your sense of humour from the same place Percy got his."
-o-o-
"I cracked the egg." He said proudly. Malfoy's eyebrows raised and the corners of his mouth twitched. He looked down at his parchment and continued writing.
"Fine." He bit out. "I'm not dropping it, though. Don't think I'll forget." He reprimanded.
"I'm not-"
Warmth flashed in her eyes, and her grip finally loosened. He dropped his arm to his side quickly, resisting the urge to rub the sore area where her fingers dug in. She smiled at him, but it didn't match the upper part of her face where her eyes still looked hesitant, like a caged animal eyeing an open door.
Draco’s first instinct was to refuse, but he knew that then he wouldn't get anything out of the man in front of him. He had a feeling that what he was about to be told was especially significant, and most of all, it was about Harry.
“Got to you? She bloody has! You’re bleeding, Harry. Not just a wound...they’re actual words. It’s sick...It’s-”
"Shut it for a second." Harry snapped, his mind racing and worry creeping in, "They both know you gave me that haircut before the Ball. How am I going to explain this?" Harry waved erratically at his head.
“Not a morning person, then.” Fred joked, chortling with George. The twins started chattering to the people around them, but Harry tuned them out in favour of picking at a stray thread hanging off his robe sleeve. Unfortunately, he was facing away from the Slytherin table and wasn’t going to dare looking behind him, so he couldn’t even catch a glimpse of Draco.
Harry thought hard for a moment. He didn't know why, but he wanted to keep the parts about Draco proposing an exchange of information to himself. He knew both Ron and Hermione would immediately shoot it down and refuse it's continuation. It felt better if it was between him and Draco, for now.
-o-o-
"Are you alright?" Draco gasped. "You look like death."
"Dick." Remus muttered to him from the corner of his mouth, then said louder to Harry. "Sirius hasn't been able to get out as I'm sure the general public wouldn't take well to seeing a wanted fugitive walking around."
Ron sighed as if plagued by the heaviest of burdens, "I've been
-o-o-
Remus froze, face twisted in shock. "You…What?"
"Just for a little while longer, Minerva. We need to know while his memory is fresh."
"It's just…I'm…" Draco went on, not knowing how to explain his apprehension. "Anything could happen tomorrow." He kept his eyes on the Lake.
"That I am." He nodded, his face changing in to something more serious. "I heard what happened…"
"Since when do you get to say
"Sorry. Besides, I don't think she's his
Umbridge nodded dumbly and Harry felt as if he were the teacher and now she was the student. It fulfilled some part deep inside himself that fed on the control. He wondered where it came from...
Umbridge, for the first time that evening, faltered at his sudden shift in mood. Her face shuttered with something indiscernible for a moment, like a brief window of her true feelings, before regaining her same neutral smile.
Draco's mouth opened in surprise, "I'm…sorry - Sir?" His wand hand fell just a little, and his father's eyes darted to it and back to him in surprise.
, but I managed to strike true from luck."
Ron came closer, buttoning up his shirt,  “What’s up?”
the Gryffindor right in front of Blaise. Watching the water go down the drain, Draco finally recalled what happened after he and Potter's truce.
Draco turned to look down at him, “Think about it, Harry. Umbridge investigating my father means she gets suspicious of him. If she gets suspicious of him, she gets suspicious of
And Harry begun to excitedly explain the egg starting to sing underneath the water, how it was probably the voices of merpeople underneath the Lake and reciting what it had said.
As per overall structure, the position
"No." He said, sitting up and feeling self-conscious. As bad as the spells his father sent his way were, none of them were especially malicious or lastingly harmful. They just beat him up enough to put a few bruises on his body, on convenient places like his
"Oh, bugger. Sorry, mate. No idea."
there's also some moderate reactions to PTSD from Harry (mainly just vomiting and anxious thoughts), so please be aware!
"What?" He snapped as politely as he could.
"It's alright, Malfoy." The girl said, "Harry told us you weren't as…fond of your past actions. But you did deserve the punch, by the way." She said with a malicious glint in her eyes. Draco flushed and nodded quickly, looking away. He'd never apologised so much in his life except for that one time to Harry himself. It was both freeing and incredibly uncomfortable because every instinct of pride he'd been brought up with screamed at him to stop.
“If Level Three is for things that aren’t fit for public and open-air consumption,” Draco added as an after-thought, “and Level One is for top-secret research, then what exactly is for Level Two?”
Harry quirked his head, still in a daze. "A woman?"
Harry quickly stopped flipping the wand in the air and placed it obediently next to his on the ground.
"Hermione?" Harry matched her tone, and at the same time they both exclaimed,
Dumbledore lapsed into silence again, his forehead creasing as he slipped into deep thought.
"Er…" Draco cursed himself. He was starting to blubber like Harry. "I can't really say."
“If you were to steal something from someone without them knowing, how would you go about it?” Draco asked casually, clasping his hands over his stomach and staring at the ceiling.
Malfoy listened to Harry with such focus and vigor that Harry didn't need to wonder how he was second in the year to Hermione in terms of grades. Malfoy sat completely still as Harry spoke, the only movement being his grey eyes as they tracked Harry's hands whenever he used them to explain something. They flicked intelligently between Harry's scar, his eyes and his hands occasionally, taking in whatever Harry said with critical analysis in his eyes. Harry could tell the boy was thinking at the same time as listening, letting the information add to whatever sequences of thought he had in his mind. It was similar to the one Hermione had whenever they were in danger over the last three years. It felt unnerving to see it on Malfoy of all people, although he shouldn't have expected it on anyone else.
"Then eat, you daft bugger." Draco said, and added cautiously, "And this way you won't have to go all the way to the Hall for breakfast." Potter looked back at him curiously for a second, then back at the food. "Go on. It won't bite unless you do." Draco said a little more softly. He felt a moment of horror when he found he sounded somewhat like his
"He didn't tell you?" Harry asked incredulously.
"Now I'll have to start again." Harry moaned petulantly, and Draco glared as best he could despite his teary eyes.
Draco brought a hand to ruffle his hair, which was damp and threw droplets of water around carelessly. Harry stood fascinated, as if it never occurred to him that the other boy took baths, or worse, wore pajamas.
anyone, Ron. I just knocked some sense in to him."
Harry placed a hand over his stomach, nodding automatically at Hermione as he tuned out what she started saying.
"Well?" He asked.
"Petunia!" His Uncle yelled, panicked. He let go of Harry quickly and ran out of the room. Harry immediately followed, expecting the Dementor to have returned and gripping his wand tightly in preparation. When he entered Dudley's room, however, he was met with the boy curled up in his mother's arms as she sobbed over him. He was white as a sheet, his skin sheened with sweat and his eyes staring off in to space.
“It is!” Lancaster cried, and Merlin help them all, his eyes started to look especially glassy. He collapsed his face into his hands, sniffling.
Just then, he saw Potter slam his hands on his table and rise up, leaving Granger and Weasley behind in a huff. Draco's heart sped. This was his chance. Dropping his croissant, he pretended to look through his book bag and not find something, tracking Potter walk out the Hall through his eyelashes. When the boy disappeared, Draco got up, muttering an irritated "Forgot my…" and started to walk out as well. Whether he felt two pairs of eyes on him as he left, he didn't bother to think about.
"Erm," Harry started, "I don't want the others to hear…and I wasn't sure how you would…"
, aren’t they?”
"Correct. Will you be alright without those extra Potions lessons, though?"
Harry gave Ron and Hermione one more crushing hug right before the Third Task begun.
He watched Potter get welcomed in to Gryffindor by the Weasley's and his other Housemates, and he felt a spike of something in his gut that made his skin feel like it was on fire. How
Harry's head quirked. "Erm, how'd you know?"
"Fine." Draco said resignedly, face indifferent and eyes closed off. "Just go." He turned away from Harry, and it only made him angrier that he was being brushed off so easily.
"-foy. Yes, I remember you from my class. You're quite talented at the Dark Arts, hm?"
“Yes.” Harry said.
Blaise didn't say anything about the whole ordeal after that, although things between them had changed. To Draco's surprise, he didn't tell anyone or use Draco's moment of weakness to exploit him. When Draco outrightly asked why, Blaise shrugged and evaded the question wholly.
"Draco!" Hermione exclaimed, scandalised, to which Draco turned from the book to smile cheekily at her.
Nearing the Great Hall with Ron in tow, Harry's self-resentment was at an all time high.
"Good man." Ron said cheerfully, slapping him on the back.
"-I know! But now we have to solve his issue with Draco. How many people do you think-"
Draco shook his head violently like a petulant child. Merlin, Pansy had no idea how bloody
a voice hissed. The lamps lining the corridor flashed from amber to green, bathing everything in a sickly tint.
-o-o-
"Well
Draco preened internally, smiling. "You two aren't very covert unless you're someone like Harry or Ronald."
“Morning, Harry.” Hermione greeted when they got to the Gryffindor Table. She glanced at Ron and the boy stiffened for a moment before she added appraisingly, “Ron.” It seemed that she was still slightly vexed at him for the day earlier. Ron deflated, and he sat down next to Harry so they were both facing her.
. He held out his hand to the boy, too nervous to notice Malfoy's wince as he clasped on to Harry's. General applause indicating they should head out ensued, and Harry took the lead, striding out and barely hearing the gasps that came from the crowd because of all the blood rushing in his ears.
"Where've you been?" Ron asked Remus.
"And you…It's like…there's no expectations, you know? We both don't like each other, so there's nothing to either impress or disappoint. I could say right now that I haven't done my Transfigurations essay due for today, and what would you say?"
conversations of ours."
, before you decide to raid my stores for Boomslang Skin and the precious
The Phoenix began to shiver slightly, its red feathers fading into grey and now falling in even quicker successions. Its skin was sunken and its bones were collapsing into itself as if it would simply disappear into thin air.
"So they would have the Mark?"
"Hey- Merlin you're taller." Blaise greeted him, and they shook each other's hand casually.
Draco sagged. He'd been hoping Blaise knew something, the boy being scarily good at knowing anything about anyone. It wasn't just gossip, but pure facts. It might have been some sort of wicked gene passed on from his mother, or the biological father that was long gone by then. Blaise just had a knack for knowing everybody's business, not unlike Pansy but much more reliable than the barmy she talked about.
"Dolores Umbridge." He muttered distastefully. "Of all people."
“Brilliant,” Draco remarked, settling his chin on his hand. “So these guidebooks are at every level?”
“Correct me if I’m wrong,” Blaise greeted Draco over breakfast the next morning, “but I vaguely remember a blonde-headed creature waking me up in the dead of night to ask me about my mother’s new husband’s postal address.”
Harry laid on his side the look through the window, where a small star was shining in the distant sky. He wondered about many things at once, cradling his bandaged hand to his chest. The star made him think of Sirius, then because of Sirius he thought of Remus. He wondered where they were and if they were alright.
Harry shook himself and begun to recite the words Draco had told him to say a few minutes earlier with a shaky voice. "Will you, Draco Malfoy, vow to never willingly betray information to Voldemort, his followers or anyone else that may mean harm that could be sensitive and-or crucial in acting against me, Dumbledore or any of our allies?"
