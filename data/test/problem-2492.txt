“I want to destroy my old wand. You have it right?”
Blaise took a sip of his tea and waited. Harry took a deep breath.
“I think you would make a great teacher, Harry,” Antoine said. “You have a nicely screwed moral compass.”
“It seems to me you’re pretty set on doing it,” Harry said.
“Isn’t that a huge risk?” Harry asked Blaise.
“Sometimes I wonder about the people you know,” Draco teased.
“Because it’s my fault?” Draco asked.
“Nice. I showered and everything and you’re being,” he waved his hand. “You. I guess.”
Draco shook his head.
Harry blinked at him. “What?”
Draco sighed and pushed Harry away gently. “You have five minutes so use them wisely, once they’re up I’m going to suck your cock, Potter.”
“I asked him how it happened and he said I should ask you.”
“That would be fine too? I guess?“ Harry said. It was kind of a question, growing up in the Wizarding world he had never come across anyone who was anything other than straight. Granted he hadn’t had that much time to be a real kid and explore his surroundings because since his first year at Hogwarts he had been fighting for his life and trying to save the entire wizarding world. Wouldn’t he somehow had known if one of the people close to him had been queer?
“The look on your face when you realized what that spell did. I remember that, Potter. You didn’t mean it.”
Draco would sit down with Luna next week to get the interview done and then there would be nothing for them to do. He wanted to steal Draco away for a vacation and make the wait until the news broke more pleasant.
Blaise grabbed his arm. “I don’t say, don’t think about it, I don’t say, don’t be angry about it, I’m just saying this could be an opportunity or a second chance Draco and we need to take it, grab it with our fists and not let go.“
“How would you know that it’s going to be mediocre?” Draco asked.
Draco's mind shied away from the rest. It had been a surprise, alright. Being a sacrificial virgin had not been on his agenda, but by the time he listened to the knot in his stomach telling him something just wasn’t right, they were in the woods already. He had felt drunk on—something, something that Joel had slipped him, no doubt. He had laughed when he saw the people in white robes and the torches and the—knives.
“I’ve been in communications nearly the whole time you were in your study with the Ministry and my superior,” Potter said. “Someone fucked up and they’re going to find out who, but not now,  because we have bigger fish to fry.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said. “I thought it had been for the best, when I did this to you, I thought it would’ve made things easier.”
For a second it looked like Potter was about to grab his wrist and do – something but then he looked from the Mark to Draco's face. His green eyes were earnest, sincere, fierce even. “I won't let you die,” he said.
“Harry,” Blaise said with a grin.
The dark little owl flew inside and landed on Draco’s nightstand. Draco sat up and untied the note from the bird’s leg.
Draco obliged happily. When he pulled away, Harry was breathing hard and his hair was a mess, because Draco had carded his fingers through it, had pulled and pushed, so their mouths aligned perfectly. Harry had let him. Draco had found out pretty fast that Harry was totally fine for Draco to take the lead. It was a strange and heady feeling.
“Pardoned war criminal, but you are also Harry Potter’s boyfriend,” Pansy finished.
Draco closed his eyes. “It doesn’t mean anything.”
“It doesn’t really matter, Draco. I need this.”
Draco looked up from the paper and smirked. “Sex hangover?”
Draco wandered to the kitchen and Accioed breads, butter, cheese, and an apple (Aster liked munching on the slices). "When are the boys picking her up?"
Harry waved his hand. "It's fine. I don't mind. I've put my life on the line before, doing it with my career is no big deal."
"Yes. He thinks that with my notoriety and their organisation, we could make quite a splash in the news. What do you think?"
A warm hand fell on Harry's shoulder; he jumped. Draco. Draco had stepped forward, standing directly behind him. No doubt this hand-on-shoulder thing was meant to tell Harry to calm the fuck down.
"Okay, wait, fuck." Harry waved his wand to Conjure a sheet of paper and a biro. "We need to come up with a plan. I keep asking people at work to figure out what the DMLE can do to mitigate this foreign magic thing, and all they keep doing is scheduling more and more meetings.  I don't fucking trust anyone else to actually get anything done, so it's you and me." He picked up the biro, pulled the cap off, and started chewing it. "Where should we start?"
Draco ran his hand through his already disheveled hair, leaning further onto his elbows. He jumped slightly as a hand came to rest on his arm.
"It's okay." Draco reassured him. "You don't have to tell me, love. Would you be able to tell me where we are, perhaps?"
"Um, thank you, Potter."
"Hm, so it is."
Draco sighed in frustration as he looked out the window. His plane had been delayed almost an hour and a half and the trip there had to be slowed majorly due to a storm. He was lucky if he would even make it to Hunulaya in time for his first show. Or hell, even his second show. Half an hour later, the pilot thanked everyone for their patience and for joining the flight.
"Do you know what your going to do when you leave here?" Draco asked him softly, as if if he spoke too loudly the peace would shatter.
Malfoy looked at Harry with an bashful smile, "You excited?"
"You always seem to have to focus. I remember in school you were always so focus on a very particular black haired-"
"Are they down there?" He asked. In answer, the cat tilted his head towards the steps before descending.
Hermione looked towards the boy, eyes stuck between being angry and disappointed. Her eyes ran in between her best friend and the human she despised the most, besides Voldemort and Bellatrix.
"Look, Draco," She said as her eyes danced around the room, avoiding Draco's eyes. "It's nothing truly. Personal stuff, nothing to do with the case."
"What was it?" Harry asked gently.
- Corporation of Dangerous and Endangered Creatures; where he gets to save and protect a variety of different creatures who the Ministry deem unworthy. At least that's who he treated at first, through the years the corporation grew nearly as large as the Ministry's of Magical Creatures Department. Nowadays, the ministry would send the too dangerous or hard to crack cases to the
Malfoy, along with the rest of the class turned towards Harry.
Draco swallows thickly, looking over at Harry before returning his eyes to the man.
As the drums become a softer beat, he strummed his guitar lightly,
Harry thought back to the girl. If he was being honest, he was so shocked of seeing a blue-haired Malfoy walking into Hogwarts to notice anything else. He remembered her hair and how she talked expressively to Malfoy, but the memory stops there.
Draco nodded in acknowledgment, quickly throwing out unlocking and counter-spells and charms. Cursing softly, Draco faced the other four, "I'm going to do an incantation that should allow me access, I need two of you to grab the door as soon as it begins falling, the other two keep your wands trained on the room in case he is ready to attack. After the door is off I'm sliding in and I need you block off the hole so nothing can escape. Clear?"
come from? Yes, him and Draco have been very.. friendly / non-friendly lately but a few snuggles and kisses that weren't even on the lips doesn't mean you are dating, right?
"8 o'clock." Harry smiled and thanked her for her help, payed for the pie and coffee, and headed out. He decided he didn't get enough walking down earlier, so he started walking along the shore line, until he checked his phone, realizing it was already ten to 7, and he turned back around, heading for his hotel.
Harry and Draco turned towards the voice spotting Hampton behind them.
Draco shrugged his shoulder, clutching his cup harder. "Around five... maybe six? I'm not sure really. He was young.. and so bloody scared."
The rest of the day went by much faster than the first half. He even settled his nerves enough to eat a whole sandwich. Hermione insisted on walking with him down to the hospital wing, wanting to be there for him in case it was bad news. Or in case they decide Harry can't see Draco and she would have to intervene so he doesn't hurt any professors.
Harry smiled softly, "Give her lots of kisses for me."
Pansy lead Draco back to the floo, hugged him tightly, and then Draco was off.
"I miss when you were stumbling over your words and turning red."
all of his classes.
He turned around and trudge back up to the castle, anxious to get the next set of classes over with.
the one that suggested we be civil?"
As Harry got closer to the stage that he refuses to look at, his throat closed tighter and tighter.
anything other than the boy standing in front of him. He felt as if his whole being was meant to be wrapped around the soft warmth that this beautiful creature staring back at him has constantly provided him with for days on end. He wasn't sure how long they stood staring but when Malfo- no,
conversation, before this one.
"Having trouble there, Potter?"
Harry grabbed his shoulders, leaning in until Draco can smell the alcohol on the other boy, "You
learn something about potions."
Hampton gave him a look that clearly stated that he didn't believe him but let Harry pass by anyways.
He looked between the boy and his hand for several seconds as flashbacks to his first day at Hogwarts flooded his mind. After a beat, he decided to take it, also deciding to ignore the shock he felt ripple on his palm from the short-lived contact.
Both Maybelle and David laid floating in the middle of the room on a cloud of almost-translucent grey that flowed underneath their bodies in a misty haze.
They ended the call as Harry was entering the elevator. Not seeing Draco around in the lobby, Harry headed outside.
Draco shrugged and leaned back into his chair, "Yes, I believe that is what I said. Try."
Hampton sighed, “I’m sorry, I don’t know.”
They all began unpacking their bags in silence, most of them lost in the reality that they are back at Hogwarts, a place none of them thought they would ever see again. When all of Harry's things were put away, he sat down on the edge of his bed with his feet propped up on his trunk and looked at the other occupants that were now cracking jokes with each other. His stomach rumbled aloud, frightening him and the other students in the room.
"Then I don't see the problem here."
Harry and Draco shared a quick glance.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco read the plaque over and over. His breathing had become easier but he was slowly getting light headed from the pure magic still flowing around him. He backed away from the tree and quickly walked away from the park. The second he stepped away from the intoxicating magic the second he felt an unadulterated amount of longing.
"Has anything weird happened to while you have been here? Have you felt any pull or something like.. like.." He leaned closer, "Like magic?"
The two Slytherins turned towards him.
Hey guys! I didn't introduce myself in the first chapter so I decided to add as an end note here. My name is Maddie and I am a little obsessed with Harry Potter - more specifically Drarry. I have been reading HP fanfiction for years and so I decided to give it ago to write my own! This is the first book I have written on this website so if there is technical errors I'm sorry! I'm still learning! If you see any errors through out or any contraindications let me know! I reread my stories about seven times before I publish a chapter but I always find I miss a thing or two. I'm also not a musician and I'm not the best at writing lyrics so don't judge the lyrics too harshly.. The story does begin around two and a half years after the war, which is why in some places it may say two years and some say three. I hope you guys have enjoyed so far! Thank you for reading!
Draco thoughtfully chewed on his straw. After a few moments he asked the question that has been nagging on his brain all day.
that claws at me and every-time we get close it fights harder and I don't know if I can control it.." Harry stomped over to Draco, the Slytherin threw himself against the wall, "Harry, what ever you are doing stop."
George closed his eyes as the memories stormed his mind for a moment before he jerked back, "Don't use that shit on me."
Harry smirked as he followed his roommate out into the hallway, "Hell no, knowing you you would probably lead me to a hidden room with fake food that was laced with poison."
To muggles, Draco Malfoy was just a boy. A boy with a dream of writing and performing.
to focus on.
"Not hate each other?" He spoke through his teeth, "Do you realize what you put me through? What you put my friends through?"
He laid awake, staring at the top of his canopy for a long while, thinking over what exactly might happen if he and Malfoy actually hung out this weekend. Turning over to face the bed he knew held the strange boy, he prayed that what ever happens wouldn't ruin this small truce and acquaintanceship that the boys have fallen in to since the start of term.
"Wanna do something when we go?"
The panther stared him down for a moment more before huffing and walking into the bushes, the blue light following him. Draco hummed as he trailed along behind the strange cat.
"Pretty Snazzy." He heard a voice behind him say. The said person walked past Harry, his blue hair shining in the brightly lit room.
"Maybe, but at least it would be a pleasureful death."
At least it was a new nightmare, Harry thought. The old ones were getting tiring.
Harry turned his head up and glanced at the blanket-giver.
Harry stood up straight as Malfoy leaned in closer to him, close enough that he wasn't even fuzzy to Harry anymore, almost trapping the raven haired boy against the sink, with not only his body but with the
"Yeah, ha-ha, so funny." Draco responded to the look. He glanced behind the cat and froze at the sight that laid before him.
Hampton grabbed Harry's hand, "Some friends of mine have a table in the middle. Would you be okay sitting with them?"
Hermione wrapped her arms around herself, "I still don't know about this, Harry."
!” Harry screamed, sobbing even harder as Draco’s eyes flew open.
"Of course it is! It makes a heist so much more fun and easy."
They sat in a tense silence out by the big oak tree. The tree where he and Draco had their first
They didn't do a very good job at hiding their disappointment when Slughorn pressed his lips together, muttering
at Harry, it makes Harry want to shake the blue-haired boy and scream until his lungs give out.
"Harry!"
Draco chuckled lightly, placing his guitar on the floor and grabbing Harry's hips, "Yikes. I would be careful doing that, don't want to strain that cute head of yours too hard."
He began drinking, to get his mind off of things. He was never a big drinker, he still really isn't unless he is under a lot of stress, but the weeks leading up to this 'vacation' he began drinking more heavily. He didn't tell any one about his drinking, he didn't want to worry them. Hermione and the Weasleys' are constantly in a fuss about him; if they knew of the drinking, he was sure he would never hear the end of it. They would do anything they could to make sure his alcohol intake was measured. The night he decided to come to this island, he felt himself slipping deeper into his hole he was already laying in. He felt stuck, like there was no way out besides mentally being somewhere else. He couldn't go into town, there was too many people, he couldn't bare the thought of going to his friends' houses, all they did was constantly worry and nag on him. He couldn't go any wheres in the magical world, the place he loved so dearly. He felt trapped and broken, and the walls were closing in on him quickly.
"No." Harry cut off the Headmistress, "I'm.. I'm sorry but no. I'm not leaving. Please, I can't leave.. Please tell me he is okay."
Harry pulled himself higher on the bed to be face to face with Draco, leaving only an inch between them. He ran his finger around Draco's soft, yet chiseled jawline, then moved up to his chin.
Harry refused to look up at the boy.
Draco's breathing hitched as Harry's hands as well as his eyes searched Draco's features. Harry's face was so close Draco could make out the light freckles that were sprinkled across the man's cheeks and forehead. He wanted to do his own searches on the chosen one but didn't dare move. He realized as he sat here, pushed against a bar's exit door on a tiny island with the person he thought he would never get see again, that this moment was as precious and delicate as the man he was sharing the moment with.
Pansy threw her own straw wrapper at her boyfriend. "Oh hush you. You wouldn't get into so much trouble if you would learn to behave yourself." She said, exasperated.
Malfoy pulled his bottom lip with his teeth, "That's so odd. He always was so secretive about that book.. It was like his prize possession. I only ever got to glance through it once when he accidentally left it on his desk. Why would it be in Slughorn's collection of textbooks?"
Malfoy smiled softly, eyes bright. "That's okay.." He looked at Harry with curiosity before turning back to the essay, "I was saying that Golpalott's Third Law is simply saying that a true antidote to a blended poison is more than the sum of its parts. Instead of thinking of the blended poison as a mixture of poisons, see it as it's own unique poison that just simply has a lot of ingredients put into it."
Harry stood right outside the door leading to the courtyard. The past two days, Harry spent much of his free time with Malfoy or studying with Hermione. He found himself genuinely enjoying the sarcastic, blue-haired boy's company. He constantly was making jokes, replying to Harry with sarcasm every chance he got, and picking on Harry quite often - mainly his hair, his no sense of style, and potions work- which Harry didn't really mind when it was said without the old sneer that used to accompany the remarks. Harry was also becoming obsessed and a little more than curious of the weird sensations he has continued to get around the boy. Even just being in the boy's
Harry cast his eyes down to Malfoy's chest. "Yeah. I'm so sorry that that happened. I didn't know what it did. If I had known-"
for him."
off of the use of children from the beginning and as we all got old enough to make our 'destinies' reality, the adults threw us into the shark infested waters while being drenched in blood. And the only advice they could give was to simply swim fast."
"You don't always have a choice, Potter."
Pansy's eyes continued throwing daggers at Harry's, "No, but I can hurt him real good."
She laughed, "Touchy, touchy. I'm just trying to remind you that you are on an island with someone you have wanted for years. Take the risk. It's not like you are going to be stuck there with him forever."
"One day, Malfoy," Ron said as he and Neville got closer, "You are going to kiss a girl's cheek and her boyfriend is going to beat you for it."
When he looked back Harry looked confused, "What was that?"
Fleur nodded, "Yes, Draco's situation is extremely rare. Not only him being male, but also him being the first nearly full-blooded Veela to surface in many years."
"Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe? Who would've thought."
"Of course."
McGonagal, Harry thought, had a very good point about Inter-House Unity.
Hampton placed a hand on Georges arm, pushing memories of warm summers and times spent out in the water into his cousin's mind.
Slughorn turned, both eyebrows raised, "If you want all of your marks you best drink the potion. I know you are not allergic to any of the ingredients, we have used them all before."
All the women took in a breath.
Harry rolled his eyes as they came to the door, "Wait for me."
Slughorn hummed his approval as he walked pass them, only looking just a little bit upset that they did it correctly. After Slughorn found out about the book Harry was using during sixth year, he instantly took a dislike to him. He also didn't care too much for the Malfoy heir, either, because, well, he is the Malfoy heir.
Late afternoon found the boys back at the beach. They had spent majority of the afternoon out in the water, but as the sun descended they made their way to the shore to relax and dry off.
He repeated the incantation three times before the door slowly fell off it's hinges. Thomas and George grabbed the door quickly and without a second thought, Draco slipped in-between the door and the wall.
Harry reached out and grabbed one of Draco's hands that were tucked against his side. The hand felt cold, but still gave tiny shocks to Harry's arm.
"Good morning, Sunshine." Draco said with a bright smile.
Hampton looked at him with eyes that could probably get even the ministry to spill it's secrets.
The man smiled as Harry set the box down, "Well, well I have only been here for 74 years. But my family has been here for centuries. We was one of the first families to step foot in here Hunulaya. My whole family has been here ever since. That'll be 25 buckeroos, kid."
Harry held onto the sheets of his bed, if only to control his bubbling temper.
They ran down the hall to the panther's room, employees throwing themselves against the walls to avoid being ran into. Upon arrival Draco found Alice Goodmen, a practice Mediwitch, along with George Fall and Beck Thompson, both from the Restraint Division standing in front of the panther's entry door.
When each person nodded, he turned back towards the door.
"You have been avoiding me and I'd like to know why."
Hampton laughed softly, "I was just saying how he is performing tomorrow night as well. I was curious if you would want to maybe come with me?" Hampton looked down at his hands as a blush began its way onto his face.
Hampton shrugged, cutting Harry off, "You don't have to explain. I understand. Besides, it seemed to work out pretty good for you. You two look.. happy together."
Even though the words weren't exactly a compliment, more of a statement, Harry still felt himself blushing up at Malfoy. As he glanced at Malfoy's own eyes, Harry was enraptured. Now that he was so much closer, Harry could see that they weren't just grey they were almost silver with dark specks throughout. The boy's pupils covered more than half his iris they were so large. Harry found himself leaning in closer. Neither of them were touching the other but Harry still felt the electric sparks run around his body, the warmth now an uncomfortable heat lapping at his insides. Harry's eyes ran across Malfoy's face, landing on the boy's thin lips. Harry gazed at them, wondering what it would be like to touch them, to kiss them, to run a tongue-
Draco dropped his guitar on the bench behind him, "A ritual? What kind of ritual?"
Draco groaned extracting himself from Harry, but kept his hand clutched tightly in his own, "We have got to go see a doctor about this. It's sounds very serious."
Hampton's eyes were fearful as he looked into the younger boy's eyes, "I'm sorry, but it's all I can do. I am risking my neck just telling you the little that I know. But believe me or not, Harry, I enjoyed my time with you. You are a good kid. You are good."
His heart dropped at the blood that was pooling at Draco's mouth.
"Yes," Harry stated as he shook his hair, "But if I go underwater, you wont get the satisfaction of splashing me."
As Draco thought about the past few years, strolling down a sidewalk on the way to the Central Park, he couldn't help but feel extremely proud of where he has been and where he has gone. He hasn't forgotten the past or that world but he no longer is letting it hold him back. He still has the nightmares, yes, but he has normal, happy dreams too now, something he hasn't had since he was a child. He occasionally dreams of darkness and the Dark Lord. Dreams of him returning once again to finish his killings, his plans, but he mainly dreams of standing on a stage, guitar in hand, crowd screaming out in celebration. He dreams of fields of flowers, sunshine, and loved ones. He dreams of a time where his parents where
Mrs. Mellow spoke up, "Because Hampton, some of us may harbor gifts but not at the level that our ancestors did. With centuries without proper practice, we simply aren't strong enough. Not even if we used all of our strength and worked together. It just isn't possible."
"Smart idea," He murmured to himself. "Let's fall asleep next to an insane magical panther."
Draco's face suddenly broke into a smile, "I have to say, Potter, that was a pretty good try."
The panther was no longer growling at him, instead he was staring at Draco like he was the dumbest creature alive. Which, frankly, wouldn't be too far from the truth seeing as he stood making jokes while being trapped in an enchanted room that currently housed a mysteriously magical large black panther who may or may not have killed two employee of the
The women across the counter smiled, "It would be a pleasure for us to have you living here."
Harry grabbed Draco’s hand, ”What? Draco what?”
Draco chuckled softly, "As much as I would love to cuddle with you, we do need to get up. I have that performance tonight, remember?"
So I realized after last chapter that the boys aren't technically old enough to buy alcohol on american land (They are 20-ish, age limit is 21 in america) but we are just going to ignore that and pretend they are old enough. Sounds good? Great! I hope all of you are enjoying the book! Thank you so much for reading! I can't wait till you see what all is in store for our boys! Also big shout-out to @CherylMercury thank you so all of the comments! They are very appreciated! xx
wouldn't stop ringing in his ears.
Once he extracted the boy, he stood up and headed to the phone. He turned it off and turned back to the bed. Harry had scooted over to where Draco had been laying and was gripping the sheets tightly. Draco hated to wake him, but they needed to be dressed and out the door in fifteen minutes. He contemplated on how he was going to wake Harry up for several seconds. There were many options- some dirtier than others- he could choose from. He laid down on the bed, finally deciding that a little shake would be the safest. That was the plan, until he got closer to Harry. Seeing the cutest face Draco has ever seen snuggled up against his blankets, made Draco change the plan completely.
I turn, eyes wide. Potter hasn't left. Why hasn't Potter left? "Go!" I shriek.
Draco contemplates making eggnog, for something holiday-themed to fill his time (because he will not do one bit more work until January, as a matter of principle!), but truthfully he doesn’t even like eggnog. He suspects he may be nutmeg intolerant, though he hasn’t voiced that suspicion. James will never let him hear the end of it if he adds another food to the list of things he cannot eat. (Last month, James taught Tonks, only six years old, to ask Draco, ‘Grandfather, can you eat this?’ every time Draco tried to eat anything.)
"I've never fucked a grandfather before," Harry said, flopping back onto his elbows. "At least. I don't think I have."
We stop talking. Maybe complaining isn't a very constructive idea.
Draco was suddenly very, very mad.
, no objections," Harry whispered, fingers reaching for Draco's hair.
“Well of course not, but the institution can go fuck itself,” Draco said with a mouthful of foam, spitting into the sink and rinsing his mouth. “I meant if it was about proper selection of a lifelong romantic partner.”
was of consequence. Harry hadn't felt that way too many times in his life, outside parenthood.
"We had sex," Harry blurts.
The minutes fade in a haze of dancing; "Tubthumping" comes on, and Hermione starts punching the air while screaming, "I get knocked down, but I get up again!" Harry laughs, happy to lose his worries to this sight, wishing Ron were here. Someone bumps up against Malfoy and suddenly Malfoy is pressed up against Harry's back while Harry sings, "Pissing the night awayyyyyy!" That's weird, and Harry isn't sure if maybe he should turn around, but then their faces would be very close together, so maybe this is better.
“Differently, how?” Malfoy asked.
As he was reeling from this, the door to the bedroom burst open and Draco's body went rigid as he was awoken.
a solicitor, or have I missed something?"
“That’s true,” Harry said, grinning. “What about your beard?”
"Yes, that reminds me," Draco said, half standing and peering around the room. "Where's my bag? I need you to sign the papers that will add you to the deed."
I look around. The magic that Potter has manifested in the form of a chain is in the far right corner of the dungeon, visible from the door, but to the side. We've arranged the bodies across from the door.
Harry sat, happy for a cup of coffee, as he hadn't had a chance to go to Azure Cup before Teddy arrived. A pretty blue cup flew through the air, landing on the table in front of him, and Harry grabbed the pitcher of cream from the centre of the table and poured some in.
"I'm going to rest it on the mantel for now," Harry says. "Pride of place. You can hang it somewhere else, if you like." Harry perches the outlandish "art" on the mantel, and steps back to admire it.
Harry leaned his hip against the counter. "I just don't understand
Draco was flooded with an image of Snape superimposed on that musical group Albus and Scorpius had liked when they were tweens, the one that sang about the black parade, but surrounded by fields of herbs and community farming. He shook his head. "Er, great. I think that would be one of the last things you'll do."
they tell me that I have to wear it so that I can look like their idea of what it means to be a woman!”
One eyebrow rose in disdain. "Did you just call me
"You're the head of the party," Harry said, attaching his lips to Draco's neck, "you can do anything."
Harry walks over to the sofa and flops onto his back. He's not expecting Draco to flop on top of him, his pointy nose pressing into Harry's collarbone.
the same as your age, so if my knowledge is 'old,' so too are—"
Harry’s heart beat erratically. They were so close. Draco had a tiny freckle on the corner of his eye, and Harry could see straight up the skirt to Draco’s pants. Harry wasn’t even sure it counted as
Harry shooed him through the Floo, heart constricting when the sounds of Aster's cries reached their ears through the connection.
“The most attractive is just, whatever day it is,” Draco says, feeling like a ridiculous sop but knowing it’s true. “You sitting at the table texting James in your Christmas joggers eating the high-protein breakfast I made even though I know you’d rather have toast. That’s how you’re most attractive.”
to anyone who ever told him what to do with his life and/or with his mouth. And he doesn't care because Malfoy
"I would
"Fine," I sigh. "Don't tell me. So what do we do now? We've got magic, but we can't use it."
“Up until about six months ago, Malfoy, my wildest dream was that the  war would end and everyone I love would still be alive,” Harry said, suddenly exhausted. “It didn’t happen, though truthfully, we came a lot closer than I thought we would.”
“Welcome! This workshop is not going to be for discussing personal issues—it’s not like group therapy. It’s for learning specific techniques to help deal with depression. We’ll continue discussing personal issues and dealing with your trauma in your individual sessions. But the first thing I want to establish here is trust.”
Harry blanched. "We have to tell Scorpius about nullifying the vow? Which means we have to tell Scorpius and Albus? Which means we have to tell Scorpius, Albus, James, Lily, and Teddy?"
Harry glanced at Draco, and the fear and worry coursing through Draco were reflected back in Harry's eyes. They walked into the bizarre atmosphere of the room and sat on the sofa opposite their children. Albus made to take Aster from Harry, but Harry held her closer and flashed a look in his eyes like
"You realise you traded your life for a
a treat. Anyway so, Rump won."
this, or something like it, at least.
I hope everyone is doing alright one year into this panorama. Things are good in my house—for some reason one of my kids has taken to following everything up with, "Everything is awful in this cruel, cruel world." So that's added a fun vibe to the house.
"Ron, your wife is being mean," Harry whined.
Draco walked around the sofa, standing behind Harry, and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Harry wondered if it was for show, a performance of what a loving husband would do.
kissing, because they were drunk and it was a stag do and their children were conniving foxes, and what choice did they really have? But fuck it was hot in this room, and Draco tugged him closer, their chests and hips bumping together, and all Harry could think was
"Personal. Genital. Business."
"No!" Harry said, punctuating the point with his finger. "It's Lily's fault! I've sired a monster!"
They both turned to look at their goblin companion.
"Draco," Harry started, then stopped. "Don't you—I mean, aren't you worried that
"But—it's your house. This house probably costs, what?" Harry stood and spun around inspecting the moulding. "Six or seven million pounds? What's that in Galleons, like two million? You can't just
you're going to leave? As far as I'm concerned, now that we've talked about it, you can fuck me to forget your problems. I don't mind the whole angry-man thing—"
It wasn't the touch he minded; Draco felt warm and Harry always appreciated the cosy press of another person. (He was pretty sure he'd smothered Ginny while sleeping in the same bed as her. She'd diagnosed him as being "touch starved," which, sure, but it wasn't like Harry could particularly
"Nah," she says, resting her cheek atop Harry's head. He's enveloped in the smell of her hair. "It makes a bit of sense, actually."
"Draco," Harry said. "What are you doing here? I thought we would meet at Azure Cup."
“Well,” Draco said, leaning on the poshness of his voice, “I suppose that’s today’s enactment of newlywed behaviour ticked off the list.”
Harry nodded. This conversation would be easier with the pretence of sport.
Harry raised his shoe. It was…true enough. He'd brought it up. Although it had been Draco's idea, hadn't it? He lifted Draco's, too, and everyone in the room started laughing.
"I'm not! I—"
Ron threw his hands up placatingly. “Okay, okay, let’s think about this strategically.”
it was exciting. He knew what to expect, but he didn't. Like ordering a cake, but every component was an unusual flavour.
I deflate a bit. "I don't know, Potter."
Harry put his glasses and his wand on the side table.
about!?" Harry's voice sounds unhinged. "How about the fact that we made a

ready. It'll be fine. It's just our kids."
Draco yelped as Aster attempted to latch through his shirt. "This is linen, little miss!" He guided her head away and stuck his finger in her mouth for her to chomp. "Can you get the bottle ready?"
On the first night of the year, Hermione had Transfigured the two beds into one enormous bed, and since then, Hermione and Ron would fall asleep each night wrapped up in each other with Harry, who slept on the other side of the bed, an arm’s distance away. When they were awake and not at lessons, they covered the bed with books as they studied, napped, and ate biscuits they hoarded from the Great Hall. By the end of each day the duvet was covered with crumbs and ink stains, and once, a melted Cadbury Flake.
Harry's learned that there are lots of international students at RAMag. People come from all over Europe, and other continents as well. Because so many magical people go into the workplace or apprenticeships straight out of school, the number seeking magical higher education is substantially lower than it is in the Muggle world—so it makes sense that there are fewer programmes that each draw students from a wider geographical area. The faculty is international too, for all the same reasons.
"You're so cute." Harry smiles weakly, watching Teddy's neon pink hair. The hair reminds him of Tonks, so he refuses to think about that, because thinking about that would mean breaking down crying.
"Do you think we'd tell you if it wasn't?" Draco asked, tugging his hand that was still clasped with Harry's farther onto his lap.
What the fuck.
"We're adults," Harry repeated. "Would you like to sit and have coffee with me?"
," she corrects. She pulls away and looks around, worrying her lip between her teeth. "Our flat—it's not like when we were living in the tent, is it?"
“And it seems worth pointing out,” Ron added, “that everyone here seems to be complying with the dress code. Is it really that bad if we’re already meeting it?”
Draco's face turned serious. "That's true. But someone else could argue the case."
"I don't know, Dad," she said. "I guess I just need to figure out how it is I look at him.
Draco cocked his head, staring at Harry for a long moment in which Harry was almost convinced he'd said something silly. "That's it!" Draco grinned. "Paint myself as reluctantly tapped for duty!"
Draco sighed as if put upon, though he was glad no one was around to see the smile he couldn't seem to keep off his face.
When he's gathering up his notebook and pen, it's the most natural thing in the world to ask Draco if he wants to come back to Harry's for dinner. And it seems natural, too, for Draco to barely even answer in the affirmative as he follows Harry out, because he's launching into a rant about how the O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s don't prepare students for the real world.
"The last few things" were apparently enough to fill another seven magically expanded trunks.
Harry shrugged. What did that even mean? “You mean because I’m not helping? Or like, existentially?”
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know that," Harry snapped back. "Pain in the arse when I'm trying to be—like with Snape—and when I'm just trying to be nice, too, apparently."
“Does she think we’re a couple?” Draco asks, outraged.
It's too hard to even think about, much less talk about it with Hermione. If Harry talks about it with Hermione, they'll both end up sobbing on the floor. If he's ever in the mood for sobbing on the floor, he'll tell her. He thinks she'd be a receptive audience for parents-don't-want-me angst, ever since she returned from Australia.
"Yes, Granger, that seems likely."
. Draco had committed to being unmovable in this conversation. He would
Nico looked down at the table. "Hi Mr Malfoy. I was wondering—" He paused, clearly full of anxiety. "Er, well, I'm thinking of going to law school."
She shakes her head, reaching a hand up to wipe one eye and walking determinedly towards her bedroom. "It's okay, Harry. I just need to be alone for a minute."
Harry grinned and waved his wand. NSYNC's "Home for Christmas" wafted through the house.
It doesn't seem to have worked. He fumbles with his keys, wishing for the comfort of his bed even though it's three o'clock in the afternoon. A reasonable time for a nap, really. He gets the door open, then stops short.
all the time. There must have been a reason why he didn't allow himself to do what he wanted, to roll closer in bed. But now he couldn't remember why. Not with Draco, flushed with happiness, dropping his gaze to Harry's lips.
"I picked him up at a bar."
saying is that I believe we can make it work even though we've been…less than honest up until now."
Jorgen leaned forward conspiratorially. "For everything."
It was like play-acting his ideal life while knowing it was fake, but Harry couldn't quite find it in him to care because he and Draco were getting married and their families and friends were
"I like him, don't I?" Harry said. "I really like him, not just a little flirting, and that’s why I'm acting like an idiot. And I am a horrible person because I like someone who can't even tip a waiter properly!"
Harry snorts. "Fat chance. But we needed each other, don't you think?"
a shame when good relationships go south. I always say it's from the magical community's shameful lack of therapy."
Harry blinks. It's not that he
"Sure," Draco says, scanning the shelf of chocolates. "Now Potter, your first lesson in mousse making: anything less than 60% cacao will not do."
"We need two lists," Draco said, ignoring Harry. "One for the foreign magic ban and one for the ICW slash Triple M."
"Give it to me when you're done, Draco," Hermione says, "I want to write something too."
Harry accepted a mug from Albus and sat. "Right. Erm. I wanted to check in with you. About how you're feeling about me and Draco."
"We're in the kitchen!" Draco called.
Draco let his mouth drop open dramatically, pretending to swat at Harry's arm, but not actually making contact. "You're supposed to say it's me!"
And here Harry was standing in the kitchen of a swank townhome that he owned half of, in a group hug with James and Draco, and all Harry could think was—well,
“People don’t.” It’s true—though Draco had seen him that way for a long time. Well, as that plus an enormous prat. But he doesn’t now. Harry’s just—Harry. A fantastic Defence teacher, fun to be around, caring, hilarious, self-deprecating. He knows all his students’ problems and keeps in touch with Luna Lovegood by long letters. He’s not that scrawny kid. He’s a non-scrawny, unreasonably attractive adult. Some people—strangers—might think of him as the famous Saviour, but no one thinks of Harry as that little kid, now.
Parvati said it'd be today, and Harry was freaking out. He was pretending that he wasn't freaking out, but he was. He couldn't believe they'd let Parvati talk them into this.
"She's so fucking cute," Harry enthused. "Right? Like, it's not my imagination. She is
“Hey, Dad?” James called loudly from the corridor.
Draco nodded. "Yes. Good. We should ask Lily for help. She's good with languages, right? She could help make a list."
“I don’t know!” Draco says. “I may have sometimes fantasised about it, back then.”
Harry burst out laughing, the entire thing suddenly seeming like the funniest thing that had ever happened. He imagined his adolescent self seeing this headline and started laughing even harder. When he managed to lift his face, he saw Draco staring at him, pointy chin raised, lips pressed together, and Harry dissolved again into further peals of laughter. "I'm sorry—it's just—"
As Draco kneeled in front of Scorpius and put his hands on those jiggling knees, Harry intercepted Albus's pacing and wrapped him in a hug.
"I don't think so," Harry said, "though obviously she
Harry gasped, laughing again, as his head hit something hard. "Ow," he laughed, between kisses, reaching up to hold his head. "I whacked a knob."
Malfoy rips off a piece of muffin and chucks it at Harry's face. It hits him square in the centre of his forehead. "Don't be an arsehole. All you need is someone who won't run away when you yell at them."
"Plus," Parvati said crisply, "people think you're fit. They'd get their rocks off, imagining the two of you at it. Which, needless to say, sells super well."
The goblin squinted. "You're Harry Potter."
you?"
"Oh," he says. "Sorry!" And he focuses, retreating out of my mind. My head throbs, like an echo in a room that used to have more furniture. "Are you alright?"
"Where is it?" he muttered, patting different pockets. "I've been carrying it for weeks!"
"Draco!" the young Potters chorused, and Lily threw her arms around his neck. It was strange that he was used to that—that this brilliant, fiery young woman wanted to hug him, to treat him as an auxiliary parent figure. He squeezed, and then she was gone as fast as she'd appeared.
"Cheers." Harry signals the bartender for another round. "Come dance with me and Hermione. The only requirement is that you have to dance poorly, and you can't act weird around us because the Prophet keeps calling us 'heroes'."
"You didn't tell me you were late," Harry says, wincing when he realises it sounds like he's blaming her.
Draco pointed a menacing finger. “You take that back. My teenage emo phase was more intense than most. Don’t sully my sinister reputation.”
The thing about conversations was that once you didn't have them, they got harder and harder to initiate.
"I need to talk to you about the Fobturk case because you were the last person to—" Draco fell completely silent, his eyes dropping to Harry's bottom half. "You—"
Harry is late.
When he spoke, he didn't say it. "We haven't been honest. Things have been good between us
of us to be able to buck expectations. We've…faced similar constraints, in some ways. Not that I am comparing myself to you, obviously you outshine me in goodness and morality by any metric."
Harry keeps sneaking glances at Malfoy, remembering that first night when they were at the club. The atmosphere is similar in some ways—music, lots of people—but that's where the similarities end. They're not drunk, and they're not hiding, and they've spent the last few weeks figuring out how to be
Draco considered explaining that a dietary regime cannot become a lifestyle if the experience of following it required one to exert willpower, but he stopped himself, realising this could not possibly help the course of this discussion.
She blinks, confused. "I mean, we said we would talk about it, but themore I thought about it the more I realised I needed to do it as soon as possible. You can't honestly think there was any other choice?"
. If he needs to define his sexuality and come out in the newspapers. Fucking hell. No.
"I'm seeing someone. It started after we split. But, for the past couple months, really." He takes a deep breath. "And I'm bisexual, I think. I mean, I like blokes. I can say that definitively."
"She will not stop crying! We have the milk perfect—you know we took a class in that, just like Potions, no big deal—but she won't drink it. Is she going to hate us forever because we only have useless man nipples? We're trying to do the swaddle charm they showed us at St Mungo's, but it is not working at all; her arms keep popping out the top! And the nappy!" He paused, inhaling. "We've been home for like, what, twelve hours? And I'm convinced there's faeces on every surface of our flat. Why did they let us take her home? She isn't even
A man wearing an expensive-looking Muggle suit stepped inside far too familiarly for Harry's liking. Jorgen's too, judging from the way his assistant subtly raised his wand from the file cabinet to the door.
For a moment, Harry considers resisting. He can't
He paused, trying to place the voices.
Harry, still on his back, looked up at the ceiling. "In here."
Harry lay awake in bed, mind racing unhelpfully, until Ron and Hermione woke up and ushered him to the Great Hall for breakfast.
“Is this like, your baseline level of cursing? Do you spend every waking moment of every day exercising self-control to keep them inside?”
. And we kept seeing each other—weddings and holidays and birthdays and celebrating Albus's degree, and—and we worked together on the LabMag political campaigns, and—fuck!" Draco's voice was pleading now, loud and insistent. "You can't understand! You're too young! You don't know what the war was like. Harry understands the things that made me who I am. Do you know how hard it is to go through life talking to people who don't understand who you are? And do you know that I feel that way
"Yeah. What do you think is good timing?"
It's kind of true—if you'd asked Harry at the club what he was thinking, his answer would've been a shrug. But he wonders, now, if maybe on that night the parts of his brain he's not in excellent contact with had known more than his thinking brain. Maybe those synapses had seen a lonely, broken boy who needed a new way to belong and said,
He heard the scraping of Draco's chair against the floor and leaped out of his own seat, shoes falling to the floor, and spun around to find himself chest-to-chest with Draco. Harry's face was hot from being put on the spot with all these questions about their love life, and Draco's hair was all mussed up and his ears were red. For a moment, they stared at each other.
"Since this is an unconventional stag do for an unconventional family," Scorpius announced, radiating happiness, "many conventional activities are…precluded."
The old elf popped into view. “Yes, Master Harry?” Then Kreacher noticed Malfoy and tripped over his long feet. “You are a Black.”
Songs pass. Various people join them to talk, with varying degrees of wariness towards Malfoy, though no one is outright hostile. They laugh while Ron hops onto a table and performs a jig. There's a contest to throw popcorn into people's mouths. Terry Boot accuses Malfoy good-naturedly of cheating in a Chess Club match in year four (Harry wonders what he was doing when they were in a
Harry cast a Location spell to find which drawer his joggers were in, then walked over to the illuminated drawer. Generally, he slept without pants, but it seemed going a bit too far to drop pants with Draco in the room, and it would be awkward to walk into the loo just to change into his pyjama bottoms. Pants it was, he thought, tugging the joggers on.
He grasps the strange chain and whispers, "Lumos."
“Thanks for coming," Penelope said with a smile. "Today we're going to brew the Draught of Pure Imagination.”
After a minute, he stood and walked into the house. Everyone was in the kitchen. Fleur had Dominique in a sling that magically adjusted to hold the baby in whatever position was needed (currently, the baby was breastfeeding), Victoire was at the table with crayons showing Teddy her drawing, and Bill was buttering toast triangles for the kids.
“I dunno,” Ron said, waving his freckled hand. “You know how he gets in those letters. I can never keep the dragons straight.”
Draco smiles. "But you're Harry Potter. Forgiveness comes easy to you. I'll owl you later, okay? Want to come over and work on that Magimanities assignment?"
Harry shot a Stinging Hex at Draco's arse as they continued up the stairs. Draco's outraged and delighted laugh rang through the stairwell, echoing like the clear sound of a welcoming bell.
"Because…because I haven't been
Draco reached out with exaggerated slowness and pretended to hit Harry's arm.
"At least you've been with friends recently, Potter. I've been spending all my time alone in my room. No one to whom to complain."
"Yeah, well, I've been trying to ignore you since I met you," Harry mumbled.
"I hate you," she says, her face sad and soft. "See you Sunday." She turns and walks briskly into the house.
"I didn't run away," Malfoy said, turning to fully look at Harry. "I had someplace to be. I left a note."
“Sleep. Hang out with Ron and Hermione, and some of the others. Go through the motions of going to class, eat junk food on the bed.”
"I'm not supporting that bill."
Harry snorted, opening his eyes to find Wilhelm peering curiously at him. "This ensemble is probably going to get me sacked today, Wil." He looked around the office. "Shit. They probably won't even let me come back in here after. Jorgen!"
Draco grabs Harry by the elbows and steers him back into the bedroom, closing the door behind them and casting his own wards—wards he probably learned in the war too.
Draco's laugh rumbled against Harry's neck, and his voice was scratchy when he said, "We wouldn't want to have you impaled from behind. On a knob."
"That's a lot," Harry said, using all his will to prevent himself from offering any opinions.
"Good grief, I suppose I am," Draco answered her, and she put her head on his shoulder as if to soothe his injured pride.
Wormtail's just lying there. It's creeping me out, especially since I keep forgetting about him and then remembering again. For a moment, I can't look away. "Do you think the rat will eat the corpse? Or do you think it has a sense that the man is part rat, and it would be against the ethical code of rats?"
“Good morning, Harry!” Draco said with a fair amount of cheer as Harry walked into the office the following day. “Have you seen the Prophet? I’m expecting an irate owl from my father any minute, care to join me? I know you’re as eager as I am to see what he has to say.”
Harry rolls onto his back towards her. "The thing that Ginny and I fought about—she got pregnant."
unfortunate."
but Hermione hadn't even dignified that with an answer.
"LILY!"
Draco sighed. "Poor Scorpius. Poor Albus. They've really been through it."
"I guess there's not much we can do until we know exactly what he's prohibiting," Harry said, sighing and turning back to his onion.
Draco’s head whipped toward him, eyes narrowed as if to tell whether Harry was joking. “You’re serious.”
This had never happened when he was in charge. Everyone knew that behaviour like this wasn't tolerated under Harry Potter—and because he was
"Er, so how's life?" Harry asked, feeling like a moron as he said it.
Harry looks into the bag, pulling out two small boxes. "Oh! This is for my flat, I guess, not yours. Two more games for the NES: Mario Brothers and Tetris."
Harry looked out thoughtfully at the water.
Steps echoed down the long dark, damp hallway as Draco Malfoy walked briskly to the underground dungeons. His hand slipped over his wand holster, ensuring that his wand was in reachable distance. Walking through the high arched doorway Draco was hit with the scent of piss and something rotten.
"Potter, darling," Parkinson drawled, "You have no idea. Nearly eight years of it. It was horrible. Now, we know why at least. Maybe now he will talk less about you because he will be so busy snogging you."
Draco groaned, buttoning the last button, "Pans, don't even start on that. I have a performance in an hour. I have to focus."
"It's okay you don't have to explain. Why don't we go back out and enjoy the show?"
said.
Laying in a see through case on a shelf that was littered with even more books and something that looked like burnt feathers, laid a single golden snitch. Harry slowly looked around the room again to see if anyone was around. When he found no one, he bent down and picked up the box.
, but thinking deeper, thinking about what it would do to Draco, how he would die slowly, oh-so-slowly, if something happened to him, he knew he would protect himself too.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was so wrapped up in the captivating voice, he couldn’t even be shocked that the angelic voice he was listening to was Draco Malfoy. Malfoy's voice was extremely calming. Listening more intently, Harry realized just how beautiful Malfoy's voice actually was. The sound, Harry soon found, was addicting. It's like he couldn't stop listening nor could he look away from the almost angelic looking man.
Draco paused for a moment. Clearly, this animal is powerful, extremely so, but besides the occasional growl he has shown no signs of aggression or any want to injure or kill. He could probably talk the cat into letting them go, or if not talk try and get into the feline's mind again to put him asleep, if he was able to get in that is. He could also try and take them by way of force but there were many, many reasons why that was a bad idea. Main reason being that Draco believed these show of powers were only a small portion of what the cat could do and Draco really didn't want to see more shows without a little bit of backup.
Draco pushed his parchment away, standing up from the bed, "You don't know what you are saying, Harry. You don't understand what you are signing up for. I'm a freak. I'm dangerous. I'm a dangerous fucking freak, Potter."
"'I can't believe that
A voice that wasn't Draco's, but came from his mouth, demanded.
Harry shook his head, bumping their noses together, "No, I've never even heard of that before."
Malfoy raised his hand slightly, speaking before he was even called upon, "Professor, I am deeply sorry but I can't participate in drinking the potion."
This test tonight isn't just to see who is stronger, but to see who can hear the banshee's call. I'm not sure if you are aware, but the Stevens' have had banshee blood in them for years. No one knows if it was their ancestor that was the one that became one with the tree or not. But tonight, Miss Cooley Stevens, the girl from your graduated class, Hampton, will give the call. We need to see if one of them will respond. Who ever responds to the call, that will be the sacrifice to replace Pasiphae to keep our magic. The other will be used to complete the ritual and beat the storm before it gets to the tree."
doesn't want me.. the Veela does."
"You're first time here?" A man to his right asked.
"Draco?" He asked tentatively, "Are you awake?" Harry leaned closer, noticing how the boy seem to be barely breathing. He dropped his bag instantly and went to where Draco's face was.
Glancing over at the digit clock on the table side, Draco sighed and got to his feet to prepare for his next location.
"Potter, I don't mind."
Draco smiles out the window, taking in the beautifully flat plains and the growing flowers all along the gravel highway. "I'm performing at La Crows tonight and tomorrow night."
He heard a shuffle. "Yes, and have you looked at what happens to them when there mate is denied? It doesn't end well. For either parties."
"You had Snape's book?"
The cat looked down at his paws for a moment before looking towards its hostages. For a moment everything was still as the panther sat with an unreadable expression staring at the floating bodies before he jumped down from the boulder and began walking underneath the victims. Draco stood back as they both began to lower, dropping softly unto the cold, stone ground.
Harry plopped down, grabbing a cracker from the sleeve Hermione was holding. Draco gave them each a kiss on the cheek before sitting beside Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes, "Yes, like a dog. You know, Potter, I am starting to see that you have a very kinky side."
Harry gave him a small smile, "Nothing, really, I just was thinking about how I used walk around the halls at night like this. Before the war. Before.. everything that has happened." Being surrounded by mostly darkness, and with the knowledge - the hope - that nothing is out to get him anymore, Harry felt safe. Having Malfoy next to him, having their arms brushing with an electric shock every step, brought Harry that safe feeling as well, which didn't scare or confuse him as much as he thought it should.
Draco closed his eyes tightly as a single tear fell down his cheek, "Harry.. I don't know if I can control it. It's like I transform into something completely different. I don't want to hurt you. I can't hurt you."
Harry rolled his eyes, facing away from the cauldron and towards the board, "Fairy wings."
Before his cousin could respond, Hampton spoke, "Mrs. Talent said that she saw Draco Malfoy at the tree, during our meeting. She said that it seemed as if the tree was responding to the him and his magic. Doesn't that mean he can hear the banshee? Or feel it or whatever?"
"Oh please, a fly cold get a better rise out of me than that."
Harry's knowing smirk answered him as he took another bite of the bagel.
Harry reach up, cupped Draco's cheek, "Draco.. I trust you. I trust you in any and every form." He brought their faces closer together, rubbing their noses together slightly. "I know it's scary. I can't even begin to imagine what it feels like but Draco, please, I trust you and I think I-"
The man had a familiar sparkle in his eye that tugged at Harry's heart, "Ah, yes. Yes in deed. This place is more special than even you can imagine. Have you had a chance to look around the whole island yet?" Harry shook his head no.
"Um, Potter?"
was at my performance tonight."
. While he is glad she got him to do, right here, right now, sitting in the middle of potions with Malfoy's left leg brushing his own under the table, he is sourly regretting his decisions.
Harry knew he should be paying attention to the conversations around him - it was so rare that they all had a break in their studies to be together; but he couldn't focus on anything but Draco leaning further back on him, head against Harry's shoulder.
Draco took a deep breath and began tapping his wand tip against each corner of the door, softly whispering, "
Once up in his room, Harry nearly tore the place apart looking for the green necklace he had been given. He wasn't sure why it seemed extremely important that he brought it with them, he just knew that he needed to.
"I'm so sorry, Harry." Draco looked like he was on the verge of tears. Harry tried to reach out but Draco flew a few feet away, "No, please, Harry, I can't- I can't control- I can't stop it. Please, I can't hurt you, so please.." Draco spun quickly and ran through the tapestry.
The panther laid down and placed his head upon Draco's knee, looking up at him.
Harry laughed, "I am sitting right here."
"Just so you know, I don't think you'll find anything useful in reading
The next hour was torture as Draco tried to drink and dance away his problems. No matter where he looked, Potter seemed to be there, snuggled up to the same man. Draco began wondering if maybe they had come here together. That first night he saw Harry at his show Harry had been with him. Thinking further though, he remembered that Harry was alone at the hotel the first time he caught sight of the black haired man. He also was alone when they ran into each other at the park. But the tall man could've just been otherwise preoccupied.
The person on the other side of the door giggled uncontrollably. Draco opened the door, slower this time, looking directly at Harry Potter, with tears of laughter falling down his face.
Harry hesitated. "Is he alright?"
"Uh, uh. I would lead you to a hidden room with fake food laced with
With that he began walking away from the table. Harry jumped after him crashing over him, bringing them both to the floor. They wrestled for a moment, before Harry finally was able to lock Hampton down. He held his arms above his head, straddling his hips to keep him for jerking out of this grasp, "You do not get to come at me with that and then get up and leave without an explanation!"
, Harry thought,
"'Did you see
The sight made Harry pause. Harry stared for a moment, soaking in the sight of Draco peacefully strumming his guitar. Never in Harry's whole life has he thought a sight could make him feel so at peace yet so alive at the same time. Looking at Draco, sitting here in mere darkness, strumming his guitar without a fear in the world had opened Harry's eyes to reality. He realized what he said about Draco to Hampton on that drunken night was the truest statement he has ever spoken. The reality of that truth, of how much he adores the man in front of him, squeezed his chest so tight it hurt.
Harry and Malfoy, while not exactly becoming friends, speak more often -mainly in small gestures, points, and little noises- but still communicating to some sort none the less. It wasn't the hugest step to most, but for the two boys it was a leap.
“This isn’t safe.” Harry whispered as Draco reluctantly let him go.
Another bolt of lightening flew across the sky, followed by the loud clapping of thunder.
Draco's brows knitted in confusion at the human words. "What are you kitty?" Draco whispered.
He looked down at the hand. It felt nice. Extremely nice. He quickly nodded and tried not to be too disappointed when Draco took his hand away.
"Thanks." He said quickly, ducking out of the room.
Malfoy's hands started to shake, he quickly hid them under the table, "No, sir, I am not but-"
Even though he was enriched by the way the sunset danced on Draco's skin, his curiosity got the best of him, "Whatcha thinking about?"
Harry held his breath as he listened. What's dangerous?
This Malfoy standing in front of Harry looked nothing like the Malfoy he saw last. This Malfoy was bright. No dark circles could be found, no hollow cheeks. While he still did have that very characteristic pointy-ness, his features had softened with the weight he has gained. His eyes were brighter than Harry thought possible. The smokey grey eyes that used to be so dark it seemed to reflect his old personality, were now a bright cloudy grey. Looking up at the man that stood in front of him Harry couldn't help but wonder if this bright eyed, soft featured man could possibly be the same sour little boy he knew back in school.
He heard Pansy sigh, "Maybe.. maybe it's a sign."
"You know I can't give in." Foot steps walked away from Malfoy's voice.
"Which do you think looks better?"
He could tell with every page she flipped, she was becoming more and more agitated. She let out a sigh, slamming the book she was flipping through shut and pushing it away from her. "You haven't seen Fleur since that day?" He shook his head. "Maybe I should Floo Ron, he can ask Bill or something. The only possible thing I can think of is that Malfoy is a Veela, but that's nearly impossible, especially to be a
"'Mione.."
"No offense but Draco and I's past is between Draco and I."
Draco laughed, "Please, Pansy, Blaise couldn't even behave himself in Potions when we had Snape to answer to. There is no hope for him." They both laughed.
"This is the third song, y'all just made it to the half way mark." A lanky, dirty blond haired boy leaned over to whisper.
Draco sighed deeply, feeling anxiety and fear creeping through his every nerve. "Yes, I'll be there all day. Please, let me know what you find."
The door barged open a minute later, three students, along with a few others, waltzed through the door, chatting loudly.
"Oi, Potter!" He turned back towards the hall at Pansy Parkinson marching towards him, looking furious. "What the hell did you do to him? I know its you. It's always
"Hello." He whispered when the cat came to a stand-still, growling softly. "Cool party trick you have here."
in common - obsessing over school work, constantly reading and learning even when they don't have to, constantly badgering Harry to do his work, fighting for the rights of house elves, their want to get into the ministry to try and fix the corrupt systems. It was almost scary the amount they had in common.
"We have to get dressed. We have about five minutes before our ride picks us up."
He waved to the others as they walked away, leaving him and Draco looking out of over the lake alone.
Draco opened and closed his mouth several times before clenching his jaw shut, shaking his head and turning it towards the dark, empty hallway.
you learn to live without. I can only do some healing charms, and a few household charms. I once was able to conjure a tiny fire, but I was in a state of rage that no person should ever be in."
George shook his head, "So, the necklace, why give it to the Potter boy?"
The music and people were giving me a headache so I decided to-"
Pomfrey stood up straighter, "Harry, how do you.."
"You're the genius that pointed out the instructions are on the board, why don't you tell me?"
time finding his shop."
He looked towards Parkinson, "I would live for him. Against all odds, even if I know I could help someone, if it is too dangerous, too life threatening I would turn, let someone else help them, if it meant that it would keep Draco alive and safe. If it meant Draco would be okay. I would take a bullet for him, but you're right, I would take a bullet for pretty much anyone. But for Draco, I would not only die for him, I would also choose to live for him."
"You don't have to be afraid, I told you we only want to help." Draco's hair on his arms and neck slowly start to rise as he felt wild magic soaring around him. A bright sky blue light whipped around Draco, sending leaves and dirt into the air, leaving a dirty film over the mist. The blue magic flew in a circle before coming to a complete ring around the open floor, floating gently in air at shoulder height. Draco allowed himself to feel the confusion and amazement at the extraordinary power the cat freely showed for only a millisecond before turning back towards the tree he knew the panther laid in. When he looked up towards it, however, he found the panther not on the branches but instead walking under the ring of light slowly.
Draco jerked away from the cat the second he found his own body again.
The man chuckled, moving closer to them.
The room was silent for a moment.
When the panther's bowl was completely clean and he was working on his bowl of water, Draco slowly rose onto his knees. The panther raised his head as Draco raised his body.
Harry leaned into Hampton to whisper that it was alright with him. They slowly made their way to the table, saying excuse me and I'm sorry at least thirty-two times. Once they finally got the tables they realized the show had already began.
The clock next to his phone read.
"You know, when Draco used to talk about you," Zabini, who has stayed silent, spoke up quietly, "I always felt like there was something more than just a childhood rivalry. You being his mate makes more sense than you could even comprehend." He smiled softly. "The boy was obsessed. All through school, 'Potter-this, Potter-that.'"
Harry blushed even further, running a hand through his hair, "Oh, um, well, it's just.. we will probably be seeing each other and running into each other and I came here to get away from the stupid awkward conversations and awkwardness that has become of my life so.. I don't know can we just try and be.. civil?" He looked up at Malfoy with pleading eyes, "I haven't been able to just..
The second Draco stepped into the tiny shack, every hair on his body stood up. Instantly recognizing the feel of the low rumble of magic.
Malfoy was sitting on a comfy looking leather couch with multiple books stacked beside him, one of the bigger books sitting in his lap. Watching Malfoy sitting in a library with shiny blue hair, with his eyebrows furled and lips pressed into a thin line from concentration, had a different kind of warmth fill up Harry's belly. He thought for a moment about going over to him, talking to him, maybe even questioning about Fleur or the tingles, something he has been wanting to do but has been too afraid to ask, but couldn't bring himself to do so. The boy that was sitting in front of him looked so serious and concentrated, he felt he couldn't break that. So, Harry stood behind a shelf, watching the boy open the heavy tome in his lap for a second longer than turned away.
Harry hesitated before touching his arm softly, "No, I asked and I'm glad you trusted me enough to answer honestly."
"Professor-"
Harry turned to her, but her eyes stayed focused on the lake in front of them. He sighed and looked out as well, "I don't know. I know I care for him. I know I feel his energy and I love the feeling of being around him. I like his personality, his openness, his stupid humor, the way he holds himself, the way he holds
Harry gently splashed some water in Draco's directions, "They are called contacts and they work perfectly fine. They help me see whats in-front of me, not behind me."
Malfoy shook his head, "No, not at all actually. The ingredients might be the same but when mixed together they can have different affects to the person or thing, plus different reactions to each other, therefore the antidotes more than likely wouldn't help because the property of the different ingredients had been changed or altered. Same case with the antidotes. If you mix the antidotes together, the ingredients may cancel each other out causing them to be ineffective or in the worst case scenario could even hurt the person more.
The room was quiet when the two students walked in. Madame Pomfrey, McGonagal, Fleur and Narcissa Malfoy stood around an empty bed. The tension in the room could've been sliced with a knife.
Their bodies were pressed together tightly, almost causing Harry to pass out from the feeling of lightening bolts and flames that struck at every nerve in the raven-haired boy's body. Harry moved his forehead against Draco's, too light headed to keep it up straight.
God, Severus Snape, at a very young age. Due to this gift, he finds himself often times slipping into other's minds without meaning too. Draco usually catches himself before he slips too far into the persons' psyche, but he still always catches a few words before he slips out.
The women shared a look that Harry couldn't read.
Harry grabbed a packet of cream cheese and began smearing it on the bagel.
As soon as Slughorn dismissed them, Harry began collecting his things. He turned towards the door, glancing at the table Draco was at, noticing that he was still there at the table. He had his head down, face towards the wall. Harry walked closer, placing his hand on the table next the boys head.
Veela,
(See the end of the chapter for
"This better be worth it. You know I don't do well without my eight hours." He spoke softly to the dark haired man that was waiting for him at the entrance, leaning against the doorway.
Hermione nodded, "She seemed so familiar to me, I can't quite place it though."
He whispered over and over again against his lips. Suddenly, right when Harry was moving to put his head against Draco’s shoulder, Draco’s chest rose high as he took in a shuddered and strained breath.
Draco waited with bated breath for Pansy to answer.
Harry places his head in his hands as he leaned on the table, watching the performance intently. As the song continued, Malfoy's face seemed to get brighter and brighter, his smile growing larger and larger.
The door slowly opened with a light knock, "Mr. Malfoy are you in here."
In respect for Draco, Harry sat across the table, "Look, I'm sorry about that night. I felt horrible when I woke up the next day and realized what I said. Me and him have a long history, and not a romantic kind and seeing him it just-"
"What are you three doing here?"
"You first." They both said at the same time. They looked at each other with shy smiles.
quickly.
Slowly the fear of seeing his old rival flew away, instead being replaced with curiosity on just what the Malfoy Heir has been doing all this time.
He felt more than saw Harry shake his head, "Are you like.. wizards or something? Witches?"
Many questions went through his head but the main one, the screaming one, spoke above them all.
do I-"
"You know," Draco started, sitting up straighter, "One of these days I am going to get you to like me." Léon's ear twitched slightly. "Don't deny it, you are already getting use to me."
"How is it that you always know when I have a new charge?" He questioned as he unwrapped his straw.
Everyday he has spent at least four hours in the cat's presence, not including Saturdays and Sundays unless it was his weekend shift, he finds himself questioning the mentality of the cat every day. The more time he spends with the cat, the more his gut is screaming at him that this animal isn't just an animal.
Hermione laughed, "You think? You are literally the mate to a guy we only knew as a bully growing up and have some how became pals with Parkinson and Zabini over a short conversation down by a lake. Ron is going to wish he was here when I tell him all of this.. you don't mind if I tell him do you?"
Harry was very much regretting that decision.
"Sorry about-"
Harry shook his head, "You didn't have to do anything. You had a choice to follow him or come to us and you made your choice."
Walking towards the back, he continued to look in awe of the decorations.
"Late night, Potter?"
" sign on it. On the right of the entrance was where the little cafe was. Witches and Wizards alike sat with various to-go cups and books laying about their tables.
Draco hurried to Harry's side. His hand was already beginning to blister up.
He looked up at the boy, but his gaze was firmly on Hermione.
Harry looked around the group, confused, "About what?"
Draco sat up straight, suddenly feeling extremely jealous. He looked down at his drink and in one swoop downed the entire thing. He quickly ordered another.
"-the point is: I'm so very sorry." He nodded towards her, in a silent bow. "I'll see you later, Harry. Have fun."
"Another grand performance Mister Malfoy." Malfoy rolled his eyes as he walked towards the dressing room, "I've told you, Mitch, quit calling me 'Mister'."
That's why he froze when the words
Sitting next to the stage so close Draco could reach a foot out and kick his stupid face, was one Harry Potter. To the regular viewer it would seem that Draco was perfectly fine and performing like he was born to do it, which anyone who has heard him sing knew he was. But today not even the familiar, usually calming feeling of his guitar in his hands could cause the panic that is slowly rising to the surface. Luckily, his set was almost up with only two more songs to go. He can do this. Two more songs.
Harry's gaze jumped to look at the blurry eyes attached to the boy beside him. "Is it really?"
Draco smiled broadly at that, "Weren't
"Did you know he was coming back?" Hermione asked Harry.
Harry stared into the cauldron, "What do we add first?"
Pansy shifted out of the flames for a moment, before looking back through. "Nothing yet. It's been only six hours since we heard of what happened; six hours of nighttime, where the majority of the population is asleep. We will let you know if we find absolutely anything. Will you be at the office all day?"
Harry was thrown out of that thought when Draco exclaimed, “What the actual fuck is going on?”
Looking at him was exasperated grey eyes. The man looked up to the sky, "Why are you doing this?"
He now was signed with a management company named
Harry suddenly felt his heart race and shatter in the same moment. "He pushed me away."
"It wouldn't be if you just gave in!" A thumping noise followed.
- need to stay focused on that. On being normal school kids. We can be normal." Hermione talked like she was trying to persuade not only Harry but herself.
With soft goodnights, both boys floated to their rooms, high off of the days adventures and excited for what tomorrow will bring.
"Either way, we need to figure out what to do and fast. The storm has already begun wrapping itself around the island." Widow Annie said, somberly.
"How bad is this ritual?"
he thought.
Sitting on a large branch, was none other than the one roommate he was trying to avoid, Draco Malfoy. He looked strange, tucked up in a tree with a large book in his lap.
Harry chuckled lightly as he leaned over the table even more so, suddenly getting a brilliant idea, "What are you doing today?"
"No really. I'll give you money and-"
He was worried about Hermione reaction, in particular. She has always had a distaste for the Malfoy family, but after they were captured and Bellatrix carved out that hateful word in her arm, Hermione’s hatred turned to straight fury. The Malfoy family may not have done it, but it happened in their house. And they did nothing to stop it from happening.
"Oh, no sir. I don't mind in the slightest! What can I do you for?"
"You know as well as I do that I always do even exchanges, Marcus. I, in fact, have already leveled our playing grounds." Draco reached into his robes slowly, pulling out a file. "Bring this to Matthew Gregory and he will gladly take care of the little
Years of constantly hearing whispers and feeling eyes on them,  had both Draco and Harry attuned to when eyes were watching them.
drew the boys' attentions to the entryway of the parlor room, shaking out his arms was their frail, drenched uncle.
Draco sat quietly observing the magnificent creature before him. He has had history with many types of creatures, has helped and rehabilitated all sorts of magical and non-magical creatures alike, but besides only one instant of an Animagus, who was stuck mid-transformation of his lynx form when Draco first arrived at
"Do you know what time this performance will be?"
Draco thought bitterly.
"Draco has been with Bill and I since his inheritance come to light. We have been helping any way we can. I am only part so I don't have nearly the struggles Draco has, but being from a family of Veela, we have been able to help him control himself and learn more about his heritage."
Before Draco could respond, Harry kissed his cheek and walked out the door.
For a moment Draco and Léon looked at each other, both not knowing what the next move should be.
The women took out a rag and began wiping the counter down, "As far as I know, not much. There is a performance of some sort down at La Crows tonight. But besides that I believe it will be a quiet weekend on the island."
Malfoy turned towards Harry, gazing at him with a look Harry has never seen him wear before. If he had is glasses on and could see the look more clearly, he believe the gaze would be almost
The books Draco had brought the night before still sat upon the table, waiting and wishing to be opened. Draco knew that he would only drive himself crazy if he tried to sit still and read. So, he chucked off his outer robes and headed towards his charge.
Not only was his hair different, Harry noticed, but his whole wardrobe was too. The pastel boy had ill fitting robes on, and light pink earrings in his ears. When he rolled up his sleeves, the Dark Mark -a mark that Voldemort had given his followers, was gone completely, in its place laid an arrangement of flowers and what looked like writing.
"You know her, Draco, she some how knows everything." Blaise leaned towards Draco, "It is extremely freaky and often times a terrible gift, in my opinion."
"Yeah, I'll do that when Hermione fails a class."
, Draco thought.
Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed the bagel in Harry's hand, switching it for the one he had on his plate, "Happy now?"
it just seems like this island is out to get me."
An uproar erupted as Profess-
"If you need a deeper reasoning, I can go get Headmistress McGonagal, Professor." Malfoy's voice, while he spoke quietly, was forceful enough to quiet any whispers that they other students were saying.
"Let’s start walking, you still need to tell me about that tree."
Closing his eyes, he shook his head, "No, no, I meant like- let me.. We can go.." He trailed off, losing the sentence.
"Harry.." he heard Draco whisper behind him, "these are potion ingredients. All of these jars."
The boy shook his head, pulling his knees closer to his body. "No, I mean, I don't.. I don't know. They took me.. me and-"
Harry scuffed, "Hell no."
The two students walked to the far end of the table casually, slipping in next to what looked like Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. The conversations slowly came back up, softer than it was before, but Harry couldn't focus on anything but the boy.
A tear fell straight down his chin, traveling down his neck, stopping at the neck of his shirt.
She moved her other hand away from the ring, quickly. "Nothing. It's nothing."
Draco rolled his head towards Harry. Harry's heart nearly stopped beating at the pure openness and beauty that was staring back at him.
would do something as foolish as put his name in that cup. Doesn't he know how dangerous it is? Stupid attention-seeking Gryffindor.'"
Blaise Zabini materialized in front of him, putting himself between Harry and the angry girl. "Pans, calm. You know it doesn't matter what he did, you can't kill him."
, do you even know what that means?"
After a few stroked, a soft purring began above him. Draco closed his eyes, smiling softly as he continued his calming strokes.
"Fuck, fuck, fuck." Filtered through Draco's mind as he slowly stood up.
Draco bumped his shoulder with Harry's as the boy sat down, "What did Hampton want?"
"You need a quick ride? I'm just getting off shift but I don't mind helping a friend out!"
This smile, Harry thought, was much better.
constantly rolling through Harry's head, he made what he thinks is a pretty good guess. Draco Malfoy is a Veela. Or part-veela, at the very least. He opted to not tell Hermione what he heard Saturday after they left the library. He felt bad enough about eavesdropping to begin with and couldn't bring himself to speak about the private conversation he heard. Even now, the sound of Draco's voice being broken up and seemingly
Draco forced a smile onto his face, "Yeah.. yeah.. Um.. I'm Draco.. which I guess you know already.." he looked down and cleared his throat. When he looked back up the man was leaning on the doorway casually looking as cheeky as ever, "I am.. um, I'm excited to get to perform with you as well."
Just as quickly as the visions began, they stopped. He wasn't falling any longer, he was now floating. Floating on something soft and warm. Something inviting. Draco's lungs, which must have fallen at a slower rate than the rest of him, finally caught up to his body and he could breath again. He breathed deeply for a few moments before wiggling his toes, then his fingers, then his feet and hands. When all limbs and appendages seemed to be intact and not retching in pain, he looked around himself.
Draco turned his back towards the sun. For moment Harry thought he wasn't going to answer.
"Potter?" Strong harms grabbed his shoulders, holding him in a sitting position, "Potter? What's going on?"
Hermione looked at Harry confused. She looked towards Luna and back at Harry, "No, why?"
"You see boys, Young Harry needs that necklace. I believe who ever told you the prophesy either didn't tell you the full thing or had their own facts mixed together. Yes, the boy will cease to exist, but he will not die. Let me ask you, what do you think the gathering tonight is for?"
The cat has been at the
Harry found himself grinning, "He really said things like that?"
They walked for many minutes until they came across a small rock archway, which Draco assumed lead a cave of some sort. The panther looked back at Draco before turning towards the cave and entering, the blue light following leaving the darkness of the forest to once again surround Draco.
Granger stared at him blankly for a moment. She closed her eyes, taking a shallow breath. "So. The panther. I've read the reports you sent, also read the books as well as did my own research, which I'm not a hundred percent finished with yet, and I understand where the frustration is coming from. I have found no animals with the powers you have written on the reports nor have I found anything remotely similar to the magic and the physicality of said panther."
"Logic." He whispered to himself. "Be logical."
As the second song came to a close and the third slowly began, he couldn't help but look around at all the adoring faces of the crowd and smiled broadly.
"Do you miss them?" Harry whispered, so quietly Draco wasn't sure if he even said anything.
As the new headmaster, Headmistress McGonagal, stood to begin the welcoming speech, the Great Hall's door swung open, entering two late-comers.
He only seems to clam up when in the presence of people. Draco is determined to open the panther up.
She let out a dry laugh, rubbing her face again. "Wow, thanks Draco. You really know how to make a girl feel better."
"Yes, sir. That would be brilliant."
, He thought,
He didn't sleep much the rest of the night but the little sleep he did have, it was filled with blue hair, steel eyes, and lots of blood and anguish.
As Harry walked over to where the man was, Draco stayed behind and began looking through the jars. There were many items he recognized- warts, snake venom, bile, talons, basilisk scales; there was also a few items he didn’t quite recognize.
without talking to the rest of the council. I don't give a damn if he is the oldest of the founder families. Someone has to talk to him before he does something as reckless as giving the boys a key to a private jet so they can escape."
Harry gave a small smile, "Sorry, I just felt sick suddenly. It must of just been something I ate."
Assuming he was just feeling warm from nerves, he stuck the necklace into his pocket.
Harry grabbed Draco's shoulders, suddenly very determined to make him realized it wasn't all his fault, "You wouldn't be telling daddy no. You would be telling one of the darkest, scary looking wizards of all time no. Like I have mentioned over and over again, you were a kid. You were a seventeen year old child who was scared out of their mind. You did what any Slytherin would have done. You saved your own hide. I used to think that is extremely cowardice, and I still do to an extent, but when you are put in the situations we were put in, the choices you make can't be held against you. At least not forever."
After stopping for an early lunch, the boys decided to head back to the hotel to not only get away from the stares that seemed to follow them, but also to go through everything that has happened.
Draco looked out at the crowd, catching a set of dazzling green eyes that stood right off the right side of the stage. He tried to keep his eyes on everyone to make sure nothing strange was happening but every time his eyes floated back to Harry’s.
Hermione rubbed her thumb over the back of Harry's hand as she spoke with a small smile, "When did you get so enlightened?"
Five weeks after the Maybelle and David debacle, Draco stood staring up at the solemn panther that sat high above him. Léon - a name chosen drunkenly and in great humor for the panther by Draco and Friends on their latest First Friday night dinner, laid in the tallest tree in the forest readily ignoring Draco and his attempts to interact with the panther.
After four days of being ignored, Harry was getting beyond agitated. He tried cornering Malfoy multiple times the past two days but couldn't ever get him. He finally had his chance again while heading to the kitchens for a late afternoon snack. He was about to pass the entrance of their common room, when the door had swung open, Draco stumbling out, causing Harry to jump slightly. The two looked at each other blankly for a moment before fear over took Draco and relief, which morphed quickly into concern, over took Harry.
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes wrinkling around the edges as he smiles, "No groupies back stage."
in most languages, and not only does it perfectly match the stubborn and unrelenting attitude of the large cat, but it also serves as a great way for Draco to irritate the thing. Which is slowly becoming Draco's favorite pass time.
The panther held his head higher in challenge. Draco only smiled in response.
"I miss you guys." He whispered into the phone, finally turning away from his reflection and out the door.
Harry laughed and lightly bumped his shoulder against the brunette man, "Seems we both got screwed in the name department."
Coming back up Harry shouted, "Alright, alright. I surrender."
Hermione's brown eyes lit up, "Really?"
"Harry."
George clenched his jaw, "Yes, actually. The two boys in question of performing the ritual stopped by. One of them had said something very interesting."
Granger glanced over the sheet. "No, I mean, this is a start. We can look for other options while also looking more into these. Why is one of them crossed out?"
His two co-workers, he noted, seemed to be in a sleep-like trance, if the small smiles and too-relaxed features that graced their faces where anything to go by. As far as Draco could see, there was no physical harm done to either of them. Draco glanced back at the panther. The large cat had his ears perked up and nose risen in the air, looking at Draco with interest and slight curiosity. The moment the cat noticed Draco looking, he quickly turned his head away and began slashing his tail around in annoyance again.
Harry rolled his eyes with a smile, pushing through the doors.
Harry stared for a moment before nodding and heading to the car.
Harry shook his head, for some reason he felt like he needed to stick up for the eccentric old man. Looking at George sadly, he whispered, "No I don't believe he is."
Harry looked over to him, "You said it felt like dark magic?"
“Keep your eyes open, we will figure this out.” Draco whispered back before walking towards the door.
After being in therapy for a few months, his therapist finally persuaded him to return Malfoy's wand. Wanting it to be in a public place and to be over quickly he chose the Three Bread Sticks. The exchange was quick and very silent, only a quick thank you from Malfoy's end and an of course from Harry's. But in that small exchange it didn't seem like any words really needed to be exchanged. That day when Harry saw Malfoy for the first since the trails, he looked hollow. Like any life that once was in the body in front of him had disappeared. The boy was so skinny you could see his ribs through his too big for him muggle T-Shirt. His hair was loose and growing longer than Harry has ever seen on Malfoy. Dark circles were found under his eyes and his already sharp-edged bones seemed to have gotten ever sharper. It was as if Malfoy's body was the personalized version of what the war had done.
"What brings you to the island?" The man asks as an excuse for small talk.
That's why, as he stood in the misty opened floor found in the forefront of the densely packed rain forest-charmed room, he felt true peace washing over himself where most people would only feel fear. Laying in front of him was the large black cat he had rescued only a few hours prior, voided of all restraints except the magical binder. Many people, including the other trainers, call him crazy for never fully binding or chaining up his charges when he has his first interacts with them, but Draco feels it allows the animal to realize that Draco isn't a threat and allows them to not feel trapped, even if they are stuck in a charmed room.
written across a wooden panel. With the rebuilding, they had taken away all the secret doorways and passwords instead adding double doors with magical sensors that only allowed the students that lived in the rooms to open the doors. Harry took a deep breath and walked in.
Dead silence was his only answer for many agonizing seconds, save the footsteps.
Draco threw his head back, “I have to call Maggie.”
The thought was quickly diminished  as Harry realized she would either hound him to come home or Apparate herself out here immediately. Besides, he still has yet to mention that Draco was also here with him. He didn’t exactly want to explain any of that situation to either of his friends, and he knew Hermione would definitely be furious about him with holding that information.
"The decorations are so pretty," He whispered to Draco.
"Ready to go?" Draco asked, trying to slow his heart rate down.
He felt a knee nudging his thigh. Tingles formed around his leg from the soft touch. He opened one eye and saw Draco Malfoy looking at him with humor laced across his face, a single eyebrow raised, "Rough night, Potter?"
Forest mind seemed to go into over drive. All he could say was, "Legend says that when the people of the town first settled here that some source gavr them an oak tree to allow beauty to roam all of the land."
slip into his mind with a frightened sounding Granger voice. What personal stuff could possibly have to do with an overcharged with magic panther?
Harry wasn’t very ecstatic about the idea of staying on the same island as Malfoy but he sure as hell wasn’t going to let Malfoy ruin his vacation. Being stuck on an island with the bully you grew up with wasn’t exactly the plan, but if Harry played his cards right he could find out if Malfoy was the same arse from school.
Suddenly, he slid one of his hands up to Draco's jawline, "You aren't pointy anymore. Your nose is and your cheeks still are a little..."
Harry allowed himself to be pushed out the room, only if he was able to walk along side Draco.
"Then it's a date."
"Well," the man said turning into a smaller road, "Ol' Howler is a big oak in the center of the town here in Hunilaya. Legend says that when the people of the town first settled here that some source gave them the oak tree to allow beauty to roam all of the land." He pulled into an old looking hotel, "Here you are, Mr. Draco." The man pulled out what looked to be a map and a procure, "Here is a map around the island and a pamphlet to explain things around. I hope you have a wonderful stay. My name is Forest, if you need any help just give me a call. My information is on the pack of the pamphlet."
He glanced behind the two Slytherins, noticing how everyone was watching them, even the professors. "Look, I was just going on a walk. Would you like to join me and I can explain? At least, explain what little I know?"
"What about you, Harry?" Luna was asking him.
"Oh... Malfoy! Draco! You were
Stilling his breath, Draco quieted, listening in for any noises, but finding only the noise of soft water flowing and crickets chirping.
Harry swallowed thickly, picking at his nails. "I don't-" He paused unsure on if he should be spilling his secretes to two snakes that he has never once held a conversation with. Knowing they feel for Draco the way he feels for Hermione and Ron, has him continuing, "I've never been in love before. I've never even felt love until-" His closed eye tightly, refusing to let his emotions best him. "I don't exactly know what love is. I can't tell you I love him because I don't know. All I can give you is I would give myself up for him. I would take a bullet for him."
Harry let out a sigh, squeezing the hand that still held Draco's. "I thought I did. I thought I knew exactly where my life would go after, well." He looked out at the dark water. "The future is so weird." He mused.
At first glance the cage looked completely vacant. It wasn't until Draco stepped closer and heard a low growl coming from the far corner that he noticed the large black creature strapped down by shimmering chains. It's ears laid flat against his head, his claws menacingly scratching the floor with razor sharp talons, his tail swung aggravatingly behind him, sending dirt and dust around the cage. The creature's dark green eyes were in slits, daring the two men to come closer.
He dropped his tote on the remaining bed, putting him right next to Malfoy.
When the song ended, Harry realized he was a little sad that there wouldn’t be more. Now that he has heard Malfoy play, he wanted more.
Walking to the elevator, his nerves, that he had hadn’t even noticed until now, hit him full force. He was so caught up in the moment all day yesterday he never realized just how many nerves seemed to run through his body. In every relationship he has been in, he has never felt as high strung as he does when with Draco. Not to say him and Draco were in a relationship, mind you. But they were in something in-between friends and a little more than friends, and Harry found that he didn't mind being in-between as long he got to spend more time with the sarcastic, too-sexual-for-his-own-good boy.
"I know.. It's alright. Come."
They both stopped and Harry chuckled softly.
So, now he sat in the back of the library with a determined Hermione flipping rapidly through multiple different books at once. What she was looking for, he wasn't sure. When Harry was looking earlier he didn't know what he was looking for either but he remembered Hermione saying how every answer can be found in a book of some sort, so he just began looking through any book he deemed would show him an answer.
Luna was in the middle of a speech about some creature her father found, a Narwhal, when Harry interrupted.
Narcissa stood and walked towards him with the same grace and elegance that her son carries. "What are your intentions with my Draco?"
Granger shrugged as she took a seat behind the desk, gesturing Draco to sit as well. "Do you think there is a possibility that Léon is just a panther that just happens to have powers?"
After Harry took few shallow breaths to slow his heart, he pushed his blanket away and slipped off his bed, shivering slightly at the coldness of the wooden floors as he crossed the quiet, dark dorm room and headed to the restrooms.
since.. well since.. never I guess. This is a first for me and I really like it so can we just try and not make it awkward?"
"Quit doing that! Can I see my Veela or not?"
"You know you like it."
Towards the end of the song Malfoy's eyes surged around the room, seeming to be singing to everyone. As the last line was sung, his eyes caught Harry's.
Harry leaned over Draco to see the two girls sitting right across from them. Ginny was sat just as Harry was, with Luna sitting nearly in her lap, playing with her fingers.
Hampton nodded as Harry secretly sulked. He was hoping to see Malfoy's full performance but Hampton had to work later than expected. Of course Harry didn't blame Ham for being late, when a boss says you have to you have to stay, but Harry still wishes he could've heard the other songs.
Draco squinted out towards the area he believed the cat to be in, spotting a small movement among the smallest tree's branches. He took one step closer to the tree.
"Can you quit pacing and calm down?" Hampton, who sat in a worn out green chair, snapped.
Malfoy thumbed through the book, his finger scanning the passages, "Yes, Potter, I am aware but the board's instructions do not go into the details that the book does."
He lifted a hand slowly towards Léon. He hesitated, but threw cation towards the wind he just fell through and touched the panther's soft head. The fur was just as soft as Draco remembered it being a few weeks ago. He slowly began dragging his hand up from the nose that was still pressed against his forehead to in-between the feline's black ears. He lifted his hand and repeated the movement over and over.
An hour later, both boys would be found out in the middle of the water, splashing and joking like they've been best friends for their entire lives.
Forest had driven them to their hotel, but Harry and Draco refused to speak, just letting Forest happily rattled on and on about the beauty of the island.
her scrawny arse." The ever lovely Daphne Moon - née Greengrass - exclaimed.
"No, but thank you, Pans."
Draco scooted closer to Harry, leaning against his bent knee, "Is that you offering to help me, Potter?"
"What did Blaise find." He commanded as soon as Pansy finished her sentence.
When Draco still refuses to look at him, Harry growls, lifting Draco's chin up till their eyes meet.
As Draco stepped out from the trees and into the open floor, he instantly felt eyes on his chest. He continued with his cautious steps until he was in the middle of the floor. He whistled again. "Come on kitty. I'm not going to hurt you, I would just like my friends back."
The frantic girl looked down at her clipboard and then back at the boy, "Maggie will be back next week, but she told me to remind you about the two concerts this weekend and your board meeting is all set up for next week, so she said to be prepared."
Malfoy nodded, brows furled in confusion, "Yes, he's my godfather. I begged him for months to let me use that damn book. Slimy traitor."
"Well, you look strange hiding in a tree."
"Look I should-"
Draco turned towards his companion, jumping slightly at the reminder that he wasn't alone. "Gorgeous. Where did they find him?"
in their full forms, especially keeping up a wall this strong.
person, somehow you have become my everything. I want you so much it hurts, and I am ready to take what ever you are willing to give me."
"You don't have to thank me. Please, don't thank me. I don't deserve it. I was a royal screw up- no, I was worse. I helped them get there, I allowed them to hurt people. To hurt children. You wanna know something that truly makes me sick? I actually believed in what the Dark Lord was saying. I wanted to be able to help my family get our power. To help families like mine who were dying off because of muggles and muggle-borns. Until the end of fifth year, I truly wanted to be one of them. A Death Eater." Draco let out a hollow laugh, "I didn't even know what that word meant. In the middle summer between fifth and sixth, the Dark Lord called me in. When he tasked me to.. when he gave me those orders everything inside me shut down. I knew if I didn't do it.. That entire year it felt like I was under imperio. I wish I was, at least than I would have an excuse for my actions. Giving you that wand.. I know it wasn't much but.. it was something I could do. Something I could do to try and help fix the ginormous mess I created."
"No, Potter, you don't get it.These ingredients are-"
They both jumped back.
Pansy rolled her eyes, leaning back against Neville's chest, "You wouldn't know a thing about fighting, Draco."
"Where is he?" A frantic voice broke through the room. Harry was pulled away from Draco as Madame Pomfrey began running test and mumbling to herself.
"No, I don’t see how that could be possible. Even if he was a muggle that pissed a witch or wizard off, I don’t believe he would possess the amount of power he has. Granger, that cat is lousy with power."
Luckily - or unluckily, Draco couldn't tell, there was no meetings nor scheduled events to go on today, so Draco spent the morning in the Enchanted Rainforest, attempting and failing to talk to the most stubborn cat Draco has ever met.
Giggling, Draco dropped his forehead on Harry's cheek, "My love," He whispered softly, pulling back to look Harry in the eyes. He ran a hand across Harry's bangs, the other laying softly on Harry's waist. "Of course it's alright, I would love nothing more than go on a date with you."
Harry looked deeply into Draco's eyes drowning in the vibrant grey. Without thinking properly he spoke, "Have dinner with me?"
Harry's eyes burned into Hampton's, "You're one of them." He growled.
Harry turned to him, grabbing his chin and bringing his face closer, "What can I say? I don't like to share. Whether you like it or not, Draco Malfoy, you are stuck with me."
Draco spun to face Harry, eyes searching, "How can you say that?
Draco turned towards his door, confused. As the broken words continued, Draco treaded closer to the door, allowing the words to filter in and out of his mind more smoothly.
"Granger." He said sternly.
Not being able to stop himself, Draco leaned in and rubbed his nose against the boys, giving Harry a light eskimo kiss.
Harry shoved the last of his clothes in his bag, "Its happening whether you're sure of this or not."
"You do?"
Harry and Draco stayed silent the rest of the way to the pier.
Taking one last deep breath Harry started for the door.
Before the boy could make a comeback, the lights lowered and the stage light flipped into a lighter shade. Many people started whistling and screaming.
"I don't think it was just a coincidence we were put here, Harry."
Standing in front of them, leaning against the checkout counter was the boy Harry had met when he and Hampton went to see Draco's second show. He was a lot taller than what Harry would've pictured him to be.
"Granger, is everything alright?"
things. Together."
"I think.. I might? I'm honestly not sure. Being roomed with him we have just gotten a lot closer I guess. He isn't really that bad of a bloke anymore. Honestly, I would go as far as saying he is extremely friendly. Which is something I never thought I'd say about Malfoy."
Hampton shrugged, "I guess I'm just not observant. I still don't understand why we can't just stop the curse and protect the tree ourselves. It was given to
Luckily, Ginny and Luna chose that moment to come over to them, so no one but Draco saw how red Harry's cheeks had gotten.
Draco turned his head the other and found himself face to face with the beforementioned insane magical panther. The panther laid with his head laid slightly above Draco's on the ground, soft snores coming from his open mouth. He had his body laying besides Draco's, one paw placed on Draco's arm in a clearly protective manner.
Harry's eyes widened as a dashing smile spread onto his face, "I know! Isn't it fantastic? Ham - can you believe someone would want to go by the name Ham? - anyways Ham said he was going to take me home but he had to use the bathroom and has been in there
Harry instantly stood up, hand on the door knob. intending to march in there and coddle the boy, before he even realized what he was doing. He jerked his hand away and fled as he heard footsteps walking around the room.
thinks he can’t handle a weekend alone.
Harry let out an exasperated groan, "Than what is it, Draco? Why haven't you even looked at me in four -nearly five days?"
She laid a single ticket down in-between them. Before Harry got the chance, Draco grabbed the ticket.
The set began without a hitch. The bar seemed to be even more packed than the night before and much more energetic. Draco was playing a full set tonight- six songs versus only three like the night before.
It's been exactly two weeks since the start of school. Two weeks since Harry saw Fleur in their dormitory, and Harry still has a vault full of unanswered questions. Every day that passes has Harry's mind and body itching for any form of answers.
Harry's jaw clenched, he looked down at his hands that lay on the table, his left hand kneading hard at his right knuckle, not even noticing the foot steps or Hampton's suddenly movements, "What ritual?"
The man wobbled over to Harry with a cane that looked as if he found it in his backyard. "Well isn't this a nice surprise! I haven't had a customer in about five years! What are you in for today, young man?" He looked down at the box Harry was holding, "Ah, bit of a sports guy I see. Well, well why don't you come over here and we can ring you up, hm?" The man turned back towards the checkout counter.
are you so bloody annoying this early while also being extremely hungover?"
When they resurfaced, Harry jumped on top of Draco pushing him back down, while Harry stayed above the water. Little did Harry know, under water Draco grabbed at his feet and pulled him below surface.
Harry stopped speaking and began swaying slightly, his face suddenly going lax and a little grey. He closed his eyes and took a slow, deep breath.
Harry turned and smiled at the sight of Malfoy.
Draco recognized him as the man that was with Harry all night, "This door would not open."
Harry smiled brightly, leaning in and kissing Draco's nose, "Hi, yourself."
He was about to ask again when Hampton suddenly closed his eyes and whispered, "There is a reason we chose the Boy Who Lived and the son of Narcissa Malfoy."
Ever since the Second Wizarding War ended, Hermione has dreamed of going back to finish her studies. For a few months she helped clean up the debris left at the castle from the battle, but soon had to give up as the exhaustion -mentally and physically- from the war kicked in.
Granger mumbled to herself as she walked in, eyes dancing around the floor. She pulled her hair out of the ponytail she had it in, only to fly it up into a messy bun soon after.
Léon sent an innocent look Draco's way as the vines began the slowly snap apart.
robes he wore today? Absolutely dreadful. The color does nothing for his eyes.'" Parkinson mocked, with a smirk.
Draco turned Harry's body, till they were flushed together, "A bit? I think they don't even have heads to be touched. They seem to be headless hands that just throw things together and hope for the best." He sighed, pushing his forehead against Harry's suddenly very serious, "I'm so sorry. For everything you have had to go through. That you continue to go through. I'm so sorry for my involvement in that war. I didn't help back then, but I will help you now. I will do whatever it takes to keep you safe. Especially from the likes of Death Eaters."
As the song went on, the beat began to pick up.
slowly as well. He felt like even his blinks were a second longer than normal. By lunch time, Harry couldn't stop the bouncing of his leg.
"Have you heard from Fleur lately?"
"Yes." George seethed, "The brunette said he needed to speak with you. Said you had given him something important."
written across his face.
"I am aware. I am also aware of you and my son's.. past."
"I'm not a dog, Harry."
Harry looked towards Draco's door, suddenly not wanting this day to end, "What are you doing tomorrow?"
Draco finally moved his eyes away and looked towards the crowd. He began speaking his thank yous and how amazing it is to perform for them. With every other word he couldn't help glancing at the Boy Who Lived Twice.
The women all shared a glance.
Draco has had a long rode with the
"Okay thanks. Tell Maggie I miss her and I hope she's having a great vacation."
Therapy has taught him otherwise. Therapy has shown him that this fascination of wanting to be on the top wasn't just because he liked the praise or the feeling of accomplishing something. This fascination with being on top was a way for Draco to feel unreachable.
"I have this gift where I can send emotions, send thoughts from just a touch. We had to find someone to complete a ritual to keep the tree alive. The ritual.. they didn't tell me the full truth of it. The truth of what it entails. I found out this morning and-"
"Potter."
The next few days were spent in quiet observation and complete confusion for Harry, even more than they usually were. Draco - yes, his mind seemed to be adamant about referring to the blue-haired boy as such -  seemed to be ignoring him. He has caught glimpses of the boy on multiple occasions dodging around corridors and into classroom just to not have to be in the presence of Harry. Even in classes they shared, Draco stays far away from him, refusing to even glance his way. In their rooms, he left before anyone got up and went to bed after everyone was asleep. It was beginning to agitate Harry to no end.
He shook his head, "I'll be alright, 'Mione." He kissed the top of her head and walked towards the doors.
The drummer Harry recognized from Draco's second performance walked through, he swaggered over to the two, glancing at Harry but eyes stayed glued to Draco.
Harry closed his eyes and roughly dropped his head back on to table. Draco grabbed a plane bagel with a napkin and pushed towards the boy, "Eat. It will help. Some coffee or tea would help too."
Draco sighed as he leaned against the bar. He took one last look around, not seeing Potter for once, he decided to start heading towards the exit. Pushing the door open, he nearly hit someone square in the face.
Harry's heart froze yet ran seventy miles an hour at the sight when he looked up at Harry.
"Ready?" Hermione asked with a bright smile. Today was the first day she would be seeing Ron since school had started, and Harry could tell she was trying to conceal her excitement.
*****
"Why weren't home? Isn't it like almost two in the morning over there?"
"Yes, it's fine. Everything is, well, it's just-"
He walked through the back door, spotting Draco instantly. He was sitting on the bench placed against the wall in the middle of the dimly-lit hallway.
Harry nearly fell out of his seat as the song ended and the applause erupted. Harry turned to look at the crowd and then back at the artist. He leaned even further onto the table he was already half leaning on as Malfoy started up the next song.
McGonagall explained that Quidditch teams would be picked by the teachers this year, instead of the oldest students. The teams would be a collection of students from each dormitory instead of houses.
The beach was fairly empty this afternoon, except for the few people who were building up a tall bonfire stack a little ways away.
conversation that didn't end in a fist fight or cruel words.
"My cat?"
I hope you enjoyed it! Comments and Kudos always welcomed!
Harry couldn't bring himself to mind.
In a split second, Harry's eyes meet Malfoy's. Fury ran all over Harry's face.
He turned back to Harry, who was still holding his sleeve, "I’ll explain in a little bit."
, she had said,
"I think it's Fleur's little sister, Gabriella Delacore."
Harry fell silent. A few moments passed. Harry was the first to speak.
Draco nodded, "Mhm, I had Dippy, Bozier, Spunk, Gall and Dobby. But the weirdest thing happened, Dobby had randomly disappeared, which is basically unheard of for house elves. When I tried to ask my father he just began rambling about stupid children."
Draco turned towards Harry, grabbing his hand that had begun wringing out the other, "Are you okay?"
Draco stopped, "Please, for the love of all things good, don't call me that either. Call me Draco." The blonde quickly nodded and Draco walked on.
George Foster rolled his eyes as he looked at his distant cousin, "I told you there was something wrong with that boy. How could you not feel the power? He was sitting right next to you?"
With every word Draco's face became redder and redder.
*****
"Mister Malfoy." The tallest of the three spoke.
"Not a clue."
Not sure if I will ever finish it, I simple fell out of the world many months back and can’t bring myself to write and post something mediocre for the sake of finishing it!
Draco stared into the cat's eyes, slowly coaxing the feline's mind open, but with no luck. As he probed at the panther's mind, he felt a strong wall surrounding it in it's entirety.
Looking at the animal, now vacant of all chains, he was able to see just how beautiful the panther really was. His short black fur sat on top of even blacker skin which outline every inch of the cat's taunt muscles. Even in the panther's stillness you could see the large amounts of muscles laying underneath the soft fur, can feel the hostile energy radiating off the slumbering beast.
Hermione chuckled,
Hermione stepped in front of the bag Harry was packing, "And why this spontaneous trip, huh? Why alone?" She stepped closer to the boy, "You know they haven't caught them all."
Draco startled as the cloud slowly began to move downward, disappearing entirely as he was placed onto the soft, damp forest floor. A large black orb peered over Draco's head, blocking the afternoon sun. Draco's eyes had to adjust to the shade that the orb provided.
Hermione nodded as they stopped in front of the hospital wing doors.
Harry looked towards Draco, taking in how the pale boy seemed to shine in the bright mid-morning sunlight, "So what drew you to music?"
Daphne smirked, "Have you seen my wife? Smokin'. Also, she matches my crazy."
. Harry put his head between his knees.
staring at him that way made his whole body feel like it was thrown into freezing cold water, yet it also made him feel as though the sun collided with his chest somehow. When he sang that last line, catching Harry's eyes, the felt completely, totally bewitched.
Once they all settled in, Fleur was the first to speak, "Harry, Draco has had a very, how do you say.. traumatizing experience since the months after the war. Since his birthday. I know you know of the Veela blood that runs through my veins, I don't keep that hidden, but Draco, his family holds the same blood." She paused, waiting for a sign of acknowledgement. Harry nodded, and she continued. "The blood that runs through his veins is much different than mine, however. The Malfoy family is very old family, with many things laced in it. As far as I know, the Malfoy's haven't had a true Veela in centuries, that is until Draco."
"Thank you." He said, firmly.
Both boys were kneeling down, allowing the water to come up to their collarbones.
"The building is spelled, Harry." Draco whispered in his ear.
"Have anything exciting happening this weekend?" He asked after he swallowed his last bite.
Today, it looked the complete opposite. It looked exactly how Draco's office often looked, tea cups and coffee mugs placed haphazardly on flat surfaces, piles of books thrown on tables, a few even thrown on the floor, open magazines spread out on Granger's desk, one of which had a deep ink stain due to the inkwell tipping over.
The boardwalk was across the island, so a taxi was needed. Luckily, one was right outside the hotel open for any guest who needed transport. Most of the ride was spent with the friendliest and most informative small talk Harry had ever been apart of.
The moment Draco’s eyes rolled back, Harry jumped onto the stage and caught him.
He walked back towards the castle. Harry stared down at where Malfoy had touched him, relishing in the fire that even that small touch provided, before he realized what Malfoy had said.
Draco's mouth opened but before he could know what was being said, the scene shifted again, this time putting him back to where the little boy was sitting against the wall. This time, however, there was a long stroke of blood across his shirt.
Harry looked thoughtful as he answered, "Honestly, I am not really sure. I was extremely wasted the night I decided to travel somewhere's. I somewhat remember being at a bar at some restaurant and someone telling me about an Island of Dreams. All I really know is that I had woken up the next morning with a plane ticket booked here and decided hey, the ticket was already booked so why not go."
He found quite quickly that sleep can only give answers if one actually sleeps.
"This has officially gone from weird, to straight up creepy." Draco whispered.
There was a pause, Harry almost backed away, afraid they were about to leave the room, but then a soft, broken voice spoke. Harry had to strain to hear what he was saying, only being able to make out every other word.
Léon let out a soft mournful yowl, placing his nose on Draco's forehead. Draco had to close his eyes and take a deep breath as not only the intense emotions he had just had to go through crashed into him, but also the soothing magic that was washing over him soothed his aches.
Harry was silent for a long time, thinking over everything Draco said. His hands were stroking Draco’s lower back and ass; he could feel himself getting hard again.
“Good.”
His back was small, his waist slim and his legs long, Harry noticed. He was noticing a lot about men now that he had the freedom to look. Draco Malfoy had inherited his mother’s beauty.
Draco looked at him for what seemed like an eternity, his grey eyes sharp, calculating. Harry was fully prepared for Draco to just leave him standing there without an answer. But Draco had always surprised Harry, not always in a good way, mind you, but the fact still stood.
Visions No. 33 and No. 34 were still in the studio, sitting side by side. When Draco was up there—and he spent most of his time up there—it was like they were sucking him in. Something about the flowers, the forest, and the unfinished edges were calling to him. It felt familiar, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.
Harry's eyes snapped to his face. “I'm all here.”
“You heard of Origami before, right Po- Harry?”
“At least he’s not homeless,” Harry heard himself say.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “How do you figure that?”
Yes, Harry thought, he did know. “I do.”
Luna nodded. “Yes,“ she answered. “I know exactly what you mean. There is a lot of speculation about the author. And not everyone is convinced it’s a woman, Harry. Why do you think it’s a woman?“
“I can hardly believe we are having this conversation, Draco,” Potter said.
Draco nodded. His wards were part of him. He had created them with parts of himself.
Draco shrugged. “I will feed and then I will feed some more, have sex with you two, and then maybe get in touch with my mother, so she knows I’m alive.”
“Right,“ Blaise said.
“Please don’t start a fight, Harry,” Hermione said.
“You marked me years ago, Harry,” Draco replied softly.
“I don’t like that there has been no new victim in weeks,” Bears said. “And yes, I know exactly how that sounds, Mr. Malfoy,” he added, probably because Draco had given him a look. Draco was good at giving people looks.
Draco gave he another look. “No. No killing.” Draco didn’t think he had the stomach for that. Merlin, he wanted to, he really did want to make that prick disappear, but having to keep that secret as well? Having to keep that secret from Harry? No, that wasn’t an option at all.
Harry grabbed him by the neck and kissed him hard. “Yes.”
“Did you want to be in Slytherin?” Potter asked.
Harry swallowed and scooted another few feet away. The temptation was too much otherwise.
As soon as he kneeled Draco’s hands were on him again: in Harry’s hair, caressing his neck, his arms, his chest, tweaking a nipple none too gently.
“It was bad,” Draco admitted. “But I didn’t die.”
“Henri,” Draco said. He gave a nod of acknowledgment to the other three men in the hall.
“Well, you are good looking, curse your beautiful mother,” Draco replied.
“Great. Wonderful. I guess I’ll never get to touch anyone, and then die,” Draco said.
The boy stepped closer. Harry stood his ground. The boy laughed quietly and sniffed at Harry's
Neville nodded. “He’s broke, really, it’s the only asset he has. Maybe he lives there now, who knows.”
Potter choked on his bite. “She is not.”
“But,” Bears said, frowning down at the parchment, “Mr. Malfoy died and came back. That was not supposed to happen.”
Ivan gave him a thumbs up the next morning.
“Maybe I am one,” he replied.
“So, I didn’t know how to ask this before, but how are things in the wizarding world when it comes to guys well, liking guys?” Harry asked and didn’t look at Neville.
“Is he?” Harry asked. He didn’t know why he felt this excitement deep down in his bones.
“That is why we, and with we I mean the younger teachers, encourage mingling and interhouse friendships,” Neville added.
“Just telling it like I see it,” Draco replied and handed Potter another two cakes on a plate.
“What then?”
“Fuck,” he said as he toed off his shoes. Was Draco really willing or did he feel like he hadn’t had the choice?
“I would leave it with you.”
“Yes. They lost track of you one night, and I think your magical signature is different now.”
“Yes.”
It should not have surprised Draco to find Potter on his doorstep the next day, but it did. He looked at Potter, and his forest-green eyes looked steadily back at him.
“It’s a first-year spell and not that complicated.”
“I don’t know. I just painted it,” he answered.
“I don’t know. I think it might have been a woman,” Draco replied after a short silence.
When he had been a kid, he hadn’t really grasped the way Potter had been brought up by his relatives, but he had studied the unofficial biographies of Potter ever since (like the obsessive thing that he was). He didn’t believe everything he read there, but with Potter here and his habits so on display, his childhood traumas (small they might have been compared to what came later) were hard to miss.
“You’ll let me watch?” He asked: his voice sounded funny even to his own ears.
“Maybe,” Antoine replied. “Maybe it was just five minutes ago.”
“Yes, we are, aren’t we?”
“We're about to destroy a kingdom,” Harry replied.
“Partly, I guess. It was like you suspected: it started with Muggles, but it was soon pretty clear that the murders had been magical,” he smiled wryly. “Magical murders...”
“It’s one of them,” Antoine replied.
“Great,” Harry said. “This weekend? I’ll send an owl?”
“Draco,” he said and didn’t know what to follow that up with. Maybe he didn’t need to add anything to it, the word was a plea on and in itself.
Draco swallowed. “Dumbledore hopefully rots in hell right now. He deserves it for leaving you with those hateful people.”
Antoine laughed. “Such anger.”
Harry’s fingers clawed first at the sheets and then at Draco’s skin.
“I kind of thought there might be,” Harry admitted.
“You mean you can fix this for you,” Draco said.
the note read.
Thompson let the interruption go. He knew that the Ministry needed Draco more than Draco needed the fucking Ministry. As far as Draco knew, he was the only real Seer in this part of the world. Draco also knew that Thompson would love to see him locked up.
Draco turned to look at him and Harry had to kiss him. The kissing felt familiar and not. Draco’s mouth was hot, but his skin was cool. Not cold, but just a bit cooler than your average human’s.
“You used to do that, back at that place.”
Pansy gasped. “Draco—"
“Really, and I know you love me too,” Harry said.
Pansy shrugged. “Maybe to people who know you, maybe to people who know Potter. But I wouldn’t worry about that part, because everyone and their grandmother think they know Potter. All the biographies that came out after the war and the millions of newspaper articles. The boy who wouldn’t die,” she said the last words with a touch of doom in her voice and then smiled at Draco.
“I’ll look into everyone who has or had contact with this case.”
“I think you're right,” Draco said, not that he cared much.
“Are you sure that it killed everyone?” Potter asked suddenly.
“He needs to face justice for what he’s done,” Harry said.
“I know."
“And he was the one on the side of the angles,” Draco said.
“Julien is nowhere to be found,” Auror Bain said. “He’s either on the run or dead. We are trying to find him, but we have Lerch in custody. He’s stonewalling us. Hasn’t said a word.”
“Will you?” Antoine asked, smiling.
“I didn’t think you would want to. Bears seemed pretty sick after seeing it,” Draco replied.
“Than I was this morning?”
“I know you are. I just wanted to put it out there. We’re a team now, right?”
Harry let him lead the way.
“And?” Harry asked.
“He’s obsessed with you, Mr. Malfoy,” Bain said.
“I thought after ten years we could have a civilized conversation,” Potter said.
It was sixth year all over again, but worse. Harry could admit that to himself. It was also not sixth year again exactly, because he knew that Draco wasn’t planning anything evil. Harry was obsessed with Draco, because he was obsessed with Draco.
Blaise nodded. “Of course, I do, Draco. I guess I was just wondering if you have done any of those delightfully filthy things with him yet. You know the ones you write so sensually about?”
“It took me a long time to figure it out, but the Auror training helped. It’s part disdain and part ownership.”
“From what I’ve heard, you’re doing alright for yourself.”
While half his brain was paying attention to the conversation going on around him, the other half was chewing on No. 33 and 34. Was Potter in these pictures because he’d been there too? Seen what Draco had seen all those years ago? Obviously, Potter hadn’t been—his mind shied away from a word for it, but yes, obviously Potter hadn’t. Potter’s magic was strong, but not like Draco’s. Draco’s was scary sometimes, or used to be at least, before he'd tucked himself away and mastered it. Now it didn’t need more than a focused thought for him to make things happen. And if people knew this...well. He glanced down at the Dark Mark on his arm. It wasn’t moving anymore, and he'd added bits and pieces to it so it wasn’t as ugly as it used to be, but if you looked for it you could see its shape under the beauty he piled on top of it. In the end, he thought wryly, it's just like me.
“Sit down?”
“Aren’t I?” Harry replied.
“I should hex you Potter,” Draco said, and he sounded weary. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. “But I guess then I would be the one blamed for attacking the hero of the Wizarding world.”
Antoine smiled again, that smile, that beautifully sharp smile. “Don't you know?”
Draco waved his hand like that would explain anything. “Things just come to me.“
Antoine nodded and led Draco to one of the bedrooms. There were only two. Harry was pretty sure Draco and Antoine would share a bed.
“I’ve seen it before, I think,” Harry looked up from the scar and into Draco’s eyes. There were questions there and Draco didn’t want to answer them. Hadn’t thought he would have to answer them truthfully. But seeing Harry’s eyes now he knew he couldn’t lie to Harry. Harry had been lied to more than enough in his short life.
He felt ruined, in the best way possible.
“But you’re a victim and I am not?”
“Draco, wait,” Harry yelled after him.
Draco took a poppyseed pastry and bit into it. Harry was watching him eat.
“Sit down, Harry,” Draco said gently and motioned to the chair close to the bed.
“Yes, in hindsight it is,” Draco answered.
“Her findings differ from Julien’s,” Draco said and handed him the letter he had been studying.
Harry blinked up at him again, but then grabbed his wand and locked the door. Draco could feel the magic tightening around them. Harry’s magic was strong, and Draco was sure he hadn’t only locked the door, but probably the windows as well. No one would be able to get inside until Harry unlocked the room. Good, Draco thought.
“Add another,” Draco ordered and Harry did. Draco closed his eyes in bliss. He was just so fucking beautiful.
“We are, Harry,” Draco said and didn’t wonder about that tender note that had crept into his voice.
Harry thought that was a good thing.
“They seem good for each other,” Potter replied.
“Tea is ready in the parlor,” Luna said from the door to the kitchen. Pansy was nowhere to be found, as she did not like even breathing the same air as Ministry officials. Draco normally didn't either, and he would have been fine serving them nothing at all in the kitchen, but Luna had better manners than the both of them.
Draco could only agree, but once this was over, he would find that scumbag who took a photo of the sleeping Krabat and sold it to the fucking Prophet and then he might advise the widow to sue the Prophet as well.
She nodded, then reached out and touched his arm gently. “He’ll be fine, don’t worry.”
“I hardly think me being an erotica writer and me working for the Dark Lord are the same things, Blaise.”
“I saw you reading Voyages with Vampires,” Antoine said.
“We’re in this together now, Harry,” Antoine answered.
“Draco,” he said, because other words failed him. There was no way to describe it, but he hoped that Draco knew how good he felt around Harry’s cock. He took a moment to just breathe once he bottomed out.
“So, and now we’re done,” he said the evening they dealt with the last person who had worked at facility.
“Well, that you would fall for him? Yes. That he might fall for you? No. He never gave me anything else than straight vibes, but that was probably because he hadn’t really had the time to explore what else he might like.”
Which was a pretty accurate description of Malfoy’s life after he turned sixteen, Harry thought.
“And I didn’t know he was your lover,” Harry said, the ‘because you didn’t tell me a thing’ was strongly implied.
Before Harry could so much as blink Draco was on him again. His mouth against Harry’s, his hands roaming Harry’s skin under his soft t-shirt. He arched into it.
“Did you sleep with him?”
'I was looking for you.’ was on the tip of his tongue, because that was what he had been doing. He hadn’t admitted it to himself until this very moment, but yes, Harry came to the manor in the vague hope that Draco would be here. But it would be stupid to tell Draco that, wouldn’t it? In the past it had never paid off for either of them to show vulnerability to the other.
“Out of curiosity, I will let you in, Auror Potter,” Draco answered, and made room for Potter to get inside.
“It was his spell, his ritual, his idea,” Draco countered. “He sought me out to make me fall in love with him. He had a following, ready to murder me for the power slumbering in my heart, Potter. Of course he is still alive.”
“What will you two do?”
“And that man being Draco Malfoy, war criminal and former Death Eater will make things worse.”
Draco nodded. “Yes.” His skin was flushed and he looked very hot.
“Have you been with a man before, Potter?”
“Fine, not Goyle then. What about the others?”
“Been close to him before he died,” Potter finished.
Harry kissed him, this kiss was tender and nearly shy. “I will say yes?” Harry asked teasingly.
Potter hadn’t said a single word to him yet, but he had greeted Luna warmly, which had been expected. He and Potter had parted on civil terms after the war was over, but they had never been friends. As Draco wasn’t going out much these days, he hadn’t had the pleasure to see Potter on the other side of the street and nod at him politely, either.
“Why not stay in instead?”
“Are you going to tell Henri about this?” Pansy was still standing in the door, not coming any closer, like maybe if she did the painting would devour her. It certainly looked alive and mean; but in the end, it was just a painting.
“Ah, so true,” Blaise agreed. “Better you keep your tiny flat with the very comfortable sofa, so I have a refuge when I need it.”
In that moment Draco’s heart skipped a beat. His mind flashed for the first time since he was fifteen to carnal pleasures.
Neville sighed. “I can see that look on your face.”
“It’s not pretty.”
Which was exactly what he would tell anyone who wanted to start something with him.
“What?”
Well, Draco thought two days later as his back was against the wall and Weasley’s wand was digging into the tender skin of his throat, he should have seen that coming.
Harry had no idea what to even reply to that. He was him and he was not going to kill Draco Malfoy or anyone else really, out of revenge.
Draco smiled, sharp but amused. “Ownership,” he said and shook his head. “And you like it?”
“More than one,” Draco said and then tried to focus, “Three.”
“Soon.”
“A lot of people would disagree with you there.”
“I will find out what you did to him,” Weasley said.
“Thank you,” he said.
“Your first book was published four years ago,” Harry said.
Harry swallowed his bite and looked at Antoine, but not into his eyes. There was something about vampires being able to make you do things. Draco had...Harry couldn’t quite remember, but he remembered enough to know that he had been annoyed with Draco because of it. He rubbed the scar absentminded.
“You don’t want us to be seen kissing?”
Harry looked at Draco. His pale skin, his straight nose, his lashes. His face was so soft and young after he just woke up.
“You see, your ritual worked." Draco explained casually. "There was a massive amount of power released and it needed to go somewhere. It also seems that I was the only vessel for it. It didn’t only give me the side effects you pretended to cure.”
“Isn’t it fair?” Draco asked. “You did the same to me.”
It was power, of course, but it was more than that. It was power that Draco was very aware of and very aware that he couldn’t, no matter what, abuse.
“That is quite an arsenal,” Antoine said, impressed. It was true too. Harry had a lot of explosives and other useful 'toys' to break into a secure place and get out as well, but he did hope that there would be Floo access in the building. Because there sure as hell would be anti-apparation wards.
“Draco?” Harry asked and then his eyes went sharp. It would have been scary that gaze if Draco wouldn’t have known that it wasn’t directed at him.
Harry stared at him, his green eyes first lighting up then going dark with anger, as piece by piece of clothing fell to the hardwood floor. Draco could have done it with a thought, but this had more impact, and that was what he needed now. He needed Harry to see. To see him and what Joel had done to him. He hadn’t let anyone look at his naked body in a long, long time, but he himself looked at it regularly. He traced the shapes of the symbols that were scars now, staring at himself in the mirror sometimes for hours.
“Yes,” Draco heard himself say. And wasn’t that the kicker? It had only been a few hours and Harry had been upstairs sleeping the sleep of the well fucked. He was really in deep, but that was okay, because he knew that Harry was in deep as well.
“Aren’t you angry?”
Draco rubbed at his eyes. “I need a shower.“
Her eyes were sharp as she smacked his leg with her walking cane. “No such thoughts, young man!”
“Harry still sleeping?”
“I’m pretty sure I’m beyond help by now,” Harry replied.
“You look worried Potter,” Draco said and his tone gave nothing away.
Luna made a noise and Draco looked at her. “Since you started working with the Ministry of Magic, you've never once painted Harry. I mean, you've never painted or sketched or doodled Harry, Draco. You even doodled Mr. Starlord, and you hate Mr. Starlord, but never Harry.”
“The thing I realised when I got older, Draco, is that I am excited by dangerous things.”
“Thank you, Luna,” he said, handing the mug back to her. “I think I should probably go.”
“I know it isn’t,” Draco said, closing his eyes briefly.
“You really are something else, Potter,” he said and Harry thought that it was Draco who brought that out in him. It had always been Draco for better or for worse.
“I don't like the look in your eyes, Mister Potter,” Antoine said.
“Well, it was bound to bite you in the ass sooner or later,” Pansy said.
She sighed. “Julien found something about that mark on that poor boy’s face,” she said and handed him the document. “I know you will share it with Malfoy and I agree that he can be an asset in this case, but I don’t think you should trust him.”
“You don’t decide my worth, Weasley,” Draco replied and then stepped away, slowly. There was still a chance he might get hexed by Granger after all.
“Why are we talking about it then?” Draco asked. “There are still lessons to learn.”
“Is there such a thing?” Harry asked, but it surely felt like it. He could feel last night with Draco in every cell of his body. It was humming under his skin and in his bones and his tender ass. It was a good tenderness and he would do it again.
“Another conquest that didn’t want to leave?“ Draco asked.
Harry pulled him closer and kissed him hard. “There is a whole future ahead of us now Draco.”
Harry swallowed. The answer was both. “Both?”
Harry had of course never thought about it that way, but that was most likely because everyone he had met that first year had been biased towards Slytherin in one way or other. They had seemed cruel, aloof and distant.
“You are welcome Draco,” Harry said.
“You will help me then?” Harry wanted to know. He was a bit desperate, because he had been looking for a vampire for over three months now. Stalking clubs and churches and Merlin forbid graveyards. Fancy Ministry parties as well. And he hadn't been able to talk to a vampire until now and realized he had been stalking the wrong one too. If he weren't beyond that he would be blushing now. But mistakes and failures have been a part of his life for a long time now.
“Touch yourself,” Harry said, harshly.
“Thank you, Luna.”
Antoine was at his side in mere seconds. It was strange that this inhuman speed didn't scare Harry at all. If anything he found it exciting.
“Later, upstairs,” Harry answered. His hand was running down Draco’s spine, lingering here and there on a magical symbol that was forever carved into his skin. It made Draco shiver. Every touch was making him shiver because he had been deprived of it for so long. Harry’s lips followed the path of his hands until he was kneeling behind Draco. The kiss to his arse cheek was unexpected, but not unwelcome.
“I didn’t lie when I said I could fix this for you.”
Incredibly, Potter laughed. “I like that about you. I think I kind of liked it about you in school, too.”
failed, Draco gave up, but only in order to search for another way to get the cat to show him more.
Turning around a tall bush, he slammed himself straight into something tall and hard. Whatever it was toppling over him, landing directly onto his chest. Draco closed his eyes as his lightheaded-ness morphed into a full-blown migraine.
After Hermione had dropped the bomb about the little girl being Fleur's little sister, Harry began searching more to see if it was true. With a closer glance, he began seeing the resemblance, with further digging he found that it truly was Fleur's sister. Since that day after potions, Harry hasn't gotten the chance to properly talk to Hermione about that situation nor the Malfoy one. He was a little glad he hasn't be able to yet because he is still on the fence about whether he should mention his Malfoy situation and about Fleur being in their room the first day of the semester or not. Seeing as Draco and the girl seemed intertwined, he figured he would have to tell her.
"'Did you see how
Harry jerked his head up to look at Malfoy. Did he just joke? With him? Make a joke to
"She loves sunsets, or used to I'm not sure how she feels of them now, but one day before sixth year, before everything had happened, she showed me this secrete enchanted door that lead to a beautiful hill site with a never ending sunset." He smiled softly before his face began to fall, "I told her how scared I was. How I felt I couldn't do it. She took me in her arms, placed a flower in my hair and told me that I had to remember that while a sunset marks the end of a new day, it is also the beginning of a very, very bright and powerful sunrise."
wouldn't even look at me today and I was wearing my most expensive cloak. I bet he couldn't even tell the difference between Twilfitt and Malkins'"
If the panther heard Draco's words, he made no move to acknowledge them.
Harry only half heard what the other boy was saying. Malfoy was nearly pressed solidly against Harry's side, causing Harry to loose his breath. Every place his roommate was touching felt like fire shooting into Harry's skin. Fire so warm and inviting, Harry found himself leaning in towards the boy.
"Oh."
Harry picked up a fry, "He is just some guy I met the night of your first performance."
"Well," The man, Ham, he assumed spoke, "I better be getting this one back to the hotel. I think he had a little too much to drink." He lightly grabbed Harry's hand and walked towards the small parking lot that was on the side of the bar.
It was strange seeing the room in such a mess. Even though Draco is used to these kinds of messes, it still made his skin crawl and he felt a desire to clean.
Draco glanced around the boardwalk, finding that majority of the people on the pier were stopped looking at them with confusion and disbelief laced across their faces. Many were whispering to each other while glancing at the pair every few seconds, some even pointing. A few workers in the bakery next to them were unashamedly staring at them, customers forgotten.
The panther's breathing slowed down with every soft, enchanted word Draco spoke. Draco stared down into the darkened green eyes, pushing calming thoughts to the forefront of his mind, letting them slip from his to the black cat's blocked off one. The cat's eyes slowly closed.
Harry wanted to chase after him, wanted to let him know that it's okay, he wanted to comfort the boy who had just been in his embrace. But he didn't. The brokenness in Draco's voice, the confusion in the words, stopped Harry from moving, stopped Harry from breathing, with Draco gone it seems as though it stopped Harry from being..
"He just apologized to me."
Draco shivered slightly, unconsciously moving closer to Harry so there shoulders pressed together, "Hopefully it's not the end of the world. Been through that once, don't ever want to go through that again."
"I love you guys."
Harry smiles and nodded. Feeling that if he didn't watch the performance Ham would continue to stare and question, he finally looked up as the song came to an end.
Draco clutched Harry's hand tighter, giving Ham the signature Malfoy sneer that Harry hasn't seen in years. Harry realized he kind of liked it when that look wasn't pointed at him.
Harry nodded, looking up towards Draco, only slightly glancing towards the other man, "Yeah, I'm just excited to see you perform."
Turning his mind quickly away from the thought, he picked up a fairy wing and placed it in pot.
When they were half way through their peaceful breakfast, Draco pulled out the brochure that Forest had given him when he arrived.
A still silence took over them, the only noise was the wind blowing through the bushes.
"Listen," Malfoy sighed, seeming exasperated, "We had hard times. It was war. You had your people to protect and I had my own. You had expectation to live up to. I did too."
When the cat began breathing harder, Draco slowly sat up and turned to face the cat, petting him soothingly. "Léon, it's okay, hey.. everything-"
He continued breathing for a moment, not trusting himself to speak. "Harry.." the voice said softly.
Draco leaned back in his chair, sliding his feet elegantly on top of his desk and crossing his ankles. "Now, Granger, you know I am extremely professional. I bet you fifteen Galleons that if you looked up professional in one of your many, many books you will see my dashing face, smiling brightly."
Potions the next Friday was one of the worst ones yet. Harry couldn't focus, he constantly was looking back towards Draco. He was worried for the stupid prat. His eyes looked sunk-in, his lips chapped, his cheek hollow. It looked as if with one hard swoop of wind, the boy would collapse or fly away with the wind. Harry felt icky about listening in on the private conversation he heard last Saturday. He tried to wash the ickiness away but it never worked. Every time he saw the boy or saw something of the boy's or saw something that reminded him of the boy the ickiness intensified.
Draco stood on stage, strumming his guitar, singing the last line of his set. The crowd cheered as he said his goodbyes, chanting,
Draco walked in silence for a minute before asking, "How do you know Forest?"
Draco laid back on his towel, watching the sunset beside him. Looking at the beautiful mix of blue, pinks and oranges, he couldn't help but think back on something his mother once told him, a few weeks before his sixth year began.
A full laugh jumped out of Draco at the movement. "Okay, Okay." He chuckled as the cat licked his face again. "You're forgiven, kitty. You're forgiven."
Even with every ounce of him telling him that even though this Malfoy looks different, it is
George turned, heading back to the counter, "Or something. Many of the women who have lived here were witches but there isn't many of them left, you see."
Harry sighed, "I guess I can live with you in mine as well." He thought for a moment. "You keep saying 'choose'.. I thought he doesn't have a choice in the matter?"
Harry continued to focus on his breathing as he leaned back against the hard chest behind him, "He told me.. he pushes me away.. the last time we got close, he almost knocked himself out trying to get away from me and he kept saying that he can't control it.. he looked terrified and he just kept apologizing.
forcibly looked away, Harry realized that the classroom was now void of all students, with only Slughorn sitting at his desk. Harry turned back to Draco - because for some reason his mind can't stop with the Draco - and realized they were almost chest to chest. Harry bounced back quickly, as Malfoy did the same.
did you do!?"
He wasn't sure how long they were there, Léon pressing his nose against Draco's forehead and Draco petting him, eliciting the most calming sounds of purring from the large cat, but when Draco finally moved again his legs were stiff and his back and arse ached more than usual.
Malfoy looked towards Harry with a worried glance. "What's wrong?"
He glanced towards the light before looking back to the panther, who he noticed was void of his binding collar. "Hm. I see you didn't like your jewelry. You could've just told me it wasn't your style. You didn't have to lock your room and steal some of my co-workers to show how much you didn't like the restraint."
"His hair." He heard his best friend, Hermione, whisper.
Hey y'all! I have had this idea floating around for a while so I decided to just write it out and see how it goes! I will be making up a few spells and incantations and thing because, well, I can. I am not the best at incantations nor Latin so if the Latin is off or incorrect I apologize.
"Forest," Harry started, "The island is very beautiful."
"Who said I was hiding?" Malfoy asked as he turned a page in his book.
"You do know you only get more wet when you go underwater, right?"
"Hey Herm."
George Foster paced in front of the fire at his uncle's tiny home.
Harry’s eyes hardened. “You’re a liar. Tell me what’s wrong with him, make him better. Please,” He said brokenly, “I can’t loose him, Ham. Please...”
Draco turned his head to look up at Harry, "How so?"
There was a small pause as Harry processed the information, most of which he had already figured out on his own. "And.. I'm his mate."
Harry reached a hand up and cupped Draco's cheek.
He grabbed a leaf and conjured it into a thick looking rag. The necklace still felt hot through the rag when he picked it up but it was a little more bearable. He wrapped the rag tightly around it and stuff the necklace in the pocket that was farthest from Draco, sliding his wand in the other.
As George reluctantly sat back down, their uncle began speaking in a small voice.
"-can't. You know that." A strong french-accented female voice rang out.
"I'm just thinking about something my mother once told me."
The second Draco lifted his wand, the panther lunged towards the bars, growling and attempting to claw at the air. The chains' shimmering effect halted and then sparked, the cat falling back towards the ground in a whimper as the shock the chains threw subsided.
Harry backed away slowly as Hampton and the lady struck up a conversation, eager to find Draco and
Harry was forced to stay outside the infirmary while Pomfrey continued treatments. He reluctantly complied. He wasn't sure how long he sat there staring at the large wooden doors, but when Madame Pomfrey, along with Fleur and McGonagal came through, his whole body was aching.
Leaving the plane was a lot less thrilling as getting onto it.
He would say in potions.
Harry grabbed his phone from his dresser, "Cells, Herm."
"Draco," he responded, handing the man his bags. They both got into the car and the man started up his engine.
"Still wondering if that's a good thing or not." Blaise spoke.
Draco's grey eyes suddenly felt very wet, and not just from the ocean. He quickly looked down at the water so Harry wouldn't see the tears that had begun collecting.
The day passed uneventfully. Harry, of course, became a third wheel after they left the pub, so he excused himself and walked around the streets aimlessly. He stopped at a few shops, though he only ended up buying candy from
"But what happens if they don't hear it? Or if both hear it?"
Draco smirked, raising an eyebrow at the drummer's backside, then continued on his way.
He drew out Draco's name in a way that almost had Draco's knees shaking. Draco nodded numbly and shut his dressing rooms door, leaning against trying to even out his breath.
Draco smiled at him, "Yes sir it is!"
He turned to the others that were waiting by the door way with worried looks, "You guys go ahead." Luna and Ginny nodded solemnly, walking out the door. Malfoy stood, eyes filled with regret and sorrow, looking at Harry and the girl. His lips thinned and with a slight nod, followed the girls.
Every time he has seen the boy in the past few days, Draco has looked worst and worst. His skin is constantly pale and slightly blue, his eyes stay blood shot with dark moons under them, his cheeks constantly hollowed out. Seeing Draco like that has begun making Harry sick. With every ounce of his being he wanted to wrap the boy up and force him to take care of himself. It shattered Harry's heart, Harry's
Harry shrugged, biting his toast, "Just wondering. She still teaching, right?"
Zabini chuckled, "Pans, if you think that you have another thing coming. After all this Draco is coming in
Harry reached out, but Malfoy turned to the painting with a heavy breath, "No, it's- you should be angry." Draco held his breath, letting it out slowly a few seconds later. "I'm not sure what you know about that night.. about that year, but I didn't want to do it. I never- I couldn't.. Aunt Bella had my mother captive. The Dar-
Malfoy left out a heartless laugh, "Snape.. He took an oath. Took an Unbreakable Oath to protect me. To finish out my mission if I failed. That's why he did it. To protect me. Not only that but to protect his stance with the Dark Lord. He knew if the Oath was broken, your side would have no way of knowing what was happening on theirs."
Harry stepped out, looking around. When his eyes landed on Draco, they seemed to brighten and he smiled widely.
