Picking up her son, Lily made her way out the door, and locked it behind her. She shifted towards a nearby alleyway that was simply labelled the apparation point and vanished with a loud crack, landed in Hogsmeade Village almost seconds after.
He kept a neutral expression on his face and walked down each corridor with renewed strides, his eyes darting to each picture on the wall, making sure that they weren’t watching him. While it was impossible for anyone to ever force something out of a portrait, it was possible to coherence it into giving the information.
“There’s something moving out there,” said Ron, using his sleeve to wipe a small patch of condensation off the window. “I think people are coming aboard…”
“For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid’s eyes. “Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you’ll be let out with a full apology…”
“You need to listen more in Potions,” said Harry. “Anyway, looks like everyone else is leaving and they should be done with the introductory speeches. Hell if I wanted to get dragged into that. I know Snape would, too.”
“They find you attractive,” said Jacob. “They have no idea what to say, so they just agree with you or force your interests.”
Harry gave a soft laugh and glanced at her. “Well, that’s true, but that’s because with potions you need to learn by experience. For example, there’s various methods that you can use to make a potion, and they’ll all work the same, some are just more efficient. When selling potions, you want to save ingredients and improve the quality at the same time, this usually adds to the total brewing time, but at school it’s for grades and we have a limit, so you’ll want to split it in half to reach the time limit, but keep the quality high.”
“I’m not scared of you, I’m scared of him, and do you think I would touch him? He would kill me on the spot. Even if he wasn’t gay I wouldn’t dare touch him in any manner.”
“Recently, it seemed like the entire school finally grew a brain and decided on a truce, which resulted in friendships, more productive classes, less sabotage, and less of a biased attitude. I never thought I would see the day when a Gryffindor actively sought out to help a Slytherin. It was, being honest, a blessing and something I am thrilled to have witnessed.
All the professors besides Professor Snape soon fled and went back to their previous tasks, but not before heading up to the Gryffindor common room to interrogate Hermione Granger.
“There are even people speaking that it might not have been Muggles,” said Lewis. “They’re saying that it was a focused attack and that it only went badly because Aurors were there.”
“You’re not going to bother with the role?” said Harry, curious. “You’re just going to peer at the group and decide that everyone’s here?”
“Well, I guess, I dunno though, maybe you should try and talk to him or something?” said Dudley slightly awkwardly, his shoulders instantly shrugging as he spoke. “You’re good with words, I’m sure you could make him see what you mean easily.”
“How is Draco an unlikely ally?” said Harry, wheezing as he struggled to speak. “He’s the first person I’d go to.”
He paused when he noticed Granger taking a step backwards, his eyes narrowing as he glanced towards her face.
What annoyed him the most was the fact that he wanted a fight, wanted to be bullied, wanted to be an outcast so that he had something to fix, which would then make him known for revolutionising the rights for gay people. Whenever two men or women dated and were not attacked in public, they would thank him.
The brief moment Harry had free of the pain was a bliss, then it started as quickly as it stopped, this time it was like the knives were pushing in slowly, every part of his body hurt and it wasn’t normal pain it was prolonged pain, his body felt numb like he couldn’t move even if he wanted to, the pain finally subsided.
“Of course,” said Nicolas fondly. “Would you mind if my lovely wife, Perenelle, remained as we discussed this?”
Harry ignored Draco and proceeded to study the classroom, if it could have even be called that. He honestly thought that it looked like an old-fashioned teashop. A really old-fashioned one with the dirt and webs included. His eyes were drawn to the twenty small, circular tables, which were pushed together, almost overlapping. He eyed the chintz armchairs and fat little pouffes with disdain as he made a move forwards, halting his steps when he noticed the crimson light settling over the room.
Harry slid in behind the three Gryffindors and smiled. “From what my father was saying a bit ago, they caught most of the dragon dealers in England and respective areas, including Scotland,” he paused and inspected his nails. “You do realize trading with dragon eggs is a five year minimum sentence in Azkaban? Now if you don’t want to go there, you’ll tell me what exactly happened. Start with if the man seemed interested in anything Hogwarts related.”
“He’s serious,” said Gemma, looking slightly pale. “The only thing that’s odd is that he didn’t inform the Prefects about it. He usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere – the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that.”
“Right,” said Susan, a smile on her face. She nodded slightly and turned on the spot. She gently nudged by a Ravenclaw, not wanting to hurt the said person, an apology left her lips instantly as she made for the exit of the library happily.
Those in Slytherin were also at an impasse on what they should do. Most of them wished to attend the match to belittle the Gryffindors and laugh when they were defeated by Hufflepuff. Some had decided to give the game a miss and would lurk around and wait for the faces of the Gryffindor students to learn the outcome of the game.
Parseltongue was a truly fascinating language, allowing for flexibility not seen in many languages spoken by humans. He had this theory about it, knowing that no matter what he would come up with, it would be wrong. Salazar was frustratingly tight-lipped on how the language actually worked. He was almost positive that it was a mix of intelligence and intent. Much like humans, not all serpents were intelligent and lacked the ability to communicate effectively. He knew that Nagini only understood him due to intent – intent to make her understand – but that intent did not mean that she understood everything that needed to be understood. It left a lot of grey areas that really could not be colourised. After all, magic could only do so much, which left the rest to the intelligence of the snake.
“Yeah!” said Nick, grinning. “She’ll chew his ear off! No door closed, no meals from the table, no friends over. All of that, which he likes to do. She won’t stop Quidditch because he wants to go pro, but yeah!”
“Right then,” said Petunia, looking at Harry. “Come along and I’ll get you sorted out.” She observed her nephew, who was standing almost perfectly straight as if his back was a pole and had no flexibility at all. She gave him a smile as she watched him tuck his hands behind his back and strut off towards her.
However, he would address it later on in life, knowing that Tom was far from malevolent with his actions. If it had been a failed possession, something would have been attempted a long, long time ago. It was an anomaly, though, one he would crack once he could dedicate hours of research without anyone being wise about it. The last thing he wanted or needed was to make anyone aware of the situation.
Hermione Granger stood in the middle of the Leaky Cauldron, her hands placed on her hips as if she was an adult scolding her younger child. She narrowed her eyes at the red-headed boy in front of her. “Crookshanks didn’t kill your cat, Ron!” she said, somewhat yelling. “And now? Now he’s missing.”
He glanced around the Chamber, confused on what he could do. He ignored Ginny Weasley, which was a bad thing as he missed the slightly transparent, ghostly liquid that began to seep from the now open diary. Of course, he still didn’t notice as the transparent mist began to form into a human, a rather handsome looking human boy.
Perhaps it was because Draco himself knew that he wasn’t redeemable, no matter how bad that seemed to sound. He was smart, intelligent. He knew his own flaws and he knew them well. He wished to be like his father and would have to pick a side sometime soon, especially considering his father seemed to be prodding him into action.
Harry picked out all new entire sets of clothes, with Draco’s help and Narcissa’s reassurance he was sure he’d look good, he couldn’t help but feel like they knew him inside and out, were they getting in his head or could Draco tell what he was feeling? Harry was interrupted by Draco glancing at the suits, who knew he liked Suits… birthday present done, Harry laughed at his own thought, Narcissa and Draco briefly looked at him but looked away soon after, after everything was paid for Draco ran off to discreetly buy Harry a Christmas present, which made Harry feel bad as he got no one anything. “I’m sorry Narcissa,” Harry said while pouting.
“What’re you even talking about?” said Harry. “Can you dance or not? I’m not gonna be laughed at ‘cos you’re a bad dancer.”
Hedwig’s demeanour changed instantly. She sat up and began preening, her wings fluffed and she hooted in pleasure. She nipped gently at his fingers as if searching for the letter.
He glanced toward Longbottom, who was casting a Sticking Charm on his feet, which baffled him for a split-second before he copied the action, noticing the gale winds forming underneath him. He winced as he felt himself being pulled upwards, his feet painfully remaining connected to the cement.
“You seemed to think it did at the time, your body shook so hard, you cried as old wounds opened and the cutting you did to yourself opened heavily, you lost a lot of blood when I used the Cruciatus Curse on you.”
“Exactly, Nicolas,” said Harry. “Dumbledore wafted it under his nose to see if the man was really still around, which he is.”
“I see you’ve yet to fully meet Harry Potter, the one person who would read during some life-changing event,” said Draco. “The Muggle Queen of England could be in front of him and he’d still choose to read the book.”
That made a fair amount of sense, at least Harry assumed so. It did raise a very strong point that he was thinking about a while ago. “You know, a while ago I had this idea that all Muggleborn family members should be Obliviated and the magical person is added permanently into our world.”
“Good job Draco, now this will work out better for us!” Pansy squealed, not loudly, but it was still a squeal.
His head shot up some minutes later and he made a mad dash towards the cupboard where he had stashed the ingredients he had taken from Professor Snape.
Harry scowled as he dragged one of the more comfortable chairs towards Ernie and sat in it, sending the boy a curious glance. “Granger annoys me, Ernie. She shouldn’t have claimed that Draco had bought his way onto the Slytherin Quidditch team… she assumed that I could be replaced with money,” he said in a clipped tone. “She may have been targeting Draco with the insult, but it was discreetly aimed at me. Honestly, Ernie, if it was me petrifying people, she’d be here instead of Justin.”
He felt Nick grab his waist, wrapping his arms around it. He took the hand of Draco, standing still with fingers locked for a second and mentally jumped, a loud crack echoing the room seconds after the door was smashed down. He knew that many considered Apparition unpleasant, but he found it oddly compelling, at least when done perfectly correctly. It was a squeeze, no matter how good, but it tended to be a loving squeeze.
“I’m so glad that we won’t have to play in this,” muttered Draco as he climbed up the many stairs that led towards the top of the Slytherin stands. “I can’t see anything that isn’t in arm’s length.”
Draco didn’t answer he got up and dashed towards Harry and gently lifted him, “Harry are you okay?” Draco could feel Harry’s heartbeat, so he wasn’t dead. Of course Draco spoke way too soon and his heartbeat faltered. Draco turned to look at Dumbledore.
Lockhart was in the middle of some spell when he was lifted into the air and tossed at the large statue of Salazar Slytherin, a splatter of blood from his head appeared and smeared across the statue.
Harry had no idea what he was going to cook. “I have no idea,” he said and before his aunt’s face could change from that knowing look he quickly held up his hand. “But that is, of course, a part of the surprise meal that you’ll be getting.”
Neville frowned and shook his head at Ron, an action that Hermione thankfully missed as she was set on glaring at Ron. “A lot of people, mainly half-bloods and Muggle-born, assume that Legilimency isn’t worthy of having the title of being a gift,” he said, trying to explain it the best way that he could. “A century or so ago, the pure-blooded witches and wizards would be tripping over each other to get  Harry’s attention for being a natural Legilimens, but Dumbledore seemed to stop that and made the talent a little taboo.”
On the next strike by the serpent, he caught the flaming head mid-air, his stance buckling as if he was physically trying to hold something up. Eventually, his own strength and will won out and his body straightened and his arm stopped shaking. He pushed the serpent back, the flaming head bucking around wildly as he directed it toward Longbottom, who appeared to be struggling with his own serpent. He released the spell and watched, mesmerised, as the two serpent heads attacked Longbottom together, grazing his arm with a fiery slice in the process.
Harry muttered under his breath and straightened up, meeting Draco’s eyes. “It’s a Muggle invention, but that could be debated,” he said, noticing a few groaned at the sheer mention of the word Muggle. “I’ll have you know that chess was invented by Muggles.”
“Not really, no,” said David, leading the boy towards his car. “I’d love kids because they’d do things that’d make me worry about them. Being up late, not eating properly, or even doing badly at school. Sadly, I cannot have children.”
“Not much, I spoke to Remus and Hagrid; both seemed happy, even more-so Hagrid, did you know Hagrid speaks fluent English now? It’s great! What about you?”
“Did you like the look of my penis Harry? Am I bigger than your boyfriend, I can assume you seeing my dick made you aroused, so I’ll give you some privacy, and remember, don’t heal your injuries, I want to see everyone’s reaction and don’t tell on me Harry, or I’ll come back for you and your boyfriend and beat you both senseless.” Ron smiled at Harry and left.
“They will forget about that in a few weeks and your achievement will vanish,” said Atieno. “They care only for breeding and war.”
“He won’t be in Diagon Alley,” said Harry. “Too risky, too bright. He can enter Diagon Alley safely, but remaining there would be too dangerous. He’s in Knockturn Alley – no one bats an eye at a hooded figure there.”
Harry put the book away and rested his head on his pillow, thinking about the events that occurred today. Ron attacking him, Hermione getting pissed off and that he and Draco were finally getting closer, it was a great day.
Harry flicked his wand and watched solemnly as the fiery letters slowly rearranged themselves from ‘DGIPAY’ to ‘GAYDIP’. He chuckled and shook his head.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yes, mother, I’ll go get dressed now,” he said with the enthusiasm only a child could muster. “What, you gonna watch me get dressed as well? Get out.”
He had begun casting darker curses, often exploding the mannequins with a burst of magic that rendered them completely unrepairable, which made Salazar extremely happy that his creations were being destroyed.
The Dark Arts, despite most of the spells being flamboyant, were subtle and pretended to be far more harmless than they were. A simple cut on your hand was meant to distract you from the burning pain in your head as some curse ate away ate your brain. Thankfully, that type of magic had been long forgotten and left well enough alone. However, the Dark Arts screamed you to be cautious. They wanted to draw you in, whether you were the caster or not. It’s what made Voldemort so feared among the dark populace. No one had the control of the Dark Arts like him. He bent the magic to his will and forced it to obey his command.
“It certainly wasn’t his first or second choice,” said Lily softly. “The only thing that made him not throw a fit was the fact that Draco was coming here and that was worth the torment, I guess.”
“Ron,” said Neville calmly, in his tone that he addressed people with, despite being so young. “He deserves to spend time with us. He can speak, he just chooses not to!”
Ron, already feeling brave enough, slowly inched forwards and gently stroked the beak of Buckbeak, which almost made him snicker at the thought.
“I think we’ll be able to get the trapdoor open now,” said Neville, taking slow steps towards the dog. “How long does that spell last?”
“Words can be rather scathing,” said Harry, his eyes narrowing. “Actions… actions have more severe and lasting consequences. I would rather be doing what I’m saying rather than standing on a small table in the middle of a room squeaking about them.”
The hooded figure bowed, “My Lord, we have some good and bad news.” He lifted his head and took a seat, “the bad news is that the curse on the Weasley boy has failed, something broke it. I was not around when it was broken; Dumbledore had me as far away as possible I assume he knew.”
Harry almost snorted when the snake mentioned that Professor Snape was the protector of the nest. Of course, it was essentially correct, if Nagini taught him anything about snakes and how they acted it was pretty obvious.
“You were,” said Narcissa with one of her smiles that made even Lucius curious on why she was smiling. “When you were about three, you must have forgotten. On the contrary, Harry was never informed and when he wakes up he may be confused, but we must find out what exactly happened in case it requires the aid of the Obliviator Squad. Harry obviously did magic, whether accidental or not, why the Ministry didn’t appear is a question that must be answered.”
“Expanding my horizons,” said Harry. He twisted back towards the books and winced. “I… may be able to get one of them out of their cage. That’ll save you a bit of extra work.”
“And I assume when she said houses, she meant the four Hogwarts houses, not everyday houses,” said Lily, processing the knowledge. “That makes a fair amount of sense.”
“Your little boyfriend is a firecracker, Malfoy,” said Flint, ignoring the black-haired boy with ease. “You should teach him to shut his mouth before it gets him into trouble.”
Below the clock a fireplace appeared which burned brightly, filling the room with a soft red glow along with the natural light. The kitchen still held all items but they were all repaired and made new, the cupboards filled with food and just above the fireplace the Weasley family logo appeared and shined whenever it was locked at.
be possible. This isn’t a holiday or a special occurrence. You will behave and not giggle at this and that throughout the night.”
Nodding, Harry kept his eyes firmly on the snake, not wanting it to attack him, not that he thought that it would, it seemed friendly.
“We will be able to cure her, Argus,” said Dumbledore softly, his tone patient. “Professor Sprout has recently been able to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made which will revive Mrs. Norris.”
Draco stood and led harry to his bedroom, “here you can have this.” Draco handed him the book, “I can pretty much recite it word for word, and it was the first book I ever read about you. You can burn it or edit it, maybe get the real you out there.” Draco smiled.
“They have been,” said Harry, remembering what Professor Snape had said recently. “Dumbledore has added an enchantment that blocks Voldemort from ever putting a living foot on the grounds of Hogwarts.”
“Pettigrew didn’t attack our common room, how come we have to go with the Gryffindors?” said Harry. “I doubt he even knows where the Slytherin common room is.”
Draco caught the end of it, something about Harry taking his boyfriend. His interests peaked; he never knew Harry was gay. Draco was snapped out of his thought when he saw the Weasel get flung from the library and an exhausted Harry frowning at the desk.
Lee Jordan spared Professor McGonagall a quick glance before continuing. “I get it, all right, all right. So Potter nearly kills the Gryffindor Chaser, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure. Gryffindor is in possession.”
He took a deep breath and began to walk, his black shoes gently clicking against the snow-covered cobblestone, his eyes slipping off the buildings with practised ease. He measured his steps, making sure not to walk into the backs of his fellow students. He had never seen so many people in the small village, which made it appear much like a crowded city with very little room to move around. He lifted his body, standing on the tips of his toes, trying to find a place where he could stand, take a break, and not be elbowed in the ribs by an overeager student. He found a worn-down café, which seemed to look worse than the Leaky Cauldron. He squinted at the sign, barely making out the name of the café, which was Night and Day, as he moved towards the thin floor-to-ceiling wooden windows that were lined across the building in varying distances from each other.
Harry turned and looked at Draco, who was already dressed, just like him, tapping the wall with the back of his foot. “Saying goodbye to my mother and Daniel.”
“Indeed, when we’re both free I’ll come down, sorry to cut this short but I can see Hermione and I’ve been hunting for her forever.”
Harry had been given a money bag from his mother just before he left, which he smiled at and promptly stated that he wasn’t six and didn’t need a little bag with a set amount of Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in it. Despite his attempts at trying to persuade her that he was a little boy anymore, she still shoved the moneybag into his hand and sent him on his way.
Neville still had a half-smile on his face when he saw Harry stand, he went to copy the action but a slight headshake from Dumbledore told him to remain seated. He watched as Harry, being as polite as he is, gave a quick nod and began to exit the Headmaster’s office. During all that, he couldn’t help but think on why he was being asked to remain behind.
I decided to split this chapter because I was curious on how people felt about the goblins. I always had a plan for them, but it wasn't like this.
“Third – to Mr. Neville Longbottom,” said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. “For pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.’
Harry listened to Borgin and Lucius haggle about prices, the former not getting anywhere at all for the artefacts that Lucius held in that little black box. It was pointless to try and compete against Lucius in the business end of deals, the man was cutthroat when he needed to be and always pressured you in the way to make you lose your footing and agree to a much higher price.
“– we’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing,” said Hermione while glaring at Ron, who just so happened to be rolling his eyes.
“Yes, I said that,” said Fleur, her tone soft. “The French Ministry was doing a study on Time Magic. I wish you could speak French, it would make explaining much easier.”
“Yes, but trust me when I say it, don’t be jealous those two were more like best friends and tried it, soon enough they realized they were both tops and Draco is a power-driven-lunatic. If he has no power he won’t stay, Blaise isn’t the same, but neither would bot which in a gay relationship would falter it. Blaise and Draco are now brothers, in a sense, they will never go beyond that into a sexual level, but I just want to warn you, Blaise has eyes for you, he has for a while. Draco is awake, I can hear him groaning in anger from here, and act asleep and you’ll see what I mean.” Pansy detached herself from Harry and sat on the other side of the room.
Harry continued to mull over his failure, ignoring the soft snicker that was obviously coming from Tom, who found this entire situation amusing. He couldn’t understand how he would fail such a simple spell. It had to be simple if Longbottom could cast it.
Severus nodded along, listening and attempting to soothe the ever worried Lily. Eventually the son of the distressed mother joined in with the distress and began squirming rather fiercely.
The soft discussion between father and son soon merged into a debate, one that had small jabs and petty insults tied into each word spoken. The whole situation was fragile and threatened to shatter at any given moment. The duo finally reached the top of the stairs and stopped directly in front of a portrait, who in Harry’s opinion was simply fat.
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, face down.
“Oh Harry, this will make life at work so much easier, thank you, thank you so much!” Arthur gave him a firm handshake.
Harry leaned in eagerly, looking at the box with excitement that could be defined as almost lunatic. He watched with eternal attention as Ollivander slowly opened the box, revealing a long, sleek black wand with traces of silver twirled through it. In some light the wand appeared to be a dark green, but that could have just been his eyes playing tricks.
Narcissa smiled, for some reason whenever Harry complimented her home it gave her a huge surge of relief and proudness that she was doing a good job. “I think you underestimate Harry’s ability to be polite and well-spoken, Draco.”
Nothing else eventful happened, most students were shocked to see the Bloody Baron actually speaking to someone besides Peeves.
“And I thought you were meant to be smart,” said Atieno, muttering under his breath. “I guess intelligence can be measured in different manners.”
"I'm just playing with you, I'm just testing if I you'll lie to me or not but even if you did otherwise… I'll still stay with you." He said as he nuzzled on my shoulder.
Speaking of scratches, it's been a week and mine wasn't healed yet, it turns out that the wounds were deeper than I thought… bummer…
"Well the uncompleted list on the bulletin board, it has been used as a teaser for the draw tonight." Hermione explained.
He continued doing just that until me seed shot out of me, making me arch my back, tensing all muscles my body have.
They dragged me to an empty classroom after the "uh-oh" incident, then they told me about the escort draw that will happen tomorrow night.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face and the best mood I've had since being thrown out from my house. And the day seem to get along with me since it's really sunny outside, the weather is great for a stroll or a jog. The run in with the professor almost slipped my mind if it weren't for Ron's text, reminding me that the classes with the professor will begin in three hours. Just three hours and I'll be faced with wrath of that black-clad man. But still with a fine day like this and a light mood around me I can't have a day that bad… or so I thought.
"Look at those bimbos." Ren said pointing at the two *cough* ladies we talked to earlier. "Poor girls." She said as she shakes her head.
I don't really know when was the last time I saw Draco properly… most of the time we meet, we talk only talk about the Gala and practice, and whenever he initiates something… I spaz out; well not really, I just made it seem that way. Because usually I don't think twice with making out with a person I like. But sadly he almost found me out last time; I don't want that to happen again.
"Well well well…" An annoyingly squeaky voice said from behind me. "look who's back. Isn't it the weirdo duo?" she said in a very mocking tone. "We thought you wouldn't return after what happened last year."
"They patterned their children's names with each other, didn't you notice. Potter's son's name is Harry James, while Sirius' daughter's name is Hannah Jennica. Why didn't Sirius named her after himself? I wonder, is James influence to Sirius that strong?" Flitwick explained.
"You, alright there?" Sirius asked without looking at me. Right now we stood in front of the door leading to the ballroom hall. (yes it's the biggest school in the country... it has its own ballroom…)
"You, young woman have no right to call Miss Weasley and Miss Black that way. And it's not from Miss Granger. She might already be in Durmstrang Institute by now. "
"Yep, there are seven of us, six dudes and a lady. A maximum of three slots for guys could be used by a single family, so the first three guys got it and from me to Ron here, got in as cross-dressers." Faith, aka Fred, said.
"Hello, may I ask who is calling?" Good thing he is on the other line… I feel like my cheeks were about to EXPLODE!
"Mo-more. " I said, wanting the feeling again. He obliged and pulled out and pushed back in hitting my prostate dead on. He did it slow and hard at first, but later took a much faster pace until later all that was heard in the room was flesh hitting flesh and our grunts and moans.
"Isn't what we're doing illegal!" I whisper-shouted to Ron; when we went sneaking inside a room, somewhere in the fifth floor.
"I was just dropping off Blaise to Ronald's room… He said something about ambushing him." Draco said coughing as he did.
The hotel he took me to was, well you guessed it; a five star hotel. But thank goodness it doesn't cause much staying here.
"See you later too." I said waving my hand as I continue walking towards my dorm room. As I got nearer to it I saw someone pacing around in front of my door.
"Tsk tsk tsk…" Tonks said with hand gestures. "Remember, Harry slash Hanna, you are a GIRL, it's fine to like cars but some of us do not act like that over a Porche." She said.
"No buts." He said putting his finger in front of my mouth, "I love you, no matter what." He said hugging me close. Right then and there I cried… I cried on his shoulder. Not because I was relieved, not because I'm happy that he didn't notice anything… my
"And? And! That girl harmed us; look at the damage she's done to us! You should help us get her expelled!" Parkinson said.
"Don't act like you don't know. But I'll play along with you. It's Draco, D-R-A-C-O, Draco, Draco Malfoy."
"And to think that I thought that would be funny if Ron was the victim of that." Fred's voice came behind a wall.
Draco Malfoy was a member. He left because he thinks that the club activities there is against the school's principles, this cost him his old iPod (he replaced it after he get his first allowance as a member of the student council). Severus Snape was never a member.
"I'm sorry!" she said as she helped me up. She didn't wait for an answer and walked me towards her door.
"I dunno." He said with a shrug. "What do you want me to do?" He asked as he lean down to give another mind blowing kiss.
"So Mr. Black I need to talk to you about something if you don't mind." Mr. Weasley said. Sirius there's something I saw in Sirius face for a moment, but I thought it was just my imagination. He looked at me and smiled.
I walked towards that corner they just left, and heard a faint sob. 'As I thought,' I said to myself. I was startled at what I saw. I saw Ren there hugging her knee, crying with papers(clearly been stepped on due to the dirt covering them) scattered all around her, I walked towards her and saw a little bit of blood on her white long sleeves.
"You just need three things for the first time aside from condoms… gentleness, lube and prep…" He explained. "If you don't know what I mean, you can always check the internet. Almost everything is there… if athletes foot treatment could be found there… you can also find gay sex pointers there." He said wiggling his eyebrows.
"I can't help it!" Ron shouted. "Blaise has been there in that meeting for three hours now!" Ron sighed exasperatedly. "He said that he'll go straight here after that meeting." He sighed again…
I looked at Tonks pleadingly, 'Please don't make me wear these pieces of shit!' I chanted in my head. Nothing looks weirder than a man wearing MCR black shirt with a pink clip on his head and a flower power bracelet. I already looked weird holding bags of designer brands, chosen by looking at the size on the tag, I won't be SEEN. In those clothes or my fucki'n name isn't Harry Potter!
"And what do you think we should do about this." I said gesturing to the hard little Harry who has his own way of thinking.
"Uh Dray what are you doing here?" Blaise says looking pass me. I turned around and saw him, the prettiest guy in the world! I didn't realize that I was staring until Hermoine patted my back. I surely hope he didn't notice it!
"I'm best friends with Blaise, remember? But it took a lot of torture before I could make him talk." He laughed.
Representative for each year: (two representatives for each year, a male and a female, and two substitutes. A representative can have two positions ex.) He could be both the representative and the secretary.) Hermoine Granger, Draco Malfoy, Susan Bones, Blaise Zabini
"Thank God." He gave a sigh of relief. "I do not want to be the receiving end of that person's flying kicks and punches. So table nine..." He cleared his throat. "Well, I would just warn you about something before I go to my punishment… two of your bitches asked for a favor a week ago. And I am telling you they were pretty angry."
"Okay, there is still one but I rather not talk about it here." I said as I looked around. "Someone might hear me."
And now we stand in front of the ginormous shelves of accessories that range from plastic to smooth silk, and stones to metals. 'Creepy' I thought to myself. I never noticed this part of the mall's department store. Since my only accessories were my baseball cap my hair gel my sunglasses (when I get the urge to use contacts) and my silver bracelet, I don't usually go this far in the place.
Okay… so this chapter will involve Draco and Harry's practice and a little peek of Millicent and Pansy "PLANS". And I swear this has "something" you'll like. Not lemon but likable... ;)
"Okay, see you later!" Ron said as he sat on the lounge chair, and Nastasia sat in front of him and began giving him a pedicure.
"What do you mean by that?" Ron said sitting up. "I thought he's done a good job in those categories."
"By the way, before you start doing a scene here, we actually have a guest in the room." Hermoine said pointing at me.
'Now I have a new problem… Fantastic… just fantastic.' I let out a sigh before walking towards my shower. As another call came… this time from my Corby 2… to the tune of *Rule*.
"That's it?" Harry said, left eyebrow twitching. "THAT'S IT! That's all you can say?" Harry shouted annoyed at Sirius' reaction.
Okayyyy..... so, this is the latest chapter of this story.... meaning the slow chapter by chapter updates starts here. I haven't written the next chapter so, please don't get tired of waiting and please tell me what you think....
"That hurt." He said as he sat up. "I'm sorry, okay; I'm sorry, now can we just sit here on the lake side." He said gesturing for me to sit on his side. I obliged.
"But dear." Lilly interfered. "He did pass, he just ran out of slots, I'm sure we can get him in soon, we just have to enroll him in a different school until a slot is available." She explained, standing between the two men, seems like protecting her son from possible attacks.
"I mean it…" Draco said in a deep voice, his voice sounded so genuine that Harry turned his gaze again to Draco, only to meet two silver orbs with nothing but serious desire and truth visible in them.
"It just works that way." Gray said as she followed Faith inside. "And won't you come inside; it's better to talk in the workshop than in here."
By the end of the day I felt really drained. Like all my energy has been sucked out; one of the things that made me feel drained is that Draco is nowhere to be seen as of that moment. I just flopped on my bed when I reached it. Then I felt like sighing like a lovesick school girl but hey that's Ron's job. 'But since it's a nice day, why not go out, a walk would be nice.' I thought. 'A really great weather should never be wasted.' I thought as I stood up and walked towards my cabinet.
I'm telling you, both of them really looks the same but one is taller, they were both wearing some accessories that Ron wears right now, the square book like locket, silver bangles and black heart earrings. But their rings were different. The girl in the converse were wearing silver or stainless ones with no or minimal stones, the one in the wedge were wearing black rubber ones and Ron is a sucker for really big stones that his finger may swear at him if it can just talk.
"All I ask is for you to pass, for you to get in my high school, for you to raise our family's flag, and to make the Potter name shine again. But what did you do? You FAILED, you FAILED the exam!" James yelled even louder.
I'm sorry guys, I'm sad to say this. But I am not going to continue writing this story. I've outgrown it. And it still makes me cringe. 😩
." He said stressing every syllable of the word "girlfriend". And he said that while smiling like an idiot; which only made him more… adorable?
"I'm really sorry, but I'm not quite ready for that." she said looking at the floor. "Let's just continue the lessons tomorrow." She said.
"Yeah, it was something I watched on YouTube a while ago. And I admit it I downloaded it using a converter… I know it's illegal but hey, I really liked it; and I featured it in my blog and I couldn't find it anywhere so…" Draco said while blushing and scratching the back of his head.
"You bitch!" Ron screamed from beside me. "We've been together since this morning and you didn't tell me!" he said looking hard at me. "And you too! You call yourself my boyfriend?" He said pointing at Blaise.
"I work better with light." Ron said as he put his pen down and look at his Samsung Champ. "Hey, Hermoine said we need to go to the meeting room… now…" He said looking at Harry. At the same time Harry checked both of his phones and found the same message.
Then just on cue as I was about to open my door, Draco came inside holding a bouquet of pink roses and two tickets to the movies.
"And it won't be good if you got an unpopular one, it might not get you some votes, since the escort will help publicity. Public votes are 40% of the criteria, the judges' are 60% and that 60% have parts, intelligence, poise, which you lack by the way, beauty, the way you carry the dress you wear, your attitude and etcetera." Hermoine explained.
"Mmm," I heard him moan to the kiss, as he put his arms around my waist to support me; which encouraged me to go further. This time I'm the one who begged entrance but tugging on his lower lip. Which he give after I put one of my arms down cup his ass, making him moan, which all it took me to shove my tongue in his mouth.
"But there is a convenience store just beside your house? Why would you go to the other street?" Harry asked again. Amused as Sirius expression changed.
'How could someone do this to a girl?' I thought as I looked at the broken figure in front of me. I know I'm not the gentlemanliest person on the effi'n planet but I really won't do this to someone so defenseless.
"Okay let's go to the buffet table!" Ren said as she pulled me away. "Soo… in which department are you?" She asked.
"Pay attention or get out…" I heard the professor said without looking away from the board. "Ms. Black, I know you feel like an idiot for what happened a while ago, but that doesn't mean that you can space out just like that. If you don't want to listen, feel free to get out." He said.
THIS IS STRICTLY RATED M… DUE TO TERMS THAT CHILDREN UNDER MY AGE (17) SHOULD NEVER EVEN THINK OFF… AND IF YOU SEARCH THEM ON THE INTERNET, PLEASE ERASE YOUR HISTORY OR GO INCOGNITO.
"Harry James Evans Potter… if you didn't do your laundry you won't find anything." The bitch said, while doing his nails on MY bed.
sucks; and hell! I'm not letting shit slide… I'm telling him the truth tonight! I'll just hope that he won't spread my real condition out if he doesn't like what I'll say.
But after a while we did it again and somehow we ended up in my bed. He moved away first this time and started kissing my neck. He bit it a little, then he sucked it. His hand moved from my hips to my waist as his kiss moved down to my collar bone. His hand moved to my stomach.
Sigh, sigh, sigh… The only thing you can hear from the place called the design room is a sound called "sigh". And that certain sound came from none other than Ronald A.K.A. Renelle Weasley, who is staring in a blank piece of paper with a pen in her right hand.
(cough) voice shout, from the direction of table nine. "YOU ARE THE DAMN PRESIDENT AND YOU BREAK YOUR OWN RULES! SPIT THAT CIG OUT! NOW!"
"Don't tell me you're having second thoughts, that's a first for the likeness of you…" I heard Blaise said beside me.
"Well some things slip some things don't go to place and you Ron have done this for a long time you should've observed better. I've been with you for a long time… I will know when a cross dresser did a great job or not, right away, and Harry's job is clearly satisfactory at most." She explained, making me blush with embarrassment. "Even if he looked like a girl, it doesn't mean that he can act it out perfectly." She said. "And just like you Ron he needs more time to perfect it. Remember when I first saw you. You were beating a guy to death, while wearing a skirt which flew quite nicely giving everybody nightmares for weeks." Ron just hid his face in embarrassment. Hermoine can really embarrass us without really trying.
Only two conclusions ran through my head that time. One: I'm in deep shit. Two: good thing I remembered to hold back from sending that girl to the Infirmary.
He didn't battle me for dominance this time; he let me take the lead. I obliged by exploring the mouth I fantasized about in the shower, the hot cavern that's Draco Malfor's mouth.
"Oh…" He said, blushing a little bit. "Well sometimes it's fun… hot and a lot of things…" He explained after clearing his throat.
"Firstly, I heard that nice ear-splitting scream…" Face palm… "And secondly I want you to come here today… wear the best formal clothes you got. I'll pick you up at exactly 7pm tonight." Then he hung up…
"Who? And what did they ask?" I said in my usual "business" tone putting up the mask that I learned to use from everyone in my family; specially my dad. It is a protocol in business families like ours to know how to shield our emotions and make ourselves as numb as possible.
"What's wrong?" Draco said as his smile faltered. "You know if you can't say yes to me now I'm willing to wait…"
*The SC has a meeting room the size of two classrooms(their office was different). The year level government & House Councils have normal size meeting rooms.
"Uhm, excuse me but, what is a hair extension?" I asked, and honestly; I've been hearing the word a lot today and I do not even know what the hell that is.
"By the way, as we reach the restaurant, leave your things in the back seat." He said as I entered the car.
"Ron!" the guy said as he spotted Ron, still sitting on the floor. "What did those idiots do to you again?" He said as he pulled Ron to a tight hug.
It hurts… I don't wanna get out of bed. But sadly I must. I really must, I've been wondering about what Millicent and Parkinson wants from me… but even if it worries me to no end, I still have to go to classes. I'm sooo bummed. If those two bitches could poison and burn a whole fashion show, they can do much worse… and I do NOT mean
"Harry!" I heard Hermione called behind me. I turned around and saw her. And if I wasn't with the sexiest man on earth, I would think she's hot. She's wearing a gold gown with a slit that reached to the middle of her leg, the top of the gown has cobweb-like straps made of black beads, her hair was neatly styled on the left, she wears a four-inch high sparkly black sling-back wedge, and her make up; smoky eyes, long lashes, red lips… exquisite. "Draco."
I don't want that to happen, since this MacBook Air will be taken away with it… why? Because father and mother will be totally pissed, and I don't think that they'll even leave my iPhone with me, I also think they might cut my allowance to a quarter of it, and leave only my old (with a sentimental value) Sony Ericsson C902 which I've had for four years now.
"That explains the wig…" They said again, both looking like they wanna puke at the thought of my wig… is it really that bad?
"STEAL! What do you mean 'steal'?" Hermione shouted. "Remember the last time you stole shoes from your brothers?"
Right now she was currently sinking her teeth in a fish fillet in white sauce. I to be honest, I haven't seen a girl eating like this in a formal occasion… but hell yeah! I like girls who are fearless and talented.
(cough) voice behind me. "I never knew that you're type is innocent and hot headed, I should've applied for the job when I still had both, such a shame."
was the one who gave that, and not Tom. Or else you'll be street sweeping for the next seventy-two hours."
Harry felt his knees buckle at the sight, only to be held up by Draco. "You are the only person I knew who caught my attention like this. And you are the only person I held that made my heart beat faster." Draco said it with such sincerity, it left Harry speechless, and it made his breath hitch. "I am a person that's too hard to please. When I say I want something; I will get it no matter what the cost." Draco paused a little before he said: "I know I want you." Draco said as his lips met Harry's.
written in the front, a black slim fit jeans (I really like it more than skinnies), a 20-inch silver chain necklace with a camera pendant; over a 14-inch silver butterfly necklace, my all-time favorite ring, three black wrist bands, silver music note earrings, and a black and white bonnet over my pigtailed wig. I put on my floral flats, just put some lip gloss on and I'm ready to go. I clipped my iPod shuffle on, put the earphones inside my shirt and put my phones in my pockets.
"Well, were the ones who should be saying that since we do not have time for losers like you… come now Pans." Millicent said as she walked pass us, Pansy in tow.
Then I went and reenact the way he played with my nipples. How it pebbled at the touch and attention the blond man gave it. How it never followed my orders, to stay the way it was before he touched them.
"Everything is ruined." She answered between sobs, never changing here position. I took one of the papers on the floor, and saw the most beautiful pink gown I've ever seen. I looked back to her. 'Did she design this?' I asked myself. I took every paper on the floor and saw different types of dresses, which were all equally beautiful, they're not really ruined, and everything's still visible.
"How long do you think you can keep that a secret?" She cut me off. "And yes Ron is a he." She explained. "They bullied him, because he's a he, and to top it off he is a designer and the "Girlfriend" of one of the eligible bachelors in town, Blaise Zabini. The girls of Slytherin think she doesn't deserve him, and the boys think they should get their leader back no matter what's at stake." She said as she takes out her phone, she dialed something then returned it back. After that I suddenly found the floor interesting.
And there they go again, dragging me somewhere, with their enthusiasm never faltering. They really want me to win because I helped them. Isn't this a just little too much, they've already let me in their circle… I think this is a bit of overkill, but hey! If they are happy doing this, then who am I to
"Dray, I love you." I said feeling a little bit uneasy since there seem to be a long pause on the other line.
"Did you really think that low of me?" He shouted back. "Didn't you believe anything I said?" He asked.
"Would you consider joining a team building activity?" Harry read out loud. "Definitely… no." He said.
And that photo just happened to be just breath taking. Draco just finished drinking from the fountain, still a little parched, but still hot. He is standing by a huge glass window, and as Harry took the shot, a ray of afternoon light came through, making Draco's striking features stand out.
Okay, I'm back. And I'll have to warn you… there will be LEMONS here; so for those who don't like it, please skip that part. And for the pros at writing Lemons, please take it easy with me since this is only my third time in writing M scenes… and I don't have any first-hand experience so; yeah I'm apologizing beforehand.
"Sirius, your house is that way right?" Harry said walking side by side with his godfather, pointing in the direction in front of them.
"Because we care, we are friends, and you stood up for us back then even if you don't know us. So we've decided that we will be with you through it all." Ron said with the brightest smile I ever saw on him, which made me and Hermione smile back at him.
"Oh, I'm sorry but it's clear in the investigation that we were not at fault, your plan backfired and exploded on your faces. And Ms. Pansy Looney Pants, are much weirder than I am." Ren smiled as she rolled her eyes.
'Why the hell must this food taste sooo good?' I thought as I took a bite out of my fourth plate of fish fillet with white sauce. 'I know I must fucki'n act like a lady, but hell, this thing is heaven on a plate!'
"Oh well, well,well." I heard a really ugly squeaky voice behind me. "Isn't it early for people like both of you to come out?"
Since we're only going to the movies I choose to wear only a violet t-shirt with the words "She Will Be Loved" written in front with glittery red ink, I took out my denim pants and my floral flats. I also took out two ponytails from my dresser and tied my hair to two big tails and tucked them under a brown bonnet. I took several silver bracelets and rings and a butterfly necklace. I put two earings on my left ear a gold rose and a small silver circle with a blue stone, and one on my right ear, the rose. I took a body bag out of my cabinet and put my phones powder and a lip gloss in. I clipped my iPod on my shirt and connect it to my earphones and turned it on.
"As you wish." He said before he hit that spot again. I didn't notice it when he added another finger and began scissoring and stretching my anus, but it felt really good. I never thought I'd enjoy this to be honest. Then he added another one, he went back to push in pull motion; hitting my prostate dead on each time; which in turn made me see stars.
"Worry about that later! We need to put the plan into action." Hmmm… what is this crazy bitch talking about?
I belong in the arts department for my high score in arts. After them, the head master spoke and then the party started. I saw different people, all dressed to impress. We got on our way to the buffet table when a person called…
"Correction, Dim sided frogs and snails. Ren lets just go. These creatures might give us allergies." Ren and Hermoine stared at me for seconds before they laughed and led the way. Leaving those two bitches speechless.
"No, not really… But its close, since being a muse means beautiful…yeah I think he did." He said smirking at me. I couldn't help but smile at that… but the red cheeks won't fade, DAMMIT!
"Beautiful but needs improvement." Another ginger girl who looks the same as the other, but wearing a ripped baby blue hanging shirt over a black tank top, green cargo pants and six inch strappy wedge said.
Sirius suddenly stops on his tracks, digesting the sudden shocking information. "You have been WHAT!" Sirius shouted.
"I am sure we can Miss Parkinson. According to a reliable witness you started the fight; therefore this is the proper punishment. Both of you and Miss Bulstrode have done enough; it's time we take an action. Last time you destroyed the fashion show of the Arts Department; and now this. You're offence cannot be ignored anymore." The councilor said. "And you Miss Black. We know you didn't start that ruckus, but you still hurt your schoolmate, Miss Bulstrode's injuries were not severe but you still hold liabilities. Therefore you will have detention for a month, and will be under probation." I actually winced at the word
"Yep it's my absolute favorite," he smiled. "why'd you ask?" He said putting the black straw in his mouth, again.
I knew about these meeting, even Ron does, Hermione told us about these parties. But I never really thought I could be a part of it. Hermione said that even they don't know it's scheduled, until they receive a text from someone from the faculty.
"Oh, don't worry it's fine." Ron answered, which made the girl's smile wider. "Well, that's nice to know. Okay, if you guys ever had problems in bullying, feel free to go to my office." She said as she walked away.
"What do you know? You're just a huff and puff who got brawns but no brains!" Pansy hissed, but the girl just smirked at her.
'Oh no!' Harry thought to himself. "I think I'm in trouble." He said as he stood up and ran towards the direction of the elevator.
"Look girls we need to meet my sisters and…" Ron took a look at his watch. "You don't fit to our sched."
"Call the boys; tell them to meet us in the science room later." Millicent said as she walked pass the tree.
Then the other two beauticians helped me to a seat and the three of us had a little chat on what to do to the bird nest of a hair I have. And after about fifteen minutes we decided on something, they'll use a colored rebond treatment on my hair. Then after the treatments they'll decide if I still need hair extensions.
"Yeah, it turned out to be more hilarious with those two." George said; coming out the wall with Fred.
"How could that happen? I've only been here for a while, not even everyone from my department knows me, how did you expect me to believe that a quarter of my year level's population will even vote for me!?" I explained.
And the internet I went. I went to a blog then followed a link and saw things I shouldn't have. I saw things from twinks, to double penetration, to BDSM… And I swear I need to rub some isopropyl alcohol all-over my eyes and brain to get rid of those disturbing images that would probably haunt me for the rest of my life.
"You know, for the short time I've been with you, I already knew it when you are lying or not. Wanna know why?" She said with a smirk.
"Yep and it happened for two straight weeks." I groaned. The dream doesn't happen frequently a month ago, but I guess it worsen after seeing him do his rounds every day.
"First I'll rip that silver dress of him. Then I'll kiss that luscious lips of his, then I'll take him without taking off his high heels. And I'll fuck him all-night long." And he said that still with a straight face!
After a fifteen minute walk I reached my destination. And I saw what I was told. It wasn't beautiful! That's an understatement, it was absolutely gorgeous! It was like the dwelling for pixies and fairies that I saw on pictures and read on books. And with the lights from the sun that's slowly going away, it looks absolutely mesmerizing.
"Are you two coming or not?" George said as he took his beige handbag from a chair and followed Fred out; which made both Ron and I run after them.
"Yeah, grumpy, it's not… but isn't that paper due three days ago?" He shot back as his lip glossed lips curve into a smirk. "You're lucky
"Because it's a new design. And it is a part of the new bronze collection, in which that dress Harry is wearing belongs to. I can just tell them that we used the shoes for product testing." He explained, now taking a shrimp cocktail.
"They always hang pictures of candidates as soon they were announced." Ron said. "So those things were probably there since last night." He said munching on the potato chips I gave him LAST night.
"Shut the hell up." I laughed. "I wonder of your boy toy's hole is even intact, with that appetite of yours.
"Okay forget it!" he said as he pulled his fingers out. I whined again at the lost. "This'll really hurt a little." He said as he positioned himself in front of my hole' I braced myself for what's about to happen before we heard voices behind the trees.
"Did. That. Bitch. SLAPPED ME?" I asked stressing every syllable I could; feeling really annoyed, my anger spilling any second. "NOBODY SLAPS ME!" I shouted as I marched towards the two happy, retreating girls. I turned Millicent around, and the bitch just SMIRKED at me! 'I have an idea how to wipe that smirk off your face.' I thought as I bitch slapped her, left and right, and punched her stomach.
As the need for breath arises; both of us let go. This time though I wanted to do something I saw in one of those porn videos I watched earlier.
I tied my hair to a low pony tail, from the two big tails I wore earlier, and slipped on a sports watch on my unoccupied arm. I hid my necklace inside my white undershirt and put the rose earrings in my bag and left the blue one on.
"Yeah," I said as I stood up and walked towards the direction Hannah took. 'I won't take no for an answer.'
"Are these slacks? And coats?" I asked myself as I looked at the clothing articles they slipped in my stall door. I took the bathrobe hanging in front of the mirror. I hurriedly got out bringing the clothes with me. I walked towards a sales lady.
We entered the door and I was DAZZLED in what I saw! A red carpet was right in front of us, there was a buffet table with all kinds of foods imaginable, a big chandelier with diamonds hangs in the middle of the ceiling with eight small ones surrounding it, the stage had a long wooden table where people, who might be the school staff, sat, and a lot of circular glass tables were at the sides. The pace is GINORMOUS! I stood there dumbfounded and amazed, while my three companions stood there clearly unaffected by everything.
"Uhmm…" I said. I took a glance at Ren and saw pleading in them. I then looked back in to Hermoine's and saw a 'Try and lie, and I'll kill you' look in it, that combined with the murderous aura surrounding her made me spill. "I saw her crying this morning!" I said, I looked back at Ren and saw fear.
Today was a very lovely Sunday morning, no work, no nothing, and People could just happily stay in bed all day. Everyone's happy… NOT!….
Why can't I love someone like thee?" I finished with hands clapping from everyone around me. If you asked me why I wrote something like this, in my status, I might just say "Why do you care?" but the real reason is that the idea for it came from someone close to me. He loved someone as bad as that during his younger years, but even I myself don't really know how love feels yet.
"Yep." I replied. I really can't deny the nervousness in my tone. After all this will be the last time I'll see them until a couple of months. After the welcoming party the parents will be chased out… not before they filed the needed documents, they don't, but we will be escorted to our dorms as soon as the parents leaves the ballroom, so yeah.
Then as the credits rolled, he dragged me outside to the parking lot. There I saw the most beautiful car I've ever seen… again. Draco's Aston Martin.
'Such a simple mind set for a really complex person.' I thought to myself. Our happy hour didn't last long until a bad, stinky air covered the strawberry-pineapple scent of our drinks.
"See that guy." Ren said pointing at a tall, dark and handsome guy, wearing a velvet black tux, leather shoes, green tie and gray undershirt, he is also wearing a vintage silver ring with a green stone, which might be jade. His hair is blond almost platinum, which I'm sure feels soft to the touch. His skin is flawlessly fair and those eyes… those captivating silver eyes that-'WHAT!' I thought as I snapped out of my fantasy. 'No fucking way! I didn't just check out a guy! NO! This is wrong!' "Hey Hannah." Ren said as she snapped her fingers in front of me. "You looked like you're gonna be sick." She said with a worried expression. I glanced at Hermoine and saw the same expression.
"Well, the news about Draco volunteering to be your escort came out this morning." He said with a smirk.
"Damn! Why me?" Harry said to himself as he walks in the dark road (literally). "And what the fuck happened to the lights in here?" He shouted before he heard a familiar voice behind him.
"Would both of you, stop talking about sex and go to the stage right now… Both Bones and Granger were already there and we're only waiting for you two." A very cold, angry voice said behind us.
"Oh really now?" Harry said with amusement as well as suspicion in his voice. He really loves it when he's making fun of Sirius, he loves his reaction when he asks him things that got something to do with his lover living in the other street, even though he knows who the "secret person" is, he likes to keep it secret so he can use it to make fun of him.
"Okay, okay, Ms. Black, I will be glad to accept your application. We can use a female student of your caliber here. Classes will start in two weeks from today, on the 1st, so I'll see you then." The older woman said with a smile.
eavesdrop on Sirius and Remus' alone time. A kiss that don't relate to sex, but just a sweet reminder that they like each other… wait a minute… scratch that! Why the hell is he kissing me? From my point of view I thought he doesn't like me much.
even though I should be already used to it, since I've been to a fair share of fights in my past school, I'm a damn soccer player! But being sent to probation as Hannah? That's just so wrong!
"Because every emotion and feelings you feel shows in your eyes ." She said pinching Harry's left cheek, Harry just moved away laughing. "Now let's get out of this place, and start shoppi'n!" She said as she busted the engine and goes a 100kph.
Just on cue our professor, the too tall Professor Hagrid, entered. "Hiya there students." He greeted us cheerfully. As always, his personality makes everyone smile.
He came inside me moments later, and then he pulled out and lied beside me. We just laid there him, embracing me as we relish the afterglow of our love making.
Harry knows that he might look like a stalker right now, but he just couldn't help himself. He glanced at the clock and saw ten minutes before eight. He hurriedly got up from his bed and took his phones in his pockets.
Them my hands travelled to my neck. The way he kissed that sensitive spot, the way he bit it and marked it, the way he stake his claim, the way the same mark is bruising right now. It turned me on even more. Every bite every kiss every touch.
"Damn, Dray." I heard Blaise behind me. "That is one deep shit you got there oh thee!" I heard him joked with dumbest fake poetic tone ever, as the others laugh, fucking dumbasses.
I looked at myself in the mirror in the suit I chose among the bunch. It was a gray tailor cut suite, with slightly tight slacks, black shoes and an emerald green tie.
'I like her…' He thought as he finally entered the door. He flopped down to his bed; forgetting dinner completely, really downright tired of the way his day went, from a meeting, checking the surveys his colleagues made, fixing the documents in his office, going to rounds, fixing some shits in the Slytherin lounge area, his extra classes and soccer practice. He quickly drifted off to sleep with one thought and resolve in mind. "I must have her…"
*The Business Guild- a club made for the exclusively for children of rich families that belonged in Slytherin, it only uses the name as a disguise… it has everything rich brats couldn't get inside the school. Like all kinds of luxury available at their homes (Jacuzzis, liquor etc.). Since only club members can enter a club's remises. The club rooms cannot be inspected without the proper paper work; which means that the Business Guild's club room was never inspected by the staff.
"Oh, speaking of running, Ron, that is one good high heels you got, it's still intact after all that running." I smiled at Ron.
"These are the Blacks, Mr. Sirius Black, and Ms. Hannah Jennica Black, she's a freshman like yourself." He said, gesturing to the girl. She was wearing a vintage but beautiful white long dress with a lot of flower embroidery. She's also wearing a brown velvet belt, a gold brooch, a white leather shoulder bag, an emerald earring and an emerald ring. She held her hair up in a bun, but the front is undone.
"Yes sir." Blaise and I said in unison, as we ran towards the stage. 'Why the hell did they sent Cho! They could've just sent the quiet, sweet Susan to get us.' I thought. 'That woman might be a Ravenclaw but she can kick our asses to the next century better than the vice president.'
"I've been there. I know how the rules worked. You can bend it in any way you want as long as you know where the loop hole is." Sirius explained.
"Great I actually have a s-daughter in first year myself." He gestured to the buffet table. "Ren darling!" He called.
There I met Draco in a white suit black shoes gray undershirt and a red bow tie. His hair slicked back a silver watch on his right arm and a silver snake ring on his left hand.
Okay, It has been so long since I updated this story. I believe I last updated this way back in 2012... Yes in 2012, and I posted it here in 2013. My writing style has changed drastically since then. There's still the occasional slip with the tenses, but everything about my writing got better. I was only 16 when I wrote this story. Now I'm 22. I am going to be updating this soon, but I need to edit every single thing first. Since reading some parts of this story makes me cringe like a motherfucker.
"Yep, it is. And she's one of the student substitute teachers… which means she ranked high in the overall IQ test… and to top it all off she looks like a model."
"You are not stopping them, you should concentrate on me, bitch!" I heard Millicent said before I felt a blow on my face that made me fell on my ass. I just sat there dumbfounded as Ron and Pansy both stopped their riot and stare agape at me; Ron in disbelief, Pansy in amusement.
So I opened my eyes, I stared at him for a moment; I looked at his deep hopeful eyes and DAMN! I felt really confused… I ran. I ran without taking the damn heels off. The thought of Ron and his brothers killing me for ruining their masterpiece never crossed my mind; as I ran as far as I can from that tent. I ran until I reached the lake.
After I locked the door I ran straight to my bathroom, shut the door and sat on the toilet bowl. 'I almost got caught…' I thought to myself, before I jerked off.
I was born a son of one of the best and manliest man in the world… and I know he would flip out if he ever knew about this, but… this is actually the first time that I will do something that I really want, the first time that I'll do something for me and not for somebody else.
"Ms. McGonagall, that's verbal abuse!" Sirius said arms crossed. "I was one of your good students, I just became like this after I graduate." Sirius claimed.
"So true." I said. Their engagement hasn't really sunk in, but I support them, my dad even if they were best friends is another story. Even though he knew Remus dresses like a girl in order to stay in Hogwarts during their time there, and he didn't thought of it in a bad way, but sadly he really didn't thought that Remus will like another boy, which is his other best friend. He said they betrayed him, but only he is thinking that way, even Peter is fine with the engagement, he said he "Saw it coming". To make things short my dad is just a HOMOPHOBIC sucker.
"Sorry about that." He said as he moved out making me hiss a little. "I promise it will be better." He said as he slammed back in. he repeated the motion until he hit something inside making me see stars.
"You ASSHOLE!" I shouted as I elbowed him. Making him fall on his ass. "You knew, you knew and you didn't tell me, earlier! You waited for me to cry before you told me!"
I stood up and looked at my almost empty room. My clothes were still in those two large Burberry suitcases, my laptop and two cellphones lie on top of the study table. And my books scattered everywhere. I sighed and stood up and walked towards my bathroom to take care of little Harry…
'Wow…" I thought to myself as I kissed the soft juicy lips of the girl of my dreams. And I swear, I've never kissed anyone with lips to match her's. Her lips were just a taste of heaven on earth. She pulled away first but I kissed her again just after a few breaths.
"I said…" He paused and laughed. "I said, I like flat chested body builder girls too, it doesn't really matter to me, and you're still the same girl I loved." He smiled.
"I guess alchohol really does wonders." He commented as turned around and kissed me lightly on the lips.
"Ughh! Why MUST I worry about this shit! I didn't sign up for this!" I shouted, throwing my arms as I stood up.
"Now, we will leave both of you here under the care of Leila, Nastasia and Kiara." Fred said gesturing to two hairdressers and a nail technician.
"It means that the cross-dressing experience of the graduates should never come out, The names of the cross-dressers would never be brought up ever again." Fred said.
"Hello there." I heard a very familiar voice said in front of me. I looked up and found Draco leaning beside a tree.
Then I resumed kissing her again, but it was brief. I kissed her again, but this time I kissed her neck. I nipped it a little, and then sucked it making sure it will leave a mark for everyone to see. I moved my hand towards her stomach in time when I moved to her collar bone.
"I'm so sorry dear, but the results are clear and final. And apparently, people know who you are Ms. Black." She said looking straight to my eye. "And they either wants to make you, break you or even worse…" she took a short pause before she said the next words which frightened me to the core. "Destroy you."
"Dray what are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be on patrol duty?" Blaise asked as he looked strangely at the person behind me. I turned around and saw him… The owner of those captivating silver orbs… It took me reaaaaalllyyy long before I realized I was staring with my mouth open. I hurriedly snap my mouth shut.
"Yes… and he's a total jerk!" Ron exclaimed, folding his arms over his chest. "He is a jerk towards every department, except his. And he'll start tomorrow!"
"Sirius Black?" A guy asked from behind us. We turned around and saw a red haired man about the age of forty, in a navy blue suit and a blue checkered tie, that looked clean and in order, but definitely inexpensive.
I continued walking and I suddenly felt the urge to visit the lake. What brings out the urge? I really don't know but I suddenly thought that with a moon like this; the lake must really look beautiful. So I walked there.
It was already free period when I reached the design room. I quickly walked towards my friends, who quickly noticed my state, bugged me the whole afternoon, then dragged me to my pinktastic room… I was automatically obligated to tell them EVERYTHING(starting from my humiliating fall, beside the fucking lake).
"You know Hogwarts; a secret is almost the same as a broadcast." Ron said. "Good thing no secret could be known unless you speak about them while in corridors."
"No I'll drive!" she said. "Harry come here." She gestured to the seat beside her. "Let these two sit back there and work their shit out." She said. I gladly moved beside her.
She fell down, ass-first as I pulled her hair; never minded the ugly piece of crap that tried in VAIN to pull me away from her friend.
"Okay, I'm sorry… now will you please answer these?" She said handing both Harry and Ron the papers. They both sat in front of the nearest table and began answering the survey.
"SIRIUS BLACK!" A very loud shout followed by a loud stomping was heard all over the house. Even if it is only in the first floor the intensity, and volume was so high, it reached the third floor where Sirius' and Harry's rooms were located.
When I finally stopped the first thing I noticed was a lot of other students, from different departments circled around us, next thing I noticed was the damage I created to Millicent, which is not really that much, as she can still stand just limping a bit (only a
"Mmmm, Draco, more…" I said gasping as he pushed all the way in without warning. "Ah… o-ow…" I said as the pain of the situation hit me.
"So she's Sirius Black's daughter eh. How strange. Girls with her caliber, money, brains and talent rarely go to our school; usually they go overseas to Bouxbatons Academy of France to study, where they can be taught with other girls of the same caliber." Flitwick explained. "That's the main reason our slots for girls weren't filled at the end of the enrolment period." He added.
"So that's why I never read anything about cross-dressers in the past records." I said, a little enlightened with the fact that Fred said.
'What the hell happened?' I thought to myself as I tried solving how many water will spill if I put a gram of Au (gold) in a full glass of salt water. And man! I was thinking about Draco's proposal(?) too much that I forgot the formula of whateverthefuck.
"No Herms! I absolutely didn't mean it like that!" I said shooting up, my voice louder than expected, earning me stares, which by the way are not affecting me. "It's just that…"
"Another sigh, Ron and I'll throw this French curve straight to your face!" Harry yelled at the love-sick teen by the window.
"What are you doing here?" I asked; looking disbelievingly at Ron. "You weren't even ready when we left. And now look at you!" Well Ron looked like a freaki'n queen right now in that silver velvet gown with a long slit on the right leg, and a black straight line on the front, it is topped with a large silver necklace with multi-colored Swarovski stones. And a silver bangle, his hair was tied in a loose bun with silver chopsticks with chains with beads on the end, his shoes is a pair of silver stiletto wedges with black lines like the dress… and I'm jealous of how he rocked that red lipstick, long lashes and smokey eyes without looking like complete whore.
"Look at me!" I said with a commanding tone. She immediately shot up and looked at me. I felt my stomach churn at what I saw, her left eye was covered in black, and there's blood dripping from her nose and the left corner of her mouth. "Why did they do this to you?" I said as I wiped the blood and tears with my hanky.
Well it is beautiful, a real work of art. I wore it on my left ring finger, which it suited perfectly.
What's even worse is that I haven't seen Draco in a whole damn week… talk about "love sick school girl mode!" and I'm not even a girl! And now I have a call!
"Suck." I ordered him. He quickly obliged as I felt him suck hard on my finger. I looked at him and to be honest it made a quite erotic sight. By the time I pulled out my finger it was perfectly lubricated. "Now, Babe; this will feel a little weird at first, but I promise you it will feel good later." I explained. He nodded his understanding.
Harry followed the man, obediently. He glanced at Sirius looking a little bit worried, but Sirius just smiled.
"You're going already?" Remus asked as he entered the room, balancing a tray of iced tea on the left hand, and holding a plate full of home baked donuts on the right. "Won't you at least stay to finish this?" He asked.
I want it to be real, to be something I'll remember forever, to be something to cherish if we ended up together. And something to bring me pain if we ended up apart.
"Mind doing that faster." I demanded, which he didn't really listen to, as he went slower. Which drives me nuts! "Dray please I beg you come in here already!" I said motioning on my side.
"I understand, I do it sometimes to, but you don't look like the type who listens to MCR." Harry said, amused.
I whined a little at this. I really want more. I reached out my arms and pulled him down, I kissed him. He returned the kiss, but he didn't stop fingering my hole, which turned me on even more.
"Since you might have just STOMPED your way here, I'm letting HARRY borrow that new Porche I bought a week ago." Sirius explained.
So I took a really deep breath as I approach the girl I'm going to ask out, I know for a fact that she will definitely say yes, but… then she might get embarrassed and say no.
Hermione settles back into Theo’s lap and offers him a petit four from a crystal plate. She chases it with a chaste peck on his lips.
Harry scoffs. “Whatever, I’ll just…” He sets the bottles to rights with a sweep of his hand. Another little complicated flourish and the icing swirls and covers up where their fingers had been. The golden letters aren’t quite as tidy and the butterflies still lurch about, so he adds an extra dusting of pink sugar crystals to the strawberries.
Harry’s heart inflates, filling his chest, and he realizes… he’s gone for this boy—completely and undeniably, truly and rightly buggered.
Draco’s mind hitches on the endearment. He watches Luna skip across the room and into Ginny’s waiting arms. The growl in Draco’s chest loosens, settling near his baseline rumble—a purr strangely buoyant, a lightness akin to relief.
“Oh?” Draco squirms in Harry’s lap and fuck if Harry’s cock isn’t stirring against the curve of warm bare skin. “What else could you possibly want? Seems to me you have everything you need, birthday boy.” He smears icing onto the tip of Harry’s nose.
The curl springs free, and Draco presses forward, capturing Harry’s hopes with a kiss. Harry’s eyes go wide and he freezes, mind hitching on
Draco swipes a moan into Harry’s mouth with his tongue. Harry opens willingly and is immediately lost. Draco’s body shifts against him and Harry gives in to the movement, an undulation of the hips, a drag of his cock against a sharp hip bone. Somewhere in the back of his mind Harry registers the party and his magic strobes a warning. But the caress of soft lace, the weight of firm muscle, the taste of lips as sweet as he imagined snuffs out any alarm.
As he works, Harry studies Draco’s features, beautifully flushed and achingly gorgeous. His heart trips over a beat.
Pansy’s voice travels over his shoulder as he retreats. “You’d better quench that thirst in the hallway or I’ll never speak to you again.”
He’s almost a half inch taller than Harry and perfectly lean, somewhere between Jack Skellington and that wicked hot white-haired guy from
Hermione’s suspicious squint in response to Harry’s query at dinner about where one might find a sloth brain, a Class A Controlled Substance required to brew the Draught of Living Death, put any subversive plan to rest.
Luna returns to decorating a silver tinsel Christmas tree set up in the corner. “My best ideas strike whilst standing naked in the middle of a mushroom fairy ring.” She transfigures a red bauble into a red-capped mushroom ornament.
He tears the balloon hat off his head, twisting it in his fist. The penis tip bulges grotesquely and the latex squeaks so loudly he nearly misses a soft knock at the open door. He glances up at Draco holding a plate piled high with cake and strawberries. Paper cranes and butterflies flutter around his head. He looks like a silver-haired nymph or a stormy-eyed elf or something equally pretty.
“Devon?” Draco laughs, a bubbly rumble that sets his Adam’s apple bobbing against the top button of his velvet shirt. “Oh darling, Devon’s out. Fitz is in. Do keep up.” He bends to brush wrinkles out of the cape. His trousers hug his long legs and pull taut over his hips. The smooth expanse of velvet over the side-divot in his arse broadcasts the fact that he’s not wearing any pants.
Harry knows that tucked somewhere between the verdant leaves and iridescent petals of lilies, narcissus, and dahlias, Draco’s skin is marked by a faded evil long banished. Harry hasn’t thought about the Dark Mark for years, doesn’t even notice it anymore.
“You can’t be serious,” Percy says. He squints at a photo of a man wearing what looks like a lace romper with a leather codpiece and appeals to Harry. “He can’t be serious.”
Draco’s stern expression transforms as he laughs, and Harry can’t help but to touch, to get his hands on pale skin.
Ron grabs Harry’s bicep, bunching his hoodie and a bit of his skin into his clenched fist. Harry barely notices the pinching sting because the yellow chenille varsity font emblazoned on the back of Draco’s jacket spells out…
“Oh, come on, teacher’s pet.” The lock pops open with a satisfying click, and Harry opens the door with a dramatic arm sweep. “Mrs Gregory always chose
Harry had survived October’s black-polished fingertips peeking out from the long sleeves of oversized jumpers, and withstood November’s clinging sleek turtlenecks and tweed trousers in monochrome palettes. Not a single flame flickered.
New Year’s celebration was fairly easily skived off in favour of a quiet, flame-free evening babysitting Rose and Hugo. Ron and Hermione hadn’t had a proper date in ages and Harry was giddy to oblige. And thank Merlin for small mercies. The next day, Luna showed Harry photos from the party. Draco smirking in a sheer black shirt and
Harry guides his truck into the parking space and slams the gear into park. Morning light angles through the windshield, a bright veil beyond which he can barely make out the yard lines striping the practice football field.
” Pansy loosens her grip and Ron continues. “They’ll happen anywhere, anytime. In the shower, boner. Gassing up the car, boner. In the grocery, boner—”
a masochist, Harry chances a darting glance at Draco. Draco hides a smirk behind his glass. Pansy, scarlet lips stretched into a wide smirk, leans to whisper in Draco’s blushing ear.
Draco holds out Harry’s jacket. The blush high on his cheekbones matches the reddening splotches dotting his neck. “Your jacket… ?”
“Erm.” Harry chews the inside of his cheek. This is entirely too much talk about cocks and penises especially with the one and only penis to whom he’s attracted. No, wait. He’s attracted to Draco and not his cock. Though he wants that, too.
The Golden Boy editor-in-chief is of course expected at the Golden Anniversary. Percy had a field day with the decorations. Even Xenophilius, retired now six years since Harry took over, would be in attendance to receive an Award of Journalistic Merit from the Minister. Nothing short of lying on death’s bed could prevent Harry from attending.
Malfoy vanishes the cigarettes and draws Harry to him with a firm hand to the back of Harry’s neck. Harry goes easily, melting into Malfoy’s comforting solidity and warming magic, tension slackening like a stayed hangman’s rope.
Harry’s heart trips over a beat, caught unawares by the confession. He lifts his gaze to meet grey eyes, shining and vulnerable. “
Harry rests his aching temple on the table. Beside him, his phone displays comments on the twitter post he’s checked for the thousandth time.
Harry draws back, cringing. “Oh god. I had quite a bit to drink that day. I should never have said—”
conference room, the table is strewn with half-eaten snacks, empty sandwich wrappers, and crumpled parchment—the aftermath of days spent planning the first issue of the spring season. Storyboards alive with moving images and pastel colors line the glass walls whilst outside, December snow falls.
Not only does his artfully contrived perch on the arm of a creamy leather chair afford him a direct line of sight to the door, but his magic flares, a white-hot beast attuned to Harry’s magical wavelength, stretching to life and licking warmth at the base of his spine.
“I know.” Draco fists Harry’s curls briefly, eliciting a cascade of promising thrills down Harry’s spine, before releasing him. “I’m leaving,” he calls out to the heathens, “in three… two…” He exits the kitchen with a parting wink.
“Ah.” Draco takes his pen from Harry and places it exactly parallel with the others. “Wankgate 2021. Our legacy.” He chews on his lip. “Twitter is still blowing up.
By the time Harry enters the library for sixth period study hall, the school has been abuzz with ejaculation speculation all day, and Harry has a headache. The library offers quiet respite away from heated physics debates about the force and angle required to jettison semen into an outlet, and Mrs Pomfrey’s health lectures on the advantages of masturbation and self-care.
The drunk shuffles away. Harry wrinkles his nose and the stones beneath the man’s feet lift to trip him.
Draco purses his lips, and with a sharp tug to his shirt sleeve and crook of his elbow, checks his watch. “If we leave in the next
He focuses on plucking fruit, shoving his hands deeper into the brambles, letting the thorns prick him back to his senses. Even in his limited experience, he recognizes the fragility of this thing between them, like autumn fruit, heavy with promise, yet easily bruised.
Draco tips the liquor into his mouth, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallows, a wave beneath the silver links of that fucking choker.
-vanilla they are. It draws a blush to the back of Draco’s neck and elicits enthusiastic retching sounds from the kids.
In a delightful and ironic twist of karmic fate, Harry contracted Dragon Pox from Rose and recovery kept him from attending Pansy’s Valentine’s Day birthday celebration. All the better since he didn’t think he would have been safe around birthday candles and Draco in red leather pants hanging off the arm of his current fuck toy, DevonFitzArchibald the Fourth.
“It’s not! Er, I mean…” More petals flutter to the ground, petals the exact purple of oxford cotton that Harry knows wrinkles softly under his clutching fingers.
He sweeps a velvet cape off his shoulders, revealing a matching neck-to-toe outfit in a rich indigo hue. The cape billows and flutters in shimmering violets as Draco drapes it over the back of the leather chair.
Colourful embroidered flowers cover the suit jacket and trousers, budding and blooming in a continuous loop. A heavy silver chain bridges a wide leather cuff at Draco’s wrist and a matching choker at his neck. Black velvet hems his trousers and frames the jacket’s lapels. Unbuttoned, the jacket swings open…
He presses a firm thumb against the corner of Harry’s mouth and with a rough swipe, delivers a bead of ice cream to his own mouth. Harry’s magic flares up his back, popping at each vertebra like WWW firecrackers on a string. With each crack, the flowers covering the Christmas tree ignite one by one.
“I’m knackered.” He picks languidly at the fat, pink loops of Aunt Muriel’s crocheted afghan draped across the cushions.
Scorpius starts, jostling loose a cereal crumb caught in the blond cowlick tuft at his crown. He grabs Harry’s tea sat next to the hob and pours it over the appliance. Sparks spew from the slots, and with a loud pop, the toaster dies.
“Oh, Harry!” she exclaims. “Your Wrackspurt energy field is muddy.” She sets the cake on the counter next to champagne bottles chilling in stasis. The corners of her mouth tilt down. “It’s the balloons, isn’t it?”
A gaggle of tiny sophomores stand at the end of the aisle, mouths agape, eyes wide, books clutched to their chests.
With a hitched breath, Draco swipes his sticky thumb along Harry’s bottom lip, catching gooey crumbs.
“What’s all this ruckus?” Molly says from the kitchen doorway. She wipes her brow with a dishtowel. “Merlin, as if the Howler from Mrs Higgenbotham wasn’t enough.” She plunks her hands on her hips. “Ronald Weasley, you know better than to trespass, even if her berries are the best!” She blows errant hair out of her eyes. “At least the bramble jam will be worth the effort.”
The leather is still warm, surrounding him in Draco’s residual body heat and scent. Harry’s head spins. Draco’s all over him. His cock throbs.
Draco anchors his hands against Harry’s head and jerks his hips in an elliptical rhythm in time with a litany of punchy exhales of
“Well, now… ” Draco lifts Harry’s head with a firm hand to his jaw. An earnest, hopeful expression suffuses Draco’s face and nearly brings Harry to his knees.
Malfoy moves as if to offer, and Harry yanks his hand from his pocket, littering the stones with papers. He digs the cigarette out of the pack and puts it in his mouth. The taste is sharp and biting.
“You can tell every one of your friends, I don’t care anymore, I can’t fucking lose you. This last week has been the worst of my life. I won’t do that to myself again.”
“Well, I – “ Ron was swiftly cut off with a groan as Harry suspected Hermione had kicked him underneath the table. “I mean, yeah, bang out of line.”
In reality, Harry was a little nauseous. Watching Moody use Avada on that spider made it impossible to not think of his parents. One second the spider was alive, the next it just wasn’t. It had no idea what was going to happen. Just a split second of green light, and then nothing, no chance for them – or it, to defend itself.
It was still relatively early, and a fresh breeze was floating through the front doors of the castle. Harry made a beeline through them, making his way towards the lake, hands shoved in his pockets. He imagined Sirius would not be too pleased with him walking around alone outside, but he couldn’t handle being inside any longer. Harry walked quickly trying to put as much space between him and the castle as he could, he noticed the further he got from Malfoy the less likely he was to experience his emotions. It was one thing for him to know Ron and Hermione were worried about him; it was another to feel that anxiety inside him.
“Harry decided to wait until the very last possible moment to get his things packed,” Draco complained and then waved his wand. Harry watched as his things started to zoom into his trunk.
“Hey, you here with me?” Draco asked, a relaxed smile on his face, a beam of sun cutting through from the window glinting off his platinum hair. Harry shook his head, attempting to clear it.
