Making his way over to the front door, Harry bends down and checks the mail, wandering down the hallway as he does so. Bills, bills, a letter to Uncle Vernon, weird old fashioned letter... with his name on it? Harry never gets post, so he is intregued by the letter. He pulls the wax seal in half, but as he is so distracted, Dudley takes the chance to snatch the letter out of his hands and shout at his dad that 'Look! Harry has post!' to which Harry responds with a sigh. He knows he isn't getting his letter, today or ever. Uncle Vernon will probably burn it.
"These people are his only living relations, Minerva. We have no other choice; besides, he'll be safer here than anywhere else. Hardly anyone knows of the link between these people and him, and I can protect this house without many qualms," Albus retorts, "So it's better that he stays here until he is... of age to come and join us. After that, we can... Re-evaluate, if you are really so appalled. Fair?"
The dark haired boy smiles and offers his hand to Harry. "Hello Draco, and nice to meet you, Heir Potter. My name is Blaise Zabini, heir to the house of Zabini, but please, call me Blaise." He seems charming and Harry naturally gravitates towards the boy's pleasant aura, grabbing the offered hand and shaking it. "And this," the boy continues, "is Pansy Parkinson, heir to the house of Parkinson."

A short walk brings them to what seems to be a shop with lots of boxes to Harry, and Draco catches on to Harry's confusion an explains to the brown haired boy that this was a wand shop. Inside, a young brunette saleswoman directs them to a cabinet of dark wood wands, and hands Harry a thirteen-inch ebony wand with a dragon heartstring core. Harry feels like the wand fits in his hand, and it seems like the store owner does too, for she nods and takes the money that Draco offers. One last apparition, and Harry and Draco are left with only themselves and Harry's snake at a train platform, surrounded by many other families with owls, frogs, and even rats, Harry notes with disbelief! He runs a finger down Umbra's scales soothingly as he takes a seat near where Draco has done the same, and waits for a train to arrive.
"Are you ready, Decus? They're headed towards us."
"But you can call me Pansy, of course!" The girl chimes, and goes to hug Harry. He has no idea how to handle such a forward gesture and fumbles around looking slightly terrified for a moment before Pansy lets him go with a grin. "Come on then!" She runs off with a regal spring in her step down to the lake side where the large man is waiting with many of the children, and the three boys follow. As they get close to the lakeside, Harry notices all the boats and startles.
"If you'd like, you can go. There's nothing stopping you. My name is Harry, by the way, nice meeting you... I didn't know snakes could talk to humans!"
"Why are you so... Small?" Draco ponders, and before Harry has the chance to think of a reply, Draco continues. "And why do you seem so in awe at everything around you? Everything's completely ordi- unless you're a mudblood. Are you?" Draco's blue eyes bare into Harry's with a glint that says 'insult me if you dare'.
Madam Malkin's is substantial, and the as the two boys walk in, Harry gasps at the amount of robes hung up and folded around various areas of the shop. Draco's step doesn't falter, as he heads over towards the rack of plain, black uniform robes. Glancing at Harry, he frowns before moving to the left of the rack and selecting a fairly small set of robes, along with a tie, shirt, jumper and trousers.
Draco grabs Harry's arm and manouvers the small boy next to him, and proudly explains "Blaise, Pansy, this is Harry Potter."
Harry thinks for a moment and then decides to let the hat make the choice for him. He wouldn't want to make the wrong choice.
A few boats over, a ginger boy exclaims excitedly "Did you hear that Harry Potter is in our year? I can't wait to meet him!" Harry ducks his head, not wanting to draw attention, but he decides he'll introduce himself to the excited ginger soon. He seems friendly.
When they reach the Creepy Crawly Cave (really, Harry thinks that name is awful), Dudley is already banging on the front of a glass tank, and Harry can see a large snake inside. Dudley starts screaming at the snake, and Harry can't control himself, really, he just sees red, and suddenly the glass is gone. Dudley tumbles into the snake tank, looking startled and not getting up. Harry looks at the snake, then says:
"Harry." Draco has an exasperated expression on his face, disbelief at how little the supposed saviour actually knew about his world. He supposes he'll have to explain everything as if the boy was a Muggleborn. "Parseltounge is the language spoken by serpents. You were speaking Parseltongue to your snake in the shop when you picked it up."
That night, on their street, a light goes out, And then another. Nobody notices, of course, as it is god knows what hour in the middle of the night, but there is a very odd looking man standing at the end of Privet Drive, holding a little cylinder, and all of the light from the street lamps seems to be retreating into his device, for lack of a better word. At first glance, this man is alone, but as he rambles down the cold tarmac road, his head turns slowly to face a grey cat, sitting regally in front of a (very distasteful) garden shed, half rotten and smothered in cobwebs. One would this that perhaps this cat would be interested in all the spiders, but it takes no notice in them. In fact, this cat, which before now seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary, looks up slyly, and with a glance from the older man, transforms into a woman.
"No," Harry replies in a meek tone, "My parents were both wizards, if mudblood means what I think it does. I was brought up by... Muggles? Yeah, I think it was muggles." And then, he adds as an afterthought, "My name's Harry Potter, by the way."

chapter dedicated to Shipper2166 for complimenting a dead 5 year fic ♥
But when the letters keep coming, day after day, Vernon starts to get angry; not just frustrated angry, but really, quite mad angry. He ends up nailing a plank over the letterbox, and locking all the doors and windows. On the Sunday of that week, as Uncle Vernon boasts about there being no post on Sundays, and mutters about finally having a day in peace, his final straw snaps.
He makes his way to the stool and sits down, feeling the hat placed on his head, and startles as a voice rings through his mind.
As the train pulls up to Platform 9¾, Draco stands regally and strides towards the train doors, and Harry follows eagerly. Upon boarding the train, they don't have to walk long to find an empty compartment, and once they do they settle in, sitting opposite each other. Before any conversation can ensue, a small brunette opens the compartment door and speaks in a somewhat meek tone.
"Very well. I shall join you." And with this, she slithers around Harry's neck, and he strides out of the enclosure, head held high and proud to be seen with such a regal animal. Draco looks proud, whilst Severus is baffled at the language the young boy just spoke, and the shopkeeper claps his hands loudly, announcing that the match is perfect, and the two really do make a wonderful pair together.
(See the end of the chapter for
After approximately four minutes, Harry watches Snape's cloaks billow behind the man as he strides back down the gravel path, towards Harry. He doesn't say anything, so Harry waits for him to pass, expecting to just be able to fall back into step behind the man. He does just that, and however much the blond behind Snape startles Harry, he doesn't show it on his face. The two boys share a glance, and Harry notices how the brilliant blue eyes hold a shade of discern at Harry - the brunette wonders what is unacceptable about him this time. As soon as the trio pass beyond the not-gates, as Harry has taken to calling them, Snape holds out his hand yet again, and Harry watches as the mystery boy lays a single finger upon the wrist of the older man. He decides to do what he did before, and places his hand on top of Snape's, and the gut-wrenching sensation returns as they... Move.
Harry pukes.
"Hagrid!" Albus exclaims. "Did you bring him in one piece?"
• • •
, though, a loud authoritative voice calls the first years to attention and leads them through another set of great doors.
"Harry Potter? But you're so tiny and ordinary," Draco scoffs, "How you defeated the Dark Lord as a baby... Well, that's a mystery to me. I'm Draco Malfoy. You won't have heard of me, brought up by muggles, but my family is important. Come on," Draco gestures to the counter, "I'll select some casual robes for you and then we can pay. Severus will be waiting for us outside."
Harry closes his hands around the box. "Thanks. Do I... Is there... somewhere to change?"
"FIRS' YEARS THIS WAY!" An
"Aye, I reck'n th' littl' un fell asleep 'alf the way 'ere! Can' say I blames 'im, miself, it's been a tad rough on 'im today, I reckons. Can ya imagines all this runnin' about fer a lad of lil' Harry here's age, eh? Must be quite tirin' on the young 'un," Hagrid muses, partly to himself, and partly to the other two. "M'sure he'll grow up a fine young wizard." Setting the baby boy down on a doorstep below a door emblazoned with a number 4, and laying a note atop his body, the three share a knowing look before departing. Hagrid drives his bike away, but the other two are there one instant, and gone the next, almost as if by magic, it would have seemed to any onlookers.
"You don't have the right to recieve letters, boy."
They all reach the front, and a man with a large grey beard sitting at the middle of the table in the front stands, as the hall quietens in anticipation.
And another, and another, until the room is full of them. Harry sneaks a glace out of the window, and sees at least a hundred owls crowded outside his house, if not more. The owls, however, are not what has caught Harry's attention; out of the corner of his eye, Harry spotted a flash of black, not unline a towel outside his door. Harry hears a strange word being whispered, which sounds something like 'alophamira', although he can't be sure, and then he hears the click of the door latch opening. With a quick glance around the room, Harry notices that none of the Dursleys have heard what he did, so he creeps quietly out of the room and into the hallway, only to be greeted with the sight of a tall, scowling man with black hair down to his shoulders and a large black... robe? Cloak? Harry isn't sure, and along with this uncertainty comes the realisation that a complete stranger was standing in his hallway. He doesn't quite know what to do, so he just says,
"You knew?"
A Patronus finds them cuddled up, sipping wine, and sweetly arguing over the merits of wand use in imperial wizarding society. Draco jumps up, kisses Harry in an overly domestic way, and is gone. And not a moment too soon it seems, as Hermione and Ron are suddenly in the house, he can feel them in the wards, and they are heading up, to where they now he will be, his favorite study.
"What? And look like a muggle plebeian? Honestly, it is like you do know m- ahhh-" Draco's half-hearted tirade is cut short when the bastard pulls his hair, hard.
"Malfoy, what is it that I am listening to? Please explain yourself."
Ron looked as if in slow motion at his dirty, muddy shoes.
“French tarts.”
"You missed some, my- what do I call the Lord's bed boy? Just my slut?"
After that it only gets worse, Potter will wear 'scrunchies' on his wrist and tie Draco's hair up whenever he gets the chance. In the kitchen, when Draco trying to show him the proper way to make a French tart, Potter pressed against him, pushing Draco's front into the counter, ghosting his big, strong, capable hands up Draco's sides, his neck, and then fast as a devil, twisting his hair into a knot on the top of his head with a velvet green monstrosity.
Draco a kiss on Harry’s cheek and said, as if it was any other day “How was the workshop, did the spell you were working on work?”
"I'm bisexual!"
"By Jove and Morgana, I am leaving and you can pick the chair out yourself!"
“Right, so you should definitely bring him to Sunday's meal okay? I can’t wait to see everyone’s face.”
Now, Draco was snogging Harry Potter, the man that had charmed his friends, and knew what he needed to do. He needed to make nice with Granger and Weasley so that they could all lead a charmed life where they pretended they never wanted to kill each other because he had fallen in love with their best friend. The opportunity came way sooner than expected when Harry left to his workshop and Draco stayed home, he basically lived with Harry, though the manor was his home, and he loved it, Harry and him had talked about turning it into some sort summer school for muggle born students to go to before Hogwarts, and also a magical orphanage year round. He would need to hire staff and get it kid proofed, and so many other things that it started to give him a headache. He was in their favorite study, the baroque one, reading about structures of wizarding governments around the world, in his silver silk robe, with his hair tied up in a neat bun that Harry had put there, along with a couple of hickeys, decorating Draco’s pale skin, sipping tea, when he heard voices, coming toward him. He grabbed his wand, but he already knew he wasn’t going to use it. Because you really must make a good impression on the love of your life’s closest friends.
They find a lovely chaise in the baroque style and make their way through the labyrinth of the vintage magical furniture store that Draco adores.
"Harry, darling! These tarts are amazing! And the wine to go with, incredible. When did you become such a foodie?"
Harry brushes his thumb over the corner of Malfoy's lip, before pushing his thumb into that taunting mouth.
“Astute observation, I would expect no less from the brightest of our age,” Draco said, it was wistful and amused not mean.
“Books and wine dates.”
Harry finally masters the French tart Draco taught him to make. Draco knows he will wake up to the smell of strawberries and butter, but that also means not waking up next to Harry.
“Harry we have the best new-- Oh! You’re not Harry,” Hermione had started talking before taking in the statuesque view of Draco, in his opulence on a beautiful baroque lounge chaise, reading a beautiful looking book.
"Am I really your boyfriend? Draco Malfoy are we courting?"
“It is past time they know, and I am doing really well so far, I think they really like me,” Draco said, loud enough for their audience to hear.
“Wait Hermione, don’t---”
"Right, oh Ron! That smells really good, what's in it?"
"Hmm, maybe he's snogging some ritzy girl, dunno."
Harry is so overwhelmingly grateful that his friends have just spared him from a night of melancholy without Draco that he forgets about to very telling sets of things, two wine glasses, to sets of slippers by the couch, and two, very, very banned books about cannibalistic blood rituals that Draco and him had been reading out of morbid curiosity. That was until Hermione stopped short in the open door way, and looking around, maybe for the person that should also be here. Muddy Waters was still playing on the record player, the newest piece of technology that the house tolerated in this room.
“I’ll think about,” Harry says, looking to Hermione for help.
“Oh, are we interrupting?” Hermione says, almost hopefully.
"Harry, she needed someone to talk, I don't think--"
“We have an announcement! We’re having a baby!”
Harry reaches forward, and kisses his nose.
"Oh my god!"
"Honestly, it's like you're not listening!"
No, that was just Draco.
This is a sentiment he hears, and he understands it for what it is: 'take care of yourself, Potter, I can't be worrying about you only eating crisps when I am not here'.
“That fucking robe.”
“Okay, I see I guess,” Hermione looks like she has all the pieces to a puzzle but doesn’t know what the picture on the box looks like.
Draco nuzzles against Harry and agrees. If Harry knew that Draco felt so strongly about the chair he never would have even attempted to pick it himself.
"Or you could just bring her next time?” Molly says, innocently, too innocently.
“Let me get this straight, you Harry James Potter, were having a night in and reading? Was this a date? What were you reading?”
"I don't have to go today," Harry whispers evenly, sweetly, calmly.
Three
It takes him a moment to respond, because, well Ginny looks radiant, and he doesn't even feel a twinge of interest. After the dry spell, the fighting, and then the breakup, Harry used to find himself wishing that he could go beg to make it right. It would be so perfect, he would be a Weasley, for real. But then he followed Ginny's gaze to his wrist, where lo and behold, he was wearing a silver velvet scrunchie that he had taken out of Malfoy's hair when they had caught up in passing, well taken out is a light word, Harry had yanked it, and then Draco's hair and through the haze of a passionate kiss, he had forgotten to take it off or put it back in his lover's hair.
“Okay, anyway mate, we just popped over to talk about baby names and maybe---”
"Did you know that Harry wears silk robes? I saw one in his bedroom."
Draco Malfoy is in stupid bloody love with Harry Potter, there is just no way around it. Two months ago, Draco invited him along to Snake Club (coined after Pansy came back from America having watched Fight Club) and Harry had the good grace to not be too nice to all of his friends. They got absolutely hammered and Blaise Zabini had told his boyfriend that if he ever needed help with any nefarious plots, the Snake Club would have his back. Harry roared with laughter, and gave Pansy, Blaise, Millicent, and Goyle a kiss on the cheek good night.
"Your 'study', the green parlor that has the muggle records in it is decorated in the baroque style, with baroque paintings. Thus we need a beautiful yet comfortable baroque chaise."
"Okay, good to know. I am proud of you. And while we are doing announcements, Harry I’m pregnant."
At his rapid approach, Harry turns his way with an easy warm smile, which crumples upon seeing Draco's now wet face.
"Shut up and shower with me, can not be late to the  Weasel clan meeting, can you?"
"If I knew it was that easy to wear you down, I would have started calling you 'Lord' sooner."
This is when Harry decides to enter, Draco isn’t surprised he didn’t stay too long at the workshop, he probably had just one new spell to try out, and it was a Saturday.
"You're so brilliant, sometimes I feel drunk on your words. You are good, better than most, it's easy to be good when you are born into it, but having to find good on your own, by yourself, you are the golden one here."
The trial lasted hours.
When Harry got down to the viewing stands, the Slytherins were already on the pitch and practicing drills together. Malfoy clocked him immediately, and soared up effortlessly to hover by the stands.
"You can't control me," Malfoy snapped. "I'll come with you but if I want to get high I will, and if I want to be mean to you I will."
Harry's rant was stopped by the feeling of warm lips pressing against his, and slowly he relaxed against them.
"God, Potter, I did have to do
"This is kissing," Draco murmured against his lips, barely brushing them with his own. "Do you want this?"
Hermione looked at him in confusion. "Okay," she said slowly. "That's not great but reading a diary doesn't make you evil."
It was always a possibility, but a painful one.
"Just remember, Potter, nobody likes boys who kiss and tell," he said, eyes narrowed. "But there's nothing to tell with us, is there? Because nothing happened on the pitch yesterday. Nothing."
As he swayed, Draco rolled a mouthful of opal-coloured liquid around his mouth from his glass, enjoying the slightly acrid aftertaste that gave away its high potency, but then sighed. The music was pumping through his veins, the wine was going to his head just as it should, but he didn't feel completed yet.
he thought.
As he walked forwards, the dark wizard became the target of even more attacking spells, but his faithful servants advanced with him, laying down their lives in odd little rows behind him as they deflected the spells intended for him.
"I want you to spit in my mouth next time, Malfoy.... God, I want him to ram his tongue down my fucking throat-"
"OK Potter, let's just finish this mess of a shoot so we can all go the fuck home," Malfoy snapped, clapping his hands once.
As Harry's mouth tightened over him, Draco's apologies became louder and more profuse, until suddenly it was all over, and hot shame drowned out all the remorse he'd previously felt.
It felt to Harry like the situation would've been less wildly unfair if he actually knew he liked Malfoy. What did that bloody potion know that he didn't?
Harry rolled his eyes. "Ok, drama queen. If I asked, we both know you'd say no. So I'm telling you: this is the schedule for your day. You're spending it with me, and you're not getting high, and you're going to be nice to me."
And there, at the centre of attention as ever, was Draco Malfoy, parading on the frozen part of the Lake as though it was a runway.
"I love you," Harry choked.
"Just please don't say something you'll regret," he insisted.
"No, let me help him," Harry insisted, and Malfoy whipped round with an expression of unprecedented rage, his eyes suddenly lucid.
Why was it, Draco wondered, that he found it so easy to shut off all emotions when he was hurting Potter, but now that the boy was standing up for himself, all Draco could feel in response was frustration and confusion? He bit into the apple harder than necessary, careful not to let Potter see what had suddenly ignited inside him.
Harry downed his glass obediently and reached for another, desperate for the buzz of courage that the alcohol could give him.
Harry slipped out of the Slytherin forms before the sunrise that Saturday morning, and headed quickly for his own dorm to fetch his Invisibility Cloak.
Luckily, Draco knew exactly what was going on.
had begun to flit through Draco's mind, and he wasn't sure how he felt about that.
too much after a couple weeks without me? Or because I didn't write you a pretty little love letter over the holidays? Because your ex sexually assaulted me? Because I won't let you say you fucking
"It is a weird choice for you," Ron conceded. "Although I guess it explains the obsession with him?"
Harry snorted in amusement. "Worked for you last time," he smirked.
"Much better, you teasing bastard," Malfoy replied with a glare.
Malfoy fought a blush; God, since when was he so embarrassable? "Just do you want me to - ok, fine. If you must know, she groped me. Tried to give me a handjob. I was... still intoxicated. And it stopped before it got going at all. Happy with that?"
"Come in to work again looking like that and I'm gonna ram this hairspray up your arse," Jenna had hissed at him only this morning. "Boy who fucking lived, more like boy who fucking lived to make me wanna cut his throat with a blunt edged comb!"
Harry left Malfoy to sleep in the next morning and made his way down to breakfast alone.
He was plagued over the following days and weeks by constant obsessive thoughts about the other boy, driven mad when he couldn't see him, and constantly trying to find a way to get his attention, all while simultaneously despising him. All in all, this made for a pretty fragile disposition.
"Unless... unless you're too good to hang out with a boy raised by Muggles?"
Malfoy's cheeks flamed at this accusation, and he felt forced to retaliate.
"Do you promise?" Harry panted.
On the third day after the Potions class, there was an important Quidditch match.
Harry wasn't sure if he wanted to bang his own head on the desk or bang Malfoy on it more, torn between despising the bastard and being totally consumed by him.
Except this little boy was seventeen and losing his mind. And the bottle in the father's hand was not nourishment, but instead spiked with almost enough ecstasy to kill his son. And in taking it, Draco was signing an unspoken contract that would ruin his life.
The girl's cheeks flamed red with anger, but she didn't stop there. "May I please at least give him some of my antidote, sir?" she asked bravely.
Instead, he stripped and slid under Draco's sheets, only shivering slightly as the familiar scent washed over him. It wasn't as strong as it had been last time he was there - but last time he'd been there he had been in Draco's arms, the other boy's flat stomach pushed up burningly against Harry's back, so it was no wonder really that the scent had been stronger.
Mallory stepped up gladly, and his demeanour remained cool, composed.
And he was not disappointed - they arrived like clockwork at 6pm to take their usual seats. Granger had her monkeys well trained.
"Mate, I can see you right now - So can anyone else who has eyes."
"How could you be so
Tears were dripping onto the words as he wrote now, but he didn't stem them.
"Do you know something, Malfoy?" Hermione asked with sudden suspicion.
"Not the hospital," Draco croaked again. "They'll take my...." he coughed repulsively. "They'll take my drugs away from me and they'll tell my father."
"I know."
Harry's eyes widened as the realisation sunk in. "
"Be honest, should I just kill myself?" he asked.
How do you try and explain what that's like?
"Did you literally just get kicked off the Quidditch team over this, Potter?" Draco asked, delighted. "Do you literally fancy me too much to play? That's disgusting!"
Hermione looked at him with pity. "Why are you defending him, Harry?" she asked. "Even if he wasn't directly involved, he was still pretty unpleasant with the aftermath."
, he told himself mentally.
Harry sat down at the Gryffindor table with Ron and Hermione, dazed and slightly shaken by Blaise's warning. He saw Malfoy stiffen over at the Slytherin table with the realisation that Harry wasn't joining him - was he hurt? Or just irritated?
And there, in the haven provided by the shade, he allowed himself to fully burst into tears.
And it was over, and a million tiny fragments of infinity scattered over their bodies as the boys threw themselves back on the sheets, illuminating their skin in colours that didn't have names, and sewing together the gaping wounds they'd made in each other's souls for the past few years.
he thought,
Harry's mouth fell fully open. He couldn't believe how casual the other boy was being. "What is actually wrong with you?" he asked, deadpan. "I can't tell how much of what you're saying is a joke right now."
Harry let out a small gasp as the other boy leaned in and kissed him passionately on the mouth in front of the entire Common Room, who watched on, appalled.
"While we're on the subject of my client's addiction, Your Honour," said Mallory, "I believe we have a spokesperson for the laboratories I mentioned earlier on, to offer more evidence. The defence would like to present Dr. Wolfson from the LCT Laboratory in London."
Harry found himself blinking to get rid of those same stars in his eyes which were always there when he saw Malfoy so vulnerable, no matter how many times he looked.
"No, I'm using it," she told him petulantly, but there was an odd look of worry in her eyes which piqued Draco's interest greatly, so without any further thought he ripped it out of her hands and flicked roughly though the pages to that day's topic.
This didn't calm Harry's nerves at all. "I think I'd take the Basilisk right now," he said, loosening his tie with shaky hands and stuffing the card into his robe pocket as though that would get rid of his anxiety too. "God, is it really hot in here?"
"Dr. Wolfung has confirmed there was enough ecstasy evident in Draco's bloodstream at the time of marking to knock out an average man. If you think that he could have been under the influence of that much ecstasy and still able to consent to the Marking, let alone rationally request it, you are mistaken in the eyes of the law."
"Shall we go and find somewhere to sleep?" Harry whispered into Draco's hair, and felt the other boy nod against him. There was a long and cold night ahead of them if they didn't move.
The Slytherin Common Room had never looked so good as it did on the last Friday of Hogwarts' term in 1996.
"Look, Malfoy, you might think this whole thing is terribly funny, but you should know I'm different to whoever else you've been with before, ok?" Harry interrupted Malfoy's laughter angrily. "So next time you do ... that... to me - if there is a next time - you'd better fucking mean it."
He looked at Harry then, really looked at him. Took in the greenness of his eyes and the hollows underneath them, the way his eyelashes clung together slightly under the dark sweep of his eyebrows, and the dark blush of exertion on his cheekbones. The innocence in the curve of his mouth that just screamed to be kissed, and the way his dark hair always stuck up no matter what he did.
He was slightly concerned, however, about the fact that Malfoy hadn't been to hospital the night before. What if permanent damage had been done? It would be all Harry's fault for not taking him to Pomfrey. He hoped Malfoy would lie to his friends and just pretend he got discharged early, rather than admit the truth - that he'd slept in Harry's arms crying all night.
No, it was impossible. How could he explain that specific feeling?
But the other boy, for once, didn't seem to be fully mocking him. His expression certainly wasn't sympathetic, but it was less cruel than usual, and this gave Harry the courage to continue.
he realised with an odd hot rush, and then rolled his eyes at himself.
Malfoy didn't even bother to protest this time. "I can get more," he croaked, and Harry hated him for that.
"Objection; Your Honour, are we to understand that it was Mr. Malfoy's expulsion from school which lead to his addiction being recognised?" interjected the prosecution barrister. He was rather fish-like in appearance and had a needling voice, and Harry had taken an instant dislike to him upon meeting him.
"I am that person," Harry whispered. "And you know what I think, don't you?"
"No. You... satisfy me more fully than I'm used to." Malfoy said. "And now, if you don't stop me," his voice became lower, a barely audible growl over the music, "I am going to kiss you."
Harry decided it was sensible to wake up before Malfoy that morning (who had finally drifted off to sleep sometime around 6:30am) and intended to creep back to the Gryffindor dorms before he could be subjected to Draco's comedown temper.
Harry didn't reply, too busy trying to steady his beating heart. Surely it must be loud enough for Malfoy to hear the impression he was making on him?
The boys didn't talk to each other for the next week, a torturous length of time to both of them in different ways, but as usual it was Harry who suffered the most.
, he mentally begged his love.
"My parents are booking me into a very expensive rehabilitation facility," he continued airily. He had to keep talking, keep moving, distract himself from Harry's crumpling face. "They say I'm a colossal embarrassment, which I suppose is true."
"Do you.. want to?" Draco asked awkwardly. He hated talking about feelings.
he decided instead.
He thought about sleeping with someone else, anyone else, but it somehow didn't sit right in his mind. He hadn't been lying when he told Potter no one else satisfied him the same.
This was the final straw for Harry, who glowered at them both before stomping off, muttering about disrespect.
"I suppose you've come to tell me the news," Ginny said sulkily the second Harry's head appeared in the doorway of the Common Room.
"You do, actually," Harry muttered, then flinched instinctively as he caught the other boy's eye. "Sorry. I'm sorry, OK??"
to Hex you into next week," Blaise warned him, and Draco knew he meant it.
"Up for a game, Malfoy?" Potter's voice in Draco's ear made him jump suddenly, and he wheeled round to face him. He tugged his scarlet Gryffindor sweater over his head as he spoke, and mounted his broom, swooping up to hover next to the blonde boy in mid-air. Draco grinned.
Harry couldn't think of anything more stupid.
"Cat got your tongue, Malfoy?" Potter pressed. "You gone all shy?"
"I've got him from here, guys," he sighed once the group were through the doors. "Thanks for the help, Theo-"
"He did. I saw it." A little voice piped up from the back of the courtroom. Ginny Weasley was on her feet, as pale as Harry had ever seen her, but with a fire blazing in her eyes. "I saw him throw it."
"My bed it is, then," Malfoy grinned.
Malfoy's eyes widened. "I told you to give me time to think about that!" he protested. "Not just spring it on me!"
with me, for Christ's sake," he complained to Pansy after a particularly brutal rejection. "I don't know why he's acting like he isn't. I mean, he's hardly noticed me all day - and I made sure my shirt rode up when I took my jumper off in Divination and everything!"
"Next time he might mean it," he insisted, and that was enough to chip a sore little piece off Hermione's heart.
"I still might murder you, you know," he said reproachfully as they walked, "I don't think you realise what you've done. I fucking told Blaise you were doing great and he warned me this would happen, I didn't listen but he still warned me you'd ruin everything like you always bloody do-"
"How are you going to make sure of that?" Harry asked, sliding his tongue slowly across his teeth and making sure Malfoy saw. He didn't know where this sudden confidence had come from, but it was gradually becoming ecstatic.
laughed the James in Harry's mind, though he wasn't sure what made him think that.
"Why don't you ask Zabini or Nott to take you back to bed when you take it too far?"
"I should," he agreed. He squinted at Harry out of the corner of his eye, and smiled to himself again.  "Do you want me to take it again?" he asked.
He ran a hand through his immaculate hair - it had taken him 45 precious minutes that morning, and Potter had barely even looked at it.
"What the fuck is this?!" Draco snapped in outrage, not caring when Snape's beady glare drifted over towards the table. The professor wasn't above punishing even his favourite student, but Draco was too wound up to even notice him.
"We aren't even leaving the castle," Harry replied. "I'd say you're more than great as you are."
"Better make it worth my while."
So instead, "Potter, it's happened again," one of the Slytherins would whisper, shaking Harry's shoulder in the dark to wake him up.
Mallory nodded tiredly. "Yes, my client was expelled from school," he responded.
He grinned brazenly. "Oh, I know. It's a fine art of mine."
"If Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater," he continued, "The question also remains as to why he would sabotage his own side in throwing Mr. Potter his wand at the end of the battle."
"Subtle," she winked, scribbling it down eagerly.
"No, I'm OK, Dad," he whispered back to the imaginary voice, a small smile spreading across his face. "I can handle it for myself."
Thinking of Ron, his cheeks flared, but nevertheless Harry steeled himself, then got on his knees on the hard wood floorboards and pressed his face into the pillow to inhale deeply.
"And I think you're forgetting I've got five older brothers, two of which are Fred and George bloody Weasley," Ron replied airily. "I know how to fight, Harry. I broke George's wrist when I was about ten."
"Well, as a matter of fact, you are distracting me," Malfoy snapped. "I deeply resent the fact that you came here to perv on me, it is a violation of my human rights-"
"If there's a next time, you have to mean it," - the words Harry had spoken so forcefully drifted round his head, but he lost all conviction in them the second the other boy so much as looked at him.
Harry groaned. "It's true that I smelt what you think I smelt in my Amortentia, yes. But let me assure you, Ginny, that as far as I am aware, I still feel nothing but hatred for that boy. I'm bloody straight! I think."
It still hurt, of course it did.
Draco shifted in his seat and he helped himself to a green apple from the dish in the centre of the table, anything to occupy his hands. He was at a total loss of what to do; completely out of his depth.
He shifted Malfoy's body to a standing position, though he kept his arms firmly supporting the other boy. Draco's arms clutched round Harry's neck like his life depended on him, which perhaps it did.
The idea stroked his ego enormously. Potter. Perfect, insufferable Potter. Vulnerable to Draco's charms.
Harry pulled back from the fabric as quickly as if he'd been scorched, and groaned again, loudly. Fucking hell.
Not that Malfoy had said much on the subject, of course. Once he was finished he simply cleaned up, pulled his Quidditch kit back on and headed out of the door, saying he was going to sleep, and Harry didn't know why he was disappointed over this.
Malfoy accepted it with a grateful nod. "Very good of you, Hokey," he said, and if House Elves could blush, Harry knew Hokey would've done.
"Shut it, Ron!"
"Harry, ignore him," Hermione said urgently, placing a restraining hand on Harry's arm and pulling him back behind a desk as though she sensed his rocketing pulse. Anything to create some distance.
"Fine, I'll tell you then. The little shit-"
"I'm f-fine," Harry insisted through chattering teeth. "Honestly."
Harry felt violently sick. "That was a horrendous thing to say and I hope you fucking regret it one day," he managed, valiantly fighting the urge to just lash out and cause some actual damage. "I hope you die, I really do. You're an evil piece of shit, Draco Malfoy."
Malfoy shrugged. "You could always keep your feelings to yourself," he suggested, hopping out of Harry's bed to pull his robes on. The two of them had hardly slept apart all term.
Author's notes: -
"Shut up, Potter," Draco groaned, hitting Harry on the arm. "I may be a shirt-lifting emotional wreck but the whole castle doesn't need to know that, yeah?"
Harry held up a pair of cute little snake patterned socks, and laughed to himself. If he'd known for the last few weeks that Malfoy wore these, maybe he wouldn't have taken him so seriously.
Malfoy put his rings on for the second slap, and Harry felt like he deserved that when it came.
He knew he was being cruel, and relished it. Cruelty always made him feel better about his own hard emotions; it was sometimes the only thing he knew.
Just then, Malfoy's alarm spurted out of his wand on the bedside table, blaring red and loud, and Harry realised it must have been set for the Slytherin Quidditch practice. He froze, unable to react quickly enough to hide the book, horrified in the knowledge that he was about to be caught in the act.
The wildflowers were delicate and softly colourful, bluebells and violets and snowdrops, and the pages in front of the boys were filled with lines and lines of ink on the Wolfsbane potion, the
It didn't help that Malfoy was continuously attempting to confuse them.
The next morning, a clear March Sunday, marked two weeks since Draco had last been high, and he woke up with a feeling of confusion and fatigue, but also a little bit of pride.
"Wait, Draco, I’ll help with that. I was just joking about you paying for everything,” Harry said, coming over in a hurry and nearly tripping on the rug in his haste.
"We'll see," Malfoy replied, but Harry could tell he wasn't entirely serious. He stepped off the ice and onto the bank, much to Harry's relief, but when their hands brushed Harry could tell that the boy was freezing cold.
He turns back, and they collide, those fragile boys who look too much like their Mothers and act too much like their Fathers.
Malfoy surprisingly didn't resist at any point, though pain flashed through his eyes as Harry gripped harder. Pain was evident in his mouth too, in the corner where his teeth bit into his lip.
He thought about what would happen next. Would he and Malfoy really be able to act like uncomplicated enemies again after all this weirdness?
And he looked... brighter, perhaps? More alive? No, he looked radiant.
Christ, Malfoy looked even more of a wreck than Harry felt, dark shadows stark against his pale skin, grey eyes fixed on his untouched plate. He'd turned around as Harry walked into the room, then dropped his gaze quickly and spun back round as though the green eyes were burning his own silver ones.
Malfoy had called him Harry again after that - he normally only ever did that when they were fucking, so this was a novelty.
Harry tugged his Quidditch robes around himself tighter to shield out the rough January wind. It was hard to believe that the ice in the air didn't come from Malfoy at times, he was so emotionally glacial. But he'd nearly confided in Harry, nearly slipped up - about his parents?
"Oh, I heard enough. Your Amortentia smell is Dior Sauvage and green apple. Really subtle, Harry. Bloody original."
Draco's happiness was interrupted about ten minutes later by the arrival of an owl, with a letter in its beak with his name on it in an ugly black scrawl, smudging in the rain that had just started to fall. The hand seemed familiar, maybe it was someone from home writing on Father's behalf, saying he could come home? He tore the envelope open hastily, but the letter inside was nothing to do with his Father.
And it smelled - no,
He'd come home. He was better. And it was enough.
He had a point.
It was cold outside and Harry was shivering, even with the layers of clothing he hadn't bothered to remove so much as just pull out of the way for Malfoy. He wrapped his arms around his body in a weird sort of embrace to keep himself warm. There'd be no chance of Malfoy doing something like this for me, he thought resentfully, squeezing tighter for comfort.
"I'll just get my robes then come up to my own bed," he told himself, making the turn down the stairs before they swung out behind him, though he knew he had no interest in the robes above a slight sentimental value.
Harry was shaking, literally shaking, with the shock. For a second, he tried to convince himself that he'd misinterpreted the scent, but no, it was unmistakeable.
He knew Neville didn't mean any harm, but nevertheless Harry was getting really sick of the judgement from the other Gryffindors which he'd been subjected to since the rumour about him and Malfoy had spread. Abuse and mocking from Slytherins was fine, he'd expected that. But Harry had even experienced cold shoulders from Hufflepuffs over this incident as well as from people he considered his friends, and that really stung.
He glanced up at the clock. It was getting late; looked like Lily was going to be picked up from Ron and Hermione's way after her bedtime for the third time this week. Eventually, Malfoy nodded and clapped his hands again.
Later that day, Draco's world began to fall apart.
"Thanks, Ronald."
He slid down onto his knees in the grass and forced himself to think of Malfoy in that way, in a sexual way. To think of him stripped, think about running his own hands all over that toned bare skin, his muscled Seeker figure, reaching right up and kissing him on that cruel red mouth.
There was one from Ginny a couple of days after Christmas, a long apology that he half read before tossing it on the fire, though it hurt him not to read the words that she wrote. God knew he'd done vile things for love too.
"I didn't know you did this," he whispered, and Draco shrugged.
, before opening the dormitory door to make the sound subside.
"I'm not joking about any of it," Malfoy replied, nose crinkled in confusion. "What would I gain by joking?"
"Closer."
"Such high standards," Malfoy's tone dripped with sarcasm.
"You are absolutely bloody savage," He shuddered. "I can't believe the wizarding world is genuinely looking to you to defeat the Dark Lord; you can barely use a fucking fork for crying out loud."
"Draco was a seventeen-year-old schoolboy plagued by his Death Eater parents all year to accept the Dark Mark," Harry continued. "He has been manipulated, gaslit, and emotionally and verbally abused by his parents for as long as I've known him and even earlier. I think you have to consider the reality of how hard Draco's life really is, that he gained a drug addiction at such a young age as a means of coping."
"I did care, actually," Malfoy mumbled. "I waited outside for you to come out so I could, um..."
Harry felt his entire body tense up. God, yes, he wanted this. He nodded again, sighing shakily against Malfoy's mouth as the other boy's hips began to grind gently into his, keeping Harry close with a rough hand.
Blood dripped all over the table and Malfoy leapt to his feet, making no attempt to stem the crimson flood. It poured menacingly over his pale, sharp features, looking as though a wide gash had been sliced through his entire face.
Harry frowned, confused. "This is a bad thing? I just told you, he's happy."
Surprisingly, it didn't seem to tempt the Slytherin the way he'd expected.
The kiss the following morning was one Harry dwelt on less, however. It had been a confusing hot rush as always, but the emotions on Draco's face at the time had almost embarrassed Harry in their sheer intimacy and vulnerability, like it was something extremely private that Harry had walked in on by mistake. He felt like it was Draco's deranged attempt at an apology, which was so sad it was almost funny.
Then Malfoy bent his head down and kissed Harry hard, the way he used to, before the party, almost lashing him with the desperation of his tongue and the neediness of his lips. Harry felt a little of his soul tug away at the sensation -
"Fine, maybe a bit. But only because he doesn't leave me alone! Nobody irritates the life out of me the way he does. God, I want to slap his smug face so badly every time I look at him."
A pause.
The blood was roaring through his body, his lungs were heaving in the fresh air, Potter was beside him laughing that gorgeous wide open-mouthed laugh of his, and Draco had never felt more alive. He couldn't believe the luxury of having two good days.
"I take it you'd never done molly before tonight?" Draco had asked him before they slept, and Harry had shaken his head.
"You are literally putting me off my food, you realise that," Draco informed his date. The other boy's eyes lit up.
"Listen, Potter. I don't want you to do it and that's that," Draco responded with a dark glare, and for a while, that
The Slytherins thought it was beyond hilarious that Harry had lost his place on the Quidditch team over the incident with Malfoy, and took great pleasure in spraying large amounts of Dior Sauvage around, or eating crunchy green apples in front of Harry, and sneering "Potter" at him to get a reaction.
He became aware of a few weird stares as he walked down the corridors, weirder than normal, that was. So Ginny was right. Everyone did know already.
His index finger began to trace deft patterns into the inside of Harry's thigh - was he spelling something?
"And now it's time for the show," Blaise whispered eagerly as she took her place beside him once more, his eyes never leaving the dark-haired Gryffindor two rows away from them.
It had started that day, as most things tended to, in a fight between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.
Harry barged his hip against Draco's, throwing him off the path slightly. The blonde boy laughed and did the same back, harder, and they both tripped and fell into a little snow mound on the side of the path.
"He's not that bad," Harry shook his head. "And I'm not exactly a good person myself."
As Harry dressed to go back to the Burrow, Draco asked if he'd stay the night, and Harry looked at him, considering.
"I swear to God, Malfoy, if you ever touch me like that again, I will fucking curse you," he breathed. Draco saw his expression and didn't doubt for a second that he meant it. There was nothing he could say to that, so the blonde boy just spun round on his heel and stalked off in the direction of the third-floor boy's bathroom, while Harry headed for his dorm.
Draco wondered for a second if he should ask for it back, but decided he didn't care.
, you ferret??" he exploded, and for a second Draco was almost afraid.
"Study together?" Malfoy repeated incredulously, though he accepted the breakfast offering with haste. "That's what you want to do??"
? There was no good option for him, and they both knew it.
not going to like it," Draco sighed, glancing pointedly at Ron.
"I really don't think you can," he replied smugly. "I've decided to enjoy you in all your evil glory. Remember how you got that pretty bruise, baby?"
"Are you actually fucking delirious?" Pansy demanded. "Potter, give him your robe, he's going to get hypothermia."
As Madam Pince shrieked and squealed and other students watched on in disgusted awe, Draco began to dance on the wreckage he'd created, trampling the vase-soaked books and carnations with shoes that probably cost more than all the damaged works underneath them, and he laughed joyfully.
The blonde was conveniently on his way out of the dorms when the pair arrived, and Hermione happily cornered him, wand already out.
The Slytherin downed his glass of pumpkin juice, moodily picking at the food on his plate. Having to stay at school would really suck, seeing Potter all the time wandering round with his stupid glasses and his stupid sex hair and his stupid pretty green eyes and that stupid cool scar... ugh, shut uP, Draco.
"Stir anti-clockwise, Longbottom," he piped up over the tables, a spiteful smirk on his face. "And use less of that crushed unicorn horn if you know what's good for you."
"Do I think I'm too good for someone who won't so much as bid me goodbye when I won't see him for a fortnight?" Harry asked. "Er, yeah, just a bit."
But his mind won over his body in the end, and he resisted the other boy.
"And yet you
"Ah. Shit, hang on."
"So it's begun," Harry whispered, and a small proud smile spread over his face. "He's really doing it."
Malfoy spat out a loud lungful of water onto the flagstones and retched, stopped in his tracks for a second. "Do you think it doesn't hurt me too?" he asked nastily when he could speak again.
"Take your trousers off," Harry whispered softly, "Or do you need me to do it for you? The cuts aren't bad but they still need cleaning up or they'll get infected."
No, there was only one option, and testing the Amortentia wasn't it.
"You shut your mouth, Potter, or I'll fuck that vile little ex-girlfriend of yours," Draco hissed, and he moved closer to force Harry to look up at him. "I'd have to do her from behind with the lights off, but I reckon I could do it if it would hurt you at all."
"No reason."
"Shut the fuck up," Harry said, and with difficulty he forced his arms under Malfoy's body to haul him up to his chest. Theo supported him most of the way up, taking a good third of the burden, and despite the blonde's scratchy-voiced protests, the crowd began their odd procession up to the hospital wing.
"He's kept his distance... for now," he smirked. "Probably knows I'd knock him out if he tried anything. Besides, he was too busy embarrassing himself on his broom today, in case any of you noticed."
April the 12th was Draco Malfoy's last day as a Hogwarts student.
Madam Pince yelped and kept back to avoid the explosion of glass, but Draco was oblivious, already onto the next breakable thing.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Fine. You have until sundown to do whatever you want. But I can't promise I'll like it."
"I want my art stuff," Malfoy announced after a second, staring at Harry with a strange expression. "I don't want to talk about what you've seen in the book, but I - I can't just not draw you, the way you look right now."
Draco smiled. "Dragon's head, I should've remembered," he nodded thoughtfully. "If I'd been listening when you said that yesterday, I might not have been sat outside there for four hours this morning."
"Don't even look back," Draco's voice was stern and commanding in his ear, "We have to keep moving."
He didn't stay, but he couldn't get the image of Malfoy out of his mind as he ate, and was so distracted that he may as well have not been there.
"I don't know," Draco replied honestly, and he seemed very small as he admitted that. "Something bad though, I think."
Harry's newfound confidence was nothing short of life-changing.
he thought
He looked ethereally beautiful, which was the first thing Harry noticed. He was dressed in a fitted black suit, the shirt of which was coming carelessly untucked, and the sleeves were rolled once.
"Tested it?" Mallory leaned forward in his own chair, clearly intrigued.
"What the fuck are you doing here, Potter?" Malfoy hissed, ignoring Flint's heckles for him to come back.
"You’re not planning on bringing about my financial ruin today, are you Potter?”
Harry didn't care to examine the face of this 'other' too closely, too scared that he'd find his own features.
"And for the record," Malfoy continued, "that's not why your precious Potter's not here. This happened after he left, I didn't even hear him go, and you just jumped to your own conclusions."
He thought Ron and Hermione might go through the literal roof that evening when he told them what had happened, displaying the creased-up parchment as evidence.
"Potter."
"Don't say shit like that, you little virgin, or I'll leave," he threatened, and that was enough to make Harry really be quiet. "Do I make myself clear?"
Malfoy didn't take long to join Harry in the meadow spot by the Lake.
"Alohamora. Harry, can I come in? I won't look, promise."
"My virginity!" Harry laughed. "Wouldn't have thought you'd be precious about things like that, Malfoy?"
Minutes passed and plates cleared, however, and by the time the Hall was all but emptied, a collective gasp arose from the green side of the room, and Harry's head snapped to follow the source of the surprise.
Despite this, Harry had been hoping to catch the other boy that morning to give him the gift he'd found in Hogsmeade the day before, but he was nowhere to be found.
"All right then, dyke, we'd better go back to the castle and get you warmed up," Draco sighed, pressing the back of his hand against Harry's icy cheek. "You're bloody freezing, here, take this."
Her desk was bathed in the flickering yellow wash of a candle, it was still far too early in the morning to be naturally light, and there were several open books in front of her which she was referring to with intense focus.
he thought grimly.
Bored, Malfoy surveyed the room with a disparaging look, then wandered over to the drinks table. He selected a full bottle of Firewhiskey, cracked it open and swigged insolently right from the neck, daring someone to protest.
"Master Malfoy, Hokey has supplied you with the new Potions book which you requested of Hokey," the elf reported shyly, and pulled the textbook in question out from behind its back with a flourish.
He liked the thought that they had a usual place, even though they'd only been there once together. Still, it was a place only the two of them knew, a place where only the two of them existed. Their usual place.
A rush of something untouchably precious rolled through him in that realisation, and he recognised it immediately for what it was. It couldn't be anything but love.
"Did you literally just say you're going to break into his dorm and sniff his sheets while he's playing Quidditch?" Hermione wheezed, wiping a tear from one eye before descending into uncontrollable giggles again. "And there's still a doubt in your mind as to whether you fancy him?"
"No, but you love it just the same, don't you?" he asked, leaning over and smacking his other hand flat against the wall just above Malfoy's blonde head, so that he was effectively imprisoned by Harry's body. Harry looked down with a smug and nasty grin.
A week without him. Only a week more. Why was it killing him so much to be alone?
"You'd like that, wouldn't you?" Harry replied absent-mindedly as he stirred the mixture in his cauldron. It was a nonsensical phrase that he'd picked up from George Weasley and now used as a reflex response for anything Malfoy said, regardless of the implications.
When he was finished, Harry placed a feather-light kiss over the freshly healed skin, slid into bed beside Malfoy, and breathed a tired sigh of relief. The quietness didn't last long, however, because Malfoy rolled over almost immediately to drape a leg over Harry's hips, pressing his mouth up to his ear to whisper all the things he'd like to do to him.
"Whatever you say, Draco, dearest," nodded Pansy, but he was already stomping out of the Common Room. He let the portrait bang hard behind him.
"Don't ever say I'm not fucking loyal," Draco hissed.
"Harry!" she said, shutting the pages with a surprised snap as her friend dropped down next to her. "What are you doing up so early?"
"Have you had to fight him off?"
“Heard he's a bloody shirt-lifter though," Harry smirked. "I mean, I always had my suspicions. A boy can’t be pretty like that and not be a fag. I mean, really. I bet he spends more time in front of the mirror than you do.”
"They don't," Draco shook his head gently. "They have each other and I need you more. But either way, you know we can't go back to Hogwarts. My Mark still hurts, which isn't a good sign."
, Malfoy had written under a particularly stirring image of Harry's bare skin. He'd sketched a lazily-thrown emerald sheet across his hips and most of his torso, but it was still unmistakably him.
"I don't know what you want me to do. I sent Ginny up to check if he's in the Slytherin dorms, about five minutes ago. Just chill till then," he told her, but he might as well have told the sun not to shine.
"Keep your mouth fucking shut, Draco," his father barked, digging his fingers as hard as he could into Draco's left forearm. "Don't mortify us."
"That's almost as good as how I did it in Third Year," she noted under her breath. "Good work, Ronald."
Though Draco realised, thinking back, that it might have been the first time they'd gone to bed together when they'd both been sober, and not purely aiming to have sex. He'd slept well at least, so that was one good thing. He wondered if Potter had plans for the day - the boy could be surprisingly good company even when Draco was sober. Not that he'd admit that.
Draco glowered. He did remember it and found he didn't appreciate the reminder.
"But I'm still nothing to you?"
Draco grinned. "Wow, you have standards? This is new."
"Why not?" Malfoy frowned. "I just wanted one. Got into more of a habit over the holidays, I'll admit."
Harry hated him for that more than anything else.
But Potter didn't rise, which was beyond infuriating. Who did he think he was? He'd had two whole weeks to get over the incident with Weasel, and though Draco wasn't denying it was traumatic (
"And for the record, I don't fancy you. I don't know what happened in that class and I don't know what you heard, but whatever it was, it wasn't what it sounded like."
"What's in that fucking bottle, Malfoy?" He repeated, punctuating his question with a loud crash of the object against the table and making the cutlery rattle.
He tightened his grip on Harry's shoulders and groaned in pain again. "Every time I open my eyes, Potter, I see my father. I see your fucking dead body, I see my mother screaming, and I see my arm out in front of me with a fucking skull-headed snake writhing on it."
It was just as the dream vision of Draco opened his mouth and spat down on Harry's face that Harry realised he was waking up in real life, and coming hard on his chest and stomach as he did so.
"What the fuck are you two playing at?" Draco demanded, rubbing his hands over his head as if to purify himself from Blaise's touch.
But the boundaries between what Draco wanted and what he didn't were becoming increasingly harder to tell apart.
"Perfect Potter. Is there anything you can't do?" Malfoy goaded him. "Oh, yeah!" A vile grin spread across his face. "You can't let me fuck you without crying that you fucking
"So you've thought about it, then?" Harry responded.
The other boy blushed darkly at the sight. "That doesn't... I don't know what that means," he insisted.
- it was eerie to read Harry's own thoughts down on paper in his lover's words.
So Harry fought every nerve in his body that screamed at him to save everyone else, and for once he just lived for himself.
Blaise scanned the sheet again, reading quietly as he did so. "Dior Sauvage cologne.... green apple .... cherrywood broom polish .... fresh linen .... spearmint.... hair gel .... Nope, I think you've got it! Although, let me just -"
"What do you - is everything alright?" Harry asked, rubbing his eyes.
Malfoy laughed, and cast a surprisingly decent Glamour over his eyes to make the pupils look normal.
"Detention for the rest of the year!" Madam Pince called shrilly, but Malfoy didn't even hear her.
Harry, meanwhile, was in the throes of a particularly vivid dream in Ginny's bed, the likes of which he'd never had before.
"He's so sexy and talented and he's got the biggest dick in the world and I can't sit down this week-"
Like every time Draco's lips touched Harry's he sucked away a little more life, a little more spirit and resolve, and in its place was coldness and heartache and spite.
Malfoy paled. "Don't fucking watch me, Potter," he snapped, before wheeling round and heading reluctantly down to his captain for an angry lecture.
On May the 2nd, 1998, Draco awoke to the feeling of his Mark burning even more than usual. He felt as though a magnet inside of it was pulling him frantically towards something he couldn't recognise, and evidently his parents felt the same because they were up before the sun.
He balled his fists and then forced his entire body to physically relax, an attempt to regulate his breathing.
Instead of answering, Harry pulled Malfoy's face down to his again and received the same almost violent kiss as before which made him feel as though his knees were going weak underneath him.
Malfoy wanted Harry again and again and over again, seemingly never bored: in class, in the bathroom, on the pitch, by the lake, in his sleep, he wanted Harry everywhere at all times of the day, and Harry wanted him back more than he wanted to breathe.
"You can start using actual colour now," Harry said quietly as Malfoy turned the gift over in delicate hands. "They're enchanted to change to read you and fit your mood - thought it might save me from being a venting board for your frustrations a little more in the future."
"Just let me have a little more," Malfoy hissed, reaching for the bottle. He was shaking so hard and looked so fragile and pale. "Just a bit and I'll stop."
"Be back in fifteen minutes."
Sometimes Harry felt sad about the years Ginny had missed out on with their daughter, but he had always refused to let himself miss her.
Harry skidded down on the hard earth beside the boy he loved and knelt by Blaise, adding his own hands to the pressure on Malfoy's chest.
"My favourite." Draco nodded stiffly. Why was Potter being nice to him? This was uncomfortable.
"Ow, Malfoy, you're hurting me," Potter whined, and Draco laughed hollowly.
Malfoy held back a cutting comment, remembering the promise he'd made to be nice. "Thank you, Potter," he said stiffly, the words foreign and sharp in his mouth. "I ... I like them very much."
The Gryffindor part of Harry protested feebly, but the rest of him really didn't mind wearing Draco's jacket, it was warm and soft and cosy. Best of all, the material smelt like Draco, smoky and masculine, and Harry inhaled deeply, trying to be surreptitious about it.
And if he wasn't at the new place he'd been renting then that meant he'd found somewhere else - London, perhaps? Draco always loved the anonymity of a big city. Maybe he'd found an apartment in Camden where he could do his art, and wander up Primrose Hill in the evening to watch the sunset when the light was soft.
He could practically see Malfoy's internal debate -
"I'd rather get your opinion first," Harry replied. "Draco can be... a little touchy on this subject."
"You don't," Harry cried. "You make everything better, you make my life worth living. I wish I hadn't said what I said-"
Harry had never run so fast in his life as he did down those stairs and out of the castle, not caring how far behind him Pansy was as long as he could get to the Lake. He knew the way, and he knew what he'd find.
"I didn't know-"
She shrugged. "You seem prone to drama."
Malfoy understood exactly what Harry meant when he pulled him aside after the Slytherin practice that night, though he pretended not to.
Both were trying to smother hysterical laughter, which annoyed Draco. This was far more fascinating than it was funny, for now. Maybe he'd laugh about it later, but for now his brain was busy calculating how to use this against Potter in the most hurtful way.
"Harry's going to take this even less well if he doesn't already know," Hermione warned him as Ron dry-retched against the wall.
"Depends what you write!"
Harry shook his head. "No, he seems genuinely good right now and he's been like this for a while - I was with him all day yesterday, he said we had a good day-"
Harry sighed, and ran his hands through his hair. "She's not like any normal mothers though, Mrs. Weasley. Narcissa's the one who allowed him to get hooked in the first place. And besides, I think it's a Malfoy pride thing. Draco obviously doesn't want me to mention it either."
Potter had led him to a spot by the Lake, a beautiful little hidden patch of meadow that Draco hadn't known previously existed, and set out ink, Quills, textbooks and parchment for each of them.
"I actually don't care," Draco shook his head. "I really don't. You can think what you like, but we aren't going to carry on like this. As far as I'm concerned, I hate you, and you hate me. And that's the way I like it."
He pictured Malfoy's body against his own, behind his own, his long ringed fingers tangled through Harry's dark hair, his hot breath in his ear breathing out "Good boy" as he bent him over the bed...
The collective gasp in the room wasn't stifled quickly enough by the jury and the onlookers, and Harry felt a brief flash of embarrassment before it died down as quickly as it came.
Harry rolled his eyes, picturing Malfoy's antics skidding around on the ice.
He pressed a hand to his own stomach; he could feel his pulse there but willed it to slow.
Harry rolled his eyes. "What I'm really saying, Malfoy, is can you stop choosing me now? I'd rather not have any of you than have this."
"If he's cruel to you, Harry, let it spur you on to do better than him," Hermione added, and Harry nodded.
"Fuck!" Harry swore, scuffing his foot into the ground. "They wouldn't even Owl you a report?"
"Oh, I'm watching," Malfoy assured him, sending a delicious shiver down Harry's spine.
It became clear that the end was nearing.
Yet perched on the bed in the light of Harry's wand, his eyes dilated and that dreamy look on his face, Malfoy seemed small, breakable. Not capable of the violence he'd exhibited in his life.
Draco's bed on the far side was immaculately made as ever, but Harry was surprised to find that his own robes weren't where he'd left them after all.
He smiled sweetly. "Sure I do. But can we please continue this conversation after I've had some food, I'm dying?"
Before Draco could protest, Granger thrust the bundle of very
"- All the times you've publicly humiliated me, or the times you've physically pushed me around - or how about last night, when you assaulted me and then humiliated me like it was my fault? Or how about when you..."
he'd written back, trying not to sound too curt.
"Try," Harry insisted in a whisper. "For me?"
"Thanks," Harry nodded awkwardly, and then wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. So this was where the serpents slept.
, Potter?!" Nott yelled. "I thought you wanted to help him, not fucking
His train of thought was broken as he was hit in the stomach with a Flipendo (a Knock-back Jinx), the force of which sent him sprawling backwards on the flagstones and his wand clattering away under hundreds of feet.
But she wasn't listening and would soon be out of sight, so he decided to leave her to it.
Blaise thought, then shook his head. "It's made all the more hilarious by Draco's gloating, I wouldn't want to take that away from him."
But he thought that this questioning was because of boys like Cedric Diggory, or Oliver Wood, or even the Weasley twins at a push, in an illicitly sexy 'friend's-older-brother' kind of way.
he chastised himself mentally, though that knowledge strangely didn't help.
"Excuse you, I have great taste in boys!" Draco protested. "Not as good as yours, I'll grant you- ow, ow, don't push me, we'll end up on the floor again you silly git!"
He allowed himself to feel a ripple of excitement at the prospect. Did Malfoy realise that Harry would view whatever they did as a date?
Before he could get there, however, Draco's fingers skimmed over the page titled 'Amortentia', and a sheet of parchment in Pansy's writing drifted onto his lap.
With every insult the urge to expose their little secret grew stronger - "I made you weak, Malfoy," he imagined himself saying. "You think you're so invincible, but I've watched you orgasm over me and you didn't look so powerful then. Your cum face makes you look like you're crying."
Theo's wand was out now, and he was aiming spell after spell at the centre of Malfoy's chest to shock him awake, and Blaise was bent over his body, his hands pressed over the boy's heart. He pushed down hard again and again and again, yelling "Come on, Draco, fucking come
"I've decided I've had enough now of you and your fucking ego, Malfoy," Harry lashed the words out angrily, enjoying the other boy's lack of resistance for once. "You've got this primal need to hurt me all the time and it's getting ridiculous. It's all you, you, you, constantly, isn't it? As if my brain didn't give me enough thoughts about you as it was to begin with. But now I know why you do it."
Why had he recognised the feeling so instantly, the second he saw the colours? Where had he seen them before?
"All we do is fuck and argue!" Malfoy protested. "You wanted to read about me wanking over you on New Year's Eve, did you? Or about me thinking how much of a prick you are? Or about me staying high for days on end to avoid the fact that my parents are - are-"
"You're still going to be high for training at this rate!" Harry exclaimed. "Isn't it an early session? Flint'll kill you!"
Belt undone, Harry moved onto the zip, which took a couple of tugs but soon it was down and Malfoy lifted his body obediently to allow Harry to slide the material down from his hips.
"I realise that now," Draco glowered down at her. "And it's extremely annoying. I liked being the most traumatised member of the group but now I'm questioning it, because Blaise was
"Will you mean it?" he whispered, and felt his heart wrench ever so slightly when he got the answer he expected. Of course not.
Pansy was almost scarlet with the effort of repressing her laughter now, and took a deep breath to steady her emotions. "Amortentia," she choked out, before collapsing into hysterics.
"Because I hate you," Draco lied instead, forcing himself to meet those clear green eyes. They flickered across his, reading him slowly, and he suddenly felt very exposed. A knowing little smile began to form at Harry's lips.
For once Draco let him speak, shivering hard in the downpour. He'd never felt so miserable.
"Yeah, well, I'm prettier than most boys," Draco said airily.
But he couldn't tear his eyes away.
But he closed the distance between their bodies, and placed a cold hand on the back of Harry's neck. He bent slightly and his other hand slid with purpose around to the back of Harry's leg, gripping it hard. "I'm just kissing you," he whispered. "Do you want me to?"
"What are you suggesting, Pans?" he asked with a confused smile.
To demonstrate, he leant down, knotting his fingers through Harry's soft dark hair and kissing him forcefully.
"No, I think you are," Malfoy replied, licking his lips with anticipation. He loved a drama.
He'd been right about what he told Hermione - although the two still publicly hated each other, Harry couldn't leave Malfoy alone if his life depended on it, and it was apparently getting worse.
"Daddy," Lily mumbled sleepily, her head lolling against Harry's neck and her little pink thumb slipping into her rosebud mouth.
Harry felt a hot rush run through him.
The next few days were a blur. No other Gryffindors Harry knew had chosen to stay over the holidays, and the other House tables were relatively empty too. He avoided the Hall at mealtimes for this reason, or if his hunger was unignorable then he'd just slip in, grab just enough to keep him going, and slip back out again.
? Did you want a kiss bye-bye? Want me to tell you how I'd
He followed Daphne's hurried steps down the winding staircases and corridors of the castle before slipping out of a side exit he hadn't known previously existed, which took them out right to the banks of the Black Lake.
"If I give it to him myself then at least I know what I'm up against," Harry replied.
Harry squinted up at him, his expression of unbridled fury evident even through the wall of rain. "It's never how it sounded, is it, Malfoy?" he asked cuttingly, though he made no effort to pretend he wasn't sobbing. "It's never your fault, never your decision."
"I can't believe how unfair you're being," Draco gasped. "I told you I didn't want anything off her, ok? Fuck, Potter, you know I only ever want to bang you now."
There was a serious pause, then Draco pushed back his chair and went over to look out of the long window nearest the boys.
"Thank you, Your Honour," Harry gulped, pleasantly surprised. "I was trying to say, should we not consider Draco's expulsion as the final event in a list of traumatic incidents that year?"
"What was that?" he asked curiously.
"So you should, you utter troll," he retorted. "Who the fuck lashes out like that just because they're angry?"
