Sighing resignedly, Draco leaned back against Harry as he made his way up to Gryffindor tower. “Guess all that Quidditch training is coming in handy now, Potter.”
The smirk vanished from Malfoy’s face. “Alright,” he said slowly. Harry noticed how tightly he gripped the table as he moved to stand up. The sudden motion threw Malfoy off balance and he tipped over against Harry, who reflexively caught him, arms tightening around his waist like the day before. Malfoy pushed back quicker than before though, tilting dangerously again. But when Harry put out an automatic hand to steady him, Malfoy batted it away, staring down his nose imperiously and making use of every bit of the extra three inches he had over Harry.
“But I’m fine. Malfoy’s fine. I’m fine with Malfoy,” Harry reiterated, placing a hand on his friend’s arm. “We’ve moved past everything in our history and are just living in the present.”
“I don’t think you did hear me,” Harry huffed impatiently, slamming his locker door shut, annoyed at his friend’s indifference. Here he was, trying to confide in his best friend about something that had been agonizing him for days, and Ron couldn’t even be bothered to look at him!
Harry shushed him, going slightly red as he looked around at the guests near them, hoping they hadn’t caught that last bit. Draco was now idly tracing lines along the back of Harry’s neck and Harry dragged him off to the side of the room before he could say anything else incriminating.
“Right, well.” He cleared his throat and held out his right hand. “Might be a good start to just get used to walking around hand in hand.”
“Merlin, Potter, it’s only a minute past quarter to three, you didn’t need to send a search party,” Malfoy drawled, looping his green and silver striped scarf elegantly around his neck.
“Mr. Malfoy, you is doing it wrong!” O’Leary scolded, yanking the mixing bowl away from Malfoy, who had flour streaked down his face and the front of his blue sweater vest.
Malfoy escorted him into the pub, and they found a small table in the back of the bustling dining room, in among groups of students in Hogwarts robes and smiling denizens of Hogsmeade proper itself.
Harry followed him, cautiously inching across the ice as he got his footing. A faint remainder of last night’s snowfall dusted the frozen surface of the lake and Malfoy’s skates scored lines behind him as he traversed the ice with a careless ease.
Draco snorted. “Right. Because it’s totally believable when someone uses an urgent homework excuse when they’re really just going to snog someone.”
The problem bothered him through all of his classes, nagging at the back of his mind every time he drifted away into thought. In the morning the Gryffindors shared Transfiguration with the Slytherins and Harry spent nearly the entire time veritably boring holes in the back of Malfoy’s blond head with his stare as he tried to think of what it might be.
Harry quietly sat down at the top of the stairs, leaning his head against the bannister as he listened to the gentle melody swirling through the air. He could now see Malfoy, sitting on the piano bench, eyes closed, hands glancing the keys gently. He played all four verses of the song, nodding slowly along with the bars, letting the final note hang in the air as he paused, hands motionless on the pale keys as he seemed to savour the memory of the song hanging in the air.
“What did you say, Potter?” The Slytherin repeated, stepping towards Harry, an indecipherable expression on his pale face.
Harry suppressed a groan and threaded his way through the desks to the door of the classroom. Glancing back, he saw that Hermione had come to a stop in the middle of the flow of exiting students, head bent over her book, and that Ron was standing awkwardly beside her, opening his mouth to say something and then closing it repeatedly. At this rate, it would be lucky if they made it for lunch at all.
“We never said that,” Harry argued, biting back another shiver, not wanting to see Malfoy’s smirk of satisfaction. “It was definitely quarter to two.”
Another day, Ron had gotten all the students together to play some Quidditch scrimmages in the snow. Even Hermione had joined in, refereeing from the ground with a rulebook in hand to consult when fouls got debated, which Malfoy made a point of doing anytime Harry so much as breathed in the wrong direction, a smug smirk perched on his face. Harry countered with ‘accidentally’ flying too close to Malfoy and nudging his broom just enough that it sent the Slytherin in the opposite direction of the Snitch. Eventually Hermione got so exasperated with them that she refused to call any fouls between the two of them.
“You work at a coffee stall, so surely you know what the order ‘one black coffee’ means? Obviously not. All I want is one plain coffee, with nothing in it at all, and some patience sent down from heaven so I can deal with your incompetence.” The edges of the man’s posh accent became dangerously crisp.
The air was immediately filled the scent of smoke and the sound of shouts, as the players rushed to claim pairs of cards, the paper exploding with a resounding ‘bang!’ every time they failed to enunciate properly or tap it within the amount of time. Harry stared at the cards with a steady determination, aching to beat Malfoy, who was leaning over the table so far that his eyebrows were nearly burnt off several times.
“Er, yes,” Draco said, taken aback by her sudden involvement in the conversation. “He was the one who supported the free-range laws, wasn’t he?”
“Sorry, darling, I promise I will be nice to your boyfriend’s friends,” she blew him what was obviously supposed to be a comforting kiss and skipped down the rest of the hallway, stopping in front of a portrait of a fat lady in pink.
Shuddering at the realization that he had been brought so low as to wish he were a Hufflepuff, Draco stubbornly fixated on the page again. The black print seemed to wobble, becoming unintelligible.
!” Draco hissed, falling into the chair beside her, for once forgoing his prim posture in favour of really communicating to Pansy how much of a problem this was.
Ron shrugged congenially. “It’s alright, Harry. We’ve all got a lot on our minds, although,” he flushed faintly under his freckles. “I’m actually sorta grateful for what you said.”
It was one of the hardest battles Harry had ever fought to keep from laughing outright as he watched Ron sputter like a boiling tea kettle.
Resigned to his fate, he knotted his scarf around his neck as Potter clattered down the stairs to the entrance way, making such a cheerful racket that Draco was certain that even the Slytherins down in the dungeon could hear him.
Suddenly, Harry’s focus was reluctantly dragged away from Draco’s impossibly soft lips when he heard cheers. Still clinging onto his boyfri- his fiance, Harry turned to see that every single guest at the benefit was watching them, clapping in celebration. A swarm of journalists and photographers were crowded around the edges of the circle, taking picture after picture and shouting out questions, presumably directed at them.
Christmas was fast approaching and with it, the end of Harry’s time at 9544 Magnolia with Malfoy. Only two days remained until the holiday and Harry was sitting at the breakfast table, lost in memories of previous Christmases, the good and the bad. The wonderful meals at the Weasleys’ house. The laborious process of cooking dinner for the Dursleys and Aunt Marge and whichever one of her vicious dogs she brought with her. The magical feasts at Hogwarts. Going down to the Three Broomsticks for a butterbeer with Ron and Hermione to celebrate the end of term and the beginning of the holidays. The wonderful cloak of anonymity he had been able to wear, tucked into a booth with his friends and left alone to laugh and drink with them, without worrying about being hounded by the press.
“Where to next, Potter? We still need our books, and some quills, and I know that my stock of salamander’s eyes is running low and Slughorn seem awfully fond of potions that use them,” he went on cheerily, scanning a parchment list that he had taken out of his inner robe pocket. For some reason, the image struck Harry as impossibly odd.
Hermione sat down at the table while Malfoy went to make them all cups of hot chocolate. Just as Harry expected, as soon as he was out of ear shot, his friends began drilling him to make sure he actually was alright and after several minutes of assuring them that yes, he was there of his own free will and yes, Malfoy really wasn’t too bad now and that yes Hermione, he does have a house elf but no, he isn’t a slave, Malfoy pays him and they’re actually quite good friends, they both seemed to visibly settle down and stop inching their hands towards their wands.
. But then Harry thought about Diagon Alley. And all the balls and parties he would be expected to attend if it got out he was back, and then he would have pissed off the entire Ministry for nothing.
Harry turned back to face Ron, who was bouncing restlessly on his toes several meters away. He watched Harry expectantly, nodding towards the Quaffle in his hands.
“Well, I guess it’s my turn then,” Malfoy said, walking across the room to the piano and sitting down behind it. “I wrote you a song, Potter. But you’re not allowed to do anything stupidly Gryffindor like cry until I’m finished.”
“Are you and Hermione alright keeping a hold of our book bags?” Harry asked, shifting Draco’s weight as his boyfriend curled his head up against his shoulder.
Harry groaned, as they dissolved into a murmured half-fight over who the better person was. Honestly, if they weren’t his best friends, he would have been tempted to dump a goblet of pumpkin juice over their heads long ago!
“Happy Christmas, Teddy.” Harry noted that his godson’s hair was slowly darkening from blond to black as he walked out the door with Andromeda, eyes brilliantly green as he turned to wave at him and Malfoy.
So, there you go! I promise that it will get more original in the chapters to come, but you were warned about the trope-iness! Kudos and comments are always appreciated. :)
At least his friends hadn’t yet realized that something strange was up. Ron and Hermione were even starting to get used to Malfoy. He and Hermione managed to have several civil conversations about various assignments and while Ron had gotten into a furious debate with him over England’s new Seeker, afterwards he had quietly admitted to Harry that Malfoy had been right. It was an altogether jarring turn of events and the whole thing made Harry feel quite dizzy and unsure.
Christmas was important to Harry. It had been some of his only happy childhood memories from living with the Dursleys, when Dudley had been too distracted by his presents to bully him and there was so much food that even he could eat until he was stuffed. Then when he had gone to Hogwarts, the sheer magic that was displayed around the castle during the season was a reminder every day of the new world he had been given. It was the first time he had been given a present that wasn’t carelessly thrown at him at the last minute.
She glared pointedly at him. “Now, I don’t know how you do things in Gryffindor, but at Slytherin parties, we keep the public make-out sessions to a minimum. As in, zero. No one here wants to see you and Draco in a desperate lip-lock, so in future, take your urges into his room where the rest of us don’t have to watch.”
“Good.” Satisfied that they had both been sufficiently warned, Pansy dumped the long aforementioned drinks into their laps and walked off, waving to Goyle who was holding up what looked suspiciously like a sobbing Crabbe.
Harry turned, sheepish smile trembling slightly as nerves roiled through him. “Hey. I found another one.”
“That’s not what I meant,” she said, exasperated, but grinning as she got to her feet. “You should go on holiday away from London. Go enjoy the season in some small Muggle town and forget about all the Ministry parties and the reporters and everything.”
“Look, can we please just go in and get this over with?” Potter pleaded, taking off his absurd circular glasses and cleaning them on his shirt before replacing them, just as smudged as before. “I don’t see what
Harry caught the door before it swung shut behind Malfoy, who was now leaning imperiously against one of the walls.
Madam Malkin nodded diplomatically, pulling her enchanted measuring tape from around her neck and nudging it in their direction. She took out a sketchbook, jotting down the numbers that glittered above the ivory tape as it measured the distance between their shoulders and their ankles.
Harry hesitated, glancing back at Susan, who was still staring at him and Malfoy in shock, tears drying up. Emboldened by her response, he threw what little caution he still possessed to the wind. “Sorry, love, I had to tell her about us. She was trying to ask me out.”
Besides, it had been part of a competition. He was a Slytherin, which meant he would do anything that gave him an advantage. Even kissing his enemy.
In which Harry loves his friends, but gets a bit tired of them, Ron and Hermione live in their own world, and Pansy triumphs over all.
“Now for decorations!” O’Leary declared, snapping his fingers. Instantly, shiny red baubles appeared across the tree’s branches.
They appeared with a jolt in what Harry recognized to be the alley way beside the Three Broomsticks. The pub looked the same as ever, lamp light glowing cheerily from the windows and sounds of merriment coming from inside. It was as if he was back at school again popping down to Hogsmeade for a quick butterbeer before rushing back for Quidditch practice.
“Damn it,” she said, in a rare show of temper, tossing her cards onto the table. “I thought you’d never played before, Parkinson. How’d you get so bloody good?”
Muscles tense, Harry walked down the stairs and over into the kitchen, where Malfoy was already seated at the dining table.
“Thank Merlin; otherwise I would have to have some words with you about what just happened back there beside the lake,” Harry said, barely able to suppress his own smile.
“I guess I just never really thought of you as the outdoors type,” Harry admitted, taking a moment to transfigure his boots into skates the way Hermione had taught him and Ron to do when they had gone skating on the Great Lake at Hogwarts.
“Ahem, good evening, Potter,” the blond young man attempted, crouched guiltily beside the desk, as if he had been looking underneath it. While searching for something.
Harry was opening his mouth, about to mention their impending escape, when Draco suddenly pressed a casual kiss to his temple. Harry pulled back, staring at Draco with shock, laughing. “What in Godric’s name was that?”
“Ah, well, it’s a funny story, you see, I came in here, looking for a broom,” Malfoy said, trying his best to look innocent and not at all like someone ransacking a guest’s room.
Malfoy waved a hand dismissively. “Brilliant. Carry on then if you like, although I just came in to tell you that O’Leary and I were going to head outside to find a tree and you are welcome to come with us if you like.”
A sliver of relief passed over Malfoy’s face for a second, before he nodded gravely, making his way quickly past Harry towards the door. “Yes, so if you happen to see one—"
Kudos and/or comments are as wonderful as latkes (which I will be going to have leftovers of right now).
“Do it?” He suggested innocently, barely dodging the not-so gentle punch Pansy aimed at his arm. “I’m only joshing, Pans. You know I’ll carry your bag for you any day.”
Malfoy stared at the present for a moment, before taking it, carefully pulling off the paper and tape to reveal a shiny plastic case.
“What?” He said defensively. “I’m paying them to provide me with a service! It’s their job to get my order right! And be honest, do I look like the kind of person who would ever order some stupid holiday shit?”
“Alright, well, it started with the Trials,” Malfoy let out a long breath, settling back into his seat.
Oh, the intrigue! What is Draco talking about? What is Harry going to mock him over? Tune in next week to find out! ;)
“You know what, I’ll take two,” Harry said, setting the striped one down on the counter and grabbing a smaller crimson one. “And a bag of the caramels.”
“I guess,” Malfoy’s eyes suddenly widened and he glared accusingly at Harry. “Wait, this isn’t because you’ve set us up on some stupid double date with Granger and Weasley, is it?”
“So then why pretend any differently? The money’s already payed in full, although I don’t even see why you of all people would need it in the first place—”
Harry bristled. “Well, it was my fault that I knocked him into the lake, and anyway, I told you, I didn’t know that it was him when I rescued him.”
They stood in an awkward circle for an overlong pause, before Pansy clapped her hands together decisively.
“What’s foolish is going on flying in January,” Draco replied tersely, grey eyes flitting to the broom lying forgotten beside Harry.
Harry scowled. “We said we’d meet at quarter after two, so I would say that a search party was more than warranted. I’ve been freezing to death out here for over half an hour!”
Harry gritted his teeth and let out a controlled breath. “I need you to pretend that we’re dating for at least a week or two, so my story doesn’t fall through. Then we can break up and I can string out the broken-hearted excuse for a nice long time and that should get me through any proposals until at least next term.”
Sure enough, when Draco glanced down, he saw that that the white fabric was splotched with brilliant dots of scarlet in a trail from his wrist to his elbow, reminiscent of the path Potter’s fingers had traced.
“You sound like a Hufflepuff,” Malfoy said, impatiently grabbing the bowl of icing from Harry and sticking the walls together himself.
Choosing a cozy red toque and a pair of thick black gloves, Harry once again stepped outside, his new knitted armor protecting him against the cold.
The two of them finished up their breakfast and headed outside, dressed in proper winter accoutrement.
“Draco, I really think that you should rest,” he said, standing beside him until the Slytherin had lowered himself into his chair, all while grasping Harry’s shoulder tightly for balance.
“Although you’ll have to join in with the chores,” Mrs. Weasley continued brusquely, turning to head back into the kitchen. “George, will you take him out to the garden so he can help de-gnome the place? They’re just everywhere.”
Harry wearily pushed himself back up to standing. Bracing himself, he dove back into the room, where the benefit was still going full swing. He kept a fixed smile on his face as he wove through the crowd, searching for Draco’s light hair.
At first they both seemed to be holding their breath, not wanting to make any sudden noises for fear for breaking whatever moment this was, but gradually Draco relaxed and their breaths gently synced, fading into the soft sound of the crackling fireplace.
“You have to carefully peel away the extra dough and use a spatula to put the shapes on the baking tray,” Harry said, demonstrating while Malfoy watched closely, as though he was showing him how to perform heart surgery instead of simply transporting a cookie.
“You have to come play Poker tonight,” Harry burst out, whispering, although he doubted either Ron or Hermione would have noticed if he had been shouting, they were so fixated on each other.
“Fair point,” Draco conceded, sighing as he pulled himself up and walked over to the exit. “Let’s go.”
Harry’s lips twitched. He wanted so desperately to laugh at this unexpected side of Malfoy, but he held it in, simply nodding since he didn’t trust himself to speak.
Scrambling out from underneath his many layers of blankets, Harry grabbed a fresh jumper out of Hermione’s bag, determined to give Malfoy as few things to criticize as possible. He even attempted to run a comb through his unruly hair, giving up when a tooth broke off.
Slowly, Ron stuck his head out from his covers, yawning widely. “So it is,” he mumbled, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. “Merry Christmas, mate.”
Harry felt the beginning of some words that were sure to come out unintelligible forming on his lips, but he abandoned the thought quickly, instead wrapping his hand around Malfoy’s green and silver striped tie, pulling him back down into a kiss that was somehow even more perfect than the first one. And this time, neither of them pulled back.
But Harry cut him off, the familiar heat of competing with the Slytherin now paired with the electricity of kissing him in an irresistible pull.
Going over to his trunk, he quietly pulled out a sheet of parchment, a silver inkwell, and a quill, setting them on the floor as he penned out a short letter to his mother.
“Sorry, but I just recently got out of a pretty serious relationship and I’m not ready to think about other people yet,” Harry said automatically, repeating the line that Hermione had given him in preparation for this inevitable moment. Yet despite the fact that it was just a rehearsed piece made up to provide a no-arguments shut down, as Harry blankly watched Colin’s understanding nod and goodbye, he knew that in some part, it was the truth. He really wasn’t ready to think about anyone else, not when his every spare thought belonged to Draco and it hurt to breathe because of him.
Harry grinned at him. “Have you ever considered that it might be your fault for being so obnoxiously good-looking?”
“Anyway,” Harry continued, ignoring Malfoy. “I didn’t tell either you or Hermione because I didn’t want you to . . . well, do what you did tonight.”
“No,” Harry said smugly, stepping away from the wall, hands in his pockets. “It’s just that that’s why I walked over here in the first place. To convince you to go to the match with me.”
“Right. Sounds good.” Harry followed Malfoy and O’Leary into the house, carefully brushing the snow off of his boots.
“Um, well it was actually supposed to be you,” Harry admitted, kissing Draco’s temple. “But I guess you can have a stage-name.”
Harry was baffled. Was Snape using Malfoy’s cologne in some sort of potion? “I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand.”
“What?” Harry looked up at the sudden sound of Malfoy’s voice, wondering if he had spoke his thought about installing a fireplace aloud. “This may come as a surprise to you, but I’ll be careful enough not to burn my flat down.”
“It’s alright, Hermione,” Harry said. “He’s right. I can’t just waltz through the busiest wizard street in England. Merlin, it would have been nice though. To just slip through, unnoticed, and be able to enjoy the beginning of the holidays.”
Draco snorted. “Potter, no one wears robes to a party, not even you. The rest of the uniform is tolerable, but robes make it seem as though you’re just begging to be mocked. And no one would believe that I’d let my boyfriend subject himself to that kind of social folly. Speaking of, let me redo your tie.”
“Bad memories, Pot-, ahem, Harry?” Malfoy amended, glancing at the students sitting around them and remembering their audience.
He glanced up at Malfoy, who had managed to catch his fall, startled by how grey his eyes were this close. He’d never really had a proper look at them before, he realized idly. They looked like the sky right before a magnificent storm began.
Sucking in a mental breath, Draco plunged into the crowd, bracing himself against the motions of forgotten elbows and shoulders. A sudden grip on the back of his collar had him almost reflexively casting a hex, before he recognized the warm, calloused touch as Potter’s. It was a smart move, without which Draco was sure he would have lost him, shouts of warning swallowed up by the angry start of another Weird Sisters song.
“You know there’s going to be stories about us on the front page of every newspaper tomorrow?” Harry said cautiously, fearing what Malfoy had gotten himself into by defending him.
Malfoy’s eyes widened with surprise and he lowered his wand to his side. He looked like he wanted to say something biting, but he appeared to swallow it back with obvious pain and managed through gritted teeth, “I was expecting you to Floo in.”
She glared at him. “Ron, we talked about this! Harry, I’m so sorry. I told him you could take care of yourself and that you were probably fine.” Her eyes flickered towards Malfoy, glinting with apprehension that undercut her words.
“Something’s different,” he insisted for the umpteenth time as he and Hermione and Ron walked to Potions. “I know it is.”
“Ron, will you help me look for it?” Granger continued, standing up from the table as though Draco hadn’t said anything.
Malfoy returned with the cocoa, and continued to make an effort to be, if not actually pleasant, at least not openly hostile, making only one or two snide remarks each time after which Harry kicked him pointedly under the table. Slowly Ron and Hermione began to talk more freely and soon they were all chatting about Christmas memories from Hogwarts and the heavy amount of snow Britain was getting this year and the new breed of letter-carrying owl taking the wizarding world by storm, but was actually no better than a regular mail owl. Malfoy’s charm was making a rare appearance and Harry watched as his friends became more at ease with the Slytherin.
Guilt singing through him, Harry quickly dived down to balance over the water, trying to grab one of the person’s arms without dragging himself under too.
“Speaking of holiday spirit, I don’t see much of it around here,” Andromeda noted, nodding at the bare walls.
“Look, Malfoy, it’s not a big deal,” Harry said tiredly, leaning against one of the desks. “It’s in the past.”
But that all changed after he killed Voldemort. Now he was a hero, someone who had actually done something, someone to be looked up to.
“Are you coming or not? These things only last for so long,” Malfoy warned, reaching out his hand to Harry, who took it, and was instantly sucked into oblivion, as Malfoy apparated them both out of 9544 Magnolia.
Harry nodded. He had spent his whole summer at the Burrow hearing about little else. The whole wizarding world was abuzz over the trials for the remaining Death Eaters left after Dumbledore defeated Voldemort in the duel at the Ministry. The same night Sirius died, his life one of the last taken by Voldemort’s cruel regime.
“Alright,” Malfoy said begrudgingly. “But if you lose me another competition, you’ve been warned, Potter. My vengeance will be swift and deadly.”
Still skeptical, Harry waded through the snow after him, ducking under tree branches as Malfoy led him down what looked to be a narrow deer path that wove through the forest, finally coming out – sure enough – on the snowy banks of an iced over lake.
“Actually, Ron, maybe we could play a game that we can all participate in at once?” Hermione suggested, easily shaking some brown sugar onto her oatmeal with her free right hand.
Harry swallowed, summoning the courage that had swum through his veins only moments before. “I’d like a word,” he said, meeting the Slytherin’s gaze resolutely.
Malfoy looked up from Teddy, suddenly noticing Harry watching the two of them and Harry felt his face flush, turning his gaze onto the roaring fire in the grate instead.
“Do you wipe the floor with Weasley and his friends?” A slight smirk was on Malfoy’s face, but it wasn’t vindictive, instead closer to knowing, as if he and Harry were in on a joke. Which, Harry supposed, they were.
They continued chatting, darting from Muggle music to explaining how movies worked to the new line up for the Holyhead Harpies. Their drinks arrived soon and Harry could hardly believe that he was sitting in the Three Broomsticks just casually having a butterbeer like any old wizard. Except this time he was sitting beside Draco Malfoy. Life certainly was curious, but Harry couldn’t find it in him to care that his eleven-year-old self would be horrified at the recent turn of events. He had spent enough time dwelling on the past and he wasn’t going to do that anymore, not when he was wonderfully happy right now.
Around him, the rest of his dormmates were just beginning to stir as the rays of the sun were starting to become visible through the murky lake water outside their dorm room window. It sent a faint glow over the other beds, contrasting oddly with the silver and green hangings.
“Why so glum, Potter?” Malfoy smirked, coming over to stand beside him. “You look like Gryffindor just lost the House cup.”
Harry turned to see Snape walking slowly towards him, a soft, malicious smile on his face. If he didn’t know better, Harry would have described the look in Snape’s black eyes as ‘glee’, but such a word was far too chipper for the moody potions master.
“Cupboard?” Draco let out a surprised sneeze. “You mean that it’s true? You actually slept in a cupboard?”
“I’m going to take notes for our match against them,” Harry said, making a mental note to bring along a quill and some parchment. “Get Katie to run some drills with Demelza and Ginny.”
She looked embarrassed. “Sorry, it’s just, what if Potter’s using you for some kind of publicity stunt or something? I don’t know.”
“Erm, yes, that’s the one,” Harry admitted, peering around another shelf before turning back to look at the other side of the row they’d just come down. Unfortunately, he didn’t quite see a heavy stack of dictionaries set on the floor beside the bookshelf and tripped, tumbling forward before a sudden pair of arms halted his movement.
Harry found himself passed around the living room, greeting the Weasleys. Draco held onto the back of his coat so as not to lose him in the crush, while O’Leary immediately began introducing himself to people and complimenting them on the large Christmas tree in the corner of the room.
Happy back-to-school to y'all! If you're anything like me, you're already ready to abandon your actual studies in favour of spending time in the world where Hogwarts - the school you actually should be going to - exists! And I am glad to be doing my part to hopefully help provide content for your escapes!
Harry shook the creature’s hand, glad to have something else to focus on. “It’s actually Potter. Nice to meet you as well, O’Leary.” The elf certainly looked to be in better condition than Dobby was when Harry had first met him. His flannel was clean and his bulbous eyes eager and bright, not seeming to hold any grudge against Malfoy.
“Honestly, Granger, you said it yourself, I’m not dying!” Draco said crossly, linking his arms around Harry’s neck so he could glower down at her.
I wanted Draco to be listening to Panic! At the Disco or Fallout Boy or something, like the confusingly angsty yet refined teen we all know he is, but since this is supposed to be set during the late ‘90s, I couldn’t justify yet another bending of the rules of reality for this fic, so I went with Queen instead.
Malfoy begrudgingly continued his icing design, cringing when Harry began heaping bright red candy cane shavings on top of it, but slowly relaxing as he went along, even throwing on a handful of sprinkles himself, although Harry noticed that he immediately covered up the evidence with a tasteful icing snowflake.
“I had to run all over the bloody castle to find you,” Draco snapped, shivering in only his school robes. Harry hated that he noticed.
Even through their robes, Malfoy’s surprising warmth quickly transferred over to Harry, dulling his shivers as the game started back up. It felt impossibly odd to be sitting cuddled up to Malfoy watching a Quidditch match, but Harry was too cold to even consider moving. Besides, it would do wonders to cement their image as a couple.
I have a lot of nice fluffy stuff coming up, which I’m very excited about, as the story starts to wrap up in the weeks to come in time for me to get my ass into gear for NaNoWriMo!
“No, I know what you said, it’s just . . . it’s a gingerbread house, Malfoy. You’re supposed to make something you want to eat afterward, not put in a museum and bore people with.”
Kudos and/or comments seriously just mean so much, so thank you to everyone who has brightened my day with them! Y'all are amazing. <3
With the Quaffle now in their possession, the yellow-robed team sped determinedly down the pitch, only to be blocked by a matching pair of jet-black Bludgers punted their way by the Ravenclaw beaters, who waved cheerily at the disgruntled Hufflepuffs.
“It’s been a while since I’ve done this,” Harry said with a laugh, wobbling a bit as he tried to continue forward without losing his balance. “Since school actually.”
He straightened, quickly taking a sip of pumpkin juice to give him time to think of a response. “Just tired,” he insisted. “I was up late working on that Transfiguration paper for McGonagall.”
Without a second thought, Harry threw back the potion. The taste was as horrible as he remembered it and the squeezing sensation that wracked his body wasn’t too pleasant either, as his vision grew blurry and he felt his legs stretch, giving him a few more inches of height. He took off his glasses, as clearly whoever he had transformed into didn’t need them, and tucked them into his jumper pocket.
“Harry? Really, mate, you look kind of funny,” Ron said worriedly, taking firm hold of his arm as though he might collapse at any moment. “Do you need to go see Madam Pomfrey?”
Giving up on his name, Harry insisted, “I really would like to. I was planning on going outside anyway, so I might as well help out a bit too.”
“Yes, thank you,” Harry said automatically, glancing at the various knickknacks crowding the counter as the old lady rang up his purchase. More stacks of books were piled on the edges of the desk, with bags of handmade sweets placed on top of one stack and a basket of brightly coloured knit beanies on another, in a variety of sizes.
Anger flashed through Harry and he pulled his hand back, shoving it into his pocket. “I said, it’s nothing,” he repeated firmly, pushing past Malfoy.
Both he and Harry clung to this welcome interruption. “Oh, wonderful,” “Thank you so much, O’Leary,” “I really appreciate it,” “Just brilliant.”
Harry guided his friends towards the fire place, thanking them again for the intention behind their visit, even if it had been misguided.
“Really,” Harry assured him. “Put away your wand and come sit down and I’ll explain the whole thing.”
Draco raised an impeccable eyebrow. “What? Oh, this?” And he kissed Harry’s other temple, grinning slightly as he pulled back.
They slowly pulled their hands apart, still unable to look away from the other. And then Harry did something that Draco had not known he needed so badly: he reached up and placed a kiss on Draco’s cheek. In view of the entire Great Hall.
“Once you get talking, you’ll be alright. It’s Ron, for Merlin’s sake! You’ve known each other for years. You just want to get to know each other in a different way now.” Harry reached out and squeezed her hand.
The conversation continued, Poker forgotten as the students swapped family stories and memories. Draco settled back in his chair, catching Potter’s gaze, and sharing a grin with him at the odd scene: Gryffindors and Slytherins sitting at a table, chatting like it was nothing after a Muggle card game. If first year Draco had been told that this would happen, he would have laughed off the impossible. But sixth year Draco was oddly happy to be there with Potter and their friends. Just talking. Despite it all.
The sun was just barely creeping over the horizon when the loud buzzing of his magical alarm sounded in Draco’s ears. Groaning, he reluctantly slid out from underneath the warm bedspread, wincing when he touched the cold stone floor.
“Only if you help,” Malfoy told him, walking across to the piano and helping Teddy up onto the bench.
“Well, it’s the fourth time you ‘forgot’ this week,” Draco prodded, beginning to grow numb as he felt his heart crack. This was actually happening. Whatever insipid fairy tale dreams he had were truly coming to an end.
Harry caught Malfoy’s eyes, smiling at him as he sang. It was the night before Christmas. A time of new beginnings and hope for the year to come. And there was no one he’d rather spend it with than Draco Malfoy. Somehow. Impossibly. Perfectly.
“At least Austria didn’t have to work around two incompetent chasers,” Harry pointed out, turning back to the field to watch as Ravenclaw got back possession. “Rojas and Miraflores should have been replaced with reserve players.”
Harry ran around the back of the car, swinging into the passenger seat and trying without success to wipe the smile off of his face.
Pansy led them over to a carriage and Draco helped them all get their luggage stowed properly, casting charms to ensure that none of it would fall off into the snow.
Harry turned, brushing a soft kiss over his lips, now tasting the remnants of his butterbeer as Malfoy tugged him closer, deepening the kiss. He still smelled like cinnamon and cloves, the thick fabric of his coat soft under Harry’s hands as he held onto the lapels. Harry pulled back an inch, enjoying the up-close view of his dark eyes and the sweep of platinum hair that fell onto his forehead as he stared back at Harry, half a smile ghosting over his reddened lips . . .
Harry simply stared, unable to think of a response as he was still so shocked by the fact that he had just pulled Malfoy out of the lake at six in the morning. If this wasn’t a definite sign that he and mornings were not meant to be, he didn’t know what was.
Ron flushed slightly under his stark freckles, but he nodded. “’Course I know that, Harry. You’re like yet another brother to me. You know, a brother who doesn’t have to listen to my mum, lucky bloke.”
Sunlight slowly crept across Harry’s bedspread, finally reaching his eyes, as he rolled over with a groan, not yet ready to let go of sleep. He lay there for a moment longer, half way between sleep and consciousness, something wriggling in the back of his mind. He was supposed to remember something . . . something was happening.
Harry’s pulse skipped a bit, still not used to Malfoy wanting to romance him. It was rather a nice feeling. “Well, alright then. But you’ll have to hurry. It starts in about ten minutes.”
“To you as well,” Hermione said, reaching over to give Harry a hug. “Sorry about the crowd. Everyone wanted to see you as soon as you arrived.”
“I think it’s time we do the break up,” Harry blurted abruptly, unable to take it for a moment longer.
“You owe me a favour!” Draco blurted out suddenly, abandoning the argument as quickly as he had taken it up.
Harry risked a glance over at Malfoy, who was being uncharacteristically quiet, staring at the floor in front of him.
This time the kiss lasted a fraction longer, giving Harry a chance to feel the strange but not uncomfortable warmth of Malfoy’s lips pressed to his. His hand was going up to touch Malfoy’s cheek when the spell broke, the sensation disappearing along with the kiss.
“A little warning would be nice next time,” Harry said, muttering a quick scourgify to clean up the ink.
And with that, he shut the door abruptly behind him, leaving Harry alone in the room. It was comfortable enough, with a large bed placed against the wall opposite the chest of drawers and a small desk pushed underneath a casement window looking out at the front yard over top of the dead rosebushes below.
“Stand back,” Harry advised, sending Draco scrambling back a few feet as he began to swing the gnome in practiced circles, before letting it fly loose over the fence and far off into the field surrounding the Burrow.
“Not bad,” Draco said pleasantly. “Binns assigned a load of work, but at least it was about the goblin rebellions this time and not the troll sanctions. I found the reading for that terribly tedious.”
“Were you raised in a barn?” Malfoy muttered, pulling out his wand and conjuring a flame within the fireplace.
She shrugged, still grinning. “Realistic Pansy broke through and remembered that this is still Potter we’re talking about and that he is going to mock you mercilessly for this, boyfriend or not! I just wish I could be there to see it. Perhaps we could sneak into old Dumbledore’s office and snatch a moment with that Pensieve,”
The woman from the counter stepped out into the middle of the room. “Alright, are you all ready to begin?”
Potter was smiling, the flash of his slightly crooked canines only making him look more handsome. “Tell me more about the stars,” he whispered, curling into Draco’s side, and playing with the ends of his scarf.
Harry stared out through the window over the sink, surprised to realize he was unconsciously smiling. Just at the thought of going back into a room of people. People who knew and loved him for who he was, not what he had done. People who had become his family. And a man who had been his enemy and was now so much more he was afraid to think too long on it.
Harry picked up the shovel, yanking it hard to break the ice that had crept over it during the night and froze it to the ground, leaving veins of frost across the handle. He walked down the path, stopping where the snow started and scooping at it, throwing it off to the side in a practiced motion. Before Hogwarts, when he had lived with the Dursleys during the winter, he would always have to shovel their walk and driveway so that Uncle Vernon could get to his car in the morning for work. Sometimes Harry would be out there at five in the morning, pushing away the effects of an overnight blizzard, but strangely enough, that was one of the few chores he had actually enjoyed. He had liked the quietness of the task, the repetitive motions of digging the shovel under the heavy compressed layer of snow and tossing it to the side, forming natural walls along the edges of the pavement as he went along.
“I mean it!” Ron got to his feet, still quite unsteady from the stunning spell, but brandishing his wand determinedly. “I won’t let you keep Harry hostage any longer!”
Harry trailed after him outside, where it had started to rain slightly, the droplets peppering the lenses of his glasses. “But—”
“You’ll just have to wait and see,” Harry said stubbornly, pushing Malfoy out the door with a quick consolation kiss brushed against his cheek before he shut the door to block his protests.
Ron’s eyes opened and he sat up with a gasp, wand arm flailing wildly. “I’m armed! I’m armed! Don’t hurt Harry!”
“Well, no matter now,” Malfoy sighed dramatically. “My boyfriend and I would like to sign up to compete.”
“Breakfast sounds great!” Harry said hurriedly, scrambling to his feet, pushing aside whatever had just come over him. “Let’s go!”
“Well,” Draco began, only to trail off as he realized that, for the first time in his life, he could think of absolutely nothing to say. Instead, he picked up the bottle of fire whiskey that had been thrown at him, using a corner of his unbuttoned sleeve to dab unsuccessfully at the damp patches of condensation that had transferred from the bottle to his pantlegs.
“My cologne?” Draco repeated, staring at Potter as he nodded eagerly, green eyes shining behind his ridiculous glasses. “Noticed that, did you, Potter?”
Grinning, very relieved to still be in possession of his life, Harry turned his head, looking over at him. “I thought you’d be proud. I also thoroughly enjoyed how Hufflepuff you went on me. A moment for the ages. Although what was with that forehead thing? Were you trying to check my temperature?”
was splashed in bold across the paper, over top of a picture of him and Malfoy sitting beside each other with looks of shock of their faces as they caught sight of the reporters.
Tiptoeing through the living room that he had caught a glimpse of the day before, Harry found himself in a large, but cozy kitchen. However, it was not as empty as he had expected.
Soon the gingerbread pieces were set together and it was time for the most important part: decorating.
Draco shook his head, leaning back against the couch cushions. “It got . . . complicated. In more ways than one. I . . . I think I fell in love with him.”
“Okay, that part is not my fault!” Malfoy insisted loudly, pointing accusingly at the car as if it were to blame. “I ordered a black one but the dealership got it mixed up and by that point, Father and Mother were already getting suspicious over my first disappearance from Diagon Alley during school shopping, and so I didn’t dare sneak away to find one of those Muggle fellytones and so I ended up with a yellow car!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Very funny.” He broke off a corner of the roof, popping it into his mouth while Malfoy watched, aghast.
Malfoy glanced at him, teetering. “Alright, I guess we could come,” he said finally. “So long as you’re sure it won’t be putting them out.”
“Well, I was right here the whole time, so that was rather foolish of you,” Harry said coldly, heart thundering in his ears as loudly as the wind.
He tried a different tactic. “It’s only a couple days until Christmas. Can’t you wait a little bit longer? Have some patience?”
“Could have used that to get it here in the first place,” he pointed out, just as he did every year.
They shared a begrudging smile at the memory and Harry shrugged, still grinning slightly. “You wish.”
“I’m sure Hermione didn’t mean it, Ron,” Harry sighed, still watching the door, heart sinking every time a group of Slytherin students walked in and his boyfriend wasn’t among them. “It was just a slip-up. It’s fine. The knut for saying Malfoy instead of Draco was just a joke. I don’t expect you to call him Draco every time after referring to him as Malfoy for five years. Even I mess up sometimes. And Merlin knows he still calls me Potter far more than Harry.”
He turned his head, noting the steady rise and fall of Potter’s chest and the faint stubble darkening his jaw. Potter stared back at him through snow-smudged glasses, smiling softly, and rubbing his thumb gently across the back of Draco’s hand in an almost absent-minded fashion. The caress was soothing, and strangely felt more intimate than when Potter was pressing urgent, heated kisses against his mouth. The sensation made his stomach flutter.
His boyfriend shrugged. “Compared to most of my coverage, getting caught snogging the Chosen One is hardly the worst they’ve done.” He glanced over at Harry nervously. “That is of course, so long as you’re alright with it. It’s not exactly a subtle way of announcing our relationship to the world.”
Madam Hooch let out a piercing blast on her whistle that echoed around the stadium, putting the scramble for the Quaffle to a halt. Both teams took a time out and huddled in circles on either side of the pitch.
Despite the continued character pain, I again urge you to think of all the chapters of happiness I gave you before this time and humbly ask for a comment and/or a kudos! Make me as happy as Draco and Harry are made by each other! Or just feel free to yell at me about the past couple of chapters. I’m good with anything! I know your pain!
“Alright there, Potter?” Malfoy said quietly, staring at Harry as though he’d really meant to say something else but now couldn’t remember what it was.
“Good morning,” Harry responded, nodding politely towards Crabbe, Goyle, and Parkinson, who were all watching him and Malfoy with odd expressions. “Could I talk to you for a moment, Draco?”
“It’s perfect,” O’Leary whispered, staring up at the glowing tree with what almost looked like tears in his eyes.
Now they were all back up in the Gryffindor common room, where a fire was blazing merrily in the grate. Granger was reading, Potter was showing the Weasley girl how to play Poker, and Draco was getting thoroughly trounced in chess.
He turned to Ron and Hermione, who would be glad to help him sort out the mix up, but they too had odd expressions plastered across their faces. Behind his freckles, Ron’s face was going almost green and Hermione’s eyes were flicking between him and Malfoy, whose pale eyebrows were raised so high that they nearly disappeared into his hairline. Surely it wasn’t that much of a shock that Harry knew what Malfoy’s expensive cologne smelled like? The Slytherin had been dousing himself in it daily for as long as Harry could remember. It wasn’t even that bad of a smell either, reminding him of spiced apple pie with clove and cinnamon, not like the stuff Dean had tried out the night of the Yule Ball. That had reeked so badly that his date had refused to dance with him and he had ended up hiding in their dormitory for the remainder of the evening, too embarrassed to stay. Compared to that, Harry would take a room full of Malfoy’s cologne any day. But everyone else was looking at him like he was insane. Maybe they just didn’t care for fall spices?
In which Pansy does some well-intentioned manipulation, Harry almost makes Draco think he's a smooth flirter, and something unexpected happens.
He stared at Harry, whose expression was unreadable as he looked back at him, waiting for Draco to respond. The whole Great Hall seemed to be holding its breath as the two boys stared at each other, hands trembling by their sides.
Malfoy sighed resignedly. “I guess we’d better. The damn charm is impossible to break.” He leaned forward and gave Harry a quick peck on the lips, the grip of the spell immediately breaking.
“Is Malfoy wearing your tie, Harry?” Ron asked, his voice remarkably steady, with only its dangerous tone betraying his real feelings.
“Goodness, kissing me was an experiment! I’m just so flattered. Wait until Pansy hears,” Malfoy drawled sarcastically.
“What are you doing?” Draco demanded, as Potter eagerly tugged him back around the shelf and pointed to the large casement window ensconced in the stone wall.
Malfoy turned, a familiar burning in his eyes that instantly made Harry feel more at ease. He knew how to deal with Malfoy’s anger. It was something he had known for years and he would much rather face it head on than have him cover it up with falsely polite words and pleasantries.
Panicked, Ron checked to make sure their friend hadn’t caught the end of Harry’s warning, before glaring at Harry direly.
Harry’s gaze flitted between them and Malfoy, who was smirking smugly and smoothing out imaginary creases from his shirt.
“It was fake,” Draco suddenly blurted out, unable to take it any longer. “The relationship. It was fake, it . . . it wasn’t real. Just an act made up so he’d have a reason to refuse his fans’ proposals.”
“No, I will not hand you back your book!” Pansy said angrily, kicking the text away. “Draco, you’ve done nothing but study for weeks! You barely sleep; You pick at your food like it’s dirt and you hardly speak to me anymore! And it’s all fucking Potter’s fault and don’t try to tell me it isn’t, because that’s a lie and you and I both know that! I—”
Hermione seemed to pick up on more of the turmoil Harry was trapped in, but even she didn’t say anything further about it, sending him a concerned glance before awkwardly suggesting they finish up breakfast and get to class.
“Rather a useful little invention, quite handy for when one wants to go somewhere without looking like oneself, such as, I don’t know, going to the Three Broomsticks when you’re Harry Potter, famous saviour, and Draco Malfoy, infamous ex-Death Eater.”
Instead retreating to a sofa in the living room once again, Harry resigned himself to spending the day much the same as the one before.
Malfoy looped his arm through his again, grinning. “I think I’m starting to like these Muggle conventions.”
“I’m in awe,” Harry said finally, shaking his head in bewilderment. He had been pushing and coaxing his blushing friends towards each other since the beginning of the term and one pointed conversation with Draco Malfoy and they were going on a date.
“It’s happening right now and instead of breathing it in and smiling so hard it hurts, it’s tainted by that fucking crowd.” Harry threw himself onto the squashy yellow couch, stewing.
“Malfoy?” He said in disbelief, gapping as he took in the boy’s familiar features, which were already twisting into a scowl.
“Oh, honestly you two! Get a room!” Harry interjected crossly, pushing his plate back and standing up.
“This is absolutely brilliant,” Harry told Malfoy, half leaning against his shoulder, drowsy from the late hour. “You’re brilliant.”
Once properly attired, he headed out into the common room, perching primly at the end of one of the stiff couches. At first it was just resting an arm on the side of the furniture, then tilting his head back on the hard cushions. But as the minutes passed, he slowly slumped further over, forgoing any semblance of the proper posture befitting a Malfoy as he finally curled up in the folds of his robes and drifted off into an uneasy sleep.
“Very good then,” Malfoy nodded, as nonchalantly as if he’d just asked Harry if he was enjoying his oatmeal rather than talking about a dramatic catalyst in their over a decade long relationship. “Shall we head out around ten?”
“As you know, my,” Malfoy faltered, before pushing on determinedly. “My father was one of those waiting for his sentence. He ended up with three months in Azkaban and extensive monetary compensation. But in the mean time, my parents decided to send me to summer with a cousin who lived on the edge of a small French Muggle town.”
“I just wanted to see if you were alright after your swim yesterday,” Harry said, crossing over to stand beside Malfoy, guilt churning heavier after seeing the obvious affects of his cold.
“Comb your hair!” The mirror yelled at him as he turned on his heel and Apparated, popping out around the corner from a nearby bus station. He had arranged with the house owner to Floo over for 4 pm, however as soon as Harry had woken up, he knew he wouldn’t be able to wait that long to get started. So he bought himself a bus ticket out to Painswick. He would arrive around lunch time and spend the afternoon exploring the village, before heading up to the house at the prearranged time.
Harry pushed some snow into a low wall to hide behind, before beginning to fashion ammunition, packing the flakes tightly between his gloved hands until he had a pile of perfect snowballs just waiting to be thrown at Malfoy’s hatless perfectly coiffed hair.
Malfoy waved an impatient hand, eyes still glued to his book. “For once, not you. The main character’s being an absolutely
Hopefully my alternative Voldemort vanquishing made sense! I basically just ignored the whole Horcrux thing for the ease of it all.
in here,” Malfoy pointed out. “Besides, I can’t leave until you tell me what you’re going to do about this.”
Draco risked a glance down to see how his friends were taking it. He thought his own performance had been exemplary, and from the subdued look on Pansy’s face, he dared to hope she thought the same.
Malfoy laughed at Harry’s surprised expression. “I told you I knew where I was going,” he said smugly. “My family has been coming here every few years since I was a child.”
I'll have you know that when I first came up with the idea for this fic, it was NOT supposed to include TWO common tropes as large plot points, yet here I am, writing a fake/relationship, friends (really enemies but there's sadly no tag) with partial benefits fic. I do promise to balance out the surprising amount of tropiness with more original stuff, but who am I kidding? If you clicked on this fic, it was probably FOR the tropiness! Let me know in the comments so I can be a little more assured that I am not an entirely crazy and self-indulgent fangirl!
It had all been the perfect lead-up to the main day, and when Harry opened his eyes on Christmas morning, outside it was white and sparkling, just as perfect as the rest of the holidays had been so far.
“If you’re happy, then we’ll always be okay with it,” Hermione promised, letting Ron lean tiredly on her shoulder. “We’ll see you at Christmas, alright?”
He sat upright, sliding out of bed and reaching for his jumper, before going out into the hallway. Malfoy was just coming out of his room, yawning and rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
“No, I don’t! What would give you that idea?” Malfoy got up and began walking away, Harry trailing after him, grinning widely.
“What?” Harry asked, the affectionate sound of his first name coming from Draco’s mouth doing funny things to his insides, the way it always seemed to do.
“Harry, it was wonderful to see you so unexpectedly,” Andromeda said, pulling him out of his thoughts.
She spread the paper across the coffee table, pressing a finger against a small article. “I saw it as I was reading this morning. There’s someone in Painswick looking to rent out a room in their house during the holidays. I’m guessing they’re trying to get a wizard or witch so they can charge extra for the Floo connection.”
“This is a rather pathetic song,” Malfoy said after listening for a moment. “Very gloomy for a supposed Christmas song.”
“Ha ha, very funny, Potter,” Malfoy groaned, pulling a set of keys out of his pocket. “Look, if you don’t want to come along for the drive, you don’t have t—”
This last bit was in response to the red and gold striped scarf that Harry was trying to wrap around Draco’s neck in an effort to cover the gaps between the blanket and Draco’s uniform.
“I would appreciate it if you didn’t speak of my boyfriend with such crudeness,” Draco said coolly, head pounding furiously as he prepared himself for the performance of a life time. To a house that was already suspicious by nature, the prospect of him dating Potter was going to be an even tougher sell than it had been for the rest of the school.
Suddenly, Potter’s foot smacked into his leg under the table and Draco was only just able to swallow the string of curses he wanted to spill, remembering their public setting.
“I don’t see what’s so funny,” Draco complained, fumbling with one of Harry’s cufflinks. “Sweet Salazar, how do these work again?”
Noting his gasps, Malfoy pulled back slightly, trailing startling soft kisses down Harry’s jaw. “I nearly got caught by Filch on the way here,” he said conversationally. “Funny how you never mention any near run-ins of your own—”
Strings of fairy lights edged some of the storefronts, with wreaths hung on nearly every other door. Snow clung delicately to the roof tops, incandescent icicles piercing down from the edges like crystalline vampire teeth.
Harry’s heart leapt as he scrambled to get the words out. “Yes! Yes, of course, I’d love to. Thank Merlin.”
Draco bristled, shoving past her and Crabbe and Goyle, who had been flanking her. The rest of his house was seated around the common room, trying in vain to look casual. But Draco could them all leaning towards the conversation, eyes not really focused on the homework or Exploding Snap games in front of them.
Remembering what Malfoy had said about his family’s rough finances, Harry felt a surge of guilt shoot through him. “Oh, Merlin, I’m sorry, Malfoy . . . I didn’t mean to . . . god, my fucking mouth! I didn’t even think—”
“Alright,” Harry said skeptically, settling back against the couch cushions. “So Leroy was excited to go to school. But so was another boy, whose name was, umm, Darren. Now, Darren had never known that magic existed, and discovering that there was a whole other world just waiting for him was one of the most wonderful moments of his life. So Leroy and Darren both bought all of their school supplies and got on the train that would take them to their new school. But as wonderful as the idea of getting to learn magic was, what they both wanted most of all was a friend. So when Leroy came into Darren’s compartment and offered him his hand . . . Darren took it. And for the rest of their lives, they never left each other’s sides. The end. Okay, you can talk now, Draco.” Silence. “Draco?”
Kudos and/or comments are appreciated as much as driving by the sea with windows down and the music loud!
“I assume you’re both here for new school robes?” She asked conversationally, as she gestured for them to both step up onto the fitting pedestals where they had first met all those years ago.
At the end of class, he was still so inter-focused that he stepped right through the cloud of cinnamon that had puffed up from the vial that Neville had dropped into shatters on the ground.
Malfoy continued to ignore Harry’s jabs as they continued outside, where O’Leary was nearly bouncing with excitement. He kept popping in and out of view around them, squeaking with joy as they made their way to the forest that edged the yard of 9544 Magnolia.
The sun was lowering close to the intersection of the horizon when Harry reached the house. The rosebushes from the picture were skeletal twigs now, lines of ice crawling along the stalks, but the house looked just as charming as it had in the summer photograph, now blanketed in a soft layer of snow.
Potter fidgeted, slipping his hands in and out of his pockets, before deciding to just let them hang by his sides. “I wish I’d worn my robes.”
The boy who had dragged him out into the snow for the pure joy of it. Who had listened to his inner-struggles with compassion, despite all their history. Who kissed him every time like it was the last thing he would do.
Harry wanted to crow with victory, but instead he screwed his face tight, grimacing and pressing a hand to his chest. “I don’t know! They just started— ohhh.” He groaned again, pleased to see Malfoy growing even paler than usual.
Malfoy groaned, whispering to Harry, “He takes forever opening his gifts. It’s like this every year.”
“Well, I love you,” Draco countered softly, watching his face with a nervous smile Harry had never seen on him before.
Harry ducked towards Flourish and Blots, determined to get through the door and find that new transfiguration text Hermione had been mentioning, but he was jostled back by the crowd, which continued to grow by the minute.
“Sorry, was there something you needed?” Harry asked politely, anxious to go back to moping in peace.
“Well, I guess you don’t know everything about me then,” Malfoy said, changing his own boots and stepping out onto the lake.
Potter slapped his arm in a manner he obviously thought was playful, but it was all Draco could do to hide his wince at the sharp contact, the blow coming off as a heavy smack rather than a flirtatious tap.
He rested his arm along the back of the couch, moving his other hand to trace ambling lines along Potter’s wrist, smirking as the other boy’s fingers twitched at the sudden contact. “I believe yours were once described to be ‘as green as a fresh pickled toad’,” he teased, allowing his own posh clipping to sink into the intonation.
The man snorted. Harry gritted his teeth, still staring at the chalked drink descriptions. He was on vacation; he was here to enjoy himself and relax, not get into fights with people over coffee.
Harry felt a sharp twinge of guilt and abruptly set down his fork. Getting up from his seat, he brushed off his friends’ questions and walked over to the Slytherin table.
Potter laughed softly, settling back against the couch and staring into the fire, the light reflecting off of his wide glasses. There was something so unguarded about his expression that Draco couldn’t help but look at him. To think that if Potter had never been a muddling idiot in the face of a preposition, then Draco never would have been here. In the Gryffindor common room, wearing the Boy Who Lived’s sweater, and wanting nothing more than to curl up with him. Not fight with him. Not make out with him. Just quietly be with him.
Harry and Andromeda clapped, as Malfoy took Teddy’s hand as they bowed, Teddy bouncing on his toes with excitement.
Harry was speechless, searching wildly for an explanation or help or anything. He scanned the corridor frantically, but the only people coming out of the Charms classroom were Malfoy and some of his housemates, all sniggering about something. Maybe Harry could get Malfoy’s attention and get him to come over and say something insulting, so then he would have a legitimate reason for not answering Susan, who was now full-on bawling.
“Ron, he’s not dying,” Hermione said exasperatedly. “But Harry, he really needs to lie down and rest. I don’t think he’s going to be able to sit through the rest of today’s classes.”
“Malfoy, please just listen to me for a second. People are going to expect us to spend all of the time we have out of the classroom with each other, so it will look odd if we’re not together.” Harry stared at him pleadingly.
Harry paused, rolling the facts around in his head. The Ministry would be angry if he tossed them the bird and disappeared, but then again, he didn’t particularly care what they thought of him. He never had.
He turned the last corner separating him from his demise and saw Potter standing off to one side of the door to the Great Hall, hands in his pockets, staring at the scuffed flagstones, hair as disheveled as ever and hanging over his glasses due to his bent head.
“Now, you did say that you came out here to escape thinking about it,” Malfoy said, a glint in his grey eyes. “So how about we do something to take your mind off of it: another competition, so that I can reclaim my title as eternal victor after your fluke Exploding Snap tie-breaker win last night.”
“You fucking piece of shit!” Malfoy fumed, wiping the snow off to reveal the vengeance in his eyes as he lunged determinedly towards Harry.
Taking one last look around his messy flat, a thrill of excitement ran up his spine. It would be awhile before he saw this place again. The owner of the house had written back to Hermione’s query within half an hour, saying that a non-disclosure was not a problem at all and that the room was his, so for the next few weeks, Harry would be enjoying all the charm and peace afforded by a small English village. The thought made him smile every time it darted through his head.
Reaching blindly, Harry found his glasses, relieved to find that they hadn’t broken, and got to his feet, stomach still hollow as he looked at Malfoy. His one-time enemy who he hadn’t seen in five years. Not since the trials, where he had numbly testified in favour of him and his mother, asking for their freedom while not being able to look them in the eye. All the Malfoys had gotten off with reduced sentences, paying a heavy fine instead of jail time, and last he had heard they had moved to an ancestral estate in France, living quietly and avoiding the press.
Harry smiled. “That’s true enough. I just wanted to say though that I really do appreciate you. You’re my best mate, y’know? And it’s been different, with Malfoy and Hermione and everything, but you know I love you, mate, right?”
“Of course he can! He’s Harry freaking Potter! He can do whatever he damn pleases,” Hermione shot back determinedly, eyes bright.
But then the situation suddenly became much, much worse, as Harry heard the heavy classroom door open behind him and an aristocratic voice drawl, “Sorry, Professor, I forgot my books in my dormitory.”
Harry wasn’t quite sure how to respond as Draco wrapped his arms around his shoulders, resting his head in the crook of Harry’s neck. Finally, he settled on simply returning the embrace, holding Draco tightly and breathing in his comforting, familiar smell of expensive cinnamon cologne, the spiciness easing the sudden tightness in his chest.
The occupying Gryffindor students watched them curiously as Potter led them across the room to where Granger and Weasley were seated at a small table. On top of it was a deck of cards and stacks of odd-looking round tokens, almost like coins, only striped in the gaudiest colours.
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed aloud, eliciting several strange looks from his lingering classmates. He laughed out loud, garnering more concerned stares. Of course!
“It was Umbridge, alright?” Harry snapped harshly, shaking off Malfoy’s grip. “Because I wouldn’t stop saying that Voldemort had returned.”
Diagon Alley was filled with bustling people and Harry seemed to be smacking into all of them. Malfoy gripped his arm tightly as he pulled Harry behind him through gaps in the current that disappeared by the time Harry reached them. As a result, he had nearly had his glasses snapped three times and had been elbowed in the sides more than his fair share.
“Will that be everything Mr. Malfoy?” Madam Malkin asked, tugging Malfoy’s gaze away from Harry’s. He straightened, slipping on his practiced polite smile again.
Harry watched as his platinum head bobbed out of sight, feeling rather drained, like he had just come out of a Triwizard challenge. He slumped against the coffee stall, groaning. “God, I need a drink.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “A lucky shot is one of the reasons Brazil won the International Cup last year, so I wouldn’t sound quite so scornful about it.”
But Harry didn’t get a chance to go a step further, because as soon as the words were out of his mouth, Draco kissed him. A shock went through Harry and he dropped his broom indifferently onto the snow, arms automatically threading around Draco as he kissed him back.
“The same thing you do every time you see her,” Harry said soothingly. “You’ll ask how she is and ask about school and then she’ll get started and you only have to nod encouragingly or say some words of affirmation every so often and you’ll be fine.”
Pansy fell back in her chair, face twisted in an expression that would have been categorized as ‘pouting’ on anyone else. “I’m just showing the kind of concern any friend would!”
Harry studied the article, a roiling of anticipation forming despite himself as he looked at a photograph of a well-kept house with tidy rows of rosebushes edging out from either side of the front door.
“First, Miss Granger,” Snape said cuttingly. “Never assume anything in this classroom. But you are correct this time, which brings me to my second point. It is not illegal to brew Amortentia, merely to use it, which I have no intention of doing.”
Finally, the mayhem was over, everyone settling back to admire their newly acquired treasures. Hermione began reading a book on Poker strategy which Ron had given her, while he leaned against her shoulder, breaking into a box of toffee that Malfoy had given him. Ginny was chatting about Quidditch with another fifth year girl who had just come downstairs, hair escaping from her braids in a haze of red static, and Malfoy was admiring the set of quills that Hermione had got for him.
Harry sighed, leaning up against the polished window as he caught his breath. “Remember how you’re trying to avoid saying rude things about my friends.”
“That's fair,” Pansy sighed and Draco felt relief wash through him. “Maybe you can help me with mine since you’ve got yours’ all finished.”
But it had to be done. It would hurt too much to feel as though he had Draco, when really he never would.
And so the weeks passed, Draco spending as much time as he could in the Slytherin common room, where there was no chance of accidentally running into Harry and he could wallow in peace.
Hey all! So because of scene to chapter organization, this chapter ended up being a bit shorter than I usually do, but it balances out some of my overly long chapters, so it all works out in the end, you just have less to read this week. Apologies!
“You really did though,” Harry said seriously, turning to look up at him. “My friends started to like you.”
“Well then,” Malfoy whispered, gaze flickering down to Harry’s mouth for a second, before looking back up, eyes questioning.
“I really don’t mind,” Draco whispered to Harry as they headed out towards the backdoor. “If it takes getting rid of a few gnomes to help your family like me, I’m more than happy to.”
“Could you be any more overdramatic?” Malfoy grumbled to himself, standing and brushing the soot from his hands.
“Hey, Malfoy!” He called, turning towards the base of the willow tree where he was seated. “We’re going to Hogsmeade together this weekend!”
Granger’s hand, predictably, shot into the air as fast as a Firebolt. Draco could have sworn that Snape rolled his eyes, but if his expression had changed, it was reversed so quickly that he couldn’t be quite sure.
Malfoy looked at him curiously, but then Andromeda was pulling him into a hug and saying something to him, leaving Harry to say goodbye to Teddy.
“Damn it,” he said, frustrated. He stormed up the steps, half knocking on the red door before pushing inside.
To his right, Potter also was shuffling the pieces of his dinner around, eyes fixed studiously on his plate.
Draco snorted, absent-mindedly tracing lines on the back of Harry’s hand as they watched Mr. Weasley continue to insist that he was in fact Santa Claus, to O’Leary’s increasing confusion and everyone else’s amusement, George only egging him on.
Harry watched as Malfoy walked down the hallway towards him, waiting for his customary disdainful sneer to appear on his impossibly handsome face. He felt tired, and leaned back against the wall, wishing that, what was sure to be one of the most embarrassing moments of his life, was over already.
He was halfway to the Charms classroom when he realized he didn’t have any of his books, and a mad dash to the Gryffindor dormitories ensued. Satchel securely tucked in his arms, he ran back to class, muscles burning and breath pounding as he slid irritably into his seat beside Ron.
“No, no, it’s fine,” Malfoy said, slipping his hand into Harry’s and squeezing reassuringly. “I just don’t talk about it a lot.”
Immediately, this kiss felt different, seeming more intentional than the other ones. Malfoy’s arms slipped around Harry’s waist, the contact sending sparks through him even through the layers of clothes. Neither one pulled away, even when the grip of the spell snapped, drawing it out for dizzying seconds until Harry needed breath and stepped back with a small gasp.
Malfoy was waiting by the doors, wearing a scowl and an expensive-looking black peacoat. Harry had never seen Malfoy not wear robes or his school uniform and the effect was more intoxicating than he liked to admit, even when paired with his dark frown. Maybe especially with his dark frown.
“Not at all,” Harry promised, leaning over to kiss him gratefully. “It will be a perfect Christmas.”
Hermione gulped, smiling weakly at Harry. “Well, you see Harry, today’s lesson was on Amortentia, and, er, one of the many properties of it is that its scent will change depending on what each individual person finds most attractive.” Hermione shook her head apologetically, mouthing a silent ‘I’m sorry’ at Harry before she continued. “And, well, um, I guess, I mean, the reason why you’re smelling Malfoy’s cologne has to be that, er, you’re attracted to him?” Her voice was uncharacteristically high pitched and questioning as she ended, watching Harry closely, and biting her lip nervously.
He sighed frustratedly, circling the loop that had been going around in his head since it had happened. There was no certainty anymore.
“Sorry to barge in like this,” he said, blood cooling as he sat between his two best friends, who understood implicitly what was happening to him without him even having to say a word.
Malfoy snorted, still somehow sounding elegant and aristocratic. “Honestly, Potter, you have to do better than that. Although I don’t see what the problem is with green. I’m quite fond of it myself.”
“C’mon,” Harry said, motioning for Draco to follow him over to the other side of the garden. “You have to hunt around for the first couple, but once you get started, the rest of them will start getting curious and popping up into the open to see what all the fuss is.”
Harry’s eyes fluttered open, faint sunlight dancing across them, but he immediately closed them again. He was too comfortable to wake up just yet. The day could wait. He was warm, curled around someone – right, Malfoy – and as far as he was concerned, only an impending troll attack could make him move.
“So there’s an ‘us’, is there?” His smirk was the one thing that hadn’t changed a bit. “Is that what all those glances in there were about? ‘Us’?”
“I just finished it last night, so I didn’t get a chance to wrap it,” Malfoy said apologetically. “So close your eyes and hold out your hands and I’ll give it to you.”
“Yes,” Harry breathed, so quietly he wondered if Draco had even heard him. But his answering grin told him he had. And the following kiss only cemented it more firmly.
“Oy! I’m starving! The rest of you ready for breakfast?” Ron shouted, getting up from his place beside Hermione and becoming Harry’s diversion.
And as Draco lay there, blissfully drifting between consciousness and sleep, he realized, that he liked who
That would make sense. It’s what Harry’s reaction should have been to the unplanned advance. Not a wild desire for a repeat performance. Just because comparing it to Harry’s first kiss made him want to laugh at the absurdity of even calling them by the same name didn’t justify his response. Just because it evoked darkening eyes and gasping breaths instead of tears and crumpled faces didn’t mean he should be daydreaming about his nemesis’s lips.
Harry watched as he strode over to the door, grabbing his coat and boots before stalking out of the house, slamming the door hard behind him, leaving the echo behind as O’Leary stared at Harry with disappointment.
“Thanks,” he said numbly, following Malfoy out of the shop, wordlessly handing him his drink once they were standing on the sidewalk.
Harry and Malfoy shared a smile, watching as the elf continued to take in the sight of the Christmas tree with a contented sigh.
The final cards turned face up, nearly instantaneously going up in smoke. Harry slumped back in his chair, heart thudding with the exhilaration.
After Harry had suggested the break-up, Draco had done his best to avoid him as much as possible for the remainder of the break. It hurt to even look at him, each sight of dark hair and green eyes only reminding Draco of how stupid he had been to even spend a second thinking that this farce could be anything more. Things couldn’t change that much. Harry might have tolerated him when it served his uses, but at the end of the day, he was still Draco Malfoy and no one was less likely to receive the Golden Boy’s affections than him. He was a fool for even entertaining such a thought.
Unbeknownst to both of them, a large expanse of ice lurked under the snow in the center of the field, and as Draco felt a hand grab onto his arm, his feet came out from under him, sending both him and Potter falling into the snow face first.
“Nice try, Potter!” Malfoy shouted, sending some well-aimed snowballs through the air that Harry was just able to duck out of the way of.
"Following the earlier 'success' with the mistletoe, Person A can't stop stringing it up. Eventually Person B gets suspcious."
“What do you want, Potter?” He asked coolly, voice strangely low and raspy due to the cold made obvious by his frequent dignified sniffs.
“Great Godric, ‘Mione, I was only joking!” Ron huffed, tugging his plate out from underneath the newspaper. "And what the hell is 'an eye for an eye' supposed to mean?"
“I’m pretty sure you’ve never mentioned anything of the sort to me,” Harry said, racking his memory of the past week. “And even if you had, it hasn’t gone out. It’s smouldering, the way it’s supposed to.”
“’Course you can,” Draco said, sniffing, and leaning his head against Harry. “I had a great-aunt Gertrude who knit baby blankets with needles made out of the bones of her enemies.”
No one had ever written Harry a song before, at least, not to his knowledge, and the experience of sitting and listening to something and knowing that Malfoy had written in specifically with him in mind was indescribable.
Harry squirmed uncomfortably, unsure how to respond to Malfoy’s strange reaction. “Well, not really. I just used to love doing it as a kid, when I actually believed that there was a bearded man who brought presents to all the good children, even if I never actually got anything I asked for, and so I’ve carried the spirit of the tradition on. It’s a nice way of sitting down once a year and thinking about what things I want most in the world and how grateful I am for the things that I do have, like wonderful friends.”
“This shouldn’t come as that much of a shock,” Malfoy said drily, slipping his hands into his coat pockets. “There’s generally only one coffee shop in a town this small.”
pain to see them hurt. He had experienced something similar with his parents at the end of the war, but even that paled in comparison to the burning conflict tearing through him now, as he walked up to stand beside the boy who had done this to him.
Even now, they had their hands interlaced on the table, set in between their bowls of oatmeal. At least the sight of Ron learning how to use a cutlery with his left hand was entertaining, although Harry didn’t see why they just didn’t hold hands while they were eating. He was glad that they were happy together, but that seemed a bit extreme.
“Because I feel bad,” Harry said, breathing in deeply and stuffing his hand in his pockets as he looked at the other boy. He had long-ago memorized his exact image so it was easy for Harry to see the changes brought on by his sickness. Beyond the reddened nose and the unusually wayward hair that was a result of being smooshed against the breakfast table there was something else different too. But Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on it. He frowned, looking Malfoy up and down, wondering what it could be.
Although he was trying not to listen and simply decide whether he wanted a candy cane hot chocolate or an apple pie latte, Harry winced pre-emptively for the employee, as the man let out a long-suffering sigh.
Draco muttered something unintelligible, waving a hand with the intent of elegantly flipping her off in a fashion that only the truly aristocratic could manage, but his limbs felt too heavy from exhaustion to obey the thought. Instead, he sank back down onto the couch, certain that he belonged there far more than in the chaotic noise of the Great Hall.
“Although perhaps it would have been worth it,” Malfoy mused. “Remember, I’m just the one who has to go to prison for life. You’re the poor git that got killed by a snowball. That’s like dying because you were suffocated by kittens. Pathetic.”
“Harry! I thought I heard you. You’re early,” Hermione said happily, coming into the room and sitting beside Harry, leaning over to hug him.
An experience I'm sure more than a few of you can relate to, especially, if like me, you're stubborn and wear heels during the winter. Now, I consider myself a pretty seasoned veteran heel wearer who usually can run, go up and down hills, and not die on stairs, but add ice in, which Canadian weather often does, and boom! Not even Merlin can save you.
Harry laughed, tucking a lock of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “You have a sore throat from coughing all day and need to sleep, so no, as much as I appreciate the offer, you will just have to put up with my own made-up story, specially created on the spot, just for you.”
Harry shrugged, his anger ebbing away as quickly as it had come. “It’s not your fault. Why would you?”
Draco could see Potter fidgeting uncomfortably out of the corner of his eye. He seemed more skittish than usual tonight. Peculiar.
Draco froze, watching as Potter gaped at his own words, both of their gazes locked onto each other’s in a desperate swirl of confusion.
She waved him off dismissively. “Crabbe only cried that one time and now Goyle makes sure to cut him off after two drinks, so you don’t need to worry about that. And as for the unpleasantness, if you have your boyfriend with you, it should be fun no matter what! Please, Draco!” She coaxed, even going so far as to bat her eyelashes. “Just try it again this once! And if you hate it, even with Potter beside you, I won’t make you go to another!”
It lasted for only a second, a faint glancing of lips, before he stepped back, leaving Harry sputtering with surprise.
“How long have you been there?” Malfoy asked concernedly, walking over towards him, stepping into the spell’s parameters.
“Liar.” Potter’s eyes gleamed brightly as he stared determinedly at him. Draco hated how he noticed the flecks of gold woven through the vibrant green.
Harry saw Ron’s ears tinge red at his own compliment, which Hermione barely seemed to have noticed, so engrossed was she by her plans for her paper. He had been watching the two of them circle around each other since the beginning of term, and while at first it had been disconcerting to realize that his two best friends fancied each other, now it was just annoying to be party to their obliviousness.
“No, not like that,” Harry corrected hastily, nearly putting his arm in the jam. “Just, he wasn’t feeling too well after I fished him out of the lake yesterday and it’s probably only worsened since then, so . . . cut him a bit of slack.”
“Malfoy, you absolute bastard!” Harry said, flinging himself towards the blond young man and throwing his arms around him. Malfoy’s hands were ice-cold as he cautiously returned the embrace.
Eyes still fixated on Draco, drinking in every detail, from the faint pink colouring his cheeks to his rumpled white shirt, Harry reached down and found the smooth silk on the floor, quickly wrapping the tie around his neck and knotting it messily.
The two boys sat there in dark, each struggling with their pasts and how they were intertwined. How five years had changed their lives so immensely. How neither of them had any idea what to expect or want from the future.
“Didn’t know you knew about Muggle things like gravity, Malfoy,” Harry taunted, twangs of anger thrumming inside of him. He felt strangely breathless and almost felt like smiling as he took in Malfoy’s familiar smirk. It had been awhile since he’d had a good fight with someone. He got pissed at the crowds that followed him, but engaging with them never helped. The last time he’d had an actual argument with someone had been the night he and Ginny had broken up, but that had ended with both of them in tears and agreeing it was for the best, no winners, only losers. It didn’t feel like this, with hot energy firing through his veins as he waited to parry each response, having no qualms about throwing Malfoy’s words back in his face.
But Harry barely noticed their argument as he saw a Slytherin student with pale features and coiffed blond hair finally entered the Charms classroom. Harry stood up quickly, intending to rush over to his boyfriend, when Professor Flitwick called for everyone to sit down and direct their attention to the front of the class. Reluctantly, Harry slid back into his seat and waited for Draco to join him at their table.
It felt awkward, threading his way across the room while attached to another person. Like dragging a rather large piece of luggage that kept trying to go in the opposite direction.
“Right, so I think Shakespeare’s probably up near the front,” Harry said hurriedly, brushing past Malfoy and nearly running towards the end of the row.
“Nothing,” the other boy insisted, flushing slightly and standing up abruptly from the table. “I need a break. I’m going to take a turn around the shelves, see if there are any useful books that we missed.”
Malfoy’s jaw clenched and his shoulders seemed to tighten, throwing Harry’s insides into a nervous turmoil as he quickly went back, trying to smooth over his words. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that. What I wanted to say was I’m so glad that we got this second chance, you know, to try this again.”
“Your introduction to Muggle music could have been far worse,” Harry agreed, smiling at the gleam that had entered Malfoy’s eyes at the mention of the band.
But even the knowledge that the Gryffindor was simply playing a part didn’t stop Draco from getting a small buzz of satisfaction from hearing that he had flatly turned down the Creevey boy. Yes, providing an excuse for Harry’s admirers had been the plan all along, but that still didn’t change the fact that Draco’s traitorous heart seemed to beat a little faster at the news.
Dragging his wavering attention back to the game, Draco examined his hand. They were on the third draw and it still wasn’t shaping up to be anything good. He shook his head. “Fold.”
Harry was so startled that he nearly dropped the trunk on Ron’s foot. “What, no, why would you say that?”
“You know I don’t care much for Christmas, Auntie. Although there was an infestation of mistletoe around here yesterday,” Malfoy said, pointedly not looking at Harry, who felt his stomach turn over with nerves.
“Hmph.” Draco sniffed as he awkwardly shuffled in between Potter and Granger, who did not spare another glance up from her reading material to acknowledge his presence.
The bus roared through London and out into the countryside. Harry looked out his clouded window eagerly. It had been ages since he had been on Muggle transport of any kind, as he usually just Apparated or Flooed places. It was rather soothing to be able to see the space being traversed instead of simply jumping from one place to another in the blink of an eye.
“Finally!” Draco said dramatically, standing up to take the package from Harry’s hands. “The suspense has been killing me!”
“Not quite sure myself,” Harry admitted, groaning. “She was just standing there, crying and asking why I didn’t love her? And it popped out of my mouth and she stopped.”
Malfoy was fumbling as much as he was, a bright pink streaked across his pale face as he pointed towards the cash register, where a small bundle of leaves was attached to the side. “Mistletoe,” he stammered. “I just— I saw it and I— it just happened— because I remembered the ones at Hogwarts and how they’d trap two people, so I figured I’d just do it, but of course it’s Muggle, so it wouldn’t, but I—”
“Sorry, Ron, I dunno. It looks to me like you’re doing all the preparatory steps right,” Harry said sympathetically, scooping up the Quaffle and attempting to dust off a portion of the surface.
“I might have killed people,” Malfoy whispered, looking up at Harry with terrified eyes, the thought obviously having haunted him long before tonight.
“What the fuck is going on, Potter?” Malfoy demanded, standing in front of Harry’s desk, eyes burning.
Malfoy caught hold of his arm, causing Harry to turn back towards him. “Goddammit, Potter, what happened to your hand?”
“Welcome to the madness, Malfoy,” George said, appearing suddenly beside Ron. “Harry should have told you to run while you still had a chance.”
Harry fixedly ignored him, watching as the Ravenclaw chasers flew down the field towards the Hufflepuff goal posts in a blur of blue, tossing the bright Quaffle expertly between them. Half of the crowd roared its support as they circled around the goal posts and tossed the ball just past the Hufflepuff keeper’s fingertips.
“Ron! Harry! It’s gift time!” Hermione called up the stairs, voice echoing against the rounded stone walls.
He sighed. It was colder here, a harsh breeze whipping down the quiet street lined with small houses crammed tightly side by side like they were huddling together for warmth. The bright red door on Ron and Hermione’s house blared cheerily, tucked between the gray clouded sky and dark pavement.
“Oh, Godric, I’d forgotten about those,” Harry groaned, putting his face in his hands. “I’m sure the Ministry will be sending me a list of events any day now.” Dinners and parties where Harry would be expected to put on a nice pair of robes, smile, not drink too much, and say a short, sickeningly pleasant speech about all the fine work the Ministry had done in the past year to help the poor and the rich and the sick and the healthy. Where he would be expected to smile benevolently and say everything was going to be alright, when he barely knew if he was alright.
Potter faltered, before smartly giving up on any more pretensive small talk. Instead, he got out a battered quill and a stained inkwell, setting them beside his textbook.
“Damn,” he muttered. There was barely any left, only a splash of the perfume wetting the insides of the glass.
“How about Quidditch?” Ginny asked, the competitive light still burning in her eyes. “You used to play at school, yeah?”
“I think I’ll do a focus on seasonal weather charms,” Hermione said, eyes far off as she thought aloud. “You know, do a bit on one spell that corresponds best to the weather from each season.”
They both lay there, catching their breath and watching as it hung in smoky clouds above their faces. The snow had stopped and the clouds were slowly drifting away, allowing gaping swathes of stars to peer through.
“We would have spent the rest of our lives casually hating each other from afar,” Harry said, something aching inside of him at the thought that he always would have thought Draco Malfoy was a slimy git if not for sheer dumb coincidence. If he wasn’t harassed by the crowd. If he hadn’t gone to his friends’ house. If Hermione didn’t read the
“No, Teddy, we’re visiting Uncle Draco, not Harry,” another voice corrected gently, an older woman with greying platinum hair taking hold of the child’s hand.
Malfoy studied him for a moment, an unidentifiable look in his eyes. “I suppose we should go in so I can show you to your room.”
O’Leary seemed touched. “Well, if Mr. Porter would really like to, O’Leary would very much appreciate that, yes he would.”
A thin coat of anxiety started to creep over Malfoy’s features as Harry remained silent. “Sorry, I thought-”
“Of course! Mr. Porter is welcome to help himself to anything in the closet there,” O’Leary said, pointing towards the shuttered doors on the side of the foyer opposite to the coat stand.
But instead of a menacing flying ball, a small box was tilted against one of the Hufflepuff’s benches, having been just dropped by Draco’s eagle owl, who was swooping around the package in circles, eyeing Draco vengefully for being in the way of its drop-off.
“That was pretty clever,” Malfoy admitted, chest heaving as he fought to breathe in the cold winter air. “Very Slytherin of you.”
“I’ll be right back,” Harry whispered to Draco, reluctantly pulling away from his warm embrace. “I should get him some water or he might start saying he’s Merlin by the end of the night.”
Sending a snowball flying out from one side of his crumbling wall and tucking another one into his palm, Harry stepped out from behind the other side, pretending to stumble, falling to his knee with a howl of false pain.
“Well, at least mine weren’t murderers who tortured countless other people,” he said in a low voice that still carried across the room.
He was reminded of this as he continued with his task, lifting clumps of snow with a shovel that now he was considerably taller than, which was a nice change.
“That was from your future self, who will hate me if I don’t make you get off your ass and go to class to keep your bloody pureblood reputation intact,” she explained wearily, rolling her eyes.
The bench space Malfoy had seen was open at the very end of the row of course and Harry wasn’t sure if the other occupants Malfoy had smashed into on the way would let them out at the end of the match.
“Alright,” Harry said, getting up from his chair and following Malfoy down the stairs. “But I am putting this memory in a Pensieve and watching it every day for the rest of my life: Draco Malfoy finally caves to the holiday spirit and gets a Christmas tree!”
Draco was a surprisingly good sport about the whole thing. Sure, he couldn’t help a bit of grumbling when they were going out for the fourth night in a row, but for the most part, he patiently stood by Harry’s side, using the infamous Malfoy charm to try to brighten otherwise dreadfully dull small talk with various Ministry officials and prestigious wizarding families, of which Harry knew nothing of, causing him to cling desperately to Draco’s expertise. And he loved him all the more for it.
Surprisingly, it was Malfoy who had made these many recent awkward moments even slightly bearable. While Ron and Hermione stared into each other’s eyes, he and Harry would talk about class or Quidditch, his presence preventing Harry from constantly playing the third wheel.
Harry shrugged. “When it used to storm at school, Ron, Hermione, and I would get together and play board games until lights out to take our minds off of it. The whole Gryffindor common room would join in sometimes and it became sort of a tradition.”
“Well, I think we’ve been pretending to date for long enough and if we break up on the first day of next term, I should be safe from propositions until the end of the year,” he choked out, focusing on picking up pillows off of the floor and placing them back onto their respective couches and chairs.
“Thanks,” Malfoy’s eyes glittered with amusement. He stepped out from the door, once again placing a hand on the knob. “Right, well, as I was going to say before you, erm,
“You know, it takes quite a lot of time to transfigure presents for all the children in the world, and don’t even get me started on the portkeys for the elves.” Malfoy shuddered. “It must be an absolute nightmare.”
“I’m sorry,” the barista interrupted, looking terribly confused by what Malfoy was saying, but also very apologetic. “It’s actually not mistletoe. It’s a sample of the herbs that are in a new tea that we’re working on promoting.”
“How flattering,” Malfoy said drily. “I always wanted to inspire insanity in someone. Very romantic.”
Draco saw Potter’s fists tightened, the gesture half hidden in his robes, unlike the clear defiance that lit his eyes as he opened his mouth, no doubt to issue something scathing retort.
Ron offered a gentlemanly arm and Hermione took it and Harry trailed behind them as they slowly made their way down through the castle to the front doors, murmuring so quietly to each other that their words were unintelligible, something that Harry was rather grateful for. Just because he wanted his friends to be happy together didn’t mean that he wanted to be directly privy to all of that happiness.
“Harry’s had another run-in,” Ron said knowingly, sitting on Harry’s other side. “And it messed up his first snow.”
“It’s fine,” Malfoy said in that strange, deliberately polite voice that Harry hated. “I can make you some eggs if you’d like and there’s coffee in the pot.”
She read it over, frizzy curls falling over her face as she mumbled a few of the words out loud. “It’s not bad; just maybe spend more time on the Wizengamot trial,” she suggested, handing it back to him.
“Well, I think that’s lovely,” Harry said enthusiastically, still trying to make up for whatever he had done earlier to make Malfoy storm off.
“I suppose I could. Wouldn’t want the golden boy getting lost, I supposed.” Malfoy shrugged, but Harry could see that he seemed to brighten despite himself. “I’ll go get my coat.”
However, an unexpected wrench got thrown in that expectation, as Malfoy came into the room, also holding a book, and cautiously seating himself on the other couch across from the one Harry was frequenting.
See! Y’all had nothing to fear! Did you really think I would build this all up for fourteen chapters, only to have them waste away in misery for the rest of their days? Hehe. I actually have done that before, so never mind! The important thing is I did deliver a happy ending! One which I hope you all enjoyed as much as I did. Harry and Draco deserved it, so thank Merlin for Pansy! Please let me know if you liked it down in the comments below or if you thought I should have opted for an angstier, sad ending! I’d love to know what you all think!
“Ron,” Potter said warningly, glancing around to see if anyone had caught their exchange. “Please. Just a few weeks.”
“I’m just being honest! I don’t know what Harry sees in her!” Draco silently agreed, the scent of treacle tart only growing stronger by the minute.
“Sorry, I was playing chess with Ron and lost track of the time,” he said apologetically, running an absent-minded hand through his hair as he dumped his own textbooks onto the table.
He swallowed his mouthful quickly, inwardly cursing himself. “Of course,” he nodded, making a mental note to go to the library later and get started on his twelve inches of Transfiguration. It was so like Potter to get him into trouble, even without him actually being involved. And Draco didn’t even get the small compensation of getting to serve detention with Potter, where he could unabashedly stare at him without interruption and with a ready-made excuse.
In an instant, he was standing in the street in front of Ron and Hermione’s house. The quiet was deafening, the memory of the roaring reporters ringing in his ears as he sucked in a deep breath. Fives years after Voldemort’s downfall and it still felt like the first time he had walked into the Leaky Cauldron after the Battle of Hogwarts: people asking him for autographs, the press firing questions as fast as they snapped pictures, a general hungry look on everyone’s faces. They all wanted something from him. Fame, money, hope, comfort.
“I’ll help you clear up, Harry,” Ron said, tugging off his helmet and running a hand through his sweat-dampened hair.
,” Potter said, sounding as though he were savouring the word, and sending a strange lightness through Draco in the process. He felt snow-chilled fingers find his own, the touch so familiar, and yet seemingly different now than before.
Harry sighed, falling forward to rest his head on Draco’s shoulder, letting his tie slip out of his hand onto the floor. Draco’s arms slid around his back as Harry spoke against his collar.
I really enjoyed reading all of your guesses as to what Draco’s secret was and I hope that it did not disappoint, although I for one think that some of your guesses were better than my planned one!
“Well, now they are also going to be under the impression that we’ve been in a secret relationship for Salazar knows how long!”
“Yes, three sets for each of us,” Malfoy said, slipping out of his polished leather shoes and stepping up onto the circular stand.
Harry was struck dumb for a moment by the thought of Lucius Malfoy reading out children’s stories with different voices for each character.
Draco dragged a breath in, the air getting stuck in his throat, but he managed to drop one last pair of words at Harry’s feet, before he turned on his heel and fled.
Draco laughed quietly into Harry’s hair. “Is that all? You’re sick of Weasel and Granger being idiots about each other?”
The only sound in the room was that of parchment being readied and the scritch of quills adding headings to the soon to follow notes as Professor Snape took a small cast iron cauldron out from behind his desk. The air above it shimmered, indicating that a magical seal had been placed over top of the cauldron, although why, Draco wasn’t sure. He also wasn’t sure why Potter hadn’t arrived at class yet. Snape was sure to dock points from Gryffindor for his tardiness. Perhaps he was too busy snogging that Cho girl to bother with something as trivial as his education. Draco hurriedly pushed the thought away, reminding himself stubbornly that he had decided that he wasn’t going to care anymore and focused his attention onto his professor and head of house beginning the lesson at the front of the room.
Draco nodded cordially as he sat down on one of the chairs ringing the cramped table, taking off his robe and draping it over the back. “Evening. I’m sure you’ve met before, but as a proper introduction, this is my friend, Miss Pansy Parkinson.”
Harry had always loved the idea of carolers, however Mr. Dursley thought anyone who walked around singing for strangers was a bit wrong in the head, so he insisted no one answer the door whenever they came around 4 Privet Drive, not wanting to encouraging their abnormal behaviour. But Harry had always tried to sneak away to a window, so he could watch as the merry group of people continued their way down the street, stopping at houses and bringing a bit of the holiday spirit to folks in their homes.
In which Harry is distracted, Draco is distracted, and they do something about that distraction. It's just a lot of distraction. But at least it's disclaimed.
“Not now, Malfoy,” Potter said exasperatedly. “I meant how you’ve been so oddly quiet for the past couple days.”
“Fine.” Harry quickly showed him how to dust the counter with flour so the dough wouldn’t stick, and then how to carefully roll it out so it was just the right thickness.
Harry stood in the dining room, eyes fixated on the table. But his head was somewhere else entirely, replaying those few seconds in the coffee shop over and over until they were blurry, as he picked them apart. How could something so insignificant as the slight brushing of skin change how he saw someone he’d known for more than half of his life?
“I just . . . I don’t want to embarrass you or make things awkward,” Malfoy admitted quietly. “These people are your family and . . . I don’t exactly have the best past with them. I would hate to ruin Christmas for you, not when it means so much to you.”
A faint murmuring had gone through the class at the potion’s name, something which even Snape could not quell. The potion was infamous enough that even Crabbe and Goyle leaned forward in their seats. Although he did not let it show, Draco felt a prick of interest himself. After all, it was not every day that you learned about what some said was the most dangerous potion in existence.
Harry hadn’t realized how big a part of his day Draco was until he was gone. He missed eating meals with him and tossing light-hearted insults back and forth in conversation. He missed meeting Draco’s eye in their joint classes whenever the teacher said something unintentionally suggestive, each of them biting back laughter, the effort only made worse by looking at the other and knowing that they were thinking the exact same thing. And he missed what he thought had at times been casual affection, like when Draco had bent forward to run a hand through his hair during Exploding Snap or Harry had leaned into his side while they watched the others skate on the frozen lake during break.
Harry and Malfoy stood there for the better portion of an hour, as O’Leary laboriously inspected each tree to his satisfaction, muttering to himself as he made notes on the various faults and advantages of each one.
But when Malfoy reached Harry’s side, he simply stood there, staring down at him, face so impassive that Harry didn’t have a clue what was going through his head. Harry thought about getting out his wand in case Malfoy was going to hex him, when the Slytherin suddenly knelt down beside him and placed a soft, hesitant kiss on Harry’s lips.
Harry rooted around one of the snow-laden trees at the edge of the garden, eventually pulling out a grubby little gnome that began hollering as soon as he grabbed it.
O’Leary noticed him standing watch by the window, coming over and saying kindly, “Mr. Malfoy is fine.”
Inside was a small green bottle and a note from his mother reminding him not to study too hard if it was compromising his beauty rest.
When Harry’s alarm charm went off the next morning, he was very tempted to dispel it and go back to sleep, still tired from his friends’ “rescue” last night.
Panicked, Harry cut himself off, not even daring to think it. He quickly slipped away from Malfoy, and dashed up to his dormitory, where Ron was still sound asleep.
You know the drill: kudos and/or comments bring me happiness akin to crushing on James Potter, burgundy lipstick, and vegan mushroom fajitas! <3
They tramped out into the side yard, Harry taking the side by the road and Malfoy taking the one near the forest, with roughly twenty feet of space between them.
O’Leary thanked Malfoy, but Harry noticed that the elf eyed the cookies suspiciously, evidently not trusting his employer’s baking skills. And likely rightly so.
At least he hadn’t brought Crabbe and Goyle along, figuring that the prospect of learning a new card game may be too difficult for them when they already had trouble with the wizarding ones.
“You just said you’re not going to bring Potter to the party tomorrow!” She raised one perfectly groomed eyebrow.
“I assume this will do for Granger’s gift?” He asked with a smirk, nodding towards a small bookstore tucked on the corner of the street.
an invalid!” Draco said huffily, curling up at one end of the couch. “And if it was really so bad, why didn’t you just
“This is amazing,” he told Malfoy, who simply smirked, the expression still the same despite the different face.
Draco pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s jaw as he pulled back, settling in against Harry’s side once more. “Well, I guess I could tell you a story then.”
Heart pounding oddly loud in his ears, Draco leaned in and brushed a delicate whisper of a kiss across Potter’s chapped mouth. Their lips barely even grazed, the contact so brief their eyes didn’t even have time to close, but it felt so sweet it almost hurt, panging through Draco’s chest.
“Nice miss, Malfoy,” Potter gloated, not noticing his trapped neck-wrap and stepping towards the bleachers, only to be tugged back. “Clever,” he admitted, yanking off his scarf and abandoning it on the pitch, like a woolly snake.
Finally they reached the section of the Gryffindor table occupied by Potter’s friends. Oddly enough, their reactions were quite subdued compared to the rest of the student body. Weasley looked slightly nauseous as he caught sight of their interlaced fingers and Granger glanced up briefly from her thick textbook, before re-immersing herself in the stained pages.
It was dark outside, with only a sliver of moon shining through the window. He cast a Tempus charm and groaned. It was six a.m.
But before he could decide, Malfoy simply nodded. A single movement of his chin, and then he was gone, disappearing into the living room without a word.
And secondly, thank you to everyone for reading, kudoing, and commenting! Your support means so much to me and I love hearing your thoughts and chatting with you, so thank you so much!
Harry felt a familiar tightening in his gut at Malfoy’s words, feeling as though he were sixteen again, trading insults with him in the hallways of Hogwarts. “Well you have trouble simply standing in one place, so I wouldn’t sound so disdainful if I were you.”
Harry stepped out of the Floo, a bit dizzy, but began grinning when he saw the welcoming faces around him, most of them spattered in freckles.
“Please, Potter, Malfoys are made of sterner stuff than— than— achoo!” Malfoy interrupted himself with a startling delicate sneeze. “Damn it,” he said crossly.
“Morning all, apologies for my tardiness,” Malfoy said, finally arriving at the table in a sweep of black robes and spicy cologne.
Ron growled. “Well, obviously not or I’d be making the saves! I was able to do it a lot more easily on an actual broom. Hey, can you schedule an extra team practice for this Saturday so I can practice with the Chasers?”
They stopped at the end of the pitch, looking out at the long expanse. Draco had never seen it like this, entirely covered in pristine, unmarked white, the snow sparkling under the slivers of moonlight that stole past the dark clouds. It was breath-taking.
“By Malfoy!” Ron groaned dramatically, flinging an arm over his face and holding onto one of the hallway’s walls for support.
“Hold out your hand,” Malfoy ordered, tipping the bag over top of his own palm. Something silvery fell out, coating his pale skin.
“Please keep going, Harry,” Draco asked, obviously thinking that Harry had stopped talking because he was fed up with his interruptions. “I won’t make another peep, I swear. If I do, I won’t kiss you for a month.”
“Sweet Salazar,” he groaned. “Potter, I swear, I did not plan this. I have no idea why there is charmed mistletoe in my house, I promise you.”
“I mean, she hasn’t gotten me anything since the split either,” he continued, breath puffing out in clouds in front of him. “But I think getting her something would be nice.”
“It’s for your car,” Harry said quietly, blushing brightly. “You seemed to like Queen and I wasn’t sure what CDs of theirs you had, so I got you one with the biggest hits, to cover your bases. It’s not much, but I thought you might play it every once and awhile, you know, when you get tired of your other CDs and have nothing else to listen to.”
Harry ducked his head, awkwardly running a hand through his hair. “Well, yeah, but that was nothing compared to what your family has—”
But what Harry had not counted on was how fluttery his stomach got at the sight of Malfoy in his tailored silk pajamas, with his normally relentlessly-styled hair standing up in a tousled shock of bedhead. He had somehow not realized how he was going to have to sit beside a deliciously disheveled Malfoy, eyelids still heavy from sleep, and focus on opening gifts at the same time. The task seemed too much.
“Well, you might want to save some room for this.” And with that, Malfoy slid a small vial of murky liquid across the table towards him.
“Right, well you’ll catch on to skating again pretty soon.” Malfoy swooped around him in one last spiral, stopping beside him in a spray of ice and taking firm hold of his hand. “We’ll start slow.”
Kissing Potter conjured the same heated spark he felt when they fought. Only instead of being fueled by pointed remarks and clever jabs, it was lit by coaxing touches and soft skin and the startling addictive smell of Potter’s cheap soap. Each brush of lips felt as though it left scars in its wake and Draco finally admitted that he didn’t want it to end. But one thing needed to be set straight.
“Malfoy?” Harry wasn’t even sure what he was asking, shock short-circuiting his brain as he tried to process what had just happened.
They slowly went down the stairs, wands at the ready as they came into the living room. Harry looked around frantically for the intruder. Movement flashed in the corner of his eye and he swung around, shouting, “Stupefy!”
“Why are we like this?” Harry gasped, still shaking. “We fight and struggle and mess things up so fucking badly and oh Merlin, I love you!”
“Not as nice as yours. They look like swatches of moonlight.” Potter’s tone was lower than usual, his dirt-common accent suddenly turning lethal and caressing each syllable.
Pansy dashed butterfly kisses on either side of his face, returning to rites of farewell that were more customarily Pureblood. “You won’t really miss me though,” she said, soft smile suddenly turning wicked to match her twinkling eyes. “Because I know that you’re really just staying back so you can spend more time with your boyfriend.”
Legs numb from hanging down from a broom for so long, Harry landed, setting his broom on the snowy ground while he took a moment to warm his frozen hands, shoving them in his pockets to curl around the heated enchanted stones that . . . that Draco had given him.
They ran all the way there and arrived at the community center just in time, slowing their pace to catch their breath as they stopped in front of the sign-up table.
Harry charmed together some strings of lumoses, while Malfoy transfigured an abandoned tea mug into a star for the top. O’Leary continued to create ornament charms, conjuring bulbs in green, silver, and gold, to go along with the red ones he had already placed.
Christmas is the perfect time to be cold and share clothing. Character A either lends B something, or they both end up sharing one item.
“This is strange, isn’t it?” He said quietly, leaning in close to Malfoy’s side so he could hear him over the passersby.
“I’m fine!” He snapped, shaking her off, even more furious with himself. “I-I’ll be fine. Thank you,” he added more softly, seeing the hurt expression in his friend’s eyes.
Just by reading the snow shoveling scene, you can tell I'm Canadian, although I've lived in too many houses with long driveways to enjoy it the way Harry does. A bit of shoveling, either with music or someone to talk to or at night with your thoughts, that's nice, but hours of back-breaking work where your nose, ears, and toes are cold, but the rest of you is warm? No thank you!
Still consumed by doubt, Draco decisively moved one of his remaining pawns, immediately regretting the move as a look of barely concealed glee came over Weasley’s face as he considered his next move.
The whole thing made Harry’s head pound in time to the constant swirl of nausea in his stomach and he gripped the worn handle of his broom tightly as it all swept through him.
. And he loved him. He hated that he had done this to him, made him so fragile that he could be torn down so easily. He didn’t even know if Harry meant what he was saying or if it was just another fucking act. Draco didn’t even know what was real anymore.
He couldn’t go anywhere in wizard England without being swarmed by press and fans. He didn’t know why he had thought today would be different. How he had deluded himself into thinking somehow he would be able to walk through Diagon Alley doing his Christmas shopping just like any other bloke.
“Calm down; it’s just some light Christmas themed hazing,” George assured him, gesturing for them to follow him out into the garden. “You know Mum needs to gauge a person’s work ethic before letting them waltz into the family. You had to de-gnome the garden when you first got here. Take it as a compliment. She must think that Malfoy’s going to be sticking around for awhile and wants to make sure he’s worthy of you.”
Harry yawned widely, nearly tripping down the stairs. Ron grabbed his arm, holding him upright until he got back his balance.
“What? Do you even hear yourself right now?” He demanded exasperatedly, thankful that it was early enough that the common room was still deserted. The rest of the house did not need to play audience to two of their tiffs in the same week.
Draco tried to slow down his steps, but every time he did, he would get caught up in his thoughts again and remember that he was going to meet Potter at the Great Hall, where he would be expected to hold his hand and look at him like he hung the sun in the sky.
He rolled his eyes in agreement, opening the door for her, only to see a frozen huddle of Slytherins standing outside.
Malfoy tugged him up to his feet, the sudden motion causing Harry’s vision to swim for a moment before steadying again as he took in his surroundings. They were standing in front of a large, ash-streaked fire place, situated along a wall in an oddly bare room. There were no furnishings, only a few rusted nails and hooks dotting the stained walls. The air was absolutely freezing and each of their breaths hung like smoke long after they had issued it.
Harry watched as the house elf wandered through the forest, peering at each tree carefully, measuring height and width, and examining the colouration of the needles with the seriousness of a doctor preparing to make a diagnosis. O’Leary had obviously been preparing for this moment for a very long time.
“I was hoping you might say that,” Malfoy grinned devilishly. “So, Potter, time for you to finally spit it out: what’s my Christmas present?”
“Not even on my death bed,” Malfoy said firmly, leaning over and pressing a soft kiss to Harry’s cheek in an unspoken thank you. “Alright, now it’s your turn: truth or dare?”
“Thank you.” Harry stepped up to the counter, smiling as he realized it was the same barista from the market stall. “Hi there, I would like to order a—”
As always, kudos and comments are appreciated! I love hearing what you think about Harry and Draco’s escapades and look forward to hearing what you think about what’s to come!
Harry joined the rest of the contestants in cheering, while Malfoy peered suspiciously at their ‘competition’.
Draco noted his anxiety, filing it away to be examined at a later time. Apparently Gryffindors were just as bad at lying as he’d always heard.
“Oh, you don’t, do you?” Malfoy laughed, a jagged, disbelieving sound. “You don’t remember the trial where my family was forced to literally pay for our crimes?”
A smile flickered at the corner of George’s mouth, before he remembered his role. “Ahem! As most of you may recall, the way to rid the field of this enemy is by picking him up and flinging him over the fence as far as possible. We begin the attack in three, two, one!”
“Now I’m actually glad that my parents are spending the holidays alone in France,” Draco remarked drily, noting his friends’ struggle. “Otherwise I’d have had to leave my own bags behind in favour of helping you carry yours.”
O’Leary made him a delicious tomato soup for lunch, the deep crimson colour wonderfully festive, and Harry carefully balanced the bowl on his lap while he finished his book, stretched out contentedly as the afternoon sun sprawled across him on the sofa.
Later that day, Harry heard a curious clattering sound coming from his room. Tiptoeing up the stairs with his wand out, ready to call for Malfoy and O’Leary, he rushed into his room, sweeping his wand around as he searched frantically for the intruder.
Seven minutes later, they dashed out the door, Malfoy grumbling about the state of his hair and how “I had time for one last charm, Potter, sweet Salazar!”
Completely giving up any remaining pretense that he was reading, Harry watched with amusement as Malfoy continued to rail at the characters, telling them in great detail exactly what mistakes they were making, as if they were sentient beings asking for his advice.
“Just ask about school,” Ron muttered to himself, wiping his palms on his pants anxiously. “Ask about school. Okay, thanks Harry. I’ll be down in a minute.”
“Well,” Draco coughed pointedly. “We better get on with this. Do you have any semblance of a plan or do you just want to go in there and play it by ear?”
“Is there something on my face?” He asked self-consciously, putting a hand up to finally straighten his glasses.
Ron, who had made his way over to the rest of them and was idly tossing the Quaffle back and forth between his two hands, dropped it at Malfoy’s words and made a sort of choking noise. At first, it appeared that Hermione had a far more composed reaction, but when Harry glanced over, he saw that she was blushed furiously behind her book, which she had lifted up to directly cover her face.
“So glad we got to talk,” Draco said smoothly, nodding politely as he steered Harry away quick enough that he got out of having to shake the man’s hand himself. “Oh, thank Merlin, love, good save back there.”
Between the four of them, the garden was cleared out in the minutes, the gnomes nothing more than dizzily wobbling specks in the distance.
“I’ll go get you boys some drinks!” She chirped, skipping away back into the jostling crowd before either of them had a chance to protest.
“I can’t believe you made me denounce Christmas drinks!” Harry mourned, slumping against Malfoy’s side.
Next Draco slicked a generous amount of Sleakeazy’s through his platinum blond locks until each strand was coiffed perfectly in place. None of the deliberately bed-mussed style that Potter seemed to favour. Honestly, some days Draco could barely stand the Gryffindor’s disheveled head of hair. It was so infuriating that it made Draco just want to go up to Potter and . . . and do something! What exactly he wasn’t quite sure as he never let himself dwell on the thought of touching Potter’s hair for long. It made his insides twinge uncomfortably. With rage, Draco told himself uncertainly.
“I’m so sorry about that,” Harry said as soon as his head stopped ringing. “The Weasleys are like family to me, so they’re just really protective.
Another yawn dragged out of him as he struggled to keep his eyes open and focus on the ground below him, not wanting to fall off his broom mere weeks before Quidditch trials for the new Gryffindor team that he was supposed to be captaining. Although it would be fitting, seeing as that was why he was out flying at dawn in the first place. So he could be a good example for the rest of his new team. Besides, he reminded himself, Merlin knew he could use the practice after being stuck at the Dursleys all summer. He hadn’t been able to take out his broom once and he could admit that his skills had definitely suffered. He didn’t want Gryffindor getting soundly beaten by Slytherin because he had failed to prepare enough. And he definitely didn’t want to have Malfoy gloat about it for months on end, as he undoubtedly would. A sneer or knowing smirk would come over the pale boy’s features whenever Harry came anywhere near him and this time there would actually be a reason for Malfoy’s mocking expressions. It would make him want to march over to Malfoy and . . . and do something! Something to distract him from Harry’s failings. Like kis—
But as the evening went on, Harry’s anger began to fade, as snow began blowing down from a darkly clouded sky, Malfoy still not back. The flakes started falling faster and more heavily, until Harry peered out from the window to see a full-blown blizzard raging.
Malfoy went even pinker, the sight doing strange things to Harry’s stomach, which was still twisting with adrenaline after what had just happened.
“The first snow was bloody ruined for me!” He shouted, kicking off his shoes and coming into the cozy living room. Ron looked up in surprise from a chess board.
“No, the barn was too good for me, so I just got the cupboard instead,” Harry snapped back, annoyed by Malfoy’s condescension and that fact that even when he was being a complete git, Harry still wanted to run his hands through his obnoxiously perfect hair.
Malfoy grabbed his hand, holding it tightly. “It’s alright. It doesn’t matter what other people say.”
As soon as Draco entered the room, Pansy shot through the crowd and flung her arms around him. He stumbled at her sudden weight and Potter pressed a hand to his back to steady him, just like he had at the Quidditch match. Apparently Potter’s hero complex, when translated into an every day setting, simply became focused on preventing people from falling on their asses. How helpful.
Harry nodded his agreement. The edges of his eyebrows still hadn’t grown back after their last match and Malfoy kept commenting on it. Said that the sharp angles clashed with his lightening scar, whatever that was supposed to mean.
Draco stepped up to the door, eyes trailing over the ornate carvings etched across the age-darkened wood. “Coming, Potter?”
“Is that a good enough explanation?” Malfoy quirked a thin eyebrow, a surprisingly tentative smile stealing onto his face. One that was far more real than the generic polite one he had bestowed on Madame Malkin. One that tied Harry’s insides into even more complex knots.
Moments later he reappeared, Malfoy only steps behind him. Job done, the first-year fled, racing down the corridor, robes billowing in his wake.
Harry inched around Susan, hoping that the Slytherins would notice the movement, but they continued walking down the hall, away from Harry and the tearful Hufflepuff.
Now Harry felt certain that he too was reddening, as he hurriedly shoved the thought away. It had to be a side affect of breathing in so much cologne. Surely such amounts couldn’t be good for one’s health!
“Uncle Draco, play the piano!” Teddy said, tugging on Malfoy’s pantleg insistently and pointing towards the large instrument.
At least the press had settled down somewhat by this point. When they had first been spotted holding hands at a Puddlemere United match, all the papers had a field day with headings about the Chosen One allowing a Malfoy to Slytherin-to his bed. But once everyone had come to terms with the fact that Draco had no intention of going anywhere except wherever Harry went, the wizarding world had begrudgingly gotten used to seeing the two young men arm and arm on the cover of the Daily Prophet.
Now it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “Don’t exaggerate, Malfoy. There were only five other students, not the whole school.”
“Right,” Draco murmured against his mouth, the reassuring thought quelling his nerves. “Just hormones.”
She flashed a wink back at him before he could protest, pulling herself up into the carriage. “Happy holidays, Draco, love!”
“And now there’s some place proper to put Andromeda’s gift,” Malfoy said, taking the wrapped package down from the shelf where it had been kept, now nudging it under the tree. He looked over hopefully at Harry. “And perhaps it will be joined by a sibling—"
Harry fidgeted, tapping his feet against the ground while his eyes remained fixated on the clock hung above the mantle in the Gryffindor common room. This was a state he had been in for the entire evening and it was a testament to how enthralled Ron and Hermione were with each other that neither of them had noticed his strange behaviour.
“I haven’t actually played since school,” Malfoy admitted, meeting Harry’s eyes straight on for the first time since he had sat down.
“Well, that’s what the date is for!” She explained, still grinning. “To get to know each other better! Harry, I think we would be perfect together! Just wait and see!”
“Of course, Harry,” Hermione said, reaching up to give him a hug. “Although Malfoy really does seem like a different person.”
“Today we will be studying one of the most powerful potions to exist,” Snape said, voice impossibly measured. His tone never changed, whether he was describing how to change one's hair colour or stop death itself. “It is so powerful that the Ministry has deemed it dangerous and has made it illegal to use.”
“I don’t know what is going on,” Malfoy said, now focused on getting rid of the mistletoe. “I don’t think this stuff just appears out of nowhere.”
Harry woke up with a crick in his neck and a red imprint on his face from his glasses. He had fallen asleep moments after he had tumbled into bed yesterday, exhausted from the events of the day, and now his mouth was uncomfortably dry.
“What?” Harry asked, voice loud with surprise. Nearby students hushed him, including Hermione, who was seated three rows in front of them, separated because she had wanted to be closer to the front of the class than Harry and Ron were comfortable with. He mouthed his apologies at them, before turning back to Ron. “What do you mean?”
By the end of a half hour, the tree was glittering with spelled decorations, reminding Harry of the Christmas trees that had filled the Great Hall during the holidays at Hogwarts.
Nearly choking on the aftertaste of the endearment, Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm, pulling him away before he could protest, leaving Susan and the group of Slytherins behind with stunned expressions plastered across their faces. Tugging Malfoy behind him, he ducked into an unoccupied classroom, checking that Peeves wasn’t there, before sinking behind one of the desks.
, I brought you here— well, really, I didn’t particularly want to bring you here, but it was the only way that I got to come here— That is to say that, I like coming here every so often to— Well, every so often is perhaps the wrong way to put it, every Hogsmeade weekend is more accurate, because, well—”
Guilt churned through his veins as he tried to look grateful for his friend’s support. “Thank you, Pansy, that means a lot. What about you two?” He turned to Crabbe and Goyle, whose faces had remained characteristically blank and expressionless up to that point.
“What are you doing, Potter?” Malfoy asked quietly, gaze following Harry’s until he had caught it with his own.
To his surprise, Pansy said that Harry didn’t look much better than he did, moping around to classes, and slumping in his seats. Evidently, he was a better actor than Draco had thought. Perhaps some of his own aptitude at lying had rubbed off on him during . . . well, their time ‘together’.
“Pardon me, madam, but I believe we are expected by Mr. Harry Potter?” He said smoothly, summoning one of his practiced dinner party smiles.
Luckily for him, Weasley looked even more confused than he was and Draco was sure that with his natural intelligence and Slytherin cunning he could at least best the ginger Gryffindor.
“No, I’m not,” Draco said crossly. “Now give me a kiss.” He moved once again towards Harry, nearly tripping over the hem of his robe. “Damn. Where did that come from?”
Harry suppressed a groan. “I’ll be there in a minute. I have to go talk to Malfoy about the match. Try not to trip over your feet on the way to the table. Eyes on your surroundings, not Hermione.”
Draco had woken up and was gathering up his tie and button-up shirt off the chair where he had set them when he had swapped them out for Harry’s emerald H sweater, which he was still wearing. He smiled when Harry entered the room, offering a casual “Good morning” that sent pangs through Harry. He stared at him, wanting him so badly, which was the whole problem.
Malfoy’s abrupt entrance startled him, causing him to drop the quill onto the parchment, spattering ink across its formerly pristine surface.
“Mm-hmm. And this would be the same Christmas tree that you’ve been refusing to get for how long now?”
Granted, there were times when Harry would look at him and swear he saw something . . . more in the other boy’s gaze. But that was just wishful thinking to imagine that Draco would care for him like that. Their history was too tumultuous.
Ron was back to sputtering, while Hermione was gripping the edges of her book so tightly Harry thought she might actually take something back to the library in worse condition than she got it for the first time in her life.
He watched as his two best friends stepped into the fire place one by one, shouting their address aloud and disappearing in a flurry of green flames.
The afternoon passed quickly, Harry kept abreast of every mishap, romantic or otherwise, that the characters in Malfoy’s book came across, thoroughly entertained by the Slytherin’s unconscious commentary.
“Are you out of your mind? With Kriefen as seeker? The man couldn’t catch the Snitch if it were hovering motionless in front of his face!” Malfoy said emphatically, raking a hand through his copiously styled hair, making the strands stick up from his head in a manner that was so unlike Malfoy that Harry wanted to smile.
Ron sighed, finally turning to face Harry. “I’m sorry, mate, but didn’t you know this was what you were signing up for with all this fake dating stuff?”
“Why are you acting so twitchy?” Pansy asked, eyeing Draco suspiciously as he nearly ran into Goyle’s back for the third time in the past minute.
Harry Potter, Saviour of the wizarding world, Chosen One, and renowned recipient of his mother’s eyes, was frazzled.
Harry sighed. “No, Draco, you have far too much Slytherin in you for me to even contemplate such a thought. You’re cold though, so just put the bloody scarf on.”
“Yes, the time has flown quickly.” Malfoy laughed genially, a sound softer than eleven year old Harry ever would have thought when he first met him. “It feels like just yesterday that we were starting our first year, and yet so many things have changed since then.”
It was a feeling built by the heat that flooded Harry’s veins whenever he touched Malfoy. But also the steady warmth that his presence had slowly grown to have, the comfort of having him near. It was watching Malfoy laugh, how his eyes would narrow and his cheeks would get flushed. But also watching him painted cold with sadness, remembering who he was in the past and grieving for those he had hurt. It was running through the snow together, pelting each other in competition. But also curling up together and listening as he pointed out the stars. It was casually bickering, and commiserating over classwork, and glances of smiles, and witty quips. All culminating in this undeniable feeling.
“Elegant as always, Potter,” Malfoy noted drily, but Harry could have sworn that a smile flickered behind his coffee cup.
Realizing that he was the one who was going to have to keep the act going, Draco adopted his most polite conversational tone, the one he typically saved for exceptionally painful dinners at the Manor where he was expected to charm stuffy old pureblood matriarchs and dull second cousins. “So, how was your day, love?”
“Ahem, as I was saying, I know that this is a lot to take in. And I’m sorry I didn’t tell you all sooner, but Pot—, er, Harry and I wanted to keep it private for a bit because we knew it would be quite an adjustment for everyone and we didn’t want to put everyone through it if the relationship wasn’t going to work out.” Draco steeled himself for the next bit, the selling of which would be a bit trickier. “But as it is, we’ve grown to care for each other quite a lot and so we didn’t want to have to hide it anymore. Which is why we figured we would just get it over with in one go in the Great Hall.”
“This is why people don’t stay friends with their exes,” Malfoy said drily, his steps picking up the pace again for some reason.
“What? You thought what, Potter?” Malfoy demanded, leaning over the counter towards him. “You thought that we’d be fine, while you just got to waltz off to enjoy the rest of your life without worrying about whether you could make enough to survive in a world where no one would hire you because you picked the losing side.”
They began walking aimlessly down the sidewalk, neither one really going anywhere, each of them wrapped up in their own thoughts.
“Of course,” Draco said oddly stiffly, tearing off Harry’s sweater and flinging on his rumpled collared shirt with strange viciousness.
Harry settled back against his seat, feeling oddly at home in this moment that he never would have foreseen happening for multiple reasons. Yet here he was, listening to Draco Malfoy sing ‘Somebody to Love’ under his breath after confessing his complete transformation of beliefs in a startlingly yellow car.
Harry’s heart sunk, as he recognized the low voice of the rude plain coffee man. Who he’d just knocked to the ground. Brilliant. Maybe Harry had cracked his head open during the fall. He didn’t think the man would yell at him if he was dying. Well, not as much anyway.
“Thank Godric!” He mumbled, looking as though he would have kissed Draco had Pansy not been standing right there beside him.
His excitement only increased as he came to the town, following the narrow winding streets through the charming stone buildings, letting pure fancy guide him.
Wow, twenty days gone and only four chapters left! That's crazy. It honestly feels like it hasn't been a week, so that's scary as fuck.
“You have barely been able to look in me in the eye for the past few days,” Potter said fiercely, coming so close that Draco automatically reached for his wand in case he tried to punch him like Granger had in third year. But his hand closed on air. He gulped when he realized he must have left it back on the table.
“Of bloody fucking course,” Malfoy groaned, pushing locks of sodden hair out of his grey eyes. “Potter. I should have known that only you would knock someone into a lake and almost drown them only to think better of it moments later and pop down to pull them out. You probably did it on purpose, just so that you could get a chance to practice your nauseatingly heroic saving-people skills. Good thing you didn’t realize it was me ahead of time or you would have left me there to drown. You would have liked that, wouldn’t you? Finally finished me off and it looks like a perfect accident so you don’t end up rotting away in Azkaban for the rest of your life.”
If only he had never gotten into it with Malfoy. He should have just apologized about the fire and moved on without engaging and then he would be here, still freezing Harry out over the mistletoe incidents.
“Alright,” Ron agreed warily. “But if he makes so much as one wrong move, I’ll get him! Ginny’s been teaching me her Bat-Bogey hex and it works almost every time now, so I wouldn’t try anything, mister.”
Andromeda glanced between the two of them, eyes sharp with curiosity. “Sometimes it can be nice to try something new,” she said finally.
Tonight was no different. They had Flooed into the Ministry and immediately had been dragged over to do a photo-op with Minister Shacklebolt, pasting on their practiced smiles for the press. Then they had spent the next several hours making the rounds, champagne flutes in hand while they made sure to thank everyone for coming out to donate to such a worthy cause, although at this point, Harry honestly had no idea which charity was sponsoring which night. It was all one blur of sleek dress robes and polite smiles.
Harry caught a glimpse of himself in the reflection of one of the house’s darkened windows: staring back at him was a young man with curly bronze hair and blue eyes. Even though he had used Polyjuice several times before, seeing himself reflected in a completely new form was still terribly disconcerting, not to mention how strange it was to hear Malfoy’s voice coming out of another body.
Damn. “Yes, but I got inspired last night and wanted to get it all down before I remembered how tedious the subject is,” Draco hastily amended, keeping his eyes fixated on his plate so that any glimmer of a lie would be concealed.
Harry smiled at Malfoy. He studied his face for a moment before saying, “In all serious, thank you for trying to save my life.”
Harry could feel his face warming. “Er, well, I just came across something when I was in town the other day. I wasn’t even sure if I was going to give it to you, but I saw it and there it was, and I couldn’t stop thinking about you, so I got it, but now, well.” Harry gestured helplessly between the two of them, face completely on fire now.
“Find everything?” Malfoy asked, keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the salt-stained pavement in front of him.
Malfoy had uncorked his own vial and Harry was now standing beside a young man with longish black hair and olive skin, although his eyes still remained the same deep grey they naturally were.
Malfoy quelled all the mutterings with a heated glare, wand sweeping past the crowd. “Not another word. You’re all to move back this instant and we are not to be disturbed for the rest of the evening, understood?”
“Where were you? I didn’t see you at breakfast,” Harry asked worriedly, trying to look as though he were paying attention to Professor Flitwick’s instructions when all he wanted to do was turn to Draco.
“Morning, Potter,” Draco said as he sat down, slinging his polished leather book bag over the back of his chair.
“Serves him right,” Weasley said stubbornly. “It’s only fair that he has to put up with her sniveling in exchange for losing us all those points from Snape.”
So the world around Harry knew nothing of the pain that lingered still weeks after he and Draco had broken their fake relationship off.
“I was being sarcastic, idiot!” Pansy screeched, hand raised as though she would slap the next person who said something stupid.
Ron leaned up against his locker, frowning. “Did you ever talk about kissing being part of the act?”
For a brief second, he contemplated Apparating back to his London flat and forgetting about the whole thing. Being followed around and harassed everywhere he went wasn’t really that terrible after all. Not compared to staying with . . . with
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling him down into a kiss. It was slow and sweet and familiar and perfect in a way that Harry never would have imagined. And then it was fast and breathless and burning with every touch. Harry trailed his mouth down Draco’s pale neck to the edge of his collar, tearing off his green and silver striped tie so he could trace the faint lines of Draco’s collarbone. If the Prophet saw them now, he thought bitterly, the cruel comments would rain down on them harder than hail. He could practically hear the voices, edging closer and closer . . .
It wasn’t a long piece, Malfoy coming to a rest after a few minutes of effortless playing and glanced over at him.
Harry shook his head. “Just some packs of chocolate frogs. You never really know who’s going to show up for Christmas and there’s loads of them, which makes buying gifts nearly impossible. Except . . . I don’t know.” Harry paused, Malfoy watching him curiously. “I always got something for Ginny in the past, but in the years since we’ve broken up, it just feels strange. We’re still friends, but it’s a tad awkward after everything.”
He swallowed, unclenching his fists from where they had tightened at his sides. “I’m sorry. I just . . . it’s a lot. Not being able to go anywhere without people screaming and following me. I’m too afraid to apply for a job anywhere because I’ll never know whether I got it because they thought I was qualified or because I killed a guy without a nose. My entire life is picked apart on the front page every single day, which means I’m too afraid to date anyone because I don’t want to drag them into it. So I’d appreciate it if you didn’t get after me about this one thing. Not when I came out here to escape thinking about it.”
This set Harry off on another spool of laughter, but he calmed himself down when he saw the truly bewildered look on his boyfriend’s face. “It’s alright, darling. But I think it’s time we went home, before you propose marriage or something.”
“No reason,” he said hurriedly, looking down at his Parisian dragonhide shoes to ensure that he kept his steps measured.
“We should do it in the Great Hall at breakfast, so we have the largest audience possible like we did for the beginning of this,” Harry forced out, trying desperately to keep his tone casual.
“I’ll owl the house owner right now!” Hermione smiled at him in satisfaction, before disappearing into the kitchen, paper clutched in her hand.
Harry turned around, dread spreading thick through him, and saw Draco standing in the doorway, forgotten books now tucked under his arm, blonde hair swooped perfectly over his arresting gray eyes, and a Gryffindor tie knotted expertly around his neck, the bright red and gold stripes veritably demanding the room’s attention. And it received it.
“O’Leary is having a Christmas tree!” The elf hummed happily, the ends of his long knobbly maroon scarf trailing in the snow behind him.
Potter sighed, getting up from his chair. “I meant somewhere more private. I’d rather we didn’t have an audience for this.”
Reluctantly, Harry stumbled over the doorstep into what looked to be a living room, filled with squat, cozy, overstuffed furniture all gathered around a large fire place. Malfoy was standing next to the flames, tugging a small bag out of one of his coat’s pockets.
“You’re welcome,” Malfoy said quietly, eyes holding something Harry couldn’t quite decipher. And couldn’t quite look away from.
Pansy glowed triumphantly, leaping out of her chair to press a kiss to his cheek. “Great! Thank you for trying, I promise, you will not regret this!”
“Potter, no, are you mental?” Draco complained as Potter dragged him back to their table, gathering up their clocks and striped scarves. “What about our books?”
“Anyway,” Harry continued determinedly. “Because Leroy was magical, he got invited to attend a wonderful school, where the wisest wizards and witches of the land taught magical children how to properly use their powers.”
“Sorry!” She squeaked, cheeks going as pink as Harry’s cloud had been. “I didn’t mean to sneak up on you.”
Despite the feeling of Malfoy’s palm against his being more of a distraction than a help, Harry’s steps gradually began to smooth out, and soon he was gliding along at a decent pace. Instead of staring at his feet, he was able to glance over and smile at Malfoy, who smirked back in true fashion, sending a jolt of butterflies through Harry’s stomach and causing him to stumble. Still clutching onto Malfoy’s hand, Harry pulled them both crashing down onto the bank at the edge of the lake, the snow cushioning their fall.
The corridor outside the Slytherin dorms was very drafty. Harry shivered, wishing that he’d worn his scarf and winter robes. Or that Malfoy had come out to meet him at the agreed upon time. For the past half hour, numerous Slytherins had trickled out from their common room, gaping openly when they saw Harry standing across from the entrance. Curious eyes and gossipy whispers were now common traits among the members of the snake house.
Malfoy skated back towards him, looping around him in wide circles. “I come out here every couple of days as soon as the ice is solid enough. I find it rather peaceful.”
I’ve drafted novels before, but this was the first multi-chap fic that I’ve ever done and I have had so much fun writing it! I hope you all have enjoyed the journey as much as I have, because it’s really thanks to all of you for keeping me going! Thank you all so much for every comment, every kudo! I loved getting to see your reactions to these characters and this story and your predictions and hopes and everything! It’s been amazing, so thank you all so much for your support! It’s been an absolute pleasure getting to meet you all!
In which Hermione tries to be unhelpfully helpful, Draco gets a bit angsty, and Harry kisses it better.
Malfoy stared at him, an instance of shock painted across his face, before he quickly schooled his features into a pleasant smile. Harry found it quite disconcerting to be the recipient of such an expression from Malfoy.
Kudos and/or comments bring me as much joy as finding out Taylor Swift is dropping her second surprise album in five months twenty minutes before it happens!
During the conflict with Voldemort and his Death Eaters, Ministry parties had been a rare occurrence. But now that the war was over, it seemed as though Harry got an invention to events every other night. Charities, and award ceremonies, with attendance levels skyrocketing at the mere mention of the Boy Who Lived Twice making an appearance. So naturally, Harry couldn’t bring himself to refuse, not when such worthy causes were at stake, even when he’d rather spend the evening in with his boyfriend, introducing him to Muggle films and trying to best him in their long-running wizard chess tournament.
“Ha, that’s one knut Hermione,” Ron said gleefully, holding out his hand. “You totally were about to call him ‘Malfoy’.”
“Oh, well if you like, I think someone’s spiked the eggnog,” the barista said meaningfully, holding up a bottle of brandy.
Harry pasted a fake smile across his face for their audience, speaking through gritted teeth. “Because my thing is more important.”
They all turned around to see a fuming Hermione marching out of the Floo grate, a grim expression on her face.
he thought, heart pounding wildly as he half sat up, staring down at the boy – Malfoy! – that had prompted such a strange sentiment. But as he continued to look down at the still-sleeping Slytherin, blond hair sticking up in breath-taking bedhead, he realized that no, it wasn’t a mistake. Simply a feeling that had been building up for longer than he had known. Made up of a combination of many moments.
Harry picked it up with a frown, examining the contents. “Is having pond sludge for dessert a traditional wizarding ritual?”
She smiled, patting his hand. “My pleasure. Anyone who is special to our Harry is always welcome here.”
“You were missing for hours in a fucking blizzard, so I think I have the right to be bit mental!” Harry snapped, looking over Malfoy to make sure he hadn’t lost any limbs to frostbite. “I was frantic, thinking you’d finally managed to get yourself killed!”
“Are you staying here over Christmas, Harry?” Andromeda asked, setting down Malfoy’s present beside the couch.
It was tempting. To grab this taste of freedom and enjoy his holiday in peace. So many days and nights suddenly possessing opportunity instead of confinement and smiling at society and pretending to be okay. Pretending to have control over his life, instead of being tossed between strangers who thought they needed him.
As if knowing what he was thinking, Malfoy burst out, “I pay him, alright? Don’t get your noble sensibilities in a bunch.”
Torn between wanting to continue to avoid Malfoy and not wanting to make more trouble for the elf, Harry finally sighed. “Sure. That sounds great.” It wasn’t like he could avoid Malfoy for the entire trip anyway. It was
Harry groaned. “Why didn’t you suggest that then, instead of letting me struggle up all those flights?”
“You told them, didn’t you?” Draco hissed accusatorily in Potter’s ear, causing the other boy to wince.
Shoes clattering on the stone floor, he finally slumped to the ground beside a large portrait displaying an old man in a top hat drinking tea, who fled timidly from his painting the moment he saw Harry. Head pounding, Harry leaned back against the cool stone wall, gulping down the corridor’s fresh air.
Taking another sip of the creamy eggnog, Harry started out towards the house where he was staying, where he would relax, no matter what.
Weasley scowled, freckled skin scrunching across his face, but let out a testy “Fine,” and turned back to his heaping plate, stabbing his food rather viciously.
Draco wanted to smirk at the other boy’s strangled tone, but for the fact that his own stomach felt as though it were about to drop out onto the floor.
“What?” Draco stared bewilderedly at Pansy, who had suddenly erupted out of her chair by the common room fire and was now pointing an accusing finger at him.
In that same blank voice, Malfoy started to say, “How well done—” but Harry snapped, his unnatural politeness grating against his nerves.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “‘Us’.” He shuddered. “Remember your little declaration? I can’t just walk out there while the whole school is under the impression that we’ve been dating.”
When he returned with the cookies, Malfoy handed them out to the children, who responded with a chorus of “Thank you!”
“Maybe just the rules for tonight, Hermione,” Potter suggested, making his way around to his seat, squeezing behind Draco’s chair and briefly resting his hands on his shoulders for balance. The sensation of Potter’s palms sunk through Draco’s shirt, sending sparks through his skin.
He heard Malfoy sigh in exasperation. Outside, the snow was still pelting down, large flakes sticking to the window pane, nearly obscuring Harry’s view of the yard entirely. Blustering wind gusts buffeted the snow in heavy white sheets down towards the ground, the normally soft beauty of a snow fall changed to violent natural attacks.
Left in a cloud of exhaust as the bus departed, Harry began to make his way down the road towards the stout buildings of the town, boots sinking into the thick snow that coated the ground, a cheery contrast to the mucky streets in London. The sky was a brilliant, clear blue, the sun gleaming off of the crisp snow, throwing blinding sparkles into the air.
Too brightened to scowl at Pansy’s mothering, Draco accepted the tarnished goblet. His taste buds were wreaked from his cold, but the cool drink still felt soothing going down, reducing some of the pressure in his head.
Malfoy eventually found the cards on one of the book shelves, shuffling them expertly as he walked over to the table where Harry was sitting.
Abruptly, Susan’s sobs stopped. The shock painted across her face matched what Harry himself was feeling perfectly. Good Godric, he had just blatantly told her that he was dating his rival. Not only embarrassing, but completely unbelievable. Once she got over her initial shock and regained any semblance of reason, she would recognize the lie and start crying again about their lost love and he would be stuck there for ages before Ron and Hermione would come save him.
In which friendship is recognized for the precious gold that it is, snowy fun is had, and Draco and Harry start to make some realizations.
“I just don’t see the point!” Draco said insistently. “It’s the same people we see every day, who we live with for Salazar’s sake! Only now they’re all sloshed on fire whiskey and find every mundane thing hilarious or they’re bursting into tears because they heard a random song and it’s all thoroughly unpleasant!”
Potter stared at him, displaying the shock that was ricocheting through Draco’s insides. He opened his mouth to issue a hasty explanation, the substance of which he was not yet sure of himself, when Potter’s eyes suddenly lit up with understanding, his gaze flickering to the various people in their proximity.
A wave of exhaustion suddenly sweeping over him, Harry collapsed back onto the bed, staring up at the whitewashed ceiling. There was no way his vacation was going to be any kind of peaceful now.
“I don’t know where you’d get that impression, Potter,” he spat. “It’s not like you tried to kill me or anything.”
Ron and Hermione didn’t notice the full extent of his misery, assuming that he was simply taking on the appearance of moping to make the break-up seem more believable to the Hogwarts student body, which was still buzzing over the Great Hall incident. He would try to muster a smile for them in private when they would bring up light-hearted topics of conversation, not wanting them to become worried. They didn’t need to know that something panged in Harry’s chest every time he caught sight of someone with blonde hair or that he hadn’t yet washed the sweater that Draco had slept in that night they had spent on the couch because his smell still calmed Harry down, even when ironically he needed the relief because he was thinking about Draco himself.
Well. Yup. Here we are. Sorry, couldn’t make it too easy for them! Harry still is an oblivious idiot after all, even if it’s over a new thing now. At least you got some romantic fluff before it all went to shit! Wait . . . never mind . . . that just made it worse . . .
Draco came to a stop, barely suppressing the sneer that automatically began to slide over his face whenever he looked at Potter.
Grabbing his wand, he crept out into the hallway. Malfoy was already there, a frown of determination on his face, as he motioned for Harry to follow him downstairs.
He came to a stop several feet away from him, and they stared at each other. It had been so long since Harry had allowed himself to look at him and it hurt just as much as he thought it would.
Malfoy handed him a plain box with no wrapping paper on it, obviously prepared for the elf’s opening habits, inside of which was a batch of Christmas cookies in the shape of house elves.
“I’m willing to give it a try,” Malfoy said with a smirk. “But only because it’s been far too long since I’ve beat you at anything.”
“Why would you? It’s not like we’ve ever been especially close,” he let out a short laugh at the irony, his blunt words stinging slightly for some reason, despite their truth. “Anyhow, I was angry and confused. My whole life I had been told that certain things were true and now I didn’t know what to believe in. Not to mention that I had grown to befriend some Muggles who lived in town. That’s how I got introduced to cars and Queen.”
O’Leary let out a wail of frustration while Harry tried to hide his smile. This same routine had been going on for a better part of an hour, and in the time since they had started, three batches of dough had ended up on the floor, with only one actually deemed worthy enough to be set aside to be rolled out. Harry had quite a bit of experience making Christmas cookies and offered to help Malfoy multiple times, but the blond had repeatedly refused his assistance, insisting stubbornly that he was ‘more than capable of stirring a few ingredients together, thank you very much, Potter’. And so here he was, spending the evening of Christmas Eve watching his boyfriend fling cookie dough around a kitchen with no end to the madness in sight.
“To you as well,” Harry said, sitting back on the edge of his bed as Ron sat up, putting on his slippers.
Draco smirked up at him, the effect slightly undone by his pinked cheeks and soft gasps to catch the breath that Harry had stolen during their kiss. “I hate to break it to you, Harry Potter, but you’re stuck with me now and I’m not leaving.”
A car rattled past the street and Harry stepped out of the road onto the side walk. He was early for dinner but his friends wouldn’t mind him coming in out of the December cold.
“Mum ran into Andromeda at Flourish and Blots the other day,” Ron explained, all while keeping his eyes and wand trained on Malfoy. “And she mentioned that it was so nice that you got a chance to stay with Malfoy and ‘start over’ after all these years or some other rubbish, and you never mentioned anything about Malfoy to me or Hermione, so we—well,
“Glad to see that your perfume has cheered you up so much,” Pansy said sarcastically, pushing a goblet towards him. “Now drink some pumpkin juice. Fluids will help with your cold.”
Oh, god, the mistletoe. What if Malfoy was dying in the snow, without Harry ever having told him how he . . . that he . . .
Resigned to his fate, Draco allowed his impeccable control to slip and let himself snatch glances at Potter. Who had of course started to bite his lip in concentration, drawing Draco’s eye to the one thing he was so anxious to avoid thinking about. Surprising warmth. The smell of cheap shampoo and nutty broom polish. The edge of his glasses pressing against Draco’s cheek. A faint sweetness lingering on his lips from the treacle tart at dinner.
Against all odds, they managed to make it to the other side of the room, only slightly bruised from their buffeting. Draco collapsed onto a stiff leather couch, forgoing his typical straight posture. Potter attempted to perch on one of the armrests, only to slip on the slick fabric and sprawl into Draco’s lap.
“It’s Potter,” Harry corrected gently. “And yes, it was delicious. I was just wondering if I could shovel the rest of the walkway for you.”
Malfoy smiled softly, leaning into the kiss, when O’Leary reappeared with a ‘pop!’, clutching an armful of ingredients.
Panic flashed through Harry and suddenly he found himself flinging the Floo powder into the fire and jumping in after it, clipping his head on the overhanging stone edge. “67 Meadowes Lane!”
“Merlin, Potter, what took you so long?” Suddenly Malfoy was there, the familiarity of his annoyance and expensive spiced cologne strangely comforting after Harry’s stomach-turning Floo trip.
For an instant, Potter’s eyes filled with something that looked an awful lot like panic. He gulped. “Just rumours.”
“It’s odd, I know, but it’s just temporary!” Harry said insistently, glancing helplessly at Hermione, who had taken his announcement a lot better than Ron had.
