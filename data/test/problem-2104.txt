They stared into each other’s eyes for a few moments, before Harry broke the silence. “I don’t care. You’re not that person anymore.”
smiling when he said his name, but shook that out of his head.
So Harry laughed. “I guess so, Draco. God, that feels weird to say.”
Luna giggled. It was strange, watching Harry’s childhood nemesis make Luna so happy. “He used to bring me biscuits and read me stories.” She said to Harry.
Draco’s smile widened. “Remember when I sat in a tree just to taunt you?”
Harry stood for a few moments, unsure of what to do, before eventually sighing heavily and leaving the hall in defeat, feeling an awfully large number of eyes on him.
They sat for a while, crossing off names and discussing the families’ allegiances in the war. Harry watched Draco intently when he spoke, looking at the way his words came out bitterly - as though they left a bad taste in his mouth after being force fed them his whole life.
Draco’s eyes flicked up to Harry’s and he nodded. “Yes, please.”
looked, and remembered that, he may have lost one of his best friends, but he didn’t lose all of them.
Harry and Draco joined Pansy and Blaise on the armchairs and sofas, catching up on everything that happened in France. Harry was happy to join in on the conversations, and found himself laughing along to their stories. Whilst they were speaking, Draco got comfy, shimmying down the sofa until he was lying down, and then resting his head in Harry’s lap. His legs were hanging off of the end of the sofa and he had to strain to look at his friends, but his features were soft with happiness, and Harry was running his fingers through his hair, so he didn’t seem to mind too much.
now. Sam talked to them as they worked.
“One more time.” He said, his hands on Draco’s hips. “For old times’ sake.” With that, he kissed Draco again and turned him around quickly, so that Harry was pressing Draco against the wall now.
“You shouldn’t have. I mean, look at this.” He dropped Draco’s hands gently and ran a finger across one of the lines, as a tear rolled down his cheek. “You shouldn’t forgive me for
“I’ll put the word into the Wizengamot and I’ll ensure the case is rushed.”
Harry smiled, blinking to adjust his eyes to the morning light. He stretched his arms, taking his hand off of Draco’s chest, and yawned. “Don’t worry about it.” He said, with a comfortable sigh. “You’re welcome here anytime.” Draco smiled a small smile that Harry didn’t understand but couldn’t look away from. “Although, I reckon you should teach me that charm pretty soon. I’m surprised neither of us fell off the bed.”
“That’s highly unlikely, Mr Potter.”
“We can survive him, too.”
Harry’s eyes widened and he felt his cheeks heat. “Me?”
. He stopped pacing, breathing hard.
Harry breathed out a nervous laugh at that. “Right. Okay. I’ll get right to it then.”
Harry smiled. “That’ll be nice, I suppose. But, if you guys get lonely…”
Draco laughed uncontrollably, and after a moment Harry joined in.
For the following few weeks, the newspapers continued to write long articles about Harry and Draco’s “scandalous partnership” whilst whispers followed them everywhere they went. Harry wasn’t surprised by Ron and Hermione’s protectiveness over him - they warded off anyone who came too close with threats to hex them into next week and they walked him to his classes whenever he asked them to (and whenever he didn’t, too) - but he
Harry grinned. “You do?”
“That’s a muggle phrase.” Harry said, his voice full of shock.
Harry thought that was the smart decision. Pansy
“So, why did Pansy decide I would be the first Gryffindor invited to the top secret game night?” Harry smiled as he spoke.
Harry tried to turn his head to look, but Malfoy’s hand found its way to Harry’s hip and Harry forgot how to move.
“Are you going to the Weasleys’ for Christmas?” Draco murmured, his head resting on Harry’s lap. Harry hadn’t meant for this to happen. He had simply sat down, leaving plenty of room for Pansy or Blaise or Ron or Hermione or Luna or Ginny or
“You’re seriously telling me that Granger and Weasley didn’t sleep together at least once before they started dating?” Draco’s voice was full of amusement and disbelief.
“Everyone has a choice. If you were in my situation -” At that, Harry interrupted.
Tracey was the next Slytherin to come to Harry in a panic and, after Daphne’s panicked state when she asked to cash in her favour, he prepared himself for the worst. She had burst into the Gryffindor common room with a rather mouse-y looking boy in Ravenclaw robes, her eyes searching around the room. When she had finally seen Harry, she rushed over to him.
Harry asked himself as his heart started beating considerably faster and he felt his hands shake slightly.
“No more questions about the war.” Blaise said, his voice travelling throughout the room. “That’s no fun.”
“Harry, what are you up to?” Ron asked as he stuffed more potatoes into his mouth.
“Shit.” He said under his breath, as Pansy started shoving the two into the nearest dorm room. “Sorry.” He said to Draco, smiling sheepishly.
had about pureblood redheads, then?”
Maybe it would be okay.
He wasn’t nervous. It was
Harry smiled at that. He kept his arm around her as they continued down the street.
Hermione’s frown seemed to deepen. “What if it was a doe? I mean, he said it was personal, right? He and Snape were close. Maybe it’s for him.”
Harry grinned and watched as Draco rolled his eyes. “So, as I was saying, Delilah was telling me about when she was sure she had seen a ghost and it got me thinking - muggles have no clue about ghosts, do they? They just live their lives without the knowledge of life after death. That’s crazy, isn’t it?”
to send him a patronus every night?”
Draco looked slightly reluctant, but opened his door wider anyway. Harry walked in, and started pacing his room.
Harry smiled. He started off at the beginning, keeping his voice quiet even though the silencing charm meant he didn’t have to. It wasn’t long before Draco’s breaths became deep and even and his face softened. Harry smiled at the sight and took his glasses off, placing them and the magazine on his bedside table. He sank down in his bed, and rolled over to face Draco, closing his eyes and slowing his breaths, not thinking about the fact he was in bed with Draco Malfoy, yet again.
“Potter? Are you okay?” Malfoy looked concerned.
“Oh my god.” Harry said, his eyes racing across the faint white lines on Draco’s chest that he had never noticed before, which he now realised were scars from when he cast the Sectumsempra spell. They were barely visible, but they were there.
The rest of the week went by in a blur. Of course, it was a
TW: Alcohol and weed.
Harry nodded. “What is it?”
Harry sighed.
“Yes, but now Shacklebolt’s the Minister.” Harry thought this may actually work. “He doesn’t like to cut corners. Maybe, if I talked to him, he would be okay with going through the whole process. And Lucius is in prison - usually prisoners in Azkaban don’t sign things, their trustees do.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, Harry. I’ll be doing that myself.” Draco smirked. “You need to wait to see the full outfit.”
happy to see them.
The headline on the front page screamed “Boy Who Lived Kisses Boy Who Killed”.
Harry laughed and Pansy rolled her eyes.
“Please don’t.” Harry said, although he knew it was pointless.
“Draco had already asked me. We’re really good friends.” She said. “And it was still new. But, now… Now, it’s official, I suppose.”
She stared Harry down again, and Harry felt the whole Hall’s eyes on him. Of course, she was talking about him and Malfoy.
Harry laughed and relaxed further into the sofa, allowing the warmth from the booze and the laughter and Draco to spread through his body. This was just what he needed after last night.
“So, Harry, I believe it was your turn to choose someone.” Draco said once everybody was sitting down.
“Shit! You’ll be late for work.”
At dinner, Harry made sure to glance at Malfoy regularly enough that Hermione and Ron jumped in, their voices quiet.
It hurt that the first person he had ever truly loved like this, in this way, was leaving him. And he couldn’t do anything about it. He couldn’t fix it.
“Tell me I’m wrong!”
“How would he have done that?” Harry asked.
Harry wished Draco had smiled more when they were younger. Maybe they could have ended their rivalry a little bit earlier if he had, because God, his smile was hot.
secrets.
Except, McGonagall clearly thought differently, because she continued to speak. “I will be arranging a ball for all senior students to attend at the end of the month. Whilst attendance isn’t compulsory, it is greatly encouraged. I’m hoping this night will help us unify the houses for the first time in decades.”
Harry laughed. “No. In the alleyway.”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione’s voice was gentle and she squeezed his arm slightly. “I don’t think he has much choice in the matter.”
Harry practically felt Draco’s inward eye roll at Slughorn’s obvious favouritism, but Harry knew he could use it to their advantage.
“Potter?”
Harry groaned.
“This might just turn out for the best.” Harry chuckled, his voice quiet for Draco to hear.
“I can’t…” Malfoy seemed to be struggling to find the words. “It’s hard to relax now.”
“Mmhmm?” Harry murmured, looking down at Draco.
Harry breathed out a laugh at Draco’s use of the name, ‘Ginevra’, and at the fact that Draco wouldn’t have told him this if it weren’t for the Veritaserum. Although, he was finding it rather hard to concentrate, what with Draco’s mouth so close to his neck. He couldn’t help but think that Draco didn’t
Eventually, Blaise patted Ron’s shoulder, a barely concealed smile on his face. “I think it’s time to give up. Let’s go get some breakfast, yeah?”
He had spent the afternoon dressing and undressing over and over again, trying to find the perfect outfit. He hadn’t been given much to go on, really. For tonight, everything was up to Malfoy and he didn’t know how to handle that. He eventually decided that everything Malfoy wore was too much - he would wear a suit to bed if he felt it was necessary - so he put on his nicest three piece suit and headed to the shop to be picked up.
Harry frowned at Draco’s face.
Harry’s eyes widened. “What?” His breathing quickened.
His eyes were wide and he wasn’t quite sure what to say. The only thing he could think of was,
be honouring my promise. If pupils cannot learn to respect their peers, I see no issue with removing the house system.” She paused for a moment, shaking her head slightly. “But in the meantime, I will be making some changes on a trial basis.”
She waved a hand dismissively, her face warm. “Oh, please, call me Molly.” Draco smiled slightly at that. “I’m just preparing the dinner, but you lot can go into the living room. Arthur and some of the others are in there.” She ‘tsk’ed before speaking again. “Of course, half of them are still in bed.”
Harry smiled. “Yeah, definitely.”
He busied himself with cleaning up the shop and waiting for more customers, but his mind was far away. Even as he chatted to his customers, he couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy. He was so open and… different. And his scars… Harry could not take his mind off those fucking scars.
She laughed. “It’s alright.” She gave him a tight squeeze before letting him go. “It’ll take some time, but… They’ll heal eventually.” She cleared her throat. “We all will.” She then squeezed Harry’s arm and made her way up to bed.
“Oh, shit.” He said, bowing his head, as though that would make him invisible. “She’s pissed.”
“Wait,” Hermione said, lifting up a few books that were spread out on the table and finding the one she was looking for. “I think I’ve read about this.” She flicked through the pages as she spoke. “At first, I thought that someone could be sending you images in your dreams, Harry. You said you couldn’t remember them at first, and it seemed like it was almost purposeful.”
. There was no scar on his forehead, his hair was neatly gelled back, his glasses were no longer there, his eyes were an unsettling blue and his skin colour was much lighter than Harry’s.
the Weasleys are spending Christmas with a group of Slytherins.”
“I don’t know. It’s that fucking word.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Shut up. Look in the box.”
Malfoy nodded and took a deep breath. “I… Well… Snape healed the scars as best as he could.” Harry leaned in, eager to hear the story. “And he did a good job - Dittany’s a miracle worker. But, he knew the spell well, and he knew that it wouldn’t fully heal. Once I was feeling better, he told me that I would always look like this, but…” He ran a hand through his blonde hair and sighed, seemingly making a decision in his head. “Listen, Potter, my father isn’t a big fan of weakness. And, well, injury is a weakness, according to him. I didn’t want him to know about it. I didn’t want
. Of course, the new eighth year common room was nicer than the Gryffindor one and it was rather relaxing, all things considered. But seeing Malfoy there every day was anything but calming. He avoided him as much as possible, but the new common room was small and sociable and Harry found himself interacting with Malfoy much more because of it. They would force smiles with each other and avoid eye contact and Harry kept telling himself,
Malfoy nodded. “Ah. Must be difficult running this place by yourself.”
“No. And as your boss, I’m forbidding you to bring it up again.”
Dread started to creep up Harry’s neck and he nodded.
“Sorry, Pans, it’s part of your pyjama set! And I went through Blaise’s stuff, too.”
Harry had always hated that phrase - he had spent the first 11 years of his life living in a physical closet and another 7 living in a mental one - but when Draco said it, it didn’t sound so bad.
Hermione smiled at him as they entered the dining room and she gestured for them to sit. “Well, we know that Malf -
Draco cleared his throat. “He’s… He’s doing okay, I suppose.” He sighed. “After Vince died, he wanted to take some time off from school. He’s doing some travelling now, trying to clear his head.”
Sorry for the wait in between updates! I've been quite busy recently but I'm writing as fast as possible!
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “Really?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “At least take a fucking day off. I know my company is excellent, but surely you have better things to do than sitting here with me all night.”
Pansy smirked and sat back with a ‘hmmf’ of satisfaction.
Harry felt a twinge of guilt again, and he looked Draco in the eyes, his words sincere. “You didn’t have to do that.”
Draco looked at Harry, really looked at him, for a minute. “I want you so bad, Harry.” Harry smiled at Draco, full of lust and love. “But there’s something you need to know.”
instead, Draco.” Blaise said, a smile on his face.
Harry interrupted his rambling. “You can go back to bed, if you like. Sorry for waking you up.” Harry was surprised to see that he actually
a favour, too?”
“Hi.” Harry said dumbly and Draco’s brows raised. “Do you… want to be my partner?”
Draco smiled, and that was too much for Harry. Because his smile was so beautiful, and Harry had let himself forget that. Somewhere between ‘boyfriend’ and ‘husband’, he had let himself forget how beautiful the love of his life truly was.
He groaned at the sight and, overtaken by lust, he grabbed Malfoy’s arms and flipped him over. Harry was now straddling him and he kissed him hard, spurred on by Malfoy’s moans as he did so.
Ron chuckled. “Right, because Malfoy just got lost and stumbled his way into your bed.”
Harry nodded, asking “To go?” and receiving a nod in return. He was unsure of what to think of Malfoy’s confidence in his coffee skills. But, he started working anyway, creating one of his more obscure drinks that he had never put on the menu before due to a lack of demand. It was one of his favourites and he honestly only had the ingredients stocked for his own coffee breaks.
Malfoy took a deep breath. “It’s always the same. I… There’s darkness. All around me, and I…” He shook his head, seeming to be debating whether or not to tell Harry. He cleared his throat and spoke again. “I can’t breathe, or move, really. It feels like… Death. Like I’m dying. And all I can hear is the sound of water and this… ringing in my ears. I feel like… Like I’m becoming the darkness.” He inhales deeply. “And then, things get… lighter. And it’s easier to breathe. And, when I look around, I see the stag there. Like it’s protecting me.” He shook his head again. “Then, I wake up.”
There was quite a bit more yelling before Molly finally declared that enough was enough and everyone ought to leave Harry alone. Harry took the first chance he got to leave the room and return to his bedroom, where he shut the door and lay down in his cot with a sigh.
Seamus smiled and looked over at Dean on the other side of the room. “Because of you, me and Dean got together.”
Harry was sure Malfoy wasn’t coming. It was probably an accident. He had meant to say ‘see you later’, instead of ‘see you tomorrow’. A common mistake, really. After all, it was almost closing time and it was about to get dark. No one buys coffee when it’s dark. And it was fine, no harm done, because it’s not like Harry had been waiting around for Malfoy to come in. No. He had been working. A lot of work to do. Which is why he was open past closing time tonight - he had a lot of paperwork to go over and rent was due in… 2 weeks.
“Cute, Harry, very cute.” She said sarcastically. “You know, when McGonagall said you
“Harry.” Draco said gently, trying to calm Harry down, massaging his hand lightly. “Harry, let’s go for a walk.” He stood up and gently started pulling Harry away.
Pansy frowned. “So, muggles just… think the whole concept of ghosts is fake?”
Harry’s attention was drawn to Pansy and Blaise once more, when he heard them whispering again, cupping their hands to each other’s ears as they spoke.
Harry looked at Malfoy, expecting to see some sort of reaction. But instead, Malfoy just nodded. “Yeah, that would be nice. You know, you guys are actually sort of similar.”
Harry frowned. “So, why can’t you -”
Malfoy scoffed. “You performed the patronus charm in your sleep without even realising it, Potter. You being a Legilimens is possible.”
Harry nodded. “It’s shit.”
“It’s always you two.” She shook her head. “You two are the reason the house system isn’t working.”
could come in very handy.
Harry breathed out a laugh. “Merry Christmas, Ron.”
Harry’s robes weren’t right. They were itchy, and didn’t fit well and his shoes didn’t match. He told himself it was fine. Why did he even care, anyway? He was planning on making an appearance, smiling at McGonagall, and then leaving as soon as possible.
The next stage of their plan was going well.
Harry smiled. “Yeah, I suppose it has.” He thought about it for a moment. “I don’t travel much. You know, I have to stay here to keep this place open, and I never went on holidays when I was younger.”
Harry blinked. He heard Draco let out an awkward cough and Harry sighed. “Umm… I wanted to make sure the decorations were right.”
“Well, instead of covering it with a tattoo, I was thinking you could surround it with a tattoo. Imagine this,” He grabbed Draco’s forearm, touching the mark with his finger to demonstrate his idea. “If you surrounded it with a tattoo like flowers or something, the lines of the mark would look much less… harsh, and it would almost be like you chose this tattoo.”
Malfoy smiled. “Yeah, to Australia or something. Wizarding Britain has been sort of shit to you.”
Except, now he had done all the paperwork and a deep clean and it was basically dark now, but he decided to sit down for a coffee. Decaf, of course, nobody drinks coffee when it’s dark. And he was about to leave, he really was, but the bell chimed. And, if he was here, he could serve one last customer past closing time. And it was Malfoy.
After a minute or two of waiting, Draco burst into Harry’s room with a smirk on his face and a joint in his hand.
Draco held Harry’s face and brought it up to his own, whispering. “How did I get so lucky to have this - to have you?”
He sighed. “Fine.” Malfoy’s head snapped towards Harry, disbelief evident on his face. Harry spoke again before Malfoy could hex him. “
Hermione didn’t seem happy with his stance on the subject, but she answered him all the same. “Oh, I’ll be going alone. Well, I suppose, Ron and I will be going together, but we won’t arrive together.”
“Of course.” She walked over to the desk quietly, placing it down carefully. She hesitated for a moment before turning to Harry. “Thank you, Harry. For helping Draco through this.”
“I know. But… I guess I wanted to put off that conversation a bit. Until I knew where we both stood, I suppose.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah.” He sighed. “It’s a doe.”
But, instead, Malfoy cleared his throat, took a deep breath, and walked away as though nothing happened.
Harry was about to shake his head - he really didn’t want to end up on the front page with some strange rumour again - but he couldn’t help but ask, “Are you?”
They both sat smiling for a few moments.
“My parents stayed up with me, and they sold the house the next day. We never looked back. But, we found out years later, that the next owners had a daughter. She had been my age, but, after a month of living there, she had died suddenly in her sleep. And I know… I know it could have been me.”
to know what Malfoy’s tattoo meant, but he was ignored every time he tried to find out. Of course, he realised that the ball was tomorrow, and his best shot at getting Malfoy’s attention was at the one place he was required to be.
Harry snorted. “Shut up, you git. And take your fucking shoes off if your feet are going to be in my bed.”
As Draco led the way, he looked back at Harry. “My mother’s been asking about you. She wanted to say hi to you, but I told her it would have to wait.”
They both lay in silence, trailing their hands over each other’s skin absent-mindedly until their silence eventually became kissing and their kissing became moaning and their moaning became coming again and again.
"I don't... really know how to start." Malfoy said, fiddling with his sleeves. "I guess, I'll just tell you everything."
Harry laughed. “Okay, Malfoy. That’s fine by me.”
Draco seemed to know exactly what Harry was thinking, because after a moment, he said, “This isn’t my real room.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Merlin knows. She’s awfully strange, really.” He laughed fondly as he spoke. “She’s been very impressed with your latest conquests.”
Draco smiled. “Honestly, I was nostalgic.” He said, sinking down into the sofa and passing Harry his drink again. “I wanted to be back here for another year. I mean, last year was awful and, don’t get me wrong, it’s sometimes difficult to walk through the halls, but… Hogwarts has been my home for the past seven years of my life.” He cleared his throat. “And I had amends to make.”
Harry looked around and realised that they were all in his room. His bed must have been rather crowded - what, with Draco, Ron and Harry all squished up like that. He was also surprised to see that Blaise and Ginny were still sleeping on the floor, and Ginny was most definitely spooning Blaise.
“We need you to clear its history. Right now.”
Harry nodded. They were in the corridor in between lessons and people were all around them. “Here.”
“Yes, but I don’t think ‘excited’ is the right word. I told you, she’s only nice to people she likes. And Blaise… I love him, but he’s very… protective.”
. His body was always relaxed now, no longer sitting stiffly upright. His hair was ruffled, his hair gel not making an appearance once during eighth year. Even his face was softer now, the creases beside his eyes becoming more prominent every time he smiled. And he smiled
Harry shook his head and rolled his eyes, but he
Harry had, of course, been right to feel ill.
Ron and Hermione nodded.
“Yeah?” Harry asked, his voice slightly quieter than normal.
Hermione smiled slightly, before inhaling sharply and increasing the volume of her voice so suddenly that Draco’s hand found its way to Harry’s forearm, clutching it for dear life. Harry could focus on nothing but the feeling of it for a moment.
He savoured this moment, hoping it would last forever. He drank it all in, felt the music vibrate beneath his feet, held Draco close, and breathed a sigh of relief.
“Good boy.” Malfoy said quietly as Harry ate, and Harry almost choked on his food at the sound of it.
Draco smiled slightly, though it was a sad smile. “No, you idiot. Why do you think I wanted to end this? I was falling for you, and I thought… well, I thought you were faking it.”
Harry wondered if Draco would ask for a favour eventually, but he inwardly shook the thought out of his head. He shouldn’t want Draco to ask for a favour. He
“I can’t move.” Harry whispered, gesturing to Ron.
Malfoy
He stopped in his tracks, whipped around to face Draco and asked loudly, “What the hell are you doing?”
“I’m not!” Harry said, and was about to argue his point, but his curiosity got the best of him. “Why would you think that?”
felt right when he was with Draco. “It felt like we were together out of obligation. You know, I wanted to become a part of the family, and she had been into me when she was little. But, now it’s… We’re better off as friends.”
Harry sighed.
“Well, there are a few upsides.” Draco said, squeezing Harry’s hand. Harry thought he might melt at this, but he kept it together nonetheless.
Harry was finally broken out of his thoughts and looked at Hermione.
Draco smiled. “Yeah, she is. I mean, she’s always been nice to me. But my father… he wasn’t nice to
“Shall we grab a coffee?” Harry asked as Draco continued to admire his tattoo.
to defend yourself?” Harry exhaled sharply. “Pathetic.”
“I don’t know. I have a bad temper, like him. And, sometimes, our mannerisms are quite alike, and, now the Parseltongue… I just… I’m worried I’m becoming him.” Draco squeezed Harry’s hands and Harry looked up.
Harry’s eyes widened. “I’m so sorry.”
Draco shook his head. “This time, it’s different. I can imagine him saying that - he… he
“How long will they be staying?” Harry asked, a smile on his face as Draco ran his fingers through his hair.
, even that was hot, and his eyes kept trailing downwards until they found what they were looking for.
Harry and Draco waved him off, but both stayed next to each other. Harry had lost his cup at some point during the evening but Draco topped his off, took a sip, and wordlessly handed his cup over to Harry. Harry accepted it with a smile and took a sip.
“Harry!” Her voice was warm.
Harry frowned. “About what?”
Harry thought.
Everyone else was, too, of course. The Veritaserum seemed to be challenging them all. The truth was mere inches away at any given moment and it was intoxicatingly exhilarating. They were all killing time, really. Just waiting for the potion to wear off. None of them were out for blood tonight - not even Pansy. They were all content simply laughing and breathing together.
Hermione sighed. “It depends what you mean by ‘got together’.”
Well, he wasn’t actually sure if he had figured it out, but he had remembered the few times in his time at Hogwarts that Gryffindor and Slytherin were in agreement. He had considered the idea that a common enemy would help things along a bit, but he quickly realised that was where it had all gone wrong the first time around. Voldemort didn’t exactly unite the houses of Hogwarts. He had quickly realised it when he thought back to second year - houses didn’t matter when the whole of Hogwarts had something to bitch about.
Draco sighed heavily. “Enough of this depressing conversation. We’re here to
Malfoy smirked. “Is McGonagall watching?”
“Weird Christmas.” Ron said, an odd smile on his face.
Harry rolled his eyes, but decided to let it go for now.
Hermione shook her head. “It’s wonderful news, really. We’ve been trying for a while. But… It’s just…” She seemed to be struggling for words, but she continued anyway. “I’m scared.” Her voice was quiet as she said it.
rumour would be spreading. About him and Daphne Greengrass. And him and Theodore Nott. And him and Tracey Davis. And him and any Slytherin in his year that would be willing to be
Draco moaned as Harry kissed him, which sent a shiver down Harry’s spine. “Fine.” He said, as they came up for air. “Once more.”
“I’m… I’m sorry, Malfoy.”
Draco smirked. “Not easier for you.”
“Obviously.” Ron sighed.
It was only on the last day of their holidays - as Harry was dragging out the last of his packing - that Draco finally called him. Harry was surprised, watching the phone as it rang for a moment, before answering it eagerly.
Malfoy looked him up and down, and Harry could practically feel Sam’s excitement from beside him. “Well, who will be making my drink today? I don’t want Potter to be messing it up.”
“Can we help you, Potter?” Pansy asked with a look of disgust on her face, although her tone lacked the malice it was once laced with - likely a product of her and Luna’s relationship.
He downed the potion and breathed through the awful taste.
Draco snorted. “No, of course not. He thought it was disgusting. He only found my muggle things once, and he made me burn them all. Using magic, of course. After that, I was more careful.” Draco seemed far away, talking as though he was still in the moment. Maybe he was. He took a deep breath, seeming to come back to the present. “Anyway, as I was saying, who cares if it wasn’t in the plan? Life is too short to plan everything, Harry. Surely, we know that by now. Besides, friends shag all the time, it doesn’t really matter.”
“I’m sorry, Harry. He hasn’t told me. I asked him when I saw it, but he said he didn’t want to talk about it. I generally find that you shouldn’t push someone if they’re not ready. It’s not fair on anyone. He’d come to me if he wanted me to know.”
knew him), he was falling more every day. Every second, really.
“Draco… Rita Skeeter isn’t reliable. She makes up quotes all of the time.” Harry said gently.
Harry started laughing again and Draco’s red eyes creased up as he joined in quickly, neither of them understanding what was funny.
Malfoy pushed him onto the bed, breaking their kiss to undress Harry. For every piece of clothing he removed, he trailed kisses along Harry’s skin, and Harry was sure he had died because this was
Harry didn’t know what to do. He looked at Malfoy, and Malfoy looked at him. They both knew they had messed up. They knew that kiss they were about to have was not fake. If it were fake, they would have gone through with it when they heard someone. But they didn’t.
Draco smiled, a small soft smile that Harry couldn’t take his eyes off of. “Me too.”
Ginny laughed. “Never.”
Harry grinned.
“God, we’ve slept for ages.” Harry said, his voice still groggy.
“Can we get under the covers, Harry?” He said, already curling up slightly.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Please, they won’t back down from a challenge. Especially here, of all places.”
“You boys can leave. I’m tired of seeing you two in here.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “This is apparently the most interesting thing to happen at the Ministry since Ron started working there. And he catches bloody criminals!”
Draco looked almost shocked at Harry’s voice. “I suppose we’ll just… go back to how it was before. You know, back to the pretending.”
Harry was distracted by Hermione’s hair in his face and her arms around his torso. He laughed as he hugged her back, and his eyes made their way over to Ron and Blaise, who were also in the middle of hugging, much to Harry’s surprise. When Hermione let Harry go, he gave Blaise a quick hug, and they all started walking through the snow together.
Harry furrowed his brow and collapsed onto his bed, waiting to see Draco. He pestered Draco, asking if he could see yet, to which Draco responded “No, you twat, be patient” and, after a few more moments, he appeared, almost making Harry’s heart stop in the process.
“How can you say that? I… I find myself to be alarmingly similar to him sometimes.”
She nodded. “Mmhmm. I don’t care how you do it - you can kill half of them for all I care - just as long as it’s not so bloody sacred.” She sighed. “Look, I know it’s a lot, but you’re probably the only person in Wizarding Britain who holds the same amount of power as them. Can you do it?”
“Oh, and there you are back in the closet.” Draco said from the bed, his arms behind his head and his mouth twisted into a smirk.
“Fuck!” He breathed out, his chest in pain from the impact.
“What the fuck does that tattoo mean?”
Harry laughed and began unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, but Draco pulled away.
had nightmares. But then, the stag showed up, and I… I slept well. I started sleeping all the way through the night.”
“I was telling Harry about how we became friends.”
Harry frowned. “Shouldn’t Draco be the one asking for this favour?”
“She looked pretty fucking angry earlier.”
Blaise whistled, Seamus let out a “Whoop” and other people cheered, but all Harry could focus on was Draco’s breath on his neck as he leaned in closer and spoke to him, his voice low and only meant for Harry. “I can already see the headlines - Saviour of the Wizarding World strips for Slytherins.”
“I was terrified that I would see the man again. But, I gathered up all of my courage, and went to shut my window and my curtains anyway. I looked outside, just for a second at first, and I saw that he wasn’t there. I breathed a sigh of relief, finally closing my curtains. But,”
do but bring his hands down to cover his crotch, unsure of how he would explain this one to Slughorn.
After a while, Pansy looked Harry directly in the eyes, her expression serious and said, “I’m sorry about the war, Potter. You deserved better.”
Harry swallowed. “I… I guess that I’ve never seen a good marriage, either.” He sighed. “At least, not one that ended well. They all seemed to…” His voice lowered to a whisper, and his eyes dropped down to Draco’s hand on his. “Die.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Before I answer that, you can’t ask any questions.” She frowned deeply at that, so he continued speaking. “But, if you do this, no questions asked,
Harry’s eyes widened. “How come you never told me?”
Harry nodded and gestured to the desk.
Harry grinned. “Oh, right.” He scanned the room. He considered asking one of the Gryffindors - he could aim his questions more easily that way - but he decided against it. Inter-house unity and everything. “Blaise, truth or dare?”
“Your minute’s up!” Pansy said, her hand by her wand, but not touching it.
Harry looked at him. He could see he was considering it. “Do you want to?”
Harry tried to stop his face from heating as he read it, tried not to imagine what Draco was missing about him, but Ron grumbled, “What does the letter say?”, from his bed and shook Harry from his thoughts.
“Busy day, I see, Potter.” Malfoy said, a smile on his lips.
Harry laughed at that, and his eyes widened when he realised that he had just laughed at one of Malfoy’s jokes. What was happening to him?
They knew just how much Harry was into Malfoy.
Harry frowned. “What?”
After lots of twists and turns, they were at Draco’s door, so Draco stopped and looked at Harry as though he were dumb. “Because you saved her. All of us, really. And, well, because you told her I was okay. In the forest.”
“Where am I supposed to sit?” Blaise asked, his tone bored yet angry at the same time.
Harry felt a wave of relief wash over him. He laughed loudly.
They stared at each other for a moment before Malfoy spoke. “So… the drink.”
He started to pull away, but Draco put one of his hands on Harry’s face, his thumb tracing circles on his cheek, and used the other to grab the joint and put it out on the firewhiskey bottle.
McGonagall was standing frozen in the corridor a few feet away from them. Her eyes were wide, and Harry was sure he had never seen her so shocked in his life.
“What?” Harry breathed. He lifted Draco’s chin up with his finger gently, waiting for Draco’s eyes to meet his. But, when they did, Harry hated what he saw. His grey eyes were bright with sadness and anger and god knows what else. Harry’s voice hardened. “You’re leaving.”
“You’ve got to be joking.” Seamus said, his mouth hanging open.
“She wears a bloody thong to bed. She’s a proper psycho.”
Harry met him in the middle and they shared a chaste kiss, breathing each other in.
Malfoy laughed along, too. “Never, Potter.”
Ron frowned, an amused look on his face. “Is that the game that you won, Harry?”
“You have nothing to apologise for.” Draco pulled Harry into a hug and Harry couldn’t help but realise just how much they had both changed.
“Oh, I think it does.” Ginny said, her eyes twinkling with amusement.
There was a murmur of agreement across the table, before Harry decided that he was sick of speaking about it for today, and agreed that they would talk about it tomorrow. He ate his food listening to his friends’ chatter about one of the seventh years’ terrible back-to-school haircut, and blissfully forgot about the task ahead of him.
“Yes, and I’ve already told them I’m into you.”
say - and so he waited for Malfoy to speak.
Malfoy scoffed. “Yeah, aside from the hexes that get thrown at me on a daily basis.”
“What the fuck is going on here?” Blaise’s voice boomed as he approached the two of them.
Malfoy grinned, raised the cup in cheers and took a sip. Harry was nervous as he watched him react, and thought for a moment that it was maybe slightly odd for him to try to impress his ex-nemesis, but that thought soon disappeared as he saw Malfoy’s expression.
Harry chuckled. “Fuck off. I just mean, we’ve had some pretty shitty years. This year should be fun. And this is fun.”
Draco smiled proudly and Harry laughed, unable to help himself at the ridiculousness of the story. “Well, that’s definitely a different take on why the two fell out.”
Hermione and Ron shared a look. “Oh.” Hermione said and there was a pause. “Do you… talk to him at all?”
Harry rolled his eyes but he couldn’t help the grin on his face. He really did love it here, with his new friends.
Harry knew he was fucked. He had the opportunity to finally get some rest and let someone else do the heavy lifting, but he chose to stay just so he could make Malfoy his goddamn ‘surprise me’ coffees. He researched new drinks that he had been wanting to try when the cafe was slow, hoping to make the flavour perfect enough that Malfoy would compliment him again. He didn’t even tell Malfoy that he had hired someone until Malfoy brought it up himself.
Draco was wearing the leather trousers he had mentioned to Harry before, a white shirt and a smirk. He looked positively delectable.
Harry laughed lightly at that, before he realised something. “Wait, did you do that on purpose? Did you hide them from me?”
He, Ron and Hermione were quietly studying in the eighth year common room. Well, actually, Hermione was quietly studying, whilst Harry and Ron had been staring at their books for about an hour, just waiting for Hermione to let them leave.
Pansy shot him a glare that said
“Well, they like to imagine they’re real,” Harry said, clearing his throat slightly, “But, they don’t actually believe it. They tell ghost stories for fun, though.”
Harry tried to keep the smile off his face.
Pansy breathed out a laugh. “You’re surprised that
After dragging themselves out of bed, they told the others about their plan to visit muggle London and, once they had convinced everyone to join them, they spent their day lounging around in the eighth year common room. They wasted their day there, laughing and killing time until it was time to get ready for their night out.
Malfoy nodded, an odd look in his eyes. “I think so, too.”
“Is that it?” Draco asked, his shoulders hunched.
“Draco.” Harry moaned, wanting more, wanting everything.
Draco breathed out a sigh of relief and grinned. “Dickhead.” He rolled his eyes. “Seriously, Harry. Why?”
However, it was now becoming a problem. Because he was currently sitting in the Gryffindor common room beside a group of Slytherins, and no one was arguing. No insults were flying. Harry’s friends were all getting along just fine, just as they usually did nowadays. And that was a problem because Draco looked so damn sexy when he talked to Harry’s friends like that. And his breath felt so good on Harry’s neck when Draco would lean towards him to make a sly comment meant only for Harry. And his mouth looked so good when he was laughing. And all Harry could think about was what the
Harry shook his head. “No, you’re running away. This got too serious and you’re not fighting to keep it.”
Draco thrust his forearm at Harry with such pride and happiness that Harry couldn’t help but grin. He almost gasped when he looked at the tattoo. The dark mark looked so much softer now - it was surrounded by a few large narcissus flowers, some smaller pansies and, floating around the flowers, were tiny white stars.
The next day, Sam arrived at work with a grin.
They both sat laughing for a few moments before quietening down. Harry realised the gravity of the situation they were in. Telling the truth when you have a group full of people to distract you is one thing, but it’s something entirely different to be alone with someone and do so. What’s worse, that someone was Draco.
Harry finally managed to reach the Firewhiskey, and grabbed it as Draco toed off his shoes, letting them fall to the floor.
And there they sat, the Weasleys and the Slytherins, laughing together for the first time in forever, listening to the way George’s breaths stuttered as his laugh came to an end, but his smile remained.
Draco grinned and levitated the sign to hang above the fireplace. “It looks perfect.” He said, looking up at it with a smile on his face.
Malfoy giggled slightly, and Harry found himself thinking of what Sam said again. “They’re nice. You chose a good one there, Harry.”
“Good.” Harry answered, keeping a tight grip on Draco’s hand. “Smells amazing, what are you making?”
“Fantastic.”
“What… what the fuck, Harry?” Hermione said, her voice weak as though it had taken all of her strength to speak.
“You go on. I’ll just be a few minutes.”
“Harry.” Theodore smiled, and he spoke, getting straight to the point. “I was hoping to call in one of my favours.” Theodore said, his voice sure and bored as always.
Harry chuckled. “She kept her own last name.”
this, he just had to be here.
Harry blinked for a moment. This was odd. “Umm… Seeker Weekly.” He watched as Draco’s eyes stayed blankly fixed on the magazine, and Harry offered, “I could read it to you, if you like?”
had not defeated him. This matter isn’t up for debate - you owe me a favour, and I am here to collect. Allow Narcissa Malfoy to sign off Lucius Malfoy’s assets on his behalf, or I assure you, I
Harry frowned. “Like… Like the
Slughorn's footsteps were loud in the silence as he walked in, mumbling something about too much noise while he’s trying to sleep, just as Draco slid in front of Harry, covering him up. He looked back at him, motioned to the drinks, and then looked back at Slughorn, making sure he was in front of Harry, so that Slughorn wouldn’t see him naked. Harry looked over at the sofas, seeing bottles everywhere, and waved his hand, wandlessly moving them underneath the sofa and hoping Slughorn didn’t see.
And then, Malfoy wasn’t kissing him. He was pulling back and speaking, his voice low and rough and delicious.
McGonagall was not happy, and Harry realised just how fucking stupid the house system really was. One dance between teenagers had reignited a rivalry that was as brutal as ever. Harry would walk into the Gryffindor common room and find no Slytherins in sight. After the war, most houses mixed into other dorms, and the passwords were basically redundant. But now, the common room was quieter than normal, much more hostile, and the passwords were changed twice a week. He hated it.
Draco laughed. “Oh no, Harry. As much as I would love to stay in with you, when I look this good, other people simply must look at me. We’re going.”
Sam laughed loudly. “Fine, fine. Think about it, though.”
Odd indeed.
Harry glared at Draco. “That sip better count as your next present.”
When he and Draco sat down, Harry realised that Neville was sitting next to Theodore, his eyes fixed on a Herbology book that was laying open beside his plate.
At the end, after he’d finished explaining everything, he sat, slightly breathless, waiting for someone to say something. He looked between Ron and Hermione, who were wearing matching expressions of shock and confusion.
Malfoy still looked as though he wasn’t budging, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco laughed. “Oh, that should never have happened, really. It was… We both needed a beard. But neither of us had talked about it beforehand. It just… happened. We only ever made sense as friends.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, looking up from the blank piece of parchment that was supposed to be his potions essay.
“Slughorn has put a…” Tracey looked to the Ravenclaw boy and shook her head before continuing. “Surveillance charm up in his potions cupboard.”
Oh god, Harry hadn’t been listening, but Malfoy was looking at him with a strange look in his eye so Harry smiled and nodded, hoping he hadn’t just been asked a question. There was a short silence, which concerned Harry, but he cleared his throat and asked, “So, can I get you anything? Or did you just drop by to say hi?”
Malfoy Apparated them away and the warm touch of his hand in Harry’s made Harry forget about the unsettling feeling of it. As they made it to Malfoy’s flat, Harry didn’t have time to take in his surroundings. All he could focus on was Malfoy. Malfoy’s lips. Malfoy’s hands in his hair. Malfoy moaning into Harry’s mouth as Harry pulled him close.
Malfoy tilted his head slightly, deep in thought.
In the evening they had all gathered around in the living room, drinking and laughing, feeling the comfort of the outside world darkening, and smiling in the knowledge that they were safe in the warmth of the Burrow. It was beautiful, and Harry was in love with the feeling.
“Oh, yeah.” Harry said, smirking. “I could have sworn I heard you with him in the middle of the night.”
Draco smirked. “Surprise me.”
“What’s so funny?” Harry hissed.
Harry smiled at his words. There was a silent rebellion in them. Something that said that they really
“It was lovely seeing you, Narcissa.” Harry said with a smile.
Draco narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms, but he didn’t disagree.
A murmur spread throughout the room and Pansy whispered to Harry, “This could be interesting”, with a smirk on her face.
Hermione matched his expression when she saw them. “Hi!”
“Umm… yeah. I mean, it’s obviously been a bit of a struggle, but I’ve mostly just been thinking.”
Harry had finally hired somebody. Of course, it took a great deal of adoring fans staring at him during interviews, as well as some very inexperienced teenagers applying for the job, to find Sam.
He inwardly shook his head and rejoined the group, ready to get back into the game.
at least, but nothing came out of his mouth. All he could do was stare in silence. And, god, was there something to stare at. The most obvious being Malfoy’s face. The face that Harry had seen every day for seven years in a row. The face he hadn’t seen since the trials six years ago. The face that he had fought with and insulted and hated and cut open and watched as it was sewn back together. The face that he was used to. And now… the face that he had scarred.
this good. As much as he hated to admit it, Sam had been right. The scars were hot. And Malfoy suited them so damn well that Harry couldn’t even feel guilty about the damage he had caused. He was too busy thinking about how hard it would be to undo the buttons on that suit.
. Harry knew that Draco was joking and if any of the Weasleys saw the note, they wouldn’t suspect their relationship was fake, but there was something about his neat, cursive handwriting spelling out the word ‘love’ that Harry couldn’t get over. When he opened it, he was confused to find a seemingly old book, titled
be scary?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Of course not, I’m not an idiot. All of our muggle friends think we’re muggles, too.”
Harry shook his head. “Yes, I am. I love it here. I love the cafe.”
Draco grinned and Harry was so lost in the sight that, for a moment, he forgot that they weren’t alone. He mentally shook himself out of his thoughts and turned to see Pansy’s smirk.
Harry frowned. “What do you mean?”
She cut him off, grabbing his face and kissing him, allowing everyone to see. She stayed there for a few moments before dropping her hands and pulling away. Harry heard a couple of whistles - most likely from Pansy and Blaise - and he was sure he heard Slughorn spluttering (although Harry wasn’t worried about what he would say - he seemed to be rather fond of Harry), but he was more focused on
“Jeez, Pansy, what spell did you use?” Harry asked, as he watched Ron wiping at his face while Hermione had her wand pointed at him, muttering all sorts of cleaning spells.
Harry found it odd, hearing Draco and Pansy talk about their families in a negative light. When they were younger, they seemed to worship the ground their parents walked on. Harry supposed they had grown since then, but it still felt strange.
He heard the scraping of chairs on the floor and looked around him, finally remembering where he was. Everyone was getting up and grabbing potion ingredients.
“That feels nice.” Draco whispered, smiling.
He missed Draco every minute, counting down the days until he could see him again. He had packed up all of his belongings rather prematurely in anticipation and every part of him ached to see Draco, to touch him, to hold him.
“I’m sure you’ve already heard by now, but I’m sort of… seeing Pansy.”
“You guys don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Malfoy’s friends were there, too, of course. They had all arrived separately, walking in with smirks on their faces and joining each other on the dancefloor. Luna was dancing with them, with all of the Slytherins, as though the war had never happened. She was dancing with
Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about all of this.
Once they had finished eating, Harry asked sweetly, “So, what do you want to do today? I’m all finished with my potions homework, thanks to you.”
“Of course, that’s only until he gets out of Azkaban.”
“Oh, yes. I never agree to the boring ones. But I’m afraid that’s classified, Potter.” He smirked.
This day was
Harry’s brows raised. He had honestly forgotten all about the favours he still owed the Slytherins. It had been a while since anyone had asked him for one.
“It means… I want him to know he’s loved.” She had responded with an odd look in her eye, before shooing Harry out of the kitchen.
Hermione frowned. “That’s it?”
She breathed out a laugh. “Fine, then.”
Harry lowered his voice and leaned in closer to Luna. “Isn’t it… difficult? You know, after what his family did to you?”
“Right.” Harry said, but his mind was elsewhere already. He was going to lose Draco. “Sure.”
He yanked himself away and,
Harry smiled. “They’re looking forward to it.” It wasn’t a lie, really. Ron and Hermione really were looking forward to it. It’s just the others were… apprehensive. “Listen, don’t worry too much about it. They’re all nice people. And they’ve all forgiven you.”
“Well, I…” He began, and he moved closer to Draco, taking his hand and lacing their fingers together. “
Harry rolled his eyes. “Did you not find it funny?”
“Harry, please tell me you have a plan.” Hermione said, her voice full of concern.
“Well, I guess we should start calling each other by our first names, right, Harry?” Harry tried to pretend as though Malfoy saying his first name in that fucking posh accent didn’t turn him on. But Malfoy had provided them both with an out, and he had smiled at Harry as though nothing had changed. Maybe nothing had.
Draco rolled his eyes, smirking. “I thought the Gryffiindors would be like this, too.” His gaze travelled to Ron and Hermione. “Are you seriously telling me you two
rumour going around that Harry was dating Millicent Bulstrode. He had no clue where it came from, but it had caused havoc all the same. Gryffindors and Slytherins alike were talking about the pair, comparing notes and trying to figure out if it was true. It was shut down rather quickly, but Harry decided that it was perhaps time for it to resurface.
“Well, you can start with Weasley.” Draco said, amusement in his voice. Harry did as he was told, crossing off the name gladly. “And then there’s Black, of course. The only living Black is Andromeda, and she’s not exactly living according to the pureblood agenda. Of course, my mother was a Black, but she’s considered a Malfoy now.” He frowned. “Speaking of which, you’ll have to keep the Malfoy name on there until we work out how to take my parents out of this. After we’ve worked that out, we can cross off my name. There’s
“If we’re ever going to find out what it is, now’s the time.”
Pansy’s frown from behind him. He listened as they left, closing the door on their way back into the common room, and Harry and Malfoy stood in silence for a few more moments.
“Guess this is the end.” Harry put as much malice into his words as possible, but found it difficult to speak to Draco in such a way.
Malfoy also looked up, seeming to be slightly fidgety at the thought of Harry and him having a strong connection.
, and signing his name at the bottom. He took a deep breath before sealing up the letter and handing it to the Weasley’s owl. He watched as the bird took flight and carried away the parchment.
, he thought.
Malfoy grinned. “Excellent! Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”
. And then, when Malfoy had
“Hey, Malfoy! We brought you something.” Ron grinned as he spoke and Harry and Draco stood up to greet them.
“What do you mean?”
His brain was still racing, but he breathed through it and finally,
The rumours were just the beginning. Somehow Harry and Malfoy’s dance had
Harry felt guilt creep up his neck. He had forgotten that he wasn’t the only one involved in his rivalry with Malfoy. His friends were the ones dragging him away every time.
Draco smiled. “I won’t tell a soul.”
Malfoy looked offended. “Of course I’m that good at Occlumency. I likely
“Yeah, well, you see, I noticed that, too. But maybe, if people thought we were together, it would offer you some sort of protection. You know, me being the Chosen One and everything.” Harry hated that name, but he knew that it pissed Malfoy off.
Draco grinned, and Harry could see he was trying not to laugh. “That’s my friend you’re talking about.”
Harry grinned. He already felt much lighter having everybody here. “What did you expect it to be like?”
Ginny smiled. “It’s nice, though.”
“Oh, look at that.” Draco’s voice startled Harry out of his thoughts. He gestured towards the half-empty bottle of firewhiskey with the joint squashed on top of it. “I guess we must have rolled on it.” Draco laughed loudly, and Harry had no choice but to join in.
It was beautiful and terrifying all at once in the sweetest way. It was so good he was sure his teeth would rot from the taste, and he didn’t mind one bit.
It wasn’t as though Harry hadn’t been expecting it. They had barely spoken in the past week and the past month had been ice cold. They still slept in the same bed. They still kissed each other as though they were newlyweds. But they didn’t speak.
“Good morning, Theodore.” Harry said, smiling in Neville’s direction but not distracting him from his reading.
creative.” He said, and he jumped as the cupboard door opened.
“Harry, my…” His voice was quiet, so he cleared his throat and continued. “My father doesn’t… he’s not letting me see you anymore.” He looked up at Harry, and the look on his face made Harry want to cry. He was looking at Harry with fear in his eyes - but not the kind of fear that he had of his father - the kind that he had of Harry. He was afraid Harry would judge him.
Narcissa smiled again. “So I’ve seen. I’ll get out of your hair, boys.” She made her way to the door, but stopped suddenly. “Oh! Draco, I left your favourite book from when you were a child on the tray. I thought you might have wanted some comfort, but… well, you probably don’t want to go upstairs.”
Harry cleared his throat. “They’ll be in Hogsmeade in an hour.” He said. “You’d better get up.”
After a few more minutes, a comfortable silence fell between the two of them. Harry felt as though the seven minutes were almost up, and Draco must have felt the same way, because he spoke rather quickly.
Harry had no idea what to do with himself. He had had such big plans. He was supposed to ask about the tattoo, and demand answers. But, now that he had the chance, he wasn’t sure how to.
He nibbled at Draco’s ear, which seemed to be the last straw for Draco. He let out a moan, and pulled Harry in for another kiss, a long one this time.
Hermione and Ron nodded enthusiastically, and Draco let his gaze travel to the other Gryffindors.
Ron and Hermione shared a look, but didn’t say anything more. Instead, they continued dancing as Harry felt on edge. He wasn’t sure why he was so nervous. All he had to do was ask Malfoy about the tattoo and then leave. That was all. He really didn’t want to stay. Really.
Malfoy clearly saw that Harry was struggling to speak because he laughed and,
Ron smiled up at her sheepishly, his brows furrowed. “It’ll be off by the end of the day?” He tried.
“Of course.” Draco’s voice was a whisper, and Harry loved the way it sounded. There was a short silence as Draco thought of what to say. “You know, after school finishes, Pansy, Blaise and I are planning on going away for a while. There’s a place up north that we all visited as children. We would go during the winter - when the snow would stick - and it was lovely, but a couple of years ago, our parents took us during the summer…” Harry could hear a smile creep into Draco’s voice. “And it was amazing. It was like seeing a whole new town. It was sunny, and warm, and flowers were blooming and it made us forget about all of the bad things in Britain for a little while.” Draco breathed out a laugh, and Harry leaned into it, matching his breaths to Draco’s. “But, there was one day, that was absolutely awful weather. The skies were grey, it was cold as balls, and it was chucking it down with rain. Blaise had decided this would be the
Harry laughed. “I figured as much. But, I can’t give it to you right now.”
Harry continued looking into Malfoy’s eyes, but he could practically
Malfoy didn’t look good. He really didn’t. Harry just wasn’t used to seeing him in muggle clothes, that was all. And, well, he supposed that he was assuming Malfoy would use that god-awful gel in his hair again. But he didn’t. His hair looked loose and soft and slightly curly and Harry was sure he had put glitter in it because it seemed to sparkle slightly. It was just interesting.
Hermione waved off the compliment. “Oh, it’s nothing.”
Harry turned on his side, too. He didn’t know when he and Malfoy had become so able to tell the truth to each other, but he felt oddly comfortable with him. Perhaps it was because they both knew that they would never tell anyone else. After all, they were both in on a pretty big secret together.
Harry shook his head. “People don’t tend to like the idea of butter in their coffee.”
“Harry, you look like a madman.” Draco said, his lips quirking up slightly as he steadied himself from the impact.
Waited for Lucius’ ugly words and their ugly consequences.
“Shit, sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.” He felt guilt gnawing at his stomach.
“You want to know what’s
bad. In Harry’s opinion, the Slytherins weren’t doing much except defending themselves. Although, Harry supposed that his opinion was rather biased these days.
Tonight would be very interesting, indeed.
“It’s okay. I mean, I was trying to cast -” Draco tried to catch Harry’s eye, but Harry avoided it.
Hermione frowned deeply. “I’m not sure. But, you said that you had seen the picture Malfoy drew.” Malfoy seemed to shift in his seat slightly. “So there must be something to that.”
“That’s nice.” He whispered, his eyes falling closed.
Harry tried to reach for Draco’s hand, but he pulled away again. It was a small movement, barely noticeable, but it was there.
“Harry!” Seamus said, leaning forward so he could see Harry’s face.
“Sorry, this is a question, but does he need to know it’s me?”
He looked over to Ron’s bed, saw the way his breaths were deep. Harry couldn’t wake him up. Right now, he wasn’t thinking of his brother. He wasn’t thinking at all. And Hermione, who was in the bed right beside him, wasn’t pretending that she was alright with being away from her parents on Christmas. She was peaceful.
“I’m sad to be leaving, especially now that you’ve got a bun in the oven.”
Harry prepared himself for the worst as Pansy called his name in a sing-song voice.
Harry chuckled. “No, she isn’t, Draco. She’s just… obsessed with keeping you safe, I guess. She’s a lot nicer than I remember her to be.”
“You don’t need to apologise.” Harry was finding this incredibly awkward - and he hadn’t felt awkward around Draco since… well, since their ‘relationship’ started. “Are you doing alright?”
Draco exhaled heavily and walked over to Harry with purpose, so Harry met him in the middle, melting into him as they held each other. They kissed each other hard, but it wasn’t heated. It was beautiful and sweet and Harry thought he could stay like this forever.
Harry breathed out a laugh. He looked over at Ron and Hermione, who were taking a seat next to Blaise. They were chatting, as though they had always been friends, and he even saw Ron smile. It was strange for Harry to see but he loved it all the same.
