They navigate several more contractions in their newly-found position before Healer Powell returns.
“Will it help?”
“I know, but Healer Training will be harder.”
“I know.” Harry shakes his head. At thirty-five weeks pregnant, no one is more aware than him of how much longer he has to go.
“Wow…ok.” Draco falters, genuinely surprised. “That’s not what I expected, honestly.”
“More, Draco. More.”
,” he mutters, activating the vibration charm.
Harry pauses and looks over all four kids.
James’ black hair, so much like his own, is wild from flying and he’s snuggled close with Matthew. They’re feeding each other bits of cookie and stealing quick kisses when they think no one is looking. Both boys’ faces radiate happiness.
“I thought we didn’t want to be outed until the kids know?” Draco asks hesitantly.
“Come in!”
“Please kneel and join your hands on the altar.”
bigger headline than James and Matthew.”
“Is the baby okay?”
“Can you feel it moving yet?”
“But now, let’s discuss a little more about what went on before we picked you up, Matthew.”
“I think it will be informative.”
Hermione launches herself at Harry and hugs him tightly. He wraps his arms around her small frame in return. “You deserve all that and more, Harry. You’ve sacrificed so much of yourself for the kids, and for the whole wizarding world before that. I know you did it willingly and out of love, but it’s ok to want things for
“Wait,” Al interrupts Lily, “did Matthew’s parents kick him out?”
The full weight of Draco’s body presses against him and they are both gasping and panting. Harry can’t remember ever feeling so…satisfied? Complete? Whole? He doesn’t even know how to label it, but it’s wonderful. Everything has slotted firmly into place and he would be content to do this with Draco, to do
“You’d do that?” James looks genuinely surprised.
takes on an unexpected form sometimes. After all, Harry Potter engaged to Draco Malfoy, deeply in love and pregnant, was completely unthinkable a year ago.
“Well, it shouldn’t last long, at least.” Draco rolls his eyes. “After this weekend, there’s only two weeks before the kids come home. And I’m sure you and I will make a
“He did tell me. I was available, so I came on through.” Healer Carr sets down her bag. “Do you think you’re in labour, Mr Potter?”
“He likes that you have a partner. I do, too. And we think it would be good if you got married.”
“I’ve never rimmed someone or been rimmed, either. But I find the idea of rimming you incredibly appealing. I’d like to try being rimmed, as well.”
. Truth be told, while he loved Ginny romantically and he was happy enough with her, what he has with Draco is…more intense. And it feels right in a way he and Ginny didn’t for much longer. Draco fills a part of him he didn’t know was empty.
“Six! Five!”
“Of course,” Harry sighs.
Harry’s core is wrapped in strand after strand of malevolent magic, each twined around several others. It’s being held in check by his powerful benevolent core and Harry suspects if he had a less powerful core, he would already be dead. But that’s the thing with The Boy Who Lived: he has no intention of dying and leaving Draco behind.
“Hungry again?”
their benevolent core magic — until the antidote is administered.” Draco beams proudly. “It should allow the Curse-Breakers to counteract the malevolent magic with no damage to the core.”
“I want to know, Draco.” Harry lifts his head and gives Draco a soft kiss. “I want to know what you like so I can give you pleasure. And I want you to know what I like so you don’t have to worry about doing something I don’t like and we can focus on the parts that feel good.”
There’s no response, so Harry assumes Matthew has nodded, because the next thing they hear is a series of powerful shrinking and packing charms. The snap of a trunk lid and latches is followed by a shrinking spell.
“I think something new.”
there.”
“No one has to, except me, Draco, and your Mind Healer. Possibly the Headmistress if your Mind Healer treats you while at Hogwarts. You can choose who to tell and when to tell them.”
“Absolutely,” Draco nods, clearly on board. “I am on leave from work starting Friday for the summer, and the kids will all be home from Hogwarts, so there will be plenty of hands to help him stay reclining.”
“That sounds like it could be early labour. We’ll have a check.”
“This smells wonderful,” Hermione says, stepping to Harry for a hug. He breathes deeply, comforted by the floral scent of her shampoo that hasn’t changed since they were kids, and holds her close for a moment. She has been his only constant for all these years and having her around grounds him.
“Deeper. Deeper, Draco. I want you all the way inside me,” he whispers to no one.
“Of course.” Erwin is eager to reassure Draco. “Yellow gold or platinum are both available.”
Draco pulls Harry close, kisses his forehead, and wraps him in a tight embrace. “I don’t have any expectations, Harry. If we do nothing more than sleep next to each other, that’s more than adequate. I just want to be
“We love you, too.”
Harry waits until the door is firmly shut behind James before gesturing to the box.
“What’s up, Dad?” James looks quite curious.
Harry obediently lowers his hands and nods. “Yeah.”
Harry’s eyes begin to drift closed, and he feels Draco’s lips brush his own.
The train eases to a stop and the doors slide open. Harry looks anxiously for his children, scanning from one end to the other. As he’s peering down to the end of the train, a tiny body collides with his and arms squeeze around his middle.
. Draco steps towards him, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. His grey eyes are clouded with concern. “You’ve gone dreadfully pale. Harry, what’s the matter?” He guides Harry to a nearby bench and they sit together. The cool temperature of the hard metal seeps through Harry’s jacket and jumper, helping to quell the heat rising inside him. He finally takes a heaving breath, but he still can’t look at Draco.
Sweaty and laughing, Harry yanks open the door to the Quidditch locker room and dashes inside. A quick glance over his shoulder reveals that Draco is gaining on him. He drops his broom on the bench and grasps the fluttering Snitch tighter as he sprints for the storage room to take refuge.
“Well, you’re 35 weeks pregnant, so that’s to be expected. How’s the pain?”
Harry isn’t sure this will get them very far. He’s been over his family tree, at least as much of it as he has, and he really hasn’t seen anything he’d want to name their son. He leans over Draco’s shoulder and points.
Scrambling off her chair, Lily kneels beside her father. Harry takes her hand and places it where Draco’s hand was. Lily is immediately rewarded with a firm press against her hand.
Draco lifts Harry’s chin and cups his cheek gently, then covers Harry’s lips with his own. Harry immediately relaxes into the warmth that emanates from Draco’s body before parting his lips and deepening the kiss. Draco’s tongue slides along his own, gently dancing together and exploring each other.
“No, not since Astoria,” Harry says, shaking his head. “And they didn’t really date. It was an arranged marriage for an heir, not a romantic situation.”
found it hard, and I don’t have the same family history as you.” Harry pauses in thought. “You’ve done so much to leave all that behind; it has to be painful to be forced to rehash it with your own son.”
“Oh, that helps.” Harry closes his eyes and tries to rein in his emotions. This pregnancy will be worth it in the end, but he’s just so fed up with being perpetually helpless and uncomfortable. And tired. So tired. “I’m just so ready to not be pregnant. This is miserable.”
“You’re engaged to
“Honestly, no. They’ve always made nasty comments about LGBTQIA+ issues. I can’t see them changing their minds.”
“Merlin’s wrinkly ballsack!” James cries, eyes immediately the size of saucers.
“That’s the point,” Harry chuckles. He feels his throat catch just a little as Draco reaches over and runs a hand down his body to his cock. He’s still achingly hard but he certainly doesn’t want Draco to feel like he has to reciprocate.
to open me up. And I want
“I sure hope so. I sort of figured we can just tell them that we are in a relationship and let them ask any questions they have.” Harry really hopes Draco is prepared for the barrage of questions he is sure his children will fire at them — being able to ask just about anything and get honest answers. “If the living together doesn’t come up during that, we can bring it up once they’re done.”
“I wish we weren’t in the damned hospital. I have other things I’d like to do for my peace of mind.” Draco’s hand runs down Harry’s side. Harry, too, wishes they could make love one more time, just in case.
Harry stretches out next to Draco in their bed. Dinner with Hermione had been wonderful and they’d all enjoyed good conversation. Harry is thankful that it seems his best friend and his partner are going to be able to navigate a successful friendship. He’s not willing to lose either of them.
A chorus of yeses comes, and Harry levitates seven mugs of steaming liquid to the table where Draco is already seated with a large plate of biscuits.
Draco presses softly and gasps. “There it is.”
Draco shrugs. “Well, now we are, so it won’t matter one way or the other.”
“You ok?” Harry steps towards the strange-looking man standing before him.
Draco’s face is already contorting into anger. “I am going to assume your coming out did not go well?”
“Of course. There’s documented evidence of gay men in most of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. The important thing is that you marry a pure-blood woman and produce an heir.” Distaste becomes evident on Draco’s face. “What you do discreetly on the side can be overlooked. Even the straight men have mistresses.”
. Harry scrawls his signature and stands, turning the folder to face Scorpius.
Keeping his eyes focused on his plate, Harry exhales heavily. “I think I might have feelings for someone.” Harry chances a quick look at Hermione, just in time to see her eyes widen slightly.
“This is not going to go well,” he murmurs into Draco’s skin.
“I know he does.” Al hesitates. “Will you tell me if something is wrong?”
“No. That was totally his decision.”
“She’s flirting. I stood in the doorway and watched the whole thing. She’s interested in you. Romantically.” Draco runs both hands through his hair in exasperation. “I know you can be a bit slow on the uptake, but
“We’re ok. We’ll figure this out.” Harry scoots to one side of the narrow hospital bed and turns on his side. “Lay with me?”
“You’re amazing, Harry. You’re birthing our son. Regulus is almost here. I’ve never been more in love with you than I am in this very moment.”
“I need the loo. Can you help me up?”
James does as he’s told and places his hands gently on Harry.
“Comfy?” Draco asks, lowering his tea from overhead to take a sip.
Harry is not looking forward to this part. He stretches out a hand and silently summons one of the many books on male fertility and pregnancy Hermione had found for him.
Scorpius nods and Blaise hands Harry an official-looking folder, which he opens and lays on the altar. Hermione produces a quill and hands it to Draco, who bends over the folder and signs his name, before passing the quill to Harry.
“You’re welcome,” Malfoy returns, busying himself with his own tea. Harry slides him the milk and sugar, watching as Malfoy takes two spoons of sugar before returning the milk and sugar to the tray. Malfoy looks up at Harry and hesitates. A heavy silence stretches several seconds before Malfoy’s face arranges itself into something resembling determination. “Albus told Scorpius he thinks you’re going to have trouble coping with Lily starting Hogwarts. He’s concerned about you being left alone and asked Scorpius to see if I would check in on you.” A hint of a smirk dances across Malfoy’s features. ”I promised both boys I’d make sure you didn’t throw yourself on the tracks.”
“I’ll take care of that tonight after the kids go to bed. Don’t let me forget to put a silencing charm on our bedroom.”
“Really good, Dad. I wasn’t kidding in my letters or back at the platform.” The smile Al flashes as he crosses to his dresser again is a genuine grin. “Healer Marris is still great; he’s helped me start journaling and learning ways to cope. But I think the potion is making the most difference now that it’s been a few weeks. I can breathe easier, and my brain has room for more than panic.“
Harry feels Draco’s lips touch his temple.
Healer Powell fails to withhold a gasp when he peers through the eyepiece. “What did you do?”
Harry decides to forge ahead. “Do you like penetrative sex?”
“Caffeine is always welcome.” Harry chuckles. “I do seem to require less of it now that the kids are off at school.”
of you go anywhere by yourself. No one goes in any pair or group unless at least one of you has a mobile. Check in with us when you go into and out of a store. Just a quick text so we know where to find you in an emergency. Ignore the press if they show up. If they get closer than two meters, call Draco or me immediately.”
“Yes. Please.” Harry nods, unable to peel his gaze away from the little lips and nose and eyes that make up his and Draco’s son.
There’s a soft kiss on Harry’s lips, and Draco’s hands are washing Harry’s hair as well as his own, then washing Harry’s body and guiding him under the water for a rinse. Draco shuts off the water and reaches outside the shower before handing Harry a towel. Harry buries his face in the soft, plush material only to discover that Draco had apparently cast a warming charm over it before he got in the shower.
“How did it go?”
“Mr Potter, how are you feeling?” She conjures her table and begins to set up her equipment.
Draco chuckles and Harry reaches out and rests his hand on Draco’s chest. “I suppose I’d like to see if we are as compatible romantically as I think we might be,” Harry continues. “And if we are, I’d like this to go somewhere serious. And long term. I don’t want a fling.”
Harry gives Draco a brief tour of the house, leaving out the attic and his children’s bedrooms, but spending a bit of extra time in the study, before guiding him back downstairs and throwing open the French doors leading to the back patio. The sun is drifting down toward the horizon, setting the sky on fire. Draco steps past Harry, gazing around the sprawling yard.
Harry darts a concerned glance at Draco’s face. He doesn’t look mad, but his voice seems to indicate otherwise. Harry shrugs. “She wanted my opinion on a particularly tight tangle of magic. I was just taking a look for her.”
“Are you prone to bursts of accidental magic?”
Something moves the cold thing away from his abdomen. A soft incantation is spoken by an unknown voice, and Harry has the bizarre sensation of his body slowly taking on its own weight. The wash begins over his toes, and he’s never been so aware of his feet. The slow-motion wave takes what feels like several minutes to reach his abdomen, but with it comes the reassuring feeling of the hard mass between his hips. The baby is still there.
Harry bites his tongue before he can say he never was. “Is she in Slytherin?”
“James, just because I’d rather you not be having sex doesn’t mean I’m going to forbid it or pretend it’s not going to happen. I’d rather you have everything you need to be smart and safe.”
A few minutes pass and Harry is finally able to lift his head to take the water glass Draco offers, swishing the cool liquid in his mouth and spitting it out. He finally looks at Draco, who is ruffled from sleep but looking very concerned.
“How do I do the contraception spell?”
The Healer nods. “It’s a lot to take in, especially if you didn’t know Mr Potter could carry.”
“Are you…okay with carrying a child?” Draco’s voice waivers. Harry’s unsure exactly what he’s asking, but he’s pretty sure Draco wants to know if he’s thinking about termination.
Harry shakes his head. He’s not usually one for stomach bugs, so he doesn’t keep it in their potion cupboard.
his wand, waving it over Harry’s forehead and studying the numbers that appear.
“Really good. Yours?”
“I’m ready,” he pants. “I want you.”
“Fuck, Harry. Do you have any idea how amazing you look like this? Spread open, hole dripping, waiting for my cock?” Harry feels the blunt press of Draco’s head against his hole. Draco pushes forward and Harry’s rim stretches and he feels Draco hesitate.
Hair as controlled as it gets, vision charm in place, wand in his holster, Harry is as ready as he can be. After all, there’s nothing to be done about the fluttering nerves in his stomach. He stands in front of the fireplace and places both hands on the mantle, leaning on it for a moment and taking a deep breath. Tossing powder into the Floo, Harry calls “Center for Rare Magical Maladies” and steps into the flames.
Harry isn’t sure if Draco means orgasms or otherwise, but he nods into Draco’s neck. “Ok. Yeah…ok.” Harry’s finding it incredibly reassuring to have someone taking care of him. He’s always been on his own or been the caretaker, but this…this having someone looking at him and knowing his needs and taking care of them with no expectations of reciprocation…makes him feel wonderful and cherished and…loved.
“Let me see it.” Harry sits completely upright, voice harsh as he cuts off the Healer’s explanation.
“It would, if the strain was significant enough.”
“You’re right. I’m not. The look on your face was totally worth it.” Harry runs his hand through Draco’s hair. “And I might be persuaded to give up the Snitch for a kiss.”
Harry pushes himself into a seated position and gratefully accepts the cup. Bringing it to his lips, he inhales the rich aroma before taking a sip. The warmth that spreads in his belly is partially from the coffee, and partially because Draco has remembered exactly what he drinks from Costa from the
He steps aside. “Hi. You look fantastic. Come on in?”
“I’ll be right here.”
Harry’s palms flatten against the wet shower walls, scrabbling for something to grip where nothing exists. Draco’s tongue presses past his entrance, and his hips involuntary thrust back, eager for more of that delicious sensation.
Draco heaves an uncertain sigh. “Very well.” Harry shifts away, turning over to face Draco and giving his best encouraging smile urging Draco to continue. “What would you like out of this? Out of us? Where do you want this to go, I suppose is my question?”
“You’re not the only one.”
“Perfect. James, you know all of this and you know it very well. You should be proud of yourself.” Harry’s certainly proud of his son and how hard he’s worked this summer. Both Draco and Hermione had taken to tutoring him and neither had gone easy on him.
“Literally anything,” Harry smirks back. “Sometimes it’s a little shocking what they’ll talk to me about, actually.”
“I will see you gentlemen next week. I’ll show myself out.”
Harry can’t quite wrap his brain around how much of their previous conversations Draco has taken to heart. He’s repeating details Harry hasn’t mentioned since the first time they went to tea.
“I would love to.”
“We can do both of those things tomorrow. You’ll have to take him to Muggle London for the phone. I obviously can’t be among Muggles looking as pregnant as I do.”
“I’m glad to hear that.”
“James!” Harry calls up the stairs. “Let’s go!”
“I was on the platform after I put the kids on the train to Hogwarts. I guess I’d been standing there a while.” Harry shrugs one shoulder. “He came up and checked on me, then asked me for a cup of tea.
Draco eases out of the kiss, and Harry nearly wells up with the love radiating from Draco’s molten silver eyes.
“Sure. Let me finish getting myself together and I’ll be right over.” Harry’s heart soars at the thought of spending more time with Draco.
“I mean, will you get some for me?”
“How long do I have to keep it down?”
“Of course it worked! You sent a
“The baby took a bit to sink in for us, too,” Harry laughs. “Draco and I were both taken by surprise.”
“Come on in!” Draco is always so anxious to get a glimpse at the baby; Harry finds it absolutely adorable. He has to admit he’s anxious today, too, as he puts aside his tea and settles flat on the bed. Draco perches next to him and reaches for Harry’s hand.
As wonderful as the room is, the man standing in it putting away the last of the clothes and blankets is even better. Harry can’t understand how someone as caring and protective and wonderful as Draco could be
“It was. It
“It really only matters for me, though. Al’s not likely to have a cock in his arse, is he?”
Draco steps to the middle of the nursery and lifts his wand, complex movements and strings of Latin sending silver wisps of Magic dancing around the room before settling on the walls. All the constellations represented in their family now twinkle against that beautiful blue. He steps back to the door and both men survey his work.
“I love you,” Harry whispers against his lips.
“Not upset, but I didn’t expect you to laugh at me!” Harry tries to appear affronted, but all he can feel is relief. He needs Hermione and he wants Draco, and he desperately doesn’t want to have to choose between the two.
“I can feel where my womb is. It feels like someone’s put a very heavy and hard ball in my abdomen. But I can’t feel any movement yet. Probably in the next month, though.” Harry smiles in anticipation of feeling their child move.
Anything Harry thinks might help when he’s contracting, they try. Draco rubs his back, presses his hips together, and rocks their entwined bodies back and forth in turn, but nothing can actually quell the feeling of being turned inside out.
“Oh, I didn’t know she was coming over tonight.”
Harry huffs softly. “I could say the same about you.”
“We haven’t been out publicly as a couple yet because we wanted to tell you first. We do plan to be out publicly with the four of you over the break and by ourselves from here on out, so there will probably be press.” Draco’s voice takes on a firmer tone. “Harry and I do not want you kids to take any of the brunt of whatever the press cooks up. I want you to tell us immediately if you’re being harassed by reporters or photographers, okay?”
“That seems to be the case.” Harry can’t help the smile he gives to Lily, who is so excited to be a big sister. “I’m supposed to do as much walking as I can, so I think Draco and I are going to take a stroll down to the pitch to start with and see how it goes.”
“Let’s go join the boys and once we’re done picking out furniture, we can send them elsewhere and let the press do their leering at us. At least that might keep them away from the kids.”
Draco barrels in behind him.
“I do.”
“Let’s try Wood and Wand. They usually have nice pieces that aren’t…ostentatious.” Draco smirks. “Unless ostentatious is what you’re going for.”
Harry’s heart breaks all over again as Matthew’s tears start anew. James pulls his boyfriend into his arms again, rubbing his back soothingly.
The silver tendril of magic tightens against their skin and Draco gasps softly
Harry’s head suddenly spins as the connection opens and he closes his eyes as he waits for everything to settle. Opening his eyes, he’s met with Draco’s smiling face. And —
“Brilliant! I told Mina I would see if she can come visit. She wants me to come to her house again, too!” She squeezes next to Harry in the recliner and snuggles into his chest. “I’m really glad to be home.”
“I’ve been working on this core imaging most of the afternoon. It’s fallen apart a dozen times at least, and I haven’t been able to figure out why.” Harry heaves a deep sigh. ”I wanted to have it sent over to the Curse-Breakers by the time I left today, but it just collapsed. Again.”
Picking up the remote, Harry settles more towards the middle and presses play. “I’m sure she would. I’ll ask her when I talk to her next.” He pulls the popcorn bowl onto the couch between them.
Draco hands Harry one of the shrunken trunks and they head for the stairs. They lay both trunks on the bedroom floor before unshrinking them, and Harry drags his trunks in from the hallway.
“I don’t think that’s an impression she would appreciate.”
“Good. We’re on the same page.” Draco’s voice is barely above a whisper but his words make relief spread through Harry’s gut.
“Agreed. They’re also delusional if they think I’d share.”
Harry catches Draco’s eye and they share a smile, both wondering when the kids will figure out their secret. He feels like the rings on their fingers are very conspicuous, and it honestly feels a bit strange to be wearing a ring again.
Draco leads Harry by the hand into the en-suite, reaching in to start the shower, then turning his attention to Harry’s body. He slides Harry’s shirt over his head and lets it fall to the floor before reaching for his joggers and pants.
, something gets taken away.
Harry directs the popcorn to the coffee table and reaches out to take both glasses of wine in his hands. He passes one to Draco as they sit down on opposite ends of the couch.
Harry’s tears spill over.
Eventually, the contractions begin to intensify, and Harry has to lean on Draco. He moans into his husband’s chest and his ear is filled with quiet whispers. “I love you. You’re amazing. I know this hurts but you’re birthing our son. I can’t tell you what that means to me.”
“I’ll do that when I call for your records.”
Harry hooks a foot around one of the barstools at the counter and slides it out. “Make yourself comfortable.” He moves to light the hob and reaches for the olive oil. “Does this wine need to go on ice?”
“This Saturday?” Her brow is furrowed.
Harry releases the catch on the box and the paint flies before settling nearly around the top half of the room. The midnight blue goes beautifully with the white beadboard that covers the bottom part of the walls.
imaging of damaged magical cores and peel away the benign magic, working to identify the Dark Magic. Then the Curse-Breakers figure out how to break the hold the Dark Magic has on the magical core without harming the witch or wizard.
“It’s not like they don’t know we kiss, Draco. Not to mention I’m pregnant, and they all know how that happens, too.”
“You feel fantastic. Are you all right?”
“What do you think, Regulus? Should your daddies get your nursery ready?”
“I think it’s great.” Harry isn’t at all surprised at Lily’s response.
“Bigger! I’m still tired, but the nausea finally seems to be relenting. I’ve only been nauseous two mornings this week. I also think I felt the baby move today. It was a bit like a fish wiggling.”
“Deep breath in and push, Harry!” A voice he doesn’t recognise is encouraging him, but he doesn’t care.
“You’re welcome, Son.”
“Do you have everything you need? Including anything you and Matthew may need?”
“Do you feel like you’re making any progress?”
“Were you comfortable with everything you’ve done?”
Harry sags as the wave of pain finally begins to subside.
“So what
“I don’t use a wand for magic at home.”
“Holy shit, Draco. Don’t tease me.”
“Absolutely. If it goes absolutely awful, we can bring him here for the rest of the break and figure it out from there.” Draco closes his eyes for a moment. “I won’t let another child feel like I felt. He shouldn’t be made to feel dirty or worthless just because he’s attracted to men. It took me years to be truly okay with my sexuality after what my parents said.”
“Draco?” His voice sounds weak and hoarse to his own ears.
happy. Tired, and a bit unwell thanks to this little one, but very happy.”
“As soon as we get home. I’m not even going to unpack my trunk, just in case.”
Draco chuckles. “What he means is: We’re getting married Saturday.”
“Albus,” Harry sighs and takes Draco’s hand. “Yes, I’m still ill—”
“Then you’ll be here eventually yourself.”
“Maybe sixty seconds. It’ll work within two or three minutes.”
“Draco, please accept this ring as an outward symbol of our bond. With this ring, I thee wed.”
“A relationship,” Draco clarifies.
Harry feels suddenly just a little shy. “I wouldn’t have minded if you did.”
“Albus? What do you want to know?”
Harry hands Draco the other cup of tea, which he holds aloft while Harry settles between his legs on the couch. Harry lays back against Draco’s chest and tangles their legs together.
Harry lifts one hand to run through his hair and exhales heavily again. “And now, based on what you said, it sounds like Voldemort managed to kill my wife, even after I’d gotten rid of him.”
“I love you, too, Harry. I still don’t know how I managed to get this lucky.”
“The baby looks good, but Mr Potter, you must try to rest more, and eat more. Your body will take from you to protect the baby, but if you don’t sustain your body, it can eventually cause the baby harm.”
“I want you to let me know if you start requiring wand work where you wouldn’t normally.”
Everything seems to freeze for just a moment, save for the pixies doing the tango in Harry’s chest. But then Draco slides the spoon from his mouth, drops his hand, and closes his eyes as he tastes, and Harry shuffles back just a bit and resumes breathing.
“We’ll hit the Apothecary and Gringotts after lunch, and then we can do whatever you feel up to doing. Just don’t overdo it.”
“I want Matthew to know he’s loved and welcome here.”
“I’ve never been in a relationship where public affection is a thing,” Draco says thoughtfully. “But I very much enjoyed holding your hand when we’ve been in Muggle London, as well as holding you and kissing you.”
“Bottoms up!” he grimaces. “Be prepared. It tastes awful.”
“Agreed.” Draco smiles softly and cups Harry’s cheek in his hand. “Only a few weeks more. Then we can stop hiding away.”
Patiently, Draco wipes his face and runs a comforting hand up and down his back until he’s able to sit up for water again.
A second silver tendril is drawn from Harry’s left hand, looped and settled on Draco’s right.
Harry stomps down the stairs to the kitchen and sets about making a couple of sandwiches. He desperately wishes that he knew what was or wasn’t going on between him and Draco. At the very least, he wants to know what Draco is feeling towards him.
“No,” Draco says flatly.
“I am. Do you want to Side-Along with me or are you feeling up to the Floo?”
“Thank you,” Harry says, once he’s got his feet beneath him. He laces his fingers with Draco’s. “Lead the way.”
Harry stares back into those silvery eyes and nods. Draco’s hands move to cup Harry’s face and Harry’s lightly grips Draco’s hips and everything starts moving a little slower. And then Draco’s soft lips are on his and it’s better than he ever could have imagined.
“You’re pregnant,” Draco admonishes gently. “You’re growing our son. That’s the furthest thing from useless I can think of.”
He swims towards consciousness.
, which seemed like…an interesting choice. I made popcorn and we had more wine and—” Harry stops abruptly as his memory is jogged. “Oh! He wants to know if you’ll help him ward a telly for his flat.”
“Yes.”
Draco sputters much like Harry had during the original question.
Scorpius grins, looking relieved, and Harry feels his own nerves settle just a little bit.
“Is that the sanitiser and lube, then?”
“I love you so much,” Draco murmurs into his ear.
Draco chuckles softly and spreads a hand over Harry’s stomach. Regulus immediately gives the hand a good thump. Draco gasps and Harry grins.
The tender motion becomes firmer before Draco’s finger finally slips inside. Harry gasps and immediately presses back, eager for that delicious feeling to continue. Fuck, his cock is already leaking and Draco only has one fingertip in. Merlin, it’s so much better when it’s — nggh… — Draco’s finger inside him instead of his own.
“I bet it’s Hermione. She mentioned she wanted to chat this week.”
Harry studies the case in his hands.
“It was so nice to be out with you, but I much prefer when you look like you.”
They slowly drift back to earth and Harry gently pushes Draco’s head from the crook of his neck to kiss him softly.
Of course, I don’t care.” Hermione rolls her eyes emphatically. “Would you stop beating around the proverbial bush and spit it out?”
“Do you have a preference for topping or bottoming?”
“Yes, Draco. I’m so close. I’m so close,” Harry pants, his body strung as tight as a cord. Harry chants, “Oh Merlin, oh Merlin, oh Merlin,” like a prayer.
“Lily also asked, point-blank, if we are having sex.”
“Yeah, that doesn’t go away.” Harry starts to laugh but yawns instead.
“How do we do this?” Draco slides into a seat at the kitchen table with a full plate as Harry sits across from him.
“We’ll join them shortly. I really just wanted thirty seconds alone with you.” Draco pulls Harry close. “Today has been rather intense, and while I’m glad our ‘first outing’ will be behind us, it’s just exhausting. I don’t know how you’ve put up with this for so long.”
“Mm-hmm,” Harry smiles and closes his eyes. Harry has been pleased with how easily he and Draco bridged from friends to dating and he’s even more thrilled with how compatible they seem to be sexually. Harry had been afraid reality wouldn’t live up to his fantasy and instead, it seems to be even better.
“We’re hoping that the four of you will be ok with the Malfoys staying here over break, as Draco has already been living here with me for about a month.” Harry pauses and takes in the faces of the four children. James seems…pleased maybe? Lily looks excited. Al and Scorpius are looking at each other and smiling.
He bends and kisses Harry before leaving the room. When footsteps descend the stairs, Harry manoeuvres his swollen body to an upright position, leaning against the headboard, before pressing his glasses to his face.
“Really?” Draco’s expression changes from concern to excitement as he crosses the room and perches on the couch next to Harry’s legs.
“I’m so happy for you both. We’ll all be waiting at the altar.” Her heels click across the floor as she heads back out to the garden.
“Draco.” There comes a point where this question is no longer cute. Harry has reached that point. “If I start to feel worse, I will tell you. I promise.”
“Scorpius!” Harry interrupts. “Breathe! Can you at least tell me what
“We are raising all five of our children
“Draco, do you freely give your love to Harry, to be bonded to him in body, magic, and soul for the rest of eternity?”
Harry groans, but he knows Draco is right. He snuggles down in the covers and Draco kisses his forehead.
Harry hesitates. Yes, he’s hungry, but his primary concern is less what’s for dinner and more not having another awful night. He takes advantage of pressing the button to call the elevator to gather his thoughts and maybe a little of his courage. He looks around to make sure they’re alone and reaches to squeeze Draco’s hand.
“Excuse me?” Draco’s voice is hesitantly strained and quite obviously confused.
“Lube,” Draco and Harry reply simultaneously, making James laugh.
“True.” Harry is reluctant to let this go, but he also knows Draco is right. He loves his work, but he doesn’t
“What about the baby?”
“Just a rough conversation with Scorp. He’s having a bit of a hard time wrapping his brain around this. It’s come as three pretty quick big events for him, and he’s never had to grapple with me even dating before.”
Harry hunches over his Magiscope in the Department of Dark Magic Damage Research lab. Eyes pressed to the eyepiece, he stares intensely into the dark box and studies the streaks of light that each indicates a different piece of magic at work on the magical core imaged in front of him. He lifts his wand and gently peels away the layers he knows to be benign magic, then huffs softly with released tension as they pull away easily and aren’t entangled with the darker magic he can see in subsequent layers.
“Draco, I don’t think I can do this.”
Harry raises a hand and waits for his phone to land in his palm.
. He’s perfect. He’s absolutely perfect.” Draco is awestruck. “Harry. You made him, grew him in your body. I love you so much.”
“Of course,” she stutters. “Right this way.”
“Is there one that you’d like, love?” Harry steers Draco’s attention back to the large selection of men’s engagement rings. He knows only one of them will propose and he’s sure it will probably be Draco, but he wants both of them to wear that sign of their commitment. As much as he likes the idea of wearing a ring from Draco, he’s equally anxious for Draco to wear a ring from him, as well.
“Here. Let's get comfortable.”
“We’d talked about you and I both having tellies and mobiles over dinner,” Harry explains, smiling at Hermione’s expression. “He asked me if I thought you’d be willing to ward a telly for him. I told him I’d ask.”
“The headline is better than it could be, I suppose. At least it’s not ‘Saviour to Wed Death Eater’s Son,” Draco quips.
Harry is actually proud of himself for waiting as long as he did. “You left at two. I didn’t even get in the shower until five.”
“You’re welcome, Mr Potter. I’ll see myself out.” With a wave of her wand, her bag is packed and her table vanishes, then she’s descending the stairs.
“I know, love. I wish I could take away your pain, but every single contraction brings us closer to meeting our son. I can’t wait to see Regulus in your arms.”
“Of course.”
“Yes. And we use them every time.”
“Inflames the brain, perennial, flowering plant, the flowers are white.”
They move to stand and, even as his mind is racing with what he’s just learned, Harry realises he misses the touch of Draco’s hand as soon as it’s withdrawn. He also realises just how comforting he’s finding Draco’s presence in this suddenly mental upheaval.
Neat golden curls surround his erection — impressive in both looks and size. Harry is quite excited (and maybe a bit scared) to see that Draco is even larger than the dildo he’s used when fantasising about the man.
Harry had remained mostly nausea-free and been able to eat, and by 6 a.m., Draco had been watching the hallway for any sign of Healer Powell. As soon as the discharge orders had been signed, they had been escorted to a private Apparition point, then Draco had gathered Harry close and Side-Alonged him home.
Harry finds himself choked up and he nods. “I like that.”
Draco’s arms hold him tight. “That sounds wonderful.”
The two men meet at the bed, sliding under the covers as Draco opens the letter between them.
Harry waits for the nausea to subside, then nods. Draco passes him the potion and supports him as Harry tips his head back to take it. Vanishing the sick and casting a cleaning charm for Harry’s mouth, Draco puts the basin back on the table and pulls Harry against his shoulder, holding him while they wait for the potion to kick in.
“All right, let’s see what we have here.” Healer Carr begins casting over Harry, watching intently as spells provide numbers and change colours. Several of the spells are uncomfortable and Harry squeezes Draco’s hand as they run through him.
“We want our baby,” Harry says firmly.
“Yes?”
“That’s wonderful. The next thing I’d like to check is to see if your magic is properly forming a birth canal. Are you familiar with male childbirth?”
“Yes.”
“Does what hurt, exactly?” Harry needs some clarification.
“Healer Carr did say it could get worse before it gets better.”
“May I have the rings?”
“The library or the whole thing?” Harry teases.
“Why Sunday, Mr Malfoy?”
. He hears a movement-sensing charm go off and knows that means Draco will be in soon. Everything he tries to quell his nausea is useless, and he just ends up heaving to the point of tears, muscles sore from his earlier bout of vomiting.
“Rules,” Harry says firmly. “
“More recent than me, though.”
Both men turn towards the kitchen and spot Cupcake outside the French doors.
Draco shifts and Harry feels Draco’s hard cock against his own. Draco wraps his hand around them both and begins stroking them together. Harry moans at the sensation of soap and cocks and hand all sliding together.
And Lily is chattering away to Draco, telling him all about her visit to Mina’s house the day before. She’s endlessly fascinated by the way Muggles live with no magic in the house at all, and she’s explaining it all to Draco at high speed, hands gesticulating just as rapidly. She’s preening under Draco’s attention, so proud of her first visit to a Muggle home.
“Contraception aside, do you have any other questions?” Draco asks.
“Kind of in the middle.”
A satisfied rumble comes from Draco’s chest, and then a hint of a moan.
“You almost fainted. I gave you a mild version of Pepper-Up to prevent you from completely losing consciousness.” Healer Carr’s voice is more serious than before. “Your body is struggling, Mr Potter. You really must eat more and rest as much as possible. I’m afraid you’re going to land in St Mungo’s if you don’t.”
Harry apparates to the lane leading to Potter Cottage and strolls towards the house. It was late afternoon, nearly evening, before he and Malfoy —
“Fair point.” Draco chuckles and toes off his shoes to slide in next to Harry. “Now, rest. We’ll worry about the next steps after you get some sleep.”
There’s a pregnant pause while Hermione appears to gather herself.
Harry closes his eyes and never hears Draco come back in.
“Yes, love?” Draco shifts to look at him.
“Do you think you’ll want to carry someday?” Draco asks carefully.
When Draco speaks, his voice thick with emotion, Harry knows he must be feeling the same way.
“Salazar, yes. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever been better.” Draco kisses him again and then slowly pulls his cock from Harry’s arse and lays down beside him. Harry hisses and he knows his face screws up with pain.
“You don’t care if we’re having sex here?” Matthew asks, seemingly disbelievingly.
Harry turns to Draco with a quick smile. “I do now. I didn’t, growing up.” Harry slides chicken into the skillet and moves back to work on the sauce. “The Dursleys — my aunt and her family — made me do all the cooking from the time I was tall enough to reach the hob. I hated it then, but after the war, after spending that last year never having more than heated tins of food or scraps of bread, I started to find it relaxing. Comforting, even.”
Harry can’t help but grin, and Draco beams right alongside him.
Draco deepens the kiss and Harry obligingly opens his mouth, wondering if Draco can taste himself in Harry’s mouth. Harry finds himself on his back, being pushed into the mattress by Draco’s weight, tongue in his mouth, fingers in his hair, and a hand on his chest.
“I don’t think so. It’s the same discomfort I’ve been battling; I just can’t get it to go away.”
“Draco and I will find someone reputable and discreet for you. Do you want to wait until Easter break to start seeing someone, or would you like us to arrange for you to see them privately while you’re at school?”
“I’ve missed you, too,” Harry murmurs. Hermione has been one of the few consistent people in his life for over a decade. He
The young man seated at the side of the table looks lost and scared, and Harry hates that Matthew feels this uncertain.
“Erwin, could you make note of these two rings for us so we have the information when we’re ready for it?”
Harry both hears and feels Draco’s breath hitch. His stomach drops and he’s certain he’s pushed too far too fast.
“Mr Potter, you’re pregnant.”
“Our children are meddling,” Draco counters. Harry lifts his head to quirk an eye at Draco.
arm in arm.
Hermione shoots Harry a playful glare.
The door opens and Draco slips back into their bed, pressing a kiss to Harry’s temple.
“There’s an awful lot you can do without having sex, James.” Harry shakes his head just a bit. “Write and tell me if you decide there’s something you need, okay?”
Draco’s tongue begins a steady rhythm of thrusts in and out of Harry, and a hand snakes around his hips to allow fingers to caress his rock-hard erection and tug at his balls.
“I was up late talking to Carina Demont. She’s in our year.”
By the time they are finished with lunch and ready to head home, they’ve chosen a beautiful, modern ebony four-poster bed with matching dressers, nightstands, and wardrobes. The mirror Draco mentioned has been added on, as well as a dressing bench they both loved. Together with the rest — bedding, paint charm, rugs and decor — Harry can actually close his eyes and picture
“Mm-hmm…”
Harry laughs and leans heavily on Draco, who helps heave his burgeoning body to an upright position. “Very well. I’ll text her.”
“Healer Powell, my pregnancy isn’t public knowledge. Neither is our engagement. While I’m not concerned about the engagement becoming public, we haven’t told our kids I’m pregnant yet. I don’t want anyone letting that slip to the media.”
“She called on the Floo not long after I woke up. She has some more books for you and a couple of new DVDs. I asked if she wanted to come on through and wait for you to wake up. She offered to bring dinner. She got here about fifteen minutes ago.”
“I love you so much, Harry. I’ve never been so proud of anyone in my life. Our
“I do.” Draco doesn’t look entirely thrilled about this, but frankly, Harry isn’t either. “That’s why I chose somewhere Muggle tonight.“
“Your canal is forming well thus far. We will regularly perform checks during your prenatal treatment to make sure it continues, but usually, if there is an issue, it would be complete agenesis, which you do not have.”
“I don’t think we can wait until the Easter hols. Someone’s growing too fast.” Harry lays his hand on top of Draco’s. “I suppose we could ask Minerva to allow them home for a weekend.”
“Ahh. Is this something we should discuss at home?”
Al is hiccupping and sobbing all over again.
“Let’s move on in before we cause a ruckus.” Draco and Harry herd all five children into the restaurant.
“Draco, do you accept Harry’s gift of love in body, magic, and soul?”
He settles back against his pillows and watches their children take turns holding their new brother. In some ways, starting over with parenting after twelve years is terrifying, but he wouldn’t trade his current life for anything. He never imagined life could look like this; loving husband, beautiful kids, and happier than he can ever remember being. Lacing his fingers through Draco’s, he squeezes lightly. His husband turns to look at him.
“Tell her ‘thank you’ for me, please. I’ll go arrange for it to be delivered.” Draco steps away towards the electronics counter to purchase his telly. Harry’s gaze lingers on Draco’s retreating form for several seconds, then his fingers move furiously over his phone the instant Draco steps away.
“Yes, love?”
Harry isn’t sure what emotion is climbing his throat, but he’s certain it’s a good one.
Healer Carr nods, exposing Harry’s abdomen and casting over him, quill moving furiously over her parchment. “It’s about time for that, so it probably was. It won’t be too long before Mr Malfoy can feel it, as well.”
“Of course.”
“Not in the least.” Harry laughs, feeling his face heat. “We talked about it, though. In detail.”
“Yes. Incredibly happy. I just didn’t realise I was unhappy before. I didn’t mean to make my kids worry.”
Harry sinks down on the couch and exhales. Despite the difficult revelation about what might have caused Ginny’s core to haemorrhage, he’s had a very enjoyable day with Draco. Unfortunately, he’s now more confused about what exactly is transpiring between them than he was before.
“Me, too.” Draco’s voice holds so much emotion. “I didn’t know how much I needed you until I had you.”
“It was fine.”
Harry laughs softly and goes back to toying with the edge of the soft pillow. “I’m absolute shite at the flirting-and-showing-initial-interest part of a relationship, Draco. If I was better at it, perhaps you’d have seen that I definitely return the affection, and I’m open to…being pursued romantically.”
“This isn’t from Lily.”
“I know what it’s like, Potter. I know what it’s like to put your child on the train and watch them pull away and have no one waiting for you at home. Let’s go have a cup of tea. It will get you off the platform, at least.”
“Right this way Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter,” she says, leading them through a door and to a large pod with floor-to-ceiling windows all the way around.
“I’d like that.”
“So much…”
Harry is astounded at the conviction and sincerity in the grey eyes locked on his. He already knows Malfoy has been working to improve his family name. He works at the Center for Rare Magical Maladies, a philanthropic organization, and has made sure funds for war victims and groups that were traditionally discriminated against had sufficient and ongoing resources. But that isn’t what Malfoy takes pride in. He takes pride in raising his son to be a good man.
“I wouldn’t mind in the least.” Harry follows Draco to the front door of the Malfoys’ penthouse. Draco opens the door and ushers Harry though, placing his hand on the small of Harry’s back for a fleeting moment. Heat skitters up Harry’s spine at the touch.
“You’re
“Who have you sent Mr Malfoy to get?”
By the time they’ve discussed the pregnancy thus far and Albus’ Mind Healer situation, Harry is waning. After his third stifled yawn, Draco lays a hand on his knee.
“We’re thinking about adding a game room, at least one more bathroom, and a couple more bedrooms.” Draco eyes Hermione as he continues. “Possibly a library so we can get some of the books out of the study.”
“What do you want, Draco?”
She turns and heads for the stairs, Harry following several paces behind. He knows she’s going to have a fit when she opens the door to his bedroom. His entire wardrobe is strewn on the bed.
That, Harry knows, is a smile he hears in Draco’s voice. Relief and something akin to joy flood his body and the pillow is released from his grip.
They step out of the Apparition point and head for Pasta Magia.
“I never know with those three. At least it means they should be okay with everything when we tell them. I do think we may need to have a talk with James over the break, though. It sounds like he and Matthew are getting more serious.”
Harry stares blankly back at him, hearing Draco’s earlier words on repeat.
“I can’t unsee that, you know.” Footsteps retreat and Draco kisses Harry again softly.
Draco’s eyes widen as Harry speaks, his grip on Harry’s hand tightening.
Healer Powell hands Draco a small stack of photographs before siphoning the potion off Harry’s stomach.
“I will,” he promises and swirls away.
Having secured the interview with the Center for Rare Magical Maladies for Thursday, Harry had stood in front of his wardrobe and had a minor freak out. Save for the annual Day of Remembrance at Hogwarts, he hadn’t dressed for anything fancier than taking the kids out to dinner in eleven years. He’d rifled through his everyday trousers and denims, all of them obviously out, and he was pretty sure that his one pair of formal dress robes would also be inappropriate.
“Well, not just that,” Harry admits somewhat sheepishly. “He owled me yesterday and asked if I wanted to get dinner.”
“Promise?”
“This…” Draco’s voice catches, and he has to clear his throat to continue. “This is where I found you on the floor. And there were several times this last week I didn’t know if I’d get to have you home again. And I knew I loved our child before this, but I didn’t realise just how much I wanted this baby until we almost lost it. I’m so relieved to have you both home safe.”
“Want company?”
“Much better now.”
“Thanks, Hermione.” Harry smiles at her and she nods, following the children up the stairs. He looks back at Draco, who seems a little harried.
“I’ll help you up, but you’re not getting down on the hearth, Harry. I’ll Floo Minerva. You text Hermione and have her come over. I want to see her face when you tell her.”
After some careful manoeuvring, Harry is on his side and Draco is spooned against his back. Long, thin fingers rub his arms, his belly, his hips.
The kids all move forward to hug him, Scorpius included. “I love all four of you very much. Have a good term, and write whenever you can, okay?”
Draco’s smile grows even bigger. “Lunch to celebrate?”
Draco smiles in return, nods, and they both Apparate away.
They’re stretched out on the patio, enjoying the sunshine while all five children zip around the Quidditch pitch on their brooms. Having been on bedrest for six weeks, Harry is more than a bit restless and has taken to spending as much time as possible outdoors. However, something more than being shut indoors has been on his mind on an increasing basis, and he can no longer keep it to himself.
going to ask unprompted questions about your sex life with Matthew. If you want to talk to me or Draco about it, that’s fine, but we won’t pry. We’ll always ask if you’re comfortable discussing something.”
“Healer Carr says everything is right on track. I’m due on 22 August.” Harry feels the warmth of Draco’s hand moving to lay on his abdomen.
“A benefit, I’m afraid.” Draco pops open the wax seal on the thick parchment scroll and unfurls it between them.
“I was rather hoping you’d let me,” Harry says huskily. Draco’s eyes widen and then a slow, easy grin spreads on his face. Harry’s brain nearly short-circuits just thinking about all the things he would like to do to Draco, laid out on his kitchen table. But more than anything, he wants Draco on that table, arse in the air.
He settles on a pair of snug-fitting dark denims and a dark green fitted jumper over a dress shirt. Stripping off what he has on and sitting on the edge of the bed, Harry groans. He’s still half-hard from seeing Draco shirtless.
“Will you be all right if I leave you long enough to wake Scorpius? There’s some at the flat and he can go and fetch it.” Harry can tell from his tone that Draco is hesitant to leave him at all. He wonders how bad he must look for the normally calm man to be this worried.
Hands guide his calves back into the air and Draco sits reclined in the bed behind him, Harry lying on his chest.
“I’ll take any excuse to be in your arms.
“You don’t look like you feel well. You’re pale. You’ve been in the hospital. Draco hasn’t let go of you since we got home. Something is wrong.”
His breath finally stops coming in gasps and he reaches behind himself, wincing as he eases the dildo out of his arse.
“Every Thursday, then?”
“Thank you.” He looks to Draco, who has his own towel slung around his hips.
Harry knew Draco had developed a bit of a pregnancy kink, but he hasn’t watched his face like this since his abdomen had become so obviously round with child.
“Does he have his own vault?”
The Healer's footsteps descend the stairs and as soon as the Floo activates, Draco’s lips are on Harry’s and his hand is on his abdomen.
“I couldn’t really care less. We’ll just live our life, and they’ll figure it out.” Harry has no desire to deal with the press. It doesn’t matter if he gives interviews or ignores them, they still manage to speculate and make things up. It frustrates him to no end, but he’s never managed to find a way to quell the invasion of his privacy. “If it gets too rough on the kids, we can release a statement.”
Harry’s still struggling to wrap his mind around the fact that he’s found Draco to be such pleasant company. His former nemesis seems to have grown into a genuinely good person. Harry has always known that Draco wasn’t really evil when they were kids— that he was a terrified child doing what he felt he had to do to survive. Harry had told the Wizengamot as much when he testified after the war, securing Draco’s pardon, but he’d never expected Draco to completely reject his family and his upbringing in this way.
Careful not to dislodge the arm Draco has thrown around his middle, Harry slides on his glasses and studies Draco’s sleeping form. A warmth spreads in Harry’s chest as he gazes at Draco’s handsome face, relaxed in sleep. Gorgeous blond hair stands out in contrast to the blue sheets on Harry’s bed. The expanse of pale skin on display is absolutely delicious.
Harry sips his coffee and decides a simple explanation is better. Hermione can ward just about anything, regardless of features. “It really just depends on if it will fit in the space where you want to put it.”
know and is firmly committed to. “Something that lets me work to make life better in one aspect or another for someone else. I
Harry leans his head to rest on the back of the couch. Several hours of shopping with Draco and their children accompanied by the press was exhausting. Draco’s gone upstairs to help Scorpius and Al unshrink and arrange Scorpius’ new furniture, and James has taken Matthew to his room for some “quality time.” Judging by the music and the laughter drifting through the door, Harry is sure they’re enjoying themselves.
"Oh, Harry," Hermione bursts out laughing, no longer able to hold it together. "You thought I'd be upset?"
“I’ve put lubrication gel on two fingers of my gloved hand—” she lifts them to show James. “—and I’ve cast a relaxing charm to make it more comfortable. I’ll slide my fingers in with the pads of my fingers facing up.”
“I don’t think so.” James glances at Matthew for confirmation, who shakes his head.
Checking the mirror again, he decides it was worth it. His eyes look bright green next to his caramel skin, brought out by the jumper he’s put on. As a bonus, it detracts from the fact that his hair always looks like a bit of a rat’s nest. He pats his pockets.
The stretch of the dildo is accompanied by a pleasant burn, and Harry revels in Draco’s indecent moan from behind him. When the base brushes his arse, Harry presses back against it and is grateful for just a moment to adjust.
He looks genuinely excited to have Harry coming to work at the CRMM, and Harry feels his own excitement grow as Draco’s does.
Draco grins wryly at him. “I’d like to make you moan for other reasons.” His tone is light and teasing, but truthfully, now that he’s not nauseous, Harry wants nothing more than Draco’s cock buried in his arse.
“Sorry, James. I should have warned you. Magical travel is rather rough thanks to this one.” Harry rests his hands on his belly.
“I love you, too.”
Draco snickers. “Go on, then.”
happy, aren’t you, Dad?”
“I feel like Matthew’s falling out with his parents is kind of my fault.”
“Stay in your room and stay on the phone with Harry and James. I’m on my way to get you.”
“Harry.” Draco’s voice is soft in his ear. “Come on, wake up.”
“You’re attracted to me?”
“I didn’t expect you to propose quite this soon, but I also knew I wanted us both to be able to wear an engagement ring. So, I ordered this and picked it up when I took James out to shop for Matthew before Christmas.” Harry slips the ring from the box. He’s had the ring Draco picked out made for him in platinum, ruby glistening in the middle, their initials engraved together inside. Holding it flat in his palm, he offers it to Draco.
“How about I put some wine on ice and order in some dinner while you go do that?” Draco’s bright smile answers Harry’s question. “Does anything sound good?”
Harry wraps his hand around Draco’s bicep and stands close, taking the opportunity to breathe in the smell of bergamot and mint that must come from Draco’s shampoo. Draco’s other hand comes up over his and Harry feels the familiar squeeze as they Disapparate.
“We have a few things to discuss,” Draco begins, “but first, I want you to know that you are welcome in this house; you are loved and valued and there is absolutely nothing you should be ashamed of in this situation. Your parents are responsible for their own actions and reactions. Not you.”
telling people I have a sweetheart.”
Lying in bed, Draco’s body pressed against him, Draco’s hand protectively splayed over his belly, Harry is pretty sure there’s nothing that would make him happier with this life he’s living now.
“Yes, but I’m sure they’d all prefer to be spared the mental image.”
Harry forces himself to take another deep breath and resumes his pacing. He jumps when the Floo chimes. Kneeling on the hearth, he opens the connection to see Hermione smirking at him.
“Go back upstairs, son,” Draco says against Harry’s mouth.
He looks at Hermione with affection. She knew he’d be nervous and called just to distract him. “Thank you, Hermione. Love you!”
“I know. I’m going to be a nervous wreck while you’re out. I just want you both to be safe.”
.” Harry pauses and squeezes Draco’s hands. “But I only want this if you’re ready for it, too.”
Harry reluctantly pulls away.
“I am. It’s got a ways to go, but I’ve gotten the core protectant to brew without being unstable.”
appears across the nameplate.
Draco continues his ministrations, working his way down Harry’s back, to the top of his arse. Harry is nearly a puddle on the blanket by the time he feels Draco shift and move off his arse.
“What do we do for the first name, then?”
Draco is pulling out vegetables for the salad and Harry is lighting the hob to boil water when footsteps come timidly down the stairs.
“That was my bet. Hermione hypothesised they’ll say we’ve added her to our relationship and are now a triad.”
“Too much?”
Draco laughs. “You just want out of the house.”
Harry’s eyes go wide and the barking laugh that escapes his mouth takes him by surprise before he manages to return Malfoy’s grin. “That you were, Malfoy, that you were. My nose reminds me, every time it rains.”
missed her and doesn’t want her to feel replaced. Harry hears Draco descending the stairs behind him. He glances over his shoulder as Draco approaches.
“James?” Harry keeps his voice soft. James turns to look at him and Harry can see that he’s quite unsettled. “Are you all right?”
Harry lets his eyes shift down to the case in his hand.
Matthew is immediately in James’ arms and Harry and Draco are wrapped around both boys. For several long minutes, the men hold the two sobbing teenagers, neither able to keep tears from tracking down their own cheeks.
“That’s fine, then.” Harry obligingly holds out his arm wincing as the Healer slides a needle in and fills three phials with blood. She pulls several small tubes from her bag and drops blood into each, casting spells and recording results.
Draco smiles and kisses Harry’s forehead. Harry sighs at the flashes of light from the window.
Within five minutes, a Magiscope is being wheeled into the room. And sixty seconds later, Harry’s eyes are pressed against it and he’s viewing his own core.
“I know, Al.” Draco’s voice answers. “It’s not what I had in mind either. But I love your dad.” Another pause. “Are you ok with this?”
Harry’s brain ceases all coherent thought as he realises Draco is asking permission to undress him. “Yes, of course,” he manages.
“We are, yes,” Harry answers firmly.
“I’m fine.” Harry smiles softly. “I think I felt the baby move.”
He’s never pictured himself carrying a child, but, he supposes, perhaps
Draco drops Harry’s hand and wraps his arm around his waist, squeezing his hip gently and Harry leans into him. He notices Bernice smiling warmly as she watches them.
The wave crests and crashes, and Harry can breathe fully again.
“I’m going to start with the usual health spells and bloodwork, and then we’ll check on the baby.”
Draco gathers their bags, and Harry hugs each of their children in turn and then Hermione. “Aunt Hermione will bring you over when Regulus has been born. Draco will text with updates. I love all of you.”
“Come in!” Al’s voice calls.
“I would be absolutely honoured to have you as a Potter, Scorpius.” Harry’s voice is far more hoarse than he anticipated. He smiles impishly at Draco. “I suppose I’ll have you, as well.”
“I am, too. I think that’s why I feel off today. Healer Carr said everything looked great yesterday.” Harry is reassuring himself as much as he’s reassuring Draco.
“Sure.”
“Of course we can.” Draco helps Harry to ease back down into the bed, connecting his mouth to that magic spot behind his ear once more.
“Lily will be relieved,” Harry chuckles. “She didn’t want to be unseated as ‘Daddy’s Princess’.”
“I know it’s hard, Harry; I’m so sorry, love. But it’ll be worth it.”
Harry obligingly lifts one leg and sighs. He’s still not really comfortable with even his Healer being this up close and personal with his anatomy. That’s not avoidable, seeing as how he will be birthing a child in roughly twenty-three weeks, and he knows this. But he doesn’t have to like it.
Mess dealt with, Harry laces his fingers through Draco’s and leads him up the stairs. As much as he wants Draco to stay, Harry is also incredibly apprehensive. It’s been twelve years since he’s had anyone but his kids in his bed.
“I’ll go grab dinner. Do you still want wine with our pizza?”
time they’ve been together. And that was the day they picked out Draco’s television, well before their first date.
“Perfect for nearly 8 weeks. So good, in fact, I’m inclined to let you go home in the morning. My only stipulations are that we get you off the anti-nausea drip and you can eat and hold down food before then.
“Yeah, pretty close.” Harry passes his trousers to Draco and pulls on some pants. Turning to the mirror, he runs his hands down his torso. He hadn’t expected to be struggling to fit into his clothes at just over nine weeks. He still has 29 more to go!
“All of this feels surreal.”
He is just finishing dinner when there’s a scratch at the window. Looking up, he smiles and rises quickly to let Cupcake in.
“You can,” Draco confirms.
Draco’s eyes lift to meet Harry’s, and a slow, satisfied smile replaces his previous expression. That smile excites the Hippogriffs even more, and Harry feels warm all over under Draco’s gaze.
“I’ll go grab the wine and pour us another glass while you decide.” Harry slips off the couch and retreats to the kitchen. The door swings shut and Harry braces both hands on the counter, closing his eyes.
“You, Draco Malfoy, are the best partner a man could ever ask for. Thank you.”
“Are you guys ready to have five kids running around this house?” Hermione asks wryly.
Draco heaves a nervous-sounding breath and sets his tea beside the couch, wrapping both arms around Harry. “I’m on the page where I’m a little nervous about how right everything feels, but I want this to be serious between us. And for the long term, if it keeps going so well. And somehow that’s scary, but also pretty great?”
Several minutes pass as Harry tries to figure out how to put this into words that don’t feel ridiculous. He startles as his mobile begins vibrating with an incoming call.
The Floo chime from downstairs startles them both and Harry sighs. He’s anxious to make sure everything is ok, but he really doesn’t like anyone but Draco touching his body right now.
“Of course, I did.” Harry chuckles, and James’ smile gives way to an all-out grin.
“When?”
“Still feeling all right?”
Al heads for the door and meets Draco on the way out. Draco is carrying two good-size stoppered bottles of potion, which he sets on the dresser.
“Having a baby with the man I’m in love with.” Draco’s fingers card gently through Harry’s hair. “I never expected to fall in love and beyond that, I can’t carry. And I never would’ve pushed for us to adopt or have a surrogate. I’m still trying to wrap my brain around the surprise, but I can’t find it anywhere in myself to be sorry this is happening.”
“By the authority granted to me by the Wizengamot of the United Kingdom, I now pronounce you bonded husband and husband. I give you Harry and Draco Potter! You may seal your bond with a kiss.”
I’d really like to monitor you weekly for now, just until you’re through the first twelve weeks. Your risk of complications and miscarriage drops drastically at that point, and we would move to every 3-4 weeks at that time. It would, of course, pick back up when you get close to delivery.”
The back door swings open and five grinning, laughing kids burst in. Harry can’t help but smile along with them.
“Oh, yeah… Muggle shop that has all kinds of electronics,” Harry replies, having forgotten that Draco may not be familiar with the chain of stores.
Harry feels like his whole body is on fire.
“Fuck, Draco!” Harry can’t help but cry out as Draco takes him in. Being pregnant has made the pleasure of Draco’s touch multiply, and this has set his body on fire. He wordlessly reaches out and feels the phial of lube meet his hand. Pressing it into one of the hands gripping his hips, he feels Draco chuckle around his cock.
James nods and climbs off the bed, books in hand. As soon as the door shuts behind him, Draco and Harry both sag.
It only takes an hour for the entirety of the nursery to be arranged and the massive stash of baby supplies to be put away or displayed. Harry, feet now elevated on the matching ottoman, looks over each detail; the silver stars on the mobile, the lamp shaped like a moon, the tiny blanket with stars that match the walls.
“I would have laughed. But I would never choose anything different. Our life is wonderful. Baby and bonus kids and engagement and love. What more could I want?” Draco’s mouth finds the place just behind Harry’s ear that makes him moan.
Hermione turns her hand to grip Harry’s and squeeze it lightly. “I’d like that a lot. I’ve always hoped he’d come around.”
Harry lays a hand over the one Draco has resting on his stomach and laces their fingers together. Harry wants this relationship to go well and to last. He knows it’s better to have this all out in the open, but there’s always something unnerving about making yourself vulnerable like this.
“Place this ring on the fourth finger of his left hand and repeat after me: Please accept this ring as an outward symbol of our bond. With this ring, I thee wed.”
“She’s what?!”
“I don’t know. We did look at engagement rings today, though.”
Draco slips in the door just in time to see him heaving and crying in pain and frustration.
Draco’s potion team is working on another potion series for the Childhood Malevolent Magic Exposure Study. This set of potions is meant to be given to children shortly after exposure to Dark Magic to prevent the residual malevolent magic from settling around their core. This would prevent the need for intensive treatment later in life, like core-binding and curse-breaking.
“Our second year of Hogwarts, Ginny’s first year, she was regularly possessed by Voldemort through a diary that was cursed by some very Dark Magic.” Harry purposefully omits the fact that Draco’s father was the one who gave Ginny the diary. He’s not even sure if Draco knows that particular bit of information, and he’s certainly not going to tell him now. “They had no explanation when Ginny’s core haemorrhaged after Lily was born. All the testing for known pregnancy-related core issues was negative.”
“Anything?” Draco inquires, a smirk crossing his lips again.
“You’re welcome, James.” Harry can hear the barely discernible catch in Draco’s voice.
“Merlin, this is going to get hectic.” Harry shakes his head. “Matthew can give his parents the break to calm down and maybe write them when he’s back at school. If they will allow him to come home, he can decide if he wants to do that. If they refuse to let him back in the house or he doesn’t want to go back, we probably need to figure out some kind of guardianship for the summer. Just in case there’s an emergency or he needs medical attention.”
To most people, it would probably just look like he’s had a few too many pints, but the protrusion of his belly, though slight, is clearly there. He lays both hands over the place where their baby is growing and smiles.
“I texted you at 5:30 and told you to come by my lab on the way out so I could see you.” Draco shakes his head and opens the door for Harry. “I got tired of waiting.”
Harry smiles softly. “I do hope she does some imaging. I’d like to see our little one again.”
Harry closes his eyes and when the next wave meets him, he pushes against it.
“Absolutely. Come up to our room and we’ll talk.” He feels Draco shift behind him so they can both stand. “Will you three put away the leftovers when you’re done?” he asks the younger children.
“Okay.” Harry gives Al a reassuring smile. “I think we need to find something to help you so it can change.”
Harry looks to Draco, whose eyes are tear-filled eyes like his own, and the blond nods. “I had planned to talk to you tonight about taking your name. Scorp had his part of the idea on his own, though.”
Draco laughs. “Both! And you know it!” He shakes his head. “But seriously. We have a new department that’s working specifically on long-term side effects from Dark Magic. You would have an exceptional skill set for that.” Draco glances at Harry.
Harry watches them go, smiling fondly at the sight of all his five children together out on the lawn, waiting for the ceremony to begin.
Warmth floods Harry’s body. How on earth can one person make him feel so…cherished? Returning the smile, Harry takes a deep breath.
: his new fiancé and their beautiful family.
“Draco, if something happens to me—“
“In that case, I’ll just enjoy the show.”
“I'm not sure I’d have the right skill set for working with rare magical maladies. I’m not as smart as you or Hermione,” Harry states quickly. He’s always been a hard worker, not necessarily naturally smart.
just enjoy it, love. What they think doesn’t get to change how we celebrate our happiness.”
Draco’s finger slides free and Harry watches more lube drip onto Draco’s hand before he feels two fingers press inside. He presses against Draco’s fingers and lifts his knee further towards his chest, opening himself more. Draco scissors and stretches Harry’s rim, causing a wonderful burn, before two fingers become three. Harry can’t stop the moans and sighs of pleasure as he is meticulously and thoroughly stretched.
Harry frowns. Scorpius had seemed fairly reserved earlier and is apparently still struggling. “Is he all right?”
Draco obliges and pops open the phial. A hand disappears between Harry’s spread legs, and Harry moans as one of those familiar fingers breaches him. Slow and deep, finger and mouth matching pace, Draco begins to open him up.
Harry nods. “Draco took the attic space for his lab. We had two spare bedrooms, one is Scorp’s and one will be the baby’s. We could convert the study to another bedroom, but we both use the study, and it’s a nice escape when the kids are all home.”
Harry is startled by his own internal musings. No ‘falling.’ No ‘could.’ Just ‘love.’ He loves him, and he can’t find any argument in his mind to the contrary.
“You know I’ve not dated much since Ron, Harry.” Hermione’s face shows a hint of pain and Harry winces, regretting his hasty question. They usually avoid this topic. “But the man has generally asked me out on a date properly. I don’t always say yes, mind you.”
Harry lifts Draco’s left hand and slips the ring onto his fourth finger, kissing him softly afterwards.
“That, too.”
The Healer chuckles, but Draco strokes his hair.
Scorpius and Draco both fold their long, lanky bodies onto the bed and Harry smiles, wondering if Regulus will take after his father and brother in height.
“Bedroom suites are this way.” Bernice leads them towards a different section of the shop. “Do you know what pieces you’re looking for?”
“He needs to push,” Draco reports to the Healer. The urge to push subsides, but the tightening of the contraction doesn’t. Harry gulps for air.
“Nnnngh. Sweet fucking Salazar.” Draco’s words are barely a whisper. “That’s good.”
“Here,” she says, handing him a pile. “Put these away and I’ll keep looking.”
“I know.” Harry turns at the sound of footsteps on the stairs to see Scorpius, dressed in the robes identical to James, hurrying down the stairs.
Draco draws his wand. “Put your hand flat on the top of the box.”
Draco’s hands freeze.
Smiling to himself, Harry resumes his task and sets a slow, steady pace. The soft whimpers and moans falling from Draco’s mouth go straight to Harry’s aching cock.
Harry smiles down at her before she’s shuffled towards Draco and he finds himself with an armful of Albus and Scorpius.
“That works. Until then, we don’t have to name names if we say we’ve got a partner, but I also don’t intend on hiding the fact that I’m in a relationship if the issue comes up.” Draco pauses. “I assume you’ll tell Hermione?”
“I hope so. We’re only sixteen, so it’ll be five or six years.”
“I will take him to London tomorrow and get a vault started for him and move his mobile to our plan. That should keep him protected from any revenge moves his parents may take.”
“Of course. I’ll be in the hall when you’re ready.” Healer Carr moves to the hall, shutting the door behind herself.
Harry’s face softens just a bit. He does know, Harry supposes. And it would give him somewhere to go besides home to an empty house. Harry gives a brief nod, “I…yeah…yeah. Okay. Lead the way.”
“First, we’ll make sure that your body has begun to properly form a womb. This will be much like the imaging a woman would have at the beginning of a pregnancy. You’re both familiar with that?”
Harry climbs the stairs to Albus’ room and knocks.
Harry cringes at the timbre of his own voice. He sounds like a petulant child.
Hermione’s eyes widen and her mouth drops open. This is one of only a handful of times in nearly thirty years that Harry has seen the brilliant witch absolutely speechless.
“Ready to go, then?” Harry pushes himself to his feet and smiles at Draco.
“Canal first, please. Let’s get it over with.”
. That makes more sense for an eleven-year-old.
“Pretty serious, James.” Harry smiles softly at his son. “I love Draco, and he loves me. We’re living together. Those aren’t things either of us take lightly.”
“Yeah.” Harry chuckles softly.
“You…you look…I can’t believe I get to marry you,” he stutters.
“I’ll want you to start on an iron potion in addition to the nutrient potion. And if you feel faint again, or you actually pass out, you must go to St Mungo’s immediately.”
“Would you give us a moment?” Harry requests, squeezing Draco’s hand tightly.
Harry takes James’ hand, squeezes lightly, and lays it against his belly. He urges his son to press lightly and when he does, the little boy inside him presses back out against his big brother’s hand. James’ grin is watery when Harry looks at his face.
“Okay. We’ll open a vault for you tomorrow. You’re sixteen, so you can open it with an adult signature. Mine should suffice.”
Harry chuckles at the disdain clearly written on Draco’s sharp features. Somehow, even with his nose wrinkled, he’s gorgeous.
“Yes. So maybe we could replace two of the diamonds with rubies?”
“I would agree. Al will be overly anxious, I’m sure.” Harry hesitates, then decides to voice his fear. “I’m worried about James.”
“It’s going to be awkward the first couple of times.” Draco’s eyes dance despite his serious tone and Harry wonders if he’s remembering their first time. “It might be uncomfortable until you get the mechanics right. It might also burn when you’re getting used to being stretched. But it shouldn’t hurt.”
“He certainly didn’t feel tiny on the way out,” Harry quips at his daughter. “Come over here beside Draco, and you can hold your brother.”
Harry’s hand moves away from the shampoo. Maybe it’s not time to finish up, after all. A hot, wet, naked Draco sounds like a much better option, anyhow.
Harry moans against Draco’s arse and buries his face even deeper into Draco’s crevice. He didn’t expect to enjoy this quite so much, but he does. Merlin, he does. Gingerly, he stiffens his tongue and presses against Draco’s hole. The pleased moan from Draco encourages him and he presses harder, both of them gasping as Harry’s tongue slips past that ring of muscle and inside Draco. Harry can’t hold back a throaty groan of pleasure with the tip of his tongue surrounded by Draco’s velvety heat.
The bedroom door opens and admits not only Draco, but Scorpius.
Harry nods and is suddenly even more grateful for the good, hard shag they had in the shower that morning. “What about orgasm?”
Harry looks at Draco and then sighs. He just wants to curl up in Draco’s arms, but there’s so much to worry about. Outside the security of Potter Cottage, he knows that his safety, as well as Draco’s, could be at risk.
“I would prefer that you wait until you’re older and in a committed relationship, but I’m also not going to tell you that you can’t have sex. That being said, if you’re not completely sure you’re both ready, you’ll need to wait.”
“What’s wrong?”
Draco’s eyes open and seek out Harry’s. “That is absolutely delicious. I wouldn’t change a thing.” Draco’s eyes dart down Harry’s body for just an instant before he shifts back to his stool.
Returning his fingers to his hole again, he neglects his throbbing erection and focuses on stretching himself as open as he can before he rolls over to his stomach. Getting on his knees, he cants his arse in the air and reaches up behind himself to grasp the waiting dildo, guiding the large blunt head to his entrance.
Draco scowls. “I hope Claire figures it out. Maybe she’ll keep her hands off you.”
“Besides lube?”
Harry turns the popcorn into the large bowl on the counter and wandlessly levitates the bowl and two glasses of wine ahead of him towards the sitting room. He pushes the door open and finds Draco standing by the mantle, lips stretching into a smile at the sight of Harry.
“Out with it, Lil.”
Harry is relieved he hadn’t been the only one feeling something in those moments. “Honestly, there’s been a couple of times when I’ve wondered if you might kiss me.”
“Of course, Mr Malfoy. I’m glad to be of help.” Healer Carr pulls her wand and conjures a small table, setting her medical bag on top of it. “It’s lovely to meet you, Mr Potter, though I’m sorry about the circumstances.”
“But you haven’t required a wand for anything you’d normally do wandlessly?”
“How would you know?” Draco smirks. “I’m still wearing my trousers.”
“We are.”
“You’re welcome. And you don’t need to say anything else.”
“He moved down between my hips, I think. It felt like he was about to come out through my spine.”
Draco’s hands still.
Harry takes a deep breath.
“Yes. Brightest star in Draco. And you and our son are the brightest spots in my life in a very long time.” Draco’s emotions are wild in his voice — some combination of love and happiness and maybe being overwhelmed by having more of both than he’s been accustomed to in life.
Draco’s eyes close and Harry panics just a bit before his lips turn up in a hint of a smile.
“I think it’s perfect.” Draco turns to look back at him and Harry is startled to see the open affection and joy in those silvery eyes.
“Harry. How long have I known you’re bisexual?!? Over twenty years.
“Merlin, nothing beats being buried inside you while you’re pregnant with my baby.”
Harry slips his mobile back in his pocket as Draco strides purposefully back to him, a satisfied smile on his face.
“Yeah. You’ll have your mobile if I need you, right?”
“Caffeinate.” Harry gently steers Draco towards the kitchen table and gathers their breakfast plates.
