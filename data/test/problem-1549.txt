“Ohhh…I wanna twy!” Teddy yelled.
Bllltttt….prrrrrtttt!….BRAAAP!
Harry had heard him and grinned even wider. “So it’s only me who has witness you doing this? That’s great- it means that you’re comfortable with only me, right?”
Tracing the smooth angles of the blonde’s cheekbones, Harry couldn’t help but admire how even more lovely his boyfriend looked when he was asleep, free from any stress or troubles.
Harry’s godson and Draco’s cousin, Teddy Lupin, would be staying with them over the weekend.
Back then, he was sat down by Andromeda, Molly, Hermione and Ginny and the four women managed to talk him out of it.
A torrent of gas bursted out and small turds of poop followed, with loud plopping that could be heard landing in the toilet.
Draco noticed Harry watching him and his cheeks reddened. “Sorry- I couldn’t hold it.”
As Teddy went back to playing with his blocks, Harry joined Draco who now sat on the floor and wrapped an arm around the other. “Good job, Professor Malfoy.” He winked at the blond.
Understanding what the other wanted to convey, Harry nodded as he went to grab Teddy’s attention.
Draco blushed, biting his lips although failing to keep the wide smile from appearing on his face. “You’re such a sap, Harry.” Leaning in, any more conversation was quickly lost in the night and replaced with moans and the tangling of bodies becoming one.
Just as he was about to rest against his lover’s side, Draco brought his fist to his mouth and let out a large belch, which was quickly followed by a loud wet fart as he lifted his bum to the side as he let it out.
“Both ways is fine. Teddy would need to know how to do both as he gets older.” Andromeda told them.
Draco straightened out and gave his boyfriend a kiss as thanks. "I'm going to stay with you until you're done and then I suggest we both take a good wash in the stream before returning to bed." He said as he made his way back to the tree to put on his clothes.
Harry huffed. “That’s all I can do for now- I swear it’ll be bigger next time.” He promised.
But Victoire knew that Uncle Draco was lovey dovey with Uncle Harry like her parents were with each other, so she gracefully surrendered her first love. But it was okay, because at least Uncle Harry made Uncle Draco happy and always made her her favorite cherry clafoutis whenever she came over.
“Only you am I comfortable enough to show this side of myself to you. You are the only one who was seen me, felt me, and even smelled me like this. No one else. And I don’t want anyone else. I love you Harry Potter so please stop thinking yourself as dirty. You are beautiful and you are mine.” Draco gave him the most loving smile Harry had ever seen.
Leaving a soft kiss on the other’s shoulder, Harry got out of bed and put on some clothes before leaving the tent.
There was one instant when while they were both cuddling in bed, he had accidentally farted and unintentionally dutch-ovened his poor boyfriend. And it had reeked- probably due to all the food he ate over the last few days had festered inside his gut.
“I love you too Harry Potter. So much.”
Victoire sniffled as she nodded, hiding her face in Harry’s neck.
Harry turned to grin weakly at his boyfriend. "Mine’s probably sound the same as yours, love. At least the cramps is feeling much better now." He ended his sentence with another booming fart accompanied with more chunky poop.
Teddy then announced that he was done and if he could watch the telly (the little boy loved watching the moving and talking pictures in the wide screen and wished electricity worked at Andromeda’s house).
As soon as the flames in the floo died down, but men sighed as Harry felt arms wrap around his middle, a chin on his shoulder.
Harry playfully glared at the other, although deep down he was relieved that his boyfriend was getting back to his normal self again. “Well, do you think you can do any better?” He challenged.
On the other side was where their tent stood. The blond never knew it was possible for a tent to be luxurious, but this one certainly was.
“Yes. So in order to make the mess disappear, you will cast Evanesco. This works much better with a wand, but you should be able to clean yourself enough using this motion- now watch.” Making a half-circle motion with his hand and curling his hand slightly, he said, “Evanesco.”
“Good job, Professor Potter.” Draco congratulated him quietly.
Draco was silent as he listened to Harry’s explanation. After a minute, he finally spoke, “If the fact that I go the traditional way bothers you Harry, you need to let me know now. Because Hogwarts is the other place where I use the muggle loos. Everywhere else, especially at home, I WILL do what makes me the most comfortable. And since we plan on moving in together after Hogwarts well…” Draco trailed off, looking away. “…maybe this issue may make you change your mind…”
One of the most mind-reeling things that Harry discovered was actually during one of his History of Magic classes (shockingly enough).
Almost one month later, it was finally the right time for her trip so Andromeda was now here to drop Teddy off for the weekend.
"Maybe? But I ate so much of everything that it could have been anything that caused this." Draco admitted, bending lower to let out more diarrhea, the brown sludge pouring out of him.
Draco grimaced but nodded his head. “We’ll clean as much as we can and just keep the stasis charm on the toilet until he comes.”
He felt Harry hug him even tighter. “Merlin, no! I would never laugh at you for that! And you’re not disgusting either. I was just so amazed that someone as posh and refined as you could actually burp, let alone fart, like a normal person that I couldn’t help but laugh.”
“- then Dean walked in and it was all over for Seamus!” Harry told him gleefully.
Harry looked thoughtful. “I wasn’t really taught. I think just before I was two, my aunt was already forcing me to learn how to use the loo by myself. I can’t remember much, but I do recall her screaming at me as I sat on the toilet while trying not to fall in since I was very tiny back then.
When her parents came by to pick their daughter up, they were mortified when they learned what their daughter did.
Harry shifted to flush the toilet, the sound making both Teddy and Draco jump.
Interestingly enough, against Harry’s initial assumptions about his proper, pompous significant other, he learned early in their relationship that Draco was perfectly fine ‘breaking a bit of wind’ in his company.
Even though Harry had grew up in a world that looked down on such a disgraceful act of soiling oneself, for him to think that nothing was wrong and to even be…intrigued by it…well, that was abnormal wasn’t it?
It was unnerving to see small, innocent eyes staring at his penis. “Hawwy’s peepee is big!”
Once Draco got Teddy’s attention again, Draco continued. “Alright. When you are done, the most important spell to do is to make your mess disappear. The difference between babies and big boys is that big boys can clean themselves- they do not wait for other’s to clean for them.”
The two men exchanged a look before Harry walked out with Victoire while Draco casted a stasis spell on the room before joining the the other two.
Bad news: their toilet was still clogged with whatever else she stuck in there and no magic or Muggle means could help it now.
Harry must have fallen asleep again because he found himself blinking awake once more, but this time he saw lovely grey eyes blearily look back at him.
Harry giggled as he saw the caught-off guard look on his lover’s face. “Wow. And you never even had your morning coffee yet.” He teased, knowing that their favorite brand of coffee tended to make the blonde extra gassy.
They had a good laugh when Harry had accidentally farted and the water had been so clear that they could see the bubbles rising from his bum up to the surface, popping once they got there.
Sighing, Harry looked at his godson. “When you’re done, the most important thing is to wipe yourself. Hold on.”
Draco looked up, face red as he was in the middle of pushing a hard log out right then. “What was that, Harry?” He asked, though his attention was mostly on his current task. He widened this legs, making room for the stool to land in between.
Draco gave a huge sigh of relief- as long as there was tissue, he could deal with relieving himself in the forest.
Helping each other to wipe clean, they finally made their way to the stream where they undressed completely and sighed as they entered the soothing waters (Harry had casted a warming charm on themselves so they wouldn’t freeze in the waters).
Harry enjoyed the snake exhibit— he made good friends with one of the pythons and Draco had to talk him out of helping this snake from escaping the exhibit too.
Harry’s own eyes opened wide in shock as he stared at his lover who’s face was quickly turning redder than a pepper imp candy.
Draco leaned against one of the trees, and dozed off for a bit as Harry continued to expel the rest of his waste.
Harry looked at the blonde, furrowing his eyebrows. “I’m sure I heard wrong, but I thought I heard Professor Binns just say that wizards would just…go in their robes and not the bathroom. Silly, right?” He chuckled, shaking his head.
Seeing this, the little girl screamed bloody murder and thankfully both boys came in to the room running as soon as they heard her. They had arrived just in time to shield her from the toilet exploding (also caused by her accidental magic).
Harry froze as he suddenly recalled that fateful conversation they had all those months ago.
Draco sighed as he realized that he didn’t have anything to wipe with. “Harry? Did you by chance bring a roll with you? I don’t have anything to wipe with.”
The blonde nodded as he walked to the same bush that Harry was at but stopped about two feet away.
Draco’s blush darkened at the ‘compliment’. “It’s just something that comes out on its own- it’s like a disgusting quirk of mine.”
“I don’t have a staring problem!” Harry argued.
Draco shrugged. “I’ve seen you with more flatulence before.”
John had been a distant relative of Neville’s and the good-natured jolly man not only knew how to mind his own business but he did his job well.
Harry kept himself from letting any noises out as he felt the blond wipe him down gently but with a firm hand. When Draco put a little too much pressure on his hole, he couldn’t stop the small puff of gas from coming out.
Not only did they trust the man, but the couple rarely invited strangers to their home- with Harry being famous and Draco being infamous, only a selective few was allowed to even past their wards, let alone come into their home.
Suddenly the sound of hissing filled the air and Harry watched as the gray boxer-briefs quickly darkened, streams on piss flowing down the other’s legs.
Draco grimaced as he swatted away a mosquito that was hovering too close to his face. “You better. I wouldn’t put up with this just for anyone, you know.”
Harry was also listening to the blond’s explanation, eyes never leaving what was going on in the other’s pants. The small bulge had completely tripled in size, making the entire seat of Draco’s pants brown and sagging heavily.
When he was finally done peeing, Harry came up to the blond and placed his arm around his boyfriend’s shoulder, guiding Draco away from the small pool of diarrhea and carefully brought him to another nearby bush.
At first, Draco felt nothing but anxiety about not having his wand on hand, but he trusted Harry with his life.
Falling into this world was a HUGE culture shock, but a very welcomed one (minus the homicidal maniacs and blood quills though).
Harry blushed at that, reddening even more when he heard Draco comment under his breath, loud enough that Harry could hear, “Yes it is.” He sneaked a peek at the other and saw the blond sitting on the edge of the tub, giving him a wink.
(=^w^=)**************************
“B-but, but…” Harry stuttered, eyes watering as he could feel the log make its way out even more.
“Harry!” Draco quickly out the takeout down as he rushed to his lover. “What’s wrong?”
Harry grunted as a loud squeaky fart left him, a stream of liquid feces following after. “Ah, no- I had only planned to take a piss when I came out here and didn’t think I’d need it. Hold on…”
But yesterday was when the cramps started. They would come and go, but today they were worse than usual.
Draco paused as he looked back and Harry saw the look of confusion clear on his face. “Why? You don’t need to go out of your way to go anywhere. Let me just take care of this first and then we can continue cuddling again.” Draco pouted, clearly wanting to go back to snuggling with his lover once more.
Draco stared at their intertwined hands, unable to move as he could still hear the other still having a fit.
Draco snorted, but leaned over to give him a small kiss on the cheek, obviously forgiving his daft lover.
To hell with his pureblood upbringing.
When Harry first brought up the idea of camping, Draco had flat out refused. Being in the middle of nature, far away from civilization gave the blond hives just from the mere thought of it.
Harry snorted. “That was so embarrassing- I didn’t expect to be so gassy.”
Finally it was done and Harry could cry from relief of it all being over.
Harry was actually pretty poop-shy and had a hard time going anywhere that wasn’t in the privacy of his own home. Even when he was at Hogwarts, he would time it so he would go in the early morning or very late at night where he would have the most privacy.
“How did you learn?” Harry asked, swirling some of the vanilla ice cream on his plate.
Teddy’s practically bursted in happiness as he saw his own potty. “Wow!”
“Of course.” Draco smiled. “So does this mean you’ll no longer be giving me anymore ‘weird’ stares whenever I relieve myself?”
Not bothering to hold it, Draco quickly pushed out his own load into his pants, and when he finished, he returned his focus on his upset lover.
But it was Draco and everyone else who truly cared about him that convinced him that after everything he went through in his life, he was no longer obligated to be everyone’s hero forever. He deserved to live his own life for once.
Leaning forward so their foreheads were touching, Draco spoke. “We’re both equally dirty right now. Just like you’ve never looked at me differently every time I did a repulsive act in front of you such as let out gas or soil myself, I will never look at you with anything other than love and acceptance the same way.
It got to the point where even Gryffindors and Slytherins had finally made a truce and even got along now (the friendship that evolved between Hermione and Pansy though was something that Harry did regret a bit though- those two were scary when they were plotting something, like setting up their best friends together).
Harry moaned as another sharp cramp hit him. He slipped off his shoes and socks and bundled them together with his shorts and knickers, leaving his bottom half bare like Draco.
They had just just gotten together in their relationship a few weeks before. They came back from Hogsmeade where they had gone on their second date.
“Much as I would love to lay with you here all day, we have plans to tend with the garden today.” Draco reminded him. “We need to expel those blasted gnomes out and plant the herbs for my potions- as well as the flowers Mother had gifted us.”
Harry needed to shift a bit before he grunted, pushing out his own booming fart, loud enough that it scared another fart out of his lover.
“And don’t worry if you are not able to do it the first few times- for most wizards, it takes them until they’re at least five before they can get the hang of it.” Draco assured the boy.
While Draco washed the dishes, there was a slowly growing puddle forming underneath his bare feet, streams of urine dripping down his legs.
Draco shuffled inside the bag before pulling out a potion bottle. “We’re gonna have to make an exception for magic again. Here, this should help settle our stomachs.”  Drinking half the bottle, he handed it to Harry who finished off the rest.
Pppppprrtttt!
“It’s fine to choose whichever way you like.” Draco added. “But it’s good if you know how to do both since the wizard’s way can be useful and help you strengthen your magic while the Muggle way is what you’ll need to do once you go to Hogwarts or go out to any public area, especially if it’s in the Muggle World.”
Harry gasped as he saw his lover’s messy state, liquid poop dripping down Draco’s derrière and legs, pooling on the ground.
But Draco continued to look questioning at him but before he could say anything, Hermione- who was sitting on Harry’s left with a snoring Ron on her other side- sighed as she jumped into the conversation.
When Harry checked again, his diaper was still full. “It’s okay Teddy bear- it just takes some practice but you’re doing very well.” He assured his godson.
Draco raised his free hand to carefully grab one of Harry’s hands and bring it behind him. He heard his lover let out a gasp as he brought Harry’s hand to cup over Draco’s own mess in his pants.
Draco showed Teddy the spell once more before Teddy was ready to try for himself.
He looked up just as he saw Draco’s cheeks become pink and then a farting sound filled the room, sounding a bit wet at the end.
Draco glared angrily for a few more seconds before giving a huff, finally calming down. “They should hope their paths never cross ours. Because I swear, if I ever see them I’ll-“ Harry cut off his threat with a kiss.
“I love you, Draco.” Harry crooned as he wrapped an arm around the other, showering the other’s face with many kisses.
Draco nodded as they both shared a smile. “Sounds like a plan.”
When his steam died down, the blond could feel something trying to poke out of his bum. Biting his lip, Draco decided to just bugger it and just…go.
Harry laughed as he accio’d a bog roll to him. “Of course love, we may be out in the wild, but even I know there are limits.”
Draco decided to ask later, but for now he needed to get his boyfriend to let it all out to prevent any more damage than he already caused from holding in his poop for so long.
Taking some tissues from the bog roll, Harry looked back at the little boy. “Now, you can wipe yourself however way you like, but just make sure you’re absolutely clean. There should be nothing on your tissue for your last wipe.”
Harry turned to look at her now. “Well, I was a bit busy trying not to die during those years so excuse me for missing the lecture.” Harry grunted as both Hermione and Draco hit him for that comment. “Ouch! Ok, right, sorry. Shouldn’t talk about my death so easily like that. Got it. What I mean is, I know I missed the lecture during those years- it’s all my fault. Can you please explain it to me now?” Looking at Hermione with an innocent look.
His smile widened as Draco giggled and Harry noticed bubbles coming out of the blond’s bum, scaring some of the fish away while the rest curiously swam near the bubbles.
Draco snorted. “All of 6th year? Beginning of 8th year? Actually, make that ALL of 8th year. Whenever I change into my wizard robes or muggle outfits? That time at Tesco when you wanted me to reach that high shelf for a loaf of bread with your eyes on my arse and arms the entire time? Or when-“ his voice was muffled when Harry clamped his mouth shut with both hands.
It looked like a forest scene from a fairytale.
Draco hummed as he swallowed some of the pudding in his mouth. “Mostly from my
Both boys wore nothing but their knickers and dress robes- although Harry realized that Draco had removed his robe before doing his business.
Draco snorted as he rolled his eyes, taking a bite of his toast. “You’ll buy two pints and one additional pint of earl grey and lavender as well.” Harry grinned as he nodded.
As Teddy took his nap, Harry had started on dinner while Draco finished some of the potion orders that came in that morning (Draco was currently working towards being a Potion master and actually would supply Hogwarts with some of his own made potions whenever Madam Pomfrey and Professor Slughorn requested from him).
Casting an Olefacio minuere when their gas was a bit too ripe for them to handle, Harry hugged his lover to his side as they both watched the flames cackle and burn in the fireplace.
Harry gave his boyfriend a sympathetic noise at that. "Ah. Sorry about that love- I know we both ate a little more than we should have.” They pretty much devoured everything, leaving only a few potatoes and a bit of the paella left.
Harry smiled. “That’s right. Now, instead of peeing or pooping in their diapers, big boys will either go the Muggle way- in the loo or if they were wizards, they can go in their knickers but use magic to clean themselves.”
Suddenly Harry thought of something. “Wait, but you’ve never done it here?”
Harry sighed when he realized that it was only his boyfriend and started to pull his shorts up. "Oh, it’s only you, love. Thought for a moment the shield had gone wonky and that you were someone else.”
Prrrrrrrrrttttttt!
Draco was still reeling from what had happened. After a few moments, he finally found his voice. “I thought you were laughing at me and was thinking I was disgusting.” He murmured.
The next morning, the two was at the table, enjoying a breakfast of toast and coffee.
After a minute, while Draco’s pee was still going on, the blonde spread his legs further apart and farted really loudly.
“Hahhh…much better.” Draco breathed, smiling happily as Harry casted one more spell that healed all the bites that the blond had gotten when they first stepped foot in the woods.
Harry suddenly jumped when he felt a hand take his and looked up to see that Draco had moved closer to him. His blond boyfriend gave him an encouraging smile as he gave his hand a comforting squeeze.
After a long minute, the hissing sound finally tampered off and Draco let a soft breath out.
“Teddy? Do you want to try that spell that Cousin Draco taught you earlier?” Harry suggested.
After polishing off most of the food, they wrapped and covered the leftovers and Draco put them away as Harry casted a cleaning spell- feeling too lazy to do it by hand.
Draco’s fart ended up coming with a surprise- as not only did gas came out, but a thick stream of diarrhea sprayed out as well.
Harry frowned when he realized that his full bladder must have been the one to wake him up.
Urrp!
Harry nodded. “Exactly. Now, one of the things that big boys do is they learn how to use the potty. Do you know what that is?”
Harry frowned. “I’m dirty.” He muttered, feeling the mess warm between his legs, his face red as he felt his lover cup over it all.
With one more push, Draco sighed as he was now done. Teddy looked down and seemed to notice for the first time what exactly came out of Draco. His eyes nearly popped out of his head.
Draco held his own arms up and Teddy readily went into them, giggling as the blonde placed kisses all over his face.
If anyone wants to write me a fic or a short story, I would love to read two scenarios, 1) Draco accidentally farting in front of Harry and/or 2) Harry and Draco having a fart contest. If anyone writes this for me (you can send it to my ask box in my tumblr and you can stay anonymous)- in exchange, I’ll write you a Drarry drabble or post one of my drabbles that I have saved up from other fandoms that I have done. And if you add pooping to your story, I’ll make sure your fic is EXACTLY what you want. (But no more face-farting for the time being please- I don’t think I can write another one so soon 😆)
BlllrrrrppppPPPTTTLllllll…!
Draco watched a slumbering Harry with hooded eyes, a tired smile on his own lips as he ran his hands through the other’s hair, listening to the quiets snores that filled the room.
“And I thought I couldn’t fit anymore food in my stomach.” Harry sighed as he let his lover feed his another s’more.
No one said anything for a while, the only sounds in the air was more bouts of gas being released, another low grunt given as another load came out.
“Teddy bear!” Harry cried out as a streak of electric-blue hair zoomed straight into his arms.
Teddy’s high-pitched giggle could be heard but Harry did not look up as he felt something more than air about to come out.
Draco gave him a smile. “Same reason as why you’re open to going in front of me.” And that was all Draco would say, shrugging his shoulders.
“Jam or marmalade?” Draco asked as he reached up to open the upper shelves.
He would normally never pass gas anywhere that wasn’t in the privacy of their home, but out in the woods as they are, surrounded by only the wildlife around them, Draco had never felt more free.
Draco paused in slathering his toast with marmalade as he narrowed his eyes at his lover. “I was not aware that we’ve run out. And what exactly happened to my pint of strawberry and peanut butter ice cream?”
Andromeda chuckled as she nodded, her early anxiety about leaving her grandson and going on a leisure trip for herself after how many decades…it all started to fade away as she knew that everything would be alright. She trusted Harry and Draco.
“I a big boy!” Teddy beamed.
The two was pretty inseparable- rarely without the other nearby.
Draco paused before he raised his eyebrow at him. “Are you really asking me about my loo habits while we are both in class, Potter?” He said hauntingly, crossing his arms across his chest unamused.
Still blushing, Draco just huffed as he went back to hugging idiot of a savior, hiding his warm face in the other’s neck.
Giving the other a hug, Draco grumbled. “If the world knew your childhood, I’d doubt I’d be arrested for doing anything to your horrible relatives.”
“Urrp!”
Draco wrapped his arms around the other, keeping eye contact with Harry’s scared eyes, as he slowly pulled the other’s hands away and placed his own hands over the other’s arse
Honestly, he didn’t know why to think. How is one supposed to act like when they just discover that the love of their life basically soils themselves on a daily basis- and by choice?
“Wow, this looks delicious.” Draco complimented, his stomach growling from hunger as he looked at all the food.
Sighing as he gave his stomach a pat, Harry proceeded to lower his shorts and took his cock out.
Casting a wandless tempus, Harry saw that it was almost 1 AM. Hugging his lover’s slumbering form, Harry looked around and saw the stars still sparkling in the sky above them (their tent had an opening on the top).
Harry blushed hard (sex was completely from this situation) but unable to make a decent argument in front his godson, he reluctantly follower his lover’s directions.
Draco took a deep breath and gave a loud grunt. Instantly, a very loud and wet fart boomed out of his arse, so large it caused Draco to lift his bum off the sofa and shake slightly from the sheer force of it.
“Voyeur-?!” Harry was cut off as Draco gave him a sweet kiss.
“Oh, shut up.” Draco blushed as he dropped his hand, sticking his tongue out at Harry before going back to getting the marmalade.
*We’re at the half-way point! I absolutely love this chapter so I hope you do too! 😆
Harry bit his lip, letting out more gas. “Maybe…oooohhh…” Harry quickly grabbed his dribbling penis and tucked it in so he could aim inside the bowl.
“We should start with the potty training when we get home.” Harry nodded as they headed home. Teddy had gone in his diaper a few times during their zoo visit, but one of the perks to being a wizard was that he or Draco only needed to discreetly cast a cleaning charm and it was quickly taken care of.
They were lying on the room’s conjured sofa- they decided to go to the bed later since they both wanted to sit up for a while, feeling stuffed with all the ice cream they had eaten earlier at Floreans.
The two shared a warm smile.
Bbbbbbrrrrrlllllllpppppppp!
Harry suddenly found himself wide awake as he stared at the other.
When the fire started to die down, the couple was in an intense snogging session. They decided to move their activity to their bed, where they ended up shagging once again like two dogs in heat.
The pair continued to have diarrhea for a few more minutes, making tiny conversation in between each wave of diarrhea.
Draco smiled at him wryly as he pointedly looked down at Harry’s open fly. "Sorry, dear. I woke up because I had to relieve myself and I figured you had the same idea when I realized you were gone. I then saw the lit walkway you made and just followed it.” He cringed a bit as he held his rumbling tummy. “I don’t think our meal is sitting well in me by the way.”
Harry turned away and took another calming breath before continuing. “Alright. So, when you feel like you need to pee, make sure you lift the seat up like this, and then you lower your pants and knickers- in your case, we’ll get you pull-ups- and make sure you take your peepee and aim the tip here at the potty.”
Harry blushed when he saw what he had just done. He quickly turned on the shower and felt some relief as the ‘evidence’ washed down the drain.
Draco jumped at the loud sound as he looked to his right to see his lover’s arse vomiting diarrhea all over the bush.
Draco gasped. A little to the right, a few feet away from their campsite, they stood right at the edge of a cliff. In front laid a majestic view of the mountains and forest trees landscaped before them. A lake that sparkled changing colors of blue to sea green at the middle of it all. And amidst everything was all the forest animals as they continued to move around in their natural habitat.
“Tell me the truth- is there anyway to save it?” Draco asked.
And if that wasn’t enough, Draco involuntarily lifted his bum up slightly and had followed up with an equally loud fart right after.
“Wait, what?” Harry did a double take when he saw that the blonde didn’t automatically laugh and agree with him about what he had ‘misheard’.
As they both finished their meals, Harry sighed as he sipped the rest of his coffee. “How I lived without this coffee before, I will never understand.” Harry sniffed happily as the scent of hazelnut coffee with 1 cream and 2 sugars wafted through his nostrils.
Harry paused as he thought of something. “Oh, but which way should we train him? The wizarding way or the muggle way?” He asked, curious as he knew that they were taught differently. Harry was actually interested in seeing how the wizard’s version of potty training would go.
Harry looked at her in disbelief. “But we have loos in Hogwarts and I’ve seen it in other places too- like Hogsmeade and the Ministry.” He pointed out.
Harry’s nose wrinkled at the stench- the warmness in the tub making it worse.
Harry made a sound in agreement as more diarrhea oozed out from him. He accio’d a large bottle of water, which he shared with the other to keep them both hydrated.
“Wow.” Teddy was always amazed when magic was done.
(=^w^=)**************************
Half-Giants. Flying Cars. Werewolves. Dragons. Blood Quills. Love Potions. Horcuxes created by homicidal egomaniacs with no nose.
The boys looked surprised but nodded in understanding- Teddy was at a good age where others usually started on how to use the loo.
It was heaven.
“One good thing about being outdoors is at least you can go anywhere and not worry about the mess you leave behind.” Harry moaned as another fart bubbled out of him.
PRRRRTTT!
BBBLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRrtttttttttttttt…
Harry grinned as he watched Draco’s face reddened, his lips forming a pout. “Seems like the coffee is working just fine for you though, babe.” He teased.
He reached for Draco’s hand, quickly pulling the other down on the couch and he shifted so now Harry was the one that was on Draco’s lap.
Harry took a shaky breath before giving the other a deep kiss.
In the end, Harry and Draco agreed that their plan for potty training Teddy was quite a success.
With a few more poots and a last fart that was wet enough to paint the bush yellowish-brown one more time, Draco sighed as he finally straightened up, wincing at the pain in his back from bending over for too long.
He opened his eyes once more and looked down, his concentration focused as he expelled more waste into the toilet.
It had actually been Draco who had unintentionally broken the ice on that front.
Before them laid a large and fuzzy looking rug, with flowers arranged around and platters of fruits, chocolates and glasses of champagne beside it.
Mother. Father was uncomfortable in regards to things like this, so Mother took it upon herself to teach me instead.”
"Draco! Come and I'll help wipe you down in case you miss a spot." Harry offered, gesturing for the blond to come to him. After all, since his lover had wiped him down a number of times in the past, Harry could finally return the favor.
With a small smile on his lips, Harry closed his eyes and gave a hard grunt.
Harry sighed.
Why did he keep thinking about that scene?
He watched the other squint his eyes slightly as he looked down, his entire face twisting in concentration as he gave another push with a short grunt.
As Teddy was distracted with his dessert of sticky toffee pudding, Harry and Draco discussed how they would go about with Teddy’s potty training.
He was later told that mostly pureblood families still expelled their waste this way, more out of tradition then anything else. But there were halfbloods and even muggle-borns who preferred the wizarding way of going as well.
"Okay, you're all good to go. This will make things easier for you." Harry announced and not a moment too soon as Draco immediately painted the bush with yellowish brown diarrhea.
Draco grimaced but he wasn’t surprised by the other’s reply. “Please tell me you at least brought some tissue with you for us to use?” He begged, not wanting to use leaves like he heard some other Muggles did while camping (he shuddered at the thought of his bum being massacred by the roughness of wildlife).
They both stayed there for a long time, enjoying the full moon and the stars that sparkled brighter than they would ever be able to from the city.
Just being on the safe side.
“Okay, so when you need to go poopy, put the seat down and pull down your pants and knickers- you can take it all off if you’re more comfortable doing so.” Harry explained.
Good news: the doll was brought up during the explosion and now safely back in her arms with little damage done.
Sniffing the air and finding it tolerable again, Draco fixed his pants, making sure he vanished everything properly and did a quick Tergeo as well. He would still need a shower (cleaning spells were alright but the feeling of dirtiness never truly went away unlike a nice warm bath does) but he wanted to cuddle with his lover for a while before they can both bathe, together.
So they made a compromise. They would instead go on something that Harry had learned from Hermione when she had come back from visiting her parents in Australia- Glamping.
What a ridiculous situation they were in.
I guess it was finally time.
Teddy looked at the blond, tilting his head to one side as he had a thoughtful look on his face. Suddenly his eyes widened as he said, “Excuse me!” The little boy smiled widely as Draco nodded at him and patted his head.
BRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!
Harry sighed as he tried to find the right words to say. “I’m fine. It’s just…growing up, Muggles find the act of soiling oneself as…not normal. I guess it was just a…culture shock that it was considered as normal here and my brain is trying to just adjust to it.”
His best friend frowned at him. “Yes. Harry, there’s nothing wrong with it- yes, it may seem strange to us who lived among Muggles in our younger years and have adapted to certain Muggle customs, but here in the Wizarding World? It’s considered the norm here.”
PRRRRTTTT!
They both shared a laugh as Harry wiped himself off as Draco finished pushing out the log and with a small poot, was also finished.
“Everything will be fine, Andy.” Harry assured her, smiling down at the toddler who was now distracted with his favorite toy- a ‘werebear’ (half werewolf, half bear).
Draco paused as he looked back at him. “I need to let myself out for a bit- I’ll be right back.”
“Hm?” Teddy looked up from one of his blocks.
“It’s not normal.”
That night, both slumbering boys laid in each other’s arms, bodies intertwined, and loving smiles on both of their faces.
As Harry was in the middle of telling Draco about Andromeda asking if they could look after Teddy next weekend while she planned to take a weekend getaway with Narcissa to France (the two sisters had made up after the war and were inseparable nowadays- always visiting each other almost everyday) Draco put his cup down and made to stand up.
While Bill and Fleur were on their date night, Victoire chose to be watched by her favorite uncles Harry and Draco (which the couple always boasted about being her favorites during the Weasley Sunday Dinners).
And with that, Harry could finally go.
Draco groaned as he let Harry go and stood up, crouching a bit as he held his slight pooching tummy. “I think I gotta go.”
Prrrrrrrrrttt!
"Hold on, love. I guess it was a good thing that you took off your clothes after all" Harry noted as he moved closer to the other. Draco gave a grunt in agreement as his embarrassment ebbed away and started to give in to his body’s needs.
As Draco slapped away another mosquito from his arm, he let out a groan in frustration. “Harry! I know we agreed to do this with no magic involved, but can we please be allowed to cast a bug repellent spell? I feel like a blood buffet right now.” Draco pleaded.
“But even once Muggle plumbing was finally adopted into then Wizarding World, there are still some of those- mainly those who grew up in the Wizarding world- who still choose to relieve themselves in the traditional way.” Hermione finished.
“The topic itself is practically taboo to them.” Harry said as another violent fart came out of Draco’s arse at the same time.
“Actually, I wanted to ask you two a favor. Teddy is almost two now and I think this would be the right time for him to learn how to be potty trained.” She explained. “I would teach him myself but I think you two might be better at this- with being males and all.”
When Harry saw his boyfriend finally meeting his eyes, he grinned widely and winked.
BRAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!...
Draco blushed as he looked back at his boyfriend, meeting his gaze straight in the eyes. He saw nothing but love and acceptance in them. “Really?”
Teddy giggled again, but nodded in understanding.
Letting the waters soothe his tired body, Harry floated around, playing with some of the fishes that swam by them (Harry had made sure to vanish all their soap and waste residue in order to keep the waters clean for the fishes).
One thing led to another and somehow Victoire’s favorite dolly accidentally got flushed down the toilet as well.
He quickly walked out of the room, heading straight to the loo. He was about to lower his knickers before he remembered that their toilet was currently unavailable.
“Now that’s absolutely rancid, dear.” Draco gave a small gag, before snorting at Harry’s fart itself.
And what a sight it was.
“What?!” Harry squeaked, looking at his lover incredulously.
Teddy looked disappointed that he wasn’t able to do the spell, but he was determined to do it right one day.
Taking sips of his coffee, Harry felt a familiar pull in his bladder and he felt himself start to sweat a bit.
After they finished with the rest of their breakfast, Draco started with the dishes while Harry cleared the table and put everything away.
“Lunch?” Harry wandlessly casted a tempus spell and blinked when he saw that it was almost 12 in the afternoon. As if realizing the lack of food, Harry’s stomach gave an audible growl right then. “Well, I supposed we should then.” He said sheepishly.
Harry reached over as he rubbed his boyfriend's stomach. "Don't strain too much, Draco. Try to relax your stomach and take deep breaths before giving another push." He instructed to the other.
Draco nodded as he followed his boyfriend's advice and slowly, the log slid its way out, landing with a thud on the bush. From what Harry could see, the log was about a half an inch thick but about 7 inches long.
On the other hand, Harry was staring in between his lover’s legs, a big bulge starting to tent in his pants as poop started to come out.
Shaking his thoughts away for now, Harry watched as Draco looked to be close to finished.
Harry nodded. “Of course! In fact, what was that burp-fart thing you did? It was completely adorable!”
Draco was looking at Teddy and spoke, “Now Teddy, because you’re only starting with your training, you may not be able to wipe yourself well enough and that might cause you to get a rash or even sick. So when you’re done, make sure to call someone to help clean you, alright? When you get more used to it, then you may try to clean yourself. But for now, please ask for help. Here, I’ll help clean Harry right now.”
“Harry’s right. Teddy is in good hands, Aunt.” Draco agreed, putting a comforting hand on her arm. “Now you go and enjoy yourself- and please tell mother to do the same.”
Harry had been telling Draco a funny story about something that happened in the Gryffindor dorms when it happened.
“…I wish I knew magic back then.” Harry muttered, watching as Draco’s briefs could no longer contain all the mess inside and began to seep out through the bottom portion, coloring the pale back legs brown.
Both boys made that vow with Teddy, just to be reassured that the toddler wouldn’t tell everyone about his gassy Uncle Harry or that his Cousin Draco pooped his knickers.
Unsure of exactly what happened, but what the men could understand through Victoire’s crying was that when they were busy washing the dishes after dinner, the little girl thought it would be a fun idea to see how many things could be flushed down their toilet.
(=^w^=)**************************
(=^w^=)**************************
Harry whimpered as he felt his stomach cramp even more. Then his eyes widened as he felt his anus suddenly open and felt the tip of something hard turtlehead out between his cheeks.
“Places like Hogwarts believes proper plumbing was better than a simple disappearing spell. There actually is no such thing as a "disappearing" spell. Even in the Wizarding World, matter cannot be created or destroyed, meaning the witches and wizards were presumably transporting their waste elsewhere - maybe to a waste pit.
Draco sighed. “Of course not, Harry. Hermione said it herself- to prevent any accidents or ill-will, Hogwarts makes it so I have to use the facilities here.” He reminded the other.
Another spell, Rhinal Anasenthsia, was a similar spell that actually cancels out the entire smell entirely for a very long period of time and by the time the spell ran out, the smell would have long dissipated. But it was dangerous because done wrongly could result in permanently losing one’s sense of smell forever.
Harry gave them a hug, followed by Draco who did the same, “It’s completely alright. She’s just barely three years old and she didn’t know any better.” He assured them.
The blond pretty much went when he wanted to and wherever he wanted to as long as it was in their house and as long as they had no guest.
As soon as he was naked and inside the tub, Harry had let go, moaning in relief as his piss came out in a hard stream, a puddle of yellow piss forming in the tub.
Not long after, Draco suddenly gasped as his grabbed his stomach and a series of juicy, wet-slick farts was pushed out.
After about 15 more minutes, Draco jaw dropped as they entered through the ‘shield’ that Harry had casted yesterday and saw where they would be staying at until tomorrow.
Teddy nodded. “Potty in the loo?”
“Ok, now who’s hungry?” Harry asked, watching the two men he loved the most in the world with a large smile on his face.
Draco was grinning as he listened to the story and opened his mouth to let out a laugh, but instead he ending up letting out a loud burp instead.
“Teddy?” He called out to his godson.
Draco also looked surprised as he looked down to see his mess and blushed hard. “Oh no. I thought it would be a dry one.” He confessed sheepishly, peeking at his lover with a red tint on his cheeks. He was embarrassed that what he thought was only a fart had actually been a shart.
When the sun was finally down, Harry used his magic and grinned when his lover let out a gasp when their entire campsite was lit in twinkling fairy lights and soft glowing lanterns, giving in the area very romantic feel.
Harry smiled wryly at his godson’s enthusiasm before taking another deep breath and begun.
Because of this, most people just stuck to the first spell which came in handy during times when Harry had to change his godson’s Teddy’s diaper or when he and his lover were dropping arse between them.
It had been challenging enough that one time when he had pooped on the toilet in front of both his lover and godson when they were potty training the little tyke.
Harry lifted his head to even peek at the other side of the bed. There was no puddle as well- which was a given since he had seen it vanish right before his eyes.
“The potential would be there for the spells to go wrong, with quite humiliating results. Also, it’s not hard to imagine the potential for chaos if bullies decided to use this to prey on their unpopular victims, transporting feces into their bed-chamber or school-bags. In the end, Hogwarts decided to forbid the use of spells outside classrooms, which would have also prohibited this.
And Victoire loved her Uncle Draco. As in, he was her first love. He was just so pretty even though he was a man and even spoke to her in French- like her maman!
At least Harry could now cook for someone who appreciated his efforts and Harry could even eat his own creations- unlike when he was living with the Dursley’s.
Harry had been so lost in his thoughts that he barely even noticed the hand being waved in front of his face.
Harry’s jaw was dropped during her explanation. He shook his head, trying to absorb all this new information. “Wait, so wizards or witches will still choose to go in their knickers on purpose?”
Crinkling his nose at the smell that still lingered around him, Draco wordlessly (but still needed his wand) casted Olefacio minuere. He liked to to cast that spell last since it was an annoyance to cast it repeatedly while he was trying to focus on clearing his bladder and bowels.
As he walked away, he turned to say something to the other but found himself pausing as he saw what was happening.
“Try saying it more clearer- Ev-An-Nes-Co” Draco sounded each syllable slowly.
They played with Teddy, everyone having fun as Harry and Draco would chase the little boy around the house and charmed his toys to fly and have little battles together.
When he saw that Harry was done, he went to wipe up his lover, letting out a surprise laugh when Harry accidentally farted as he did so. Although Harry was embarrassed that he farted on his lover’s hand, Draco waved it off saying that it was at least dry.
“Draco’s going to show you how it’s done for only wizards, alright?” Harry asked his godson.
The boxer-briefs were very soft under his touch, and of course completely dry.
Burping and farting was fine. It was just different with pooping- that was more intimate, made him feel more vulnerable.
Harry loved watching the amazement on his two favorite boy’s faces as they looked around their surroundings.
Harry also recalled that Draco never used spells to hide the sounds he made or tried to hide the sight of what was going on. The only spells he casted was when he rid of all the evidence once everything was already done.
BRrrraaaAAAAPPPPPP!
The three of them were sitting at the dining room, eating the last of the bangers and mash that Harry had cooked for their dinner.
Draco chuckled as he removed the hands from his mouth, but continued holding them in his own. “More like a voyeurism fetish.”
Draco grinned as he casted Olefacio minuere once more. “And that’s the gist of it. So what do you think?”
“Ebanesco!” Teddy yelled out. Harry checked his diaper but the mess was still there.
“Hawwy!”
“Ahhhhhh….mmmm…” Draco sighed, lightly rubbing his flattened belly with one hand as he slowly got his bearings back.
To Harry, he honestly still didn’t know quite what to think of what had occurred last night- not the sex though, that was great.
Prrrrrttt!
Even as he memorized the wonderful vision before him- Draco truly was the most beautiful man Harry had ever met- it did nothing to quell the thoughts that continued to float in his mind.
“Me neither. I actually don’t like to camp but I thought that if it was with you, I might find myself enjoying it.” Harry murmured, running his fingers through the blond’s silky hair.
Draco gave Harry a panicked look and Harry quickly reached for Teddy to pull the little boy away, who thankfully just missed getting wet from the growing puddle.
Teddy woken up an hour later and the trio went back to the living room together to once again play with the little boy.
“Nee’ to pee.” Draco mumbled sleepily, covering his mouth as another yawn left him.
This lasted for about 5 minutes before Draco told Harry to bring his bag. With an Accio, Harry handed the bag to Draco.
He pulled his lover along and sat down on the rug, urging the blond to do the same. His grin widened when he heard the soft moan the other let out as they sunk into the rug’s unexpected softness.
Without looking away from the other’s bottom half, Harry absentmindedly spoke. “Muggles. The Dursley’s especially. The act of wetting and defecating oneself is considered not normal…shameful, disgusting even.”
Harry’s diarrhea was more on the greener side and more chunkier than Draco’s.
He then remembered that he and Draco were currently Glamping and must have fallen asleep after having another good shag.
Draco blushed again but didn’t stop him as he watched as his lover’s face twist and a few moments later, a small *POOT* could be heard.
At once the rancid smell of rotting rubbish disappeared. Teddy also gasped at this.
Harry nodded and gave the blond a kiss on the cheek before turning to leave the room.
But the thought of actually soiling himself in the wizardly way was a bit too much for Harry still. Reminded him too much of his childhood and how he had been degraded for it.
He blinked as he looked at his lover, who looked at him with concern.
Teddy started giggling at the funny sound. “Dwaco poot!”
The blond began to push out a fairly solid yellowish log, slowly inching its way out from his bum. Draco’s face twisted a little in strain as he had difficulty getting his poop out.
Wide eyes behind round glasses widened as a small brown spot bloomed right at the middle of the other’s arse before the small dot slowly became larger and wider.
Harry held up one hand, trying to redirect his focus from his bottom half to manifesting his magic and called out, “Accio, bog roll.”
He was still poo-shy, but at least around Draco he was able to confidently let himself go in front of his lover.
They all waved goodbye to Andromeda as she disappeared through the floo.
Harry demonstrated as he spoke and let out a sigh in relief as his urine hit the bowl. “Make sure you aim correctly so your pee doesn’t go everywhere.” He warned.
Harry nodded. “Wow. That’s pretty interesting. I didn’t think of how different it would be to be trained in stuff like this.” It seemed he continued to learn new things everyday in the Wizarding World.
“I love you Draco Malfoy. I’m so happy we can be here together now.” Harry told the other truthfully, radiating out all the love he had onto the other.
“Ooh-ohhhhh…” Draco moaned as he could feel his fart explode out of him before taking its time to come out in a gurgling-bubbly fashion, sounding so wet that Draco wondered if it would leave a stain in his knickers.
Harry hummed as he swallowed the bite of toast in his mouth. “I’ll come too- we also need to pick up some more ice cream at Florean’s since we’ve run out.”
Harry let out a tired laugh that was followed by a yawn. “Morning to you too.” He greeted softly, his voice a bit rough. He knew that Draco was not a morning person and barely functioned properly before his morning cup of tea or coffee.
They both giggled together as Harry grab his wand and cast an Olefacio minuere spell.
In the past 8 years, Harry had learned many things in his new world and learned to accept the differences between Wizarding World and Muggle World.
Teddy frowned at that but nodded. He didn’t want to hurt the loo after all.
Sniffling loudly, Harry reached up to wipe his face but Draco beat him to it, wiping away his tears with the blond’s clean hand.
“Okay, what did you have in mind…mnh!…with Teddy?” Draco asked, grunting a bit as he pushed a booming blast of gas out, his face red with the effort.
Seeing the look that Harry always became weak against, he nodded and stayed where he was at. “Oh, well, okay then. No, I’ll stay. Just wanted to make sure with you.” He said quickly, not wanting to upset the other more.
This is what Harry had wanted. He loved seeing his lover out in the wild, feeling good and free enough to just rip arse with no care to what was around them. Yeah, the blond usually did that at home, but it was different when they were out in the open, with no walls hiding them in.
Which made some sense because they never needed to hold it in for long (only needing to excuse themselves to find a bit of privacy or if they were confident enough and with the right spells, could go right where they were without anyone finding out (the robes that wizards wore could hide anything underneath them).
He quickly held his bum together, horrified at what was happening.
His lover wore a light blue cashmere sweater paired with a form-fitting khaki pants that Harry loved since it showed off his significant other’s arse perfectly.
Harry was quiet, taking it all in. He then turned to his right with a questioning look at his boyfriend who also returned the same look back at him. “Do you do that also?”
Other than his normal morning wood, nothing else changed as he thought of that scene.
Yes, Draco was one the number one reason Harry would never regret returning to Hogwarts for.
“Oh there are a few ways I can think of to enjoy ourselves.” Draco winked and Harry needed no more before he pulled the blonde over him to song him senseless.
Pbbbbllllttttt…
Draco and he had throughly christened their bedroom for the first time and many times over, in fact.
The older lady gave them all a hug goodbye and held onto her grandson a bit more longer as she hugged him last. “You be good while I’m gone, okay Teddy?” She said as she kissed his forehead.
When they were done with lunch, the two had decided to take a walk about the woods and ended up taking skinny dip in the stream, while playing with the small fishes that had swarm around the two.
Fantastic.
Absentmindedly, Harry wordlessly and wandlessly casted another Olefacio minuere, although he wasn’t sure why since the only sense that was working for him right now was his sense of sight.
Harry grinned, proud that all his hard work yesterday had paid off. “You haven’t even seen the best part yet. Come on.” He grabbed his lover’s hand and together they walked to the reason why Harry chose that location in the first place.
“Go start on the shower first, love. I’ll follow when I’m done.” Draco told him, soaping up one of the mugs.
They walked a few feet away from the campsite, stopping in front of a few trees.
“Sowwy, Unca Hawwy…” Victoire sobbed, her little arms around Draco’s neck.
When the laughter finally ended Draco reluctantly looked back at the other.
The last time Draco felt like this was also on that fateful and unforgettable day, during their eighth year in Hogwarts.
He watched as Draco shifted slightly, making sure that none of his fluids hit any of the furniture.
Draco turned to the side, seeing the apprehension in the other’s expression. The blond nodded. “Of course you can join me, Harry. But make sure you take off your clothes like I did or they may get dirty.” He warned.
Harry looked around to make sure that he was still alone and then proceeded to give a few experimental pushes.
Laying in bed, both of them were nude although not because they had made love, but because they had wanted to feel one another’s body against their own, wanting to feel the warmth and protection and love as their naked bodies touched every inch together.
Harry covered the steaks and walked around the table. “I’ll come with you- I gotta go too anyway.”
Harry nodded. “Trust me- I don’t think I look at anyone even one-fourth as much as I look at you.” Draco grinned, an expression full of pride on his face.
“Ok, grandma! I be good. Have fun wit Gwandma Cissy!” Teddy chirped.
Harry wondered about Draco’s words. From the start, the blond had never seeked for privacy or wore/done anything to hide what he was doing from Harry.
They finally came to a compromise that he would finish his final year at Hogwarts (Hermione), find a place that wasn’t Grimmauld Place- somewhere at least decently habitable (Molly) and reach the age of at least 21 years old (Andromeda). As long as he did this, then he would be able to take Teddy in as his own.
They went back to their campsite and Draco helped Harry with their meal (and by helping, he placed the ready-prepared ingredients in the pots). When everything was left cooking, the two decided to kip on the sofa for a short nap.
“Me and Cousin Draco wanted to talk to you about something.” Harry said gently. Teddy tilted his head, looked at Draco who smiled at him softly before turning his head back to Harry.
Unlike someone like Draco who grew up with this type of behavior, it was normal for him because there was never a time or a reason to ever think it wouldn’t be. Because he never grew up with these prejudices, he couldn’t be considered strange for not following what muggles considered the norm.
“It’s the same for me as well. I never go in front of anyone else.” Draco admitted.
“That was bloody BRILLIANT!” Draco felt warmed by the other’s reaction.
“The spell is easy enough that most can do it wandlessly. It’s called, Quietus. It’ll-mmm …make any sounds you make quieter, perhaps even silent depending on how loud it actually is. This spell is not as strong as Silencio or Muffliato, but it’ll be easy for you to learn. I’ll show you the spell, watch carefully-uh!” He gave a loud grunt as he felt another log broke off.
“Are you alright Harry? You were a bit quiet there for a moment. Is something wrong?” Draco questioned.
Harry grinned as he kissed the other again. He suddenly felt a pull from his bladder, which made him pull away. “I have to go to the loo first- you go ahead.” Draco nodded as he got off the bed, heading towards the kitchen.
Teddy’s eyes were wide at the thought that he would be taught a spell. Cool!
Draco chuckled, as he nodded. “More like brunch at this point really. What are you in the mood for? Maybe a sandwich…roast beef sound good?”
Cuffing Harry’s cheek with one hand, Draco tilted the others face up so their eyes met.
“Thank Merlin for our metabolisms or we would be as fat as pigs by now.” Draco shifted in the sofa to make himself comfortable.
Draco snorted but grinned back. “It’ll be your turn next, Professor Potter.” He teased back.
Draco grinned and leaned forward, with his bum still letting out a torrent of toxic gas, as he captured the other’s lips in a deep kiss.
The trio had lunch at one of the places in the zoo, where they all enjoyed some fish and chips with mushy peas and ate ice cream cones as they continued around the zoo.
Harry sighed and shook his head. “You know that magic makes things trickier when it comes to Muggle things- especially plumbing. I think we’ll need a professional.”
After playtime was over, it was time for dinner.
In order to keep them from using magic (mainly Draco), they each handed the other their wands and Harry casted a spell so they would not be able to use their own wand for 24 hours unless the other gave it to them.
Harry quickly shook his head and gave the other a reassuring smile. “I’m fine love, just a bit tired. The coffee probably isn’t working as well today.” He lied.
“Right. And I need to strengthen the wards as well.”  Harry sighed, finally giving in and resigning himself that it was finally time to leave their warm nest.
Harry sighed as his gut released the poisonous gas within, making it lighter.
“Ok, so here’s his bag and here’s….” Andromeda rattled out as she held out her wand to cast a spell to enlarge all of Teddy’s things.
The following day, the two boys trekked through the woods towards their campsite. One of the compromises they made was that they would be doing this entirely the Muggle way (with just a bit a magic allowed).
Draco looked at him with great worry, confused on why his lover was trying so hard to keep himself from soiling himself.
They got Victoire to smile again with Draco speaking comforting words to the little girl in French while Harry made sure to serve her an extra  large piece of her favorite cherry dessert.
Harry gently ran the tissue over his lover's bum, taking loving care when he wiped off the lingering poop from his lover's dirtied arsehole.
Draco huffed but a smile laid on his lips as he played with the dark strands, letting it slip through his fingers. “I know you’re waking up, Love. I actually thought you would sleep the whole day away.”
Harry had prepared them a feast- with steaks cut up and roasted veggies on the side, potatoes baked in foil slathered with plenty of herb butter and garlic, a pot of black bean soup still bubbling, warm baked bread hot from the fire, and the main dish was a large skillet of paella that sat in the middle of it all.
Harry began peeing forcefully into the bushes. When the stream finally tampered off, he shook himself dry, before jumping at the sound of a throat clearing.
“I think it’s time we head back.” Draco suggested, straightening the loose curls from Teddy’s head (for that day, Teddy went with blond curls, alike a combination of Harry and Draco’s own).
As consciousness stared to evade his mind, other things also began entering his thoughts as well- including the memory of yesterday’s little happening.
Harry giggled, coughing a bit as a putrid stench lifted up to his nostrils. “It stinks, Love.”
“But I learned best by actual example- not by Mother, of course- but I had many ‘play dates’ with other kids my age and some of the older children who were already potty-trained basically demonstrated how it was properly done. By the time I was five, I was properly potty trained in both ways.” Draco finished.
Taking a deep breath, Harry gathered all his Gryffindor courage and decided to just do it. If Draco could relieve himself unabashedly in front of Harry on a nearly daily basis, then so can he.
They grabbed some of the soap and body wash from Draco’s bag and cleaned themselves off properly.
Harry bit his lip as he looked away. “Nothing.”
About five days later, Harry found himself absolutely miserable.
Harry winced at his last name being used. “Of course not, dear. That would be very…impolite and improper of me.” he apologized, giving the blonde puppy eyes as he wrapped an arm around the other.
Draco had snorted when he saw what Harry had gotten- another children’s book, but the title was ‘Does it Fart? The definitive guide to animal flatulence.’
Teddy and Harry cackled loudly as Draco blushed, but soon enough the blond also joined in their laughter. “Excuse me.” He chuckled.
Draco wore only a pair of light gray boxer-briefs that he just barely put on after their nightly activities (the blonde hated sleeping in the nude, even after sex).
“I really love you, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry had his jaw dropped and both boys stared at each other with wide eyes for a long moment.
Draco was not an animal person, but what he did enjoy was observing all the exotic plants when they visited the Botanical garden portion. Now it was Harry’s turn to convince the blond that he could not nick any of the Nepenthes plants to make potions out of.
Harry didn’t really understand his thoughts, but at the same time, he understood a little more of how he felt now.
“I can’t believe I’m about to urinate on a tree like a dog would.”  Draco sighed as he lowered his pants until his cock sprung free and aimed at the lower trunk.
“Thank goodness for magic.” He murmured to himself. Even though camping (or Glamping in their case) was fun, they would have been miserable if they didn’t have the help of magic along the way.
“Thank you, Harry.” Draco said softly, nuzzling his nose to the other’s shoulder. “Without you, I would have never even imagine camping could be like this.”
Casting a wandless Olefacio minuere, Harry sighed as the smell cleared.
Unable to help himself, he let his hands fall lower, gently cupping the other buttcheeks in his palms.
The conversation stopped there, but Harry spent the rest of the day thinking about what had transpired.
Harry couldn’t look away. Wasn’t even sure if he was supposed to or not but all he could do was watch as the other continued to fart and poop himself. Harry could only remain silent as he watched the small chunks of poop that made its way in the cess pit that was pooling around Draco’s feet.
Finally when Draco gave one more push and the only thing that came out was a small poot, it was done.
As soon as Draco bent over to open the lower shelf, a loud fart sound came out of nowhere, making Draco jump back up and cover his bum with his hand.
Draco grinned as he remembered that day. Even though he still blushed when he recalled their first time sharing their gas, he had no regrets on how it all turned it.
“Harry?” The other wizard suddenly snapped out of his stupor before finally noticing his lover was right in front of him now, nice and clean with no evidence of what just occurred earlier. Green eyes looked up to meet the familiar grey eyes that he loved so much.
When Teddy nodded, the entire room was quiet for a while until the sound of piss finally trickled off. “When you’re done, give your peepee a shake, you can dab it with some tissue to make sure it’s all dry before you can put your clothes back on.” Harry did so slowly, letting Teddy watch his actions.
Just like Draco was weak against green eyes, Harry was equally a sucker for his boyfriend’s lovely grey eyes, especially when they looked at him the way they were right now.
Draco yawned as he cuddled closer to Harry’s chest. “Mmnnin…”
Chester Zoo was one of the world’s best zoos and had over 20,000 animals inside.
“We’re so sorry Harry, Draco.” Bill apologized, adjusting his little sleeping girl in his arms.
“Wait- where are you going?” Harry found himself asking.
After another round of sex on the river rocks, the couple made their way back to their campsite where Draco decided to relax with his book while Harry prepared dinner, music from their radio playing quietly around them.
Harry was quiet for a moment but when he saw Draco leave he quickly said, “Um, it’s fine! You can do it here. I mean, we’re already done with lunch and my coffee is gone and…yeah…” he trailed off, as he gestured at their empty dishes.
Or when the other was almost stiff during their cuddle times- especially after that Dutch-oven incident a few days ago.
Draco sighed as he flipped the page of his book, shifting a little in the hammock he hung from.
Harry watched the various emotions flit across his lover’s face (fury was one that stood out the most).
Draco moved back a little to give him a dirty look. As he opened his mouth to say something, instead a quick burp came out and the blonde’s eyes widened just as Harry felt more than heard a mild vibrating on his lap.
Later that night, they both slipped into Draco’s bed that night. For the 8th years, they were split into genders and it was four people per room; in order to promote interhouse unity, it was usually one person from each house per room.
But Harry remembered that it was only Draco and Teddy and they both loved him and would never judge him for anything.
Teddy shouted and clapped his hands in amazement.
Draco rolled his eyes, but smirked as let his own burp out in retort, “Urppppp-Oh!” He felt a short fart, pooting out of his bum by accident.
With a practiced motion of his hand, Draco was once again dry, all proof of the fluid he expelled suddenly vanished.
Both men agreed that the easiest way to teach Teddy is by example and since the boy was only two, they doubted the little boy would remember clearly about how the two adults relieved themselves in front of him, but would hopefully focus on the actual techniques of potty training itself.
Draco couldn’t help but let out a giggle at that. “That was really pathetic, Harry.” He teased.
“Well, I wanted to make sure we both enjoyed our little getaway together.” Harry winked, biting into a slice of pineapple that his boyfriend fed to him in return.
Harry’s mind was once again swirling, flashbacks of what just happened going through his mind.
Draco giggled as he hugged the other back, his mood already lightening.
Teddy, who had calmed down now, nodded and then asked innocently, “Can I see inside?”
“No, we do not play with the toilet- it’ll end up breaking and then we won’t have a loo.” Harry told him sternly.
“I grew up with those beliefs. Was punished for those beliefs. For all the accidents I had because I couldn’t hold it anymore…because they didn’t let me use the loo more than twice a day…because I didn’t know I was a wizard so I wasn’t taught that I could ‘vanish’ it away…” Harry continued, not noticing that his lover’s concerned eyes were now on him.
Pprrtt!
Harry heard his lover fart and chuckled as he threw more sticks into the fire. “Nice one, babe.” He called out, letting out his own gas in reply. The blond looked up from his book to give him a wink.
“-You’ll do nothing because then you’ll end up in Azkaban and I really don’t want my efforts in keeping you out of there go to waste.” Harry told him gently. Draco harrumphed but knew the other was right.
Draco blushed but nodded as he made his way to his boyfriend. Harry motioned for him to turn around and Draco followed, bending over slightly so Harry could wipe him down.
He gave a jump and looked at the other with wide eyes, only realizing that Draco was in front of him, completely clean now as he looked at Harry with a sad smile.
“Harry, this is…perfect.” Draco breathed out, looking at their campsite in awe.
Teddy’s eyes brightened as he nodded fervently- he was gonna do magic!
Draco frowned at him but before he could comment, a small but audible burp suddenly escaped his lips, followed by a sharp fart.
Teddy nodded and after a few more times, he tried the spell again. “Evanesco!”
It made the brunette’s heart warm knowing that the other was that comfortable around him and it made things more fun whenever they would have sometimes have little fart contests and end up giggling together, with no winner in the end as they ended up either snogging or shagging. Actually, maybe they were both the winner?
Harry always had a large appetite but the past few days, the other had struggled to finish his plate, waving it off with an excuse that he had snacked on something earlier and was full.
“UURRP! Ahhh…that was great.” Harry burped, groaning in satisfaction as he dropped down on the sofa, patting his full belly. They had just came home from dinner, after celebrating their first day of living together.
Draco gave him the ‘look’ as he placed one hand on his rumbling stomach while giving shifting his gaze to Teddy.
After a while, Draco’s diarrhea slowly lessened and he started to pass small chunks of solid feces instead. Harry on the other hand started to become more gassier as he passed more liquidy poop this time.
Harry froze before giving his lover an innocent look. “Um, I’ll buy you two pints this time.”
“Ok, so the first thing to do is that when you feel like you need to go, make sure to go to the loo first. We got you a mini version so it would be easier for you to use.” Harry gestured towards the little seat that he and Draco had gotten earlier.
Harry made a sympathetic noise as he rubbed his boyfriend's back for comfort. The stench of their afterdinner permeated the air, but it wasn’t too bad since they were out in the open, with the winds blowing away the smells being made. "Was it the bean soup, maybe?” Harry wondered. He had second guessed himself while making it, but beans was a staple when one went camping.
Draco harrumphed, keeping his face hidden in the other’s neck as he audibly gave a loud grunt, pushing a messy and wetter- sounding fart out of him.
Where they went was to the souvenir shop, where Harry bought Teddy a bedtime cuddle set that consisted of a children’s book, a bath bomb and a stuffed monkey- one that looked exactly like the baby chimpanzee from earlier.
Covering himself, Harry turned to see his lover standing a few feet away.
"Uh, Draco? I don’t think you’re the only one that got affected. I think dinner's finally starting to hit me too. Is it okay if I go next to you?" Harry asked, not really waiting for an answer as he was already taking off his pants.
They actually had a camping oven and stove set up where Harry quickly prepared two lovely dishes of pasta with a light clam butter sauce with a side of dressed greens.
contact making it obvious to the other that the blonde’s own tummy was currently rumbling in disarray.
As he read, Draco could feel a slight bubble in his lower bowels. He lifted one of his legs a little and pushed a good healthy fart right out.
“We all mistakes, Victoire.” Harry reassured the sobbing girl in his arms.
Harry gave him a warm smile and he leaned in to place a soft kiss on the side of the other’s forehead. “I made sure to cast protective spells so we wouldn’t have any uninvited guest at our campsite and also did a protective barrier to prevent any of us from accidentally falling over this cliff.” He reached his hand out and it met with an invisible resistance, proving his point.
