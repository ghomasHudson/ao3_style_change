Two days after Potter had announced he would start wooing Draco, he was on his way to Wiltshire. His destination: the Malfoy Manor. When his Apparition landed outside the gates, he suppressed a shiver and moved forwards. A house elf popped in front of him right outside the door, asking for his name and business.
Potter saw Draco’s eyes crinkle as he was suppressing a smile. The faint blush that was colouring Draco’s cheeks was barely noticeable in the TL light, but it seemed that Potter had become very finely attuned to every one of Draco’s reactions.
Potter snatched it away from him, receiving a dark look. “No. We’re doing it the other way around. You talk and I give you chocolate if I’m satisfied.”
Hello hello! I have returned! Have you missed me? I guess you missed me. I'm so missable. No, not miserable. Missable. Let's break it down into syllables.
I think it's clear enough, but to be sure. From here on, there will be excerpts from the book 'How to Deal with Draco Malfoy 101'. These excerpts will be in cursive and in quotation marks. It'll be rather obvious when you see it.
“Oh yes, Harry, we would be glad to chaperone you and Draco.” Pansy laughed. “Are you truly courting him then?”
“Oh come on, we have a house for twenty. Papa just likes to be extravagant,” Aquila said while hopping in, with James on her heals. They quickly started talking in hushed voices, completely absorbed in their own world.
Potter laughed. “It’s a good story, though. Isn’t your family French in origin? I believe Phi said something like that once.”
Potter picked up his tea and sunk down on the couch, next to Draco, with the chocolate bar in his hand. “I think it’s time for chocolate,” he announced.
“I am not feeding you more chocolate or ice cream,” Potter said sternly, resulting in a slump of Draco’s shoulders. “But I can dance again.”
Potter felt slightly dizzy, knowing now for sure what he hadn’t acknowledged before. He remembered to nod in response to Draco’s favourite chocolate, but wasn’t able to process anything else.
Now, Draco knew from Hogwarts that the Christmas tree was decorated with bells and a tree topper, but he couldn’t for the life of him find out where he could buy such decorations. He had a small collection of tinsel, garlands and light at the Lodge, but that would never be enough for a complete and satisfying result.
“Unfortunately, I think you’ll be having two five-year-olds added to your family soon.” Hermione pointed to Draco some hundred metres away, on his knees in the sand, with Lysander under his arm. They were building a sandcastle, Lorcan collecting shells nearby to decorate the castle with. He bounded up to Draco with a big shell in his hand, proudly showing his treasure. Draco looked at it with wide eyes and in exaggerated awe. Together, they put the big shell on a twig and stuck that in the tower of the castle. Draco looked over his shoulder to see Harry and Hermione watching them, and he waved.
“We have to talk,” Draco said at Neville’s dumbfounded expression. Neville just nodded and didn’t say anything else until they were in the greenhouses Neville used for his research, a place Draco thought was safe enough, since Cassie was at lunch and no one else was allowed to come in here.
While Draco scoffed, Harry smiled as if he secretly agreed with the children. As soon as Draco caught his eye, he straightened his face in an effort to hide it, but Draco already rolled his eyes and marched towards the stairs.
“You know you can call me Draco,” Draco smiled, trying to postpone answering for just a few seconds. “You wouldn’t be the only one.”
“Stupid pureblood rules,” Draco mumbled to himself. He said goodbye to Theresa and moved to his apartment, surprised when a note was stuck to his door.
Draco woke up from his trance, snatched the box from Potter’s hands and turned his back to the guy. To see Potter holding that was far too much for him to handle.
“Do you remember that evening that Blaise and I were visiting Draco and you were there as well? Draco told us that Neville plied him with Veritaserum. Apparently, Neville asked him what his type was. When it turned out to be a very specific description, he forced Draco to think about what it meant. Then, you and Draco played a Seeker’s game, if I understand correctly?”
” Draco continued in the same melody, throwing a smirk to Scorpius. Scorpius just raised an eyebrow in a poor imitation of Draco’s brow raise. A deep laugh rumbled from behind him.
Cassie grinned secretively. “You know that hoodie papa has? He wears it very often, right, and sometimes sticks his nose in the neck, as if to smell?”
“Could you hand these out for me?” Draco asked, handing James a pile of parchment, on which instructions are for the potion the class would be brewing today.
“They have this new gadget, a miniature Quidditch pitch with players and a Snitch, and it moves. You can even play with it like you’d play Wizarding Chess.”
“Please, call me Draco. I don’t particularly go by my last name anymore. If you don’t mind, of course.”
When Suzanne was gone, Potter raised an eyebrow. “Real smooth, Jamie. I wonder how she isn’t drooling all over you already.”
“I never would have thought to hear you speak so fondly of Luna,” she explained. “Never thought you might recommend her for
The second part even pried some tears from Draco, even though he pretended it didn’t. He mouthed along with the songs, smiling whenever he saw Potter watching him. The ending was even better in this musical than in the Disney film, resulting in a teary-eyed smile from Potter and a contented sigh from Draco.
Pansy let out a breath, forcibly relaxing her hands and pasting a smile for her friends. “All right. I’ll do my best.”
“And you lifted the surveillance on the Malfoy family, so you really made it up to us,” Blaise added.
Malfoys are blond, Professor,” Aquila grinned. “At least, according to my definitions, I am a Malfoy and I am not blond.”
He used his Auror training to find any sound, any movement that could have been from an Animagus, in case Draco had mastered that skill, but Potter heard nothing but his own breathing and beating heart.
Potter nodded. “I never want to give them back to Ginny. I feel like their mine, not hers. It’s ridiculous; she has never been a bad mother, and the children love her. It’s just that… I don’t know… It’s –“
Sighing, Draco took a binder from his bag and opened it at the right page. Both Neville and Potter bent over it to read what was inside.
“True. You keep every Snitch you’ve ever caught. You’re sentimental,” Phi answered around another bite of his dinner. Draco silently watched them and secretly loved the way Phi could say something neutral and make it sound like a small insult. Potter just grinned a bit wider with every insult Phi flung his way. He loved this kid.
After grumbling something, and after looking away from Lucius’s unimpressed look, Draco nodded. “’Course I do. Isn’t it obvious?”
“Malfoy,” McGonagall berated him softly. Draco ignored her pointedly and clenched his fist at Terence’s obvious smirk.
“I suppose it could be Atticus, yes. But he dislikes Gryffindors more than anything, or so he says.”
“Stop taunting me. I’ve given up. I will do whatever you want, whenever you want it. No complaints. Robotic obedience. That is what you wanted from me, isn’t it?”
“I am. Potter and I were just talking about how I was only using him to get to you. Are you sure about your sexuality?”
“But it does: to the trained eye, every ripple of muscle of a horse is a clue on how they’re feeling. Buckbeak made sure I knew he was annoyed with me, not for how I interacted with him, but for how I interacted with his boss, Hagrid, and the people Hagrid cared about. Horses are very social animals. They work just like humans.”
Feeling his cheeks heat, Draco sent Phi out of the room and glared at Potter, who was laughing loudly at Phi’s pronunciation of his name. After giving Potter a hug, Phi were to wait in the hallway. Draco watched the door close before turning back to Potter.
Draco grabbed Potter’s upper arm and squeezed. “Astoria was roped into this, just like Cassie was. All right?”
“I usually sleep without t-shirt, but I thought that might make you uncomfortable, so I threw on whatever I found in my closet,” Draco admitted sheepishly at Potter’s unconscious staring. He felt like a teenager with a sleep-over guest again.
“You shouldn’t confuse it with papa feeling unsettled, or not knowing what to do. When he doesn’t know how to respond, he folds his left hand over his right, and clenches his right hand together in a fist. His left hand conceals the fist, you see?” Phi continued explaining.
Aquila crumpled to the ground, hit by a Crucio that just wouldn’t stop. Her silence rattled Draco’s bones.
“Why did you ask me whether I was describing anyone?” he asked. He walked from where Neville was leaning against one of the plant beds to the other side of the greenhouse and stood there, his back turned to Neville while he waited for the Gryffindor to answer.
“I’ve never seen it,” Draco said sullenly. “My children have, but I never. I was too busy being polite to our guests.”
Cassie huffed, but let it go. It may have had something to do with the shiny Prophecy Balls that Aquila pointed out to her. Draco smiled at the sight of his children observing the things with sparkling eyes. Their admiration for everything glimmering and visibly valuable was definitely one of the typical Malfoy traits.
“Multiple reasons. For one, I find it rather interesting to know that you smell a certain cologne in your Amortentia. Secondly, Scorpius may have told me.”
Cassie frowned at him, tugging him back when he made to enter the warehouse. “They can’t be stupid enough to let Aquila keep her wand, can they?”
“No, you ought to know. It’s your right to ask.” He swallowed heavily, wringing his hands together in a futile attempt to calm himself.
“Are you still able to speak Parseltongue? Would you be able to open the Chamber?” Draco snapped. “I thought not. Just answer the question.”
James stared at him disbelievingly. “I don’t believe you,” he said, for good measure. “I think you are insecure. I think you feel like people won’t love you if you admit that you worry about things. I think you don’t believe Dad loves you. Maybe you think he’s going to leave you if aren’t the ‘perfect’, ‘strong’, ‘independent’ man he ‘thinks’ you are.”
“Because I’m really quite gone for you, even going as far as trying to learn a language with far too many vowels and strange tongue-twisting sounds.”
Draco has seen James talk to her quite a few times, and every time James would smile just a bit brighter, if she was looking. They would make a handsome couple.
“N- well. There was a note on my door a few months ago. After you had tried to explain to me what a Muggle Christmas entailed.”
“True. But I have students who are genuinely interested, who come to me after class to ask some additional questions. I even have an apprentice,” Draco smirked. At Pansy and Blaise’s surprised looks, he sank further into the cushions and started telling them of Neville’s research and Draco’s own experiments.
“No, I’m all out of secrets to tell. Although, I would like to speak to Potter in private, if that’s all right?"
“No, they’re on good terms lately. And I bet Pansy knows exactly what papa thinks of Harry. She’s very observant.”
exactly do you think you are doing?” he snarled. It sounded more terrifying than he had sounded in about three years. Potter’s expression told him that. It also told him that Potter had seen it.
“Yes. I regret what I did. Very much. But I stand by it, as well. I will stand for my mistakes, for my crimes. I won’t deny them and I won’t act as if it never happened.”
“Good morning everyone! Settle down, please,” Potter told his class, third-year Slytherins and Gryffindors.
Laughing again, Potter shook his head and put down their now empty punch bowls. “Thanks, though. They loved it.”
Potter leaned back in his chair and sipped from his Butterbeer. “Good enough. I must say I understand, you know. George is very handsome. And funny. I sometimes think whether my relationship with Ginny was just the heterosexual projection of my attraction to Charlie, Bill or the twins. Have you
“You’re not. If you quit, one of our children will die too. I won’t let you. We know who we have to find and we have to stop them. It’s easy now.”
“But the truth is – the truth is, Grandfather didn’t kill them. I did. I killed her parents, but I told her it had been Grandfather, because I couldn’t bear telling her the truth. She was lone because of me.”
First, we see the suspect watching his children while they are animatedly talking. The memory lets us know that Ms. McGonagall is surprised by the pure adoration in Mr. Malfoy’s expression. She had never seen him smile like that before. He even threw his head back in laughter.
“Perhaps. Although it’s not exactly how Sorting works. Slytherins don’t always get Slytherin children and Gryffindors don’t always get Gryffindor children. You can’t really call a child of Slytherin-Gryffindor parents a mix of both Houses.”
Draco leant back, petting Potter’s outstretched hand, and smiled at Smiths. “Never mind. The moment has broken, unfortunately. Can George come back in?”
Draco grabbed his identification papers from his backpack, and the ones from Scorpius. Not being able to sit, he paced in front of the door until a small hand was placed on his shoulder.
Potter started to laugh, nodding. “Well, if you eat proper breakfast, you’ll get chocolate from me. Deal?”
Draco smiled faintly, sitting up to allow Potter to turn on the Wireless. “I’m not sure whether music can lift my spirits right now.”
Potter didn’t know that Draco had fled the hidden corridor when he had heard the bangs of magic against the door. He returned quickly, when Potter’s voice had disappeared and the wall clanked shut. Upon finding the note, Draco sighed. Perhaps he really should reappear. His children must be terribly worried, if Pansy had come to Hogwarts, probably at his children’s call.
“Good morning, Malfoy,” she said. Draco wondered whether she would even call him Draco, like she used to call Severus by his first name.
Potter felt Draco sigh again, while Draco’s fingers fiddled with Potter’s shirt. “I know what he said. But what if they’re wrong? Or what if he does wake up, but doesn’t recognise anything? What if he doesn’t want me around?”
Looking down, Draco saw how the Glamoured hoodie was now stained with flour. The Glamour started to flicker because of this interruption of magic, which caused a speck of red to appear from time to time in the blue of the vest he had glamoured it in.
“Look at this,” Potter pointed, indicating a Santa hat that was playing music and had reindeer antlers moving on the beat.
When Draco peeked over the rim of his glass, he saw Potter looking back at him, with the most sincere expression on his face. Draco almost reached out to calm him further down with a touch, because Potter still got this frightened look in his eyes, but he stopped himself.
Draco nodded silently while Phi and Scorpius carry on the conversation. When they entered Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes, they saw Cassie as well as Aquila with their arms full of items to buy. George was laughing and waving away their money. The moment he saw Draco, he walked up to him.
“Though in the end, it doesn’t matter whether the beach is romantic or not. I don’t even care that much. Because I can be here with you. And I can hold your hand, or kiss your cheek if I wanted to. I don’t have to worry about what my parents will think – they approve, by the way, I got an official notice – or my children, or even what your family would say. The only thing that matters is right here, right now. You and me. And I’ve never had that kind of … pause in time. That kind of peace. I only have that with you. When we are marking papers together, or when you showed me Severus’s grave, or when we talk during dinner. It doesn’t matter how many people are around us, or how noisy it is. When I’m with you, nothing matters.”
“I would. I think the children would like it. Cassie and Lills are becoming friends, and I believe James has taken a shine to Phi. It would relieve you of a lot of stress, since I could just decorate everything.”
Sighing, Draco grabbed the two bowls from where Potter pointed, and combined the ingredients. Since Potter apparently didn’t have a mixer, they had to knead the dough with their hands. Which was fine, really, because that’s the way Draco also did it.
“I think this problem will take the entire day, and Phi needs to be put to bed, and it’ll be chaotic. I could owl you later to make a new appointment,” Draco said, slowly backing away with James.
“Yeah, you said that the media saw Scorpius as a mini-you, your friends thought Aquila, and your mother was of the opinion that Ophiuchus resembled you most.”
“Today, Voldemort was beaten.” Draco gets nauseous. His eyes roam the floor until they land on the heap of bones that once held up Voldemort’s body.
Draco averted his eyes and quickly took a few sips from his Firewhiskey. He knew his hands were trembling, but hoped that Potter, in his nightmare-induced daze, wouldn’t notice.
Draco chuckled. “Yes. Scorpius has to force them into their hiding place, because they don’t want to go. And right before the full moon, they are already stronger than usual. Scorpius sometimes gets bruises of it, but he has never been seriously hurt. It’s no big deal.”
“if anyone would have told me at the beginning of this year that the next summer, I would be engaged to Draco Malfoy, and see him mucking out horse stables, I’d be sure to proclaim them for mad.”
“Nah, Harry is bothering her in the kitchen, probably trying to help but more likely ruining it. He’ll be sent away in a few moments.”
“Why are you so cold lately?” Potter complained then. Placing his fork on his plate, since Draco felt he wouldn’t be able to avoid this discussion, he took a deep breath and turned slightly to at least look Potter in the eye.
Draco shook his hand in a sort of daze. He turned to Ron with an unsure smile. Before they could greet each other, Ophiuchus – bless his innocent enthusiasm – spoke up.
Scorpius punched him half-heartedly. “I am the King, yes, and therefore you should bow to me, you peasant.” He punched Albus again when he started laughing.
“Don’t get cheeky now,” the woman said, turning around. One of the others cast a spell that made Draco’s knees buckle, but he refused to get on the ground. He also refused them the satisfaction of making a sound. Pain is an emotion, he told himself. You can switch it off and ignore it. Numbness is a gift.
They met the other professors –the younger ones, not the ancient ones Draco had had as a student- at the Three Broomsticks. Neville raised an eyebrow when he saw them walk in together. A few weeks ago, this wouldn’t have been imaginable.
Draco slightly bit his tongue to fight the words, but he knew what was coming and refused to be ashamed of it. “I prefer men,” he murmured.
“Draco, I will personally ensure that your children are aware of the situation. I will arrange something for them, so they will feel more comfortable until you are spoken free. I assume I am still allowed to stay in touch with Mr. Malfoy?” she directed at the Aurors, who nodded.
James brightened, visibly surprised that Draco was allowing him this. He smiled and thanked him softly.
“Nope. But I think he has gone to where he suspects their ‘headquarters’ is. He may think papa and Aquila are there.”
“Does anyone know where Malfoy is?” a voice asks. A voice he knows all too well. Some people make surprised noises. Potter would never make himself the centre of attention voluntarily. Luna raises her eyebrows at him.  Go on, she seems to say. He shakes his head and presses himself closer to his dark corner.
Before he could finish his sentence, Draco swished his wand aggressively and yelled the incantation with a scowl on his face. He let out a shuddering breath and kept the defensive position he had taken, until he heard Potter laugh from the other side of the classroom. Other students joined him.
Swirling around, Draco ignored the heat in his cheeks and glared at him. He didn’t quite know what to say, but knew that he
“I will wine and dine you so well, you won’t even think of rejecting me,” Potter swore happily. “And in the meantime, I will wrap those awful children of yours around my little finger, so that they will henceforth never think of me as anything but there second dad. You wait and see, Malfoy. You wait and see.”
About one and a half hour later, they were walking up the driveway to a spacious, thatched house, surrounded by purple heather and low scrubs. The wind was whipping around their hair, salty sea air on their lips. Draco noticed that Potter couldn’t stop watching him, even though they were approaching the house.
Draco nodded in thanks, letting the woman go to her other tasks. He remained standing a few metres away from the door, looking through the window, even though his view was mostly blocked by the back of the Healer.
“Ever since I raised a Ravenclaw daughter, I grew more understanding of the Ravenclaw mind. And although Luna is still the weirdest, craziest and most incomprehensible person I know, she’s a good one. Aquila exchanges letters with her on a monthly basis.”
A shocked silence followed, in which Lucius sat down on one of the chairs next to his wife, whereas Potter was still stood.
Scorpius and Phi, formerly sitting in the living room, walked in, curiosity peaked at their sisters’s cries. With a smirk, Draco handed them their clothing covers.
Draco chuckled. “That’s easy. Scorpius has always been interested in managing the estates. He used to sit by me and want to sign the papers I was working on. I usually copied those papers, so he could play pretend. Besides, he is my oldest son, so the official estates should go to him. Luckily enough, the others don’t want that responsibility. Aquila will want the care of magical creatures that we own. Cassie will take over control in France and the vineyard, and Phi wants the Apothecary. Everything has been settled already.”
you are. Your daughter is just like you. She doesn’t want anyone to know she’s hurting. Did you tell her to never give anyone the satisfaction of seeing her crumble? What a very Slytherin attitude for a Ravenclaw.”
“And you know what, Draco? Since you have had the honour of killing my darling niece Rissa… I will allow you to do the same to my traitorous niece Jackie. How do you feel about that?”
As the song ended and Draco went silent, Phi had fallen asleep and their tea had gone cold. It was getting dark out. Cassie would come up soon to say goodnight. Potter decided to pick up Phi and carry him to the bedroom, so that Draco wouldn’t have to get up. In the bedroom, Phi sleepily helped put on his pyjamas and crawled under the covers. Potter sat with him until Phi turned on his other side and his breath evened out.
“Ladies, gentlemen, settle down!” A voice booms through the chatter. All Death Eaters have gone, if they were still alive. The body of Voldemort –‘The Dark Lord!’– lies alone, in the middle of the Hall. Professor McGonagall successfully makes everyone turn towards her, to make them stop staring at his bones. “I believe it would be better to assemble outside, so I can make some announcements.” She herds the students towards the place outside, which was so lovely when covered in snow. The Sorting Hat wriggles in his hand. “Bring me to McGonagall” it hisses. Draco, who has never wanted anything to be gone from his vicinity so badly, quickly sends it to the Professor with a wand he finds lying next to him. The Sword disappears as well.
“Her mother lived in Morocco for a long time, so she learned French there. Or did you mean the flower language?” James frowned a bit. “My dad once told me what the lily flower meant. Is there really an entire language around flowers?”
“Good. I can’t imagine myself not insulting a Weasley,” Draco joked, hoping Potter would know he wasn’t serious.
“As I said, you aren’t even a Hogwarts student. It’s rare enough that anyone manages to become an Animagus while still
“Take this with you,” he said. “Twice a day. And talk to me, tomorrow. I don’t believe your story about the Whomping Willow for a second, if only for the fact that the Willow doesn’t make such a precise, thin cut.”
“And Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream from Ben & Jerry’s. Who knew you would prefer Muggle brands over Wizarding ones!”
While the conversation was flowing again, Potter noticed small movements against his thigh. He saw that Draco was moving his hand bit by bit, as if he was trying to find a more natural position for it. Draco’s hand stopped moving when it had reached the top of Potter’s thigh and Draco appeared to be lost for other option.
“Perhaps you shouldn’t have arranged a Boggart for every pair, then. Just one would have sufficed, I think.”
“I have absolutely no idea. Just do everything, and I’ll see what I use when I use it. Bill, the Snare, please.”
Draco nodded. “They’re good people. I’m sorry for the way I treated them all those years, just because my father disagreed with Arthur.”
Smiling in his glass before taking a sip, Potter looked at the wooden table between them and tapped his foot twice against Draco’s shin.
“You’ll borrow some of my clothes,” he decided then. Potter balked, but Draco silenced him with a sharp hand movement. He went to the bedroom, followed by Potter, and pulled out an acceptable outfit. He hesitated for a moment, yet chose to pick a pair of underwear as well. He stuck out his hand for Potter to take over the clothes, but it was met by loud protests.
“You ruined my hair,” Draco moaned pathetically, when Potter threw away the bag and Draco was completely covered with white.
Cassie cowered, thinking that Scorpius meant her, but when Scorp threw an arm around her shoulders and pulled her close, all the while staring fiercely at Draco, the tension in her shoulders was released a bit and she sagged against her brother.
“Hmm,” Potter hummed. “You said that Terence and Priscus were part of the strange things that happened this year. Why is that?”
“If you cut the leaves, I will prepare the cauldron and the fire. The first few times, I will do the checking spell myself, until I am sure it works correctly and without troubles. After that, I can teach you. Sounds good?” Draco explained. Theresa nodded sharply, while also paying attention to cutting the leaves in the right size.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Potter doesn’t mean to be impolite. How kind. It will be impolite, though, won’t it?” he asked. Potter shrugged in response.
Mr. Malfoy frowned. “I’m not sure. In most potions, it just goes in as it is, but I know in some of the Darker potions, the feathers are pulled off of its trunk and added separately. The trunk is only added in the very last second, and would be used as a straw to drink from.”
Potter smiled. He absently stroked Cassie’s hair and pulled Draco close for a hug, until Hermione broke them apart and they all went to the Burrow for a big, festive dinner.
“Magic,” Potter grinned. “Just a few charms and spells thrown over the telly and the area where it’s standing.” He indicated that Draco should be quiet and stared intently at the videos of people at Heathrow Airport hugging each other. All Potters whooped when the first ‘actually’ was said.
Here, to start 2018 the right way: another chapter. And it's a long chapter. It's about twice as long as a regular chapter. Enjoy! (I had no idea what I wanted to write in this chapter, so I'm sorry if it's rubbish)!
“There’s one thing I don’t understand,” Potter said after a while of silence. “Why would everyone go to Malfoy? Wouldn’t you feel safer with friends if you have a nightmare?”
“I do. But when did he start expecting those things? I’ve never seen you dance on a table or climb trees.”
Draco thought about it for a second, before putting down his glass of wine and leaning back. “It’s just… I love having a family. My children are everything to me. So I like family dinners, where everyone recounts what they’ve done that day, and then drinking tea with all of us and lazing about. Tucking the children in together and then snuggling together on the couch before going to bed ourselves. Warmth, endless cuddles without having to ask. I like that.”
“But – stand up – fight for himself – then I’ll do it,” Draco heard Scorpius’s say in a hoarse whisper.
“But I didn’t. I’m here with you, and I love you, and I will always stay with you. I will never leave you.”
“We’ll find him on the way there. The inside of this building is a labyrinth. We just have to follow the path quicker than Albus does.”
Of course Draco had celebrated Christmas with his parents, but their Christmas was a far cry from the Muggle version. They used to invite all their friends over for a roast, and exchanged presents when the guests had left.
Draco turned around to watch his son and observe his body language. He was tempted to believe Scorpius, and everything indicated that he was being honest. Strategically keeping silent, Draco was trying to manipulate Scorpius into saying something more.
I couldn't stop laughing at 'arm resting on the arm rest', but I didn't know how else to put it. I'm still giggling. Like, WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU REST YOUR ARM?! Okay, so that's my weird humour. Let me. (Also: Potter patted. Potter patted. Potter patted. I dare you to say that ten times without stuttering.)
“Do you remember sixth year?” he murmured, biting his lip. At Draco’s nod, he continued. “The bathroom incident?”
“I plead not guilty,” Draco calmly stated, looking Whithal right in the eye. From the audience, loud boos and whistles were heard.
I went to do some research. My source told me that yesterday would be a Hogsmeade weekend and Draco Malfoy would go out with his children. I decided to follow him, to see if Mr. Malfoy might be buying presents for a love-interest.
“Well, I can’t say you’re the best student I have apart from your father, because he was horrible at Potions. But you’re a good student, James. Even if I might challenge you at times.”
Seeing that Harry was at a loss for words, and seeing the grins on their children’s faces grow wicked, Draco decided to do something about it. He took Harry’s hand and pushed the silver band on his finger.
“Milk hazelnut, mostly. And there is one brand that has caramel-sea salt, and it’s incredible. What’s yours?” he asked. Draco stared at him, clenching his right hand and concealing it with his left. Potter racked his brain what it meant. Phi had said that when he fumbled with his hands, it was something that Draco had to reign in. Oh right, it was being unsettled. Draco felt unsettled.
The only problem was that Draco had testified against his father. When everyone had thought the trial was over, Draco stood up from where he sat and said: “I would like to testify.” A murmur had gone through the crowd. His father looked proudly to his son, and his mother’s brow furrowed in thought. The judge had told him he wasn’t allowed to testify in this trial, but Draco had interrupted him.
“We didn’t see eye to eye in the way we wanted to raise our children. We fought about their friends, the Houses they were supposed to be in, the primary education we wanted to send them to.”
“Someone who’s not afraid of your constant flow of insults,” Neville reworded dryly, and Draco smirked in response.
Draco and Potter didn’t get a chance to answer, because everyone started talking at once, giving Draco the opportunity to send Phi off to bed, give Cassie her good night hug, explained some insignificant detail of the workings of Patronuses to Aquila, and share a loaded look with Scorpius. Potter finished his own rituals quickly enough, and they were alone again.
Seeming to hesitate, Potter swallowed and looked around the apartment, smoothing his hands over the olive green fabric.
“No. As I said, I had fallen in love with someone else, and he told me that he wouldn’t be able to become a new father to the four of them. I thought he loved me too, and so, I left my children with Draco.”
“My father supported Riddle when he returned and motivated me to take the Mark. My mother did as she had done during the first war, until my father was sent to Azkaban. She then started to turn against Riddle and even saved Har – Potter’s life.”
“As you see, we have only been walking through the large galleries. The smaller galleries contain informal portraits, paintings of wives, daughters, children, et cetera. All in all, they are less interesting. There are some wonderful paintings of Draco’s children there. Would you like to see them?”
“I may know a bit,” Draco then admitted. He opened his mouth to elaborate, but was physically withheld, making him gape like a fish. “Okay, I’m sorry, I can’t say more than this. I wish I could, but I can’t.”
Draco was pondering this during lunch a few days after the SPEW meeting, since he wasn’t talking to Potter anymore. He was also keeping an eye on Aquila and Matias.
“That is very well, darling. Oh, I almost forgot. Is Mr. Potter still so kind? You described him very animatedly in your latest letters, as if you were back at Hogwarts and keeping a strict eye on him, only now you delivered positive comments instead of insults.”
With a wink, she walked away, leaving Potter confusedly staring at Draco, who picked up Phi without thinking much of it, and setting him on his hip, while not stilling the conversation with Albus.
“Very good, yeah, he’ll be back. See, he’ll be back in just a second. I know he will. He must be,” James muttered. Right at that moment, they heard the door open again and heavy footsteps jump down the stairs. Bill stood in front of them with an entire branch of Devil’s Snare in his hand, panting and flushed from running.
None of the Malfoys appeared in the Great Hall or anywhere else in the public hallways that day. Potter thought it would be unwise to disturb Draco that evening for a friendly drink, so he hoped Draco would be present the next morning at breakfast.
But Astoria wouldn’t do that, would she? She wasn’t evil. Draco knew she wasn’t, he had lived with her for fifteen years, for Salazar’s sake. Who else could it be?
Scorpius rolled his eyes at him but smiled at the same time. Dominique and Louis, the children of Bill and Fleur, exchanged a look.
“Perhaps. Or what about Klara, the German girl? She might be in love with a Gryffindor, you know. She’s always so quiet that I wouldn’t put it past her to actually break all stereotypes and start a family with the most stubborn, thick-headed Gryffindor she can find.”
“When the pain is gone, it means that the curse has fully settled and it will take effect soon enough. The pain isn’t what will make me suffer. I won’t be in any pain at all.”
“Cassie, love, the Yule Ball is very far away. I will make sure you’ve got your robes and Yule dress by the time it comes around. The rest of the packing isn’t very difficult, is it? Just take a good amount of clothes in which you can enjoy the out- and indoors. No, no, don’t take that gown, it’s far too beautiful. You won’t need it.
But the proudest he was of a present for Potter. He had found a silver ornamental Snitch at one of the far stands, which was decorated with small diamonds and black pearls. It had cost Draco more than he would like to admit and he wasn’t entirely sure whether Potter would like it.
“Only if they had a doctor that confirmed reasonable death of the baby, so either if the child had fallen ill soon after birth or was weak to begin with.”
“Merlin, Potter, are you trying to get me to grovel?” Draco groaned upon seeing that, and tasting that his tea was
“Astoria, I can assure you that Potter and I are not in a relationship,” he stated firmly. They let go of hands. At Draco’s words, Astoria turned sharp.
“I should probably go. Try to get these essays done tonight,” he announced sadly, gesturing to the barely shrunken pile of parchment he still had to mark.
Blaise looked at her with a chuckle, but when he saw that she was entirely serious, his eyes widened and he shook his head rapidly from side to side. “No, Pans, don’t. You’ll only land in Azkaban. That’s the least of what Draco would want.”
“No, absolutely not. He hides many emotions, especially when he thinks he shouldn’t display them. For example, he hides affection and fondness when he’s of the opinion that it would be taken the wrong way. He sometimes conceals his laughter and very often tries to suppress his reaction when he likes what he sees. Though negative emotions like sadness or hurt, yes, he conceals those most regularly.”
brother!” James swallowed when he saw the hurt on Scorp’s and Cassie’s face. “Okay, that wasn’t fair. I don’t know why I said that. But I still don’t want to go back home.”
“What we have heard now, is the testimony of someone who doesn’t like Mr. Malfoy very much. We all know that the witness’s story may not be the perfect recounting of facts. I would like to know
They had agreed to meet up with their close friends and family after the trial, since the trial was not open to the public. Also Draco’s idea. Draco looked at his children, and back at Harry. “Let’s go now. I think we could all do with some distraction and sun. It’s a hassle to drive back home and from there to the beach anyway.”
Around tea time, Draco was able to get his four children together, because they were all in the Great Hall, studying. When he told them they were going to celebrate Christmas at the Potter’s, all four of them responded with equal enthusiasm.
“Blond hair, grey eyes, tall, slender figure? Nothing at all?” Potter asked exasperatedly. His despair vanished when a look of recognition overtook the hunter’s face.
“Oh really, Malfoy? Are you such a fashionista? Tell me, how many robes do you have in your closet?” Potter asked. Draco didn’t get the time to answer, because Pansy was already chipping in.
Draco smiled at the memory. The picture itself was of him, heaving himself out of the water, with Phi doubling over in laughter and Aquila holding him back at his hips, while Draco was smiling warmly at the person behind the camera.
Scorpius fumed. He took a step forward, but Draco was able to hold him back with a quick hand on his shoulder, squeezing hard –perhaps too hard, judging by Scorpius’s wince. Draco let go, giving the men in front of him a last cool look, before he turned around and herded his children away, softly muttering, “Just go. Come on, let’s go. Come on.”
George called Draco, though, to sit somewhere so they could start exchanging presents. Draco went down to sit between Potter and George, earning a snicker from Potter and sending a glare in return. Everyone settled themselves in the living room, most children –even Victoire and Teddy- on the ground to be closest to the tree.
“Draco, I’m sure you know this lovely girl. Jackie, you know your teacher. Why don’t you say hi, Draco?”
“Malfoy. Draco. I am serious. Thank you. You saved my life. You were… you cared enough to pull the Sword.” Before Draco can sputter anything against this statement, Potter hastened to add: “Cared for the Wizarding World, I mean. For the school. Not for me.” A wry smile formed around his mouth.
“A lovers spat. Rather early in your relationship to be fighting, isn’t it?” Pansy jeered playfully.
Their family might be all right, but Draco would still have to find a way to fight the entire world and face the entire Hogwarts student body.
“Yeah, all right, I know. Come sit next to me. We still need to talk about the entire keeping secrets thing.”
Sure that his children were following him, Draco strode forward until they were out of sight from those –undoubtedly drunk- men. For a long time, Cassie clenched his hand, Phi was being carried by Draco, magic still rolling off him, and Aquila hovered as close as possible without hindering anyone’s steps. And Scorpius…
Draco’s friends hadn’t arrived yet when he got there, so when the bell rang, Draco sprang up to open the door for them.
I will respond to every comment of last week tomorrow, but right now, I will sleep. Good night :D (dream of bed bugs tonight)
“I started by saying that we have indeed been tortured by papa. Our torture consists of being spoiled with so much love and generosity, that we can’t live without. I wouldn’t know what to do if papa were to die, or land in Azkaban. We need him. Our torture also consists of knowing that we will never be able to repay him for everything he has done for us. We can’t find the words to express how much we love him. We can only show it in fighting for him. And that is what I am doing here.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “Why would you want to make it worse? And for the record, you haven’t ruined anything last Monday. You’re already forgiven for that.”
Draco smirked at Potter’s state: he had pushed his plate away and was half-lying on the table, laughing so hard that his eyes had started to tear. He was covering his face with one of his hands, while the other was flapping, as if he was trying to sign Draco to stop.
“When your children walked in, Lily just stood up and brought all her stuff over to the Slytherin table. It turns out that she and Cassie have had many conversations lately, but they wouldn’t tell me what it was about,” Potter said fondly.
Neville coughed. “My name is Neville Longbottom, I am thirty-nine years old and I am colleague and friend of Draco. I was in the same year as he was, and was Housemates with Harry Potter. We became good friends.”
“Spoil sport!” Ron called, opening his arms to catch Cassie, who had run up to him. “Afraid you can’t handle us?”
“The amount of people that could have taught her that spell. There are very few wizards who know Gaelic spells, and most of them were Death Eaters. So there is only a small pool we have to search in.”
“Well, Mr. Potter, that is the secret of the gift-giver. I’m glad you liked them. I wouldn’t want any of Draco’s friends to dislike their chocolates.”
be taken so. It happened all the time, really. Potter stayed out after curfew, he was rewarded points for bravery. Draco stayed out after curfew because his mother had a rough time at home, and Slytherin lost points for disobeying the rules.
He knew Draco was attractive. He had seen it at the start of the year, and the man hadn’t lost his looks in just a few months. And he was kind, helpful, caring, soft, funny even.
“What – no, Draco, I love it. I mean, it’s odd, but everything you do for people you love is odd. I think it’s cute. Also, stop calling me ‘Potter’, you git. There’s nothing to be embarrassed of.”
“Ophiuchus,” Draco whispered, to not scare the panther with another loud sound. His head jerked towards Draco, quick breathing slowing down when he saw his father. Draco had his eyes to the ground, head lowered, trying to be as unthreatening as possible.
Euripideia smiled but not very sincerely. “Come with me to get the prophecy. If you still want, of course. I can just get you sent away.”
“Scorpius. You know the Slytherin from the SHS isn’t a girl. Don’t you?” Draco winked. Albus did a valiant job of trying to seem disinterested and calm, but his curiosity was shown in the twitch of his nose.
After dinner, Draco slumped down on the couch. Potter sat down as well, mentioning how tired Draco looked. “You know you can just doze a bit, they don’t mind,” Potter said.
Draco made a quick decision and chose five frames with care. Without letting himself doubt, he paid for the frames and Scorpius’s presents and strode onto the streets of Hogsmeade. He really needed to work hard in order to find the right pictures. He only had a month left, and it would be close to impossible, but he needed to try.
otherwise. He would have smiled at you, or nodded in greeting. But not this. Albus, we are becoming brothers!” Scorpius stated confidently, hugging Albus close and sending a private smile at Aquila.
“And they have infected the Auror Department. If we turn them in, the evidence won’t be strong enough, or some nonsense like that.”
Blaise nodded. “He hasn’t told you, but the only reason I have a job, is because of him. He guaranteed my employer that if anything went wrong, Draco would take all the blame.”
Potter started grinning widely. “You know what? You can keep the hoodie. I’ve got more where that came from.”
Aquila turned around to her Housemate. “I doubt anyone wants to know what you have to say,” she stated.
“But listen, Mr. Malfoy, if a Slytherin and a Gryffindor hook up, don’t you think their children will be scary as hell? I mean, a mix of Ravenclaw and Slytherin would be incredibly dangerous, but Slytherin-Gryffindor? That’s terrifying. Don’t you agree?” Theresa rambled. Draco sighed in acquiescence.
Phi just waved as if to say ‘later’, and climbed on Draco’s lap. “No one is supposed to know, I guess? To make sure I’m not ratted out?”
“Then you should take some too,” Aquila offered, gesturing to Potter’s mug of tea. “To even the odds.”
“Andromeda Black will be there. Mother will want to talk to her, and I fear your presence may hinder some of it. But that’s not all. The Weasleys have lost a lot in the war. Losing a brother, a son, a friend is not something one can forget so easily.”
“Malfoy. I recognise a good material when I see one. This isn’t merely good, it’s fantastic. With these decorations, it must have cost a fortune.”
So I hit a massive writer's block. My apologies. But the new chapter is up, and look at that! We are reaching some closure here!
Papa was the best potioneer James had ever heard of. He was capable of brewing every potion he wanted. So the only reason he wouldn’t have been able to invent a counterpotion, was if he let his emotions rule his actions. If he couldn’t control his emotions anymore.
Draco shook his head, urging Greg to continue. “Right. Let’s see what the rest of us have been up to these two years. I have been addicted to drink and gambling for three years now. It may be connected to that, since you were the one that made it possible for me to pay my debts and keep my enemies at bay. Blaise has been working with Theo as a real estate agent at one of the largest offices in London. Chances are that he doesn’t have anything to do with this. Pansy doesn’t do anything, so she’s out of the picture as well. Anyone else?”
“Shut up,” Draco mumbled. Potter only laughed and joined the children in their track along the stalls.
“You idiot,” Scorpius whispered. “Don’t ever go do something alone, okay? You don’t have a double last-name for nothing.”
He stood up and walked away. Draco breathed deeply. Was he really that obvious? He had always prided himself on being subtle and capable enough in hiding his emotions, but apparently, everyone could see right through him.
The evening passed pleasantly, Draco becoming more comfortable by the minute. At a certain point, Potter had sat up slightly, pulling his legs closer and leaned his back on Draco, causing the latter to turn even more in his seat so they were almost back to chest. Draco’s arm dangled awkwardly from the back of the couch.
says that it’s someone who works there permanently, with all the gossip and rumours of Wizarding Britain. They just never see this person, as they send their articles in by owl and never personally. Is he the one that has always been writing about you?”
Potter locked eyes with Phi, who was looking at him with a curious gaze. When Potter just smiled and returned to looking at Draco, Phi snorted softly and leant back against them.
“I wouldn’t call him normal. He’s still worrying and breaking his head over this thing. And he normally isn’t as cuddly and clingy as he has been last week.”
“That’s too bad. The shop has gotten incredibly popular, so yeah, they don’t really wear hand-me-down robes anymore.”
They were done at the same time, meeting on the sofa with steaming mugs in front of them. Chewing on a piece of white chocolate, Potter seemed pensive.
“I’m a professor! I’m not going to enable my children to eat during lessons. That is against the code of honour between professors. Besides, they’re bad for you.”
“I thought, with your permission, of course, that perhaps he could attend my classes? He is very curious, and he would like listening in to all of it. He wouldn’t be making potions, naturally.”
“If I understand correctly, you have made this potion before. It’s one of the basic Healing potions, to close and heal small scrapes and bruises. The only difference is that we won’t need any enhancing ingredients, like those nasty Bustles of the original potion. Therefore, I will let you take the lead on this potion, and I will step in whenever necessary. Just tell me what you are going to do before you do it, so I can stop you if it’s wrong.”
Draco thought about whether he wanted to go down this road. The answer was yes, which he hadn’t expected.
After that, it didn’t take long before the conversation ended. Smiths guided Doctor Selaminder out to other Aurors, who took him out of the Ministry. When the door closed and the soft beep of a microphone being turned off sounded, Draco slumped in his seat. He shot up again when a shadow fell over the table.
“Is that a dig towards my clothing?” Potter faked indignantly. “You spend too much time with those Malfoys, Albie. Are you becoming blond as well?”
Draco frowned. He never saw her with friends, other than some friendly acquaintances. But she never complained, so perhaps it wasn’t a problem.
Potter’s finger halted for a split second before it continued its route, almost going unnoticed by Draco. Almost.
“So, it’s an embarrassing crush, isn’t it? Good to know,” he joked. At seeing how Draco’s hands were quickly folded together in the position that indicated nervousness, Potter smirked. This would be fun.
Lucius suppressed a groan. “If there is anyone that holds a grudge against our family, it’s the Goldsteins. Terence must have been set up to it by his father, and he pulled Priscus with him into the movement.”
Potter grinned side-ways at Draco. “Right about two hours ago, James and Albus suddenly found impressive new dress robes on their beds.”
“The stories hold bravery, determination and love, combined with the strength of family bonds. Those are the most important things in life.” He beamed at Draco. Draco smiled back, a wide and warm smile that only his children could make appear. When he chanced a glance at Potter, he wore a gobsmacked expression which he schooled quickly.
They stood like that for a couple more minutes, until George’s sobs had slowed down and he straightened up.
“When I said we were bad examples as parents, I wasn’t inviting you to tell them about everything you’ve ever done,” Draco said drily. “But I suppose this idea is as good as any. We’ll just have to convince Neville to help us, but that won’t be difficult.”
“Wizarding Twister!” he called out. “And a marble Wizarding Chess set! And even, oh look! Wizarding Monopoly!”
Potter’s smile was brilliant. “All right. We can’t really do an announcement, that’d be weird. What do you have in mind?”
“I don’t think so. I read in order of the Houses, starting with Slytherin, then Ravenclaw, and then either Gryffindor or Hufflepuff. Nothing prejudiced, just because Slytherin and Ravenclaw work is usually easier to grade. Clearer differences between good and bad.”
Resolutely turning around, Draco shakily reached for his wand to Apparate away. The only thing stopping him was the warm weight of someone’s hand around his wrist, fingers curling around the Dark Mark.
No. They weren’t going to have this conversation. Draco said so, clearly and decidedly, but Blaise rolled his eyes.
“That’s fantastic!” Neville exclaimed. Potter walked up to them, made curious because of Neville’s enthusiasm –and having just been trying to find a reason to talk to Draco.
Nodding, Phi curled into Draco’s chest a bit more, letting out an unconscious purr when Draco thread his fingers through the black hair. Draco held him closer, completely forgetting Potter’s presence.
Draco’s eyes grew. “Which can I take then?” he whispered back. Potter handed him a bag from the exact middle, flavoured apple cinnamon, and smiled.
Draco nodded. Then he looked at Aquila, who had still not resurfaced from his neck, and patted her shoulder. “Well,” he announced brightly. “How about we go home? I’m quite done with this ceiling, and this bed. And the view.”
“How do you know all this? Okay, I’ll think of something more difficult. True or false: my toothbrush is blue.”
“That last bit also counts for you,” Potter said with a sly grin, when Draco had managed to look away from the Big Ben and caught Potter’s gaze.
What is this prize? Well; you can choose one trope/scene/something you really really really want me to write, and I'll write it. So start guessing!
“Counterpotions are interesting to invent, but you’ll need a very detailed knowledge of all possible ingredients and their effects. I assume you were wondering how it worked for spells or charms, not for potions?”
Scorpius looked up at him. “Dad, I don’t think that’s something you should worry about now. For now, Aquila is happy and healthy, papa is coping well and we’re all safe. We can worry about the rest later.”
“But I don’t know what kind of memory I should use. I have so many happy memories, none of them sticks out.”
“So you think you can see when I lie and when I tell the truth?” Potter asked, with amusement dancing in his eyes.
“Then go to Manila’s house. Help her, because I’m pretty sure Albus hurt her. Maybe you can talk some sense into her.”
Draco shot a grin in Potter’s direction. “You forced me to do this in front of all these people. I should be allowed to take you down with me.”
Their companionship didn’t go unnoticed. Scorpius and Albus were whispering and gesturing frantically, until Cassie asked them what they were talking about and was enlightened. Ophiuchus, who had been sitting with his oldest sister, was sent to his Slytherin siblings to find out what was going on. He was also assigned to visit the Gryffindor table, under pretence of Albus wanting to give James a note. Phi discreetly told James and first-year Lily what the Slytherins had observed and what the implications could be. Many questioning, reassuring and plotting looks were given and returned.
“Potter!” Draco bellowed, rather uncharmingly. Potter raised an eyebrow at him, breaking off his conversation with a student, seemingly from Hufflepuff. “What do you think you are doing?”
Two can play at this game, Draco thought. He raised an imperial eyebrow at his daughter to match her glare. “If your own behaviour would be tolerable, I would not need to insult you.”
“We should head back, before Harry starts thinking we’re doing something uncouth,” George grinned. Draco just shook his head and headed inside.
Potter cackled. “Sorry, sorry. I’ll behave. I still can’t believe you’ve never seen this movie, though.”
Jackie cried. “No! Please, don’t kill me. Don’t kill me, please, no,” she rambled, alternately looking at Laurentia and Draco. Draco merely looked up to Laurentia, avoiding eye contact with Jackie, and stood up.
Pouring two glasses of water, Lucius settled himself in a bit more. “It’s about a thousand years old, I believe. I have no idea who invented it, but I know that it was used by Curse Breakers. During the 1100’s, Curse Breakers were just Aurors with some extra diplomas, and those Curse Breakers often used the spell for long-term criminals they couldn’t catch otherwise.”
He hated himself. He hated his father. He hated the Dark Lord. He hated Dumbledore. He hated Severus. He hated the Death Eaters. He hated his aunt. He hated Pansy and Blaise and Goyle and Crabbe. He hated his wand, his magic. He hated Hogwarts. He’d never thought he’d say this, but Merlin, he wished he was born a Squib. He wished he hadn’t born a wizard, or even better, hadn’t born at all.
“You don’t even refute it, do you? You agree that you should be in Azkaban? Do you think you’re disgusting as well?”
“Zarnel, right? The girl that helped you with your potions? I’m not sure. I only know that she is a half-blood with very,
“Stop right there!” Cassiopeia shrieked. She huffed a few times, like she was grappling to understand what was happening.
On your left hand you see the Tombs, which are the living (no pun intended) quarters of our Kingdom. It's very cosy, with candles that set the mood and thousands of inscriptions to read. There are also pieces of art, but some are difficult to decipher. If you need help decoding it or want to talk about the inscriptions or art, we have Inscription and Art Groups, which are groups of about five to ten people with an interest in the same inscription or piece of art.
“ – and you should never go away without informing the professors at a time like this, do you understand?”
They were staring at one another, both with hands behind their back and an unforgiving set to their jaws.
That moment, Harry stepped out of the ensuite with a towel wrapped around his waist. He stumbled when he saw Albus on the bed with rough-looking gashes over his face, but managed to strike a somewhat charming pose when Draco looked at him over his shoulder. His eyes traced Harry’s pose before raising an eyebrow and turning back to Albus.
“We prepared a little routine to officially welcome you back. We were wondering if you would like to join in?”
Scorpius shook his head. “No, I really need to make sure Albus is okay. Aquila and papa can take care of themselves, but Albus is really, really important. You know how he gets when he feels like he’s alone.”
“Hold on, dad is wearing your papa’s robes?” Albus cut in, unbelievingly. Scorpius started giggling again, which started Aquila off.
Potter still didn’t answer right away. Draco rolled his eyes at him, prompting Potter to quietly murmur ‘yes’ and looking at his feet. “I can sleep on the couch, it’s no problem at all,” he hastened to say.
When he trudged back downstairs, yawning widely, he saw Scorpius sitting on the rug in front of the fireplace, hugging a few cushions.
But Potter, noble, idiotic and annoying Gryffindor that he is, wasn’t a Dark wizard and he certainly didn’t need or want a high social status or riches and wealth. And so, our antagonism was established.
“I know, I know, it was stupid. But I think that perhaps this was the only way to make you understand I wasn’t imagining things.”
“Boys. What are you doing here?” Draco spoke, in an authoritarian voice that had Scorpius swallowing and Phi flinching. The three brothers shared a look, before they seemed to have decided that Albus would do the talking.
“Yeah, you certainly got a talent for that,” James grinned, turning back to Draco. “Anyway, suddenly, just today, I realised that you once mentioned you had tried to brew a counterpotion for something, and I thought – well, my thought process isn’t really interesting. But then I remembered that Mr. Malfoy had said something about the
Of course, from now on, he wouldn’t be stupid enough to open letters from strangers, when such news had only just come out, but still, the article in itself wasn’t extremely flattering. It hadn’t accused Draco of anything, but the suggestion that Draco was only hanging out with Potter because of some evil plan, had been there.
“Keep breathing, love. Don’t fight against it, it’s safe. Everything is all right. Try to feel the same way you felt when those men started insulting me, on the twin’s birthday.”
“Of course! How could I forget? My sincerest apologies, Golden boy, for disrespecting your position,” Draco gasped theatrically, bowing as deep as was proper for a wizard. When he saw Potter shaking with laughter, Draco even went as far as lightly taking Potter’s hand and kissing his knuckles.
“How could I? You keep reminding me. Besides, I never had an obsession. I just thought you were up to something. Which I was right about, by the way.”
Potter couldn’t and wouldn’t believe that Draco was planning something. He had seen Draco with his children; Draco would never again do something that might hurt the four younger Malfoys. He hadn’t even punished the two students who had manipulated Ophiuchus in morphing into Voldemort. He had stayed calm, ignored it, and assured Phi of his support and love.
“Please come in,” Draco said with a smile, opening the door wider to let Miguel pass. Behind him, a thin, small woman was standing.
“Oh, are we talking about obsessions, now? Really, Potter, one would think you forgot your own tendencies,” Draco shot back, raising an eyebrow.
“I can’t believe it. Did the fashionista of Slytherin House just say I, Harry ‘Distasteful Clothing’ Potter, have decent taste?” he poked. Pansy grinned in return.
Pansy sighed. “I guess I understand. You weren’t yourself, that much is clear. We need to research the potion, if you still have the letters. We can find out who was behind it, perhaps they can get a fine or something. Though we need to find Draco.”
“I present to you, Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall, exhibit A: a confession. Do you need more proof, or do you accept I was right?”
Cassie hummed. “It’s easy enough. We can get some kind of dangerous plant be put into the Department. When it starts breaking things, she’ll come out of her office.”
“I look like shit, papa. Aquila is so beautiful, and then I come along, with my stocky limbs that have no curves except for muscles. I should have been a guy, with the body I have. I was hoping it would look better if my hair was done.”
Pansy and Blaise had both stared at him. Draco had picked up a vase that had belonged to his aunt Bellatrix, and had thrown it to the wall. It shattered in pieces. Draco stepped over the mess and marched back to his room.
Wringing his hands together, Potter knitted his eyebrows to try to understand what Draco was saying.
The box of chocolates indeed contained a corner with milk hazelnut and caramel sea salt chocolates, in the shape of lions, a bolt of lightning and a bottle of Sleekeazy’s hair care products.
She leant forward in her chair and gazed at Draco with an earnest expression. When Draco turned to face her, the remnants of a soft smile visible, Cassie continued.
James ordered Mr. Malfoy to start making a base for the potion while he continued his search for ingredients.
“Is that Laurentia Fletwock?” Albus asked, as silently as he could. The scary looking woman shot her head up, searching the balcony.
“Let me tell you one thing, Arthur. He has paid enough. Let the war behind you. How can you expect the Malfoy family to move on and prove themselves, if you don’t give them a chance?”
. I shouldn’t be thinking those things. I should be happy that I can still visit him, and talk to him, and play chess with him. I
“Being a parent. Which is not necessarily a part of marriage, but I’ll count it as such anyway. I love it, even when my children are being brats and they are too noisy.”
Without needing to hear or say more, Draco nodded off, sleeping so deeply, that it made Lucius wonder how much he had been sleeping last couple of nights.
“Draco!” Theo called. “Long time no see, buddy. So, you’ve made friends with the Gryffindors, huh? Well done, mate, well done.”
“Because they said I couldn’t. They said that if I was really worthy of being alive, worthy of being at Hogwarts, if I was really allowed to roam the Earth, I should at least prove I was capable of morphing into others than just black and blond. They said I should change into him, just to demonstrate that you hadn’t raised a disgusting half-human half-monster.”
It took Draco’s breath away. On the other side of the river, the London Eye was winking at them, luring them in. The Big Ben was brightly lit and stood proudly against the night sky, and Westminster Abbey looked as stately as a church possibly could.
“Don’t you think those Slytherins deserved exactly this treatment?” Mr. Goldstein scoffed. “I’m quite proud of my son. Don’t get me wrong, I will take him away, but only because I refuse to let him stay at this school. How dare you put a Death Eater in front of vulnerable students? Make him Head of House? Don’t you remember what he has done? Don’t you know he killed Professor Dumbledore? Come on, Terence. You won’t have to stay here any longer. Everyone apparently has turned mad.”
“That means that a new reporter has taken an interest in you, and it’s not the same as always. Draco, I’m getting really worried. Are you sure it’s not Astoria?”
“Exactly. So, this person is still interested in the drama from second or third years. The only logical explanation is that this person is personally involved with either the boy or girl, let’s say because of family or friendship.”
“As I was saying, magic is susceptible to intention and emotion, because it is drawn from your core, from your genes. Therefore, when brewing a potion, you have to know what you are doing and why you are doing it; otherwise, the magic will get confused and your potion won’t work properly. Focussing during brewing will result in less unwanted side-effects, because the magic will be focussed on the main goal as well. Chatting with friends is therefore not a good idea.”
“There is. A whole lot of leverage. It just doesn’t work as well, because he is a Gryffindor and thinks everyone is his friend, if he just does the right thing.”
Just as he was about to sit down and take a bite of the deliciously sweet smelling cake, he sprang back up, wide-eyed.
curse, and I wondered if that could be this curse. So I Apparated to the Manor – which is quite a beautiful place, if I may say so – and talked to your father.”
Sighing, Draco sat up straighter and gripped Scorpius’s hand between the both of his. “All right. So these men were drunk. They insulted me.”
“Well, it’s just – I thought you could, perhaps, I don’t know, you know, you could, if you wanted to, celebrate Christmas, well, you see, it sounds weird, I know, but you could celebrate Christmas with us?”
“Can we open the presents now?” James called, before he had hit the last steps of the stairs. “Oh you made cookies!”
Potter grinned, watching the room unfold –quite literally- and all kinds of musical instruments become tangible.
“But if you go to friends and tell them your worst nightmares… You’ll feed their fears, and give them more to worry about, more bad dreams to be afraid of.”
“They are. Some people like to compare them to the Muggle stereotype of vampires. They are similarly between life and death, and their speed is unparalleled. Some wizard scientists even wanted to do research on anatomical and magical features of the thestrals and the vampire, but it isn’t allowed to do that while the subjects are alive, and dead vampires don’t really differ from dead humans. Not noticeably, anyway.”
“Malfoy. The tea is fresh and there are mugs in the kitchenette. Can you get it for yourself?” Potter greeted, making space for the five additions.
“This is starting to sound like a theory instead of knowing who it is. How did you find out, by the way?”
Groaning, Draco let his head fall forward, his hair proving to be a proper curtain to hide the tears that were collecting in his eyes.
“That’s not true. You have three very loving siblings. Six, actually, if you count the Potters. Lily loves you very much, you know. And do you have any idea what Ron and Neville have told me about you? Neville said he never was as good with plants as you are. You are a natural Herbologist! And Ron has adopted you as his own daughter. If – When I’m gone, he would steal you away from Potter and run away with you.”
“I thought so. But I still need your help. Your brewing skills to be exact. I am starting a little project, and I could use an extra pair of capable hands. Would you be willing?”
“Ah, yes. You see, your son and I have become… friends over the last months.” Potter decided to ignore the barely suppressed knowing smile on Narcissa’s lips while she pushed a plate with small cakes in Potter’s direction. She was scarily like Andromeda.
“If by ‘confused’, you mean ‘desperately hoping for anything, even if it’s just a hug or a pat on the shoulder – anything to prolong our conversation and get me some physical contact’, then you most certainly were ‘confused,” Lily supplied sarcastically. “And don’t deny it.”
Their affirmatives were lost in the sound of giggling and wild questions about how George made all his objects.
“Sure, sure,” the others gave in. “But now, all we can do, is be the best students he has ever had, so he’ll notice us,” the third winked.
But apparently, her parents were found now. And Draco could guess what would happen to them, since they didn’t have enough money to pay fines.
Draco calmly stood up and opened the door. He easily charmed the two boys up in the air, and made them float in front of him, while he walked down the stairs and through the common room.
After breakfast, there were lessons. Cassie had just had her Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson and was packing up her things, when Potter called her to stay a bit longer.
“Priscus, why don’t you tell them what you told me?” Draco asked the student, while he stood up and went to stand next to Priscus’ chair. The boy merely scowled at him.
Phi rolled his eyes. “I’m serious. All of us are much more mature than others of our age. Without you, Scorpius is constantly angry, focusses it inwards and is self-destructing. Just like you actually.”
Lucius sighed. “You are acting like a teenager. I know something is going on, and I am just asking for your side of the story. And now, if you please. Before you are dead.”
. When she turned to him with wide eyes to ask where he had gotten a signed version, he shrugged, saying that was the magic of gift-giving.
While Phi was enthusiastically nodding and showing the beanie of to the others, who had already started walking again, Draco put on an unimpressed look.
“No,” Potter stated simply. “Today is the day for honesty.” He gulped down half of his beer to escape Draco’s scrutinising gaze.
“That’s exactly why I worry. It is already not done properly. I fear something is terribly wrong. If what Whithal is saying, is correct, then you are facing one of the worst trials in the history of trials.”
, it still haunted Draco – since they had read it, but Draco knew they were going to as soon as they got home.
Draco grinned. “Trust me, they are the most capable potioneers I have ever met. Together, they can handle everything the students throw at them. Besides, I assume students respect them for taking their time to teach the classes.”
He cast a strong Sticking Charm at the note and strode out to the common hallway, replacing the portrait on his way out.
Gaping like a fish, Potter kept silent for a couple seconds, making Draco shift uncomfortably in his chair.
“Remember that Pansy told you I got letters and pictures during the war with information from my father?”
When Draco walked to his apartment, he passed the Slytherin common room, where a few sobs sounded and agitated whispers.
“Right. Just make sure you get it back, Potter. As soon as possible. George, tell Ron that she isn’t allowed to go there anymore.”
Draco fish-gaped at him, opening and closing his mouth while his face grew redder. “That is wrong on so many levels,” he uttered eventually. Potter just barked a laugh and made his way to the sofa.
“Well, you see,” James started. “Next week is Valentine’s Day. We’ve got the Valentine’s Ball here at Hogwarts, and I want to ask Suzanne as my date, but…”
Lucius immediately went to the corner of the room to grab Draco some tea, and gestured for him to start talking.
The gaggle of Weasleys preceded Potter and Draco on their way to the Great Hall, where students were already assembling for dinner.
“But Snape was killed by Voldemort, he wasn’t in Voldemort’s good graces anymore. Why would Death Eaters use his grave as headquarters?” This was James.
Draco started running, bending to pick up snow to throw at anyone who came close enough, not even seeing who he hit.
“We very often celebrate Christmas in France, or not at all. Sorry for not knowing the English names of seasonal decoration I only see once a year when I’m in France,” he sassed dryly. “Anyways, I was thinking candles,
“No, I mean… Suddenly, my Gringotts vault is much fuller than I had expected after gambling everything away.”
“Don’t be sorry, it’s over and done now. After that, I failed many more tasks that were much more important. For example, when you won from me, every Quidditch game we played, or how Hermione would always beat me with every test. I became a disappointment because I wasn’t the best, and then I turned out to be incapable of being a Death Eater. At a certain point, neither of us expected me to do what I was told. My father was greatly surprised when I was able to fix the Vanishing Cabinet.”
“All right, Draco. Your mother has been of great help with publicity and rallying of support. We appreciate her work.”
want my family to be part of yours. It already is, in a way, and that makes it so easy to fall into… whatever the two of us have. It feels as if there is nothing holding me back.”
“The third question… Whether those deaths do anything to me… You have no idea, do you…? Merlin, Severus was my mentor. I trusted him. He protected me when my parents couldn’t, because my father wasn’t in Tom’s good graces anymore. He made sure I didn’t do things even stupider than I have done. I made sure I didn’t fire that AK at the Astronomy Tower. I know it was arranged, that Severus would do it, but it helped me immensely.
Cassie now walked out of the bathroom, and sank down in front of Draco. “Do my hair,” she demanded grumpily.
“Is something wrong?” Potter mumbled sleepily. When Draco just shrugged, Potter sat up and placed his hand on Draco’s cheek. “Hey? Talk to me?”
Potter nodded sweetly, not really listening, but curiously looking at the house Draco had grown up in.
Also, there was another problem. If Draco followed Euripideia now, and she would get the notification of a dangerous object in the Entrance Chamber, he would get sent away. He wouldn’t be able to sneak a peak in her office.
Draco was asked to testify, as he was the one that could speak of it least emotionally and with the most information. He was nervous today, even though he knew nothing of the events would be blamed on him.
“Phi! You don’t say that about people!” Draco berated his son. He was becoming exasperated; Phi was never like this. Yet Potter didn’t seem to mind.
“Potter, dates are for people who don’t know whether they like each other enough to start a relationship.”
“I’m going as well. Enjoy your day,” Potter mumbled, sounding put out. Then, he frowned and tilted his head like a confused puppy.
“If you have insults, you come to me!” Scorpius snarled aggressively, twisting around to sweep his gaze over the classroom. Draco tutted softly so he would sat back down, and then cast his own glance towards the corner where the voice had come from.
“Yes, I am. With all due respect, I want you to expel them. I don’t want to see their faces in class, because I don’t know what I’ll do.”
sneaky, but it might be for the best. I don’t think you would have lasted long with me, if that book didn’t exist. Merlin, I have underestimated them. And here I was priding myself on my knowledge on them.”
“Professor Malfoy?” Jackie asked. “I think all of us would really appreciate being cheered up right now. We’re all very fond of Scorpius.”
Blaise’s eyes had widened. Then he had started laughing. “So why is it a bad thing then? He’s gay, you’re gay, everyone’s gay and happy. You actually have a shot now.”
Taking a sip from his glass of water, Draco thought about it. “Mother has been in the S.P.E.W. board for two-and-a-half years. She wasn’t entirely welcome there at first. Now the board has accepted her, and most affiliates of S.P.E.W. as well, but there might be one or two that disapprove.”
It had turned dark now, and James and Phi were starting to get hungry. At one of the stalls, Potter bought nine portions of chips, which was something the Malfoys had never eaten before. Seeing them eat something so basic, was an experience Potter wouldn’t forget very soon. Draco’s eyes widened in surprise, and after his portion was gone, he proceeded to steal chips from Potter, thinking Potter didn’t notice, until Potter just gave the left-overs to Draco.
“As far as I know, they’ve bullied every first-year Slytherin they could get. Albus was kicked until he was taken to the Hospital Wing with a concussion. However, the moment he was alone, he slipped back to the dungeons. It’s a Slytherin thing, I believe. No matter how badly they were hurt, they make sure to keep doing all their homework, keep learning for tests, keep their head held high. Other Slytherins help them with Concealing Charms to hide the bruises. Everything to show Terence and Priscus that they can’t get the Slytherins to break.”
“Yes, Mother, they are. The family name is important, the family vault and possessions, the future of my children. Even the purity of blood isn’t completely useless to me. You haven’t ruined my upbringing, at all. And Father hasn’t either,” Draco reassured her softly, offering his arm again.
Potter caught his gaze and smiled. He was surprised that Draco used Ginny’s first name, sure, but he was mostly loving what Draco was trying to do: Draco was breaking down all the walls he had thrown up to protect himself. No more last names, no more inappropriate pride, and no more unfounded opinions. Potter had noticed it before, right from the very first day, when Phi had started talking to Potter and Draco hadn’t minded, but now, Potter saw the full extent of Draco’s ambition. He was a changed man, but still the same. A remarkable feat to accomplish.
Potter bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, in order to keep himself from crying. “I understand. I really do. And trust me when I say that I feel the same fears. Perhaps a lesser version of them, but I feel them too. But I am telling you that you don’t need to worry, until the Healers say something is wrong. He will be all right. And you need to be cheered up. Are you in the mood for some music?”
Potter groaned. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to explain Christmas to someone who doesn’t know what it is?”
“I should hope so. I’ve given myself a lot of work with this assignment, so I hope those Gryffindors at least try to impress me.”
What appeared wasn’t the rattlesnake Draco had managed in second year. It wasn’t anything like a python or cobra.
The children looked at Potter and Draco, who were canoodling and laughing softly together like newlyweds on their honeymoon.
Neville turned around. “What do I know? No, indeed, you never fancied someone, I’m quite sure. Why are you guys talking about this?”
“Gross. No thanks. Dad can eat all he wants, and you can indulge him in such a disgusting habit, but I won’t encourage it.”
Perhaps he should stop calling them that. It wasn’t fair. And remarkably unnecessary, now Voldemort was dead –dead!– and his father wouldn’t accept him into his house anymore. Strangely, relief washed over him, instead of sadness. He wouldn’t have to see his father again. He can be himself.
Neville kept silent, probably to spare Draco the humiliation of more babbling. A full minute passed between them, trying not to get eye contact, Draco sipping from a summoned glass of water, having poured the Butterbeer in the sink.
However, I am on a week-long holiday in Italy, so you have to imagine that I am on a holiday and I brought my laptop with me *just* so I could bring you your chapter. I hope I am forgiven now.
“Hufflepuffs tend to know many things about plants and their workings. And since potions practically always need plants to work, an extensive knowledge on plants can be very useful. With that, many potions can be engineered and created, without being a Potion Master itself. Use your strength, Hufflepuffs. Use those green fingers of yours to understand the ingredients of the potion!
Potter stared at the cupboards. They were regular cupboards, with regular kitchen appliances in them. There were stacks of plates and bowls and mugs and glasses, drawers full of neatly organised cutlery. The three types named in the book of the children were all there, even though Draco must have known he wouldn’t be eating anywhere but the Great Hall.
Draco took a deep breath, not daring to look Potter in the eye. His hand slowly wrapped itself around his left wrist, around the Mark and he sagged, closing his eyes and letting his mouth speak without having his brain filter it.
Potter blinked a few times and rearranged his legs so they were tucked under him. “And you?” he asked. “What are your nightmares like? Do you still dream of the Fiendfyre? I’m not trying to make you feel guilty, but do the deaths of –of Lupin, Dumbledore, Fred, Lavender or Snape mean anything to you?”
“Thank you. Tomorrow, I’m going to teach the third years the Riddikulus spell. I need an extra pair of hands, in case a Boggart goes wrong and I’m helping another student.”
Chapter no. 14 is the beginning of the end, before the end ends and the beginning can begin, so it can be the beginning of the end.
“We can do it. Obviously. You’ll be surprised,” James said proudly, tilting his chin up a bit. Draco suppressed a smile at that, and just morphed his face into something equally taunting, but equally subtle.
Hermione turned to them when Narcissa called her name, but her smile visibly faltered when she saw Draco.
“Oh, of course! Mr. Potter, I said that papa taught us French, because it’s the most elegant language, and because my grandmother lives in France and because it’s the language in which papa can express himself best. Is there a language other than English that you speak?”
He saw Draco’s eyes widen in something like regret, and quickly added, “I wouldn’t be able to stand your smugness when you find out you are right about this.”
“Concerning the charges against you, about mistreatment and abuse of your children, what do you plead?”
“You didn’t do it on purpose? Well, you were moving with your hands a lot and playing a bit with your fingers. Like a nervous teenage girl.”
“Right you are. Let’s get the children back, yeah? They must be worried by now,” Narcissa said. “Or if Draco has anything else to tell us?”
awkward part.” Draco sat back down on the sofa, indicating that Potter do the same. “I saw it lying around –“ A grin spread on his face. “Pardon me,
Frowning, Pansy looked around the room for any confirmation of Draco’s feelings towards Potter. She understood what he meant, and even though she knew the children had given Potter hints on how to deal with Draco, it wasn’t a surprise that Potter didn’t know how to read the tiny little signs of affection.
If he concentrated, he felt the heavy presence of another person in his head. It had always been there, he knew now, but only recently had he understood what it was and how he could use it. There was a barely present thrumming of panic in that part of his brain, underneath a layer of forced calm breathing and running through known lists. Draco had the feeling that Cassie was constantly repeating his instructions in order to keep a clear head.
“Yes, we did, but Grandmère had S.P.E.W. meeting and Grandfather didn’t want to visit Hogwarts without it being absolutely necessary,” Cassie answered for her brother. “But Grandfather agreed to a Firecall, so if papa could do his little magic wiggle to the fireplace…?”
Draco was just sitting down in the Great Hall, when his children pushed through the crowd to get to him. Phi jumped on his lap and quickly morphed into his Malfoy self, and the other three leaned against the table. Behind Scorpius, Draco saw a familiar black-haired mob.
“Well,” Potter shrugged. “I used to be an Auror, didn’t I? We had to solve cases with much less clues.”
“Yes. I insulted you, and she defended you. She mentioned the scars then, yes. I’m sorry about those, you know. I really regret it.”
Whithal turned to the Wizengamot and shrugged. “If he doesn’t remember such a serious offense, it can only mean two things. Either, he is lying, and we cannot trust a thing he says, or he has partaken in so many criminal acts, that he doesn’t feel this occasion was anything special. Both do not speak in his favour.”
“They’re always about the same things. The war, the people who’ve died, the blood that’s spilled. There isn’t much variation. But I guess that’s for the best, otherwise I’d really have some horrible nights. Tonight was bad enough. I think it’s because I’m back at Hogwarts, you know. All the sights and views that come back. There are places where I refuse to go, because I already know I won’t be able to stand it. I don’t even know why I’m here, in your room. I thought the dungeons would be one place where I couldn’t go. But I woke up, and without really realising it, I was knocking on your door. Sorry for that, by the way.”
“Don’t get me wrong,” Scorpius took over. “You look dashing in those robes, but is today a special day?”
“Yes. The version my barrister has says that you get joint custody with my parents, but if I had died under these circumstances, I thought it might not have been wise to involve my parents in this. Then my death would be an attack on the Malfoy family, and my children wouldn’t be safe with them. But you see the last paragraph?”
“May I say something?” Mr. Malfoy said. “Asphodel can be countered with a peacock feather, which I always have in my pocket. Here you go. How did you learn all that, by the way?”
Draco punched Harry in the arm. “Kindly shut your gob. You’re encouraging them to be far too curious for their own good.”
Luna giggled, stood up and did an odd dance. Seamus called something about this being boring, after which the questions and dares got more personal.
It didn’t take long to come back home and put the children to bed. Downstairs, Potter was sat on the sofa and looked thoughtfully at his hands.
“Hi papa,” Cassie smiled. Draco quickly pushed down his disappointment and smiled back. “Remember how I told you about that boy in Hogsmeade?”
“Now, send a message to Auror Whithal that he should come down here immediately. Auror Septimius may accompany him, of course, as it is their shared case.”
“Thank Merlin, you are ready. Can you do something with Phi for a second? I am just packing the girls’ trunks, and then we can go. Phi’s trunk is also packed, it is in his room.” Scorpius just nodded, picked up his little brother and moved towards the playroom.
Smiths slowly turned red, eyes widening and fish-mouthing dumbly. Then he cast his eyes downward and mumbled, “A suspect was uninformed of the case, with resulted in being sentenced to the Dementor’s Kiss. However, a week after the sentence was fulfilled, there was undeniable proof that the suspect had been innocent.”
They flew for an hour, after which their hands were cold and they returned to Hagrid’s for another mug of hot, brown, sluggish something.
“You shouldn’t worry about all that, though. I’m sure Headmistress McGonagall has it all figured out.”
Pansy, Blaise and Greg looked at one another from the corner of their eyes, uncomfortable with their knowledge. Did Harry truly not know? He couldn’t, otherwise he wouldn’t say this to their children.
Potter barked out a laugh. “I haven’t learned much of my aunt and uncle, but I do know that it’s polite to carry your guest’s things. Besides, aren’t you used to thousands of elves following your every command?”
“Sir, if I may…” Smiths started hesitantly. “You know that I cannot leave you alone, but I can promise that nothing said in this room will be repeated to others. This is not to do with the case, which means Aurors Whithal and Septimius don’t have the right to know.”
“We’re going to ask you some questions and you’re going to answer them. Do you remember the deal? Repeat it for me.”
“That’s all right, Mr. Longbottom. You said you were a colleague and friend of Mr. Malfoy. But we know from his trials in ’98 that he hasn’t always been your friend. Could you explain?”
A particularly strong hit in Draco’s stomach made him double over, but it was the unexpectedness rather than anything else that made Draco huff loudly.
Glad that he is standing in a corner, he lets his eyes roam the crowd. One pair of eyes catches his, and they hold each other’s gaze. Luna smiles at him. Perhaps she does want him there. Perhaps she does want to include him. He reluctantly smiles back at her.
He had put his parents in enough danger as it was. Four people knew he hadn’t been able to kill Dumbledore. Severus claimed Draco had done his job, but the other three stayed silent. Draco could be the very reason his mother would be tortured. Because Draco wasn’t strong enough. Draco couldn’t kill a man. Draco hasn’t obeyed an order.
“We talked about this, a few months ago. I don’t know whether you will appreciate it, but I thought you should at least have gotten the chance to see it. Don’t… don’t get angry.”
“How are your nightmares, by the way, Harry? Are they still as bad?” Pansy then asked, suddenly serious. Potter blinked at her change in tone, but shrugged when Draco sent him a concerned glance.
Fourth, he sees Potter’s hand. Trembling. Holding a wand; brother of the one who killed his parents.
When they turned around, they saw Cassie standing there. Before they could ask how she got there, she shrugged and smiled. “Apparition isn’t that hard. But Scorp’s right, you should go back, James.”
“It’s all right, I suppose. Nothing special. Though, we use different instructions for brewing potions than the years before.”
“Good. That’s all I need to hear.” He smiled at the Healer and walked into the room, not hesitating to sit down on the bed and giving Draco a kiss on the temple. “Hi, Malfoy. I hear you’ve been troubling the Healers. Why can’t you give everyone some rest, even when you are in the hospital, huh?”
“Please, Potter. If there is anyone that could trigger a gay awakening, it wouldn’t have been Vince.”
“You were saying mean things about me. I do not tolerate such insulting behaviour,” she added with a haughty glare. Her accent had been a spot on imitation of Draco’s. Ron was doubling over with laughter.
And Draco… Draco was sure of himself, and that made him realise he was even more of a disappointment. He was not only unable to obey the Dark Lord, but he would also be unable to produce a Malfoy heir. He could not and would not ever touch a woman voluntarily. He knew it. It just didn’t feel right for him.
“I think that’s just how you feel, though. It must be solved now. The Ministry has made a proper example of what happens to people who attack innocent wizards.”
“Godric’s arse, Malfoy! You’ve given me this angry lecture about not letting someone’s childhood character influence your view on their adult being. I’ve grown up, yes, just like you. Is that so hard to believe? Why would you think I haven’t changed a thing since I was sixteen and angry? How –“ he ranted.
And now, a gay Potter was trying to talk to him. Probably trying to find out more about the box. Draco felt the need to drink and drink, but he knew it wasn’t a good idea. So he kept it at one glass of champagne and only Cokes for the rest of the evening.
“You don’t touch anything. You don’t break anything. You don’t buy anything without mine of Malfoy’s permission. You don’t walk away without us knowing where you are. Try to stay together as much as possible, but make sure you are at least in pairs.”
“Draco, Ms. Granger and I are on polite terms now, so I would like you to be kind to her. Of course, she is Mr. Potter’s best friend, so I expect you’ll be nice if only for his sake. I was very glad to hear from Cassie that you were getting close. It’s good that you are making friends. Oh look, here we are.”
, and they have accepted it. It will be published in tomorrow’s edition, on the gossip pages. We will be right next to another article from
“I –“ James began, but quieted at Draco’s quelling look. “Okay. Yes. I’ll be honest. Merlin, you’re terrifying. Can we sit somewhere to talk?”
Draco meant to answer, but was interrupted by a heavy coughing fit, after which a Healer came rushing in to check his vitals, offer him a drink and help him control his breathing. Cassie stared wide-eyed at the Healer, until she left them again, assured by Draco that he was fine.
“Yes, it does, but mandrake’s leafs are rather rare, and it is very uncommon to keep such a thing in one’s mouth for a month. Let alone coincidentally during a full moon.”
After Lily had calmed down somewhat, she smiled at him, slanting a look at Draco. “How are they? How is Scorp?”
“Long story short, we’re experimenting with adapted ingredients. Right now, we’re brewing Amortentia.”
Draco straightened his back and turned around slowly, seeing a wide-eyed look on Phi’s face and Scorpius clenching his fists tightly.
“I know for a fact that Suzanne knows the answer to this question. You came to me to discuss this last week, remember? Care to explain?” he asked the Gryffindor next to James, who couldn’t stop smiling, while staring at his girlfriend.
do it. Later that day, I went back to my room and found a note on my pillow. It was from Amycus. Rissa hadn’t tried to kill herself by diving into the Great Lake. She had been pushed by Alecto, because Rissa had said that her parents hadn’t deserved to die and she was going to survive for her parents’s sake.”
when you were in the hospital, about second chances and forgiving and whatnot. But she’s vulnerable. Her parents are awaiting sentence, and we can easily get them killed. Or a Kiss, who knows? So many possibilities. And Jackie, oh Jackie. If
Pansy huffed out a fond laugh. “Yes, Harry, he really does. You are the embodiment of his ideal partner.”
Scorpius snorted. “We’ve been calling him Harry since the beginning of this school year. It’s weird to call him Professor when I’m talking to his children of his cousins.”
“But papa would also know that I am manipulating him, because he always knows, somehow. Trust me. It’s the ice cream.”
“You could never see Slytherins as anything but monsters,” Draco breathed hatefully. He threw a wordless curse on Potter’s left arm, which was powerful enough to crash through Potter’s shield and hit him right below the elbow. Potter jerked back, gripping his arm, hissing from pain.
Scorpius touched Phi’s back in a subtle warning, and steered the conversation away from Potter. Draco sometimes fears the perceptiveness of his children. Had he been the same, when he was younger? If he had had siblings, would they have been just as subtle and clever when it came to body language and non-verbal communication?
It continued like this until Albus groaned loudly, hitting his head against the table once. “Will you
So, Potter moved a bit closer. His thumb and pointer finger hovered over Draco’s ring finger and pinkie at Potter’s inhale, and faintly stroked over them at his exhale. With lightning speed, Draco removed his hand and placed it on Potter’s thigh again, where it was so distinctly uncomfortable that Draco’s entire chest tensed with keeping it there against gravity.
“I’m not a Gryffindor and I never will be. I don’t just live a little. I think about what I do, before I do it.”
When they saw Laurentia, Alissa and the two guards on the ground, incapacitated, and the others unharmed, they relaxed their stances.
“NO!” Neville shrieked, which made Draco smirk. “Harry’s told me too much about that already. I meant how you find out you’re gay.”
“Auror Smiths,” Potter called behind him, to the Auror guard. The Auror nodded to show he was listening. “Who are the Aurors on this case?”
Pansy started laughing. “The two of you could never do things like normal people. You got approval within a week? Lucius
“Ah, but that doesn’t mean I can’t think another House is better. The House System shouldn’t be as strict as it is,” she tutted, waving at Draco and Potter.
When the three of them, Ophiuchus wearing blonde hair and pointy features, left the shop, Draco heard Potter say, “They were meeting in an hour. He’s lying. He refuses to talk to me.”
It was almost one o’clock when Draco heard a rushed knock on his door. He thought it was Cassie, who had a history of really bad nightmares. When he opened the door, however, he was in for something rather unexpected.
“Thanks. If you really want to know, I have nightmares quite regularly. And they aren’t pretty. So you can back out now. Once I’ve started, I won’t stop.”
Potter looked at his hands, making an effort not to fiddle. “You have heard of Scorpius being admitted to the hospital, I think. And during the weeks he was unconscious, I was so worried, but I felt I couldn’t do anything. I don’t want to feel like that, especially not when it concerns Malfoy and his children. If I am at least allowed to call myself part of this family, it would help immensely. It made me realise how much I want to be one of them.” He turned his gaze to Lucius, with a fiery challenge in his eyes. “And I’m willing to fight for my place. The only reason I am asking approval is because Malfoy appreciates it. But I can lie about it, and you won’t have the heart to deny it. Will you?”
Pansy lets go, shoots a look at Potter and steps backwards. After one more smile, she returns to the Slytherins. Perhaps she doesn’t hate him.
“Exactly! However, I have noticed that Tania is the worst. If you get her to be quiet, the rest is easy.”
He didn’t need to elaborate, since the nurse had signalled another nurse with hospital bed at first glance. Scorpius was taken over and placed on the bed, while they were already moving it towards a certain floor, a certain hallway, a certain room. Draco followed stupidly.
“But what if people would like to know what I have to say?” he persisted. “Are you going to detract points for that as well?”
Draco feels his cheeks heat and looks at his feet. ‘Well, not so much caring about you, as being stupidly in love with you.’
From several spaces in the building, they heard Aurors call ‘safe!’ and ‘clear!’ to signal that there were no threats hiding in any of the rooms. Finally the voices closed in, until three red-robed Aurors ran into the room, ready for battle.
Before Draco could say anything else, he was ushered out by five children. The moment he stepped out, Aquila hurtled a snow ball in his face. Albus threw Scorpius down and was rubbing snow in his face. Phi was still seated on Draco’s back and hindered Draco when he was trying to dodge the snow balls flying his way. At a certain point, Albus spotted Lily and James and included them in the fight. James tackled Aquila to stuff her hoodie with snow. Draco was the constant victim of Phi, Cassie and Lily, until Draco caught Lily alone and convinced her to choose his side.
“No, because Scorpius still knows what is the right way to achieve what he wants. Cassiopeia is the most impulsive one of them all.”
“Hey!” Cassie yelled indignantly. She crawled under table towards Draco and jumped on his lap. “That’s not nice, papa.”
he drinks it. Therefore, we have to work with witness testimonies only. Thank you, Ms. Zarnel, for your presence. Doctor Selaminder? Anything to add?”
Shaking his head, Draco looked at Potter for support, but he raised a challenging eyebrow. “Scared, baby cakes?”
“Draco, dear, how lovely to see you again,” another woman said, followed by three men and two other women. “Have you missed me?”
“It isn’t your fault,” Cassie whispered. Draco didn’t see her, as he had his eyes clenched shut in an effort to stop himself from crying, but he felt her soft finger trail over his nose and along his eyebrows.
Draco walked into his office to see someone sitting in his chair. He knew who it was before he saw him.
“It sounded really weird, not like any other curse. Some kind of garbled language. It sounded a bit like Welsh, but not really.”
“Thanks,” Potter responded dryly. “She said she liked it. She also said she liked the Potions professor, so I’m not completely sure whether she actually is my child.”
“Good afternoon, boys. Let’s have a talk,” Draco said, letting his voice drop to a dangerous undertone and locking the door behind him.
And after those classes… Oh Merlin, Draco had promised McGonagall to have a little duelling demonstration, as an attractive sort of thing to motivate students in their studying.
“No bed-sharing before marriage!” James called, moving into his bedroom to unpack. “Also, as if we could forget. You two have been making googly eyes at each other ever since you proposed.”
“But if she is helping her parents assault papa, should you even want to be with her?” Lily questioned. “I thought Slytherins cared for their family.”
“Well, it does heal scars. Not all of them, though; one has to apply the potion within 48 hours after the thick crust having loosened. Especially combined with dittany, it works incredibly. Well done, James. You have successfully made your own potion. Theresa, if you would add the last ingredients and stir twenty times clockwise, please.”
With a sigh, Draco scribbled something on a scrap of paper. Waving his wand, the paper folded itself into an origami bird and flew out of the classroom.
Draco took a sip from his drink and sighed. “Here’s the deal. I don’t have a problem with killing someone for my children, because that would mean that my children have suffered at someone’s hand, and I would gladly stop that. I would also die for them, if that meant protecting them just a moment longer. I think this is simple. A Kiss, however, is worse than death, because my children won’t be able to have a proper goodbye. They will forever know that I am suffering, while I won’t remember them, and I will have become inhumane. It would hurt my children to see me like that, brainless and completely out of it.”
“Do you want more tea?” Potter offered softly. He picked up the two mugs and went to the kitchenette to prepare fresh tea. While he was gone, Draco managed to finish one essay on the effect of stirring clockwise instead of anti-clockwise, but didn’t get much further.
“Harry, my man! Long time no see! Tell us everything that’s happened, we’re curious!” he yelled, as he wrapped Potter in a big hug. Potter, to his credit, didn’t even hesitate before returning the sentiment with a grin and uttered some sincere-sounding words of interest as well.
When he looked in front of him, he saw tall hedges in various colours. They seemed to be arranged in a particular and very deliberate way.
Potter grinned. “Come on, what are you so ashamed of? I, personally, find it a very refreshing side of you.”
“I suppose we are. We are going to study together this afternoon as well, and probably partner up tomorrow in Transfiguration.”
“I didn’t know before yesterday evening. If I had known before, say, in their first year, I would have called you here for a warning and a good talk. But I fear that their behaviour has crossed a line. I cannot do anything except expel them. Nothing else comes close to a fair punishment. They ought to appreciate the fact that I refuse to lay charges on them.”
“Why don’t you take a seat, Mr. Potter,” Narcissa offered, as if reading Potter’s mind. “We can talk about this. I say, it is a bit unexpected. When did you initiate the courtship?”
Potter’s face creased in thought. “Should I tell them to try and stay away from the children until the trials are over?”
Leaning a tad more weight on Draco’s shoulder, Potter got his attention and sent him a questioning glance. Draco shrugged, letting his eyes stray back to Pansy, to make sure she wouldn’t do anything too embarrassing.
Potter laughed. “I get that a lot. I always say, practice makes perfect. Do you want some more water?”
“Harry, Harry listen to me open your bloody eyes. Do you hear me Potter?” he grunted as he continued to run through the hallways. “Somebody please help me please!” he shouted, hoping he could get somebody's attention. The hospital wing was close, he was almost there, he knew he could make it. But he didn't know if Potter could make it.
Draco died nearly three hours later. Three hours of Madam Pomfrey working over him. Three hours of held breaths and pacing. Three hours of Severus Snape yelling at Albus Dumbledore, throwing the freshly brewed Veritaserum at his head. Three hours after Harry Potter woke up.
He was mistaken to call it a classroom, it was mostly empty, no desks or blackboards, no books. It must be a room used for storage, he thought, there were a few objects hidden under white sheets. But other than that it was empty. Curiosity had always been one of Draco's weak points as he walked over to the first of the objects covered in cloth. He moved the sheet off and the trunk beneath it shook violently causing Draco's stomach to lurch. There was only one thing Draco knew that could do that and it was the one thing he never quite had to handle. He pulled the sheet back over the shaking trunk and moved onto the next covered object.
The seat remained empty and the Dark Lord continued talking, or rather, some take on hissing. It was a dreadful sound. It’s what Draco would imagine a snake would sound like trying to speak English. It slithered down his spine and sent a chill into the pit of his stomach.
He could see clearly that this wasn’t some one-time thing. Harry Potter was afraid. He was seeing it again.
“Draco. I shouldn’t be here” She started. Her voice broke in a way Draco had never heard from her before. “And neither should you.” Draco couldn’t understand what she was trying to say but he could see the conflict in her eyes. Something was wrong.
chapter seventeen? already? im posting this in a hurry as i am tired and so is my baby and i don't know when ill have free to post. i hope you like it please let me know what you think.
“You tell me” His voice was ragged and the hallway was spinning around Harry who was shaking his head.
He wasn’t sure what he expected, but it certainly wasn’t this. He was expected to kill. On some level, Draco always knew that was a possibility in his future. But not one he’d have to face so soon.
But it wasn’t his mother's voice anymore. He blinked his eyes open, unsure when he closed them, and Harry was still there looking at him. Holding a hand out to him. He was right back in First year, holding out his own hand. Only he didn’t push Harry's hand away, he took it gently and let himself be pulled up grunting and wincing all the way.
They were talking about Harry Potter. They were about to make an attack. Draco tuned back out, he didn’t want to listen.
“Who are we keeping safe?” He asked as casually as he could manage, though he knew good and well who they were talking about. Mr. Weasly was standing talking to Ron, Hermione and Ginny, looking all too serious on the couch. They all looked up at him, various expressions of embarrassment played on each of their faces.
“Nightmare or scar?” He asked. Harry wished people would give Ron more credit. He really was a lot smarter than anyone knew. Anyone but him of course.
“Not possible I'm afraid, though I can fix you up real quick while the other doctors do some more tests on Mister Potter, come on up on the bed you go.” she motioned to a bed just behind him and he nodded and let himself be led over to it. He cast a quick glance at Ron and Hermione who looked about at white as ghosts and it occurred to him they haven't been allowed here yet. They must not have known how serious it was. He sighed and let the mediwitch examine him. He bit his lip when she healed his broken nose rather than allowing himself to cry out in pain. Even if he wasn't a Malfoy he was still a Slytherin and Slytherins did not show that kind of weakness.
“He can’t go back either, look at him! If anyone needs to see Madam Pomfrey it’s him” He was standing now, in the span of a blink. His side burned but he didn't let it stop him.
Slowly he got up from his swing, the chains whines at him when he moved but he ignored the noise taking a step forward, looking at the deserted scene. Waiting for something to jump out at him.
“I had never thought I would have to fight for a girl’s attention with a professor,” a guy said mournfully to his friend. The latter laughed loudly.
“Let’s go home. We have a long night ahead of us,” Harry mumbled. The trip home was silent, loaded with emotion and fear. At the Malfoy Lodge, the house smelled warm and homey, with tea steaming on the table.
“About that…” James started. “There is something going on. The Malfoys have been acting oddly, as if they’re planning something. They won’t tell us, not even Albus knows.”
Draco clenched his fist again and practically felt himself fuming. He knew it wasn’t just because Potter was being Potter. It was because Draco had no idea what Potter wanted from him. It was because Potter saw how easily Draco was taken in by his children, and how much he loved them. It was because Potter made him nervous.
“Oh. I know they have been bullying Slytherins for three years, but I just feel like it reached an extreme this year. Scorp said that the way it
While the children ran towards the river to look at the London Eye and the moving water, Potter and Draco remained standing where they were.
Potter chuckled. “Yes, they are. Every child with Weasley blood gets into Gryffindor. It’s a law of nature.”
“Yeah I found it the night Harry tried to,” he broke off clearing his throat. “The night Harry almost died. I didn’t notice anything wrong with it that night but I wasn't really close enough to it to tell.” Draco wasn't to keen on mentioning the fact that he had spent almost that entire night sobbing into his knees. “But when I found it again, this morning, I saw it closer and could see the broken piece I found, fit perfectly.” Draco was staring at his hands, trying to force them to be still.
Someone was here then. They had to be. Was he In danger? Was someone watching him. Or perhaps some small child was an unknown witch or wizard just waiting for their Hogwarts letter. But there were no children here. Option one seemed far more likey then.
“Mister Malfoy, if you could kindly explain what it is that happened?” Draco looked up slowly to meet the headmaster's eyes. He could practically feel the ginger boy glaring at him and in his head, he pictured him as Potter’s guard dog, the thought caused his lips to twitch up in an almost smile.

Greg would get a ticket for a rehabilitation centre, which Draco knew he wanted, but couldn’t get the money for himself.
“How should I know?” James wondered miserably. “Perhaps she just wants to go with friends. I have only been on two dates with her!”
“A few hundred years back, Hogwarts was much bigger. Beauxbatons and Durmstrang didn’t exist yet, except as private schools with only thirty to fifty students. Hogwarts was the biggest Wizarding school in Europe, and even many Asiatic and African students came here. Every House had not only a Head of House, but also a deputy Head, a secretary and a small board. This room used to be the meeting room for the entire leading fraction of the House. The only meeting room that is still present in Hogwarts nowadays, is the Slytherin one.”
After dinner, Draco disappeared to his apartment to read up on some essays, before he went over to Potter’s. They shared some tea, then some Firewhiskey and then some wine. All in all, it was immensely homey.
After breakfast, he moved to the library to read The Daily Prophet. It was… interesting. For the first time in approximately fifteen years, there was nothing written about him or his family. There was no article saying he was a disgrace to wizardry, or the new Malfoy Lodge was too grand for a Death Eater, or about the new job he would start today and which had created quite the ruckus, or about his divorce with Astoria. There wasn’t even anything about his children being suspiciously private at school.
Jackie’s parents had been Death Eaters. They had taken the Mark, but had never done anything more than that. Bellatrix had threatened them a few times, in hopes they would join the torturing and murdering, but it never worked.
His time on the stand was easier than he had expected. The entire trial went by much faster and much smoother than he had feared. After only four hours, including breaks, they stood outside, and all known members of the movement were judged and imprisoned.
“Everyone likes an athletic and spiky guy once in a while. Everyone with a decent taste, that is,” she said wisely. Potter looked relieved to find that they weren’t pushing him to describe someone, and that it was all in good fun.
, and I couldn’t even be that! I am nothing and worth nothing. And now that Potter has come out, I have to face all that, instead of just telling myself I had no chance because he was
Potter raised an eyebrow at Lucius’s obvious attempt at being more than polite, and nodded gratefully.
“Loo – Lovegood, would you care to tell us? We would really like to know” she says softly. Pansy is being polite, apart from her little slip of the tongue. She nods curtly at Potter, before laying her eyes on Luna once more. Professor McGonagall and the Sorting Hat are heading towards the doors, seemingly to give the students some time to reacquaint. Draco quickly moves, still in the shadows of the Castle, to stay unseen.
“Frankly, I do have an idea. That’s why I even defended you at your trial. Remember that, Malfoy? How I told them to let you go without a punishment?”
“And whenever you need me to do it for this project, of course,” Phi quipped. Scorpius nodded gravely. “And whenever we need it.”
“That depends on what you are talking about,” Pansy answered with an elegant twirl of her wand, seeming immensely pleased with herself.
“I very well do not. Give it up, Draco, you won’t see your children again.” Laurentia held her wand more firmly and prepared to send a curse Draco’s way, but again an owl hooted and the wand snapped to Draco’s hand, who looked at it with surprise and – fear. Immediately, he dropped the wand to the ground, and again when it flew back into his hand.
The first sounds after the transformation hit the black panther’s ears with a violence that made him gnarl, snapping his paws against the air. He tried to move away from whatever he was hearing, but the movement of his nails against the stone floor made him flinch the other way.
Draco immediately felt guilty. Unnecessary, really, because he didn’t even know this Harry Potter. He shouldn’t feel guilty about thinking such a thing. They did seem vulnerable. But it was still sad that someone would have to lose his parents. Harry Potter wasn’t forgotten in the Wizarding World, but no one knew where he lived or what he looked like. The boy had not only lost his parents, but simultaneously lost his Wizarding life.
They shouldn’t be flirting. They were sitting at the High Table in the Great Hall, with all students of every house looking at them and every teacher judging them. This shouldn’t be so easy to fall into. Potter shouldn’t be so easy to get used to. Especially keeping their shared history in mind. It shouldn’t be this good.
Pansy smiled. “Because I need company. That’s why I fetched you. How are you and Draco?” She seated herself on the sofa while Potter set about making tea.
“No, tomorrow is another weekday. You’ll be grumpy in the morning. Go to your room, I’ll come say goodnight in a minute, yes?”
The moment he held her in his arms, she broke down. Not even after the trials had it been this bad, even though then, she had passed out from sleep. She crumbled to the floor, crying and tugging at his arms, begging him to never leave her again. Lucius herded the others out of the room, passing them in the doorway, and closing the door behind him.
Draco also saw a couple of Slytherins -mostly first years- sneer and glare at him. He felt a stab in his chest.
“No, that’s not true. I think they like you well enough. James thinks you’re a great professor, if sometimes a bit too sarcastic for his taste. Most of all, he’s happy Higgins is gone.”
Laurentia waved an annoyed hand, sending a Stinging Hex to Jackie’s arms. “Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. You are boring me. I was hoping for some dramatic reveal, but you ruin all my plans. I’m so tired of you.”
Albus laughed and touched the material. “It’s so soft! What, is it wool from sheep that bathed in champagne and ate caviar?”
“What do you want to do? He’s going to die anyway,” Blaise said crassly. Then he slumped his shoulders and mumbled an apology.
With a sigh, Cassie stood up and gestured at her dress. “I would think it’s pretty obvious what is wrong.”
“The magical bubble around this plant isn’t quite correct yet, but I don’t know how to change it. Higher and lower both don’t work. It’s difficult,” Neville explained at Draco’s look. Then he cleared his throat.
Draco chuckled wetly. “The same way as you are. Lift your head up, straighten your shoulders and pretend everything is fine.”
,” Laurentia snapped, charging at him. From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Cassie making a hooting noise after which Laurentia slipped and fell.
“Draco, I need you to be honest. Are you in love with me, and since when, and how and why and where and what and please tell me, please talk to me, is it true what you just said, please be honest with me here.”
“Potter…” Draco groaned irritably, but Potter still didn’t respond. Draco therefore decided to bring out the big guns. He put down his tea and his quill, and stared at Potter for a while, until the latter looked up. Then, Draco smiled widely and leant in to give Potter a teasing kiss, pulling back just as Potter tried to deepen it.
“Anyways,” Scorpius interrupted him with an eye roll. “Papa’s stupidity happened. Long story. But it only proves that he likes Harry. By the way, can you convince the other Weasleys to join in our match-making? Then we would be with fifteen, it should be enough, right?”
Even though Draco hated him, a shock went through his spine. Seeing Potter dead was not something he had expected to see. The Dark Lord had defeated him. Of course he would have, not even Potter can keep surviving the wrath of such a powerful wizard. What a shame.
And so, the first classes passed by. Apart from Lazarus, Draco didn’t receive any trouble for his absence or the duel with Potter.
Some stilted conversation followed between them, until Draco broke the polite bubble they had been in, and looked Hermione straight in the eye.
With a grin, Potter resumed cooking the main course of dinner. “Well, everything for the princess, right?”
“Let me. If you would need more time until we are proper friends, that’s all right, too, you know. It doesn’t need to happen immediately.”
The back of the note seemed to have been scrawled on there in a hurry, as if it was added in the last second.
Among loud cheers from the others in the room, including Potter, the traitor, Draco stood up to take away Pansy’s dangerously swirling glass and have her sit down. A sound of disappointment went through the room when it became clear that Draco was not going to sing in front of them, and no, Pansy, he would also not be dancing, especially not on
Scoffing, Neville made a disbelieving gesture. “We were the same age. You can’t say that just because
Grabbing one, he kneeled in front of the tree and observed the presents underneath. Lily joined him. “They’re not wrapped by you, dad,” she said. “Did Draco wrap them?”
“Papa,” he heard behind him. As he turned around, Cassie’s face was visible, but see through. “Papa, I already have the documents. I have everything.”
Theresa chuckled. “No, I have the idea that the bullying has stopped. At least the way Terence and Priscus did it. It’s mostly for myself.”
“Then why is Ophiuchus getting so close, if there is a danger of harm?” Minerva inquired disapprovingly, worried.
“Oh, but he is. ‘Calculating’ is probably a better word for him, and ‘manipulative’ would be Cassie. Phi is actually ‘devious’, and then Aquila can be described by ‘scheming’.”
“Patience, Ophiuchus. You know papa, he is going to postpone it as long as humanly possible. Until he collapses from pining,” Aquila stated.
Hermione waved it away with a slight smile. “Don’t mention it. Now, tell me how my children are doing at Hogwarts. Especially Hugo. Is he all right?”
“Draco, are you alright? I am so… so… so proud of you. You killed the Dark Lord, Draco. It was so brave. Draco, thank you” she softly whispers in his ear. “I can’t believe you did that. You seemed quite out of it, for a while. Like you had no idea what just happened. But then you looked at –. Never mind. We’ll take about this later.”
A few students, mostly Gryffindors, looked sheepishly at their bubbling cauldrons. Draco bit his own smug look away.
Greg hummed in agreement with Blaise. “Lately, there haven’t been many stories about Cassie running around and breaking things. Has she calmed somewhat?”
All three of them nodded and smiled sadly, taking a breath to prepare themselves for the following conversation. Draco rolled his eyes, but started fidgeting lightly with the covers of his bed.
“Of course, darling,” Potter simpered back. “I am so sorry I let myself lose control like that. I just can’t bear the thought of you sitting here, all alone.”
Scorpius’s anger had subsided a bit, but he had gotten protective over Cassie. He was the one that stopped her fights and calmed her down. They often disappeared together to talk, after which Scorpius immediately sought out Albus and dragged him to their dorm.
“Oh, I don’t know, every single professor with a brain? Not that you would understand, given your own brainless head.”
They moved from the small gallery to the library, but didn’t stay there for long. The moment they got back into the dining room, where everyone was already seated, Phi and Aquila shot up. Phi flung himself at Lucius, who caught him so easily that everyone seemed surprised. Lucius very wisely pretended that nothing was wrong and sat down at the head of the table, with Phi in his lap.
“At least now we know that the stories of their rivalry weren’t exaggerated,” Scorpius joked softly. Albus smiled at him.  “They really can come up with hurtful things, can’t they?”
“That way,” Potter pointed, a yellow diagnostic spell leading them into one of the broader tunnels. Silently communicating with Draco, they decided that Potter would go first, wand in hand and measured, trained steps.
Draco smiled, but it lacked the usual brightness. He knew what was coming and was not looking forward to it.
The next morning, Draco and his children appeared in the Great Hall. Aquila sat down next to her siblings, Matias joining her right after.
! Don’t pretend you don’t, please. I’m not stupid. You and I both know who is responsible for killing you.”
“More than just your professors. Ever wanted to terrify Peeves? Ever thought of scaring Mrs. Filch away from your hiding spot? Ever wished you could frighten the portraits? We’ve got just what you need!”
He also remember how he had tried to be like his father, in posture, strength and voice. He looked up to him, admired him. Time and growing up had ruined that for him.
His children. Yes, his treasures and the best things that ever happened to him. He couldn’t even regret marrying Astoria, because this marriage had given him the kind of happiness he would never have hoped to have. And now that Astoria was gone from his life, it was perfect.
“So, are you going to tell me what you were thinking?” Potter barked to the two smug-looking Gryffindors in front of him. They were in some corridor close to the Defense classroom. Keira sent him a grin.
“Keira has gotten detention with Flitwick, because she was too cheeky and rude. She lost the Gryffindors fifty points in total,” Albus grinned, nudging James, who grimaced.
, 1998 at the Great Lake at Hogwarts, death by drowning. Probable suicide. Slytherin. Her parents were Phalanx May and Shania May-Lithuan, both died March 19
“It’s all right if you don’t want to tell me, you know. It’s your life. I’m just wondering why you would even need my approval for your date,” Draco said, while the beginnings of a smirk tugged the corners of his mouth up. Potter narrowed his eyes at him, while Draco stayed focussed on James.
As Draco was pondering what to answer, Theresa and James were walking out, their bickering loud but comforting. In the end, when their voices had faded away, Draco stuffed the note in his pocket and stalked towards Hagrid’s hut.
For now, enjoy the chapter. Please come scream at me when you've finished reading it, because I'm bouncing on my seat.
Loud laughter from the room next door and a bang that didn’t predict much good, interrupted whatever had been about to happen. Draco schooled his defeat inhumanly quick behind a friendly, less loaded expression.
Draco swallowed. When he heard Ms. Euripideia finish her conversation outside, he quit the spell and cast one that would take virtual pictures of the office.
They walked over a small path, lined with high grasses, which blocked the view to the right and the left. Right before the path rounded in the direction of a tree, Potter stopped Draco and stood in front of him.
The picture showed James and Lily on their wedding day, standing in front of a blossoming tree and smiling so happily at the camera. They hugged each other tight, Lily wiping away a few wet tears of happiness.
Potter chuckled when he saw the eagerness with which Draco appeared at his door. He poured two glasses of water and sat down in one of the chairs. When Draco nodded at him to start talking, Potter rolled his eyes and started telling how Christmas came about and what it entailed now.
“You say that as a joke, but the awful truth is that many do visit the shop, just because I occasionally buy something there,” Potter remarked with a sigh.
Harry itched his chin. “That’s not how relationships ought to work, especially when you’re this young and the relationship in itself is in such an early stage.”
Harry shrugged. “And here I was thinking the Malfoys were as impeccably trained as lap dogs. Must have been wrong.”
When Potter had finished his second slice, Draco brought the dishes back to his kitchenette. He was quickly cleaning them, when Potter called from the living room.
Pansy pulled a large vial of something that looked suspiciously like Veritaserum from her purse. “We are wizards, Ron. Honesty isn’t difficult to ensure.”
“He gets warm easily, while I stay cold always. He throws away the covers and wants open windows, whereas I just want to be enveloped in warmth. It doesn’t work.”
“Papa! Papa, look at – what are you wearing?” Scorpius sounded. He frowned disapprovingly at Draco’s hat.
“One problem though,” Albus joined in. “Only four of us know Mr. Malfoy well enough, while he will be the most difficult to get through.”
“Do I hear my son being threatened?” Potter asked amusedly, languidly coming their way. “Hi, love,” he mumbled when he kissed Draco’s cheek. “Have I missed something?”
Astoria swallowed. “I have multiple reasons. Draco has never had a good father figure himself. He was raised in tumultuous times, with a lot of violence around him while was growing up. His father never loved him the way a father would love a son, and so, Draco doesn’t know how to express love. He only knows that he should continue the Malfoy line and produce an heir. He has that heir now, but he doesn’t know that Scorpius is more than just an heir. He treats Scorpius like an adult, ever since he could walk and talk, and he pressures Scorpius to be better than he really can be. He even forced Scorpius to sign business papers when he was only seven years old.”
. Long, short, with or without pictures. The only similarity between all those articles, was that they were about Harry James Potter. He had survived some evil attack. No one really knew where he lived now, or whether he was still alive after the attack. However, at least once a week, the paper wrote something about him. They rehearsed his survival, or retold stories about his parents. Draco loved all these stories. The Boy-Who-Lived made him feel like he could do anything. Like he was protected, even if his mother couldn’t protect him. Perhaps his Partnosus would be Harry Potter. Draco smiled smugly to himself. He was only six years old, and he already knew what a Partnosus was. It was something that could protect you from harm, because it was made of happy memories. He only knew what it was, because he heard his father yell about it in the library one day. His father couldn’t make one. But his father didn’t need magic to protect himself. He was strong.
“Who's there?” Draco said internally flinching at the sound of his voice cutting through the almost silence. He was about to say something else but his words died in his throat and the panic that had all but dissipated, came rushing back. He has been a student at Hogwarts for 6 years now. And hed been witness for some awful things done at the hands of Voldemort and his father. But nothing really came close to what he could see now. To what he had blindly run past just moments ago. The entire room seemed stained. Of course, it was not the entire room but Draco's tunnel vision made it seem like the entire room. Red, Draco's favorite color. Red splattered on the floor, not 2 feet from where he was standing. Red droplets leading from the crude looking splatter to a stall door. A door with half a red handprint smeared on the edge. Red. Draco didn't know what he was doing. In his head, he knew he needed to run and to get help and to not touch anything just to get a teacher to handle this, but there was a pull. His feet moved without permission, following the path of red, going against everything his mind was screaming at him. He reached out his hand to push the door open. A part of him was terrified of what he would find hiding behind the stall door. There was, however, a part of him that knew. The door swung open and everything inside of him fell to pieces.
“I need to see him.” he cringed at how pathetic he sounded. At how un-Malfoy he sounded. He wondered idly to himself if he could even be considered a Malfoy anymore. Being in love with  Harry Potter was sure to put a strain on his relationship with his father, wouldn’t it? He tried not to think about the consequences of his current situation.
He sat back on the floor, against his door and allowed himself thirty seconds to properly freak out.
It was late enough in the day now that if Harry were to show himself, He’d be expected to do something for his aunt for the rest of the day. But He wasn’t exactly wanting to wait and let Malfoy get possibly worse either. Harry considered the options, not that there were many. Go out the front door, get noticed by his aunt, not be able to escape her until Vernon came home. Or, out the window beside his bed, probably break his ankle, and hope whatever help came for Malfoy would send a quick episky his way before they were off.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was alive. There was blood. Merlin, but there was blood trailing from and clinging to him. Matted in the hair that looked too familiar to Harry. Three was blood, and his body was facing away from him. He couldn’t see any signs of breathing. He wasn’t sure what to do if the boy was dead. Did he leave him? No. No child Should see something like that. No boy should be left this way. Abandoned and bloody. Anyway, Harry had heard him cough, hadn’t he?  Harry was equally unsure of what to do if the boy was alive. He wasn’t a healer. But either way, Harry had to do
“No, you didn’t. Otherwise, you would have hinted on it, as an inside joke. Am I not your son anymore?”
Draco didn’t find out what the buzz was until he met up with Theresa Zarnel, the fifth-year that would be his apprentice and helping hand in his experiment with Neville’s magically adapted plants.
Draco could only nod. He saw the last bit of determined anger fall from his daughter’s face as she laid herself down next to him and pushed close.
“Telling me your nightmare. Which you should, otherwise it’ll become worse and worse and you’ll have no one to talk to.”
Draco had gotten Charlie Weasley a tiny little dragon that fit in the palm of his hand. Charlie couldn’t stop cooing at the animal for the rest of the animal, even using its small puffs of fire to light the candles.
“James, I think… I think you should go back home. Not because you’re not capable enough, but you already saved papa from the curse. You’ve done enough. Also, they’ll send you back immediately, while they will want to keep me there. I’ll be with Quills then.”
The various members of the movement would all be tried today. Most of them would be tried together, but some of the top tier, such as Laurentia, Sifra Euripideia and Aurors Withal and Septimius, would get their separate punishments. The children involved would be tried in a private trial, and their names would not be named in any newspaper. Draco’s idea.
Those people were saddled with cauldron cleaning duty of that afternoon, which was horrible, because they had made a foul smelling potion.
HA you didn't expect this, did you? But here I am, offering you a new chapter in exchange for your forgiveness. Also, don't forget that I will finish this story (I'll just keep saying it in case you forget), even though it may take a while. Don't hesitate to poke me on Tumblr (i-am-and-proud) if you think I'm taking too long. I usually have really wonderful excuses, but don't let those deceive you.
“Just hold up one second, just one second,” Harry shook his head. “Scorpius has been keeping a werewolf company during full moon? How – what – no!”
“Yes. The ingredient that counters the babbling of Veritaserum, doesn’t work well with the ingredients that causes the physical disability to speak an untruth. It clashes, and results in heart failure. A healthy, grown man will die in twenty-seven minutes and forty seconds. Women, children, older people, ill people, they will all die sooner.”
I knew it was because I missed you so much. I was so dependent on you being around me, influencing me, correcting me. And, honestly, I knew I was gay when Ginny and I broke up. I just didn’t know it was
“If your eyes were even remotely working, you would see that I already am entertained this evening.”
“No, I just bought it, obviously. It’s fresh from the oven,” Draco smiled. He put the cake down and Accio’ed a large knife. “Shall we have breakfast with this cake?”
George, who followed her, couldn’t help but laugh. “If it is any consolation, I think you are very manly and rugged. Very much my type, if I would have been into the whole male specimen-thing.”
Draco inclined his head at Bill before turning to Fleur. “Bonjour,” he greeted, feeling the slightest bit more comfortable because he could talk French.
At dinner, many exciting faces were seen. James was telling Lily, Albus, who was joining the Gryffindor table for a few minutes, and the Weasleys about his conversation with Draco. Albus then casually walked to the Slytherins and repeated the story, after which Ophiuchus was sent out to Aquila to inform her as well.
“But we are getting off track,” Phi announced. “The point is that you should talk. You do not need to do it now, but this way, we at least got your attention and hopefully got it through your skulls that you need to talk. It’s up to you, really.”
Draco pasted an ugly sneer on his face. “Surely you had other father figures. Perhaps some godfather?” he taunted.
“And last night was the worst one yet.” Her eyes were watery, but she seemed determined to continue. “I saw papa – I know it was him, because he looked so much like Scorpius. Papa was being tortured by a creepy man with red eyes, the man that appears in many nightmares. Papa was screaming and crying. The man was angry with him, I don’t know why, but apparently papa had done something wrong.
So absorbed in trying to convince Neville of his perfect control, Draco didn’t notice how brightly Potter suddenly blushed. He should stop being surprised by these things, because Pansy already told him Draco was in love with him, but it was odd to actually see it. Now that he started to understand how Draco acted around people he cared about, now that Draco seemed comfortable enough to joke and flirt a bit with Potter, it got harder and harder to think clearly about what they were doing.
Whithal nodded sympathetically, before allowing Doctor Selaminder to question Astoria. Doctor Selaminder kept quiet for a second, but then stood close to Astoria and went on to have a faux-casual conversation with her.
“He says he’s fine, but that’s only because he thinks we don’t see he is self-destructing again. He’s trying to keep his distance from everyone that isn’t directly related to him.”
“I have guests over, and I’m not sure you would want to talk to them,” he said apologetically. Potter’s face fell.
“First of all, it is an incredibly well-written piece of work. Well done. A couple of things were not to my satisfaction, however. I have marked those, so you can review it. If you would want to, I could sit with you and explain my choices.”
“Why? Phi also commented on it. What’s wrong with them?” he wondered. Cassie laughed loudly and patted his shoulder.
“Something’s wrong!” Phi shouted to the others, before following Draco through the labyrinth, back into the garden. “Papa, in the silent garden,” he spotted, making Draco swerve towards that part of the garden.
Draco grabbed a quill and scribbled his answer on the paper, sending it back to Potter. “I don’t think any of this is your business.”
Blaise chuckled grimly. “Nightmares. Fear of the dark. Fear of silence. Fear of nightmares. Worrying. Fear of what could happen if he let go of control. Fear of what his children may have to live with. Fear of being abandoned. Probably thinking of how to polish the Malfoy name, so his children will have a better life. Working on how to help people he harmed through the war. You name it.”
It did, luckily. Zarnel wanted so badly to hurt Draco, to make him snap, that his apparent disinterest made her spill her secrets much quicker.
“I’m going for a breather. Be right back,” Draco announced cheerily, shoving his chair away and practically running to the back door.
Perhaps he was a Squib. Could Harry Potter be a Squib? That would explain why he didn’t live in the Wizarding World, or at least, why no one was able to find him. Draco suddenly felt like he was punched in the gut. If his hero was a Squib, he would never be able to meet him. He would never see him walking in Diagon Alley, he would never shake his hand, or invite him to his home. His father wouldn’t allow it. Ever. Oh, please, let Harry Potter be a wizard!
“Oh yes, there most certainly is. I’m glad you’ve noticed as well,” Albus responded then. Rose only smiled.
“We’re heading upstairs,” Ron said sternly. “So the two of you can start canoodling when we’ve left, yeah? ‘Mione and I will pretend that we don’t know.”
Auror Whithal and Auror Septimius stood up, both nodded at the Wizengamot, and then walked over to where Draco was seated.
“I suspect your lycanthropy student isn’t the only one,” Lucius frowned. “What did you say the last names of Terence and Priscus were?”
Hiya, I'm a bit late on the update, sorry! I wrote a longer chapter though, so perhaps you won't mind as much?
“You shouldn’t let people walk all over you. Harry, you have to make sure people don’t walk all over him. He lets that happen,” Pansy complained.
(I have to go to college tomorrow again and I don't feel like it. I had three weeks of holiday and two days of missing the introduction lessons for new courses, and now they expect me to start again? GRUMBLE I DON'T WANT TO. But on the other hand, I'll have a course I think I'll enjoy tomorrow and Thursday, so I guess everything is fine. I'll live.
Draco’s eyes sparkled with a challenge, which Potter decided to ignore, and focus on something else instead.
“- which Draco had made all by himself. He had never gone to the beach as a romantic outing before, and he kept saying how he hated it, but at the end he realised that it could actually be really fun, and he didn’t have to worry about his hair too much. We talked a bit – we are going to stay at Draco’s this summer, by the way, for a multitude of reasons – and then, ehm.”
“Can we talk about you, for a second now? For example, are you still in touch with your friends from school?”
s from decennia ago. In one of them, there was of picture of a certain dark-haired wizard who defeated some very big bad man.”
Draco steered Potter back to the sofa, where they both laid down. The air was tense with awkwardness, or at least, that’s how Draco felt it. When Potter made a soft noise, Draco looked at him and saw Potter already gazing his way with watery eyes.
Potter laughed beside Draco, the rumbles vibrating through to Draco. He hadn’t noticed they were sitting so close.
“All right then,” Draco sighed, slowly sinking down on the other side of the sofa. “What are your questions?”
In the Three Broomsticks, there was near to none interaction between Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, which was a surprising occurrence, based on what my source told me. However, there were many secret glances, in which Mr. Malfoy was much more subtle than Mr. Potter. At a certain point, Mr. Potter gave up all pretence and just kept staring at his supposed partner.
Ophiuchus nodded. “Exactly. And he becomes pliable and easily manipulated whenever someone offers him ice cream. You can literally make him do anything. Watch.”
“No worries, really. We enjoyed it,” Alexa smiled. She offered her hand and Draco took it as gracefully as he could. He liked her.
“No, because I wouldn’t hesitate to tell them if something was bothering me,” Potter stated pointedly. He stood up from the table, crowded closer and rested his forehead on Draco’s shoulder. “Godric, I thought this day would be nice.”
During his first lesson, some girls were continuously giggling about an apparently endlessly fascinating subject. Draco barely suppressed his constant eye rolls. When he caught a few sentences, he started to get really annoyed, though.
“James,” Draco said when he reached him. The boy turned around with a shocked expression on his face, but quickly greeted with a smile. He became nervous though, when he saw the essay under Draco’s arm.
“I’d like to say something” he starts, like the secret Hufflepuff he is. Draco tries to tune out, but he can’t. “It doesn’t matter that Harry’s gone.” ‘It doesn’t? I believe it changes everything.’ Trying to keep an indifferent look on his face, and trying not to let his mother feel his trembling, he pays close attention to Longbottom’s speech.
Mother checked whether he had really been killed. She asked him whether I was safe, and when Potter answered in the positive, she told Riddle that Potter was truly dead. She is a very strong Occlumens, and Riddle didn’t see through her lie. Hagrid, who had been taken hostage, had to carry Potter’s body to the courtyard, where everyone had been fighting or waiting for them to return.
“It wasn’t you, James. Long story short, Lily and I went outside for a bit, but almost got hit by the Whomping Willow. Right, Lills?”
Potter prepared to do the Traffic Control, whatever that was, but Draco threw his head back and laughed.
His mother laughed brightly. “Slytherins are supposed to like bitter flavours, like dark chocolate, and here you are, addicted to milk and white. I don’t think Mr. Potter is the most stereotypical Gryffindor, so don’t assume things about him,” she berated him. “But you should ask him, and I promise to arrange the best flavours for him. Send my regards to Pansy and Blaise, will you? And if you need any help with Gregory, you may ask me as well. Good night, sweetheart.”
“All right. I think I will see you tomorrow then. And contact me when there is a change. Middle of the day, middle of the night, it doesn’t matter. I will come here straight away.”
Swallowing a couple of times, Potter blinked away the tears brimming in the corners of his eyes before walking over to Draco and hugging him close. Smiths wore a wisp of a smile in his otherwise impassive expression, still blankly staring at the wall in front of him.
An owl sent to me caught my interest. The owl, from a reliable source, told me that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were getting close. They are both Professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, our Saviour teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Draco Malfoy Potions. Mr. Malfoy also is assigned position of Head of Slytherin House.
“Scorpius. Scorpius. Scorpius? Scorp? Scorro? Love? Scorpius, can you hear me? Scorp. Scorp. Scorpius!” Draco’s voice grew louder and louder, his face screwed up in worry.
“No, you aren’t,” Potter whispered against Draco’s lips, giving him three pecks. Draco had pulled his knee up on the sofa, and his hand had found its way to Potter’s thigh. Potter leant his head on Draco’s shoulder, until the smiles they shared turned into giggles.
“Why I blame the children? Well, all right, I could blame my marriage instead of my children. Or growing up. The thing is, over the years I have become rasher, and I’ve been… trying to do the right thing. ‘Be like Saint Potter,’ I thought to myself,” Draco grinned. Potter gave him a playful slap. “I just… some of the ‘do evil things because it’s interesting’ have lost their shine, you know? I can’t quite explain it, but looking back, I can pinpoint the exact moments where I have been distinctly Gryffindor in the way I raised my children.”
“The last time I was on the stand, it was for my own trial. I don’t have the happiest of memories of that courtroom.”
“I told them everything from the moment they were old enough to understand. I wanted them to know who I was, what I’d done, so they would be prepared for the harsh world. And it felt like I would be lying to them, pretend I was a better man than I really am, if I didn’t tell them.”
“Don’t you dare mention such a thing. My precious Aquila won’t be sullied by any man. She’ll always stay pure,” he stated dramatically.
“Yes, I do. Can we change the subject now? Like to how head over heels Draco still is for you? How he can’t stop staring at you and blushing when you look at him?”
At Pansy’s smug smile, Potter groaned, but perked up again, almost invisibly. “But that means I haven’t been imagining the other things either. Right?”
Draco looked around at the large buildings he could see over the rooftops and was sorely tempted to stare with his mouth wide open. It was so different from any Wizarding town he had ever been. Even Melksham, which didn’t have a Wizarding community at all, didn’t look like this.
“When papa is attached to someone, friends or family or something like that, he touches his ear with his pointer finger. Not any other finger; his pointer. And when he really, really likes you, his finger slides down to his chin, as if he’s thinking.”
The next day was a day without classes, since it was Saturday. It was also a Hogsmeade weekend, and Draco was asked by his children – and begged by Ophiuchus – to go with them. Technically, Cassie wasn’t allowed to go yet, but McGonagall was easily convinced when Draco said it was a family outing.
Before the Dark Lord can respond accurately, Potter jumps behind the stone walls. Understandably, the Dark Lord fires spell after spell, misses Potter again and again. Around Draco, some Death Eaters decide it’s becoming too dangerous. Others disappear to reappear somewhere else in the fight. His mother grabs his hand and starts dragging him away. Over the bridge, away from danger. Away from Potter. Who lives. ‘Potter is alive.’ His head drums. ‘Potter is alive?’ Behind him he hears yelling, the sound of a shield charm cast.
“A day, actually.” Potter grinned and put the mugs of tea down. “I went up to the Manor and I may have demanded their approval. Mrs. Malfoy was agreeable enough –“
“Very good, Draco. I am proud of you. Can you come to hold their arms, while I place the Mark?” the man said. “They will obey to –“
Harry looked pensive. “And yet, I was able to break in quite easily when I was younger. And knowing the Ministry, they won’t have updated any of the security systems.”
“Really Draco, you haven’t attended many parties with me and your father as hosts, and you don’t know the feeling yourself, but it is so satisfactory to do. You should host your own party soon, I am sure you have the skills,” she smiled.
“I know you have some kind of trouble with people and trust and whatnot, but my dad always told me that if we don’t have faith, we won’t achieve anything. Ever. And I understand that you stay aloof and maybe keep people at an arm’s length, but you don’t realise what kind of enormous force we have combined! Do you not remember the way we turned the public opinion during your trials? And how Scorpius – on his own! – convinced the
The man of the shop blanched. Looking around to see whether other customers were listening, he took the Prophecy Ball and placed it back in the window, after which he stayed away from Draco and his children.
“What, you –“ Potter started. He grabbed the bag of flour and started throwing pinches towards Draco, who ducked away every time.
“And whose fault is that?” Draco shot back, seeing that his father had started to connect the dots; the strange flavour of chocolate in the shape of lightning bolts and Sleekeazy’s bottles.
Also also, there's (hopefully) coming a new chapter next week, since you know, this one ends with a cliffhanger.
The duel stayed innocent enough, until McGonagall left to her office for … something. Potter’s face twisted in a scowl that turned uglier with every Shield Draco threw up and every offensive spell he countered. He refused to attack, but stayed with his defensive tactic, since he wasn’t sure how it would be perceived if he hurt the Wizarding Wonder.
“Shit. Shit shit shit, no, please, no, please, shit, this can’t be happening,” Draco chanted softly, speeding up a notch. He was now sprinting.
Scorpius broke into a grin. “Knowing papa, it isn’t a complete impossibility. Your father is gay, right?”
“As a matter of fact, I was going to visit Draco, but he isn’t in yet. So, here I am. You must be thrilled.”
“I was so sure that you were up to something, back in sixth year. I followed you around, with the Marauder’s Map and my Cloak, and I knew something was going on. But then you appeared there, and I realised that, even though you were still doing something that wasn’t right, you were also depressed, and tired. So I followed you to Myrtle’s bathroom, wanting to confront you in hopes that you might talk to me, even if it would be in a fight. You have a habit of being the most honest during fights. And then you were crying, and you wanted to Crucio me, which, let’s be honest, wouldn’t have made much of a difference, because you couldn’t muster up the right amount of hate.”
“Mr. Malfoy, you know I can’t know that. She might be. She went through quite a terrible time. Then again, she’s your daughter. She’s strong. Always has been.”
Turning on his heel, Draco Apparated to the front door of the Malfoy Manor, surprised when the door was opened immediately by a house-elf.
There was silence again. They both sipped from their expensive wine and were lost in their thoughts.
Phi reluctantly put the book on his bedside table and turned on his side. Draco knew he wouldn’t sleep until the lights were off, so he quickly changed into his pyjamas and waved the lights off. He lay staring at the ceiling, slowly feeling himself relax into a drowsy state.
Albus laughed louder. “You should have seen your face when you realised you were standing under the mistletoe! You were really disappointed when he walked away, weren’t you?”
Scorpius nudged Cassie and laughed at her indignant scowl. A few more teasing comments ensued, but in the end, everyone agreed to not use all their Slytherin powers to find whoever was posting the notes.
Potter looked at his plate and bit his lip in hesitation. “I don’t know whether I’m supposed to say. It was some kind of a secret. Albus told James, who told me.”
Somewhere at the end however, McGonagall asked him to perform some spells. Even though Draco consented, he felt it would go wrong. When Potter climbed up the stage at the other side, he knew it would go wrong.
“A warthog?” Draco burst out laughing. “Love, you can’t say you are a warthog when just now, you were adamant about not having curves.” He was glad to see her cracking a smile.
