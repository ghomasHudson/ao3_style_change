His dream was once again invaded by the unknown blond. Harry moaned and groaned as his skin caught alit with how softly those lips kissed him. Harrys hands instantly went down to the raging hard on he had, soon his underwear became spoiled. Harry awoke, his eyes groggy. He groaned and shrugged the underwear off discarding them off the side of the bed and falling back to sleep.
"I love you." He whispered, staring deeply into Dracos shimmering grey eyes.
Hermione looked to him now, a panicked look on her face. “Oh, Harry I didn’t mean to offend you, I just mean you have to be pretty brave keeping that calm look on your face all this time.” Hermione seemed to be careful with her words, Harry relaxed a little, he knew she didn’t mean any harm.
Harry with no choice now but to follow McGonagall nodded his head and obeyed. McGonagall lead the way and the bell rang.
“Welcome to Hogwarts kitchen.” Draco said proudly beaming at Harry.
Harry still couldn't believe it. He is now a professor at Hogwarts. Blue cooed again for his attention, Harry assumed she would want some food however another letter fell to the floor. Harry picked it up and instantly recognised the handwriting to be Malfoys.
“Now kick off!”
Draco gave him a confused look, “you don’t have to be nice to them you know, they’re just elves.”
“Ron oi wake up.” Harry shook him, Ron stopped snoring and groaned swatting Harrys hands away.
“Yeah I did…” He spoke sheepishly, causing Harry’s heart to skip a beat.
Harry nodded at Ron; he couldn’t help but feel very relieved that his punishment wasn’t so bad.
“Come old man time for bed.”
“Ron you’re gonna miss breakfast again.”
Harry Potter looked up into glistening grey eyes of Sirius Black and he instantly calmed down. Sirius face was taught with grief and tears that he could not stop streamed down his face. The crack of someone apparating alerted Sirius and he desperately looked around for his wand which he had placed somewhere in his panic. But soon the familiar face of Remus Lupin bolted through the nursery.
"We will fight a lot, and well I'm not really good enough for you." He rushed. "Me an ex-death eater side by side with The Saviour. How that won't ever leave the papers!" He chuckled, but his chuckle empty and defeated.
“Sure, its Remus approved yeah?” Sirius asked, scanning through the top shelf for the book.
“Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me," Hermione gushed. "Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.”
“Both!” Neville laughed dryly.
“Nah he’ll be fine, it’s a bit wordy but other than that its just an adventure fantasy book.”
Harry took in a deep breathe, braved another a look around the corner, the troll too occupied with the booger that it had taken out of his nose did not notice him, Harry took this chance and ran across the hall, the troll looked up at the sound and roared. Harry barrelled into the door of the girls bathroom and slammed into one of the toilets. He locked the door and popped himself up on the toilet seat, however he soon realised that all the troll would have to do was look over the door and see him.
I sighed at Hermione, one thing I knew after these few years of friendship was that I couldn't hide anything from her. Hermione's eyebrows furrowed as she realised the quick change in atmosphere.
Harry sighed and collapsed into the cleanest armchair of the living room in 12 Grimmauld place. Today was a day that once again left him feeling physically and mentally exhausted. He sighed and lifted himself with a groan from the chair and staggered to the bathroom to shower the dreads of the day off him. His muscles ached as he scrubbed himself clean, his skin almost gleaming from how raw he had scrubbed himself clean.
“Hermione just take a deep breathe, hey I want you to imagine flying through the clouds, imagine touching them, imagine the wind on your face, making your eyes water and you nose cold. Imagine all of that then ask for the broom, ask for it to rise up.”
They made it the greenhouses with fifteen minutes to spare, they weren’t the only students that had arrived early and the group mingled with others, introducing each other and just awkwardly holding small talk.
“Yeah well, my parents don’t cook so I’m not really sure what a nice home cooked dinner smells like, and the next best smelling place in my memory is my garden.” Draco shrugged. Harry stored this piece of information into a safe place in his brain, this felt like it was something that Draco wouldn’t tell another person.
"Because I started to think what my life would be like without you and it made me cry." He shrugged. Draco breathed out a sigh of relief. "Oh, Harry I'm right here you don't have to worry about those things." He brushed the tears away from Harrys cheek with the pad of his thumb. He kissed Harrys salty lips and smiled softly at him.
Hermione seemed to relax a bit more, but he knew she would continue to worry until he saw how he really went in his first game.
Draco makes his way outside of the castle wards so that he can apparate the rest of the way, however as he leaves the wards he decides that a nice walk in the crisp morning air is a good way to clear ones mind.
The smell of food wafting from the doors sped up their pace. They entered the hall with their stomachs rumbling and their mouths watering. Harry surveyed the other tables, it was still quite early in the morning so only a small amount of students currently occupied the hall. Harry noticed a familiar mop of platinum blond and had a small desire to go over to the Slytherin table and say hi to Malfoy.
He leaned forward and pecked him on the lips, Draco's eyes instantly fluttering shut. "I want us."
“But wont people get mad about it?” Harry asked, he typically liked to stay away from situations that gave him a great amount of attention.
“Thanks.” Harry spoke absently and picked up a sandwich. His eyes still clouded with whatever he was thinking about. Draco wanted to desperately know what was making Harry think so deep in thought that he didn’t even pay attention to Draco, he was usually so attentive to him.
Draco took a moment to absorb what had just been said to him. Harry still sat there, with his hands clenched together in his lap and his leg jumping up and down, showing just how nervous Harry was.
“Why don’t we go back to the tower to just get our books in order than we can make our way to the greenhouses?”
Draco looked away as he lied. “I only found out about it recently.
Harry took a big sigh, as if whatever he was going to say he would regret. "Draco I have something to admit to you." His green eyes looked to Draco's stormy grey ones, his eyes almost begging him to understand but understand what, Draco did not know.
Harry sighed and nestled his head in his arms on the table, the boring yet lulling voice of the ghostly Professor soon made Harry drift into sleep. Harry groaned and shoved off the hand that was rudely shaking him.
“Who do you think you are?” Ron said offended.
“Harry Potter!” She called.
The letter short and simple, but him knowing his mother well knew how much she didn't want this.
All the first years quickly clambered out of their seat and began to follow the two Heads of Houses. Ron, Harry and Hermione walked with each other, not speaking and just absorbing the castle. Each wall was covered with portraits of wizards and witches, each portrait moved and waved at those pasting. Harry wanted to stop and talk to some of them, but knew that if he did, he would get left behind and become impossibly lost.
"Harry." Draco called from the bedroom.
"Umm yes."
Everyone shuffled along, trying to get to a broom, Harry stood next to his feeling confident in his abilities, as he looked around, he could see some were a bit nervous and some like him were confident.
Harry soon looked up from the floor, his fingers slightly raw from how long he had been dragging them against the walls and faced the towering Severus Snape.
Harry couldn’t help but agree.
"Good morning good sir." He nodded his head politely than his eyes fixated on the owl. "Oh, I see you have found yourself a phoenix owl."
“I’m sorry about my friend Ron, I think he was just a bit overwhelmed by this all.”
"Draco our love is the strongest magic, of course it will work." I searched his gray eyes, and they soon lightened with relief and his shoulders relaxed, he let a small smile show through.
“Of course, I do!” Draco defended, but when he looked to Harry and saw that he meant no harm, he relaxed a little. “Well of course I do… its just home is sometimes very suffocating, trying to be who my parents want me to be and here at Hogwarts I don’t have to try so hard, so it’s nice.”
Keep safe out there yall :)
I turned away from the fire and went to clean the living room, the clanking of the dishes echoing through the empty apartment. I missed Harry, but work had suddenly become extremely busy, Harry had finally managed to catch some runaway death eaters, and quickly found out about their plans of regrouping once again. This news had kept him at work, constantly trying to find more of them, find out their plans, find out where they were hiding.
Draco shrugged, “it’s a talent of mine.”
Sirius nodded, he preferred to keep the academics to Remus, although he got good grades at school, he didn’t have that natural talent for teaching unlike Remus did.
Sirius eyed the hallway leading to the bedroom, he was now a bit worried at the absence of Remus.
“Harry what are you doing down here at the dungeons?” Draco asked a warm smile framing his face.
The hole was just big enough for one person to go through at a time. The wait was long but soon enough everyone was in what was called the Common Room.
Eventually Harrys eyes grew too heavy for him too keep scribbling away at the paper, he yawned rubbed his eyes and packed up his stuff, heading up to his bed. Harry slept fitfully that night, Snape haunted his dreams and a man unwrapping something like a scarf from his head kept appearing. Harry wasn’t sure what any of this meant when he woke up in the morning, but by breakfast most of the details had become too hazy for him to think about.
The long grey beard and the grey robes instantly calmed the men, Dumbledore had arrived.
“Argh okay I’m awake, ger’ off me.” Harry groaned, sitting up and finding his glasses on his bedside table.
“Woman intuition…” Harry groans out, banging his head on her desk in embarrassment.
Once all the Gryffindor first years had arrived at the hall, Professor McGonagall swept through and handed out their timetables. They all looked down excitedly to their timetables, their first classes for the today would realistically determine the mood for the first day.
Harry looked to Snape who did not look impressed nor convinced.
“Just be careful of that one will you mate.” Ron glared, going back to his food.
Oliver leant down and clicked open the box, within the box contained two other larger balls, quaffles, but Oliver didn’t unhook these balls from their restraints. He carefully undid the strap that held down the golden snitch and picked it up gently, placing it onto the palm of his hand.
Harry was not absent in noticing the female attention that he had gathered. Girls giggled as he walked by and some boys stared at him with jealousy or admiration, Harry wasn’t one to be shy of the attention, he didn’t savour it but he didn’t go around actively avoiding it either. He just simply accepted the attention and made sure to be polite.
Hermione was not the first to come down from the female dorms rather it was a seventh year who looked like she had no sleep at all. Harry gave her a polite smile and went back to his reading, the seventh year sat on a couch and stared at the fire in what seemed like a daze.
I looked to the potion that I finally managed to obtain, this potion was vital to the process of the mating ceremony, the potion would temporarily make a womb inside me to allow the baby grow, and the blue moon provided the needed magic to activate the potion. The crackle from the fire place, and the familiar footsteps told me that Harry had arrived home, I looked to my watch and was surprised to find that he was home on time.
“Well I guess.” Harry sighed. He went back to get his cup then sat down across from Draco.
Draco.
“Has anyone seen a toad? Nevilles lost one.” She said. The girl was slightly huffed with bushy out of place chestnut hair, her face was nice but her teeth seemed to be a bit bucked Harry noticed.
Hermione just giggled a little. “It’s okay, so have you and Harry known each other for a long time then?” She asked, slowly eating her food with small mouthfuls.
"Blimey they're hot." I hissed, shaking my hand in attempt to cool my fingertips.
“Oh.” Hermione said, blushing lightly and slowing down. Harry not wanting anyone to fight turned to Ron.
Harry turned to her. “You have siblings?” Harry asked, he had never heard her mention any siblings.
“About time we go I think.” He said, sending her an apologetic smile. Hermione finally looked relieved with this and she enthusiastically nodded her head.
“Remember to not get caught Harry, this school really loves to gossip.” Minerva pats him on the back and shows him the door, he steps out and the door slams shut behind him. Harry jumps and eyes the door with malice. She did that on purpose.
Draco face deepened in colour and he sheepishly looked away. "Thankyou." He whispered. My face instantly lit up with a smile. "Always." I pecked him on the lips and stood away.
"Thank you." I called out softly.
"Draco-" Harry started.
Harry half hoped that Draco would be waiting for him again like the night before, but he was not there so Harry walked back to his dorms by himself, occasionally smiling at those that he passed on the way.
Draco didn't know how to absorb this information so he just smiled in response and continued to sip his drink. Rosmerta busied herself with the usual morning customers that began to roll in. With an hour until breakfast time, Draco quickly finished his second drink and started his hike back to the castle. Though he had drank very little he wanted to make sure he was absolutely sober before he stepped into the castle and what a perfect way to do that by walking for half and hour.
He put his hand out to stop me. "I just wasn't ready for the pain that's all." He breathed out.
Harry cleared his throat. "I'm okay, tired these days but other than that okay." He smiled back. McGonagall nodded her head then got down to business.
“Good, now line up next to a broom and wait for my next instruction.”
By the end of the day he had all his students papers graded and his room looking cleaner than the day that he arrived. Draco prepared himself for bed, thinking perhaps a shower would help soothe his mind, oh how wrong he was.
"Harry." Draco sighed. This year not a lot had returned to Hogwarts, meaning the eight years received their own common rooms and dormitory's instead of their traditional house ones.
“Well thanks for the nice chat Draco, see you in class.” He smiled and left, not letting Draco answer him. He went back to Ron and Hermione who had the most perplexed looks on their faces.
Sirius took Remus hand and gave it a squeeze, “I love you too.”
“Nah not yet, how about we make him breakfast?”
“Yeah me too.” Draco sighed softly, he could feel the weight of sleep falling upon him, he was so comfortable that he let all his defenses fall away. Harry felt a change in the magic surrounding him and realised that Draco had released the protecting spells that constantly surrounded him. Harry’s heart pounded rapidly against his chest. He knew Draco constantly kept protective spells around him, even in his sleep they surrounded him. He had once asked Draco why he did this, Hogwarts was after all one of the safest places for witches and wizards. Draco simply said that he was taught never to let his defenses down so that’s what he did. Harry didn’t push the subject any further.
Harry awoke with a gasp. His heart was pounding and his whole body was shivering. He looked around feeling disoriented and quickly remembered that he was in the nurses wing.
“May I ask why you are sneaking around the corridors during class time?” Snape said, one eyebrow lifted.
One Hufflepuff braver than her Gryffindor classmates put her hand into the air.
“Friends.”
“My cooking cant be that bad can it?”
Ron looked to Harry like he had betrayed him.
The bed newly made from Kreacher welcomed him. He crawled in, placed his wand and glasses on the bed side table and fell into a deep slumber. His dreams no longer haunted him as much as they had when he was a teenager, it seemed he had come to be so numb from emotions that even nightmares of loved one's past and hunting still on the run deatheaters no longer affected him.
“You’re such a smart little boy.” Remus chuckled, ruffling his hair.
However, when Draco and Harry both had the Hogsmeade weekends off he would send a vague letter to Ron and Hermione explaining his absence and have a small dinner with Draco.
Harry looked to the bushy haired girl who had a frown on her face.
“Twenty points from Gryffindor and two weeks worth of detention with me.” Snape sneered but before Harry walked into the classroom Snape spoke once again.
"Good to be home." He whispered, his lips met the side of my cheek, causing butterflies to explode in my stomach, his lips continued to kiss down my neck, I moved my neck to the side to allow him more access, my eyes fluttered shut.
Draco.
“I’m unofficially the new seeker of the Gryffindor quidditch team.”
I stood straight and shook Ron's hand. "Goodluck mate." He shook my hand firm, I nodded my head, "thanks I'll need it." I smirked. He shook his head a small smile ghosting his lips. Hermione stepped into the fire with Hugo, and disappeared into flames, next was Ron and Rose, Rose waved goodbye before she too was swallowed in flames.
Soon they came to some steps and climbed up, “This is Gryffindor Tower where you all will be for the next seven years of school.” The Headgirl spoke. They climbed up slowly, there was a lot of people going up the stairs and Harry was instantly afraid of tripping.
The snitch nearly at arms lengths finally darted away from Harrys reach and shot high into the sky, Harry followed with determination, flattening his body against the broom to gain speed and elevation. The snitch now closer than ever, Harry uncurled his right hand from the tight grip he had on the broom and outstretched for the snitch, his fingers straining as he desperaley tried to keep both speed and balance in order to catch the snitch within his grasp.
“What would the masters be needing?” The elf asked, she seemed slightly annoyed that her work was being interrupted, but she was too polite due to her job to say anything about it.
Harry didn’t really know what to say to this, he never thought that firstly, he was seen as someone that would be a bad friend to have and secondly, that Draco thoroughly confused him.
“Lately I’ve been wishing that I was in Gryffindor like you.” Draco said out of nowhere.
(See the end of the chapter for
Final after a breathes moment, he closed his hand against the cold smooth metal, the snitch fought for a few fluttering moments than became still against his sweaty palm. Elation spread throughout his cheeks as he broke out into a wide smile. He slowed down to an almost complete stop and let himself fall backawards towards the ground, almost freefalling, but in enough control to do a side menavour in order to right himself before he hit the ground.
Harry watched Hermione now, she was a bit rocky and clutching the broom far too tightly, but Harry could tell that she was slowly gaining confidence. Draco and most of the Slytherins kicked off smoothly as he and Ron had, the rest of the Gryffindor class were a bit shaky but other than that they were confident, Neville was still on the ground trying to get his broom to rise. Harry sighed and decided he would try to help. He got off his broom and went to Neville.
Harry desperately thought of a way that would help him out of this very tight situation, his only hope now would be to attempt to hold his own against the troll before the professors could find him. He could fell the troll thundering towards him, he could only hope that the troll would be stupid enough to run past him.
He smiled at both the boys and went back down to the common room. Hermione and Harry both worked together quietly, every now and then asking each other questions or reading what they had wrote to each other to fact check. Hermione retired first having finished her easy, Harry said goodnight and continued working on his essay with the warm glow of the fireplace the only thing lighting his paper.
"Sounds good to me." I kissed his forehead and slowly moved my lips down his face to his neck, I rubbed my tongue around the soft spot on his neck, he moaned and moved his neck to the side to accommodate me. I continued to suck on his neck and biting softly until he was left with a nice red mark I smiled at my work and gave it one last kiss before moving further down his body, my hands ran up his thighs, teasing him slowly.
Oh yes Harry had nearly forgotten that he was to meet Hagrid before breakfast began. "You should hurry if you don't want to be late." Minerva noted. Harry nodded his head. He placed the shrunken trunk onto the floor and returned it back to its normal size. Minerva watched and nodded her head before leaving the room to prepare for the upcoming sorting ceremony.
His pale freckled face lit up with a smile and Harry couldn’t help but do the same. Of course, Harry himself was excited for Hogwarts, he had been dreaming about attending it since Sirius began telling him stories about him and his Marauder days. However, there was still this spreading ache in his chest the further and further that he got from home, he didn’t know how he was going to last till Christmas to see his uncles.
Realisation struck Harry as Hermione spoke and he groaned, for he had forgotten momentarily about Sirius and Remus.
“I don’t know, didn’t really come to mind.” Ron shrugged, avoiding Hermione’s gaze.
“Okay class now mount your broom and after I give the command you are to kick off the ground, I only want there to be hovering, no going up past two metres!” She blew her whistle and everyone mounted their brooms.
"Harry!?" Draco exclaimed, Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, "Yeah I was hoping we could talk."
Draco nodded his head, “yeah I guess that makes sense.”
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, he nodded his head in agreement.
Harry bite his tongue and continued to follow.
“Oh, that’s cool, I never collected them but Ron loves them.”
Time for bed he thought.
On his way back home, Harry wondered whether or not he should call Sarah or if he should just let the number lay forgotten. However, he did not have much time to worry about that, as soon as he made it to his front door something felt incredibly wrong. The hair at the back of Harrys neck stood on end, Harrys wand instantly appeared in his hand. The first thing Harry noticed wrong was the wards that protected him home from intruders had been broken. Harry didn't know whether or not to enter his house or to call for backup. His wards were one of the most powerful wards that he could conjure, they were almost on par with the wards protecting Hogwarts.
“I went looking for the troll because I thought I could deal with it on my own – you know, because I’ve read all about them.”
“Well Harry perhaps this discussion is coming to a close.” Minerva gets up from her seat, advising Harry to do so. He gets up, thankful for this conversation to be ending.
"Harry, I love you. I love you with everything I have. We grew up with horrible influences, we grew up with… questionable family members-" Harry snorted, I glared at him. "But I want to have a family with you, I want to have your children, shit I'm scared too you know!" I catched my breathe, breathing in deeply to try and stop the tears that threatened to fall. Harry leaned forward and took my hands. "But I know that I'm not my father and you are not your uncle."
“Remus!” Sirius said startled. Remus groaned and opened his eyes.
After waiting for what seemed like hours but was only a mere thirty seconds he flung himself off the bed and into the living room. Harry was no-where to be seen. "Harry?" Draco called, panic started to unfurl in his stomach. The ruffling of papers and the thumping of drawers opening and closing rose from the study. Draco now in full blown panic mode accioed his wand to him with wandless magic.
“Oh, hey Draco.” Harry beamed, instantly feeling a bit better.
“Potter?!” Malfoy exclaimed, Harry removed his glasses and gently wiped the lens with the end of his robe.
“Okay.” Harry was left there to wait in the living room area as Draco called an elf for breakfast. Harry sat back down into the armchair to wait and he thought about the amazing night that they had, and the euphoria that he felt when he realised that Draco let down the protective spells around him. However, Harry’s mind turned on him as it always did. Thoughts that made his mood increasingly fall surrounded him.
I'm growing a baby inside me, a baby that is Harry and I's.
"We did it." I cried, letting the tears freely fall. Harry didn't say anything but grabbed the back of my neck and crash his lips against mine. The kiss tasted salty from my tears and soon from his.
Harry shook his head from his stupor, "Draco I've got to meet Hagrid is it okay to meet up later?" Draco nodded his head and stood aside for Harry. Harry smiled at him and rushed off, time was wearing thin.
"Harry…" I moaned.
“Yeah about this essay, im not really sure about this formula…” For the next ten minutes Draco sits next to Louise and helps him with the essay, even though he’s really not meant to, he can't help but help such a nice student. The great hall soon begins filling up and more food makes its way onto the tables. Draco says his goodbyes to Louise and heads to the teacher tables, somewhat relieved to see that Harry isn't there but at the same time confused at where he might be.
“We came on the boat together; we’re friends now so be nice.” Harry said, giving Ron a small glare to make sure that he would be polite.
Harry sighed in relief to be out of that some what suffocating classroom, he was so relieved by this fact that he hadn’t noticed the smirking blonde boy waiting outside of the classroom.
"I'm going into heat Harry!" He yelled. He turned to me and crashed his lips against mine, they moved hungrily against mine and I struggled to keep up with him. I quickly took off Dracos shirt and rubbed my hands down his chest, Dracos lips separated from mine and he let out a deep moan.
Harry nodded and gulped down his anxiety, Oliver motioned for him to mount and he quickly obeyed.
"Draco what you said to me the other night, you're right." He shrugged and looked away sheepishly. "I'm not my uncle, even though he raised me, I am my father's son and what I know of Dad, he was the most loving person to mum and to me."
"You know what I'm just gonna go, I'm sorry I had to tell you, but you know how us Griffindors can be." He smiled sheepishly and made for the door. Draco shot out his arm, stopping Harry. Harry looked to him shocked but wishful.
“Wandered?” Draco asked.
The lesson finally ended and Harry left the classroom as quickly as he could. Ron and Hermione quickly caught up with them and Ron once again bombarded him with questions.
It was Harry's decision. We saw the possibility, but his eyes shone sombre at the thought of it.
Harry sat down at his work desk in his room and tried to force himself to do some work, he had lessons to plan and homework to create. The bell rang for lunch and Harrys stomach grumbled in appreciation. Harry quickly packed up his things for next lesson so he would not need to come back to his room to get it, his room wasn’t exactly close to his classroom. Harry quickly rushed to the great hall, hoping that no one had sat next to Draco yet and he didn’t know if Draco was going to keep a seat for him.
Draco slept fitfully, constantly waking up in the middle of the night for reasons that he did not know. Draco woke again with the rising sun, deciding that he was sick of trying to get a rest and kicked off the blanket in a not so elegant way. Draco didn’t know how he was going to face Harry today, he still hadn’t properly figured out how he felt for him. “What am I  going to do?” He groans to himself.
“Um I’m not sure, in his dorms maybe.” Hermione said, her tongue sticking out of the corner of her mouth in concentration.
Draco cocked his head to the side, and Harry was immediately reminded of a puppy, however Draco’s face didn’t really hold that adorableness of a puppy, it was too pointy.
Harry looked down the corridor and saw nothing of the sort that would make the corridor out of bounds, however at end of the corridor there lay another door, Harry hurried towards it. Ron looked around a little anxiously, Harry wasn’t really sure what he could be so afraid of, surely there wasn’t anything that dangerous, this was a school after all.
Harry listened intently and the gratitude that he already felt towards Minerva quadrupled. The two soon had arrived at Harrys classroom. “You don’t have a class next?” Harry asked.
Harry tired out flopped onto the couch and picked up the book that Remus was reading, Remus opened his mouth to stop him but stopped himself. The book had nothing that he didn’t want Harry to be exposed to, it was after all just a simple potions book, so he continued on with his cooking.
"Where do you want to meet?" Harry accioed his robes and glasses to him and quickly placed them on over the day clothes that he forgot to take off.
“Professor.” Louise smiled back, Professor Malfoy  was definitely his favourite teacher.
Draco's heart stopped, for a moment he forgot to breathe and had to take a deep breathe. Was he dreaming, he had to be dreaming.
“Blimey Harry, you really are something aren’t you?” Ron chuckled, Harry tried to keep the blush at bay.
"Draco are you okay?" I took out my wand, ready to cast every healing charm that I knew.
Once they really became serious Harry and him, he found it very difficult to sleep without Harry by his side. Once after a really nasty fight, Harry decided to stay at Hermiones and Rons for a while, during the nights he could not sleep a wink. Harry stayed away for three nights, but to Draco it felt like an eternity.
“I was just about to get my books for class.” Harry said, hoping that he could avoid whatever McGonagall wanted him to do for the morning.
“Yeah come on that Transfiguration essay can be done later.”
Blaise asked the question that Draco anticipated for. "Draco how come you haven't packed any of your stuff?" He asked, almost innocently, but his tone told Draco that he knew the answer.
“Woah there, I wasn’t aware that this was yours!” Zabini held his ground still wearing that smug smirk.
“Yeah you left it on the field.” Harry handed him the ball.
“They’re just teasing you Ron.” Harry said, smiling. He liked the Weasley twins, they were always a good laugh to be around.
Yes i am well aware that this is just a shitty chapter about quidditch, but i just wanted to do this quick filler update to say that i havent forgotten about this fanfic and ill still be updating, although quite spontaneously...
“Oi Zabini that’s not yours!” Harry yelled crossing over to where Zabini was playing catch with the ball.
Harry contemplated, but he would have to think longer to find a way to convince his uncle to let him join the team.
“Okay class as I was saying, today we are just going to do some theory work for the levitating charm, then next lesson we can begin to do some practicing. Does anyone know what Latin is used for the levitating charm?” Professor Flitwick surveyed the room and smiled at Hermione who was the only one that had her hand up.
Draco stopped walking. “You think we are friends?”
“We had to go back to the tower to grab a quill I’d forgotten.” Ron quickly jumped in, barely saving Harrys neck.
Everyone split off to their respective dormitories, Harry and Ron waved goodbye to Hermione and hurried up the stairs with the other boys.
“This took a lot of persuading from Dumbledore you know, so I hope that you’ll accept the position.” McGonagall said.
“Sorry you must have been waiting pretty patiently.” Sirius chuckled and he put the glass down heading towards the shelf, “what book do you want kiddo?”
Harry started along to Snapes office when someone pumped shoulders with him, he turned and saw that it was Draco.
“Ye, I al’way want’d to be in Gryffin’or.” He said, spitting food. Hermione cringed a little bit but just shook her head with mild disgust.
Harrys eyes knitted together. “What do you mean?”
“Oh okay.” Draco stood too, his thoughts confuddling his mind that he didn’t even realise Harry had left until he heard the soft click of the door closing. Draco decided that he needed to somehow clear his mind, and the only way he knew how to do that was by making himself busy.
“His name is Professor Flitwick Ron.” Hermione rolled her eyes and linked her arm with Harry. “Come Harry we’ve got to get out books for this morning lesson, and with that she started to drag Harry along, Ron quickly followed pursuit.
Everyone nodded.
"Master." Kreacher poked Harry.
"Draco I… I think I fancy you."
“See Hermione, ill be fine.” Harry spoke.
Draco smiled back with his eyes soft, “thank you.”
“Too hard for you was it Weasley?” The black-haired boy that Draco was sitting with snickered.
“Remus always told me to be kind to others, and I think he’s just trying to impress me that’s why he was so rude.”
“Sorry Hermione.”
“Oh…”
“It’s going to so quiet without him.”
“Sirius could you get me one of the muggle books please?” Harry spoke, standing patiently by the bookshelf.
Draco cleared his throat. "Yes well, I wanted everyone here to know that I am not what I used to be, I try to be a kind and understanding professor where possible." Draco kept his head forward, Harry thought this understanding of Draco, knowing how hard it would've been for him when he first started and the lack of respect that he got from his students.
Harry moaned deeply into Draco's mouth, he had not kissed someone like this before, not felt the euphoria of emotions in his stomach, the ache of wanting more. He grabbed the back of Draco's neck with one hand and the small of his back with the other and pulled him flush against his body, they pulled apart to breathe for air, Harry laid a kiss on Draco's forehead before laying his own on it.
That night of Halloween a flash of greenlight spread through the deafening darkness of Godric’s Hollow and an echoing inhumane scream spread through the fog. A baby was left crying until his throat went raw. Then, two rough, yet gentle hands picked him up.
Soon more and more people were finishing their food and the tables were becoming emptier. Two students wearing Head Boy and Head Girl badges stood up and got the first years attentions.
"Okay well good, and here." She handed him a small present.
Draco nodded his head somewhat politely, “yeah I’ll have some tea.”
Draco looked up and spotted Harry sitting down next to Ron, he smiled and got from his seat quickly rushing over to him before Snape noticed.
“I wish he was more exciting; I was so excited to learn about DADA.” Hermione sighed, then they all sighed in unison. With the mood so low they kept walking to the Gryffindor tower in a sombre silence. Harry was about to say something when Draco unexpectantly stood in front of him.
“Oi wait up, we don’t need our books we’ve got Herbology first up don’t we?” Ron said, feeling slightly output.
I sighed and rubbed my palms over my face. "No, I don't think that you are incompetent without me, its just were partners and I can't just leave you like that."
“Hmmf yeah just… help me to the nurses wing.” Harry groaned, Hermione nodded and helped Harry get up, Harry was suddenly very thankful for magic or he would have no clue how to get the blood off his only pair of robes.
"Welcome home love." My chest somehow felt lighter now that Harry was home. He always brought this irreplaceable sense of calm to me.
Rosmerta cackled, startling Draco. “He finally did it did he?” Her eyes are full of delight and Draco can't help but be puzzled.
“But Uncle Remus said it’s bad to lie.” Harry said, a mouth already full of eggs.
“And you two, five points each for even though you were very lucky to have taken down a mountain troll, not many first years could have done so, now off you two go as well.”
“Come in.” Harry dramatically extended out his arm to allow Draco passage into his room, Draco gave him a ghost of a smile and stepped in. He seemed nervous.
However, now there was no impending doom, or great expectations upon him, this was his moment to grab love by the balls and take it. Draco than thought that he really didn't mind the idea of a relationship with Harry. Yes their was the public eye that would disagree greatly, and the great clash of their personalities could become something that ruins the relationship.
Sirius surrendering himself to a night of no sleep slowly slid out of the bed, maybe he would do some work to make the hours go by.
“Is your uncle a teacher?” Hermione asked, now more excited to be on the topic of learning and education.
“Wow.” Ron said, finally looking up to him in surprise.
"Uhh yeah." I nodded my head.
He pecked me on the lips and moved towards the kitchen. "I'm starving!" He moaned and sat down at one of the kitchen stools.
Harry thought for a moment and began to describe what he saw outside of the Gryffindor common room. Draco nodded his head as he listened. “Well after the war, Slytherins reputations went down the drain, mainly due to the reason that most Slytherins parents were death eaters and well…” Draco didn’t need to continue, Harry knew what it would have been like for the Slytherins. Draco smiled fondly however. “Minerva though worked really hard to create house unity, houses are still a little bit hostile towards Slytherin but for the most part it’s a lot better than it used to be when we were in school, and after the war.”
“Knew you had it in you!” Harry said giving her a high five.
“For scaring the absolute life out of me.”
Harry chuckled, “I’ll be fine go.”
"Oh." Was all that managed to leave my mouth. Draco ducked his head at passerby's and made way for the first store, a baby clothing store. "Draco you know we could have done this with muggle shops." I whispered, now suddenly self-consciousness myself. Draco had shopped here once, to get a gift for Hermione's first baby shower, someone from the Daily Prophet had unfortunately seen him and immediately assumed he was shopping for himself, goodness the papers had taken a field trip that day. I still held onto Dracos hand as we stepped into the store.
“It was alright, I had mother send me my silk sheets from home, I am not going to below myself by sleeping on those cotton abominations.” Draco sniffed, carefully plopping a spoon of cereal into his mouth.
"Draco…" His tone warned me, but I continued forward, preparing to fight with him.
“Yeah, he said I could start reading them now that I’m nearly eleven.” Harry spoke, he shuffled around in the bean bag until he was content with the position he found. Sirius finally found the book and took it out, he opened it briefly and was a little surprised to find how complex it looked.
And soon the classroom became an obstacle course, with Harry laughing manically chasing after Ron and Ron laughing at Harry for not being able to catch him, soon Harry managed to catch the end of Ron’s robe and the two boys fell onto the floor in fits of laughter. Hermione came to survey the situation, seeing that no one was hurt she relaxed and a large smile grew on her face.
Harry goes to reply but she stops him. “I know that you are romantically interested in Draco Malfoy.” She says, her eyes twinkling in amusement.
Harry and Ron bustled along with other first years as a gigantic man by the name of Hagrid lead them along, Harry looked at Hagrid with mild appreciation, if he was any smaller trying to round the first years along would be a nightmare.
He sat up from his seat by the fire and knelt by Harry, whose mumbling started to make more sense. "No stop, no please…" Draco's heart squeezed.
“Oh, hello Draco.” Harry said surprised.
"What if it doesn't work." He softly spoke, I grabbed both his cheeks with my hand and forced him to look at me.
Harry took a deep breathe, looked to his broom with a firm determination for it to rise into his hand then said with a clear and solid voice. “Rise up!” The broom instantly shot into his hand.
By the end of the lesson Harry felt that his head was going to explode from the amount of attention that he had to pay to Snape to make sure that he got all the information he needed, Snape apparently only liked to use the chalkboard to write students names on and the assigned homework.
Harry makes his way back to his room, his mind running with thoughts about Draco. He really didn't know what he was going to do about the situation. He wasn't sure about Draco's feelings because he hadn’t told him anything. Harry reprimands himself, as it was also Harry’s fault that Draco hadn’t told him anything. Harry had been avoiding him all day.
“Yeah we did it Hermione!” They both laughed and continued eating, Ron just looked at both of them quizzically but made no comment.
“Don’t worry Harry im sure you will do fine.” Oliver smiled, noticing the shift in Harrys expression as he eyed the snitch.
“Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.” The girl said, plopping herself down next to Harry. Ron looked at her, slightly taken aback.
Harrys breathe hitched and his heartbeat quickened. His instincts screamed that whatever was coming towards him was no friend of his. But being the curios and mischievous eleven-year-old he was Harry had to peak around the corner and see who exactly was causing such great trembles through the ground.
Draco's eyes widened. "You took the week off?" He repeated, his voice risen in shock. "But you're in the middle of a case and you took the week off?!"
“But you couldn’t and I know that Draco.” Harry replied, his heart aching for Draco. Harry knew the guilt that Draco was harbouring and Harry, for the first time in his life felt like someone would understand the pain and guilt that he too felt.
Draco quickly looked to Ron who was giving him a scowl and his smile dropped, instantly Harry could see that wall rise up and Harry wanted desperately to take it down.
“I haven’t laughed like that in ages.” Draco said, still smiling.
“Um no.” Harry said, he vaguely remembered Ron speaking to a boy about a toad, but he was nearly asleep by then.
Harry glared at him and punched him in the shoulder, Draco recoiled. “Ouch what was that for?” He whined, rubbing his arm.
Harry crashed into his room, shrugging off his shirt and shaking on a new one that he picked off the floor, casting a cleaning charm would do enough to clean it. He quickly pulled on his robes that he also cast a cleaning charm on, wandlessly making everything go into his bag, his grabbed the bag that zoomed towards him once packed and he rushed out the door. This time remembering to close it.
Harry prepared the classroom for the practical that he would be doing with his sixth year class, whilst Draco prepared for practical potion lesson that he would be doing with his third year class.
“Come Mione, you’ll be fine.” Ron smiled at her, giving her a reassuring smile.
“So, Harry you know any magic then?”
Harry took a step forward and held Draco's hands. Draco looked up into Harrys eyes, scared at what he would see. Would he see Harry agreeing with him? Would Harry too be admitting defeat or realising how terrible an idea their relationship would be.
“Oh.” Harry should know this elf would not be Dobby, Dobby is dead.
“I heard from my brothers that Professor Snape always favours the Slytherins over other houses.”
“Even though Draco is my friend now, he’s never gonna replace you, who am I going to talk about quidditch with or get absolutely murdered in Chess or sneak around pulling pranks? Cause I can’t do all of that with Draco, he’s too… Draco.”
Hooch wandered over to him.
The multiple cracks of wizards arriving alerted both the men, Remus instantly had his wand pointing at the door, Sirius stepped slightly behind Remus and hugged Harry closer to his body. The thundering steps of multiple wizards storming up the stairs caused both men to hold their breathes in anticipation. Remus could hear both their hearts racing against their chests, he was however constantly aware of Harry, who had the calm heartbeat of a sleeping baby.
They both stared at each, thinking about the kiss and soon their lips found each other again.
Harry once again nodded his head with understanding, he was beginning to think that perhaps something happened to his tongue or his brain rather because he couldn’t think of a single thing to say to Snape.
Harry nodded and took the potion, he looked at it cautiously but with an encouraging nod from Pomfrey he downed the bottle in one swallow. Harry coughed, the potion was immensely bitter and very thick, he was glad that he had taken it quickly.
Harry was not that surprised by the news, it was difficult to explain to Harry the new dynamic to the relationship, but Harry just shrugged and had said in his little toddler voice.
“Ron quick drop the club on his head.”
“You knew about it already didn’t you!?” Harry asked offended.
Draco stood there in shock. Had Harry just kissed him on the cheek, had his lips touched his cheek? Draco touched the kissed spot with the tips of his fingertips softly and his heart palpated, his stomach clenched. Why was he feeling this way about a simple kiss on the cheek? Its a normal thing for couples to do when they leave the house, but Harry and him aren;t a couple, did Harry perhaps mistake him for Ginny, was his thoughts stuck on Ginny and that’s why he was so lost in his mind?
Draco this time turned to him, and Harry couldn’t stop looking into those captivating grey eyes. “What do you mean by that Harry?”
Draco chuckled softly, too quietly for Harry to hear and ate his own in a more graceful manner. Harry was the first to finish and eyed the leftovers eagerly, however Draco knew he was holding back to be polite. “Feel free to have more, I don’t really have a fridge to store the leftovers.” Harry blushed lightly and plated himself some more pie. Draco watched on proudly, he felt like a mother that had finally gotten her fussy child to eat something other than packet noodles and candy.
"I kinda feel a but coming along." He mumbled, watching Dracos face closely. Draco smiled more brightly.
"Umm yeah you can come in." Draco moved against the door to let Harry through. Harry gave him a small smile and stepped in. "You can sit on my bed." Harry looked around and guessed it would be the one by the window. Draco watched intently as Harry made to his bed and sat down. Harry sitting so casually on his bed was a sight that he thought he would never see.
“Quick this way!” Draco took Harrys elbow and pulled him into a classroom that was thankfully unlocked, Draco not looking where he was aiming his wand accidentally shoved the basket into Harrys face trying to get into the door. They had no time to close the door so they both stood behind it, Harrys back against Dracos chest, both holding their breathes and hoping that whoever was walking by wouldn’t investigate the room.
“No bother, ill write you a late note, come.”
“Well that’s siblings I suppose.” Hermione joked.
Both Oliver and McGonagall held proud smiles on their faces as Harry presented them with the snitch.
Madam Hooch returned and instructed the class to pack up, so they did and Harry made way to the medical wing to return the ball to Neville. He climbed up the stairs alone feeling exhilarated still from the flying that he had done, he remembered back to the first time that he had flown and the broken arm that had occurred, thankfully by that time Rons mother Mrs Weasley was excellent at healing broken bones and mended his arm within the moment.
“Harry do you really think my father would let me attend school without having a proper understanding of the most basic of charms?” Draco said looking at him with a are you stupid expression on his face.
“You want anything? Tea, coffee?” Harry offered.
"You don't know how much I needed to hear that." Draco croaked.
“Yeah i guess you could say that.” He smiled, hoping that there was no blush colouring his cheeks. Harry smiled back and sat down in an armchair adjacent from Dracos. Draco picked up his legs and curled further into the armchair, somehow wishing that he was curling into something warmer. “Draco i really like it here.” Harry spoke, his voice soft and hesitant.
He searched the field, his eyes darting and tracing for any sort of gleam or golden colour, finally what felt like hours he finally noticed a golden gleam reflect from the corner of his eye, Harry quickly swivelled in the direction of the snitch, hovering by the goal posts. He shot straight towards it, for he knew how fast those little shiny balls could be, and he would have to use the art of surprise to have any advantage on the tiny snitch.
“I suppose we are.” He said nodding. Harry felt the instant rush of relief. Then laughed, trying to change the mood to something lighter.
"How about a cup of tea?" I asked her, she nodded her head and patiently sat down on the couch, I made way to the kitchen and started the kettle, my hands shook as I took two mugs out of the cupboard. Thoughts continued to run through my mind. What if it didn't work? What if… What if… The kettle finished its boil, taking me out of my cage of thoughts. I poured the boiling water into the cups and dunked the tea bags in, plopping in a teaspoon of sugar into each cup. I made way to Hermione and placed a cup in front of her.
“You don’t have to be nervous around them Draco, they already know we’re friends.”
I grasped Harry's hand.
“Go put on one of the aprons and I want you to first start by taking each shelf of jars down and cleaning them, sit at that table over there there’s already a cloth and water, you can go back to your dorm once you’ve cleaned a shelf of jars.”
"Please!" She whispered, I let a small chuckle leave my lips and I picked up the plate to extend to her, she picked the biggest cookie and instantly took a bite out of it, crumbs sprinkling her white dress.
Harry hurried to his next class, and the day went by in a whirlwind, his head was still stuck on that quidditch field, chasing for that snitch and he was quite ready to leave yet.
He smiled nervously and nodded his head.
“Come on Professor you should know by now that the whole school is practically begging for you two to hook up already.” Rebecca answered, rolling her eyes as if bored, however they shone with bright excitement.
Even though Snape was still being quite hostile to him, Harry noted that there seemed to be less hatred in his voice when he spoke to Harry. This made Harry feel a bit better and he hoped that just meant he and Snape had started off on the wrong foot. He gave a small timid smile to Snape before quickly shuffling out of the classroom.
Harry seemed to notice a hesitation as the ink blotted more than it had for the rest of the letter
“Technically five after the points she takes from me.” Hermione noted.
"Harry?" Draco called softly. Harry looked up and swung the chair around to face Draco. A small box lay in his lap and a trickle of tears streamed down his face. "Harry what's wrong!?" Draco exclaimed rushing to be closer and went down on his knees to be eye level with him.
Draco watched as Harry left, his shoulders slumped but his face unusually void of any emotion, even his, unallowing Draco to know what Harry was truly feeling. “What’s wrong with him?” Flitwick asks whispering as not to alert others.
Draco cleared his throat. “Who is it?” The handle turned and Neville poked his head around the door. “Draco, I was just wondering if I could… Oh hi Harry!” Neville beamed. Harry fixed his face and smiled at Neville. “Hey Neville.” Neville looked from Harry to Draco.
Harry could confess that he was starting to have a crush on Draco and that he found him sexually attractive. Draco could take this three ways. One, he could reject Harry and pretend that nothing ever happened. Two, he could reject Harry and not want to be friends with him anymore. Three, he could accept Harry and then they have a hot make out session that could turn into much more. Harry shook his head, it was not the right time to have some sexy day-dreams of Draco right now.
“Come on Harry its about to leave!” Ron called out, waving to Harry to hurry up.
Draco drew in a breathe. His heart pounds against his chest, a shiver ran down his spine. “Come.” Is all he said to Harry as he goes back to his room, leaving the door open to allow Harry through. He slowly clicks the door shut, his hand shaking against the door knob in nervousness for what he is about to do.
Draco wrapped his thin arms around Harrys torso, Draco didn't know how one person could make him feel so warm and… Complete. Harrys strong build encompassed him, for the first time in a long while Draco felt content, he felt safe.
“If everyone could take their seats please.”
"You think?" I asked.
Harry knew little bits about the war, Remus had allowed him to read small things about the war and once or twice Sirius would tell him a few stories about it. But mostly everyone liked to avoid the topic of the war, it wasn’t a time of great happiness and the war had ended at the sacrifice of his parents and many others.
Relationships were never his top priority.
“Aight First Years, lets line up, Professor McGonagall will be ‘er in a moment to organise the lot of yer!”
Hermione hung her head, Snape looked to Harry with a piercing look, he too looked to the floor.
"Did I have another one?" He yawned, stretching his arms high in the air.
“Oh, just some light reading I was going to do but then I saw you.” She said offhandedly.
"I know."
“I’m not ashamed by it!” Harry defends himself. Because it’s true, he really isn’t ashamed of his feelings for Draco he’s more ashamed that he couldn’t keep his feelings under wraps.
Draco sighed and stopped rubbing his abdomen. "Yes, I think it's over now." I let out a breath of relief and sat down next to him. I touched Dracos hand and was shocked to find that as soon as I touched him he moaned.
Harry opened his mouth to say something but Draco doesn’t allow him to say anything due to lips being crashed against his own. Their tongues touch fleetingly and their teeth crash against each other before Draco is pulling away, his eyes deepened with lust but also wide with surprise.
"I didn't have a nightmare Harry." My heart races, my mind is screaming at me not to tell him, but my heart is cursing back that I should. Harrys thick eyebrows furrow, he looks at me confused. "Then what did you dream about that made you cry like that?"
“I jumped down the stairs and tripped.” Harry said bashfully scratching the back of his neck.
There was a Professor with long greasy hair and a large nose, Harry instantly identified him as Professor Snape who he had also heard about from Sirius and Remus. Snape went to school with Sirius and Remus, Sirius always had a scowl on his face whenever the mentioning of Snape popped up in conversation, Remus had to remind Harry that he had to show respect for Snape, after all he would be Harry’s Professor. Harry moved his eyes over to a weird looking man with a large turban wrapped around his head. The Professor who he did not know seemed to feel eyes on him and looked to Harry, Harry instantly felt pain flare up in the spot where his scar was, he looked away and hissed.
The last week of school passed by fairly quickly. Draco mostly lived through it by ignoring Harry in every way possible and leaching himself onto Blaise and Pansy. Harry lived through the week puzzled and feeling slightly upset by Draco's behaviour.
“Uhh yes.” Harry spoke. Embarrassment beginning to rise to his cheeks
Harry stood frozen, he had no idea what to do, he could quickly turn back and try to escape that way, but something told him that although the troll looked immensely dumb, it would most definitely hear and run after him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Did this one had a previous owner?" I asked curiously.
"Draco have you seen my tie?" Harry scrambled through the mess on the floor, he knew he would get yelled at by Draco later for such a mess, but he was too stressed looking for this stupid tie! Draco stomped into the room, he sighed and made his way for the closet, yanked it out of the rack that he so kindly placed it in and threw it at Harry.
“You Canons?” Seamus asked.
His size always shocked me, always. I don't think there will ever come a day where I am not shocked by his size. I groaned and shifted my weight slightly, with my senses coming back slightly I quickly realised how constricting my pants were becoming.
Hermione seeming to notice Harrys uncomfortableness and she changed the topic, to Harrys utter gratefulness.
“You’ll see.”
“Did you know that you two are absolutely brilliant!” Harry yelled in relief.
“Hmm is Uncle Remus awake?” Harry asked, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
Her cheeks splotted pink and she nodded her head. "Rose say please." Her mother chastised.
Harry turned and was shocked once again to see Draco beaming at him.
Draco blushed and slipped onto his right-hand ring finger. "I was playing with it and forgot to put it back on." Harry breathed out a breath of relief. "Oh okay, jeez you scared me!"
Harry nodded, the only other family he had known was the Weasleys, and they were pretty much his cousins.
“Hey.” Harry breathes out, he tried to make it so that he didn't sound anxious, however his heart pounding told him the opposite.
"Don't you dare think about it." Draco growled, and he quickly dragged me away from the store.
"Harry it's nearly time."
“I hope its as cool on the inside as all the books say it is.” Hermione spoke, her excitement increasing at the talk of books.
"Draco." Harry breathed. He took a small hazardous step towards him, Draco too stunned to take one back. "My patience is wearing thin." He leaned forward to whisper in Draco's ear, he had to use all his will power to repress the smile knowing the shiver that Draco responded with was caused by him.
Hermione instantly took out her books and shut out the two boys, she was in what Harry and Ron had dubbed “learning mode” and no one could interrupt Hermione Granger when she turned that mode on. The Professor, who indeed was a ghost, floated around the front of the classroom and began droning on about things that Harry instantly found boring.
"I hope you had a good time Harry." Hermione gave him a tight tug, and Ron came up and clapped him on the back.
“Sorry got l…lost in some thoughts that’s all.”
"Morning."
The whole class was already there and Harry was surprised to see that they were sharing the lessons with Slytherin, Draco smiled at with a small smile which Harry returned.
What Harry had said hung in there, for there was something left unsaid that they both understood.
“Your brothers seemed kinda mean.” Hermione said, walking alongside Harry. Harry cringed internally; Ron always got touchy with people if they said anything bad about his siblings.
All he could think about was Harry.
“Oh, well we’re here anyway.” Draco shrugged, he waved a casual goodbye and hurried to his table. Harry watched on, he felt bad but he was too occupied with other things to think too much about it.
Harry didn't know how to reply. "Oh, um sure." He scratched the back of his head and took the number. She giggled and turned away rushing back to the safety of her co-worker. Harry looked down to the note and in a cute scribble she had written.
The food quickly appeared with his words and Harry looked amazingly at all the food on the table. In his excitement he completely piled his plate with food and instantly dug in. The food was amazing but a sudden pang in his chest reminded him that this food would never be as good as Remus’s home cooking.
The rest of the walk was silent, and Draco smiled a goodbye to Harry as he went to go sit at his table, Harry sat next Hermione who was next to Ron, Ron was stuffing his face as usual which was a good sign.
“Yeah I guess we are.” Draco smiled. Harrys heart raced; Draco’s face completely transformed when he smiled. Suddenly, he went from a too pointy and sharp face to a soft and gentle boy. Harrys breathe caught in his throat and he had to look away before he was caught staring too long.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy." Harry began, never ceasing from looking into Dracos eyes. "I love you with everything that I have. You are my everything and always will be. Even after your temper tantrums, or after we fight, even after the lies we tell I will always love you. Draco I cannot see my future without you, this ring, as soon as I saw it I knew it screamed you." He chuckled. Draco hadn't realised he had tears streaming down his face too.
“I don’t really know, I’m not going to pick him over you or you over him, he’s just going to have to deal with that I’m friends with you now.” Harry said shrugging, cause really that’s just how it was going to have to be, Ron would have to hike up his big boy pants and get over it.
“Just do it!” Harry yelled. Ron confused flicked his quickly away from the club, ending the spell. The club now following the laws of physics fell, smashing onto the trolls head with a great, plonk! The troll roared, but it quickly stopped, swayed slightly and started to fall face first, Harry Ron and Hermione quickly ran out of the way or they were to be squished.
“Remus said I should be able to handle it.” Harry shrugged.
Harry pulled away, leaving a hot imprint of his lips against Dracos. Draco not knowing what came over him grabbed the front of Harry's shirt and pulled him forward to once again put their lips together. This time Draco less stunned began to move his lips against Harry, Harry did the same but to Dracos annoyance did not open them. He growled, which he didn't even know he could do and bit lightly on Harrys bottom lip, this caused the reaction he needed and plunged his tongue into Harrys mouth. Draco's tongue hungrily took in Harrys mouth and explored it with a determination to find every treasure there, Harrys tongue did the same.
“And Uncle Remus also said that it’s bad to talk with your mouth full.” Sirius playfully retorted.
Harry giggled, “Moony will yell at you if you swear like that.”
Then a scream echoed around the field and everyone stop, Neville was crouched on the ground clasping his arm.
He opened his eyes, the sudden change in atmosphere making my heart jump into my throat.
“Harry mate you were yelling in your sleep.” Dean spoke, giving him a puzzling look.
His brows knitted with puzzlement, Blaise being his roommate had no need to knock, maybe it was Pansy coming to say sorry. He shrugged his shoulders and jumped out of the warm covers to open the door. He had to quickly close his mouth to stop the gasp that would've escaped.
“Next you are to tell your broom to rise up, you must be able to get the broom into your hand before you can even think about riding it.” Madam Hooch shouted her instruction and then blew her whistle.
Standing outside of his door was Harry Potter.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded. He didn’t really know how to talk to girls, and Hermione especially. There was Ginny at the Weasleys, but she was always too nervous around him so he could never hold a proper conversation with her.
Ron swallowed his food. “Oh yeah, we’ve known each other since we were like two! His uncles and my parents fought in the war together.” Ron said, proudly puffing out his chest slightly.
"I'm sure you'll feel more comfortable soon enough." Draco voiced, his eyes suddenly seeming distant. "It took me a long time to go up to the astronomy tower." Draco quietly said. Harrys stomach gave a sudden lurch.
“Going to lunch little shit.” Fred snickered, he rubbed his brothers hair and began to walk away, George giving him a soft punch on the arm in passing.
Draco swallowed, his adam's apple bobbing smoothly up and down, drawing Harrys eyes away from his face. "Wh…" He took a deep breathe. Come on Draco you can do this for Merlins sake! He yelled at himself.
“Yeah but Remus has always been adamant on giving me the most normal life tha the can, and this is really classified as normal.” Harry said now feeling slightly deflated.
Ginny was sitting in one of the armchairs, a glass of champagne cradled in her hand. He sat down in the chair next to hers. "Hey Ginny, how are you?" He asked, putting a soft smile on his face. "I'm pretty good, and congratulations." She smiled back.
“No well I am of course, but the Slytherins are quite cold to each other sometimes and its just so different seeing you Gryffindors being all warm and close, it makes me want something like that too.” Draco said, choosing his words carefully.
"Harry!" Ron half yelled, I zoned back in and shook my head to focus on Ron.
Harry packed his bag as the bell rang, the class left leaving the door wide open. Harry sighed, what a weird lesson. His head buzzed, was the whole school really wanting Draco and him to get together? Did he want to be with Draco like that?
The night wasted away with lips feverishly dancing together, and bodies not willing to let go of the warmth that they created. Draco had never remembered a night feeling so content and so happy in a long time.
JessicaLuci :)
“I’d never say no that.” Harry smiled, Draco then started hurrying towards the stairs, they both scurried downstairs, narrowly missing a Hufflepuff prefect going to class. They both giggled as the prefect walked into her classroom, Harry felt like he was high on sugar.
"I think he wants a name." Said the shop owner, tears welling in his eyes. I thought for a couple of moments then it hit me.
Harry waited for the tap on his door, for some reason Draco and he had decided that they talk in his room instead of Dracos, mainly because his room was being closely watched more than Harrys. Harry tried to sit and to calm down his racing heart, Merlin where had his Auror training gone? Had he not been trained to remain calm in stressful situations like these? Turns out Auror training is pretty useless when it comes to confessions.
Pansy snickered. "See this is the perfect opportunity for you." Draco turned to her and glared at her with his Malfoy glare. She smirked at him with those plump lips of hers before Draco admitted defeat. "I'm going to my room." He grumbled before stomping up the stairs, he faintly heard Harry ask them what his problem was, his answer was a giggle from Pansy before she too scampered up the stairs.
Hermione childishly stuck her tongue out at him before quickly standing up. “Right since Harry came back alive and I got absolutely murdered in chess, I’m going to bed.”
They both started to tuck into the picnic basket, they were too hungry to continue talking so they just continued to eat with laughter echoing in their minds and cheeks aching.
“Wasn’t half bad actually, we didn’t say a single word to each other after he told me what to do, and before I was finished.”
Harry felt slightly lighter once they finally got the other side of the shore, the castle was even bigger up close, and Harry was starting to feel overwhelmed. Harry being the gentleman he was raised to be took Hermione’s hand and helped her out of the boat, she blushed lightly and murmured a thank you.
Draco smirked. “You weren’t listening at all, were you?”
“I don’t mind sharing my Gryffindorness with you Draco.” Harry said smiling brightly.
“No, its just…” Malfoy didn’t know how to finish what he was going to say.
“How can you do that? We haven’t learnt how to do the practical yet in Charms!” Harry said amazed.
“Im sure that it will turn out, surely theres something that you can do to convince him to let you join.”
“What do you mean?” Neville said confused.
Harry closed his eyes and thought about what Draco had said, once he could think about it, he nodded, his smell smelt really nice.
Sirius pressed a little harder into Remus’s back. “Do I?”
The medical wings door was already open and Harry slowly stepped in, there was Neville with a frown on his face and a fixed arm, a petite woman turned around and smiled at Harry.
"Sorry Harry I warned Ron that you might get freaked out cause we had to break your wards but he said it would be fine." Hermione punched Ron in the arm. "You freaked him out Ron!" She yelled at him.
“Well you know this morning when you were like absent...” Draco pointed to his head to finish his sentence. It took Harry a moment to realise what exactly Draco was talking about.
“Mr Potter, I was sitting in my office two weeks ago, grading some papers, when you came flying towards my window at such a speed that I was sure you would crash straight through it. But before I could even utter a spell to stop you, you did a magnificent spin and caught Mr Longbottom’s Remember ball. Instantly I was reminded of your fathers skill and since our own Seeker has now graduated, I thought that you would be the perfect candidate.”
My eyes open to find I am no longer sleeping cuddled against Harry, but a child perhaps at the age of two or three is wedged between us. The child is turned away from me, but his hair reminds me very much of Harrys, midnight black and unruly.
“No excuse aye? Just thought that simply being Harry Potter would let you get away with breaking the rules… well unfortunately for you Mr Potter I do not care who you or who your parents are, you are just a snotty little brat to me.” Snape sneered and Harry slightly recoiled. He had never heard anyone hold so much revulsion for him before, it was jarring.
“What we do?” Harry looked up, he looked down to his watch surprised by the time.
Draco dragged me through the aisles and seemed to forget who he was, he was completely drowned in the world of babies and shopping for babies. Soon I had a pile of clothes up to my eyes waiting to fall. Draco looked at me and the pile sheepishly.
“But I heard that you’re one of the only Aurors who can do it.” Draco smirked at him.
“A quill?” Hermione looked confused and not very convinced, “why didn’t you just borrow one off me?”
“I always knew Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus loved each other, so its okay to show me that you love each other.”
“Doesn’t sound so bad then, better than what Fred and George got stuck with.”
“Sorry I’m a bit late today class.” Harry huffed, he banged his bag on his deck and unpacked it. The hufflepuff girls in the front row giggled into the text books. Harry stopped and eyed the leader of the pack, Rebecca Lostring
Dumbledore who he only ever met once before when he was a toddler stood to the owl lectern where he raised his hand to quiet down those hurriedly murmuring. Harry watched as Dumbledore gave his speech, the man spoke with a calm yet bewitching manner, everyone was engrossed in what he was saying. Eventually he finished, a small twinkle in his eye as he gave a once over the first years, his eyes stopped for a little moment as he caught Harrys eye.
“Uhh this is interesting.” The hat spoke, he nearly flinched, he had not expected for the hat to speak to him.
“I’m Ron Weasley.” Ron muttered, finally having processed what Hermione had said.
"Harry, I know you don't want kids and I know that you don't want to talk about it, but please let's talk about it!" I begged my voice getting louder towards the end.
“Well think about gardening, how happy it makes you feel then call for the broom.” Harry said, he wasn’t really sure if it would work, but it was worth a shot.
Harry now greatly nervous and slightly embarrassed forgot to step forward.
Harry felt like strolling through the halls of the quiet and cold castle, something nostalgic was bubbling in the pit of his stomach, a walk felt in order.
“Miss Granger!”
“I suspect that you know already.” Harry said cheekily. Draco looked away feigning innocence.
Those who saw rushed to his side, Hermione was there first.
“Yeah maybe a bit too much.” He grumbled. Sirius chuckled again and plopped next to Remus, rubbing his hand into the small of his back.
“What’s wrong, what is it?” Harry rushed, his wand already in his hand.
“It was okay, he just made me clean the jars in the supply cupboard, he said for the rest of the two weeks I’m to help him with cleaning it.”
"Yes?" I called back making my way to the bedroom.
The way that Harry smiled, how the lines in his face etched by years of stress and anxiety made him look more mature and handsome. The way that Harry’s green eyes easily reflected the way that he was feeling, no matter how much he tried hiding it. How Harry used that stupid Gryfindor bravery to protect those around him.
“What does it smell like, the kitchen smells different to everyone.”
Draco waited with his wand in his hand, hearing footsteps pass his door he quickly murmured, “point me to Harry Potter.”
I took his hand fully this time, Draco hips arched upwards, his breaths coming in and out in fast succession.
Harry awoke with a weight on his chest. He didn't know how to get rid of it and decided that a shower was his best bet. Harry put his Auror training to good use by clearing his mind of all thoughts and simply followed the task of showering. If he started to think about Draco he knew that he would not be able to stop worrying. Harry dried and dressed himself in his usual attire, however being more careful with the way his hair was placed and how straight his tie was.
“Ron calm down, no need to take it so far, there’s nothing wrong with Slytherins.”
By the time he was finished with the first shelf his fingers ached and his back was sore, when checking his watch, it was already ten at night. Snape had been in and out of the classroom, they never spoke a word to each other. Snape had come to his desk once to ensure he was cleaning the jars properly, seemingly satisfied he walked away without saying a thing.
“Thank you, Biffy.” Draco said. Harry was a little shocked to find that Draco knew the elf’s name, he kicked himself for thinking that Draco was completely heartless to others below himself, of course he wasn’t a horrible person and Harry should’ve known otherwise.
Remus circled around the kitchen, listening intently to Harrys questions and preparing the lunch. He still felt a bit stiff in places from last night but other than that his mood was stable and his fever no longer.
“I have no idea.” Harry said, kneeling over hands on his knees. That was one of the most terrifying things he had ever experienced in his eleven years of life, however his curiosity was still greatly peaked.
A voice in his head said just go for it, Harry smirked, yeah why not just go over and say hi to Malfoy?
Harry sighed as he brushed his fingertips against the smooth stone of the castle walls, hundreds of years of students doing the same had weathered down the stone, very tiny valleys had even appeared, grooves that fit his fingertips just right.
Harry and Draco did not talk a lot, the most they talked was when Harry returned his wand to him with a blush splotching his face, even when he defended him at his trial they barely talked. Now they had come to a somewhat truce between each other, and not long ago they had begun using their first names to call each other. However, the usual banter and snide remarks still continued, though not as crude and harmful as before.
Harry didn't bother with unpacking and rushed out to try and make it to Hagrid in time. He was in such a hurry that he didn't notice the man so absorbed into a book, their shoulders crashed into each other and the book toppled to the floor. "Im sorry!" Harry rushed and he quickly scooped up the book from the floor and handed it to the person who he had run into. Then he realised who that person was.
“You’re not going to get into some sort of big fight over me, are you?” Draco said laughing.
Harry changed his direction and started towards the great hall, but when he was about to turn the corridor a great thud vibrated through the floor. Harry stopped. At first, he thought perhaps an earthquake had travelled through the castle, but then the thud happened again and again, this time a lot louder and closer to wear Harry was.
"Positively sure."
"I'm doing the dishes." He wrapped his arms tighter across my stomach, "then stop washing them."
“You want me to catch a snitch, right now?”
“I’ll be back in a minute I guess.” Harry gave them a reassuring smile before following the direction that Draco had already started walking away in.
lots of love
"Yes Harry of course it's going to be painful, I'm practically growing a new organ." He growled. The pain seemed to have subsided, he stood up straight and slowly made his way to the bed.
He turned to Ron, “hey I’m just going to say hi to Malfoy I’ll be right back.”
“Oh yes please, if we don’t hurry we’re going to be late.”
3 years later
"Hello love." He yawned. I stood from the couch and went to hug him.
For some reason Harry preferred shopping in Muggle stores, probably due to the fact that he wouldn't be gawked at for buying a carton of eggs and a litre of milk. Harry quickly jot down some of the basic necessities he would be needing for the week into a shopping list and exited the house, making sure the wards were perfectly stable before leaving. He strolled down the streets of London, the streets filled with laughing teenagers eating melting ice-cream and mothers jogging with their baby's in a pram. The office workers ventured out of their small and cold offices to experience some of the nicest weather London would receive for the year. Harry breathed in the fresh breeze and sighed in relief. Today would be an okay day he thought.
A whistle went off and Harry winced, there was a short yet fierce Professor standing with a broom in her hand and whistle in her mouth.
“For now Mr Potter lets keep this a little secret of ours, keep the surprise until try outs.”
They all stopped their whisperings and faced him, Harry beamed his best smile.
“Both Gryffindor.” Harry replied, he jostled a bit, the boats had now begun moving towards the castle.
“Hello Professor Snape.” Harry said, turning around and attempting not to flinch at the sight of Snape.
Harry quickly turned to Sirius and Remus, fiercely hugging the both of them, both men had tears swimming in their eyes, Harry himself was beginning to tear up.
“Is Uncle Remus sick again?”
The weeks moved onward and Harry slowly fell back into routine. For some reason his nightmares didn’t attack him as much, each day he felt more rested than the last. His friendship with Draco continued to grow, but for some reason Harry felt as if something was missing with Draco and he wasn’t quite sure what it was. On Hogsmeade weekends if Harry wasn’t listed to monitor the kids, he would disapparate to Hermione and Rons place and share dinner with them.
Hermione nodded her head, “What houses were they in?” She asked.
“Whats up? You need some help with something?” Draco asked, Mr Smith although a bright and welcoming student wasn't the most capable in potions.
"Rose would you like a cookie?"
“Come to the kitchen whilst I cook lunch and you can talk to me all about it.”
“Still that’s pretty cool that you got to learn about magic whilst growing up.” Hermione said, her eyes alight with happiness. Harry noticed that she really didn’t speak to others, she seemed to really be having trouble making friends with the other first years.
“Well Malfoy… or can I call you Draco?” Harry asked, a small smile curving his lips. He took Draco’s invitation and began to butter some toast which was somehow still warm.
So far Remus thought they were doing a good job, Harry was stubborn and hated to be told he was wrong, even over simple little things, like the spelling of a word. But Harry was kind and brave. He shared with the kids at play group, defended any little kid like he was prepared to take on the world for them and he knew how to make the room instantly brighten with laughter. Harry for a cute little four-year-old was unbelievably understanding and attentive of the world around him and Remus could not be prouder.
Harry nodded his head and gave a large smile to Ron. “Hey Ron remember Hermione?”
“Yeah McGonagall had to beg Dumbledore to let me join the team.” Harry nodded, Ron was still staring at him with his mouth agape.
“Oh thanks.” Harry nodded to Hooch, trying not to blush.
"Blimey we better hurry if we don't want to miss the ceremony!" Hagrid lifted himself off his stool threw a bone at fang before he closed the door. Harry and Hagrid hurried across the lawn towards the great hall, making it in time before the ceremony, however the hall already packed with all the students at Hogwarts. Harry smiled at the students as he walked down through the house tables, conversations dulled down to whispers as Harry took the empty seat next to Draco. McGonagall walked up and placed the sorting hat and its stool in the usual spot. The sorting hat sang its song that had taken all year for it to conjure then fell back into its usual silence, waiting for the first young head to be placed upon it.
“What!” Ron shouted out, standing up and disturbing the ink well that Hermione had precariously balanced on a pile of papers.
Harry nodded and made way for the supply cupboard, he quickly got to work, determined this time to finish before curfew, he had a charms essay to start. Harry worked quickly and efficiently, once he nearly dropped a jar of gillyweed and Snape barked at him to be more careful, but other than that there was no communication between the two.
Remus kneeled down and sniffed as he closed her eyes.
Jess <3
“Tell Professor McGonagall that I will see her after her lesson.” Snape gave one last disgusted look at Harry before turning around and flowing away.
"How's the Aurors Harry?" He asked. Harry sighed.
“That was good.” Harry sighed, plopping down at a table.
“I’m going to lunch you coming?”
Harry took another deep breath and opened the door a little faster this time, this was perhaps the wrong decision to make for the noise of the door squeaking loudly open woke up the frighteningly large three headed dog that Harry and Ron were now frozen in front of.
“Nothing really, I just wanted to say hi.” Draco said, looking away from Harry.
“Oh, welcome welcome first years.” The lady beamed.
“What?” He asked.
Ron cleared his throat and waved his hand at the sleeping rat, “sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” The rat did not move and neither did it turn yellow.
“You guys are weird.” She said, laughing lightly.
At that moment, Ron bounded down the stairs still trying to tie his necktie and his hair looking almost like a birds nest but on fire.
"Of course, Harry, please expect an owl with my reply in a few days." Her eyes softened and she shook his hand, Harry shook it back and made way to exit the castle. Neville rushed after him.
“Cut it out Blaise.” Draco nudged him with his elbow. Draco looked at Harry with an apologetic look, Harry smiled at him indicating that he wasn’t mad.
"Just a little bit." He murmured and scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. Minerva didn't reply.
“What’s up Ron?” Harry asked.
"For the first time in a long time you are the first too look at me without pity. The first too actually act normal around me." Harry sighed and shook his head, lost for words. "I honestly cannot say what about you that I like the most, and yeah we both have a lot of healing and fixing to do, but I want to do that together, with you."
“What do you mean?” Draco asked.
“Not Slytherin you say?”
“Always and forever.” Sirius finished.
Draco just stared at him, his eyes a little wide with an emotion that Harry couldn’t place.
“Do you still have to go to tryouts?” Ron asked, fiddling with one of Hermiones quills.
“Yeah I guess I am.” Hermione didn’t stop smiling.
“Promise.” Harry nodded smiling.
"What are you thinking?" He whispered, a shiver ran down my spine, his husky voice resonating to my core. "I'm thinking about how I can't believe that you are mine."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry made it to his class room with a minute to spare, the class had already let themselves into the room and taken their seats.
"Come here to Head Quarters so we can leave together." Harry nodded and Ron's head disappeared. Harry checking that he had everything grabbed a handful of floo powder threw it into the fire and yelled, Auror Department into the fire. Harry quickly stumbled out of the fire, the Auror Department bustling with activity, Ron's voice prominent over the buzz of the room, Harry quickly made his way to Ron, his assistant Howard handing him the assignment folder. "Thanks Howard." He mumbled, Howard nodded and walked away.
Harry groaned and rubbed his palm down his face.
“I’m here sir.” Harry spoke, standing awkwardly by the door. Snape finished writing before he looked up.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut as the thundering came closer and closer, he cringed and waited for the impact of the troll breaking the door open, but it never came. The thundering soon became distant, the troll had gone past him. Harry sighed in relief, he quicky scrambled out of the toilet and waited by the door to make sure that it was clear before he opened the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Its okay Hagrid." Harry wheezed, trying to get the half giant to release him from the suffocating hold.
Draco's stomach convulsed and tightened. He couldn't contain the smile that lifted his lips, that made his usual empty eyes shine so bright. He unravelled his hands from Harrys and flung his arms around his shoulders, pulling him close and smashing a kiss against his lips.
“It just wont listen to me.” He complained, slouching in defeat.
“Nothing its just we have potions with Slytherin.” He complained.
"Harry love, what are you doing?" Draco asked turning the light on in the study.
Draco made it back just as breakfast began. His stomach grumbled and Draco made the slow descent throughout the castle to the great hall. His stomach churned as he thought about having to see Harry, maybe he wasn’t so hungry after all. But he was a Malfoy and Malfoys didn’t run away from their problems, they snuck away. Draco made his way through the main entrance, as it was so early, there were few students up at this time. Draco nodded at the students as he walked by the tables, but stopped when one of his students waved him over.
“Oh Ron can you stop looking like a fish out of water, surely you are used to this sort of thing by now.” Hermione waved her hand dismissing Ron.
Harry didn’t know how to react to this sudden exposure of emotions that Draco was showing. Draco wiped away a few stray tears with the sleeve of his black cloak and sniffed. “I’m sorry about that.” Draco forced a laugh and picked up a cup to occupy his hands.
Harry wandering blinked when he found himself outside a very familiar portrait. “Oh.” Harry spoke aloud. He had somehow numbly walked to the Gryffindor common rooms. The portrait lady slept so she did not notice him, Harry took a step back as the portrait swung open and a second-year girl stepped out. She looked up at Harry and her eyes lit up, “Professor Potter!” She exclaimed, quickly adjusting her robes, by doing this Harry took notice of her robes, and realised the colour of them, his eyebrows raised.
“Merlin Draco, you really like to appear out of nowhere sometimes don’t you?” Harry rushed, still trying to catch his breathe.
“Well, if you want it then… you’ll just have to get it.” Quickly Zabini mounted his broom rose high into the air and threw the ball as hard as he could. Harry without much thought hurriedly grabbed his broom and zoomed after the ball, desperately hoping he could catch it. He flew, adrenalin rushing through his veins and outstretched his hand the ball falling in what felt like slow motion. Finally, his fingers clasped over the ball and Harry had to do a flip in order not to crash into the wall he was very close to hitting.
And yeah that's all I've got, I've pretty much lost all motivation for this fanfic, I don't particularly like it anymore, but I felt for those few who are reading it, might want a little more finality with the kiss scene. Who knows I might decided to pick up this fic again, but right now I have no idea how to continue Draco and Harrys relationship nor how to finish it. I ended it with the student line so that you guys can come up with your own how Draco and Harry will continue their relationship as colleagues and working in the castle, and how they develop their relationship in the future. But thankyou all for those who have read this and I'm so sorry that I've lost all motivation for this but I just cant really continue to write it. If you really enjoy my writing I have two more fanfics completed if you would like to read those
"Mother feels it's not the right time to return to the Manor."
Soon they had finally made it to the pitch and who Harry remembered to be the captain of the Quidditch team Oliver Wood stood waiting.
I slid the almost cold bacon onto Dracos plate and plopped the scrambled eggs on his toast. "Ron convinced me to take the week off, and I thought it would be good for us." I tried to keep the pink tint away from my cheeks. Draco still looked at me perplexed. "You took the week off…" He murmured, he shook his head and pinched his arm.
“Woah Harry calm down, it’s just we’re late for breakfast.”
Sirius just smiled widely and ruffled Harrys too, “that’s my little man.” He said, Remus nearly burst out crying.
I took hold of his hand in reassurance, "Your always safe with me." He took a deep breath and gave a small smile, that was all the encouragement I needed to throw the floo powder and yell Diagon Alley. Diagon Alley instantly smelt of its familiar candy and potion ingredients, children and their parents hurried around, getting to their desired store and waiting in the long lines to buy their products. We passed the good old broomstick store, I took a quick peep at the latest broom and instantly felt the desire to buy it.
Ron smiled again at Harry mentioning this.
“I’ve never flown a broom before I’m really not looking forward to flying lessons tomorrow.”
“Thanks, my grandma would’ve killed me if I lost it.”
Harry turned off the shower and stepped out of the shower, dragging a towel around his waist and grabbing another to dry off his hair. Today he didn't feel like going to work, he went to the kitchen and quickly scribbled out a letter to excuse himself from work. Blue was not in his cage, Harry assumed he would be delivering the letter he had written last night to Malfoy. Harry sighed for what felt like the tenth time that morning and it wasn't even ten o'clock yet. Kreacher popped in the kitchen and brought Harry a plate of tea and biscuits. "Master Potter needs to get food." He grumbled. Harry nodded his head and dunked the biscuits into the tea to get rid of the stale texture. Kreacher tried to do the least amount of work that he could get away with around the house, and something that he never did was shop for the house, leaving the shopping up to Harry. Harry finished the biscuits and the tea then put on his usual muggle attire, a pair of washed blue jeans and a simple t-shirt, today's weather was nice enough that he wouldn't be needing a jacket to fend off the cold. Harry grabbed his wallet which contained enough muggle money to do a week's worth of shopping.
“It’s okay Hermione, he’s just feeling a bit hurt you can go to him.”
“Hm probably not.” Harry replied laughing a bit too.
Ron too had a mouth full of food, but he had no regards about talking with his mouth full.
“Um Madam Pomfrey!” Hermione called out, Madam Pomfrey quickly shuffled out her office, her face set in a frown.
Harry nodded and got comfortable in the bed, the mattress was nothing like the soft pillowy mattresses of his dorm, but it sufficed and soon the affects of the potion over came him.
“The same duties as last night Mr Potter.”
Harry watched as Hermione and Ron finished their game, with Hermione losing, but she didn’t get her arsed kicked as bad as Harry usually did.
“Oi Harry I hear a new broom is going to be released soon.”
"Merlin I'm gonna miss you as my partner." Ron seemed as if he was about to cry.
(Sequel to Becoming New) Harry and Draco are now a married happy couple, but one question is left unanswered between the two. Will they have children? Can they put their past behind them and make their own family?
“Argh I’m suddenly realising how unfit I am.” Harry grumbled, he didn’t know if he could leave his bed.
“I’m just teasing you Moony.” He chuckled, quickly pecking him on the lips before releasing him from his arm cage.
The memory was one to last, Ron ended up in State Mungos with a broken leg and multiple hexes to treat, Hermione soon turned up, nights when Ron went out she was always prepared for the worst. Harry making sure that Ron would be okay left with a smile to both Ron and Hermione. At least they caught the bastard.
“How about you?” Draco asked in return. Harry took a moment to think, and came to the conclusion that he had slept exceptionally as well. There was no nightmare and no horrible darkness that felt like it was swallowing him. He slept almost like he was floating in air.
Draco took a step back from Harry to give him some space. “Sorry I should of probably woken you up more gently… but you just kept smiling and wouldn’t wake up.”
“I did it!” Hermione cried smiling brightly.
“Ger’ off.” Harry mumbled; he could hear Hermione rolling her eyes. Harry finally sat up, rubbing the heaviness away from his eyes.
“Hey, it will, what are you nervous about heights or falling off?”
"This." He proclaimed before taking Draco's mouth against his own. Draco too shocked did not respond to the warm lips against his own. This feeling so very unfamiliar to him. He had dreamed of this moment countless times but did not know the true spectrum of feelings that would erupt in his stomach when it finally happened.
Draco and Harry both chuckled lightly, before they too started walking to the Great Hall in amicable silence.
Harry made his way to the Great Hall, his thoughts crashing throughout his mind. Harry made his way through the back way as he always did. As he made his way to the seat that now was always left empty besides Draco, more whispers than usual quickly blanketed the hall. Minerva looked to the two, a familiar twinkle in her eye. Harry looked away feeling slightly intimidated. Harry sat down next to Draco, who gave him a quick smile before continuing his conversation with Professor Flitwick. Harry didn’t have the energy to try and zone into their conversation so he piled his plate whilst Draco naturally placed a spoonful of steamed vegetables onto his plate.
The night soon came to a rest and everyone climbed into their beds. Harry was exhausted and feeling very full from the feast. He slept dreaming of long hallways, moving staircases and Remus’s homemade dinner. He awoke feel well rested and excited for first day of classes.
Draco heads to lunch, desperately wanting to see if Harry is okay, however he doesn't show up. Draco feels more puzzled and hurt than ever, even more than when his parents wouldn't let him come home for the christmas holidays and merlin that hurt.
Harry, Draco and Neville soon followed the two and walked with their partnered Bridesmaids, Luna and Ginny, whilst Ron had three groomsmen Hermione had decided to only have two bridesmaids. Leaving Neville, the tail of the line.
"Yeah?"
“Oi what you guys doing?” Fred said, a smirk dancing on his lips.
Harry and Ron tried to go as fast as they could, slowing down their paces slightly as they were passed by their peers. They once passed Professor Snape who had a horrid look on his face, but he just glared at the boys as they bobbed their heads down, luckily he made no comment.
“Oh no no its fine we’ll take it.” He said hurriedly. The elf smiled and handed him the basket, Harry took it and nearly dropped it due to how heavy it was.
McGonagall nodded, seeming to know that he was already punished she let him go to his seat without another word. Ron instantly started to ask questions when Harry sat, but Harry just said he would tell him after class, his heart was still racing too fast after his first meeting with Snape.
The weeks fluttered by. With Harry and Draco continuing their relationship in secret and students quickly realising what was happening behind the scenes.
"I took the week off." I shrugged, trying to make it look like i did it without thought.
Harry soon found his bed with his trunk at the end of it. With a groan he flopped onto his bed, he had spent too much of the day sitting around.
The boys quickened their paces and made way to the great hall, they still had ten minutes left of lunch, enough time to grab a quick bite and make excuses to Hermione for the absences. They finally made it to the great hall, Harry quickly composed himself and gave a quick nod to Ron to see if he was ready. Both boys made way for Hermione who was animatedly talking to Lavender Brown, her plate half empty.
Harry awoke with a start, he groaned and peeked under the cover, today was not his morning. The feeling of yesterday's dirt still on him Harry got up and went to the shower, not only to clean but also to release himself of the wet dream he had. Harry gave a one last tug and moaned, his release mixing with the water down the drain. Harry sighed, having wet dreams at his age definitely showed how sexually frustrated he had become. One thing that Harry did not know was who the person was in his wet dream, however one thing was for sure, whoever it was, was extremely erotic.
Draco looked away from the fire and calculated their puzzled faces, uhh stuff it! Who cares what people think about me anymore, my reputation already drowned ages ago. He thought to himself.
“What the bloody hell was that?” Ron cried out, breathing fast.
He began to get up, but Malfoys hand shot up and grabbed his sleeve. Harry looked down to the pale hand with surprise, Malfoy quickly retreated it.
Harry was the first to speak.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry?” Draco called. Harry shook his head and looked up at Draco, who stood there holding a platter with sandwiches, his eyes swimming with worry and curiosity.
“Yeah and so?” Zabini said smirking, Crabbe and Goyle quickly came to his side, Draco too stood closer, looking like he was ready to step in, but Harry could deal with this himself.
“We’re finally here Harry.” Ron said, his bed was next to his.
I finished dunking the tea bag from the pot and took the trayful of tea cups and the teapot out into the living room. Hermione and Ron sat thigh to thigh, their youngest Hugo barely a year old sitting on his fathers lap and a three-year-old rose sitting next to her mother patiently.
I chuckled and moved his head to relax against my chest. "Me too… Me too."
and here is the next chapter, sorry for the long wait as I said before I just started uni and didn't really have the time to write. I think I'm going to only update once a week now. This allows me a longer time to write which means better quality writing and hopefully longer chapters!
"Always." I whispered back.
“Okay Uncle Remus firstly, I asked Sirius this, but he wasn’t sure, but do Hobbits actually exist?” Harry asked, the book wide open as Harry skimmed through looking for references for his questions.
Harry thought, “that be nice but even if you don’t apologise to him can you not try to get a rise out of him again please.” Harry said, still with his serious face on.
“Okay so how about this, just imagine something else that you like doing when you call for the broom, try not to think about it too much.”
Ron pushed through the crowd to Harry with a bright smile on his face.
Sirius strolled into the kitchen, his face still light with laughter. He kissed Remus on the cheek as he passed him to get a cup of water. Remus blushed, it was only recently that they had openly begun to show their relationship to Harry and occasionally it still made Remus slightly embarrassed.
Harrys turn soon arrived, for some reason he was placed at the last of the line, this reason was unknown to him, but the Great Hall became absolutely silent when Professor McGonagall called out his name.
“What?” Ron exclaimed.
“ARGH!” The troll yelled, it swung its mighty club and Harry narrowly dodged it by throwing himself to the side. The troll now even more angry stomped towards him, Harry somehow managed to roll away, missing his one chance to become Harry mush.
Harry turned to him curious, “why is it odd?”
Draco sighed and continued to his room.
Harry didn’t know what to make of this, Draco finally felt so comfortable and safe around Harry that he let the one thing that was protecting him from physical harm to fall away. Harry wanted to keep feeling this euphoria for the rest of his life. He decided that perhaps he too should stay the night, he wanted to wake up and see Draco’s face first in the morning. Harry cuddled further into the armchair and quickly lowered the fire with a charm. Harry during his time in the Aurors had quickly mastered the use of wandless magic, something that very few could do apparently.
"Harry doesn't want any." I spoke softly, but my heart squeezed painfully.
“Oh, I’m sure you’ll survive.” Draco rolled his eyes.
“Oh, is that my Remember ball?” He said.
"Okay next stop the potions shop then we can go home." After a while I whispered Wingardium Leviosa and just let the bags hover behind us. Draco was choosy with his products and made sure he was getting the best for the price, after about half an hour of him still shopping for ingredients I wanted to go look in other stores, he agreed and let me leave, but not before giving me a warning about buying that broom, I promised I wouldn't and quickly left.
“Hermione you’ll be fine, and anyways magic can fix a mended bone in a second.” Ron reassured, Harry shook his head, that really wasn’t the most reassuring. But Hermione seemed to take it and she looked less nervous once they had finally made it to the Quidditch pitch.
Finally, they stopped outside a painting of a very large lady.
Draco would not be returning to the Manor for the Christmas holiday. This statement continuously played in his mind since he received the letter from his mother two days before.
“Alright all ready to go?” Ron clapped his hands and made way for the exit.
Sirius went into his office to finish off work that he had not been able to finish, by the time he emerged it was lunch time and he was famished.
“Yeah I hope I get in.”
“So, it wouldn’t burn a whole city down just to sleep on some gold in a mountain?”
“I am going to test you, a seekers main goal is to catch the snitch, so for now I want to see if you can achieve this.” Oliver stepped towards him and handed him a broom that wasn’t used for quidditch lessons, it felt a lot younger and more reliable, this must have been one of the teams brooms.
“I was?” Harry asked confused, he didn’t remember having a nightmare of any sort.
Harry didn’t want to hurt Draco in any way, but he also didn't want to see Draco as he wasn't sure how he was going to react knowing that Draco was eventually going to reject him. Harry took the entrance down to the kitchen and was generously served with lunch by the house elves. He ate at a table that they set up for him and Harry looked over some work for his next lesson.
“She accused me of losing her History of Magic textbook because I borrowed it last, but I swear that I gave it back to her!” Ron angrily spat.
"Shit mate you're right!" Ron's blue eyes widened, Hermione slapped him on the arm.
One of his students was seriously struggling however Harry didn't know how to give him the extra help without looking like he was favouring him. Harry sighed. This is what he needs Draco for.
“Do hobbits exist in the wizarding world too?”
Sirius took this as his time to finally give Remus his water. He walked as fast as he could to the bedroom and softly sat down next to Remus.
"Hedwig would be proud." A voice echoed through the room and I turned to find Draco watching me with the same smile as I.
Harry and Ron were very quickly shoving their faces with food, whilst Hermione ate with grace and manners. Harry felt sorry for Hermione having to stick with their horrible eating habits, and surprisingly a girl from his year sat next to Hermione and began talking to her. Harry desperately tried to remember what her name was but it wasn’t coming to mind, he would have to ask Hermione later.
Everyone clapped and applauded when Hermione and Ron finished their vows with a kiss. Draco took Harrys hand and squeezed it, the smile on his face had not left since they arrived. The now married couple walked down the aisle hand in hand, Ron looking back and beaming at them.
"Harry!" Someone moaned. A flash of blond hair brushed against Harrys cheek as their lips kissed their way down his naked chest. The lips left a trail of heat as Harry squirmed under the body, he desperately wanted more, he wanted release. The unknown blond smirked a faceless smirk and kissed his jaw, "I'll help you in a minute." It said before going to black.
“That’s…that’s really nice.” Draco said, keeping his eyes on the basket.
This coming Hogsmeade would be one of them.
“Boys I said hover!” Hooch yelled at them, Harry gave her an apologetic look and lowered closer to the ground.
The owner looked me up and down. "You are Harry Potter, aren't you?"
"Draco I'm surprised that you want kids." I looked to him almost sharply but mostly in puzzlement, "and what do you mean by that?"
"Ron, the blue moon is tomorrow night! Tomorrow night!" My heart thudded against my chest, Draco said we would speak, but it had been two nights since then and he hadn't mentioned a thing about the moon, every night when I would go to bed, I kept expecting him to say something, but he would simply kiss me on the cheek and turn away to sleep.
sorry this one is a bit overdue, buts its longer so hope you enjoy!
Hermione hesitated but she listened and gave Harry a goodbye smile.
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of.” Minerva chuckled out.
“Mr Smith.” Draco smiled.
“Morning Malfoy.” Harry said, plopping his elbows on the table and leaning his chin on his palm, giving Malfoy an innocent look.
“Yeah mate, snoring and everything, it was a right laugh.” Ron snickered, gathering his books and shoving them into his bag.
“Yeah I don’t.” Draco nodded, a small smile ghosting his lips. Harry wanted to see that smile again.
Draco stripped himself and put on his pyjamas which generally consisted of one of Harrys lazy shirts and a pair of boxers. Draco flopped onto the bed which caused Sirius to hiss and jump off the bed, Draco smirked, serves him right he thought. The buzz of the night finally began to wear off and the blanket of slumber soon began to weigh him down. But Harry had not yet come into the bedroom and he couldn't sleep without Harry.
Draco.
Sorry for the long wait to update I know my upload schedule is all over the place but I’m gonna try to fix it, but please be aware I’m going into year twelve end of January so my upload schedule will be slow :)
“For your first le-lesson, we are… going to read from chapter one.” Quirrell said than quickly sat down behind his desk and said nothing further. The class murmured slightly with one another; they had thought they would have more of an exciting first lesson than reading from their textbook. Harry and Hermione did not open their textbooks, they had already read the first chapter. The trio all looked at each other confused. This was not what they had expected.
“Oh well, still five points.” Ron smiled. They laughed and continued to the tower, the adrenalin of having survived a full-grown mountain troll still rushing through their veins.
Hermione waited outside the bathroom as I peed on the stick. One good thing about muggles was they had these stick things that told you if you were pregnant or not in like ten minutes. I finished peeing on the stick and lifted my pants back up, I washed my hands and exited the bathroom.
Harrys heart squeezed in his chest slightly, Draco was nervous.
“Perhaps after the first two weeks that you came here.”
I turned to face him, his green eyes deepened with lust, making my heart somehow beat faster. A smirk rose to my face and I flicked water from my hands onto his face. He jerked backwards and wiped his face. "Draco that's gross!" He whined, I giggled and placed my hands on my hips. "Well I told you that I was doing the dishes."
Ron just looked to him and gave him a glare but gave Hermione an apologetic look.
Harry never wants to forget the sounds of Dracos moans.
Harry finally emerged out of the room, his black suit on but his blue tie crooked. Draco once again sighed and rolled his eyes at Harry. "Come here." Harry smiled sheepishly and stood in front of Draco who had to retie the mess Harry made and straighten it. "Thank you love." Harry placed a soft kiss on Draco's lips. Even after three years of being together, Draco never ceased from giving him butterflies. Dracos eyes fluttered opened when Harry leaned back, separating their lips, Draco still would never get over that Harry was his, and he was Harrys.
"Draco!" Harry exclaimed. He had been so nervous to see him that he wasn't sure how he was going to greet him and here he was greeting him after rudely bumping into him.
“Yep I hope we have good classes for our first day.” Harry nodded, smiling back infected by Hermione’s smile.
Harry shook his head, “I think you should be nice to everyone, no matter if they’re a creature or not.”
Harry sat in the carriage with Ron, they both had just settled in and were excitedly looking out the window watching the scenery blur by. Harry looked up to Ron, there was no red blotches on his face or any swelling around his eyes, he didn’t seem sad at all about leaving his family.
“Jealous?” Harry said faking surprise. Draco just rolled at his eyes at him.
“No, it hasn’t, maybe it’s just all the excitement of the day.”
Draco skips the morning shower and casts a scourgify charm on himself, careful not to cast it on his face, he’s not so particular about having soap in his mouth this morning. As there still is a few more hours until breakfast Draco tries to find something to do but soon realises that he did all the work that he needed to do last night. He thinks maybe a trip to The Three Broomsticks would help waste away the hours.
much love,
Since the war had ended, Draco had worked his arse off to gain the trust and forgiveness of Rosmerta and now he and Rosmerta were on friendly terms with all forgiven.
As Draco looked around the room everything screamed Harry to him. To the way that Harry organised his papers, and to the way that his clothes lay about with not a care in the world.
wow this was fun to write, hope you guys enjoyed this which i pulled an all nighter to write, im going to sleep now XD
Harry when he thought about it, liked that he was influencing Draco to be nicer, he didn’t know too much about Draco’s upbringing. However, for what he could tell so far his parents didn’t do much in terms of teaching him good morals and having equal respect for others, Harry knew that he couldn’t change Draco in a heartbeat and he didn’t want to change Draco tremendously, he just wanted to make him a slighter nicer person.
Professor Flitwick then gracefully jumped down from the pile of books he was standing on and circled around the room, making small comments to students and helping any others that had any questions. Harry found the page and read on the charm, finding it mildly interesting. He had read charms books before and already knew about most basic charms, he was going to answer the question Flitwick had asked, but Hermione’s arm shot in the air quicker than lightning besides he wanted Hermione to have her moment.
Harry landed by Zabini, “look Zabini I know you want to show off and be cool but messing around with other people’s stuff or bullying people isn’t cool.” Harry said, he left it at that and turned around going back to his friends and sitting in the grass with them.
“Hey what you guys doing?” Ron squinted suspiciously.
The silence continued, then Hermione asked the question I dreaded she would. "Draco when are you two going to have kids?" Hermione asked earnestly and innocently. The smile that was ghosting my lips instantly dropped.
“You sure you’ll be okay with this? Looks a bit difficult for someone your age.”
“Oh, what do we have here? uh Mr Potter, come come let’s get that bleeding stopped.” Pomfrey ushered Harry to sit on a bed, once he was set, she quickly shooed Hermione off.
Harry gave himself one more look over and accepted that he looked good enough to show his face to Draco. He shoved his bag with some school work that he wanted to ask Draco for advice on after they had finished their meal. Harry made his way to Dracos room and let himself in. Draco was expecting him anyway. Harry poked his head around the door, “knock knock.” He spoke, Draco jumped and turned around. Harry laughed slightly and stepped into the room, the smell of a home-cooked meal evading his senses.
It took a long time for Harry to gather the will to adopt another owl, after Hedwig he didn't think he could go through the pain of getting another and losing it again. However, on a mission in South America he came across Blue's small and fragile body fallen from his nest high above in the canopies. Harry quickly took him to a someone who would know how to take care of him and ever since then Blue became his. Harry wasn't sure if he could use Blue as an owl to do deliveries for him as he never really trained Blue how to, however Blue somehow knew, just like Hedwig did.
Hermione was next to come down, and she conveniently came down at the same time as Ron. Harry jumped up from the windowsill, he was starting to get hungry now and he wanted to get to breakfast as he could. After quickly going to grab his bag, they all left for breakfast, talking about how excited they were for DADA.
Harry sat next to Hermione who quickly stopped at the interruption of the arrival of Harry and Ron.
“Oh, there you two are! Where did you boys go wandering off two? Lunch is almost finished.” Hermione crossed her arms like a mother chastising their child.
Harry remembered exactly why he wouldn’t wake up and he immediately felt a heat rise up his neck. “Oh umm well thanks for waking me up.” Harry stood up from the chair and cleared his throat, feeling somewhat awkward. He didn’t want to wake up this way with Draco, he wanted to wake up before Draco and see that soft expression of his on his face.
“He’ll be fine, especially if Fred and George make it back on the team as Beaters again.”
Remus smiled, of course to a child it sounded like a simple and tiring job, and he wasn’t one that was going to refute it.
He stuck out his bottom lip and pouted. "But babe I missed you."
“Shh he’s reading a book so its fine.”
"Yes?"
"You never saw us here." I winked at her, using my charms that I only used in emergencies to keep her quiet. She only nodded her head as I handed her some galleons. We left with my hands full of shopping bags.
“I would’ve thought so too, I was so nervous.” Harry laughed. Draco continued walking with Harry until they got to the stairs of Gryffindor Tower.
“Harry Potter.” Harry spoke.
“Oh, shut up.” Harry rolled his eyes, he sat on the couch with them, they were in the middle of a game of wizard chest. No matter how many games Harry had played with Ron growing up he could never manage to win, he was glad that someone else was interested in playing chess with Ron.
“Welcome First Years, I am Madam Hooch, I am the riding instructor here at this school and you all will listen to every word I say, is that understood?”
"Yeah Ron usually tries to get home on time, but he has been coming home later and later."
“That’s a good boy, you’ll probably feel a bit sleepy, that potion has a drowsy side effect, I’ll wake up at lunchtime.”
“Look at me when you speak Mr Potter.” Snape sharply spoke and Harry wiped his head up.
Malfoy turned back to Harry, who was now not amused by the way he was best friend was being treated, but something in his head, perhaps an echo of Remus’s teaching was telling him to not cast aside the boy without a second look.
The chatter soon died down in the halls as students were lead off to their house dormitory's, Harry and Draco stayed behind to have a meeting with the other professors about and they too were soon dismissed. Harry and Draco walked next to each other, a comfortable distance between them. They didn't speak as they walked, however the air did not feel strained, the silence was not heavy but light. Draco and Harry both had small smiles ghosting their lips as they walked, a few students that had decided to leave their common rooms passed them and gave Harry (and to Harrys surprise) and Draco large smiles. "I see the students have taken a liking to you?" Harry asked, keeping the tone light.
“What’s this?” Harry asked.
"We did it!" He cried back, he knelt down to my stomach and kissed it. "We did it." He whispered to it.
He wore a light blue woollen cardigan and pressed jeans with a pair of black shoes, his cardigan matched the colour of his eyes and his jeans hugged the shape of his legs. I stopped roaming his body with my eyes and looked to his face, a slight smirk sat there.
“Hey, I think I saw that it was on top of a door or something.” Harry said, trying to remember back to that short terrifying moment.
"Mate, I really think you just need to take like the week off." I sighed and leaned back in my chair.
Harry walked into the dorms and quickly grabbed his book bag with the things he would need for charms. He looked around and found Ron already asleep in his bed. Seamus and Dean were murmuring about something on Deans bed.
"Yeah could be." Harry mumbled. "Well let's make it a good memory to last aye?" Ron gave Harry one last look before he turned and disapparated. Harry then the same.
Harry watched on like a puppy waiting for their owner to take them on a walk. Draco rose and so did Harry, his Gryffindor curiosity not allowing him one moment of patient. Harry looked back and waved goodbye to Neville, who returned the wave.
“Come on Zabini just hand it over.” Ron said calmy.
“See not so hard is it Neville!” Harry smiled proudly; he gave Neville a congratulatory pat on the back before going back to his spot where he continued to hover. Neville was extremely shaky hovering, but at least he was on a broom now.
“You could have woken me up you know.” Harry grumbled; he didn’t like that others were laughing at him.
“Its what friends are for Neville.” Harry just replied, smiling kindly at Neville.
"You can always call if you need backup." Harry chuckled back, his heart softly aching with the knowledge that he would no longer be working side by side with Ron. Ron and Hermione left too, with a wave goodbye Harry closed the front door.
“We love you Harry.” Remus sniffed, ruffling the boys hair.
Ron kept trying to encourage Hermione about riding brooms for the rest of the way to the Great Hall, Harry thought it was pointless himself so he just listened in or zoned out and thought about his day with Draco yesterday.
“Draco I think I’ve come to fancy you.”
“Good so now time for the details of your punishment, for the next two weeks you’ll be assisting me with the reorganisation of my supply cupboard, I hope you’re not too clumsy with those hands of yours.”
The next day Harry slept in and was being shaken by Ron when he woke up.
He liked the common room he decided. The chairs by the fire were very inviting and the tall large windows had enough room to sit on the ledges which seemed like a perfect spot to curl up with a book. Harry sat down on one of the couches, watching the fire and began thinking of Sirius and Remus, an ache spread through his chest again. He really missed his uncles.
“Ron are you not sad about leaving your family?” Harry asked, he had known Ron since he could remember, and he wasn’t embarrassed to ask Ron questions like this.
The first years made way to the bank of an ocean large lake. All awed as they saw the castle glistening in the dark night, the castle looked like something out of a fairy tale book.
"Please we work together now, call me Minerva." She huffed and waved her hand, she turned around and lead the way to where Harrys room would be. "Are you familiar with these walls Harry?" She asked, turning a sharp eye towards Harry. Harry tried to push down the blush rising up his neck. Students weren't really meant to go near the rooms of their teachers, however Harry had used this hallway as a shortcut on his way to many of his mischievous adventures.
“Yeah friends.” Neville beamed.
“Uh you see when I first read The Hobbit, I thought they would too, but unfortunately it turns out that they do not, Dwarves certainly do but not Hobbits.”
"Draco, you underestimate yourself too much." He tangled his hands with Dracos. "Yes, we may fight a lot, and yes the news will have a field trip with us, but I can't think any further in the future without you in it." Harrys eyes desperately searched Dracos.
Then he woke up.
“Potter… Harry… what are you doing here?” Malfoy hissed quietly; he ducked his head down slightly trying to hide from the now shocked eyes watching them.
No one knew how to respond to this statement, but Sirius and Remus did not care for how Harry survived, they were just extremely thankful that he had.
“Shhhh.” Draco chuckled, like he too had become a student again.
“Well Hermione I guess you’re stuck with weird.” Ron chuckled, getting up from the floor, reaching down and helping Harry up too.
“Oh well we…” Harry began scratching the back of neck, he had forgotten to think of an excuse to give Hermione.
“Harry..” Minerva sighs. “I have known you since you were eleven, I have seen you grow into a fine man that you are now, but emotions well they are something that you are not good at.”
“Did you two fight or something?” Harry asked, his head was feeling a lot clearer now that he had some food and juice in him.
"Oh, I don't know…" Harry voiced out, since the war ended six years he had done a very good job at avoiding the public eye, however if he were to succeed in getting a job here he would have to get used to it.
“Fine fine…” Zabini sighed then turned to Draco.
"Surprise?"
"Okay you know I trust you mate."
Lavender decided to walk with them, her and Hermione continued on with the subject that they were talking about before, which Harry came to learn was about Gilderoy Lockhart… whoever that was.
“Oh, you boys!” Hermione cried, she wrapped her arms around the both of them and pulled them close, “lets not fight again please, I really hate choosing sides.”
Whispers Harry thought. Whispers kept clouding his head.
Ron soon was sitting with the hat on his head, his eyes squished shut, Harry knew that he was desperately praying for Gryffindor too, his whole family was in Gryffindor. The hat same as Hermione did not take long for it to bellow Gryffindor. Ron beamed and rushed to the table, sitting next to other first years who had already been sorted. His twin brothers rushed over and attacked him with head rubs and congratulatory punches. Harry was now desperate to join his friends.
"Sorry I'm late Harry." She smiled, she sat down into her seat with a sigh. "Some first years were brawling outside the potions class." Harry nodded, his throat suddenly feeling very tight. McGonagall's usual very stern eyes soften as she looked at Harry. "How are you Harry?" She asked sincerely.
“Well I guess not, but I thought we weren’t allowed to use magic outside of Hogwarts.” Harry said feeling a bit stupid.
"Is that it?" I asked.
“Merlin what happened?” Ron said, Hermione hovered in.
Hermione nodded her head, she seemed proud to know something that Harry did not.
“Awwww.” The class broke out, they all seemed disappointed by this explanation. “What are you guys so disappointed for?” Harry asked, then immediately wished he hadn’t asked.
Harry smiled lightly at him, having to slightly force it, “I’m okay thanks Neville, sorry for waking you all up.”
I pondered over this, I guess it wouldn't be the end of the world to take a week off, beside Draco and me really needed it, especially if we wanted to make this child thing work. Child. God just the thought of having a child scared the shit out of me. I didn't know how to raise a kid, I didn't know how to be a father! However, the words that Draco had told me the other night replayed in my head. But I know that I'm not my father and you are not your uncle" I smiled lightly, and my thudding heart slowed down to its usual beat. I picked up my quill and quickly began to finish the report after an two hours of non-stop writing, I placed the report by Ron's snoring face along with a thank you letter. I crept out of the office and made way to the fire places to head home.
At the word of breakfast Ron’s eyes shot open.
“Your garden?” Harry asked.
Harry doesn't know why but today is really not his day. He goes to clear his throat trying to bring some sensibility into this conversation. Minerva takes the hint and straightens her back, eyeing him once again with that twinkle in her eye.
“Soo what are you going to do about Ron, because Harry if you haven’t noticed yet I think he might be a little bit jealous of me.”
“Can I ask what is so amusing Ms Lostring?” Harry crossed his arms and took a firm stance in front of her desk, the class looked on amused. They really saw Professor Potter this Professor like. “Well I heard some slytherin girls this morning talking how they saw you come out of Professor Malfoys room.” She giggled, her face bright red. The rest of the class then broke out in giggles. Harry opened his mouth to try and defend himself however he saw no way out.
“Sirius!” Remus gasped, he already had tears falling from dark green eyes. The two young men stood together, communicating although no words were spoken whilst Harry finally fell asleep in Sirius’s arms.
“Maybe.” Harry grumbled; Draco gave him an encouraging pat on the back before turning around.
Moody was the next one to enter the room, words were still not spoken between any of these men, it was painfully obvious would had occurred and no questions were needed to be asked, but then Moody spotted the sleeping baby in Sirius arms, his eyes widened.
I shivered and smiled softly, the ache in my chest suddenly disappearing just from the sound of his voice. Harry took my hand and kissed it gently. "I think I'm ready for that talk." He murmured.
“What does your garden smell like?” Harry asked further, his yearning to want to know everything about Draco slightly shining through.
"Harry." I call.
Harry chuckled a little, “you didn’t have to seem you were about to tell me the worst news in the world.”
“Probably, and they’ll be even more upset when you make Gryffindor win the Quidditch cup.” Harry didn’t like the maddening glint in McGonagall’s eye, suddenly he knew that he would have no choice but to say yes, he wouldn’t like to be on the bad side of her.
“What?” Harry asked, interested.
The afternoon continued with Hermione and me talking about work, whilst Ron played with Hugo and Rose to keep them entertained. It felt good to be able to talk to them, I decided to take the week off, but Harry hadn't, the days had quickly turned lonely.
The rest of the night ensued with the party and Harry exhaustingly mingling with the others, however it was nice to catch up on with Tomas and Seamus for he had not seen them for a while. Ginny, he mostly avoided as he had not really spoken to her much since they broke up after only a year of dating, however he decided to stop being an arsehole and go and speak to her.
Harry thankfully was always good at sneaking around, for he and Sirius had to do lot of sneaking around to escape the constantly chastising Remus. Harry shrugged on his robes and went down to the common room. There was a dull ache beginning to grow behind his eyes, but he ignored it as best as he could as he ducked out.
“Here we go.” Harry plopped the coffee cup with tea in front of Draco, a bit too roughly allowing for some tea to spill over. “Shit sorry.” Harry hissed and with a swish of his hand the mess was gone.
Harry freezes and Draco’s face flushed red with frustration. “You know Harry I really forgot how much of an air head that you can be!” Draco huffed. Harry still doesn't know how to react. Throughout the year, Harry had not once seen Draco get angry and seeing Draco angry was refreshing.
“Close the door!” Harry whispered, Ron quickly nodded and closed the door quietly.
“So, are you hoping for Gryffindor then?” She wasn’t looking at him now, totally entranced by the castle.
“I go for Kenmare Kestrels.” Seamus said, Harry himself didn’t know the name of the team, but he assumed it was some local Irish team.
His cheeks flushed its usual red and he mumbled an apology.
Draco stuck out his tongue and took Harrys hand. "You ready?" Harry squeezed his hand. "Ready."
"That was a lot better than my imagination could ever come up with." Harry said, a small chuckle rolling off his lips.
“Woah you okay love?” Sirius asked, he quickly waved his wand over the water and settled it. Remus chuckled and took the pot off the heat.
Draco’s face falls in disappointment and Harry doesn't know why. “Is that what you want Harry?” Draco asks.
“I already told him we haven’t seen one.” Ron said, not impressed by the interruption, Harry looked over to Ron who had his rat Scabbers out and he seemed he was about to do a spell on him.
I decided that maybe I should look in the pet store. I hadn't visited the pet store since the end of school to find a cheap owl for work, but I couldn't stand getting a new owl, so I simply left empty handed. However, for some reason something was telling me to have one more go in the store. I made my way through the thick crowd and soon found myself at the entrance of the store. The familiar sounds of owls hooting brought a dull ache to my chest. I took a deep breath and stepped in. The store instantly surrounded me with all different sorts of pets, from owls, ferrets, mice, toads, cats. I walked through the aisles nothing really catching my eye. A tap on my shoulder scared me and I instantly turned, my wand at the ready. However, it was Dumbledore. I shook my head and rubbed my eyes; however he was still there well he was kinda there, looking closer I could see that he was slightly transparent.
Harry deciding that he would stop torturing Hermione closed his map and turned to Hermione.
Dumbledore looked once over the dead body of Lily and his eyes darkened with sorrow, then he looked to Harry, many emotions passed through his eyes, none that Sirius or Remus could identify.
I crossed my arms around my chest and huffed. "I'm getting slightly offended now you know, and I take Christmas's off!"
They all rushed into Charms out of breathe. Professor Flitwick who was standing on a tall pile of books gave them an appraising look but said nothing, letting them bustle into their sits before he continued his introduction to the class.
“Hmm I remember, but I also recall a little something about you laughing at my snoring.” Harry said, a small smirk playing on his lips as he stepped closer to Ron.
“Thank you so much Harry.” Neville said as they finally got to their dorms.
Harry slowly makes his way to the Great Hall, he woke up way before breakfast, however he also didn't want to face Draco so early in the morning. Harry looks down to his watch, there's still 15 minutes left of breakfast, maybe he should just hike up his shorts and be a man. As he makes his way to breakfast a few last minuters rush towards the hall, all bed hair and unstraightened ties. Harry goes through the back entrance, eyeing the table and seeing that Draco has already started breakfast with a seat empty to his right. Harry cleared his throat and casts a quick scourgify on himself, careful not to aim towards his face, he really didn't feel like some soap in his mouth.
"What's this for?" Harry asked, actually what even was all this celebration for? Harry scanned the room, a lot of people from his school days had shown up; Neville, George, The Weasleys, Dean and Seamus and surprisingly Ginny.
"Well this is my stop." Draco smiled, his hand hesitating on the door knob. "Per…Perhaps you would like some tea?" Draco hesitated. He wasn't quite sure if Harry was in the mood to sit down and chat further.
“Night Draco!” Harry waved before bounding up the stairs.
“Ron!” Hermione called after him, conflicted not knowing whether to stay with Harry or to go with Ron.
“Good, you’ll have to listen to every word I say mistakes can’t be made when helping me with these precious ingredients, they are grown by a friend of mine and I do not wish to waste them.”
“Just close your eyes take a deep breathe and think about gardening.”
"What… What are you doing here… No how are you here?!" He did not say anything but simply fluttered past me, I could do nothing but follow. His ghostly figure floated through the aisles until he stopped beside a red owl. The owl somewhat represented a phoenix but had the distinct features of an owl, its dark red eyes wild and fiery, almost as if fire was sprouting out of them, its feathers saturated with the dark shades of red and a touch of purple. I looked to Dumbledore to ask another question, but he simply winked and disappeared. Soon a door opened and shut, and a man of short stature and curly blonde hair made his way towards me.
I drifted off slightly until I heard the fireplace crackle and footsteps echo from it. I sat up from the couch and Harry stepped into the light.
“I love you Sirius.”
“see ya Harry.” Neville called as he walked out the door, and Harry came back to reality.
Draco watched on as Harry cleaned, he didn’t use his wand to make the cleaning go by quicker, rather he hand washed the dishes. Draco couldn’t help but notice the defined back and shoulders of Harry, he really filled out after the war. Draco these days wasn’t quite sure what he was feelings towards Harry. At the beginning, all he wanted to do was amend the bad blood between the two, but now his plan didn’t take into account for how welcoming Harry had become and how much Draco enjoyed being in company. Talking about the war Draco never did however, somehow he was able to do that with Harry. He was able to talk to Harry about things that scared him and not be looked at as if he was weak and precious. All that Harry looked at him in was understanding, because he too had been through a similar ordeal. Draco hadn’t really realised all the pain that they both had in common, yes the pain hurt in different ways and they both coped with it differently. However, pain is pain.
Harry then realised that after walking out of the castle, that they were heading towards the quidditch field.
"Master!" He called louder this time. Harry moaned and tried rolling over, Kreacher once again called. "MASTER!" Harry shot up, his wand instantly in his hand.
"Children Ron!"
The person did pause and stepped slightly into the room, they seemed satisfied as they looked around so they closed the door and walked away. Both Draco and Harry released their breathe, their hearts were bounding so much that Harry was sure that Draco could hear his. Harry stepped away and giggled quietly, the adrenalin still rushing through his veins, Draco too started giggling and soon the pair were in fits of laughter that they had to try and keep quiet and every time they looked at each other or snorted or made a weird noise they were set off again. Eventually Harrys cheeks and stomach ached too badly that he had to force himself to calm down before he pulled a muscle. He took his glasses off and wiped away the tears that had formed, Draco too was wiping his eyes with his sleeve.
Sirius gave a puzzled look to Harry, “um what’s a hobbit?”
His eyes watered, and his lips met mine, our lips moved with harmony and the passion that I would always feel for him, our tongues danced with a lust so powerful that it could no longer be contained with our mouths. Harrys hands soon roamed down my arm and onto my back, his thin yet calloused fingers slowly running down my spine, shivers running after them. I let the moans travel from the back of my throat into his mouth, soon my shirt was being flung off my back, and so was his. His took his lips off mine and rest his forehead against mine, our chest fell and rose in rapid concessions, "Draco I want to call him James."
“Draco it’s okay it was stupid of me to act that way just because you dont like me back, I’m perfectly fine with just staying as friends.”
Harry was a bit shocked to find the man sounded quite timid, for a Professor of DADA he would think the man would be quite more confident with himself.
“You did it Ron!” Harry cheered, giving Ron a high five. Ron smiled proudly and turned to the troll.
sorry guys i really cant continue this, thankyou so much for reading and i hope that you enjoyed it!
As soon as Harry had mounted Oliver smiled and threw the snitch up into the air, Harry had the barest glimpse of the direction the now awake snitch had flown into it.
“Its just natural talent.” Ron smirked with victory.
“Thank you very kindly.” Harry nodded, playing along.
Harry finished an hour before curfew feeling chuffed. Snape wondered over and examined the jars closer than the night before.
“Hey, don’t look at me like that, that redhead is asking for it half the time!” Blaise put both his hands in the air, feigning innocence.
“What do you mean Harry? The new seeker, but I thought only second years and above could try out for the quidditch team?”
“It’s the entrance to the kitchen you idiot.” Draco teased and he popped through the hole.
"Are you okay?" I asked again, my nerves on the edge.
He chuckled too, "Then we'll call her Lilly."
“Sorry sir.” Harry looked down to his shoes, the floor of the dungeon suddenly becoming very interesting.
Then before either could say anything an elf popped in front of them.
“Hmm can I get The Hobbit?” Harry asked, plopping himself down on his bean bag, something muggle that Arthur had gifted Harry for his tenth birthday.
“Yes, hello Harry, I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time?”
Draco knocked on the door and poked his head through the corner, his eyes softened by a small smile. Harry nodded for Draco to come in, his heart pounding against his chest at the sight of Draco. “How did it go?” He asked, dropping his bag on a nearby desk. Harry sighed and took a deep breathe trying to get his heart to calm down. “I think it went pretty good, your advice really helped thank you.” Harry tried to keep the blush at bay.
Harry perked up when he heard footsteps coming from the stairs and was a little surprised to find it was Hermione. Hermione smiled at the sight of Harry and she strolled over to him, her arms full of books.
“Oh, this is far too much.” Harry laughed awkwardly, the elf frowned and Harry realised he had made a mistake.
"What's his name?" She asked. I looked to Harry as I answered her. "James Scorpius Malfoy-Potter."
Harry leaned forward, his lips connected to mine. Our lips moved together in a feverish fashion, the slight taste of salt on my lips electrified the kiss, his hands moved from mine to my cheeks, his thumbs rubbing circles sending light shivers down my spine.
“You must be confident, with yourself and with the broom or it will never obey you.” Hooch called out. Harry took a step closer to Hermione not caring if he got in trouble.
I take another deep breath, we need to talk about this I keep telling myself, I don't care the consequences, I don't care if puts a wall between us, I need to say how I feel, and he needs to know.
Half an hour passed by and Draco soon found sleep weighing him down. Finally, he admitted defeat and placed the book he was reading into his draw. However, before he pulled the curtains close a soft knock came from his door.
“Yes sir.” Harry said finally finding his voice. He went to the table and placed the black apron on, he struggled a little to tie it but once he had he went into the supply cupboard and began to take a few jars to take back his desk.
The crack echoed around the empty apartment, Harry stumbled slightly forward, perhaps he had too much champagne. Draco chuckled and pulled him up right. "All right love?" Harry chuckled back and stood up right. "Yeah one too many champagnes." Draco tutted, "Of course you did." He shook his head and made way to their bedroom, Sirius curled on their bed opened one eye to see who was waking him from his slumber than closed it again. Draco sighed, no matter how many times he told Sirius off for being on their bed he continued to sleep there. Draco began to wonder if he was doing it to make him annoyed on purpose, but this night he was in too much of a good mood to kick him off.
"Harry thank god, we need you immediately we've caught on where Icarus is!"
(See the end of the chapter for
“For an eleven-year-old you are a pretty good teacher.” Hooch murmured to him.
“Sleep well?” Harry asked. Dracos cheeks brightened slightly.
“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said calmy, however he wasn’t finished yet. “But if you would like to be my friend you’re gonna have to be nicer to mine.” And with this he shook Malfoys hand. Malfoys mouth opened with shock, and a slight blush tinged his cheeks. Malfoy huffed slightly offended and left the carriage with the air of a prince. Ron watched on now more amused than offended.
Draco looked to me. "Who are you saying thank you too?"
Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly and stood. ‘I think im going to go now, see you tomorrow Draco.”
Feeling satisfied he opened the door and quietly stepped out of it but gasped as he found himself facing a very angry troll.
Harry barked out a laugh. “Light reading? That’s more like reading a library.”
The shop owner nodded his head. "Interesting name, however, it appears that Snow likes it." Snow hopped onto my shoulder and rubbed his feathers against my cheek affectionately, I chuckled and rubbed his feathers back.
"How you been Hagrid?" Harry beamed, he hadn't realised how much he had missed the great big oaf. The two sat and caught up for the years that had been lost, Hagrid cried again thinking about how he had to carry what he thought was a dead Harry, Harry too let a few tears slip. The bell chimed for the commencement of the sorting ceremony.
“It’s just boring tiss all.” Draco waved his spoon around, and Harry shrugged, he didn’t find Dumbledore boring at all.
“Harry?” Draco asked, Harry turned to him, oh he had zoned out whilst Draco was talking to him.
Harry nodded his head at the second-year girl as she smiled at him and quickly rushed away. Harry started to leave, now his mind pondered about this girl. Why would a Slytherin girl be in the Gryffindor common rooms?
Soon steps could be heard rushing towards them, Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape soon faced them with shocked expressions on their faces.
“Are you sure that's a real spell?” The girl said and continued, “well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”
“Yes hello… Caput Draconis.” Spoke the Headboy and the portrait swung open.
“Wow that’s cool, I’ve never read them before, do you mind if I borrow them?”
They made their way to the Great Hall, stomachs once again rumbling with hunger. Harry wandered his eyes over to the Slytherin table to find Draco, which he did, however the table was pretty full and Harry wasn’t stupid enough to go wander over to a table full of Slytherins. The trio all sat together and began piling their plates with lunch.
"Harry touch me again." Draco breathed out.
I turn around and put my hand onto his cheek, he closes his eyes and presses his hand against mine. "We still have a lot of talking to do."
Ron looked away from the window, his face still full of excitement. “Well yeah I’m going to miss them obviously, but I’m more excited than anything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We would be liking some lunch as we missed some.” Draco said in his posh voice.
This time with a determination he didn't know he had he looked sharply into Harrys eyes that quickly glazed over, "what would happen If I liked you back?" Draco's heart thrashed against his chest, Harrys face split into a wide smile, Draco wasn't sure if he ever seen him smile so wide and openly before.
"How have you been Harry?" She continued. Harry looked up and thought whether or not to answer her honestly. "Good as I can be I guess." He shrugged. Then he remembered something that turned the conversation around. "Hey I heard you got drafted into the Harpies." Ginnys face lit up.
This made Harry feel better slightly, but also nervous, what was Snape going to make him do for two weeks? Hermione gave him some encouraging words before he started heading down to Snapes office after receiving a note stating that he was to meet with him at his office.
“I’m the master of lying Harry, if one is to survive one must know how to lie.”
I chuckled, "What if it's a girl?"
“Okay all first years we’ll lead the way to the dormitories, please follow in an orderly fashion!”
“Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed!” George said, sliding in next to Fred.
“Is it true? They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So, it’s you, is it?” The boy spoke as if he had just had tea and biscuits with the queen. Ron sniggered at him, finding it amusing but Harry was taught better than to laugh at others.
Harry just nodded his head, not knowing how to reply to him.
“Yes that is true i was in Professor Malfoys room last night, but we only had dinner…” He directed this towards Rebecca, “and after as old people tend to do we fell asleep by the fire.”
The boys did not go without punishment, eventually they were caught whilst trying to sneak back to class. Harry and Draco had split off at this point, with Harry heading towards the Transfiguration classroom and Draco to Charms. Harry when about to round the corner to his classroom was stopped by a droning deep voice.
I stuck out my bottom lip, "but I can't help it, you're too beautiful to not look at." I whined back. His blush deepened, and his gray eyes averted mine.
Harry gasped awake, sweat drenched his shirt and pillow, his breathing sharp and fast. He couldn’t remember exactly what he had been dreaming about, but he knew that it was no good dream. Harrys head felt too clouded for him to think about anything clearly, he reached over popped on his glasses and got out of his bed as quietly as he could.
“Oh really, that’s never happened to you before has it?” Ron worriedly said.
The days ends and Harry goes back to his rooms, he had somehow managed to avoid Draco at dinner by simply not showing up. A patronus made its way through his open window, its Minervas. Harry nods at the patronus with the message being crossed and it dissipates.
“Come Hermione’s probably waiting for us in the common room.” Harry got up and packed his books for their last lesson of the day, which was History of Magic, he didn’t want to have to come back up here after lunch.
“Hey wait up.” Harry lightly jogged, Draco was walking extremely fast for somehow who typically liked to save face. Draco slowed down and turned to Harry a more relaxed expression to his face.
“I don’t know, it’s a bit odd for me to be friends with you I suppose.” Draco shrugged lightly.
“Of course, you side with your new best friend!” Ron hissed out before storming off.
The boys left the dorm and greeted Hermione who was sitting reading her History of Magic textbook by the fire.
"Fuck Harry." He moaned, he wrapped his legs around my hips and grinded against me. I moaned softly and took the lead, laying him down on the bed and removing his pants. (A.N. this is a censored version XD )
Hermione just looked at him and made no further comment. The both sat in comfortable silence this time.
They both sat in silence until the bell rang for first period, Draco did not need to worry about getting ready just yet as he did not have a first period. However, Harry did.
A house elf poked him in the cheek. “Professor Potter needs to wake up.” The elf squeaked, feeling conflicted in having to poke the professor in order to wake him up. Harry moaned and swatted the hand away, the elf squeaked again, this time in shock. Harry grumbled something that could not be understood and slowly opened his eyes. “Dobby?” Harry mumbled incoherently. The elf quickly shook his tiny head. “No professor I am not Dobby, I am Winnie.” The elf bowed their head.
“Oh, hello Harry, you excited?” She said, a polite smile on her face.
Harry’s hand slightly shook as he popped the buttons of his off white dress shirt into their designated holes, he tucked his shirt into his jeans, he had pondered for a while whether he should have chosen dress pants, but had decided jeans would be more comfortable and less awkward. Harry still didnt know why he was flustered around Draco when he had never been before when they were teens, but he had come to a conclusion that he had developed an attraction for Draco.
Harrys deep green eyes watered more, and he sniffed even more loudly. “I love you both too.”
“Just a little longer mum.” He moaned.
Sirius turned to him and nearly spilt the cup of water.
“What on earth is going on?!” McGonagall exclaimed, looking from the sleeping Troll to the three first years students.
As Harry walked behind McGonagall into the great hall all chatter slowly died down and curious eyes plastered to him. Harry kept his head low, he sat down into an empty seat next to a Professor that he did not know. The professor with a bright smile extended out her hand and smiled, "I'm the transfiguration teacher Professor Greer, but you can call me Myra." Harry smiled back at her and shook her hand. McGonagall stood and called the attention of the students, she made a few small announcements and then commenced lunch. The food quickly appeared, Harrys stomach growled and he quickly but politely dug into the array of food that was may more appetising than the usual dinners that Kreacher presented. Harry leaned over slightly to see the other Professors. Flitwick still present, Professor Sprout and beside her Neville Longbottom, Harry momentarily surprised but then remembered that he had been training under her eye for this year preparing him to replace her at the end of year. Harry's eyes continued to wonder through the teachers until they landed on someone that he had not expected them to land on.
Harry eyed the boys behind the skinny one, they were the complete opposite of him, thickset and beady eyed. The boy noticing perked up slightly, seeming to have gotten to his favourite part.
Harry suddenly feeling the tiredness leave gathered the discarded paper quill and ink from the kitchen table and sat down to write a return letter to Malfoy.
Feeling exhilarated Harry made way back to the field, his fellow Gryffindors cheering, the Slytherins just frowning, all except Draco who had a neutral expression on his face.
“Me either.” Harry agreed.
“Alright alright, I’ll say sorry to him if I have too.”
"Jeez you really love your bacon don't you love?" Draco looked semi-disgusted as he watched me chew on my heavenly toast. I only nodded my head, as I knew how much Draco hated when I spoke with my mouth full of food. Draco and I finished the rest of our food in silence. Draco finished before me and went to get ready whilst I finished munching on my bacon toast. He emerged out of our bedroom in casual clothing, over the years of our relationship I had slowly coaxed him into dressing with muggle clothes, however he still kept his fashion quite high standard for muggle clothing.
Harry mumbled and turned violently in his sleep, Draco knew this was a sign that he was having a nightmare, Draco knew the signs all too well.
“So, what’s wrong with that?”
"Oi Harry!" He called, Harry turned and smiled at Neville. Neville had grown into a person that he barely recognised since the war had ended, however at the same time he was still the forgetful and clumsy Neville that he always knew.
“You would do quite well in Slytherin.” The hat spoke again. Harrys heart dropped. “Not Slytherin!” He whispered.
Harry turned to Draco, his emerald eyes searching him peculiarly. “Yeah what’s up?” Harry continued to pack his bag as he waited to for Draco to ask him about this something.
Harry, Ron and Hermione spent the rest of the feast getting to know each other more and talking about things that interested them. Harry was pleased to see that Ron was warming up to Hermione much more than before.
I gulped nervously and nodded my head in understanding. The man took a key off his belt and slowly unlocked the key to the cage, he grabbed the owl with his wings pressed against his body to stop him from flying away and gently placed him on my outstretched arm. The bird sat there and looked me directly in the eyes, his dark red eyes swimming in my green ones, for some reason I could not look away. No matter how intimidated I felt, I couldn't look away. I felt his claws slowly dig into my arm, but release. He did this a couple of times, my heart racing, my patience on the edge and my blood pounding to the tips of my fingertips. Then all of a sudden, he gave a soft hoot and rubbed his beak against the side of my cheek, I let out the breath that I was holding and rubbed my cheek against his beak.
