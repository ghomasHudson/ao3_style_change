Draco was about to swear to it, but didn’t have to as Harry had stopped in his tracks, momentarily looking between his red headed best friend and the arrogant slytherin who he’d not dare to speak to on this fine morning.
“You think you can do whatever you want and the rest of us are just supposed to take it,” Harry seethed, “I think it’s time that you have to take what you’re given without being able to do anything about it.”
Harry nodded, putting a finger under Draco’s chin and lifting his head so he could kiss him. “You were amazing. Didn’t quite see you as the daddy kink type, but I don’t mind. I’m sure I’ll get used to it quite quickly.”
Harry would do no such thing, as he was sitting on the bed that he had arranged to be there before Draco came. It had nothing more than dark green silk sheets and pillows with matching dark green silk pillowcases.
“You still point out the obvious,” Harry retorts bitterly, “did you come here to watch me drink tea?”
Harry could throw up. In fact he turned to Oliver, seeing that he heard what Harry was hearing as well. He shared a look with Harry, nearly bursting out into a laugh when Harry fake gagged. He was about to continue his theatrics when he heard the way Draco responded, stopping him in his tracks.
“Amazes me every time,” Harry agreed, groaning when Draco moaned around him again, “takes it like a pro, too.”
After he had taken his wand he followed the Slytherin to the front of the room where there was a space big enough for them to play this game.
He turned to grab his bag, nearly knocking Malfoy into the set of lockers. He grabbed the other boy's waist to keep him up, pulling Malfoy into himself.
Ron rolled his eyes at that, knowing Draco and Harry were anything but friends. Nonetheless, Draco wasn’t giving Ron anything to say that he really wasn’t going to try and fuck Harry.
Draco moaned loudly, letting out a string of curses as Harry repeatedly slammed into him. He watched as Draco scrunched his eyes closed, mouth hung open in an “o” shape with no audible sound coming out.
Draco hesitated but obeyed after a moment,  placing his hands about his shoulder-length apart onto the crooked, cracked wood of the desk. He scoffed at having to touch the tarnished material.
Draco smiled and ran his fingers through the smaller boy’s hair. He gave him a gentle kiss as he moved inside him for the first time. Harry let out a small moan into his mouth, causing Draco to smirk as he swallowed it eagerly.
He pulled away slightly, only to look at Ron, “he doesn’t need more than two, he likes it a little rough.”
He was lost. Because as Draco was everywhere,  Ron was nowhere. He would feel featherlight touches caress what skin was already exposed, but then they’d be gone, never exposing more.
“While you’re looking around,” Harry spoke, catching the blonde's attention once again, “could I show you the door?”
Harry could practically feel his blood boil at the comment, turning and staring daggers at Malfoy, “You left!” He blurted out, “A year ago, you left.”
Harry’s plan went out the window as he started to feel himself grow in his pants. His thoughts were now only focused on one thing as he slowly and quietly undressed: Draco. Once he was fully nude he stepped over to Draco, quickly eyeing the way he was laying: on his stomach with one leg hitched up higher than the other.
Before he could beg some more, Harry used the hand that was already in his hair to push Draco’s head into the pillows, affectively shutting him up as he picked up his pace. He could vaguely hear Draco’s muffled whimpers mixing with the harsh slapping of skin-on-skin.
“You came,” Harry said, startling Draco as it was quite dark in the room. Harry waved his wand, candles lighting up around the room and illuminating both of the boy’s faces.
Draco quirked an eyebrow at that, taking a step forward and effectively pinning the smaller man to the stone wall behind him. Harry noticeably shrank, not expecting this at all. Draco's smirk grew as he noticed.
He let his head fall back as he rode Draco, a warm hand running over the marks Draco had made on him and soothing kisses being pressed to them from behind. Harry could tell that Draco was close, could feel the way he tried to push his hips up into Harry but wasn’t able to do it for long.
Harry nodded, words stuck in his throat. He was sure that if he opened his eyes he would see himself staring down at his own body, wondering when he’d be able to come back down.
Draco let out a small whimper as Harry kept him in place. That’s exactly what Harry was waiting for.
“I’m sorry,” Draco starts, taking a sip of the tea which he had already let get somewhat cold, “for everything… For leaving without saying anything. For worrying you. For breaking your heart…”
Harry looked dazed already, and in an odd sort of way, Draco found it cute. He leaned down to kiss Harry as Ron spit onto his fingers, coating them thoroughly before placing one at Harry’s entrance.
When Draco did nothing but eye him back, Harry sighed, “Alright, I’ll bite. What brings you over to my desk?” He asked sarcastically.
“Yes,” Draco agreed, “I suppose so…” He seemed to think for a moment before he lit up, making Harry shake his head immediately.
He explored it for a moment before he pulled away, sending a wink in Harry's direction before backing away.
Harry took a minute before moving off of him, but as soon as he did he was all over him once again. This time though it was less rough as he planted kisses on Draco’s cheeks, forehead, and finally his lips. He kissed Draco breathless as Ron cast a cleaning spell. Once they were clean Ron joined them, letting Draco give him a nod of approval before smothering him in kisses as well.
It was almost pitch dark when Draco made his way into Harry’s room. The only light was a small desk lamp where the boy of the hour himself was sitting, head in his hands.
Harry smiled at the blissful look Draco had on his face. He couldn’t seem to stop himself from leaning in and peppering the other boys face with feather-light kisses, pecking his lips tenderly and pulling back.
It was through gritted teeth that Draco agreed. This was humiliating. The one person he couldn’t stand in the least had him bent over a shabby desk, spanking him. He must have been absolutely mad.
Within a second, Harry's sweater was off of him, and on the floor, Draco taking one of the pink buds in his mouth and pinching the other between two of his fingers, switching once he was satisfied that it was swollen.
He spread the spit over Harry's cock, wrapping his hand around it and stroking in time with his thrusts. Harry whined and dropped his face into Draco's neck, the familiar feeling coming back and making him feel tingly as he groaned.
Today was Friday. Harry had managed to avoid Draco for a good part of the day. That only changed when Fred and George insisted he come to the common room to join all the boys in a few good games. After a few games of truth or dare with just the Gryffindors, a few Slytherins decided to join, and of course, Draco had his sights set on Harry. That would be how Harry embarrassed himself in front of everyone by giving Ron a lap dance.
“What was that?” Harry asked though he heard it loud and clear this time, “was that a whimper I just heard?”
Draco held him tightly with one arm as he brought his hand back up to Harry's mouth. The latter opened it as two fingers slipped in, being coated with saliva.
“Calm down, love, you’re okay,” He soothed, noting that the realization that this was happening had just hit Harry, and like a ton of bricks Draco guessed. He’d put 10 galleons on Harry panicking more because he was allowing himself to have this. He was letting Draco take him.
“I got a kick out of it,” Draco responded, tugging his bottom lip between his teeth as Blaise gave him a puppy-dog look.
This made Draco smirk, and Harry didn’t like it one bit, “They get to punish the loser however they see fit.”
He took a minute to catch his breath before he pulled out of Draco and let go of his jaw. He got off of him and turned to throw his underwear back on when he heard a throat being cleared.
Draco could sense Harry's shyness, and he brushed it off by pulling the latter into him. He planted a soft kiss on Harry's plush lips, relishing in the way Harry gave into him, immediately opening his mouth and letting Draco slip his tongue inside.
The taller boy smirked but shook his head, "head up, I wanna see your face when you come on my cock."
Once he had done that he came back to Harry and sat on his lap. Harry looked up at him, his hands finding their place on his waist before one made its way to the back of Draco’s head. He pulled Draco down into a kiss, deepening it before he flipped them.
He rolled his eyes, beckoning Draco to follow him with the wave of two fingers. He then excused himself from his friends, walking out and waiting to be met. He waited for a minute before the heavy doors opened with a groan, closing with another as Draco stepped outside of them.
Harry held his breath as Draco bottomed out, letting out a moan once he started to move. His thrusts started out gentle, but that quickly changed as he angled them, hitting the other boy's prostate and making him nearly scream.
Draco released his nipple, licking over both of them to soothe them then pulling away and letting Ron have his own fun.
They both said nothing, but Ron did reach for his robe. He lifted up the side of it, showing his house emblem. Harry raised an eyebrow at him before catching on and looking down at his own robe.
Harry almost felt bad as he saw Draco’s puffy eyes and red cheeks. But then he thought back through the week and was pushing in again. It amazed him that Draco was able to make the exact same face as the first time. It was sort of amusing, really.
Draco shook his head as best as he could. He felt as if he was to obey Harry he would spontaneously combust, but really what choice did he have.
“Potter? Potter!” Draco gritted out, wiggling his body in a futile attempt to get Harry off of him, “You’ve got to be kidding me. Get off of me!”
It was to no avail, as even though Harry was slightly shorter he was much stronger. He let Draco panic for a moment before he took pity on him, leaning down and whispering for him to be still. He did once he recognized the voice, panic quickly switching to confusion.
Draco barely met Harry’s eyes as he quickly threw on his t-shirt. He tried to avoid him as he walked past, but Harry grabbed his arm.
Harry felt something light inside him as he grabbed Draco’s ass and lifted him just enough so that he could plow into him from beneath.
“Bet you could take more than just this,” he continued, “bet you could take a couple of rounds… or maybe even another cock.”
Harry and Ron shared a look as he thought about it. How and where could he get the chance to touch Draco? Draco would surely pummel him if he even tried. As if reading his mind, Ron piped up.
Ron looked at him, nodding slowly before he was up and pushing Harry back onto the bed, Draco nearly being squished.
Harry couldn’t complain that Ron took his time, he was in heaven. Draco sucked cock much the same way he took dick; perfectly. He ran his tongue up the underside of Harry’s cock before engulfing it whole, waiting a minute at the base before pushing himself down even further just to make himself choke. Harry groaned as he heard Draco gag around him, knowing that if he was able to, Draco would have his hands on him too somehow.
Harry cleared his throat, not knowing what to say. All his emotions were fighting at the moment, a mix of anger, sadness, relief, confusion clouding his head and heart. Finally, he got out the only words that he could.
Harry said nothing, raising his eyebrows instead in a silent agreement of the statement. He took a minute to eye what Draco was wearing (black pants, tailored to perfection of course, and a black button-up. His expensive boots clicked on his way through the doors, Harry noted right away) before stepping forward and letting his wand slide out of his own sleeve.
Draco forced himself to open his eyes as Harry relentlessly kept his pace. He pulled out subtly, making Draco whine loudly at the loss.
Draco grabbed Harry by his shirt sleeve, pushing him to sit on the bed as he straddled his thighs. Draco gave Harry a comforting smile as he leaned in and kissed him.
Harry smirked as he slid his now fully-hard cock against Draco’s bum, hearing the way Draco seemed to take a breath but not let it back out, “Well, I came here to get back at you, but I think I’ve found something much more interesting.”
“Potter,” Draco managed through what could have been a sob or a cough, “i-it hurts, please, I c-can’t,”
Draco placed his fingers under Harry’s chin, bringing him away from his chest then sliding one hand down. He pinched one of Harry’s nipples between his fingers, watching with delight as Harry’s mouth hung open in an ‘o’ shape.
He must like Draco somewhat, he thought, because he aligned the colors perfectly with Slytherin house colors. He could gag at the thought of actually liking Draco Malfoy if it was a few years earlier.
Harry's eyes slipped closed, breathing deeply as all he could smell was Draco and all he could feel was Draco and all he could think was Draco.
Once Draco pulled out Harry was making grabby hands at him, causing a groggy chuckle to escape the blonde's lips.
“Go on then,” Ron prompted, “cum for me, and then I’m going to fill you up so deep you’ll feel me inside you for days. Is that what you want, love?”
Nothing was said as Ron reached into the bedside table, rummaging around while Harry stripped out of his own clothes. Draco simply watched, careful to not speak as he was told. He figured he had given Harry enough turmoil for at least two more hours or so.
Ron nods, though nothing is said out loud, and lays his head in his palm as he looks aimlessly around the room. He lands on one particular figure who is also looking at the door where Harry had just exited. If Ron hadn’t noticed it three or so nights ago, then maybe he would be surprised, but right now he was just curious.
Draco nodded and set himself down, slowly lowering himself on Harry’s cock. Somehow, at this angle, he felt even bigger and Draco felt even more full. He stopped once he was sat flush against Harry’s thighs.
Draco moved to turn his face into the pillow, being stopped by Harry gripping onto his jaw and holding his head in place.
Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t have to for Draco to know, because right after he finished his sentence Harry was coming, hard.
This was new for him, and he cursed as Draco moved elegantly into the room. He followed him, stopping just behind him as his eyes landed on his best friend.
Draco nodded, nearly beaming as Harry praised him with a “good boy.” He slipped off the bed languidly before removing every article of his clothing and taking his place once again, this time on his stomach.
He had done a pretty good job at the latter, eating rather quickly in the dining hall, not sparing time for eye-contact and invitations to bicker. He was quite proud of himself for managing to go a full three days with no mouth from the mouthiest wizard that he knew of. It was almost a full four days that he was going to pride himself on... Almost.
“Oh,” Madam Pomfrey stopped them, “stay out of trouble! I don’t want to see you two back in this class for another hour!”
He had profusely apologized for being late and after being threatened with detention if he so much as the thought of being late again he was let go to sulk to the back of the classroom and slide into a seat beside Oliver.
“Stay like that for us, love,” Ron instructed, popping open the cap of the lube he had also grabbed and spreading it over two of his fingers.
The locker room was hazy as the last of the boys cleared out of it. The only thing keeping it somewhat clear was the opening and closing of the door as the boys left. Harry was the last one there, still getting dressed after his shower. At least he thought he was.
Harry turned to place his cup in the sink, focusing on the tea-stained rim on the bottom rather than the sinking feeling in his chest, “I didn’t want to, but you were never fully happy with our relationship,”
He watched as Draco followed his orders. He waved his hand smoothly, tinting the windows in the classroom and putting a temporary silencing charm on the small room. Once he was satisfied he walked to the back and stood behind Draco, getting close enough to talk in his ear.
He groaned into Harry’s skin, tears freely flowing now as pleasure built in his stomach. He was moaning and sobbing as his cock was an angry red against his stomach.
“What are you doing in here?” Harry asked, looking at Draco before his eyes landed on the red-headed boy, “Ron?”
Harry was sick of Draco. So, what was he to do other than come up with a plan to embarrass the cunning Slytherin? Nothing, that’s what.
Harry huffed. If Ron didn’t show up in the next thirty seconds he was sure he would kill Draco rather than fuck him. He wasn’t one-hundred percent certain he wouldn’t end up doing both. Luckily for Draco, Ron was coming in a moment later.
Ron changed his angle, hitting Harry’s prostate straight on as Draco tugged on his hard bud. They both revealed in the squeal that Harry let out.
Harry walked quietly under the cloak, making sure to not make any sort of noise as he stepped into Draco’s room. Draco had his own room as opposed to having to share a dorm; Daddy’s money came in handy once again. It was dark in the room, the only light being the pale moon shining through what little bit of window Draco’s silk curtains weren’t covering.
“I-I know, don’t need it,” even though his thighs were burning he kept going, so close to cumming, “please, need to cum,”
Draco nodded, pulling Harry closer and kissing his neck as he finally slipped inside. Draco arched his back as Harry bottomed out, whining about how big he is.
Draco merely rolled his eyes, pushed himself off the desk with a huff, and made his way to the front of the room. He knocked on the biggest desk in the room, once on the top left side and twice in the middle. He knocked once more, a bit too loudly for Harry’s liking, and the desktop popped open.
Harry used a spell to quickly open and close the classroom window as the two boys watched the owl fly out of it with the snake in its possession still.
He let his head fall back onto Potter’s shoulder, no longer being able to hold back his noises. He was, however, able to keep his hips still. He fought to not cant them up into the warm fist that enveloped him and made good work on getting him off.
Draco obeyed, pearly white streaks falling over Harry’s hand and his own thighs. Harry stroked him through it, milking every last drop out before letting him go. He took his hand away, whispering a cleaning spell and petting his now clean hand through Draco’s sweaty hair as he came back down.
He looked around discreetly, his eyes landing on none other than Draco and… Blaise? Harry’s eyebrows wrinkled as he tried to hear bits of their conversation. He cringed as Draco laughed again. He had met Blaise, been around him plenty of times, and he wasn’t as funny as Draco was making him out to be now.
Ron slumped at the dinner table, not touching his dinner as he sulkily watched his best friend jump up from the table and scurry out of the dining hall. It had been three days in a row that Harry had done this, along with barely talking to Hermione or himself, and it was worrying Ron immensely.
He sat back on Harry’s lap quickly, not wanting to give the other boy too much time to look at his naked form. He wasn’t sure why he was worried about his modesty in the position he was in, anyway.
Harry pulled away from Draco as Oliver came back into sight, mumbling that he forgot his jersey before leaving once again.
That's all Draco said to him as he picked him up, Harry jumping and wrapping his legs around his waist. He lowered the Gryffindor back down onto his length, immediately finding his prostate once again before he sped up his thrusts, going significantly rougher than he was before.
“I said I’d get you in there next time, have the two of us take our turn with him, you know, have our way.”
“Yes, me and Harry, now listen,” Draco looked around before dragging Ron closer to him, “you should’ve seen him, Ron. The way he responded to me talking about having him take more…”
Draco went to deny it but whimpered again as Harry pressed his head against his shoulder, smirking into his skin as he moved his leg between Draco’s thighs.
Harry smirked, “it’s a game of transfiguration. I have two needles in my pocket, one for you and one for myself. All you have to do is make it into a potion.”
“I’m going to fucking wreck you, and you’re going to take it,” Harry said as he pulled out to the tip, “you’re going to be my little fuck toy for as long as I want tonight.”
So, Draco had to be Draco and point it out. After getting on his nerves long enough (and threatened that he and the other Slytherins would gather around a fire at night and chant out Ronald Weasley, Ronald Weasley…) he got it out of him. Turns out Ron had never been with another guy and was curious. He was going to ask Harry for help, as Harry was the only one he trusted, but then Draco came along.
With that, Draco was gone. Now that he was into the empty halls he could breath normally. Why had he told Potter he’d come back if there was no game to lure him in?
“You’re going to have to use your words if you want to cum, love,” Ron said, picking up his pace and only making it worse for Harry as he tried to form them, “only good boys get to cum, Harry.”
“As funny as it was to see Potter wearing it, you definitely look better in it,” Blaise complimented, nudging Draco’s hand with his own.
I really don't ever review my stuff after I write it, so please ignore spelling and/or grammar mistakes. I have one brain cell and it's doing its absolute best right now. Thank you, my loves.
He looked up to see Draco staring at his own leg where Harry’s hand was, then looking up with rosy cheeks and wide eyes. Harry gave a quick apology before he looked away. He stayed silent as Draco finished the potion, waiting for class to be over.
Harry scooted closer, finally able to hear what the two of them were going on about. He listened quietly to their conversation, careful to not be suspicious.
“Please, no!” Draco cried out as Harry pistoned his hips forward, burying himself inside of Draco once again, “you’re going to split me open, please!”
“You’re the one who wanted to try this in the first place,” Harry reminded as he slipped into bed beside the blonde, “so I think that qualifies you as one too.”
Ron and Draco gave him a confused look, to which he responded in a serious tone (it was really a joke to them, but if Draco pulls another stunt that might change).
You know how I mentioned that it took two and a half hours for Draco to make Harry mad? Well, actually, try half an hour. It started when Harry woke up later than Draco, which he learned quickly to never ever do. But he had, and now that it was already 8:10 in the morning, he was pushed to get dressed and get to the great hall for his already-cold breakfast. So, frantically, he threw on his clothes and house robe. He didn’t bother looking in the mirror before rushing out the door, messing with his hair the whole way down the long corridors.
Draco let out a small groan as Harry sucked on his fingers, watching the way his mouth took them expertly. He focused his eyes on the pink tongue that was circling his digits, regrettably pulling them away once they were wet enough.
“You’ve not changed much,” Draco stated from his place at the table, “aside from the coldness that radiates from you.”
Ron gave him a suspicious look, to which he received a smug smirk and a wink. He sighed, watching as Draco slipped past the portrait into the Gryffindor rooms.
Draco shivered at the venom in Harry’s voice, “Potter, please, not like this. I’ll leave you alone, I promise, just stop,”
Harry was spent. He was practically lithe, but he kissed Draco’s cheek and met his thrusts a total of four times before they were both coming.
Draco could see why Harry wanted to prep him. As he looked down at Harry’s cock, his eyes nearly rolled back into his head. Harry was big, and he was sure Harry would make good on wrecking him.
Harry was half-hard already as Draco gave him a firm squeeze. As much as he wanted to give in to the strong hands that were already on him, he couldn’t help but turn to the other boy in the room.
He was heading down the corridor, steps seeming much louder than they actually were as his heart was pounding in his chest; he always did hate sneaking out. He could see the large doors, almost reach out and touch them, and was about to before something yanked him back and into an empty room.
Draco pulled out softly, brushing the sweaty brown hair from the smaller boy's face. He brushed his knuckles over Harry’s cheekbone before planting a soft kiss on his forehead.
The two boys hardly listened as Madam Pomfrey scolded them. Draco was vaguely aware that she was more-so ranting about having more important things to tend to on a Friday afternoon at three in the afternoon. Draco was also aware of the half considerate, half suspicious look she gave him when he suggested that she go ahead and take care of her “important matters.”
Draco’s eyes widened at being called a good boy. Why on earth was that so hot? It must have been because just as Harry landed strike seven, his cock gave an interested twitch before beginning to respond.
Harry nodded, looking down at Draco who definitely seemed completely lost. He heard Ron speak up enough for Draco to hear him, “are you close, darling? Want to cum for us?”
He couldn't remember when he had started to find the blonde attractive, but those feelings were definitely not helping his current situation.
Harry turned them over so Draco was on top and straddling his thighs. He lifted Draco and placed him above his cock.
"And you will," He answered, removing his other hand from the wall and now placing them both on the Gryffindor's hips, "I just want to play a little game first."
Harry couldn't possibly understand what Draco was getting at, but whatever got him out of there fast was what he would go with.
“Was there ever really an us when you left so easily?” Harry questioned, “I really couldn’t be upset, could I?”
Harry thought about it. He looked at Ron for an amount of time that could definitely be considered creepy before letting out a sigh and leaning into the other male.
“We had to hide. Always. You were always so worried someone would catch our glances or see the way we kept close to each other. I always wondered when you’d say enough.”
Harry knew when Ron was ready because Draco whined around him when Ron pulled his fingers out.  He shifted back for more as much as he could without giving up Harry’s cock. He had no choice though as Harry grabbed his hair and pulled him off of him. He couldn’t care to be mad at him for breaking his rule as he heard the way Draco whined like a slut from the loss of touch from both of the men.
Ron thought for a moment before he whispered his question, “did that make him hot?” He asked, not sure how to phrase it.
Though neither of them was looking at each other, Harry and Ron could both tell the other was smiling at their boy.
“How am I supposed to know?” Ron defended himself, “you’ve been with Harry for two months and you still don’t like him sometimes.”
He heard Draco inhale sharply as he looked down at where his hand had landed, screaming at himself to remove it but seemingly frozen where he was. He didn’t dare look at the blonde as he finally moved his hand.
Harry could hear Draco, but more than that he could feel him. Feel his teeth leaving marks along the expanse of his neck, feel his fingers making their way under his shirt to tug it off, and feel the warmth of his body as it seemed to encase his own.
“Oh, alright,” Harry gave in, reaching underneath Draco and untying him, “but only because you’ve been so good.”
It was stupid and not well thought out. Ron could admit that, but that didn’t stop him from stealing the invisibility cloak and sliding it over himself, wrapping it around himself completely. He hoped that Harry didn’t get on an adventure kick and want to go out tonight like he himself was doing at the very moment.
His gaze then fell on Draco who was already looking at him in what he would proudly call astonishment. He bit back a smirk as he slid his wand safely up into his sleeve.
As Draco laid on the other side of Harry, he draped his arm over him. On the other side, his hand brushed against Ron’s, and rather than pulling away, he laced their fingers together.
Harry bit down gently, leaving a mark on Draco’s pale throat and eliciting a whimper from the boy. Harry did it again in another place, loving the sounds Draco was making.
That was around two months ago. Since then, at least three times a week (but usually more), either Draco or Harry was sharing their bed with the other. They kissed and even hung out when they weren’t busy with other things. By all definitions, they were dating, but nothing official. It had changed a few weeks ago though as Draco had caught the way Ron looked at them. It had changed from a while ago, now he looked at them differently.
Harry thought through all the ridiculous games Draco and his goons had come up with over the years and he didn’t recognize this one. He nodded for Draco to explain, earning a giddy smile from the pale boy.
They nodded at each other before stepping forward and getting on either side of the bed, and either side of Draco. He looked at each of them before he chose to keep eye contact with Harry. He tilted his head to the side in a silent question of ‘is someone going to tell me what we’re doing?’
Draco rolled his eyes, leaning back on the bed on his elbows. Keeping himself propped up, he looked between Ron and Harry, wondering where this was going. He wasn’t exactly sure what he and Harry were if he’s being honest. It all started with a drunken kiss at a Quidditch celebration party. Harry had taken Draco to his dorm that night, waking up poor Ron with the sounds of a squeaking bed and a moaning Slytherin.
Ever since Harry had found the pages of blank paper encrypted inside the brown leather of the worn-out journal, well, he had been different. He spent all his time scribbling in it, waving Ron off with some nonsense to get him to leave him be. He had done the same with Hermione, giving her a small smile and saying he’d be all hers in a matter of minutes.
“This is a joke…” Harry said, but he knew it wasn’t. Judging by the way Draco was nipping at his neck and Ron was pulling off his jeans it most certainly was not a joke.
He blushed pink as he scurried away from them, Ron returning his stare back to the blonde haired boy. This time it was a stare of utter disbelief.
Harry prodded at Draco’s entrance, slipping his first finger in and relishing the way Draco moaned. He smirked as he started up a pace, watching the way Draco reacted.
“Fuck, you’re tight,” Harry breathed out, working in his second finger much too soon, “can’t imagine how you’ll take all of me.”
Draco was quick to place his cock where Ron’s had just moved from. He rubbed it over Harry’s hole, listening as Harry gave a tired whine.
Harry bit his lip as he took a quick chance. He angled his hand a bit and landed his last strike. It was a little too close to Draco’s balls, and he knew that, but he hadn’t angled his hand for nothing. He nearly groaned as he heard the gasp Draco gave below him, quickly covering it up with a shaky, “ten!”
Harry stepped back a mere inch as Draco stood and pulled his trousers back up, adjusting them to his liking. Harry stepped back close to him once he was settled, taking Draco’s chin into his hand and having him look at him.
Malfoy was only in a towel, and though the room was already hot, his skin burned with something different. He nearly whimpered as Harry’s fingers skimmed his skin as they dropped from their hold on him.
“No,” Ron dismissed him, “if you’re going to find out for sure, it needs to be in front of someone. That way, he can’t deny it.”
Draco was near boneless as he slung his arms around Harry, not caring that he was pulling him down to where he could barely move on him. Ron was doing a great job alone, having found his prostate and assaulting it as Draco raked his nails down Harry’s shoulders in a sorry attempt to keep him still.
That was no problem to Draco and he insisted that he’d take care of it. His way of taking care of it was waiting until the three of them were alone before climbing into Ron’s lap and kissing the breath out of him, doing nothing more than smirking and pulling Harry in for a kiss as well when he rushed over, asking what he was doing.
“Daddy,” Draco said, trying his hardest to move against Harry’s grip, “you feel so good, please daddy, let me cum,”
Harry wiped his mouth as he pulled back, being satisfied that Draco was wet enough to prep. He whispered out once again, two of his fingers being coated in lube as he now rubbed them over Draco’s tight ring of muscle. He reveled in the whine Draco let out as he began to push one finger into him.
“Any way I see fit,” Harry said as he waited for Draco to step out of his pants. Once he had he stuck his foot in between Draco’s and kicked them apart, spreading Draco’s legs wider and having him bow more at the hips.
Draco couldn’t bring himself to stop Harry. He also would never admit that maybe he didn’t mind the affection. Once he was sure he could hold steady he got up and got dressed, feeling eyes on him the entire time but not meeting them even once.
Harry granted it to him after a moment of watching him struggle to get into a somewhat comfortable position, “you’re going to suck me off while Ron opens you up.”
Ron, as if reading his mind, pulled his lips off of Harry’s skin and replaced them at his ear, “he’s close, can feel the way he’s squeezing around me.”
Harry and Ron settled in sync; Ron fully inside of him and Harry’s bum firmly snuggled against Draco’s thighs. They looked at each other before beginning a rhythm. As Ron pulled out Harry would lift himself up, slamming himself back down when Ron entered Draco. They kept this up, watching the way Draco’s face scrunched up in nothing but pure pleasure.
“I could have you like this forever,” Harry breathed out, “but it’s really up to you how much longer this lasts. I’m close, and all you have to do for this to be over is say my name.”
“Yeah, close. Have you ever accidentally touched him? Maybe brushed fingers when reaching for something in class? Or brushed him when getting by in the locker room?”
It was after practice that he found himself in the locker room once again. Draco was twisting a towel in the air, aiming at Oliver who looked terrified as he scurried away. Draco let the towel unravel as he snickered to himself.
As Harry gave him an appreciative, dazed look, Ron returned it with an adoring one. He gave him one last peck before he was rolling over and letting Draco take his place.
His eyes widened for only a second before he forced himself into his cool demeanor once again, curling and uncurling his fingers where they were against the cold tile of the wall.
He couldn’t tear his senses away from Draco, not if his life depended on it. He mustered up a drop of strength to reach his hand out blindly and latch onto Ron’s as tears trailed their way down his rosy cheeks.
Harry had been partnered with the last person he would have picked to be partnered with; Draco Malfoy. Oh, how he could hate potions at that moment. Nevertheless, he moved seats to sit beside the Slytherin and get started.
Harry groaned at the burn Draco’s nails left behind, not minding that they would definitely leave angry red marks for a few days. He took Draco’s hands in his as he repositioned himself so that Draco was hitting his prostate.
That caught Harry off guard. He used the hand that was already in Draco’s hair to pull him back by it. Draco had his eyes half-open, practically all black with how wide his pupils were blown.
It was more for Draco than himself, as Draco loved to touch him any chance he got. Of course now that his hands were tied is when he had to break Harry’s earlier rule of no noises. The whine that left his lips would have been heart-breaking if Harry wasn’t doing it to punish him.
Harry simply slipped his wand away again and strode over to the chair, plopping himself in it and feeling the way the cushion sank underneath him, “no rules.”
Draco was writhing, trying his best to squirm away from the two fingers that were stretching him uncomfortably. He could hardly register Harry’s words until he was empty once again. He took a deep breath that ended up catching somewhere between his throat and chest as he felt Harry place himself at his entrance.
“W-want, need to touch… you,” Draco struggled out, straining his wrists as he pulled on his binds, “please, s-sir, please!”
“Well,” Harry said, straddling Draco and placing the tip of his slick cock at his entrance, “while Ron gets to use that pretty hole of yours, you’re going to fuck me. And,” He continued, starting to sink down while Ron began to enter him at the same time, “if you’re a good boy for us, maybe we’ll consider letting you cum.”
He reveled in the sharp intake of breath he heard from the other boy as he began to pump his finger. He felt Harry give away, enough for him to add another finger and scissor them. He continued this for a few minutes before feeling satisfied that Harry could take him.
Harry was gentle as he let Draco lay on his chest. He stroked his hair, looking down at him as Draco looked up.
Harry said nothing but gave him an understanding look. Draco took it and moved to the large wooden doors, placing his hand on one of them before turning back to Harry who hadn’t moved one bit.
It was early; much too early for this. Harry was already pissed off with Draco and it was only eleven in the morning. Classes started at eight-thirty, right after breakfast, so it took all of two and a half hours for the prestigious blonde to tick Harry off. Of course, that meant he was also ticking Ron off, Ron just wasn’t aware of that at the moment.
With that, she was heading out of the door, letting it close loudly behind her. Stupid heavy doors, Draco thought as the bang of the large oak door echoed annoyingly through the tiny room.
Draco must have read his mind because right when he was about to warn him, he pulled out. Harry whined as his hole clenched around nothing. He pulled the hand off his mouth, about to complain when Draco spun him around.
Harry’s back was arching, moans leaving his lips much the same way air was leaving his lungs with every harsh thrust.
He took his fingers out, biting his lip as Harry let out a breathy whine, his hole clenching around nothing. He covered his cock with lube as an extra measure before placing his tip at the other boy’s entrance.
“Good boy,” Harry praised as he thrust a few more times before his hips stuttered and he was filling Draco up with his cum.
They gave her a reassuring look as they left, Draco being ahead of Harry for a short time. Once he rounded the corner Draco’s arm was tugged on, his body being pushed against the wall. His blue eyes fell on Potter’s green ones.
Tuesday there were potions. Harry had certainly had enough of potions (if you’ll recall Monday morning), but alas there he was. The task was to make Liquid Luck, and the first person to make it got to keep it. He was almost done, only one last ingredient to mix in, until Draco came sauntering through the isle and “accidentally” tripped, knocking into Harry’s desk and spilling the liquid in the vial across the desk.
His pink lips were parted as slow pants left them, his lungs feeling like they were full of lead as his prostate was hit dead on.
He tugged on his invisibility cloak, heading as quietly as possible to the library. It wasn't exactly something to sneak out for, but the library had been closed hours before and he still had studying to do. He'd turn red if someone caught him sneaking out at this time, just to find out the reason why. It was hardly worth getting in trouble for.
He changed his angle right away, knowing where that bundle on nerves that drive Harry wild was located. As he hit it again and again Harry was starting to shake. Tears were forming in his eyes and fire was burning up his veins and he gave a broken sob as his cock began to fill up once again.
“I’m coming!” Harry shouted, “I swear if that’s you, Ron, I’m going to shove my foot so far up your--,” Harry was swinging the door open before he even finished his threat, his eyes stopping on the figure in front of him and air leaving his lungs as the figure lifted its head to meet his eyes.
Draco moved out from underneath him, watching as Ron hungrily dipped down and encased Harry’s lips. They seemed to stay like that forever, Draco slowly undressing as Ron slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth, exploring.
Harry pouted before turning into Ron’s side and wrapping an arm around his pale waist. Ron gave Draco a sympathetic look as he wrapped himself up in the spent boy.
Once on his back, Draco moved his hands to get comfortable. He watched as Harry got off the bed only to come back around and stand beside Ron. He looked at the both of them, taking a moment to thank whoever was listening for sending him such gorgeous boys.
"Alright, Potter, good luck," Draco said, both hands now sliding up and under the sweater, making Harry's skin prickle at the soft touch.
Harry wasn’t wearing anything underneath, and both the other boys couldn’t help but stare as his now-hard cock slapped against his stomach.
“Potter?” He asked in a harsh whisper, “what the hell are you doing in here… What the hell are you doing on top of me?”
He reached his hands down then, Harry's eyes following his every movement as he unbuttoned his pants, tugging them down and dropping to his knees to remove them. His underwear came down with them and Draco couldn't help but run his tongue over his bottom lip as Potter's cock sprang free.
Harry thought about it for a moment before he got an idea. It was an awful idea, really, and surely Draco wouldn’t go for it. He wasn’t exactly sure why he got the idea. Maybe he wanted to embarrass Malfoy, or maybe he just wanted to watch him squirm, or maybe both.
Harry nodded, leaning into Draco’s touch and scooting down to push into Draco’s cock, “want you, please, Draco”
Once he had managed to get the name past his lips he figured a hot cup of tea would do him good. He requested for Malfoy to join him in the kitchen where he promptly got out the kettle and put it on to boil. He didn’t entertain the thought of sitting with Draco at the table like old times, afraid he would show Draco exactly how he felt at the moment.
“You seem to want to be one in mine,” Draco retorted from his place on Harry’s bed, “which is fine with me, although you do make an excellent bottom as well.”
It was two days later and Harry had nearly forgotten the incident. But what’s better than remembering a memory? Replacing it with a more prominent one.
Harry may have woken up on the wrong side of the robe, but he had forgiven and forgotten by the time he got to potions. All he wanted now was to get this class over with and be done for the day. That want only grew stronger as he heard a familiar giggle come from in front of him.
Draco brought one hand around to cup the brown-haired boy through his jeans, the other hand petting through his hair.
He also didn’t have a choice when it came to saying welcome back either. Funny how things work. He wishes he wouldn’t have answered the door.
“S-seven,” Draco stuttered slightly, begging himself mentally to not get hard while Harry Fucking Potter was spanking him. He would have to die, he thought, just find the nearest bridge and call it a day.
He was focused on Draco who was pounding into him. Draco was wiping his hair from his forehead with one hand and cradling his face with the other. Draco who was whispering in his ear that he was doing so well and asking him if he’s alright.
Draco nodded, not needing to be told anything else as he leaned forward and took Harry’s now fully hard cock into his mouth. He let out a moan around him as Ron pushed his first finger into him, wasting no time in pumping it in and out of him.
Draco’s chest heaved as he tried one last time to thrash around, only succeeding in amusing Harry. He was close himself, and that last thing he wanted was to say Harry fucking Potter’s name as he came. However, he wanted this to end. So, he swallowed his pride. With a broken sob, he gave Harry what he wanted.
Draco obeyed, pushing up as best as he could so that he was basically holding himself up while his legs were spread. He looked up at Harry, waiting for some kind of instruction.
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry whispered something into the air and his hands were then bound. Unamusingly (to Draco) with emerald green silk, the same as his own curtains. He tugged on his binds, only stopping when he felt Harry’s weight moving down his body.
He watched as Harry’s chest rose and fell, his breathing speeding up too much for Draco’s liking. He kept a close eye on Harry’s face, seeing how his eyes opened and closed and he sucked in breath after breath. As if reading his mind, Draco stroked his cheek.
“You’re not,” Ron disagreed, not believing the words coming from the Slytherin, “and besides, what would you want doing that with Harry anyway?”
“Eyes open darling,” Harry chastised as he grabbed Draco’s chin and held his head in place, “you’re going to look at me while I fuck you.”
Harry was the first to pull back, catching his breath and looking at Draco’s blown pupils. He nearly lost his breath again.
Now that we’re all caught up, let’s go to the present. For Draco’s sake we should probably skip this part, but what’s the fun in that?
“That so?” Harry asked, slowing down his hand and drawing a cry out of the blonde, “how cute to think it’s up to you when you come.”
He did just that. He came in thick ribbons over Draco's hand and between their abdomens, eyes falling shut and mouth hanging open in a cut-off moan of "Draco"
Harry moved languidly as he reached around Draco, taking his belt into nimble fingers and undoing it. Draco bowed his head, watching as Harry worked his button and zipper, successfully getting them both undone. Before he could protest Harry was hooking his thumbs into his trousers and pulling downward.
He didn’t wait for a reply, it was rhetorical anyway. Once Harry was giving him enough leeway he was pushing in a third and final finger. He moved them languidly, fingering Harry for what was longer than needed. Draco was drawing in ragged breaths as he reminded himself that even though Harry was hot and tight around his fingers this wasn’t about him, it was about Harry and making him feel better.
“Oh it’s alright Ron,” Harry dismissed him, “I think we should let him. It’ll be entertaining to watch him try to get words out while being used like a little fuck toy.”
Draco hesitated as he watched the large, brown double doors reveal themselves from the secret slot in the stone walls. He reached out a pale hand and pushed on one of them, wincing as it groaned in opening and letting out a breath of relief when no one came into sight. He found himself walking through the doors despite never having fully decided that he would.
Harry didn’t step back as a snake landed in front of him. In fact, he smirked, he knew Malfoy too well. He watched as the snake began to slither towards him, tongue poking in and out and a small hiss coming from it. He made no move as an owl swept down and grabbed the snake in its talons.
With a wave of his wand he had the lights off and an alarm set, not wishing to be caught dead in Harry Potter's bed by any others.
Harry turned to him, taking a mental picture of him tied up, covered in cum, and leaking cum. He then waved his hand and the green silk keeping Draco bound evaporated. He watched as Draco rubbed his wrists, soothing the red marks on them.
Harry watched as the blonde moved swiftly, his eyes scanning the living room and seemingly noting any differences there were since he last saw it with a nod of his head or the lift of an eyebrow.
He got up, pushing Harry flush against the wall and teasing his rim with his own cock. Harry moaned softly, trying to push back against the blonde. He huffed when Draco pulled away, running his hand up and into Harry's hair, grabbing a handful and using it to tug his head back.
Draco pouted but did as told, switching his robe out with Harry. Harry thanked him quickly as students started to shuffle around in the dining hall. He figured it was almost time for first class. He turned to Draco once again, giving him a kiss on the cheek and the promise to see him later in class before he had to scurry off.
That was never the case, and then Ron was left to hear about the proper pronunciation of LeviOsa. (Kill me, he’d ask over his shoulder to no one, kill me.) Of course, he and Hermione had both reminded Harry what had happened last time he found a mysterious journal. He nodded and replied, “of course, how could I forget? But this is sixth year, we aren’t children anymore.”
Ron sighed but thought about it. Harry was his best friend, and if it helped to keep him from being distant and he wanted it, who was he to deny him.
Draco mumbled his disapproval under his breath but let Harry move him how he wanted nonetheless. He seemed to realize that he was spanked again because he rushed out a small, “six.”
Harry simply whined and Draco figured that was what he could muster at the moment. He pushed in slowly, stopping after he was halfway in to let the boy beneath him adjust. Once Harry moved his hips he pushed in further until he was completely sheathed inside Harry.
Ron was looking at him like he had just said he was going to blow the school up, so he continued to explain.
He stopped only when a large hand was placed in between his shoulder blades, catching him off guard enough to get his hands from Harry’s thighs to behind his back. He struggled only a bit as he was tied with Harry’s tie, Ron had found it just in time. Harry had a strict no-touching policy when he was pissed off.
“That’s it, again,” Draco blew on his face once again, “blow on my face, darling, come on,” Harry did so, over and over until he was calm.
Draco dropped his eyes and shook his head, his cheeks heating up as he felt the bed dip down behind him. He didn’t need to look back to know that Ron had rid himself of his clothes before getting behind him. It was almost funny, the way he knew the two as he did.
Draco couldn’t think. He couldn’t do anything other than feel. He knew he wouldn’t last long as Harry and Ron picked up their pace, slamming in and down on him mercilessly. He couldn’t bother to be embarrassed as he choked out a weak “p-please…”
Harry approached him slowly, not exactly wanting Draco to notice he was who he was going towards. He spoke aloud, not directing his attention to the taller boy, but both of them knew he was talking to him.
Draco took that as motivation to keep going, picking up the other boy's legs and throwing them over his shoulders, effectively going deeper and making Harry mewl and moan.
It was potions, a class Harry already wasn’t thrilled about being in. He wasn’t the best at potions, and the only thing that made it worth going to was that he got to be with Draco. Or, he would have gotten to had it not been for him being thirty minutes late.
A year seems like a long time. It is when you spend over half of it grieving someone you never even got to say goodbye to. Perhaps he should have been thankful that he didn’t get to say goodbye. Goodbyes are never easy either. He’d never know which would be easier, he had no choice in the matter.
Felix Felicis was fairly easy to make, so it shouldn’t take them too long. At least Harry hoped it wouldn’t. Neither himself nor Draco said a word as they mixed the ingredients together. Harry scooted closer as he watched Draco measure the eggshell, accidentally leaning too far and placing his hand on Draco’s thigh to steady himself.
"The last one. You want me, don't you?" Harry hadn't meant to, but the way he said it was more of a plea for reassurance than a question, "You want to fuck me, Malfoy?"
Harry decided the best way to do this would be quick and hopefully easy. He was light on his feet as he moved to get on the bed and straddle the back of Draco’s legs. He then leaned forward slightly to grasp both of Draco’s hands in his own. As he pinned Draco to the bed, Draco awoke with a start, a grunt escaping him before the panic set in and he began to thrash around.
Draco let his eyes flutter closed as he leaned forward, pressing his lips to Harry’s and reveling in the surprised moment it took him to kiss back. Once he kissed back he took control, running his tongue over Malfoy’s plush bottom lip and nibbling on it.
He ran his free hand over Draco’s cheek, turning his head so that their faces were mere inches apart. “What if I keep you here until you have to beg to get free? That would be fun, don’t you think?”
Draco dropped his head into the crook of Harry’s neck, slowly picking himself up and fucking himself down. Harry bit his lip as Draco repeated the action.
He heard the second hit before he felt it. The whoosh of wind was the precursor as Potter brought his hand down again, swiftly landing a sharp slap on Draco’s bum. Draco sucked in a breath as he counted, “two.”
Draco rolled his eyes, releasing one of his hands from Harry's hip and bringing it up to cover his mouth. Harry moaned into Malfoy's hand, feeling the coil in his stomach growing tighter and tighter.
This was going to be easier than Harry thought. That was his invitation right there. He gave Malfoy a small smirk before pushing him back against the lockers, pinning his wrists above his head before he could so much as take a breath.
He could feel the smirk against his backside as Harry sunk his teeth into him, electing a high-pitched yelp from him. He began to feel his panic rising once again as he was spread open, Harry’s warm breath ghosting over his hole.
They fired their wands into the air, blue sparks coming from Draco’s as gold ones came from Harry’s.
“I’m not sure you can handle it, love,” Harry teased, grabbing a packet of lube from under one of the pillows and tearing it open with his teeth.
“Finished just in time,” Pomfrey announced, brushing what looked like soot off of her dress, “hour’s up boys, you’re free to go.”
“Good morning darling,” Draco said sweetly as if Harry wasn’t clearly conveying that he could choke him at any moment, “sleep well this morning?”
Harry obliged, slipping in another finger and keeping his pace. He crooked them, finding Draco’s prostate easily and hitting it over and over.
“Merlin,” Ron breathed as he felt Draco around his finger, “can’t believe with the way you two go at it that he’s still so tight.”
That’s all Harry said, and it’s all he had to for Draco to nod in understanding, eyes already clouded.
