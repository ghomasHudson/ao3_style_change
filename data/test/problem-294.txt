“Thank you, Potter,” He said with measured tones, “I’m sorry I’m not hosting under better circumstances. If you need anything, do let me know. Goodnight.” And before Harry could get another word in edgewise, Draco escorted himself out of the room and closed the door behind him. The regret winded him as sure as the latch clicked shut. Merlin and Morgana, what was wrong with him? Draco leaned back against the wall beside the door and pressed his hands to his face. Potter had been flirting with him—sweetly, playfully flirting with him—and Draco had locked down like a Gringotts’ vault. He had said something, and that something had been socially appropriate, but it was so far from the ideal response that the echo of his own words kept rattling around in his head. Draco exhaled a forced breath, chest feeling tight despite the ebbing influence of his digestif, and pushed away from the wall. “Oh, you’re too kind, Potter,” He whispered as he started down the hall towards his bedroom, “You should come again after all this rubbish is sorted. I’ll show you just how good a host I can be… And with some practice, you might not be a bad dancer, Potter. Let’s both try again some time… Well, you’re a delightful guest. I’m glad we’re both satisfied. Idiot.” Why couldn’t he have just taken the step forward with Harry? All he had to do was meet him halfway. Instead he had balked, too fearful of vulnerability to say much of anything. Idiot. Such a fucking moron.
,” Draco said, trying not to sound pleased with himself for such a feeble display of magic.
“A true intellectual, as usual. Use context clues if you don’t know the word. Don’t they teach vocabulary at muggle schools?”
“Then you break, and there’s a variation to the usual pattern for a set. It’s more like eight beats for two movements in one set—but you’ll see. Both partners, moving to face opposite directions, 1-2-3-and,” Draco made the slow turn that had been depicted in the garden statues, ending up halfway around the circle he was dancing, glancing over towards Harry. Merlin, he hoped Potter’s mystified expression was only due to Draco’s grace, not the steps themselves. Though that was flattery he doubted he deserved. Without missing a beat, he continued revolving around the circle through the third and fourth movements of the set, returning to his original position.
“You’re kidding,” Weasley said under his breath, giving Harry one last, long look before grimacing. “Right… Be careful, Harry. If anything crops up that can’t be handled, get out of there and wake me up, alright? It would be bloody stupid if you died in Malfoy Manor now.”
. The laughter bubbled up from somewhere inside of him, bright and ticklish, and Draco gave himself up to it. Harry was looking at him, amused but still hopelessly confused too, “Is it the arms I’m doing wrong?” And Harry spun around again, moving his arms and wrists to the slow beat of the closing melody, like a mockery of a bird flapping its wings. Draco sank down into a crouch, sobbing with laugher as Harry stopped and threw his hands up, “Am I that bad?”
"I've got no idea. Maybe someone back at the office will know. It's gone for now, anyway."
He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move. At least, not until her fingers were reaching out towards his ankle. Then suddenly, he could. With a mad burst of movement, Draco leaped out of the creature’s reach and bolted for the door. He was just a moment too slow in reaching it, in closing it, to miss seeing a second hand reaching out of the piano. He slammed it shut, grabbed his wand from his sleeve and leveled it at the lock, “Colloportus!” The spell flashed and the door locked with a click. Breathless, cold sweat beading on his brow and breaking out all down his back, Draco collapsed against the wall of the corridor, stunned. And then the fear was breaking, bubbling over into overwhelming guilt and loathing and loneliness and misery, and Draco put his head into his arms and shook with silent sobs. That was how Mimsy found him fifteen minutes later, and she helped him up to bed, and brought him a calming draught, and under its influence Draco fell asleep.
“Absolutely. Go on, Ron,” Harry urged with a touch of exasperation this time, and Weasley frowned, but stepped over the grate.
“Are you prickly with everyone, or do I bring it out of you?” Harry asked.  And there Potter went again, ducking expectations. Draco had baited him, and Harry hadn’t bitten. Admittedly, it had only been halfhearted on Draco’s part, but he was used to Potter leaping on any chance to defend himself. It was like Potter had decided he wasn’t worth it. Or maybe it wasn’t that, because Potter was here, after all, strolling through the gardens alongside him and making an attempt at conversation. Maybe it had just stopped bothering him so much. Or maybe it was that Harry’s view of Draco had changed. Pity or empathy, whatever it was. Starved of companionship as Draco was, Potter was making it difficult to keep up appearances.
“As a—what was that? Sorry?”
Harry began slowly moving around the center of the pond with an odd, shuffling gait, arms held out for balance. After about a minute, Draco got bored of watching Harry muck about and turned away to meander up to the stream instead. A couple late-season dragonflies danced above the water, and Draco squatted down to watch the spill of the water over the rocks. It might not have been well-manicured anymore, but at least it was peaceful and pretty. Draco took another deep breath of wild air and closed his eyes. Wind played across his face—his lips, his brow, his eyelids—and he let his shoulders relax. Behind him, Harry made a satisfied sound. Then, “Scourgify!” The pond made a noise like an enormous belch, and with the force of a geyser, a solid shaft of water erupted from it, catching Harry’s front and sending him toppling backwards into the pond. Potter shot up, drenched and spluttering, as water rained down around him, and Draco didn’t even
“Of course, I have been. I’ve been perfectly satisfied, but—”
“Wait, Malfoy,” Harry said, expression still too tender for comfort, “I wasn’t trying to put you down, or anything. I was just saying, it’s not that unusual: Luna Lovegood. Both my parents. Umbridge, and she was a horrible toad.”
“You sure you’re alright Harry?” He asked, looking back from the fireplace as he approached it.
“And she’d have an idea of where to start researching, even if she hasn’t,” Potter pointed out, and finally Weasley looked away from Draco and towards Harry.
“Isn’t it a little early in the morning for whatever the fuck this Auror psychoanalysis is?”
“Alright, Ron,” Harry said, placating, “I’ll be careful, I promise. If things look bad, we’ll leave. Okay? Happy studying. Don’t let Hermione keep you up too late.”
“Well, yeah. I do okay,” He said, grinning at Draco and rumpling up his hair again. Damn, damn, damn.
“No,” Harry said blankly, and then, “I trust you.” Draco stared at him. The argument that Potter had used on Weasley to coax him into leaving was that he wasn’t
“Rubbish,” Draco said, even as he cut his fish, “You don’t expect me to believe that, do you?” He raised his eyebrows at Harry, who nodded.
“It’s called empathy, Malfoy. Maybe—”
“So… Want to teach me some ‘proper dancing’?” And something about the thought of getting to see Potter making a fool of himself at something Draco knew well did sound almost fun.
“I’ve felt that way,” said Harry, “And Ron and Hermione. Lupin. Fred and George. Dumbledore. McGonagall. Snape, too. And I know they all have, because they’ve produced Patronuses, and that’s what you have to draw on to do that.”
Just a quick CW: Draco discusses his difficulty eating related to his depression. I know that sort of content can be triggering for some people. Just wanted to give you a heads up.
Draco studied his cuticles and the shamefully ragged edges of his nails, trying not to show an ounce of the fear he felt as Harry stood up from the sofa where they had been waiting. Maybe he had moved, or given some other, subtle sign, because Harry had not taken a step before he turned and fixed Draco with a long, hard look. Draco remained resolutely focused on nudging the cuticle of his thumb back, face smooth and expressionless as a death mask. He was not going to be driven out of his own home. He would not show fear or weakness. He would press on against the dark as he always had, with a hopeless, tired determination: one step further, one day more, turning through the wash of time like a cog in a clock. He was Draco Malfoy, fallen and ill-favored, but if nothing else, still here.
“Okay. So, what you have to do is think of something that makes you feel safe and happy. Something that reminds you of how good life is, and how good it will be in the future. Something that fills you with hope or love or joy. And the stronger the thought is that you can summon up, and the better you can focus on it and let it warm you up, the stronger your Patronus will be. It will be easier now than it will be when you actually need it, since you’ll probably been scared then, but the more you practice finding that thought or memory and focusing on it, the easier it will get. So, just take a minute and try to find the strongest happy thought you can,” Harry said. Draco stared at him, thoughts churning for five silent seconds. When Harry just looked back at him, Draco finally opened his mouth.
"Fucking hell, what was that thing?"
you. Good riddance, obviously. But they were her family. Understandable that she’s still protective. And I’m sure she’s heard only terrible things about you.” Harry looked troubled, and Draco hid a smile in his cup of tea. All the better that he could pry his eyes away from Harry. Draco had heard nothing of the Aurors’ physical training regimen, but someone must have been prodding Harry into doing something strenuous, because people had to work to get chests that looked like that.
“Harry, you need a partner! And you’ve got to rest.”
“Right. I’ll be back. Leave the door open,” Harry said, and squeezed his shoulder before standing up and striding out into the hall. Even barefoot, in boxers and an undershirt, with his wand drawn and his jaw set, Harry cut a figure that engendered confidence. Harry disappeared from sight, and Draco remained on the floor for a moment, catching his breath. The cold sweat on his skin was drying, and this room was much warmer than his own bedroom. Feeling choked in his own clothes, he fumbled at the top button of his shirt, before recognizing the more immediate danger and reaching to his hip for his wand.
“Oh, never mind,” Draco said, swallowing down a smile, “Do you want to see the water gardens? I haven’t been that way in months. They’re a little bit of a walk.”
“You mean to tell me,” He began slowly, “It really is that touchy-feely? I’ve read books that mention the charm, of course, but I had no idea that was all true. I thought it was just sentimentality around a romantic charm, or some sort of thought exercise or something.”
“I wasn’t blaming you,” Harry said. Draco could see his green eyes turn towards him, and the stubborn set of his chin, “I don’t think it’s your fault. I just think you’ve got to be involved, somehow. I don’t understand it, but it doesn’t make sense otherwise.” As much as Draco didn’t enjoy the thought that a dark creature might be intimately familiar with the least pleasant corners of his mind, Potter had a point. He gave a single, grim nod. Harry gave him another bracing shoulder squeeze before standing up. “Come on. Ron’ll probably turn up downstairs any minute.”
“This isn’t about satisfaction, Malfoy,” Harry said with sudden firmness, “It’s not about gratitude or having enough. It’s about being so filled up with warmth that it doesn’t even matter if the Dementors take some, because you’re overflowing with it. Because it keeps welling up from that thought inside you, driving out anything bad you could possibly feel. I’m talking about joy, or really deep, lasting happiness. Being so giddy with love or excitement that everything in the world feels excellent and beautiful. Or so secure and wrapped up in affection that it feels like nothing could ever touch you.” He was mad. Draco had always had a suspicion, but Potter was actually mad.
“I know the history of my own house,” Draco said, scowling, “There’s not a single record of anything like this happening in any of the estate’s records. One thousand years of pristine accounts I searched through, and this is unprecedented.”
Under his breath but loud enough that Draco could still hear, Weasley said, “Sounds like he cares more about the bloody piano than he cared about anybody who went to school with us.”
Draco snorted, “I don’t think acknowledging the existence of the monster in my house is going to help.”
“Not specifically,” Draco said, “Though I never would have guessed that would do the trick.”
“Yes, alright, fine,” Draco said, crossing his arms over his chest and looking behind him at last, this time only to see the bubbling fountain and overgrown rosebuds outside. Of all the areas of the estate, the gardens and the grounds were easily the least affected—their glory dimmed, but most of that attributable to simple neglect. He hadn’t been in a mood to do any gardening himself for a long time. They walked out a side door in the corridor between the ground-floor sitting room and the morning room—unused since his mother had left—and onto a cobbled courtyard. Two statues of black and white ribboned marble stood at its center, shaped so excellently by a goblin artist that they could have been people in paint and costume: a witch and wizard, both beautiful, captured in the act of circling each other in a formal dance, their stone faces implacably calm.
“Do you think she liked me pouring soup on myself?” Harry said as Draco shepherded him towards the stairs, “She definitely seems to hate me less than she did before.”
"Impedimenta!" Harry shouted, and Draco saw the blaze of light through his eyelids.
“Just a small scalding, yeah,” Harry said stoutly, only sparing a glance for his wrist, “Sorry about that. I thought she was going to bring it out.”
“Pleasure to see you again, Weasley,” Draco said in tones of perfect civility, glad when Ron grimaced at him, “I’m sorry to keep you waiting. I didn’t expect the Ministry would send someone so promptly. I hope Mimsy made you comfortable.” Harry set down his tea and stood up. He was wearing his full Auror uniform too. Horrible thing. Much too trendy, with its dragonhide trousers and sleek, asymmetrical red jacket. It had clearly been designed with Harry and the members of his student militia in mind. It was a complete abandonment of tradition. But as much as the color of the jacket clashed with Weasley’s hair, the uniform did wonders on Harry. It made his skin warmer, his hair blacker, his eyes brighter with the contrast. Looking at the gold and jet buttons on the sleeve, inches from Harry’s hand, the way the cut of the jacket brought attention to the squareness of his shoulders and drew the eye to the clean line of Harry’s jaw, Draco was sure that if the uniform had not been modeled on Potter himself, at very least the designer had been referencing a full-body picture of him while creating it. Merlin, the trousers were pandering, plain and simple. Draco redirected his attention to the safety of the bridge of Potter’s glasses.
“So—” Harry began, and Draco’s eyes flew towards him, yanked suddenly out of his wandering thoughts, “Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you. I was just wondering, where do you want me to sleep, while I’m here. I’m not picky or anything. Just curious. On the sofa down here?”
"That's okay. Do you want me to teach you?" Potter asked, and for all the world his smile looked legitimate. Weasley and Potter then proceeded to get into a discussion, which devolved quickly into an argument, right there in the corridor.
“Yeah, you’re right, I do. And I’ve got you, and Hermione. Two of us should be going through books; I know there’s loads. One of us should stay here. We could trade, if you wanted. I could go study with Hermione, and you could stay with—”
“We already talked? We already—” Weasley spluttered, looking more like a sunburnt carrot by the minute, “We didn’t agree on anything! But even if you’re right, even if he is harmless, which I don’t believe for a second, then you’re still asking to hang around a house with an unidentified monster and a wizard who can’t even cope with a Boggart!”
“Yes, of course I’m fine. Why wouldn’t I be?” Draco said, voice clipped, “It’s upstairs. Come on, before Weasley erupts with impatience.” Draco led the way up to the third-floor sitting room. Potter and Weasley, shoulder to shoulder, followed him up the constricted flights of stairs, which were darker and steeper than they had been six months ago, but at least had not deteriorated since he’d gone down them two minutes earlier. That was the most he could ask for these days. Even so, he couldn’t deny that there was an unsavory feeling to the air in the Manor, growing more oppressive as they climbed into the private rooms that only family and intimate friends had ever seen, where Draco spent most of his time. It was prickling against his skin, dancing on his nerves. Draco could feel Weasley bristling behind him. When he glanced backwards, Weasley looked a little nauseous, but if Harry noticed anything wrong, it didn’t show on his face.
Still chortling, Draco aimed a non-verbal cleaning spell at the table, followed by Harry’s shirt, and finally the carpet. “Alright there, Potter?” He asked, once Harry had slid his bowl back to where Mimsy had placed it and sat down.
"That's very comforting, thank you," Draco said, wanting to scream, wanting even more to cry because it sounded as though he was being told an unidentified dark creature that wasn't a Boggart was on the loose somewhere in his house, "You're saying you don't know what it is, or where it's gone, why it's here or how to get rid of it. That's perfect. Thank you very much for your service."
you doing?” He asked, mouth open in earnest dismay as Harry pulled off his socks, stood up, and cast a shield charm on his trousers.
“—you for trespassing!”
“Master Malfoy,” She said, voice a half-octave shriller than usual, “There is two Aurors at the gate. Auror Weasley and Auror Potter.
Draco watched, silent and growing queasy, as Weasley and Potter walked to the sitting room door. "Alohomora," Weasley said, jabbing his wand at the handle, and the latch clicked open. Draco leaned back against the wall of the corridor, feigning disinterest as he looked back towards the stairs, but acutely aware of the two Aurors strolling through the door in his peripheral vision. "Bloody hell, look at that thing," Weasley said, sounding disgusted, and at first Draco was sure the Boggart had revealed itself, until he continued, "What kind of person owns a gold piano?" Harry, at least, only chuckled. "Right, let's just get this over with," Weasley said, "Bestiae revelio." The pause that followed stagnated into uncomfortable silence. "You think he was trying to trick us, somehow?" Weasley asked, but there was a tension in his voice that sounded like uncertainty. The air was alive and hungry for heat. Draco closed his eyes and gripped tight to his wand.
"Hey, Malfoy, I think things have gotten brighter in here. Look at the windows,” Harry said. And he was right. Draco sat up, staring at the clear glass of the windows, as transparent as they had ever been, not distorting the color of the sunlight or the gardens beyond. The floors looked richer too, gleaming darkly in the light, and the chaise lounge didn’t look so faded anymore.
“I hate to bother her so late at night,” Draco murmured, “But I feel like shite. And she’ll be cross if I didn’t wake her, anyway… Do you want a calming draught, Potter?”
"So, it's gone for now," Harry said when no one else spoke, "We're not sure what it was, though. It definitely wasn't a Boggart." That much Draco had gathered from the conversation he'd overheard.
"'Feels like there's maybe something here'?" Weasley echoed, "This whole place is a nightmare. I was more asking if you thought this was a trap or something. It feels horrible here. There's got to be something wrong with--ah!" Draco's heart squeezed tight as a fist in his chest.
The bed was warm from Harry’s body heat, and the harp was playing quiet and sweet on the bedside table. The room was full of the rich, soothing aroma of the incense, and the tea and calming draught flowed through his veins, easing his muscles and gentling his thoughts. His wand was within sight on the bedside table, and at his side, Harry gave a gentle groan, and burrowed into the pillows. “Night, Draco,” he said.
“It got away again. Turned into smoke,” He said, smoothing back his sleep-mussed hair, “I didn’t even cast a spell, this time. It just kind of dissolved. And then this hit the floor.” Harry held out Draco’s wand. Well, that part was unexpected. Draco started at him, before slowly extending a hand to take it back. The wood of its handle was as warm and comfortable as ever against his palm. So, the thing had, indeed, stolen his wand. That had not been part of the trick. Could it really have cast a spell, then? Dark creatures rarely needed external foci to channel their magic. They were usually potent enough as it was. Perhaps it was all part of some twisted game to torment him—killing him with his own wand. Brow furrowed, Harry joined Draco on the bed, fiddling with his own holly wand. He was shaking, ever so slightly. “I saw what you did again, I think. It looked like you, but older and wrong. It seems like it doesn’t change shape for me, only for you,” He said. Draco wet his lips; his mouth tasted vile. Absent-mindedly, he tapped his wand to his cheek and murmured a tooth-cleaning charm, before summoning a glass from the en suite, and conjuring a stream of water to fill it. He drank long and deep, until his insides felt cold and clean, before noticing that Harry was watching him with a curious light in his green eyes. As their eyes met, Harry managed a small grin, “It’s like you’ve got a spell for everything.” In any other situation, Draco would have been flattered. In that moment, he could only store the compliment away for later, and refill the glass before offering it to Harry, who took it and drank, too.  Draco’s hands had steadied, and the wavering of the water was the only sign that Harry wasn’t quite back to normal.
‘Breakfast is long gone mate. Mum’s making lunch right now so we can eat before we’re escorted to Diagon Alley.’ Ron explained, picking up a peculiar looking toy from one of the twins bedside tables.
‘He wasn’t gate crashing,’ he spoke up loudly and turned towards Slughorn. ‘I invited him professor, you said I could bring someone along.’
‘Alright Potter?’
Harry’s mouth dried as he suddenly felt uncomfortable watching such a private moment and he almost turned away. But Draco’s shifting, rain cloud eyes that locked with his made Harry's body freeze as if he had uttered another petrifying charm upon him. There was something lurking in Draco’s eyes, something that mimicked complete and utter satisfaction that Harry was witnessing this exchange. A ghost of a smile perked onto his lips as the girl pulled away, tired of his unwillingness to give her what she wanted.
‘Don’t say a word about my mother.’ Draco threatened, a furious look taking over his fair features.
Harry nodded briefly, his eyes catching onto Draco’s empty seat at the Slytherin table. His mind wasn’t allowed the room to mull over this as quidditch trials readily began. To his annoyance, various girls had shown up to the try outs, the majority of them not even in Gryffindor house but eager to catch a glance at the supposed chosen one.
‘Check the list,’ the man said to his side before turning towards Ron whose face was now as red as his face. ‘And yours?’
Their supposed leader blocked Harry’s line of sight as he peered at his face, ‘well what happened to you ugly?’
Harry could only nod in response. The conflict within him increased tenfold.
Without even raising his head, Harry replied in a flat tone, ‘no.’
‘Well, it’s Malfoy sir.’
Luna gazed fondly at him. ‘Whenever you’re ready sir,’ she said.
‘What the hell do you want Malfoy?’ Harry said with contempt.
‘No, that you’re gay.’
Harry stood up, taking up a protective stance with his hand on his pocket. Draco blinked at Harry acting as if he was a threat, it made sense after everything that occurred in the graveyard a few days prior. Yet Draco felt the sting in his heart.
‘And now, this final potion- ‘
Draco’s sullen features became uplifted at this, his muted lips stretching into a smile for the first time that day. His pale hair was no longer styled neatly, but messy upon his head and signalled he had worked hard to ensure the vial of Felix Felicis was his alone. And to Harry’s dismay, it was. Slughorn was haste in crowning Draco the winner as he clasped his hand onto Draco’s shoulder, suddenly more interested in the Slytherin boy.
Harry’s eyes glowed as he looked at from Ron to Dobby, ‘can you take Mr Ollivander and Luna - ‘
‘No – well yes, but that isn’t the reason,’ Harry quickly defended himself, straightening up in his seat. ‘You see, I saw him in Knockturn Alley entering a store named Borgin and Burkes- ‘
This was enough to satisfy Hermione and she began discussing the classes she had chosen for her N.E.W.T classes with Ginny. As if Harry could sense it, he looked up ahead at the Slytherin table to see Draco’s gaze trained on him, his face leaned against his palm. Draco’s expression was as indifferent as ever, there being no room for Harry to interpret what he was thinking. But as his cloudy eyes met Harry’s, he averted his gaze to focus onto his sparse plate instead.
Harry stood with his mouth parted, feeling as if he was currently hallucinating this soft and feeble Draco Malfoy standing in front of him. ‘Is this some kind of joke?’
‘You’re afraid Draco.’ Snape replied immediately.
‘Right here,’ the snatcher holding him chortled.
‘Yes. If I recall correctly, he said something like, I can’t believe someone like Potter has such an incompetent fool as his best mate. I just left them to it.’
The smile on his face fell. ‘He does?’
But before Dobby apparated them away, he briefly nodded towards the dungeon gate, allowing it to slowly creak open. Ron and Harry looked at each other as the others vanished, knowing that they wouldn’t be able to follow Luna and Ollivander just yet. They needed to rescue Hermione and first and Harry hoped that he could possibly save Draco too.
‘Cologne.’
Harry was at loss on what to do next, he had looked helplessly at his best friends, yet they were all equally as dismal as each other. There was no escape from such a situation as this, none of the order members knew where they were. No one could come save them now. As they stopped at the gate, a man stood there looking at the snatchers distastefully.
Harry nodded along, his stomach gurgling loudly. Ron grinned and stood up from the bed.
‘Mr Malfoy!’
‘I don’t need your help. I don’t care what my mother says, I’m not a child to be coddled.’ Draco’s voice rang.
Harry was moving his eyes frantically as he delved deep into thought, trying to figure out what Draco’s words exactly meant. But there was no reason for him to even think as a popping sound announced Dobby’s arrival into the room.
‘You do know that half of the female population at this school is in love with you, right?’ Ron said.
They both chuckled at this, knowing that Ron was most likely screaming profanities at Cormac with the colour of his face matching his hair. Hermione’s eyes caught onto something behind Harry, her smile dimming into confusion, causing Harry to turn his body in one swift motion. He took a few steps closer instantaneously at the sight of Filch gripping onto a nervous looking Draco dressed in all black. Filch dragged the fidgeting boy towards where Slughorn stood with a guest, an eerie silence fell upon the rest of the party.
‘Thank god,’ Ron mumbled. ‘Don’t wanna lose my best mate to my sister, that’s just sad.’
‘I’m sorry!’ Ron quickly said, ‘I really didn’t mean to mate.’
‘Draco, they’ll kill you if you go back- ‘
Ron looked as if he had paled another shade lighter, ‘terrible.’
‘No, it hasn’t.’
‘Look Cormac, it’s unfair if I let you go again. Besides, everyone here saw how Ron saved one more than you and I think it’s fair that the keeper position’s his.’ Harry reasoned, suppressing his victorious grin from surfacing.
The fumes of the potion went straight to Harry’s head, clouding his thoughts for a few moments and before he could stop himself, he had spoken the truth.
Hermione let out a sigh at this and shook her head at him. ‘Not this again Harry.’
I started school today so I won't be able to update everyday anymore but I do hope you finish this in 2-3 weeks so updates won't be that late! Thank you for reading <3
‘Aren’t we enough for you?’ He asked quietly.
Bellatrix looked towards Hermione in rage who was now shifting uncomfortably. Draco swallowed anxiously as he glanced at Harry and noticed that the spell was slowly wearing off now. Before anyone could notice, Draco stood in front of Harry, blocking him from view momentarily. The action was only noticed by Draco’s mother who glanced away instantaneously.
‘Mums just told us you were here, we thought you’d be arriving tonight.’ Ron said, chewing in between words.
And as the trio entered the classroom, there he was, already standing amongst his Slytherin peers who were busy sneering at the Gryffindors in their midst. Professor Slughorn was overjoyed at the sight of Harry and ushered him to gladly borrow a textbook from the cupboard. Even though the textbook Harry had chosen was breaking at the spine and visibly aged, he figured it would do for now.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Why’d you come back for me?’ Harry asked, falling in step with Draco now.
Draco shrugged as if it was nothing, seemingly breathing in the fumes of the potion.
‘Watch it,’ Ron barked at him as Hermione whitened in fear as the man held her hands.
Before they could begin to step out, Wormtail had come barrelling down the stairs, his wand tightly clutched in his hands. The rage within Ron was not a force to be quelled as he instantaneously grasped the man by the collar of his shirt.
‘My mother, she’s still there.’
Slughorn didn’t look happy that it was Draco had answered, his expression falling slightly at the boy’s darkened look.
Harry shook his head, ‘he was forced.’
The heat travelled up Harry’s body, enflaming his pale face and his breathing only hitched further at Draco’s subtle glance towards his lips. Something unexpected pulled at Harry’s heart but before he could begin to acknowledge it, Snape’s voice interrupted their trance.
Ron snorted at this.
‘And so is Dobby,’ Dobby raised his head higher, ‘Dobby and Master Draco are both free.’
Harry gazed curiously at the steaming pot; his book pressed against his side.
‘Stop Ron – ‘
‘A blood traitor,’ the man spat bitterly. ‘You Weasley’s are just as worse as those filthy mudbloods.’
‘You seem slightly distracted tonight Harry?’ Dumbledore observed, peering at Harry over his half-moon spectacles as they sat in his office.
Harry glanced at Ron briefly before saying, ‘just a minor mishap.’
‘But it makes sense, doesn’t it?’ Harry interrupted, his brows knitting in the middle of his forehead as he spoke fiercely. ‘His entire families full of death eaters. It’s only normal that Malfoy’s one too now. Especially since he was staring a bit too intensely at that cabinet thing.’
Blaise let out a breath of relief, ‘Theo’s staying behind too, maybe you can spend it together?’
‘One minute?’ Ron queried, looking to Harry in confusion.
‘Bunch of bullshit that potion,’ Ron whispered to Harry as they stood side by side again. It was his attempt to make Harry less embarrassed.
Slughorn stared at Harry with widened eyes for several moments before collecting himself, ‘let him go Filch. It’s Christmas and you’re ruining the festivity with your false accusations.’
In a haste to follow Draco and his mother who were busy walking down the street towards Knockturn Alley, Harry didn’t notice it was only Hermione waiting for him now.
‘You haven’t been very discreet with your actions Draco. I made your mother an unbreakable vow, let me assist you in whatever your plans are.’ Snape replied.
And to Harry’s relief, Cormac’s last attempted save was muddled with his broom shifting in the opposite direction, allowing the bludger to zoom past him and through the hoop. Harry smirked as the movement of the broom looked too easily swayed and as he glanced at Hermione in the stands looking incredibly guilty, he recognised her involvement.
‘Stay the hell away from me!’ Harry yelled, shuffling backwards with his wand raised. ‘If you’re here to seek revenge on your father’s behalf, save it. I don’t want to hear your pathetic nonsense right now.’
Slughorn was quick to meander off after he said this, attempting to find a replacement winner. Ron whispered apologies to Harry to which he smiled at, not finding any further advantage in being angry with his best friend. Hermione, however, looked almost relieved that Harry hadn’t won, her competitive streak showing.
‘Harry!’
‘Like Mr Malfoy told us, this is indeed one of the most powerful love potions. So powerful and dangerous that it smells different to every person according to what exactly attracts them.’ Slughorn told them.
Even though Hermione didn’t say anything in response and followed Harry towards Knockturn Alley, he knew she thought he was overreacting. Harry didn’t have any room to defend his reason as they abruptly stopped around the corner of the store Draco and his mother were walking into. The name Borgin & Burkes glistened amongst the darkness of the alley and Harry held his breath as Draco glanced over his shoulder. Goosebumps arose on the surface of Harry’s skin as it felt as if Draco had looked in the direction in which they were standing.
‘Ah, would you look at that. There’s more.’
‘It’s only the first day, he’s bound to do something soon.’ Ron reasoned, pulling his school shirt over his head.
‘What is it – ‘
Ron pumped his fist in the air, childishly gloating to Harry about how beating Cormac had been an effortless task. Harry watched him in amusement, head tilted when he realised a figure watching the pitch from the edge of the grass. Malfoy. He was only there for a lingering, few moments, curiously watching the scene painted in front of him as if it was a peculiar show he had never seen before and then he was walking away.
Harry’s eyes glided over the brief note written in the professor’s cursive handwriting.

‘Has it ever crossed your mind that perhaps Mr Malfoy was just committing some light window shopping?’ Dumbledore inquired.
Hermione stood quietly as she watched Harry rip the letters up and throw them into the metal bin. Harry ensured that no one would be able to read them now and that they were forever unobtainable. Yet this made him slightly glum, a part of Harry had wanted to keep them, but he knew it was an irrational want.
Harry violently shook his head, his body warming up with unease. The last thing he wanted was for his friends to think he was friends with Draco, especially since he wasn’t. He couldn’t even answer Hermione’s curious questions when he also had no valid answers for himself.
Ron walked closer till he was directly in front of Harry’s figure. This was enough to prompt Harry to put the letter in his jean pocket.
‘Relax Ron! You’re underestimating your skills, isn’t he Harry?’
Harry made an attempt to move but before he could, Draco had already shot a spell at him.
Almost reaching the Slytherin common room, Draco was agitated and ready to explode upon the next person who interacted with him. But as a concerned looking Blaise stood waiting at the entrance, he held it back for a few moments more. When he was in the comfort of his bed with the curtains draw, that’s when Draco would cast a silencing charm and scream till his throat was sore.
Draco nodded, swaying on his feet as the exhaustion from spending the entire day in the room of requirement lingered upon him.
‘So, the position’s mine?’ Ron asked excitedly, the colour in his face had been regained now making him again look like his usual self.
This was all Dobby needed to know as he immediately took a hold of both people’s hands within his.
‘What’s the point of petrifying me and giving me a nosebleed if you’re just gonna come back and undo it?’ Harry exclaimed.
‘This is more than minor son,’ Slughorn frowned in disappointment as he lifted the ladle before letting it splash back into the defeated potion. ‘I did have high hopes, but I guess…everyone has their off days.’
‘Just leave me alone, please.’
‘Potter! My broom malfunctioned. You have to let me go again!’ Cormac cried as he slipped off his landed broom.
‘Because we,’ Harry gestured between their bodies, ‘hate each other. You haven’t been nice to me ever since I rejected your offer of friendship in first year and now, you’re here acting out of character by apologising to me.’
‘Tell me, who was he forced by Harry?’
‘You don’t know that!’ Ron whined, ‘you know how I get under pressure!’
I'm so sorry this chapter took so long, i've sadly been really stressed and busy with school work :( But since its the weekend, the next chapter should be faster, thank you so much for the comments, i really appreciate every single one <3 also, uhh sorry drarry
‘You sure? Hermione’s managed to make something good for once.’

‘Would you rather I say something cruel then or what?’ Draco took a few steps closer to him, yet Harry didn’t move back this time. ‘I’ve seen you cry twice now Potter and both times my father’s been part of the reason as to why. I should be angry at you like usual but, you clearly have it harder than me right now.’
Cormac settled his venomous gaze onto Ron, searing him with silent profanities before he stormed away.
‘Luna?’ Harry said in surprise, ‘how long have you been here?’

‘What?’ Draco moved closer as to grasp Harry’s arm, but Harry pulled his body back as if Draco would infect him with something poisonous.
The lead snatcher glared at this, ‘you won’t be the ones handing him over, we found him!’
Shaking his head, Blaise gave Draco a look filled with seriousness.
What am I doing, Draco thought suddenly, shaking himself free of the restraints he had put on his body unconsciously. He coughed, loud enough to make himself known which caused Harry to quickly lift his head in embarrassment. His tear-stricken face fell even more into a frown as he noticed it wasn’t one of his friends, but Draco standing there with a blank face.
‘I can’t be sure.’ He said instantly, straightening up. ‘It could be anyone.’
‘Dumbledore?’ Hermione exclaimed excitedly and stood in front of Harry with an eager expression on her face that persisted.
next chapter is going to be...angsty.
‘At least it kept you out of detention.’
‘Ron, calm down!’ Harry said, holding onto his arm in an act of comfort, ‘we can’t help her if you keep screaming, we need to think of a plan.’
Harry let out a laugh, ‘I really wish they’d take a hint.’
‘Just how many has he been sending?’ Hermione questioned, crossing her arms as she frowned deeply.
‘That I’m the chosen one?’
‘I...’ Draco trailed off as he stumbled closer.
Things only get angsty from here!
‘You can see them?’ Harry asked, staring at the side of Draco’s face in surprise.
‘No, they’re not.’ Harry retorted, a chill travelling down his spine and causing goose bumps to arise on his blemished skin.
trigger warning: suicidal tendencies and references.
‘But that’s the thing,’ Hermione said, looking confused for once. ‘They’re not filled with threats or crude rantings, if anything…he sounds almost kind?’
Harry let out a laugh, ‘does it?’
(See the end of the chapter for
A silence lapsed as the tips of the castle became visible. Harry didn’t believe Draco’s reasoning, but the exhaustion of the night’s events stopped him from saying anything further. With the spasms in his stomach accelerating, Harry realised just how hungry he was and his mouth watered with thoughts of the feast in the castle.
A pained look passed through Harry’s eyes at the mention of his supposed popularity amongst the girls. It was solely due to the girls who had tripped over their feet for his attention and an invite to Slughorn’s party that Harry had decided to attend solo. Inviting a random girl would only open an opportunity for an attachment to grow and he had developed a paranoia that one of them would be slipping him a love potion.
‘What do you smell?’ Slughorn prompted.
Harry stared at his now tense back, his mouth slightly dry. He wondered who Draco had seen die over the summer and whether this was the reason his skin was tainted with a placid elasticity. There was an excessive amount of new information about Draco that had been unveiled to Harry tonight and he figured that this was the cause of the headache now brewing in his temple. Draco’s inconsistent actions were almost giving him whiplash.
‘I’m not afraid.’ The slight meekness in Draco’s voice suggested otherwise, ‘I was chosen for this. I won’t let you take my glory.’
‘My father works at the ministry!’ He burst out all of a sudden, causing his best friends to look at him in bewilderment. ‘I should be on the list!’
‘Your nose looks better.’ Ginny said, causing him to turn towards her.
A few days later, Ron and Hermione had begun to notice how strong Harry’s obsession with both his potions textbook and Draco had actually become. Whenever the trio weren’t in class or eating their meals in the Great Hall, Harry’s eyes would remain glued to the marauders map, his eyes tracking every step Draco took in every direction. Even when Harry had received a note for his first appointment with the headmaster later that night, his excitement had been forced and secondary to what the open map on his lap showed him. Ron had also begun to notice that Harry slept with his textbook by his side, afraid of his newfound prized possession being stolen whilst he engaged in slumber.
A light laugh from behind the trio made them turn around.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him and as she noticed Harry’s empty plate, she placed a slice of toast onto it. Harry swallowed as he stared at it, knowing his friends were all waiting for him to begin eating. Lately, food had begun to seem less appetising to his palette and Harry knew everyone at the burrow had noticed his feeble attempts of eating. Withstanding the discomfort, Harry picked it up and took a slightly larger bite than he usually took and began to chew.
‘I’m sure you would’ve fixed it for me even if it did.’
Hermione glared at her boyfriend briefly before turning to Harry, ‘we know that Harry, we just want to help you, help you get through this all.’
He had been too immersed in his conversation with Ron to realise that Hermione had opened his trunk in an attempt to choose some clothes for him. It was only when she let out a gasp that Harry turned towards her in haste and saw one of Draco’s letters in her hands.
‘Well anyone except The Malfoys and death eaters.’ Ron replied.
On the newspaper he was thrusting in the other snatcher’s faces was a picture of was a picture of Hermione with the boisterous word mudblood pasted in capitals. They all immediately looked back and forth from the newspaper to Hermione who had considerably paled.
‘Borgin and Burkes. I’ve heard of it before; they supposedly specialise in Dark artifices.’ Hermione whispered.
Dumbledore let out a nod, ‘I would think it’s due to the memory I just showed you, but it seems as if something else has occupied your mind.’
‘I’d like a word in my office.’ He seethed. ‘I’m sure you can find your way back to the party Potter.’
Harry found his patience wearing thin as he had turned away a group of squealing girls from Hufflepuff and had realised that only a handful of the girls from the Gryffindors could actually ride a broom. Harry should’ve been relishing in the attention, if it was last year, he might have been, but now it only made his skin crawl. There was something off-putting about the girls’ behaviour, it had only made him realise that he really couldn’t handle any romantic entanglements for the time being.
‘What’re you doing?’ Hermione inquired, eyeing Harry’s actions. ‘That’s not what the instructions said to do.’
Harry was quick to pick it up, following Ron up the stairs quietly as Wormtail surrendered behind them. As they crept up the stairs, both boys were given a clear view of what had been occurring in their absence. Hermione lay limp with exhaustion on the polished floor, arms outstretched as Bellatrix peered over her. Her yellow teeth glistened menacingly in the light as Narcissa turned away in distaste. Next to her, both Lucius and Draco stood, their faces indifferent to the entire affair. The goblin Draco had taken from the dungeons stood clutching the Gryffindor sword, a slash against his coarse cheek burning brightly. Harry had started to think of what to do next when Bellatrix again pointed her wand directly at Hermione in attempt to torture her some more. Something within Ron snapped and before Harry could stop him, he was moving towards her.
Even though his friends didn’t find this occurrence something worth investigating, Harry strongly felt the opposite. There was something in his brain that wouldn’t allow him to forget the image of Draco with his palm pressed against the cabinet and Harry could tell it was some type of warning from his brain.
This was all he replied before moving out of Harry’s line of sight.
‘Shouldn’t you be at home having a meeting with mother dearest and your good old friend Voldemort?’ Harry spat.
‘What does it say?’ Ron asked as both him and Hermione leaned over to read the words.
Harry could tell he was on the edge of emptying the contents of his stomach at any given moment now, being racked with nerves over this morning’s quidditch trials. He sighed out, wishing he could just hand the position to Ron without having him stress to the point of making himself look corpse-like. But Harry knew people would talk if he did, they’d know he’d chosen Ron specially because they were best friends.
ahhh finally at the last chapter! I know a lot of you were anticipating a happy ending so I'm rlly sorry for the emotional pain I have inflicted :/ I'll be posting a short epilogue type chapter and then it's all over! Thank you sm for reading <33
‘Drop your wands!’
‘Hermione,’ Harry groaned, opening his eyes to see Ron grinning at him with his mouth filled with chocolate.
‘What?’ She said, ‘Ron can defend himself; he has a rather colourful vocabulary you know.’
He breathed in the air, allowing it to cleanse his insides as it filled him, and his fingers grazed across the stone walls as he walked. Draco closed his eyes, his feet guiding him along the familiar path; he revelled in the silence for a few moments, enjoying the solitude. But even this was short lived as the sound of soft weeping forced his eyes open. Draco stopped in place as he rounded a secluded, crumbling area behind the castle. He had expected an early year to be there, crying over the tragic death of Cedric Diggory that had seemingly shifted everyone’s mood lately.
‘I know you’re hurting; trust me I do.’ Ron said, shifting on his feet, ‘but you’re not even talking to me and Hermione anymore.’
Draco whipped his head towards him, ‘didn’t I tell you to not come near me again?’
‘Then hurry up before the train begins moving.’
Harry flicked through the book to see every page was marked by scribbles from the mysterious prince person and he frowned, knowing making the potion would be drastically more difficult now. As he glanced towards Draco’s table to see him already busily working on his potion with a determined crease in his face, competition soared within Harry in waves. He began readily to read the instructions, at first trying to ignore the black handwriting wedged in between each line; however, as it became increasingly hard to ignore the corrections, he gave in.
There was nothing left to be said and Blaise was silenced, blinking at Draco who was now moving towards the common room.
The second time Draco saw Harry cry was almost exactly a year after the first time. But this time, Draco had been crying nearby too. Not only had his father been arrested, but their manor had also been raided by the police. This was enough for his mother to send him countless letters to return home immediately, the parchment stained with what seemed like her dried tears.
‘Your popularity is really making trials chaotic.’ Ginny joked as she stood next to Harry who had been looking through his list.
At first, Harry had been confused as to why Draco of all people was writing to him, especially when he had never told him his address before. But as Harry found himself laughing about a story Draco recounted about his childhood dog almost swallowing one of his mother’s garden gnomes, he realised he had begun to enjoy the letters. He had even begun leaving his window open for his family owl to fly in and deliver them. This alarmed Harry, to a degree where he swore he wouldn’t open any more of the letters. Yet, only one more came and after that, the letters ceased all together.
‘Just because he has the dark mark, doesn’t mean he’s a death eater. He doesn’t want to be one.’
Harry almost choked on his own spit; this was the last thing he had assumed Cormac had been inquiring about. Not only was the rumour one unbeknownst to him, but the sheer interest in Cormac’s question made Harry coil in dread.
christmas party is next <3
But even this instance hadn’t been enough to uplift Harry’s mood. He was constantly stuck within a realm of longing and grief that nothing could fill. Being around Hermione and Ron who had only grown stronger with Ron’s eventual return had weakened Harry, their relationship taunted him with images of what he and Draco could’ve been. And now, all Harry was the pending doom of facing Voldemort. The entire world was depending on him, each and every day a round of wizards who had died in his cause would settle onto his shoulders and make him feel weaker than he already was. Harry didn’t know how to control his own emotions anymore, feeling immensely guilty for being heart broken when people needed him.
Blaise raised an eyebrow at him, awaiting some kind of explanation, but Draco didn’t even have one.
‘Wait a minute…I think there is a Dudley on the list.’
Ron looked from Hermione’s dishevelled appearance and frustration to Harry’s bright spark and decided on which friend to copy for this lesson. He peered curiously at whatever Harry did and followed suit. But as Harry leaned over his textbook, Ron – who had been attempting to sneak a look at the colour of his potion – accidentally spilt a portion of the vial he had been holding into it. An abrupt spark resounded from the cauldron.
‘I said I’m not hungry!’ Harry said angrily, raising his eyes to give Ron an irritated look.
‘No more lessons till after Christmas,’ Harry replied, stashing the note into his trouser pocket alongside his invisibility cloak.
‘You’re lucky it didn’t break.’ Hermione cut in, her eyes studying Harry’s ashen features.
Thank you for all the lovely comments, i really appreciate them!<333
well...thank you mistletoe<3
‘Allergies,’ Harry quickly said, his eyes glancing at the men now exploring through their tent.
Harry rolled his eyes and went back to his task.
D: Is THIS doing in our flat?
Draco threw him a sour look then bent his head back to his task. “Forty-two can’t be the answer to the ultimate question. He’s calculated it wrong. It’s thirty-two.”
Draco stared into the middle-distance, blinking rapidly doing his best not to break down. “I know exactly what he’ll say and yet I’m terrified. Why am I so scared of disappointing a man whose every core value I find abhorrent?”
For a moment, Harry just stared at the man between his thighs before he burst out laughing, throwing his head back on the pillow. His laughter didn’t last long though as Draco smirked again and bent his head back to his task.
Who cares if the man is a legend and holds the highest arrest rate in MACUSA history? Who cares that his body is sculpted like a fucking Greek god’s? Who cares that he runs the most prestigious Fantasy Quidditch League in the Ministry? The man’s a tosser and needs to get his filthy paws off my best friend!
but set it back down figuring that he might as well branch out a bit and finally read something off his massive mental list. He wanted something different. Maybe something that had a bit of suspense, something that felt larger than life, but still grounded. Hermione’s voice came back to him, raving about an American classic that ‘he just had to read’. With a grin, Harry made his way down the aisle and snagged the library’s copy, noting that the author had several other books that he may decide to add to his list later.
D: What. The. Fuck. Is. This?
D: You have a cute nose, don’t make me break it.
Finally, when he couldn’t stand it any longer, Draco took a breath and allowed the dam holding back all of his thoughts to break. “This will be it. Tomorrow morning will be the last time I see him. Well, that he’ll let me see him. After tomorrow...after tomorrow he’ll be so bloody furious. It’s going to be a complete and utter shit show. He won’t take it well.”
“Well, um…Teddy,” Draco stuttered, “you just saw the turtle hatch from its egg. Ergo, a mother turtle lays an egg and a baby turtle hatches from it.”
“Did you just hiss at me?”
“I know,” the man preened as he took down another Boss.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. " Harry," he gritted out, "you have been unconscious in hospital for three days. You followed a suspect into a Death Eater safehouse without backup. You got yourself blown up. Again."
The ten years since the end of the war had done nothing to curb his father’s fanaticism. If anything, it had made it that much worse. Draco’s only solace was that Lucius would never leave Azkaban. The murder of both his cellmate and the guard who attempted to intervene assured a lifetime sentence.
Draco just scoffed and leaned over the console, blocking out all the other electronic and humanoid sounds emanating from the arcade, focusing solely on the game in front of him. He destroyed every one of the alien ships before taking out the Boss Galaga and celebrating as he had before and geared up to take on the next level. Again, the kids groaned, a few breaking away from the group to find other games.
It had been storming for three days straight. It was as if the heavens had sent a personal “Fuck You” to the occupants of Hogwarts Castle. And so, as cooped up, horny young adults are wont to do, the eighth year students had thrown a rager in their common room, music blasting so loud that it completely drowned out the thunder and pounding rain. At some point during the night, a drunken Ron had coerced Harry into a dramatic retelling of their adventure in the Chamber of Secrets much to everyone’s enjoyment.
Unable to type out any sort of a response, he called Harry, who to his credit, answered on the first ring.
“Draco, you’re constantly staring at Kevin, so I’ve been trying to talk him up. I think he’s rather a twat, actually.”
“Of course,” Draco says as he gracefully glides to the barre to begin his stretching. “And it’s just you and me. Didn’t you read the email? It’s a private class.”
Harry’s face mimics a fish, mouth hanging agape, eyes wide. Draco rolls his eyes again and silently wonders if he will cause himself permanent ocular damage from the number of times he’s sure he will be rolling his eyes in the next hour.
We were supposed to have a quiet day in--well, not too quiet--all to ourselves. We shut off the floo; we sent the owl to France with a letter from my mum; we locked and warded all the doors. I bloody well prepared myself for this! I’ve been wearing that god-damned plug he loves so much since I woke up this morning in preparation for today. But no,
Before Harry could even say ‘hello’ Draco burst out, “No! No more! I am at work for Salizar’s sake!”
This week, however, he was there by himself. It felt a little odd, not having a toddler in tow, but it was nice to be able to peruse the stacks for something he wanted to read. Harry was one of those people who had a list of books To Be Read, but he always found himself going back to his old favourites: Tolkien and Conan Doyle. Mystery and fantasy were genres he thrived on, things he didn’t get much of living in Godric’s Hollow. But it was home, and Harry figured that if his life were as high stakes as what he read in novels, he probably wouldn’t enjoy it all that much.
“Good choice,” the man drawled, picking up Harry’s book to scan it.
The sharp snap of the heels of my thigh-high black dragonhide boots against marble tile punctuates every purposeful step I take as I stride down the Ministry halls, only one goal in mind. My long black robes billowing behind me thanks to a charm I learnt off Severus.
to see a sleep rumpled Draco standing shyly in the doorframe. His heart ached at the sight.
D: I love you too.
D: Danger Noodle.
Draco suddenly propped himself up on an elbow to look at his boyfriend. “Hey, you’re likeable. Maybe you could teach me how to interact with the unwashed masses.”
“Come on, old man,” one of the braver kids taunted, “you’ve been at it for ages, let someone else have a turn!”
They had never done anything like this before. Not that Draco wasn’t up for a bit of sexting, but honestly, he was at work. This was highly inappropriate. And maybe a little hot.
Draco giggled and hissed again. “Are you judging me?”
“You know that you don’t have to tell him, love,” Harry said after a moment. “He never has to know.”
“And babe,” he added before ringing off, “just thought I’d say, nice cock.”
“You… fancy me?”
There, on the screen, for all on the lift to see--and yes, they were looking, the nosey bastards--was unmistakably the large, fully erect phallus of his boyfriend and Saviour of the Wizarding World, Harry James Potter.
Harry sighed and sat back on his heels. “Look, love, I fucking hate networking. I’m only likeable because I’m the damned ‘Chosen One’. If you want help with this, go ask a Hufflepuff. Now, do you want to keep complaining about it or would you like me to get back to the blow job?”
“What?” the Golden Boy asks, seemingly shocked. He crowds into my personal space. “Draco, Kevin’s not my best friend. You are.”
“Hissss, hissss, hissss,” Draco mouthed against Harry’s waiting entrance, dragging a teasing finger across the rim.
“Draco,” Teddy asked, “where do turtles come from?”
“Hey, Draco,” Harry says. He’s leaning up against the wall beside me, a glass of Ogdon’s Finest in hand. “What’re you doing? There’s a party going on.”
D: Sorry about that, by the way.
“Yeah, I know that,” the boy said petulantly, “but turtles had to come from somewhere. Which came first? A mummy turtle or an egg?”
"Whatever you say, love."
D: Whatever.
Draco flopped back on the bed dramatically. Apparently being seated on the plush surface wasn’t emotive enough. He had been in a strop ever since he returned home from pub night. Well, he was probably in a strop
“What’s got your knickers in a twist?” Harry mused, glancing up from his copy of Quidditch Quarterly.
Harry chuckled. “A bit, yeah. Why the fuck are you hissing at my arsehole?”
teaching the class?”
“Baby,” Harry whispered, heart nearly breaking at the sight, “you’re not a bother. You’re
“Draco,” the man said, with a small smile.
Draco was silent for a moment, a bit of amused horror filling him. “Harry,” he said, “you didn’t send me any selfies.”
"Hey, hot stuff," Harry said in his best flirtatious voice. "Is that a wand in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"
They stood in silence again, watching as birds danced over the water, searching for food and the Giant Squid splashed merrily at them.
“Draco!” Harry admonished. When he tried to protest, Harry picked him up and threw him over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes heading for the exit.
“It’s thirty-two, damn it! I’ll prove it!”
With those words, I unclasp my robes, letting them pool on the floor around me to reveal the pièce de résistance: a Gryffindor red and gold lace corset with matching knickers.
Draco whirled on the girl, “Talk to the hand—”
“Whole time,” Draco said, his focus entirely back on the game.
For the last three weeks, all Harry has talked about is Kevin, his new Auror partner. “Kevin does this” and “Kevin does that.” Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.
He promptly tucked the phone back into his pocket and tried to remember how to breathe, a task that was not made easy by the sidelong glances he was receiving all around him.
It was Harry’s turn to be silent.
He discreetly checked his phone again and was able to confirm that yes, Harry had just sent him a dick pic.
Draco just shuffled his feet and nodded, eyes downcast as though ashamed.
All I can do is nod.
Noise. There was so much noise. Harry's brain couldn't figure out what to focus on. It all sounded like a great big jumble of sounds. Logically, he knew that he was in the spell damage ward of St Mungos with Healers darting in and out of the room, but nothing else was registering.
“Oh, I know,” I say, smug. Enjoying the look of confusion and desire blooming across his bespectacled face. “This was important. But I got impatient. So, I thought, I’d come to give you a little break.”
“It’s wrong!” Draco said a bit manically as he flopped back down on the sofa, opened the offending book, and began a complex series of arithmancy equations.
For the first time that day, Draco smiled. “As long as you hold my hand.”
“So, shouldn’t you be enjoying yourself? What’s going on with you? You’ve been kind of distant lately. I...” he pauses, looking slightly embarrassed. “I just want my best friend back.”
Harry shook his head slightly to dislodge that train of thought. “Been meaning to read it for ages. Figured now was as good a time as any,” he shrugged. “I’m not too familiar with American literature though. If I like this one, would you be willing to point me in the direction of more?”
"Anything?" Draco chuckled. "I'll have to remind you of that when you're not loopy as shit."
“Yeah,” Harry rasped out.
Draco just grinned at him, his smile offering all of the thanks he was unable to verbalize. When the upbeat music began to play from the speakers, he allowed himself to get lost in the game, filing away the thought that he would be giving Harry a thorough thank you later that evening.
Harry briefly wondered how the ghost could be wearing those hideous healer robes but his attention was pulled away by the divine feeling of Draco's fingers playing with his hair.
The eerie tones of a synthesizer sprang to life from the jacket pocket of Draco Malfoy’s second-best charcoal grey dress robes. He received a few odd glances from other Ministry workers he had been forced to share a lift with, but it was no matter. He quickly pulled out the sleek black smartphone and unlocked it to reveal a text from Harry. Draco smiled to himself. The man was utterly rubbish with technology, but he had taken to the gadget with enthusiasm, much to Draco’s amusement. He was not prepared, however, for the photo message that assaulted his eyeballs.
“Um… yeah,” Harry says. “Because you fancy him.”
Draco smirked as he peered along the faultlines of the shell, “I bet it’s a turtle.”
“Well, bully for the lot of you,” Draco said, tried to sneer, “I’m glad all of you got to enjoy a dive into fairyland.” He couldn’t make it come out right, though, because Harry was looking at him with his green eyes gone soft, and a faint frown on his lips. It made Draco want to hex him—he hated being pitied—or maybe just cry with frustration. “Never mind,” Draco said, turning away from Harry and starting back towards the house, “This is pointless. Let’s just—” He stopped dead when Harry grabbed his elbow. It struck Draco in an awful flash, with Harry’s fingers pressed firm into his inner arm, warm even through the fabric, that he could not remember the last time he had been touched, even for something so casual as a handshake. His stomach twisted a little as he delicately extricated his arm from Harry’s grip.
“What’s wrong with them?” Draco asked, looking around at the roomful of moldering fabric.
“Draco’s a decent dueler,” Harry said, looking suddenly uncomfortable in his tight dragonhide trousers and sleek coat and leather dueling gloves, scratching at his ear, “And anyway, err... Look, Ron, it’s alright. I’ll be fine. I want to do it. If things get really bad, I can just apparate us. It’ll be fine.”
“Right, so… Let’s get started with the lesson then, okay? Sooner we get it done, sooner it’s off your mind. I’d sort of like to do it in the house, so I could keep an eye out for that thing,” Harry said, and Draco, with effort, managed not to cast a nervous glance over his shoulder. Harry seemed to guess at his apprehension anyway, “But, err… maybe it would be easier for you if we started off outside? Since you don’t seem very happy with your house right now.”
“Oh, it’s not your fault,” Draco sighed, moving to sprawl on the loveseat, “Don’t obsess over it. I doubt that will help anything.”
“I mean, I can’t promise I’ll fix it,” He said over his shoulder. Knee-deep in water. Thigh-deep in water. The opalescent fish diverted their courses to avoid Harry’s legs without a ripple. Trapped on the shore, Draco crossed his arms and watched. Potter had always been a meddler. Even when it came to other people’s fountains, it seemed he couldn’t help himself. Harry stopped when he reached the deepest part of the pond. Water was lapping at the hem of his fine red jacket, and Draco was sure he could detect a shiver in his voice. “About here?” Harry called, and Draco nodded.
Potter and Weasley, under Mimsy’s watchful gaze, were in the ground-floor sitting room. Weasley was all but pacing a hole into the carpet, which Draco might have minded more if the wretched thing didn’t look so dull and threadbare. Potter was sitting on a sofa, stiff and uncertain, despite the cup of tea in his hand. Weasley rounded on Draco as soon as he entered the room, ears only a few shades less red than the coat of his Auror uniform. It didn’t suit him at all. “What are you playing at, Malfoy?” He asked, spitting the name like a curse. With Weasley, at least, that was nothing new. “You write asking for Auror assistance, and we come, and you make us wait twenty minutes before you decide to walk into your own living room.”
“You want me to leave you here, in Malfoy Manor, with Malfoy, alone? You’re being an idiot.”
he was only half reading.
He felt like he was standing there a very long time. He must have been, because Harry made eye contact with him. “Think of something?” He asked, and Draco had to shake his head.
His thoughts wandered to the long weeks he had spent here, laying alone in the dark, doing nothing, and hating himself for doing nothing, but not wanting to do anything. Past that, down the hall to the right, he remembered seeing his father, skin sallow, hair matted, smelling of stale sweat and whiskey, sitting in his study—desk a scorched ruin long extinguished—staring silently out at the grounds. Not acknowledging him to either give or receive criticism or question. His mother, at the edge of the daybed looking pale and tired, gently entreating both of them in turn: “Lucius, our son is here. Won’t you speak to him? Draco, darling, could you say something kind to your father? He’s very upset.” And saying nothing, nothing, nothing. What was there to say? What meaningful kindness did he have to give? And yet, Draco still worried over the memory, and still felt the guilt like a stone in the pit of his stomach.  And past the grounds, to the outside world, righteously unwelcoming. An echo chamber of all his worst actions and all his worst qualities. He should feel guilty. And he was selfish for wanting to avoid guilt. But Draco was tired, and full, and he’d drank at dinner. Uneasy as his thoughts were, his body couldn’t resist sleep for long. He fell asleep across the foot of the bed without meaning to, still fully dressed.
Harry would never admit it to anyone, especially not Hermione, but he loved the library. Particularly the small branch just past the city centre of Godric’s Hollow. It was nothing like the massive research library they had available to them at school. This one was mostly geared towards children and young families. The selection wasn’t amazing, but every time he walked through the doors he relaxed. He felt safe. At home, even.
“Um...” he rasps, his cheeks darkening with a blush. “Coach Hooch said that ballet would help with my agility on the field so...yeah. I guess I am.”
“Training for the ballet, Potter?” Draco sneers as he leans against the doorframe of the dance studio.
“It’s hatching! It’s hatching!” an excitable Teddy cried.
a bother.”
As he felt his release draw near, Draco pulled off with a loud wet pop before dipping lower to tease at the sweet furrowed pucker of Harry’s hole with his quicksilver tongue. Harry was so lost in his own pleasure that he almost missed what Draco did next.
Harry’s mouth falls open just a bit, his pupils dilate so wide that there’s barely a green ring lining the bottomless pit of his eyes that I am certain to fall into.
“Nightmare?” Harry asked, knowing the answer already.
Harry’s head shot up, propping himself on his elbows, he stared down at his boyfriend, eyebrow quirked. “Um, Draco?”
“Sorry, what?” Harry blinked and looked into silver eyes. God, he could get lost in those eyes. He had spent several trips covertly checking out the new librarian while Teddy was absorbed in story hour.
Look, I know why they separated us. Best friends do not always make good work partners, but this is getting ridiculous. Kevin is completely taking over our lives and I’m sick of it.
Draco stifled a cry of frustration before gently laying his head on the pillow beside Harry. "Please," he whispered in earnest, "don't you ever do that again! You scared the shit out of me. I know you're The Boy Who Lived and all that rot, but please don't do that again. I don't know what I'd do without you."
Still, the sight of the little boy’s awe and wonderment at the beginning of new life--not to mention his hair shifting rapidly between seven different colours--was heartwarming. He glanced over at Draco who was watching the hatching just as eagerly.
Somehow, and Merlin help him if he ever found out, Teddy had gotten a hold of a giant egg. Charlie had been able to confirm that it was not a dragon egg but was certain it was reptilian in origin. If Harry had to posit a guess, Teddy got the egg from Hagrid.
he even left the pub, but Harry knew that he’d never admit to that.
"That's just the potions, love," Draco said for what must be the thousandth time. "They caught the guy, " he continued. "Ron has him in for questioning now. They'll get the countercurse out of him soon, I'm sure."
Draco grumbled, just trying to keep up appearances, but he was giddy at the thought of Harry having a gift for him. Sitting in front of their massive television was a brand new Nintendo with a box of games, Galaga sitting right on top. He squealed in excitement and rushed over to the console ready to play.
"Oh, I'm not loopy," Harry grinned.
"Potter? Oh, thank Merlin," Harry heard him say.
Draco’s quill flew over the parchment in a blur. Harry thought it best to leave his boyfriend to it and went back to his magazine until half an hour later when he looked back up and saw a veritable mountain of crumpled parchment and arithmancy books scattered around the man whose normally pristine hair was nearly standing on end with how much he’d been pulling at it.
Harry blinks, then raises an inquiring eyebrow, “You’re not mad that I’m the one you’ll be tutoring?”
Maybe he won’t notice. I could always just
As if noticing the group of children surrounding them for the first time Harry asked, “Um, love… how long have you been playing?”
Harry's face lit up and he tried with little success to pull Draco into the bed. "Come on, he's gone. If we're quick we can try that thing I found in the sex magic book Hermione lent us!”
I get it, I do. I can’t really be mad about this. But I was looking forward to this, damn it! I just wanted an easy day with my boyfriend. Is that too much to ask? So… here I am, opening the door to Potter’s office with just a flick of my wand and pure sexual frustration.
"Oh, good, he's coming 'round," a voice he didn't recognize said.
Draco propped his cheek on Harry’s thigh and smirked up at him, “Well, that’s how you get in, right?  I’m speaking Parseltongue to open your Chamber of Secrets so my basilisk can Slytherin.”
Finally, a familiar voice rose above the din, "He's coming round."
D: Yeah?
D: You know how I feel about snakes.
He pressed a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips then took him by the hand and led him to his desk chair. Harry sat back down and pulled Draco into his lap facing him, Draco’s thighs on either side of his hips. He held the man to him in a one-armed embrace, hooked his chin over Draco’s shoulder, levitated the book to eye-level, and continued reading.
“Look, Potter,” he continues, leg perched on the top barre. “Can you follow my instructions? Can you dance with me?”
is one of my favourites.”
Okay, very hot. There’s a reason why I’m already sporting a semi and it isn’t because of the delicious friction these lace knickers create against my cock with every step I take.
D: Oh no! Don’t you pull that innocent shit with me!
“Of course,” he said. “Is this all you’re getting today? I noticed you didn’t bring your son with you.”
At Draco’s panicked stare, Harry jumped in, “Teddy, I think we have some Muggle books on evolution in the library. Why don’t we go take a look.”
D: Fine.
“Now,” I say, “are you going to bend me over your desk and fuck me or am I going to have to do it myself?”
“Godson,” Harry corrected with a smile. “He’s on vacation with his dads, so it’s just me this week.” He wanted to continue chatting with the hot librarian, but Mrs Figg had queued up behind him with a massive stack of large print romance novels. “Thanks...”
he thought.
The friendship the two of them had slowly and painstakingly built since the end of the war had finally bloomed into something more. Something so much more than either of them ever thought possible. When Draco had been a little boy, he had dreamed of a love like this. Of a love worthy of fairy tales. A love that came from the most unlikely of places--if you asked them of course. Apparently, even Greg had known they were meant for each other.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up into his hairline. “Thirty-two? Draco, you’re not even done with the first book. How do you know that the answer is wrong if you don’t even know what the ultimate question is?”
“Harry?”
“Yes,
As he shot down more ships he felt a presence behind him. Harry’s warm hand grasped his shoulder in a companionable gesture. “There you are, I’ve been looking all over for you!”
Harry looks up at him, dumbfounded. “
"Yeah, but I got the bad guys."
D: What
Draco scoffs and walks further into the room, letting his bag drop in a corner before he begins to strip out of his street clothes, revealing a tight black leotard and leggings beneath. “So you’re the one I’m supposed to be tutoring. Lovely.”
There, on the display screen, Draco scrolled through sixteen dick pics taken from various angles, and apparently locations, in their flat.
“Love,” Harry began cautiously, “Hitchhiker’s Guide is a work of fiction. How can it be wrong?”
Harry chuckled from the doorway as he looked on at the sight before him. “Have fun,” he called, “maybe this will finally pull you from all that crap American telly.”
“Could have fooled me,” I drawl, downing the rest of my drink. “You talk about him constantly. Never shut up, in fact.”
"I feel like I'm gonna puke," Harry moaned. He cast his eyes around the room for a bin or something else he could use to be sick in.
The world swirled in and out of focus around him. He could hear someone speaking but couldn't quite make out what they were saying. Slowly, the blobs around him started to take shape. Well, as much shape as he could make out without his glasses.
After the door clicked shut Draco turned to him. "Harry—"
It had been a long time since the oppressive grey of a Scottish winter sky reflected Draco’s mood. Although far from perfect, the last year had been one of the happiest of Draco’s life. He finally felt as though he had a handle on teaching. His mother had finally accepted that he was going to live the life of an academic and educator, not a nobleman. And Harry…
Before Draco could flee the room Harry stood, crossed the small distance between them, and enveloped his boyfriend in a tight hug. As he pulled back, he tucked a lock of hair behind the man’s ear before cupping the angular face in his hands. “I love you. You are the most precious thing to me in this entire world. You are allowed to have needs and it is my pleasure to fulfil them.”
Strong hands manoeuvred him into a sitting position and brought a straw to his lips.
“You do know that you can save your high score, right?” a shy voice piped up from behind them.
Potter looks up from a sea of paperwork, looking exhausted and on edge. One glance at me, however, has his whole demeanour changing. He sits up straight, eyes wide, feasting on my appearance and the aura of pure lust exuding from every fibre of my being.
“But the game!” Draco wailed.
The other voice started droning on about...something. Harry wasn't quite sure what. The violently lime green colour of the man's robes was horribly distracting and the man sounded an awful lot like Professor Binns.
Still, that did not mean that his father was a good person, nor would ever be a good person. It did not mean that Lucius would accept him as he was--a twenty-eight year old gay man who had shucked the teachings of his father and learned to love, to accept things and people who were so very different from him. It had not been an easy road, and he still had to correct his inner thoughts from time to time, but the Draco Malfoy that was standing on the banks of the Black Lake next to the love of his life was so very different from the Draco Malfoy of so long ago, and through it all, Draco had learned to love himself. No one, not even Lucius was going to be able to stop him from living his truth.
Draco rolled his eyes and looked to the healer. "How much pain relief potion is he on?"
After another half hour of aimlessly wandering through the stacks, Harry finally decided it was time to check out. Maybe he would take his book to that café down the street and have a long lunch. He was so lost in thought that he didn’t realize that the person sitting behind the counter was the very hot, new librarian.
Harry quickly grabbed a copy of
“Of course I did,” the man sounded a bit confused. “I sent you photos that I took of, you know,
“Booyah!” Draco yelled, throwing up his hands in celebration and adding in a little hip wiggle for good measure. The line of kids behind him groaned as he turned back to the machine, ready to level up. “What,” he asked, throwing a sneer over his shoulder, though his eyes were playful, “you jelly?”
Quietly, Harry slipped out of the room and ran to the kitchen’s fireplace, tossing in a bit of floo powder. “Hermione!” he called after sticking his face in the flames. He was a bit panicked. He hadn’t seen Draco like this in ages. “Code Green. I repeat, Code Green! Bring your arithmancy books and be prepared to explain Douglas Adams!”
Draco’s eyes widened a bit and he seemed to draw in on himself. “No, it’s okay. I don’t want to bother you. You’re busy. I’ll just—”
When Harry squinted down at the screen, Draco suppressed a chuckle and made a mental note to remind him to update the prescription for his glasses.
No such luck…
Of all the days. Of all the fucking days for a Dark wizard, the likes of which haven’t been seen since that Fucker-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, to screw up and get caught…
Harry suppressed a grin at the look on Draco’s face, so grateful that he wasn’t the one to have to explain reproduction to the six-year-old.
He might have been imagining it, but he could have sworn the man blushed slightly.
“I said, ‘good choice’,” the man smirked. “
, Potter has dragged me along to some soiree at the man’s flat. It’s nice, I guess. Just like a typical American, his decorating skills leave a lot to be desired, but the party itself… it’s not terrible. His choice in music isn’t atrocious and the refreshments are decent. But of course, Harry is once again obsessing over the man, trailing after him like a lost puppy. It’s disgusting. If he likes him so much, why doesn’t he just marry him?
I stare at him in shock.
The man’s normally pristine white-blond hair was an untidy mess. Harry’s Weasley jumper from last Christmas nearly swallowed Draco’s slighter frame, a pair of black boxer briefs just peeking out below the hem. Barefoot and with a pillow crease down his left cheek, he looked impossibly young.
“Oh, I’m sorry, can you judge me harder?” Draco smirked, “Your pre-pubescent angst only fuels my superior gameplay skills.”
The healer said...something. Harry wasn't sure. He was too busy ogling his boyfriend. His extremely fit and well-hung boyfriend who he hoped was here to shag him into the mattress.
D: Ugh. Fine.
Harry reached up slowly and cupped Draco's face. "Promise. I'll do anything to make sure you're happy."
"Draco?" he asked. The word stuck in his throat. His mouth was dry, parched really. "Did I black out?"
Harry stepped close and grasped his hand, just listening to his ramblings. His slew of word-vomit. Harry knew of course. Had read the letters. Had heard all about the previous visits. Had sat with him through the aftermath of every communication with Lucius.
D: And YOU feed the Nope Rope.
Harry just laughed, “Okay, fine! I won’t send you any more selfies.”
“Kevin is not the one I’m constantly staring at or fancy, Potter!” I snap. Instantly realizing what I have just said I clamp my mouth shut, certain that my entire body has just flushed beet red.
“Harry look!” he exclaimed excitedly, “It’s the furthest I’ve gotten in one session before.”
When the lift finally stopped on Level Five, he raced through the halls to his little cubicle in the International Magical Office of Law. He quickly sat in his chair sitting as close to the desk as humanly possible so as to hide his raging hard-on.
, I am aware,” I scoff, rolling my eyes.
had to ruin it all and make Harry Freakin’ Potter come in on his day off.
It truly was a community library. Yes, there was a good-sized nonfiction section, but that was mostly full of how-to books and biographies. At any given time, the librarians were running different programs: genealogy classes, children’s story hour, crafting clubs, and STEAM events for all ages. There was a play area tucked into the far corner of the children’s section that Teddy loved. He had been bringing his little godson for almost two years. The boy was insatiable. He begged to come every week, and more often than not, Harry indulged him.
Putting that thought aside, Draco set his phone to vibrate and placed it back in his pocket ready to begin the workday.
"Can you give us a moment?" Draco asked the healer.
Unfortunately… fortunately? No, (definitely) unfortunately for Draco, his mobile vibrated once every quarter-hour for the next four hours. After confirming that the next two were more of the same type of photo from Harry, he studiously ignored the texts until his lunch break. He raced to the single-stall loo, locked himself in, and pulled out his phone.
Harry gave him a teasing swat on the arse, carrying him out of the building and to the closest apparition point, only setting him down once they arrived home. “Go into the living room, I have a surprise for you.”
Several hours, a bottle of firewhisky, and several ill-advised shots of gigglewater later found Draco Malfoy trying to suck his boyfriend’s soul out through his cock. Harry moaned, fully believing that Draco would be much more pleasurable at this task than the dementors.
And now,
“But I shouldn’t!” Draco nearly cried.
He wasn’t exactly sure when Draco fell back asleep, but he smiled into the wool clad shoulder, smelling the citrus of the man’s body wash, clean sweat, and a scent that was uniquely Draco. He held the man closer to him feeling content, in love, and honoured to be allowed to see this very private side of the most amazing man in the world.
To his credit, Harry did start on the correct beat and with the right step. With the song swelling towards its midpoint, Harry adjusted his hand on Draco’s shoulder, and stepped forwards, if not confidently, then at least correctly. Draco usually led, but he’d followed now and then too, and matched Potter’s step backwards with an equal one of his own, a gentle turn. The second step—Draco moved to step forward, just as Potter also took a step forward. They crashed together, chests and noses bumping, Harry trodding on Draco’s foot, and then a roll in the carpet, catching his balance just in time, though nearly dragging Draco along with him. “Ouch,” Draco said, hand flying reflexively from Harry’s shoulder to clutch at his nose. It didn’t actually hurt; he realized a second later. It had only been a little bump. Harry’s glasses were askew as he righted himself, looking concerned. He set his glasses straight and took a step closer, peering at Draco’s face.
