“Sent my mother a patronus and ask her to come here. Call everyone, really. As soon as we tell everyone and give Luna some pictures to put on the Quibbler, sooner we'll have her all to ourselves.”
He found himself moaning in pleasure, the ability to form words leaving him momentarily. Draco’s cunt was still tight and small under mouth, but he wanted to him to take all of his cock, and that was a massive undertaking for the smaller man.
Harry paced, and he swore under his breath, but there wasn’t anything he could do to make time run faster. Every fibre of his body urged him to Draco’s side. The day had been full of grim, impatient hours that had ticked by tiringly. Profound desire burned inside of Harry’s chest.
Fuck. Fuck.
Draco sighed in relief when he saw Harry's message, and he typed back a simple "I'm going now."
As the time of the meeting arrived, he walked to the meeting room. It was a circular room with a circular table, chairs around and a big TV to project whatever they put in the computer. Draco prepared his laptop with his slideshow on it, and sat down on the head of the table, waiting for the people to arrive.
As they went to their hotel room, Draco kept thinking about what to say. When they closed the door, he still had nothing. Well... It seemed like he couldn't just keep quiet.
Harry wasn’t naive though. He knew that Draco was going into heat, and that left him vulnerable. The tone of the texts was enough to tell him that.
It smelt like nothing. Maybe, a faint smell that she couldn't identify, but definitely not pee.
Shaking his head Harry slicked up a second finger and rubbed at Draco’s pink, furled entrance. “You’re immense. Look at you. You’re taking my fingers so well. Okay... Draco, this’ll  stretch you open a little bit more-“
Harry pulled Draco onto his lap. His hands were everywhere, completely awed by the lovely press of his husband’s small body next to his. He traced infinity signs over Draco’s sides, his fingers pressing slightly into the soft, white flesh.
He wondered if he could ever get used to the heat of Brazil, because the people were wonderful; friendly and kind. But he didn’t think so. For better or worse, Harry’s heart belonged in England, and he knew Draco could never leave his home behind.
There was a noise, then. A slight rustling in the corridor outside that broke through Harry’s revelry.
“They feel the same thing as if I was running or swimming. It doesn't hurt our baby in any way, but... Being honest, we should keep our sex pretty vanilla. We don't know how vulnerable they are and if my body is as strong as it seems. My healer says I have to take care and, by the sixth month, I should stop working altogether and keep my movements pretty limited. It will be hard but... If I have to do it to keep Jim alive and safe, I'll do it. I dreamed of them too much to
Harry had his cock in his hand in moments, ungainly and huge in his hands. It was already red and wet with pre-come, his knot swollen and tender already. In only a few stokes he felt the tingling warmth of his orgasm, and the release of the moment flooded through his body.
“The trick is on the chewing, Harry,” Draco said as he sipped his wine. His slightly rounder stomach was visible through his shirt, but Draco didn't seem like he was really feeling how much food he was putting inside his body. He actually wanted to taste every single different thing in that place. He was going to come back home with Venice in his tummy.
. True, he didn’t quite want as many children as his role-model had, but he definitely wanted
“And has everything been to you satisfaction?” he whispered into his husbands soft hair. “You’ve made me feel complete for the first time in my life today... I so badly want to complete you too... Shall we retire to our hotel now, or wait a little longer?...”
He reached for Draco, holding onto him with every ounce of effort, every part of his love.
"Nott, what are you doing?"
“I love you so much,” Harry replied, pulling out of the kiss. “You make me feel like I’ve been reborn; like I’ve got another chance to live the live I was born for... But you, my darling, look a bit pale and trembly. I suggest we forgo the coffees and go home for a few hours. I suggest a quiet afternoon, and you can nap if you want. Or we could do other things. I’m entirely at your mercy.”
Harry stripped, and wandered into their bathroom. He dived quickly under the heat of the shower, and found clothes that he thought looked acceptable enough for Draco not to faint at the sight of.
"Touch my breasts, alpha... please... I'm almost there... I'm almost... Almost coming..."
him. In the depths of his heat, Draco starved to have a
“You’d better get used to it, Draco,” Harry said with a grin. “Somebody as perfect as you needs messing up a bit.”
Harry finished, feeling shy. He wasn’t ever a big speech maker, but he’d felt like this needed to be said. For a moment, everyone was silent. Then the room exploded, full of cheers, claps and love.
Sliding his hard naked muscles between the silk sheets, Harry waited for Draco to finish pampering and preening in front of the mirror. He felt utterly fucking fantastic, and couldn’t imagine how that would change as they started their life together.
Harry felt exceedingly happy to be home. He knew he’d miss Brazil; he’d met some wonderful wizards there, and people who he knew would remain his friends for many years to come.
- to which he asked what were his plans and Draco just hang up the phone. He had no patience to explain his life and reasons to his employees, and he'd rather work while feeling Harry's touches still lingering on his body, specially his bum, that were still a bit red from yesterday.
tell me what you guys think?XD thank you all again!
Ginny screamed and sobbed in the expanse of the hall where they all are. She cried for him, for the future that they could never have. “You knew”, she voiced down at Theo as she brushed a strand of his hair away from his face.
“Yes. The reason why I haven’t committed murder or torture was because she was training me to kill Dumbledore. She wanted for me to have the honor of breaking one of our Lord’s seals.”
“Oh, Pans. I think you just made him blush!” Blaise began to tease as well.
“Why were you asking about their mate Andromeda?”
“How is my little Raven?” she quipped and the boy merely tilted his head towards her direction, his heterochromatic eyes glowing in the darkness. His left eye was mercurial grey and on his right was emerald. His black hair tousled and clothes rumpled, clearly showing that he hadn’t got any sleep.
Marius gave out a shaky laugh, seeing how scary Theo could be when he wanted to, before deciding it was best for him to tell everything to them. Of course leaving the last part when he performed magic.
It was just another day off for Harry, he woke up early and made himself a cuppa to start the day. He sat on the chair by his kitchen counter and began to peruse the Daily Prophet. His face once again scrunched up as he saw his own face plastered at the front page with Ron Weasley, between them was one of the captured remaining Death Eaters, Mcnair.
Reaching the pack house he knocked upon the door of his Alpha and Luna hoping that his intrusion be forgiven at how dire the situation. A few moments later his Alpha opened the door not pleased for the sudden interruption of his sleep. His brown eyes suddenly being awakened when he saw who was in front of his door.
Hurt flashed in Marius’ eyes the instant the last line was out of his mouth and Harry realized that. He knew he had just made a horrible mistake, but his rage clouded his head. When Marius met his eyes once again, they were empty. Cold.
And a huge many thanks to all those who gave this story a read, bookmarked, left some kudos, commented, subscribed you guys are awesome, you guys give me motivation..anyways onwards to the chapterXD
Orion, realizing this, blushed and backed off. "Shut up." He offered his hand to Draco who took it happily while clutching Orion's robes to his chest.
Harry nodded as he replied. "I will pass it on through the mind link." Then his thought flew to his mate sleeping a few rooms away from them and he voiced out. "Draco must never know of this if what you say is true and they did influence him. I won't let them have him. We have to get him out of Hogwarts. You do what you have to do, the potion will ready by tonight."
“It’s just you and me now Beau”, and the dog whimpered at him as if sharing the sentiment of loss.
The human took huge gulps of air as he tried to relax, but to no avail.
“Is that?”
She then tilted her head up to the sky and laughed. She laughed at the capability of her nephew to be able to cast such a spell. But as she looked toward him. She watched as his hair slowly turned black, the consequence for casting the spell.
“As soon as the potion is done, I will leave Hogwarts along with the Wizarding World.”
“NO! YOU GIT! I AM NOT PREPARED!” Marius screamed as they freefall before his words turned into incantations that cushioned their landing.
Hermione nodded and Ron’s fists tightened. They knew what would happen. The war would fall upon Gryffindor Lands once again, but this time they would hunt down two heads—James and Lily Potter’s heads.
"Tsk, still struggling even after in death. Well, not like I could call you dead since you are but a soul. Still, I guess that would do for now, wouldn't it?" A malicious smile graced her lips as she released a sigh that was as if she was going to enjoy every moment she was about to do.
"Is that the reason why you mauled me to the ground?" Marius said sarcastically and Harry chuckled at this.
. Did that mean that he was influenced by that magic before and now once again?
Hearing that, Rowena’s eyes widened before a laugh escaped her lips.
“Then, having this witch as our enemy would be dangerous.”
“What is this Chamber?” Theo asked. His eyes narrowed and his expression serious.
Hermione was confused at this but followed the vampire anyway. They arrived at the Hufflepuff Common Room and as soon as Hermione went inside, her eyes widened at the scene she saw. Harry was there, sitting on the couch, clearly glaring at the one who sat in front of him. Next to him, sat an annoyed looking Ron. When Hermione looked at who was across the two, she saw that Lestrange was there. Beside him was the human enigma.
As soon as Orion broke skin, he could tell the blood tasted just like how it smelt, but somehow, he felt something familiar on his tongue too. It was bittersweet, biting, and before he knew it, there were memories flashing behind his eyelids. They weren’t distinct or anywhere near as clear as seeing inside a pensive. If anything, it was more like watching a scene happening under heavy rainstorm, an almost complete blur, but Orion could recognize the overlapping voices enough that he couldn’t help but snapped his eyes open. He quickly removed his fangs from Marius’ skin and in an instant, silver eyes that belonged to a part of his bloodline met him.
“You shouldn’t have blinked.” The figure whispered at him and retracted his clawed arm from his stomach. He was then left on the ground with a gaping hole in his stomach. Ron coughed up blood and he could feel his blood trickle away from him. His body is trying its hardest to heal despite it being such a slow process. He then huffed at himself as he began to think if he would heal first before the loss of blood would kill him.
“Leave now, Clarke—“ , he said then in a swift movement he was whispering at Marius’ ears.
“His mate’s life is also in danger. If he does not do this, his mate will be killed.”
"Then why? Why did I kill them all despite knowing they were all innocent?"
“When I found Cedric, his soul was already gone. You manipulated your memories. You lied to me.” He flicked his wand into an arc and the barrier around them fell away.
She bit her lip as she shook her head her eyes burning with determination she continued on her work.
Neville relaxed almost instantly at that. “Okay, but why are you here? Where is Marius?”
His eyes found those Avada Kedavra orbs once again and he fidgeted. In the corner of his eyes, he could see Theo who wanted to be away from the mess happening around him, Blaise who was boring holes at Neville and said person was just looking at the ground, wanting it to swallow him whole. He sighed.
She then bit back her tongue and opted to glare at no one in particular.
“We all have darkness inside of us Draco, no one could deny that. It is within us if we were to accept it or reject it. And this, this is a part of you Draco.”
“He was a werewolf.”
his mind supplied. On top of it is a vial with a red potion and beside it is a box where the Witch Tree seed laid.
“I guess even the ‘oh great witches’ lose their marbles at times,” Barty mumbled to himself as he watched the dead army march towards the dome of light. He knew that that undead would not easily fall as long as Bellatrix stand. He was sure they would all die then maybe when Draco Black was finally a corpse, Bellatrix would be pleased.
“I’m fine,” Marius sighed, “Rather than worrying me over nothing, don’t you guys want to know just what happened?”
Theo was elated at the news. His heart began to pound and unexplainable happiness filled him. As he smiled with Marius at the news, the aura soon was forgotten by him for a while.
“Marius. Enough.”
With a wave of his hand, the higher year who spoke closed his mouth instantly.
“Please, Draco. Take your place as your Father’s heir and free us all.”
Regina said as she sat the now frail looking Narcissa on one of the chairs in the room.
The darkness disappeared and Orion was back at the hallway where he originally was.
That idea seemed to have changed Harry’s mind because not so long after that, he nodded just as slow. As if the movement of his head would make it much easier to accept the advice. Fred only smiled to himself at the sight as he stood up and left Harry to do what he needed to do.
With a last glance from Theo to the two witches, he followed his friends out of the Hospital Wing.
“Let’s see how you will deal with this, nephew. Nobody rejects me, not anymore. You will fall to my darkness,” she whispered to herself as she smiled.
Without any thought, he rushed to them and slowly but surely picked them both with a blanket he conjured. He lulled them both into a melody he used to hear during his childhood. The babies settled and Draco looked at them with their platinum curly hair, chubby cheeks. When their eyes opened, he slumped into the ground. Heterochromatic, one mercurial like his own and the other green like his very eyes. He choked a sob. The children stared up at him with brimming eyes filled with innocence and his heart grew.
"Its because of Sirius' connection to her that allowed the Ward to stay intact, but not for long and now this is the reason why I am here", his voice sharpened and the others listened intently.
Harry bit into Draco’s breast, the feeling of her soft, pliable flesh under his teeth a turn on like nothing he could remember. His wife was wet, and ready and Harry was achingly hard.
Harry felt like he was having an out of body experience. Nothing like this had
is the fucking middle of the world!”
He took his lead from Draco and licked the back of the omega’s ears, enjoying the way his scent subtly changed when they were stimulated. Harry didn’t think he’d ever smelt anything so erotic. It was such a
"You know, Draco... My family was exactly like yours. You know. I know I'm not rich, I'm just a secretary of a big company... But having my freedom has made me so much happier than I've ever been before being kicked out of my house." She said, caressing his back.
Draco, on the other hand, didn't know what he was feeling. He opened the door, looking at Harry and letting him in. His windows were covered, the blinds down, and he locked the door just as fast as he closed it.
In fact, the dark haired man had loitered outside Harry’s office the previous evening, and giving Harry what he imagined was a warning.
Harry laughed, giving Draco’s arse a squeeze. He just wanted to give Draco something to think about, a little
"No way. What if they are in the middle of something? I don't want to be scarred, Marius!"
“So, what brought you here?” Hermione then broke her silence before things got even messy and Blaise answered for them this time.
“Seriously, mate. I thought there was another huge problem, that was all?” Harry huffed but then Neville’s voice made Harry’s eyes snap to him.
Neville smiled at the acceptance and Blaise side-hugged him with all the affection he could give out at that moment.
Seeing the discomfort Draco had with his wrist, Orion pulled his hand back and covered his arm up with his shirt. “Enough of that. We could talk about this tomorrow,” he said before he took a peek at his cousin who had a shocked and confused expression on his face. As soon as he touched his shoulder, he noticed that he might’ve disturbed Draco’s line of thought.
“Hmm… No wonder I have been having the feeling that someone has been watching and following me. That was you, huh? You were not very subtle, ‘Mione.” She clasped her hand at her back as she giggled. “Oh, and you asked me why? Impure beings like them do not deserve to live, but some of them had a huge amount of magic. I thought of making use of it, you know. It took me quite a lot of time to assure that the magic becomes purified.”
comments and kudos are well appreciated! see you guys on the next chapter!XD
As soon as Harry was in the halls outside, he walked on the corridor headed to the Quidditch Pitch. He was stopped on his way there by a voice he recognized too well, though.
“There is a way.”
Blaise blinked his eyes. "I have never seen Granger that speechless before." He then began to chuckle.
“But that would mean….”
“The question is, who should go? It will be too suspicious if we all went.” Pansy raised an eyebrow before Hermione began to speak.
Marius knew he could not stay in Hogwarts any longer as what the guardian of the Chamber had voiced out. He swore he would not mess with the war. He knew just how much his existence could change it, but his promise to his Mother would not allow him to. He would still fulfill his promise to Harry. As soon as he had fortified the barrier, he will once again have to disappear. His identity had to be kept a secret at all times.
But it definitely wasn’t.
Harry pulled out his cock the moment his orgasm raced its way through his body. His prick felt like it was molten lead, so hot and so heavy, the blood pouring into it rapidly.
“Draco knows how I feel about being late to meet your Mother, but I guess it being the day after your marriage, I'll have to give you a rest,” she said, politely sipping her tea. “And it was indeed a marvellous wedding. Beautiful, every person had a great time and you were very good hosts, staying until the end of the party. I'm proud of both of you.”
Hermione took pity on them. “Well, I guess you two can go now. We can handle the rest.”
“Why are you even thinking of doing this Marius?”
As the bell rang students began placing their potions into a vial with their name on it passed it to Snape. Marius stayed at his seat waiting for the Professor to escort him to Professor McGonagall.
to all of you guys who read, left kudos, commented, subscribed, viewed, bookmarked and other more thank you very much!!! hope you enjoy this chapter
Ginny, who was there to witness everything, stared in awe as Hermione quickly tried to calm herself down and succeed. Marching with a hot head and flaming emotions was a stupid tactic against someone like Chang after all.
“Is everything prepared—“ Orion froze from where he stood at the hallway headed to the Slytherin Common Room. He knew that voice. He could never forget the voice that called upon him with a twisted smile on her face that he could even imagine so vividly without him closing his eyes.
He was running, running into a forest he knew best, one he always explored when he was so very young. He could feel the warmth of the hands that pulled him along, their laughter echoed in the liveliness of the forest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Marius nodded shakily, not knowing what to do as he felt his mind freeze at what is about to happen. He trusted his cousin too much to doubt him, though.
“Draco Black will prevent that from happening.”
Soon the dagger soaked up Draco’s blood until its once silver blade became red in color. Draco held it up in the light. Seeing that it was enough, he returned it back to its scaffold. Dumbledore stood up and walked towards Draco who held the dagger so dearly as if he never wanted to part with it and so the Headmaster asked.
“Yes! Thank you, Marius!” he said before he rudely dashed as fast as he could toward the green house. Marius shook his head at this, his potion brewing had been postponed once again. He then walked towards his dorms swiftly as he was still feeling sleepy from the lack of blood from his body. The ingredients he needed for the potion were all present in the green house as he and Neville were talking about it during Potions.
This made Neville stiffen even more. His face was beet red. A marking was a very private and intimate thing that he definitely did not prepare to be asked.
“Hey, excuse me bookworm I’m faster than you”, he crossed his arms and sulked petulantly.
Her mark as Heir.
“No time to explain. Can you tell Professor McGonagall that Lovegood is in the Hospital wing?”
"Luna?" he voiced out.
The old vampire could only nod as he began to speak. "The Horcrux I know of is an object that has hidden a fragment of the creator's soul for the purpose of attaining immortality."
“I…Yes Master Marius”
It wasn’t very well received, though.
Hi guys sorry i was late in updating, exam took up my time this month...hoping im not late for a bit for the month of love to post this chapter hahah.....hopefully you guys will love this..this is by far the longest chapter i have written i think haha
“Ginny, if this is hard for you—“
“How do you know all of this?”
Nymphadora’s eyes widened as soon as she reached the room where tomes was in what seemed like endless shelves floating around. Her eyes were not directed upon them though, but were directed to a figure that clearly stood in front of her.
"I'm sorry. I thought you might want to keep it a secret. You were muttering words like ‘no one must know' and so I thought—"
“So, tell me,” Ron said carefully when none of them spoke or even move a bit for some time now.
His dog whimpered softly and he smiled sadly.
“They have started to move”, there was a muffle of sounds coming from her phone.
“I have nothing planned, Blaise. Marius could attest to that.” He pointed his fork toward Marius who grinned back at Orion cheekily. “Brat,” he added, grin on his face as well.
The cold slightly damp floor of a ground full of snake skeletons appeared on view as Nymphadora within Luna's body jumped from the unused girls' bathroom where she found that god awful ghost who wouldn't stop crying as if anyone cared about her tears. She banished the ghost easily to the toilet where she crawled from with a single flick of her hand. A door with fingers that were actually real-like snakes once again greeted her. She clutched the necklace again and as if on sync, the door's mechanism began to move as the snakes curved out of the way to open the door.
“What are you about to do?”, Rabastan asked, Bellatrix paid him no mind as she waved her hand and a huge map was then laid out to the floor showing the location of the Blood Ward. She knew her strength is not enough to fully destroy the protection but her sister just died and the barrier would feel her loss for a while before its full power will return.
“Draco.” His name was said in a soft way once again, as if he was being summoned.
“Well Marius, we are already in front of the Potions classroom.” Ginny then made a stop in front of him, making him did just that as well and stare at her for a while.
"I have all called you here due to your Alpha's orders. Soon Beta Remus will be arriving and he will relay upon us the news that my father deemed cannot be explained through a letter", all of them looked at each other in wonder and a fifth year raised his hand and tried to ask a question.
“She was lying”, Ron stopped in his tracks as he then casted a muffliato to prevent anyone from hearing them.
Remus called him inside of the Conference Room. He gave a bow to all those present before saying, "Alpha, Bellatrix Black has begun amassing a huge army."
“Yes, Lady Nymphadora.”
Ever since then, Ginny did her best to help those of the Dark. They pushed her away in fear, sadly, but only Lovegood did not. Her eccentric personality had always been very interesting for her to figure out.
If anything, childbirth had made her body sexier. Her cunt was softer, more pliable, the muscles impossibly tight and springy. Harry felt perhaps that she’d reacted faster to his touch, and Draco felt wetter than ever before.
Thank you so much to all of you who have been here with us, knowing that this story was born out of a game and that there would be mistakes and errors along the way. Thank you so much to all of you who supported us throughout all of this story, and I hope we can give you many other fictions like this. Thank you so much!
The first five months after he was thrown away from his family's house were terrible. He cried almost every night, and felt lost and anxious. They never lacked for money - even when Nott fired Harry - but Draco was constantly afraid they wouldn't make it. Harry had started his charity, and it demanded a lot of time, money and effort, but it brought really nice results, specially with the Ollivanders’ Company helping them.
Pulling Draco to him, he moved his lips to his loved one’s nipples. Moving so slowly, so afraid to startle him, he made the tiniest of licks with the end of his tongue. The pebbled hardness tasted delicious, and Harry felt like he was burning on the inside. This, he thought, was what his life had been missing.
as was Harry’s typical style. Malfoy would marry some rich, powerful alpha, and Harry just had to accept that.
he decided. Yes, it was hot but Harry didn’t think it was unbearable. They’d spoken to the Healers before they’d left and they’d said it was okay for Draco to travel, just as long as she didn’t exert herself too much.
He knew that Draco would be stewing, but Harry was still too upset to speak yet. But maybe, in a few hours, when they were relaxed, and Draco was less quiet, she might be more receptive....
“Draco. You’re beautiful and this is... Well, it’s perfect. But it’s too much, too fast. You can’t fight your biological imperatives... I don’t want to make you regret your choices. I think we need to slow things down, think on what we’re doing... I think I’m going to go home.”
Oh yes, plenty were lithe or blond or sophisticated enough to pass as Draco, but the more he watched their writhing, twisting little bodies, presenting themselves ready to be fucked, the more he realised what was missing...
. He let the question for later, though.
husband in his arms, what a truly lucky man he was.
Surprisingly, he hadn’t imagined the omega would feel the same as him. He’d hoped, perhaps, but knowing was different. He felt the alpha in him rise up, felt every fibre of his being want to protect Draco from these parents of his. How could anyone in their right mind imagine a healthy, gorgeous young man like his omega would deny himself. It didn’t bear thinking about.
He killed the time by playing on his phone, trying to forget how useless he had been, and asking Pansy to put some more checks in the secret account. He was becoming more and more afraid at each passing minute, and when he drove home, knowing he'd see Harry in short, he couldn't stop thinking about it.
Draco almost felt his brain melting with that kiss, but it was clear enough so he could close the door with his foot before Harry placing his hand over his crotch. God, it was so big. Draco wanted nothing but to lick all of that and let it choke him until Harry came.
Harry looked at how Draco’s face had fallen, and inwardly kicked himself. What an idiot he was! The problem was, Harry knew he was falling in love with Draco, more and more deeply as the hours and days passed. He could feel his resolve slipping. Harry wanted to shout his feelings from the rooftops, and tell the world about the wonderful omega that had so enriched his life.
since they did it...
Draco was mumbling, but her voice had no sting. And even if it did, it would be suppressed by the fact she had her breasts out of her nursing bra, since she was still trying to make Jasmine sleep.
Lyra too."
Something in Harry's voice scared her. That part of him that wanted to be an auror when he was seventeen seemed to come out, and she could just nod. Draco wasn't brave. She never were, and now she was panicking when she needed to be strong to her baby.
, a decent guy, but it still left an ache when he thought about his daughter living with a different alpha.
the hots for this man, especially after coming twice in less than 20 minutes.
Harry cast a
“You know,” said a female voice behind her. “it's really unbelievable how
. Harry didn’t think omegas had been checked in such a manner for a century or more. He was completely, and utterly shocked.
“I never wanked over you, you big-headed oaf! Not even in your Quidditch uniform, not even when we were just courting. I never wanked. I'm completely pure,” Draco raised his eyebrows, trying to prove himself, even though it was all lies. “And... I do have fantasies. But I guess none of them you can... You can give to me now...”
“Okay... One finger is... Okay...” Draco licked his lips, full of expectation. He moaned with Harry's words, showing off his arse and opening his legs to expose his cunt and arsehole even more.
"It's good... It feels good... But it makes me want... More... It makes me want so much more, Harry..." Draco closed his eyes, imagining Harry's hand holding tight on his hips, the alpha fucking him from behind, his cock so deep his knot was all the way inside Draco, and he was biting his neck, claiming him.
“Honey, do you need something?” A woman, definitely taller than Draco asked, a nice and gentle look in her eyes.
But he knew he couldn’t push, couldn’t prod. Even after all these months, Draco was still likely to close up, shut down.
Harry was
Harry walked in, and had to hastily arrange his face into a more serious expression. Draco, it seemed, was close to a meltdown.
to lose you. We should make a plan, in case something like this happens again.”
“Hmmm... I'd like you to kiss me anywhere, but  first...” Draco looked for his wand on the side table and, once he grabbed it, he casted a mouth freshening spell on both of them. He put his wand aside. “Better. Now, kiss my mouth, Potter. Kiss your husband after your first night in bed with him...” Draco smiled, teasing.
Harry thought carefully about his answer, answering in a quiet clear voice.
"We need to sit down and talk about what we are doing here. Our start was confusing and I have no idea where I'm stepping anymore."
, and you won’t even care. You’ll come when I tell you, and you’ll take my massive load and you’ll
“Would you ever forgive me? I don't... I feel lost without you.”
“I’d feel lost without you, too. I love you... But I don’t
"I don't know, Potter.
Harry slid his arms around his husband, pulling him flush with his chest. His cock was spent but still nestled snugly in the cleft of Draco’s round arse cheeks. He didn’t want there to be even a millimetre of space between the two of them.
Finally, Harry found the heavy weight of his cock, rigid with desire and lust. Rolling back his foreskin, the head was red and swollen. He was too excited for this to last long... It was easy to find the loose, rapid rhythm that he liked so much, his other hand against the shower glass. His whole body felt electrified, tight with excitement and desire.
He called Draco over, and showed her the picture of the puppy on the scene.
Harry couldn't deal with him. He just couldn't. Draco knew he was a coward, and that if Harry was in his place, he'd have run away ages ago. But he wasn't Harry and he didn't know what to do. He would either lose everything to risk it all with Harry, or lose Harry to have everything he already had.
“What's wrong with me? Do you want me to make a list?” Draco raised her face, looking directly at Harry. “I just asked for me to tell me. Tell your fucking wife that you want her to go because you need time. Tell me you don't want to rip my baby out my arms
. He’ll tell anyone and everyone if he’s got gossip. It might get back to your parents, or round work.”
Draco sighed, ordering his meal. As soon as the waiter had gone, he looked back at Harry, trying to keep his emotions in check. He was upset with Harry's reaction, and his mood dropped a bit. He had to talk to Harry about it.
His husband was still tight, but good and slick, and it made all the air leave Harry’s lungs, feeling as good as it did.
Draco held Harry with more force and pulled him on top of him as he fell on the bed, spreading his legs. He let go of Harry's lips to ask, whispering:
He felt jealous of this ex one, Ginny, but then he thought... He was the one with Harry's hand on his chest.
But it was only for a second. How could he feel negative with such a beautiful little omega on his knees in front of him?
Then she walked to their bedroom, taking her precious baby for her Moses and caressing her hair, so black against pale skin, shushing her until Jasmine only whimpered. She sat again on her rocking chair, singing softly and trying to keep Jasmine in the state of drowsiness she was before waking up. It seemed like she was putting her baby and herself to sleep, because Draco's eyes started to blink and drop slightly as she rocked her baby.
Depositing Draco easily onto the bed Harry crawled on top of him. He wanted to smother every part of him with kisses, ravish him till he squealed for mercy, but just for a moment he took in his partners face, beautiful against the sheets. He was truly the sexiest man he had ever laid eyes on.
Harry felt massively excited, his cock rigid and unyielding. He wanted to be gentle, didn’t want to force this. Taking  Draco’s long, thin fingers in his own, he placed them on the front of his jeans. He was damp with come, and so hard, his excitement obvious.
“I love you so much....” Harry was so exhausted, he could hardly make the words. “I can’t last... You’re so tight and perfect...”
Stuttering out his words, Harry wanted to say so much. Wanted to tell his omega how much he’d enjoyed their time together, and how much he was starting to fall in love with him. Wanted to say that he ached to take their relationship further, come what may.
Draco took two fingertips full of the chocolate torte and spread it richly over both of Draco’s perfectly pink nipples. Leaning close, he lent his head and started to lap his rough tongue over the nipples, enjoying the feeling of the ripe little nipples in his mouth.
The feeling of Draco taking control felt just completely bloody amazing to Harry. His mind went utterly blank as the heat of his hot wet slick rolled over his pulsing dick. Just the tiniest touch made Harry feel like he was going to explode, and he really had to focus on holding himself back...
Jasmine just giggled as Harry tickled her, trying to extract an answer. They always played a similar game, and where he would guess more, and more outlandish answers.
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry said, pressing a final kiss on Draco’s forehead. “You have as much time as you need. If you want to share a future with me, then we’ve got all the time in the world. I don’t mind waiting. As long as you need.” Harry took Draco by the hand. “I’ll make a family with you, give you a baby.”
Harry held Draco then, snaked his arms around her skinny shoulders and pulled her close.
Draco turned, leaving Harry on the bed as he got out just enough so he could hold Harry's trousers with trembling hands and take them off, admiring the naked body of the man for a minute.
He went to the en suite, showering and taking care of his hair. Draco wanted to be amazing for Harry, because he had taken care of him and welcomed him in his home...
"Alpha... Alpha, before we continue... Can I ask you something, please?" He asked, looking into Harry's eyes, almost pleading. "When we're finished... and I'm sure I'll be exhausted... Can you please stay a little? Just until I sleep? I... I don't want to see you go..."
Within a minute Harry was able to summon a hoarse whisper: “I’m there... Completely filling you... Done so well, baby... Took my whole cock...”
Draco read Harry's silence wrong. His eyes started to water, and he tried to swallow his hiccups. He bit his bottom lip, trying to control himself, but it was hard. For more than a year, they have waited, and he couldn't give it to him. He couldn't do it. Why did he have to have this body, after all? If he was just a regular guy, like Harry was, they would've been naked by this time.
Harry raked his hands through his hair, shocked by the evenings turn of events. He brought up the Uber app on his phone, and called for a car. He’d had far too much to drink earlier to drive.
. I never learnt how to cook, how to take a bus, how to fend for myself. And it wasn't because I am rich. No, it's because I couldn't. Such mundane things are not appropriate and also would let me survive on my own. And they can't allow that."
"Alpha... Finally... Finally it doesn't ache anymore..." Draco moaned, although tears fell down his cheeks. His small cock was still hard, his cunt was gushing slick, and his nipples were hard. "Now fuck a baby into me."
Harry felt concerned. He’d had no idea that Draco felt as strongly about the issue as he did; stronger perhaps. He could tell he’d touched a raw spot with his husband. The defensive body language was always his most obvious tell, and he was hugging himself desperately.
“I... I was going to tell you another secret today,” Draco started, biting his lower lip. “I was afraid of telling you because I was so sure I'd never get pregnant in my life... But... I think I'd love it if we do it while... Hm... I was going to say, while I pretend to be with your child but... I guess I don't need to pretend anymore.”
“You have competition, Harry. She's better at it then you,” Draco whispered when the healers got away from them.
Draco side-looked at Harry, knowing Lyra's words were true. Since their first night together, Draco could sense Harry's walls all around him, like he was trying hard not to give himself in... He is still surrounded by those walls, even if they are crumbling little my little.
After all, they
Draco sent it, and then felt anxious. What if Harry didn't find him attractive after all?
Seeing Harry in his bed was a dream. He was incredibly handsome, like sculpted by Michelangelo's hand, except his cock. Michelangelo would do one like Draco's. Harry's cock was a masterpiece, even soft after sex.
“This is still what you want?” Harry whispered, though the words sounded noisy in the sacred space.
, but what if she was just like Draco?
Harry opened his bedroom door, and showed his lover the small room where he spent his nights. “I know it’s not much,” he whispered, “but at least it’s ours. And I’m not expecting anything... I understand what a horrible shock today has been. I’ll hold you all night though, if you’re feeling shocked and scared. Anything you desire...”
He wandered into their living room, and found an empty spot on the settee. Glancing down at the screen of his phone, Harry saw that he’d missed a message from Lyra. He flicked his finger over the screen and opened the message.
He ended the call after that. Opening the APP again, he answered Harry's ex-wife.
I could mention. That thing ought to be in a museum exhibit, Harry.
Suddenly, he felt too hot for his body.
Picking up Draco, Harry’s hands were splayed over Draco’s slight hips and arse cheeks. Everywhere the wet heat of the water surrounded them. Lining up Draco’s cunt with his solid cock, he pulled his husband down on him firmly, in one solid, powerful thrust.
open with her words. He hoped that she didn’t say anything that made Draco feel sad, or excluded. He wanted him here, and even if he couldn’t say Draco was his boyfriend
It had begun three weeks before, when Harry and he became dormmates. McGonagall was very interested in inter-house cooperation, so all eighth-years were housed away from their friends.
Harry’s body felt supple and warm, and he felt infused with heat. He certainly did want to come back to the hotel. His prick was swelling in his trousers, pushing uncomfortably again the buttons. Somehow, this felt different from before, and Harry felt very turned on by the fact.
Harry felt like his whole body was ready to fuck Draco, felt like the whole of the evening had been foreplay waiting for this moment. He switched Draco over so he was laying on his back “I want to see you,” he exclaimed. “See your face when you come.”
Everything smelt like the alpha. Draco felt at home. Suddenly, he didn't want to stay the night. He wanted to stay
Draco would be waiting within the stone circle by now, as bare as the day he’d been born. Luna would have fed Draco the collection of bitter fertility herbs whilst Pansy would have given him a potion brewed with her tears. Those same two witches would have shaved Draco’s pubic hair before sanctifying his body with runic symbols, painted carefully across his belly.
Draco looked up at Harry, his body screaming
After a whole day shopping, Harry carrying bags and more bags behind her the whole day, many times they had to stop so she could go to a restroom because her bladder seemed to be half the size, Draco felt like she had all the things she wanted. Except...
She looked at him, feeling hot just from looking to his face. Her cheeks were warm and, in between her legs, too.
Not just as an employee but as a
As they walked though St. Mark’s Square, holding hands, Harry felt completely at peace. Draco looked gorgeous, almost ethereal in the moonlight. Harry couldn’t believe his luck, really. In addition, Draco didn't feel the time pass by. He was just having so much fun, walking around hand in hand with Harry and feeling like his heart was going to burst at any second. He was already happy with Harry before the marriage. Their love didn't change at all because of their vows or the band around their fingers. However, it was different.
As Harry stood next to Draco, made his vows, and felt the magic of their bonding twist through his veins and around his heart, he knew he was completely at peace. This commitment was entirely his choice and this relationship was the part of himself that he realised he’d been missing forever.
“She just fell. She isn't even scrapped,” Draco tried to justify, she didn't even know why. She had a really bad feeling about it.
He also had put his flat to rent, and that gave him an extra money to decorate Iris' nursery when he found out he was pregnant - after that one first try at their bonding night.
“Congratulations!” Draco's voice was pure cheer. His eyes were beaming and his smile was big enough that could reach his ears. He got up and hugged her. “I'm so happy for you! Having a baby is such a joy!”
Harry carried Draco to their bedroom, and settled his husband down on top of his lap. He kissed him solidly on the lips, thoroughly and heavily, lavishing all of his love onto him.
He couldn't help but let his tears fall.
“I'm sorry, Harry... It's just... I never felt this way before. My body was... It was too much for today... But it was amazing... Thank you, love... You were incredible.”
Harry had decided he might take Draco up with his offer of help after all.
Pushing Draco off him gently, Harry pulled off his jeans. His huge cock, excited and rigid, bounced between them. Harry would be embarrassed by his keenness, but every time with Draco was exactly like this; he just couldn’t get enough.
going to fit in my cunt. Never.”
He was so turned on, his balls tight and aching and he thought he’d pop straight away when Draco took off his knickers, and he pulled off his shorts in response.
Soon Draco found they loved goats. There were goats walking around, free, as if they owned the place. There were many goat related foods, the men called themselves 'goats' and the kids were 'little goats'. The lack of monkeys was a little surprising, too.
So when Harry touched him, slick and delicious, he wasn't ashamed that he came almost a second after. His come, a smaller amount than Harry's, mixed over his stomach with the previous jets, and his body arched away from the bed.
“They killed my mummy!” The kid screamed at the top of her lungs, holding one of the aurors by their arm. “Put them in Azkaban, the Death Eater killed my mummy!”
He owled the Ball, making polite excuses and had a quick shower, suddenly worried about Draco being poorly. Harry thought he’d take him the healers tomorrow, but he didn’t relish that conversation. Maybe it was just Draco’s period coming on.
Harry could feel his body reacting to the kiss, and he knew that it would take only one look from Draco for him to carry him into bed. But he’d never put his beloved into the position of feeling pressured.
“Don’t you worry your pretty head. I’ll keep you plenty warm. Do I get to use you as my own personal quilt in return?” Harry marvelled at the difference in their bodies. His body was tough, muscular, all thick chest and heavy thighs. Draco’s body was soft, pliable and velvety next to his. His fingers crept down to the curve of his husband’s tummy.
Harry knew the next few words would hurt the pair of them, but he was determined. He looked Draco straight in his eyes, and gripped the side of his chair, fearful suddenly of the other man’s reaction.
Even though Draco was getting plenty wet he wasn’t going to impale him quite yet. He didn’t want to actually damage him. He gave the pinker of Draco’s two nipples a quick bite just to see if he’d squeal. He pressed a third finger in, Draco wet and perfect around him. His fingers were everywhere, making a superb and incredibly lewd squelching noise.
It was true, Harry was still feeling the erotic charge of their previous encounter. That was how it always was with Draco, the man was a like a magnet drawing Harry in, the draw irresistible. Massaging shampoo into his hair, Harry let the bubbles roll down his sides and his front.
“Oh, yes... okay. Sorry” Harry looked down at his husband, shivering a little in the cool of the evening. The heat had left his body and a shower sounded wonderful. “I just knew I had to say something... We’ll talk later though. Stay here and I’ll get the shower warm for you.”
Harry smiled at how much effort Draco had gone to. The omega looked like the height of professionalism and he was sure that it would set the right tone with Ollivander. He swallowed; deeply before speaking, hoping his tone wouldn’t betray his shock at the recent news he’d heard.
The next day dawned bright and early, and Harry, used to being on the quidditch pitch for training at all hours, was up with it.
was why. Draco didn't know how to deal with adorable Harry all the time. Of course they had arguments, but a lot less toxic than their teenager years.  Draco swallowed hard, the idea of never having a baby hurting him deeply.
Draco looked at Harry, his eyes filling with unshed tears. He didn't know. He didn't know if he'd even be able to
"Don't chew, Alpha. We need to eat it together," Draco teased, before leaning and licking the chocolate out of Harry's neck. He went slowly, licking him, biting, sucking, giving all the attention he could at each little part of him.
Harry reflected the next day, as he held his soft, warm
-x-x-x-
They had to find the middle ground if they wanted to be together.
Draco reached for the first thing in his hands reach - a vase, from his mother - and threw it to the other side of the room, with a desperate scream full of sadness and anger.
alpha?
He knew only Harry could give it to him. And weirdly, after a whole life of feeling out of place, two years after feeling happy and complete as a woman, he now felt, more than never, a man.
"What are you looking at, arsehole? Move!" Draco shoved the money on the man's chest, ripping the coffee away from his hands and banging the door on his face. "
“Come in my mouth, Harry...” she asked between breaths, not giving him space to breath.
She closed her eyes, her body feeling like it was exploding. Merlin, how she needed it.
He felt his face redden, thinking about how tight Draco’s cunt always felt around his hard member, and best to get him slicked up, and ready for sex.
Harry found kissed the side of Draco’s neck, and the top of his shoulder. Delighted little kisses that punctuated his words. Harry knew that he wanted a family, wanted babies with this man that he’d fallen so in love with, and he could hardly wait.
Draco smiled tiredly, and licked his own lips.
would get tired of
He hoped not to die today. Whether his body or his feelings.
“Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm doing everything wrong.”
Harry peered over the top of the guide book at his husband. Draco’s cultural appetite for everything Venice has to offer seemed to know no bounds. Somehow, Draco looked a little different this morning, but Harry couldn’t put his finger on it.
When he entered his bedroom, he wasted no time before putting a locking spell on the door, a silencing spell around the room and looking at Harry, already taking off his clothes.
He stroked her heels, massaged her toes and squeezing all around, enjoying making his loved one feel good.
surprised to hear from Draco. He’d never heard that panicked tone of voice on the omega, and was certainly mystified as to why hearing from Ginny, of all people, would put anybody into such an upset.
Draco held onto Harry's arms, looking at him in the eye.
As Draco arrived home himself, and closed the door behind him, he was welcomed with silence and solitude.
The whole time, Draco was silent. She wouldn't let Jasmine go, and even when they asked for her statement, she just wouldn't speak, mumbling things as “Jasmine fell and...”, “she tried to take her...”. She felt weak and scared, so scared, that she tried as hard as she could to not look up.
Apparently, there’d been a wizarding community in northeastern Brazil for hundreds of years.
Harry was so proud of Draco; he was talking Harry’s cock so well and his cunt was spread wide and beautiful around him. Harry knew he was starting to come when his cock spread so wide he could no longer move it inside his lover.
"I'm very excited to meet Lyra, too. That day we had before was barely enough," Draco finished his toast, sipping on his coffee thoughtfully. "I... I just wanted to make you happy. You were so good to me yesterday, and I wanted to give you something... I think I'd be open to cook together, I'm just not good at it, as you can see," Draco laughed a bit, and then looked at Harry, sighing.
“Draco, your body, your cock... You’re beautifully formed, and when you go down on me, I won’t last long because you drive me to distraction. I want this... You. So badly...”
“We’ve learnt loads about the War at school... Learnt about the prejudice that led to people becoming Death Eaters, and how poisonous it was. Well, that woman was just as full of hatred. She immediately used slurs, and threats against this lady... And she was violent towards her too. Tried to snatch her baby! I’d have tried to do something, but I’m scared to use magic out of school... I’d be expelled! Anyway, her husband only used a defensive spell... Not a curse, or an
“Well, you’re a sight for sore eyes. You’re obviously using your Healer skills to heal those too, because I’m feeling better just looking at you...”
Draco moaned loud when Harry touched his nipples, his body arching towards Harry's hand. He was already hard and wet by now, and he tried to open his legs even more so Harry could touch him.
Harry felt incredibly pleased that Draco had been brave enough to say what she wanted. He knew how hard she’d found the previous few months, and how much she’d struggled with her body image.
"Is your office to your tastes? Is it missing anything?" Draco noticed it needed to be cleaned. The floor was a little dusty, probably because the office was closed before Potter, and no one had minded the floor. He'd have to make a call to General Services. "I'll be checking on you constantly, so if you ever need anything, I'll be here. We like to be present to our employees," Draco said, his body feeling a little hot.
Harry reached over to give Draco a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth, and positioned himself so their bodies touched everywhere.
? Like omegas were objects to be bartered? Nott will never understand that omegas are special because they can bear children, because they can grow
Harry knew it was only a matter of time: he’d long ago accepted everything in his life was column inches. He decided on a dinner party at their home, a lovely warm affair to tell all the people he loved the biggest news of his life. Over a dessert of treacle tart and strawberry ice cream Harry made a speech.
Draco was angry that Harry even suggested it. She held Jasmine as if he was going to snatch her and hand her to Lucius.
Oh, Lord. That was Lyra's
Draco had her eyes open wide, panic starting to show on her features.
Harry woke before Draco. Looking down at him, he thought how sexy it would be to wake him with a blow job. Maybe tomorrow. Today Draco would have to be content with a massage. Sipping his hand under the t-shirt, Harry spread his fingers. He wanted Draco to feel fantastic.
!" Draco held his legs tightly, his cock once again hard. He was sticky, wet, with come all over himself, but he was so, so deep into the moment that he didn't care. He thanked God because it was Friday and he had the whole weekend to himself. He told his parents he'd be travelling to visit Olivander's this weekend, so they weren't expecting him... He could do what he wanted with Harry. All he wanted.
Harry lathered up his hands, stroking them down Draco’s arms and all over his front. He took his time, tracing circles all over his husband’s skin, wanting to show him how much he was desired. He ran shampoo through the stands of Draco’s hair, carefully cleaning away the evidence of their earlier activities.
He was sad. He couldn't help it. He was confused, and lost, and his feelings were all over the place. He felt like crying all the time, but he held on.
Draco was so nervous. He had never gone to a date, and he didn't know what to wear. Modern omega, traditional omega?  Well, he was in a place that people might watch him, so he decided to go full traditional. He put on a black dress, with short sleeves and a square cleavage. He put on a silver necklace with a single emerald on it, and the same heels he was wearing earlier.  His hair he put on a side braid and chapstick on his lips. He looked at himself in the mirror satisfied with what he looked like before his doorbell rang.
"It is too late, Mother. I'm bonded and no longer virgin. I gave myself to Harry. My heart, my body and my soul. Father would never take me back."
“Okay, okay...” she said, but her face showed that it was nothing but okay.
“Absolutely. Lead the way Draco. We’ll get breakfast on the way.”
Her body was more of an invite than her words could ever be, and as she moved over his cock, Harry felt his length spasm with need....
Unable to restrain himself in the heat of the moment, Harry found himself pulling off Draco’s shirt roughly, finding his swollen, sensitive nipples with his lips. Harry loved Draco’s nipples even more than before; and he lavished licks and kisses everywhere his mouth could reach, sucking the tender nub, and flicking it with his tongue.
In the meantime, the trip was great, and Harry was amused at some of the strange opinions his husband seemed to hold. A trip to the Guggenheim Gallery has demonstrated the wide gulf in experience between them. Draco had rhapsodised about a strange Jackson Pollock painting, declaring it definitely wizard in origin. Harry could see was splashes of paint and a very expensive price tag!
“My tits are sore too... Maybe you could massage them with your hands and mouth?”
He missed Draco’s comforting presence terribly, though, and every cell in his body yearned for his loved one’s company. Many times he picked up his phone, and unconsciously began to tap out a message. It would have been too easy though, to have broken and spoken to him, and he had to admit he was very tempted.
He sighed, and cleared his throat.
He could tell that she still felt sad, but he knew that her mood would rise soon.
The calendar fell to the floor.
Draco felt her cheeks turn bright red, and she was immediately awake when she saw that man, naked and
When she got back to their bedroom, Jasmine was sleeping soundly. What did Harry do to her?  It made Draco a little angry because it wasn't her who put their baby to sleep, but she was thankful that Jasmine was sleeping now.
game shouldn’t take much preparation... We’ll have time to explore, see some sights... A last adventure before the baby.”
He was turned on, his swollen cock wet and leaking, aching for a knot Harry knew was never going to happen.
“Back to the factory after breakfast, then,” Harry yawned, stretching in his chair. “I wish we didn’t have to, love,” he followed in a quieter voice. “I just want to go on an old fashioned
Harry felt shocked when Draco grabbed his cock, and he nearly moaned aloud. He’d just wanted to pleasure Draco, to make her feel like a woman deserved to feel, but this felt amazing.
this kid! You do not deserve to have any child, imagine Harry Potter's child, you trash! Give her to me, I'll be a way better mother than you'll ever pretend to be!”
“Take off your clothes, omega,” Harry demanded, insanely desperate to see Draco nude, and conscious that they’d be ruined soon if they didn’t disappear... His heart was racing in his chest, and every inch of Harry’s skin was awash with goosebumps. The friction of his cock rubbing against Draco felt beautiful, and Harry knew if he wasn’t careful he’d come just from frotting alone, like some seventeen year old virgin.
now it was finally time to leave. He knew he oughtn’t to be late. It was only tonight that the veil between the magical and the natural world would fade to nothingness.
“I think, Draco, that this room is rather too fancy for me. Too neat. What do you say, shall we mess it up a touch?”
that’s needs forgiveness, Draco. You forget how well I know you. You’re not selfish or cowardly, but you
Also he was obviously aroused.
Harry collected his notes for the meeting, and walked towards the conference room. He was being ridiculous, but he felt like a joyous teenager. Like alpha with their first scent infatuation. He shook his head, needing to be professional.
This beautiful, wonderful person, his
She felt great. A little sore, but magic did wonders to heal her. They put her on a hospital robe before a mediwitch came to talk to them.
Draco released a surprised squeal, his legs closing slightly with the weird and unexpected sensation, what caused Harry's finger to slip out of him with his movements.
“We don't have a little James, but how do you feel about Jasmine?” Draco asked, her voice small and tired, but a smile on her lips. She was all about traditions, and she wanted Harry's family tradition to be followed too. A little flower, she wasn't expecting that. But she came and Draco thought it was the perfect name for a baby called Jim their entire eight month's life.
"I really want to go home."
that you
Harry slipped in his tongue, teasing Draco terribly, please with the squeaky tone he’d managed to elicit from the omega.
Draco's voice was filled with expectations, and he looked at Harry as the waiter came.
He looked his leg around one of Harry's, and the other one, he grabbed his waist. He kissed Harry as if his life depended on it. His hands went up, holding his hair and moving his body against Harry's.
Harry looked up as the door opened, smoothing his features into a bland smile, and masking his annoyance about being disturbed.
"How about we get some dessert? I feel like having some chocolate." Draco suggested, a smile on his face.
Harry pulled apart Draco’s legs and lavished kisses on the sensitive, white skin of his thighs. At each touch, Harry felt his magic tingle through every nerve and shivers run down his spine. This felt different, somehow, and the sight of Draco wantonly showing his body for Harry’s consumption was a turn on like nothing else he’d ever seen...
her family so badly (in fact, he’d have to tell her soon that the baby had been born. She and her girlfriend would be so pleased!). He only had his Godfather for a short amount of time, his uncle had been abysmal, and Dumbledore had only really used him for his own ends. He hoped he didn’t let Jasmine down.
“Harry... Oh, Harry... I want you so, so much...”
Bonding with Draco has been the best decision that Harry had ever made. Their lives together were a triumph over all those people who’d thought they’d never work, or that Draco couldn’t ever manage life as a traditional omega. He did, every single day, and was a perfect partner and parent.
“Don't worry, Mother. I'll be there at least twice a week. You won't be alone,” he said with a tight smile.
As soon as he was sure Draco was deeply asleep, Harry slipped away. It was early, not even eight yet and he wanted to do a little research. He made sure to put the leftovers in the fridge, and sat down heavily on the settee after finding himself a beer.
“Harry, I want loads of this cheese so we can eat it at home. Ask their price,” she nudged him on the ribs.
“Oh, I’m sure that your 67 year old betrothed would have shown you a good time,” Harry teases. “They could have gone to sleep at eight, and you’d have been rid of them in a few years. Not me, love. I want us to be together for as long as we’re given.”
Draco raised his arms, hugging Harry by his shoulders and leaning into the kiss. He had the late thought that Harry had all access to his house with the key number, and maybe he shouldn't have left the door open like he did, but he was far too gone to think about it. His heat was still there, lingering inside him, waiting for Harry to do what he was supposed to do and breed him.
Harry was right, the afternoon dragged on horribly. Nott seemed terribly interested in him too, coming to his department for several so-called
Harry was shocked out of his thoughts by Draco’s return. His
Harry loved how slick Draco had gotten, and he lapped at the wet heat of his lover’s cunt and cock. Harry took big lungfuls of Draco’s scent too, feeling more and more turned on. His cock was hard in his trousers, and he pulled away for a moment to wrestle himself out of his, sweaty, confining shirt.
“No, please, don't heal them. I like the memories this pain gives me...” Draco smiled, closing his eyes and smiling as Harry massaged his head to clean his hair.
Harry had even brought a dozen Narcissi flowers which he’d placed in a large vase on their table.
Of course, Harry decided, Draco
, thought Harry as the door shut,
The idea that Draco had ever considered using spells to change his appearance was devastating. He thought the man in front of him was beautiful - a gift that had been created to fulfil his every dream - and he wanted to hex anyone who’d ever made him feel less than perfect. He wanted Draco to be proud of his body, and he’d stand by him every moment until he was.
Harry took Draco at her word and sent a patronus to her mother. Narcissa, Harry knew would be beyond joyful at the birth of a granddaughter; a little flower to lavish love and care upon. Jasmine would be the most loved and adored of babies.
You’ve given me my life, given me a future. I was happy before I met you, but I wasn’t fully alive. We’ve got everything going for us... I’ve no doubt we’ll have a baby; a brother or sister for Lyra; we’ll have decades of happiness. And you’ve given up so much to be with me, love. I’m going to make it worth it. Adore you forever. You’re my darling, and you always will be.”
Harry warmed Draco up a little with some light slaps with the back of his hand. He made sure to rub and sooth between each slap. He made an effort to keep his slaps gentle and light, but slowly increased the pressure till he was leaving red marks.
"Alpha...!
"You can eat now, Alpha. Is it a good dessert?"
Draco looked for a cup or something to put on the flowers, filled it with water and put the flowers inside.
Draco laughed, biting on his sandwich and moaning happily.
He manoeuvred their bodies till there was hardly any space left between them, and placed Draco’s hand on his hard shaft, tending his trousers.
Once again, a healer came to take her baby, and although Draco allowed it, her eyes never lost her baby for a second. The healers were throwing cleaning and healing spells over both of them, but Draco seemed to have lost awareness of her own body. She even drank the potion a healer gave her without listening to what it was.
Draco felt like crying with the intensity of everything. Harry was assaulting him and he couldn't even defend himself from the intense pleasure. His cunt was twitching with the need of being filled, and also was his arsehole, every time Harry put his fingers closer and closer.
have more friends like you.”
Harry wandered back through, and gazed at Draco sleeping. He looked so innocent and exhausted. Harry lay down next to him, closing his eyes for just a moment. He must have been more tired that he had imagined, for he fell asleep in a matter of minutes.
A whole day in the air never failed to net Harry a few injuries. As he took in his appearance in the mirror, he realised that age was catching him up a bit. The spells didn’t heal him as quick as they used to, and the bruises on his knuckles and torso looked angry.
As soon as they got home, Harry sent Draco straight up to the bathroom, telling her to have a bath. He could see she was dreadfully upset, but the last thing he wanted was a big hysterical scene. He loved Draco immensely, but right at this moment he couldn’t offer her the comfort she needed. Harry was just too furious, his mind racing, simply too mad with a world that was so unforgiving that he had been forced to take up his wand to defend his family.
in the world,” Harry agreed. “And that’s all that really matters.”
“I need to clean up first.
They’d had a passionate thrust behind a curtain in the conference room; he’d given Draco a gorgeous blow-job under his desk, and they’d even got heavy and panting in their stationary cupboard. Harry wasn’t an idiot, he knew that people in their business were talking, and he knew the alpha spreading all the gossip as well.
Now they were alone, Harry thought it was time to bring up a subject that had been worrying him. He’d thought they’d have more time - never imagining that their baby make such an early appearance- and he’d not wanted to upset Draco either.
Draco smiled at Harry's retort, but didn't say anything in return due to his other co-workers arriving. He carefully put his hair back on place, hiding his neck once again so the alphas on the team wouldn't be looking at him with fake modesty. He always knew when people were looking at his neck. 'My eyes are up here' was a phrase he constantly said on his head.
"I want it, Harry... But... I'm... Don't do too much... I'll have to sit on my desk tomorrow... " Draco laughed a bit, his laughter strained by pleasure.
Harry’s heart lurched in his chest. Draco wasn’t saying a word but he couldn’t help but wonder if Nott was behind Draco’s sudden low mood. Draco was shivering, and every part of Harry’s alpha personality rose to the fore. His omega was in trouble, and he felt like he needed to help him - immediately.
It was a different feeling, but it was definitely a good feeling. Draco wanted more, but he wanted Harry to go slow still.
“I cannot think of anything I want more at this moment than you. I want to be inside you, as close as we can humanly be,” Harry murmured. He was already so hard, full of emotion and attraction, all focused on Draco.
you might have dreamed up, it doesn’t matter as long as the works getting done. Now, if you’ll excuse me-”
“You’re so hot... So fucking gorgeous. You’re going to feel this all night, and all day tomorrow, baby.”
They seemed like the perfect breed. They’d be wonderful company for Draco and Jasmine while he was playing away games, and Luna had told him that their dog would defined his husband and child with his
“A night on the settee with you sounds... Well, it’s perfect. I... I don’t know, Draco. I don’t know what I can say to you. I can’t convey my thoughts into words. I... I just love you, Draco, and I think for the immediate future that might have to be enough...”
Well, thought Harry, this was a surprise...
. What kind of man accepts that? Accepts another alpha impregnating the mother of your child? If you don’t promise here and now to pull your claws out of Draco, then it’ll be the worst for you... Make no mistake.”
"Mr. Ollivander?" He greeted, a bit too aware of the old alpha calling him, and he was greeted with the warm, grandfatherly tone of the man.
“Are we going to see the city? If so, I really want to change clothes before.”
Harry felt like he’d died once more, and gone to heaven when the warm slick of Draco’s cunt surrounded him, holding his cock so tight. His skin felt hot and tight, his body on fire.
Harry noticed that Draco’s lovely mood had slipped away and it saddened him terribly.
He threw them away, sitting back again and showing off his upper body, a mischievous smile on his lips.
"Of course, sir. Tell me the time and day."
“I’ll get two of their chocolate tortes delivered up to the presidential suite then,” he murmured, placing his hand over the omega’s and not caring who saw. Harry felt intoxicated by the lights, the flowers and the romance of the evening. He stood then, and paid for their dinner, arranging for the dessert order to be sent straight up to their room. Harry felt excited at the prospect of food play with Draco, and he was already half-hard at the prospect.
he seemed more protective of you. Said some old-fashioned alpha bollocks about having an ex-partner, but I didn’t really think anything of it.”
“I don’t know, Draco... you’ve never suggested that kind of act before... of course I want to, I’m desperate for you. If you want to touch, really truly, then we can... but I think we should try that first....”
When he fell from his height, he held on to Harry's shoulders and whispered to his ears.
"Do you think you could live like this for life?  Do you think you could handle me for eternity, even when I get soggy and ugly and old? I... Every day I spend with you I think that this is it for me. I'd love to have you forever. And it kills me inside thinking that I... That we..."
“Of course not. I was wearing that when we met. When we were eleven.”
Draco looked at Harry with furrowed eyebrows, then walked to their sofa and sat down, thinking for a moment. Hand rested over the bump, Draco thought for a couple of minutes before answering.
After the others had showed their results, Draco said his goodbyes and thank yous, sending all of them to the snack area, where some snacks would be served. As he was turning off his laptop and TV, he noticed someone behind him.
