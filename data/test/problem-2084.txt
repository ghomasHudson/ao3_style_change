Unlike Harry, there’s no softness or sweetness to Malfoy. He pushes me against the wall and shoves a knee between my legs. His teeth bite at my lip and his nails dig into my shoulders. But I find myself meeting the challenge of his sharpness: I yank him closer, scrape a hand through his stupid pretty hair and
Kreacher tutted. “Master must reclaim his position in society,” he said reproachfully. “A House’s influence relies on keeping itself in the consciousness of the proletariat. Kreacher’s Mistress taught him that.”
Ron cleared his throat and looked at Harry apologetically. “I wouldn’t be so sure. You can’t get out of a marriage contract. That was the whole point of them: signing one was the ultimate mark of commitment. No avoiding it. No loopholes.”
“Touch me,” Draco demanded, his tone not imperious but high with desperate pleasure – even worse for Harry’s willpower. “Harry, please – Touch me – Touch me, I’m so close–”
Draco raises a hand and holds it near Potter’s face. He fancies he can even feel the echo of heat coming from Potter’s cheeks. “This really is very impressive charmwork,” he murmurs.
Malfoy. He knew the cool lick of his magic, the sharp movements of his wand, the tantalising stretch and twist of his body. The pounding in Harry’s head increased in tempo along with his heartbeat, until Harry could feel both rhythms on his skin, his spells timed with it, the whole world in sync with the pulsing beat.
His thighs clench, and he groans loudly, deeply, shoving his dick forwards as he spills into Harry’s mouth. Harry drinks it up greedily – Malfoy’s come tastes just as good as his blood, just as hot and full of life. He sucks until the last weak spurt, until Malfoy is squirming and whimpering, then he sucks some more, savouring the post-orgasm pepper of Malfoy’s blood.
Malfoy tilted his face up. His mouth was suddenly startlingly close to Harry’s. For the first time in days, Harry felt wide awake.
With a low moan, Harry finally let himself look. He lifted his head and allowed his gaze to drag down Draco’s body, the flush that flared over his chest, the lattice of blue and charcoal over his smooth skin, and, gloriously, his cock, hard and flushed and mouth-watering, thrusting slowly in and out of Harry’s hand.
Harry’s embarrassment returned. He dropped his gaze. “So I’ll, er, see you tomorrow? Same time as usual?”
Malfoy ended the spell. “Of course I can.” He smirked at Harry’s outrage. “If someone were to use Legilimency to try to access your memories, they wouldn’t be a Muggle, would they?”
It’s achingly slow at first. My eyes want to close against the ecstasy that drags at me, but I force them open, drinking in the sight of Draco biting his lip, pain and pleasure warring on his red face. And Harry—
When Harry finally lifts his head, Malfoy is sprawled on the bed, his limbs loose. Harry retains just enough of himself to focus on Malfoy’s pulse points – his heartbeat is fast, but strong enough – then he rolls Malfoy onto his front and leans over him.
It was something Harry had considered often during his lonely afternoons in Muggle London. He was fairly convinced that Malfoy liked him well enough now – he was slightly more convinced, after Saturday night. But the only interactions Harry had seen between Malfoy and the old Harry involved an awful lot of scowling and glaring. And, given what Ron and Hermione had told him, the memories that Malfoy had shown him were probably the best of a bad bunch. What would happen if Harry got his memory back? Would Malfoy go back to hating him? Would Harry go back to hating Malfoy?
– was slowly disappearing between Harry’s lips. Harry’s eyes – they didn’t look like that in real life, surely – were fixed on Malfoy’s. Malfoy swore and thrust upwards, pushing himself deeper into Harry’s mouth. Harry took all of him, all the way down. Malfoy threw his head back, the lines of his throat making Harry’s mouth water, and groaned.
Malfoy noticed. For a moment, he looked like he had in the Leaky Cauldron: wild, wanting. “Merlin. Yes. I can’t begin to tell you what I–” He shook his head. “But it’s not – I shouldn’t like it. You don’t remember who I am–”
“Do that too. We’ll come to that. But over the next few days, find the time to do something new. Something different.” He arched an eyebrow. “From what you’ve told me, it shouldn’t be difficult.”
“Merlin,” Draco grinds into Potter’s hip, squeezes Potter’s cock. Potter’s groan feels almost as good as the hard line of his erection. “Merlin, I want to fuck you so much,” Draco breathes.
Suddenly overcome with urgency, Harry barely made it off the hill and to a quiet street before he Apparated into the alleyway behind the Leaky Cauldron, only to stumble straight into Malfoy, who was peering through the grimy window into the pub. He straightened guiltily.
Healer Malfoy’s grey eyes lingered on Harry in a way Harry was quite used to. “I do,” Malfoy said quietly. “A pleasure to meet you.” He nodded his head at Hermione. “Granger.”
A smile. “Yes.” He held up his wand from under the desk. “Very good. I’m impressed. That’s quite a lot of progress for one session. We’ll end it here for today.”
“I – yes.” Harry watched with fascination as Malfoy’s expression settled into one of distant, polite professionalism. His thin shoulders pulled back into a clean line and he reached out to straighten the quill on his desk.
Sweet ecstasy bursts forth. Harry growls and sucks hard, drowning, dizzy. Malfoy moans, his building arousal hot and heady in Harry’s mouth. Malfoy’s blood rushes through him, warming his body, filling his cock.
I don’t understand. I was so tense anticipating the upcoming goodbye (rejection) that I have no idea how to handle this easy acceptance. Unfortunately, being this on edge is not a good time for someone to be climbing over you; Draco’s cock has barely dragged against mine before those old Auror training instincts finally kick in. I hook a leg between his and flip him over, pinning him beneath me by the wrists.
The first time Malfoy had asked to revisit Harry’s mental space, Harry had panicked and shoved Malfoy out of his head. Malfoy had blinked at him, shocked, and Harry had blurted something about needing the bathroom and had dashed from the room. He’d sat in the stairwell, heels of his palms pressed against his eyes, and had fought to stuff his desperate longing for Malfoy behind just one of the doors in his mind, rather than split between all four of them. The door had been reluctant to close, annoyingly disobedient for something that was literally a figment of Harry’s imagination, but Harry had managed it. He’d returned to Malfoy’s office feeling sick, his fingernails digging half-moon grooves into his palms. The door had shuddered when Malfoy’s consciousness flowed into the circular stone room of Harry’s mental space, but it had held.
Malfoy tilts his face up. “I asked if you wanted to fuck me,” he says, enunciating clearly even through his satisfied little smirk. “Or if you want to fuck Harry, I suppose. Or if you want one of us to fuck you? We’re flexible.”
“Maybe,” Malfoy allowed. “But the point stands: being able to hide information in your head may give you the skills to reveal it.”
“It was the same night as – as Dumbledore. One of the Death Eaters I let into Hogwarts was called Fenrir Greyback. He attacked Bill.”
“Tell me if I’m being too forward,” he said in a low voice. His gaze raked greedily over Draco’s face. “But seeing you here really is… God.”
Harry pinched himself to make sure he wasn’t inside one of his own fantasies – but there was a twist to Malfoy’s expression that Harry had never been able to capture in his imagination. It was suddenly very hard to breathe. This was real. This was happening.
“Erm. Draco, I think he said? He’s the new specialist Brisley brought in.” Harry frowned at Ron’s appalled expression. “Why? Who’s Lucius?”
“Did … Did it not work?” he asked, trying not to sound disappointed. Malfoy was supposed to be amazing at this.
The world is narrowing around me. I can no longer see the fairylike glints from the ridiculous chandelier, the gleam of the dark, polished wood of the bed, the stupid giant gilt-edged mirror that looks like it belongs in a palace. I can’t hear the crackle of the fire or the clunky ticks of the grandfather clock by the door. All I know is the roaring in my ears and the quake of my thighs and Malfoy’s gorgeous mouth and clever tongue and tight throat taking me apart while Harry watches with dark eyes and wet, swollen, parted lips.
“I don’t know who I am, or who you are, or why I woke up in this weird house with unsettling snake-head decor and a bad-tempered elf.”
“You’re going to have to line yourself up,” Draco said, voice rough. He hovered over Harry. His bound ankles rested on Harry’s thighs. “My hands…”
See, Grimmauld Place has five floors and eight bedrooms and a house-elf to bring food to whatever dark corner you’re hiding from your husband in. The Hogsmeade flat has two bedrooms, one bathroom, and an open-plan kitchen and living room. Even though Harry is finally back at Hogwarts during the day (a fact that makes his throat tight with joy if he thinks about it too hard), he’s seeing an awful lot more of Draco than he’s ever done before.
“There are more,” Harry said, his breath hot on Draco’s mouth. “There are more memories, but I got distracted. It was an accident—”
He lets out a breath of laughter and starts to rock his hips. I squeeze his cock but bite my lip to stop myself reacting further—the moment feels too fragile to ruin with a groan of pleasure.
“Ugh, me neither,” Malfoy says with an exaggerated shudder. Then he pauses and tilts his head. “Although—the one who works with dragons…”
Potter’s only reaction to Draco’s first finger is a quiet, strained exhalation. By the third, he’s cursing again, fucking himself on Draco’s hand, his head hanging downwards, and Draco can’t think – can’t think of anything other than
“And afterwards,” Harry continued, “I promise I’ll back off. I won’t ask anything else of you, I won’t even mention it again. Not until I get my memory back. Or until we’re sure I’m stuck like this for good.” The memory of the freckled girl thanking him for something he didn’t remember doing resurfaced with a pang. He brushed it away. Malfoy was still staring at him.
Draco lifted his head and replaced his mouth with his hand. He stroked lightly, slowly, the barest teasing touch. Harry’s cock strained upwards.
on his thoughts. It’s so much better being able to see him like this, being able to see all of him, his flushed face, his tight nipples, his gorgeous, wet, mouth-watering prick. Draco’s hips snap forward and it’s like a dam breaking – he can’t hold back a moan of pleasure, can’t stop himself thrusting harder, sharper, deeper, bending Potter in half and fucking him with everything he has.
They’re on their way to the library. Harry would rather not be on his way to the library, as the library contains no places to hide from the stares. But when Hermione is your closest friend,
“I just…” Malfoy shook his head, his eyes still fixed on Harry’s. “We’ve been drinking. It would be easy to say something we’d regret.”
“Exactly, it’s an incredibly important issue!” the witch on the right said. “So, what do you think, Mr Potter? Are you interested?”
Harry was absolutely going to revisit the memory of the phrase “intimate situation” rolling out of Malfoy’s mouth. He swallowed.
Draco manoeuvred above him with difficulty, shuffling forwards inch by awkward inch, his knees free but his ankles tied, his arms still twined behind his back. Harry kept his hands on Draco’s narrow waist, fingers tightening in anticipation more than assistance.
He shoved Draco backwards—lightly, but Draco was taken by surprise and fell against the pillows with an involuntary
By the time the evening rolled around, Harry was convinced Malfoy had tricked him. It was all too convenient, Malfoy showing up in the middle of the case with a perfect excuse to distract him. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy for years, and all of a sudden, Harry is the person Malfoy turns to when he’s in trouble? It didn’t make sense. And when Malfoy’s apparent penchant for Aurors was factored in – well. Something was going on.
“You’re so impatient, Potter,” Draco said softly, an indulgent emphasis on Harry’s surname. “It’s very sexy, you know.” And, with no further warning, he lifted himself up and slid down again with a low moan.
) that Draco has even this short stretch of solitude. Even so, there are enough eighth year boys skulking around the castle that he casts a series of privacy charms at the closed door before he feels comfortable enough to reach under the bed for the thing that has been on his mind for months.
The flush deepened. “Well, I noticed you were staring a bit, this last hour,” Malfoy admitted. “I thought you were just dozy from the drink.”
“This is normal,” Malfoy said, his voice cutting through Harry’s increasingly frantic thoughts. “Gently guide yourself back to the moments after you first woke up.”
“Night, Hermione,” Harry said over Ron’s objection. He stalked out of the pub without waiting for a response.
“Imagine the way a dream slips through your fingers, the way a collection of memories swirls in a Pensieve,” Malfoy continued. “Thoughts are fluid, dynamic things. Like liquid, thoughts are easy to direct, but just as easy to lose control of. Fighting your mind’s natural current is like standing in the middle of a river and trying to hold the water back by force. You must instead gently guide the stream until it flows to your will.”
to Parkinson), over Dean, Seamus and Padma, towards the till where, oh, yep—Malfoy is jabbing his finger onto the menu, sneering at the bemused bartender. He’s so bloody pale he’s practically luminous. I don’t know how I missed him.
“So,” Harry murmured, placing his hands either side of Draco’s head. “Do you actually use ‘Jarvey Janglers’ as a safeword, or is there something else I should keep an ear out for?”
Malfoy had clawed back some of his professional veneer, but his edges were blurred by alcohol, by embarrassment. “Not necessarily,” he hedged. His gaze darted back and forth between Harry’s eyes, to his mouth, back up again. “Potentially, it could mean that the barrier holding back your memories is weakening. That some aspect of your old self is leaking through. That would be a good thing, of course.”
I close my eyes. My dick is still far too interested in my best friend’s sex life and I squirm as subtly as I can, trying to get it to sit more comfortably.
“I’m not sure she realised what a magnet I am for trouble,” Harry said wryly. “She could have picked a better protector.”
“Fuck, that’s weird— I can feel—” Harry’s laugh was half-moan. “I can feel myself— Feels like I’m fucking you, fuck,
Fuelled by his fury, Harry stormed through his morning routine and arrived at Malfoy’s office thirty minutes early. Malfoy was already there, writing serenely in his notebook.
Harry allowed Hermione to fuss over him, swapping his flower and tweaking his robes and tidying his hair. As he waited, he inhaled another big lungful of castle-scented air and held his breath, keeping in the comforting mustiness for as long as possible.
” and clenches around us, his stomach tightening and his thighs seizing and his arse pulsing as he comes. His spunk splashes onto me and my hips stutter—fuck, that’s so hot—but Harry fucks us both through it, his cock dragging against mine inside Draco’s tight, clenching heat.
The box definitely says thirty. Draco grabs the scroll of parchment and scans through the first page. Every mention of the time limit has it spelled out: T-H-I-R-T-Y. There’s no way he could be misreading. He looks over his shoulder to check that Potter is still there, and he’s startled to see Potter walking towards him, beautiful, naked, unselfconscious.
“Granger’s notes said that you had a negative experience trying to learn Occlumency.” Malfoy’s face and tone were so mild and professional that Harry thought he must have imagined the disdain. He shook his head, annoyed at himself – he was letting Ron’s dislike of Malfoy get to him, just like Hermione had said. “I’m hoping you’ll find this a little easier,” Malfoy continued, “since we’ll be working together rather than against each other.”
Harry doesn’t even roll his eyes at the insult. I didn’t really mean it, but still—a token reaction would be nice. Instead, one side of his mouth turns upwards into this dopey little grin. I’m torn between hating it and being over the bloody moon that he has someone who makes him look like that.
“Brisley is still technically in charge of your case. I’ll send her a memo and get you set up with a team.” As he was talking, Malfoy pulled out a clean piece of parchment and started to write. “You should get in touch with Weasley and Granger and let them know it’s likely you’ve had a breakthrough. It would be useful to have one of them with you.” He signed the parchment with a flourish and waved his hand. It folded itself into the shape of a nightingale. Malfoy drew his wand and pointed it at the paper bird. He paused. “As soon as I send this, Brisley will be right over. If you’re not absolutely sure you want to press ahead, now would be the time to say so.”
Harry grinned. He hadn’t really thought so. One evening, Ron had given him an impassioned recounting of Hermione’s romantic history – including a twenty-minute lecture on the many faults of Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum – and, although it was hardly a riveting conversation, Harry didn’t remember anyone named Malfoy. But his question had done its job: the strained tension that filled the room had broken.
But, a couple of drinks in, Malfoy across the table from him looking soft and smudged and flustered, it didn’t seem like that big of a deal.
“Before that,” Harry says. He’s watching me carefully, all traces of sleep wiped away. His hand shot under the pillow when I moved—if I lift the elf-woven cotton and premium goose-feather, I know I’ll find his knuckles white around his wand. “I thought you got it. We didn’t mean— We didn’t mean just once. Remember? I said we wanted someone to keep Draco busy when I wasn’t in the mood.”
It was hard to walk away. That new coolness inside Harry’s chest protested at each step; he almost gave in, almost turned around and grabbed Draco’s hand, intending to drag him along—then he heard Parkinson drawl, “Miserable little shit, isn’t he?” and he found that his desire to get away from
He looked around wildly—but they were safe, still inside 12 Grimmauld Place. In fact, they were two floors up from the kitchen, in the second room on the left.
He waits as long as he can. It’s not quite five minutes. It probably isn’t even three. But any longer and he’ll risk ripping the door off its hinges in his desperation to get upstairs.
“Are you busy after Christmas?” Harry blurted. “Can I – I’d like to come over, maybe. Do the thing where we spend time together outside of work. If you want to.”
Drinking blood turns Harry on. It’s just how his biology works; the blood he drinks rushes through him, fills his whole body, including his cock, which then reacts how a hard cock always reacts: like it wants to be touched, like it wants to fuck. But it’s still not quite the same as getting turned on properly, mentally, having the thought of sex take over your mind for a long, hot moment. That’s a feeling you can still get as a vampire, Harry learned five days after he was turned. It’s a feeling he gets every time, with Malfoy.
Potter is looking at him, mouth agape, like he’s never seen him before. His wide eyes dart between Draco’s like he’s trying to figure something out, like he’s searching for something, but isn’t sure what he’s looking for.
“Nope,” Harry said. “I mean, he apologised to me yesterday and I suggested he do the same to you, but I didn’t think he actually would. I’d forgotten all about it, to be honest.”
“White ones. They’re supposed to be good luck, according to Luna. It’s a bit of a stupid superstition, honestly, but at least the sun wasn’t shining.” He propped his elbows on the table and leaned forwards as if sharing a secret. “For watching white walruses, wetter weather is better weather.”
“We might yet find a solution,” Hermione said with a glance at Harry. “You might not have to go through with it.”
In November, the Aurors found out what had happened to him. Harry had expected the discovery to be a comfort.
“You managed to dress yourself, then?” Draco asked, looking Harry up and down. “Or did poor Kreacher have to help you?”
Malfoy’s quill stilled on the page of his notebook. “Good morning,” he said warily. “You’re awfully chirpy.”
Malfoy gazed at him for a long moment, the suggestion of his smirk still lingering at the corners of his mouth. Then he straightened and laced his fingers together, suddenly all business. “Shall we get started with today’s session? I’d like to spend more time working with your earliest memories to test your recall.”
“That’s not a bad idea,” Harry growled, and with a wave of his wand, Malfoy’s wrists were secured to the wall above his head. Another wave, and Malfoy’s clothes vanished.
“But I was hoping you’d want to fuck me,” he said quickly, a desperate edge to his voice. “I was hoping you’d let me come with you inside me.”
Malfoy’s eyes sparkled. “Well, if you ever need to defend yourself against a mental invasion from a Muggle, you can rest assured that you’ll do well. It was very good for a first attempt, either way. Take a moment to choose another memory, strengthen the door, and we’ll try again.”
And Malfoy shivers – imperceptible to most, but not to Harry. And Malfoy tilts his head and deepens the kiss. And Malfoy – stupid, suicidal Malfoy – deliberately slides his tongue into Harry’s mouth and flicks it against the sharp point of Harry’s fang.
He’s bent over the worktable, worn wood smooth against his fingers. The single candle flickers under his laboured breaths, sending shadows dancing.
And I’m not the only one mooning over her now, by the looks of things. Not that I’m mooning, mind you—we broke up for a good reason, and she always deserved better than me anyway—but I’m not going to deny that I’m watching as her faded jeans stretch over her arse when she leans over the bar to point out the specific bottle of wine she wants.
“Even the Hog’s Head has a better selection than this place,” Malfoy sniffs. His tray of drinks floats neatly onto the table. “And I have a mind to put in a formal complaint about that useless lump behind the bar. Do you know, she didn’t even know what a Romanée Conti
After a solid three days of arguing (Harry holding his breath and Summoning household items every hour in case the contract decided they’d gone too far), they’d agreed to buy the vacant flat above Ceridwen’s Cauldrons in Hogsmeade.
Malfoy did look at him, then—his eyebrow quirking when he saw Harry already facing him. He held out his left hand. Harry (surprised to find his own hand empty, the stone bowl having vanished without him noticing) grasped it with his own. He was gratified to find that, despite his unruffled appearance, Malfoy’s palm was sweaty.
“Draco’s good at blowjobs, too,” Harry says unnecessarily, grinning up at me. His mouth is puffy and my hand is still in his hair. I feel like I’m dreaming. If I am, I never want to wake up.
Harry frowns—it was a genuine question—but finally manages to free his cock and his retort is swallowed by a hiss of relief. Before he can even give himself a proper stroke, Draco leans forward—a hand on Harry’s chest for balance—and presses his dick against Harry’s.
Excitement wasn’t an emotion Harry felt much of these days, and he held it gently to himself as he polished off Ron’s dessert. Whoever Draco Malfoy was, whatever he’d done, he’d already given Harry one of the most interesting days he’d had in months.
“I did not!” Ron said hotly, brandishing his scone like a sword. “I said that someone would have to be a genius to pass the exam. I didn’t mention Malfoy at all.”
Again, the sound of my name works on me like a spell. I open my mouth and swallow him down, optimistically attempting some fancy things with my tongue—quickly faltering when Draco finds his rhythm.
Kreacher nodded. “Kreacher lives to serve the House of Black and its inheritors,” Kreacher said, again adding in an undertone, “Even if Kreacher doesn’t agree with the choice of inheritor that his previous Master made when there are blood descendents of the House of Black who Kreacher would have been glad to serve.”
It was unbelievably good. If Harry’s brain were capable of thought, he’d struggle to find the right words to describe just how good it felt, fucking up into Malfoy, who had his hands splayed on Harry’s chest and who let out a noise of approval with every thrust. But Harry’s brain had entirely disengaged. He was operating on pure pleasure, his body completely in control, his only goal to get
“I received an interesting letter this morning,” Harry said conversationally, not loosening his grip. “It was from a person who has never been employed by the Ministry in any capacity, and yet he was using top-level Auror-regulated spellwork.”
The pounding in his head was back: a painful throbbing almost audible in its intensity. Harry vanished the parchment before Kreacher could see it and slumped back in his chair. This was useless. The Post Office would be closed in ten minutes, and still Harry had nothing.
Harry swore and knocked over his third cup of tea in his haste to get up. Merlin knew what the goons in MLE had done with his suspects in his absence. He’d assumed they’d be locked up for a few hours and he’d be able to question them while they were still shocked from the arrest. Now they’d had more than a day to think of alibis and excuses.
“Absolutely I can,” Malfoy said loftily. “Especially when you didn’t tell me before now that you abandoned your support network at a key stage in your recovery.”
“You probably don’t remember me,” she said. Harry wanted to laugh. “We met last year. In Hogsmeade? I was the one who was, er … Well, I was hiding round the back of the Hog’s Head. Crying.”
“Very good,” Malfoy murmured. Harry shivered again. Malfoy drew his wand and pointed it at the door. “
For a panicked moment, Harry thought he would fall over without Draco’s hand holding him upright. But then the chill of Draco’s magic flared in his chest, settling him. Harry shook his head, unnerved.
She smiled. “They really are, you know. It’s crazy how much can change in such a short space of time.”
“What team would you prefer, so I know for next time?” The pleasure of even saying the words “next time” made Harry’s breath catch. He hoped Draco would attribute it to the roll of their hips, the friction that sent sparks shooting over his skin. “I could get some vintage Wimbourne Wasp ones. You could have Ludo Bagman grinning up at you, if you’d rather.”
Malfoy studied him for a long moment, his eyes narrowed. Then, abruptly, he said, “What is the name of the ghost of Gryffindor Tower?”
“Yeah,” Harry says. “It’s really good, actually. I didn’t expect it to go anywhere, to be honest with you—”
Actually, he did feel a bit guilty about how little he had contributed to the proceedings. On the rare occasions that Malfoy had insisted Harry needed to be involved, he’d allowed himself to be dragged to meetings and consultations and fittings, but the rest of the time, he’d moped at home while Malfoy flitted in and out of the house, a quill behind his ear and a smudge of ink on his cheek, rolls of parchment stuffed under his arm and ash on his shoulders from endless Floo calls.
“Stay?” Malfoy asked quietly into his mouth a while later. It was the second time Malfoy had asked him that, and it tempted Harry just as much as the first. But it felt worse, somehow – which was stupid, he knew; there was hardly anything worse than what he’d done already. But he couldn’t quite bring himself to get in bed with Malfoy. He couldn’t let any of this happen again.
It’s five minutes before Draco shows up in Harry’s room. In that time, Harry has hit himself with every cleaning charm he can think of, shoved all his dirty clothes into his wardrobe, lit a few candles, straightened his bedsheets as best he can, and taken his shirt off—and immediately felt awkward and put it back on again. Nervousness has wilted his erection; though there’s still a definite bit of interest, he’s nowhere near the aching hardness he was when he woke up with Draco’s head on his shoulder, Draco’s body curled into his. He briefly considers wanking himself off a bit to perk himself up again, but the thought of Draco walking in on him with his cock in his hand is far too embarrassing. What if Harry misunderstood? What if Draco is coming over for a late-night game of Exploding Snap?
“That’s not what I’m doing.” Harry concentrated on the image of Malfoy on the bed under him, his head thrown back and his long fingers wrapped around his pink, straining cock. He pulled it from his mind and let it float into the basin.
Draco tutted. “Don’t pretend you’re not filthy rich, Potter. It’s unbecoming.” He smoothed Harry’s collar again, his fingers lingering at the clasp at the base of Harry’s throat. Harry resisted the urge to swallow. “A new set of robes wouldn’t hurt, though.”
Malfoy’s dick was no less appealing now it was unclothed. Harry gave it a few experimental strokes, amazed at how hard Malfoy was already, at the velvety feel of his skin. Malfoy was propped up on his elbows, looking down at him – his ribs were more prominent than they should have been. Harry’s eyes traced the silvery scars zigzagging Malfoy’s torso, and he raised an eyebrow when he felt Malfoy’s dick twitch in response.
Malfoy whines – he’s so eager, so pliant – and Harry is consumed by him. He’s desperate to sink his teeth into Malfoy, but sinks his cock in instead, pulling out and fucking forwards, hard. Malfoy lets out a cry – the kiss breaks and Malfoy’s head falls back onto Harry’s shoulder – his hand rises to grip the back of Harry’s neck. It’s good – it presses them together, stretches Malfoy out so Harry can run his hand down Malfoy’s chest. The scars he’s given Malfoy are raised bumps under his fingers. The zigzag of
“But the common room is on the other side of the castle!” God knows how many people will interrupt him on the way there and back.
“Oh.” Harry, Ron and Hermione had talked about Malfoy at length over curry yesterday. Ron had shared his worries about Malfoy being in charge of Harry’s wellbeing. When he wasn’t being angry or insulting, Harry found his concerns much more reasonable, and had felt another throb of guilt at how dismissive he’d been. In turn, Harry had told Ron of his positive experiences with Malfoy (not
Harry’s gaze drags from Draco’s kiss-swollen lips to his nipple, inches from my mouth and wet with my spit, to me.
My own pleasure at this new development has been tangled with confusion, concern and disbelief, but as Draco’s thrusts gain speed, I can’t help but groan and grab his hips again in a desperate attempt to ground myself. It doesn’t work—in the past, when I’ve been lucky enough to have someone ride me, I’ve had wide hips and soft flesh to dig my fingers into. Draco’s thin waist and prominent hipbones are a marked difference—not at all a useful distraction. I press my hands inwards, marvelling at how delicate he feels.
The thought prompted another. “Hang on,” Harry said. “If we were in the same year at school, you couldn’t have been more than eighteen when you took the Mark, right?”
“Do you honestly think I would be better off with some idiot who would waste the month I have left by going on and on about what a shame it is I can’t remember the glory of my victory against the forces of evil?”
“Both, maybe,” Malfoy said. “I want to test a theory. You’re such a physical person, I think that might be what we’ve been missing.”
“Bizarre,” Malfoy muttered. “Look, go with her, get everything set up. She knows what she’s doing, despite – you know.”
His face was soft and half in shadow. He looked nothing like the fierce Auror Draco had admired from a distance. Nothing like the brat he’d known at school. He wasn’t
Draco remembered sitting across from him in an uncomfortable booth at the Leaky Cauldron. He remembered Harry inviting him inside his mind, showing him how their sessions together had reawakened his desires, had fed his fantasies.
Draco finally wins his battle with the buttons. He yanks Potter’s trousers down and immediately buries his nose in Potter’s crotch. He inhales deeply and lets Potter’s scent surround him, fill him. Potter’s dick presses against Draco’s face – fuck,
he?” Malfoy purrs, looking at me through his lashes. I’m hit again with the unwelcome thought of how good he’d look, wrecked and begging.
The smell of damp earth and Earl Grey. Gravel crunching underfoot. The heat of the early summer sun cooled by the balm of Malfoy’s mental presence. Ron, Hermione and Harry stood, chatting idly, surrounded by fresh green leaves.
Draco digs his fingers into Potter’s arse and licks another long stripe over his hole. Potter makes that high noise of surprise again. Draco snarls, spreads him wider, exposing him. When he was sucking Potter’s cock, he wanted to reward Potter for letting him have this. Now, he wants to punish him.
Whenever Harry touches Draco, even just brushes by him, the magic within him flares to life, recognising its old owner. And it’s fine. Really. Except—
Walburga Black’s shrieking, spitting portrait flashed to the forefront of Harry’s mind. He would have preferred it if that memory had stayed lost.
Malfoy, impatient, licks his way over my jaw and scrapes his teeth over my earlobe. My grip on his hair might be the only thing keeping me upright.
Draco tears himself away and quickly replaces his tongue with a finger, pushing it into the tight ring of muscle, barely loosened by Draco’s tongue. At some point, Potter has collapsed onto his arms, his face half-obscured by the bedsheets, but what little of it Draco can see is bright red – his eyes scrunched up, praise and profanity falling from his open mouth between ragged, whining breaths.
“Pretty words, Malfoy,” Harry said, his voice even despite his own painfully aroused state. He wrapped his hands around Malfoy’s prick and tugged roughly. Malfoy swore. “I don’t believe a thing you’re saying.”
Potter’s hips jerk and he hisses a stream of curses, his nails scraping against Draco’s scalp. Draco moans around his mouthful, lapping at the salty bitterness that bursts forth. He wonders wildly whether the real Potter tastes the same. Fuck, he probably does – if the charm can replicate the nuances of Potter’s ridiculous personality, why couldn’t it replicate the taste of his pre-come? The thought is overwhelming, and Draco bobs his head and sucks hard, rewarding the fantasy of Potter for this gift.
Ever since Harry had learned about the War and his role in it, he’d been uncomfortably aware that he and his friends had fought and hid and mourned and killed before they had even finished school. Nobody else seemed to find that strange – not even Ron and Hermione. It felt almost silly to bring it up again.
“Yes,” Harry agrees mindlessly. He takes Malfoy’s arm and drags his tongue over the wounds, which knit together under his attention. The taste is another punch to the gut, and Harry licks Malfoy’s arm, savouring every drop, until the only traces of his indulgence are the two small, uneven marks of his teeth.
“Have you been waiting long?” Potter asked, when Draco failed to do anything but stand and stare, open-mouthed, like the idiot he was.
Harry smiled politely at Healer Brisley and sat in his usual chair in front of her cluttered desk. Hermione sat beside him and squeezed his shoulder. She did that a lot. Harry wondered whether it was a new thing.
“I can’t wait for this,” Malfoy was saying, flicking his head to clear sweaty strands of hair from his eyes. “Merlin, I can’t wait to have your cock inside me. Fuck. I can’t believe this is happening.”
It was hard to look at, but Harry couldn’t look away. He couldn’t decide what colour it was. Blue? Silver? Or was it, in fact, completely transparent? Whatever colour it was, it clung to his attention, drawing his gaze and capturing it. Even once the officiwizard had finished and the bowl was full, Harry couldn’t stop staring. Something about it called to mind spring mornings, the Hogwarts lake, the glint of a Snitch…
, the Underground worker had told him matter-of-factly—he had nodded, not understanding in the slightest, but it seemed to mean that instead of a relatively simple journey, he had to take a complex route involving four Underground trains, one mainline train, and a bus.
Malfoy frowned. Harry couldn’t tell whether he was annoyed or concerned. “I said, are you willing to give it a try?”
“No.” Harry slumped into the wingback chair. The golden gleam of sunlight on Malfoy’s hair hurt his eyes.
“You’re a brilliant Mind Healer, Draco. You know that already. But you’re also unbelievably kind and patient. I mean it—I literally didn’t believe it, when I first got my memory back, but it’s true. You’ve grown so much since the War. It’s incredible, how you’ve overcome everything that happened to you. You should be so proud of yourself.”
One of two drabbles I wrote for the July 2020 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge. I wrote two bc they were my very first drabbles and I had no idea what I was doing (though, arguably, I still don't haha) and wanted to be able to pick which one to send. I didn't end up loving either of them, but I submitted the other one (in the next chapter).
Harry watched dispassionately as Tom disappeared into the back room. A murmur of conversation ignited around them.
“On your knees, Malfoy,” Harry says again, and the melodious note dances through his words. A visible shiver runs down Malfoy’s spine. He gathers his hands and knees under himself and straightens his arms. His shoulder blades flex.
.” Harry grins. I make a noise of protest, but quickly swallow it when Harry continues, “Actually, the
I take a drink, relieved to be out of that uncomfortable patch of conversation. “So, it’s going okay then? With you and him?”
“I like having power over you,” Malfoy had admitted that very morning as his eyes had bored into Harry’s from the other side of the desk. But in Harry’s mind, the words were purred into Harry’s throat, Harry pinned to the office wall, his cock gripped in Malfoy’s long, sure fingers.
A charged silence settled around them again. Fuck, but Draco wanted so desperately to drag Potter over the table by the front of his infuriatingly well-fitted robes and snog the living daylights out of him. He was sure Potter would let him. The way he’d lunged across the table at him in the Leaky Cauldron. They way he’d growled
Exasperation flickered onto Malfoy’s face. It was the faintest flash of frustration, but Harry felt a flare of triumph. Malfoy wanted to waste Harry’s time by dragging him here and questioning him, did he? Well, two could play at that game.
Still stunned, Draco pulled out and cleaned up their mess with a fumbling wave of his wand, then hesitated. But then Harry’s hands were on him again, tugging him closer, sliding down his sides, squeezing his arse.
I shake my head. I’m helpless and stupid. Now the buzz is fading, now I’m clean, now we’ve done what I came here to do—I’m worried they’re about to kick me out. I’m worried they’re not, but I’ll be overstaying my welcome if I don’t leave of my own accord.
The edge of the countertop was digging into the soft flesh at the base of Draco’s palms. “Are you sure?” His voice sounded stupid—tight, trembling. “It might— It’s not uncommon to consider a repeated Legilimency connection an intimate experience. You could—” He made a small, bitten-off noise as Potter shifted closer. Potter’s hips pinned Draco against the counter.
touching my cock—a warm, slick hand strokes me confidently from root to tip. I choke on my mouthful and jerk my head backwards. It collides painfully with the headboard.
Harry stared. He didn’t untangle his fingers from Malfoy’s hair. Slowly, he lifted his hand, and Malfoy’s head went with it, his mouth sliding luxuriously up the length of Harry’s cock. When Malfoy’s lips were wrapped around just the tip, Harry paused. This would be the perfect time to stop. Harry took a deep breath. Malfoy’s taunting eyes met his. His tongue slid around the head of Harry’s cock.
But how best to get the message across? How did you say “keep the money, the sex was great, I don’t want to see you again” without making it sound dirtier and more transactional than it already was? Harry pondered the wording while he tugged on a pair of pyjama bottoms and followed his rumbling stomach to the kitchen. A cup of tea and two slices of toast later, and he had this:
“Well – yes. Theoretically. But you’d never be able to get your memories back. They would be gone forever.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s arse and yanked him closer. Draco’s cock dragged against the hot, urgent line of Harry’s, and it was impossible to think straight, entirely impossible, and then Harry breathed, “Will you fuck me? Will you put your sexy fucking fingers in my arse until I’m begging for it, then will you fuck me?”
After a pause, Draco said, “For the ribbon, you picked the colour of the robes I wore to the Pixie Powder Victory Ball. Do you remember the rest of the night?”
“What do you mean, I don’t mean it? Of course I do.” Draco frowned. “Surely you know. I flirt with you constantly. I asked you to dinner literally yesterday.”
He’s grimacing, his teeth bared. It seems, at the grand total of one cock and three fingers, we’ve finally reached the limit of how much can fit.
Draco dips his hand inside Potter’s robes—Potter hums encouragingly—and withdraws the bottle of Sobering Solution.
Even if Harry had asked before, Draco wouldn’t have told him. He didn’t want to tell him now, but Draco still wasn’t sure he should be here, ethically. Maybe reminding Potter exactly who Draco was would scare him away. It would probably be for the best, if it did.
Harry didn’t know he was supposed to think about sound. He considered it. “No,” he said after a while.
interested—inexplicably drawn to a small, dark, leather-bound book. The idea appeared fully-formed as soon as he touched the spine.
“Bill.” Harry had only met a couple of Ron’s brothers. He still hadn’t learned their names. “What did you … What happened to him?”
The world had turned upside-down. There was suddenly no other option. “Fine.” Harry stood. Fury seethed through him, fizzing under his skin with nowhere to go. Through a haze, Harry yanked out his wand and sent a hex spiralling towards the wingback chair. It shot backwards, the leather singed and smoking. It didn’t make Harry feel better. “Fine,” he repeated. “Then I’ll leave. Keep your stupid secrets, I don’t care. I should have known better than to work with a Death Eater, anyway.”
He was aware of Draco, who sat on him, tied up in Harry’s favourite colours, his hole still twitching around Harry’s cock.
“It did work,” Harry breathed, and Malfoy laughed. The sound was strange – it came from behind the image of Ron and Hermione, but it echoed inside Harry’s head. He remembered Malfoy’s bright, delighted laugh yesterday after the duel. The Leaky Cauldron warped and became Malfoy’s office again, but the office as it had been yesterday: the furniture cleared, Malfoy standing across from him, his hair ruffled. Harry felt his face grow hot.
Harry straightened slowly and looked around. Were these Malfoy’s memories? His thoughts? A flicker of candlelight on his left caught his attention; as he looked closer, he was yanked sideways into the memory.
Draco opens his eyes and locks his gaze on mine. “More,” he orders breathily, not looking away. “Give me more, Harry. Another finger, fill me up, stretch me wide—”
The evening dragged. Harry took himself to bed early for lack of anything better to do. Despite the inactivity of the day, he was wrung out. He had been so viciously angry then so wretchedly remorseful that he had no emotion left. Instead, his thoughts, only briefly distracted by dinner, drifted back to Malfoy.
“Mmm, I did do well, didn’t I?” Draco’s head moved against Harry’s fingers as he preened. Harry imagined tightening his grip.
Malfoy was right: there were ways out of this. It didn’t mean the end of everything. It didn’t mean being beholden to Lucius Malfoy for the rest of his life.
Potter makes a small, hungry noise and shifts underneath him. The friction ignites sparks of pleasure in Draco’s groin, a sharp reminder of his aching hardness, and Draco whimpers, shoving his hips forwards. His dick grinds against Potter’s, and for a moment Draco forgets that of
He stilled when his hips were pressed against Malfoy’s arse, his cock buried as deep as it could go. He took a minute to breathe, surveying Malfoy spread beneath him like a feast laid out for a king. Malfoy’s pleading faded, and for several long moments, they simply looked at each other, fulfilment and anticipation uniting them.
Potter makes an amused sound and comes to stand next to him. “Is this a Wheezes product?” He picks up the box and cocks his head. “A Daydream Charm? Huh. I’d be up for trying it. Does it work with two people?”
Another wave, and one of the bowls floated over to Malfoy; the other towards Harry. Harry plucked it out of the air instinctively.
Draco shrugged. He still wouldn’t meet Harry’s gaze. “Never felt like there was a point. Even after the Victory Ball, you wouldn’t respond when I flirted, or when I tried to spend time with you outside of work. But I couldn’t stop, because every now and then you’d look at me and I – I thought that if I did something drastic, at least you’d be angry enough to storm out and request a new partner. I didn’t think–”
Harry sat up straighter. Apart from the Thestral revelation in his first session, most of Harry’s memories were still as absent as they had been two months ago. Given the accolades that Malfoy had (Hermione had shown him pages and pages of Malfoy’s Mind Magic achievements while Ron sputtered protests in the background), Harry had expected to have made a bit more progress by now.
Harry beamed, unable to help it. Draco made a show of rolling his eyes, but Harry knew his face so, so well – the tiny upward tick of the corner of his mouth betrayed him. Harry grabbed Draco’s jaw and dotted kisses over the pointed little quirk until the hidden hint of a smile crept over Draco’s whole mouth – then he was laughing, and Harry felt like he was flying.
Draco lowered himself further and found himself face-to-face with Harry’s cock. The room spun from the sheer unreality of it all—he’d fantasised about this for
With great effort, I drop my hand. I try to calm my ragged breathing, but Malfoy seems to take destroying my self-control as a personal challenge and redoubles his efforts. He swallows my cock all the way down, over and over. A long, low groan tears itself from my throat, and my thighs ache from the strain of holding still. My head falls back against the fancy wallpaper with a muffled
The murmur of voices quietened immediately. Harry let his eyes rake over the congregation, unable to take in any individual faces, coming away with nothing more than an impression of a collective held breath, a large blur of red hair to his right, and some strange shapes emerging above the crowd—which he assumed was a selection of truly astonishing hats.
“How do you expect me to trust you when you won’t let me see for myself what happened?” Harry demanded.
The world’s most beautiful cock jumped in Harry’s hand. Harry licked a slow stripe from the blue-and-charcoal bow at the base to the tip, where he sucked briefly then pulled back.
“I meant, specifically, that I want…” It was much harder to say than he’d thought it would be. Malfoy definitely already knew, Harry reminded himself. Malfoy already knew, and he was already looking at Harry like that. He had already been looking at him like that – albeit hastily hidden every time – for weeks. “I want…”
Harry wished he could close his eyes. It was hard to concentrate on guiding the flow of your thoughts when you were in a staring contest, especially when your opponent’s gaze was so gripping. He tried to focus his attention inward, on that citrusy scent that was fast becoming familiar. A cool ripple of approval ran through him.
Harry shook his head. “Nah, I better not,” he said. “Don’t wanna drink too much today. I have my first session with Malfoy at ten tomorrow.”
Harry doubted it; all he could think about was how much Malfoy looked like he’d just been fucked and how desperately Harry wanted to have been the one who had done it. “I think so.”
“Quite.” There was a strange note in Malfoy’s voice, but Harry was still mentally poking at the presence in his head, baffled that he hadn’t felt it the first time. Then, suddenly, it vanished.
Everything about him settles. He stands straighter. His eyes focus. His grin becomes a sheepish smile.
Harry focused. The room around them shifted until they were standing in front of the one locked door. Malfoy’s approval rippled through him, sending a cool tingling through Harry’s mind and down his spine.
“We fell asleep on the sofa,” Harry says, his voice hoarse. That’s definitely Draco’s cock pressing into Harry’s thigh. That’s definitely a big, hard, insistent—
Malfoy shook his head. “Not at all. I’m glad to hear it.” He sat too. His long fingers flexed. “What – er. What can I do for you?”
Hermione glanced at him and tutted. She waved her wand vaguely in his direction and the mud disappeared. “Tea?”
“If this works,” Harry said, “don’t let me be an arse.” He allowed the depth of his feelings to roll through them in waves.
“We’re making a day of it,” Harry said, smiling tightly. “Listen—could you tell me how to get to Hampton Court?”
Ginny had been more disappointed than angry. There was always a case, she’d said. And Harry always had to be the one to do it, even though there was a whole Auror department. Harry had told her that she didn’t understand, he couldn’t go into detail, but this one – this one really was important.
Harry presses his thumbs into the soft flesh of Malfoy’s inner thighs, watches in fascination as the blood is forced away by the pressure, as it rushes back when he withdraws.
There’s no way I can match Harry’s pace—I’m so close to the edge as it is, fuck, this feels so good—but I meet his every second thrust, driving myself deep with a series of low, strangled groans.
was stronger than any stupid icy tug at his heart. He distracted himself by tentatively summoning a glass of champagne—and nearly stumbled in joy and relief when the glass sailed into his hand without hesitation. He drank the whole thing in one gulp. Summoned another, just because he could. Drank that too.
Draco whines. Merlin, it’s all he can do not to shove his cock back in Potter’s mouth and fuck his throat to completion. It wouldn’t take long. But then what would they do for the next fifteen minutes? Cuddle?
Harry laughed. “No, that’s not – you dick. I’m not asking if you’ll be my Healer. That’s the last thing I want.”
Malfoy’s pulse thuds, and an echo of it thrums through Harry, as if the blood Harry has already taken is answering the call of Malfoy’s heartbeat. Harry buries his nose in Malfoy’s neck. He smells so
“You can do whatever you want to me,” Malfoy said, his voice low, his gaze intense. “Anything at all. I want you to. I’ve wanted–”
Harry’s teeth sink into Malfoy’s flesh like a knife through butter, and he’s lost again, the luxury of Malfoy’s blood filling his mouth, dribbling down his chin. It’s so hot – it flows down his throat, burning through him – and he groans and digs his teeth deeper, sucks harder, drowns further. Malfoy’s pulse quickens, and he’s making low noises that vibrate against Harry’s skin. Harry can’t tell whether they’re noises of pain or pleasure. He doesn’t care either way. He just wants
Another pause. I can feel Malfoy’s gaze on me. The hair on the back of my neck stands up the way it does when I’ve figured something out—a chess move, the perfect item for a customer, the reason why someone is acting a bit weird—but my neck doesn’t pass the message of whatever I’ve figured out onto my head, because I’m still completely lost.
Harry shook the soot from his hair. The flames behind him flickered from green to gold, casting warm, merry light over the empty parlour.
Malfoy pushes his hips up, drawing Harry’s attention to his erect cock. It is thick with blood, throbbing with it. The heady scent of it weaves with the sharp tang of Malfoy’s arousal. Harry bends forwards unthinkingly. Malfoy raises his hips again, angles his dick towards Harry’s mouth. With great difficulty, Harry pulls away.
. It was hours before Harry could calm down enough to think straight. He was beginning to wonder whether there wasn’t something wrong with him, aside from the obvious. Surely this unquenchable libido wasn’t normal in a twenty-seven-year-old. He was so, so thankful for Anti-Chafing Charms.
“At the pub, Draco asked if I wanted to fuck him,” I say. It’s the only thing I feel reasonably sure about.
“Well, my family emerged relatively unscathed, as you’re aware. Lucius notwithstanding.” Draco twisted the thick Malfoy ring around his thumb and tried not to think about the day he’d been given it—the last day his father had been the Lord of Malfoy Manor. “But we found ourselves in the unusual position of eventually needing a source of income.”
A blink, and Malfoy was bent over the desk, his pale hands splayed over the dark wood, and Harry was fucking him. A blink, and Malfoy was hoisted up against the office door, his legs wrapped around Harry’s waist, and Harry was fucking him. A blink, and Malfoy was pressed against the window, the meandering Muggles of Oxford Street down below, and Harry was fucking him, and fucking him, and fucking him.
Even through the slow haze of want, Draco couldn’t help but smile. “Potter, you told me you wanted me by showing me fantasies of us fucking each other. I think we’re a fair bit past presumptuous.”
He was so angry that he didn’t hold himself properly as he swirled through the flames, and every knock of his elbows on strangers’ fireplaces only served to rile him up further. By the time he stepped out at the Leaky Cauldron, he was seeing red. This was only exacerbated by Malfoy – half-dressed, bent over the desk in the corner of the room – having the nerve to look over at him and smile.
But Draco had kept tripping up—whenever Harry caught him unawares, whenever he did something so incredibly
“When questioned,” Harry continued, “he admitted to having taken advantage of a member – possibly several members – of the Auror department in order to learn the information.”
“Please,” I whimper, but I forgot how much Malfoy likes that; he breaks the kiss to take me in his mouth again, and I moan, unable to stop pushing my hips forwards. He takes it so well, squeezing my arse encouragingly and closing his eyes in apparent enjoyment as I fuck his throat—tentatively at first, but when neither of them complain, quicker. Harder. More uncontrolled. Oh, fuck.
He makes a wounded noise and bites down on his lip, the thing inside him threatening to burst forth.
“Whatever you want to,” Draco said lowly. “If that’s Flooing home and requesting another partner and never speaking of this again…” He shrugged one shoulder – with some difficulty, because he was tied up. And naked. He was tied up and naked. “But if not … you can do whatever you want with me. To me. I want you to.”
“I mean,” Potter says hoarsely, “I’m actually in favour of you touching me whenever you finally get round to –
“I don’t know about you,” Malfoy began shakily, “but this – you and me. It’s been…it’s been amazing. I never thought… I wasn’t lying when I said I’ve wanted this – wanted you – for years. I would never have thrown it away, not even before I had it. Especially not for my father.”
The moment stretches, an endless high. Until Malfoy sags, and Harry dimly realises that Malfoy is quieter, that his skin has become cooler, clammier.
I’m stuck between incredulity and being turned on beyond belief. I need to distract myself from Draco’s filthy mouth and the sinful grip of his arse or I’m going to lose it.
“Hm. Seems like there’s a little more to it than that.” Harry tilted his head, watching them both carefully. “Were you two a couple?”
“Is that what he said?” Malfoy glanced down at Harry’s wand. “Did he also happen to mention, last time you saw him, how much he likes you pointing your wand at him?”
“He must be good, if a simple question makes you react like that,” I say, still grinning. There’s a tug in my stomach that makes my smile feel oddly forced. It’s probably the beer. Maybe Malfoy has a point about the quality of booze in this place.
Draco made a noise somewhere between pleasure and impatience. “Of course I love you, you stupid fuck. Of
Harry certainly tried. After Wednesday’s session, he strode determinedly northwards from St Mungo’s, dodging through Muggle tourists in Camden Market and climbing to the top of Primrose Hill, an hour’s walk from the Leaky Cauldron. He sat on the grass, the smells of Muggle summer picnics – tins of Pimm’s, M&S sandwiches and messily-rolled joints – drifting from the laughing people scattered around him. He ignored them and gazed over London, his eyes trying to pick out the grey-brick roof of the hospital, the familiar landmarks that surrounded the pub. He stayed there until the rumble of rush hour traffic built, then died. By the time a distant church bell rang eight o’clock, Harry was sure he’d managed to stay away. He was proud of himself.
The pounding noise had stopped dead the instant the door had opened, but it had been replaced by a cacophony of voices – familiar, unfamiliar, attached to names he didn’t know how he knew. Each was accompanied by a surge of emotion – anger, joy, frustration, pleasure, grief. Harry felt himself tremble. He held tight to Malfoy’s hand. Malfoy’s grip was blessedly solid.
“What about you?” My voice comes out gravelly. His face is so close to mine. “Do you like taking control?”
“You don’t.” Harry grins, and pecks Malfoy’s disgusted moue. He stretches out on the bed. “So, d’you reckon five hours and twenty-three minutes is quick enough to prove to Robards that I’m useful even without a wand?”
Malfoy made a strange noise and immediately looked embarrassed. “Well … I shan’t turn you away,” he said. The flush had climbed up to his cheekbones. “So, if – if you insist…”
But a second later, Draco fills the space Harry left behind, leaning over me and grabbing my chin, pulling me into a wet, hungry kiss.
Harry gasped as the green of the pitch warped, colours twisting and twining and eventually forming the dark shapes of bookshelves. Lots of bookshelves, rows and rows of them. The back of Malfoy’s pale head moved purposefully through them.
It continued for a week, then two. Harry sent apologetic owls to Ron and Hermione, and they tentatively reconciled. Harry saw them every few days, sharing the occasional cuppa in their cottage, but he never stayed for long. He was still unsure whether he resented them for keeping things from him – and he still thought that Ron had been unreasonable, even if he had been telling the truth. Ron had waved away Harry’s apology, but thereafter firmly avoided any mention of Malfoy, loudly changing the subject if Hermione brought it up. As the Legilimency sessions were about the only thing Harry did, this meant there wasn’t much for them to talk about, anyway.
God, the way Malfoy was looking at him. Harry had always felt pinned by his gaze, right from the beginning, but this was something else entirely. How could something that was usually cool and piercing send such scorching flames licking over him? Harry could barely breathe.
Malfoy shot him a look. “In that case, I believe we’re done for the day. If you wish to proceed, I’ll see you at the same time tomorrow.” He gazed at Harry for a long moment, then turned away and began to look through his desk drawer. “Close the door on your way out, would you?” he said vaguely. Harry was dismissed.
Harry laughed. It came out strained. “Longer than ten seconds,” he assured Malfoy. “I’ve barely thought about anything else all afternoon.”
Because the differences between the man in front of him and Draco’s former patient were unnerving, yes—but even more unnerving were the similarities. Potter’s gaze was still as soft as ever when he looked at Draco. His humour was as dry and quick as it had been before, and, when Draco couldn’t help but casually shift his leg so it pressed against Potter’s under the table, the way he faltered and flushed still made guilt-tinged desire pool hot in Draco’s belly.
Without letting himself think about it, Harry reached out and ran Draco’s favourite moss-green scarf through his fingers. It was so soft, some kind of fancy posh material that felt like it had been charmed to kiss your skin rather than keep it warm. Maybe it had. With a quick look over his shoulder, Harry lifted the end of the scarf to his face, rubbing it against his cheek and inhaling deeply, his eyes falling closed.
From the mention of books, Hermione and Malfoy had deviated into the merits and failings of various wizarding libraries. Malfoy – a spark in his eyes that kept stealing Harry’s attention away from Ron – was extolling the virtues of a place called the Clementinum (Hermione considered it ostentatious and preferred the wizarding division of Chetham’s) when Ron slammed his tankard onto the table. Mead sloshed over their empty plates. Harry noticed a few faces flicker in their direction.
He finished his tenth course from the window to the door and turned – and was shocked to find Malfoy standing in front of him, eyes puffy.
When he finally slept, his dreams were disjointed, linked only by a muffled pounding noise – the sound of running feet, a fist on a pub table, someone
The groan I’ve been suppressing bursts out of me, long and loud. Harry’s cock is so slick and hot, sliding against mine, sharing the tight grip of Draco’s hole. Fuck.
“Shh,” he says, still moving slowly, torturously. “That was so good. You feel amazing, I didn’t want to stop. But I want to try…”
“You’re such a brat,” Malfoy said. “Try to keep the noise in the forefront of your mind. I’m going to end the spell now, okay?”
“On your knees, Potter.” His voice is hoarse and lacks the authority he was aiming for, but Potter kneels immediately. He unfastens Draco’s trousers much more efficiently than Draco did his, and Draco hisses when his cock springs free from its confines – he’s painfully, painfully hard. But when Potter reaches for him, Draco finds the strength to bat his hands away. He’s had this particular fantasy for longer than he cares to admit. He’s going to do it right.
The scent that had been so out of place in the Leaky Cauldron, that had floated over the stands in the Quidditch pitch, that had twined with the mustiness of books in the library – that was here too. Like the breeze, it wasn’t quite
, but having my eyes closed almost makes it worse—I no longer know whose hands are where, whose hair is brushing my stomach, whose breath is playing over my skin. And then Harry trails kisses from my hipbone down to the top of my thigh, and Malfoy pulls off, and then there are two hot mouths running up and down my cock.
. And Harry Potter was crawling over him, his sinful robes dragging over Draco. Even through the layers of fabric that separated them, Draco was hyperaware of every brush of cloth, every slide of limb against limb.
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy said, cutting him off, his voice shaky. “I really shouldn’t have … I’m going to go.” He turned and began to walk stiffly away before Harry could say anything, before Harry could tell him how desperately he wanted everything that Malfoy had just shown him.
Since then, they’ve sniped at one another with more and more ease. Improbably, this helps them get along much better, and they’ve settled into married life remarkably easily.
Harry’s mind became more disjointed with every thrust of Draco’s cock inside him. Thoughts and images tumbled through Draco—all of them overlaid with a heavy haze of pleasure that dragged at him with smoky, clinging tendrils, so tangible they might have been winding over his skin. And all the while, Draco was fucking Harry jerkily, desperate to be inside him, to chase the hot build-up of pleasure that simmered at the base of his spine.
All the while, Harry didn’t – couldn’t – stop fucking him, the slap of flesh against flesh drowned out by the pounding of his heart. Malfoy whimpered and jerked against him and Harry let go of Malfoy’s cock, digging sticky fingers into Malfoy’s side to drag him as close as possible while he chased his release.
Malfoy’s pupils visibly dilated at the praise. Pleasure tingled through to the end of Harry’s fingertips.
“Don’t be,” Malfoy said. “The more you worry about it, the less control you will have. Did you notice how much harder it was to direct your thoughts once you became emotional?”
If this wedding thing worked, he told himself, he would be teaching again by next half term. The return of his magic was almost secondary to the idea of being back at Hogwarts, in those hallways, in his classroom. Home.
out of habit) and Harry fell forwards into a large, white, high-ceilinged room. The walls were lined with rows of white wooden doors – dozens of them. The suggestion of Earl Grey hung heavy in the air.
By the time the song came to an end, Harry was dizzy, and his hand was somehow buried in Draco’s hair, soft strands wound between his fingers.
Harry schooled his features into something he hoped resembled grateful delight. “Oh—yes! It’s wonderful! It must have taken ages. How did you know about the ferret?” He glanced at Draco.
Harry squints at the damp-spotted page. The thick gurgle of the pitch-back potion is loud in the heavy silence of night. He’s finally following the last instruction:
Harry raked a hand through his hair. “I don’t understand,” he said, his voice strained. “Do you want this, or don’t you?”
“It’s not something I’ve ever had a choice in,” Malfoy said quietly. “But right now is … It’s not the time.”
“No!” Harry yelped. The fantasy of pulling Malfoy across the table into a deep kiss replayed in his mind. Ron and Hermione raised their eyebrows. Harry cleared his throat, his face heating. “I mean, er – nah,” he said with forced casualness. “I don’t really fancy pub food. How about Indian?”
Draco forced himself to relax the death grip he had on Harry’s arm. “It would have been, with a bit of warning.”
He’d done it in front of Ron once – Draco had demanded Harry fetch him a scroll of parchment while Ron was leaning against Harry’s desk, listening to Harry complain about Ginny’s latest Quidditch match. Harry had stood, crossed the room, rifled through Draco’s bag and handed over the scroll without pausing in his assessment of Valmai Morgan’s fumble of a simple Reverse Pass. Ron had stared, mouth open. Harry had stopped, confused, until Draco had said, “Thanks ever so, Potter,” with a wickedly sweet smile. Ron had grilled him about it for weeks.
Until he turned seventeen, Harry’s birthdays were a day like any other – a day spent alone in his room, ignored by the Dursleys. More than once, Harry had forgotten his birthday altogether, only to have the disconcerting realisation at some point in early August that he’d aged another year without noticing.
“Dunno,” Harry said. “But he kept checking his wristwatch. It had a little flashy, frilly flag on it. Red, with a white cross.”
A flick, and the bindings vanished. Harry caught Malfoy’s arms before they could fall, gently lowering them while Malfoy hissed as sensation returned. Once they were all the way down, Harry healed Malfoy’s wrists.
Harry shrugged awkwardly and stepped aside to let Malfoy in. “It’s fine,” he said, closing the door behind them. “Fireplace is this way.”
?” Harry repeated, nonplussed. Draco snickered. Harry couldn’t identify why the sound was strange, for a second—and then he realised: Harry had never made Draco laugh before. He was so used to Draco’s snicker being malevolent, accompanied by eyes alight with malice and a cutting remark. He much preferred the soft sound of uncomplicated amusement. He wanted to hear it again.
Harry breathed once, twice. He opened his eyes. He only had a glimpse of Malfoy’s steady gaze before Malfoy said, “
Another deep breath. They were back in the bedroom, an owl at the window, a scroll tied neatly to its leg. His hand reached for the owl treats. More owls, beaks tapping on glass, letters gripped by sharp talons.
Malfoy shook his head. “Please,” he repeated, voice thick, eyes wet. “You don’t know what he’s like now. He’ll kill me. He’ll really kill me.
Harry’s grin faded, memories of shoddy Summoning Spells and shattered Shield Charms taking on a new, unpleasant meaning.
God, he missed the castle so much it burned. If marrying Malfoy was what it took to be able to go back, was that really so bad? They’d already lived together for weeks—apparently—and Harry had barely seen him. Was waking up to the sound of the shower really such a big price to pay?
“Don’t go.” Harry didn’t know whether he’d said it out loud or in his head. He clung to the feeling of Malfoy as the maelstrom of colour and sound dragged him under. “Please. Please don’t go.”
taking him apart. He’s still talking, filth and appreciation pouring from him in between cries of pleasure. I dimly register the fact that the bed isn’t squeaking—isn’t even rocking—despite the rough pounding of my hips. Probably made from some fancy foreign wood, soaked in Strengthening Solution and laced with Silencing Charms. Posh wanker.
hadn’t he worn his bespoke Maison Capenoir robes? He hadn’t wanted to look like he was trying too hard, but the navy Twilfitt & Tattings ensemble he’d decided on in the end was excruciatingly plain in comparison to Potter’s mouthwatering get-up. Thank Merlin Potter’s hair was still an absolute state, otherwise Draco would have had to Apparate home after all out sheer shame. He forced a thin smile. “Shall we?”
Malfoy continues to look smug. Then something occurs to him. He straightens. ”Wait—Harry. After what kiss?”
“Tea would be great, thank you.” Harry followed her into the kitchen, his eyes lingering as they always did on the photographs that lined the mantelpiece.
Harry tore his mouth away, breathing raggedly. Draco’s eyes were wide, his cheeks pink. Harry wanted to kiss him again. He would have done if Draco hadn’t tightened his grip on Harry’s hand, hadn’t shaken his head minutely. The refusal made Harry blink. The rest of the world came into abrupt focus.
“Oh, I didn’t expect you for another hour.” He straightened and walked towards Harry, who was rooted to the spot, shaking in fury, the letter still clutched in his hand. Malfoy hesitated, halting five feet away from him. “Hey… What’s wrong?”
“I’d already been in love with you for years. Since eighth year, in fact. The Potions project where you fucked up at every step but you were so earnest about it, remember? When you nearly blew us up by adding fairy wings to Dreamless Sleep because you were busy telling me I shouldn’t blame myself for what happened to Crabbe. When you said you forgave me. Since then.”
But we’re not friends, me and him. The only time I see him is when he tags along with Harry to group pub nights. He’s not mine to know. Neither of them are.
He didn’t doubt that Malfoy had been a Death Eater – he’d seen the Mark with his own eyes, after all – but he did find it hard to imagine. The books he’d read about Voldemort and the Death Eaters painted them as black-cloaked thugs, shooting curses and torturing Muggles and blowing things up. He couldn’t imagine polished, professional Mind Healer Malfoy ever being so crass.
Harry thanked him awkwardly. Kreacher smirked and snapped his fingers. Three huge piles of letters appeared next to him, all of which reached from the floor to the ceiling. Harry stared, horrified. He vaguely remembered owls arriving from people he didn’t know, carrying letters he didn’t understand. He hadn’t known what to do with them, so he’d tossed them aside. He hadn’t realised Kreacher had been salvaging them.
Harry still didn’t see the point if they didn’t know whether he’d been cursed or poisoned or just knocked really hard on the head. But since Harry couldn’t actually help the Aurors investigate the case (he’d asked), he supposed he might as well carry on doing what Malfoy told him, even if it did feel useless.
“Yes,” Luna said simply. “But I think he would prefer it if you didn’t drip everywhere. He put a lot of effort into the decorations.”
But Harry found it difficult to worry about anything just then. Malfoy had a hand in his hair and was stroking slowly. The mustiness underneath the smell of sex reminded Harry of disused classrooms and the upper floors at the Burrow. It was so easy to let his eyes drift closed…just for a second…
Anyway, that was why he was there, wasn’t it? Tea. That’s what Potter had said. Just a drink. Half an hour, in and out. No reason to get his hopes up.
Draco was already struggling, but at that, some distant, aloof part of him is surprised his brain doesn’t seize up altogether, knocking Draco unconscious out of sheer confusion. The oblivion would be a blessing.
,” Harry hisses, and Malfoy gasps, mindlessly fucks Harry’s fist. High, desperate noises fall from his mouth –
“I don’t have any money,” Malfoy said, his voice high and tight. “I don’t have anything. I barely made it out of the manor. Father was angry, he–” Malfoy drew his arms around himself. “I didn’t get a chance to pack anything, and Gringotts won’t let me access the vault. I tried, but there’s nothing I can… I’m sorry.” He met Harry’s gaze and took in Harry’s unimpressed expression. He blinked rapidly, three times, and shook his head. “Sorry. I can – I can go.”
Harry is only vaguely aware when Malfoy’s low noises begin to form words, Harry’s name, chanted over and over – “Harry, Harry,
Hermione looks so horrified, Harry wonders whether he hadn’t misheard; Hermione’s reaction would be much more suited to an accusation like
But Draco wasn’t at the top of the Mind Magic field for nothing. Despite all current evidence to the contrary, his mental control really was extraordinary and, after several deep breaths, he raised his head and met Harry’s gaze. He managed the smirk this time.
“Master has an appointment in thirty minutes,” Kreacher croaked. “Kreacher has brought Master his morning tea.” He held up the teapot as proof.
He stayed away from Draco for the next hour, though he couldn’t seem to stop his gaze following him as he worked the room. He was in his element, smirking and tossing his hair, obviously enjoying the attention. Not that Harry was managing to stay out of the limelight, himself. People were lining up to talk to him—and since nobody except Harry, Ron, Hermione, Robards and Draco knew about the truth about the contract (most of the guests seemed to assume it was a romantic gimmick), Harry had to endure several crushingly awkward conversations about how well-suited Harry and Draco were. Pomona Sprout spent ten tearful minutes telling Harry she had seen the spark between them all along and was so glad they’d finally realised it themselves. Then she asked whether Draco would be joining Harry at the castle when Harry resumed teaching.
A brush of teasing amusement. “If you don’t need to use the safeword, I’m doing a good job. But I’m glad you remember what it is if you need it. Ready?”
Harry would wait as long as he needed to. After all, with any luck, tomorrow would be a day he would remember forever.
Harry faltered, and Draco grabbed onto the break in rhythm like a lifeline. He gathered the whirlpool of restless energy inside him and used it to lunge sideways, pushing Harry onto his back, pinning him to the bed and kissing him desperately, drinking in his every harsh breath, his every strained, bitten-off sound.
Draco tore his eyes away from the incredible sight of his finger disappearing inside Harry to find that Harry was looking at him imploringly, his neck straining to keep his head upright so he could watch Draco finger-fuck him.
“Hello, gorgeous.” Draco kisses him again. Harry’s hand slides over my skin, stopping an inch from my cock.
A distortion of colour, and Malfoy’s chair was empty, but Harry’s was not; Harry was sitting in it, as he sat every morning from ten o’clock. But Malfoy was on top of him, chest to chest with Harry, his robes half-undone, hanging off him. He was moving. He was – the real Harry whimpered – he was fucking himself on Harry’s cock. Imaginary Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hips and yanked him downwards. Malfoy gasped and started to wank himself off, riding Harry wildly, crying out with pleasure.
