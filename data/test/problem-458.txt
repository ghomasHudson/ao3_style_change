The next morning, Draco walked into the great hall with red, puffy bags under her eyes. Of course Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle and other slytherins were with her. Pansy and another one of the slytherins, Blaise Zabini, were obviously flirting, yet still Pansy hung onto Draco’s arm.
Crabbe and Goyle shook their heads, saying they hadn’t seen him since breakfast for Goyle and Potions for Crabbe. McGonagall nodded, “Well if he doesn’t have a good reason to miss class, I’m afraid I’ll have to take some house points from Slytherin.”
Tears pooled to her eyes and she took heaving breaths. Before she knew it those breaths became sobs. At first they were soft and partial, then they became harder and shaking. They then became all enveloping, deep seated sobs that made it hard to breath. Her entire body was shaking and her hands were at her head. She was grasping her hair, almost to the point of tearing it out.
Harry paused for a second thinking before answering, “It can’t be easy, being a part of his family. He must have a lot of pressure to be perfect, I’m sure his parents weren’t happy he didn’t become a member of the slug club.”
It was Hermione and Luna’s turn to look at each other. Luna was the one to speak, “You’re right, Harry. It is rather presumptuous, perhaps he is just having a particularly bad year. After all, Lucius Malfoy is in Azkaban. That can’t be easy.”
She ran past classrooms, up and down multiple staircases, through the great hall and finally out the castle doors. She ran the grounds towards the forbidden forest, when she saw the groundskeeper/care of magical creatures professor's hut, she turned and ran the opposite direction. She ran past the quidditch pitch.
Lyra leaned into her and started crying. Luna put a hand on her back. Lyra stuttered, “He recognized me, I know he did.”
"Oh, like Draco," Hermione said, "I guess I never connected that you were named after the constellation.”
Luna then walked out of the room. Harry noted that she wasn’t wearing her uniform but rather a jumper and jeans. Luna looked confused by Harry’s presence. She said, “Sorry Ginny. Right now isn’t a good time.”
Sorry for the wait! This chapter is quite a bit longer than normal but is more the length I'm aiming for. I don't know, would you prefer shorter chapters with less wait time or longer chapters with more time in between?
As she reached a corridor into the school, she resigned to just going to the dorm and hoping no one would ask her until tomorrow. As she entered, she heard the sound of dinner in the dining hall. She longed to go join them and eat, her stomach was growling at the smell of puff pastry and meat. She could do with a nice glass of pumpkin juice as she was parched. Alas she knew that if dinner was still going on then no one would be in the dorms and she could sneak in and be in bed before anyone even came in.
He chased after her, into the castle, through the corridors he turned the corner to the staircase that went up to the sixth floor. He ran up the staircase to find an empty corridor.
Harry piped in, “That is certainly interesting,” He paused before changing the subject, “Hermione since you’re here, can you help me with my history of magic homework?”
“Then why don’t I come with you some time?” Luna asked. Hermione paused and thought for a moment. She couldn’t see why not and Luna may help Lyra.
Mid-lesson she stopped and looked around. She approached two slytherin blokes, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. She spoke in her usual relaxed but stern tone, “Mr. Goyle, Mr Crabbe, you wouldn’t happen to know where Mr Malfoy is, would you?”
Harry scoffed and started working on assimilating the Bicorn Horn dust into the pot of bubbling troll snot and water. Draco then transferred the cut mandrake root into the mortar and pestle and gently began to grind it in a counter-clockwise direction. Harry looks up at the blonde. Even with the bags under her eyes and her messy composure, hair not brushed and sticking up every which way, clothes wrinkled and in disarray. Despite all that the blonde was beautiful in Harry’s eyes.
She tried to busy herself with her homework but she continued to panic. What if Granger didn’t only tell Lovegood? What if her secret got out? Her fellow slytherins would destroy her. She wasn’t ready to tell anyone. Was Granger going to out her?
Ginny stated, “Or perhaps he’s just having a rough day or week. I bet the slytherins weren’t the most forgiving to his situation yesterday.”
Harry was reading the notes in his book, he hadn’t had his potions textbook at the beginning of the year so Slughorn had loaned him a spare textbook. The textbook happened to have notes from the former owner that helped Harry out greatly. In fact those notes were the only reason Harry was in the Slug Club. Draco was reading from her own textbook but being much more adept to potions did not need to rely on anyone else’s notes to get done.
Back in the castle, two gryffindors and a ravenclaw sat in the library. Moments ago a blonde slytherin had ran out holding his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick. Though as they had all seen, there were tears in his eyes.
As soon as those wonderful words had left Hermione’s mouth, Draco felt that wonderful warmth spread through her body. Accompanying the warmth was the room spinning, to avoid falling over she closed her eyes. She took in every sensation of the transition. When the warmth left, she shivered and blinked her eyes open.
“Well did anything seem off about him?” Hermione inquired, when they reached their table in the library.
Harry and Hermione exchanged a look. Hermione spoke for the both of them, “I didn’t think of that.  I wou-wouldn’t. Lord is that what- is that what you would think?”
Draco woke up due to the cry of robin. She was still next to the lake, her body sore from the hard ground. She looked around and noticed the pink in the sky. The birds were settling down, the forest and grounds were quieting down. She nodded as she snuggled into her cloak, feeling chilly. Then it hit her.
The subject afterwards was dropped. It didn’t truly matter, afterall the question was a random curiosity. Now though it felt important, so important. The name “Lyra” was perfect.
Draco looked him dead in the eye and in poisonous voice said, “I haven’t a clue on what you’re talking about.”
Hermione and Draco then sat in silence together for a moment. Hermione was still in shock over what had just happened. Hermione looked over at who she now knew was a girl. Draco was still crying but not as aggressively as before. Draco was obviously embarrassed by crying in front of Hermione.
“I’m going!” Lyra interjected. She then got up and started toward the door. She hesitated and looked back. Hermione gestured for her to go and Luna flashed a thumbs up. She then stepped out the door.
Harry scolded himself for thinking that. He wasn’t gay right? I mean there was that fling with Diggory but that didn’t mean he was gay?
Draco smiled and laughed along with uproarious laughter in the room. She drawled long and slow, “ I guess I should go hide in my dorm until the magic wears off!”
When Draco walked into the damp dungeon that was the Slytherin Common Room, no one was surprised. By that point almost the whole school had heard what happened. Some of the students hid giggles behind hands, quite a few of the guys smirked and catcalled. Draco just glared in their direction.
“A short break or a forever break?” Harry could feel his heart breaking, he was sure that this isn’t what he expected or wanted.
Sorry for this being updated so much later than it should've been. Thank you so much for the kudos. Enjoy!
He then turned and left the room. Draco fell back on her pillow. Crabbe and Goyle had woken up at this point.
“I mean, I know a place that we could meet and I could cast the spell and then we could just talk and I could help you get used to being a girl,” Hermione explained.
It was a risky lie, if she was actually ill she would have gone to the hospital wing. She couldn’t use that as an excuse because Madame Pomfrey definitely wouldn’t have covered for her. She was hoping with every bone in her body that no one bothered to check the dorm for her. Snape grunted, “Why didn’t you go to the hospital wing then?”
Draco looked at the muggle-born girl, she felt a pang of guilt. Both because she had treated this girl so poorly in the past and because her family would disown her if they knew she was hanging out with a mudblood. Draco internally scolded herself, no purebloods would have offered to help her like this. Well maybe a Weasley would but in a way that’d be much worse than hanging around a muggle-born.
One Sunday morning as Hermione ate by herself. She had woken up earlier than her friends to study for a few hours before her friends wanted to do something. She was reading a book while eating a bowl of oatmeal when a blonde girl sat in front of her.
She stood from her table, knocking one of the books off. This caused everyone in the library to look towards her. She couldn’t bear it. She felt as though everyone could see through her, that they all knew her secret. Her stomach was turning, her limbs were shaking, her eyes producing tears, her lungs heaving for air. She couldn’t breath. She was going to be sick.
Hermione noted how comfortable he looked as a girl, she was sure if it were Ron or Harry they’d exude uncomfort. After much internal debate, Hermione finally decided what to do.
Lyra started laughing. Harry looked over scared, this was the first time he had ever heard Malfoy laugh not cruelly. He stuttered, “What?”
Draco shrieked, “I’m not a boy! I’m broken. It’s all your fault! You introduced me to what it's like to be a girl. And- and…”
A few days had passed. Draco and Hermione were sitting in the room of requirement, which currently stashed a table. They were studying when suddenly Hermione jerked and gasped in a loud and dramatic way. Draco looked up at her and cocked an eyebrow. Hermione held her face in her hands when she said "I just realized I never asked you your preferred name."
Draco crawled back over to her bed. Climbing onto it, she pressed her face, that was wrong, into a pillow and cried.
Draco was pretty infamous at Hogwarts. A slytherin prefect with a reputation of being cruel and merciless. Second in his class, he was cunning and ambitious. His pureblood status made him like a god among his fellow slytherins. He was the picture perfect example of a slytherin. At least that is what the world saw.
“Do you know if there’s a way to, um, make it permanent,” Draco voiced, “I’m asking for a friend, of course.”
The next morning, Draco woke up to Professor Snape entering her dorm. Professor Snape was the head of Slytherin and was in control of the punishment of the Slytherin students. Snape came into the dormitory with the intent to punish Draco for missing class but mainly to find out what was going on with him.
“One of your peers found it and brought it to me,” Snape explained, “They asked to remain anonymous and I’m going to respect their decision.”
Still Harry was shocked that the one person who could finally put a smile on his face was someone who he hated. Maybe he didn’t hate him after all.
Draco ate in silence, thinking of the events of the previous day and what they meant. She wasn’t sure what to do but she needed to know more. If she were to make any case to any slytherin, her parents, hell anyone, she needed to be well educated. Draco was smart, that was a given, but only on the stuff she needed to know. This, whatever this was, was something that had happened to be deemed unknowable by her parents, peers and teachers.
Draco’s smile faltered a second before growing larger. She nodded enthusiastically. Hermione giggled and pointed her wand at the blonde. She said the jinx, charm(?), whatever it was. She watched the male aspects of the Malfoy melt away to reveal more female features. The girl was much shorter than her male by a few inches. Hermione had forgotten how gorgeous she was. She gaped at the girl who had her eyes closed and looked at peace.
Lyra stared at Harry, “God Potter! Can’t I just be friends with someone and I’ve apologized for calling her such a horrid slur. Besides I’m not even into girls.”
She began to run as a sob escaped her body. She ran, she didn’t know where she was going, she just ran. She brushed past two people coming into the library. She rushed past a group of first years, knocking one of them over. She couldn’t think she just had to run, she had to get out.
In retribution, Malfoy had casted a horn-growing hex. This had all happened right as Mr. Filch was passing by. Thence the two of them got detention, which consisted of them both writing a 500 word apology to one another. They were not allowed to leave until they had both read the letter written for them.
Crabbe and Goyle had noticed something was up with her, when they returned to the room last night Draco had already been asleep still in her clothes. Her pillow soaked with tears and she was whimpering in her sleep. They woke up early in the morning to the sound of muffled sobs. They knew who it was from but they didn’t know what to do. They had asked her what was going on but they got a “nothing” in response.
“At least I have the reassurance that Ginny wasn’t cheating on me,” Harry smiled, looking at a cloud shaped like a flower.
Draco had heard Snape enter and also heard the grunts that came from Crabbe and Goyle when he did. Her curtains drawn around her bed, she sat up and fixed her appearance a little. She poked her cheeks and rubbed her eyes. The residue of a mid sleep cry noticeable. She wanted to cry again this morning, but she knew she couldn’t produce many more tears.
“Did you see him though? He looked horrible,” Hermione stated, with extra emphasis on the last word. Harry nodded in agreement. Ginny made eye contact with her brother across the table and rolled her eyes.
Luna looked very concerned and leaned into Lyra. Hermione brushed hair out of Lyra’s face and softly asked, “Who?”
She tried to reassure herself that Granger wouldn’t do that. Would she? Draco didn’t know. Draco wouldn’t know. Draco felt herself starting to cry, she COULDN’T cry in public. If anyone in her house heard about her crying in the library she’d be ostracized for sure.
Pansy started stammer, incredulously, “Are you kidding me? You’re screwing the gryffindor. I can’t I lost to that dweeb. I- ugh.”
Draco walked away after overhearing the conversation that the two Gryffindors were having. She was panicking, Granger had figured her out. Not only that but she was going to go talk to Lovegood about it. What would Lovegood have to do with this? Regardless Lovegood is the last person that Draco wanted to know about this. Due to, that would cause Loony Lovegood to approach Draco and that would not help Draco’s reputation.
“No! I’m not done,” Ginny said, stepping away from Harry, “I feel like you don’t want to be with me and you won’t talk to me anymore. AND don’t think I haven’t noticed you’ve stopped eating. I’m worried for you but you won’t let me in!”
“Kind of,” Hermione joked. Gaining her a push and glare from the blonde. Hermione laughed and much to her own dismay, so did Draco.
Slughorn and Snape were insanely different professors. Where Snape was strict and unforgiving, Slughorn was understanding and celebrated the good work of students with the Slug Club. A club for elite students that, for the most part, gave students an idea as to what dinner parties would be like in adult life. Members included Hermione(no surprise), Ginny(no surprise), Blaise(no surprise), Cormac(no surprise), Melinda(no surprise) and Harry(a surprise).
Lyra collapsed onto the couch, resting her head in Hermione’s lap. After they had discussed for a long time, she had agreed to meet Luna. Then Hermione sent her otter patronus to Luna, asking her to meet her in the room of requirement a quarter past noon, alone.
“Are you and Draco Malfoy a couple?” Luna asked. Hermione was taken aback by the question but not Luna directness.
Hermione, who was usually with Neville, was with Ron. Neville was now with Seamus, who was usually with Dean. Dean was with Queenie, who was usually with Pansy. Pansy was now with Parvati and Lavender, who were usually partnered anyways. Milinda and Hannah were together, as were Theo and Crabbe. That left Draco and Harry.
None of their friends had wanted to know whether or not it was true. Hermione’s friends were wrapped up in the introduction of Ron’s girlfriend Lavender and Harry and Ginny were fighting more and more. For Lyra, Pansy and Blaise were no longer hiding the fact that they had been hooking up for weeks now(Even though Draco and Pansy were still a thing). Since they were all so wrapped up in their own drama no one wanted to figure out whether the two of them were betraying their house loyalties.
“A body is just a body right? What does it matter if it’s male or female?” He thought. Deep down he knew it mattered deeply. Even deeper down he knew that Hermione was right, he wasn’t disgusted. He was delighted.
“Sod off!” Draco cried, throwing the scroll at Hermione. It came as no surprise to her, that he had done the bare minimum. Just as it came as no surprise to him, that she actually wrote an entire essay on why she was wrong.
Hermione stood up, aggressively and loudly causing a wave shushes from the surrounding students. Harry was baffled, “What do mean he’s not he? Why would you need to talk to Luna?”
A few hours later, Lyra found herself pacing the length of the room. A concerned Hermione watched from the couch that was in front of a large window with a sea view. She soothingly said, “Lyles, please calm down.”
Draco’s attention was drawn back to her own table when she heard the clank of metal against china. She turned her attention to Pansy sitting next to her, whose mouth was agape and eyes were wide. She turned to look at Crabbe and Goyle, who both had a similar expression. She growled, “What?”
Goyle whispered, “Oh you’re asleep. You weren’t at dinner so I grabbed you something to eat in hopes you’d be here. I also got you some water. Oh I don’t know why I’m talking to a sleeping person. You can’t hear me. Well if you can, I’ll leave them on your bedside table.”
Shortly after potions, during Hermione and Harry’s study period that day, Hermione grilled Harry with questions. Not entirely something Harry had expected.
“You better not call her that to her face,” Hermione scoffed. Lyra nodded, right as the door opened. Lyra jumped up, eyeing the other girl in the doorway nervously.
Then the image of a blonde slytherin popped in his head. He bolted awake, not surprised that he thought of Draco but the way he thought of him. He shook himself and sat up. He looked around the common room. Only a few other students were in the common room.
Luna shook her head. Harry then started to go on a rant about his relationship and how Ginny felt distant and general issues. Harry found himself, “Then there are these new feelings for Malf-”
Hermione, having been working hard on it, had already finished. Although she had lots of pride, she understood when it needed to be put aside to do what needs to be done. Beside this detention was cutting into her valuable study time.
Hermione was shocked. Even though she had assumed that what was going on, Harry set her straight yesterday. With Ginny and Ron supporting him, she had almost completely forgotten the possibility. She felt a little proud that she was right but she felt horrible knowing she was right when it was tearing this poor girl apart.
“I’m trying to ‘Mione. I just,” Lyra took a breath, “I’m just nervous. I mean she’s the first person who’s going to meet me like this. Other than obviously. I’m scared, what if she doesn’t accept me, Minnie?”
Lyra looked up when Hermione walked past, she almost missed the paper that Hermione dropped. She picked it up, read the note, and finished eating. Once she’d finished eating she ran to her dormitory quickly to grab some homework to work on with Hermione.
The fact that the two of them were in detention came as no surprise to the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore. What had landed them in detention, however, was surprising to him. In Hermione’s own words she had “Kinda, sorta hit Malfoy with a sex transition hex.”
The tone of her voice surprised her. It was so deep and gruff. She’d forgotten what her body was. She remembered why she had cried and groaned. She stretched and sighed. It’d be an issue she’d deal with on a later day. For now, she had to deal with the punishment of missing the majority of her classes.
Harry set his stuff down, “I don’t know, Hermione. Maybe Ginny’s right, maybe he’s just going through a tough time.”
Ginny took a small break from gazing into Harry’s eyes and muttered hello before returning to looking longingly into his eyes. Harry didn’t even acknowledge Hermione’s appearance. Hermione couldn’t help but think, “Won’t they just snog already?”
The door shut behind Hermione when she walked in. She looked at the room, astounded by the simple beauty of it. She walked over to the armchair and set down her bag next to it. She plopped into it and smiled at Draco, who still stood in the doorway taking the room in. She cleared her throat.
He thought about the Weasley twins and their pranks, Molly Weasley’s delicious mince pies, Ginny. He thought of how he absolutely adored the Weasley family, how they were the family he never had. His eyelids became heavy. Feeling warm and content, he started to doze off.
Draco shook free of his grip, “I know that. Cutting it into smaller pieces will make it easier to grind it.”
Harry watched as Draco Malfoy walked away. He was stunned. Draco Malfoy was gay? Was there a possibility of him being gay for? No, Harry couldn’t think like that. Not when, well everything had happened so soon, how much pain had been so recent.
“Why do you care Malfoy?” Harry growled, looking toward the lake, “I thought unbearable was your thing.”
Weeks passed with the same routine for one Malfoy and one Granger. Breakfast with their friends, go to class, meet in the room of requirement after classes, hang out together until dinner, eat with their respective friends, go to their respective dorms, sleep and repeat.  Of course after the first week, a hufflepuff and ravenclaw saw the two of them leaving the room of requirement together and from then on rumors of their “love affair” had began to spread. Which whenever they were asked, they denied it.
Hermione’s concern increased when she heard a sob emit from the blonde sitting with his back to her. She’d seen him from the window pulling at his hair but she didn’t expect him to be crying. She stood a moment, unsure what to do. She climbed over the bench and in a gentle tone said “Are you ok?”
Crabbe and Goyle, Draco’s henchmen, walked over. Laughing. Crabe joked “Damn Malfoy, who knew you’d be so hot as a girl?”
“I-I’m not sure you guys are interpreting this correctly. I mean isn’t that presumptuous?” Harry stammered, looking around carefully.
I'm so sorry this took such long time to write. My life has been chaos for the past 5 months or so, I just haven't been able to keep up. Don't worry I will try to update more often.
After ten minutes of pushing food around her plate, Draco stood up. Murmured some half-ass excuse and walked out of the Great Hall. She did have intention to go and drop by McGonagall’s office before her first class. Though as she was walking towards the tower that housed McGonagall’s office, she found her feet moving in a different direction. She moved down the hall towards the dungeon where her common room lived then turned before reaching it and went up a staircase and out a door into a courtyard. She walked over to a bench by a tree and collapsed.
They read in silence, Hermione stopped reading after the 54th “I’m sorry”. Draco only half read, you see he saw the words but didn’t fully process them. Nevertheless, he got the jist.
This was not a harmonious pairing. The two of them got along dastardly. That is to say they didn’t. The two apparent boys sat next to one another, the air between them thick with uncomfort. The blonde haired one was trying to focus on her notes and book, they had to brew a Pepperup potion. A potion that fell into the must know practicality category. It helped to relieve cold(and other ailments) symptoms, a very practical potion indeed.
Once again he got distracted by his body. He truly didn’t understand why it meant so much to him but
The features of his or her face were softer than normal. Her nose was less sharp, her cheekbones were not as prominent. Her jawline was softer and rounder. In general, Draco Malfoy in female form was a spitting image of his mother. Other than the hair, which was still platinum blonde but hung in curls around her face past her breasts. The male uniform was ill-fitting in an adorable way, due to losing 3 or 4 inches in height.
“I know you’re probably going through a hard time with your dad in azkaban and all. But no matter what, I’m your girlfriend. I’m here to comfort you and when I heard the rumor. I was furious, so what the hell is going on?”
Draco started to cut the mandrake root into small pieces to make it easier to grind, when Harry grabbed her arm to stop her.
“Well- I don’t know. Something is going on with him,” Hermione retorted, “Did you not listen to any of what I said about our detention?”
Draco and Hermione shared a study period, it was midday the period before lunch. They both would go to the library to study, a fact that neither of them noticed. Until that day when Draco noticed.
“Ok so not Andromeda,” Hermione responded then pointed at another constellation, “Cassiopeia. You could go by Cassie.”
Harry shifted to lean against the couch. He sighed and rubbed his eyes. Scolding himself, he shouldn’t be thinking about Draco in that way, let alone another guy. Hell he shouldn’t be thinking that way about anyone. He’s in a happy relationship, right?
What he didn’t realize was Hermione was watching him closely. Something about his behavior reminded her of what Luna had described. Suddenly Hermione had the urge to reach out to him, this urge confused her. I mean for god's sake, it was Draco Malfoy. Someone who had tormented her and her friends since first year. Though she did help people in need and well he certainly looked like he was in need. His eyebrows pushed down on his face in confusion, yet somehow he was still pretty. Hermione would be the first to admit this.
Draco nodded, looking away. Draco felt like crying, something that had become normal now. The reason she felt like crying was different though. She was sure none of her friends would have given her stuff to Snape and then asked to remain anonymous. So that meant someone who wasn’t friends with her had found her stuff and instead of defacing it or destroying it had decided to do a good deed and didn’t even want the credit. She didn’t understand why someone would do that. She also didn’t understand why she’d become so emotional over it. She assumed it was because of her unstable mental state and shook herself mentally.
The two girls looked at each other. After a moment, the blonde began to giggle. Soon both girls were giggling with excitement. Draco stood up and spun looking down, giggling. She shouted “Look at me! LOOK AT ME!”
Draco began to put the powdered bicorn horn into the cauldron as Harry continued to stir. The two of them worked in comfortable silence after their little quarrel at the beginning. Both of them trusting the others decisions. They were working in perfect harmony by the time the potion was finished.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"We didn't have any astronomy homework, did we?" Hermione asked, looking at the large astronomy book on the table.
She heard a voice say from behind her. She knew the voice, Hermione Granger. She froze, she tried hard to stop crying. She clasped a hand over her mouth and breathed. A sob escaped her, she hated it. She hated that Granger saw her like this, she hated that she would ask what’s wrong. She hated that she knew she’d let it slip.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Interesting? Well I’m sure anything with a female Malfoy would be,” Ron chuckled. Hermione smiled and laughed with him. She instinctively laid her head on his shoulder but only for a second before pulling away. The laughter on her part became awkward but Ron barely noticed. She wasn’t sure what the shot of adrenaline to her stomach was but it startled her.
For that afternoon, they forgot about everything else. They ended up in two beautiful gowns(the blonde in a sleek black gown that hugged her hips, with a halter top, and backless and the brunette in pale blue dress with multiple petticoats, a structured bodice and droopy sleeves), doing their homework until dinner. The magic wore off and they went seperate ways, agreeing to meet again the next day. Draco although hated her current body, she was happy with the prospect of the next day.
At this moment he was glaring at two hufflepuffs standing at a tree near the lake. The blonde of the pair was leaning against the tree and smiling down at the shorter brunette. It made him so angry.
She began her walk to the castle, on the way she thought of any excuse that could get her out of trouble. She could blame the care of magical creatures professor, Hagrid, but she thought she’d already tormented him enough. Plus it would be her word against his and well he was much reputable. She could tell the truth but omit some details. Such as her crying or her reason for being outside.
Draco walked over to the book shelf and cleared her throat, Hermione looked up then back down. Draco cleared her throat a little louder, Hermione turned to look at her and then back. Draco cleared her throat even louder, Hermione turned and said “Can I help you, Malfoy?”
Luna pulled back, holding Lyra’s hands, “I’m like you. You’re like me! We were both born in the wrong.”
So it wasn’t the pride that was preventing Draco from writing. For this was the first time in his life, he felt right. He knew that it shouldn’t have been, he was in the wrong body, right? Even still as he looked at his body in female form, he couldn’t help but feel like it
Lyra took a deep breath and pulled her hair in front of her. She declared, “Ok. I’m going to do it.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After Draco had finished eating, she excused herself, “I have some homework I have to finish in the library. I’ll see in transfiguration.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, she hated being the smart one. Normally, homework was the one thing that Hermione did not help with. She figured it was better if they learned themselves. Though needing to do her own history of magic homework, she obliged, “Very well, Harry. But this is the only time!”
Draco's face scrunched for a second in confusion. Then she showed recognition as she responded, "I guess I haven't thought of it."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry nodded. Hermione looked away, thinking. The ravenclaw with dirty blonde hair and funny looking pair pink glasses on her head, looked out the window. She thought before speaking in a dreamy tone, which was typical for her speech, “Maybe you are right, Hermione. Perhaps she’s concerned you’ll out her.”
That afternoon after potions, both Hermione and Draco said goodbye to their friends saying they were heading to the library. Both met two staircases away from potions, Hermione grabbed Draco’s hand and started walking up to the 6th floor.
Blaise looked at Pansy with a look of hunger in his eyes and cocked an eyebrow. Pansy pushed his face away while rolling her eyes and laughing.
A thing that should be stated about Crabbe and Goyle is that they were commonly viewed as one entity though they were individuals. Vincent Crabbe was much more aggressive and unpleasant but he was fiercely loyal and wasn’t afraid to admit when he was wrong. Gregory Goyle on the other hand was more of a gentle giant. Not that he wasn’t conniving in his own way but he was genuine and caring towards his friends. It was likely that if it weren’t for his ambition and resourcefulness that he would have ended up in Hufflepuff. By this point, all his friends had come to understand and accept him. Even if he was a little soft.
“So I heard Granger and Weasley finally got married. Was it nice? The wedding? You know, seeing everyone again?” For a moment Harry felt completely off-kilter. Malfoy asking after Ron and Hermione’s wedding was, well, strange. So he didn’t answer, which apparently made Malfoy want to explain. “It usually helps me to think about something else, you know, after I’ve had a nightmare. So I thought you might-.” He stopped, his voice having gone uncharacteristically quiet.
“So, still feel the need to see what I’m up to, Potter?” Malfoy’s voice sounded indifferent, accent posh– another thing about him that hadn’t changed - but there was something else too, something Harry couldn’t quite make out.
“Yes, I thought perhaps something was wrong, so I went to your house and I saw-. Don’t worry, I left again immediately.” His voice was all cool indifference now. Good.
that.” A silence followed that Zabini eventually filled with: “You know I wasn’t even allowed to visit him there.”
“No, they tend to run when I look their way.” He had aimed for his tone to be condescending, cool, but it came out slightly bitter, because it was true: although many wizards and witches apparently had trouble with him not being in Azkaban, they were never brave enough to show their faces. Sometimes Draco didn’t even know why. It wasn’t like cursing an ex Death Eater would get Auror priority.
changed. You’re -. Oh, you even visit Muggle clubs, for fuck’s sake.” Potter huffed a laugh and so did Draco, the tension broken. And Potter’s eyes were still so green and his hand so warm against his arm. And -.
addressing Harry, her voice stuck between sympathetic and truly worried. “But I suppose you’ve both grown up enough to be completely professional about this,” she added, perhaps slightly too brightly.
“I can cook us up something, if you’d like.” There was a question there, that Draco didn’t want to answer. The last time he had, the dream had abruptly ended.
“No, I don’t actually have Allure,” Draco started to explain, just before his brain caught up with what Harry had said, with what it had meant. “Like what?” Draco’s throat was completely dry all of a sudden. “Allure is nothing like what?”
“What?” he asked absentmindedly, getting up, feeling his face drain of all colour. “No, sorry, you don’t have to-,” he said, stopping Hermione from explaining everything all over again, “I-, I should leave.”
Draco’s classes today had gone completely according to plan: everything had worked, everyone had at least made
So that was why he had asked his secretary Agatha to schedule talks with all staff working in Auror Training: a schedule being a necessity since most of them worked for Training part-time, filling the rest of their working hours doing their normal jobs, usually at the Ministry.
So, he’d been working his arse off, not having an awful lot of time to himself and even if he did, he mostly spent it reading in the living room - sitting at the dinner table by absence of a sofa - too tired to do anything else. Apart from mostly regular visits to his mother at the Manor and one rather obligatory, and very uncomfortable, visit to his father in Azkaban, that was.
“Good,” Draco nodded. Harry would be able to go back to hating him in health again soon enough. “Do you need anything else?” Draco’s voice sounded carefully indifferent.
Potter just looked at him, still somewhat shocked and obviously completely unsure of what to do next.
Malfoy regarded the box in silence for a moment, his brow furrowing and something that looked remarkably like pain somehow flickering in his eyes. However, just as Harry had started to think that he’d made a mistake, taking the box to Malfoy, Malfoy started to speak.
Draco took the vial without further comment, using his wand to extract the silvery substance of his memory and putting it in.
“Good. Now I could definitely do with some tea.” Zabini drawled instead, eyeing the pot Harry had ordered Draco for breakfast. Harry himself only started functioning after a cup of coffee in the morning.
Draco slung the blanket off of himself and got up. He found his shirt – neatly folded, which was a bit of a surprise, because Draco knew Harry didn’t normally fold anything neatly, really – on a chair and put it on, fumbling with the buttons in his haste to do them up.
And then it suddenly dawned on Harry. Yes, of course it would have to be the prat he’d actively avoided for the last, well let’s see, eleven years. Since the trials to be exact.
When Harry had finished briefing Zabini, he pushed Draco gingerly: “Draco.” and Draco’s eyes snapped open again. “Can you stand? We can’t Apparate here.” He heard the panic lacing his words.
He had been reaching his phone forward, and Harry realised he’d probably just wanted to show him, but now he pulled it back again, getting up in the same movement, his face shuttered.
Harry Potter, the one that had saved the wizarding world – seemed completely lacking now. So Harry didn’t, instead feeling his anger at those fucking bastards that had been calling themselves guards at Azkaban sear.
This time Harry made short work of cooking: doing simple cheese toasties with tomatoes and unions that still tasted like heaven. Draco only noticed how hungry he was, now he was actually eating: just one toastie not even nearly enough.
Draco and Harry had made it back to the Ministry’s Atrium, knowing that the rest of their afternoon would most probably be spent acquainting themselves with the case they’d been assigned.
“So you treat many Veela, then?” Draco couldn’t quite help his sarcasm spilling, knowing full well what the answer would be.
So Harry just watched Malfoy for a moment, facing him fully now and he felt himself fill with something soft that he wasn’t able to put words to. So he lifted his hand, not quite knowing where he was going to put it yet, until Malfoy caught it in his, interlacing their fingers. “Let’s try and get some sleep.”
“Merlin, now I really need a drink,” Potter stated when they finally made it off the dance floor again.
Then he switched to: “We’ve taken those four bastards into custody, by the way. They’re in secured cells completely off the grid, so the Cartel won’t know what happened to them. That’s necessary so as to not compromise your Glamours, but I think it might also be for their own good. The Cartel doesn’t usually take kindly to their people being captured. Captives form a liability, you know, in case they would be inclined to start spilling beans.” A sly look crossed Zabini’s face. “I think I should probably be talking to them from that perspective. Might get us some intel.”
“I’m going to get another round of spells in and if those don’t work either-. Well, let’s just hope that isn’t necessary,” Draco said, under his breath. Harry nodded, watching him. He didn’t seem aggravated, though, just a bit impatient and Draco realised he’d expected Harry to be utterly fed up by now, angry even.
“Harry, I’m glad you’ve agreed to do this,” Robards said, sounding decidedly pleased, “but only one small matter remains to be discussed.”
So Harry set to work: making tea and toast, of course, but also fried eggs, bacon and sausages. He even salvaged a tin of baked beans from his pantry: he’d never cared much for those himself, but Malfoy might. He knew Ginny had loved them.
So in an instant his hand was on the nape of Harry’s neck, pulling him in for a kiss that was searing and so, so needy. Under different circumstances Draco would probably have been embarrassed about it, but he didn’t get the chance, because all of a sudden Harry’s hand touched his shoulder, having sneaked its way under Draco’s bathrobe, touching his bare skin, which made fireworks go off all over.
He felt wired though, not at ease and he realised he was holding on to the reassuring thought that he could always get to his classroom early, if he had to. If Potter didn’t show.
And then he felt it: the push of wards much stronger than those at the gate. They weren’t just keeping him out, though, but almost made him
Draco saw Harry go down, unconscious, then the fire the curse also caused. Draco kept up his shield almost without thinking, kneeling at Harry’s side again, not able to undo the spell damage easily this time.
Harry unwrapped the present slowly, carefully, and Draco had to swallow a few times, quite unsuccessfully trying to get rid of the nervousness that threatened to take over all of a sudden.
“What-?” one of the men started, but Harry really didn’t want to hear, gagging the both of them with an impatient, wandless spell in one go.
Potter didn’t seem to think there was either, though, or at least if he did, he didn’t show. His eyes just lit up. “I didn’t check the Dark magic section yet. Thanks.” And it sounded like Draco had just given him a gift, one he’d actually wanted to get. Draco inwardly sighed at how happy that apparently made him.
Luckily Malfoy hadn’t spotted him yet. Malfoy was in a booth, trying to talk to someone over the noise of the club. It just took Harry a bit more time to recognise who Malfoy’s companion was. Right. Blaise Zabini.
“Of course you were.” Malfoy didn’t quip, but merely stated, quiet and completely serious. “Annoying, aren’t they.” There was a hint of humour there, but it wasn’t at Harry’s expense, more of an attempt to lighten the mood a little.
“Do you need help?” Harry looked at Draco almost expectantly, falling silent for a beat and when Draco didn’t answer straight away, he apparently decided to elaborate: “I mean I can’t visit Ron until visiting hours and I would like to do something, you know, to take my mind off things.”
So Harry looked at Draco’s wound himself, carefully examining it as best he could. Then, finding that at least it seemed to be a clean cut, he started to cast healing spells. Every Auror had to learn the basic ones, of course, but Harry had never been particularly good at them. Now he seemed to be doing rather well for a change, though: stopping the bleeding and neatly stitching Draco’s skin together.
progress. And although Draco still had to finish an assignment in Curse-Breaking before he could start his weekend, he felt lighter somehow, good.
He and Astoria had both known the marriage wouldn’t be a romantic affair, just convenience, meant to appease their respective families, and giving them both the freedom to have whomever they wanted on the side.
But here they were, in the middle of the dance floor in this Muggle gay bar and Draco decided to give it his best.
Potter looked up, his eyes slowly sliding over Draco’s body to his face. “You’re here?” He sounded surprised, but not displeased. That must be good.
actually was a name Draco recognised. Yes, about three months ago, Romanian Dragon Sanctuary. Draco had been called in on a rather viciously wounded man who had crossed a dragon at the wrong time and the wrong place.
“Draco, it’s okay. Don’t talk. Just-. I’m going to take you to your room. Okay?” Harry’s voice sounded reassuring and warm as he said it, which to his own surprise was exactly how he’d meant it.
“You really should leave now, though,” Draco said and  when Harry looked up, Draco’s eyes met his, determined, but for a moment also holding an unexpected softness that Harry wasn’t quite ready for, but that he also seemed to want to hold on to. Draco’s eyes were so mesmerizing when they were soft, when he seemed vulnerable. Fuck.
Draco just nodded, pleased that Harry apparently liked what he saw. “You haven’t painted the walls, yet, though?” It actually was more of a question than a statement.
And all of a sudden Harry realised that home meant two different places. And that … . But, no, surely Draco couldn’t think-. Not after the afternoon they’d just spent.
need to leave for work soon, Malfoy wasn’t there. He’d apparently been there, though, because there was a full fry up under a Stasis Charm on Harry’s kitchen table, but Malfoy himself was conspicuously absent.
Harry, sitting up, seemed to read his mind, though. “I’m really glad you did. You’re quite good at duelling, but you’re not an Auror. I doubt you could have taken Mathew and his shield down without your Veela side kicking in. Which reminds me:
Harry seized him, strong arms around his waist, just before Draco lost his balance. “Hey, careful.” Harry’s voice was warm in Draco’s ear and Draco leant towards him even more without thinking.
Sleep just kept eluding him. He did doze off a few times, but it never lasted long and Harry wasn’t even sure that he wanted it to, anymore.
Potter was in the hallway, flushing slightly as he looked up at Draco, then down, and up again as if he couldn’t believe Draco was actually wearing his clothes.
He’d turned onto his back - still undecided, but having extricated his body from Harry’s just slightly already - when he noticed Harry was awake too. “Don’t,” Harry just said.
“No comment. And as for the other question: no, I don’t think we have anything else to discuss just now, so you’re free to leave and play bodyguard.”
He nodded. “So you know? About the pain? What caused it?” Draco looked up at Harry, trying to find the disgust he knew must be hiding there, somewhere in his eyes. He couldn’t find it.
“I hope they let him rot in Azkaban for the rest of his life,” Harry had intended to say it under his breath, but it came out loud and fierce.
Draco had obviously seen it too, whipping his already tattered right sleeve off, throwing it to the ground and setting it aflame with a quick
“Yes, of course.” Draco purposely didn’t mention he’d basically been ready since early morning, which was a feat, because he really didn’t like getting up early. He
“Yes. Yes, I do.” Draco still didn’t exactly know whether that was a good thing necessarily, but they
Malfoy just walked in and retrieved them without acknowledging Harry’s presence any further, making it out the door without another word.
“So, tomorrow we’re going to leave Hogwarts. And next year we won’t be coming back,” Draco mused. It was a truth Draco hadn’t appreciated the exact implications of until he’d said it. Harry fell silent.
It was only when the Healer that came in asked Draco to get up – so he would be able to have a better look - that the pain spiked, suddenly getting to be so intense that Draco mercifully passed out.
And that’s what Draco did, in one gracefully fluent motion, Harry’s shirt fitting him better than it would ever fit Harry.
Draco looked at him, his eyes the soft silver that Harry could never really get enough of. Then Draco suddenly smirked. “I suppose we’d better hurry, though, because I think Mrs Weasley will probably kill us
Harry swallowed when he saw him, looking Draco over slowly. “You erm-, you look really good,” Harry started.
Draco didn’t know how long they’d been standing there, how long he’d been stupidly crying like the absolute wuss he apparently was, but as soon as he felt more stable again, he also felt completely mortified. He hadn’t let himself go like that with anyone, ever, and this was
Draco knew where they were going, it’s where Dumbledore’s Army met the previous year. Draco had found out about it and tried to catch them there but had failed. It was the room of requirement.
Crabbe looked at Goyle then leaned forward and whispered, “I don’t know if I should tell you this but he was crying last night.”
“It’s almost like you have a crush on him or something,” Ron said, directed more towards Hermione than anything, “Seriously, how obsessed can you be with someone who has done nothing but torment us?”
Dismissing any thoughts of blood purity, she flipped to a map of the constellations. Hermione got up and they both leaned over the book. Hermione pointed at one of the constellations, “Andromeda is a girls name.”
Luna looked at him for the first time since they started talking and Harry stopped himself. He continued, “You know what, that doesn’t matter. I just, I don’t know what to do Luna.”
Lyra remembered that the next day was Halloween, she had been so distracted with everything going she had forgotten. She was excited for the festivities. During her afternoons with Hermione, she had learned of the muggle traditions. They had even decided to have a costume party of their own the afternoon before the feast. Lyra was looking forward to it.
Now they sat discussing what they’d seen and what it would mean. The only boy among them knew something that neither girl did. He informed the girls, “He overheard what we were talking about ‘mione.”
“I’ll have to check with him,” Hermione said. Luna nodded and stood up, she said a brief goodbye and went over to the ravenclaw table.
The boy gryffindor met with another red headed gryffindor boy on their way to transfiguration, another class they had with the slytherins. They walked into the airy classroom. The dark haired one had his eyes peeled for a particular blonde haired slytherin.
He could barely focus in class, Dumbledore had told him to a week or two off and hadn’t summoned him. McGonagall had called him into her office to have a discussion about the break up and even Snape had been kinder to him. However Ron and Hermione had kept their distance and Harry found himself completely alone.
“For what it’s worth: I don’t think this will last very long. You probably undermined the strength of the spell quite a bit with your
Potter startled out of his conversation. “Malfoy. You’re here.” His voice sounded slightly surprised, but that strangely wasn’t all.
When Jones couldn’t see them anymore Draco asked Harry to use his cloak to cover them both. They had to crouch a bit to fit, keeping close to each other, close enough for Harry to smell Draco’s cologne. It actually was rather nice.
Harry nodded slowly. “Yeah, at least I didn’t get harassed by fans, or anyone else. That was a nice change.”
Eventually they ended up playing the whole morning, and then some: Draco not telling Harry to leave and Harry not wanting to let this go just yet. He didn’t want it to stop.
Harry cast again, this time with so much intent it would actually have petrified the wall it hit, if that had been sentient - and able to move - in the first place.
Malfoy had most definitely never been Harry’s friend, not in any sense of the word, but something just felt terribly off here.
, building. Malfoy went straight for the stairs, expertly evading a group of teens sitting there. He was obviously expecting Harry to follow, but Harry lingered behind, looking at the lift. They had to go all the way up to the twelfth floor after all.
And then he just wished he hadn’t remembered, because really it couldn’t get much worse than this: losing consciousness on Harry Potter’s doorstep, practically swooning into his arms.
So, that’s why Harry was currently staring at Draco Malfoy, who was standing across the huge ballroom, being completely at ease of course. He was leaning against the bar, elegantly dressed in formal robes that were cut to still tease at his tall, slim physique. His white-blonde hair was longish again and would be reaching to his jawline if it hadn’t been slicked back. It was a hairstyle Harry had never particularly cared for, but Malfoy still managed to look undeniably good.
Harry decided not to go into that, keeping silent for a bit, while Zabini briefly studied him, a slightly puzzled expression on his face that was almost gone the moment it had appeared. Then he just said: “I take it Draco went to work at the potions lab after he got himself out of the hospital?”
So, here he was, probably, no certainly, not looking his best, but he was here all the same. He hadn’t put much effort, well, even less than normally, into his appearance this morning, just glad he’d made it almost in time, but as soon as he stepped into Robard’s office he knew that had been a mistake.
No one had actually seen anything - of course they hadn’t - but when Harry and Lisa had talked to the victim for the umpteenth time, he had reluctantly told them that the Firebolt he proudly kept in his living room wasn’t actually his. It was his daughter-in-law’s. And the daughter-in-law had very definitely not given the wizard permission to put it on show in his living room.
“No, not like th-. Draco, you’re hurt! There are lacerations and-, and they’re bleeding. How didn’t anyone notice-?”
It took a while before they broke the kiss again, the both of them flushed and breathing fast. And Harry just seized that moment to look around, making sure that no one was actually paying heed to them, then apparated them straight to his house.
When he had finally made it out of the hospital, Harry had wanted to find Francois, just to tell him what happened, but then he had realised he didn’t have any means of getting in touch with him. Francois always contacted him.
“Yes, well, you do know what doors are for.” Draco sounded as indifferent as ever. “I mean you can close them and -.”
But when the lights finally stopped flickering, Harry saw him immediately: Draco Malfoy was bartending. If someone would have asked Harry what he thought the prat would be doing by now, this certainly wouldn’t have been on his list. Yet, here he was, working behind the bar and doing a good job of it, too, by the looks of it. He was actually mixing a drink with practiced ease and insolent skill, his whole body moving in a way that was both elegant and sure. The beautiful witch he was mixing for obviously couldn’t take her eyes off him.
uncomfortable. Until it was broken. “I did.” Draco’s voice was a whisper, barely there. “You erm-, were busy, I think.”
When it was time for Harry to appear at the Cartel’s estate again, he was more than ready. Although Harry had felt like this particular day had actually put up a real fight not to have to go anywhere, it had eventually had to give in: it had gone by.
Draco just shook his head, slowly. He didn’t remember and it would probably have been better if he’d remained blissfully unaware. He must have looked a right mess.
Harry liked the way Draco looked. Which made him remember again: tomorrow Draco would be gone, out of this room, out of Harry’s house, out of his life completely.
“Harry’s here,” Luna said, reassuringly, “It’s never a good idea to separate a Veela and his mate, certainly not when they’re hurt.”
Harry nodded, watching him a bit too long: Malfoy really looked wan, but he also looked undeniably good somehow. And for just the tiniest of moments Harry thought about asking him about tomorrow: would he be at the club? Then decided against it.
As if on cue the atrium started to disappear and Harry felt himself quiet down. A few shaky breaths later he was able to open his eyes, turning a little to find Malfoy hovering over him, a soft orb of light hanging suspended in the air beside him.
Harry, standing to his side to be able to reach his wings, glanced at him, hooded, pupils wide. Then he pulled Draco in, flush together, one hand still lightly touching Draco’s wing from over his shoulder.
“Yes, although I still don’t have a clue as to whom it might be,” Zabini answered, his voice laced with badly concealed frustration for a moment, just before he caught himself again. “So I suppose we’ll have to find out.”
Then Draco leant in a bit, one arm around Potter’s waist now and the other one sliding up his back, slowly, ending up on his shoulder blade. Potter looked up, his eyes searching, while Draco looked right back, firmly remembering not to chicken out.
Which was so unexpected it made Harry snort a laugh. “Well, I could actually use someone to help with that,” he said. The pile on his desk really was quite enormous, and it tended to grow, especially when he wasn’t looking.
someone shot at Harry from the side, while Harry had been casting at the guard straight in front of him, causing Harry’s
“All of them. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but last Wednesday someone tried to break in. They didn’t succeed, but I refreshed all my wards all the same, adding all the newer ones just to be sure.”
But now they actually seemed to have found something worthwhile, judging by the tone of Harry’s voice.
“I didn’t know whether you’d believe-. And I did have to get my clothes, anyway, so I thought-.” Malfoy went heavy on the drawling, but this time Harry had the distinct impression he was making an attempt at hiding something else entirely.
got what you wanted out of the experience. But Harry hadn’t even told Malfoy he was new to this, which would at least have given Malfoy the opportunity to bail out. Harry had wanted to tell him, had wanted to say that he’d never been with a man before, but sometime between the kissing and undressing that resolve had gotten lost, drowned out by pleasure.
Harry had to remind himself that eating on his own was normal. He’d done it tons of times. It shouldn’t matter at all that there was someone else in the house who clearly wasn’t joining him.
Zabini just gave him an odd look for a moment, furrowing his brow. “Draco didn’t want you to know. He thought it would put you off.” Harry wanted to start telling Zabini how uncalled for that was, how ridiculous, but Zabini didn’t give him a chance to, saying: “Well, would you have taken on this assignment if you had known you’d be working with Draco Malfoy on everything? Honestly?” snidely adding, when Harry didn’t give in straight away: “Perhaps I need to remind you I actually saw your face when you’d only heard you were going to be Draco’s
Draco turned slightly, careful not to show the surprise he was clearly feeling, his lips just short of touching Potter’s face. “Of course.” He knew he most definitely wasn’t going to back out of this again: just having concluded that he and Potter really
And that was when Draco felt it for the first time: a sharp pain in his upper back. It was there one moment and then it was gone, fortunately easy to ignore.
But Zabini had just told him not to fret (‘Really, it doesn’t do your Glamour any favours.’), so Harry had decided not to.
It annoyed Harry considerably. What had the git expected: that he’d trust him enough to have his own room? So Malfoy could take off without Harry noticing early enough to do anything about it? That definitely wasn’t going to happen. Harry might think there was something off, but that certainly didn’t mean he actually trusted Malfoy.
“Do you keep hangover potion somewhere?” Harry couldn’t help the slight tease in his voice. Malfoy was just so-, so
“Malfoy.” This Friday, however, Potter acknowledged Draco first and then he did something else: he smiled, just a little, as he eventually had last Monday, after he’d been forced to have Draco translate whole conversations and they’d somehow managed to get through the day without any major problems.
They found some other rooms like the large office space, but smaller. And then they made it to a huge, carved door.
“Anything interesting in the papers?” Draco’s drawl held warmth and amusement and before Harry could turn around Draco was there, against his back, snaking his arms around Harry’s waist, Draco's chin pointily resting on Harry’s shoulder, so Draco was able to see for himself.
Draco had been on assignments out of the country most of the time: he hadn’t even been able to visit his mother every week, like he’d wanted to. So, besides work, there had been preciously little time left to visit London.
They’d landed in a drab part of London: faceless blocks of flats lining roads that were just as depressing. And Malfoy, after having cast another quick
Harry heard the vial hit Draco’s hand, then him drinking it – he always drank first when he procured it, the egocentric bastard – and only then did Harry open his own eyes and sit up a bit, enough to be able to drink too. Draco wordlessly handed him the vial.
Watching himself he concluded he didn’t look that bad: a bit ruffled, his hair an even bigger mess than usual, but nothing too horrible, nothing that warranted Malfoy to make Harry stay here, in their suite.
time for Draco to get up, however, so Draco sighed and extricated himself from Harry, knowing that Harry would take less time to get ready for work than he did.
So, it was only when his stomach started to make admittedly embarrassing noises of disapproval with being ignored, that he decided to ask Draco whether he could make them something to eat.
Except for the paperwork, which was something he would probably never get used to, his job meant doing something he actually liked to do, putting his skills to full use.
“So there is no way of finding out?” Potter sounded like it was more of a question than a statement, as if he still thought it should be investigated, perhaps even punished.
Harry effortlessly picked up on the humour and smiled, bright and genuine. “Yeah well, I suspect I’ll never hear the end of that,” he teased, then got serious again. “Can I touch them?”
very attractive like this: relaxed, strands of his blond hair falling into his face, lighting up almost like silver in this light.
Malfoy was sitting on the curb, one long leg outstretched and the other drawn in, his arm casually leaning on his knee, a glass of whiskey in his hand. He was watching Harry, but it didn’t seem antagonizing, more resigned if anything. And wary too, possibly.
So Harry made Draco look at him again. “I would really like you to stay.” He said, completely sincerely
Blaise watched him. “Well, he won’t be able to ignore it completely, because it’s not an owl: he won’t be able to shoo it away without even opening the parchment.”
That made Draco look up, his brow a puzzled frown. “You don’t?” he asked, his voice still cool, but tinged with something else, something that sounded like the tiniest sliver of hope.
It was why his mouth found Malfoy’s where he’d been talking into Harry’s ear, which resulted in a searing kiss, the invisible fire blazing between them unrelentingly. It was something neither of them were able to ignore or withstand, their kiss deepening easily, making it into something much more urgent and needy. Was this what kissing a man was like?
“Don’t leave,” Harry clarified anyway. “You can get a change of clothes from your place before work, if you want to. I’ll set the alarm early.” And then he proceeded to do just that, setting the alarm, then pulling Draco towards him as if that settled it.
The first time Harry saw him again it took him completely by surprise. Yet, there he was: Draco Malfoy. In a Muggle club. Harry couldn’t help but stare, because, well …, Draco Malfoy in a
“You will do absolutely no such thing. I’ll take the rug: you’ve always been appalling at transfiguration and your cushioning charms are bound to be even worse.”  Malfoy’s words caught Harry by surprise. Until he registered that next to apparently not wanting to rob Harry of his bed, Malfoy had also managed to insult him.
He decided it was a good time to get off the dancefloor altogether, eyeing the crowd, trying to locate the rest of his friends as he did so. They had left for the dancefloor, leaving him the caretaker of their boot, at least a quarter of an hour ago.
It was how Draco’s thoughts on what to have for dinner, eventually ended up completely focussing on why again he shouldn’t take Harry up on his invitation. And where at first Draco’s conscious brain had been strong enough to inform his body of all the reasons why that was a bad idea, in the end it had to give in to the all-encompassing need to scratch his itch.
“Oh, I didn’t tell you yet,” Harry said, when his head had cleared a bit, flushing slightly as he remembered what exactly he’d been so distracted by the day before that he hadn’t told Draco this yet. “Terry Boot has put in a request for his sentence to be reduced. His lawyer has written me a letter. I’ve just told him I wouldn’t know what to say that could help. I think the man has just written to anyone who’s ever worked with Boot, because, really, I wouldn’t know why else he would have asked
When Harry woke, parched and with a pounding headache, he registered the heat of another body close to his immediately. He opened his eyes slowly, the grey morning light filtering through the curtains just enough to see Draco’s face. Draco’s eyes were still closed, long blond lashes to pale skin and Harry couldn’t help but notice how beautiful he looked in this state of complete relaxation.
Harry actually did remember, having thought that was a bit odd, but now it made complete sense and Harry felt overwhelmed by the implications of it all. Malfoy trusting Harry with something that must be so valuable to him almost felt like it meant something more, something important, even if it was Narcissa Malfoy’s birthday today.
And Harry started explaining, about the nightmares that had gotten worse and worse, so that Corentin was now working under a one-sided silencing spell to make sure no one else heard. And about Corentin telling him it would get better, that it was only a matter of time before he would find the right counter-spell.
“Yes, the curse was aimed at me, but he-.” Harry stopped, couldn’t actually say it. The Healer seemed to get him anyway, though.
“Yes, but I er-, I don’t want to take it just yet. I still have some stuff at your suite and I-. Is it okay if I come back with you for now?” Harry just answered.
Well, at least he tried to, before Harry caught his arm. There was no fucking way Draco was running out on him now. “Don’t.” His voice held an urgency that made Draco look at him again.
Draco could only groan. “Really, that whole explanation isn’t even grammatically correct. Besides dragons
At first Harry had thought that if Ron had been able learn he would be, too. So, that’s when he and Draco had started practicing together. Extensively. Draco had been a good and patient, well, mostly anyway, teacher and Harry had thought he would be able to pull this off. Until the actual ball came closer, that was, and therefore also the moment they would actually have to do it. The dancing. It had made him more uncertain every time he’d practiced.
It had been very early that Monday morning, when they’d been alerted to the break-in. Harry and Terry Boot - his replacement Auror partner, because Ron was on honeymoon in Australia - had been assigned to patrol Diagon Alley and its surroundings for the night, keeping an extra eye on Slug’s and Jiggers Apothecary.
Draco hadn’t actually realised Harry had hated it, but now he thought about it, it kind of made sense: it probably wasn’t the nicest thing to spend almost all your time off on someone else’s flat.
“Could we go somewhere sometime? Dinner perhaps?” Harry now blurted, still looking rather stunned. It sounded like he’d been toying with the idea for a while already, but had only now divulged it, perhaps not even willingly. Now that Harry had spilled it, he was obviously following through, though, asking: “Tomorrow evening?”
“That would be me,” Draco couldn’t miss how much he was slurring. Okay, some part of his still conscious self whispered that this probably had been a very bad idea, but Draco shoved that part resolutely aside. He just knew he wanted to be here, with Harry.
“Good.” There was a silence for a beat, then Malfoy asked, smiling almost slyly all of a sudden: “So did I hear you say that you’re off tomorrow morning?” Harry nodded, not entirely sure where this could be going.
Harry considered him for a moment. “I won’t, not unless I really have to,” he said. He had to admit that he didn’t know whether Draco would be safe at St Mungo’s, either, and asking the Aurors to guard him there, would probably just end in a discussion about taking Draco into custody again.
And then Draco had suddenly and quite unequivocally left. Harry had followed him outside as soon as he’d seen - startling Oliver and his friends out of their good mood - but to no avail. Draco had already apparated out.
He was still sort of working on that last one, actually. Certainly, he’d had dates, with both men and women, but none of those had really worked. For some reason they  always tended to end up being about him - about
Harry must involuntarily have pulled a face at that, because Malfoy answered a question Harry hadn’t asked. “I didn’t think so, that’s why I didn’t require you to accompany me today. Besides it was a Muggle event, so I imagine I really wasn’t at risk at all. Hence the suit, though.”
When Blaise eventually replied it was slow, as if he was considering every word. “You need to understand, after the war-. Well, people hardly took kindly to Draco.”
Draco just closed his eyes for a moment. Harry hadn’t even wanted to look at him earlier yesterday evening: he would never have taken him home if he’d actually had any say in the matter, if Draco hadn't been so bloody boozed-up he couldn’t actually stand up straight anymore, let alone Floo home.
Harry looked him over again. “Yeah, I figured. Your erm-, your hair’s still wet.” He reached out, as if he wanted to touch it, but apparently decided against it in the end, rather abruptly walking to where he knew the living room was situated.
His touch was light, gentle and the air around them felt charged all of a sudden, going thick and almost stifling in a heartbeat. “It’s a pity I don’t really remember seeing them. It must have been quite the sight.” Harry’s voice was as thick as the air around them, filled with something that Draco’s whole body responded to without thinking.
So that’s what Harry did. He let his instincts take over, this time following Draco’s lead, though. And all of a sudden dancing wasn’t hard work: it was okay, easy almost, and although Harry knew he probably didn’t even come close to Astoria’s natural grace, he found he didn’t really care anymore. He was with Draco and that was all that mattered.
“Heading back to our drinks?” Right, the puzzle as to where Ron had gone had just been solved as Ron was apparently standing next to Harry now, his face looking a colour that tried very hard to compete with the colour of his hair. It really
“Always so formal.” The woman smiled at Malfoy, obviously having forgiven him already. “Would you like some tea, you and your strapping friend? There’s zulbia.”
“We’re going out to dinner,” Astoria just stated next, making Draco feel even worse about himself: Astoria didn’t usually make these sorts of decisions without acknowledging him in the process: he must look absolutely atrocious.
One ill-considered kiss wasn’t going to change that. He wouldn’t let it. Furthermore he’d made his resolve not to chicken out this time and he’d keep it.
Harry had helped Draco take his robes off and now ushered him to what Draco hazily recognised as one of the many spare bedrooms Harry’s house had. It was the room he used the most, the one opposite Harry’s own bedroom.
So Draco wasn’t offended by Harry’s evasive manoeuvre, knowing exactly what it meant. And how flattering it actually was.
“Nice work!” Zabini came up to Harry and Draco. “Although I don’t think this actually qualified as recon: I presume we’ve effectively wiped out what I think was probably most of the Cartel.”
“He-, I don’t know really. He was cursed, but I don’t remember the exact spell. So you must be Corentin Didier?” The Healer just nodded and Harry quickly introduced himself, not wanting to waste too much time, but not wanting to be rude either.
The next morning Draco woke up to the movement of Harry getting out of bed and he found himself standing up straight away, a jolt of pain shooting through his spine because his back hadn’t particularly enjoyed the experience of sleeping on the chair. He ignored it.
Draco had hoped this new development, them finding the five objects, would make the work on the house more interesting, but once they’d elaborately discussed how they were going to tackle dismantling the dark wards, it appeared to be just as long long-winded and dull as the rest of what they needed to do here. It wasn't particularly challenging, just a lot of work.
So Harry kissed him again: Draco had to know he meant it, all of it, especially now, now nothing was certain, now they didn’t even know how they were going to get out of this.
“Yeah, if you’d like to go,” Harry smiled, already knowing Malfoy’s answer. “Anything I should or shouldn’t wear?” Harry made it sound like a joke of sorts, but he also vividly remembered the whole clothing thing in the club they’d been to yesterday.
Harry just smiled brightly. “I really don’t mind,” he said it like he meant it. “But I would need your spare key, though.” It sounded like a practical observation, nothing more.
“Potter? Do you mind? You know, since you don’t dance?” The question startled Harry a bit, its tone sure, but slightly teasing. It came from Blaise Zabini, who had apparently made his way towards Ginny and now watched Harry, eyebrows raised in an obvious question.
“No, I’m not.” In different circumstances Malfoy’s answer could have been funny, but now his voice had a clipped quality to it that really didn’t bode well. “So leave.”
“Is his position compromised?” Zabini obviously shared the concern Harry hadn’t actually allowed himself to think about yet.
. Potter was kissing him willingly and it was all-encompassing, the club around them falling away as their lips met in a kiss that turned from desperate to deep and hungry withing seconds.
Draco had spent some time looking for accessories, but he hadn’t managed to find anything to his taste. So he’d left for his still empty flat.
Okay, well, put like that it actually did make some kind of sense: Harry really didn’t feel like voluntarily visiting Narcissa Malfoy, even if he did admire her for saving him in the Forbidden Forest all those years ago, but he also felt like he needed to make an effort here. “We could, though. I think you should be there on her birthday,“ adding, rather lamely, even to his own ears: “It’ll be no problem if we’re back later tonight. I don’t have to be anywhere tomorrow morning anyway: tomorrow and Saturday morning I’m off.” For some elusive reason Harry didn’t want Malfoy to feel guilty.
friends. It made Harry happy and proud, proud of his friends who had accepted Draco with minimal fuss, their reactions ranging from Hermione’s ‘Harry, you do realise you’ve been obsessed with Draco since sixth year, don’t you?’ and Luna’s ‘Draco’s quite sweet, really. I think you two make a really lovely couple.’ to Ron’s ‘Don’t ask me to like the git yet, but if he makes you happy, that’s enough for me.’
Potter at least had the good grace to blush a bit, before answering. “I know. I just wanted Harris to have the book.” Draco must have looked exactly as incredulous as he felt, because Potter added: “If I’d wanted to have a look at your teaching again, I’d have been here earlier.”
The realisation hit him hard. How the hell hadn’t he seen this coming? Why hadn’t he noticed that just being friends with Harry wasn’t nearly enough anymore.
When Harry bent down to coax Draco into another long kiss full of promise, Draco wasn’t at all surprised. With anyone else it would have been quite embarrassing how little coaxing he’d actually needed.
Hermione just nodded, though, producing an empty vial, which in her line of business would probably be pretty standard for her to carry.
It had meant he hadn’t encountered Harry at all over the past year and, honestly, it had been harder than he’d imagined. For some reason Draco had missed Harry more than he was ready to admit, so when the opportunity had presented itself the choice had been easy.
It was completely absurd, of course, and Draco blamed it on not having seen anyone else all weekend. Blaise had sent him an owl, but somehow Draco hadn’t felt up to contacting him, not feeling inclined to share his current situation with Blaise yet. Instead he had been caught between wanting to be left alone and a deep-seated desire to be with Harry. The latter of which he had quite valiantly resisted.
Draco followed, feeling slightly awkward, but so fucking grateful for Harry being there it was probably far beyond pathetic.
The physical she performed was exceptionally quick, the intern blushing through all of it: the humps on Draco’s back were still there, nothing else.
“And, just so you know, I don’t think there are essay titles that are longer than this,” Harry said playfully and just the slightest bit offended, when he looked up from his letter again.
“Yeah, sometimes. I’ve been trying to tell them that in reality it just doesn’t always work that way, that sometimes you have to make a different decision, but they just tell me that while practicing I need to follow the rules.”
Draco started to read, but he didn’t really get very far, waking up to the flare of the Floo in the room coming to life. Honestly, he should stop doing that: falling asleep whenever Potter left him.
hurt quite a bit. Still he’d spent almost a whole day at St Mungo’s, waiting, only to eventually be helped by an intern who had just looked at him without much sympathy before relieving the spell damage with a flick of his wand and sending him off again.
Draco wanted this to be perfect more than anything. If he wasn’t going to see Harry regularly anymore, he wanted to make this something he could remember, something he could hold on to.
Blaise sighed. “Let’s just say no one wants to be associated with damaged goods. And the Malfoy’s were-. Well-.”
When he’d eventually found the courage to open them anyway, though, it was to a room he didn’t recognise.
Harry wanted to say something about Malfoy not having been used to doing things himself and bruising easily, what with that incredibly pale skin of his and all, but Harry found he didn’t really believe that himself. So he just didn’t say it, taking a sip of tea instead.
“You could just go there and talk to him.” It was unmistakably Luna’s light voice, although Draco hadn’t noticed her approaching.
After his shift had ended Draco had gone to Harry’s room again, for the umpteenth time, just to see how Harry was. He had been asleep, as was to be expected after a hit like that. He looked peaceful. And stunningly attractive, of course.
