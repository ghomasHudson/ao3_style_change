‘You don’t know I was going to say that!’
His new shoes pinched his feet as he half ran towards the apparition point.
A tapping at the window alerted him to the tiny tawny owl his friends had given him last year. The tiny owl was carrying a parcel in its mouth three times the size itself and was tottering on the edge of the window sill. He rushed to let her in, and she hopped regally through then promptly elegantly fell into his potted plant. A genuine smile, a laugh and the indignant chirps of the tiny bird as he brushed her off, filled his small apartment and pushed away the cold damp and the squeaking pipes for a few minutes. With a small affectionate peck, the bird hopped out of his hands and into the tank she shared with Trevor the toad. The owl was born blind, which Neville had worked out when she had squealed in surprise as the smooth pebble she thought she was sitting on turned out to be a bemused (strangely old) toad. It wasn’t surprising that the shop had never worked out she was blind, she easily navigated her surroundings relying on her hearing and touch. Neville wasn’t sure how she managed to deliver and send letters. Hermione said that wizarding owls were different from muggle owls and used the magical ley lines that crisscrossed the country to navigate. She told him it was a little like homing pigeons but at Neville’s blank look she had given up trying to explain.

'Don't get me wrong I do want to find someone but-'
Longbottom  Manor
There was one time where he had told them who he liked. Just once. They were all teasing Ron for his infatuation with giggly Lavender and for once everyone was safe and no one was fighting. Seamus ribbed Harry about Ginny and he turned a startling red. Ron gave a menacing look at Seamus that quickly stopped him and sent the rest of them into a laughing fit.
'Go on! shake your head it’ll make you feel better. Shake away the impure thoughts,’ Luna giggled. She lifted her arms like a fortune tellers flowing scarves and waved them towards him.
“YOU BASTARD HOW COULD YOU LEAVE.’ a loud shout interrupted his thoughts and he looked down at himself as if waking from a dream. Neville took his hand out of the floopowder dish and went upstairs to investigate what the hell was going on.
The doorknob was cold under his hands as he pushed the door open, letting a breeze of cold air into the house and making goosebumps appear on his bare arms. Hugging his arms to his body, Neville wandered down the front path to see what was going on. A group of shadowy figures stood a little way off down the street but Harry’s shouting could probably be heard by the whole neighbourhood. One of the figures turned towards him, the way he held himself and the cut of his outdated ill-fitting jacket seemed familiar and caused a peculiar ache in his chest. Suddenly Neville felt very tired and felt the urge to cry, to run to this stranger and let him take care of him. Neville turned around and left, his heart thumping so loudly he thought it would scare the pigeon that was perched, looking pissed off, on a coil of barbed wire on top of a friendly looking wall. Neville couldn’t understand what was happening to him. Something about the distant figure had made him feel like he was 13 again. (A memory: a long sallow face wreathed in a hat smothered with vulture feathers) A realisation that muddled it’s way through his foggy brain: Neville couldn’t remember the last time he cried. 13 year old Neville, with his red ringed eyes and nervous disposition had never felt so far away. Neville was too tipsy to apparate and too confused to turn back and take the floo. Maybe the bracing air on his walk home would sober him up? Neville hated being drunk.
They finished setting up a makeshift camp when the sun was already touching the sea. They dug a hole in the ground and surrounded it with stones, filling it with twigs and dried leaves so that they could set fire at night. They left the opening through which they would enter the side of the "cabin", to prevent animals and the cold wind from hitting them directly.
Regulus looked disappointed and sighed, nodding and coming back to his toys. Padma bowed to him as he was leaving, and Lavender followed him to their bedroom, where Draco was.
Harry opened his eyes, which burned with the light, and tried to rise from where he was, spitting sand from his mouth. Apart from the side effects of using a portkey, Harry wasn't hurt. He sat, watching Malfoy rummaging through something in his hands, sitting on a rock. They were definitely on a beach. On one side was the sea, immense, blue and clear, the sky equally blue and clear. The sand was white, soft and warm. On the other side stood a virgin forest, coconut palms, and trees lost in sight.
Harry came back to the present when the first Gryffindor student was sorted, and the people around him cheered. He started clapping before he knew what was going on, stretching his neck so he could see the small kid coming to the table. It was the smallest eleven-year-old girl Harry had ever seen. She had brown, fine hair and soft brown eyes, and she was shy when she sat at the table.
Aware now of the danger in his own home, Harry approached Draco, whispering in his ear.
After that, McGonagall stood behind the teacher’s table, in front of the headmistress chair, and cast a
“We won’t tell them if you don’t.”
If there was one thing that Harry knew was most damaging to someone's mind, it was leaving it empty. The thoughts came like a storm, destroying their willpower and joy.
We stared at each other for a heartbeat, and then I heard myself asking:
On the second day, with a plaster on his cheek, Draco tried to spell it away with every single spell he knew. Harry tried to cut it out by force, and after a few tried, he too had a cut on his face.
* - * - *
“And the least bad one?”
“We’re going! Right, Harry?” Draco looked down at him, beaming, and Harry physically felt summer taking over the office.
“A boat.”
Harry retrieved the little car, putting it aside and getting for the picture. Mark fixed them as he wanted, and then proceeded to go to the camera, so he could take their picture. Harry could hear Cygnus chomping down on his sweets, and as Mark clicked the button that fired off the camera, Cygnus screamed so loud it made Castor cry, then made gagging sounds, spitting whatever was in his mouth all over his little robes.
Harry was feeling the same way. Every now and then, he’d come back and look at them, mesmerised by their little pink noses and chubby cheeks. They’ve decided to wait a day before showing their babies to the pack. They were the lead alpha’s babies, after all, and they needed to be presented to society.
“You too... The more I fuck you, the more I want to.”
“Pregnancy cravings are real! Everything tastes better when my mind asks me for it!” Hermione said, and Ron laughed, looking at his wife like she was everything in his world.
“And, you don’t need to worry, Mr Potter. I’m sure Mr Malfoy here can help you with the theatricals,” Flitwick said, and although me and Malfoy tried to slither out of it, professor Flitwick ignored us completely.
“So, you, hn?” Weasley said by an introduction, and Hermione chuckled.
“It makes sense, I guess. No one would try to punch him in his pointy face if you’re there. Not even us.”
“Give her to me, Harry. I want her with me.” Dracy said, the manic look still in his eyes. Harry didn't like that look, but he handed the baby over anyway.
Draco turned around when he heard Harry coming, carrying oysters in the bag made with his cloak. In his hands, he carried one of the pots full of salt water. He put everything on the floor next to the fire pit and started making the fire.
was going to put you on check, and it didn’t. I’d expect this type of attitude from Mr Weasley, maybe, but from you…”
“Yes?”
“Using only your hands. Relax. We don't need to be in a hurry. Go bathe and then we'll have some eggs. I found an abandoned nest and I'm really missing something other than fish.” Draco said, and Harry laughed, starting to take off his pants and head for the pond in the middle of the clearing.
Harry to see him. He even stopped putting on his pants inside the bathroom, walking into their shared bedroom in the nude. Harry always looked away, but it was difficult doing so, especially when he started having wet dreams starred by Draco and his amazing bubble butt.
“My baby sister was just born, my papa can’t really take care of her alone and Christmas will be a big affair with the baby’s arrival and all. He needs me there, sir.”
He talked to Melinda for a couple of seconds and nodded to Flitwick. He waited for her clue as she started playing a song I didn’t know, and the sound that flew out his mouth was absolutely…
I was being low profile this year, trying not to be noticed and trying not to get in trouble. If I wanted a job after Hogwarts, I needed E’s in almost everything to manage any kind of job, even as a salesperson. I couldn’t go back to the Manor, my parents were in France and I was basically alone and moneyless after I left Hogwarts. So I breathed in, held the need to punch Potter in the face, and focused on the rehearsal.
“Then have me… All of me,” Draco said, stepping back from Harry and removing his jumper, revealing a white tee underneath. He then removed it too, the chill of the night making his pores stand up and his pink nipples harden, the snake necklace resting in the middle of his chest.
When Harry awoke, the sun had just risen, apparently. The weather was a little chilly, the drizzle of the night keeping the earth a little damp, the sea breeze and the smell making everything colder. Draco was sleeping fully in his arms, his own arms around Harry, and Harry smiled, letting himself stay like that for a few minutes longer while he considered what to do.
“I want to suck you off. You have the hottest body I’ve ever seen… And fuck, you have a monster cock. I want it all shoved inside me.”
thing. Well, mine and Pansy’s and Zabini’s thing, but it didn’t have the three people in the world that I didn’t want to see. This was my safe haven and that stupid black haired git just waltzed in like he owned the place.
When Harry got Draco’s memo asking him to go to his office, it wasn’t really a surprise. Draco used to say that, in order to be an amazing curse-breaker, one had to understand magical theory as if it was their own soul and mind. And it might just be true because Draco was the best curse-breaker of the whole department since he and Harry had been partnered together two years ago. With this said, it was also true he was prone to… Accidents. Draco loved to test new spells and charms, and while they had so far never really harmed anyone, sometimes Draco’s magic did have consequences he wasn’t happy with, so Harry was called to help him with those situations.
“Potter, you’re awful,” Draco laughed, and as he tucked himself again, he heard a loud cry that showed that Lily was probably awake. “Since you’re the one who wants more of these, you get to change her now and see if you still have the same ideas when you come back.
The little boy struggled out of Harry’s arms, screaming and kicking, and Harry tried to hold him as best as he could.
“Yes, mango! Delicious! Yum!” Harry licked his lips and rubbed his stomach to illustrate, making Talitha laugh. He did not expect Talitha to raise a hand to the fruit and, concentrating as hard as she could, she made the fruit drop from its branch and float towards them.
“You’re my best friend, Harry.”
That day when he saw Draco smile, however, it was when he had a spark of hope that eventually things would be okay. The night before, they had forgotten a papaya near the fire. When they woke up in the morning, there was a mother monkey with her baby eating the papaya. Her baby was clinging to her neck while she ate and eventually raised a hand with a piece of fruit to stick in the little monkey's mouth.
“Good evening, Harry. Welcome home,” Draco said, raising his head so Harry could kiss him softly in the lips. “Did you have a good day?”
Harry laughed, and Draco laughed with him.
Entering Draco’s office was like entering another dimension.
“What are you talking about?” Hermione asked, looking a bit irritated. She hated when we knew something and she didn’t. Ron turned to her, over excited.
“I’m Draco Malfoy, and I’m a self-published writer. Not multimillionaire, but, you know, I make decent money. My family comes from money, though. My mother and my father, I mean. I don’t have a big family.”
“It’s okay to be nervous. I get nervous too. But remember you’re not the most important person in the play: Lovegood and Blaise are. People will mostly be looking at them, especially because they will be dancing and it’s going to be emotional. Me and you are there to complement them.
suffered because of me.”
“Hey, guys! We’re having an early tea today! Would you want to come over?” Ellie, the Department of Secret’s secretary spoke from the door, not even fucking knocking before interrupting them.
I'm sorry I took so long! I'm trying to write an original book at the same time I'm writing this story. I hope you can all understand.
“Really, Potter? I thought you knew better than mingling with Death Eaters,” the boy asked, and Harry thought his name was Eaton, from 7th year.
Roberto's body was lying near one of those bushes. Lucy ran to him, bending down and checking his vital signs with her fingers on his neck. Then she put her ear to his chest, and tested his breathing again.
“Are you sure he doesn’t need me?” Harry asked the Midwife’s helper when she left the room with a bowl and lots of towels inside, red tinted with blood. Harry felt like he was going to lose conscience.
“Magical Theory and Advanced Potions. And you have Advanced Defense Against Dark Arts and Muggle History, which I don’t. But they don’t clash so we can be with each other anyway.” Draco said, putting on his tie while looking in the mirror.
Neville looked down at the battered watch that his grandmother had given to him a few years ago for his birthday. The scratched face was red and, in a strong black font read the words: VERY VERY LATE. He groaned and apparated to the ministry, praying she was in a good mood.
‘They’re
Neville was the only one without a pair and he felt left aside, abandoned. When telling Ginny this on the back door step of the burrow, she had passed him her fag and told him to stop wallowing in self pity. The bitter destructive side of him had wanted to crush the fag under his foot and walk off. But this was her form of reaching out, and besides, he wasn’t a main character, he couldn’t just get up and walk off whenever he wanted. Not like Harry, who had just stormed out of the room after Ron had made some obtuse comment about him and Malfoy. Pink flushing high on his cheeks, Malfoy fled the room like a scared cat and Hermione kicked Ron under the table. Their silent argument filled the air like fog, pressing down on his head and making him feel tired and heavy. But it was fine, they would be distracted soon enough, Harry was the main character so he’d be sure to have some sort of dramatic encounter outside and they’d be distracted from he way that Hermione and Ron’s teases were becoming less and less like fond jibes and more like underhand comments, spat through gritted teeth and angry eyes.
‘Ow, you fucker,’ a man said, now sitting on the floor after Neville had knocked him to the ground.
Luna grabbed his wrist.
‘Oh, you're a healer now? That great! Um, yeah im doing okay. You alright? Sorry it’s been so long.’
and left the room to investigate the shouting outside. Neville felt like something big had happened. He got the sudden urge to leave, to leave everyone behind and go somewhere, do something. Live in a place that wasn’t London, where the concrete made the plants scream and the trees were cut to ugly knobbly stumps so they wouldn’t spread over the stress. He wanted to go see the mountains, breathe fresh air. He wanted to see the stars again. His feet were leading him to the fire place and he reached for the floo powder. He could go home and from there, anywhere. His future was endless he could do anything-
Neville nodded and when it was clear he wasn’t going to say anything else the man punched his arm and grinned at him.
Sure enough, a shout of surprise from outside led the party out of the room. Neville stayed in his chair and leant back, letting his face relax from it's fixed smile. When he opened his eyes he jolted back in his chair. Luna was standing by the door, her arms stretching up above her head and touching the threshold. Her oddly shiny short muggle skirt had ridden up her thighs but Neville looked firmly at her eyes, blushing pink. She smiled sagely. “Don’t mope love, have the pixies gotten to you again?’
‘Well, I’ve got to go. But see you around, yeah?’
Reluctantly he shook his head until his hair was sticking up and Luna’s laughter spurred him on until it was wild. Their laughter pushed away the ickiness of Ron and Hermione's short, silent fight. Neville had crossed the room to stand in front of her. His arms reached out and gently touched her waist. It felt right so he began to lean in but Luna's hand on his chest stopped him.
‘Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, busy. But I’m alright.’
to want to but it felt wrong.
Neville nodded again, struck mute by this fleeting apparition from his past.
His cold beer had formed a little puddle of condensation on the table. Neville drew his fingers through it, making swirling patterns on the wood. Today he just wanted to watch. He was always watching, these days, waiting maybe for something to happen. His friends (there was still a part of his heart that sang when he thought that) were red-faced with drink and laughter. There were 6 of them, grouped around the table in the kitchen of 12 Grimmauld place. The usual lot for their friday dinner: Harry (obviously, it was his home), Luna , Ginny, Hermione and, surprisingly today, Draco Malfoy.
Augusta Longbottom
Neville watched Malfoy observe the group. His sharp eyes searched around desperately for social cues, the signal to laugh, or moan in sympathy, like a child sitting at the adults table for the first time, wanting to fit in with them. Neville wasn’t the only one watching him. Harry's eyes had barely left Malfoy since he had entered the room. They sat together, barely skimming shoulders, but Neville felt like a voyeur spying because it was so painfully intimate and fresh. Neville couldn’t blame Malfoy for leaning into him, everyone was. Harry was magnetic, electric, and everyone was pulled into him when he spoke. He consumed them, and they let him. Smiles became wider and lights shone more brightly over him, creating his own personal spotlight and audience. As usual, Neville's heart twisted nostalgically, a little in anger and a little in love for this great man. Neville hated the way that everyone, including himself loved Harry, so easily it was like breathing. Neville cringed at the memories of the painful crush he’d housed on Harry in second year. How Harry had been so oblivious of the way Neville's eyes tracked him everywhere they went. Neville never shared his crushes with his dorm mates. They found it so easy to share who they liked but Neville had always just blushed and shrugged no matter how hard they tried to guess who he liked. It wasn't that he didn't trust them, Neville just couldn't understand how anyone could share that part of themselves. The tender, embarrassing part that made you do stupid things to impress and was so, so easily hurt. When Neville had told Ginny about his old infatuation with Harry his cheeks had stained red and he had wanted to steal the words back, shove them deep down and never say them again. Ginny didn't understand his embarrassment.
‘-Now's not right for you.’
‘You don’t want this.’ she whispered
‘Yes I do.’ He whispered but he stood back.
He wanted them to tease him about it, be silly, and leave them alone together, in the same way they did to Ron and Lavender.
‘But you were, weren’t you.’ She said softly.
Luna had told him it was pixies living in his hair and stealing his confidence. She had spent an hour trying to pick them out and Neville had appreciated the head massage.  He looked at her now, she sat with a small knowing smile on the opposite side of the table, her eyes on the ceiling. Neville wondered what she was thinking, he wanted to reach for her pale hand resting on the table and take it and ask her. But he couldn’t do that now. He had thought after the war they could maybe be something. It only seemed right, with everyone pairing off and the war pushing them together.But Luna’s eyes tracked Ginny around rooms and often she stood like a shadow at her side, touching elbows or linking fingers, as if Ginny could keep her tethered to the ground.
‘Shake your head, they'll fly right off, promise,’ Luna said, shaking hers and making her hair fall in front of her eyes. Neville let out a bark of laughter.
He sat next to Harry at the end of the table, both of them a little apart from the rest of the group. He had hardly said a word after Hermione had barged into the kitchen 15 minutes late, dragging him in by his arm and pushing him none-too-gently into the seat next to Harry. Hermione had sat down a little pink, even she knew she was on the edge of meddling too much. It was Luna who first spoke up, raising her voice over Ron’s splutters of indignation. She smiled warmly at Malfoy and Neville had felt a jolt of anger, Luna was too nice to them. Malfoy ducked his head to avoid their stares and Neville found himself oddly satisfied at the guilt he saw in his cool grey eyes. It was his turn to feel pain. The group had welcomed him, somewhat reluctantly and with a few under-the-table kicks from Hermione, and they continued with their evening.
‘No you don’t,' she said, smiling.
‘Oh,’ Ron said.
I forgot about this. Also: I don't support Jk rowling or anything she stands for, I'm simply stealing her characters.
'It was in, like, second year. Everyone was obsessed with him, and besides, you were what? Twelve? That doesn't count.'
‘Nah, just. Tired,’ he smiled in a small way.
‘Im so sorry, I didn’t see you, should've been looking where I was going.’ Neville said, reaching out a hand to help him up.
‘Okay, okay I get it.’ Neville said, laughing.
Neville shook his head and stepped back.
And then the name was out, with the awkward accompaniment of ‘he’ rather than ‘she’, in the darkness and he wanted to steal it back. He screwed up his eyes and pushed his body back into his bed, wanting to disappear. A silence followed.
This made Neville frown.
Dear Neville,
Yours sincerely,
The reason that he had come home flew out of his head. Thoughts of adventure and romantic ideas about leaving it all behind had been quashed by dreaded responsibilities. A rushed dinner of beans on toast and then he fell into bed, praying to not have one of his famous hangovers.
Neville felt a small seed of dread plant itself in his stomach. His grandmother always wrote formal letters (apparently this meant she had excellent etiquette, the amount of times she had walked out of dinner parties said otherwise) but ‘yours sincerely’ meant she was pissed off with him. Underneath the letter was a pair of shiny black dragon leather shoes. They even smelled expensive. His grandmother had nagged him all last visit that he didn’t have an appropriate pair of shoes but this seemed overly excessive. He knew they were running a bit short at the moment, as well. That was another reason to add on his already worryingly long list of Things to Feel Guilty About. Underneath the pair of shoes was a pile of pamphlets, similar to the ones that Hermione had given him. He shoved them under the fridge and then felt even more guilty. Honestly he should just convert to being a Catholic at this point with all this guilt.
‘Well, no shit.’ the man said, in a laugh, letting Neville haul him up. Their eyes met and Neville was 16 and shy again, housing a painful crush on a Hufflepuff. There was a cringing moment where he thought he didn’t remember him but then - the man shook his hand and brought him in for a crushing hug. The younger him would have cried with joy.
“Papa?”
“Yeah, but we’re all dressed as penguins and we can’t even play outside. It sucks,” Sirius said, pointing to his own light green wizarding robes, finely pressed and made to perfection to fit his slim body.
Ron looked at the tapestry, not knowing what to say. Everything was getting more confusing, but more than ever, he was sure that Harry and Draco were alive ... And perhaps, more comfortable than Ron Weasley seemed to believe.
Somehow he bumped into something, and held the shape at his side instinctively. It was Malfoy. Out of sheer instinct, and perhaps years of training as an auror, Harry groaned an ‘ascendio’ underwater, almost like in his fourth year, and on the verge of despair, his magic reacted so hard that he was thrown out of the water, Malfoy in his arms.
“Sirius, Scorpius, Aries, Cygnus…” Harry counted the boys, all of them in the middle of their living room looking bored out of their lives. Sirius, their eight-year-old, was sitting down moving his feet, looking like he was about to commit murder with how bored he was. The boy had Harry’s dark complexion with Draco’s light eyes. Scorpius was their pale six and a half year old, who was currently trying to entertain five-year-old Aries and three-year-old Cygnus, both dark-haired with green eyes, with a game of toy aurors. He looked around, missing someone. “Where’s Castor?”
Other people had solos, too, one of them being Draco. If Harry hadn’t known the arsehole, he would’ve thought that Malfoy was an angel disguised as a wizard. His high voice was soft and angelic, and it was also fitting, especially when he tried on his outfit for the day, a white silky gown that flew as he moved. Maximillian was the narrator, and he had the last song of the show, a duet with Malfoy, each of them at one side of the room as Zabini and Luna met in the middle, finally the Sun and Moon together.
like us to be here?” Hermione asked, looking at me with her way too clever eyes.
They got in, and the room was small but cosy. It had a fireplace, a settee in front of it with a table on the corner along with two chairs. The decoration was sparse but was clearly made with Draco and he in mind. There were Slytherin and Gryffindor flags around the room and green and red pillows on the settee.
“If you’re trying to make me jealous it’s not working.” Harry replied amused.
He’d noticed something very odd though when he had been in the drawing room on Thursday and it was to do with the old Black family tapestry that he’d kept on the wall after the renovations. Obviously he already knew that Malfoy was on it and after spending so much time thinking about him this week his eye was drawn to his face. The face was the familiar face of his youth however under it his name no longer read Draco Malfoy. Now it very plainly said Draco Black.
Draco was standing behind him but probably closer than he needed to be. Harry left his hands drop and Draco carried on just gently patting his shoulders dry. He took a step forward and Harry could practically feel Draco’s breath on his skin making the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.
The Minister seemed to sense Draco’s moral dilemma.
“Honestly?” Draco said with a raised eyebrow.
“You know it doesn’t take a genius to work out where you live when you seemingly step out of a brick wall in between number 11 and number 13.” Blaise said dryly.
“Picture” Teddy repeated, perfectly concentrating hard.
He thought for another second and then stood up quickly finally springing into action. “You’ll have to tell me all the details later but now we need to leave. She’ll know. She’ll recognise my handwriting at the very least. I’m stupid for not thinking about that. She might be telling Lucius right now and we can’t predict what he’ll do. I don’t think he would rush straight round here. I think he’ll want time to form a proper plan and if he does come he’ll come when the shop is closed but we should get out of here now just in case.”
“I’ll tell you later. Need food and sleep and then I’ll tell you.” Draco said a bit more coherently and holding his own weight against his friend now, slowly pulling away from him.
“Harry is an excellent cook, Mother, and he always looks after me by bringing me snacks during the day.” Draco said fondly.
Then there was a knock at the front door.
“I did have an… arrangement with someone.” He started slowly as Draco turned to look at him seriously. “We definitely weren’t officially together or anything like that, it was more of a friends with benefits situation but I just thought you should be aware of it.”
Fred shrugged. “Verity will be fine in the shop for a bit I’m sure. George is just doing a stock check with Graham but it doesn’t really need two of them. Go on up and I’ll grab him.”
He knew Potter had been brought up by muggles but surely he would have gone away with them. He had money so surely they would too? Even the Weasley family had been to Egypt! Draco realised that he didn’t actually know anything about Potter’s upbringing though. A question for another night perhaps.
“I’d like it to be.” Harry said seriously.
“I’m leaving your father.” She said boldly at the sight of her son's tears. “I should have done it years ago, maybe life could have been different for us if I had but there’s no use looking back. You seem to be able to look to the future, as you should. You are young and you are immensely talented, you can have any future you want and you have inspired me to take mine while I still can.”
“You like the guy huh?!” George asked with a raised eyebrow.
Draco was once again struck by how nice he looked when he smiled. He’d never sat opposite Potter engaging in casual conversation like this and it was nice. Obviously there was no way the man would be this relaxed and this friendly if he knew who he was really talking to.
Harry gave Draco a gentle nudge with his foot so that he looked up and he could see into his eyes. “I like everything about you too.” He said, smiling broadly not able to keep his happiness at Draco’s words hidden.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Draco said bewildered.
“I’ve managed to persuade Blaise to take Fred to the wedding as his plus one.” Daphne said looking at Harry the whole time. “I thought it might be nice for George to have him there. He’s my plus one of course but I shall be occupied with bridesmaid duties for a portion of the day, particularly early on and it is a bit overwhelming for my little George to meet all of my family at once I do feel rather sorry for him so hopefully Blaise and Fred will look after him for me.” She said turning to Blaise and giving him a smile.
Harry’s smile faltered for a split second but Draco looked at him and tried to say everything he couldn’t say his words with his eyes and Harry seemed to understand him perfectly. He grinned and leaned down to press a kiss to Draco’s forehead but just before he did he whispered “I really want you to stay here in our home.”
“Yes boss.” Harry smiled.
“So, erm, you’re OK with it?” Harry said, running his hand through his hair nervously.
Draco considered that for a moment. Would Harry have wanted anyone else there? Would he rather be with Granger and Weasley? Was he really just organising this so that Draco could be there? He wouldn’t do that would he? Although he had to admit that it did seem like Harry really wanted to be friends with him. Daphne clearly wants them to be friends although he wasn’t really sure why. He also thought there was something he was missing about the Weasley twins. Blaise had given Daphne a bit of a look when she mentioned them and he knew those two told each other everything.
Draco frowned again. “Harry, that’s already been established-” He started in a slightly confused note and then stopped himself as he remembered something. “Oh, I’d forgotten, I said- on Sunday… I said I wanted nothing to do with it…” He trailed off awkwardly.
“Fuck Harry… you are…” Draco trailed off not knowing how to describe how he felt looking at Harry but Harry didn’t mind, he didn’t need words. The look in Draco’s eyes was enough.
Molly started serving dinner and everyone was tucking in when Charlie addressed Harry from across the table.
Fred shook his head but motioned towards Harry who was still trying. Draco still didn’t know what to do. Why was he so useless? Why could he not think? Harry stopped what he was doing and stepped forward to address the group.
Draco smiled as he looked down at their intertwined hands. “No, it doesn’t. I’m not sure why but you’ve always been the exception to my rules Potter.” Then he felt his chest tighten ever so slightly. “It- it might crop up though, on occasion, as we… progress. Just something to be aware of.”
Tibault looked surprised to see him but smiled. “Oh. Salut Capitaine!”
“Well it seems that we’ve established a bit of a routine already where we can’t sleep to sleep without getting each other off first. I assumed that might continue.” Draco said in a matter of fact tone as if merely discussing the weather.
“It’s lovely to meet you too, please call me Daphne, after all we’re all friends here.” She spoke in a warm playful tone as George straightened back up. “And I’m glad to hear Harry has been talking me up but you should hear what he was saying about you! I’m afraid he has given you a lot to live up to George, I was a bit worried he wanted you for himself!”
“Yeah well, change of plan.” Malfoy said not in the least bit bothered by the information this woman had revealed. “I bumped into… an old acquaintance and he very much needs to get drunk so I brought him here.” He said gesturing towards Harry.
Daphne seemed to read his mind and she reached over the table to give Harry’s hand a gentle squeeze. She didn’t linger though and spoke again as she withdrew her hand.
Leo got quite awkward when he said that he would have to read all of his correspondence but Draco didn’t really see why, he had expected it. It was then that the auror had claimed that he didn’t want Draco to think that he didn’t trust him because he absolutely did, he was just doing his job and that was what had got Draco confusingly angry. Trust?! Leo’s confession had rather startled him. How could this man trust him? They barely knew each other. Foolish Gryffindor, thought Draco.  He had never had anyone so openly trust him and it unnerved him. Draco didn’t even trust himself and he certainly wouldn’t trust him if he was in Leo’s position.
Harry thought for a moment before he sat up slowly against the bedhead and looked down at his lover. “Draco you do realise that you can never be just like anyone else to me. You don’t need to worry about that… about competing or anything.”
For the second time that morning Harry was over in a flash sitting on the edge of the armchair, not thinking about what he was doing just acting on instinct as he so often did.
“They’ll get over it.” Draco said, continuing determinedly to their destination.
“No they don’t.” Harry agreed as they stood on the landing.
I know the whole 'Harry giving back Draco's wand and then speaking at his trial' thing has kind of been done to death but I always like seeing people's different interpretations on it so hope you like mine. I wanted to write the trial in full and not just gloss over it. Also I do think there are some differences with this story coming up.
Work got in the way but that it's picking back up again for me.
“I see. We will of course be searching the shop in question and taking into custody the shop owners themselves if they indeed cooperated with this. Now would you care to explain why you let Death Eaters into the castle and how Albus Dumbledore died?” The Minister said in such a direct manner that Draco found himself stunned once again.
“Oh Draco you’re so cute right now.” Blaise teased.
Draco watched as Harry took a deep breath and then started talking. “I know money is a sensitive issue and I really don’t want it to come between us. I completely respect how you feel and I would never just give you money as I know you would see it as charity. I get that, Ron used to tell me the same thing but I ran this idea past Blaise and he seemed to think it was a good one.”
Fuck! He thought he’d forgotten all about the way Potter had once made him feel. It had just been a stupid crush on the boy who had been the focus of his school life in one way or another, it hadn’t meant anything and it definitely didn’t mean anything now, he told himself. It was just Potter getting to him like he always did. He told himself when he came to England that he would just be celibate. He knew he couldn’t marry a woman and told himself that no man would have him anyway even if he was free to be openly gay now. Casual sex got old pretty fast when he was in France, it was ok, some of it had even been good but he’d never really found someone who lit his world on fire.
“Hi.” He said simply still not sure what to call him.
“You need to get to know Harry, sure, but he needs to know you too.” She explained. “Last time you wore a typical outfit for you so now show him something different. It will intrigue him, it will make him think that there is more to you than he thought and he’ll want to get to know you even more than he already does. You also need to show him that you’ve changed because you have and for the better. The casual muggle clothes will appeal to Harry and make him think that this is a version of you that he can relate to.”
“Well, I think your father’s concerns are valid and, as a father of a very beautiful little girl, I would die and kill to protect her of everything in the world,” Harry said, and the old Alpha smiled, noticing that his Alpha leader knew what he was going through. “However, I do know that one day this little girl is going to grow up, and that I will have to let her do with her life what she wishes, and my job will be to advise her not to do any mistakes, and hold her when she
After they defeated all the seasons except summer, they decided to put Draco’s things back into his office. It was quick since they could do it with their wands, but Harry felt a bit bad for being by himself on his office again.
“I want you to fuck me like a woman, Harry.”
Against my better judgement, I said yes.
“You think I can find more information about my family if I find the states?”
I sat beside him, crossing my legs and looking at Potter from the side. I couldn’t help but think how handsome he was, with his jet black hair, long black lashes, tanned skin, full lips. I controlled the urge to touch him, because I knew once I did, I was going to be miserable. My heats were already bad enough, and for the past month, the one I had after scenting Potter was crazy. I could only think about him. Of course nobody teased me for using spells on my bed. I was the only omega in my dorm, and it wasn’t all that weird that I closed the curtains and silenced myself once a month, I’ve done this before. I was just glad they didn’t hear me chanting Potter’s name while I fingered myself.
The days followed in a stable routine. In the morning, they woke up, ate and went to the clearing to continue building the cabin. It was a slow process, which depended a lot on their patience and strength. While working, Harry was solely responsible for building the cabin and treating the fish before it was cooked. Draco was responsible for finding fruits and roots, as well as catching fish from puddles on the beach corals. Every day they wrote down the current day on the calendar stone, trying their best not to get lost. It was one of the first things they did in the morning, almost ritualistically.
“Draco... It's not your fault. I was there when we had sex, I should have known too.” Harry kissed him in the middle of his forehead, hugging him even tighter. “And if you are really expecting a baby, I will love and care for you and the baby with all my heart.”
“What do you mean?” Harry frowned harder. He didn’t really want to be anyone’s nanny, but he couldn’t help but understand why she picked him. Harry knew any other person would most likely not care enough or do him harm, or not be taken seriously.
, and he couldn’t be bothered right now, when Draco was bobbing his head, with his eyes closed and such a perfect expression on his face, like he was
“Fuck me, Harry…” She moaned softly, her hands pulling him by the arms, thumbs pressing against his protruding muscles.
“Mr Donahue, it’s your turn.” Flitwick called, and Maximillian got up, feeling a bit nervous. He walked to the front stage, but instead of preparing himself for his solo, and whispered something in Flitwick’s ear.
“Fuck. That was good,” Harry said, moving to his side and bringing Draco with him, hugging him from behind. Harry moved around, his arm reaching underneath him, and he pulled Draco’s phone, giving it back. Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
That party lasted for two years. At least it was how I felt throughout it, although it must’ve taken a few hours at most. Soon, my maid came at me, saying that I had to prepare for my consummation night. I followed Pansy out of the palace, because of course I still had to travel all the way to the Solar Castle.
Yeah, I knew. Ron was being Mr Perfect together with Hermione. I felt like there was a canyon between our friendships these days. Since I broke up with Ginny, I was feeling more and more miserable every time I saw Ron and Hermione together, and I knew it didn’t make sense. They were my friends and we’ve been through hell beside each other. I should’ve been more supportive of them, but I just felt bad about myself.
“But we are. And you’ve made me so much better. I’m sorry that I was a complete prick when we were teens… I…”
Harry put on his Gryffindor tie, socks and shoes, and tried to somewhat comb his hair. He didn’t like the look of it combed, so he messed it up with his fingers and pushed it to one side. It fell in unruly curls to his chin and Harry smiled, feeling kind of sexy like that. He put on his glasses and his Hogwarts robes and sat on his bed, waiting for Draco.
“Oh, well, we have matching birthmarks,” Draco said, feeling his face heat up a bit.
Draco smiled, feeling that pleasure coil in his lower belly. After they got married about a year ago, Harry confessed he had a kink after a couple of firewhisky cups. That surprised Draco because Harry was the most vanilla lover he had ever had. It didn’t mean they had bad sex, no. Harry was a thoughtful lover and Draco had never come so hard before he was in Harry’s hands. However, other than the regular positions one would fuck in, Harry wasn’t really into pain play or dominance or binding him, like other guys Draco had sex in the past did. No, Harry
Apparently, I was mistaken.
“It’s okay. I don’t plan on leaving for the rest of the day. I ate on McGonnagal’s office and all my books and belongings are here.” Malfoy said, opening his trunk and starting to sort his things into his side of the wardrobe. He didn’t have much, not from what Harry could see. There was some sort of sadness in his words, but Harry didn’t want to impose. So he said ‘see you soon’ and left for the Gryffindor tower, where he supposed his friends would have gathered.
“Draco, can you come here?” Harry asked after Draco put on his pyjama shirt, and Draco nodded, jumping on their bed and making it bounce. Harry laughed, hugging his husband and kissing his smiling lips.
why your potion turned out good!” Hermione looked at him and if betrayed, and Ron just smiled.
“Hnn… Cleaning and loosening spell,” Draco clarified, then reached for Harry’s hand, murmuring a lubricating spell. Harry’s hand got sticky with clear fluid, and Draco guided his hand to his own arsehole. “Finger me open, Harry. I want to take your huge cock inside me, all of it.”
The next months of training were hard, but also amazing. It was awesome to be flying again, and Harry missed the school competition so much. Although he wasn’t seeing it, Draco was talking to him about the Slytherin training and it looked great too. It was amazing to see Draco smile as if he was really happy, see the colour in his cheek and the shine in his eyes.
I literally couldn’t move, and my brain was screaming at me that it was my turn, I had to go up there and sing! My blood seemingly stopped flowing, and I felt lightheaded. I was going to faint, and everybody in the damn school was looking at me.
Draco was silent for a while before he said anything.
On that particular day, they were picking fruit for Talitha's birthday. She was finally turning one, and considering that the circumstances of her birth were not the best, Dracy and Harry decided that she should have a special day. They could not make a cake, as they would have done two years ago if they had been in their normal lives, but they would choose her favorite fruits and sing on her special day.
“You haven’t said what you wanted yet.”
“Now I’ll have to show you all my gay romances too. You’re fucked, Potter.”
Dracy smiled even more, hugging Harry by the shoulders and sighing.
“They are... bonded,” Ron muttered, looking even more confused. “How... How can it be? I mean... How do you bond while you’re missing? I didn't even... I didn't even know Harry was…”
“It’s just a picture, love. It’s just a picture. We’ll be fine,” Harry said, and as he smiled so Mark could take the photo, he heard Sirius say ‘oops’ at his side.
Draco nodded and followed him through a corridor on the left side of the living room. Harry opened the third door, showing him a simple room with a double bed, covered with clean white sheets. Across the bed, he spied a small dresser and a mirror. There was a toasty radiator near the bed, and beside the beige carpet and white curtains, the room was bare.
“I thought you were the straightest straight from the Ministry,” The Unspeakable's tone was light, as if there was a smile on his mouth. Harry turned to him, and realised that yes, he was laughing a little.
“Take a picture and show me,” Draco said, and Harry chuckled.
Harry was supposed to be alone, and he managed to defend himself very well, with Malfoy's help, from the ten or so attackers who cast spells on them. He listened as Malfoy lost his wand, the attackers surrounding them in a place he didn't remember ever visiting. He stepped forward, feeling the blond's hand gripping him tightly by his cloak. There were so many of them. There was no way he could've escaped it, especially when he saw his wand fly from his hand and colourful spells fly towards him.
Draco chuckled, shaking his head and looking at Hermione, rolling his eyes.
“Yeah, they are.” Harry smiled, and then Draco frowned, thinking about something he said.
They fell on the bed, and Draco scooted back so he was in the middle of it. Harry placed himself between Draco’s legs, kissing his neck and shoulders, going down and finding a nipple with his mouth, sucking lewdly, biting and rolling it with his tongue. Draco moaned loud, the cold night forgotten with the fire within him. Harry sucked on it hard one last time, before kissing down his ribcage, stomach and groin, breathing in Draco’s scent.
It was a fair enough agreement, and they settled it with their right hands. Although not much older than me, King Harry looked like a brute. I haven’t seen him closely – of course not. I was the most precious jewellery of my kingdom, I had to be protected at all costs. But I’ve managed to ran away from my maid, Pansy, and spied him through a gap on the Throne room door. He was huge, much bigger and stronger than my father was, although both were alphas. It looked like the genes of the North-easterns ran thicker.
“Oh fuck, Harry! I’m gonna come, I’m gonna co--!!” Draco came untouched all over Harry’s chest, thick ropes of come landing on his skin. Harry couldn’t hold back anymore, thrusting all the way inside of Draco and coming inside him, his own eyes closing in ecstasy, his moans loud and wanton.
Harry licked his lips, taking off his own tee and coming closer to Draco, touching his forearms and then going up to his shoulders, making goose bumps roll down Draco’s spine. Harry touched both his shoulders and went down his chest, rolling Draco’s nipples with his thumbs.
And I did, my hands trembling when I held the paper with the lyrics, following Melinda’s cue when I started.
Harry loved his kids. He really did. But sometimes he wanted to
destroyed my past, Malfoy. I’m not going to let him destroy my future. Or yours, for that matter.”
“Why? You’re hot, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.”
Draco came, his mind blank, only Harry’s voice guiding him through his orgasm. He came and came and then came again when he felt Harry come behind him, his insides warm up with hot jets of sperm.
King Harry’s voice was deep, rumbling through my body, making me even more aware of how much I wanted him. I knew nothing of him, of how he was, how he would be as a husband, but at the moment, I would take what I could, and I wanted him in me
Draco looked up, his body tingling with anticipation.
She stopped in front of a yellowish door, that stood out like a sore thumb in the corridor. There was no way they’d mistake it. It had no handle, and McGonagall slid her wand in the middle of the door while saying
Living in a blurry world had already become customary, and he needed to hunt to support his family in any way, which may have made his vision improve a little. He still needed Dracy's help to catch fish faster, but it was true that he managed to do much better.
“Our story begin, many, many ages ago. When the world was just starting, and the Earth was just a baby, with it came the Moon. She immediately caught the attention of the Lord of our small Galaxy, and the Sun reached for her, making her shine every time he looked at her. Yet, they could never be together, for she turned her face to him after every day, and she walked hand in hand with Earth, her friend, hiding herself, and yet wishing for the Sun, as much as he wished for her.”
“You were naked.”
“The tree wanted us to eat.”
“Were you good boys to uncle Ron and aunt Hermione?” Draco asked, and Sirius nodded, still fascinated by the baby.
“My name is Lucy.” He said, and Harry frowned. “My husband and I went out sailing and... All I remember after hitting the island is the salty taste of water and sand in my body. Unfortunately, there is no way out of here.”
“I got lost. My equipment stopped working and when I saw the island and you two on the beach... I thought you could help me or go with me.” He said, rubbing his face. “
As they lay on the bed next to each other, Harry turned to kiss Draco good night, but Draco stopped him.
“This is Aries. See? There’s an A under his left foot,” Harry showed said foot to Saturn. “You already know your letters, don’t you?”
When the oysters were ready, Draco left the hut, his expression sad and dejected. Harry followed him, hugging him near the stairs and kissing the top of his blond hair, which was getting lighter and lighter because of the sun.
“She called me ‘mama’!” Dracy said, smiling at Harry.
“We’re wasting precious time! Harry, come up here boy, and sing as best as you can.”
“We made another miracle, blondie. Look at her. She’s perfect. God, she’s
“You taught me well, papa.”
Harry got up on the bed, taking off his own clothes - already looking like rags - and kneeling between her legs. Moonlight came in through the window, and Harry sucked on the fingers that had once been inside Lucy, who moaned, her breathing labored.
“Hm?”
“What?” Hermione asked, looking from Ron to me and back to Ron.
thirty-five-year-old Draco said, looking down at two pairs of golden-green eyes that belonged to his children. Leo was five and Ursa was eight, but both of them couldn’t ever get tired of listening to the story of how their parents got together.
I had four months of probation, working my arse off to clean the castle before classes officially started again. It makes you think, when you’re cleaning splotches of dried, old blood from the castle walls.
“It’s my family symbol,” he said, pulling a necklace from inside his jumper. It had a snake pendant on it.
Draco took advantage of that moment to take one of the big pots they made and collect some cotton balls. He had been separating the seeds from the fluffy part for a few days, replanting the seeds so that more cotton would grow. He knew that by trying hard enough, he could make those balls turn into threads, but for now, he was more concerned with having a large amount of seedless balls in his pot.
“Come, ride me, I want you on top of me…” Harry murmured, and Draco licked his lips.
As she said those words, plates and plates of delicious food appeared in front of them, and Harry stared at the younger faces, how they were delighted and enraptured by the sight.
Having made sure that no caterpillar was around anymore, Draco began to help Harry more actively in the process of building a shelter. Harry looked for long branches, vines, soft pieces of bark, anything that could help them have a safer place to shelter. For now they could drink coconut water and eat the meat inside, but if they were very hungry, Harry believed that the small portions of saltwater in the bay might contain some fish that could be fried in a fire. But he would check that later. They needed to build the shelter and they needed it fast.
I was waiting for the first kiss that often came after the ceremony, but it didn’t happen. It looked like, different from Slytherin, all the loving in the first night was between the Omega and the Alpha only.
It seemed things were going to work out just fine.
"Better?" He asked, and heard Draco whisper a 'thank you' before his breathing evened out again.
“Well, they’re
Harry didn't realise he had moved. In seconds, he was holding Dracy by the wrist, pulling him hard away from the baby, the berries falling to the floor with the sudden movement.
And then I felt it: small hands in mine, grey eyes looking up at me, and the softest smile. That magical jasmine and mint scent surrounded me, and I could finally breathe.
Harry positioned himself better between her legs, holding one of her thighs with one hand, and with the other, he held the base of his penis, pressing it into her body. Lucy moaned, her body arching towards Harry's, her channel even tighter than Harry remembered, pressing around his cock in a visceral grip. Harry couldn't control himself. Soon his thrusts were strong and violent, his instinct speaking louder. He knew that she really needed that pleasure, because soon her body shook again in a delicious orgasm.
“I’m going to fuck you so good… You’re going to come so hard, baby.”
“Dracy Potter.”
“I lost a brother, Malfoy,” Weasley said, his broken voice making me look back at him. His eyes were wet, but his face… It was the face of someone who had hardened his heart over the years. “I almost lost my father before that. Harry’s lost his entire family. Hermione spent months looking for her parents. But let me tell you this, and listen well, because I’m only saying it once: you didn’t kill them. You didn’t raise your wand and killed them.”
“Hey, mate, what’s wrong?” He caressed Saturn’s back, and the little boy started crying harder, bending down and kissing his baby brother’s forehead.
right. It’s just not on
“Since we're making confessions before death... I'm gay. Completely gay.”
“I didn't learn, ok? Repairing things?” Draco tossed the empty coconut away, letting the air out of his mouth.
Upon reaching the room, however, Hermione frowned. There was something different about the tapestry. The image with Draco's name had moved, along with Harry's, both becoming more centered on the tapestry, and side by side. Between the two images of Harry and Draco, there was an interwoven gold thread, and in place of "Malfoy" there was now "Potter" next to Draco's name.
you,” Harry corrected.
“Well, we decided not to name any of our boys
They soon got bored and their conversation moved to other places, like Harry’s missions – he was currently out of any because he asked to be assigned to Draco’s spell damage fix. As they talked, Draco started plucking some flowers, making a crown out of them. Harry couldn’t stop looking at his hands, his fingers were long, almost bony, but so beautiful. He loved Draco’s hands, and he longed to hold them all the time.
I should think he was hideous. But my steps failed me, and I could feel my whole body responding to his presence alone. I could feel my hole slicking up in excitement, and I hoped no one would smell my arousal. Once I stopped near him, though, his nostrils flared, and the green of his eyes was tainted with a yellow colour.
Draco’s wand that defeated Voldemort in the end.”
Draco smiled against his mouth, raising his own hand and touching Harry’s face.
Dracy was upset that he had not seen the first time Talitha had done magic, but it was no problem. Talitha, perhaps because she was in an environment where magic flowed without wands, albeit in a limited way, learned to imitate her parents. Soon she was floating her doll to herself, or throwing away things she didn't want to eat.
Everything stopped, and the man looked up to Harry, then to the toy, then to Harry again and put both hands on his knees, breathing hard.
He growled at my words, ripping off his clothing and getting naked before I could even move from where I was. He held me by my waist, his big hands holding me as if I were a doll, and I had to hug him with my arms and legs so I wouldn’t fall. He sucked on my neck,
“He’s not worth it, Harry.”
Draco once again felt embarrassed and closed his eyes.
“We have a baby sister. It means we’ll have to be very good brothers to her,” Sirius said solemnly, and looked back at Ron, who was sideways smiling at the boy.
“Terrified. We can... We can die. At the sea. Alone. Without food. We can be devoured by sharks even before we get halfway there. There is so much that can go wrong. But staying here... Staying here is even worse.,” Harry turned his face to his companion and bit his lower lip when he noticed Draco was crying. His body trembled and the dim moonlight that came through the shelter opening illuminated his tears. “Do you still want to try?”
DRACO
The narration flowed easily, each song getting into the other as the choir sang as one. We all danced and moved, and I felt alive. The sensation I had that I was part of something big was incredible, and it made me have purpose. I felt that I’ve lost it after the war. I didn’t know what to do, who I was or what I was supposed to do. Ron had Hermione, and he was already asked to work with George on the shop. Hermione had a few work options as well, and I had…
“Well… I’m happy you decided to go out in the middle of winter in a fucking snow storm.” Harry said, and Draco laughed out loud.
“No, Harry... Initially, that's why I said that, but... I want to ...
“Well... It's just…” Dracy stood up, turning on her side and running a hand over her belly. There was a round shape there that hadn't been there before, and Harry felt his eyes burn with emotion, his heart pounding and a smile taking over his face even before Dracy spoke. “I'm pregnant.”
“She's too young to learn this so quickly,” Dracy commented, biting his lower lip. Talitha had her eyes almost closed, one hand playing with a lock of Dracy's hair, sucking slowly on a nipple, more to calm down than because she was hungry. Harry watched the little girl's lips around the nipple, a thin line of milk wetting her mouth. He smiled, smoothing her black hair.
, he wanted to say, and licked his face again. Draco rested his head on Harry’s paws, his breathing heavy. Birthing four puppies should be easy enough, Draco told him, but Harry was so worried. He knew Draco was in pain, the contractions coming every now and then, and he wished he could do anything to help. Draco told him he didn’t want Harry in human form as he gave birth, so the black wolf was there beside him, mad because he didn’t have any thumbs to help his mate deliver.
“Do you have any better suggestions?”
and she could fix it with her wand.
After spending so many days sleeping in leaves and straw, that bed was incredibly comfortable. Harry quickly took off his clothes, and Draco soon followed him out of his own. Harry lay down on the bed and Draco sat on his lap, one leg on either side of his hips. Draco touched Harry's stomach and chest, kissing up from the man's abdomen to his neck.
Harry supposed that Draco was already in his second month of pregnancy, due to the symptoms he had. There was no change in the size of his belly, but Draco always looked tired, with dark circles under his eyes and his small breasts were terribly sensitive. Harry had become accustomed to sleeping with his hand on one of them, but in the last week, after discovering the pregnancy, Draco always removed his hand at night, due to the sensitivity.
“Yeah, yeah,” Saturn paid him no mind. “Can I hold him?”
Zabini's song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eoBbaESJ-Q
It hurt Harry when he noticed Draco was trying to hold back tears.
Auror Ronald Weasley was once again on one of those boring meetings. They never had any goals, and they only discussed things that, in the end, would not improve the searching at all. Harry and Malfoy were still missing, and nothing and no one could find a solution to find them.
“She just called you 'mama'.” Harry smiled, looking at Dracy, his smile opening even more when Talitha repeated.
The gargoyle turned, showing the staircase and they went up.
“Other than writing a mechanic character once, I don’t think I have anything that relates me to you…” Draco said with a bit of disappointment. “But… The snake is enough, isn’t it? I mean, we both have it.”
The mediwitch nodded, smiling as she wrapped the baby after cleaning her up, putting her in Draco’s arms. Draco looked down at her, and unwrapped her body, looking at the baby’s naked form. He counted all her fingers and toes, he checked her ears and little nose. He caressed her little mop of dark hair, and between her legs just to be sure.
And try they did. They had sex every other day, and every day when they knew Draco was more fertile. They read every book they could read on the subject. They considered themselves specialists on pregnancy now, even pointing out what could be going wrong or what they were doing right.
“I... I speak English.” The man said with a strong accent, that Harry couldn’t identify from where. It sounded slightly as if the man's native language was from a Latin branch. “What happened here?”
He left there after kissing Draco’s thighs, his tongue being replaced by two fingers. Harry stretched his rim slowly, looking into Draco’s eyes.
Finally, Malfoy’s song had ended, and Flitwick asked us to sing the chorus once again, fixing the tune of the sopranos and tenors as we practiced the same two lines over and over again, until we got it right.
“Good observation, Mr Holmes.”
After a couple of seconds, Draco looked back to Harry.
Turi immediately moved, sitting beside his father and looking down at his baby brother.
Ron and Hermione were waiting for the call for a while, and once Draco’s water broke, Harry had called them to watch the boys. They arrived with Rose and Hugo, with their overnight bags, congratulating them on the new baby.
With a flick of his wand, he cleaned them both and started zipping up his jeans. Draco took a little more to start pulling up his trousers and buttoning them. He turned to Harry, heavy, dark eyes, and grinned, tiredly.
Harry frowned, looking down at Draco, his bottom lip pouting a little.
“No. I want her with me.” Dracy said, and Harry nodded. He didn't know why, but he had a strange feeling in his chest that told him not to sleep.
Draco rolled his eyes, softly holding Scorpius by his nappy-covered bum and rearranging him on his chest. He looked up as Harry rested his elbows in the back of their settee, smiling at Draco. There was a patch of white hair where Harry’s scar met his scalp, and Draco wanted to scratch his husband’s head with his fingers, so he could feel the soft strands.
“I bet it’s on papa’s willy.”
“It’s okay, my love. We don’t have to try anymore. We’ll find another way to have a baby. It’s okay.”
“Well, I won’t promise to be his friend, but I can be civil,” Ron said, and Harry smiled.
He still felt awkward, though. His hair was longer, almost shoulder-length, and he had it wrapped in a messy curly bun. His glasses were new, square and black-trimmed, and he was wearing new Hogwarts robes because his old ones were too small for his body now. He felt a bit less weird than when he was seventeen, but the awkwardness never really went away.
“Tell me again why I decided to marry you?”
“Papa
“I’m an elk. Yes, it’s a bit weird considering my father was a deer and my mum was a doe, but apparently it runs on my father’s side. Hermione dug it for me a few months ago. I haven’t known I had a family tree at all.”
person.” Dracy shook his head, sighing and hugging his own body. “Besides, I like the feeling of being recognised as both. That's what I am, Harry.”
“Come, Harry. Put a baby inside of me.”
Harry's head ached as if he was hungover. The feeling was the same, from the incessant throbbing to the sickness. However, he knew this was due to a faulty portkey, not a drunken night. He was trying to situate himself by remembering what happened that day.
Harry was also noticing how much he observed Draco. His hair, his eyes, his soft skin – because, obviously, Draco acted like he
I stopped with my mouth open, and I could feel my whole body heat going up as I thought exactly how I would like to kiss Malfoy senseless.
After that moment, the days seemed easier, even though Dracy's relationship with his pregnancy continued to be one of distance. As his belly grew, more effort was made by Dracy to ignore it, and whenever they had sex, Dracy stood on his side, in a position where, while not having to make a lot of effort, he also didn’t need to actively look at his belly.
Hermione also looked shocked, and swallowed.
“So… You’re taking people back to the team?” Goyle asked, and just like that, Harry knew they would have to include a bit of Goyle in their meetings.
It didn’t take much for them to find a child of their own. Almost a month later, they received a letter. A mother was giving their child to one of the wizard orphanages because they were a half-blood, and their family was completely against her relationship with a pureblood. Being honest, Harry didn’t want to know her story, because he knew it was sad and hurtful. The war had consequences, and although Voldemort was now dead, people still had negative ways of protecting themselves.
“Papa?”
When Ron and Hermione arrived with their boys, they were in their best behaviour. Cygnus and Castor were placed on Draco’s bed. Aries went to Harry’s arms and Scorpius and Sirius stood beside the bed, looking at the small bundle that was the baby in Draco’s arms. Rose and Hugo went to Harry’s side, also curious.
He’d never be able to pack his things again and come back to his cold city flat. He’d rather be here in Harry’s countryside house forever and ever as long as Harry kept kissing him like that.
“What happened?” Harry asked, and looking down at Draco’s face. The first thing Harry noticed was his friend had wet eyes, his breathing was broken and far too fast. Fuck, he was having a panic attack. How long this had been going on, Harry didn’t know. “Hey. Hey, Dray. Look at me.”
Draco tried to make himself small, lowering his head and pressing himself against Harry’s back. Harry ran his hands through his long hair, putting it up in a bun while trying to control himself not to punch Eaton in the face.
“Well, I suppose if it’s not clear in the main picture, we can take another one with just you,” Mark said, and Draco nodded. Harry sat at his side, putting Castor in his arms and reaching for Cygnus, who didn’t want to take the picture at all.
“Yes, Harry! Yes! I want you to make me pregnant, fuck me and come in me until I’m full with your come…!”
“It’s impossible, we tried everything. And I haven’t felt any morning sickness. I think I’d know if I were pregnant!”
“Of course you can do it, Harry!” Max’s smile was honest and broad. “I heard you singing it when we were preparing to leave last rehearsal.”
“He wrote to me on Thursday asking if I was free for dinner on Saturday. He said he wanted to take me out as he had something to ask me but he made it clear that the invitation was purely platonic.” She looked at Draco with a bit of a suppressed smile remembering their earlier conversation.
Draco immediately stepped forward and cupped Harry’s cock through the pajama bottoms he was wearing despite the fact that it was the afternoon. “Hmm don’t do that. In fact I forbid you to wank ever again without me at least being there to watch you.” He said into Harry’s ear as he groped him and then gave his ear a playful little nibble. He could already feel Harry respond to him.
“But it didn’t?” Draco asked, just trying to help, trying to understand.
Then Harry did take his glass and quickly downed the rest of his first drink. Ron was still chuckling to himself oblivious. When Harry sat the empty glass down on the table he turned to Ron and looked at him as serious as he could.
“Yes, alright don’t push it.” Harry grumbled at him. Then he sat up a bit straighter and spoke clearly. “I’ll pop into the Ministry tomorrow and see if Arthur has time to see me. I might even send a note to Bill and see if I can meet him on his lunch break too, he might like to be included and another voice would be good. Plus Gandalf will be glad of the chance to stretch his wings.”
Yet in that moment there was some small part of him that wanted to finally push his father’s wishes out of his head. He was exhausted, too tired to think, too tired to put on his mask. He wanted to break down and tell the man looking at him that he had never really had a choice, in any of this. That he had been forced to take the mark. That he had been threatened over and over again and pulled in every direction until he no longer knew his own mind, own wishes, own feelings. Then, just as he opened his mouth to speak, still unsure of what exactly he would say, he felt his father's eyes upon him too and his years of Malfoy upbringing came back to the forefront of his mind. He snapped his mouth shut and simply bowed his head to the Minister in the manner that he knew was expected of him.
“Yes I support you. Always.” Draco replied honestly and then smiled slightly. “Just for once in your life maybe you can actually stick to the rules though. I mean there must be a handbook for Merlin’s sake, protocols to follow?”
“Why not?! She’ll be fine! We can take her pram into Ginny’s box and put a silencing charm on it if she needs to sleep or just have her on our laps with some of those head thingys. She’ll be fascinated by the flying and the lights!” Ron explained quickly.
Harry swallowed thickly and then nodded. He took a deep breath and attempted to lighten the mood somewhat. “He, er, actually has a pretty obvious war wound. He likes to show it off and joke about how he lost an ear to save the famous Harry Potter but I think he’s still a little insecure about it. I think he worries about it making him ugly but he’s not.”
“Is it stupid that I’m scared you’re going to tell me that Riddle found the unbeatable wand even though I know you still defeated him?” Draco laughed nervously.
Draco bit back a smile. We’ll see, Mother. We’ll see.
They stood around in the kitchen drinking beer and catching up from the week whilst the curry finished cooking. Harry learnt that the ‘No-Clue-Though’ game was all ready and the twins had set all the pieces to magically duplicated over the weekend in the basement workshop ready to hit the shelves Monday.
He decided for now to ignore Harry’s obvious desire but he would definitely have fun teasing him when their guests were here too. “So what’s on the menu?”
“What form of exercise did you used to do then?” Harry asked genuinely. “You definitely are pretty fit too you know, you’re stronger than you look so there must be muscles in there somewhere.”
At that point Fred and George both burst out laughing and Harry was relieved they were seeing the funny side of this, then again he shouldn’t be surprised.
Draco knew in his gut that he’d have trouble keeping things casual, he was too possessive for that and he definitely didn’t want to be someone’s dirty little secret. He supposed he’d just carry on befriending the man and maybe flirting with him a little here and there just to see where it led. He didn’t like not having a plan, not having an end goal but that was the best he could do at the moment.
Draco’s hands found their way onto Harry’s arse and as he further encouraged Harry to grind against him. It wasn’t long before Harry’s hand became coated in Draco’s release as Draco threw his head back finally breaking their kiss and Harry could feel his body relax happily beneath him. Without even bothering to clean his hand, Harry unabashedly placed it on top of his own cock beneath his shorts and quickly brought about his orgasm to follow Draco.
“I wasn’t aware that I had to tell you where I was going all the time and inform you the moment I came back.” Draco said defensively.
As always I really love you comments, thank you so much for the responses this far.
Harry wandered into the office unsure exactly where to wait and what to do. Draco seemed slightly on edge to him today and he was worried about him. Yesterday he seemed content and he definitely said he wanted to see Harry today. Harry got an encouraging vibe from him and he knew Draco trusted him now, surely he’d want him here? Harry had welcomed Draco into his home after all, at the very least they were friends now.
“She wants me to set something up to meet you!” Harry said smiling.
This was it for him now. Harry was it for him now.
Harry was laughing too. “No, that’s not what I meant. I’m definitely not into women but I couldn’t think but think she might be a good match for you George.”
“Well you were pretty clueless at school and I didn’t exactly advertise it.” Draco shrugged.
“You can just use them as room sprays, or spray them on any linen really including clothes. There are also magical lavender bath salts in there too. I would personally recommend you start taking a bath before bed, use the salts in there and they will help you to relax and feel sleepy. You can also use the bath time for meditation, I do sometimes and I’ve written down some tips on how to clear your mind on that scroll too.” He finished and looked at Harry slightly nervously.
Harry was looking at him in awe, it was the best look and it filled Draco with confidence to go on, to say more. To tell Harry exactly how wanted he was. Harry didn’t seem to be able to speak anyway.
“I love you too, Dracy Malfoy.”
“I’m pregnant,” Draco stated, and it was filled with wonder and feelings. “Harry,
“Nice game, Harry,” Draco said when they landed, and Harry couldn’t stop himself. He was so happy he hugged Draco right there, in front of everybody. Draco hugged him back.
“Should I move to my own bedroom?” I asked, and he frowned.
“Yeah. Did the git do anything?” Ron asked, one of his eyebrow raised.
As the moment of delivery approached, Harry became more and more worried. He made a point of always adding some vitamins that came in Roberto's boxes to Dracy's food, so that neither the baby nor he was deficient in anything. Alone, he made preparations to make the pregnancy easier, thinking about what would be the best option for that moment.
see his faded Death Mark, though, but decided not to dwell on that. That part of both of their lives was over.
-x-x-
“Hm… The sea… And cinnamon… And your deodorant smells like chocolate…”
“More, if you count Shell Cottage. It’s one of our family properties as well, and Bill inherited it. He’s the oldest kid, you know.” And then he looked straight into Hermione’s eyes. “The other house is going to go to the next kid who marries, so…”
Sirius reached out, touching his little sister’s hair and smiling softly, which was different yet sweet on his face, since he was a trickster by nature.
“Come inside me, Harry. Come all the way inside me.”
“Daddy, is papa going to be okay? When they take the baby from his belly?”
“Ginny will kill you if you teach Sirius to do the same to baby Sue as you did to her,” Hermione said, but the whole thing was lighthearted and amazing.
“Your Highness,” he replied, coming closer to him and sitting beside him on the bed. The baby was feeding on Draco’s nipple, hungry and still reddish from the birth.
He was so self-conscious that he noticed way too late Draco’s wide eyes locked on his cock, his mouth opened in surprise.
(See the end of the chapter for
Training with Malfoy was… Eye opening. Not about the dancing. I still didn’t like dancing in public and it still made my stomach roll. But there was many things that I’ve never even thought, and he talked about it as if every single person in the world should know. Like my family, and about what I was missing. I always knew I was the only Potter out there, that I had no one to count on. I knew my grandparents were old when they had my father, and that he was an only child. But it didn’t mean my grandparents didn’t have a
He also noticed the stares and the insults. McGonagall was right. If Harry weren’t there, Draco would probably be bullied nonstop.
As the man moved, Harry saw, as if in slow motion, the photographer’s foot step down on the little matchbox car that Cygnus was playing with on the floor. Mark went down quickly, and Harry reacted before he could think, holding Cygnus tightly with one arm and grabbing Mark’s arm with his other hand, tugging him so he wouldn’t fall down.
Harry kissed his neck again, overwhelmed with emotion. Fuck, he was so happy.
“I promise, daddy,” Sirius said, hugging him again and staring at his parents when they got in the fireplace so they could floo to St. Mungo’s.
He tried to get out of the snow again, but to no avail. Draco was deep, utterly fucked.
“Malfoy...?”
“Hey, Dray… Don’t… Don’t cry… I’m sorry if I said someth—“
“I vow to serve, to love, and make you happy every day of my life, only stopping once I’m away from you because of my own death.”
“Oh, Madame Hooch was very vocal about your amazing bass voice when in the showers after the games. Besides, you don’t really have an option, Harry. You’ve been picking fights in the Quidditch field, and I thought that
“Hn-hm. Check again, Weasley,” he said, bumping Harry on his shoulder with a smile on his face.
Harry watched his back for a while, and unable to control himself, he asked:
“Fuck you, you walk naked around me all the time!” Harry crossed his arms, his face red, and Draco laughed.
all big and muscled and tanned and hairy. I knew that because people in this region used very little clothing. It was very normal for both men, women, omegas and alphas to use trousers, here. Very tight ones, made from some flexible and sturdy fabric. Women often wore clothing with deep cleavages and short sleeves, and men – even omegas! – would chose to go shirtless or with short-sleeved shirts. Male omegas would use some sort of top, very tight on their bodies, if they chose to go shirtless. At least it looked like they were decent enough not to show their breasts, as small as an omega’s breast was.
“And what do you think of the pronoun 'them'?” Harry asked.
“Then why are you asking? We’re not going anywhere, Harry. Besides, we are all going to be at The Burrow for Boxing day, are we not?” Ron said, and I nodded, because that was the plan.
I never felt this way before. No one has ever looked at me the way he did, and no one has ever sung to me the way he sang. When we came backstage and Flitwick thanked all of us, allowing us to finally have dinner, I still hadn’t let go of his hand. It made me feel safe and important, and I didn’t want to feel like old bastard Malfoy yet.
At the end of the day, Draco had a new team, and they came up with a plan for their training. Harry couldn’t see them, of course, since of course, they were on opposite teams. So Slughorn volunteered to observe them as they trained. On that same day, Goyle approached Harry, breathing in hard before talking to him.
Thirty minutes later, having fucked Draco against the wall, they were finally ready to fall into their bed and sleep. With Draco happily dozing with his head on his chest, Harry looked up to the ceiling.
“Find the states? Potter, even I know one of them. I can’t access it, of course, I’m a Malfoy, but it’s general knowledge. The Potters are a damn rich family, they had a whole damn hair products business. How much do you know about your family?”
I couldn’t help but be embarrassed. I was an adult, an alpha, for God’s sake. I should’ve known better than end up in a fistfight with Blaise Zabini over Ginny Weasley like a dumb troll. And he wasn’t even doing anything, I just
Potter didn’t have three left feet. He had
you’ll be wearing all black.” I tried to reason with him, patting his knee over his jeans. I thought that would be safe. “Besides, if it gets too hard on you, you can always keep looking at me or at Blaise and Lovegood. It won’t look weird at all.”
“It’s getting worse, isn’t it? Well, at least you’re safe and inside. Could’ve died outside. Nobody taught you that you shouldn’t get out in a snow storm?”
I was ripped away from my daydream by Pansy, who clapped her hands in my face.
“It took you only four bloody seasons to tell me it?” Draco asked, and Harry smiled, kissing him against just because he couldn’t help himself.
He washed his hair, smelling his shampoo first. It smelt like some kind of tree, he couldn’t identify which, and he shrugged. Malfoy smelt good enough for both of them, he guessed. He washed his hair twice, just to make sure it was properly clean, and then soaped his body. He felt weird even holding his own penis because he was so aware of how big it was in his own hand. When he and Ginny had shared their first sexual experiences together, she didn’t let him fuck her properly, she was too scared. Harry understood, and only pushed in half of it inside her. She said she felt good, but he was so aware of how easily he could hurt her, that he didn’t manage to have an orgasm while having sex. Harry knew he was bisexual by then, and he knew it wasn’t that he found her unattractive. Ginny was beautiful. He could actually have orgasms when she was sucking him off because he didn’t have to worry about hurting her then. The problem was when they had penetrative sex. It felt like an insurmountable issue and Harry knew it was one of the reasons why they broke off.
It was all it took for Draco to come inside Harry’s mouth, filling his mouth with his pleasure. Harry’s fingers and mouth didn’t stop until Draco stopped coming. He withdrew his fingers from Draco and licked his cock clean, kneeling between Draco’s spread legs and running his hands over Draco sensitive skin.
“I am. They’re perfect. I love them. But I also love the thought of getting you pregnant and then seeing your bump grow…”
Both men moved, trying to get the snitch as fast as they could, without trampling or jumping over any of their kids. Mark was screaming nonsense, trying to protect his camera as chaos took over the living room. With a jump - and no children on his arms - Harry managed to get the Snitch, making all the kids cheer and clap.
“Fuck… That was amazing… If I knew you had that weapon between your legs, I would have acted sooner.” Draco said, and Harry laughed, his body still sensitive from his orgasm. Draco looked up at him, kissing his lips and running his hands through Harry’s long hair. “Be my boyfriend.”
His beard brushed her skin, tingling her as Harry tasted the salt on her skin. He went down, giving little kisses on the mound of her belly, going down between her legs. He made a move to remove her underwear, but saw that she wore none. He smiled.
“‘onkey!”
you make a boat, Potter?” He asked at last, and Harry shrugged.
“The alternative is to live here forever, Potter. Of course I still want to... try,” Draco sniffed, putting a hand to his face and wiping it off. “But I'm scared, too. Terrified.”
“Hm… Yeah, I’m good.”
“I love you too, Harry.”
Dracy pushed the placenta a few minutes later, and Harry cut the umbilical cord with two fingers and magic fire, cauterising the cut immediately.
I admit I liked it when she talked to me as her best friend.
“It’s okay, Goyle. We’re fine.” Harry clapped him on his shoulder, observing that although Goyle was still muscular, he looked much thinner than he was before. Maybe it was Azkaban, maybe it was work, but he too looked very different. “Thanks for talking to me.”
“I think you're open enough to…”
“You said yesterday your chest was sore, didn’t you? And the weird food… It’s been happening for a while too.” Harry reasoned, but Draco shook his head again.
“They want to give up searching.”
Maybe it was because it was overwhelming for both of them, but Harry couldn’t wait any longer. His pace turned almost ferocious, the sound of skin against skin reaching his ears as he pounded inside Draco over and over, smashing non-stop against his prostate.
didn’t ejaculate from her penis, yet she got hard and sometimes released pre-seminal fluid. His theory was that she had no testicles, which was possible with an unconventional anatomy. Still, the amount of lubricating fluid that ran between her legs was enough to make up for the lack of another fluid.
Harry laughed, eyes twinkling in amusement, looking a bit surprised at Draco’s joke but quite relaxed. When he stopped he suddenly turned serious and tilted his chin to better look in the Slytherin’s eyes “I didn’t know you were —“. He appeared unsure.
“You know, when you told me, a while ago, that it was ok to be afraid, it made me feel less alone. But that’s all I had. . . Fear. That was my reason. I was hoping to see in Snape’s memories that things could be different. That I could be more than the mark on my arm. But, if it wasn’t for your mother, he would have been just that”.
“Sorry. They are mostly disney. I- uhm - didn’t have a. . . conventional childhood”. He sighed, running a hand through his hair. The bird nest, Draco noted with a strange relief, was mostly unchanged from the familiar mess he was used to. Potter had let the front grow slightly longer, and the curls fell over his eyebrows, hiding his famous scar completely. “My friends declared I had a lot to catch up on, and I guess nine months do make for quite the collection.”
“You know something.” Straight to the point.
The sky was dark when he finally stumbled out of the Room of Hidden Things, shutting the door and feeling it disappear behind his back. Two girls giggled with the grace of Vincent and Greg and Draco let his head thump against the hard stone, wanting to laugh hysterically until he was a crumpled mess on the floor.
“Smith” the boy replied in a small voice.
He was alive. He looked wordlessly at his companions and at Greg, still unconscious between Weasley and Granger. Vincent was nowhere to be seen, and even before voicing his fear Draco knew he was dead. The second death in the stream of casualties to wash on Draco’s bank. To touch him personally.
It’s mainly reflections.
“I don’t understand” Draco replied, voice soft an uncertain, like a confession.
“He has a cat.” He wrote instead. “A ginger tabby. His name is Ron, looks like your charm wasn’t as effective as you claimed.”
Weasley looked scared “Damn you, Harry! Do you think — ?” But he couldn’t finish.
Draco was starting to feel loose and relaxed, almost convinced that things were truly going to work out.
“You have never really bothered to ask, have you? You just assumed this was the life i wanted, too. That i wanted this just like Stephen” Theo was yelling to his father, uncaring of the dangers his loud voice could attract.
“Dear Mister Malfoy” the letter read “we are pleased to inform you that, due to the events that prevented the completion of your NEWTS, you have been invited back to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The year will not be mandatory but necessary if you are to finish your education.
Potter was not stupid, Draco was mature enough that he could admit as much. When bothered enough to put in the effort, he was a decent student, excellent in the subjects that caught his interest. Perhaps not academic, like Granger, but definitely not subpar, like Longbottom or even Weasley. That he rarely seemed to push himself to his full potential was beside the point and, as much as Draco did not understand, he guessed the other boy really had no one to please or to make proud. Even Dumbledore, despite his obvious favouring of the Gryffindor, could not be considered a parental figure. The thought of the Headmaster made Draco twitch, and he forced it out of his mind.
Summer of 1997 was a completely different matter. His home, his pride and the place of most of his childhood treasured memories, was no longer empty, but the company was far from what younger Draco had imagine in his wistful fantasies.
To his surprise, Potter gave a short humourless laugh, a wide open mouth  thing, canines bare and pointy. Wild predator teeth in a human boy’s face, Draco thought a bit bewildered.
To his surprise, Scott snorted rather loudly “Evan is allergic to anything that could attract any form of recognition.”
“Are you two a couple?” He blurted out, hoping that his shock didn’t pass for disgust because, well, that would have been a bit hypocritical. He had never exactly hidden his own sexuality, but at the same time it was something he didn’t flaunt around, keeping his and Theo’s escapades exclusively between the boundaries of the Slytherin dungeons. He had definitely never considered that the Gryffindor could share his same inclinations.
“He played it well. . . He was able to fool Voldermort, don’t beat yourself up too hard”. Potter tone was almost sad.
His father had nodded from the door.
I have to double check it but I’ll post if for now before I forget
“First time flying?” The Muggle asked, conversationally.
“It doesn’t seem like something you would enjoy” Draco mused and he could see a flick of irritation passing in the other wizard’s eyes.
But Draco knew now. He knew why the memories were given to him, and he understood why someone like Lupin, someone that loved Potter, would have never accepted what needed to be done. So he said none of that, falling willingly into the role he had been assigned. That, too, was becoming a fucking habit.
Draco knew he had to do something but all he could manage was a small tilt of his head in the Dark Lord’s direction, trying to avoid eye contact.
“So,” he asked cautiously, “you are looking for a way out of your current living arrangements, am I correct?”
As an adolescent, he had clung onto her words, wanting to believe with his whole heart that he could turn his pain into growth and still enjoy his life.
With a last glance at the ghost of himself in the mirror, he wiped his chin and entered the lounge.
The ride to the airport was mostly silent.
The other boy gave him an uninterested sideway glance and proceeded to make a show of dabbing his mouth with a napkin, before raising from the bench with the dramatics of a king leaving his throne. Draco sighed.
Once satisfied he let himself fall on the mattress and reached blindly for the pink notebook that had been blessedly left on the bedside table. What Draco wanted the most in that moment was to get lost over the little figurine of his mother, to make sure that she was okay, but he swallowed convulsively against the need and opened the diary on the third blank page instead. He summoned a quill from his luggage, the only bit of wandless magic he had managed to master during sixth year, and started writing.
“Caught Potter with his hands down his pants, have you?” Draco sneered hysterically.
He shook his head. James and Lily were gone.
“Anyway, as I said, I’ve always liked him, but I’ve realised I didn’t really know him all that much. He was only a Professor, despite his connections to my family. . . I suppose I just want to see what could’ve been if I had decided to follow a different path. .” If I had taken his help. If I had voiced my doubts. If I had been brave.
Macmillan had sulked for a bit until Thomas, who had been quietly drawing at the side, had ripped a page from his pad and charm it to fly his way. It was a sketch of pompous looking fountain with tiers and topped by a statue of the Hufflepuff pouring water from a fish’s mouth, and Macmillan had stared at it with an expression quite resembling the animal’s. Thomas had innocently suggested that they could have six, that he knew a great spell for carving stone. After an intense glare the other boy had agreed the pond was a good idea, as soon as he was promised there wouldn’t be anymore drawings depicting him half naked. The tension in the air had dropped and even Draco had silently admired the Gryffindor’s artistic skills.
Draco thought about Theo, who had sat rigidly trough dinner, his eyes fixed somewhere in the distance, unfocused and pained. About Vincent and Greg, that had slipped easily into his role and were now occupying Draco’s former place at the centre of the Slytherin table, lips twisted in two matching feral grins. About the other Slytherins, that were now in both a favourable and terrible position. About himself that, in this situation he once thought he would cherish, was truly alone. And about Potter that, wherever he was, hopefully wasn’t.
He was sipping on his Butterbeer when he felt someone sitting beside him.
The new Potter was clearly an enemy as much as the old one had been, because he merely laughed harder.
For reference, especially hair wise, I imagine him a bit like Nikolai, Prince of Denmark, in this particular picture that I am linking, for science purposes, of course (even age wise it works).
McGonagall had given a short but heartfelt speech about the importance of remembering. “You are the children of the war, but most of all you are the children of the aftermath. . .Of the restoration. The future is yours. On your shoulders lays the peace of the wizarding world. Although you have been trough a lot, in some ways you are lucky, because you have history showing you the path and what mistakes to avoid. You have all grown up quickly, but it has made you closer to each other. I see it every day, and I am proud to be your teacher and the Headmistress of this school. I have never been more confident that you will turn out to be exceptional wizards and witches and even better human beings”. She concluded. She looked at her children with proudness and emotion, and encouraged whoever wanted to say a word to step forward.
He took notice of his proffered hand just as the other boy’s palm came in contact with his own, shaking firmly up and down twice.
But that morning they had taken their last NEWT, Defence, and Hogwarts for Draco, and for Harry, was officially over. The other boy had looked a little sad. They had talked about how Hogwarts was his first real home, and Draco had wanted to ask more but hoped there would be time for that. Later. Maybe for the rest of their lives.
“It’s a tricky enchantment” Professor Flitwick explained, proud. “It’s tuned with emotions and will respond with the colour you need the most in the moment you step on it.”
They had considered Weasley’s words and came up with a project that had left the group the most excited.
“What is it to you?” Draco snapped back, irritated.
“Of-fucking-course I am aware mudblood Granger is above me in all but one subject, father, fuck you very much”. His father was always too far gone in his rants to notice the mumbled words, and Draco would just wait until the lecture was over to plaster a complacent expression over his features and nod meekly, ever the perfect son.
The cab pulled into one of the airports drop out spots, and there was no to time left.
“Close.” Dumbledore admitted sadly, “But that poor girl, Katie, is doing much better. It was a dangerous game, Draco, but it’s not too late.”
Greg’s huge hands reaching for a third serving of muffins, nails short and uneven.
“Mother. . . Mum, I really can’t see the benefits of going back. I did terrible things, at Hogwarts”.
The words were in his throat “Because he is nothing more than a pig for slaughter. Because Potter has to die and knowing him he will do it willingly. He will sashay to his death with his chin raised, shielding the rest of the world with his massive ego and his trice-damned hero complex that, honestly, is starting to get boring. Because there are no other options, don’t you understand, you stupid dreamer?” But he swallowed before any of that made it past his tongue.
“And if he doesn’t want to?” Snape sounded like he had been having this conversation a hundred times.
“We are all alone” he replied bitterly.
“Well, it seems you weren’t the only one, since Potter has yet to make an appearance.” Theo sounded almost angry and the vindictive voice in Draco’s head wanted to retort that he was indeed having a secret affair with his sworn enemy.
Despite his reservations, the car journey turned out to be smooth, almost relaxing. Scott fiddled with the radio before settling for some upbeat tune that Draco unsurprisingly didn’t recognise, but found himself enjoying nonetheless while it droned quietly in the background.
The title doesn’t have much to do with the chapter’s content as with the sense of belonging, to be part of something (like the round table in king Arthur).
“My mother” he replied, softly.
“Wha — No!” Harry shook his head, a faint blush “What happen with Cedric was a different kind of awakening. . . It was when I realised that things were bad. . . But I wasn’t interested that way. It was her older brother, Bill” he whispered almost conspiratorially.
Draco prayed for some of that Gryffindor sheer luck. “Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM” he yelled, wandless. Helpless. But that was enough distraction to give Potter the needed time to turn the fight around.
Weasley’s furious voice joined Potter, and Greg was lifted up into the air. Draco felt his own arms around a thin waist, and thanked the sheer luck and the brave heart of a boy who did what was right and not what was easy. Potter was a magnificent flyer and Draco wanted to reach the sky. For a moment he forgot about fire and danger and remembered the Quidditch pitch on sunny days, the adrenaline of the challenge. A worthy opponent, he had secretly liked that. The smoke filled his lungs, making him feel dizzy, and he gripped the other boy harder. He could feel Potter’s ribs under his fingers and dug into the soft spot under the cage, just a thin fabric separating flesh from flesh. Draco felt the fleeting need to touch skin before realising Potter had changed course.
I was like Oh boy, Potter! This guy looks a lot like my idea of Harry, glasses aside. I like to visualise a character when i write, so my Harry is a lot like this, good looking but not over the top swooning sort of thing, just normal, on the thin side, with wavy messy hair and very pretty eyes.
Potter appeared a bit surprised by the request, yet he uncorked the vial and poured the content into the bowl.
“Perhaps not.” Lupin conceded, the irritation Draco was pushing for finally bleeding into his tone.
“That’s Evan. Kid’s like a son to me.” Ellen revealed fondly. “Poor thing was so embarrassed that day. He is English as well. Too bad he is not in today, gave him two weeks off. Forced him to take ‘em, more like it. He gets those terrible headaches. . .” She broke off, realising she was possibly saying too much.
“I can’t. . . I can’t be sure” he mumbled. Coward. He thought about his conversation with Blaise, about making a difference. But he also knew that, despite being an accomplished occlumen, he was panicking and that made him more exposed to mind attacks. And in that moment his mind was screaming POTTER.
It was impressive how most Muggle were able to unconsciously dodge crashing into one another or getting their feet flattened by a stray wheel, all the while looking every-fucking-where but in front of them. Draco had yet to master that particular skill, his toes still aching as a result of a couple of close encounters with heavy luggages and their apologetical owners. It had taken all his self control not to Avada the wankers.
“I don’t care.” It wasn’t his fault none of those Muggles had any taste whatsoever.
“Mum . . .”
The class had been a surprise. McGonagall had decided that the once cursed subject needed a fresh approach, so she entrusted the position in the hands of two Professors. Iwan Rees was an ex Auror, whose years of experience in the field brought a more engaging twist to the class. On top of a similar attitude to Professor Lupin’s, which involved the students in practical confrontations with potential danger, Professor Rees would talk about the tricks he had learn during his career. Self defence became a matter of predicting the other’s moves and responding in the most effective way but with the least damage. You want to incapacitate but reduce the chances to hurt, because you don’t know your opponent’s story. And that’s where the other Professor, Nyah Achebe, fitted in the picture. A mind healer from St Mungo’s in her forties, Professor Achebe had worked for almost two decades in the Janus Thickey Ward department, attending to the victims of Curse Damage. She illustrated the ethical consequences of using potentially harmful spells against others, and the long term repercussions that said spells could cause. She talked to them about having to deal with the result of their actions and the importance of considering the life of the others on the same level as their own. Unless in mortal danger, when the need to react quickly overcame everything, it was fundamental that they had full control and understanding of the spells they were using. She was also there to offer support to the students who needed it, either because of the war or for other unrelated issues.
“I don’t know” he replied after a while, still facing the irregular stones on wall. He counted 43 on the second row from the ceiling.
He couldn’t risk it, though.
He knows, Draco thought, he knows. The air was sucked out of his lungs and his eyes drifted involuntarily back to the body still looming above his head. Would they be granted mercy with a quick execution or would their deaths be undignified, dehumanised, their bodies put up for a show like the nameless woman in front of him?
“My father, I know.” The other boy shrugged.
It was Draco’s turn to flush, but he accepted a plain white t-shirt without complaints. Even if it was a bit too big on the shoulders, he couldn’t deny his shirt was way too stuffy for the weather. He wondered if wearing Potter’s clothes was going to become a habit, but drew the line at the bright orange swimming shorts the prat had offered with a smirk.
“She got accepted into pre-law at UCLA, and ended up enrolling for a last minute summer program. She wasn’t sure she could even make it to college before, so it wasn’t really a decision at all.” Scott explained, pride swelling his tone.
“What I wanted to say, is that was powerful, Malfoy. It takes courage to do what you did.”
“W-who? Mum . . .” He hugged her back, forgetting about the world around them. She was still shaking hysterically, wetting the collar of his shirt “Oh Draco, I am so sorry. . . So sorry”.
“Nothing is going to change if we don’t make ourselves noticed”
Draco shifted, deciding that he better ignore whatever the fuck that was about in lieu of getting the answers he needed “How did I get here, wherever here is?”
Draco came to it feeling mildly disoriented, and wasn’t that becoming a fucking habit. Lupin stood, leaning over him, concern and confusion written all over his exhausted features.
He stared in the direction of Potter’s retreating form, still unmoving for long after the other wizard was gone, words of thank you on his lips unable to be voiced.
They discussed rent and a few other terms, to which he could only consent to, before the two boys dragged him for a tour of the flat, that wasn’t big at all.
Harry gave an incredulous chuckle “Luna is deliciously barmy”.
The surface felt cold around his finger, but Draco had only a moment to register the sensation before he was hauled into a different scenery. The pull, unlike a portkey one, wasn’t uncomfortable and lasted merely a blink. He was amazed at how real it seemed. He could perceive the warmness of the ground, the heaviness of the summer air. The only indication that he was an intruder was the feeling of a light, smooth film on his skin, like a barrier between his body and the reality around him. It kept him aware he didn’t belong in there, that he couldn’t interact, couldn’t interfere. He looked at what seemed to be an old playground and notice that the other boy was staring intently at a little girl who was pushing herself on one of the swings, dark red hair floating around her face. Draco considered the cruel irony of having the only glimpses of your own mother from someone else’s memories. Lily Potter, as it turned out, would never be able to push her own son on a swing. But this Lily, this child in Snape’s mind, didn’t know that, so she swayed in the air, happy and carefree. And her son looked at her, drinking in all her smiles.
“Yeah” Draco replied brokenly “Mine too”. I am one of them too, Theo.
With each death he had witnessed, Draco’s beliefs had fallen one by one, like corpses, like victims of the war. The only positive victims of this stupid war, he supposed, for he was a changed person. He vowed that, if he had any, he would raise his children to be different from the boy he had been. With respect, to never make another feel inadequate when, like the son of Muggles that had died for the future of Wizards, they were just trying to be themselves.
“Yes?” The Muggle asked, unbothered, rubbing some lingering oil from his lips with the back of his hand.
Harry blinked, his face and body relaxing. He smiled tentatively, huffing out a breath of relief.
For Salazar’s sake! Draco searched for something to stuff in his friend’s mouth. The apples looked appealing.
“Sorry” the boy said “You didn’t notice but the little girl in front of you dropped this”. His heavily accented tone was friendly enough but Draco could hear the hint of suspicion. He shrugged, unwilling to feel guilty, and the Muggle rolled his eyes, turning to get the attention of the family.
Draco looked at the pink notebook held out towards him in disbelief. Umbridge, his mind provided, he had been such a failure as part of the Inquisitorial Squad and now this was his punishment. He was about to ask if she had been using polyjuice all along when Possibly-Umbridge-In-Disguise sighed heavily and thrusted the journal further under his nose.
So, it took me ages to write this but my partner injured himself and it has been quite hectic.
“We share.” Potter finished firmly, chin titled defiantly in a way that Draco recognised as so quintessentially his that a wave of nostalgia hit him before he could even consider the words.
He never wanted that, and once again he felt the weight of his actions. Did you really think you could get all the power and glory without dirtying your hands? He asked himself, and even if his mind pleaded him that he didn’t know, that he hadn’t thought about that consequence, his heart couldn’t quite believe it.
“Good. . . Good! If you want to-“.
While working on a design for the Gardens, they had decided to place one stone bench on each side of Dumbledore’s grave, facing the calming waters of the lake. Luna had said it would be like sitting for a chat with the Headmaster.
They entered a second room next to his, and Draco found that he liked it just fine. It was quite bright, the bay window open just enough to let a nice breeze caressing his overheated skin. It was bare, but for a double bed similar to Potter’s, a chest of drawers, a desk and chair and a single picture of an orange tabby hanging just above the bedside lamp.
“What about your middle name?”
“Would you be interested in renting a room for a couple of months? No obligations if you’d rather travel the country.” She queried, eyes back on him with the same contemplative twinkle.
The timbre was vaguely familiar but lacked the instant recognition of an intimate connection and Draco’s curiosity suddenly spiked in tune with his heartbeat. It wasn’t fear exactly that prompted him to move slowly, as to avoid alerting the other person of his rouse, but caution. The instinctual need to assess the situation before revealing his cards, so to gain the upper hand in case of danger.
Draco pondered about it. No one would suspect the girl to receive something from the outside, and it looked small enough to be safely stored in one of the niches between the dungeon bricks.
“Nothing at all” Harry said, not sounding very sad about it.
“Direct, as always” Snape drawled in his disinterested cadence.
He didn’t turn around “I am already tainted”. Better me than Theo.
“Let’s not go there!” No fucking way.
Draco interrupted him, unsettled by having Potter addressing him with anything other than hostility. “It’s perfectly fine”. He wasn’t sure what he was agreeing to, but he deemed it safer to play along.
He waited until his friend had finished running his eyes over the page.
His chance had finally come, and the circumstances couldn’t be more different. The irony of using what he had once hoped would help him pleasing the Dark Lord to instead find the only boy actually able to destroy him, was almost poetic. What stayed the same was his once in a lifetime opportunity of a perfect day wasted on someone else’s fight.
Click.
His body tensed painfully, each muscle screaming for him to turn away, but he couldn’t advert his eyes.
Draco noticed just then the two abandoned brooms behind the Headmaster and the sudden feeling of alarm sent the clock in his mind ticking down faster.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Anyway,” Potter added, his voice suddenly tired, “Whatever you are doing, I hope it’s worth it” and he turned around and left.
“There are only two rooms, though. Where is yours?” He asked Scott, recalling the way Ellen had called him Potter’s roommate, or something.
My aim is to show certain situations that could have cause Draco to revaluate his beliefs and the part that Harry played in those changes. So i think seeing someone die (Dumbledore doesn’t count as he falls from the tower while this is in front of him) would be a big turning point.
“Do you know where she is?” Weasley growled, in accusation more than question.
“I didn’t chose to be a Slytherin, it’s just who I am. Which says nothing, because I am not at all like Blaise —“
“Then we have no time”. Dumbledore eyed his wand, clutched tightly in the boy’s grip and sighed. With a twirl of his healthy hand a vial appeared out of thin air, steadily filling with the stream of pearly liquid coming out of the Headmaster’s right ear.
“Are you telling me the defender of the weak, the hero of every witch in distress, is done with fighting the evil?” His tone was exaggeratedly incredulous but Draco was curious.
“Oh, who is befriending the Saviour now?” He mocked.
Draco felt an unfamiliar heat on his cheeks and diverted the conversation “I guess I am just shocked. . . Do you really forgive him, after all that?. . .Forgive them?”. Snape was, albeit indirectly, the cause of the Potters’s death, and Dumbledore had kept horrible secrets from their son until the very end. Draco was amazed that the other wizard hadn’t killed the men himself. “I am not really sure what I was hoping to see, but that wasn’t courage, Potter”. You, going in the forest to die, that was courage. “That was remorse”.
They fell quiet again, each in their own mind, then the Gryffindor spoke
Dusk.
Draco could see them all now, a group of four plus a small goblin, snarling ferociously at his captors. First he looked at Thomas, one of the Gryffindors student’s in Potter’s year, the only inconspicuous one between the prisoners. Then at the red haired one, Weasley. Shit. Granger’s bushy hair covered her face partially, but it was clearly her. Shit. Shit. And, sandwiched between his two friends, was the captive whom they claimed to be Potter. The boy was looking at the floor, eyes fixed on his ratty shoes, clearly avoiding his gaze. Draco didn’t want to look, either, but the other wizard’s face was bloated and stretched in an horrific way and for a moment he was convinced that person couldn’t be Potter. Potter, that had evaded the Dark Lord for so long even when so close in his grasp, had no business being in his house, after all.
The other boy eyed him warningly
It was pleasantly thoughtful and he found that he really appreciated it.
Draco thought about it “To a certain extent. It recognises me, but some of the spark is missing. Let’s say I might not reach the pinnacles of power with it, but it’s ok. Unicorn core is loyal, after all, so it’s still my wand”. And yours. Surprisingly, he was fine with that.
“Good thing we are not staying long, then.” Lupin dismissed him, looking around. “I have something for you.”
“Goodbye, then”.
Theo’s mouth, already tilted in his direction like a pull. The brief moment of desire dwindled at the perpetual frown matching Blaise’s stare, lips a thin line of judgment.
He found the boy lurking in the bushes nearby. The younger version of their former Professor was looking at the girl as well, but with another kind of longing. Draco recognised the childish interest he too had sometimes looked at Theo with, when they played as children . Not yet sexual but different from the way he did at his other friends.
“Well then, be caught.” It almost sounded like the other man meant it, but Draco couldn’t give up just yet.
I know this is supposed to be Drarry but it’s going to be slow getting there. I hope that’s ok.
Dying.
Thanks for reading :) It makes me super happy to see views and kudos
The ginger shrugged “Your call, mate”, and that earned him a kick from the other Gryffindor. Harry was pushing him away with his foot “Don’t you have somewhere to be, maaate?”.
Only a child, who grew up on golden pillows like a prince but found out that for the rest of the world he was just one of many. Not superior. Nor better. Yes, he did have his share of admirers, money can buy you as much, but even then Draco knew it wasn’t genuine. It wasn’t because of who he was as much as for what he had.
“Have you considered that maybe it’s because you are less of a prat? You’ve stopped provoking people, so most are happy just leaving you alone.” There was a little smile on Potter’s lips.
The dawn light was starting to filter through the moth-eaten curtains and Draco almost bemoaned the fact that no Muggle had attempted to rob him during the night. He knew that hours of inaction hadn’t helped with his current state of mind, and he found that he was actually ready to face the day.
In that single moment, lain across the rundown floor of the same train that had once taken Harry to the beginning of his new life, fate offered him one simple solution.
She eyed him skeptically, dropping the menus on the nearest table. “Nonsense. I’m a man down but, seeing as we are not open yet, I think I can manage a full breakfast on my own. Mornings are never busy anyway, not this early at least. Orange juice or Coffee? You’d think tea, but in this heat. . .” Without waiting for a reply she pushed him towards one of the armchairs “Now, sit down, will ya? Allergies?”
“When are you going to tell him?” Luna asked, without raising her eyes from the book.
The end-of-spring air filtered heavily through the castle’s windows, carrying the smell of rain and, strangely, of wet dog. Magic bubbled under Draco’s skin, making the fine hair of his forearms stand under the baggy sleeves of his shirt. Powerful. Deadly.
The Death Eater just laughed stupidly.
And, mostly, it had been of little use over the years, almost forgotten. A few hasty cleaning spells had done nothing against the stench of disuse and many surfaces were still covered in a thin layer of dust, both indicative signs of neglect.
“Some will, yeah. Some people always will” the other boy conceded “But most won’t. It’s a happier time, and lots of students would want to just enjoy their life now that they can without bigger worries. . . Plus the majority of them were there last year, with the Carrows. They know you weren’t really into it”.
“No” Weasley said, but the wizard interjected “Why didn’t you use the Cruciatus, that day with Carrow?”
Draco tapped his new wand, his mother’s wand, on his leg under the table, a nervous habit he had picked up of late. Tap. Tap. Tap. He met Theo’s eyes and his heart clenched, the dreadful sensation of foreboding bubbling insistently in his stomach.
“Draco” he said warily.
Speaking of apologies, Draco moved to Harry, who had reached them. “I feel like you are the only one I haven’t apologised to, Potter” he stated formally.
It was the self deprecating tone that compelled Draco to blurt out “My father’s in prison.”
“I am not scared!”
“Hi. Thanks, I -“
The boy, Scott, rolled his eyes “My - Whatever. What about him?”
“I do not, care to enlighten me? I am sure you don’t mind”. He feigned innocence, looking for an outlet for his own increasing ire.
“Mhmm, I’ve heard this story before.” She said criptically. “Well then -“
“Apparently he swears to Merlin every now and then. His Muggle boyfriend finds it hilarious.” Draco replied, wondering if the other wizard was going to be shocked at the news.
Amycus turned his head slowly towards the Gryffindor and laughed cruelly “It seems Longbottom here has volunteered himself as a target for practice. How noble, come here boy”.
This chapter is about Luna and since i know she was taken on her way back after Christmas Holidays her and Draco didn’t have much time to get to know each other since he is at school when she is prisoner in his home, i created my own version of how they met. I wanted to say something else but i forgot so maybe i will add it later.
“I don’t understand.” Dumbledore was saying, “He hasn’t used his magic at all. The trace hasn’t picked up any activity, not even accidental. It has been almost a year Severus, and I am dying.”
The other boy must have read his silence as confirmation, because he continued a little more firmly.
For a moment, they stared at each, puzzled, but before the other man could open his mouth to say something else, Draco knew.
Even if Draco had recently had his personal fair share of crazy, the man in front of him looked like he must dine with insanity on the regular.
There was not much time, having to deal with the news of the missing boy spreading across the Wizarding Community like fiendfyre and with the bureaucratic nightmare that was forging someone’s new identity, but he was a skilled wizard and he had made it count.
“She is set on a warpath to change the world.” Potter added, equally admiring.
“Have a good school year, darling. I will send you chocolate”. I love you.
Snape’s tone held such contempt that Draco had no doubts where his loyalties really laid. The realisation that one of the Dark Lord’s most trusted servants was a two-faced snake didn’t surprise Draco as he thought it should, but he couldn’t really put his finger on why. After all, Snape despised Potter almost as much as Draco did.
He held them apologetically, conflicted. Please, please, he wished for something to happen. With a crash, the enormous chandelier that was dangling from the ceiling fell into the floor, sending glass flying everywhere. He could feel several tiny cuts on his cheeks, blood slowly running into his shirt collar, but he couldn’t care. He finally spotted Potter, next to a colourfully dressed house elf that looked vaguely familiar, and let out a sigh of relief. Potter had to win the war, he knew now, and his heart relaxed upon seeing that the other boy was mainly unscathed. And then Potter was right there, in his space, tugging at the wands in his hand. Draco looked at the other boy’s face, now back to normal, and thought about the last time they talked, in the bathroom.
“If you really wanted it so badly you could have taken it while i was fucking unconscious on your sofa for the last two days. Or is it touching me while I sleep too far even for a creature like you?”.
He had noticed Potter’s maimed fingernails enough times to know his perfectly kept manicure was the sign of a completely different upbringing.
Potter looked flushed, like if he had been running, and his voice came out breathless “Uhm, sorry, we had a late night. . . Ron’s brother. . . Anyway,  password is Russian Blue” Then he faced the gargoyle and repeated “Russian Blue”.
“I’m just gonna grab us something to drink. We have coke, oj, sparkling water… Maybe root beer, it’s actually alright!”
With the progression of dinner, though, the lack of Potter started to be noticed, all around the Hall. By the end of the night his initial gratification had been replaced by unease. Draco, who had indulged in what he thought was a well deserved second dessert, felt a wave of the ever present nausea that had been plaguing him all summer, return at full force. Almost compelled to ditch them and face the consequences, he scrambled through his prefect duties in a haste, only barely gloating at Weasley and Granger’s distress.
The other wizard relaxed visibly, and Scott even went as far as waggling his eyebrows in his direction, cementing Draco’s newfound belief that Muggle teenagers weren’t any less fuckers than magical ones.
Click.
After that there was his aunt, and Granger screaming. And screaming. Screams that curdled blood. Draco faced the wall and didn’t move. Coward. He thought of the boys in the dungeons, listening to their friend’s screams. He wasn’t behind bars but trapped all the same.
Draco didn’t need to hear more, he knew what the other boy meant. I want to stay out of it, you are not welcomed here.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
And then he dies, Draco avoided clarifying, confident that badly written romances didn’t end like that. And wasn’t real life just splendid!
Draco knew that Longbottom was prepared for that eventuality, but as he stepped forward, chin raised and proud, he noticed a flicker of uncertainty in the other wizard’s gaze. He remembered his aunt gloating about the fate of Longbottom’s parents, how the Cruciatus had reduced them to empty vessels, and wondered if his schoolmate was afraid of how much his little stunt would cost him. He always thought the Gryffindor as weak and pathetic, but the boy in front of him, willingly subjecting himself to something that destroyed his family, was neither. He hope it wouldn’t be the Cruciatus.
Draco told them to go, to get out and this time for real. He needed his wand.
Potter gave him a funny look, then just shrugged in acquiescence, rising to his feet. Conscious that under no circumstances he could be left alone to do whatever the fuck the other boy had asked him to do, without giving away how suspiciously clueless he actually was, Draco panicked, scrambling to follow.
It was a week after, when they were together in the library, that he heard Harry’s laugh again. They were sitting at a long table, a few of them. His eyes had lifted involuntary to search for the origin of the sound. A sound that he could recognise everywhere. Harry was chatting to Macmillan, clearly amused. Their eyes met, and the Gryffindor smiled. And in that mundane moment, just a normal instant of an everyday, it hit him. He stared at the other boy’s open face. His boyish, soft, beautiful face. His eyes widen, his pulse raced, and for the first time Draco noticed how Harry stood out even when the room was full. He adverted his gaze, not quite sure what to do with this new information. It was long before his heart slowed to its usual rhythm.
At Draco’s look of disbelief, he seemed to brace himself and sighed. “When I said I didn’t exactly have a conventional childhood, I meant it. I’ve actually spent years specifically not talking about this, but the last year has actually helped me come to terms with the fact that my experience wasn’t normal nor dismissable.”
“To happiness!”
Vincent and Greg were aiming at Potter, for the kill.
Draco stared and the vacated space for a long moment, feeling a free-fall of emotions. He had been furious at Potter, for assuming, for feeling so self important to believe Draco wanted to hear what he had to say, but Potter had said he was scared too. Potter, the boy that didn’t need to work for attention, the boy that jumped into near-death situations like his brain couldn’t really grip the concept of danger, the boy that to Draco’s chagrin survived circumstances that older and better wizards wouldn’t, was scared. Somehow, that validated Draco’s fear too, and for the first time from the beginning of his task he felt less alone.
“You know something,” Theo accused.
Draco was frozen. The other boy placed the Hawthorn wand awkwardly on the table next to the bread basket, brushing slightly on Narcissa, that had been looking at him all the time, in the process. Draco swore his mother and Potter exchanged a silent conversation.
Weasley yelped and gave Boot a grin “Are you really sure?”
“Side-along apparition, I took you to the Shrieking Shack and apparated us here.” He matched Draco’s incredulous stare with narrowed eyes “I know my way around the castle. And here is Cardiff, Wales. My home, I suppose”.
“No, Draco,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.”
After reaching the city centre Draco had to half-heartedly call a cab to his accomodation.
“She can be a bit meddling. Ellen, I mean.” Scott said, his mouth twisting in a grimace. For some reason, he too looked guilty. A set of keys dangled from his fingers and Draco averted his eyes, focusing on the gentle swaying of metal. He shrugged helplessly, unable to explain why he had jumped at the opportunity with the enthusiasm of a single mum meeting a pre St Mungo Lockhart, to then deflate like a jittery teenager.
Vincent laughed, shoving him off.
Luna smiled sadly “We know, we saw what you did. He would have liked it, his wand was quite precious to him”.
“Probably never” he sighed again, not denying what he knew was true.
“So you don’t even know if he is alive right now?” He spat, pondering on what he really wanted to ask.
I really wanted to call him Diego, but he wouldn’t let me.
I haven’t proof read it yet but I will later
Granger spotted him and cried “Malfoy, have you seen Harry? Neville! Neville, we are looking for Harry. He was with us but we lost him”.
Then Luna came next to Potter “Ready?”. The boy nodded and she smiled. “I will distract them. Go”.
“You don’t have to, you know”.
The prat looked uncomfortable, eyes fixed dully on his hands, where nails were scraping nervously at the cuticles in a manner that must have been painful. After a couple of minutes in which Draco had been left wondering what he had said wrong, the other boy finally mumbled.
“It looks like it. Evil is just not what it used to be” Harry pouted.
He looked at the tiny wizards and witches, in line for something more than simple grouping, and he knew that single instant sitting on the stool, so little and unprepared, would define them for the rest of their lives.
“You seem nervous”
“Sugar?”
Except I know, it won’t.
Unable to actually talk about Merlin and whatever twisted interpretation Muggles had on magic, Draco ventured on the other aspect of the Animation that had bothered him.
Draco watched frozen as curses flew around him for long seconds, until his wand was knocked off his hand and rolled under a cabinet. Wandless. Scared. Coward.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a last apprehensive look, the two Gryffindors left.
But April wasn’t time for raspberries and Luna was in his house and things had changed. The Dark Lord was busy elsewhere and the prisoners in the dungeons weren’t screaming so Draco could almost pretend they didn’t exist. Almost. He hadn’t dared going to visit Luna, not with his aunt roaming the place like a wild beast. They weren’t friends and they had no reasons to be. She was alive, he knew as much, and he could only hope that after months in captivity that wasn’t the worse fate. He knew from experience what a prolonged period in a cage, even one without bars, could do to one’s sanity.
“Gay?” Draco supplied, because he was. It felt liberating to say it out loud.
There was something, a bittersweet memory, but patience was stretching thin on both sides and someone had to give “Well. My mother, when I was little, she used to call me Dee. So, something like Dean I guess.” Like that Muggleborn Gryffindor that was banging the girl Weasel, Draco thought hysterically. His mother would be so proud.
“That was surprisingly decent of you”.
He could.
“Speaking of which. . .”
And that had been it, the only words his mother could spare for a cousin she no longer considered as such. “If he hadn’t been a blood traitor. If he hadn’t made the wrong choices.” She didn’t say, but Draco heard it anyway.
Yes, Draco thought, staring at the boy he was falling a little in love with, Luna always told the truth.
He bit down on his tongue, mentally cursing his stupid mouth and his stupid heritage, but the other boy looked simply amused.
Draco woke up at the uncomfortable feeling of the Dark Mark burning trough his arm. He was being summoned. He had fallen into a fidgety sleep so it didn’t took him long to be fully awake and receptive. He could hear Vincent and Greg stirring heavily in their beds. Of course, they knew. The Slytherin dorm was planned into a rectangular shape, 5 identical four posters lined one after the other neatly, with Draco’s the furthest from the door and Blaise’s the closest. Greg and Vince were crammed between Blaise and Theo and Draco knew they weren’t being courteous enough to think about their sleeping roommates. His suspicions were confirmed when he drew the curtains to stare at the ghostly white face of Theo.
He had never seen Bellatrix so terrified. The Dark wizard was growing more and more agitated and Draco knew that, to act now when it was so risky for his life, Potter must be into something very important. He could feel the momentum building, things were about to happen. The end was near.
He was running out of time. The “Finite” falling from his lips sounded like an apology. A prayer.
“The vial, Draco. Please”
“I was not home schooled!” Draco sulked.
Draco obliged and he found himself looking in bewilderment at a pair of tiny footprints wandering around the page, the name Narcissa Malfoy written in loopy cursive just below them. “What-“ his voice sounded scratchy, and he cleared the lump that had wedged itself into his throat before trying again “W-what is this?”
“Fuck Draco, you know what the Mark means!” Theo was almost shouting.
He could have loved Theo, maybe. In another life, when he was a week past his 17 birthday and allowed to be just a boy that thought with his dick and his heart. They could have conquered the world, the three of them, with Blaise’s charm and Draco’s poise and Theo’s quiet and sharp wit. The Slytherin’s throne, in the worst case scenario.
Draco spun around so quickly that he almost lost his balance again, but the boy that had entered the shop, half buried under a stack of crates, was not Potter.
As per usual, if any samaritan wants to correct my errors please let me know or point them out in the comments
“You know, you keep doing that.”
“Perfect.” And wasn’t it just. “I think it would be best to wait and give Harry’s memories back after his birthday, in case he does something that could be traced back to him.”
“I dunno, he sounds alright.” Potter called, already halfway to the kitchen, where he picked a box of dried food and started pouring it into a dotted bowl on the floor that Draco had completely missed earlier. “Glad to know you have already got me figured well enough to make a judgment, though”. Draco was relieved to notice his voice seemed simply amused.
Draco turned around to see Luna. A few feet behind her, stood a Hufflepuff boy, Macmillan, watching him with a look of distrustful curiosity.
“You should tell him” Luna commented with finality.
Is this absolute rubbish? Probably. But I had to get it out anyway. This year is getting the best of me and I am absolutely stressed out, so this is my way to distract myself.
He met Luna in the forest another time after that, by chance or because he saw her trotting down the path. He was going there, anyway. She had a second hooked stick, so maybe it wasn’t a chance after all, and they fed the Thestrals in silence. There were five this time, including the little foal. She parted wishing him a Merry Christmas, he looked at her and said nothing.
“Yes, I thought you knew. He said you knew! I met him a bit ago, he told me about the snake, he said you guys had a mission”.
Which, I am sure wasn’t shocking at all 😅
His mother sighed “You were just a boy, and under lots of pressure. If anyone, it’s my and your father’s fault”.
But the wizard’s words were interrupted by a terrible sound that seemed to come from all around them.
Anyway, here it is, enjoy and if anyone wants to correct my grammar please let me know.
Things were bound to go to shit.
He briefly wondered how psychotic it would have sounded if he demanded for the blasted thing to be kept in the air until he had had the time to adjust. The mere thought drew a hysterical laugh out of him, causing his dry lips to split painfully at the corners. His mind shifted to the last time he had water, for breakfast that morning, and he was still pondering on how to cast an “Aguamenti” without being caught when the plane touched ground with a few harsh judders. His teeth crashed into his bottom lip, sinking into the chapped flesh and filling his mouth with the taste of copper.
I think I am having a writer block so I hope this doesn’t suck as much as I fear it does. I think the problem is the huge quantity of dialogue and trying to make it run smoothly.
“Er. . . Yeah, well chrysanthemums in Australia represent mothers. They are often just called Mums. . . And we wouldn’t have won this war without mothers”. He had lifted his gaze and looked directly at Draco. They held each other eyes for a moment, before the Gryffindor broke contact “The red ones signify love and devotion”. The faint colour on his cheeks had lingered for a while.
“Yeah. . . ” Lupin lingered, as if trying to express something else with the silence. When it stretched almost too long, he pressed the bundle of clothes into Draco’s arms and looked away. “Goodnight then, we’ll talk tomorrow”.
“Draco, please, it was clear the message in that bottle was meant-“
“What? No perfect family life with a butler and a couple of maids?”
For a moment they stared at each other like two cats, teeth bared, but Draco’s traitor stomach growled and he had to concede defeat.
“It’s airplanes. And that idea sounds more tempting by the minute, seeing as I was discussing -You know what? It doesn’t matter.” His former Professor shook his head, tapping his fingers idly on the cover of the journal. “It’s going to be a huge cultural shock. . . Especially for someone like you.” He added, gesturing vaguely with the other hand in his direction. Draco nostrils flared. “I just want you to be ready.”
His Professor had knocked his head against one of the lacquered doors hard enough to leave a small indent, and was now massaging his neck with a confused frown. “Ouch. . . I don’t- I don’t understand” he winced, looking up at Draco with glossy eyes.
From this chapter the story should be a bit more interesting as they are not events properly described in the books. Its all from Draco’s prespective so we won’t really know what is happening to people he doesnt interact with but pretty much the same as in the books. I just changed the sectumsempra part and I will change what happens straight after the battle of Hogwarts.
“Hedwig is fine, and I will get her back as soon as Harry turns of age.”
Still, it was Potter’s against hundreds of other’s , and Draco could only think of bodies writhing in silent agony on the Manor dinner table, the final caress of snake teeth dancing across their ankles.
Draco had kissed him, then. Young, and sloppy, and a bit angry. They had kissed, and a little more, for the rest of the year, and then the year after. Alone. Always alone, Draco had been careful. Theo wasn’t happy, and Stephen knew he was gay, anyway. It was all that counted, for him. But Draco was scared, and had said no. Draco had said he thought Theo wanted his life easy, and Theo did. And kissing alone, at fourteen, was better than no kissing at all. So they did, until Draco had grown agitated, and angry and demanding, as his life spiralled out of his control. So it had been Theo’s turn to say no.
“I know, I just can’t help thinking about what could go wrong”. Lots of things could, Draco was aware, and his self preservation sense was ringing alarm bells so loud that he could barely hear his own thoughts.
A little smile tugged at his lips and he wanted to bask in this newfound lightness. He had barely gotten a taste, though, when Dumbledore’s voice pleaded softly, almost as if directed at him “And I need you one more time. When I’ll be gone, you need to find what happened to Harry. You need to find him. . .”
His eyes remained fixed on the harsh lights above him until it became painful. One of the little round bulbs was broken, dull, and for some reasons that bothered him immensely. Electricity, he scoffed unimpressed. Nothing in this fucking muggle world seemed to be going right. Just as he thought so, the two remaining bulbs started flickering until they burned out with a final sizzle, casting the kitchen in semidarkness. Draco could hear his heart pumping, could feel it beating against his ribcage like a mad bird. The floor was suddenly cold and he squirmed, scrambling up until the wall was behind his back, solid and supporting. He had always been in control of his magic, since he was five. Since forever. Long before most of the other kids and yet, here he was, frying fucking lightbulbs like a toddler.
As he felt the effects of the Felix Felicis subtly buzzing at the back of his mind, telling him that it was going to be ok, Draco turned nervously towards Potter and asked “So, what’s the Sword and the Stone?”.
Draco stood there, still smiling “Im glad i told them, I should have done a long time ago”.
Being raised in a traditional wizardry family Draco knew since childhood all about the importance of one’s wand. The intimate connection between a wizard or a witch and their wand was considered sacred and the moment they were allowed to get their first was something all magical children waited impatiently and excitedly for. When really young Draco had often admired his parents’ wands, running his little fingers reverently down the smooth wood. Both his father’s Elm one and his mother’s, made of Black Walnut, were fairly similar in length and colour, surely another sign that his parents were meant to be. Draco had found them very elegant and beautiful, especially his father’s, which was an heirloom and had been in the Malfoy’s family for many generations. When in the gardens, alone but for the watchful company of Splinter, he had often picked up the best sticks he could find and pretended to be his father, imagining the day when the legacy would be passed onto him. So, once the time had come to go to Ollivanders, albeit knowing it was likely a temporary arrangement until he would take his father’s place as the head of the Manor, Draco couldn’t wait to meet his wand. The wand that would assist him in performing his first spell and that would serve him trough most of his formative years. It was an important affair. And, as for all important things, Draco had been nervous. He had known what to expect but not what it would feel like because, as permissive and indulgent his parents were on many things, they were as strict and formal on traditions, so Draco had never held a wand before. He had touched a wand. He had yearned to just go for it and grab one, for an instant, maybe just his mother’s. Flick it, once. He had imagined he was holding one, refined and polished and lovely like it had to be. But he was raised to know better, to control his desires. 11 years old Draco had entered the gloomy shop of Garrick Ollivanders a virgin. The first wand had been a disappointment, and in the impatient mind of a child he had wondered if the whole experience was overrated. It had taken 4 wands before it happened. As soon as the hawthorn stick, lighter in colour than Narcissa’s and Lucius’s, simpler but equally sophisticated, had been placed into his left hand, Draco had known. It had been like being reunited with a part of himself that had been missing without his knowledge. His wand, that had waited years, patiently sitting on a dusty shelf, for him and him only. They were a match and Draco couldn’t imagine having any other. In that moment he came to respect the profound connection between a person and their own wand so much that he had never dared to touch another’s. Of course, in school he had bragged about all the magic he mastered at home as a child, but in truth the Hawthorn had been his first and only.
Since starting Hogwarts, summer had always been a bittersweet time for Draco. The Manor was huge, richly furnished and the grounds were stunning. Draco knew well that most of his peers envied him and during the school year he would often boast about his home with whoever would listen. The truth was, though, that after months in close quarters with people his age and with a freedom that only came from being away from the watchful eyes of his parents, he missed Hogwarts. The Manor was ancient and beautiful, not unlike his school, but there were no young voices populating the corridors, no one to share secrets and mischiefs with and, having no siblings or cousins, it felt empty and lonely. Even with his claims that Hogwarts was a second quality school, where the education level was somewhat lacking and where people less worthy were allowed to live and learn side by side with the more deserving ones, he considered the castle his second home, as it often happens when boarding.
Harry nodded. His left hand slid to the chain around his neck, twirling the little pendant between his fingers absentmindedly. An owl, eyes two round pools of glass.
Draco was shocked and felt the pull back into his own body, where he found himself staring into the blank face of the Gryffindor. After a short time Potter regained consciousness and for a while they just stood there looking at their feet and anything but each other.
Draco watched as the two remaining boys sat down, their feet grazing the water. They were staring at each other awkwardly, but both were grinning. Then, Boot reached for the other boy’s hand and intertwined their fingers.
He got a whiff of the stench before he saw the people. The strong odour of blood and dirt was out of place within the pristine four walls of the drawing room. Greyback. Draco had only ever seen the werewolf twice before, but he would never forget the scent of death that always seemed to accompany him. A small group of prisoners was being dragged into the room, bounded to each other, back to back. From his position on the armchair by the fireplace he could only spot the matted red hair of the tallest one. A quite tall one. Oh no. No no no. Draco swallowed.
“Uhm, no, I was thinking to stop here for a while.” He stammered, trying not to sound too eager. “I mean, yes, I would be. I am. Definitely.” He nodded, feeling his cheeks warm at his poor attempt to keep it together.
“You are fucking kidding me! If you think I am gonna change my name to Diego like I am some sort of cheap love interest in one of those hispanic radionovelas my mother listens to on the wireless, you have to be even more stupid than I thought. And the level was pretty high already.”
“Perhaps” she replied vaguely “but there is so much more, when you are willing to go beyond that”.
His aunt clutched tightly onto Granger and forced the boys to surrender their wands, asking Draco to pick them up.
Imagining it was his mother’s arms around him instead, Draco felt impossibly young. His fingers toyed with the zippers of the bag until they clutched the journal, caressing blindly the rough paper. His magic could sense the incantation binding Narcissa’s name to the pages, and he allowed the sensation to pervade his mind. The buzz of the charm sounded similar to a lullaby, and it was grounding and familiar. He wrapped himself in it like a blanket and emptied his mind.
Harry threw him a pebble “You are an idiot, Ron”. But he was smiling, too.
Theo looked between the two of them before deflating. He leaned on the wall, knocking his head backwards rather hard, and closed his eyes.
His heart was surely going to explode, he thought, while his mind unhelpfully pleaded: yes, please, help me, please. You can’t, but please find the way.
Snape and Yaxley were still discussing the informations they had gathered and Draco found himself watching his Professor. He didn’t understand how the man could speak so calmly about something that would lead to the death of one of his students. Yes, Snape notoriously didn’t like the boy and regarded him like a spoiled brat, but surely that wasn’t a reason enough to actively aid in planning his death. Draco reflected about the times he had wished Potter, and even Granger, a terrible fate based only of his great dislike for the other two students. Had Potter ever wished him dead? Would he have actively contributed in organising his demise? He didn’t think so. Draco had never before felt the urge to revaluate himself and he didn’t know what to think. At 17, his world had suddenly flipped upside down and he was now alone in his own head. He was so lost in thoughts that he jumped startled when a sudden wail of pain and despair came from the dungeons. He quickly try to regain composure as not to drawn attention to himself but the Dark Lord didn’t notice and addressed Wormtail instead “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?”.
In between the horrors, he had learned a few lessons.
Draco swallowed again, vaguely aware of the blood warming his fingertips, where his nails had dug into the tender flesh of his palms.
Potter head snapped up so quickly Draco was surprise it was still successfully attached to his neck.
“Splinter” The house elf bowed in front of him in a matter of seconds.
“How are things over there?” He dared to ask, knowing that the previous night had been the full moon.
Who knew that Harry Potter was. . . Well, that he kissed boys. Draco had spent his life disregarding his own sexuality, and there came the Gryffindor, kissing other boys like he ate his toast. In front of people. Draco had been thinking, obsessing, about it for a week. Finally, he had cornered the other wizard in an empty corridor.
He flexed his right hand a couple of times, relishing in the tingling sensation still left in his knuckles, where his fist had met the firm cartilage of Potter’s nose with a satisfying crack. No doubt the Gryffindor’s nose had been broken and, for the first time in his life, he damned magic for how easily it could vanish the traces of their confrontation from the other boy’s face. There had been something deeply gratifying in the physicality of throwing a punch. The sadistic part of him wanted to see the reminder of his little victory lingering on Potter’s stupid features, for days to come.
“No I do.” Harry said quickly. “I was just over thinking things like an idiot. I’m not sure exactly what you had in mind… I just- I just want to make it good for you.”
“Anyway, enjoy your dinner and I’ll catch you later.” Harry said, making Draco look back up at him.
“She’s got a boyfriend apparently.” George said a bit bitterly with his mouth still half full. He finished his mouthful and sighed. “What’s the point in being a war hero if all the pretty witches are taken?! I didn’t even have time to tell her the story of how I tragically lost an ear protecting the great Harry Potter!”
Doing his damndest to ignore Blaise’s knowing looks, he quickly turned away, making his way back to Slytherin. He was gonna go find a bed and hopefully wake up 6 years in the past when Harry Fucking Potter was none of his concern.
Please, forgive me.
Things between them were good. They were friends, and Draco realised he was happy that way.
Howdy peeps! I know this took time, but in the meanwhile I made a tumblr page called InconsequentialMania if you want to check it out. Also, this is the chapter before the last (there will be an Epilogue, also). I can’t believe I’ve almost finished something. Continuity has alway been my weakness.
Draco wanted to reach out, to touch Theo too. But physical contact between the two of them had only ever been adolescent fumbling in dark corners, while Draco had set rules and kept his mind half alert, afraid to be caught. And while Blaise stroke his hair naturally, as a friend comforting another, Draco didn’t know where his boundaries with Theo laid. Where a touch would be uncomfortable rather than soothing. So he just talked instead.
But his eyes locked with Theo’s washed out blue, and Theo was crying, pointing a trembling finger at him “You killed him! You killed him! I told you, Draco, not to go too far.”
He was homesick.
“You dont have to say it” She interrupted.
No resistance. “How? With so little time and strength, why put all this effort in keeping the others out?” Draco found himself wondering while he felt his body slipping from reality, a cold shiver travelling from his hand right through his core.
She came back about ten minutes later, carrying a tray and a jug of water. He watched avidly as she lowered a plate stacked with pancakes and strawberries in front of him, the delicious smell of warm food filling his nostrils.
But, Potter was a constant in the peripheral vision of every single person in the whole damned school, whether willing or not.
Draco was right, they were after Potter.
He swallowed, but kept his chin raised and his cards exposed. He was aware of being on the wrong side of the blade, but Lupin seemed too Gryffindor to notice or to abuse his own power.
Weasley was shaking his head, laughing “Well, as long as you have stopped going after my family. That’s all I am saying”.
“Eves, this is Dean. Dean, Evie. Or, Eveline- ouch!” Scott interjected, rubbing at his calf where Potter had landed a kick. “He is here for Allie’s room.”
He was still feeling nervous when the other boy joined him.
Click.
Now that he had Harry alone he wasn’t really sure what exactly he wanted to say. He stepped closer, careful not to alarm the other boy of his presence and taking advantages of his unawareness to observe him better. This year, Harry seemed uncharacteristically concerned with his studies and Draco thought that the lack of a threat looming over his shoulders, making the future a probability more than an uncertainty, might be playing a role in his newfound commitment. From his standpoint Draco could only see him from the back but the messy stack of books and a half written transfiguration essay at his left told him the other boy was not simply basking in the sun filtering trough the window. He was sitting on the rather large bay of one of the massive windows opening the wall of the unused section of the Fourth floor. His head was bent forward in concentration and Draco could hear a soft chanting of incantations, almost whispered in a strange lulling way. A clicking sound and a small cry of triumph broke Draco from his dazed state and Harry suddenly spoke
“I don’t see how what I do is any of your business, Theo.”
The last few hours into the early morning had passed alternating between counting the mould stains dotting the ceiling and flipping idly through the journal’s blank pages, almost but never allowing himself to stop at the first page. He missed his mother dearly and, part of Draco, felt like he had already spent his time mourning her loss without having a proper closure.
Absolution.
Potter gestured for him to come closer to a richly carved basin sitting inside the cabinet next to the vials one.
“Talk of the devil!” She reiterated and Draco stared uncomprehendingly, a growing suspicion he had gotten it all wrong. The boy lowered the crates on the counter, but even before seeing his face Draco had known those tight brown ringlets did not belong to the one he was looking for.
He tossed it to Draco, who couldn’t help but catch it, before turning to tidy the mess he had made all over the floor.
“Err. . . Yeah, I think we should start, they can add ideas as they come. Uhm, any suggestion?” Longbottom sounded unsure but all the heads turned to him in rapt attention. “Professor Sprout will help us procuring the plants we need, and Flitwick has some great charms to make them bloom all year around he can teach us.” He continued with more confidence “I think we should collect ideas on what species we would like to see in the Gardens first, then we can work around design and placement”
It was Draco’s turn to blush. The other boy observed him for a long moment, and then said seriously “If you asked me a year ago if I was afraid of the future my honest answer would have been yes. . . I was afraid of losing someone again. . . Afraid of Teddy and being unable to love him like he deserves; afraid of what I was going to do with my life. . . Hell, Draco” he murmured, voice getting quiet, barely a whisper “I was almost afraid to live, after death was so peaceful”.
They had all gathered on the grounds in front of the Gardens, pupils and teachers alike.
“Yes. She apologised. . . And that’s why I’m here. I wanted to apologise, too. . . To you.”
“Of course, my Lord,” his father replied hastily . His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”
The Sword In The Stone was ridiculous. Draco scraped the remaining popcorn from the bottom of the bowl, grimacing as the stray kernel he hadn’t noticed crunched under his teeth, and pondered how to convey his opinion without giving away what he really thought of such inaccurate portrayal of human transfiguration.
Draco was left alone, whatever scathing retort dying on his lips, shaken by the parting words of a stranger that, with so little effort, wished him more than he had ever dared to wish for himself.
Thanks for reading and if it’s gibberish (my favourite english word) let me know.
And then he was running, one step after the other.
“Why are you being a dick?” Harry asked, more curious than angry.
When his bag disappeared inside the small, beeping tunnel, his hands spasmed with the need to reach out and snatch it back. He tried to regain composure, glancing around to see if any of the burly men in uniforms around him had noticed his “escaped from Azkaban” act. The guy sitting at the desk simply looked bored, eyes fixed on the square metal box in front of him wistfully. The other two guards were engrossed in a nonsensical conversation about someone’s neighbour Bill and what sounded like a goat. Even when Draco hurried suspiciously fast under the security arch, rubbing his sweaty palms against his jeans and aware he must have appeared for all intents and purposes like someone with a secret, they barely spared him any attention. And yet, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that all eyes were pointed on him.
“You spent the last 72 hours lecturing me on how they are not that much different from us. How difficult can it be? I am not an idiot”.
“I see” he said, kindly “you are afraid to act until they join you”
As predicted, Potter and his gang arrived on Wednesday. They were already outside, in the piece of land that stretched beyond Dumbledore’s grave, between the greenhouses and the lake. It was a peaceful place, quiet and big enough for their project. Draco was observing from the side the debate on the benefits of fountains becoming more incensed.
He was already full to the brim.
When Scott came back to his side and asked with a smile “Ready?”, Draco wasn’t sure he was ready at all.
Why do you see them? He wanted to ask, but that was personal.
How had his life turned from an uncertain future to a reality of adolescent problems and dickhead friends, only Merlin knew. But Draco wouldn’t have it any other way.
“An English one, at that” Draco said, aiming for haughtily when he really wanted to die inside.
“That was an amazing piece of magic” was his last thought before he was standing in what had once been Dumbledore’s office.
“Enough” said the Dark Lord, stopping the hilarity, and Draco released the breath he was holding. The world had gone fuzzy and he could barely make out words about trees and pruning. The forest, his mind provided, I wish I could be in the forest. Green, dark, hiding. His heart was a drum in his chest, regular, fast. Thump, thump, thump. A rhythm, like steps on the wild ground, running. A steady pace. Step, step, step. Thump, thump, thump. Slowing down. Thump. Pause. Thump. His breathing regulated, his pupils shrunk back, and he was abruptly jolted back to reality.
“No, of course. There is a small toilet just to the right of the staircase. I. . . Uhm, I need to warn you there are anti-apparition wards in the house, so you know. . .”. His eyes drifted awkwardly to a spot just a few inches away from Draco’s left hand.
That year, Luna’s birthday fell on a Saturday. Having turned of age in the dungeons of the Manor, with the lone company of a tattered Ollivander and a few wandering bugs, her friends were adamant to assure her 18th would be full of positive memories. Luna had smiled, with that nonchalant levity of someone able to see the positive in every situation.
“You named your cat Ron?” What. The. Fuck.
Potter had shaken his hand, he registered hysterically, before telling himself to get a grip already.
He rolled his eyes, trying to shake the lingering sadness away “Very Mature. No way I’d be caught writing in this thing”.
“My brother was 21” Theo replied harshly , and Draco knew that bitterness wasn’t addressed at the Gryffindor.
“No” Theo disagreed “I think you waited for the right moment. Neither you or them were ready, before.”
“Uh, yeah. Hi, I am Harry Potter”
Chewing on the tender skin between his fingers and nails until raw was a habit he had developed during summer and one his mother would have been appalled at, had she not been absorbed in other matters, like his impending death sentence.
Be proud of who you are, my darling, and this time I don’t mean as a Malfoy, but of the young man you have become. Your father and I are.
Draco felt like the time he used to hate Harry Potter belonged to another life, one that was long gone.
“Oh?”
Once in his room he slipped into Potter’s t-shirt, set an alarm for 5 am on his wand and inhaled half a dose of Dreamless Sleep, praying Salazar would let him wake up ten years in the past.
“So. . .” He started, trying to defuse the anxiety “as many of you know, I am Draco Malfoy, and I could be considered the anti-hero in comparison to our friend Potter over here”. He saw Blaise rolling his eyes at his dramatic introduction. But Draco could do this, he could talk in front of people. The other students were regarding him as I he was crazy and for a moment he felt what it must be like to be Luna. Harry, on the other side, was looking at him with an interested twinkle in his eyes. Yes, Draco could do this. “I want to share my experience, because as Harry said, we have a lot to learn from our mistakes. And I made plenty. My first mistake was to think I was better. Life proved me wrong many times, and it felt like a slap on the face every single one. . .Don’t raise your future children telling them they are perfect, that they are better. Make them feel special, say that you love them. Admit their strong suit but don’t make them feel like they need to hold it against others”.
On his way, he saw a bucket of dead rats just outside Hagrid’s hut. An idea flashed in his mind and he quickly aimed an Accio at it.
Suddenly the entire situation felt so surreal that Draco relaxed, tension leaving his limbs as he sagged against the sofa. When his body regained control he felt the uncomfortable pressure on his bladder and took the opportunity for a brief escape.
“I am not afraid” he snarled, wand raised but the curse wouldn’t come. “it’s you that ought to be scared”.
Draco was starting to feel overwhelmed and a bit confused. He hadn’t expected the felix felicis to immediately drop Potter into his lap but, with an hour gone and no signs of the other boy, he couldn’t help thinking he was wasting his time. As soon as he thought that, the potion in his blood hummed and he was once again pervaded by a calming sense of reassurance. He was thirsty, after all, and the cool temperature in the little cafe was a pleasant break from the heath outside.
“Your dislike for James and his friends is clouding your judgment.” Draco shifted in discomfort at the reproach but Snape seemed unfazed.
And Harry was just a child, with the same threat that had taken his family away 15 years before, looming over his shoulders.
He could sense Theo’s stare boring into his skull and that was all it took for his feet to start moving.
“People change, Draco, especially at your age. And people heal. But you need to live and take risks to show that you are different and move forward”. She took his hand and fixed his eyes with her blue ones. “What do you think is going to happen, if you bury yourself in the Manor? In this house, that still stinks of horrible times? In your room, where all those memories will come back?”
So that was the prophecy over which his father was now rotting in Azkaban. It didn’t make sense, Draco thought wildly. Neither can survive. It was worded in such a strange way, it almost sounded as. . .
“I missed it, as well. You’ve always been part of my life, and I can’t imagine it any other way”. He said, meaning every word.
What had his life become.
That day, not so long ago, he would have begged the mudblood for a sip.
Harry looked vulnerable, but held Draco’s gaze.
She yelled something about one of her weird creatures and with a swift motion Potter pulled something on top of his head and vanished.
“I don’t keep tabs on Potter’s whereabouts. Something you don’t seem to have qualms about, Theo” he said, instead. Both Vince and Blaise sniggered at that, although it felt to Draco as for two completely different reasons.
“I can guess. There is nothing i can do”.
“Listen, Malfoy, you came here looking for a reason to forgive yourself. Your family, I think that’s your reason. You chose each other, at the end. . . Your parents chose you, and you did most of what you have done for them. Dumbledore was adamant about the importance of Love. And that’s it. For Snape it was the love he felt for my mother, for Dumbledore the one for his sister. . . As soon as there is some sort of Love, there’s your opportunity for change. Voldemort never knew what it meant, and never sought it, so he was doomed. You grew up in a family were your parents loved you, and loved each other. You’ll be fine”.
Harry’s eyes were a little glossy when he raised his glass of orange juice in a mock toast. “To new chances, I suppose.”
He sat down next to Draco and they watched as the Gryffindor tilted his head to give his companion a brief kiss.

From there to his final destination was a rather quick trip in comparison. The smooching couple next to him was too busy staring into each other’s eyes to pay him any mind, which served Draco just fine.
Yes, Draco knew a wand was personal, so he looked down at the rumpled body lying on the floor, and couldn’t do it. In the middle of a battle, defenceless and in need of a weapon, he couldn’t do it. Even in the name of survival, even when the person in front of him wouldn’t need it again anyway, he couldn’t get himself to take something so important. It felt wrong.
“I don’t know. It’s the Mark, I think —“
No, no, no, don’t tell me what I am, you know nothing, Draco thought, I have to do this.
People were rushing outside and he didn’t want to go, didn’t want confirmation. They were screaming, Potter was dead.
At the same time Draco though that Lily was changing Snape’s mindset. He saw the boy growing conflicted, while his feeling for his friend grew stronger. He saw them being sorted into different houses, their path separated by more than two tables. He saw his own father sitting beside Snape, proud of his colours, welcoming the new member. Despite being were he had hoped to be, the little boy’s eyes were sad. He though again about how the sorting was a way to unite but at the same time to divide. Then, he remembered Macmillan, telling Creevey’s parents about him. Luna, feeding Thestrals in the forest while talking to him like a friend. Potter, accepting his request without second thoughts. And maybe the separation was only in people’s mind, and the war did change some things for the better.
