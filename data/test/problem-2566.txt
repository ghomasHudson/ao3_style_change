"I've never seen jeans and flip-flops look so sophisticated," he says. "The t-shirt is a nice touch. Green. How Slytherin."
“Merlin, no. I’ll admit, of all people, I wouldn’t have picked the Ferret for you, but Mum’s absolutely nutty over him.” He shrugged. “Doesn’t seem to matter so much anymore, you know,” he raised his fingers to make air quotes, “’Weasley’, ‘Potter’, ‘Malfoy’. We’re sort of all the same now, aren’t we?”
Harry gives a little shake to focus on Malfoy's words as he sits back down. "Cook? You have a house-elf named Cook?"
"I don't know why you're here, Mr. Potter, and I'm not sure it's something I need to understand. But for whatever reason, either the Manor or your own magic has brought you to us. You came in through our wards with no trouble at all, and I cannot discount that. This house sees you as family." Harry hears Malfoy suck in a breath, but he doesn't look over at him. "So, if it's sanctuary you seek, we will do our best to ensure you have it." This time, her smile is bright and wide, and more welcoming than he ever thought possible. She inclines her head regally and steps forward with a small curtsy. "We are honored to have you, Mr. Potter. May we provide you safe haven for as long as you need."
"You're more than welcome. Enjoy your afternoon, Harry."
"It's alright, Ron," Draco said from the stairs. "Let him in."
Molly smiled in the way of all wise women. It was a look he’d seen grace his mother’s face often. “No difficult conversation should ever take place without the comfort of a cuppa, dear.”
Malfoy swallows and licks his lips. "Wh-what do you need?"
Draco shrugged off his coat and pulled out the beribboned bottle from the inside, offering it to Molly with a smile.
Harry's head is swimming now with all the possibilities that are open to him, with all the ways that he and Draco can come together. It's a bit dizzying, and altogether perfect, and Harry reels against the thought. It's more than he ever could have hoped for.
"I know, and it ended up sending you to Switzerland. And I think we can both agree that was a mistake."
“Granger,” he replied. At least his voice sounded steady. He cast a glance at the gold ring on her left hand. “Or is it ‘Granger-Weasley’ now?”
"Look at me."
Harry leans closer, lips almost brushing, as he frowns. "In the future, a 'Yes, Harry' shall suffice."
Hermione's brow scrunched. "I'm sorry, Draco, I thought you and he had discussed this. It didn't seem out of the ordinary, and I didn't question him further, so it was all drawn up." Draco stared at her, feeling the angry flush creep up his neck.
He lets go of the frame and crawls around on all fours to Draco's front. His eyes flick upward to find Draco staring down at him. His pupils are blown wide with desire, face flushed from his cheeks down to his chest. Sweat drips down between the defined cut of his torso to pool and drip from the hollow of his navel. His cock is dark and red, rock hard and leaking. He seems a little surprised to see Harry on his hands and knees in front of him, as if it is the one place he can't ever imagine Harry deigning to be.
Potter licked his lips and replied without hesitation. “The thought of fucking you does.”
"Tomorrow night. My room. Nine o'clock."
“Three barely squares has helped me maintain my girlish figure, Potter. Now, if you would be so good as to bite me, we can get on with this farce and get the hell out here.” Draco raised his left arm, but dropped it as the Dark Mark came into Potter’s view. He had made such a habit of ignoring it on his own skin that his brain simply didn’t see it anymore, but Potter’s eyes darkened at its appearance. “Apologies,” he sniffed, raising his right arm. “Is this less uncomfortable?”
"And we'll honeymoon in Provence. I love Provence. It's the French I can't stand, but I love Provence."
"That's it? Years of animosity to get to first names and all I had to do was ask?" He sounds sanctimoniously perplexed.
"They're pregnant, you idiot! It's not just about me! They're going to announce it, and they want you there!" Draco yelled.
As Draco leaves to go about his day, Harry smiles to himself.
"Damn it, Hermione! Tell me!"
Three weeks passed where Draco spent little time with Potter, save the every other night feed where Potter knocked on his door and stared at his feet and scratched at the back of his neck until Draco let him in. And that only lasted a few perfunctory minutes with a handful of gestures and nods between them. Potter ate, got hard, and went on his way. It dawned on Draco that this awkward dance between them was a bed of his own making, but he refused to be the first to budge. As Potter made no move to articulate an apology, Draco made no move to elicit one from him. Silence was easier than arguing.
Ron looks to Harry. "Did you know about this?"
"What? You're not staying?" Draco's surprise makes Harry's heart clench.
“Stop fidgeting! And for Merlin’s sake, fix your tie!” Draco hissed. “It’s bad enough I have to face these people, who have every right to AK me where I stand, but I will be damned if I have to do it with you looking like you’ve been trampled by a herd of wild hippogriffs!”
"For kissing?"
Because Harry says.
"Screw the fucking risk, Harry. There is no risk in refusing to love him because you're afraid to lose him. And that's exactly what you are doing. You'll open your eyes to discover he's gone, and you'll have to live with the knowledge that you could have changed it.
Draco swallowed. “Have Kreacher bake you one. He’s no slouch in the kitchen.”
"That's an interesting way of putting it," she said, rising to her feet. Draco's lips pursed when he realized she was referring to the initial reason he was here at Grimmauld in the first place, rather than her efforts on behalf of himself and Severus and their new potions business.
"Enlighten me," Potter growled.
That blond head dips again, seductive and sly, and his eyes sparkle like starlight. Draco's tongue makes a slow swipe across his bottom lip, making it glisten a rosy pink in the low light of the room. He whispers, but it sounds like a siren in Harry's brain.
"Of course I refused him," Potter spat. "I've spent my whole life being at the mercy of other people's prophecies and decisions. I'm done with that. Whatever I am now, I am my own. Silvestri wants me by his side and under his thumb. Two places I have no desire to be. It's been that way from the beginning. I told him that straight off. And when he realized I wouldn't do what he wanted, he cast me out. He told the Ministry I had refused him, of course not giving them all the facts, and because he has such control of the Council, no one there would dare go against anything he said. Basically, it boils down to the petulant whinging of an arrogant man who didn't get everything he wanted." Potter's lips quirked. "It seems I'm destined to be saddled with those forever."
"Everything that happened between us was consensual. Soberly and knowingly consensual. I took it because I thought I deserved it. His sin was my atonement."
Draco's been on his knees in front of a cabinet like this before, Harry's sure of it, but this time is an entirely different context. His body seems to recognize that, because the slight tremble Harry sees is one of pleasure—not fear.
He swings again, several times in succession, all across the tight curves of Draco's arse. Draco moans, burying his head in his bicep, panting out his pleasure. Harry pauses at intervals to run his hands over the reddened, hot flesh, kneading and caressing, letting his fingers soothe Draco into a contented hum. He follows up with flat smacks to Draco's flanks, then moving to let the end of the crop tease up Draco's trembling thighs. He nudges at the low, swollen hang of his balls, bringing the shaft under to press into the hollow of where they meet Draco's cock.
The full-on blush that stains his upper body at the praise makes Harry's mouth water. He accepts the proffered items and gestures for Draco to stand. He grips the crop by the handle and points it to the table in the center of the room.
as the felt the last of Potter's tension leave his body. He'd asked for Potter's ferocity, asked for the blinding, burning heat of his touch, and now Potter was giving him exactly what he wanted.
Harry smirks in spite of himself. "Goodnight, Draco."
“I don’t think it’s as out of your reach as you might think.” Potter tilted his head to the side and studied him, as if he were a puzzle that somehow needed to be solved.
Harry’s voice was rougher around the edges, jagged with thirst. She knew the Ministry had kept him here for days, and without the blood he needed to sustain him, was growing weaker and more testy by the hour.
"There were attempts…" Potter whispered, his face open and heartbroken. "Even after I became this."
The desire in Draco's eyes reflects the simple truth. He wants this. He wants Harry.
Potter was on him, all lips and tongue, and his hands wasted no time, seeking skin through the layers of his clothing. The cloth of his shirt rent under Potter's greedy fingers as he ripped the fabric away to lay hands on Draco's torso. Draco groaned, lost and drowning, into Potter's mouth as rough hands moved lower, reaching for the flies of his trousers. Draco grunted as he was propelled back by the force of Potter's kiss, and the moment his lower back touched stone, the horror of their location reared up and screamed in his brain.
"You going to see her again?" Harry asks, even though he already knows the answer.
Malfoy holds the arm to his chest as if he's been burned, and replies with a vehement force that lacks anything resembling heat. "Maybe it bothers me for you to look at it."
Harry licked his forefinger, fangs peeking out from beneath his lip and turned another page. “That’s what I said.”
"Again," Harry says with a smile, "where's the problem?"
Harry snorts out a breath and huffs out a short laugh as he shoots his eyes to the ceiling. It seems the house isn't through with him yet.
. There's something missing in his life that has seen fit to bring him to us. To you." Her hands are warm on his skin, and Draco can feel the heat pressing into his bones like her words are pressing into his ears. "He is not complete. And neither are you. But you could be, my darling. Be the half that makes him whole."
“Fucker.”
"I won't stop there," Harry continues, and the deep timbre of his voice makes his next words sound like a commandment more than a promise. "No, before I'm done with you, I'm going to know what every inch of your skin tastes like. Inside and out. I bet if I flipped you over right now and stuck my tongue in your arse you'd come like a faucet."
Narcissa's hand lifts of its own volition and she finds herself tracing the ink with a reverent finger, because she's never ever experienced anything this visceral outside Draco's birth. Nothing that has ever made her want to touch and keep touching, until the feeling is soaked into her fingertips and fused with her blood.
"Say it."
Draco's lips tightened with haughty affront. "I can still have Weasley throw you out."
Draco's gaze swivels from the rack to Harry, back and forth like a metronome, keeping the same beat as the blood pumping through Harry's veins. He takes a deep breath, centers himself to focus his mind, and then exhales slowly.
"Trust me," he murmurs against Draco's lips. "Do you trust me?"
“I seem to remember you had a ravenous sweet tooth. Your mother sent you sweets to Hogwarts all the time.”
"Harry." Neville's face lights up as he follows Blinky into the parlor.
Lust. Pleasure. Pain.
"Shh," Neville responds, putting a finger to her lips. "It's okay. You don't owe me an explanation. Not now. Not ever." His tender smile and quiet strength is almost too much to bear.
Draco blinked twice and opened his mouth to say something, even though he had no idea what, because, really, what could you say to that? But Potter Apparated them with a pop before his mouth clicked shut.
As soon as he stood upright, Draco knew exactly where he was, and the breath left his body as he stared at Malfoy Manor, bathed in the distance underneath the soft shadows of moonlight.
Draco seized Potter by the face and crushed their mouths together with force. Potter’s body slid forward to press against him, and his mouth opened at the first hint of Draco’s tongue. Draco licked his way inside on a rush of fire, swallowing Potter’s groan of approval. His hands slid from Potter’s cheeks to tangle in the ridiculous nest of his hair, threading his fingers through the thick, soft strands to clutch tightly and hold Potter close while he ravaged his mouth.
Draco snorted. “Bollocks. That’s
He can calculate the time it takes for Malfoy's expression to wane back into a mask in mere seconds. It's a start. A small one, but a start all the same.
"Stay seated, Harry," she says. "There's no need to move. All is as it should be."
Ron groans again. "What am I going to do, Harry?"
The tension was back in Potter’s face and he said sharply, “I don’t go out in sunlight.”
As soon as his feet touched the floor, Draco jerked himself out of Potter's Apparition hold, putting distance between them. He pulled off his coat with quick, violent movements, not sparing it a glance as he tossed it over the back of the sofa. Potter moved to take a step, mouth open, but Draco stopped him with a raised finger.
She shook her head, "No, I—"
Draco felt Potter stiffen, but he managed a smile for Molly. “No, thank you, Molly. I’m rather enjoying the company.”
"It's not that simple, I can't—"
Draco’s hand came up to rub absently at his chest in response. Potter noticed the gesture and stepped forward, taking Draco’s hand. His fingers were light and cool, and Potter’s thumb rubbed over his flesh almost like a caress as he turned it over and placed the wand in his palm. Magic tingled on his skin, and told himself it was the wand recognizing him after all this time. It certainly couldn’t be from Potter’s touch.
And with that, he was gone, the soggy slap of his bare feet and a trail of water following him out of the room.
The shock of Draco's platinum hair gleamed in the threads of moonlight, the rest of his body pliant and limp against the folds of Silvestri's voluminous robes. Draco's head was tilted back as he stared up at Silvestri's face with glassy grey eyes. His advance halted at the sight of Silvestri's long, taloned fingers stroking down the length of Draco's neck.
Torches flared to life as Draco walked inside, the magic recognizing and accommodating the bloodline. Inside, the crypt spread out endlessly, a marvel of Wizarding space, and Draco walked quietly down the open row toward the back.
He turned his face, not wanting her to see his internal conflict made external by the shame he could feel coloring his cheeks. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then. Goodnight, ‘Mione.”
He was right. Potter had taken the risk, knowing that he could have come here and had the door slammed in his face. He took it knowing that his survival for the rest of his life could be in owl-delivered vials. He took it knowing that Draco might say no. Because Draco saying yes was worth the risk. Because Draco was worth the risk.
"Okay, then. See you later." Harry opens the door to his room and steps inside, when Malfoy lets out a low, deep breath. It sounds like another sigh, but one of frustration instead of weariness.
The arms of the chair creak under the squeeze of his hands, and Harry forces himself to relax.
It's clearly the right thing to say because Narcissa's face glows with approval. The fact that it's the absolute truth is simply par for the course. But she's slightly hesitant, if the miniscule tremble to her fingers is anything to by. He's good enough at this to know whatever's happened in Draco's immediate past (Switzerland) gives her reason to worry. Harry feels compelled to take his honesty one step further. "I don't know about Draco's previous relationships, but I think you should know that have no plans to hurt him. Now, or in the future. Even if we become nothing more than friends."
"You didn't kill anyone." Potter's voice was as tight as his jaw. Hard, sharp, and pointed.
“So, what? They kill him?” Ron snapped. “How is that justice?”
It's not the first time his sexuality has been on trial, Merlin knows. When he first came out as gay, the resulting backlash took almost a year to die down. And then when Owen came forward to the Prophet with his tell-all article on quote, "the Dark Side of Our Saviour", all hell broke loose. No one cared that Owen Redfield was a consenting partner to their bedroom activities, merely that the Great Harry Potter was a dominating top with a demanding streak. Of course the Prophet and the scheming Rita Skeeter would pounce on the opportunity to make Owen out to be an abused lover rather than the self-serving, Galleon-grubbing jackass that he is.
He stands up and grasps the crop just underneath the handle, trailing it over the welted curves. It begins to dip inward, closer to where Harry wants to bury his cock. He's a breath away from the dusky, furled hole when Draco freezes.
Draco steps forward, chin thrust into the air. "Maybe I know what I need more than you. Maybe I don't really care what it is you want. You don't want to be compared to him, fine. But you're still like every other Dom I've known. Give a man a little control, and he'll take it all. I won't be powerless anymore. If that means I'm alone for the rest of my life, I'll deal with it."
"Yes, Neville says he's done a bit of research, and we're going to delve further into the mystery of my silent roses." Her voice is even, but Harry can see a glimmer of excitement in her eyes.
Honestly, Harry had no idea what he would find when the door opened. He'd merely stood inside and offered up a few vague impressions of how he wanted things to go and left the rest up to the room. He certainly didn't expect this. Not that's he's complaining, because it's apparent the Manor is a great deal kinkier than he anticipated.
He lowered and then sprang back up. "Tea? Coffee?"
"You know, Professor," he replied smoothly, whipping off the sweltering robe. "I don't think I am."
Narcissa's brows knit together at the change of subject. "By magic, of course. I don't understand, what does that have to do with my being happy?"
Draco gasped against the image, gritting his teeth against a sob. "Anything," he moaned. "Anything you want, please! Please!" His voice broke on a high-pitched cry. "God, please,
"I promised not to—"
Draco jerks at that, seeking any kind of touch to his erection, anything that might provide that extra ounce of pleasure, that promise of relief. Harry whips at the backs of his thighs, then crouches to mitigate the sting with his tongue, darting over the raised lines with relish. He bites and licks at the rounded muscle of Draco's arse, moving swiftly. He doesn't linger, alternating at random to keep Draco on the edge for as long as possible.
Mesmerizing.
Harry scribbles his signature on the contract with a flourish, rolls it up, and ties it to Pennywort's outstretched leg. She wobbles a bit and inclines her head, waiting for the affection she thinks she is rightfully due. When Harry takes longer than she prefers to give her a good scratch, she snaps at him and ruffles her feathers. Big, round eyes blink back at him without apology.
It's volatile, unstable and terrifying, this feeling that's coursing through her. An onslaught of sensory input that she's not equipped to handle at the moment. Maybe she never has been, because no man has ever kissed her like this. Not even Lucius in his most passionate moments, which were few and far between and rarely ever meant for her specifically.
Draco's eyes go round and incredulous. "Your safeword?"
Draco lunged and pushed his face into Potter’s, ignoring the spray of water into his mouth and ear. “You need my blood, Potter! The heartbeat is just a bloody homing beacon for you. So you can come and drink your fill! So do it already!”
“Oi!” Ron protested, mouth gaping.
The rest of the day was spent under a great shade tree on the grounds, overlooking his mother's favorite section of the gardens. Hermione had packed along a picnic lunch, and they ate sandwiches which could have only come from Molly Weasley's kitchen on a soft blanket followed up with a surprisingly good bottle of Muggle wine. The small talk was easy and effortless, and when they lapsed into a companionable silence, she pulled out a book, and Draco reclined with his arms behind his head. He dreamed nebulous thoughts of laughter and flowers, of green eyes and a lightning bolt scar, and his mother's fleeting smile. It was the best day he could remember having, even before the war.
"I see. What, the Dom snaps his fingers, and the su—I'm just supposed kneel for you?" Draco's furious gaze cuts through to Harry, slicing over his skin. "You don't think this is pursuit? Throwing yourself at me and making me—" He stops, swallowing the last of his words.
terrible to be wanted to the point of violence."
"Darling, you certainly look…refreshed this morning." Narcissa's smile is broad across her face as she takes Draco in with motherly scrutiny. "Sleep well?"
Draco whipped his head around so fast he almost tumbled to the floor. “You have it? My wand?”
Harry gave the other vampire a moment to scream in frustration before he launched into an attack.
Draco straightens and moves to stand directly in front of Harry, hands clasped behind him as before. He is tall, long and lean, just miles and miles of flawless skin that Harry wants to get his hands on.
Draco's stomach did a flip, knowing that it only took the barest of touches from Potter to get him hard and wanting.
"What the bloody hell is this?" he exclaimed. "Why does Potter have a ten percent stake in the company?"
"Remember my words," Harry says. "Above anything, I value communication, honesty, and trust. Without those, this type of relationship will not work. I think you already know that, but putting it into action will be a challenge for you." Harry continues caressing Draco's neck. "I will help you with that. I will also require you stay. There are exceptions to that, of course. But unless you need distance, I'm keeping you from something, or I specifically ask you to go, I want you to stay. I like having my lover close to me."
Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to Hermione. “Don’t listen to him. We’ll be there. What time?”
"What about me?"
He is clean.
Draco rests his hands on the tablecloth as his eyes latch onto the arrangement of flowers in the middle of the table. "You did this for me, didn't you?" he asks, hands clenching into fists. "You asked Cook to make all my favorite things." He swallows hard as his eyes dart to the side. "This is some sort of reward for doing as I'm told, isn't it?"
A discreet cough sounded from the doorway, and Potter shifted, turning his back to the door, as if to shield Draco from the intruding presence. The sensation was strangely protective, and yet oddly pleasing, and the thought resonated through his bones that Potter would spend the rest of his life standing sentry between Draco and the outside world. As if it was right where he belonged. Potter’s face lifted, and as their gazes crossed, the look of irritated puzzlement etched across Potter’s furrowed brow told him the same thought had occurred to the vampire.
Harry wants to smile at the infantile indignation, but decides instead to play it straight. After all, that's what he wants. For Draco to understand that this isn't a game, it's simply who he is.
Harry watches him turn and walk away. Gone is the defeated slump Harry's been accustomed to seeing on Draco's shoulders. Just as he's about to cross the threshold, Harry calls after him, "I'll be waiting. Don't be late."
"Severus—"
Harry reaches out and claps him soundly on the back. He coughs and splutters, shooting daggers at his mother with his gaze through each hacking breath.
"You look good, mate. A hell of a sight better since last time I saw you."
“Harry, she wants to talk to Draco.” Hermione’s voice was insistent, but her eyes were tinged with trepidation, as if she couldn’t quite gauge how far to push. Draco had no doubt that she and the rest of the Weasley clan had been on the receiving end of Potter’s volatile vampiric temper.
Harry's mouth slides across Draco's chest, stopping to lavish attention on the tightened nubs, which wrings more of those delicious noises out of Draco's throat. His cock is as hard as Draco's, and it's becoming increasingly more difficult to keep his body from leaning in to press them together. He kisses up Draco's neck, letting his tongue trail through Draco's sweat and the remnants of his own saliva. It's a mixture that is uniquely theirs, and Harry wonders how the flavor will change with the addition of Draco's come.
A niggling part of his brain urges him to turn and look at Malfoy, really look at him. He's still pointy, but he's grown into his features, and now the sharpness is a point of admiration. His eyes are guarded and Harry wonders what has put that caution there. Malfoy's always been open and honest with his hostility; this man is subdued. Whether he's letting it simmer, or the real fight's been taken out of him is anybody's guess. He's shown he's capable of short bursts of outrageous emotion, but it's easily quelled, and Harry finds that incredibly appealing. So when the answer scoots from the back of his throat to the tip of his tongue, he's looking directly at Malfoy to gauge his reaction.
Silvestri's body jerked and flailed, eyes terrified and full of knowing fear.
“That’s just it,” she sighed. “He was. And then he started having trouble, and his position on the list was revoked.”
Draco swallowed. “She did?”
“I’m not a Malfoy.”
Potter closed his eyes and turned his face. "The risk—"
Draco tsked. "An inglorious end to the Malfoy line if ever there was. And here I have nothing to show for our matrimonial bliss other than a nasty cut on my neck."
“This is Walburga’s study. I’m going to be redoing this room, and there are some things in here I thought you might want, considering some of them are probably Black family heirlooms.”
"Potter, I seriously doubt my Hera would go anywhere near that brute of yours. He's a menace."
He stared at her a moment before closing his eyes and letting out a deep breath. This was it. His moment to grasp at freedom. Even if the price ended up being too great, at least he could say he had tasted it one more time. He snatched up the quill and signed his name at the bottom, feeling the magic twirl around him as he finished. It was done. He was Potter’s.
Before he could reply, a gentle knock came from the door and Potter stuck his head in. “Draco, Molly would like to speak with you if you’re done. She’s outside on the back patio.”
Silvestri's fangs were ghosting over Draco's skin, and Draco was so caught in the thrall he was shaking with want. One involuntary jerk and those fangs would pierce his skin.
Draco felt the snarl curling on his lips as his fingers curled in Potter's hair, twisting and painful. Potter let out a harsh curse of, "Fuck, Draco!" as Draco yanked his head back and shoved Potter to his knees with sheer force.
"Pl—please, Harry," Draco rasps. His hips thrust forward, but Harry leans back just in time.
OOOOO
of the cheery little elf, he'd bet good Galleons on it. He also can't help but notice this is probably the longest conversation he's ever had with Malfoy. As a matter of fact, he thinks this is the most he's ever heard Malfoy speak in general.
"Then I suggest you tell me what's really going on, because I don't remember in any of our conversations where you would be involved in my potions business in any capacity, much less a backhanded one. I know you think I belong to you, but this is taking things a bit too far, don't you agree?"
Draco could hear the self-satisfied smile in her response.
Malfoy licks his lips and groans, and Harry thinks he might slide right off the sofa. "Merlin, yes. She's a terror, but the blasted wretch makes a chocolate trifle you'd ride to hell and back for. Just don't piss her off. Otherwise, every meal you're served for a fortnight will taste like Hippogriff piss and give you the shits."
Potter stood and instead of walking to the door, stepped closer to the bed. Draco pressed back against the headboard and swallowed, unsure of what was about to happen. Potter reached out slowly and pulled the hand still resting across Draco’s chest away. His eyes flicked to the faint ridges of the scars, as one finger trailed over them. “I’m sorry,” Potter said softly, his eyes dim with remembrance.
“Andromeda and Bellatrix,” Draco supplied. “Long before anything, I think.” He sucked in a breath. “God, she looks happy. And Aunt Bella…she looks positively—”
“Even so,” Ron said, shaking his head sadly, “don’t you have to find someone who’s comparatively on Harry’s level magically? In case you hadn’t noticed, he’s pretty damn powerful, what with defeating Dark Lords and all.”
"First you make me wait, and then you subject me to terrible aphorisms?" Draco clucks. "I cannot abide such treatment."
Potter’s hand curled back to rest just below Draco’s hip, and he growled low in his throat.
The moment Harry spies the trajectory of Ron's wand, he places himself in front of Draco. "Have you lost your mind? Put your wand away!"
Ron frowned and bypassed Potter’s hand, dragging the man into a full-body hug. “You’ll not shake my hand like a bloody stranger, Harry Potter.”
Draco's tongue is moist and pink as it swipes over his bottom lip. Harry wants to suck it right out of his mouth.
Malfoy stiffens and drops his arm. "Let me show you to your room, Potter."
“No,” was Potter’s terse reply.
“Who else knows how to rile him up that way? And that’s what he needs-a challenge! Something to keep his interest.” The low tones made it difficult to place her voice, but ‘Kingsley’ set off alarm bells in Draco’s brain.
“He’s vampire, Hermione,” Draco cut in. “He’ll always be dangerous. But, I don’t think he quite knows what to do with himself yet. Not with the bond. He’s used to doing whatever the bloody hell he wanted and now he’s got to think of someone else.”
"Don't," Draco says roughly. "I know you lost people, too. I know my grief isn't any more special than anyone else's."
It may be a terrible cliché, but goddamn if he's not hard in jeans anticipating what it's going to be like when he finally gets his lips on Draco Malfoy the way he wants to.
Draco bites back a small gasp and his arms flex. Harry has no doubt his fingers are curling into his palms behind his back.
Harry scoffs as he sits, "Don't even start, Nev."
Draco stood at the bottom of the stairs, getting his first glimpse of Potter in three long months. He was unsure of what to expect, but one thing was certain: Potter looked
Draco looked down at his t-shirt and jeans. "I'll admit they're not the most bespoke of garments, but really Severus, they're quite comfortable."
It's scary how perceptive Ron really is. It's what makes him so good at his job, Harry thinks. He doesn't have to expound on it, but he doesn't have to deny it, either.
He wants to repay Narcissa for her unerring kindness, and after remembering the painting in the library, Harry decides exactly what he's going to do. He needs old photos for reference and mood, and just as he pushes back from his work table, there's an audible
A hint of a sad smile crossed the vampire’s lips. “Another tangible reminder of extremely poor decision-making?”
It’s far too charming and sincere to be anything but, and Draco feels only slightly guilty at his outburst. But only slightly. Potter apologizes for the deceit in getting him to return to England. He says he was against it from the start, and that Draco should have been approached differently. Potter’s face is nothing but earnest and incredibly handsome and it hits Draco at his core. Draco wants to believe it’s not Potter’s good looks and genuine nature that has him asking how he can help. Outside of talking to his father, of course, because that’s not happening. Period. End of story. Dealbreaker. Back to France before you can blink, Potter. But even though he wants to believe it isn’t, he knows it is.
Her lips pinch together. She doesn't like to be called out. Never has.
"If you've got a moment, would you come upstairs, please?"
"I can admit that I miss you, too, but—"
Harry steps back and gives him a thorough perusal. When he finds his voice, he puts every last inch of steel into it.
"Mr. Potter," she says, casual as you please, her right hand slipping atop Malfoy's with a gentle nudge. Malfoy drops his arm a second later. "What an unexpected surprise." Her voice is crisp and breathless, with a hint of wariness around the edges. "I wasn't aware of a scheduled Auror visit, or have we reverted back to impromptu inspections? Although I must say, even on those visits we said our greetings at the front door."
The fact is so bracing, Draco has to turn away, as if he can escape the memory it dredges up. Fear, thick and cloying, like the smoke of Fiendfyre.
Draco sat up and braced his hands on his knees against the sudden rolling of his stomach.
Draco’s hand slowed, drawing out Potter’s orgasm, teasing him through the aftershocks. Potter twitched with a groan and rolled to the side, dislodging Draco’s hand. Heavy breathing filled the silence of the room, and Draco felt his skin prickle with the familiar tingle of a Scourgify, even though Potter hadn’t said a word.
"Two?"
In seconds, he had Potter's face between his hands and crushed their mouths together on a frantic kiss. Potter clutched at him for support and Draco pulled back, panting.
There's a bellow from the Floo and the other man looks back and then to Draco again. "I've got to go, love. Duty calls. Remember what I said about the trust. The longer you put it off, the worse it's going to be."
"It's how I'm going to restrain you while I kiss you."
"Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy. I believe I will accept your gracious offer of hospitality."
"Why do you think it's about Harry?" He wants to wince at the childish defiance in his tone.
OOOOO
"Keep still, Draco. You're doing so good," Harry purrs between filthy, overly-saturated swipes of tongue.
He turned to head back up the stairs, calling over his shoulder, “One visit with her, and now you sound like Hermione. God help me.”
Harry sunk into the couch cushions, rubbing his hands over his face. “Family. I guess Malfoy, too, then?”
"Your arse is safe, I promise."
Harry felt his hackles rise. “Is that a problem?”
"Yes."
The body beneath him relaxes. "Yes, sir."
Everything came rushing back at him at once: a rejected hand, scorn and derision, the horrible crunch of a broken nose, the pain of his chest being ripped open, the cold tile of the bathroom floor, a bloated and misshapen face that could belong to no one but Potter, despair and utter anguish, the scent of sweat and fear as Fiendfyre raged, and the feel of Potter beneath his arms as they flew through the air. He took a moment and sat back, staring at the words in front of his face. Slowly, as if reborn, the ingrained sneer Azkaban had worked so hard to beat out of him reappeared. He placed the parchment of the table and raised his eyes to Granger.
Draco's mouth falls open on a choked sob that sounds a lot like 'please'.
"Very well," Harry says, bending down to press a kiss to the dip at the end of Draco's spine. "Let's continue."
The hole in Silvestri's chest grew bigger and blacker, and Draco wondered how that was even possible, but Potter simply loomed over him as if it were nothing. As if he ripped open people's chests by will alone every day.
Regret and shame fell heavy on Potter's shoulders, and he stepped back further, as if distance would mitigate Draco's ire.
Not even with the entire Wizarding world counting on him to defeat a Dark Lord.
Snape stood and stepped behind the chair, letting himself fume for a brief moment before turning his glare to the sofa in the far corner of the room. "Do
"Can she actually cook?"
Harry jerked as if shocked.
“Does the thought of fucking a man turn you on?”
"Ah," he says, inclining his head to assess her, "there's your shrewish tongue. How easily you return to the uncouth nature of your blood without me to gentle you. Lady Malfoy shows her true colors at last."
Naturally, it's Narcissa Malfoy that is the first among them to recover. She steps out from behind her son in a whisper of black silk, her skirts rustling as she moves into view.
But Harry tightens his grip enough to keep Draco still, and maneuvers his head back to look at the empty bed. "This is a problem easily solved. I should have been clearer in my direction. I apologize if it made you uncomfortable."
And there it was. If Draco had felt anguish at the mention of his mother, then it had moved on to Potter at his mention of Molly Weasley. They both had losses to mourn, but it irked Draco that Potter’s sorrow was a bed of his own making. He could mend fences. Draco, however, couldn’t commune with the dead. His appetite suddenly deserted him, and pushed back the plate.
Narcissa and Draco rise to a stand as he crosses the room to envelop his old friend in a warm hug. Nev claps him on the back and then holds him at arm's length.
Nothing.
Draco shared in Potter's laughter. "I think you're probably right." He relaxed and searched Potter's eyes with his own. "Thank you. For going with her. And for being there for her as well."
"It's a good thing Mother's out with Neville and won't be home for dinner. She'd never allow you in the dining room like that," Draco says, strolling in with a smirk. "You're covered in paint. Blinky would have a heart attack if you smeared one of the chairs with your—" he makes a show of craning his next to get a look at Harry's backside, "—colorful arse."
"I've been looking for you, Potter."
The beginnings of dinner went off with the clatter of dishes and cutlery as Potter sat quietly next to him, looking sorely out of place. Draco cast a glance around the table, noting that no one seemed to mind tucking in to the food while Potter’s plate sat empty in front of him.
"You're right. Then it's Draco to you. Welcome to Malfoy Manor. We're pleased to have you."
“If you attempt to Crucio me with it again, I’ll be very disappointed.”
"You are magnificent—" Draco pants between kisses, "—absolutely magnificent. Do you have any idea what that does to me?" He grabs Harry's hand and pulls it to his crotch. Draco's cock is beyond hard. "That was the hottest fucking thing I have ever seen," he whines as Harry's fingers curl around the rigid length. "I had no idea a spell like that even
to do?"
"He will always be in danger if he's with me," Potter protested. "I have to protect him. And that means objectivity."
"You're so good, Draco. So good, baby. Do it. Come for me."
Harry hates Apparition as much as he hates Floo travel. A fact made plain as he crumples to the floor on what appears to be a very expensive rug. A rug he's never seen before. Certainly not one at Grimmauld.
Harry lets himself smile and offers Malfoy a curt bow of acknowledgement. "Lead the way."
It's like someone's banging a gong right in Harry's brain. Narcissa Malfoy has all but outed her son over pudding. Even better, she sounds
"The same thing he wants every time he insinuates himself into my presence: me. He wants me," Potter said simply. "As a lover. As a vessel for his ambition. He wants my power and notoriety, thinking it would further his own goals. He's a manipulative bastard who plays nice with the Ministry because it suits him to do so, and worms his way around the Council because of it."
"Yes, Arthur's been kind enough to squeeze some more space out of the Burrow to give me a makeshift lab. In return, I've been helping him with some of his Muggle exploits. The past month, I've been elbows deep in something called an 'internal combustion engine'."
A twinge of guilt touches over his nerves, but he doesn't really think Narcissa will take offense. Draco, on the other hand, is a different story entirely. He doesn't dwell on why that particular thought is both amusing and unsettling. Harry simply pushes back the covers and decides to head for the shower. His feet hit the floor but he stops, gripped with the same grounding feeling from last night.
Potter sucked and thrust, and sucked and thrust, beginning a dangerous rhythm that had his heart scrambling to match its cadence. Each pull of Potter’s mouth on his skin was like an undertow, dragging him out to sea, and all Draco could do was throw his hands up and let it take him. The vampire moaned, deep and low in his throat, the sound more a growl of possession than of pleasure. The answering hardness from Potter’s pajamas was undeniable proof that Draco wasn’t the only one drowning on this sinking ship.
He is pure.
Draco is silent, but the gleam of pride and affection in his eyes speaks volumes.
“That’s your heartbeat.”
Potter didn't reply, but the shuffle of his trainers on the stone floor let Draco know he wasn't far behind. He walked on, past the tombs of his ancestors, until his feet came to rest at the one place that held more disappointment than sorrow. His father's name was carved smoothly into the stone, as clean and cold as Lucius Malfoy had been when he was alive. His left hand clenched into a tight fist, stinging as the action caused more blood to drip from between his fingers. He paid it little mind, instead running his right hand across the stone with trepidation.
Potter faced him, his eyes pleading for Draco to stop, but Draco's anger and resentment burned too hot, too fast for him to quit now.
"Look at me, Draco. Just keep looking at me."
. His body was singing with it, rejoicing in it, lusting after it. And if he looked at it hard enough, through the right filters, he could feel Potter’s body taking the offering with the same response.
Draco is naked, bathed in firelight, at the side of his bed. His back is to Harry, and he's kneeling, seated back on his heels in the waiting position, palms on his thighs facing upward, head bowed in silent supplication. He is lovely. The arch of his spine is graceful and serene, and Harry wonders if that beautiful stretch of skin tastes any different than the rest of him. He's held this pose often; there's an easy carriage to it that makes the blood pound in Harry's ears. The sight should be perfect. But it's not. There's something off, and Harry can't put his finger on it.
The wizarding picture showed a young Narcissa, smiling out into the world, her face light and carefree. Two other young women were in the photo with her, wearing similar happy expressions. They held their pose, and then fidgeted, finally erupting into peals of shared laughter.
"So you did." Neville's voice pitches low, and there's a look in his eye that she hasn't seen directed in her way in a very, very long time. "I think I might like to catch a peek of you in your flip-flops sometime."
As he shuts the door behind him, he thinks days spent like this could never be wasted.
"You have and you know it," she laughed.
"I've already seen one," Draco replies, glancing around at the walls in no particular fashion. "When I came back from Switzerland. It was," he pauses, "necessary at the time."
"Toys and apparatus? Providing they fall within your limits?"
Harry's mind flashed back to a naked, flushed Draco, fluid limbs and arched back. Heavy-lidded grey eyes and kisses that could bring Harry to his knees. Wanton and writhing beneath him, with Harry's name gasped from his lips like a prayer. He swallowed hard, but the image stuck in his throat.
Part him wanted Potter to splutter in denial, or blush, or stammer, or anything that would prove Draco could still throw Potter for a loop. But after Potter’s admission, and the damning aura of truth that rang in his words, he knew it wasn’t happening.
him with a kiss. His fingers slide into Draco's hair and
“Yes, it has been a while.”
Harry catches the underlying depth to Neville's tone and smiles.
The eye roll was downright insulting. "Christ, you're going to need more than a phrase book."
“Half-nine good for you?” she asked.
"Then don't make me feel like one."
Hermione’s hand slid over her husband’s arm and squeezed. “Ron, he’s hurt people. I know you don’t think he means to do it, but he doesn’t seem to care. That’s not our Harry. He’s changed, and we have to accept that. Did you see what he did this last time?” She shuddered. “He almost killed that man.”
"If you'll excuse me, I have to track Potter down," he said as he headed to the door.
"Ye—yes, sir. Pl—please."
He wants Draco. He wants Draco
What's even more noticeable is the fine sheen of sweat glistening on Neville's brow and arms as he works diligently in the flowerbeds. His jeans are covered in light layer of soil, especially the backs of his thighs where he's absently been wiping his gloves every so often. She's trying not stare at the tight stretch of denim across his lower half, but between the heat and his position on the ground, his clothes are stuck to him like a second skin. It's a shocking revelation, but the man has a truly spectacular arse.
Potter's eyes darkened with hunger as he stripped off his sleep pants, his hand coming back up to give the erect length of his cock a lazy stroke.
The addition of Neville at the breakfast table five days out of seven came as no surprise to anyone, and Harry thinks the Floo between Narcissa's chambers and Hogwarts should just turn itself into a revolving door and be done with it. Either that, or just move in.
She huffs and straightens the line of her dress. "I don't want an apology," she pouts. "I want an introduction—oh, never mind, then. I see how it is."
“I don’t see why it’s such an imposition for you to come to dinner with Draco at the Burrow.”
“He’s gone mental, you mean?” Draco sat up and pressed the tip of his forefinger to the table. “That’s it, isn’t it? Potter’s gone off his nut and you want me to keep him on a leash.” He snarled, the deep growl echoing through the room. “And this is the man you want me bind myself to? He’s dangerous, isn’t he?”
That shoves Draco into action. "No—no, sir." Long elegant fingers frantically start working and in seconds, he's naked before Harry's hungry gaze. Draco clasps his hands behind his back and waits, and Harry can already see the flush of arousal creeping across his pale skin.
Draco steps quietly into the room, and Harry takes the moment to assess his demeanor. The calmness he sees is pleasant and a little surprising; after all, a tiny part of him expected Draco to walk in here like a man on his way to his own execution. But in a way, maybe it is. Maybe Draco is resigned to let his experiences of the past die tonight. Harry thinks he's been an executioner once, and if it means getting Draco right where he wants him, he's happy to do it again. Only this time, he feels honored, not obligated.
“Harry! Draco! You’re here! George, let them breathe!” Molly Weasley’s voice preceded her entrance, presumably from the kitchen, if the aroma that followed her was any indication.
want to know what I think?"
"Don't start this again, Millie," he says, knowing the request is futile.
Draco snorted. "No, I wear a Mark on my arm. There isn't room for anything else. However, a trinket wouldn't go amiss. After all, nothing says 'I'm chuffed to have you as my sole food source' like an expensive piece of jewelry."
"Right here on the kitchen table?" he scoffed. "Where the rest of us eat. How fitting, Potter. Truly." His gaze flicked over Harry, and he knew the sight he must present, bare-arsed, half-on, half-off the table, with his jeans bunched down around his ankles and his cock lying limp and sticky on his thigh.
"Fine."
"Shall we?"
“Where is Percy?” Potter added. Bill shook his head. “Percy doesn’t come to Sunday supper. Charlie’s still in Romania. He doesn’t get home much, but when he does, you can count on him at the table.”
"I think you were relieved to get captured."
"I was asleep."
Ron snorted. “Nobody is. Not after what we went through. None of us are the same people.”
Well, Harry muses, that went better than expected.
Harry nods. "Yes, I think so." He thinks back on it, and shakes his head more rapidly. "Yes, that's it, I'm sure. 'Sanctuary'."
“He can’t hurt you. I won’t let him.” The light in Potter’s eyes flashed. “I protect what is mine, Draco.”
OOOOO
He licks it because he can.
"Draco—" Snape's breath stalled in his lungs as Draco's voice broke.
Harry's jaw tightened into a hard line and he bit out, "Yes, damn you."
She snaps her fingers and Blinky pops in.
Malfoy steps back and rolls his eyes. "You're off your nut."
Draco huffs and shakes his head. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry sees the bob of Draco's throat and the hang of his head. With a jerk, Draco flips around to face Harry, bracing his hands behind him on the table. His body leans forward, almost accusingly.
about Owen and their failed relationship, and how it looks for the Ministry to have an Auror who engages in less than respectable sexual practices and isn't the least bit bothered by it on their payroll. He's heard the whispers. He knows what people think even if they won't say it to his face.
It sounded too good to be true, but he knew that if there was a catch, Granger was too good at heart to cover it up. Even for Harry’s sake.
Draco reached for the parchment again and brought it to his face, squinting his eyes and making a show of reading it more closely. He waited a breath and slammed it on the table. To her credit, Granger didn’t so much as bat an eyelash. “The summation I’m getting here is that you’re offering me a pardon if I will willingly consent to become Potter’s chew toy. Is that correct?”
"Close your mouth, Draco. You'll catch flies."
"I should have killed you a long time ago," she says evenly. Lucius only snorts in response. "But I didn't. You earned your reprieve with one simple act. You gave me Draco." Her smile is cruel. "You owe him your life. You owe that boy everything."
"Then how the bloody fucking hell did you get through the wards, Potter?" Malfoy's voice is a barely controlled growl.
"Yes?" She stops and looks back, and he could stare into the acceptance he sees in her eyes forever.
Draco's acquiescence is warm and liquid in Harry's chest. It's amazing how a little patience and some self-control can bring out this side of Draco. The one that wants to understand, the one that wants to please. And Harry wants to repay him for his willingness to learn. Harry dips his head and drags the bridge of his nose along the column of Draco's neck, watching him swallow hard in response. He breathes out over Draco's skin, warm and humid, leaving behind just a flicker of moisture.
"That's because it is," Draco deadpans. "And I'm not thinking about them right now because I'm thinking about us."
"One, your magic brought you here, recognizing your innate need without you even knowing what it is, or…two—"
Harry's breath leaves him in a rush. Draco's heartfelt admission is staggering. "I can't even begin to know how you feel. I'm so sorry, Draco."
"Yes."
Harry turns his head and lets his breath ghost over Draco's ear. The resulting shudder makes Harry smile. "Oh, that's much better." He turns and heads for the door, calling over his shoulder, "Enjoy the rest of your afternoon."
"You lo—What? Selfish?"
The moment Potter was fully seated, he came unglued, ramming his cock into Draco with unfettered abandon. The deep thrusts seared him to the core, rocking him against the bed with bone-shattering force. He'd been fucked hard like this before, with other green lovers who coupled 'harder' with 'better', but like everything else, Potter fucked with an innate skill that was mind-blowing. It was raw and animalistic, rough with a sheen of underlying finesse that took his breath away. He grabbed at Potter, clutching to hang on under the assault. Potter gripped back onto Draco like an anchor and continued without pause. He was a beast, and Draco had to marvel that something this wild and uncontrolled could feel so devastatingly perfect. Each snap of Potter's hips shook his body until his teeth rattled, with an advance and retreat timed with paradoxical precision.
Ron's finger waggles in the air. "I can see it on your face. You may not be shagging him, but by Merlin, you want to." He narrows his eyes. "In fact, you're probably planning on it."
," Ron hisses in return.
"It's
If there is one thing in this world that Draco Malfoy is absolutely perfect at, it's this: the waiting position. Platinum head hung low, showing off the slope of an elegant neck. Bared in submission. Upturned palms resting on pale thighs that quiver under Harry's gaze. Back curving so beautifully in the sweeping arc of quiet supplication.
Her face is open and quiet, like it always is when he comes to her in these moments. She is the bedrock of his life, the one constant through the squall of war and the hell of aftermath.
"You're trying to seduce me."
Neville's talking about soil aeration, but Narcissa can't bring herself to listen. Instead, she's focused on the way their arms are entwined, and the way his left hand is covering hers in the crook of his elbow. His thumb is rubbing absently across the back of her hand as he goes on, and she realizes that he's the first man to touch her in a way that isn't within the bounds of polite propriety in
Draco smiled. "I think he knew this was on the horizon. Basically told me to get lost. I assume he's here for a reason?"
It takes a second for Malfoy to get the hint, but he does, huffing, "Fine. Draco."
“What?”
He thought of the multitude of things that Potter had hoped to do with his life, not able to guess at a singular detail, but he knew the loss of a dream when he saw one. And honestly, even if he did know, Draco doubted he'd be able to give it to him. The only thing he had of any worth to Potter was the blood coursing through his veins, and that already belonged to him. "Will you accept me as a substitute?"
"Awkward?" Draco replied. "No, Potter, showing up to a Ministry function in the same robes as a Weasley is awkward. This," he gestured between them, "this is untenable."
Harry's chest swells and his breath catches. He'd expected nothing more than cold politeness from Draco, and here he is, welcoming Neville with genuine pleasure. And the short glance that Draco shoots him again only drives home his theory. This is for Harry. Yes, it probably has something to do with Draco letting go of old habits, but this is also Draco showing Harry that he is capable of anticipating Harry's wishes. Of welcoming Neville so warmly because it's what Harry wants. And he's done it without being asked. Even after the failure of last night's encounter, Draco is showing Harry that he can be a better man, that he's not harboring any petulance or affront after Harry all but tossed him out on his arse.
Malfoy swallows, but says nothing in kind.
Ron held the door wide, allowing Potter to step through. "Come in, then." He scratched the back of his head and split his gaze between Draco and the vampire. "I'll leave you to it, shall I?"
She steeled herself and sat at the small table anyway, pulling out the parchment and a quill. “I had hoped you would sit and speak with me,” she said lightly.
FYI...I'm taking a short trip, so I won't post again for a bit. Don't leave me.
Draco shoved his right hand down the front of Potter's jeans and grabbed hold of his cock with a forceful squeeze. Potter moaned, arching into Draco's hand with a jolt of his hips. Draco closed his eyes and tilted his head further, giving the vampire better access. He let his hand slide from Potter's shoulder to cup the back of head and press, pushing Potter's face down while his other hand worked at his cock. Draco had him, arms full of writhing vampire, and it was only moments before Potter's body shuddered in climax.
“Yes,” he said rising. “Thank you. I’m on my way.” He turned to Hermione. “Always a pleasure, Hermione.”
"Harry—"
She scoffs, using her free hand to brush lint from his tie. "I've been running a business and making a name for myself. You know what that's like. Busy, busy."
Potter tapped the side of his nose. "Got it in one."
"Good for you."
Harry cocks his head. "Do I need to repeat myself?"
She plucks at the soft cotton. "It's comfortable," she insists. "Perfect for a morning getting dirty."
It seemed relatively clean, although the first thing Draco noticed was the darkness. The windows were covered in heavy, black curtains that swallowed every ray of light that might even be thinking about coming through. Light came in a warm glow from the presence of lamps scattered about the room, bathing the space in shades of amber and yellow.
"I always have time for you, Draco." It comes out far lower than he intended, and Draco's eyes dilate at the silky undertone.
Over her shoulder, Harry sees a shock of white-blond hair, and the tiny glimpse makes something catch in his chest. As the crowd flows around Draco, another face comes into view. It's not surprising—it's expected, really—and Harry's body reacts accordingly. With complete and perfect calm.
The Malfoy matriarch's face is resolute. That makes Harry's heart skip a beat in his chest.
“He doesn’t have to be here. He has a choice.” The argument was weak, and Harry knew it. But he was feeling far too agitated to make a good showing. It was always the same when he tried to talk to Hermione or the others. He started feeling things he didn’t want to, and suddenly he couldn’t make heads or tails of the situation, and letting the vampire come out was so much easier than trying to do the right thing.
“You hear me because you need me. You need to eat. Don’t you see?” Draco hissed.
Draco peeked out over Potter’s shoulder to see a smiling Granger, a set of parchments in her hand. Weasley barreled in the door after her, followed by Shacklebolt and a tall, imposing man with a stony face that could have given Severus Snape a run for his money.
“I expected nothing of the sort.”
Draco snorted, reaching for Potter's face again. "What makes you think I would stoop to offering my body out of gratitude? Frankly," he laughed, "that's a little insulting."
When Harry wakes in the morning, his eyes instinctively shoot to the four-poster, already wanting to see if the reality measures up to previous vision given to him by the Manor. Harry gets up and strides to the bed. His gaze rakes over the tangle of blue sheets, and his mouth purses tightly. Because the bed is empty, the sheets are cold, and Draco has committed his first transgression.
"Pansy," Harry says, purposefully using her given name to deflect the cold formality that is expected. She's the only one Draco cared to invite, which says she's the only one of his former friends that means anything to him at all. That says something about her current character. That tells Harry all he needs to know.
Draco bites off a tiny moan.
He canted his hips, feeling the rough drag of skin on skin and the tight vise of Potter's hand. Potter groaned against his neck, biting down on the mark, but not hard enough to bleed. Draco threw his head back and hissed, squirming, desperate to feel more.
“Nothing, really. My name a few times, but mostly your mumbled grumbling and her exasperated dressing down.”
It feels as though the air is sucked from his lungs. Malfoy's mouth is open in a slight pant, and the collar of his white shirt is gaping at his collarbone, and Harry can see the flush from his cheeks has spread lower, pinking him up all over. The sight goes straight to Harry's groin.
Draco increased the pace of his stroke, sliding up and down Potter’s cock, catching the moisture that pooled at the crown to lubricate each pass of his hand. Potter moaned roughly now, moving his hips to thrust wantonly into Draco’s hand.
Her eyes shine, dangerously close to something liquid, and before he knows it, her hand is now cradling his cheek. "Such a fine young man you've turned into, Harry. Your mother would be so proud." The way she says it, it's almost a whisper in the air, a sort of hushed declaration that hooks into his chest and
"Harry, I'm worried."
Potter laughed softly and shook his head. “I’ve seen more Dark Marks than I care to admit on men who had no compunction about flaunting them. Yours is still the only thing it ever was.” Green eyes danced with interest. “A wicked tattoo.”
“You smell like fear.”
He looks at Harry as if he's asked the stupidest question on earth. "I've just had the best sex of my life, I'm naked on the sofa with two of the most gorgeous women on the planet, and it all feels right somehow. What do you think I did? I rubbed her damn feet and loved every second of it."
—raise your hand in anger on a partner again, your magic will turn and visit upon you your intentions a hundredfold. The consequences of which could be quite nasty, or given your predilections—deadly, even. Wouldn't that be a shame?"
Draco's eyelids slam shut and his head jerks to the side. "Why did you have to show up here? Why is this my life?" He opens his eyes and turns a haunted gaze on Harry. "How is this my life now?"
"He didn't die because of you. People died because of
Draco's mouth curled. "Again, not unreasonable."
Draco nodded as Potter's words failed him. "I do, Merlin fuck me twice, I do. But I can see that you are either unequivocally incapable or unwilling to love me back, despite how much you desire me." He paused, taking a moment. "I—I thought it would be enough, you know." Draco sniffed again and raised his eyes to Potter's. "But it isn't. I see that now."
Harry does as she asks without really thinking about why, because it's suddenly hit him again that he's in a sitting room at Malfoy Manor. With Narcissa and Draco Malfoy. And Malfoy's bare feet. Sitting is suddenly imperative.
Ron's eyes go wider than he's ever seen. "Paint?" The question is fraught with incredulity. "You're going to chuck it all and paint?"
Harry leans in to press a kiss to Draco's cool cheek. "Darling," he says with utter adoration.
Harry raises an eyebrow and smiles back at him. "Don't tell me you're planning on voicing an objection?"
A/N: Thanks for your patience. Sorry I haven't posted, as there's been a family summer vacation and a real-life job that's taken my time. If you've stayed around this long, I thank you. And all comments and reviews are not only welcomed, but encouraged. *hint hint* Hopefully, I shall be publishing more to this story soon. I just hope you all still want to read it!
"Absolutely not." Snape's voice drawled across the expanse of the lab. "You will not attend any lesson of mine dressed like that."
"I'm serious, Potter," she hisses, leaning in to his side. He's only "Potter" when she's annoyed. She smells like Luna—wet clay, cherries, and coal fire. It wouldn't surprise him if they had one off in the supply closet before they opened the doors. Luna's fond of recreational sex in odd places, and is even fonder of telling everyone about it. She has absolutely no filter, and Millie has no fucks to give about it. They're actually quite charming together.
A/N: I know this is a really short chapter. But a lot's about to happen, and I needed some logical breaking points, or this collection of scenes would go on forever. Thanks for your patience!
"Words to live by."
“I treat him very well,” Harry smirked. “He has the bite marks to prove it.”
Potter’s face skewed into an amalgam of agitated vulnerability. Draco felt the tension radiating off him as the vampire’s body shook in tremors almost too minute to discern. He was holding back, either too stubborn or too arrogant to speak. Potter’s eyes fluttered closed and Draco watched as drops of water collected on his lashes, rolling down his face in tiny, snakelike rivulets. When Potter opened his eyes on a deep breath, the earnestness in that green gaze nearly dropped Draco to his knees.
Harry follows her line of sight to see Neville and Narcissa standing close to the hors d'oeuvres, chatting.
He shoots a glance at Malfoy, who inclines his head. "Of course, Mother. Rest well. We'll see you at breakfast."
"I'm not going to lie for you, but I won't offer it up, either."
"Finally," Draco whines, attacking Harry's neck with a series of biting kisses, sucking at him as he grinds their cocks together.
"Easy," Harry says, kissing down the backs of Draco's legs. "You're doing so well. You're so beautiful, Draco. So beautiful," Harry murmurs against his skin. His voice has a calming effect, and the rattling dwindles.
"Well," Draco huffs out slowly as Blinky appears with his breakfast, "a dinner party. She must be feeling good. There haven't been people here in ages." He takes a delicate bite of bacon and Harry is mesmerized by the action. Draco chews carefully and furrows his brows in thought. Swallowing, he says, "At least not since I left for Switzerland."
Draco closed his eyes and willed his frantic heart to slow. The moment he saw the word ‘consort’ on the parchment, he knew exactly what was being offered. Bound to Potter. Forced to allow him to feed. Tied irrevocably to another master by circumstances beyond his control. Yet, freedom crept over the horizon, blazing as it came into view. But to what end? And how great was the price? How far had Potter fallen for this, for the Savior’s saving grace to be himself?
"I'll be sure to guard my virtue, Mother."
“I love how you keep throwing that around.
"Yes, Harry." Draco's eyes drift downward.
Potter’s face hardened. “It didn’t work out.”
As expected, the glare does nothing to faze Potter in the slightest. He simply smiles and asks after his mother with genuine interest. He says he hopes the move to Paris was beneficial for them both. He says he understands now why Draco couldn’t stay.
Harry stands up from his chair and moves to Draco's side, placing his right hand on the back of Draco's chair, and his left on the table next to Draco's. Close enough to touch, but Harry doesn't, because the boundaries of touch have yet to be liberated. He chooses to answer the question by not answering it.
Harry runs his hand through the softness of Draco's hair, relishing the slide through his fingers. He cups Draco's cheek, brushing his thumb across the zygomatic arch before lifting his chin to raise his head.
“Fucking Hermione.”
"I'm going to test the nutrient levels in the soil and start from there."
Potter’s mouth gentled as his hands loosened their punishing grip, his thumbs rubbing small, soothing circles where they had been digging in moments before. Arousal reared its head, fierce and determined, and Draco felt himself harden underneath the vampire’s ministrations. Potter grunted against his skin, and Draco knew he felt the hard ridge of his cock between them. The mouth at his neck sucked again, drawing more and more of his blood into Potter’s body, and this time the sensation was warm and heady, deliciously soft, almost velvety as it coursed through his body.
Draco's hands wrapped around Potter's face, jerking him down for a fierce, possessive kiss. Potter moaned, slipping his tongue inside, meeting Draco's ardor with passion of his own. Hands grabbed and clutched as Potter latched onto Draco, fingers bruising as their bodies collided. Potter's cock was hot and heavy, sticky against his own, and the resulting friction made him writhe for more.
“Heard me? Heard me what? Scrubbing my balls?” Draco’s voice hit a strangled high as he flung his arms in the air. “Circe’s tits, someone should put a bell on you.”
"Do you have any idea of the mountain of cash we'd be rolling in if you did commission work like I told you to?"
“First you put a wand in my hand, and now you’re taking me to the bedroom? Goodness, Potter. All this romance will make me swoon.” Potter rolled his eyes, and Draco leaned with a conspiratorial whisper. “I would’ve let you have me on the settee. And let Walburga watch.”
She doesn't spare another glance for Lucius and heads for the door. Neville is standing there, bare-chested and mussed from sleep, with eyes bright enough for her to know he's heard the whole exchange. Eyes only for her. He doesn't even glance at the portrait. As she nears, he pulls the door wider to allow her through.
"God, you're gorgeous," Harry whispers. "So beautiful." He smiles down, full of dark promise. "Give it to me, Draco. Give yourself to me."
sends a delicious spike of yearning thrumming through his bloodstream.
"I was thinking of painting." Harry is horrified as the words tumble out. He wants to say something else, something that doesn't sound completely mental, but he's stopped by Mrs. Malfoy's warm smile.
He pulls back to gauge Draco's state of mind. Draco's eyes are glassy and blissed out, and he's sagging a bit, but otherwise seems to be in a healthy mental state. Until his eyes look down and see the smear of milky white fluid over Harry's groin.
So, it’s back to England, and back to Potter. He’s dramatic enough to think that this means something, this coming full circle, but there’s too much of his mother’s stubborn Black blood in him to be maudlin about it. What’s done is done. He’s here and he’s always been a magnet to Potter’s true north.
It was too much to consider, especially now with his cock stiff in his jeans, and Draco's delectable flesh bared before him in offering. His hand fisted into the silkiness of Draco's hair, jerking him forward. As his fangs pierced flesh, the sharp, drugging pull of Draco spilled over his tongue, bathing it with the promise of unquenched desire.
Draco stops pacing and walks closer to Harry, stopping in front of him. His eyes are sad, a little bright, and utterly beautiful. "I've had nothing but pain and humiliation with this type of relationship. I've been disappointed and hurt. And for a long time I thought I would rather be alone that have to endure that again. And you say that it's real, what I want. That I can give you control and let myself go. Let myself feel. Because that's what I need. I have been raised to maintain control of myself my entire life. To be in control of every situation, every outcome. To have the advantage, no matter what it takes. To always wear a mask of superiority and never show my true feelings." Draco averts his gaze and swallows, steeling himself. When he looks back to Harry, he says, "Emotions are sometimes uncomfortable for me. It makes me feel vulnerable and a Malfoy is
“Yeah. Lucky me.”
Ron flips two fingers at him. "You know, I thought you'd be a lot more helpful. I see that Malfoy's charm is contagious around here."
Despite the cold front of his carriage, Draco's eyes were heated, and it gave Harry a small measure of satisfaction to know it was his touch that made Draco burn. How long would it be before this particular fire died?
Silvestri.
Harry's cock throbs painfully with the need to be inside him, but he can't give this up just yet, not while Draco is taking everything he has to give with such unadulterated
"You cheeky git."
"Essentially, yeah."
Finally, Draco's hands fall away to land on the cushion, palms upturned in supplication.
He wants to feel it again.
Harry watches Draco's eyebrows shoot into his hairline as Neville takes his mother's delicate hand and presses a soft kiss to the back.
Potter sidestepped him, and Draco noticed he was shirtless. "I mean it; I told you that I was planning on doing it anyway. It's just that my lack of self-control upped the timeline a little. I wanted a bit longer to get things together, but that didn't happen. It worked out, though."
Potter's door swung open and his dark head filled the hallway.
"Thank you, Draco. You are a paragon of restraint."
“He is completely unsuitable!” A male voice grumbled. “They’d kill each other inside a week, and all your efforts would be lost!”
"Heinrich was ages ago. This one's called Raoul." Renault sucks in a lascivious breath. "Exquisitely exotic."
Narcissa Malfoy is just as shocked as her son, eyes wide and surprised, body pressed close to Malfoy's.
"Do you have a safeword?"
will change you. And I promise you, you won't like what you become."
"Tell that to the heaps of luggage under your eyes. You look positively dreadful." The other man's tone is jovial, but Harry hears the undertone of worry it carries. This man cares for Draco.
"A sin of omission is still a sin."
Clothing cast aside, he found he was unable to move as quickly as he wanted, instead captured by the consuming want in Potter's face. The vampire looked him over with scrutiny, stopping when he caught sight of Draco's cock.
"You're a decent bloke, Potter."
"Yes, Draco."
"Potter and I are bonding, Draco. Don't spoil the moment," Pansy laughs. She turns her gaze out into the dining room. "Just when were you planning on telling me Longbottom got so fit? Where was I while that was happening?"
Draco felt Harry’s lips graze against the sensitive spot just below his ear, his ragged speech ghosting over Draco’s flesh. The action sent tiny aftershocks spreading through him and Draco groaned, closing his eyes to let his head fall back against the wall with a thud. His lips curled into a sated smile.
Draco groans, and the sound makes the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand at attention. "We really are going to be overrun with Gryffindors, aren't we?"
is all about." His eyes narrow and the point of his chin thrusts out as he continues, "And here you are, half-naked,
The emotion in Draco's tone burrows under Harry's skin. He hears curiosity, apprehension, and restrained excitement. But no fear.
Potter was on him with the flash of fangs and a curdled smile, digging into the juncture of where neck met shoulder. Draco hissed with pain as the vampire bit down with crushing force. His knees locked to keep from collapsing and his eyes slammed shut as he fought to stay upright. He railed against the suffocating sensation, and the scent of his own blood hit his nostrils. Potter’s hands clamped down on his hips to brace him against the shower wall and hold him in place. It was sharp and caustic, and Draco didn’t think he would ever catch his breath again when the bite shifted to a suck.
. He's waited this long for a taste of Draco's mouth, waited this long to see Draco come undone again.
," Draco shot back with smile, holding up the letter. "Apparently, you taught me everything you know."
Harry shoves at him. "So you only came by to brag, then?"
"I can—here, I'll move. I didn't even realize—" Harry's words trail as he moves to rise, but now there's a twinge of magic not just over the chair, but the entire table. It's weighing him down, and he can't get up. His legs feel bolted to the floor, and his arse feels like it's become permanently attached to the velvet cushion underneath it. The Manor doesn't want him to move. It doesn't want to let him go.
“He’s already angry with us. Maybe in time he can forgive us. And if he can’t, then we know we’ve tried to do everything we could. Anything after that is on Harry.” She pursed her lips and folded her hands.
"You look like it," Harry responds, smiling. "Sit down, you berk. What's happened?"
“Malfoy,” she said lightly, with an incline to her head in greeting.
"You sure?" Ron asked, turning to face him.
He calls for Blinky, and she escorts Ron out of the room. He collapses onto the sofa and rubs a tired hand over his face. It'll take Ron a bit, but he'll come around. He usually does. A smile plays at the edge of lips. He hopes that Ron doesn't run into Neville anytime soon and ask him what
He steps closer and the scent of his aftershave mingles with the fresh, grassy scent of the greenhouse. It's grounding and heavy, and she feels as though her feet are rooted where she stands. Like the two of them are connected to the earth, bound to this space.
Potter laughed, throwing his head back. "Arthur's teaching you about cars? I think I'd pay good Galleons to see you covered in engine grease and liking it."
“Of course,” Hermione said smoothly. “It says something that he retained his magical abilities after his Turning. I don’t think that’s happened in what,” her glance flicked to Silvestri, “eight hundred years?”
"How do you know he won't test you, though?"
Malfoy's eyes are wild and frantic and his body is strung taut, even as his limbs flail about in protest. His shouting is reaching a pinnacle, and Harry hears incandescent rage and indignant affront in the bellows. But he also hears something else, something buried deep among the shrillness. Beneath the high-pitched bluster, Harry hears the undercurrent of an emotion that he knows intimately.
"You're a fool," Snape spat. "A cowardly fool. You're not protecting Draco, you're protecting yourself."
Draco's still spooning trifle into his mouth, holding back on the sigh of pleasure Harry's sure he wants to make but doesn't.
"Yes," she continues. "I thought we might have a small dinner party tomorrow evening. Just close friends." Her eyes sharpen on Draco. "Pansy's in from America."
He bucked, and Potter stilled to open even wider. The vampire's hands traveled from Draco's hips, sliding across his skin to grab at his arse and jerk him forward. Draco snorted roughly through his nose and stared down at Potter. He was deliciously debauched, lips swollen, mouth wet and red, stretched around the length of his erection. Eyes high and bright, blown wide with arousal. Hard, leaking cock straining out into the air, thighs trembling, looking every inch like someone who could take Draco apart.
As he murmured soft words over his mother's crypt, she stood back, far enough to be respectful, but close enough for Draco to draw strength. In that moment, which part of him still bitterly felt should have been Potter's, Draco felt himself fall under her spell. She was an amazing witch, her intelligence tempered by the generosity of her heart. It was no wonder Weasley and Potter were so enamored of her.
When Draco's mouth fell open and his head lolled back in offering, Harry lost whatever shred of control he had, snapping, "Enough of this. Let's just skip to the part where I kill you for daring to put your hands on what's mine."
“Not all of us tried to kill our best friend.”
“Think about this rationally, Ron,” Hermione pleaded. “If he takes a Consort, a willing one, and binds himself to them, he will no longer be able to feed off anyone else. He can’t. He may not like it, but at least he’ll be alive.”
“Right,” he snapped back. “And you only asked Draco because you knew if you asked me I would say no, and that he would say yes just to spite me.”
Draco had an unconventional beauty that belied definition. His was the beauty of cherished things, beauty that lay in its intrinsic value to the soul, not of a predefined notion. Even in its perfunctory grace, Harry felt the gift of Draco's service. A gift he knew he didn't deserve.
“Of course not, you idiot. But did you stop to think about how Malfoy might not want to waltz around the Wizarding world with your claim for all to see?”
"Goodnight, Harry."
And then he moved.
“My own shop?” Draco scoffed. “Who in the bloody hell would willingly walk into any establishment I own?” He shook his head. “No, it would have to be mail order. And under a name that certainly isn’t Malfoy.”
Right. And here it comes. Owen.
Potter's eyes sharpened, and Draco knew he had nailed it.
But the want in Harry is too great, and the hope that he and Draco can have something extraordinary burns too hot in his blood. The words flow out smoothly. "For this to work, you have to trust me. I will not have a lover who is afraid of me, or ashamed of who he is, or what we do. If you think you can come to terms with that and openly accept it, then come back to me. Because if you can do that, I can promise you that I will give you everything you need. I will take control, and I will make you feel more powerful that you could ever imagine."
Tense seconds hung in the air like weighted raindrops, waiting to fall, ready to either nourish life or snuff it out in a deluge. He snatched the quill and parchment, signing his name with a flourish. The resulting magic swirled around them before settling across Harry.
OOOOOO
"Talked to her?" Draco scoffs. "We've practically been in each other's pockets the last eight months. She tells me you've been under the weather. Touch of the flu, was it? I daresay you're looking hale and hearty."
"My son is wiser than he seems." Her breath is soft in the air between them. "Don't let it worry you. A mother's love is the foundation on which all confident men are bred." Her hand cups his cheek, and Harry leans into it, leans into the raw affection he feels there. "And I have enough love for the both of you, whenever you require it."
Neville steps forward and reaches for her hand as she straightens. She offers it, and Neville bows formally. "It is you who honor me, Lady Malfoy. And please, call me Neville." His voice is low and deferential, and full of warmth.
A/N: I thought it was going to be three more chapters, but it might be four. Either way, shippers, we're almost to the end of our tale! Thanks for sticking it out with me! Reviews and love always appreciated.
She can't help the lift of her chin. "I'm not above getting dirty."
"Sure thing," Ron muttered, shutting the door. He headed up the stairs, but paused when he reached Draco. The redhead leaned in and gave him an affectionate nudge to the shoulder. "Don't go easy on him, mate," Ron whispered. "He's been a miserable arse. Make him work for it, yeah?"
He'd like to say that he's not outwardly affected at how hearing his given name rolls off Draco's tongue, but he is. It doesn't go unnoticed by Narcissa, either.
“And all has been forgiven. You’re the only one who can’t seem to get past it,” she reminded him.
He registered the sound of Potter’s fingers snapping, and then there was a lube-slick hand palming the bare flesh of his cock. Draco gasped and bucked into the stroke of Potter’s hand, moving along the shaft with distinctive purpose. Those fingers dipped backward to the cleft of his arse, circling his opening. It wasn’t tentative or unsure, but single-minded, and Draco felt his legs part as if they had no other choice in the matter. He felt a finger slowly press on, working to breach the tight muscle. The lubrication mitigated the burn, but he honestly couldn’t tell one fire from another at this point in time.
Narcissa steps back and averts her eyes. "You're far too generous with your praise."
“It’s dangerous water he’s treading, your Savior. I hope your wife can convince him to catch this lifeline.” Silvestri turned on his heel without a sound and headed to the door. He didn’t look back as he finished, “It’s the only one he’s going to get.”
Harry watches as Narcissa's eyes rove over Neville with careful interest at his tone. He releases her hand, and she pulls it back slowly, almost reluctantly. "Of course," she murmurs, "and it's Narcissa, please. We're not as formal as we used to be."
Narcissa swallows as her mouth goes dry and her stomach pitches headlong toward her toes. It's a feeling she has to struggle to recognize.
"You've already been friendly," Harry points out.
Potter held out his wand as calmly as if he’d offered Draco a cup of tea. Shaking hands placed the photograph on the desk and he walked with slow steps toward Potter. He shook out his hand and flexed his fingers to steady them before reaching for the wand. Potter pulled it back, the tease, and offered him a sly smile.
“Correct.” Brown eyes he remember so well sparkled. “Worked, too.”
Draco noted that he only had eyes for Granger, choosing to ignore Weasley’s sputtering and the two other men in the room. The tall man was silent and foreboding, and Draco knew he was looking at a member of the vampire Council, and someone with whom Harry had no intention of acknowledging.
The obedience.
"You had a threesome with your wife and Pansy Parkinson?"
"If you're wondering if I would kill for you, the answer is yes. I've done it before. I told you once, I protect what is mine. And I will kill to do it." He spoke with such marked calm, with such impassioned truth, that Draco's heart hammered in his chest so wildly it was a wonder it didn't burst forth to fall at his feet. Potter's gaze fluttered over him and the vampire took a step back, running a hand through the dark locks of his hair in an adroit move of fingers, effectively breaking the tension his words had created between them. Green eyes found Draco's again, this time they were softer, but not the least bit apologetic. "Like I said, Silvestri is nothing to worry about. Come on, let's go."
The daggers are back in Malfoy's gray stare. "You're infuriating. You demand familiarity and in the next breath you're sneering 'Malfoy' like we're first years."
Draco watched as Potter’s eyes shifted, turning two notches above murderous as they fixed on Granger. The smile that crossed his lips was sinister as he replied, “Watch me.”
Harry feels the tension radiating from Draco as he shuffles across the floor to stand next to Potter at the edge of the bed. Harry's hand comes up to press lightly at the base of Draco's neck.
Draco’s left arm pressed close into his side, as if the appendage had a mind of its own. “I wish I could say I felt the same.” He turned his wrist upward, presenting it to Potter’s gaze.
"Coward?" Potter's voice held a deadly bite, and he stiffened, leaning forward as if to advance. Something stayed his feet, because he stood his ground, glaring at Draco. His lips pulled back to reveal the sharp points of his fangs. "How dare you—"
Draco sits and huffs. "There's nothing to tell."
He blinked twice, and yes, she was still there, clutching a khaki-colored satchel over her shoulder. Her face was expectant, and he realized she was waiting for him to speak.
"Don't do this, Draco. You have more fight than this," Snape said.
Draco barrels into the room, stomping across the floor like a man on a mission. His angry strides take him right past Harry; Draco doesn't even look at him, just tears across the rug until he comes to a stop at the reading table against the back wall.
If he looked at it from the outside, it would look like nothing had changed between them, and they were back in the tent, planning and strategizing. If only that were the case.
Molly looked up at that moment. “Harry, dear, you’re welcome to retire to the sitting area and open up that Ogden’s until dessert if you would be more comfortable.”
"Yes, I bet you did."
Draco's face is pinched around the edges, but there's no outright frown. He looks constipated.
The teasing banter is bursting bubbles of stuffy propriety and scattering her inhibitions into the wind like the snowflakes that swirl around them.
Harry grabs it and pulls him into a hug. "No, you daft git. But you will owe Draco an apology." Ron huffs and nods. "A sincere one."
. Experiences. Situations." He gestures vaguely. "Less…than conventional sexual practices."
"Harry! Oh, Merlin, fuck, Harry!" Draco's cock erupted between them as the coil of fire snapped, wringing his orgasm from him in white-hot pulses of flame. Potter was still latched on when his release found him, and his deep, dark groan of pleasure vibrated through Draco's body.
Not once does his grip on his cock falter. Not once does his pleasure wane.
Ron braced his hand on the door and shook his head. "I'm sorry, Harry. He doesn't want to see you."
"I know," Harry says, still laughing. He snatches the pillow from Ron's hands. "And it's funny."
“What? Is that one of your Muggle expressions?”
Harry is silent as he crouches down and urges Draco's feet apart with his hands. Draco's arse is right above his head, and for a second, he wants to lean forward and bite and lick at the offering before him. To shove his face between those muscled cheeks and thrust his tongue inside. To make Draco shake and scream his name. To beg for mercy.
The line of Potter’s jaw relaxed and he stumbled over a terse, “Thank you.”
The second his hand touched Potter’s shoulder, Potter’s eyes flew open and he snarled, grabbing Draco and flipping him over onto the bed. Potter slammed Draco into the mattress, straddling him with hard thighs, one hand wrapped around Draco’s wrist, the other wrapped around his neck, pinning him down.
. He looks absolutely unruffled at Harry's sudden presence at their side. It's either a Slytherin thing or a pureblood thing, Harry surmises, because Zabini affects a cool arrogance while Draco maintains a cool disdain. He's all polish and galleons in silk-embroidered robes, with strong, white teeth gleaming against smooth, dark skin. Rich brown eyes glitter as his gaze rakes over Draco hungrily—it's the look the hunter gives the rabbit that has slipped the snare.
He adds with a frown, "Push all you like, but I won't go where I'm not wanted." Harry waits to see if the Manor is stubborn enough to respond, but the room goes quiet. Whether that's in offense or tacit agreement, he doesn't know, and really doesn't care. He casts one more look at the empty bed before turning to the bathroom. The one thing he does know is that the image of Draco in his bed is more than pleasing. It feels right.
Potter’s head shot up just before he came, capturing Draco’s lips in a surprising kiss. The metallic tang of blood lingered on Potter’s full lips as he ravaged Draco’s mouth, and Draco found himself opening for Potter’s tongue without a thought. Potter shuddered against him, his voice rasping out in the moist, heated air between them.
What breath was left stuttered in his lungs, and stars began to dance behind Draco’s eyes. He fought to gasp, curling his fingers into the sweaty stubble of Potter’s cheek, clawing at his face, but Potter seemed no closer to relenting. Draco went cold. Potter had no intention of letting go until Draco was dead.
"About potions, perhaps."
Harry frowned. "I don't know, but I'm going to find out," he said, turning to head up the stairs. "I'll let you know. And Hermione?" he called over his shoulder.
“Well, why the hell not? The two of you danced around for ages.”
Draco’s hand curled into the soft strands of hair at Harry’s nape, chuckling. “No offense, Potter, but I think someone’s beat me to it.” Harry’s laugh rumbled against his skin, and damn if it didn’t feel good.
Draco is hot and tight and Harry strokes him twice before edging in a second finger. Draco tenses, and Harry's hand curls tighter as he fucks deeper with his fingers. Draco's pupils are blown wide, leaving only a tiny ring of stormy gray around the black center.
"Friendship? Companionship?" Harry folds his hands in his lap. "A mutual physical attraction?"
It was obvious this was the only step Potter was going to take. Perhaps it was the only one he knew how to take. So, Draco decided he would pave the way. This time.
Ron shrugs. "Not separately," he offers.
"Well," she says, amused, "it looks as though you two had a lovely chat last night."
"Good boy." Harry smiles down at him. "Now give me that arse."
The chuckles thunders into a full-blown guffaw of delight, and his arm tightens on hers as they reach the greenhouse. "Flip-flops, you say? What would the world think of Lady Malfoy with bare toes and naked ankles?" He leans in. "Scandalous."
"You said you arrived yesterday." Draco's chin lifts in accusation.
"Join the club," Draco sneered. "How do you think I felt when Severus died? I loved my godfather. As much as I would imagine you loved yours. It doesn't make your loss any greater than mine."
The opening of "Grimoires in Gesso" is in full swing. It seems everyone has crawled out of the woodwork to take a gander at what The Savior of the Wizarding World has been up to. The fruits of his labor are hanging on the gallery walls for all to see (and purchase, Millicent Bulstrode is quick to remind him). He smiles at the thought of Luna's pushy girlfriend, and his eye manages to find her quite easily in the crowded gallery, happily taking galleons off patrons. She shakes hands and nods with a smile, pocketing the velvet pouches with practiced ease. Her head darts up and catches Harry staring, and she makes a beeline for him. She approaches him with a friendly glare.
He smiles over his shoulder. "Now who's generous with the praise?"
Potter shifted restlessly on top of him, and Draco felt Potter’s cock stir against his own. He pushed aside his growing desire in favor of Potter’s comfort, Potter’s need. His hand slid down Potter’s back and beneath the waistband of his sleep pants to run his hand over the curve of Potter’s muscled, bare arse. The gesture was welcomed with the teasing lick of Potter’s tongue on his neck and Draco bit his lip to keep from crying out. He played there for a few moments, relishing the texture of Potter’s bare skin, and the hard muscle beneath it, squeezing as if his palm could commit the feel to memory.
Draco chatted amicably with Hermione, and exchanged a few words with Bill and George when he noticed Potter becoming increasingly more agitated next to him. He was wound so tight, Draco thought he might snap under the strain at any moment. He made a show of smoothing his napkin and let his left hand drift under the table to rest on Potter’s thigh. Potter visibly tensed as Draco squeezed to remind him of his presence. A cool hand gripped his and made to push it aside, but Draco thrummed his fingers and Potter froze.
She licks at them, chasing his taste. "Wh—what makes you say that?"
Draco went still beneath him, managing his fear to slow his breathing to a deep and even cadence. The fingers that were digging into Potter’s cheek flattened, and he began tap.
Draco collapses to the floor as the sob pierces the air. The seal is broken, and his anguish comes pouring out, even as the pleasure keeps spiraling in his blood. He cries and screams, tears pouring from his eyes, choking on his own spit. Snot drips from his nose, and he's hot and shamed and terrified and aroused all at once.
He swallowed hard, fighting against the lump in his throat. "Potter, getting married won't—"
"She is," Harry says fondly. "It's a little bittersweet for me. After I lost Hedwig, I never bought another. Couldn't stand to. Hedwig meant too much to me."
"But I can guarantee that Draco will," Harry replies. "He'll have no compunction about telling Hermione about your little visit, and will probably elaborate on the degree of your stupidity. It will amuse him greatly."
Draco stood up from the table and walked into the sitting room. “Not as hungry as I thought I was.”
“Right,” Ron sniffed in disdain.
Harry shifts until he's centered between Draco's feet, and then slowly, deliberately, reverently, kisses the tops of Draco's feet in turn. It's feather light, this worship, and Harry bends with a deference and veneration he's never felt before. He's never prostrated himself before a sub, and he realizes it's because he's never been with anyone who deserved it as much as Draco. He's always taken care of his partners, but this is a gesture of trust that was unthinkable before—a testament to how deeply he's affected by Draco.
