“But, sir —“ Harry continued. “Does Snape — Er, Professor Snape — know that Draco, I mean Malfoy, Malfoy doesn’t really want to go through with it? I thought that might be important,” Harry added lamely.
With a glance at Ginny, who ever-so-slightly tilted her head upwards, Harry followed Draco to a hidden corner of the platform.
...the walks they could go on, the misunderstandings they could continue to work out...Harry was going to
“Anyway, Harry, that’s all I wanted to say,” Draco went on. “I hope you and Ginny are very happy together. Guess we’ll see each other here every year at least, since Scorpius is starting school. Have a good one.” He turned to go.
— had tried, time and again, to get him to talk. Harry didn’t run away, even after the Katie Bell and Snape encounters. He’d offered to
His happiness did not go unnoticed by Ron and Hermione, who attributed it to breakthroughs Harry had in Dumbledore’s lessons. Dumbledore himself, who saw Harry panting into his office once or twice at eight, was ever more amused.
The next night did not go nearly so smoothly. Harry felt his stomach clench — a now sickeningly familiar feeling — as he hazily recounted the day’s events. He had just missed his appointment with Malfoy for the first time — the
Meanwhile, Draco kept his ears perked up at any news of Harry. He knew he couldn’t do anything about it if Harry had been caught, but he was still dying to know what was going on. Death Eaters often came in and out of Malfoy Manor conveying filthy pieces of news about the various wrongdoings they’d committed. Once or twice, Draco even heard about his classmates’ entire families being murdered.
Harry’s insides turned over. He simply couldn’t bear seeing Draco walk away from him once more without saying anything.
“Did you hex him, Draco?” Pansy asked, leaning over, her eyes full of desire. “He doesn’t look hexxed,” she continued disapprovingly after giving Harry a once-over.
Draco thought he could laugh with relief. He wiped his tears furtively onto his sleeve before turning around. Harry wasn’t onto his plan, after all.
“Of course!” Harry jumped as he looked at Draco with an expression akin to a seven-year-old who had just solved a puzzle. “How could I not have thought of...I saw it!” Harry began gesturing wildly.
Harry was in the middle of a mind-numbingly dumb conversation with McLaggen, replaying scenes from earlier and begging for release, when he heard the noise. Filch burst into the room holding onto the cuff of —
Harry glowered at the fire burning across from him. It was a nice night, he had no homework or essay to work on, and his two best friends in the world were sitting next to him. He should be having fun. He should be having a nice night. So why couldn't he stop
When he pulled back, Harry looked into Draco's eyes and remembered all the things he'd once thought were impossible, too: defeating Voldemort once and for all, facing a dragon, breaking out of Gringotts – hell, being a wizard.
“Uh, sorry?” Malfoy was biting his bottom lip. Harry did not find this distracting in the least. It did not make him picture Malfoy biting Harry's lip while-
Additionally, any current or prior student who wanted was invited to stay over the summer to assist in rebuilding the school. They'd only been there a month, but they'd managed to get most of the reconstruction done already. That left the students with plenty of time to cram their missed knowledge in over a summer.
“Yes, of course I have. Why wouldn't I? I'm a great boyfriend.” Malfoy just nodded again, not looking slightly amused at Ron's defensiveness or embarrassment.
“I just... I know you've been watching me, following me. It's like sixth year all over again. I don't blame you, I really don't. But I'm not doing anything, I swear. I just want to come back and finish Hogwarts, get a quiet job somewhere, and never cause another problem.” Harry gulped. “You can check my bags, my wand, my chambers, anything you want. I'll take Veritaserum and you can question me. I'm not doing anything.”
Ron tapped his quill against the library table rapidly. Hermione was too absorbed in her new dragon name book to pester Ron into writing his essay, which gave him plenty of time to think about
“That was also a very nice gift you gave him for his birthday.” Draco was proud that he was able to keep his face blank, not a trace of flush. He quirked one eyebrow, but Ginny answered for him.
“Take away the war. We're just two students at Hogwarts. I'm a female Slytherin following you around and always staring at you. Always trying to be near you, needing to know what you're doing. What would you assume then?” Malfoy's face made it clear he was completely lost.
“Do tell, Malfoy: what was that before?” Draco didn't even pay attention to who was taunting him now. He stormed out of his chair and the common room, muttering something about idiots and not answering to them. He could hear Hermione chastising them as he left.
“What the hell is this?” Draco grumbled on entering the Eighth Year common room. There was no one in the room, but there were balloons in clumps around the floor and posters hanging on all the walls. Our Hero, one of them read. Savior of the Wizarding World, cried out another. Everything was in red and gold, of course. Draco felt his stomach twist.
“Wow.” Draco shook his head. “You really are shit friends.” Ron started raging towards him, wand suddenly out, when someone walked in.
He had been hard at work for two hours before sitting back to study his work. He hated that he wasn’t able to make it perfect – his hands shook ever so slightly, and the whole process was new to him. But he was confident the end product would still be great.
? At first he'd thought the guy just wanted as many allies in the Wizarding World as possible, but he wasn't going out of his way to befriend – impress? - anyone else. He was polite to all of the Gryffindors since coming back this year, but nothing like he was with them. He was focused on the three of them.
As he rinsed off, Draco thought back to the last time he'd had an actual conversation with Harry. Almost three years ago, Harry had owled him out of the blue. He'd said he had something important he wanted to discuss with Draco in person and asked him to meet him later that week at a café in Diagon Alley.
“Well. No war, of course. No death. Just normal kids going to Hogwarts. We still have our rivalry, but it's friendly. Innocent. When I realize that I don't hate you, not at all – when I realize that my flushed face and flipping stomach and racing heart when you’re near me are for entirely opposite reasons – I don't feel like an idiot. I feel like... me and you, we're possible.” After a silent moment, Draco spoke again, still very softly.
“I don't know why you think I saw him. I didn't even sit down before you accosted me.” Daphne sighed.
“I don't get it.” Ron threw his parchment on the coffee table under his feet. Hermione continued reading without a glance at her boyfriend. “We've asked everyone. No one has come clean. Almost everyone has solid alibis.” Harry ignored him as well, eating a chocolate frog he'd stored from their most recent trip to Hogsmeade. “Were you just letting us believe what Hermione said about roommates, but you actually snuck someone else in?” Harry shrugged, pulling his card out of the package. Nicholas Flamel. Shrugging was the only response he'd given to Ron the past two days regarding his 'secret lover'. Ron groaned, leaning back against the back of the couch.
"Much simpler than people." Malfoy smiled so innocently that Harry's heart clenched. That wasn't an expression he'd ever seen or even imagined on Malfoy.
“Shut up. I meant why on Earth would you... like me?” Harry finally looked at him, quirking an eyebrow.
“You stalk me in sixth year. Attack me with a violent spell for no real reason. Risk your life to save mine in the Battle of Hogwarts. Defend me in my trials. Tell everyone I'm innocent. Come back to Hogwarts and watch me again, looking for anything I'm doing wrong. Make it seem like you don’t even hate me anymore when we talk. Then fervently defend me again to a Prophet reporter.”
“Seriously, Harry. Who gave that to you?” He hesitated, looked back to his parchment, then shrugged. Draco had forgotten what a terrible liar the idiot was.
Harry playing with Teddy. Draco's heart raced when he remembered the unbridled joy on Harry's face while watching his Godson. If Draco could ever make Harry smile like that, he just might decide all the years of unrequited love were worth it.
“Forever the Golden Boy.” After Malfoy squeezed his shoulder, he turned and walked away. Harry unabashedly watched him retreat – specifically his ass – until he was out of sight down the hallway. When he was gone, Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.
But it was their first Christmas as a couple, and he wanted something really special. He knew people didn't think of him as intelligent, and definitely not sensitive. He figured Hermione didn't expect any thoughtful kind of present from him. Which was exactly why he knew he needed to give her just that.
“You got him a gift?” Ginny asked quietly. He looked up at her with a mischievous smirk. Her confused look turned to disappointment. “Really, Draco? It better not be something awful. I swear-”
“Act like that. Don't argue or fight at all. Act all stiff and proper and polite with each other.” Draco smirked.
Twenty minutes later, Harry was still nowhere to be seen. Ron had started to worry at ten. The war was over, the Dark Lord gone, but that didn't mean Harry couldn't still be in trouble. Some of his fans were absolutely mental. Who knows what some of them would do if they got their hands on him?
“Why in the hell would you give me a broomstick?” She didn't even bother mentioning it was the fastest, most expensive broom yet, one that had just been released. Malfoy shrugged. Like it was no big deal.
“But... you've been watching me all year. Staring at me. Following me.” Harry bit the side of his cheek. He was Harry
“We should get inside,” Draco stated the obvious. Harry nodded, unfolding the cloak with one snap of his wrists. He looked back to the blond.
“Listen,” He said, not particularly kindly. “I've given you guys plenty of articles. There's nothing else for me to say. You know my favorite color, what food I like, how many Quidditch games I've won. What else can you possibly write?” The man wasn't fazed by Harry's obvious annoyance. He sat his hat down beside him and pulled his quill to the parchment.
“Please. I've had to cook since I was practically Teddy's age.” When Draco looked closer at him, he noticed Harry's smirk flicker. He didn't think Harry had meant to say that. Harry jumped to his feet and started cleaning up the kitchen, pointedly not facing Draco. “And I didn't think Draco Malfoy would be a good babysitter, but here we are.”
“Merlin!” Draco felt like he was just about on fire. “Do you have to be so vulgar? Why are you always here? This isn't even your common room.”
“Malfoy,” Harry grunted. He didn't take his eyes off the boy when he started pulling off his Quidditch practice jersey. His breath hitched at the sudden sight of Malfoy's bare chest. If Malfoy noticed him staring at him intently, he didn't say anything.
“He follows me around so I will insult him just because he's so sick of being worshiped.” There was a profound silence.
“Look at us,” he repeated. Neither of them said anything for a while. Draco studied the water as he continued picking the weed apart. If someone had told him a year ago that this is where he would end up, Draco wouldn't have believed them. Calmly enjoying a view of the lake at Hogwarts with none other than Harry Potter.
“Mr. Harry Potter!” Harry didn't hide his annoyance. He opened his eyes to see a well-dressed man he'd never met before. “Wow, what an honor.” He held a hand out and Harry shook it with blatant suspicion.
But as his last year of school came to a close, Draco realized that he had no other idea of what he wanted to do. Sure, he was intelligent and had scored very well on his N.E.W.T.s. But he didn't want to work for the Ministry (perhaps he would have been more inclined had he known about Potter's plans to regulate it). He wasn't sure who would hire him, and he certainly didn't think anyone would trust him to make Potions for them. He couldn't imagine becoming a professor. He considered Healer, textbook writer, and a dozen other jobs, but none of them seemed right. As every job he thought of fell apart, Draco had turned back to George.
“About not wanting to argue. I'm just curious.” Draco flushed and, realizing the weed was as picked apart as it could be, tossed it to his side. He hadn't been playing the stupid muggle game, but he did happen to notice that if he had been, it would have ended on
“It looks like you're bothering me while I try to study.” Potter looked around in a dramatic gesture.
Ron walked away as Harry started brainstorming. He slowly sat down on his bed. Well, there was the last step he wanted, and he'd cracked the case.
“What? No. Now I'm never going to stop.” Draco rolled his eyes, trying to hold back his grin, and started walking again.
Malfoy was smart. Harry had always known that, to some degree. He was second in the class, just behind Hermione. Harry was used to seeing him scoring well on tests. When they were young, he was smug and loud about it. He did just as well now – often better – yet he never bragged anymore.
“Love feels no burden, thinks nothing of trouble, attempts what is above its strength, pleads no excuse of impossibility; for it thinks all things lawful for itself, and all things possible.”
“Hear, hear. Pansy, let’s go back to your story about your cat getting into Nott’s potions cabinet. I need to hear the end of that.”
Due to all of the events during their schooling distracting them – the Chamber of Secrets mess, dealing with Umbridge, and the final year with Death Eaters who bordered on torturing students on a regular basis, to name a few – any current Hogwarts student was welcome to return over the summer to catch up on their studies before completing their final year.
“The Potter look,” Blaise answered. “The one you only wear whenever he's around or you're thinking about him. Which hasn't been all that much recently, so where did you see him?”
Outside of the Owlery, he slowed to a normal pace. Malfoy didn't notice him right away. He was sitting on one of the stools with a small brown owl sitting on his arm.
"I love you too, Harry." he said, ignoring the shock of green eyes that stared him down as Harry bolted upright. A slow smirk wound its way across Draco's face as he added, "Potter."
"I'm yours." He vowed, not entirely sure what prompted this change but definitely on board with it. His hands settled on Draco's hips, not guiding but holding him as he sunk back down until his ass was pressed cleaned against Harry's pelvis. Throwing his head back in a moan, Draco gripped the poster beside Harry's head and used it for balance as he rode the other boy frantically, twisting his hips at a vengeful pace that had both their chests heaving in tandem. Behind them the headboard smacked loudly with every desperate movement, matched by hoarse pants and guttural moans. Harry's hands roamed every part of Draco he could reach, tugging at his hips to get himself deeper inside the blond, gripping his ass just to feel Draco clench around him, raw lust driving the drag of fingers along the Slytherin boys stomach to hear the stupid little sigh he emitted. Harry was gone for Draco, and that was something he didn't think would ever change.
Draco snorted, blinking up at the ceiling for a moment before responding. "Mind untying me now, the feeling's starting to lose its luxury now that this is all over and we're disgustingly sweaty."
"Always so primitive, Potter." He grumbled. Returning to stand in front of the bashful Gryffindor, Draco yanked the scarf that hung loose from the scarred boy's neck. Wrapping it around his own he fought back the smile that threatened to break across his face at Harry's pleased look.
"Education first, then I'll pamper you the entire night," Harry stated, pressing a firm kiss to Draco's forehead, which the blond pretended not to enjoy.
"Fuck." The blond shouted, sound punched out as his head flung back in pleasure. All too soon Draco was rocking against the fingers inside him, trying to drive them deeper, preening when Harry managed a lingering touch against the spot inside him that made Draco all but sob into the sheets. Harry watched every single moment with intense focus, never wanting to miss a second. Draco was truly beautiful like this, lost to pleasure and desperate. His hands shook, chest heaving as the prideful glint that always flickered in his eyes gave way to pure want. Back arched like a cat in heat on every thrust of Harry's fingers as they stretched him open, goosebumps littering the skin alongside sucked bruises Harry couldn't stop himself from leaving across his shoulders.
"What do you think you're doing?" Harry asked and the words rolled off his tongue raggedly, as if every breath pained him. Draco shuddered, eyes flitting open and so overblown by his pupils Harry couldn't help the groan that echoed out from him.
The blond just scowled back, side stepping Weasley and nearly knocking over Potter's stuffy friend as she appeared around the corner, books huddled to her chest threatening to slip over at the assault.
Unthinking Draco sprung forward, clawing at Harry's shirt and slotting their mouths together in a firm kiss. Startled, Harry was sluggish to respond but when he did his hands grasped tightly at Draco's cheeks. Their breaths mingled and chests rose and fell in tandum with one another, Harry's tongue searching as it skimmed the roof of Draco's mouth. Breaking away Draco rested his forehead against Harry's, enjoying the warmth of skin for a brief moment before pulling back, face impassive as he corrected the collar of his shirt and smoothed the sleeves of his robe.
Draco’s hands shook in an unmistakably familiar fashion as he looked Harry dead in the eye, his face resuming an unmistakable hatred. Returning his enemy’s stare with equal coldness, Harry suddenly realized that things were never really going to change for him and Draco.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco looked curiously at the boy who he had — he realized with a jolt — considered his friend.
“No, he’s right,” Draco replied, looking solemn. “I deserve it. Thank you, all of you. On top of saving my life, my family and I are indebted to you for defeating the Dark Lord. We were miserable under his rule.”
,” Draco responded sarcastically. “The Dark Lord just wants me to go for an afternoon stroll with him and invite him for tea.
“Ah right, the little bastards,” Draco replied as he rustled his hair back into place. “So...coffee?”
With a swift motion that became so familiar it was basically a habit, the lovers undressed and took each other.
Sitting at the long dining table that used to be saved for special occasions — like Draco’s birthdays, it made him shiver to remember — Draco could hardly contain himself when he saw Snape walk in. His mother kicked him under the table as he clenched his fists.
Harry thought it was incredible that Ginny had not wanted to do this earlier, especially with all the gorgeous women she played Quidditch with, but he couldn’t support the idea more. It had been
“Yeah, er, good luck,” Draco responded lamely, though secretly thinking that it was he, Draco, who needed luck tonight.
Crabbe and Goyle seemed convinced at Draco’s tone and turned to look for Harry. Draco grimaced as he thought of a way to distract his friends. They, after all, knew positively nothing about Draco’s...affairs. Or his sexuality, for that matter.
Convincing himself of this theory before he could think twice about it, Harry pulled out the Marauder’s Map and located Draco standing outside a classroom on the third floor. Pulling on his invisibility cloak, Harry set off on his pursuit.
“So who are you taking to Slughorn’s Christmas party then?” Draco asked with what he hoped would be an innocent voice, his body limp with exhaustion from their recent sexcapade.
With one look at his enemy-turned-lover-turned-back-enemy, Harry realized that Draco was being serious. Anger — pure rage — reached Harry’s fingertips as a burst of red light came out of Harry’s wand.
This chapter is kind of an aside and I use it to explain Harry’s realizations about sexuality and polyamory. Feel free to skip if you’re just looking for Drarry action/would prefer to think of them as monogamous (The Epilogue might not make as much sense though).
“But I’m touched,” Draco continued before he lost his nerve, not even sure himself how sarcastic he was being. “Since when do you actually care about my safety? I thought we were just fucking.”
But, Draco reminded himself that he was lucky to even be alive. If the Dark Lord had realized the full extent of his betrayal, Draco would not be here to have these angsty thoughts. Luckily, his mother had made Aunt Bellatrix swear to cover for him, to say he’d had a change of heart at the last moment and intended to carry out the original plan after all.
The days dragged into weeks into months, and still no news of Harry. Draco felt sick to his stomach at what the Dark Lord had been making him do, but comforted himself in knowing, at least, that Harry was alive. After all, there’d be victory parties at his home had Lord Voldemort succeeded in killing
“He already knows,” Draco replied. “The only reason I’m still alive is that the Dark Lord wants to turn me into a spy and continue to punish me and my parents. Death would be far too generous for what we’ve done.” With a deep breath, Draco added, “Plus, I don’t care what he thinks anymore.”
Now that Draco thought about it, he convinced himself that it was possible. But nevermind that thought...whatever Harry may have been thinking before, he certainly hated Draco now. The thought made Draco’s body ache, and not in the magnificent way that Harry used to make Draco’s body ache. If only he could get that back.
, he added in his mind. No matter what Dumbledore or Harry might think, Draco knew the truth — that Snape was working for Voldemort and would stop at nothing to help Draco complete his mission.
Draco had been spending sleepless night after sleepless night. Though he knew that Harry had escaped the Dark Lord the night he was moved, Draco couldn’t forgive himself for his futile attempts to save Harry. He had made a last ditch effort to send the note “He knows” through a borrowed owl to any Order member it could find, only to discover that all the owls to and from Malfoy Manor were intercepted.
we’re talking about — but he couldn’t help that Draco’s hot-and-cold interactions were leaving him with an empty feeling in his stomach.
“I mean, Ron and Hermione know I’ve been seeing — well, hooking up with — someone. But I didn’t think you’d want anyone to know the details.” Harry was quite honestly not sure where this was going.
in a polyamorous situation with Ginny and Draco,” she said as though it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Draco looked like he was about to break down. “I didn’t mean to. It was a mistake. I’m not lying.” He prayed Harry would believe him.
“Why are you telling me this?” Harry felt relieved, but simultaneously alarmed. “If Voldemort found out…”
“Ronald, you’re so insensitive sometimes!” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “Okay, all the time,” she added. “If Harry doesn’t want people to know, he must have a good reason for it, don’t you Harry?” She gave him an all-too-familiar knowing look, which he found in equal parts comforting and annoying.
Harry could not have imagined that he’d be visiting under these circumstances, when he was sure to be near his death, and yet…
“Er, yeah, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t spread it around, thanks,” Draco replied, clearly relaxed. “Are you seeing anyone else then?”
Sick of this exchange, which had been repeating itself in Harry’s head every day for the last several months, Harry screamed into his pillow.
besides stand there helplessly to watch his enemy-lover-friend corner the man he looked up to most in the world.
Harry swallowed. Draco’s eyes had never looked more clear. “I believe you, Draco, and I wish things were different. But you must know that I can’t...we can’t...we could never—”
Sure enough, Harry pulled off his invisibility cloak, his body shaking. “What the bloody hell was that?” He demanded. “How come Snape’s helping you? What are you up to that I don’t know about? What’s an Unbreakable Vow?” Draco had to admit, watching Harry’s chest heave for him like this was kind of touching.
“Well, she knows I was sort of seeing someone else last year, but I didn’t say who,” Harry responded, his heart sinking. He felt guilty for keeping anything from Ginny, but he and Draco had agreed not to speak of their relations. Luckily, Ginny didn’t pry. But, Harry couldn’t help feeling angry at himself still. He may even have forgotten to specify the gender…
Harry looked beyond Draco at a young boy with uncannily similar looks to his childhood rival, accompanied by a beautiful woman with sleek brown hair.
Feeling himself starting to melt again, Harry forced himself to pull away. Giving Draco one last determined look, Harry described that he was searching for something that Voldemort would find extremely valuable, potentially relating to Rowena Ravenclaw…
— Draco pleasured himself. He imagined inviting Harry to fuck him in this bathroom, against this wall perhaps, crouched over that toilet seat. He let these glorious thoughts overtake him when he heard a noise outside —
Harry had not felt so understood in his life. Of course, it all made sense to him. He definitely thought of Ginny still, especially when he was strolling through a forest or enjoying a good bit of sunshine. It made his heart ache that she could not be there to accompany him in those moments…
Harry just stared. All these years, Draco had dreamed of cornering Harry Potter — the famous Harry Potter — and making a fool of him. Yet, there he was, looking pathetically at Draco’s mercy, and neither moved an inch.
Hermione gave Draco an understanding look, while Ron still seemed skeptical. With nods at them, Draco turned around to watch the reaction of the person he truly cared about...
“DRACO...MALFOY...YOU...FUCKING...DICK...FUCKHEAD,” Harry yelled as he’d never yelled before. “DON’T think I don’t know what you did.”
Luckily, Ginny had been on exactly the same page. “I know I’m a little old to be saying this,” she had told him during one of their particularly intense discussions. “But, our kids aren’t babies anymore, and...I reckon it’s time for me to explore my sexuality.”
A few moments later, he was standing in front of the stone path leading up to the Tonk's quaint house. Mother had invited Andromeda and Teddy to live with her in the Manor, but his Aunt had politely declined in favor of staying in her small, one-story home on a popular wizarding street. A few years ago, Draco would have thought her mad. The manor was incredible, beautiful, and full of anything you could ever need.
“So, I want to know why. At first I thought you were doing something as absurd as trying to be my... friend, or something. But you don't talk to me or try to be friendly. I don't understand what you're doing.” There was a long moment of silence, and Draco figured he was not going to answer.
Draco still had no idea why Harry had brought him there to tell him all of that until Harry had stopped rambling and cleared his throat.
“Wow! That sounds amazing, Teddy. Well, it looks like Potter's here to hang out with you for tonight, so-”
It was silent in the library, save for the scratching of quills against parchments and the ever-annoying Weasley drumming his fingers on the table.
There was an awkward silence. Malfoy noted the questioning expressions and confused looks among them.
It hadn't been long after returning to Hogwarts that Draco admitted to himself that part of his obsession with Harry – at least for the last few years – was attraction. He'd always found Harry attractive, as long as he'd known he was gay. You couldn't really deny how handsome the man was. It wasn't
, like he was saying something dirty. “You were an arrogant prick, and I was an idiot. You pissed me off on purpose and it worked, and I hated the way you treated me and my friends, and you annoyed me.
“Well, I won it in a contest. But after riding it once, I just can't bring myself to part with my Firebolt. I wanted to give it to someone else.”
“Malfoy, I-” But Malfoy was already standing up. He rooted in Harry's chest until he found the cloak, throwing it on before Harry had even figured out what to say.
After finishing the novel from yesterday and eating lunch, Draco pulled out some books on Alchemy. He'd forced himself to stop working over the weekends, per George's request that he didn't kill himself, but he didn't count research as work; he enjoyed it too much.
“I was hoping I could ask you a few questions about one of your classmates. Draco Malfoy.” Harry narrowed his eyes.
“You know what I mean!” Harry just continued looking at him with the same quirked eyebrow. Draco sighed. “You want me to say it? I was a Death Eater and you're the Chosen One.” Harry's expression turned sad.
The rest of the pile came from an assortment of people responding to the letters he'd sent them – Andromeda about Teddy, Mrs. Weasley about nothing in particular, Mr. Weasley about Muggle TVs, Kingsley about working as an Auror, and some others he didn't even remember sending.
Although Draco had come a long way in accepting himself and recognizing that he wasn’t an entirely terrible person, he wasn't fool enough to believe for one second that Harry Potter would ever be interested in him.
“I've certainly told you we need to break into new markets. This could be a good start.” George grinned again. He was always happier when he didn't need to pester and convince Draco for weeks. “A confidence potion would be a best-seller, if we were able to perfect it.”
“My shift ended early. I wanted to check if you had found a babysitter.” He hugged his Aunt when she outstretched her arms.
“Oh? What exactly do you call what you and Harry do everyday?” Instead of flushing, like he would have expected, the color drained from his face. He narrowed his eyes.
They met Hermione coming back from the library on their way and corralled her to the Great Hall with them. As they walked, Ron filled Hermione in on the 'situation'. She berated them for invading Harry's privacy and told them to leave him alone.
“Draco and I had a discussion about what you all said earlier, and you were right.” Malfoy kept his face straight, too confused by Harry's somber voice to be embarrassed. He noticed Finnigan's smirk falter at the voice. “Our fighting was immature. We don't want to annoy you, and we certainly don't want to give you the wrong impression. We've agreed to stop fighting.”
Ron sat straight up again. “What?” Harry tossed the paper back to him. He watched as Ron read over the page again. “But the only one we left off is Malfoy. It's not like it could be...” Harry crunched off another bite, staring Ron down blankly. The color drained from Ron's face. “It's not...” He started again. Harry knew he was hoping Harry would deny it before he had to actually ask the question.
It was a surprising partnership, but one that worked well nonetheless. George handled the fun, quirky side – organizing the store, interacting with customers, and coming up with imaginative new ideas. Draco handled the practical side of actually making most of the products and creating the new ideas George came up with. He also reeled George in on ideas that were too wild, impossible, or simply not cost-effective.
“Whatever. It’s his business. So, tell us about seeing Harry.” Draco flushed ever so slightly, but figured he could pretend it was from just being out in the biting cold.
“Draco's just being the prick he always has been. Thought he'd grown out of it a tiny bit, but clearly not,” Ron growled. Draco just rolled his eyes. He noticed Harry glance around the common room like he was looking for something, then brought his attention back to them. He was finally smiling, if only a small raise of his mouth.
anything, and I knew that. But if you weren't my enemy, how could I... obsess over you?” Malfoy- Draco stopped walking suddenly. Harry took a few more steps before stopping, too. “I haven't been trying to figure out what you're up to. I've been imagining a world where things were different.”
“Did you actually talk to Harry?” Daphne tried to turn the conversation back to the only thing she wanted to talk about, apparently. Draco hesitated, turning over one of his chips. For some reason, he didn't want to tell them about that evening.
When Ron told Harry, his best friend had calmly tried to get him to see Malfoy's side of things – Voldemort in his house, fearing for his family's life, seeing how the Death Eaters tortured those who didn't obey. It took a while, several long conversations where Harry refused to give in, before Ron relented that he would
“All this time. Arguing. We could have been. Doing this.” Harry took a short breath between every few words. Draco laughed. There was a snap from a distance, pulling them both apart and reminding them where they were.
“Well, I might be a masochist, too,” he mumbled. Sitting beside this idiot and enjoying the way his heart was beating like a hummingbird's wings confirmed this.
with sending so many letters. He was just being social. It had nothing to do with the person who frequented the Owlery. Nothing to do with the softened expression on a certain blond’s face when an owl landed on his arm.
“That is true. I only thought... I remember that you and Hermione had quite a row at the Yule Ball. If I remember correctly, she yelled something about you ruining what was supposed to be a great night.”
. He almost wanted to ask Malfoy to keep saying it, over and over. He wanted to hear Malfoy say it while laughing at a joke, whisper it against his neck, yell it at him in a stupid fight. He wanted all of Malfoy.
to,” Malfoy interrupted gently. Their interaction made it clear this was a discussion they'd had before. “You shouldn't have to worry about that. Let me handle them.” When Harry leaned in and kissed Malfoy, Ron immediately turned away. He stood with his back against the wall, his mind racing. It had only been an instant, but he couldn't get the image out of his mind. Harry had kissed Malfoy like he'd done it a hundred times before, like there was nothing more he wanted to do in the world.
“Of course.” Harry checked the bedroom door before moving forward and kissing Draco sweetly. Draco blushed when he pulled back. Harry lightly touched his red cheek, then turned away to dig through his trunk.
“Draco, what are you doing out here?” Draco closed his eyes. Maybe if he ignored him and couldn't see him, he would disappear. “Draco?” he opened his eyes to Harry, looking concerned. “Are you all right?”
The cool air blew Harry's robes open. He pulled them tighter around his body, trying to keep out the winter air. It was one of the first nice days in a while, and Harry was enjoying it. He was happy to take some time for himself and enjoy the quiet for once.
“You all right, Draco?” George asked when Draco walked into work the next day. He sat down across from George on the other side of his desk.
“Lasagna!” Teddy cried happily as they sat down to dinner. Draco sat down to a plate of lasagna that looked just as good as what they might serve at Hogwarts, or the manor growing up.
“Oddly, they didn't leave a name. They just left it for me to find.” It looked like Granger could not possibly be more confused.
But he didn't want to sell it or give it to just anyone, since it was such an important house to a long-standing Wizard family. More importantly, it was something his Godfather had given him.
In the morning, Draco was torn between going to breakfast as soon as he could, waiting until breakfast was almost over, or just grabbing something from the kitchens and avoiding the Great Hall – and whatever story the Daily Prophet had undoubtedly printed – altogether.
Harry grinned widely. “You love it,” he whispered as he pulled the curtains tight against the bed. Malfoy gave a non-committal grunt as his lips found Harry's neck. Harry quickly flicked his wand to cast the necessary spells.
He did his best to focus, with faint images of Harry flitting across his mind. Harry catching the Snitch, Harry's face when they won the House Cup, Harry writing an essay, Harry dancing with Luna at a party, Harry Harry
Draco rolled up his sleeves, the air getting hot after working on Potions for so long in the fairly small room. Even though it was March and freezing outside, the room had long since moved past warm. After a moment of consideration, he charmed the roof hatch open. He hated to do it when it was so cold out, but he was dying in the heat.
Draco looked forward to find the three girls in chairs nearest him staring at him strangely. He immediately cleared the smirk that had lingered.
“Well. It's too bad you didn't get it for him.” Hermione wasn't sarcastic, just very pointed and slow. “It's one of his favorite gifts. He loves it.”
The first time Malfoy had tried to apologize to Ron a month into the school year, he'd scoffed and walked out before Malfoy could even really start. Malfoy hadn't even seemed angry or annoyed, rather looked like he thought that was reasonable.
“Yes-huh,” Draco responded. He ignored Potter snorting in amusement. “We did. At school, some of us liked to call each other by our last name. Like if I called you
But... Harry also had a big mouth. A big mouth that said stupid things over and over again without thinking, things that the Prophet gladly misconstrued. What if he said something about Draco – not even meaning to, not maliciously – and it destroyed his reputation anyway?
“Thank Merlin. I was afraid I was going to come in here to some gaudy decorations praising me, or something.” Draco met Granger's eyes pointedly, noting her blushing and turning away.
“I refuse to believe that.” Harry pulled back and smiled at him, and there was nothing Ron could say to convince himself Harry was looking at Malfoy with anything other than affection. “Seriously, Draco. It means the world to me, what you're doing. But you don't have to-”
“What about these two?” He gestured to Ron and Hermione. “They bickered like a married couple before...” he trailed off.
“How- this is- Oh, my goodness.” Hermione reached out to touch it, like she thought it was a mirage. “This is incredible! I- where did you find it?”
“There are people in the common room. Meet me somewhere else.” His face flushed, as if he was afraid the people 50 feet away and through a door could hear them. Harry bit his lip and turned his bedroom eyes up a notch. Or two. Malfoy gulped.
“Teddy! How are you?” Teddy started a long rant about what he and Potter had been doing so far that day, which apparently included dancing, hide and go seek, and pretending to be dinosaurs – not that Draco knew what that meant. But Draco nodded and smiled enthusiastically.
“Well, because he doesn't have confidence in himself, of course. He's doubting himself, despite all he did, because of the people he wasn't able to save and the things that were lost in the war.”
“I never said I thought you were doing anything wrong,” he blurted after a moment of weighing his options. “Well, in sixth year I did, but I was right about that.” Malfoy flushed, embarrassed at the memories. “But since the war, I’ve never accused you of anything, never called you out, never indicated I thought you were up to something.”
“I imagine you plan on sharing with your friends. Or does the Chosen One get to eat all of the cake while his friends watch? That does sound about right.”
“What a shame,” he said as he walked towards the bedrooms, his voice indicating that he didn't find it a shame at all. “Guess I better take a shower before I get my germs on everyone.”
The Prophet hadn't really mentioned it, but Draco had heard the rumors that Harry must be dating people in the muggle world. Whether it was actually Muggles, or witches he took there, no one was sure. If there had been any witches, Draco was impressed. Either the witches were loyal, honest people, or Harry had somehow convinced them not to say anything to the press.
“Harry, dear. You don't have to make me extra food every time you come over. You insult an old woman's cooking.”
Harry grinned as he looked up to met Draco's eyes. Draco immediately dropped his head down and pretended he wasn't listening. “You know what? I think it was.” Granger scoffed.
Hermione's suspicion turned to excitement as she scanned the title of the book. Ron wouldn't have been sure from the name, but the response from Hermione made it clear it was the book she'd been looking for the past two weeks.
Whenever Weasley and Harry were forced to be near each other, they made a dramatic scene of glaring at each other for far too long until one of them stormed away. It was annoying and awkward, and Draco found himself wondering if this is what it had been like when he and Harry constantly fought in earlier years. Draco was certain that two years ago, Granger or Weaselette or one of the other Gryffindors would have bothered Harry to apologize by now. But he saw now what Harry had meant – no one wanted to even
Draco took a deep breath. He didn't think seeing Harry like that again was a good idea. It wasn't smart to build his heart up that way just to not interact with Harry again for years.
Malfoy grabbed Harry's hand. “I want to be with you.” Harry started to respond, but Malfoy continued sharply. “I swear, if you say something as obtuse as, '
“I admit it might be a bit... over the top. But you probably haven't paid attention to him lately.” Draco held in a snort. There hadn't been a time in his life he hadn't paid attention to Potter. “He's been moping around the past few days. He doesn't listen to anyone when they show appreciation for what he's done, and nothing we say has been able to cheer him up! We just wanted to really show him how much he means to everyone.”
. For instance, did you know that Neville and Hannah Abott meet up almost every other night in the greenhouses?" Ron raised an eyebrow.
Ron hesitated. It didn't sound like Harry was in trouble, so eavesdropping felt wrong. But... but he was in the common room at two in the morning with Malfoy. So Ron cast a silencing charm on the door and cracked it open, just enough to see a glimpse into the room.
"You sure have been getting a lot of mail, Harry." Harry shrugged as he opened the letter. This one was from Ginny, telling him about her Quidditch training.
And... well, he'd seen the way Harry was looking at him. Even through a small crack in the dark, Ron had been able to see it. How comfortable they obviously were together. How happy Malfoy was making him. The rest of it occurred to him all at once – how happy Harry had been the past few months, the odd looks shared with Malfoy, the uncharacteristic worry that overtook him when Ron made a comment about the war.
“You coming to Charms, Draco?” He pulled himself out of his thoughts and saw he was one of the only people still in the room. Blaise was standing on the other side of the table. Draco quickly stood up and grabbed his books.
His potion smelled like treacle tart, the wood of a broomstick, and strawberry. It had taken him a while to realize the scent matched Harry's shampoo. He doubted Harry even used anything similar anymore, but it was what he associated with Harry, so it was what he smelled.
Harry hadn't noticed the blond turning the corner into the courtyard where he was sitting, but Draco had most certainly noticed Harry Potter talking to someone who was clearly a reporter. Venting. Angrily. Everyone knew that Harry avoided talking to the press at all costs, so why would he be sitting in the courtyard chatting with a reporter?
“Right! Right! Right!” Teddy was jumping up and down beside them, yelling. Harry knelt down to be at eye-level.
Ron smiled. “Nothing wrong at all, mate. I was just thinking that you might be right. I'm starting to think Malfoy isn't the absolute worst.” Harry was too surprised to hide the pure joy that spread across his face at that.
Now, Draco found he much preferred the cozy home to the cold, sharp edges of the Manor he'd grown up in. Even without the dreadful memories, it had never been a home. It was a
Draco kissed Harry gently, somehow better than every fantasy Harry had imagined. It wasn't wild and frenzied, it was soft and proper and so very
When Harry checked the map after dinner, he saw Malfoy alone in one of the abandoned classrooms. It was clear he was waiting for him, even though they didn't have plans to meet tonight. He stowed the map and headed out before any of his friends could be suspicious of where he was going. Harry found Malfoy charming a lone feather to float in patterns in front of him, sitting on the abandoned desk. Harry's cloak was folded neatly beside him. “Hey.” Malfoy nodded at him, slowly charming the feather to the ground. “I'm... I'm really sorry. I should have listened to you.”
“I don't know, fighting? Insulting each other?” He noticed the Weaselette doing that God damn sarcastic head nod.
“I suppose there is someone else out there who doesn't like you.” He swore he could feel Harry roll his eyes.
“I had put up some banners that were... less than complimentary of you. A sort of birthday present, if you will. But these two felt the need to tear them down, for some reason.” The grin returned, and Harry let his head fall to the back of the couch with his eyes closed.
The fire crackled loudly, warming Draco's legs in a very comforting way. He wasn't even pretending to write an essay or anything productive. He was simply taking a break in the common room, comfortable and warm and past full from dinner. Blaise was sitting in the chair across from him doing about the same thing, it seemed.
They continued a friendly argument, which Draco contributed to occasionally. They debated whether a fifth-year that was quite good would take the spot of Keeper, or if Akinns would still hold the title. Draco silently marveled at the idea that he was conversationally debating Quidditch with a Ravenclaw and two Gryffindors. Such a difference from where they had been a year ago.
But after changing his mind a dozen times, he headed to breakfast early. There was almost no one there, just some of the professors and a random scattering of students. Only three people sat at the Slytherin table – a group of maybe third years that Draco had seen but knew nothing about. He made a beeline to them, correctly guessing that they would have a copy of that day's paper. He cleared his throat, and they all looked up at him.
Ten minutes ago, Harry had seen Weasley enter the common room. The two made fierce eye contact before Weasley stormed off into the dorms with Thomas and Longbottom, who awkwardly nodded at Harry before continuing with Weasley.
“I'm totally about to get on that, 'Mione. Swear.” He exchanged a look with Weasley that indicated he probably never would.
“Draco!” Granger cried, clearly upset. “I thought you were over your petty rivalry. It's his birthday.”
100 times their size, robbed Gringotts, ridden a dragon, snuck in and out of the Ministry without being caught, and defeated the darkest Wizard in history.
Draco sipped on a butterbeer, doing his best to ignore all of the loud noises around him. There was a group of rambunctious students behind him, playing some game he'd never heard of that involved flicking coins at one another. The group around Potter was playing another game he didn't know that comprised of naming things one hadn't done and the others being forced to drink if they had done that thing. He assumed it was meant to be a drinking game, but they seemed to be having plenty of fun with only Pumpkin juice or butterbeer. There were a dozen loud conversations going on at once, but Draco wasn't paying attention to a single one.
and smiles and chatter as they opened a collection of gifts – some very nice Quidditch gloves, a book on obscure plants, some kind of plant that was supposed to change its color to match your mood, plenty of treats of all kinds, and a scarf that apparently the Weasley mother had made. It seemed strange for a gift in the middle of summer, but Potter clearly appreciated it.
Was he assuming – no doubt correctly – that Hermione would one day be someone extremely important in the Wizarding World? Maybe, but then why spend so much time winning over Ron, too? Just because they were dating? And what about Ginny?
No matter what snide or rude comments Ron made, Malfoy politely ignored them and continued being friendly. After a few weeks, Ron stopped being rude altogether. It wasn't even enjoyable when Malfoy would only be
“Come on, Malfoy,” Potter said before Teddy could whine again. “I think there's room enough for all of us.”
Potter was sitting on his own bed, legs hanging over as he watched Draco. He turned back to his book.
“Think he'd want to come to Hogsmeade with a bunch of Gryffindors next weekend?” Ron pretended he was fully focused on his plate as he asked, but he could see Harry smiling widely as he glanced over at the Slytherin table.
Draco cleared his throat. “My Aunt had asked me to babysit. When work let out early, I thought I would stop by in case she hadn't found anyone.” Teddy dropped from Potter's shoulders and ran up to Draco, who gladly picked him up.
“Would have had a lot more without you interrupting.” Harry's voice was calm. He was proud of how unaffected he was able to appear. Ron and Seamus both laughed, but stared at him expectantly. “Dinner?” He asked, his voice calm even though his heart was hammering. He started walking to the Common Room exit before they could respond.
“We had a very fun night. Everything's been taken care of. Leftovers from dinner are in the fridge.” Andromeda sighed.
It wasn't that Draco disliked the smell of his love potion. Like George had said, he wasn't even sure if that was possible. He hated making them for obvious reasons – one, the potion naturally made him a bit light-headed and giddy. He always left the window and the roof hatch open, but it still affected him more than he would have liked. Two, of course, was who it made him think of.
way, even while being pulled in a million different directions. We looked death in the eye at sixteen years old and came out two normal kids who can go back and finish school. If there is
That was why they were in the library in the first place. Harry glanced at his friends' parchment. Hermione's looked like it might have been completed and she was re-reading it for any errors. Even Ron had a few paragraphs in his messy scrawl.
“Are you looking to shag on the Common Room coffee table next?” Harry asked with a grin. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“I don't want to argue with you either,” Harry said softly, after some time. Draco was starting to think maybe his heart situation had nothing to do with the current situation, and he was actually just dying of a heart issue. When Harry bumped his shoulder to his and his heart immediately went haywire again, it was probably coincidence. “Look at us. Agreeing on stuff.” Draco chuckled.
“Oh, I just thought it made sense to give it to the best Quidditch player at Hogwarts.” Ron grinned when Ginny flushed and widened her eyes. She awkwardly cleared her throat.
“Really just need to worry about Ron, now. Ginny was sold from the broom, probably even just you telling her she's the best player at Hogwarts. Hermione's no issue now that you got her that book. Was it really in the Manor?”
“Or did you meet someone else?” Daphne asked, her voice slipping to excitement. Even though Daphne was also single and had been for some time, she was adamant on Draco trying to find someone. Particularly someone who had a chance of returning his feelings. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Well, kind of. Never know when you'll need it. But I wasn't doing anything wrong. I just went for a visit to Hagrid's. Wasn't sure if I'd be back before curfew.
“Ah, would you mind if I-” The student holding it handed him the paper before he'd even finished. Draco gulped. That was not a good sign. His hands were shaking as he grabbed it. A picture of him stared back from the front page. WHAT IS DRACO MALFOY UP TO? HARRY POTTER TELLS ALL. Draco closed his eyes.
He didn’t need to look at Malfoy. It didn’t matter what he was doing. Harry knew what he was doing, anyway – he was eating, and talking to his friends, and reading the Prophet, just like everyone else in the Great Hall. Just like Malfoy had done every single morning since the start of school.
Draco watched as Harry followed their gaze to the quill he was using. It was designed to look like a snitch. The ink jar was a mostly round golden ball, and the actual quill had two feathers sprouting from it, spread out like wings in motion. It was obvious just by looking at it that it was excellent quality, and no doubt expensive.
“Yeah. Just got pissed at some of the Eighth Years. Mostly Gryffindors, of course.” There was only the slightest bit of teasing there. Harry was quiet for some time.
“When we argue and fight and tease each other... I am flirting.” Draco struggled to find a response for longer than was normal, he knew. He recognized the flush slowly taking over Harry's face.
His mother hadn't wanted it, but insisted Draco take it and preserve their family home. After debating and thinking and arguing with himself for days, he'd finally owled Harry and accepted it. He tried to refuse taking it without paying him, but Harry had insisted. “I didn't pay for it. Sirius didn't pay for it. His parents didn't pay for it. It was paid for ages ago by someone I couldn't even name. I don't want anything for it.”
"Yeah. A lot simpler." Harry studied him again, his soft smile and the gentle hand moving through the feathers, the tie hanging loose around his neck. When Malfoy looked up again, Harry turned so he couldn't see his red face. "See you around, Malfoy.”
“They must be some kind of admirer if they go out of their way to get you something that nice and don't even take credit for it.” Draco did not have to look back up to know the idiot was grinning in amusement, still staring at Draco.
“You think we're impossible in this world?” Harry hesitated a moment before nodding. Draco grabbed Harry by the wrist to turn him around. His expression was intense when Harry met his eye. “You defeated the darkest wizard in the world. Twice. I managed to make it through the war unscathed, despite him living in my house and looking for a reason to kill me. We were the kingpins of a war a thousand times bigger than us, but we won the war
Resisting the urge to succumb to his lustful thoughts, Harry dressed himself and joined the others downstairs. Mustering up his determination, Harry resolved to push Draco out of his mind and focus all his efforts on the Horcrux hunt ahead.
Harry forced himself to make eye contact with Draco, and felt his knees buckle like they had all those years before.
Harry felt his entire body turn hot, as though engulfed in flames. Without another moment's thought, he grabbed Draco’s hand in his own and whispered, “It’s okay...It’s...okay.”
Harry thought he saw the faintest blush across Hermione’s cheek. “I have my guesses, sure, but that doesn’t matter. Anyway, it’s not like they’ve defined anything, right Harry? Also, aren’t you going to ask out Ginny?”
The two lovers moaned and groaned until they felt like their backs had broken. It seemed as though an eternity, but also just mere seconds, had passed when they finally allowed each other the peak satisfaction they so wildly craved. It was a magnificent culmination of their six years of back-and-forth tension. They got dressed in silence.
“Cool,” Draco continued. “Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, can I top this time? I’m feeling pretty daring after a month of having no one but Madam Pomfrey as company.”
Draco’s memories of Harry were the only thing keeping him from not choking himself with Wormtail’s hand. He rarely masturbated anymore — how could he, with
Draco shook his head and calmly returned to his Charms assignment a few chairs away. He knew plenty of people were still staring at him, but he ignored them in favor of his homework.
“Doing great, thanks!” There was another silence. Draco quietly picked at his roll, but didn't eat anything.
Three days. It had been three days. Draco sighed when he glanced up and saw Harry staring at the fireplace.
“Please do,” Draco called after him without turning away from the witch in front of him. “Are you done being gits? Do your friend a favor and don't do anything else to ruin his birthday.” He didn't give a chance to respond before grabbing the trash bag and storming out.
Harry took it as a game of hide and seek. “You know I’m furious at you beyond belief...but you also know that I can’t resist for too long. And nor can you,” he smirked.
“No…” Hermione continued carefully. “But...er...lust could. Or feelings...of the romantic sort. She was biting her lip so hard now, it might be swollen.
Before allowing himself to feel too happy about the answer to his recent confusions, he turned for Ron’s response.
“Look, you don’t have to tell me what you’re doing,” Harry continued, his voice gaining confidence. “But let me help you. I’ll help you in ways he won’t find out,” Harry added before Draco could protest.
Harry felt a surge of sympathy for his long-time enemy. How awful it would be to live his life knowing Voldemort was watching nearly every action, he couldn’t imagine.
“Or what? Gonna jinx me?” Draco retorted. He slowed down, taking his time deliberately, but did not loosen his grip.
After what seemed like an eternity, Harry finally looked up and nodded. Draco took the opportunity to sit down next to Harry.
“Er...yeah,” Draco quickly responded, putting on his best voice. “The idiot is probably off trying to do something heroic again.
“Yeah, and I’m gay,” Draco replied. “I finally told her. We’re getting a divorce. It’s not fair to her.”
Harry had not had the chance to think—or sleep— in what felt like an eternity. The weeks following Harry’s personal revelations were consumed by plotting and planning, breaking into Gringotts, and escaping on a Dragon.
“Snape...Snape did kill Dumbledore,” Harry responded. “Draco only disarmed him. He wouldn’t have done it...He was lowering his wand.”
“Look, I know I fucked up, but you didn’t have to spill my goddamn blood to prove a point,” Draco seethed.
Positively alarmed, Harry climbed down from the luggage rack and stared at his enemy. Was this feeling arising at the bottom of his stomach pity, or…?
“Shut up, I’ll work on it,” Harry commented, but his next words were engulfed by his friends’ laughter. Suddenly, none of the trio could breathe as they roared at the hilarity of the situation.
Harry’s heart was beating with a thud, still thinking about his latest vision. Only, it wasn’t the fate of the wandmaker that really made his insides squirm —
Meanwhile, Draco was quite pleased with himself. He had now successfully gotten Snape off his tail, revealed his true plan to his mother, and made substantial progress on the Vanishing Cabinet. Soon enough, his mother would come and join him, they would go to Dumbledore together, and this would all be over. His father was safely in Azkaban, and there was no one else in the world Draco cared about so Voldemort would not have anything to use. Except —
Harry looked intuitively at Ron, who was quickly buckling his belt. Ron gave Harry a guilty shrug, to which Harry could only grin.
Draco was growing desperate now. He had not realized how much he needed Harry. Surely, he had other lovers who could fulfill his desires...but none of them were like Potter. None of them cared. He thought this particular fuckbuddy situation was so hot because it was forbidden. He had not realized that Potter would become his friend.
“Oh, Harry, I’m sorry,” Hermione was looking at Harry with pure sympathy now. “You mustn’t blame yourself. Your ability to see the best in people reminds me of Dumbled—”
“Potter, your potion looks like it came from a puking pastille. You know Weasel products are banned, right?” Draco spat at Harry, with a convincingly disgusted look on his face.
Harry looked skeptical, but tilted his head forward ever-so-slightly in another motion resembling a nod.
The pressure of Harry’s finger and his mouth bobbing up and down were almost too much. With one look into Harry’s piercing green eyes — full of passion and lust for him, Draco, he couldn’t take it — he felt himself release.
Draco’s heart nearly beat out of his chest as he made eye contact with Harry — and yes, it was definitely Harry. He tried with all his might to keep it together.
Returning back to Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and the children, Harry couldn’t help but notice a new spring in his step.
Harry thought as he ejaculated, still focused on the dot. In the seconds after he stared at the ceiling in the peak moment of his ecstasy, Harry’s eyes returned to the map to give one last look at the dot. Only, it was gone…
This thought comforted Harry as much as it disturbed him. He quite honestly didn’t know what would be worse — being lied to by a Draco who was perfectly happy doing Voldemort’s bidding,
But he would be with Harry. If not physically, then at least in their hearts, on the same side of the war...and, Harry would
“Katie, look, I need you to deliver this package to Dumbledore, sealed. Do NOT open it or touch it under any circumstances. Don’t let anyone else touch it or get near it. Dumbledore will know what it is and who it’s from. Do you understand? Don’t touch it.”
After they finished this time, Harry didn’t let Draco leave. “Not so fast,” Harry said determinedly. “Sit your smug arse down and talk to me.”
Harry gulped. He had been afraid of this. Yes, he did want to ask out Ginny, but he did not want to stop seeing Draco. Somehow, the two didn’t seem mutually exclusive to him. He liked them in such different ways, and he knew Draco would be fine with it — the prat basically
Of course, Hermione didn’t know just how right she was. Harry was quickly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy.
“Romilda, of course, Romilda Vane,” Ron had purringly told him that morning in a disgustingly sweet voice almost unrecognizable as his own.
Pulling Draco up by the hair, he whispered. “Luckily for you, what I want, more than anything...is exactly this.” Draco sighed.
would obviously head towards where the Mark was, he ran up to the Astronomy Tower past the others. “Harry...”
As Harry stepped in the tunnel towards Hogwarts led by Neville, he couldn’t believe or process what was about to occur. He barely caught himself as he stumbled into the Room of Requirement —
“Well, I do hate you, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting to rip your clothes off,” Draco said with a wide grin entering his face. Pulling Harry towards him, Draco whispered, “C’mere.”
Anyone walking by may not have even noticed that there were two people standing there. At that moment, in fact, they were one.
He prayed Harry didn’t sense the fear in his voice. How could he be so stupid, to think it romantic to fuck in the same Room of Hidden Things setup as where his cabinet was? He never imagined Harry would come here at any other time…
around the house? — but it still brought him joy and sanity to imagine the look on Harry’s face when Draco kissed him, the eagerness with which Harry gave Draco head, how good it felt to finally embrace after spending an impossibly long couple of days apart.
Harry’s body was so familiar to Draco that the latter felt like he was reentering a maze he had gotten to know as a child.
Harry’s heart beat and thumped like never before. “Get out of my face,” Harry spat at him before going on his way.
“It’s here! I’ve got it!” Harry exclaimed triumphantly, facing the Diadem in front of him. He turned expectantly to find Ron and Hermione, only…
“I’ll take care of it,” he had said to Alecto just the other day. “Aunt Bella taught me some tricks,” he stammered convincingly, with a mischievously evil look on his face that was characteristically Malfoy.
On the other side of the Great Hall, Draco was bragging about cornering Harry to Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle.
This allowed Harry to give his dick a few good strokes to Draco’s memory before more thoughts creeped in.
Harry must’ve picked up on Draco’s crestfallen expression because he turned and kissed Draco with such force he nearly knocked Draco off his feet. “I’ll see you later, okay?” He stammered before running off.
“Some hexxes don’t leave visible marks,” Draco responded ominously. “Let’s just say he won’t ever be the same again.”
Making sure to bump into Harry on his way to the bathroom — “Ouch, watch it!” said Harry, but Draco knew it made him fire up — Draco continued on with his task. Filled with desire at the effect of his touch on Harry —
Draco’s face turned a shade of pink Harry had never seen before as he made his way back to where Harry was standing.
“I do understand,” Harry responded kindly, his chest swelling. “I understand what it’s like to have the world expected of you when you just want to live your life like a normal teenanger. To have everyone you’ve ever loved be in constant danger and feel like it’s your fault. To be so alone you can’t even confide in your closest friends. To have a task ahead that’s so great, so important that…”
Harry was positively dying from the weight of Draco on him, the feel of Draco’s hands in his hair, Draco’s hand on his dick, Draco’s dick in his —
Once or twice, he thought he caught Draco looking at him, but besides that, the rivals continued their mean banter as usual.
Draco got up swiftly to leave, but stopped himself briefly before exiting the compartment. He glanced at Harry and grinned, “Meet you in the Room of Requirement at 7 tomorrow. Don’t be late.”
“There’s your dick talking again,” Draco said with a wink. “Bet no one can pleasure you like I do. I can only imagine how hard it would be for you if I died. Or, how
Harry could barely breathe when he heard Snape telling Draco that the necklace had been a foolish mistake, that Snape could help Draco, that he had made the Unbreakable Vow...What did it all mean?
Draco’s face hardened back to the loathing look Harry was far more used to. “We’d better get going.” He stood up to leave.
Grateful that Harry didn’t mention it again, Draco ominously said, “Keep fucking me like you do, Harry, and I may surprise you. Crazy how much sex can do for one’s nerve.”
, no less — then felt stupid because obviously jerking off had nothing to do with how quickly he’d defeat Voldemort. Plus, they were safe, for now.
Harry grabbed his dick and thought of the warmth of Draco’s hand on it, how good it felt. He concentrated his eyes on the dot that said “Draco Malfoy” standing still in the classroom Harry had just left, probably looking smug at some thing or another.
“Let’s drop it,” Harry interrupted before the two started bickering again. “As for the wand, I think I can control my feelings. It’s the best I’ve had for a while,” Harry said determinedly as he grabbed his lover’s wand tightly.
“No problem, and same to you obviously,” Harry said. “I’m not, but I think I might be starting to have feelings for...Well, nevermind, it doesn’t matter.”
Eyes glistening like emeralds, Draco turned away with a big smile on his face. This time, as Draco walked away, Harry knew that he’d see his lover again.
“That day at the battle, I stayed behind after we...y’know...to help you fight...I couldn’t leave you. Crabbe and Goyle assumed I was trying to catch you, and they saw you go into the Room. I didn’t tell them…” Draco trailed off. Repeating this memory was so painful that he needed a moment.
“Your turn,” Harry grinned while diving below Draco’s legs. With his hands firmly pressing Draco down, he went in with his mouth.
“Ooooh,” the enemies-turned-lovers-turned-enemies-turned-lovers groaned together. Draco thought his dick was feeling freedom for the first time — there were always firsts, even during their 495th fucking — as he thrust wildly into Harry. “Guess I’m not all bottom after all,” Draco bragged. “Fuck, fuck fuck
Though Draco did not give a second thought to the possibility of having an actual relationship with Harry before, he could only cling onto the notion now.
“Harry you’re not eating properly,” she scolded him over dinner. “I noticed that it’s seven o’clock,
The Gryffindor looked at Draco in awe as though about to say something, then hurried away as though afraid Draco might change his mind.
“Different wonderful,” Harry replied, his face still full of lust. Draco’s groin churned again at the sight as his hand reached out to grab Harry’s.
“Thank you. Thank you Draco,” Harry sputtered as he kissed Draco with such fervor that Draco’s cheeks turned red. “You have no idea how helpful you’ve been. Now, get your git arse the fuck out of the castle with the rest of the Slytherins. I’ll join you soon.”
Draco twitched, only to again be stopped by Narcissa. This time, Lucius also gave him a determined glare.
“No, not now, stupid erection,” Harry uttered aloud, hoping that it would not be audible. He felt terribly guilty jerking off while the war was going on — to his
Nothing had gone according to Draco’s plan. After Harry had gone off with Dumbledore, Draco knew that he had just one shot at what he was about to do. But when Bellatrix, followed by Rodolphus, followed by dozen others stumbled out of the vanishing cabinet instead of his mother, he knew that all was doomed. His aunt had barely looked at him when she directed the Death Eaters towards the castle.
Catching on now, Harry continued, “So, you’ve learned to block out certain things, like sex and...well, that. But —“
All at once, he knew he had to go back; there was no way he would ignore another chance to spend time with Harry.
“Have some manners for once. I'm sure even you don't remember the last time you washed your hands.” Harry pouted.
Harry skimmed the last paragraph. He was impressed that, not only had the reporter written his statement down almost word for word, but he also ended with the idea that if Harry Potter could move on from the war and forgive his enemies, maybe it was time they all did.
“Don't try to change the subject.” Draco looked to his friend for support, but Blaise was just watching with a grin. Draco narrowed his eyes. He would remember this for sure.
A sudden crash and odd squeak near them caused both of them to freeze. “I, er. Sorry, mate. Leaving now.”
. Why hadn't he just listened to Malfoy and snuck off to one of their normal spots? They'd never once been caught or seen. Malfoy was never going to speak to him again, and certainly never sleep with him. Not to mention he would have to explain that he'd been snogging Malfoy (and perhaps a bit more than that) to his best friends. Harry looked closer at his plate and ignored the eyes that had turned to him. “Mate!” Ron yelled. “Were you going to tell me you were snogging one of our roommates? Or that you're snogging blokes at all?” Harry just shrugged without looking up.
Then again, without a picture they wouldn't have any story. In Hogwarts, Draco had heard a different girl each day claim that she had a date with Harry that weekend. He doubted it had changed much.
Malfoy had turned his attention to the bird, but looked back up at Harry. "Um. No. He's one of the school's." Harry nodded. "I was never allowed to have one." Harry narrowed his eyes.
“I wasn't going to. But he asked about something I wanted to talk about.” Hermione's expression fell as she started reading the front page.
harry. That was the only thing Malfoy had called him since the trial. It had such a nicer ring on that posh throat than
“Must be a secret admirer,” Weasley guessed. Harry had certainly received plenty of gifts from them.
The Golden Trio strolled into the Great Hall later than normal, even for a weekend. “I thought you weren't talking to the press anymore, Harry.” Harry shrugged as Ginny threw the paper in the middle of the three new arrivals as they took their seats.
Underneath the letter there were drawings of two creatures. One Teddy had clearly drawn, which was short with strange plates coming up from its spine. The other must have been drawn by Harry. It was much taller with a long neck and a rounded head. Draco studied them for a while, eventually wondering if these were dinosaurs. He'd completely forgotten to ask Harry about those.
think he's up to something?” Ron's voice tapered off like he was asking a question rather than making a statement. Harry took in the way they were talking to him delicately, gently. Like he was a child. Or deranged.
“We had a copy of it in Malfoy Manor. When I heard you were looking for it, I went home and grabbed it.”
When Malfoy offered Ron some of the sweets his mother had owled him, Ron didn't even consider that they could be poisoned or one of George's trick candies that tasted awful. The thought that he'd instinctively trusted
Just as he was considering leaving, the door was suddenly wrenched open to the Savior of the Wizarding World with a singing boy hanging on his shoulders. There was a beat where no one spoke.
“Let me see.” Harry leaned over and grabbed the parchment off the table. It was just the names of the roommates they'd written down that first day, plus a few scribbled notes about their whereabouts and a drawing of a troll. “Oh, well that's your problem – you've missed someone.”
“Yes, well.” Draco coughed. “I overheard you lot talking about it. Couldn't exactly be helped, seeing as you were practically yelling in the library.” Ginny did that obnoxious head nod that was somehow sarcastic.
He straightened in his seat. Most of those returning over the summer - Potter, Weasley, and Draco included – knew they would be too busy with school to focus on Quidditch. His mind ran over the students that were left.
Draco hurried back to his room and spent the rest of the day sick with worry about what Harry could have possibly said to the reporter. It could have been about anything. Maybe the reporter just wouldn't leave Harry alone about his personal life and Harry was telling him to fuck off. The reporter was making up something about Harry’s friends and he was defending them. He was arguing about something the reporter had said about Dumbledore.
The man sat down on the bench across from his and started pulling things out from his bag – a pad of parchment, a quill, a camera. Harry held in a groan, just barely. A reporter.
“That's hardly true!” Harry yelled, much louder than necessary. “You hardly had a choice, Draco. You were raised by Death Eaters who brainwashed you your entire life. Voldemort lived in your house.” Draco flinched at the name. “They threatened to kill you and the only family you had. No one can blame you for that. Which is exactly why you were cleared of any charges.”
“Very well, Weasley.” He hesitated a moment, then decided he needed to be more civil if he ever wanted to be accepted back into society. “And you?”
“Sorry. I don't know why I assumed you wouldn't be a good cook. I know we're adults now, but-” Harry scoffed.
Harry removed the cloak just outside of the common room, and Draco followed directly behind him. The common room fell to silence at the sudden appearance of the two, more than an hour after curfew.
Draco paced up and down his room as he thought through his options. He could run—but where? All his friends had parents who were Death Eaters or in league with Death Eaters, and it was much too dangerous for his parents to escape. He couldn’t leave them. He could attempt to contact Harry, but what method did he have that wouldn’t attract attention? His owl would be far too conspicuous turning up at Privet Drive. He no longer had a house elf. He could not risk using his family’s floo network.
“Oh you’ll get it alright,” Harry smiled, drawing Draco in for a long kiss. Not daring to bring up his plan again, he hoped the kiss would reaffirm how much trust Harry put into Draco to make the right choice.
“Er, Potter,” Draco continued awkwardly. “Could I have a word...in private?” His heartbeat quickened.
“He caught me eavesdropping on his conversation with the Slytherins. Saw my foot slip from the cloak.” He gave them a knowing look.
“I believe you, Draco,” Harry replied, his body shaking, hoping he wasn’t being an idiot. “But that still doesn’t explain…”
“Professor Dumbledore wants you in his office now,” the Gryffindor continued. “It seemed...it seemed urgent.” With a last terrified look at Draco, he left.
“Shhh,” Draco teased as he sucked and stroked Harry with such force that he nearly came himself. “This’ll only take a moment, then I’ll help you with whatever you want.”
Just as Draco was going to lead the others to the Headmaster’s office, where Harry definitely was not, he saw three familiar bodies spring around the corner. With a terrified gulp, he realized that Crabbe and Goyle had seen them too.
“Why on Earth should that be a problem then? Ron laughed. Harry and Hermione stared at him as comprehension began to dawn.
Draco gulped. “I was just wondering, you know, whether you’ve told people about me....about us.” He gulped again.
Romilda could’ve done to make me never want to go for her, Harry thought, it was this. As much as Draco had his faults, he would
Draco hesitated. Looking at the blazened expression on his oldest rival’s face, he felt a flutter below. He was suddenly filled with a deep desire to grab Harry. Did he dare?
, no less. I suppose you’ve forgotten all about Ginny then, have you?” Ron looked a mixture between amused and murderous. On second thought, Harry thought it was definitely closer to murderous.
Earlier that month, Harry and Ginny had had a series of heart-to-hearts after a particular rough patch in their sex life. Harry loved Ginny, but still found his mind often wandering to different scenes, different people, different times...
Harry was there when Katie Bell got cursed. He saw her fly into the air, her arms wide, her face looking as though it’d never see light again.
“Er, sorry about that,” Harry said to Draco, taking his hand again. “You don’t have to act like you hate me
’Course I am, you dickhead,” Draco scowled. “You think I saved your life just so I could suck your dick? Cocky as always, Potter.” His tone was so reminiscent of their childhood that Harry couldn’t help but smile. “Though that, of course, is an added benefit,” Draco’s face softened as he leaned in for a kiss.
“Did you run here, Harry?” Dumbledore had said during a lesson last Thursday, after a particularly steamy love-making session with Draco. “You needn’t have. A few minutes’ tardiness would be fine,” he added, his eyes twinkling with understanding.
“Er...yeah, Hermione, sorry. I was just daydreaming about...er…my last date with Cho. Reckon I really messed that one up,” Harry tried with all his might to force a look of remorse onto his face. “I’ll talk to Slughorn tomorrow.”
Draco Malfoy had just received some bad news. It hurt him to pieces to think about the letter his mother had sent him the day before.
Draco knew it would be too risky to openly join the resistance with the others—with Harry’s friends. Instead, he took a position assisting the Carrows in torturing students, then thwarted the siblings at every chance he got.
?” Hermione whispered in Harry’s ear after their families joined together. The kids were busy catching up with their cousins while Ginny and Ron were deep in conversations. Harry didn’t know whether he imagined it, but he thought their faces screwed into intentionally absent-minded expressions.
at his slightest touch. “Turn around,” Draco demanded, though his hands were already on the job. Harry panted and fell on all fours, his eyes closed, ready to be fucked.
Chaos ensued. Jinxes flew left and right, bouncing up and down and off the Room’s many treasures. Hermione screamed, Ron was nearly hit by Goyle’s killing curse, Harry himself swerved many times to avoid the attacks, and...and then there was fire.
Harry was losing his understanding now. “Oh, to have Voldemort murder your whole family and try to kill you too? Couldn’t imagine what that must be like. Life’s really hard sometimes isn’t it?” He remarked sarcastically.
Draco was at the top of the Astronomy Tower, gazing at Dumbledore with an indiscernible expression in his eyes. Harry’s insides reacted instinctively to seeing Draco. He wanted to move, to shout, to pin Draco against the wall, to jump between Draco and Dumbledore. He yearned to find out, to explain, to do
Harry looked at his lover with a piercing stare. His hair was so perfectly messy, Harry longed to grab it.
The amount of grief Harry felt by the death of his greatest mentor, the anger he held against the man he trusted, the terror at what lay ahead...he could hardly breathe. As was common when Harry became overwhelmed by helpless sadness, he instead tried to turn his mind to happier times...times with Draco, in the Room of Requirement, their bodies pressed together…
Ignoring the question, Harry began speculating as to what it was Dumbledore wanted him to get out of Slughorn. Only by changing the subject to Dumbledore could Harry successfully distract the other two. Sure enough, they fell for it, and the trio ended up discussing Dumbledore’s potential plots and plans until dawn.
Draco smirked. “Different good?” He has to admit, he had not planned on putting so much aggression into his thrusts. It kind of just...happened.
“Malfoy, er...” Harry continued, reveling in the taste of his lover’s name on his tongue and trying his hardest to quash his erection. He had just had the most orgasm in his life ramming Draco against the outside of the vanishing cabinet with his hands tied up in some rope they had found lying around. Concentrating with all his might on Ron’s Aunt Muriel, Harry forced himself to continue. “Malfoy’s been given a mission by Voldemort, sir, I’m sure of it. And it involves you.”
“I’m not satisfied with that answer one bit,” Harry answered. But with one look at Draco, he gave in. “Oh go on then, a quick one,” he grinned and unbuckled his belt again.
There is no question that Draco Malfoy had never hated anyone like he hated Harry Potter. Equally true was that he’d never tasted anything better. As he got to know Harry through snippets of conversations he sometimes allowed himself to have, he grappled with his increasingly confused feelings. Harry brought out the deepest of his insecurities and jealousies, but at the same time making him want to be valiant and bold — and believing that he could.
“Fucking hell,” Harry could only say before he was pushing Draco against the wall behind him — the same wall on which Snape had just threatened him — not even caring that they were in clear view, that anyone could walk by and see them. All Harry knew was that he wanted — he
“Didn’t Mummy ever tell you that it’s rude to eavesdrop?” Draco snapped, pointing his wand at Harry, fearing that Harry would sense the uncertainty in his face.
knew that. Still, he had to put up some front, didn’t he? His friends were quiet as they tried to figure out what to say.
“My- what in the hell are you talking about?” Hermione did what she could to turn and glare at Seamus, but it wasn't very effective with the loaf on top of her. Seamus rolled his eyes.
Harry didn't even look up when someone came in the room. He continued his very important task of staring at the ceiling above him. Were there a hundred other things he could be doing? Yes. Could he convince himself to move to do any of them? No.
For a few moments after knocking, there was no answer. If someone else was babysitting, they might have taken Teddy to their house. He decided to wait another minute before leaving.
“You’re driving me mad.” Harry held back a snort. He was one to talk about driving people mad. “I just- one second I think everything is fine, maybe we're not even enemies anymore. Then you're staring at me from across the room and following me.” Harry flushed slightly. “You're obviously watching me, waiting for me to do wrong, but then when someone asks about just that, you seem... angry at them for even
All the color drained from Draco's face at once. He wouldn't be... no. He'd told Draco. Harry had assured him he wouldn't talk to anyone. Harry had defended him in his trials. Harry was a Golden Boy who had refused to lie even when it resulted in him being
“Something I'm sure you'll take advantage of.” Harry laughed as they both started getting ready for bed.
“I meant the other gift.” There was a brief silence. Draco looked over his book to find that they were the only two awake in the room – Weasley, Thomas, and Longbottom had gone to the bathrooms to get ready for bed, Justin and Blaise hadn't come to bed yet, and Ernie was softly snoring.
“Name someone that fights as much as you two.” He was already starting to get very tired of the Weaselette's sudden challenges. He tried to think quickly.
But Ron knew it was more than that. If that was the case, Malfoy would have stopped as soon as he and Hermione agreed to a truce and forgave him. They were polite to him now, and never insulted him, and Malfoy still hadn't stopped going out of his way to be kind to them. He was obviously up to something.
At just the sight of Harry watching him with an affectionate smile, Draco's heart began it's jumps and flips again. Whenever they decided they'd had their fun teasing their classmates and they eventually went public, Draco knew his heart was in for more than it could probably handle.
Ron shook his head and turned back to his sister. No doubt Harry was just thanking him for the broom.
for Hermione yet. He'd already gotten her a few things, of course. There were her favorite sweets from Honeydukes, a small stuffed cat that vaguely looked like Crookshanks, and a quill similar to a Quick Notes Quill. This one wrote anything spoken word for word, perfect for Hermione's thoughtful ramblings or taking notes. He knew she would love all of them, and would certainly be happy if that was all she got.
“For Merlin's sake,” he grumbled at the cheesy words in icing. “Thank you for saving us all!' I thought you were supposed to be smart, Granger.” Her face hardened. He glanced at the second cake and found it said simply, 'Happy Birthday, Neville!' He ignored them to charm Potter's cake to say, 'Happy Birthday, Harry!' instead.
Harry watched him tuck another perfect test into his bag with a small smile. The lecture went on, and Harry couldn't have said what it was about.
“Don't flatter him.” Ron opened his mouth to defend his friend, but Harry was laughing, too. Ron slowly closed his mouth. “Besides, he's not going to go pro.” Ginny continued staring at him.
He wouldn't talk to him, for the most part, and usually didn't even really look at him. But he would sit with him in the library a few times a week and silently study. If they happened to be going to the same review session or heading back to the Common Room at the same time, Potter would fall into step beside him without a single word of greeting. There had even been a few times when Draco was reading or working in the Common Room, and Potter – for no apparent reason – felt the need to sit next to Draco and work on whatever he was occupied with.
"No, I haven't," he grumbled. Hermione hesitated before turning back to her parchment. It was bullshit, and he knew that, and he knew
“You picked fights,” Hermione pointed out. “Insulted me. Couldn't just ask me to the Yule Ball, compliment me, admit you liked me just a little bit. The only reason you did was because you thought we might
Worry that Ron – Hermione wasn't really the concern, he knew that – wouldn't be a good enough friend to accept that Malfoy was, apparently, what made Harry happy.
“So. Anyway. I was wondering. If you or your mother want it, I'd be happy to give it to you.” The entire time Harry was talking, it hadn't even really occurred to him that his mother was a Black. That he was a Black. He had stared at Harry in surprise until Harry flushed and started mumbling about him not having to take it.
“I just... I don't see why you of all people would be interested in me when there are so many better choices. Better for you. People who actually helped you, who were always on your side. You know – good people.” Harry gripped Draco's chin gently and turned him so their faces were even, only a few inches apart.
. He mentally berated himself for interrupting the genuine moment, probably the first one he'd ever had with Malfoy, with his incessant fantasies. “You're the reason we're not in Azkaban.” Harry's inappropriate thoughts faded.
Harry breathed out heavily, barely having breathed during his whole rant. “Is that enough? Do you get why I like you now? I can keep going if you need.”
“I'm not going to tell you. They're not going to tell you either. And you're not going to figure it out. Just leave it alone.”
“So, Harry.” Ginny brought the attention back to him. “Now that you've finally stopped being an idiot, what are you going to do?” Harry shrugged once again.
Harry hated it for a lot of reasons – despite trying to redecorate a little, the entire thing was old-fashioned and stuffy. The portrait of Mrs. Black chastised him and outright bellowed at Granger and some of his other friends. Kreacher made him feel uncomfortable with his overbearing nature and odd behavior, and Draco had a strong suspicion there was some larger, underlying reason Harry didn't like the House Elf. Both Andromeda and Sirius were burned off the family tapestry, and there were other indicators of them being considered traitors.
“You know, you’re right. How are you so smart?” Harry asked, shaking his head at the kid at his side. Teddy grinned proudly. He turned back to Draco. “Anyway,
Almost twenty minutes later, Harry walked back into the common room with his three Gryffindor friends in tow. They were all laughing as they entered and continued toward the exit into the castle. Harry stilled when he met Draco's eye, awkwardly biting his lip and nodding at Draco with what he knew to be thanks. Draco nodded back and rolled his eyes as he turned back to his homework once again.
