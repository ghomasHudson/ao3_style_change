Disbelief was an emotion Harry could deal with. Pity was not.
"Was I worth it?" Draco was close to tears again and covered for it magnificently. They'd spill soon—he couldn't control anything, absolutely not himself. "Tell me I was worth it. That I made it good for you. Tell me you'd do it all over just to get between my legs again," he whispered, soft as could be, stepping ever closer to Harry.
"You know what," he said as he pulled the gate open to the sidewalk where three photographers were crowded, only one of them recognizable to him, "I bet I could keep this
for chai in Hogsmeade." He glanced at Harry; the weird smile was back. "We sat in the windows of Puddifoots."
Draco shook his head, his lips a thin, pinched line. "I'm not hungry anymore."
Harry picked a hangnail. He was biting them again, down to the quick.
"I threw it out the window," Draco spat. He raised a finger to point at the window over the sink. "That window, to be exact. Straight through."
"What the fuck is in that, Luna," Harry croaked, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
"Don't be," Draco's thumb scratched at the stubble pushing in along his jaw. "I didn't let you."
"I came to let you know that your agent, the Cresswell woman? She had nothing to do with any of this."
"What was that?" Draco's wand was in his hand immediately, a beam of light directed towards the armoire.
"You really thought you could get away with eye-fucking me like that all night?" Draco growled the words directly into Harry's ear, and Harry could hardly breathe; he was so turned on, and at the same time terrified that somehow Draco would pull away and laugh, that the whole scenario would be revealed as an elaborate joke.
“Like pins and needles, all over.”
"Birthdays, plural, and two weddings. That's my offer."
"Almost there."
, that she'd worn since her teens. He inhaled deeply and let it go. Ginny had never been the one for him, but being around her helped, sometimes.
"This would all make much more sense if it was a conversation with my parents." Malfoy's voice dropped deadly low. His mask was slipping. "I feel like I'm having déjà-vu."
"Here?" Oliver asked him, gesturing to his mattress on the floor, and Harry had said "Sure," and let himself be kissed until he realized that Oliver wanted him to do the kissing, to take the lead, so he did. Oliver pulled the string on the single lamp in the room to turn it off, and with only the scraggly light from the nearly-full moon coming in through the window, he was passable. Close enough, even though his hair was dyed, more yellow than white, and he was softer, thin but without all the muscles Harry had become accustomed to.
Draco continued breezily, not overhearing Harry's thoughts by choice or chance.
Harry exhaled. Nothing so bad after all. He did have a penchant for drunkenly spilling secrets, but as far as secrets went, that one wasn't bad at all.
He could hardly believe that they were having such a prolonged discussion about the one person he could never broach in conversation with his friends.
"Oh, don’t do that," Harry said. Draco smiled thinly and pushed the heels of his palms into closed eyes.
Draco kept his eyes closed and his mouth a tight ring around Harry's cock. He stayed at the top, tongue rimming the underside of the crown, left hand tugged smoothly at Harry's shaft as the fingers inside him found the button and pressed, insistent, and with utmost proficiency he had Harry coming warm spurts on his tongue, mewling Draco's name all the while.
"How did you know it was me?"
Draco gave a knowing look to Harry as he passed by the doorway to the living room, one shared in confidence because Hermione and Ron's backs were to him and therefore they weren't treated to the raised brows and smirking lips. Harry was, and knew from the
"I don't tolerate you," Harry blurted. Draco raised an eyebrow at him, and he struggled to find the right words. "I—er. I think I like you, even if you are a git."
"Oh!" The blond man's sudden yell cut Harry's rant short. He turned as though revealing Harry to an audience. Other than the rats scurrying around the bins, they were alone.
"Listen, just because you see a couple of men talking on the street doesn't make them fags," Draco said. "Even if they are, that gives you no right to assault them with your bodily fluids. Do you hear me?"
"No!"
"This Friday?" Draco closed the book, leaned forwards to drop it on the countertop and turned, his right hand on the island of Harry's right knee as leverage to twist his torso, so they spoke face to face. The low glow of candlelight was all that lit the space, turning the wisps of hair coming in at his temples and nape into filaments of gold. Harry's heart beat double to see him like this, shadows and light and flushed, pink across his nose and high cheekbones, and his cock started to fill out, would be noticeably stiff when Draco settled back between his legs.
Harry watched this interaction as the flame of embarrassment burned a hole through him. He had ordered at the front counter like an imbecile, he now realized. He'd ordered hot coffee too—twice—even though the temperature was set to sizzle eggs on tarmac today. Perhaps, he mused, he subconsciously wanted to spend time with Malfoy to learn how it was that he moved through the world so casually. To pick up on that suaveness forever missing from Harry's life, like a lesson he'd missed.
Draco," he pressed his forehead into the mattress, body curled up like an angered cat. "I'm trying, alright?"
, even if he couldn't talk about it yet.
Harry rolled his eyes as aggressively as he could at Ron, who answered by taking a swig of beer, eyebrows wagging in that suggestive way of his.
"You," Malfoy rasped out the word. He turned away and let out a shuddering breath, one arm wrapped tightly across his waist and the other hiding his face. Harry swallowed, not sure what to say.
"The dragon tamer," Draco said with a questioning look, and Harry nodded, surprised that he remembered.
Draco's voice whispered in his mind and Harry pushed back,
It was true that Harry's cock was doing the stretching. Each new push drew a hiss, and then the pleasure would come as that new depth opened up to Harry. Harry pushed up to his knees, the better to be able to look down at Draco and watch the rosy flush rise from his throat to his cheeks, catch the moment he arched his neck and closed his eyes, his breath hitching.
"You're so wonderfully beautiful all the time, Harry, but I especially love you undone. I want you to come for me," Draco's mouth brushed Harry's as he twisted his grip of Harry’s cock, the rhythmic sound of water falling at their feet now caused by the slide of his hand over Harry's shaft, thick and ruddy against the white of his skin.
So, he took a deep breath and told them, starting with Gollybean and moving forward in time through all the main points—his nosiness into Draco's past, the hearing, and the Muggle degree. He hid the soft parts, kept them like smuggled jewels, close to his chest—coffee at the café, their chance meeting over ziti, late-night conversations that were more like lessons in political life and current events, now that Harry looked back on them. That it had been going on for months and started as a tenuous friendship took them both aback; that it had taken months to become clearly serious, something that had to be addressed to be able to continue, they begrudgingly accepted.
" He exhaled, the silence surrounding them interrupted only by the crackling of the fire. "Counting is for nerds, anyway. Now, it's my turn, isn't it?"
He knew he looked good, technically; knew that the thickened swells of his biceps drove Draco wild and that the sinewy muscle of his torso, the tense spread of his shoulders and thighs, and his calves carved from hours upon hours spent sprinting over London's uneven pavement and cobblestones, he knew that they turned Draco on. That Harry had never felt handsome or particularly fit didn't matter, not to Draco, and especially not right now. That he avoided mirrors as a rule, still didn't like to touch at his own waxy scars, couldn't bring himself to order and use the creams that would lessen their tightness because that would mean acknowledging that he wished for them to go away—those were troubles for another day.
Draco peeled Harry's fingers back, held on as he lowered them to his lap.
Draco looked over to the far wall. "It ended up outside in the rain. I believe it passed away."
Upon his arrival, he stood still as he waited for the wash of nausea to simmer down.
"Excuse me,
Draco tipped his head, nodding in agreement. "Generally, you'd be correct. The school is well respected, and it costs accordingly. But the class I teach is by donation." He turned to the head of the table. "Mr Weasley, you'll have to forgive me—that's why it's taken so long for me to get a Sunday night off. My slot isn't exactly lucrative, so I had to wait for a very kind soul to volunteer to cover for me." He narrowed his eyes at Harry, "I wouldn't want anyone to think I was trying to avoid joining you all for dinner."
They'd gotten ice creams, and then there was yelling, and Draco had sheltered in the loo to keep away from it. He'd been trying very purposefully to integrate sweets into his routines, but then someone had gone and fucked it up for him at the absolute worst moment.
"I work, Harry." Draco's voice interrupted the spiralling thoughts. "I’m up at five, I run, I work twelve, fourteen-hour days," Draco spoke evenly, returning to an even keel. "Every weekday but Thursday, I’m doing research in the lab well into the evening, and Saturdays are for my thesis. I have to work to live, I can’t—there’s close to nothing left in the bank. Enough to get by, but I’ll graduate in debt, and that’s fine, it is, really, but I need this job. When I’m not in the apothecary, I’m in the library, and if I'm not there, I'm in the lab, and on my off days, I have classes at the studio—"
"Yeah, sure, whatever, I get it. Just the messenger, and all," he spat uncharitably. "He had the Ministry of Transport do it, right?"
"I just—" Harry looked away from him, contemplating the hour on display on the quartz clock on the wall. "I'm so confused."
"Brilliant, Marcus, well. This goes for you too, Bones—let me start by offering my deepest apologies for my past behaviour." Draco paused, and his demeanour switched from affable to contrite so quickly that it seemed impossible that it was sincere, but if Draco was faking it, Harry couldn’t tell.
, you’ll discover. I rather liked that."
"Alright, yeah. They knew about Draco. Well, know about him—it's not like he's dead. The whole Justin going above and beyond to try to blackmail you into dating him—he's on his own on that one. I suppose there could be some angle between his dad and Robards, but as far as we know he found out when he, er, caught you two in the loo." That Ron managed to say all this without blushing was a sign of maturity, or possibly his sickness had robbed him of his characteristic ability to flush like a red light. "A loo. He wouldn't specify which one, specifically."
"Fuck," Cissy whispered, "god that's good, you feel—
"Where did you go when you moved out?"
As though they were tallying up the orgasms they’d had and given one another on some cosmic scoreboard—tit for tat.
The word
"Harry, come off it. You know we love you. It was beyond confusing to get the papers on Friday and not a spec of your big news, and then your note was so cryptic—"
"You're not my type," Harry said automatically, choosing to ignore talk of ecstasy for the moment.
"You do know you're famous, right?" Malfoy's exasperation seemed to swell with each passing moment. "Everyone knows your birthday. Christ, what anyone wants with you is beyond me."
He responded by arching his back and raising his hips. "Fuck me," he said again, forcing Draco to meet his eyes in the mirror. Draco arched a brow and smirked at the gasp that escaped Harry's mouth when he surreptitiously curled his fingers to press into that spot inside him, bringing a fresh sweat to his entire body.
Ron pushed his hair back, pulling the skin on his face taut. He was worried, Harry realized, really, truly worried that this would be a break between them.
Harry's jaw unstuck, his tongue peeling from the roof of his mouth. Making words felt like heavy work.
His eyes slammed open at the words. He'd meant to think them, not say them aloud.
Draco hummed.
They tried and failed to hide their starstruck looks at Harry, which he found hilarious and Draco found absolutely mortifying. Luckily, it was their life in Muggle academia that was a topic of endless fascination for Hermione, who quickly pulled them into a quiet corner of the parlour and plied them with questions, nodding at anyone passing by and smiling, throwing up three fingers and a smile as her way of ordering the trio of them more drinks, refusing to give up her position on the sofa.
"It's alright," Charlie said, an eyebrow raised and his lips mashed to the side, the international Weasley sign for
The funny thing happened to Malfoy's face again. For all his training, Harry couldn't read him.
Harry raked a hand through his hair, finding odd knots in some of the wilder curls.
Malfoy stomped his heels, and the thudding echoed the long way down the deserted corridor. Harry watched, impressed that he did it hard enough that the laces loosened and when he kicked again the left brogue flew up and off and right over the balcony.
"Oh. Well, that's—"
“You’re not fine. You’re never fine. You’re easily my most unstable patient, and you don’t have to collapse a lung to see me.”
“Of course you’ve got a fat cock,” he said, sounding somehow bored and angry and interested at the same time. “Look at you. I’ve been neglecting you.”
Hilarious, to consider it. Him possessing Draco. And yet, what other face did jealousy most often wear?
It was a struggle to open his eyes, and as Harry did, they felt as though they'd been coated in sand in his sleep. He blinked them shut again.
Harry contemplated the silver snitch in his hand, wiping his face with last years Christmas pullover. He'd forgotten how therapeutic it was to fly—how very quiet his thoughts got when the wind was whistling in his ears, and he was up high, looking down upon all the little players. And if he’d learned anything over the past few weeks, it was that there was a whole world beyond the walls of Grimmauld place, full of responsibilities and pleasures, and they didn’t all begin and end with Draco Malfoy. And even though it made his chest tight to think about it this way, he had to admit that he’d be better off with a roster of activities that kept him busy and brought him joy, whether or not Draco returned to his former position of importance in Harry’s life.
"Thanks," he said. He didn't offer a reason for his wandering. As he passed the glass back to Justin, their fingers brushed. Harry wanted to scream at the obviousness of it. Justin refilled it and held on to the glass a second too long, staring in its depths as though he wanted to say more before he passed it back.
Harry pulsed his hips, Draco taking it well. He held on to one of Harry's thighs, the other hand braced against the wall as he took it. He took every inch Harry gave him gladly, humming his happiness around his prick.
" she started, and Harry curled his fingers up against the ball of nerves seated inside of her, pressed and held them there, taking delight in the look of pain that was really pleasure contorting her face.
There was a long silence that Harry wasn't sure how to fill.
"Two," he whispered as his teeth nipped the skin there, and Harry hissed, every ounce of self-control in his body holding him still and taut.
he didn't need to be told to know how good he was.
"Is everything alright?" Draco asked.
“Oops,” he whispered.
"Sometimes, yes. Full recovery can mean getting back to exactly the same thresholds, and normals. But for some, full recovery is getting functionality up to a new threshold. " He pointed at the line through the second hill. "What I'm getting at is that we've seen a plateau in your progress. It has nothing to do with your effort, and everything to do with your body trying to protect its most important asset from getting overworked."
"You do remember all the things he's said. To Mione, to me, to you? C'mon, you can't forget all that overnight?"
"You're acting like it's alright. Like I've been acting like everything's fine when this has been eating away at me." He winced. "Sorry, not—fuck, that wasn't—"
"Okay, yes, I was drugged, and no, I didn't go to hospital; don't get me started on how it would have been leaked. We're pretty sure that it was a Muggle drug, ecstasy, but I'm honestly fine, that's not even the weirdest bit—"
without saying anything at all.
Draco’s exhalation behind his ear brought a shiver to his skin, and his own cock pulsed as Draco readjusted his grip, thumb pressuring his jaw up, up—
"Be a good pet and suck it all up, now, won’t you," Draco ground out as Harry did. As if he'd do anything but—he'd been dreaming of sucking Draco like this all weekend.
" Draco shook his head, folding the paper and passing it to Harry. It was the first they'd made the paper in weeks, and it felt like a sign, somehow, happening the morning he left to a visit a magical prep-school for Muggleborn children in Hamburg.
section, laughed through the inane articles of
Hermione snorted, eyes brimming with unspent tears brought on by her laughter. Harry, uncharitably, hoped she choked on her drink. If only a little.
“In hooking up with you?”
"He's always welcome here," Molly started. She looked to her husband with watery eyes. "Of course we would take him."
"Bollocks," he cursed, closing his eyes and thinking of home with a spin of his heel, Apparition points be damned.
Harry didn't have a good answer for his behaviour during those early months and stood, needing a break. He took the opportunity to walk over to the bathroom, flicking on the light on a quick search for something useful. The face he saw reflected in the glass surprised him—black hair tumbling low on his brow and about his ears, his eyes gleaming a startling green in the midst of his pallid face, red-rimmed even if they hadn't yet spilt any tears. He looked destroyed. A day and a night of rest wouldn't be enough before the colour would seep back into his cheeks or lips.
Harry unfurled and stood, trying a quick "
“Harry,” Draco sounded sad now, so Harry crawled over and held him, like a koala gripping a tree.
"What’s with the watch?" He almost managed the question without gasping. Draco shrugged, dragged the hand, rolling Harry’s foreskin up and down. Playing.
"I used to come here before uni and get absolutely thrashed. I'd set up shop in the toilets and make friends by giving away lines that would pay most people's rent." He snorted at the memory. "It was silly but fun, though, even under all the drugs."
“S’okay though, don’t worry bout anything,” he added, patting Draco’s shoulder. He was nice and warm and so inviting to be slept on. “You need it, I’ll get it for you. Always. Easy.”
"Hold still just like that, and let me do the work," he asked, and Cissy acquiesced. When Harry held her by the ribs and pounded his hips upwards, the broken sound she yelped made his cock throb. He lived for the feeling of being all inside of her, hot and wet and so unbelievably tight. He did it again, equally hard and Cissy cried out once more but tried to hide the sound in her throat.
"Hand me another one," Harry said, "and tell me about your trip to the Tate yesterday. Andromeda said Teddy was raving about it. What was your favourite painting, again?"
"Don't do that," Harry said, circling his hips with Cissy at the bottom, sac resting against Harry’s skin. Her cock remained tucked away, semi-hard in her underwear, though she made no intimation of wanting to be touched there again. This moment was about Harry’s control for a moment, about the pleasure they could share that came just from this—bottoming with abandon.
to "distract him of Wrackspurts". Albeit skeptical, the first line of the book had him immediately reading the first book of the series in less than twenty-four hours. Harry had never stopped thanking Luna for introducing him to such great a masterpiece.
Harry hadn't had a wink of sleep the night before, and he was cranky and frazzled. He was buggered by his and Draco's altercation in the seventh floor corridor last night, tossing and turning and not managing to find a position to settle his fraying nerves. Countless of times his roommates had thrown him a pillow on his face as his grunts and exhales had resonated through the Gryffindor dorm room. He almost had a maddening urge to rip the Marauders' map when he was gripped with the intense longing to see Draco's dot, the same thing that had brought him into this predicament.
"Yeah. I'm not," he laughed mildly, eyes moving down to look at Draco's lips. "Can I... kiss you?"
, Harry thought bitterly as he listened to Snape declaring the first pair: Zabini and Ron. Ron, unsurprisingly, gasped in disbelief. When he continued to grumble in protest, Snape took 10 points off Gryffindor and that had Hermione pinching Ron on the side. Ron moaned in despair, getting up and practically dragging his body to Zabini's area. The dark-skinned boy stared at the red head, quite uninterested, but the curl of his lips pronounced disgust.
In his periphery, Pansy peered at him with shrewd eyes. It was one of the reasons why Pansy is better at social navigating than him. Draco might be a master at concealing his emotions more than she ever was, but Pansy makes up for it with her ability to people-read that makes it easier for her to sway or manipulate someone to her bidding.
when you were also guiltily indulging yourself, you hypocrite," Hermione gently admonished, but shook her head at Harry in astonishment.
After he got dressed, Harry put the stopwatch inside his pockets.
Harry realized, with a dawning horror, that he doesn't want Ron and Hermione to see him in this state, no matter how much he trusted them. Ironically, Draco Malfoy, his rival which he shared a seven-year history of animosity with, was on his bed, just beseeched him out of his emotional melt down. Harry stared unseeingly at Draco Malfoy talking gently to him, his words went unheard to Harry.
The churning in his stomach went wild at the angered look in Malfoy's face. Harry stared at Malfoy's acerbic grey eyes somberly. "Stop it. Just stop this."
"Why did you stopped her?" Harry said, sniffing.
The staring contest between Malfoy and him was cut off when a face with a long red hair came into his view. He almost jump away at the nearness of Ginny Weasley's face.
"And you don't know how to open it?" Harry snapped, totally peeved by now. Malfoy raised his shoulders for a shrug. Harry sighed long-sufferingly and motioned for the idiot blond to get inside.
Ginny held Harry's hand comfortingly, "and that's okay. The war's over, you don't have to be the hero anymore! If anyone deserves to be happy, it is you, Harry," She smiled wryly. "I'm really sorry if I might've come off strongly and pressured you to continue where we left off."
"Are you done being sappy with your
. Draco’s mind whirled on the information. He didn’t come here to sit through Pansy’s farfetched and outlandish theories (and at Granger’s influence... he should’ve known not to let these two scatty women team up). He wanted some alone time, away from Harry and his unusual vulnerability that tugged at his heartstrings. He felt the enfeebling lethargy that swept over him after Harry’s breakdown, as if he were feeling the other’s emotions. And he hated the fact that his brain has a moment of sudden realization, as if all the pieces from last week clanked together.
normal. Not in Harry and Malfoy's dictionary anyway.
He pulled Draco closer, hoping that Draco felt safe with him just like how Draco made him felt the safest in a long time.
There was brief silence that descended upon them. At the far distance, he could hear the distinct quack of ducklings by the river and the echoes of laughter from the fifth year students at the edge of the forest. Harry was confused what to feel about that. Before he came to Hogwarts, he was given a biased concept of what a Slytherin constituted:
And why did he find Malfoy's naked feet so fucking alluring, of all things?
"Awful situation?" Draco rudely interrupted, putting his arm around Harry's shoulder and pulling him closer. "I have you know that me and Harry were going along so fine before your unwelcome presence so abruptly intrude into our space. Now if you would just, I don't know, bugger off to hell, Weasel, it would be a pleasure."
i am really happy to read your comments. i didn't know someone would rlly read this but??? y'all enjoying this? it makes me so much happy. thank you for all those who also left kudos. I LOVE U ALL!
"Good night, Draco."
It was Draco who moved away first. He looked intoxicated, eyes half-lidded and luscious lips slightly gaping in astonishment. A rush of heady pleasure buzzed through Harry's body and he dipped his head to capture those beautiful lips once more, but his lips met Draco's finger instead.
"My mother..." Draco paused, hesitating, then continued. "She held me. Like this. Sang to me when I was a kid. Held me during the stormy nights, and felt her kiss on my forehead when she thought I was sleeping. It stopped when I was seven and told her I was big enough not to be treated like a baby. I wish I hadn't. I... missed those."
. But Malfoy merely stared at him impassively.
Harry supposed both Hermione and Zabini were somehow right and wrong. He had personally felt constantly waging war with himself under the Augmentare, conflicted with the need to rage or just yield. Though the Sedatus had a relaxing effect, there was an incessant tug to do things for Malfoy to calm down. But instead of feeling like it was unnatural and forced, they felt like they were his own.
"Before we were so rudely interrupted," Snape pointedly said, glaring at Harry. "I was asking you if you all had started on your projects," the students nodded their head, "then I will have to check on your accounts and see what progress you made on your first week. Hand me your parchments."
The three of them treaded the manicured path that turns sharply to the side of the manor. Harry exhaled in relief. He doesn't think he would ever feel safe traversing the corridors that were filled with dark shadows and evil memories. They passed overgrown thicket of narcissus and baby's-breath and trimmed bushes, until they reached the small graveyard that probably housed generations of dead Malfoys. Statues of mythical creatures, angels, and gargoyles were erected here and there, wrapped in mosses and tendrils. The cold and mist gave the place a somewhat haunted ambiance, Harry shivered. He had no beautiful recollections of graveyards after all.
Potter who saved him from the Fiendfyre, which was supposed to be Draco's death. Potter who was the reason for his and his mother's acquittal.
Everything about Malfoy is dull and empty and it annoyed Harry.
Before Harry could so much as open his mouth, a certain blond came in through the large doors of the Great Hall. Harry stopped what he was doing, spoon and fork clanking loudly against his plate, to stare up at Draco Malfoy. He had his vacant, doll-like persona on, sitting in the Slytherin table primly, talking with his Slytherin chummies.
if u find grammatical errors, i might have to remind u that this is not beta-ed and English isnt my native language (im not even british lmao) so there is an obvious lack of britpicking, i apologize.
Instead, Draco felt powerless and wanted to yield to Potter more than the urge for reprisal.
The first thing that welcomed Harry when he stepped inside the Great Hall was the fluttering of the owls as they delivered the missives, packages and the Daily Prophet to the awaiting students.
thank u so much for the comments and kudos!!!! xx
Everywhere he went, he could see the back of Draco's blond hair, glowing in the sunlight that streamed through the window in which he sat by, looking up to listen to Professor Flitwick demonstrating the quite complex wand work of one of the variations of Atmospheric Charms and alternately ducking down to jot some notes down. Or Harry could see him dueling with Zabini during DADA, his wand stretched out in front of him in its defensive posture, his position regal and stiff yet he moved with swiftness and grace that only Draco could pull off as Zabini cast an array of offensive spells at him. Or Harry could see him sitting across the Great Hall in lunch, talking to his Slytherin friends, his face impassive even as his friends were laughing all around him.
There was a warmth that encased his hand and he didn't realised he had closed his eyes as they trudged up the lane towards the manor. He looked to see Draco gazing at him, and he was surprised to see the look of gentle understanding in the other's grey eyes.
Narcissa Malfoy met them in front of the huge wrought-iron gate of the Malfoy Manor.
Harry slept at 1 A.M., ruthlessly woken up by a nightmare half an hour later, and he stayed staring at his ceiling until the light of the rising sun slipped through the flimsy curtains, enveloping the whole room with the early heat. Harry wanted to curl deeper under his covers, desperate to get some sleep. Getting through the whole day without a wink of sleep was bad enough on a normal day. Harry just wanted to get swallowed up by his bed and never to emerge back again.
That was enough of a warning and Ginny walked out of the eighth year Common Room. Harry sat back on the loveseat and Malfoy fit himself beside Harry.
Ron had a relatively welcoming change after the War. Aside from the added firm muscles on his physique that he had acquired on his daily work-out (his chosen recreation), Ron became less grumpy and more tolerant and understanding. He even indulged Hermione on her nightly library session (her chosen recreation,
As if Draco’s voice were a hypnotic lull, Harry succumbed into the inviting warmth of sleep.
“What are you even so worried for? He’s not a child that you need to look after, Malfoy. Maybe you’re being such a bloody git that he wants to be away from you!”
"It might be hard for her, but Ginny's stronger than you credit her for. She can get through this if you break it to her this early," Hermione said, and suddenly grinned. "If it makes you feel better, I might've caught her more than once with Parkinson... getting out of a cupboard."
"This was a place that I thought would be a nice hideout from when father invited his elite friends over. Dobby seemed to be overly fascinated by the nature," Draco said, his voice soft and quiet as if afraid to disturb the magically entrancing ambience that surrounded them. "He used to accompany me here, before father knew about our foolish dallying, that is. We played in the mud like uncivilized louts, Dobby using his magic to build me my childhood-dream castle. I would push him to the creek, and then the odd creature will pretend to drown and I would save him, but not before casting a charm to keep me afloat. In fact, he was the one to teach me how to swim, no matter how barmy that sounded."
Bloody Potter!
Harry got through the horrible and tiring day through the grace of the
"I want to fucking skin that greasy git's ass and feed it to the Giant Squid," Harry spat, baring his teeth as his magic cackled around them. Malfoy tightened his hold around his hand soothingly.
After the War, and all the Death Eater trials and Hogwarts reparations that came with it, there were endless opportunities that awaited the Golden Trio. Because they had hugely contributed to the defeat of Voldemort, Harry and Ron were both invited to join the Auror Academy; Hermione was offered apprenticeships for some Ministry positions and had manage to apply for scholarships in few of Wizarding Universities across the continent. When Harry had ranted about all the paperworks and Ministry galas and all the fund-raising events that being an adult—and an adult who defeated Voldemort and was hailed "the Savior of Wizarding World" to be specific—entailed, Hermione immediately dropped all the potential Ministry trainings and scholarships without second thoughts and contacted Headmaster Dumbledore. Ron, to his relief, also supported the idea of normalcy Hogwarts could offer and encouraged the three of them to attend the so-called Eighth year.
"Let's just," Harry managed to croak, throat grainy and painfully heavy, "get back to the dorm."
"Get off the the couch, Finch-Fletchley," he gritted. Malfoy immediately went by his side. Finch-Fletchley sputtered before jumping out when Harry bared his teeth angrily.
Draco scoffed, a ghost of smirk on his lips, "you wish."
"They Crucio'd you?" Harry asked, angered. They were assured by Nigellus Black that Ginny wasn't punished. "I thought you were-"
well, i guess the CAPSLOCK HARRY from fifth yr is back. I've always kinda loved that Harry because his character was totally relatable. I couldnt understand why they hate the fifth book, i mean yea Harry was whiny and being awful but he had just undergone intense trauma ofc i would be screaming & yelling if i were in his situation. Who wouldn't?
“Oh shut it, Ronald. It’s the only way we could find Harry.” Granger hovered her wand atop the empty parchment and muttered something silently. Suddenly, words and lines materialized on the surface. Draco didn’t give anytime to let the fact that it was a map of Hogwarts to sink in before he roamed his eyes on the parchment, hoping he could find Harry—
Fuck it.
"Why am I having an uneasy feeling about this?" Ron muttered in an undertone. Hermione silenced him before Snape can hear and take House points.
“You were gone for the whole day, I was looking for you,” Harry said neutrally. Draco’s eyes flared and he stepped toward Harry threateningly. “What are you doing here?”
Harry wanted to confront (see: comfort) Malfoy, but frustratingly so, Zabini somehow figured out his goals and glare at him in warning before Harry could so much as make a step to Malfoy's direction.
"Harry wait," Ginny said, holding his wrist. "Do you have some time tomorrow? I'll be—"
Harry picked it up, examining the object. It was shiny and cold against his palm and the steady and mild thrum of magic undulated from its cool surface. Harry had a horrifying thought that it might be a dark object, it was a Malfoy heirloom after all, but he remembered what Hermione told them about things charged with dark magic;
eyes. The grey orbs appraising him with consideration that Harry thought Malfoy already drank his potion. But his tube was still full, held between his long fingers. Malfoy looking at him like that when he was completely compos mentis was different, and all together overwhelming, than under the influence of the Sedatus. Harry's breath quickened.
Before anyone of them could properly react, the Potion Professor came in his billowing robes. There wasn't a verbal command to enter, only the sharp dark eyes of the Potions Master had the Gryffindors and Slytherins scurrying to get inside the classroom.
"I bet you were rolling on your graves now. Father... Aunt Bella, everyone of you... because I can prove how fucking wrong you were, that your pathetic Dark Lord was wrong! I'm not weak, see? I can cast the Unforgivables! I can torture, I can kill! I can do anything! Because... b-because I'm... I'm s-strong..."
"I'm just... just Harry. Your Gryffindor rival."
Sitting by the lake. Draco wasted no time and ran to the door. Before he could make it out though, Granger called behind him.
So Harry denied it. He refused to acknowledge the meaning behind the secretive looks he and Draco shared, the thrill that he felt when they did, and the excessive amounts of daydreaming about the blond. He denied the fact that he is but obsessed with Draco. Even at Ron looking at him as if he’s gone barmy, the “you’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry” palpable in his face. Or even at Hermione’s narrowed eyes and pinched face that evidently tell him “I’m not having any of this again, Harry!”. Even when Ginny and Pansy shared surreptitious giggles behind their cupped hands. He continued to lie to himself and deny the fact that he’s totally obsessed rather than face the truth and bear the aggravating fear of what he might do.
Harry wanted to see the scornful expression, the haughty and disdain in Malfoy's eyes. But all Harry could see was icy barrier. And that, in itself was very troubling.
Hermione mildly poked Ron on his side. "Don't be dramatic, Ron." She turned to Harry. "What happened yesterday, Harry? You ran away unannounced. We were worried."
If Hermione and Ron were sharing knowing looks, trying to look discreet, Harry pretended not get angry.
Potter!" Draco raged, eyes almost popping off with burning anger and disdain. "I am a fucking Death Eater, always will be. People will always see the Death Eater, the Malfoy. The mark of Voldemort will forever be held against me. My father had made sure about that. It was his fault why I had to carry this burden and trauma for the rest of my life." Draco seemed to stop crying all of a sudden, his teary eyes glazing over, staring off in the distance. "You know what they did to me all those months, Potter? When Voldemort knew I hadn't managed to kill Dumbledore, he ordered me torture the Muggles in the basement. But I couldn't do that, I couldn't Crucio and kill them even at the threat of my own life. So they punish me in ways to assert my submission. Au-aunt Bella... she would- she would make me do things... like... like assaulting the Muggles or she would make me watch as Greyback feasted on them... Then some from his inner circle... they would... gripped my hair... slammed me to a wall... punched me and slapped me... tortured me... because they thought I deserved it. B-because I was... w-weak..."
, Potter?" A shrilly, sarcastic voice sounded behind him. Pansy Parkinson stood there, face soured in disgust. With Draco Malfoy beside her.
“After what he’d seen, no, I don’t think I would be able to see him as my rival anymore,” Harry said truthfully. It was the most honest thing he’d ever said in a long time. He was surprised by the easiness he felt with the admission.
"You knew it was murder." It wasn't a question. Draco turned to look at him, a scowl on his lips.
amplifies the emotion that the brewer is feeling during the preparation.
"It's cold, I liked the cold," Malfoy said in a soft voice, almost sounding meek and coy, though nothing escaped his heavily guarded eyes. Harry turned around, huffing out a weary sigh.
"Good night, Harr y."
"Crucio!"
For the first few weeks into the term, Harry was quite pre-occupied with thinking of ways how to not get ravaged by the crowd, and not to mention, how to shot down his ex-girlfriend's advances without meaning to be rude and hurting her, and how to survive the eighth year without being pressured by the abnormally large expectations placed upon him. Harry had not think about Malfoy since the trials.
What surprised and confused him, and probably most of the students closed to the Slytherin table, was when a solemn-looking Snape paused by Draco's side on the way to the Head Table. He gently squeezed Draco's shoulder, and Harry could see Draco minutely relaxed at the gesture, before the Potions Professor swished his robes and resumed walking.
"I don't want to hurt you Ginny," Harry inhumanely growled, that Harry didn't knew where it came from. "It would be in your best interest to get your face out of my sight right this instant!"
Harry stretched his hand across the space beside him, aware of the dismay heavy in his throat that he can't quite comprehend. Of course Draco was not stupid enough to get caught by his roommates, he was after all in a den full of Gryffindors. Maybe he was afraid to be seen with Harry on a bed? Maybe he was forced to help Harry sleep because he had seen him vulnerable last night? The last question triggered the memories of yesterday and Harry pulled himself up, refusing to wallow in embarrassment and shame that would inevitably follow after what happened.
"We are not blitzed out! The potions have no effects like the Draught of Euphoria or any substance that could addle the mind. I remember being completely sober—"
. Variables which are essentially changeable should not be a groundwork for Potions that could potentially promote the violation of rights between the involved parties."
“We went through your reports—”
And it baffled Harry so much why he would look at Draco and see a beautiful man rather than the pointy git that loved to sneer and snarl at him every chance he get. Because this is beyond normal, he should not be looking at Draco and describe him as beautiful. He should not even find Draco pleasing to look at.
Harry and Draco were with Hermione, Parkinson, Ron and Zabini in the eighth year Common Room. It was one o'clock in the morning, and the rest of the eighth years had retired to their dormitories or went out to their private trysts somewhere in the castle. It's still half an hour before the potions wore off, and Harry couldn't wait to end this day.
Harry grinned, heart thumping fast from the adrenaline. They stood in front of each other, broomstick in hand. "Glad I pulled you out from your boring study session then. That was very fun. Indeed."
And Harry badly wish he still is the way he was before the war, as much as it sounded improbable. There was just too much part of himself that died with him at the Forbidden Forest. The war had pushed him to a certain footing where he was forced to let go of the things that he used to believed in and prompted him to face new perspectives and priorities. And it was just heartbreaking that being with Ginny wasn't one of them.
“Are you hearing yourself?” Draco incredulously asked, pinching the spot between his eyes. “You have seen the way he broke down earlier, you dunderhead! He’s practically out of it. At this rate he most likely flung himself off the Astronomy tower or- or something—!”
"Then what do you feel?" Draco said after a moment. Harry blearily blinked his eyes, staring unseeingly at his bed hangings.
"My chosen recreational activity for this month is going to the library. I can't have two for a month; that destroys the purpose!" Hermione protested.
Harry panted when he crossed the threshold to the Library, his breathing apparently loud enough that Madam Pince glared at him. Harry strode along the aisle in between shelves of ancient tomes, casually browsing through some books, randomly picking a book that had seen better days. He stopped at the next section, body leaning against a shelf and eyes glued on the lone figure in the long table by the window, an open book in front of him and few others surrounding his area, idly scribbling on a piece of parchment.
Malfoy slowly raised his head. Harry saw fear in his grey eyes, unshed tears clinging on his long, golden lashes. Harry mindlessly summoned a clean cloth and wandlessly cast an
"So demanding, aren't we?" She sneered at him but Harry ignored her.
"I knew the feeling of being bereaved of father and I wouldn't wish that to anyone, nor would I think anyone deserved to get their fathers killed," Harry said. His fingers were itching to reach out, clenching and unclenching by his sides. "I'm very sorry, Draco."
Harry thought they would be heading straight outside of the wards to Disapparate back to Hogwarts but Draco clearly has other plans as he led Harry far into the woods at the northern part of the estate, past the overgrown bushes and trees with low hanging branches before coming to a stop by the running stream. Harry instantly knew it was magical as the surface of the water sparkled and glimmered as if being hit with light despite the sun hiding behind grey clouds. There was a grove of canty-colored flowers spreading the expanse of the trimmed lawn they stood upon and a lilting in the air that Harry attributed to the chirping of birds in the early Summer morning despite not seeing any animals on sight.
"As you have not able to make it on time, Mr Potter, I ordered everyone to go sit in pairs. I recalled that Ms Granger isn't your partner."
"You're awake," Draco mumbled hoarsely. Harry only managed a nod before Draco grunted and fell back on his chest. He heard light snores coming from the blond.
"I would appreciate a little sense of discretion and avoid divulging the harrowing details of your abominable rendezvous next time."
He was used to the hostility, arrogant condescension and jaundice in Malfoy's eyes, but gentleness...
And it didn't left him till this very day. The traumatic assaults, gaslighting words, degradation and the ridicule he was subjected under throughout his childhood and adolescence had left a permanent, potentially incurable mark on his psyche, as what the mind-healer had so uselessly supplied. His desensitization to pain and fear had not been because of his Gryffindorian bravery, neither his being dull and over-all incognizant to the feelings of another person was the reason why he thought Cho Chang was a whinging, blubbering bint.
"Get out," predictably, it was the first thing Harry blurted out, stupidly enough. He didn't miss the palpable hurt in Draco's face as the blond stood and obediently walked out.
, him and Malfoy not being awful at each other is definitely not you can call normal. And this is becoming bothersome. At least for Harry's part.
He knew Malfoy had definitely changed since the war. Ever since the term started, Malfoy had barely made any interaction with Harry, let alone an eye contact aside from the first and last time they accidentally looked at each other at the Start of the term banquet. Harry had not heard of his voice, and Draco had not intentionally bumped into him in the corridors and looked (or glared) at Harry's way in class since the start of the year, as what he was inclined to do before. Malfoy seemed to be blending in the background instead of putting himself on the spotlight like he always does, crouching in his seat as if wanting to disappear out of view, or casting his eyes down as if desperately wanting to not bring attention to himself.
“Truth or not, I sometimes wish there was another me, or many versions of Harry’s, existing somewhere else,” his voice turned wistful. “Warden... I felt like he could be me, in an alternate universe. But then again he lost nearly everyone in his life. And it’s not an alternate reality if it... mirrored my very own.”
Harry did, his lashes grazing against the surface of Draco’s palm. It was gone too soon, and Harry was about to open his eyes, when a finger caressed the line on his nose. The finger gracefully danced across his face, down the planes of his jaw, brushed his hair lightly before returning to his brows and closed lids and the curve of his lips. Harry’s muscles gradually eased, and soon after, his breath stabled and his body went limp. He was slowly falling into the painfully blissful void of unconsciousness and the fear suddenly gripped him.
"I—We—" she stuttered, looking anywhere but Harry. "She helped me last year, everytime I got Crucio'd."
“We’re visiting your parents,” Draco whispered. “We’re going to Godric’s Hollow.”
Draco walked up beside him and just stared at the lake. Harry turned around to face the lake but all he wanted to do was face Draco and looked at him.
Draco smiled feebly, though his eyes still held the same look of self-contempt Harry doesn't want to see swimming in those bedazzling grey eyes. He simply hated seeing Draco wallowing in shame over his actions that couldn't be controlled. "And you shouldn't really care if your actions are befitting or not. No one could maintain a proper person in the face of great emotions."
morning to both of you."
"Mum dropped hints of marriage now and then. She was so eager to make you a part of the family that she failed to see things were not the same as they used to be," Ginny's smile turned rueful. "I guess there was just this constant pressure to be the Hero's wife and everyone neglected to ask me what I like."
Harry perused Snape's instructions regarding the coloring of the potions and the brewer's emotions.
As if reading his thoughts, Draco nodded tolerantly with a small piteous smile and pulled Harry closer. He brought his arms around Harry's torso and his other arm under Harry's neck, their legs twining under the sheets. Harry can feel Draco's chest falling and rising as he breathed, nose against his neck and drinking in Draco's lovely scent—a weird yet addicting tangy smell of citrus and cinnamon —and the sensations alone helped Harry calm down.
this was supposed to be updated two weeks ago, but my mind had been in a very ugly place and i lost my inspiration. so this chap contained more than 8k words to compensate for my lack of update.
, the urge to please Malfoy, or Harry's just crazier than he let on. After the unfortunate trip down Snape's sleeping chambers, Draco's mood had abysmally became even more cynical. When Professor McGonagall took 25 points from the Slytherin  after Draco purposefully bumped against a Ravenclaw Muggleborn and spat his once twisted Pureblood ideals that even the blond's fourteen-year-old self would be embarrassed, Harry utilized his flair for the spontaneity to somehow lessen Draco's embarrassment in the wake of this cursed project.
It was like a new Malfoy had come back. A reclusive, subdued, and passive Malfoy, not the snarky, snobbish, haughty, all-around awful elitist schoolboy rival that Harry knew for seven years. And that Malfoy had passed on to insult him with his choices of books was horrifyingly surprising to say the least.
A hysterical laughter bubbled out of Harry and he wheezed and doubled over, letting out a series of maniacal grins and snickers. Malfoy shook his shoulders.
, to say. "Er... There was something we need to do."
". And right now, as Harry crush the Chizpurfle fangs into very fine powder and added the Salamander blood to the now boiling turquoise potion in the medium-heat cauldron, Harry felt the burning ire and pictured it was Malfoy's head in the mortar that he was crushing. And Harry was sure it's not highly advisable to amplify that feeling.
Harry offered none of his usual dry retorts, neither had he so much as look at Snape's direction. He went straight to the empty chair beside Hermione. Before he could touch his arse on the seat though, Snape loomed over him.
"Yeah. With me," he gulped when Draco gaped at him. "I mean, if you want to. I have- er, a blanket. And of course, a pillow. If you... want. I'm not—"
Harry furrowed his brows, “I just... I feel like I should do something else? And not just, you know, reading the same material over and over again?” He shrugged helplessly.
"No one is faulting you Hermione," Ron placated, chuckling at Hermione's slightly troubled look. "And NEWT's is months away! You could do with a bit of recreational reading."
"Seamus threw me a pillow straight to my face when I tried," Ron shrugged. With that, they proceed to walk out of the dorm at Neville's sleepy inarticulate mumbles.
." He drawled in his haughty, snooty way. Harry emphatically nodded his head.
Harry was staring at Malfoy during lunch.
"Potions Project. The thing I wrote to you about," Draco replied drily. At Narcissa's arched eyebrows, he sighed heavily. "Please cease the queries, mother. My emotions at the moment are not something you want to interest yourself in. Can we proceed already?"
brewer," Snape paused, narrowed beady eyes sweeping over the students. "Suffice it to say, you will be paired off with another student since
“Shh, it’s okay,” Draco soothed, fingers still gently flirting across his cheek, when Harry’s body jerked. “Don’t be afraid, I’m here. Just go to sleep, Harry.”
Great.
"Ehem."
“Yeah, I know.”
It all clicked to Harry. He now understood why Draco was being strange upon coming to eight year, why he'd lost his derisive sneers and sharp scowls, why he was oddly docile and agreeable, like a doll programmed to yield at every command. By the things that happened in his childhood and Voldemort's reign in Malfoy manor, it was just expected that he lost all his masks and showed what he truly is; someone who readily submit and acquiesce.
“No,” he snorted. Smiling, he let himself be permeated by yesterday’s memories. “I was surprised that we hadn’t reverted back to being the rivals that we used to before, since Quidditch always brings out our competitiveness. But I should hardly be surprised anymore. He’s not the person that I used to hate and... he was my Potions project partner and helped me a great deal.”
"Great! The old fool wanted to see me. What a great timing!"
Thank you for the Kudos and the comments! 💕
Snape was already speaking in front of the eighth year Gryffindors and Slytherins when Harry entered the Potions classroom. Snape looked at him, dark eyes narrowing and lips curling in disdain.
"But then Voldemort came back. Everything changed as easy as a single flick of a wand. My perfect life turned upside down. My impeccable father had heedlessly groveled to attend to the commands of a Half-blooded madman. My father who was prideful had kissed a monster's hem and cowered in fear. I felt lost, confused; for the first time in my life, I was questioning the things that was supposed to be absolute. And then Lucius failed his task so I had to save my whole family by doing a suicidal mission that intend to kill me and my family. And when I take the mark, I felt like my life had been leading me to it. But I could never be happy, I could never think to make my father proud anymore. Because the life that he promised us had been a lie. That was not the life that I envisioned to live.
, as his brain usefully supplied.
"Pray tell, Severus, what you have in mind."
"You can't dismiss me that easily," Draco sniffed, his tone sounding like his fourteen year old caustic self. "For all the rationalities you boasted, you sure are acting very illogical. Haven't you foreseen the consequences of your actions? Pairing me with a Gryffindor? To Potter no less," He said in a bitter tone, snarling at Severus' unaffected face. "Potter had gone loony when he was taking the fucking amplifying potion. You know what he could do at that state? Blow the whole fucking castle. Or maybe I should've let him see you, so he could really blow your greasy face up."
Malfoy's eyes slightly widened, though Harry almost didn't see the infinitesimal change in Malfoy's impassive face. But Harry saw the shock, and he looked down to see Malfoy's toes curling, as if repulsed and wanting to dig against the ground and hide themselves.
Harry was briefly reminded of the time in fifth year when he asked Nearly Headless Nick if Sirius could somehow come back as a ghost. Thinking about it now, it seemed a little barmy but he was angry and in sorrow then. Harry truly understood where Ginny came.
“Potter,” the familiar Malfoy sneer contorted his face. At a different situation, Harry would probably be thrilled at the familiar sight. But Draco’s face showed no signs of the once schoolboy malice. It was all cold daggers and tumultuous incense. “Our very own hero, playing Auror again, eh? Using your magical map to stalk me once more? What do you want from me this time?”
Draco understood the concept completely. It was simple, human psychology. Draco might not be so good at reading other people’s emotions like Pansy was, be a little too self-absorbed most of the time, but he can figure out the effects of complex trauma to a person’s mind and expect a person’s behavior who underwent emotional abuse as a child. And Draco knew what Potter’s trying to convey; it’s one of the few things Draco shared with him. A very fucked-up childhood.
"Check on me?" Harry snapped then barked a jarring laugh, that is not unlike Sirius'.
Draco tucked himself under Harry’s Gryffindor red blanket. There was an inch or three between them. Harry’s chest constricted, his arm that was close to Draco tingled and flushed. He closed his eyes tightly. This isn’t working. What was he even thinking? He knew in himself that he was fucked up, that he craved physical contact, one of the many things that were deprived of him as a child. It was another thing to crave physical contact from Draco Malfoy. Stupid, this isn’t working.
"Harry?" Draco called. Harry snapped up to look at him. Draco is staring back at him expectantly, a hand tentatively cradled his side of face. Almost instinctively, Harry leaned into the warmth, relieved.
“Have you seen where Harry went?” Draco asked, tone embarrassingly high-pitched.
Harry reached out to touch Draco, but he hesitantly stopped halfway. Draco stared down at his hovering hand, so Harry reached for Draco's and held it, slotting his fingers into Draco's soft and aristocratic ones. The remains of his distress bated down when Draco squeezed his hand back in reassurance.
Suddenly, Malfoy growled when Parkinson laughed loudly at something Hermione said, putting an arm around the bushy-haired witch. The other four people stared confusedly, while Harry only clenched his jaw, when Malfoy jumped up and accosted Hermione.
Harry whipped his head to look at Ginny, so fast he thought his neck would snap. He couldn't decide whether to believe that bit. Harry had saved him from the Fiendfyre and gave the Wizengamot a testimony to acquit Draco and Narcissa but Harry had not received so much as a thank you for what he'd done. Not that he was expecting any. But Harry couldn't imagine Draco saying sorry. A stiff and formal thank you Draco could probably muster. But owning up to his mistakes and apologizing?
Just by the looks of glee and intrigue from the teaching staff, Severus knew his proposition had been allowed. The curl of his lips showed dark enthusiasm.
“Have you thought of what your monthly recreational activity would be for November? Or would you rather keep your activity the same?”
Harry must’ve read what Draco was thinking because he didn’t give Draco time to voice it out.
"That's why I asked," Harry snickered. Draco rolled his eyes but his hand traveled to lay at the back of Harry's head, fingers gently tugging on his unruly hair.
This is why he needed to go to Severus before he himself'll go bonkers. Draco could just feel the urge in him to submit under Potter's green eyes and physical contact.
Harry didn't know what to do. He couldn't even manage his own emotions, let alone the person whom he was supposed to hate hysterically breaking down in front of him. His history with confronting intense emotionality was when he and Cho were dating, which he eventually bollocksed up.
"Ginny," Harry beamed. "I haven't seen you in days. I wanted to apologize to you but you were—"
"Why is he staring at you then?"
Harry liked the sound of his name on Draco's mouth. "Do you seriously want to hear what's on my mind?" He asked haltingly. "It wouldn't be any good."
When they were left in solitude in the middle of the hallway, Harry sighed deeply, feeling like all his energy had deserted him. He slightly leaned against Malfoy's body not giving a single shit about their very,
“This is tiring,” Harry sighed, the tight lines around his lips and the clench of his jaws speak for themselves. He pulled his knees to his chest. Draco pulled his hand from Harry’s face. “I wish I could sleep. Though that would be asking too much.”
Draco had seen Potter in his emotional outburst in Monday. He didn't know what the Gryffindor was angry about during the potion preparation, but Draco had seen enough of fifth year and knew that Potter was inclined to intense emotional unstableness. Draco had seen Potter's warring emotions in his eyes, the confusion on his face when Draco was being gentle throughout his rage, wanting to get angry at Draco but not being able to because of the potion. And Potter must've seen the same warring emotions in Draco's eyes because he suddenly grin. And that bright grin did not bode so well for Draco.
"Mate," Ron called from his bed. Harry blearily peeked under his blanket. "Fancy to get some breakfast? I could bring some back up here, if you like."
"Do you want to sleep?" Harry asked, pink-faced, faces still inches from each other, a thrum of warmth bubbling just beneath his skin. Draco's grey eyes held the brightest and most beautiful constellations he had ever seen.
," Zabini said as if Malfoy was being an idiot and couldn't get the whole concept. Malfoy turned to Harry and made a noncommittal sound before turning back to staring at the wall.
"Harry!" Hermione exclaimed. Harry found it oddly pleasing seeing the guilty blush on her cheeks. He only offered a stiff smile before digging into his brunch, which rather felt like a grimace on his deadpanned face. "We were trying to wake you up earlier to watch the game, but I supposed you haven't slept well enough so we left you be."
That was the last thing Harry heard before he slammed the door of their dorm room shut. He cradled his temple, nursing a blooming headache from all the misguided arguments and counterarguments that he was sure made no sense brawling over. They should've argued on whether Snape appeared to have gone around the bend. Harry jumped into his bed, arms folded behind his head and looked up at the ceiling.
"I'm not a homophobe if that's what you're implying," Ron said, sounding offended. "Charlie is gay, Hermione. And if you've forgotten, Percy and Oliver are about to be engaged. I just never thought of Ginny... not being straight, since she'd dated probably every boys in our year."
Harry sat straight beside the blond, vaguely sickened at the thought of being near Malfoy. Harry supposed his partner felt the same, moving restlessly at the same time trying to move away from him. They were both silent, tensed beside each other.
“I have, but it isn’t plausible at all since I would just ended up being surrounded with people. I hate crowds.”
Draco recalled the confrontation Harry and Dumbledore had during their first time with the Potions project. The cupboard. With no food and water. For days. Harry had went through various degrees of abuse through out his whole life. He was not only physically abused by his own blood, even his emotional needs and basic necessities were neglected. And then Hogwarts came, where he was subjected to mental and physical torture, manipulation, and grief. He has no family. And Draco had used to make fun of that fact.
, the parchment that he provided to jot down their experience on was charmed for the writer to express what they sincerely felt and thought under the potions). Some were intense but not too inappropriate.
"Can you stop it?" Harry snapped. Hermione looked at him as if he were going loony. "If you wanted to be all disgustingly couple-y at each other then you can excuse yourselves now and spare me the suffering."
Harry was hit with a painful nostalgia as he stepped beside her, getting a whiff of her faint floral cologne. Her gentle scent seemed to trigger the memories from those chaste times. Harry recalled the giddy rush of an innocent, fresh relationship before the war had ruthlessly destroyed it. Those times felt like lightyears away; both of them were too young and naive and trying to forget the impending doom that loomed over them. His heart felt heavy in his chest as he encased her in a hug.
Harry had seen Malfoy's withdrawn persona brought by the war silently seething in anger every time he went back to the eighth year Common Room after a trip from the Hospital Wing. Even at Malfoy's taciturn and recessive disposition, Harry had known Malfoy for seven years and could see through his mask of indifference. Harry had caught on to the light twitch in Malfoy's left eyes and the prominent throbbing vein at his temple and translated it to annoyance. It's the only indication that Malfoy could still feel emotions, what with his doll-like, emotionless façade.
"Potter," someone's voice called, "Harry. Harry, can you hear me?"
"Of course I do, I'm just here..."
"Where do you think we'd brew the potion?" Harry asked before the awkward silence could get any worse. To his surprise, Malfoy only shrug his sharp shoulders. "What can you suggest?" Again, another shrug. It's starting to really piss Harry off. "The Room of Requirements, then."
“Might’ve fooled me.”
“Did you take up your friends’ offer to fly again?”
The odd sensations in his ears incrementally vanished; Harry grasped the soothing lilt of the voice, he recognized as Draco's, that tried to coax him out of the overwhelming deluge of emotions that swamped over him. He took shaky breaths, hand on his shoulder and another on his face trying to ground him and Harry focused on that calming feeling, until his fuzzy eyes cleared and it zoomed on Draco's face, eyes clear and open and gently urging.
"Didn't know you were some library assistant now, Did Madam Pince hired you?" Harry blurted out before he can't help himself. Draco abruptly stopped writing, pursing his lips before he resumed. Harry cleared his throat. "I mean, er. Obviously, I'm here to, uh, study. Of course. What else."
"Harry?" The tentative voice, it's Hermione's. But Harry felt like his head was plunged deep under water, and her echoing voice seemed distance away, until he couldn't decipher the jumble of indistinct sounds that surrounded him, gradually fading in the background as the sharp buzz and whizz filled his ears, like a colony of wasps droning about. He find it hard to breathe.
. Now he felt very murderous. "Why? Because you don't trust my partner? Because he's a Slytherin?" Harry growled, "or because you're starting to care for me now that I'm a fucking adult! Why haven't you deign to check on me when I was five and the Dursley's had locked me up in my cupboard for days, without food and water? Why haven't you check on me when I was eight and I had severe cold but they didn't even send me to the Hospital? Why haven't you check on me when I was punched by Dudley almost to my death when I was ten? I had suffered abuse under the family that you deliberately had me under the custody for throughout my childhood but you never check on me. Not once.
. When he came to the magical school Harry was one of the people to label them mini-Death Eaters in training. They were selfish, egoistic, bullies who bring down other people for their own enjoyment, and blood purists. Harry didn't knew when his views changed. Maybe it was that time he saw Draco breaking down in Myrtle's bathroom before he sliced him with an unknown curse. Or when he realized Draco couldn't even properly torture other people even at the threat of his own life. Or when Draco didn't identify him at the manor.
But Harry couldn’t just deny the fact that, no matter how much he hated the idea of, it was purgative. It was better than reading the latest installment of The Memoirs of Saturnine the Villain and re-reading it all over again in cold detachment for him to avoid any sentimentalities. Harry didn’t know he needed it until he felt the inducing, healing hands reaching out to his soul; Draco’s somber gaze, open and expressive eyes, and coaxing words shrouding all the uncertainties and fears he accumulated throughout his troubled life, irradiating contentment and ease through him that he hadn’t quite known before. Somehow, it felt like the Imperius, though it wasn’t sharp and invasive; it rather felt like an embrace of warmth and gentleness.
But even if he tentatively started to open up to her, Harry still felt uncomfortable sitting through and reminiscing the awful memories. He had spent most of his life burying them under normalcy, after all. He bit his lower lip, tapping his fingers in a dizzying rhythm on the tabletop.
"Malfoy. It's not your—"
Potter, the sweet, innocent looking eleven-year-old Potter whom Draco had offered a handshake only to get turned down and chosen over that ugly, redheaded Weasel. No one had ever turn his friendship down, no one had ever had the guts to refuse him. Well, except the idiotic, messy bespectacled git!
"Oh, sorry mate. But I think you should head down stares." At Harry's consternation, Neville explained, "It's Draco. He asked for your presence."
"Or it's because there's only so much Dark Magic one can endure," Hermione mused. "Premature death of geriatric causes is not unprecedented when one dabbles with Dark Arts. The longer a witch or wizard trifles with Dark Magic the longer its essence wounds around their Magical Core, thus, weakening it, and by extension, their body cells which exposes the person to terminal diseases. I even read about the Dark Arts speeding up a human's life span..."
"I don't have a preference for snarky Slytherins!" Harry argued. He almost threw them the spoon in hand when Hermione and Ron had the same pitiful expression. Even the emotions they display have to be the same. It felt like a blatant mock at his pathetic single arse. "Stop it!"
"It's okay, Draco," Harry said placatingly but Draco continued on as if not hearing Harry, his shoulders slumped in remorse, eyes cast down to his knees.
Harry gritted his teeth, "well? You call this well?" Harry had risen to his feet, face scowling nastily at the old Headmaster. Harry shrugged Malfoy's hand on his shoulder. "I could hardly ever get on without feeling like going crazy and you call this well?! And you only really thought of Inter-House Cooperation," Harry spat the words as if it disgusted him, "after the war when it was your own bias toward Gryffindors and prejudice against the Slytherins that had caused riff and misunderstandings between the Houses! And you wanted to fix this now, with this ridiculous Histrionicus hogwash, when it was already irreparable!
They didn't even noticed he was sitting before them, heads ducking down to whisper at each other. Brilliant.
"I—I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean it," Harry said again, rather lamely. But the expression on the blond's face was bordering on hysteria, shaking his head hastily.
"Maybe because you're a bloody fucking idiot with a crippling sense of hero complex," Draco snarled. "I'm not your charity case, Potter, nor am I a fucking damsel you need to save."
The five Slytherins all shared a knowing, quite mysterious look and collectively turned to Malfoy expectantly, who stayed staring at the wall in front of them. Even the Gryffindors all expected him to say something snarky or condescendingly laugh at Harry's face for being such a sappy, hopeless romantic but he remained staring at the wall unseeingly. Zabini cleared his throat.
Malfoy raised his head, and Harry can't get over the feeling of disorientation when he looked at those dull, grey eyes. They were once full of haughtiness that Harry once despised.
"I hope so."
"Er, Dumbledore wanted to see you in his office," the little boy immediately run away after hearing Harry's growl.
Harry helplessly looked at Ron and Hermione, who both had apologetic expressions. He looked back at Ginny who was now standing.
Harry sighed once again, the tight knots in his stomach unloosing, wondering to himself when he start getting so uncomfortable in the presence of Malfoy so much that it renders him inarticulate.
"A very
"It's your redheaded, little Weaslette, Potter," Draco nastily said, grey eyes growing sharper at Ginny. Harry touched his arms and pursed his lips at the blond, before turning to smile at Ginny's glowering face.
"Can you stop tailing me like a fucking dog?" Harry snapped irately and turned to look at Malfoy, who was calmly staring back at him.
. It was Friday afternoon, three days since they had started their Potions project. There was a significant difference in their taste. While he had been angry while brewing the amplifying potion, it had brought a vile, scalding aftertaste that could be comparable to a sulfur clawing at his esophagus; not unlike the feeling of the searing rage that flowed through his veins.
"It is highly inappropriate and assuming to suggest nonconsensual matters to foster—"
just a heads up, this chapter is emotionally heavy (?) and depressing. pls be guided. & the kudos and comments are deeply appreciated! keep em coming hehe :)
updating using my phone was actually so shitty im going to probably come back to this soon when i fix my laptop. in the meantime, i have this pt.2 of the past chapter for y’all :))
“But, at the same time, we were the same. And when I remember him, I can’t help but feel it’s okay to feel this way. Because I’ve always thought... it’s not okay.” Harry both looked and sounded vulnerable and Draco’s heart ached. “Sirius and everyone else deserved to be mourned. Is it selfish of me to not shed even just a tear... because I can’t. I just felt so numb and helpless. I know... I should’ve tried harder but... I can’t. No matter how hard I try. I’m not weak.” He whispered the last word frailly, as if the weight of the word on his tongue had made him feel like he was. Weak.
Harry curled lightly to himself, and Draco fit behind him snuggly, his chest to Harry's back and knees folding behind the Gryffindor's. Harry tensed briefly before he gradually melted against the blond's chest, their shoulders aligning. This was the feeling of being held, of being pulled closer, of having the warmth of a body behind you, another person's arm around your torso; and it's entirely a piece of small heaven that Harry was missing out on his entire life.
Draco looked surprised, and Harry realized he had gone and done it again, saying things without thinking them through and inviting himself where he was not meant to go.
"I went with Muggles because I was sure that no wizard would accept me, and Muggles couldn't know me, and no one loved me. I once made this guy's bed for him every morning, made him his fucking smoothie, and he dumped me during my first set of exams because I wouldn't drop them to fly to Ibiza with him on a whim." He shook his head so that the hair fell to his cheekbones. "It was pathetic."
“Don’t go digging for more now, Potter; you’ve had your fill for the day. I meant that I’m surprised that you—I mean, I didn’t—” Draco huffed, unable to find the words. “I didn’t think you could possibly be…” Draco trailed off again into silence.
“Sorry, it’s just—“
"I'm glad you stayed," he said after a minute passed.
Long minutes passed like that until Draco's arm tensed and he shifted, pressing his body insistently into Harry's. It was like the quality of the air changed, or his magic perked up upon noticing a shift in Draco's, but something made goosebumps ripple across his body and charged the puffs of air on his neck so that the hair there stood on end.
"Other than soiling those sheets with whatever that swill you call cologne is, my things are fine. And while my time is valuable to me, a few hours of sleep lost to babysitting you isn't worth the time it would take to draw up an invoice. Let's call it even."
. The voice in his head was all the more painful to hear considering he'd had a reprieve from it. Blind, willful hope kept him afloat, and with even that gone, he was empty, washed out.
The book was a real thing now. At least he had that. He pulled a galley copy from his breast-pocket and restored it to its standard size. Cracking its spine for the first time, he decided now was as good a time as any to thumb through it. He would read it cover-to-cover in the weeks to come, but he was content to drop in at random to see what the many drafts, interviews, and phials of memories had conjured on the page so far. If nothing else, it gave him ample reason to keep from anxiously scanning the crowd for the anticipated flash of white hair.
"Bit of a dump, though?" Harry said. Draco bit his lip, caught between a scowl and a smile.
Andromeda ruffled his hair. "That's very thoughtful of you, Edward. I'm sure that if he were to join us for dinner, he'd be thrilled to have the chance to sit next to you."
Hermione snorted.
"I'm serious; I fucking need you."
“I didn't see a note about erythema in your chart,” Harry continued. “The ulcers on your shins.”
Getting off, he hisses, and then he's off to the loo, hunched and bow-legged, and the fan runs so you hear nothing.
Harry searched his memory of the moment. Something stuffy, antiquated—
"Sirius,
"Don't," Harry threatened sharply. Ron shook his head and continued to speak over him.
Harry leaned in, steadied himself with his free hand against the cold stone behind Malfoy's head. "Ready?"
Harry brought his hand beneath his chin, fluttering his eyelashes to the sky. "Who, me?"
"I know," Draco interrupted.
"Draco—"
“What? One good lung collapse deserves another.” Draco laughed at his own joke when Harry didn’t, summoning two gauges of needles and a length of tubing to accompany it. The spell to find the air pocket wasn’t a difficult one—he needn’t bring anyone else to witness the procedure.
"Yeah, of course. It's taken, currently," Draco mumbled, watching as another bloke sidled up behind it, piss joining the stream trickling down the curve of the pavement into the grate. The pink had nearly washed free from his hair, only a peachy-hue remaining, stronger in the tips than at the roots. He chewed his lip, staring at the dumpster like it was something of interest, held in profile to Harry.
Harry pocketed the note and promised himself that he'd reach out and follow through on their offer— soon. But soon could mean a lot of things, and
, or would you like to explain your definitions to Pans and Luna here?”
"As his grandmother, it was obvious that the best place for him to grow up was under your care. It still is," he offered, and damn the Blacks for their stiff upper lips when they needed them. She wiped a tear but nodded stoically, silently imploring him to go on.
"Oh," Draco said, looking stunned. "You don't—"
“You like this?” Malfoy asks. His eyes don’t flick up to Harry’s anymore. His gaze is heavy and falls to the floor.
came over him, decidedly indecent thoughts flickering through his mind.
"So," Harry stopped to clear his throat before continuing, "when are we going to test on the potions? And don't give me a shrug for an answer. I'm asking you, answer it precisely." He added when he saw Malfoy on the act of shrugging.
Harry felt a new found appreciation for his best friends' patience during his own angsty and volatile phase back in fifth year. Harry already had a patience for a thread, and if it weren't for the Sedatus, Harry would've already exploded half the castle in his frustration. It was only ten in the evening but Harry was desperate to call it a day.
Malfoy stared at Harry unnervingly until he... acquiesced, standing up and collecting his things.
Harry walked to his side, putting an arm around Draco and the blond relaxed against his hold, putting his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry's heart was clutched with sorrow at the mention of his tiny friend. No matter how much Dobby aggravated him in second year by his misguided efforts to keep him safe, Dobby was one of his friends who stood by him loyally throughout the years. He lost count of the times Dobby had willingly helped him and his friends, and at the end, the creature had to die saving them. Just like Hedwig, Harry had also tried not to think about Dobby too much after the war because their deaths always caused him severe anguish. Right now, as Draco talked about Dobby almost reverently, sorrow lodged in Harry's throat and find himself suppressing a sob.
Harry was happy Hermione and Ron weren't here. He couldn't deal with so much guilt weighing on him on top of the amplified anger. Not for the first time he bombarded Snape with colorful expletives in his mind for having such a brilliant idea.
, Severus thought bitterly. The very person behind this preposterous '
"Why would I read that slimy prat's instructions!" Harry glowered at him but Malfoy's expression remained serene. "He's the reason I'm a step away from crushing your ridiculously blond head!"
Severus' eyes shined maliciously and his lips pulled in a dangerous snarl. He stalked silkily to tower over the Gryffindor, who was now trying to hide behind Draco.
"What?" Ron asked, face pinched as if torn whether he would vomit or rage. "My sister Ginny with Pansy Parkinson... I never thought she'd swing that way."
“Do you believe in alternate reality?” Harry whispered, eyes distant, glinting in the dimly lit wand.
Malfoy's expressionless eyes focused on his and Ginny's entwined hands. For absolutely no reason, Harry hastily disconnected his hand from Ginny's. He thought he heard her snicker, but chose to ignore it.
This was what scared Harry. The idea of being vulnerable and exposed. Suppressing his emotions was a default reaction, and he quashed down all the potentially compromising sentimentalities for a reason.
Harry stared at Draco, mesmerized and fascinated. He couldn't believe Draco was deliberately opening up to him without the influence of the Histrionicus potion. Draco normally looked so guarded, but right now he was so amicable and good-natured. Seeing Draco willingly opening up to him meant a lot to Harry.
Severus had a speculative glint in his dark eyes, though it was lost in the face of Draco's sneer.
Harry stared at Draco, seeking out Draco's hand and holding it tight. Draco offered a tight smile before placing his head on Harry's shoulder. That went on for the rest of duration. When Lucius Malfoy's casket was closed, Draco's friends stood up and offered their somber condolences to Draco before walking out. Narcissa didn't stayed too long, kissing Draco's cheek and sharply made her exit, while Snape lingered beside Draco for a couple of minutes, wordless, before clasping Draco's shoulder and also left in a billowing of robes.
"I'm okay, just," Harry said, shifting under the covers and laying on his side. He turned his head slightly to Draco, who was raising his eyebrows. "Lay down beside me. Please."
“It was,” he paused, gathering his thoughts which had been filled once again with the image of a smiling, windswept blushing blond. He scratch his nails futilely against his denim-clad legs to shake himself off his particularly cloying musings. “Um, different. A good kind. But it was shocking, all together. Remember the person I talked to you about before... the person whom I hated my entire school life?”
“How am I supposed to bloody relaxed?” Harry asked, high-pitched with panic. Draco shifted so his whole body was facing toward Harry. He opened his eyes, half-lidded, and Harry felt his gaze hot on his face. He mimicked Draco’s position.
After Snape silenced them, he proceeded to the next pair. At the malevolent look in Snape's eyes, Harry knew that it was theirs' even before Snape ruthlessly read their accounts.
For the first time in a very long time, he slept peacefully.
Harry just wanted to know what Draco truly felt. The bit of vulnerability he saw in Draco's grey eyes last night had him intrigued. He was confused why the blond had to put up with this useless doll-like mask. And if Draco was hiding something behind this new vacant persona, Harry wanted nothing but to know every bit of them.
"Look at me, Draco," Harry ordered. Surprisingly, Draco did. "Are you saying they're trying to kill you next?"
Hermione seemed to comprehend because she nodded, a sympathetic look in her eyes. "I totally understand how awful your relatives treated you. And I wish you've gotten rid of the things they've caused you. But your problems matter too, Harry, no matter how much you think you're causing a burden."
Harry watched Draco go, and he could feel the pit of shame and self-hatred in his stomach growing bigger. He couldn’t call Draco’s name even if he wanted to because he was choking in his guilty. He had suspected Draco of doing something illegal again, when they had just shared all the precious vulnerable moments and the most wonderful kiss Harry’d ever had. And now Harry felt like he had destroyed something before it even started.
"Hm."
"You might've forgotten where we were, Potter. It's the safest place—"
"Hello Mr Potter." She turned to look at Draco questioningly.
Harry spent almost two hours under the relaxing spray of the shower. He need not to worry about the remaining hot water since he's the only one who use the bathroom every morning, his roommates always ended up sleeping in. Probably due to exhausting activities late night or lying awake until the dawn broke.
"So, I take it the Histrionicus potion is going well?" The old Headmaster said merrily, eyes twinkling even more at the sight of the two arch rivals.
"Sit on my bed," Harry softly instructed. Without so much as a protest or a sneer, Draco did as Harry instructed. The Gryffindor stayed standing on his spot by his bed, staring down on Malfoy.
There wasn't much to do about their melancholic situation. Dumbledore appointed Mind Healers to check up on the students, and every students were required to meet for therapy every once in a week since term started. McGonagall and Hooch decided to implement Friendly Quidditch matches every Saturdays for the students' recreational activity and the 7th and 8th years are permitted to go to Hogsmeade every night until curfew.
But before he could even think of deciphering it and
“You have no way of proving it were true,” Draco stiffly said. “A theory. Of Granger’s nonetheless. Have you heard about her preposterous campaign about freeing house elves? That should’ve given you some warning bells.”
The next time he awoke, it was to the hubbub of conversation and bodies shuffling outside of his closed bed hangings. There was a dip in the mattress on the other side of his bed, a warmth of a body who had occupied it, and the vague smell of citrus, emanated from the empty spot. Yet Harry felt cold, disappointed.
"Okay, mate?" Ron beamed, smiling more enthusiastically for Monday morning. His drooping eyes and tensed shoulders told Harry he too did not get a good night sleep. Or if he ever slept at all.
Bloody Potter.
Harry knew he would feel awful about this later. He couldn't even imagine the shame that will inevitably hunt him when the words that he rudely accosted Dumbledore would sink in. Not to mention he just triggered one of his close friends. He knew for sure Ginny wouldn't be so lenient after that. He didn't even know how to apologize for being an irrational prat. That irrational, raging part of him, that was amplified by the
“You need to relax,” Draco said, quietly that Harry thought he was humming. Harry turned his head to look at him and saw Draco’s profile, his eyes closed.
And it was beyond strange; the amount of pleasure Harry took in seeing Draco calm under his touch, the happiness that filled him when Draco abruptly stopped mocking the third year Hufflepuffs that passed by them when Harry admonished him. Draco was never this agreeable, and Harry never had this influence over Draco before.
“You sure are cranky for someone who’s high on the Sedatus, Draco,” Pansy snickered, not least bit apologetic of the fact Draco had walked in on them, Ginevra’s finger under her skirt, doing... whatever stuff he would not deign to imagine. “I remember you not being this excessively tetchy and unbearable when you once walked in on me riding Finch-Fletchley.”
"Stop what?"
"If you care to think about it," Hermione mused, smiling at Harry knowingly. "You and Ginny strangely have the same preference for snarky Slytherins. Or were you both just coincidentally happen to be masochistic?"
"Of course, it could be that, Ron. But you're suggesting that the Ministry let this self-appointed violence against criminals occur, which very much disregarded the Criminal Reform Act of 1998. I'm sure Shackelbolt won't allow it—"
"Don't sound so jealous, Pans. It sounded so unlike you," Ginny snipped back, but her eyes twinkled in amazement.
"Thankful?" Draco chewed on the sandwich and swallowed before sneering. "Being with you had diminished my will to live even more and now you want me to be thankful?"
"Let's start the potions."
"First who catches the snitch wins," Draco grins challengingly. With a wink, Draco streaked to the direction of the goalpost, where the distinct golden glint of the snitch hovered.
However, as Harry was engulfed in Draco's warmth, the other's chest expanding against his back as Draco breathed, puffs of air lightly tickling the back of his neck, Harry realized that he had never felt so content, so at
The sound of Harry's fist against Malfoy's face resonated through the silence of the eighth year Gryffindor boys' dormitory, his head tilted painfully to the side. Harry inwardly cringed at the sickening
"Good morning," he greeted, piling food in his plate. Ron and Hermione gaped at him. As far as his friends were concerned, Harry was never this cheerful early in the morning, if their bamboozled expressions were anything to go by. Harry didn't mind, for the first time, the knowing look they shared and dug in his breakfast.
"It's the bloody potion," Harry mumbled, mind going blissfully fuzzy on the edges. He wanted to sleep. And maybe he can, with Draco's heavenly arms around him.
"Er," Harry interrupted. "If you plan to do whatever nauseating things that lovers do please not in front of me, thank you."
Ginny gawked at him, shocked at the pure anger that was displayed on Harry's face. "Harry, w-what?—"
, on the other hand, does the opposite, of course, tranquilize the emotions of the
Draco saw him in his most vulnerable, which Harry didn't normally blazoned on to anybody else, even to his most closest, much less to his past schoolboy rival. Harry supposed he should be scared; should feel raw and exposed. Malfoy would probably use this to tear him down even more, insult and taunt him.
Speaking of, Harry paused to determine the aftertaste of his
But Harry did, he looked at Draco because Draco was a pleasant sight, soft blond hair dancing in the wind and beautiful blush flushing his cheeks and nose.
"Will you start collecting the ingredients or keep on staring at me the whole time?"
"Malfoy," Harry said, wincing upon hearing his voice sounding harsh. Malfoy seemed to pick up on this and tensed. With a much softer voice that he could muster, he repeated, "Malfoy. Look at me."
Malfoy's hand touch the blood gushing out of his broken nose, softly wincing at the feel of the clammy crimson red against his pale fingers. It was a fierce and unexpected blow, judging by the stunned look on Malfoy's face. He stared up at Harry, round grey eyes glinting against the firelight. His already pallor face had considerably paled—Draco looked like a broken doll, porcelain and delicate and bloodied, with traces of fear starting to surface from the shock and bewilderment. Harry's anger, frustratingly so, evaporated, leaving him with nothing but shame.
Through the buzzing in his ear, he can hear the loud and shrilly sounds of metals colliding with each other and glasses falling to the floor but he didn't care. Harry gripped Malfoy's hand and pulled him up to his feet. "If you have nothing else to say Headmaster, we will excuse ourselves out."
Harry supposed it's right. While the Malfoys, or mostly, if not all, the Death Eaters came from multi-generational families that practiced the Dark Arts, it was very unlikely that all the convicted Death Eaters turned up dead with closely identical causes in a short span of time. Harry had seen the inner workings of and interminable corruption in the Ministry; he himself had been demonized and subjected to unfair treatment by the British Wizarding government through the years just for the sake of keeping up their untarnished reputation. Harry wouldn't put it past the Ministry to forgo protocols and went as far as to eradicate the Death Eaters for a self-proclaimed justice, even those who already had a life sentence in Azkaban. There was a startling influx of deaths since the post-war trials, fifteen or so Death Eaters were found dead in their cells by natural causes and those who were allegedly in hiding, like the Yaxleys and Notts, have their bodies thrown in rivers and banks and were later on recovered by the Aurors after an anonymous tip. Lucius' death definitely wasn't an isolated case just like what the Daily Prophet wanted to fool the masses with. Harry can't believe Shackelbolt let this went on for months.
Draco snarled at Ginny, the hurt and anger in his face were apparent. Before he could do anything though, Harry curled up closer to the blond to ground both of them.
"I wonder who's fault is that," Harry said sotto voce but Snape heard this somehow, glaring down at Harry and taking five points off Gryffindor. Harry's scowled deepened.
Harry morosely stared at Ron, "it's hard though. I couldn't give her what she wanted."
Draco's knees were pulled to his chest as he drank what smelt like hot chocolate from his cup before placing it down the coffee table. He looked up and offered Harry a small smile.
Harry Potter, the Gryffindor Golden Boy, the Chosen One, the Savior of the Wizarding World, the bloody privileged Boy-Who-Lived-Twice. Draco could just basically list a hundred and so things on why he hated Potter's guts but it would not be cathartic, because Potter himself is the reason why Draco planted the seeds of resentment and had grown into a very nasty tree bearing cynical fruits.
"Oh. I forgot to mention, forgive me for my ephemeral memory," Draco said primly and simpered. Harry was horribly reminded of Umbridge and her deliberately condescending giggles in fifth year. "We're going to my father's obsequy."
"Don't you know the concept of gentleness, Draco?" Potter said, with a touch of tease.
Harry stared at Draco with obvious fondness and amusement as the blond went on his rant. His heart was thumping loudly against his chest, and there was a bubbling feeling of delightful yearning deep in his gut at every twitch in Draco's cute expression. Harry wasn't much of a dunce to not realize that he was very much taken to Draco, desperately so, and if he were being honest, for years now. It was amazing that an occurrence as ordinary as Draco frustratingly talking about his embarrassment could bring this repressed realities on the surface, but then again, there is nothing that Draco do that can be considered ordinary to Harry's eyes.
And more importantly, why was Harry staring?
Harry swallowed before he replied, "no, it's fine. I'll be down."
Harry hadn’t seen the day would come that he would cry his guts out before his once arch rival.
Gulping a fortifying air, Harry felt like being pulled out of the waves of emotions, can vaguely sense the softness of silk under him and the dip of his bed beside him which Draco had occupied. The fog around his eyes clearing, belatedly realizing they were tears. He had no recollections of getting inside the Gryffindor dorm room, probably led by Draco. But Harry was thankful Draco managed to get his friends off his back, proving they tended to be tenacious regarding his welfare.
Harry frowned. He blearily opened one eye, bolting out of his bed as he saw Malfoy looming over him by his bedside.
So why is Harry suddenly being a prick when Malfoy learned to grow out of his snooty little self and mature?
So i just wanted to append what i felt for Dumbledore and his 'deliberate' neglect of Harry's mental welfare and condoning child abuse. Suffice to say, Dumbledore isn't really my favorite character in the series. I made him live because I wanted Harry to shout all of it to his face lol
The first time he awoke, the world was still dark, if the little moonlight that managed to seep through his gauzy bed hangings is any indication. His eyes were gritty and he was too sleep-addled to find his wand and cast a
"Oh shut up, Ronald!" Hermione rolled his eyes. "You wouldn't really fail or embarrass yourself if you'll learn, for once in your life, to open your notes beforehand."
Harry's face was hot, fisting his robes and wanted nothing than to destroy Snape's pinched face. It was not their fucking fault. It had been the Slimy Potions Professor's own sadistic and irrational choices that had them drinking the potions and recording their experiences on a bloody charmed paper!
"Thought you could just sway me with your absurd Gryffindor sappiness, Potter?" Draco said acerbically, glaring at the picnic that was laid by the Great Lake, under one of the trees. "You don't expect me to just sit there like a lowlife peasant now, do you?"
"It's okay, Gin. I understand," Harry smiled at her, and for the first time he felt no strain on his face. "It would've been really nice to continue, if it weren't for the circumstances. But we needed that to grow up; and to realize we need to let go of each other."
"You don't know what you're talking about,
There was a drive in Harry, brought on by the mediating potion, to please Draco and to satisfy him. But the weirdest part is that it didn't felt like it was forced. Harry totally enjoyed calming Draco down, to touch his hands, to cling to him. He didn't felt like a slave to the helpless urge; but rather, the helpless urge seemed like a subconscious commitment.
Harry barely held back a gasp at the very familiar picture of Malfoy—
“You’re not selfish, Harry,” Draco said softly, but firmly. Harry stared up at him, the intense viridian eyes that only looked at him with incense and disgust before were now filled with an extraordinary display of grief and open yearning. “I understand what you feel. It’s not your fault that circumstances and people taught you that emotions are a sign of weakness. You’ve had it worst, Harry. Please stop beating yourself up.”
“Harry?” Draco called in the empty room. He pushed open the door to the en suite and found it empty. “Where the fuck are you!” Draco exclaimed as he paced by Harry’s bed, watching the unclosed lid of his trunk and the clutter of knickknacks surrounding it.
Harry trudged his way across the hallways of the castle. It was Saturday noon, and the weekly friendly Quidditch match between the sixth and seventh years had just finished. Harry was too frazzled and sleepless to give a rat's arse about Quidditch, and his usual enthusiasm for the Wizarding sport had significantly depleted after the war.
“I can help you with that,” Draco said impulsively. He tensed, wondering if the poignant air had gotten into and messed with his head. Harry stared at him flatly. Draco cleared his throat. “I’ll help you sleep.”
They all grinned at that, cutting through the serious air around them. Hermione looked at Ron with a proud smile, eyes still glistening with tears.
"Yeah? But the Death Eaters had been able to enter, hadn't they?" Harry knew it wasn't the right thing to say as Draco's face closed off once more. He successfully untangled his hand from Harry's.
“Gotta admit, we both weren’t.”
"I was so tired yesterday that I forgot to finish my Herbology essay due Thursday," she huffed in annoyance. They made their way out of the Common Room. "I was supposed to finish it up but then I was caught up with—"
"Well, when Luna forced me to read the first book, I was automatically stolen by the woeful, poetic git," Harry chuckled, thinking about the day right after the war, when Luna had gifted him
Harry, still whirled from the strange morning, couldn't help the pull of sleep. Confused but still utterly tired, he fell back to sleep, unknowingly holding Draco to him closer for warmth.
Draco sat heavily on his bed, exhaling deeply. Pansy stood in front of him, hands on her hips in an imploring manner. He avoided her eyes, though it was a futile attempt. Draco is a master of concealment and subtlety, just like any other Malfoys before him, but there’s nothing he could hide from Pansy. This girl can detect even the tiniest bit of bull shit. No matter how much he loved her long-range intuition and foretelling finesse, it’s annoying some times. He heard her sigh and sat beside him, the mattress dipping under her weight.
"Are you?" Draco turned to him, and the unpleasant churning in his stomach turned to nausea at the look in Draco's eyes. The quicksilver, that Harry always found mesmerizing, turned scathingly cold. "No you're not, Potter. You only say that because of your stupid Gryffindor sensibilities. You hate him, he's a Death Eater. You were glad because he was dead, he deserved it because he was a fucking Death Eater scum."
"You slammed the door," Malfoy said as if Harry
Strangely, Harry does well with the potion-brewing. The process didn't contain much too complex stirring and chopping, unlike some of the potions they had brewed for NEWT's this term so far, but those with complicated steps Harry had done well enough and he didn't fucked up the ingredients, which really surprised him considering his history of potions mishaps. Harry stared at his now slightly shimmering vermillion potion, as what the instructions said. Harry smiled proudly at his work.
“Have you ever so much as breathe near his cock? No? Because he’s gay, babe,” she chuckled as Ginevra lunged at her. Draco’s left eye twitched.
by the Slytherins too early."
"How many times I told you before you—" Harry abruptly stopped, realising what Draco had said prior. "You're in danger."
Draco pulled his sleeves back, brandishing the
"You can, if that's what it takes to keep you safe."
"Whenever my Galleon heats up when I'm working, I grin."
Harry came up behind him and lined up their bodies and hugged him. His shoulder blades pressed into Harry's chest, refusing to lay flat. It was like trying to hug an armful of wire hangers—everything poked, and nothing forgave. Draco stiffened in his arms but didn't jerk away.
Harry sighed, snapped the clamshell closed. There, work was done. He was badly tired and couldn't afford to be, not with his own vigil ahead. His forehead fell to the space between his knees and he hoped to rest there. It was a fools hope, though, as only a minute later a rush of cool air signalled the opening of the ward's doors as Ron walked through.
"It'll all blow over in another week," he said, and Harry nodded, gave him his best smile, which wasn't even very good anymore.
"Haven't seen her," Luna said. "Though she could be here and Disillusioned, you'd never know."
, we have, Ms Can't-Commit. Aiming for the second of August—gives us some wiggle room to have most of McGonagall's attention before Hogwarts requires all of it. It's going to be tight to get everything together—I've got to get some certifications myself, the summer's going to be crazy but—good. It's all good," he nodded, mind wandering over how what had once been a side project was shaping up to be the thing that gave his life shape and form. Purpose.
"Use me," he panted out, wanting to drop his head and shoulders down so that the angle up to where they were connected would change, would feel amazing, but just then Draco's right hand reached out and took hold of him by a clump of his hair, jerking his head back, and the surprise of it caused him to clench all the little muscles inside around his cock, and Harry could see how that spelt the end of things for Draco.
, at least in the kitchen? Please," he amended, softening his tone. Kreacher gave him an apologetic look but returned his attention quickly to Draco.
Flames burst to life, and he watched as they licked the brick walls inside the fireplace and gradually fell in height until they were barely ankle-high.
"What do you call this pose?" Harry asked the question as Draco checked the knot of the belt, two fingers sliding between the leather and his wrists.
"Like that?" he asked, and Draco nodded fervently, one arm wrapped around Harry's thighs to hold him just so and the other around the top of his shoulders, hand cradling where his skull and neck met. Draco was the holder, and Harry was held, like this, folded into whatever shape he was needed to be.
"I won't make any promises, but I'll try. To have fun," Harry said.
"You can top me in lipstick whenever you want. Or bottom—I'm not picky."
On the other hand, it was clear to anyone with sight that Draco looked downright carnal. The hard planes of his body modelled the white shirt he wore perfectly. On second glance, it revealed itself to be layered mesh, and Harry loved that the tiny pebbles of his nipples were visible, kept hard from the friction with the shirt's fabric. He'd slicked his hair back in a way that was reminiscent of schooldays, though this iteration retained some movement, a lock of it falling into his eye when he wasn't careful. Shined oxfords, a pair of black jeans with rips in them that Harry had balked at the cost when he asked if he'd bought them like that, and a leather belt and jacket completed his look.
Harry wrinkled his nose, let his arm fall off the sofa to his fingertips grazed the carpet, covered in Gillyweed crumbs. Luna had fallen asleep, a soft snore punctuating the conversation. Harry smiled—he was safe here. His lies were taken at face value—he didn't need to protect himself overly much.
"I guess so, yeah," he wiped his hands dry on his jeans. The turmoil inside him had lowered from a boil to a simmer.
. Harry’s heart thudded in his throat.
"Alright, then. Can you take this to my solicitor?"
"Ah," the man shared a handshake with Ron as they approached, "just the gentlemen I was looking for. If you don't mind, Mr Potter—"
“Don't go yet,” Harry said as he pulled away, dropped his hand.
"Charlie," Harry breathed, "what's brought you up here?"
Malfoy’s head rolled on his pillow. He stared glassy-eyed out into the gloom of a storm and was quiet for so long that his next whispered words came as a surprise to Harry.
The word rankled Harry. He forced himself to stare at the Draco before him, the tired, downtrodden avatar of the one he’d known, to temper his response.
"Nonetheless," Draco turned back to the table in time for Ginny to spray her last sip of beer into her hand, providing ample distraction for Neville to conjure her a napkin to sop it up and for Luna to descend into a giggling fit.
“You’ve done all you could,” Hewitt offered.
Draco dragged his fingernail around the rim and Harry widened his legs, hoping for more. A spasm low in his spine led to a dribble of precome, hot and slick from the slit of his cock, quickly smeared around the head by Draco's thumb.
There was that, sure, and then there were the parts everyone and their dog knew—Harry Potter, hero, a young man at the peak of health smiling out from the front cover; Harry Potter, leading the charge, cutting the ribbon, laying the first brick. He had himself convinced that it was all excellent, and the details would come out in the wash. That the life he lived was as good as it got.
"That doesn't sound like you," Harry said.
"Usually, I didn’t like it because I didn’t trust the other person, and they didn’t care. About me. And that's because usually when I'd pull, it was with men who'd take one look at me and see a stand-in for the barely legal twinks in their favourite porn clips, and they'd want to fuck me like it was a porn clip, and it was awful." Draco's fingers trailed aimlessly across Harry's chest, and he settled in closer. Harry arranged the blanket around them as best he could—the window remained open, a chill descending that was so complete that their breaths were clouds of mist. "I’d pretend it was fine, out of laziness or lack of care or loneliness, maybe, and because it was easy." Draco wiped a cheek, and Harry kissed his hair and held that hand, closed it close to his chest. "This isn’t that, though. I knew I’d like it with you. And I did—you have to know I did?"
"He's like that with everyone, trust me," he continued. "I don't think he was home when you came over, anyhow. The Hogwarts kitchens have him half the time, too—"
—you look a fright, and it'll only scare him to see you like this. It'll be hours before he's awake.”
"It's your banter," Harry winked at her, and she laughed, flicking her hand at him. "I'm not falling for that again, trust me," she said, but it held no malice, and Harry was simply glad that she, unlike Luna, didn't seem to have a sixth sense for whether or not he'd recently orgasmed.
Harry nodded, wondering if it was weird that this is the first time he'd really meditated on this fact. Ron collapsed into his seat.
Harry didn’t just want Draco—he needed him, now. Missed him in a way that felt uncontrollable. Would do things he’d never dreamed of—suck him off on a rooftop in Chelsea without a second glance—as long as it kept him touching him and smiling at him and murmuring sweet words to him. Harry hadn’t come, and he stopped tugging to try. He looked up to watch delayed shivers wrack Draco's torso as his head lolled back with the release.
Where George's words had previously sounded sharp, Harry could now tell they were dulled by alcohol. He reeked of it, the whites of his eyes bloodshot pink, reflecting from the light of the stars shining high above.
"Did you fuck him?"
"I assume you prefer Draco to the Ferret?"
“My cock’s getting cold,” Draco gives another push and the man’s mouth goes willingly back to work in his lap.
Draco preened. "I know it's good, isn't it? I thought it up." He sipped his drink, little pink tongue on the short red straw and Harry
"Come now, Potter, everyone knows it. You've got a heart two sizes too big. Doesn't he, Susan?"
Things were good. Great, even. Other than this one, potential, glaring secret, life was practically perfect.
"Flying, that's what I used to do, at least. Before," he sighed heavily, "before it became too much of a hassle to bother trying."
, yes?”
He sat across from Malfoy, careful to leave enough space that neither could lunge and throw a punch that would land. After a few calming breaths, he mirrored Malfoy's position and closed his hand to end the spell's hold.
Draco's words were final, and Harry was quickly trundled off to bed. Draco stayed behind, casting a
“Maybe.”
Luna dropped the feather to stare dreamily at him. "He told all of Ravenclaw so in fourth year, but nobody believed him other than me.” She smiled wickedly. “
, if you don't stop it with that look," he squeezed Harry’s hand for emphasis. "But you seem—normal. Like, if you're a man's-man now, you were a boy's-boy then."
something was wrong."
Harry took the jacket from the hanger and shrugged it on. It was not unlike one he already owned, though the details were shinier and oversized. Flashy, more of Draco's style than his own. He really was being more of a stick in the mud than he meant to be, and if he was honest with himself, a drink would go a long way to dampen his simmering temper. Draco had met him in the middle on several things, allowing him to wear his preferred black Nikes and altering a pair of moderately distressed jeans and a t-shirt to pair with them. That he found Harry sexy in an outfit so simple felt revealing, but Harry knew better than to voice this opinion out loud.
," Malfoy slapped the tabletop, his voice rising dangerously, "I don't need you going in for me to the Minister of fucking Magic, alright? This is some fucking game of tit-for-tat that I didn't agree to play. Just—stop, with me. How many ways do I have to tell you to leave me alone?"
Harry cleaned his glasses with his shirt's hem, which really only pushed the streaks around in new directions. "We do. Humans do. It's—well it's tiring, but it's better we do it sometimes than never at all, right?"
"Yeah," Harry sighed, pushing his glasses up from where'd they fallen near the tip of his nose. He needed a new pair—if only there was enough time in the day.
"Excuse me?"
"Oh, it's Potter now is it—"
"You should be scared," Harry said, "and yeah, I'm upset. But I should be. The public likes a foil, Draco. They're going to paint you as a villain, and they're going to be cruel. It's gross, what I can get away with because it's true—to them I'm Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived," he gestured wildly before realizing that he was far too loud and animated for the pavement, gathering stares from passersby, but he couldn't give a care. "I'm their golden hero, and anything less than that standard makes me a monstrosity. They'll turn on me soon enough too. I'm an idea. The only reason anyone is even about to give two shits about you for the next media cycle is because of me, and it’s vapid, and it's disgusting, but that’s my life, and I didn’t
Harry retreats back into his closet, the mark of his palm stamped in blood on the floor. The metal drags and clunks with each heavy step of heels down the stairs. Draco’s smile must be heinous, but he nudges a finger towards the door to signal Harry that it’s time to close it from the show.
"Not yet."
"Someone's chipper today," Draco intoned from behind a wall of printed paper when Harry descended into the dining room for breakfast. For the first time in three weeks neither Harry nor Draco blinked out from any portion of the front page, whose cover instead had the dread headline about an Azkaban prisoner up for release that month, convicted of Muggle child-killings twenty years previous.
into the air above them. "How much time do you have left, then?"
Harry gestured over his shoulder as he pressed a hand to her back and guided her towards the stairs. "Er, dressing, or, um, something."
It wasn’t anger, really. It was the loss of control over things that couldn’t be managed. There was more, there was always
