Draco’s resistance was wearing. He had imbibed too much firewhiskey, to be sure, but he held fast, gripping his glass of firewhiskey hard enough to break. It trembled in his hand, the ice clinking, as Blaise tongued his neck.
Draco looked around and no one was paying them any mind. He’d been sitting there for all of two minutes, and they were mostly hidden from view. He watched Blaise limp away and it filled him with immense sadness.
To his horror, Draco felt his eyes prickling. He didn’t know why he had suddenly become this tearful old maid over night, but he couldn’t help it. Harry was making him feel things he had suppressed for most of his life. He turned his face away.
Harry moans as he works the plug out. Purple dye drips between his cheeks and down his balls. He dabs the stuff up with a handkerchief in his pocket and spreads a little numbing cream around his hole. He doesn't want to heal it completely. Harry needs to feel this. He moves his hand away to watch his cheeks come back together.
“I’ve got to get to the office. I have a load of paperwork to get through to transfer those werewolves to Azkaban.”
“Drake, come on. Don’t give me that face. Listen, I’m sorry things aren’t working out between you and Potter, but it’s probably for the best. I hate that he’s making you feel this way. It’s not right…You’re gonna get hurt, badly, and I’m worried about you. You’re too far gone for him to see clearly. Rumors about him stopped for a while, but they started up again this week. He’s fucking around on you.”
He, too, was close though his cock hadn’t been touched yet. It was trapped between their stomachs. Draco was surprised to sense his orgasm rising up in him at the sound of Harry’s sweet words.
He was a mess. He could not help feeling miserable. He had brought the entirety of the day’s events upon himself. He deserved to be left alone and abandoned, by everyone in his life. They deserved better than a wretch like him.
When they retire for bed, Draco is too worn down to do anything except sit on the edge of the bed in his briefs and stare out through his balcony. Harry kneels in front of him, dressed only in his boxers. There’s a short black chain around his neck that he’s never worn before. The links are large, and it looks like something one would wear to a BDSM club. Draco touches the cold metal.
Draco’s heart constricted in sadness. It was starting. Harry was pulling away from him, getting ready to leave him. He deserved this, but he couldn’t allow that to happen. He got up quickly to go to Harry’s office and knocked softly before entering.
Blaise pulled him forward by his shirt to stop close in front of him, but he didn’t move closer to kiss him, though Draco expected him to. He just said,
Draco took a deep breath. He never talked about this with anyone, and now he was forced to discuss it with the blasted Savior, of all people.
Still, he pretended, and Scorpius started to get desperate, waving his arms frantically. Finally, he rushed forward and clutched Draco around his legs. Draco towered over him at 6’1.
He used his wand to tie Blaise’s wrists together behind his naked back with conjured thick black rope.
Blaise wasn’t allowed to to make the first move when it came to sex. That was at the core of their relationship. It was Draco’s job to initiate contact. Blaise leans out of his touch reflexively and backs away with a startled laugh.
“Shhh, it’s okay. Listen, what can I do? Tell me.” Draco wanted this to stop as soon as possible. He was in agony.
Draco turns on his back and starts to jerk off, the same way he’s done in the shower for the last week. Harry rolls over to face him. For a second, Draco thinks he’s gotten lucky. Then he gets down off the bed and heads to the closet.
Draco really did not want to go, but he needed to see him. He felt vulnerable and weak. He also needed to end this quickly, before it was definitely traced back to him. He sent back just one word: “Okay.”
“The contract with Blaise…” Draco raises his eyebrows and Harry thinks he knows what it means, but he doesn’t want to get his hopes up. “Did you? You didn’t.”
Paris turned out to be a wonderful idea. Draco took to him to an extravagant dinner Friday evening and made love to him sweetly in front of floor-to-ceiling windows displaying the Eiffel tower. He took his time, bringing him to orgasm four times over the course of a few hours. Wanting to remind Harry that they were more than just Master and slave.
He needs to get in close because Draco can't move. He puts his face right in front of his—and Draco blinks. Twice. His mouth bends as his gaze lifts a little…almost holding Harry’s but not quite.
“Astoria, don’t. Listen to me, carefully. You have made a terrible mistake, but you are still the mother of my child. I will not simply kick you out and throw you into Azkaban. You will be provided a comfortable living outside the manor. I have already prepared the beach cottage, for your arrival, tonight. I am looking at a house, not far from the manor, that will be suitable to accommodate you. You can fix it up, however you like. You’ll have as many house elves as you need. You will still be provided a handsome living to sustain yourself, as well as provide for Scorpius, when he is not at the manor. We will split time with him, equally.”
On the other hand, Draco felt a possessive ownership over Blaise and always imagined him on standby, waiting for Draco to fuck him the way he needs to be fucked. That would no longer be true if Blaise got married. His wife would take precedence over Draco.
He worked in his office all day, pouring over all his financial statement to see if he, himself, could find something.
and Harry broke the kiss to quickly unbutton Draco’s shirt, kissing each part of newly exposed skin. He could have simply vanished their clothing but he knew Harry loved disrobing him, by hand. He treated every part of Draco’s newly exposed naked body with tenderness. He tore his own shirt off, and pressed Draco flat against his silk green comforter, lying flush with his body, kissing him until Draco's head swam. Their naked chests touching, while kissing passionately, was a dizzying sensation for Draco. They were both hard already, and Draco could feel Harry’s erection rub against his through their pants.
Suddenly, Harry tensed behind him, and came with a howl, pumping, long afterwards, to milk every last drop, inside him.
Draco knew he was lying, but he relished the feeling of the words on his tongue and wished to all the gods they were true. Harry looked incredibly hurt by his cruel words, but his voice was angry.
The minute he walked through the door to the dark dungeon, he closed his eyes in blessed relief to focus on the sounds. There was soft French music playing in the background. The loudest sound was a scream of severe pain following the harsh crack of a leather whip. Beyond that, Draco heard the groans and grunts of many different patrons who were no doubt being reamed by a hard cock or fucking someone, in turn. He heard occasional screams of ecstasy and the sound of flesh slapping flesh.
Harry managed to convince Draco to come with him to a seaside city called Izmir and told him to wear a bathing suit.
Draco was not blind, of course. He could acknowledged that Harry was a very handsome man. This was just a fact. He was universally attractive and his savior status only added to his mystique. Everything about
Draco cast a quick glamour on himself before heading to the bathroom. Walking quickly, but not running, he went straight into the toilet and promptly vomited all of his stomach contents, including mainly, Blaise’s cum.
“Listen Drake, it’s none of my business, but Harry is making a right spectacle of you. His love of birds is running rampant in the rumor mills. I’m honestly a little surprised you’re allowing it.”
When Draco got closer to the table to greet him, he heard Blaise speaking to him in Italian. His voice was a smooth baritone. Draco always told him it was the sexiest sound he ever heard.
And then he slapped him hard across his face five times with an open palm. He did this in quick succession with his cock still buried in his mouth. He continued at a brutal pace, grasping Draco with two hands by the back of his head, now.
Harry burst into relieved tears, and they soaked his cheeks and mingled with his sweat. Draco drank in his body, his expression, as Harry’s hips jerked and his shoulders shook with the force of his climax. Long moaning sounds were forced from his lungs, proving without a doubt that he indeed had no control left, no fight, no will. When it was done, Harry collapsed back into the pillows, his arm flat beside his head. He was a lovely puddle, spent and panting, drenched with sweat and cum, moaning softly.
Draco was on a rampage. As he stormed back to the Auror offices, people flew out of his way. His rage was palpable. It crackled in the air. The lamps in the office flickered wildly when he walked by. He went in his office and slammed the door shut stewing behind his desk with his head buried in his hands.
He wandlessly lubed his cock and breached his entrance, carefully. Harry was still very tight, but his preparation with his fingers earlier and the fact that Draco had so recently fucked him,
Neech grasped his hand and Draco felt elf magic pass through it. When he released it, Draco’s hand was fully healed.
“He said he had a wonderful time with David, but…he won’t break it. I’m going to have to hurt him, Harry.”
Harry was not talking, but something was definitely wrong. It was not often that Harry kept his feelings hidden from him. He was usually an open book. It was one of Draco’s favorite qualities about him, as he, himself, operated so covertly in his life, always hiding behind a mask. He scrambled for something to say, wanting to wipe the sad look off his face. His lover should never leave his presence, looking like this. It meant Draco had failed in some way.
He wondered if this is how Blaise felt with him. It felt awful being on the other side and filled him with great sadness. He thought he saw a flash of Blaise's hair through the curtain opening, but when he pulled it back to check, no one was there. He must have imagined it, thinking of him. He closed the curtain shut, more securely.
“Please! Draco, please, Draco, please…” Draco’s eyes squeeze shut. A tear slips out. “Draco, you gotta look at me! I love you.” At that, his eyelids flutter.
Grinning like a cat-that-caught-the-canary, Draco strokes his hair softly and turns to leave. At the door, he pauses and turns.
“No, sir…please, forgive me, I didn’t see you. I only live to please you. I’m only a slut for you.” his voice cracks at the end and he hangs his head low. It’s enough for Draco to concede.
He was powerless to resist and returned the kiss before pulling away to catch his breath. Harry moved to his neck, and Draco leaned his head into his shoulder, clutching his cloaked back, intending to pull him away, but he just ended up
Calling him 'baby' again was something he could not help. It was liberating, and Draco felt himself get closer to another orgasm. Now that he had already said it, it no longer felt strange. It was freeing and so sexy. It was like pouring gasoline on a fire.
“You’re quiet. I always get worried when your quiet. What’s going on in that head of yours? I could never tell.”
His hair was styled to look haphazardly perfect and he smelled like the expensive cologne he always wore. Blaise always smelled good enough to eat.
Harry blushed. Well, this was interesting. He and Ginny were in fact, not separated. Harry lied to him.
Still, Draco knew that was never enough to curb Harry’s lust for him. He felt Harry pulling away from him and hardly knew what to do. His racing thoughts put him on edge. He felt like the anvil would drop on his head, any day now. Harry was getting ready to leave him. He felt it in his bones. In addition to denying him sex, Harry was completely acting out, intentionally being a terrible boyfriend in the hopes that it would lure Draco’s Dom to the surface.
Without warning, he slapped his ass extremely hard, hard enough to leave a hand print in red with the first blow. Blaise rocked forward into the cushion.
Blaise took the subtle hint and quickly began to undo his belt, unbuckle his trousers, and shove them down along with his tight boxer briefs. Draco’s cock sprang forth obscenely from his boxers, slapping his stomach loudly before pointing straight at Blaise’s mouth.
I could do for you while you were in there. No power, no influence, none of it mattered…” Harry splays his hand out on his nape, shifting Draco so he can see his face. “Why did you do that, Draco?”
Draco empathized, completely. When he was married to Astoria, the stark contrast between her body and Blaise’s body, only made him miss his presence more. He didn’t know what to say. He could not forbid him to go there as he was no longer his Dominant. He was no longer anyone’s Dominant. The thought saddened him.
“I accept. Of course, I accept. Draco, I…I care so much for you. I’ll never ask you to take it off.”
“You really don’t get it, do you? I want you with me, only me, all the time. Did my insane act of jealousy not prove that to you?”
He hung on his every word and chuckled at all his lame jokes. Draco often wondered if they took a piss in the loo together. He was always touching Harry any chance he got, and Harry never seemed to mind. It grated his nerves.
He opened his eyes and moved to look at Harry’s face. It look deranged, as he moved in and out. His eyes were black. Harry’s magic felt unstable.
“I’ve known her my whole life, Drake. We’ve dated on and off for years. Besides, I thought you’d be happy about this. Isn’t this what you always wanted? You’ve been badgering me about marrying Pansy, since we left school.”
“That’s not important. He means nothing to me, but you mean the world to me. I can’t lose you, darling.”
He went up the stairs to call it a night, though it was only 9pm. The silence in the manor felt oppressive. He went into his walk-in closet to get changed and conducted his nightly ritual of running his fingers along Harry’s clothes. He still had not picked them up. Draco breathed in his head auror uniform and was assaulted with his oaky scent. Memories plundered his mind and he closed his eyes against them, but they played like a movie, in his head.
He had to wait. The next portkey to England was not for another hour. He sighed as he thought back to the previous night. He crossed his legs to stave off an erection and decided to sharpen his French by reading the local newspaper. He needed something to take his mind off those haunting visions. Going to
In the bedroom, it was pleasurable enough, but in life, it could never work. He would always meet him toe-to-toe on everything, and this would just disintegrate into more fights which, essentially, would lead to another grizzly ending.
He waits for Harry to say it’s not true. To say he loves him. To say that he would never have to live without him. That’s what he said. He said that he loved him.
He paused, hesitating to continue, but when he saw how angry Draco was getting, which was his desired effect, he decided to push it further. An angry Draco usually meant an incredible fuck.
He has to stay away then. No matter how tempted he is to check on him. He takes a portkey back to England feeling just a little more human. He’s still fucking pissed off. That he kissed her, mostly. More than anything, he can’t snuff out the jealousy. That wound gets ripped open when he gets back to London, stopping in Diagon Alley for coffee. He hears some girls talking in the line in front of him about “The Savior” being “fuck goals.”
Harry looked shell shocked. He wasn’t moving or speaking. He looked like someone who had just witnessed a horrific trauma and was going to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder for the rest of his life. Draco had to lead him to his chair so that he could sit down.
Draco and Scorpius took to their boards immediately, dodging people effectively, and laughing the whole way. The wind swept through their hair and Draco felt free, almost as if he were flying. Though Draco was getting along in years, he kept in shape and easily kept up with Scorpius.
Harry drew him closer so they were flush against each other and reached around to stroke Draco’s cock before speaking.
Draco took his time. He sent himself on an extended tour of Harry’s ass, traveling from tailbone to balls and back again use his tongue and lube slicked fingers. He slipped the tip of one finger into Harry and listened to him gasp, felt a shudder roll through his body, and bit lightly at one cheek.
Draco blushed with shame over his accuracy. How many times had he used some variation of these same words? Now, the roles were reversed and he could not help the wave of humiliation that passed through him. That was overshadowed, however, by Harry’s thick cock rubbing against against him. He answered by thrusting backwards and spreading his legs.
and quickly disarmed the guards without making any noise. Draco used his tried and true gagging charm on all 4 of them. Harry raised his eyebrows at that and shot him a suspicious look, then restrained them with the
Draco tries to answer him. That’s how he ends up choking on a mouthful of his own blood. Harry pushes his hand back into his hair, draws it back because it’s warm and sticky. A wave of helpless fury fills him as he turns back to see who the perpetrator was—so much so that he doesn’t look back down until Draco’s eyes are closing.
naked chest to naked chest. Draco felt himself getting hard, but remembered the dull throbbing in his backside. When Harry moved to palm his hardening cock through his joggers, he pulled away.
“Hey, you’ll never hear me complaining about getting fucked multiple times a day.” He hopes to get a small smile out of Draco, but his face is like stone.
that. He could remove him from any case, even from his job, as he had Shacklebolt’s support in everything he did.
Draco thought on this for a moment. Harry never dared to engage him at the gym before. What made him start today? Not wanting to back down from a challenge, Draco stopped the stairmaster and hopped off.
His kryptonite was the ultimate reason he had to leave London. Every time Harry got near him, Draco turned into a weak damsel with watery eyes and a soft heart. His proximity always guaranteed a hard cock as well, but his cock was his own man, with his own preferences. They did not match up to what was healthy for Draco.
Looking down into his pleading eyes, Draco wanted to tell him no. He wanted to punish him, and he was angry at himself for starting Dom/sub play. He was afraid Harry was losing himself in the fantasy and was compartmentalizing this part of himself from his true life. That meant that Draco was being compartmentalized too. Once he was no longer needed, he would be discarded. It wouldn’t be a real loss because he kept his real life as the family man, protected.
Draco stood and walked closer to the fire, his back to Blaise as he swirled his firewhiskey in the glass. He saw Harry’s face in his mind again, his defiant look, strong and muscular, dripping with sweat.
They managed to slow it down, eventually, and gave him blood replenishing potions. They told Draco the clawed skin would never heal completely. He would bear the scars forever.
Draco was reaming into Blaise, lost to a different world. His whole chest was flushed an angry red, dripping with sweat. His hair clung to his head, wet, from physical exertion. He was lost in dom space. He had an animalistic look on his sweaty face that he was ashamed to see, one of pure sexual rapture.
He stroked him from behind and Draco moaned. It was always harder for him to control his noise in the morning.
He had no idea what he would be walking into today, and this made him incredibly nervous. Maybe Harry would work to avoid him all day, in light of his hard cock pressing against his thigh at the gym, and that was something he could live with.
“You didn’t seem to mind when it was you causing the pain. Stay still! I’m going to fuck you again.”
Draco’s rage boiled over. It made him think of Astoria, who was no longer with him. He was itching to punch him, but he tried to think of something to say to hurt him and soothe his rage.
He pumps the toy inside him so he feels the need to lift his hips, to arch his back and try to bring it deeper.
Blood was the slippery thing that prevented his grip. It stained his hands. Harry’s ass was bleeding from painful welts. Draco looked up to see his back was also bleeding from long angry welts that crisscrossed against Harry’s barely healed werewolf marks that scratched down his back.
Not bloody likely, as long as Harry was around to torture him, endlessly. Draco just glared in return. He couldn’t understand Harry’s motives, and didn’t care to.
“Wait, Draco. Please just listen to me…You drive me mental. You’re just...so fucking sexy and I want you so badly, all the time. I feel myself losing it. I’ve never felt anything like this. Can you really blame me for being upset that you’re spending your evening with another man? One you just fucked, who happens to be in love with you?”
Harry allowed a soft smile, but it wasn’t enough. Draco could still sense a sadness in him. He dropped to his knees, locking eyes with him, and kissed the head of his cock, tenderly, as if it were the most precious thing on earth. He licked around the head and Harry moaned. He quickly put a hand over his mouth to stifle the sound.
He smiles as he hears Harry calling him his “handsome prince” in his mind. He makes a split second decision to surprise him at Grimmauld Place, donning a black cloak and disappearing into the floo.
He paused in his stride. Draco waited for him continue, but Harry stayed silent. It appeared he was waiting for Godot.
As he crossed his arms, staring at the fire, waiting for his body to move, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He shucked it off and walked a few feet away, turning his back to Draco. Then he felt a hand on his calf. He turned around, shocked to see Draco kneeling before him.
“Idea for building a prison outside of Azkaban, without dementors. The idea you’ve been trying to push through this entire year...it’s finally on the agenda.”
He gripped Blaise’s ass roughly and squeezed hard, lifting him up on his toes, to bring him closer to Draco’s taller frame. Blaise moaned, erotically, into his dizzying kisses, holding tight to Draco’s back, sliding his hands up, to the back of his neck. He had one leg wrapped around Draco’s hip and their bodies were flush against each other.
And then where would he be? Sunk further into a hopeless vault of even more memories of calloused hands and pillowy lips, to be haunted for all of eternity, utterly destroyed. He would never find his way out. It was as if he would be stuck inside the deepest vault of Gringott’s, plunged into darkness, with no hope of escape.
A howler started smoking on the table. Draco was in shock. He could not do anything but watch the envelope smoke, until it burst opened.
Another wave of his wand kicked up the intensity yet another notch. Harry blew his second load of cum all over his stomach, shivering. After a few minutes, he was still half hard.
He felt a searing betrayal when he saw him. It should not have mattered that he had taken another lover, when it came to big life changes such as getting married. Blaise was his best man at his wedding, and now he could not even get an invitation to a stupid proposal party. They were suppose to be best friends, through thick and thin, no matter what.
He was, however, angry enough, by the news, to immediately owl his attorney to start the proceedings for a divorce.
Harry’s face fell slightly at this, which confused Draco, as well as pissed him off. Then, he finally walked out and left Draco in peace, closing the door behind him with one last regretful glance over his shoulder.
He tried to wriggle out of his grasp and Harry gasped, looking down. Draco followed his gaze. To his horror, Draco was fully erect underneath him.
And then he was in the tub with warm bath water. Harry was bathing him with a soft washcloth, like he often did. Draco got lost in his eyes.
Draco readied to leave quickly, and he strode determinidly out of the door, not waiting for Harry to follow.
He could sense that Scorpius wanted to throw a temper tantrum, but Draco had been teaching him how to control his emotions since infancy.
With Harry acting out, denying him sex for a few weeks, however, his dominant side reemerged and crushed him with its heavy presence. It felt stronger than ever before, having been denied a submissive for so long. Now it had grown into an ungainly beast, as if punishing Draco for being ignored, these many months.
It was late morning when Harry waltzed towards his open office door, holding a case file. The office was bustling with people. He started up his brash, rude, tone before he got to Draco’s door, speaking loudly,
“Is he giving you something I’m not? You can tell me. I want this to be good for you, better than anything you’ve ever had…you can tie me up, if you want to. I’m not opposed to the idea.”
Sensing no right answer, Draco stays silent and kisses his back, causing Harry to shiver. He wouldn’t know what to say, in any case. He could mean that he lost in his attempt to stave off his orgasm. He could mean that he thought he was losing him to Blaise. In either case, words would be useless, so he holds him close, praying for sleep to come.
He thought of ways to get Blaise to want to break the contract. He remembered his words when he caught him in his closet and insisted he find a responsible dominant.
Suddenly, Harry ended up on top and slammed him to the ground. He bored into his eyes. His robes were clenched in his fists. They were both breathing harshly from the fight. Draco tried to wriggle away at first, but felt Harry’s erection digging into his thigh and stopped. They both looked down and realized they were both fully erect, then locked eyes again.
“Listen Drake, I know you’re upset, but I’m sick of hiding. I don’t care about the stupid pureblood rules the way you do. I just want to live my life. I can’t be perfect the way you want me to be and I’m sorry for that, but I can’t live a lie anymore.”
Draco sighed deeply. He had no idea how much he missed this side of himself until this very moment. He finally opened his eyes, but it made little difference. The dungeon was mostly dark at the entrance, but the sounds permeated his soul. He could see shadows moving at the far edges of the rooms and knew there were multiple passages that led to more secluded rooms for a more private experience. All these rooms were free to be observed or participated in by any patron who was both lucky and rich enough to gain entrance.
What was he suppose to say now? His brain was so sluggish. He was so randy and barely awake. It was 5:30 in the morning. Then, he remembered.
Harry flips them over, and Draco bends his legs back automatically, his knees almost to his head, ready and willing. It makes Harry break out into a sweat of anticipation.
He should have told him the thing he did for him, that Blaise is certainly going to break the contract now. But he doesn’t know what he wants anymore. Their problems go way beyond the contract. They drive each other mental. Harry’s turned him into a miserable wreck the last few months. He feels unhinged, and he’s driven Harry to the brink, in turn. He wonders if it was the Dom/sub play that ruined them the way he always thought it would. It could be. The reasons don’t matter, the results do. They’re just…not good for each other. Not healthy. Too much emotion. He loves him, but it’s not enough.
He flipped them over so that he was on top and kissed his neck in turn before moving down his chest slowly. Harry watched him through hooded eyes.
Five minutes go by and Harry rubs his erect cock on Draco’s thigh and starts stroking him. His hole is already stretched and slick with lube from a preparation charm he cast on himself while he was waiting.
Harry jolts awake and slides off the desk. His pants are still undone so his ass meets the cold ground and causes him to wince. He quickly pulls his pants up and tries to stand up, but to no avail. He collapses back to the ground, hearing a chuckle. Draco is crouched besides him, immaculately dressed, not a hair out of place, as if he didn’t just fuck Harry’s brains out.
He knew instinctively that this wouldn’t be enough. He didn’t blame him. He was a good Dom, probably amongst the best, and Blaise always put him on a pedestal for that. He felt pride, and it sickened him. Draco worked tirelessly, over many years to be the perfect Dom for him. Carefully discovering his limits together. Pushing him to the very edge. Freeing him. He never hurt him. Never breaking skin because he wasn’t that kind of Dom. His pleasure was the only thing at the forefront of Draco’s mind when they were in a scene. He knew all of Blaise’s favorite things. Degradation, rope play, spankings, the kangaroo flogger, his deepest fantasies.
They were bowing and simpering to Harry, offering to cook him whatever his heart desired. When Harry insisted on cooking himself, they started to panic.
“No, no, I ca…I can’t…sir, Master, I,” Harry babbled at him, “Oh fucking hell, Master, I…Yellow! Yellow, fuck!” He sobbed out and choked on a gasp, coughing.
“Harry, I was congratulating him on the engagement. I haven’t been with Blaise at all since I promised you I wouldn’t at Grimmauld. I swear.”
Draco’s tears had stopped and he trembled at the sound of Harry’s voice. He hated when he sounded like that, with that flat facial expression to match. It felt like he was trying to reach him across a great void.
He felt his face flush and his heart took off into a sprint. Suddenly, he had become an ickle first year girl who had just spotted her schoolgirl crush. He crossed his arms sullenly and looked away, hating himself. Blaise noticed but attributed it to being caught in an intimate position.
Draco was in heaven. This was exactly what he needed, fresh fantasy material. He imagined it was he that was reaming the smaller man, chained to the table. How he longed to be the cause of those rattling chains.
Instead, he put it away from his mind as he quickly dressed for work, and Harry did the same. He hoped there were not too many reporters waiting for them, in the atrium. Reporters had full access to the ministry atrium, but not the different floors. He remembered when the picture of Harry, shoving a cloaked figure against the wall, caused four or five reporters to be waiting for Harry’s arrival in the lobby, for a few days. They eventually gave up.
As he ate a lovely meal of Chilean seabass and green beans, Scorpius prattled on about his week at the cottage, swinging his chicken tenders around as he talked. Apparently, he was still friends with Albus Potter, and begged Astoria to allow him to come visit at the beach house, this upcoming weekend. Astoria, not wanting to upset her soon-to-be-ex-husband, always declined.
By the time they left the DMLE, the sun had fallen. Only intending to stop by for a few hours, they ended up putting in a full day of work and Draco was exhausted, once more. He stopped at the floo to go home, but Harry directed him outside to the emergency exit instead. He insisted Draco walk him to his motorcycle which had been there since the morning before. Draco put up his cloak hood and obliged.
He began thrusting in earnest at a steady pace, hammering his prostate, looking straight into Harry’s eyes. Watching his face as passion flitted across it, and hearing loud moans escape his pink lips, Draco was forced to realize something.
Draco was frustrated; the connection they had while fucking on his yacht all day seemed to disappear as Harry became speechless and uncomfortable.
But his hand was trapped by a body, a body that was currently snuggled into his right side. He caught sight of the black hair that was tickling his neck.
“Gods.” Draco groans, and his pink cock is already dripping onto his stomach in anticipation. Draco likes this, and Harry knows just how to fuck him. He was going to give it to him so good, and Draco was going to love it. Taking in his reaction, he can’t help teasing him a bit more.
this morning, maybe he did love Blaise in return, at least a little bit. Maybe, he was just too stupid to realize it.
“You’re in a lovely mode today. Listen, I caught a break on that illegal potions case a few weeks back, the ones that were showing up at Hogwarts?” Draco perked up.
Draco's sharp inhale came out as a gasp. Images assaulted his mind. He couldn’t count how many times had he imagined Harry bent over, sometimes tied up, taking it from Draco while he pounded him from behind, finally putting him in his place. He felt his cock harden to fullness underneath his towel.
Draco pounced. He curled along Harry’s side, one hand immediately massaging Harry’s cock as he he thrust his tongue into Harry’s mouth in a deep, claiming kiss. He growled for effect and rubbed himself shamelessly on Harry’s leg.
“Do you think you deserve my punishment? Why? So you could pour it inside a pensive and show Harry?”
Draco sighs deeply. He couldn’t put this off forever, and he’d be damned if he let this tear them apart.
“Bend over and rest your hands on your shins. Spread your legs. Wider. No, that’s too much. Yes, perfect. Beautiful pet. This one’s called 'Affirmation.'
“Blaise, wait—“ Draco gets up to walk over to him, but gets hit with a curse that makes him fly back ten feet and land hard on the wooden floor.
Pippy had the foresight to bring two firewhiskeys and set them on the table in the parlor before disapparating.
He chanced a quick look down, past his moppy black head and saw that Harry was stroking his own cock as he sucked him. His other hand was stroking the base of Draco’s cock to make up for what he couldn’t put in his mouth.
It wasn’t that Draco didn’t care for Blaise. He did, very deeply, but perhaps not in the same way that Blaise cared for him. The man knew Draco was married and that this should be nothing more than a friendly poke in the night, or in the morning, as was the case now.
“I can’t do that. What will the pureblood circles say, what will Scorpius’ friends say, when they find out his father is a shirt-lifer who likes taking it up the ass? It’s not a good look.”
He felt unhinged and unstable, taking it all out on Blaise. He felt like he was unravelling at the seams, and it was all because of Harry.
He knew it was inadequate, but he simply did not know what to say. What could he say? I loved nearly every second your cock was inside me and need more? I think I’m falling for you, too? It was all too ridiculous to say in his head, let alone on paper.
Harry sucked his cock with increased skill and precision, pressing down on the underside of cock with his tongue, and back up to lap around the head of his cock. He sucked rapidly and massaged his balls at the same time. His blowjob skills had significantly improved since the start of their relationship. After only a few minutes, Draco felt his orgasm upon him and grabbed Harry’s hair to warn him, but he ignored it and increased his sucks until Draco groaned through his orgasm, cumming right in his mouth. Harry gave his balls a light squeeze to milk him completely.
“Look at me carefully, pet. I have a shameful past, and I know it’s hardened me. I’m not the easiest to get along with. I’m broody and ill-tempered.
He went back to his chair, feeling as if Harry had drained him of all sense, along with all his cum. He could not help a small smile, however, as he resumed his work.
After he tucked Scorpius in, he told Astoria that he had to go into the office for an emergency case, and he would’t be home until late that night. She simply nodded, eyes downcast.
“Shut up, Potter. I’m in no mood for you today. Let’s just get this over with.” He grabbed his cloak.
He snapped his fingers and turned invisible, then undid the locking charms and waltzed out of the door.
“Are you seeing anyone these days?” Draco ventured, yet again. At this, Blaise forcefully detached himself from Draco, and began to look for his boxer briefs.
Pushing him roughly to sit down on his green velvet couch in the parlor, he casts a few healing charms on his eyebrow watching the red gash vanish, leaving only dried blood behind. He uses a wetted clean handkerchief with the Malfoy insignia to wipe it away.
“Ah, stings…” Harry told Draco after the first few blows. His words sounded a bit strained. He grunted with each stroke after that, and his fingers tightened around the handles. He managed the silence well enough for a few measured blows, but it must have gotten to him finally because he broke it himself,
He floos into the ministry, trembling. While walking towards the lifts, the security gaurd stops him.
Harry sinks down to the fluffy rug besides the couch again and leans his head against Draco’s leg. “It’s exhausting, all the drop-bys.”
It was a pensive memory of the Wednesday night he had tied Blaise down onto the bed in eight places and fucked him, with abandon, virtually all night.
Draco moves to the bathroom to wash up. When he returns, Harry’s in the same position he left him in, stretched out on his stomach. He crawls on the bed, moving slowly because he’s still so hard. He stretches out next to him on his side, looking at his face for a second before brushing damp hair off his forehead, revealing his lightening shaped scar.
The couch started making scratching sounds on the floor as it was pushed forward minutely with each of Harry’s hard thrusts. His balls were slapping against his ass at the same time. The sound was music to his ears. This was the playlist to their relationship.
He spent the day with Scorpius and felt rejuvenated when Monday rolled around. He hoped Harry would not cause any scenes at work, demanding an explanation, or demanding to be fucked. He was always one for dramatics. He considered trying to avoid him, but realized, quickly, he didn’t have to.
It’s so hard to get a good one. He pushes his lungs out, sucks in air. He’s still breathing like that when he finally apparates back to the manor. He lands in the foyer and the first thing he thinks is,
Draco rolled his eyes, not that Harry could see as he hadn’t even looked at him. He wanted to scream at him, or Harry to scream. Anything but this. He was frustrated for listening to Hermione. Here was the proof that Harry couldn’t be bothered with him anymore.
Harry braces his arms high on the mattress behind Draco’s pulled back knees and guides his cock inside. He’s still so tight, and Harry grits his teeth as he enters his scorching heat to maintain control. He works into him slowly at first, but he’s turned himself on so much with all his dirty words that he starts reaming into him shortly after. Watching his face carefully for pain, Draco looks like he’s flung off into a different planet. His eyes are squeezed shut.
high tight pink nipples erect from exposure to the cool air. Draco hardened more when he was reminded that Harry spent every morning using grooming spells to rid the hair from his entire body.
Looking up in the mirror, he hardly recognized himself. His cheeks were flushed from the shower or from his orgasm, he couldn’t tell. His eyes were a little bloodshot but twinkled blue from the morning sky light streaming in from the tiny bathroom window. His hair hung wet around him. He looked 10 years younger than he usually looked. He moved closer to the mirror to inspect the stranger and noticed numerous love bites on his neck. He touched them softly. They felt like a bruise.
He dragged Harry up the stairs, after the sun set, and promptly removed all his clothes. Harry was mostly unresponsive, just watching Draco through hooded eyes.
As it is, Draco would not be able to do that with Harry, even if he wanted to. There was no room to roll. There was hardly room to breathe. He carefully broke from his embrace, thankful that Harry didn’t wake, though he clutched the sheets where his body had been.
Draco mopes around his house all day, drinking. He’s dreading the moment Harry walks through the floo and has to tell him that he’s failed, yet again. He thinks about his conversation with Blaise and feels a deep remorse over how badly things went. He practically almost kissed the man, driven by pure lust, and he’s so sick about it. He remembers what Blaise told him when he found out about his affair with Harry.
He leaves the manor and apparates to the street outside his house. It’s a drizzly day out. If Harry doesn’t want to see him, then his wards won’t let him through. They do.
Draco stops, lulling him into a false sense of security, then standing back to deliver the sharpest blow yet, he brings the whip down with maximum strength right across his ass.
of him. If it was a good enough death for the greatest wizard he’d ever known, then it was good enough for him. Scorpius had his mother; he’d be fine. He had no friends to miss him or parents to mourn him. It would be so easy…
Harry lay boneless on top of him. He was keening with the effort to draw breath and shivering. Draco pet his hair and used his wand to clean the bathwater and fill the tub with warm water again.
Harry leaned back in his chair, as if exhausted, and clutched his forehead with his fingers. He let out a large gust of air.
“Blimey, no wonder you’re so fucked up, Draco. There’s nothing wrong with liking men. That’s how you were made. It’s not, exactly, something a person can help.”
Draco’s face turned from twinkling eyes and mirth to his default face of stone once more, as Harry strolled in like he owned the place and put the reports on his desk.
He was worried this would alter the dynamic between he and Harry, and that was the last thing he wanted. It was not the best relationship one could hope for between colleagues, but had been working fine, thus far. He did not want things to become awkward, uncomfortable, or (more) unbearable.
He shoved Harry’s hip and grabbed at the nearest leg as Harry rolled, smoothly hooking it over his own shoulder.
Draco felt Harry’s ass moving around his cock, rocking backwards to communicate that he wanted him to move. Draco forced his legs apart further, to get in deeper, still, and started thrusting.
The shock of sunlight isn’t enough to stop his hips from thrusting. Blind with rage and lust, he drives into him even harder, slapping his flesh with his thighs, grunting like an animal, as if he’s truly trying to hurt him, which he is. He holds onto his shoulders hard enough bruise and continues to deliver hard punishing thrusts until the heat of climax surges inside of his body and he’s roaring through his orgasm.
Neech’s eyes fill with tears as he takes in the state of his master. Unshaven, blonde stringy hair matted from being unwashed. Draco doesn’t know exactly how he looks because he avoids the mirror. He’s afraid of what he’ll see in his eyes. He can guess, as it’s reflected in Neech’s face. Neech sheds a tear and disapparates with a loud crack. He thinks, absentmindedly, how powerful elf magic is, that Neech can pop in and out of France with a snap of his fingers, while wizards are forced to travel long distances by international portkey.
He undoes his pants and pulls his hard cock out, licking the shaft hungrily. Then deepthroats him while pushing on the plug at the same time. Harry absolutely loses it. He’s gripping the sidearms of his chair hard when Draco pulls out his wand and reactivates the plug to full intensity, swallowing him down to the hilt. Harry blows into his mouth with a harsh cry and he swallows the little cum he has left.
“Look at me,” Draco commanded. Harry looked up, and for the first time, Draco couldn’t read his face. It was blank.
Draco startled. Blaise had managed to squeeze his way between the numerous tables in front of them, without him noticing. It was hard to startle Draco.
When Harry walks in, he isn’t looking at the metal harness on the bed. There is an intimidating looking apparatus that Draco has conjured in the living space of the bedroom. All his furniture is pushed to the side. It’s triangular. The top of the triangle is made of a long thin red leather bench, about eight inches wide. On the sides of the triangle were two additions that looked like long padded shelves. There are metal rings attached all around. Harry suddenly feels fearful alone in the room with the thing, but he tries to take his mind off it by disrobing. He needs the harness on before Draco returns. Unfortunately he doesn’t have the faintest clue how to put it on. It’s all black leather straps. Didn’t this thing have an instruction manual? A picture would’ve helped.
Harry released his cock and grabbed his hips to really drive into him now. Right before the end, he whispered another “my dragon” and came with a loud shout, pushing deeper and closer, somehow,
“I just started a few weeks ago, and I’d be lost without him, literally. There’s over a hundred passageways down there.” He chuckled as did Blaise.
Though Harry kept adamantly refusing, they were aggressively bustled to the front of the line, and one of the cafe employees magically conjured a small table for two, just for him.
“She knows about me, Drake. We have an honest and open relationship. That’s why I’m marrying her. I’m free to fuck which ever man I prefer, as long as I use the protective spells. She’s great. We use toys in the bedroom to suit my needs…”
“Please Harry. Don’t walk out on me. Do you remember when you told me I’m the first thing you could ever remember wanting? I feel the same way about you. I just didn’t know it, until right now. It was just a mistake, a stupid mistake. I just wanted to be honest with you. That has to count for something...Please, forgive me.”
“What is this Potter? Do you want to have a heart-to-heart? We’re just fucking. It’s a nice way to relieve the tension. Don’t ruin it.”
He comes downstairs to him sitting in the parlor, staring at the fire with a glass of firewhiskey in his hand. He looks painfully somber but smiles softly when he catches sight of Draco.
Draco immediately rushed him and tackled him to the ground, screaming in rage. He punched his chest multiple times, as hard as he could, but it wasn’t enough to cause any damage. It was like punching steel. Harry allowed this for a moment then flipped them over, pinning his hands to the ground.
If he wasn’t careful, he’d coddle Harry, and everything would be lost, wasted. He suddenly felt a strong urge to take the collar off right now, but he knew how disappointed Harry would be. He needed to play this out, for him.
oozed sexual power. His body, his face, his voice, the way he moved, striding about with inflated confidence that was well-deserved. Even his hands were attractive, thick tanned fingers, covered with callouses.
“I do,” Draco admitted. “I’m a sad shell of a man, Harry. This is what you’ve done to me. Beaten me at my own game. I’m afraid I can’t do without you any longer. I want you to move in, permanently and sign a contract, if you’d like.”
He chooses now, to follow Draco’s advice and get married? When his hands were tied to Harry’s, and he couldn’t do anything to reassure him that this could continue through his marriage to Pansy.
Harry buried his fingers in Draco’s hair and guided him gently, to increase the pace. Draco obliged, deep throating him with every gulp and his moans became loader.
Harry clutched his face in his hands and Draco allowed himself to be kissed, softly. The minute Harry’s pillowy lips brushed his, Draco felt something release inside himself that had been under lock and key, something that was bursting to break free and was taking a lot of effort to keep contained.
Draco put his mouth very close to his neck, close enough for Blaise to feel the heat of his breath, but millimeters away from lips touching skin.
He used the ropes at the base of the bed to tie his legs down in four places. Two around each ankle to the corner poster, insuring he couldn’t break his position, and two others around his thighs to the back pole to stabilize him so he wouldn’t slide up. He magicked the pole downwards, to both tighten the ropes and give him easy access. The move thrust his ass high. It was half hanging off the bed now, his cock flopped out and hung below, over the edge of the bed.
Harry seemed to understand and got into position. He rubbed his cock teasingly across his hole for a few long moments, then suddenly, flipped Draco around so that he lay on his back, facing him, again. He lay on top of him, caressing his cheek with one hand and kissing him.
Draco peeked outside his door to see who had arrived, ever so paranoid. No one besides the main secretary was there, far from Draco’s office and outside his direct line of vision. Draco pulled Blaise into his office roughly by his tie and shut the door behind him, wandlessly throwing up silencing and locking charms.
Harry looked down at the table, saddened by this answer. He knew what Draco’s ‘we’ll see’ really meant.
Blaise smiled widely, falling in step with Draco as they walked to the food court. He whispered besides him.
Harry turned the shower back on and quickly washed, his face first, wincing when he reached behind to wash the inside of his ass. He turned the shower off and reached for a towel, quickly drying and stepping out of the shower.
They would get close to a town or a park and transform themselves, wreaking havoc, infecting as many people as possible to swell their numbers. No one had died yet, but several people were bitten. They were a threat to
It took a few thrusts for Harry to get all the way in and he paused, the same way Draco did for his first time. Draco heard him muttering some nonsense under his breath about quidditch stats, but he focused on his breathing. He remembered that breathing through this always made it easier. After a while, he rocked gently to indicate he was ready for more.
He rode the horse fast through the Malfoy grounds, far around the property which spanned several miles. Finally, he felt his mind clear. A sense of freedom washed over him as the cool evening air whipped against his face.
A tear falls towards his temple. Draco strokes his hair back. “It’s okay. You’re gonna be okay. I’m right here with you.” Harry’s eyes squeeze shut. Another tear streaks down his fever-flushed cheek.
That’s enough. This would never happen again, unless he was the one doing the degrading. That was a position he didn’t mind as much.
It turned out their potential situation in Islington was a very dangerous hostage situation. Two kids, under the age of ten were trapped inside a house.
“Yeah, that’s it Draco. This thing between us has run its course.” Harry says it like the notion is absurd. “I just asked to move into the manor, but it’s over now.”
Draco could not believe Harry’s libido, but could not find it in himself to complain. This would be Harry’s fifth orgasm today.
Draco was heading towards his orgasm quickly now. Blaise would definitely feel this all next week as Draco sped up his hard punishing deep thrusts.
The music room was at the opposite end of the house from the ballroom. He had thought they would be safe as he had thrown up silence and locking charms. He was all over Blaise that night, kissing him senseless, gripping his ass tightly while tonguing his neck before sinking down to his knees to suck him off. It was messy and scorching hot. He needed inside him and felt an almost painful desperation to hear Blaise scream his name. Draco swallowed him whole before roughly bending him over the piano to claim him, as much a reminder of to whom he really belonged to, as a punishment for his endless flirtations.
"The Malfoy grounds have a pool. Over the summer break during our Hogwarts days, Blaise and I used to see how long we could...kiss underwater.”
“Do you have any idea how sexy you are?” He whispered in his ear and licked his neck, ending with a sucking kiss. Draco felt his heart beat pick up instantly and relished the firm grip covering his ass. Harry’s large hands were his favorite body part, besides his cock.
Then Draco’s in the shower, and his chest is such a den of agony, he wonders if a healer would notice him scream.
His hand came down again and again. Draco was working his hand all over his bottom, even in the crease at the top of his thighs when it really stung. Harry kicked reflexively as Draco swatted him on a particularly tender spot. When the tenth swat had been administered, he relaxed over Draco’s knee, thankful it was over.
He didn’t respond at first. He was paralyzed with shock, but pleasure thrummed through him at the contact and he began to responded after a minute, tentatively. Then Harry thrust his tongue inside to deepen the kiss and alarm bells went off in his mind.
He thinks to go in the men’s room—but he doesn’t stop. He goes right through the atrium which is empty. He has a flashback of Harry guiding him through the barrage of cameras when their affair first hit the papers. He feels his strong hand guiding him by his elbow through the crowd, and his throat closes. After the thing he’s done, he hopes he isn’t too late.
It appeared Harry was losing patience, even though his tone was calm. He sounded intimidating and could indeed overcome Draco. Yet, he knew they were empty threats. Harry would never really hurt him.
Powerless to the the sound of begging, he allowed Harry to remove his pajama bottoms and he promptly took Draco into his mouth.
Draco’s mind cleared at that for a moment as he stilled, dizzy from the firewhiskey and the sensation around his cock,
After breakfast, Draco and Scorpius spent the morning horseback riding. He was riding Prince while Scorpius chose his unicorn, as always. When they got to the edge of his property, they paused, looking down at the valley below.
“No one more honest than a drunk man, and I declare you the most beautiful man in England! Inside and out. No one holds a candle to you Harry…I don’t deserve you,” he finished sadly.
Harry leaned forward to kiss him, swirling his tongue in his mouth as if Draco were a delicious sausage that needed tasting.
“Mmm, that feels good. Will you, at least, meet me at Grimmauld during our lunch break? I…I need you to fuck me again, Draco. I miss it.”
Draco was beyond tired, but he couldn’t sleep. Everything Harry had said and done with him for the past five days was a lie. It was artificial, synthetically produced by raging hormones, as a side effect of a poison.
He was met with livid storm grey eyes when he turned around. Though he smiled internally, he gave him a wide eyed surprised look, like a deer caught in the headlights.
After they bought lunch, they took their usual table that sat in an alcove, mostly hidden from view, so they could speak more freely.
To reach the floo, he quickly took the lifts down to the atrium. Blaise was talking merrily to some coworkers by the coffee cart. He looked different somehow, rejuvenated. Harry always took sick satisfaction in seeing Blaise moping around the ministry and he resented him looking happy now. He knew how heartbroken he was. Felt it, keenly. Just imagining himself in Blaise’s position made him break out into a sweat of panic. He heart would beat wildly out of his chest. He could already see it happening to him. As he wondered what could have brought on this new jolly continence, Blaise gave him a secret smile and winked. An inferno exploded in his chest. He wanted to knock his teeth out. Too many witnesses. Instead, he wandlessly and nonverbally cast a stinging hex his way. Blaise jolted enough to spill his coffee on his coworker.
Draco didn’t know why it was important to correct him, but he did, and he knew it was a mistake the minute the word left his mouth. It revealed too much.
“When that collar is around your neck, you should never look straight into my eyes and will always address me as sir.”
Hot tears spill down Harry’s cheeks, but Draco just pulls him closer…and closer, so he’s choking. As Harry’s eyes leak, he blows him. He does it because he can’t not. This is why he has a mouth. This is what his body is made for.
He got up quickly to join him. He opened the glass door and stepped into the shower behind him, kissing his back, embracing him from behind.
He felt a soapy wash cloth rubbing down his back, and he realized Harry was bathing him. He took his time too, starting at his upper back, down his arms, his ass. He heard him kneel behind him to get to his
Harry turns slowly and finds both child healers standing by the head of his bed with these proud smiles—because his eyes are just a little open.
He jumped at the sound of Draco’s voice. A smooth commanding drawl, one he’d never heard. Blood rushed to his cock instantly. Draco was hidden in a corner, cast in shadow. He hadn’t noticed him, at first. He was still fully dressed in professional clothing. Black trousers and a fitted black button down. The moonlight caught his platinum hair and pale skin, making him look like a seductive vampire.
Draco pushed Blaise to lie flat on his stomach, providing a better angle to thrust deeper. He reared up on his haunches to pull his cheeks apart and ream him into the sheets below.
“Then what is it? Harry, I want you to be happy in this. Otherwise, what’s the point? How can I fix it if you won’t tell me what’s wrong?”
He got up to walk to Astoria’s room and slid in bed next to her, turning his back to her. Astoria sensed him and began to rub his back soothingly. She knew something was very wrong, now, but also knew better than to ask. She hugged Draco from behind, curling up behind him so that he could feel her body heat. It was a comforting gesture, not intended to be sexual. Draco counted his blessings. At least, he would always have Astoria.
He stroked the top of the towel with his finger gently, feeling Blaise’s erection pushing up, but avoided touching his skin. Swiping his cheek against Blaise’s toweled cock briefly, he inhaled his scent deeply, but didn’t move to undo the towel. He missed the feeling of that warm organ heavy on his cheek. He could feel it through the fabric.
He gave his cock a tentative stroke, then released, watching it bounce. He looked up at Draco as if he were about to be chastised, but Draco refused to meet his gaze, choosing instead to look at the curtain, straight ahead.
“I know you’ve got a beater’s bat dick,” Draco says. “I should get down off the bed and walk around so I can suck it. “
“That ugly brute!? You have to be joking Astoria. He isn’t even good looking. He has as much intelligence as a rock. You let him put his prick in you? The man is a quidditch player. Who knows how many women he beds when he’s on the road? And he barely has two galleons to rub together. I heard he spends all his quidditch money betting on games.”
Dinner was quiet. Scorpius seemed to be able to sense tension at the table and did not prattle on, as he usually did.
Draco’s anger was surging inside him, not just at the interruption or Harry’s presumptuous question, but because the man before him had ruined Draco, forever, mind, body, and soul. He hated him for every good memory that haunted him, awake, or dreaming.
Luckily, the Malfoys have a long history with the best breeders in London and managed to acquire a special unicorn, specifically for Scorpius to ride. Though unicorns did not trust men, in general, he had acquired this particular one for Scorpius as a baby at the same time Scorpius was just a baby, himself. They practically grew up together.
Astoria’s sobs reached him, all the way downstairs, as he floo’d away, suitcase in hand. The sound pierced and shattered his soul.
Draco stared at the kneeling figure, considering. He wanted to please him, he said. Could it be possible that Draco could shape him into the perfect submissive? The result would be having the savior of the Wizarding World, himself, on his knees, with a snap of his fingers. He cock began to harden again, just thinking about it.
Draco drew in a breath to brace himself against those pleading eyes as they began to fill with tears.
Right before lunch, a few days later, Blaise finally entered his conscious thoughts. Draco had been avidly avoiding him all week and was surprised Blaise had not burst through his office door, demanding an explanation. He worked through lunch, every day. He even skived off their weekly Wednesday night drinks, in lieu of emergency family matters, believable enough, since he was going to have to tell Blaise about the divorce, soon.
Fearful that Harry would stop if he reacted too eagerly, he didn’t move a muscle. Harry could reject him the minute he turned around. He had before. It was possible that this was yet another way to tease him with what he had lost. His hand crept forward to Draco’s front where his cock was already fully erect.
“If you hadn’t found him…merlin knows what would’ve happened.” Draco continues to look at the ground.
He thinks of how he hurt Draco in front of his kids after telling them that he planned to marry him. He thinks of their brutal sex in the stables, feeling like he was truly mounted by a stallion instead of a man, feeling Draco’s pain with each thrust. Thinks of his heart shattering in the bath tub and pleading on his knees on the balcony at sunset.
Draco shook his head, and he was horrified that even more tears started to fall at the sound of Harry’s pet name for him. Harry should be hexing his balls off before kicking him out. Instead, he was comforting Draco.
Harry looked up at him. Draco couldn’t surmise his expression. He wasn’t angry. It was more like resigned sadness. He shrugged his shoulders, in response, and continued writing.
He though of Freud, the wizard psychologist who pretended to be a muggle, to conduct his studies on them. Witches and wizards, certainly, would not be viable candidates for his experiments.
He was ramming into him hard, once more. Deep, fast, punishing thrusts were delivered with force. The sound of flesh slapping flesh filled the room, as Harry grunted on top of him, dripping sweat all over his back.
It’s not a metaphorical one like with Harry, it’s a physical acute pain, like someone’s taking a dagger to his insides. Blaise chants the words in latin louder. His voice is stronger. The tear lengthens more, but it does so slowly, as if the parchment is resisting. All the while, it feels like a muggle surgeon is carefully cutting out one of his ventricles. Draco starts sweating from the pain, clutching his chest, rolling on the ground like he’s having a heart attack. He’s gasping for air, until finally, the parchment rips in two and just like that, Draco’s heart is three chambers, instead of four. He feels for his pulse, and he's surprised it’s still there. There’s a deep ache inside, like a bruise he thinks will never heal.
He was still a child, 8 years old next month, and did throw an occasional tantrum, but mostly in front of his mother. Rarely, in front of Draco, who would ask,
Draco looked down and only then, realized his cock was fully erect. How was it possible he still had morning wood after being fucked so thoroughly?
“That’s right. I remember now. Not easy to forget the most terrifying time of your life, out on the run as a fugitive with absolutely no blasted idea of what you’re doing, or if you’re going to live the next second. Hundreds died every day at the hands of your lord, and I remember listening to their names, feeling responsible…What a comfort it is to know that while I was doing all that, you were sticking your prick inside Blaise in the lush dorm rooms of Hogwarts. Tell me, was he calling you master then? Did you tell him it was for life? Or was there a conflict of interest, as you had your own master to serve?”
Harry could tell his heat and conversation were straining him more. He left the office quickly, closing it softly behind him.
He could not help feeling pity for the Italian man, who had not only been his submissive, but his best friend for two decades. Now, they were nothing. It was as if Blaise had died, but he was forced to see his sad ghost everywhere. Draco’s anger towards him in the beginning clouded these feelings, and he never had a chance to properly grieve him and move on. It still wasn't enough, however, to let him back into his life, in any capacity.
“It’s okay baby, I’m right here. Take a deep breath…That’s good. Nothing can break us. I’ll love you forever. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”
“I like the way that sounds, you know. God, you’re beautiful.” Inside Harry, Draco’s cock twitched, wanting more.
“No, listen. Anyone would be lucky to be with him. If I wasn’t an idiot who was madly in love with a complete prat, I’d give it a real chance. That was only our first date. I was just trying to make you jealous. I’m sorry.”
Harry usually hated this kind of attention. He just wanted to be treated like a normal bloke, which is one of the reasons he only partnered with Draco. Apparently, things were changing.
This particular gift had cost Draco a very pretty penny, close to 50,000 galleons. He was feeling uncommonly guilty after fucking Harry a second time, and woke up,  very early this morning, to go to the Wizarding Bizarre in Turkey to pick it up for her.
It suddenly occurred to him that perhaps this contract was the reason Blaise crept up into his fantasies and dreams constantly. He imagined his love for Harry in the beginning eclipsed everything, but when Harry pulled away from him, it left him open. He vaguely remembered some clause in the magic portion of the contract. The Dom would be alerted if his sub was truly suffering, emotionally, from neglect or otherwise. It would certainly explain his pity for the man after his unforgivable betrayal.
Draco groaned. Harry sat back, watching him with his classic lustful gaze, while he slowly unbuckled his belt, and unbuttoned his trousers.
Draco was shocked, dismayed, even. He knew Blaise was gay, despite claiming to be bisexual. He could not remember the last time Blaise told him he had sex with a woman. His previous dates never amounted to anything in the bedroom.
Looking down, he realized they were both completely naked leaving little doubt as to what occurred the night before. He felt Harry’s morning wood pressing into his side.
It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in London as Draco and Scorpius took to the park. It was crowded more than usual due to the beautiful weather but had a designated skateboard area and a path leading up to it. Most people were set up on the grass or on the benches enjoying the day with their families.
Casting a weightless charm on Harry, he magics his restraints sway, sweeping him up in his arms and taking him to the bedroom. Harry is still gasping for air, soaked in sweat,
Draco knew this violated the core of every dominant/submissive relationship. Sex could never be used a form of punishment in this dynamic. The whippings, spankings, and roughness are meant only to heighten the pleasure of the submissive. There needed to be trust, love, and safe words.
“I barely felt it. Your whippings felt like scratches on my body. I began to worry, but figured it was a side effect of my increased power. I pretended to be in pain because I knew that’s what you wanted. If I felt real pain, I would’ve vanished the ropes, immediately. It was a full moon that night. The poison was at its strongest.”
Harry used his left hand to intertwine their fingers together as Draco moved over him and met his gaze steadily. He used right hand to stroke his own cock. Draco placed a soft kiss on his lips before burying his head in his neck and picking up speed. He started pounding into him harder now.
Harry was leaning against the wall at an angle, breathing hard, as if he would collapse at any moment. Draco hugged him, in support. After a few moments, Harry finally spoke.
“And it’s none of my business. I’m just telling you that Harry probably doesn’t feel it’s right to come to you. All I’m asking for is a conversation.”
The main part of the bath was a ceramic steam room, but it had many passages leading to different areas and it was somehow open to the outside. Draco plopped down on his towel, leaned his head back and closed his eyes.
Ignoring it, he cast a cleaning charm on himself and Blaise, adding a healing charm to Blaise’s hole, for good measure. Then he used his wand to vanquish the ropes and the metal pole.
, just the sight of his messy dark locks and piercing jade colored eyes behind those stupid spectacles made Draco’s blood boil with rage.
“I’m going to get us both a coffee down in the atrium,” Blaise said, as he stood up quickly, righting his clothes and dusting his knees.
Draco just stared at him. Words were coming out of his mouth, but he was having a tough time processing them. Thoughts of the
“Okay Draco.” Harry’s glazed eyes find his. “What do you want to hear? You were a dick. But it didn’t piss me off today. It fucking scared me.”
He buried his face in his crotch inhaling deeply. The masculine smell was stronger with his arousal and Draco couldn’t get enough. it was an aphrodisiac to him. He quickly removed his pajama bottoms and Harry’s cock sprung forth, fully hard.
His brow scrunches a little, and the look is so Draco. He looks like a living human. Harry feels a rush of shock as tears start streaming down his cheeks. Draco’s eyes move just a little. Like he’s looking over his shoulder. Harry’s stomach slow-rolls.
Draco ignored him the rest of the day, but that was okay. He was to spend the night at Malfoy Manor.
He leaned forward to kiss him, but Draco turned his head away, blushing at his sensual tone. He saw Harry smiling in his periphery. He felt him place soft sucking kisses on his neck, instead, moving upwards towards his ear. When he sucked his earlobe, Draco shivered and his arms fell to his sides. Harry whispered in his ear.
He pulled him closer to the water for a rinse, rubbing his hands all over his lower body, finally resting on his cock. Still on his knees, he turned around to shut the water off. Thick steam billowed around them.
Draco was so thankful that he didn’t press him on the reasons for staying at his house. Such was the trust, love, and respect between a twenty year friendship. He could not believe that he even considered casting Blaise aside, for a hot fuck with S
Draco sat at his desk with his his fingers over his eyes all morning and a lightening clap headache. The shades were down, plunging his office into complete darkness, but it only marginally helped. All that crying in the morning must have set off a migraine, something Draco hadn’t experienced since the war. He was cursing himself for bringing up contracts. He got so overexcited at the prospect of Harry being his submissive, that he’d forgotten to keep a calm facade and his mouth shut.
Draco groaned. Blaise was unconscionably tight around his cock, even though they had fucked continuously for 3 days just this past weekend.
Draco rocked minutely back and forth, to milk Harry’s every last drop. Harry’s abs trembled with little aftershocks.
As it is, Draco had to behave. He was tempted, with Harry being so far away and not having been a top for many months, but he was not tempted enough to be unfaithful. He was however  grateful to Gabriel who, in the past, had informed Draco of an underground gay BDSM club in Paris. Draco pretended to be offended by the information, back then, while still married to Astoria, but he always visited the club on the rare weekends he was in France.
Draco tipped him off his lap onto the floor, before pulling Harry up to sit on his knees, his sore bottom hanging safely off his thigh. He wrapped his arms around him.
“Oh god. Please, sir. I can’t take it anymore. I have to cum. I'm sorry. Please, please, please.” he sobs out, then continues with something he promised himself he wouldn’t say.
Draco would make sure to keep his distance, and if Blaise propositioned him, he would have to be honest and immovable.
Draco waits at manor, pacing. He curses himself for not thinking to go with him to the DMLE, but he’s never seen that look in his eyes before, like a helpless bird caught in the clutches of an eagle. It makes him sick with worry. He’s craving a glass of firewhiskey but pours himself a ginger ale instead, waiting in the parlor.
He also brings Hermione and Ron around Draco more, and is surprised that Hermione gets along particularly well with Draco. Her eyes sparkle at him like she admires him. Even Ron isn’t averse to him. He learns later that Draco and Hermione have an owl correspondence and somehow became friends during his stay at St. Mungo’s.
“Oh, what do I want? I want you to pay Draco. To pay for everything you’ve put me through for the past fifteen fucking years. Fucking me, whenever it suits you. Forcing me down on my knees to suck your cock, whenever it suits you. Rejecting me, after I gave you everything! And believe me, I’m going to collect every penny…
Draco woke up to the real Harry Potter sucking his cock, under the sheets. He moved the comforter away to get a better view and almost came on sight. His cock was disappearing into Harry’s mouth at a steady pace, and he locked eyes with Harry’s lust-filled gaze.
Harry gripped Draco’s back hard enough to leave nail marks that he would have to heal later. He slammed Draco down hard and released his cum inside with a loud moan, keeping himself fully sheathed.
He stood there very still and frankly, a little afraid. He waited, what seemed like a long time, for Harry to speak or even just to look at him, but he continued to read something on his desk.
Harry rolls his shoulders, only too keen of that feeling. But Draco is the one who doesn’t understand. He thinks Blaise is only happy pleasing a Dom, but the truth is,
“I wish I could say I’m sorry, but it’s been almost a year since I’ve been able to touch you. I can’t keep my hands off you.”
“You know, I saw you from a distance when you first got here. The hair gave you away. You were smiling and laughing. It’s a good look on you, Malfoy. You should try it at work sometime.”
Draco’s cock was painful now. Ripping a hole through his trousers. Harry Potter was willingly in the grace position in his bedroom calling him ‘sir.’ He could hardly keep his voice steady, but it was a necessity. He didn’t want Harry to know his affect on him. He continued in his slow drawl.
He couldn’t get the image of Harry’s face splattered with his cum out of his head. It kept playing on a loop, on repeat in his mind, like a photograph in the Daily Profit.
let’s go.” Scorpius gasped in delighted shock, expecting his father to deny him in favor of work, as he usually did.
Draco vows to not put Harry in the collar for a long time after that night. He’s never seen him react so emotionally after a scene. Knowing it’s mostly about the contract doesn’t sway him. He believes that Harry is not in the right headspace to endure Dom/sub play.
Draco kneeled down in front of him as Blaise undid his trousers to free his cock. He was hard already. The minute Draco got on his knees, he grabbed his hair and pulled painfully. He moved Draco’s head around experimentally to make sure he had complete control, and that Draco did not resist.
It’s Hermione Granger, requesting to come through. This can’t be good. It goes against his better judgement to allow her in, but he does so anyway.
“Soon, baby,” Draco warned, his breath coming faster and beginning to catch as his blood pounded his ears.
Blaise, on the other hand, was avoiding him at all costs. It made him absolutely miserable, but he could hardly blame him. He knew if he just gave it time, he would see reason and start dating a pureblood woman soon. Then, they could start up again, as per usual.
Blaise was already half way out of the door. He practically ran out of the room, closing the door behind him.
Draco fell limp and boneless on top of him. He was in a post orgasmic haze for a few minutes, but then realized that he was suppose to be angry. He detached himself from Harry abruptly, hearing a wince when his cock popped out of his tight hole. He looked at his perfect, pert. round ass, as cum began to dribble out.
“We won’t stay long, but the owner is a friend, and he invited us to the special lounge section of the club. I promised I’d be here. I’m trying to get connected to new Doms. I’d like us to go in and say hello. Can you do that much for me?”
Now they’re kissing hard and fast, and Draco could feel how nervous he is. He keeps pulling off his mouth to gulp for air.
but the room was empty. The bed, however, was in complete disarray. A sheet was dangling, on the side of the bed, in a crunched ball.
It was Draco’s favorite. He began to bellow the lyrics very loudly, making Blaise raise his eyebrows and chuckle.
“The man has completely lost his marbles. Don’t worry, darling. I gave him a stern lecture about it. He did it without even consulting me. Can you believe that? Poor Pansy. She’s been pining after him for ages and this is how he repays her? They should be engaged by now. It’s like he’s forgotten who he is. He’s not some commoner, free to do as he pleases. I was livid when I found out.”
“I…I don’t know. For flirting, I guess. I know it’s a stupid way to get you to do what I want. But you have to believe that it’s not to hurt you. The only time I feel truly alive and yours is when I have the collar on. That’s when I feel like I’ve got you. I know that’s sick, but it’s true. I’m just…scared to lose you, alright? That contract seems like a fail-safe in case things fall through with us.”
When 5pm rolled around, he was completely drained of all energy, but he forced himself to the gym anyway. He needed something to get his mind off this trainwreck of a day.
as he drove into him harder still. The obscene sound of flesh slapping flesh filled the room, accompanied by Blaise’s muffled screams, dampened by Draco’s hand, but still loud enough to be heard clearly.
on the cabin floor, all the wolves had been restrained outside the cabin. He felt his neck to make sure there was no bite and stood up, with Harry’s help.
He held onto his misery from the previous week, how destroyed he was without Harry, haunted by all the memories.
Draco was left standing there, thoroughly rankled now. He grabbed a salad and headed back up the lift to eat in his office, alone.
They both decided to go into work that day, even though it was a Saturday, and dressed accordingly. They were completely behind in all their work as their sexual escapades ate up all their time. When they weren’t having sex, they were thinking about it, which prevented them from working, even while they were apart.
He tried to focus but his mind was jumbled, like white noise. He rubbed his cock across his hole, over and over again. He was unthinking, drunk on pure sensation.
“Not exactly on topic, Harry. What’s gotten into you? You’ve hardly been listening to me. Did something happen downstairs? You’ve been in a strange mood since you brought us lunch.”
be something. If you stay with me, there will be someone out to ruin us. Out to hurt us. Out to hurt you because you’re mine.”
“No robes today, Auror Potter? Your…assets are on display, and so tempting.” he said in his low slow drawl. Harry shivered in response.
“Draco…I heard the good news! I’m here to celebrate with you. I brought your favorite lube, the edible one.
He slowed down his rapid pace and rammed into him, in hard intervals, instead, pulling his hair tight.
Draco takes it from him, holding it up, noticing the Malfoy and Peverell coat of arms engraved inside. “This is perfect. Where did you get these?”
Draco picked up on his message quickly. He grabbed the back of Blaise’s head with both of his hands and set the pace, driving into his wet willing mouth slowly at first and watched his cock disappear into it over and over again. He began to quicken his deep thrusts as his fingers tangled in his beautiful thick black hair.
Smiling, Draco realized they were starting to reflect each other’s thoughts. Sleep was fast upon him as his travel had drained him of all energy. Though he had grown accustomed to bottoming, it still always hit him with a powerful wave of exhaustion, once it was over. He rested his eyes for a moment and quickly fell asleep.
“Fuck.” By now, Draco’s frustrated and his ribs are getting sore. “If you don’t want to, your choice.”
Draco’s heart fluttered. He didn’t know what to think, but he could not help smiling. He knew these weren't Harry's words but he was flattered they made Harry think of him. He took a moment to look down at his hands. They were indeed rough and darker than the rest of his body, both from his work, and going hard at the gym. They were calloused, just like Harry’s.
Harry’s face falls apart for just a second. It’s so fast that afterwards, Draco questions whether it happened. He face twists like he’s going to sob—and then it locks down.
After they ordered, just coffee for Draco, and the classic full English breakfast for Harry, Draco began to fidget restlessly. Harry wasn’t talking, choosing to read his file instead. When the coffee, tea, and toast arrived, he took a sip of tea before saying,
Harry remembers being wheeled down a long hallway. He knew Draco should be with him, but he wasn’t. He kept trying to ask for him, and no one would answer. So he tried to get up and go find him.
Draco let himself be pushed by Neech into the parlor and collapsed in his large brown leather chair. His hand was bleeding copiously, and he did not have the wherewithal to heal it. The cut was very deep. He just watched his hand dripping fat droplets of blood, wondering if he would die if he left it like this, and not finding it in himself to care. The horrors of the last ten minutes washed over him.
Yesterday, it was Shacklebolt. The night before, Mr and Mrs. Weasley. This morning, the aurors had a meeting in his house.
Rolling his eyes, Draco stands and tucks his wet cock inside his trousers, buttoning them quickly. He intends to go back to the manor without waiting for him to catch up. Harry grabs his hand and he’s pulled backwards and around, connecting with his mouth. He gives him a deep sensual kiss and pulls away from Draco, smiling.
He withdrew from Draco and got under the sheets, slamming the comforter over his body, and turned away from him to face the wall, like a petulant child.
He’s sprawled out on his couch like a slob when someone tugs his bottle of firewhiskey from his hand. He looks up to his savior. He looks particularly intimidating this evening in an all-black ensemble, but also sexy as hell. His expression is gentle.
Harry looked simply devastating in a black leather harness and matching collar. Draco wanted to sink to his knees and suck his cock so badly. His control as a Dom was always slipping around Harry. He was out of practice and the man was just too sexy.
He had no idea what to do. He was frankly, alarmed by Blaise’s anger. He expected him to be hurt and upset, surely, but not so cruel.
It set him off knowing he had such an effect on the man below him. The ability to make him lose control was the ultimate trigger. In the past, he always believed the top had all the power, but was, now, fully convinced, that it was the other way around.
Watching Harry from above, Draco felt he had never been more turned on his life. Harry would often look up and lock eyes with him. He grasped his head and thrust forward making him gag, then stroked his hair as if in apology.
A part of him knew he had probably brought this upon himself, but it was a very quiet part. It was easier to blame Harry and Blaise for his state and he swore them both off for eternity, in his mind.
He licked and kissed his hole relentlessly and Harry was not keeping quiet. He tasted musky and delicious. Draco felt like he had imbibed the potion they were investigating. He felt high with lust as he licked and sucked at Harry’s hole with abandon. His hole relaxed enough to thrust the tip of his tongue inside, and Harry’s sounds reached a fever pitch. His hard cock was leaking all over the sheets.
Harry crawled into bed, completely naked, and Draco stayed turned away. at the very edge, gripping the comforter around him, viciously. He was breathing hard from the rage that swelled
This gave him pause. Draco was shocked at the information. He felt a weird, unpleasant sensation pass through his body at this news, but he couldn’t quite place it.
He washed his face in the sink, bracing himself for what was to come. He did not feel any different, but he knew the potion took time to work. Even if it didn’t work, he seriously doubted he would have an issue fucking Blaise tonight. He was reawakening Draco’s dominant side. Draco had not fully entered his dominant role in quite some time, and he found himself looking forward to it.
Harry stares out at the wall in front of them. Swallows. Shuts his eyes. And he says, “I don’t want to tell you.”
Harry tightened his chokehold around Draco, who could hardly breathe, as yet, another orgasm tore out of him. He groaned above him and bit another spot on Draco’s neck, hard enough to draw blood, again.
Draco runs a finger over his defined jaw, down across his nipple and then puts his fingers inside his waist band, rubbing against his lower stomach, gently.
Draco made sure to include ample padding in the bench. He just hoped his magic would hold and the bench wouldn’t suddenly vanish throughout their play. He really needed a play room. That’s what he was going to work on next week.
“I see. You’ve been pursuing me, relentlessly, for months, and now that you finally have me, you don’t want me anymore. Why am I not surprised? Was it all a lie? Or just the last few days?”
He could see Blaise wanted to argue with him, so he reached out to lay a hand on top of his, even though they were in a semi-public place. His eyes softened as he looked at him tenderly. No one was paying attention to them. They were in an alcove tucked away from view.
“Let me do all the work,” he whispers. Draco groans in objection but allows Harry to straddle him anyway.
Draco washed up, dressing in dark burgundy silk pajama bottoms with a matching robe, and headed down to the kitchen to observe the mayhem Harry was undoubtedly causing.
He was very angry that Harry had lied to him about Ginny. It made no sense. He could have easily told him the truth, as Draco was married himself. He had been played for a fool. It was all just a ruse, to get into Draco’s pants. Draco fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. He hated himself.
Draco peeked around to see his face. He had to get close because it was so dark. His lips were clamped shut. He couldn’t see his eyes, but he could guess they were squeezed closed because his face was drawn tightly, like a man in suffering. His erection still had not flagged.
The cabin was frigidly cold and small. It only had two doors, one for the bathroom and one for the entrance. A single twin bed was shoved against the wall, and a ratty old couch took up most of the living space. It sat in front of a fireplace. There was a very modest kitchen behind it.
In response, Harry begins acting out at work again, flirting more heavily with women both on the DMLE floor and in the atrium, even when Draco is not around. He’s a glutton for punishment but Draco’s not biting. His flirting is so overdone that word gets back to him about it through the grapevine.
Draco groaned. There was no way Harry was going to hold off for more than a moment or two, certainly not long enough for Draco to enter him. He lifted his head quickly and ordered,
He stood up to go. Draco wanted to let him go. He needed time to clear his head and sort out his feelings, but the minute Harry started walking out of the parlor, his heart sank into misery and he started to panic. He still didn’t move from his chair.
Suffice to say, Draco never got a chance to tell Blaise about his pending divorce. It was a Friday so he had to wait until the following week to speak to him.
Harry swallowed whatever was in his mouth and wiped his chin with his fingers. He then sucked on them, making a real show of it. He bored into Malfoy’s eyes as he did it.
Harry had his hand wrapped around the wrist of a cloaked figure that was pushed against the wall. It was clearly an intimate pose. The cloaked figure was totally cast in shadow, with his face buried into Harry’s shoulder, obscuring him from view. No identifying features on Draco were visible, but it was very clear that it was Harry. The back of his cloak had the head auror insignia on it. The only part of Draco that was visible was his hand, which clutched the back of Harry’s cloak desperately, and then, they both vanished into disillusionment. The picture played on a loop, over and over again, with Harry burying his face into Draco’s neck, Draco clutching his back with clamped fingers, and then both disappearing into invisibility, once more.
Ripping Draco’s wand from his hand, he throws it on the ground besides the bed and jumps to go to the shower, slamming the door behind him and locking it. Clutching his face in his hand and sighing, Draco goes to join him and smooth things over. The door is locked and
The next morning, Draco awoke to find himself gridlocked by Harry’s strong arms. Both of them were wrapped around him and he immediately felt suffocated. It was not often that he woke up with a sleeping companion, but it happened on a few rare occasions, mostly with Blaise. Having slept alone in a bed most of his life, he preferred sleeping far apart from his bed partner, otherwise, he overheated.
He hadn’t visited Blaise in his home for extracurricular activities since that night he tied him up and fucked him within an inch of his life. It had been over a month, and he was starting to feel it.
“I’m still going to try to get a transfer to Paris. If I you get me stuck in London, you better start giving me real cases. No more using the boss card when our private life is displeasing to you.”
It was his intelligence, meticulousness, and excellence that gave Draco an edge. He had an intricate knowledge of dark wizards that the others simply did not. He worked longer hours and often had a heavier work load. Draco was involved on every high profile case. He would never be promoted above a field auror because of his seedy past, but he was fine with that as long as he could keep his job. He did not need to work, as reparations from the war took a sizable fortune, but not enough to make a dent in Draco's style of living, but he enjoyed feeling useful for once. He enjoyed being good at what he did.
The kiss started soft but quickly evolved into something more heated. Harry reached over to his neck to suck on it. Draco’s cock started to harden in his pants.
Draco was breathing hard from a spike of adrenaline. Of course, Harry would appear right when he was receiving a sexual stimulant potion that he was intending to use on Blaise, that very same night. The fates were always against him. It rankled when he realized that he would never need such a potion to fuck Harry, all night, if he was this horny. He was the reason he had to forego his pride and order this potion, in the first place. He cursed him for having complete control over his libido.
He gasped in admiration when Draco reappeared. He was wearing black leather trousers and a black leather shirt, molded tightly to his body, cut in a deep V which showed off his pale chiseled chest. The dark leather enhanced his naturally commanding masculinity and Harry felt his cock swell with desire, trapped as it was in the tight confines of his pants. A strap dangled from Draco’s belt and he held a leash in his gloved hands.
“Yes, maybe we should talk. Let’s talk about why in the bleeding fuck you were canoodling with Potter over breakfast. Since when are you two so close? I thought you hated him. Tell me now and tell me true. Are you fucking him?”
Harry chuckles. “I promise, Draco. I’ve never been more sure of anything in my entire life. And you could still spank me, whenever you want.”
When they finally got changed and ready for sleep, Harry insisted that Draco take the bed. He would take the couch. It was he, after all, who dragged him up here, on his day off.
Draco could absolutely not have sex with Blaise tonight. He was already on shaky ground with the man, and having sex with him again would make things worse. Draco couldn’t remember why, with Blaise’s scent so close, but he knew it would. Besides, he had just had sex with Harry at noon that very same day. Harry would be livid if he found out. He went from having sex with one man his whole life, to feeling like a strumpet, overnight. Maybe, he really did, only think with his cock.
His hypocrisy burned when he remembered that he had, just recently, emphasized to Harry that one could never use sex as a form of punishment, yet here they were. Draco had whipped him into a bloody mess and brutally fucked him, with a heart full of vengeance. It would not be something Harry was likely to forget.
Unprovoked? That had to be a sick joke. At the threat to his job, however, he began to calm down. He wouldn’t put it passed Harry to revoke his badge, and he was already on shaky ground with the DMLE. They noticed how Harry was treating him lately and blamed Draco for his foul mood. They weren’t wrong.
It’s hard to explain, so he’s not going to try. For now, no one’s actually said he can take a dick, so it’s normal for him to say he’s waiting until he gets clearance.
Harry lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding. He takes a second to blink his tears back, realizing he jumped to the wrong conclusion. Now that he’s breathing again, it’s easier to talk.
He almost jumped when he felt Draco’s hands on his shoulders. This was the first time he touched him in public at work. Pleased with his sensitive response, Draco slid his hands medially, very slowly, until he was lightly grasping the base of his neck. He leaning closer to his ear, his voice softening to a whisper.
Draco sat inside a St. Mungo’s room for the second time in as many days. He should have known something was wrong with Harry earlier, but he was too wrapped up in the sex to notice.
There was no use denying it, at this point. Draco would agree to anything, as long as Harry kept fucking him, like this.
The tabled man made the perfect pain slut. He was loving every second of it. He thought he might die if he did not take over and whip him, himself. The man of modest looks was being too gentle with him. Draco could tell the submissive wanted more.
He was fairly certain that he would give Harry anything he ever asked for, as long as he continued to put his body on top of his.
The only difference was the lack of preparation this time around. Draco was in too much of a rush and assumed that Blaise would be amply stretched from the weekend before.
“So anyway,” she tells Ron and Luna, in that lilting cheerleader voice she sometimes has. “Draco is one of the best humans.”
and closed his eyes. He heard Harry mutter a cleaning charm and felt a body snuggle into him, felt a hand lay across his bare chest, before falling into a deep sleep.
Ten minutes later, the flames turned green and Harry walked through. His hair was dripping from a shower. Draco was surprised to see he wore fitted black joggers and a Gryffindor-red, sleeveless, sleeping top that showed off his muscular arms. Draco’s mouth watered at the sight.
They managed to stun the next few that arrived, but they kept coming. One werewolf leaped over the bodies of his pack and headed straight for Draco, pinning him down. The smell on Draco was strongest. Though he held his head back far enough to avoid teeth, he felt hot breath and a long tongue licking his neck. It was snapping its jaws, itching to take a bite.
him—all the time. Like a boxer with his hands down. So it’s up to Draco to take care of him. He has to be better now.
Harry is still fiddling with the thing when Draco returns. Harry almost looks at him but remembers he shouldn’t look in his eyes. He is too distracted, in any case, by the cock-hardening black leather pants he’s wearing. He’s shirtless.
It’s Friday and they’ve convinced the kids to spend the night at Grimmauld Place because they’re spending their weekend back with their mothers. After they go to sleep, Draco and Harry retire to the parlor. Draco’s nursing a ginger ale on ice.
“Oh pet…we haven’t even started yet. Take a deep breath. Now, I think this would work better on the bed. On your back if you’d be so kind.”
It was a deep friendly affection with occasional sex, though admittedly, the sex had been happening more often than usual in light of Harry’s antics. Their sexual relationship started back at Hogwarts and continued on and off for the past 15 years.
Draco released him quickly and turned him around to cup his face and kiss him. Harry tried to push him off and move his face away. There was a struggle, but Draco managed to get a resistant kiss in. Harry’s face felt hot with tears, and he felt himself breaking apart. How could he have let his Harry become this sad and insecure?
“Your heart is pounding so fast,” Harry observed. “Are you all right?” He moved his hand in slow circles, eyes respectfully low. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry sir. I’m fine. It hurt, but I’m all right.”
They did some recon work, but didn’t make much headway. It was hard to get anywhere because they didn’t speak Turkish, but many of them spoke English and tried to direct them. They stared at Draco’s hair enviously. It was obvious he was tourist.
“Oh merlin, fucking hell. oh gods, no.” Harry shook and spread his legs a bit further. Draco could feel him try to resist the movement and his grin broadened, his tongue lapping delicately at its goal.
In the weeks that followed Harry’s epiphany, he and Draco’s sex life had immensely suffered. As a result, Draco was plagued with a myriad of racing thoughts.
Draco would not engage with him. It would not go over well, and they were at a ministry ball. He shot him a hateful look and moved to leave the room. Harry grabbed his arm to stop him, but he shrugged it off, harshly. When he reached the door, it was locked.
“You’re trembling, baby. Do you want me take you home back to London? They have international portkeys every hour.”
Their Wednesday night meetings at the Wizarding Country Club started up again. Blaise regaled him with all kinds of stories about the unspeakables who worked with him. He would never tell him about his actual work because it was strictly forbidden, but he had no problem discussing his coworkers.
He was surprised to feel a hand caress his thigh for the first time in weeks, then dip forward to caress his cock, which was, unbeknownst to Draco, completely erect. He may have pretended not to see him standing naked and proud, but his body had betrayed him. Draco smacked his hand away.
The sound of tapping on the window wakes him at five in the morning, bringing in Harry’s snowy white owl with a letter containing one word:
He stands in the shower the next morning, thinking. He tries not to think about him, but he couldn’t make a clean break from his mental calendar.
“Since when do you delude yourself? He might think it’s hot and heavy, but now that he knows the truth about you, he’s going to keep you in the dark...where we belong.”
“We’ve decided on a two month long honeymoon. I’m going to take her to all the best spots in Europe.”
“I’m just trying to get a feel for you Malfoy. After what happened last night, I…” but he was interrupted by Draco. He could see where this was going and had to put a stop to it immediately.
Draco was worried he watched Draco in his bed, tossing off to a Daily Profit picture of Harry, in his auror regalia, grinning at the camera. He did this almost every night and began to flush with panic.
the man was fucking perfect. He looked fake, like a sculpture, especially his pert ass. Draco suddenly needed to lick it. The minute he moves down to do just that, Harry wakes up in a fright, like he’s being attacked in his sleep.
When he arrived at Blaise’s room in St. Mungo’s, he was relieved to find him awake. He looked weak, but he was chatting with Pansy who held his hand, at his bedside. His eye was healed.
Draco’s brow furrows and Harry has the inexplicable desire to lick the space between them to smooth it out.
He was sure to pause at the entrance, as it was also lit by a red light and anyone who entered or exited could be seen clearly. He wanted to be seen and ogled. He wanted them to imagine him fucking them hard until they screamed. Though he could not see them, it made his cock stir knowing that they were imagining themselves bent over in front of him, taking his thick cock deep inside their hole.
Draco smiles, knowing the truth, but waiting for Harry to admit it. He needs to admit that every step he takes is with his Master in mind and that he has no control over himself, no desires of his own, but to please him.
Harry must have noticed the disappointment etched in his face, though he tried his best to cover it behind his usual mask of indifference. He didn’t want him to know how much he was wounded by this.
They drank tea in silence. Draco still hadn’t uttered a single word. He couldn’t believe he was sitting here, calmly sipping Earl Grey tea, while his best friend lay in a hospital bed, at the hands of the man sitting across from him.
He used two more ropes to tie each wrist to a rope that connected to the opposing bar. He gave him slack so that he could brace himself up on his forearms. Then, he used the last two ropes to tie his wrists forward to the head board. He couldn’t move a muscle. He considered tying a rope around his neck so he wouldn’t be able to move his head, but he might want that mobility, for later.
He cast the cleaning charm before he licked and sucked his hole, then he wandlessly cast lube on his fingers to stretch him wide.
“No one stands a chance against you, Harry.” Draco’s tone is sincere and it catches Harry off-guard. Draco blushes when he realizes the significance of his words.
He sat up quickly and turned around, so that his feet were on the floor over the side of the bed. He wiped his tears away ferociously, but they kept coming, like a waterfall.
When he arrived at Grimmauld Place, he was five minutes late. Harry’s face lit up like a Christmas tree when he saw him, like Draco was his favorite person in the world.
That brought a small smile to his face as he disappeared on the spot with a loud crack, returning back to his empty manor.
thrust two fingers inside at once. Draco could barely get them in, but he shoved them forward, brutally. He then thrust a third finger. His hole was clenching around his fingers, but he persisted. He continued, for only a few seconds, and then pulled out.
He could not remember exactly what he was dreaming about, but right when he woke up, there was an image of Harry, from the day before, fresh in his mind.
He uses his full strength to bring down the whip again and again, all over his back. Blaise screams in agony.
That’s enough for Harry to blow all over his desk with a strangled gasp. He would’ve roared his orgasm but Draco’s hands are still wrapped around his neck cutting off air, and suddenly, everything goes black.
The first floor of the establishment was a normal muggle gay club, dark with laster lights, pounding music, and gyrating bodies grinding up against each other. Men with spiked collars and black leather masks danced provocatively in cages suspended above the dance floor. The whole club was BDSM themed. Draco relished in all the eyes that stared at him in pure lust as he slowly walked through the crowd. Some were daring enough to run their hands over his body on his way to the bar. Draco did not mind. He was not planning on fucking anyone in this club, above ground or below. There was no harm in being touched.
In the past, Blaise would claim that he did go out on dates, all the time, but they turned out to be duds and only after his money. Clearly, the man did not realize how attractive and wonderful he was.
Draco’s too hard to argue with him and will take whatever he can get, so he uses his wand to cast preparation charms. He quickly shucks his briefs and breaches his entrance, before Harry could change his mind. He’s tighter than usual and Draco’s eyes roll back at the excruciating heat and pressure. It feels like a velvet fist is squeezing his cock as he slides in to the hilt. He groans loudly as his balls tuck against Harry’s ass and leans forward to lay flush against him, needing to feel all of him.
Harry suddenly wondered if he’d gone mad, kneeling on the floor with his hands clasped behind him in front of this complicated man who had a body as sleek and muscular as a panther. He always fantasized about play in the office, but Draco always forbade it, and the reality was far more jarring than the fantasy. With the collar in the bedroom, it was easy to transform into sub Harry, but this was different. His head auror uniform was straining from being in a kneeling position and he was reminded that they were in the middle of a work day. They often had sex at work, but it was always initiated by Draco, and they never played without the collar. A dangerous glitter in Draco’s eyes reminded him of his lapse.
Draco looked at him, shocked. The man was magically skilled enough to create his own spells. It spurred his lust to know this powerful man would bend over for him, whenever he so desired. His cock twitched and he turned away.
She was on the board of several charities instead, donating large amounts of the Malfoy fortune, but never without Draco’s consent. It was not enough to really make a dent in their finances, in any case.
Harry stroked down to his ass, grabbing both globes in his calloused hands, groaning. Draco could feel his stiff erection pressed against his thigh, and heard him panting behind him.
“You don’t have to refer to me as ‘sir’ when we’re out of a scene, baby. It’s just us, back to normal, now.”
Blaise sighed as he finished his first firewhiskey and slammed the glass down. “Draco, you’re not my mother. I don’t need you fretting over me. I am a wealthy, grown man with no limit of prospects. If I wanted to date, I would.”
“Absolutely lovely. Now, from here I can play with your ass, your balls…I can spank you, fuck you, flog you. When I say ‘present’ you immediately drop and arrange yourself like this.”
She looked like a vision out of a fashion magazine, no matter what she wore, and she was always impeccably dressed. She was often approached to model, but politely declined. Even if she wanted to, she knew that Draco would never allow it. He was very possessive of her and sometimes became angry when men ogled her while out in public.
Draco didn’t want to respond, but he did. It was a beautiful kiss. It wasn’t gnashing teeth and tongue like it often was with Harry. It was familiar act, one of comfort. Draco could feel Blaise pouring his love into that kiss and it made his heart ache. He pulled away and lay his head on his shoulder.
Even if he did decide to throw caution to the wind and restart their affair, their inevitable end would result in Harry walking out on him. He was certain of it.
It hurt. It really fucking hurt. Harry was huge, but Draco was determined to have him fully inside him.
Draco’s eyes widened at the proclamation and was surprised by his second orgasm tearing out of him, after hearing those bold words.
When he arrived back at the stables, Harry was waiting for him, smiling widely, leaning against the wood, in a casual pose. He looked very sexy tonight, in dark grey jeans and a black fitted t-shirt. Only Harry could make muggle clothing look so agreeable. His arms were bulging more than usual, from being crossed.
“…It can’t be broken if the sub is coerced. Not by me, you, or anyone. It has to come from Blaise alone, because it’s magically binding. It has to be his true decision. The contract will sense it in his magic if he is resistant to it. It won’t hold, even if he says the spell.”
Draco jumped off his back and went around to the head of the bed to feed him his cock and wet it for entry. He sat in front of Blaise’s face, though he could not see, and poked his mouth with his cock. Blaise opened it and began to suck him down. He could not deep throat him at this angle, but his suction and enthusiasm almost made Draco lose control. He pulled his cock out and slapped him across the face, spitting in his face once more. He reared backwards, spreading his ass apart and thrust his ass towards his face, so Blaise could lick his hole. Blaise was surprised by this and licked eagerly, sucking and kissing his hole with abandon. Draco couldn’t help moaning.
“It seems like they’re being manufactured in Turkey and we need to go there to check it out. Be ready to leave in an hour and pack a bag. We might need to be there for a few days.”
Only liquid came up. He realized he had skipped dinner last night, which was probably why he had become inordinately drunk.
Harry had finally stopped laughing and his eyes were shining with emotion. He was still grinning at him. His whole face had changed since Draco first saw him tonight. He looked younger, somehow, eyes bright, cheeks flushed from mirth, and absolutely, devastatingly beautiful.
When they sat for dinner that night in Draco’s dining room, Harry came down the stairs from his shower to the red collar glittering invitingly in its velvet box. A contract sat next to it with a quill and both their wands lay on the table. The sight thrilled him.
“I can’t help but think you’re saving your cock for Blaise, instead. Why is he the only one who gets to experience it?”
“I think we might be looking in the wrong place for these potions masters. Today, we should go to the Asia side of Turkey. I have a hunch we’ll have better luck there.”
“It’s none of your bloody business, Potter! Blaise is my best friend and you will treat him with respect.”
“Nah, he’s a lot of fun. He’s young and innocent. It will be nice to corrupt him a bit, until you get your head out of your arse.”
He peaked around Blaise to check on his cock. It was fully hard, dripping copiously now. Blaise always loved a good spanking.
Harry snuggled against his side, purring softly, and put a hand over his chest. Draco put his hand on top of his, and they both fell into a sated sleep.
They were at the Wizarding Country Club one night when Blaise had too much to drink and admitted, bashfully, that he had a creepy thing for Professor Snape in 7th year. He imagined being called in for a paddling and a fuck, as punishment for being a naughty schoolboy. For his 25th birthday, it took him all day, but Draco managed to transfigure his playroom into an exact replica of the Hogwarts headmaster office, rummaging up Blaise’s old Slytherin uniform for him to wear. He charmed his hair black, lengthening it to his chin, donning Snape’s all black, bat-like robes, and they played it out. Draco had completely surprised him with that, bringing him to orgasm five times that night. He gushed about it for months afterwards as “the best birthday present ever.” He remembered Blaise’s perfect act as the doe-eyed, fearful schoolboy, and it made him hard under his desk.
Having no choice in the matter, Draco opened his eyes to watch ropes of his cum splatter his eyelashes, his tongue, his chin, dripping down to his chest.
When he arrived at Grimmauld Place, the first floor was dark and empty. Harry had stood him up. He went up to the bedroom, just to make sure.
“Get ready to leave in fifteen minutes Auror Malfoy. We have a potential situation in Islington,” he ordered harshly.
The first thing he did when he arrived at Malfoy Manor was pour himself a glass of firewhiskey. He was sitting in the parlor, contemplating the last 48 hours. He didn’t know what to feel.
At the mention of her son being taken away from her, Astoria’s voice rose high and strong, for the first time.
Harry kissed down his chest, and removed Draco’s pants swiftly, along with his own. They were both only in their underwear when he moved back up to kiss him. Draco felt lost to desire, sure that he would soon die from all this passion. They rolled around on the bed together, kissing, and rubbing their clothed cocks together, until it became too much to bear. Harry quickly shucked Malfoy’s underwear off while still kissing him, tenderly.
“Please, try it. You need to eat something.” He reached over to grab the firewhiskey from his hand. It was still swinging lamely at his side. He placed it on the table.
Draco braced himself, hoping no reporters would be there, and walked to the floo. It should not be too terrible. He could handle one or two reporters. It would be easy enough to avoid them. How interested could people possibly be in his personal life? Then again, it now involved Harry. He hoped for the best and disappeared in the floo.
Draco stormed through the parlor, directly to his liquor cart. He shakily poured himself a firewhiskey. Half of what he poured fell around the glass, but he hardly cared. He downed the entire contents of his glass and poured another. He took a second shot, and sat down with his third glass, in hand, waiting for the firewhiskey to work its magic.
