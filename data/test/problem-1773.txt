Draco held the Diadem. The legend said that he would give wisdom to whoever used it, but with a piece of the Dark Lord's soul in it... he had tried everything. He had stepped on the jewel, cast all the destructive spells he knew. Nothing had worked.
"NO!", Granger snarled. Draco looked at her, still in his pajamas, and felt his own face ache with the memory of the punch. This was no time to chicken out, however.
Skin against skin, the lube spell creating a pool of wetness below Potter, Draco fucked him until he felt the tell signs of his orgasm. His rhythm faltered, and he came deep inside Potter, who let out a mewl sound, clenching around Draco like he was coming too.
"Draco. No Malfoy in bed, Potter."
The steps around Harry were annoying, but they stopped when a new love of feet entered the room.
Minutes later, clean and dressed, but still ashamed, the two went down to find a wide-eyed Sirius being comforted by a Remus who looked like he was about to have a fit of laughter.
"Draco, I dare you to make Potter come as many times as possible with only your cock."
"And a toast to Slytherin!"
"Hurry, Harry! You have to go now, or they will ... they will.", But Harry was already dressed, just missing the T-shirt, and Draco didn't know what to say when he saw the sad smile he showed.
"Well, there weren't many clothing options in the dungeon.", The smile on the other's face didn't stop Draco's heart from squeezing.
They turned a corridor and met the Muggle-borns Luna was leading.
The headmaster's sparkling eyes shone with anger.
Draco didn't want to think about what she said very deeply, he just nodded for the other students to follow him.
Harry smiled, his fingers still moving inside him, and muttered another spell. Draco's contained cry revealed that it had worked, a line of magic holding the base of the blonde's cock and preventing him from coming. Harry loved the way Draco looked like he was about to cry, his ass almost buried in his face. The lubricating spell had not stopped producing the invisible liquid, now forming a puddle that fell over the blonde's shoulders.
"I'm not giving up. Because there's nothing to give up.", The blonde's hurt look almost made Harry want to take those words back, but… it was the truth. "I just need this to end, because I don't... I can't have another year with this shadow hanging over me."
Dumbledore was sitting at his desk, staring at his hands on top of it. Draco approached.
"Blaise, could we change things a little bit?", Asked Pansy.
"I suppose you came here with my end in mind.", Draco didn't answer. How could he? "Anyway, I just want to point out that I don't believe you are a murderer."
"You still have my shirt."
"Rock my shit."
Draco called Luna.
"We can't do that."
A few hours had passed, Harry was in the infirmary and Draco by his side, taking care of the brunette as he could. The hospital wing was full, but Madame Pomfrey was concerned about the effects that receiving a second Avada Kedrava had had on Harry's body.
A round of applause.
Then he would infiltrate Hogwarts, kill Dumbledore and invade with his entire army, and as a final act, Harry's sacrifice.
He was a rich boy, not worthless.
"Get dressed, Draco. Your mother is waiting for us for breakfast."
Not that he was going to survive.
He let a shaky breath come out of him, the thought guiding his actions when one hand released the fingers of the other and found its place in the full hips. Harry's other hand went to his shoulder, his eyes never leaving, even when they crossed the line a second time.
"It's not like you don't like the thrill of being almost caught.", Harry whispered in the blond's ear, his hand running up his legs and his eyes following the shiver that followed.
He just hoped those important to him were still okay. Alive.
"She was made for that. How's Slytherin?", Oh Draco's smile faltered.
The Lord would not appear now. No, he would wait for everything to calm down before showing his face.
Harry.
Harry didn't know it was possible to feel sick when he Apparates inside an iron coffin. But then again, he thought that no one was ever transported in an iron coffin and survived to tell the story.
Draco started a scissoring motion with his fingers, his tight arse flexing around his fingers as he spelled more lube onto them.
“Let me have a look.” Harry stepped away from Malfoy, Draco let out a small whimper at Harry’s movement. Harry needed to keep his cool, he had an hour and a half. He didn’t want it to be over in five minutes flat.
“Right. Sorry… sorry.”
Harry felt like he was intruding on something very private. It didn’t feel like he should be in the room.
“I knew you’d be angry.”
“No.” Draco began, finally giving into the voices, “She’s right. I deserve a hell of a lot worse than what I get-“
“Ow!” He exclaimed, rolling onto his back, and clutching his rib cage in pain. He rolled into a ball, wating a minute or two for the pain to trickle away.
“Did you put salt in this?” He asked, passing the coffee cup back to Draco.
“Oh my God! Malfoy!” Harry shouted, shock radiating from his body in waves of glee. Malfoy turned around, suddenly cursing a white beam out of his wand directly into Harry’s chest.
“You’re not wrong.”
“That’s lovely, so I’ll see you soon?” She asked, Harry opened the door for Malfoy as the blond stepped outside.
“Have you ever even held a guitar before?”
“Good night, Malfoy.”
Diagon Alley was a lot brighter at this time of day, jovial chit chat taking up a low mumble down the street. It felt like a comforting hug to Harry, reminding himself of his first time he stepped into Diagon with Hagrid. A small smile settled on his face at the memory.
Draco Malfoy? As in ex-death eater, prostitute, genius potions master Draco Malfoy?” Draco’s body flinched at her words, like she’d physically hurt him, not just spoken.
“Hello Potter.”
At this Harry’s thrusts sped up even faster, rippling Draco’s skin explicitly with every slap. His mouth dropped even further and he was faintly aware that he was moaning a sting of intangible noises mixed with “fuckHarryfuckfuckfuckfuck”.
“Of course not, Draco hasn’t had a knut to his name since Lucius was sent to Azkaban.”
bleach smell around him.
When Harry’s fingertips brushed over one of Malfoy’s perked nipples over the thin fabric of his shirt, a hungry noise fell from Malfoy’s lips, and then his hands were threaded back into the waistband of Harry’s pants. He half-heartedly began to tug, but he had no chance of getting them down with Harry’s belt buckle still tightly wound around them. So Harry took over, swatted Draco’s hands away and worked the belt loose from his hips.
In a completely non-consensual move, Ginny’s arms wrapped around Draco’s own neck, overwhelming with the flowery, vanilla scent of her perfume. Ginny always made an effort to be kind to Draco whenever she saw him, but it didn’t stop his surprise at her greeting. After so many years of hating one another, her embrace was always a shock.
He tried to pull a smouldering gaze in the mirror, only to immediately want to slap himself for doing something so stupid. He groaned out as he turned away from the reflection, chucking his hands to his eyes as he did. Why was he so nervous, he’s a grown man for Merlin’s sake.
Harry’s mouth dropped open
The feeling was strange, part of him almost wanted to ask Malfoy to stop because it felt really weird to have something shoved up there. But slowly, the intruding sensation slipped into a low hum of pleasure.
“Shut up.”
“Yes.”
“Please.”
Draco looked around at all the food again.
When Harry’s feet landed back on the safe carpet of Ron and Hermione’s house, he quickly ran upstairs to his own bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him. Leaving him trapped in his own room, just him and a raging erection.
“You don’t necessarily have to go with magical plants ya’know. They’re actually far harder to keep alive than muggle plants.”
After about an hour of the two sitting naked under the sheets of Harry’s bed, clutching cups of tea in their hands, they had decided to get dressed and begin their work on the basement.
Harry became suddenly aware of his soft cock poking out from the sheets and swiftly moved the cover to give himself some modesty.
“Well what’s it like then?” She asked, a curious smile spreading across her face.
“I was saying that Malfoy got what he deserved with that one.” Ron repeated.
He gasped at the feeling, having to wrap his ankle up and around Draco’s calf.
Byeee :D
Then it was all too good to be true when Harry remembered the whole crowded room was watching him. Harry frantically jumped away from Malfoy, causing the two men to bash foreheads together.
“There’s quite a few reasons behind it. I did live with him in England for about a year, but then he got a boyfriend who used to come over all the time, I couldn’t bear to watch Draco with another man. It was dumb, I knew I never had a chance with him, but I’d always hoped that- I don’t know… I was quite heart broken, I think.”
He squeezed his eyes shut and banged his head on the shut door.
“Wash that toothpaste out of your mouth, Ron! That’s disgusting!” She scolded, batting her spatula angrily in his direction.
He slowly lifted the blanket off his body, trying not to wake Draco up, and hauled himself onto his legs.
Lucius grumbled.
“George. Now hurry up and open that present!”
“What do you mean?” He strolled to the stove, mildly proud at how his sneer made Tim look down to the table.
“How you’ve managed to convince yourself that I’ve never had any feelings for you, despite me using every possible trick in the book to make a move. For two years.”
Because he did not like him one little bit right this second.
He straddled one leg over the man’s torso, making Draco’s eyes suddenly shoot wide, Harry quickly realised his miscalculation and shakily shuffled back, away from Malfoy’s face, only to realised he was now sat on the man’s crotch.
“Can you get off me?”
He placed it back down on the table and grabbed another darker bottle.
A knock on his window sill threw Harry out of the staring contest he’d started with his wall.
“What can I say, I’m a quiet person.”
Yes. Breakfast. That sounded like a great idea.
“Then that is private information.” Malfoy stretched his limbs out in a way that Harry didn’t even know could be provocative. His dick twitched again, he was definitely noticeably hard now, Harry readjusted in his seat, moving his hands to cover his crotch. Malfoy’s eyeline immediately shot downwards and then back up, as a shit-eating covered his face. “You okay there, Potter?”
Hermione baby time yaya.
Anyways, his situation seemed to be a blessing in disguise. He’d never made quite so many paintings in his life. He must’ve made about four per day. They were all dark and jagged, even the life portraits of his garden always seemed to put emphasis on the shadows.
Suddenly a loud knock sounded at the door, making Draco jump and accidentally bash his forehead directly against Harry’s. Both boys shouted curses in pain, Draco’s exclamations growing louder when he bashed the back of his head against the cupboard behind him as well.
“I suppose not.”
Draco looked past Andy’s shoulder to see Harry cracking an egg into a saucepan practically filled to the brim with oil.
“Trust me, Draco. It was.”
“What a shame. It was nice to meet you, Harvey.” James held his hand out to shake, Harry gripped the tough skin with his own. Their hands were exactly the same, from the grubby, thick fingers to the size.
Malfoy took a moment to respond, but as soon as he did, it all just felt right. They pushed against each other, Malfoy melted like clay against Harry in an instant. Heat seared through him and flared in his belly, making his legs shake below him.
He was kissing
Narcissa closed her eyes again, and Harry stared at her eyelashes as he casted.
He had already had about three men proposition him whilst he was here, all of which he had declined with a polite ‘No thank you’. But now Harry had kind of wished he had accepted, just so he wouldn’t be sat here now like a lost puppy.
He popped the drinks down on the table in front of her.
“Well, it’s certainly, different.” She commented, clearing her throat as a look of distaste crossed her face.
He lowered his wand once again to conjure some more smoke. It flowed from the glass in waves now, filling the floor of Harry’s room like fluorescent blue water, it looked like it was glowing, soon enveloping the bottom of Harry’s feet.
They both shuffled around before neatly tucking themselves inside the bed and snuggling up together so that Draco’s back was pressed air tight to Harry’s chest, a warm bubble forming around them under the covers.
“Coming!” Harry shouted back, grabbing his jacket and chucking it on whilst moving out of his room and down to the second floor, where the floo was located.
Now with Harry out of the room, Draco could think clearly.
“Hello darling.” She walked towards the two boys and clutched onto Draco’s head, lifting her lips to kiss his forehead. “It’s lovely to meet you.” She smiled, wrapping her arms around Draco. Draco accepted the hug openly, dropping his head into her shoulder. Harry heard a few sad snuffles from Draco.
“Okay.”
The plan also showed a small basement below the cottage.
It wasn’t a kiss.
So what do we think of this AU? Do we like it, or not?
Hope you enjoy
Harry opened the door wide behind him and slammed it on his way out.
Draco’s emotional monologue was cut short by Harry’s fuming voice. Somehow, with all the screaming in his mind, he hadn’t noticed Harry sat next to him, shaking with anger.
Harry pulled all the way out to his tip before slamming back in again, the sound of skin slapping against skin reverberating around the room like a gun shot. Malfoy’s stream of moans never ended, his hands lifting higher to push against the headboard of Harry’s bed, a poor attempt to stop his body flying at Harry’s thrusts.
“I’d better get dressed quickly, then we can go skating, yeah?”
Harry cringed when Alex thrust his cock against Harry’s.
Harry woke up at three AM with an undying need to pee.
“What are you doing today?” Draco asked, pulling the trousers up his legs.  Was he not going to wear underwear?
“Dare.” Malfoy’s grin grew ten-fold until it practically took up his entire face.
He closed his eyes, letting his head fall back against the door with a clunk.
“They really are, since learning to cut hair, I’ve actually managed to tame mine.” Draco glanced up to Harry’s head of hair.
Harry nodded, then glanced over to his bedroom door.
Draco suddenly felt an overwhelming urge rip through his body for more.
Malfoy nonchalantly waved his hand in Harry’s direction.
“No Mia, it’s fine I don’t want any tea.”
“I mean, I still fucked him within an inch of his life, sure. But I prefer someone who actually puts some effort in ya’know.”
“Really?” Alex looked up at him, obvious disappointment threaded through his face. “Do you even want to be here?”
To think that Malfoy could have his life’s work stolen by someone else.
The he comes back up. Inch by inch. Draco continues, the pressure of his heavy tongue under Harry’s cock making his eyes roll back and tremble all over. And everytime he rises back up again, he’s sucking, working Harry’s prick in his mouth, driving him insane.
Dressed head to toe in leather.
Harry felt his face blanch, his heart beat at a mile a minute and an odd urge to throw up.
Draco let Harry ride out the rest of his orgasm, before he pulled out of Draco and collapsed down on the bed next to him. His breath was erratic, sweat covering every inch of his body, his hair slowly becoming wet at the roots.
“Close that door, could you? It’s a bit cold in here.” Draco requested.
Harry knew he should be excited; blow jobs were great. But the stench of bleach and piss was so much stronger in here, Harry couldn’t even focus on his own thoughts, let alone the man in front of him. Then Harry heard a disgruntled sigh from the floor.
Harry definitely didn't feel a zing of excitement shoot up his spine at the thought
Harry heard no sound or movement.
“I give him a week.” Blaise shouted out, laughing. “Max.”
“Please Malfoy.” He begged, without pausing Malfoy immediately took the whole of Harry into his mouth, his tip hitting Draco’s throat. Harry choked out a loud moan, wrapping his fingers in Malfoy’s hair.
as his eyes drifted open, staring into the wall.
“Oh, it’s okay Harry. It’s a good thing really. This way we’ll figure out which house by maybe five pm. That’ll be nice.” Hermione hid the small splodge of disappointment on her face well, but it made Harry’s heart ache seeing her saddened. However, it was going to be his house at the end of the day, and not hers.
“No, all of this happened a while ago, when I’d moved away from Malfoy for a while, I got over it. I only liked him for so long because we lived with each other.” Cole explained, twirling his fingers over the rim of his cup. “You learn to move on.”
“Are you sure?” He asked, courteously.
“You seemed to be enjoying yourself.” Draco smiled up to the ceiling of the basement.
What do we all think about it? Leave a comment below. :)
“If you knew, it could affect your future actions. I wouldn’t want to swing anything.” Draco explained.
“Yes I mean, I can just use Ron and Hermione’s shower for the moment, they’re fine with it.”
“Can I use your toilet?” He asked, trying to hide his discomfort from his face.
“I don’t entertain myself with muggle pastimes.”
“It is, it’s very exciting. It’s a big step in my life, it’s just that, I’ve never really been alone before you know. It was always Hogwarts or with the Weasley’s or at Ron and Hermione’s - never just me. The closest I’ve ever been to being alone before was,” Harry looked around them before whispering out “The Dursley’s.”, a small, sympathetic frown painted Ginny’s face.
attractive.
It was still here.
Harry wrapped his hand around the plug, this time fully pulling the metal out, Malfoy’s entrance resisting against the pull, attempting to tug the toy back inside.
Maybe he could use a coffee.
“Who?” Harry asked, dumbly.
“Are you even listening to me Harry?” Ginny grumbled, slapping her hand into Harry’s side.
Draco looked down to the floor, furrowing his eyebrows before looking back up.
friend! And he doesn’t change me out every single night. So, please get your toned, little arse out of here before your delusion grows any further!”
“Here you are. That’ll be eight-pounds-sixty-five, please.”
It couldn’t be called a
“Yeah, that’s cool. They don’t call me Hairy Potter for nothing”
Then in the crowd a small flicker of platinum blond shot up. No, surely not.
(See the end of the chapter for
The concrete paving was just as loud under his feet as it had always been, a comforting patter beneath him. It was decently sunny, which Harry was extremely thankful for as he stretched his head up to the sky, lapping up the heat.
After not even ten minutes of Draco leaving, a heavy, panicked knock slammed down against Harry’s front door.
“Actually, we can’t.” Harry apologised. “I’m sorry Narcissa, but I need to obliviate you. It wouldn’t be safe for you to remember us.”
Harry heart sunk with an inkling of sympathy. Whilst Malfoy was a prat, since the war, he had always had a soft spot for Narcissa.
He picked it up and lied it in his drying spot, watching over it with loving eyes.
“Sorry, Harry. I don’t feel very welcome here… I think I should go.” Tim spoke up.
that just seeing Malfoy in a state made Harry want to moan.
“Thanks.” Harry said, moving Draco’s hand to wipe off the soot.
“Hey! Play nice!” Harry flinched away for a second before wrapping his arms back around Draco once again.  “Now go to bed.”
In slow motion, he leant forward and pressed his lips softly onto Harry’s, for only a second before pulling away and staring endlessly into Harry’s eyes.
“Ginny?” He shouted into the fire, “GINNY!”
“Malfoy, go and make him a new one!” Harry scolded. “How did you even mix them up, the only salt is in the shaker labelled salt? Which is on the opposite side of the kitchen to the sugar!”
Harry quickly realised that his wand was still aimed at the tip of Draco’s nose.
“Okay… There’s one more thing.” He tried to reach out for Harry’s hands and this time, Harry let him. “Those potions… in the box. They’re not for selling. I need to chuck them away.” Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
Draco met each thrust of his fingers against himself, bobbing up and down against Harry’s hardwood door. The hand on his dick sped up as he imagined the exact image that he’d walked in on, him bent over with his arse in the air and Harry savagely thrusting in and out of him, using him like a doll.
Harry smiled and walked her through to the kitchen.
Something about the cut being more complementary and blah blah blah… He stopped listening after that.
Malfoy’s head peeked over at him from the bed. “You really fucked that up.” Draco laughed.
“But why?” Draco stared at him incredulously.
A low sniff echoed from Draco’s nose as he snuggled himself further into Harry’s shoulder.
The other two were more abstract paintings, and that was where Harry found that he really shined through. His life drawings were a bit runny, out of proportion and not quite perfect. Which just lead Harry to stress. But the abstract paintings were both beautiful in their own way.
“…There are spells for that.”
Draco had a light blush covering his face, Harry thought he suited bashfulness.
Draco moved his hands to wrap around Harry’s wrists, moving them above Harry’s head.
“How can such a small cottage have so many rooms?”
Then a hand appeared over the back of Malfoy’s hips, digging their fingers into his hipbones. Harry glanced up to see another man, he looked fairly similar to Harry, except a bit taller and larger.
“Maybe some juice, you look like you’re boiling.” Mia gushed, standing by the back door of the cottage, watching Harry finally pull himself away from the dirt pile.
Harry flexed his brow.
Alas, Harry still hadn’t found any use for the basement or the attic.
“You can’t be bloody serious Malfoy!”
Harry looked to the right of him to see a roller disco building blasting out Elton John.
“It’s fine, I’ll change my wards when I get home.” Harry flashed him another flirtatious smirk. Cole seemed to basically swoon in front of him.
“Okay then…” She paused. “I dare you to…“ She ran her eyes around the circle again, “snog Cole… until I say to stop.” Malfoy locked eyes across the circle with Cole. Cole glanced over to Harry.
“I said, it’s really not a good idea to fuck your tenant.”
“Coming.” Harry shouted, tugging himself from the staircase and hauling himself to the door.
“Maybe you were right. What you said was… it was quite sweet.”
“Yes, an unborn infant who – I’m sure – is having the time of her very small life listening to all this profanity.” She quipped, giving her belly two quick taps with her hand before turning around with a sharp hair flick and leaving the room.
The kitchen was a blend of traditional and modern, it had an old-style, deep red cooker – just like the one Harry had remembered being at the Burrow, where Molly had cooked most of their dinners (although this cooker was slightly nicer and definitely far more expensive). Harry adored the brick wall that lined the back of the kitchenette along with the birch and oak counter tops.
“What, really?” Malfoy gaped.
“But honestly, I’ve never been happier. Being alone allows you to learn about yourself and who you are more than ever before. It turned me into a far better person than I was, and I can easily say that being alone has made me into the happiest person I’ve ever been.” She reassured.
“Oh Merlin, he remembers me.”
“Here, write your full name and your owl’s name in my notebook, I’ll adjust the wards so that the owl can get in.” Harry offered, handing the pen over to Cole.
. He shook his head at the thought and picked up a new canvas, placing it on his easel.
“That’s not stupid at all Harry. I’d be more worried if you weren’t upset about that.”
“So, you were never even robbed?! What else have you lied about? Did you ever actually like me in Hogwarts? Or was that just a convenient memory?” Harry pulled his shirt off the ground, Malfoy’s expression suddenly twisted.
“Sooo….” Malfoy began, a child-like giddy smile on his lips “How are ya?”
Then Draco was pressing closer, pressing in, and it hurt, hurt a lot, but… somehow that was better than it should have been. Better than he had remembered the sharp prick of pain was offset by the overwhelming pleasure that plunged into him. Until Draco was inside him fully.
A large smile lifted on Draco’s face as he let out a laugh.
“You’re looking at it for what it is. But just imagine it after I do it up.” Harry excitedly grabbed the photo and then one of his sketched plans from the folder. “See?”
He could feel Malfoy’s eyes boring into his bum, and it took all his strength to not cover himself away. He leant down to pick up his discarded pair of underwear.
, now Malfoy knew about Harry’s little predicament. He hoped the man would just place it down as morning wood and not an erection from him. Which it was. Morning wood, that is. It definitely wasn’t because of being so close to Malfoy.
“You too, Parkinson.” Harry nodded towards her.
“Honestly Harry, you’re more of a drama queen than Ron, sometimes.” Hermione joked, aiming her greasy spatula in Harry’s direction. Suddenly, the sound of quick feet stomping down the staircase echoed around the kitchen. “Speak of the devil.”
Malfoy suddenly looked back to his plate where he too gawked at the size of the food.
“What’s wrong?” He asked, nurturingly lifting his finger to rub Harry’s cheek. Harry felt embarrassed to vocalise what he wanted.
“Language, Harry!” Kingsley scolded, his voice rising a semi-tone. Harry silenced and collapsed down onto the chair opposite Kingsley’s desk. Despite Kingsley’s raised voice, Harry could see an apologetic glint in his eye. “I know that you and Draco have… history. But you’re a grown man, and not to mention, an extremely skilled and well-trained Auror, I would’ve thought that you would be able to put your history behind you.”
After the next five dares or so, it appeared to be Malfoy’s turn, and the boy had never looked quite so mischievous in his life. He turned his devilish eyes to Harry.
They finished the rest of breakfast in comforting small talk.
Draco looked down to his feet.
. Harry smiled and perhaps went a bit scissor heavy on his last client, but it was five-fifty-five for god’s sake. This guy had cheek coming in at five-forty-five, and whilst normally Harry wouldn’t mind, he was bouncing to get back to Draco.
“Better?” He asked, noticing how Malfoy’s eyes lingered on his exposed legs.
“I’m not going to get back with Ginny” He was immediately, softly slapped in the arm.
Harry looked down to the floor. He still wasn’t one-hundred-percent comfortable with being gay, but he may as well just rip the bandage off.
Malfoy squared his shoulders as he approached the door and cleared his throat before lifting his fist to the door. Knocking on the heavy wood three times.
“She’s doing well. She just got back from her Quidditch world tour before I got here.”
Boredom
“Fine... Fuck you!” Andy exclaimed, turning around and grabbing his jacket on the way out. He left with an audible slam.
Harry decided to leave him be.
That was another thing about Harry. He had a real problem with proximity. He was constantly dropping little, tiny touches across Draco’s body, like rubbing his shoulder or hooking his thumb through a belt loop or pocket. Draco was quite embarrassed at how much the little touches affected him at times. Merlin, he was such a pervert.
“So you had no reason to start liking him?”
“You might want to close your eyes, I kind of forgot to grab some fresh clothes to put on.”
He looked down to see his arm wrapped over the man’s body and he could feel their legs intertwined with one another under the sheets. And most alarmingly he could feel the morning wood of his crotch nestled tightly up against Draco’s thigh.
“It’s quite odd to see Malfoy again. I’d presumed he was dead.” Hermione began, she swiftly placed two full English breakfasts in front of Ron and Harry, only to put some fruit salad in front of her space.
he’d seen his own erection before, but he wasn’t expecting to see it quite so hard in such a small amount of time.
- he wasn’t a young boy indoctrinated by his Father’s views anymore, but the prospect of leaving his wand in his room and making breakfast the muggle way was mildly infuriating.
Oh Merlin, Mia was just upstairs.
“I was taught English by a tutor, they were British, so I learnt to speak with a British accent.”
The aftermath however, was not quite so pleasant. All the memories from last night flooded into Harry’s head, and whilst the majority of them made him roaring for a round two – maybe even three. His stomach kept curling in an embarassed scream when he remembered calling himself a whore.
Ron was far worse at hiding his emotions, his face turning red with anger when Draco had even just stepped into the house.
“You mean like pay me in… sex.” Harry questioned, letting his head fall back against the wall.
Okay, so, Hermione was weirdly angry.
Something about… home… and sleep.
“I don’t know…”
“Fucking, please – fuck Draco!” Harry shouted incoherent murmurs of pleasure until suddenly, Malfoy’s head dropped down to meet the base of Harry’s cock, his erection hitting the back of Draco’s throat. “Fucking Merlin!” Harry screamed, trying to buck his hips up but being held down by Malfoy’s free hand.
“Are you just going to stand there or join me?”
“Oh Merlin.” Harry whispered. “What can we do about it?”
“It was complicated.”
“Yeah, Cath’s an absolute crackhead, right!” Cole joked, chucking his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulling him close. Harry was mildly uncomfortable with all the touching but Cole was obviously tipsy, so he let it slide.
They stayed pin still for another second. Draco was almost certain Harry was about to lean in and-
“What’s wrong?” Malfoy asked, a small frown set on his red face.
Harry grabbed a self-inking quill from his desk and wrote out a simple reply.
“What the bloody hell were you doing with that ferret!? The slimy git is disgusting! Do you not remember back at Hogwarts! He’s not even attractive!” Harry’s lips frowned at Ginny’s outbursts, what was she talking about? Malfoy wasn’t that bad. Harry even thought Malfoy was quite attractive. “You’re lucky to have gotten rid of him Harry. I can’t believe I almost convinced you to go crawling back to Malfoy.
He’ll learn to get better soon.
A huge wave of pleasure sent a shock wave through him.
“I’m not a prostitute Harry. But I’m…” Malfoy looked away from him to the opposite. “I’m a drug dealer.”
Harry whimpered at the feeling of emptiness.
“Hello Dobby.” Draco greeted the elf, who looked at him in confusion.
“Well…” Draco paused, shell-shocked. “I suppose, I would probably sleep with you…” Harry’s posture straightened, “But only, if like, I was going to die otherwise.”
“Obliviate.”
He ran his thumbs along the rim of his waistband, attempting, to give himself enough time to figure out how to take jeans off in a sexy way.
Draco moved to where Harry was sat, surprised at Harry’s extremely stiff posture. He had brought one of the blankets up to where his head was, in (what Draco assumed to be) a ridiculously bad effort at hiding himself.
“Maybe… But I liked watching you get jealous about my dates.”
“We’d better get some of this furniture set up then.” Mia prompted
“Fuck, Draco, I’m so fucking close!” Harry shouted, endlessly thrusting into Draco’s mouth, running into the cliff of his orgasm.
“Sorry.” He whispered in Cole’s direction. Cole furrowed his eyebrows.
Poor poor Harry. Draco really isn't very good with this pining thing.
In the distance, he saw Harry stood in front of the cooker, a saucepan in his hand, and behind him an array of breakfast foods on the table.
Sorry I missed the last update date, I unfortunately came down with the flu and have been wrapped up in bed for the past week.
“How about we head home now? It’s getting late.” Harry looked up to the sky. It must’ve been about nine pm already.
“Yes, like you said, I can afford it.” Harry reasoned, unsure where his sudden burst of confidence had appeared from.
Harry laughed and skated backwards for a metre (if he were honest, he couldn’t do much more than that).
I can hardly believe it! It's done!
“Really?”
But that only lasted for a few blissful seconds before her head came peeking out of the kitchen doorway.
Harry ran across the road towards the alley way, where, as he neared, he saw the silhouette of a lean, tall man. He ignored the general upset from the people around him who had no idea what was going on and strolled up to the alley, where he spotted a blond head of hair.
“Yes, put some bloody clothes on Malfoy.” Whilst Harry would be sad to see the blond’s skin put away, there were more pressing issues at the moment.
“Oh my Merlin, I love her new album as well! It’s so good!” Draco reached forward and grabbed Harry’s forearm like an over excited preteen. “Play it again! Play it again!”
Draco whimpered a mumbled “mmmhmmm” as response, hardly trusting his own voice box to work.
Why did Malfoy have this?
“So the real question here is: Was Draco faking it or is your dick really just that good?”
Draco’s fingertips slowly crept towards Harry’s hole, and even thought he’d been expecting it, he still let out a small squeal when the pad of Draco’s finger pressed against the small sensitive muscle. Draco watched his face for a moment.
He lifted his body up and over Draco, perching his hips between the spread legs and resting his head just above Draco’s. He stared down for a moment, his green eyes piercing.
He’d already spent a good half an hour deciding on what to wear and he still wasn’t sure if he’d picked well.
“Yeah I mean, I don’t hate the ferret any less, but I’ll give credit where it’s due because Merlin that man had the sex appeal of a god.” Harry let out a little chuckle at how they’d both thought exactly the same thing. “Wonder how much he makes a night?”
When he looked up, he saw Ginny watching him with warm eyes.
His hands moved to settle on Harry’s waist – they were shaking – fingerprints pressing lightly into his flesh, holding him firmly against the sofa as they softly, sweetly kissed. Then Draco’s mouth opened and his tongue swept slowly along Harry’s lower lip.
They had managed to cut his hair in a way that looked more rugged than straight up messy. Harry thought he would put some gel in his hair anyways, just to tie in the strands that even the spell couldn’t fix.
“Really.” Hermione couldn’t help but roll her eyes. “They’re less volatile with reactants and therefore will give you less trouble. But, if you want to take up potion brewing anytime soon, there’s always a chance for planting magical plants.”
Harry solemnly nodded. He couldn’t not help Malfoy after that.
A creek from the gate made both of their heads shoot towards the metal.
Draco knew he was being an arsehole, but he always was.
The bar tender turned around and started preparing the drinks, leaving Harry to survey the dance floor.
“I’m not naked or anything.” He replied.
Then Draco saw Damien step out from the corridor to go into Harry’s room.
“Shut up and eat your eggs.”
“You don’t need to lie to me Harry.” She moved closer to Harry, leaning her head to the side.
“Why not.”
“Why not?”
“Thank you, Harry!” Ron applauded, completely unaware of Harry’s sarcasm.
“Not even once.”
“It smells amazing in here.” Harry commented.
“I know, I know. It’s just hard to find a good plumber okay. I’ve got one coming round on Thursday.”
“Well, what do you want?” He asked, moving his fingers so that they ran in circles around Harry’s chest.
“What did you say your name was?” Narcissa asked, Draco cleared his throat.
“Can you please unwrap your legs from me, Harold.”
Just when Harry was about to give up and walk away, he saw that flash of platinum blond that he’d been waiting all night for.
“Oh, I don’t know, I just wasn’t sure if you were joking or not. Wouldn’t be unlike you to make up a long-winded plan to get back at me or something.” Malfoy stumbled. Harry lifted himself so he was standing upright and raised an eyebrow at Malfoy.
“Really? How much did it cost?”
Malfoy was silent.
Harry nodded.
The popcorn tea was decent.
“I’m Alex. You?”
“Oooooooh” The whole circle echoed. Harry was suddenly pushed out of his daze.
“No, I’m good thanks.” Harry declined, shimmying the shoe off of his foot and swapping to the other.
Malfoy stood still and small, watching Harry remove his shoes, his mouth still slightly parted.
“I’m- I – Sorry… I didn’t know you had someone-” Draco spluttered, trying to pick himself up from the floor to grab onto the door handle, but his legs were weak.
The pink fluorescent lights gleamed in his face- an overwhelming sense of déjà vu overcoming him. Slowly, he took a few steps closer to the club, luckily there was no queue to get in, only a bouncer who gave no more question than a side glance to Harry’s entrance when he wandered through.
“No!” Malfoy paniced. “I… I need the money.” Harry felt that like a stab in the chest, for a second he’d almost thought that…
Under the scrutiny of Harry’s gaze, Draco felt so exposed he almost regretted not putting a shirt on. He turned away slightly again, hating how his body responded to Harry’s eyes.
“Have you read this yet Mia?” Harry asked, thrusting the paper in her direction.
“No. I know I would never want to stay here.”
“How much longer do you reckon?”
“Yeah.”
“How come I never knew?”
“No! Tell me now, Malfoy.” Harry stood up, pointing a finger at Malfoy’s face. He felt some of his anger dissolve when he saw how wet Draco’s eyes were. “Please, you can trust me.”
“It was… good… like, really good.” Harry complimented, moving his seat in an attempt to shuffle his growing erection out of sight.
Harry chuckled.
Malfoy working downstairs in the basement and him upstairs in the attic.
“Yeah, I uhm.” Harry raised his hand to rub the back of his head. “Didn’t want you to see my, ya’know.” Harry nodded his head down to his crotch, causing Malfoy to raise an eyebrow. “But I wouldn’t, so you had to get some more rope and… sort of, tie my legs apart.”
“You sure?”
“I think- I think we should take it slowly.” Draco’s body deflated, “I still want to be with you, at some point, but I think we chucked ourselves into a relationship too fast. We never really had time to get to know each other.” Draco’s face was searching Harry’s.
Harry swallowed his pride and followed her into the kitchen. Her back was facing him and she was putting two teabags in two new cups.
“Don’t pretend you don’t want to.”
Harry never thought he would be so happy to feel a stinging hex.
Here have another chapter, more chapters for everyone.
“He always was good at getting your attention.”
“You don’t know what you’re saying.”
“Maybe you two need to be more careful.”
“What are you doing today then?” She asked, dropping down next to Harry.
“Could he not take his mother’s name?”
“Not long at all, it’s just a few cauldrons and ingredient shelves. So maybe like a hour, probably less.”
“To have everyone bringing you down for it.” Harry now directed his gaze to Molly. “I thought you were better than this, but you’re acting like a child. How dare you even talk to Draco like that when he’s done nothing but try and right his wrongdoings. But if you’re too far up your own arse to see that treating him like this is just as bad as whatever he did to you. Then you’re obviously not as kind and loving as I thought you were. Why can’t you just grow up!” Harry paused, now pointing around at everyone. “Why can’t all of you just grow up! Don’t think I didn’t notice that Draco is the only person sat here with less than ten presents, just like every single year, because the lot of you can’t accept that people change! I don’t expect you to bring him into the family with open arms, but some common curtesy would be bloody nice.”
“Bloody Hell.” Harry murmured as he bent down on his knees, scrambling his hand around on the floor to find his glasses. Once his hands were wrapped around the frame, he lifted them up and placed them back on his face.
“Yes.. yes I do.” Malfoy began to awkwardly twiddle with his fingers again. “Have a bed, that is.” Draco continued to make no move. If Harry didn’t know Draco was a prostitute, he’d probably think the boy had never had sex before.
Draco pushed himself away from the bed to the door, jarring it open just enough to look out.
Malfoy covered the shame on his face quickly.
“You were faking it!”
“Potter!” Malfoy screeched, thrusting his pelvis up to push Harry off of him, causing Harry to collapse onto the floor.
“Like who?”
Harry smiled, and the next time he lowered his fingers, he flicked his tongue out to taste the tip of Draco’s dick, collecting a drop of precum on the end. Draco felt a long whine in his throat when Harry repeated the motion again, this time keeping his fingers on Draco’s hole and lowering his lips to the crown of his cock.
“What do you suggest?” Malfoy asked.
. Not slow and sensual. That wasn’t them and it never would be.
Hermione was half asleep being checked by a mid-wife on the couch, her skin was so pale it almost looked see through with dark grey circles formed beneath her eyes. Ron was sat on the arm of the sofa and was rubbing his thumb over Hermione’s temple in a gesture so loving that it almost broke Harry’s heart.
“Don’t underestimate me, Potter.”
“Yeah, like going out to eat or something.”
“See you soon.” Mia waved.
“Really?”
When Draco glanced over to Harry, he saw that his eyes were still rested on Draco’s body.
Because he hadn’t been in more awe of something in his life.
Malfoy took a gulp of his tea.
“It’s no bother, it’s the least I could do.”
“You suppose?”
And with that, the two stood up and apparated to Harry’s house.
Another difference between the two men was that Damien had a far deeper voice, and now that Draco looked, he had two dimples lining his cheeks.
Once they were inside, his veins rapidly began to heat up in the warmth of the rink. The number of moving bodies in here would be enough to warm the place up alone.
“I asked who it was, not the time. It’s eleven am anyways, you imbec-”
“Mother of Merlin Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed, he could hardly belive his ears. Let alone the fact that he really did like the idea that Malfoy would be hard all day for him.
Harry hoped it would be all. Harry hoped Malfoy would nod and they would move on. Smash the metal box and leave everything behind them.
“It’s absolutely insane, I mean I didn’t believe you when you said you were actually going to fix this place up, and it only took you like -what- a month, two months?”
Harry on the other hand was left standing there, trying to figure out whether that had actually just happened or whether Alex had killed him and he was in the afterlife.
“They’ll all love you, but I invited a few more people that really liven it up a bit more. They should be here around about now, actually.” Cole rambled, letting his gaze dart off around the room.  “Let’s go chat.” Cole suggested, grabbing Harry’s hand and tugging him in the direction of Catherine.
“Draco.” He mumbled even lower. Draco made no movement, the soft woosh of his breath silently filling the room.
“So are you gonna do it?” Hermione asked, a bright sparkle shining in her eye. Harry couldn’t help but smile at her excitement.
Now, Harry wasn’t an observant man. He knew that. He’d known he had a weakness in his observational skills since the very start of Hogwarts. But he’d walked down this street a thousand times, and he certainly never remembered a barber’s shop on the corner. Or that petrol station. Or even the diner lit up with neon lights.
Cole had decided to ambush Harry’s inner peace with ‘follow your heart’.
“Okay then.” Harry replied and lifted up the bed sheet, pulling his body into the bed side. He laid on his side and stared at the wall as he felt the dip of Malfoy’s body in the bed. Even as Harry tried to lean away from Malfoy, leaving a gap in the bed between them, the man’s heat radiated over to him.
After a few more hours of ogling the house, Mia left, leaving Harry and Hermione to begin working on the renovation. By nine pm, they had managed to tear up all of the carpets, arranged for a masonry worker to come in and evaluate the strength of the walls and had managed to steam off some of the disgusting wallpaper that lined each room.
Harry mouth fell open in a laugh for a moment. A wide smile coated his face. “Am I wrong, or are you flirting with me?” He giggled, cutting a few more layers off the man’s head.
When Harry entered the house, he could tell that it was a big party that he’d anticipated. Every room was crowded with bodies, each corner taken up by couples and far too many flashing lights for Harry’s mind to understand.
“Are you just going to knock on the door?” Harry asked, wondering if there were any other procedures to get in the manor.
“Okay” Harry agreed, causing a beaming smile to line Ginny’s face. “But what about you?” surely Ginny couldn’t just go into a gay bar if she was straight, right?
But the next question was whether he should do it now or wait until morning?
The skin on the small of Harry’s back tingled when Draco’s fingers ran over it, the small peachy hairs standing on end. Draco’s tantalising fingers moved lower once again, until his thumb was rested onto the waistband of Harry’s underwear. Harry threaded his fingers into Draco’s hair and let out a breath of air when Draco’s hand slipped beneath the fabric to grope at Harry’s arse, the contact made Harry thrust his hips forward, pressing their erections against each other again, allowing a small amount of friction to trickle through their bodies with a whine.
“But they might.”
Of course, he had the signature bleach blond hair (despite it being obscenely greasy), but the rest of him was almost so revolting Draco wondered how Harry had slept with the man. He had grimy skin, with streaks of dirt periodically spaced out. He was short (maybe 5’4) and stout, with broad shoulders and a port belly (which was almost definitely from excessive alcohol consumption). His fingers were bulky like a troll’s, with overgrown, fungus-ridden fingernails and he had a very large, oversized bump on the bridge of his nose.
It made Harry wonder what else he could be hiding.
“What do you want?”He asked again.
“Who’s Alex?”
Harry did so, and when he finished the short riff this time, Draco’s smile made it worth the embarrassment.
“Okay then.”
Malfoy shot Harry a disgusted stare.
Draco turned to look at him, a small gasp on his mouth.
“Oh, yeah. Okay.” He turned and walked into the break room.
“I love you.” He mumbled, smiling at Draco’s gasp- he’d probably thought Harry had fallen asleep.
“Perhaps it would be best.”
“Oh. Don’t worry, have a good afternoon.” Mia waved her away, watching the gate close behind her.
Here, he wasn’t famous, he could go anywhere he wanted without being stopped and asked to give out his signature. He found it odd how quickly he’d adjusted, especially considering how settled he was back in his time. He was about to marry Ginny for Merlin’s sake, and he felt horrible for saying it, but getting stuck 25 years in the past gave him a sick sense of relief. He didn’t really even want to marry Ginny; he’d been convinced to do it out of obligation more than anything.
Their kiss grew more lustful, each slither of tongue having more power and the smack of their lips gaining volume until Draco’s fingers slipped underneath the thin fabric of Harry’s shirt, greedily running over the muscled flesh. In response Harry brought his hands up and slowly began to unbutton the front of Malfoy’s shirt.
The whole room was dead silent, everyone paying rapt attention to the two men. Harry squirmed slightly, uncomfortable by it all, before he felt Malfoy’s tongue run over his bottom lip. Gasping, he unintentionally opened his mouth up to the other man. The feeling of Malfoy’s hot and heavy tongue in his mouth intoxicated him, making his cheeks grow warm and his head swim lightly. In his dizzy state, he allowed Malfoy to push him down onto the floor, his hair splaying out around him.
After all, Hermione and Ron were about to have a baby. They were going to be a family. They didn’t need Harry to be slouching around on their couch every single day, they needed to be on their own.
Harry cleared his foggy mind and with a whip of magic, the two were stood in the centre of Harry’s flat.
He wiped it quickly, swallowed the lump in his throat and pretended it hadn’t happened. Then it’s twin fell from the other eye just as quickly. His hands caught it, not letting the water last in the air for even a moment. But then another fell, and another, and another until his hands couldn’t possibly catch them all at once.
He put his hand on the doorknob, took a deep breath and twisted.
Harry looked down to the bed sheets and lifted them up with one fearful hand, only to see that his underpants were absolutely covered in sticky, white stains.
Harry doesn’t know how long they lie there like that, sweaty and sprawled, until he becomes aware of how much his breath has slowed.
“You sure you wanna do this?”  Harry asked, pulling away from Draco and looking at him in a way that made him want to melt.
He was getting close to Malfoy’s alley now, maybe three more minutes.
“Come along.” Harry waved his hand over to the staircase and began making his way up, carefully opening the door.
Suddenly, the idea of walking to the kitchen seemed like a great distraction from his thoughts. He needed to stop thinking about Harry. A nice, tall cup of water would be the perfect thing for the glass shards in his throat.
Harry watched the enchanted photo repeating. Malfoy resting against a lamp post, a young woman giving him a bag filled with galleons, Malfoy’s small but loud wink.
Harry closed his eyes when a twinge of pain echoed through his body, but it was numbed within a few seconds as Malfoy paused. Harry opened his eyes again and was almost punched when he looked up to see Malfoy’s expression.
“Draco, again. He convinced me to move out here after telling me about how much better the potions trade here was or something like that. I didn’t think much about it, I was quite excited by the thought of getting out of France, I also still had quite a fancy for Draco at this point, so I followed him over.” A sigh fell from Cole’s lips.
Draco voice box suddenly kicked back in and he remembered how to talk.
“A’ight, I get it. Yer straight, I believe you. Does that mean ‘arry ‘ere is free game?”
“No. I’m quite tired.” Malfoy’s eyes were glued to the bed. “Do you have a sleeping bag or couch or something?”
Draco’s eyes met Harry, and Harry almost choked at the sight. How had he never seen how pretty Draco’s eyes are before? Draco chuckled.
“Really?”
Harry picked it up and surely enough, written in swirling black ink was Polyjuice potion.
“No, but I have a spare shirt you could use?”
“Uncross your legs?”
“You feeling better?” He asked. Harry nodded. He bit his lip.
Harry kept his eyes shut, but the voice was getting closer to him at an alarming speed.
“What?”
“What are you talking about? What was wrong with that time turner?” Harry sat up on his arms, looking past Malfoy’s knee to see the other half of the time turner fragments left on the floor.
His laugh built until he was full on snorting and clutching his stomach in pain, he absently noticed that Draco was doing the same, the both of them spread out on the floor in hysterics. Harry hooted on an exhale of breath, wiping away tears.
Harry pushed his hands up into Draco’s hair and pulled him in closer, closing his teeth down onto Draco’s lip in a soft bite. He was sure he heard a tiny whimper pour from Draco’s mouth. Draco pushed his tongue inside Harry’s mouth and ran it around like some form of torture.
“I heard she was doing well in the league.”
Draco responds with a broken “nng” and immediately fiddles with the fabric, trying to pull them down, but the position makes it a bit awkward. Harry doesn’t mind, instead he swivels them over so that Draco is laid beneath him and he pulls the fabric down. Easily letting his hands fall to Draco’s waist, around to cup his arse, squeezing.
Thanks for reading :) xx
“Genuinely not much.” Harry muttered; his eyes practically boring into his pint glass.
“Is that all you’ve been hiding.” Harry asked, he could accept Draco for this. It would be hard but, they would work it out. He could see how Malfoy got sucked up into this, and at least he had stopped, all for Harry.
“Draco Malfoy.” He repeated.
So, when Harry’s lips wrapped around the stained flesh, Draco’s chest arched towards him accompanied by a long whimper. Everything about the image of Harry circling his tongue around the nipple over and over again was erotic, it was almost as pleasurable as the sensation itself.
“I trusted you!” Harry lifted his forefinger to point at Malfoy. “I thought you’d changed.”
Harry looked down at the tent in his trousers, he supposed he could just leave it, pretend it wasn’t there and take a cold shower, but he hadn’t had an actual wank in far longer than a man should abstain from. He hadn’t wanked since the last time he’d had sex, now he thought about it. He had always thought it was sad for a fully grown adult to have to resort to wanking but – why not?
“Some sort of output. I mean, I’m about to turn potions into my job. So, I’ve kind of lost it as a hobby, really.”
After a few minutes when he finally felt comfortable enough to pull his head back to face Malfoy, he saw the blond looking at him with sad eyes. Except, now that Harry could see him up close, he could see that they didn’t have the same life hidden behind them as they used to.
“No.”
Harry moved to unbutton his own shirt, but he was quickly stopped by Draco’s strong hands, which swiftly ripped the shirt open, buttons flying around the room. Harry gasped but didn’t care one bit, instead it made his cock begin to fill even furthur.
. Malfoy - the richest twat in Hogwarts - was a now a prostitute. It seemed more likely that Dumbledore would release a sex tape than Malfoy become a rentboy.
Harry also told himself he was seeing things when Malfoy’s eyes appeared to rake over Harry’s exposed chest.
“Your house is bloody miles away, Potter, and I’m not in the mood to speak to the Weaselette. Let’s just pop into St. Mungos.”
“So…” Malfoy began, eyes finally breaking their intensity to shoot around the room. “What are we?”
“You don’t have to do that dare, but I will give you a new dare that could be fifty times worse than the first, and you have to do it. There are no take backs.” Malfoy explained, eye’s turning dark and his smirk growing wider.
“Harry, please.” He begged, chucking his hands into Harry’s hair and tugging on the black strands.
“Shhh.” Malfoy interupted, catching Harry’s open mouth up in a second kiss.
“You want to see that?” Malfoy squinted his eyes at Harry. “I thought you hated potions.”
"N-no, Daddy, just for you.", Draco had to smile, turning Potter around with a swift flip.
"Pathetic. Simply pathetic. Do you Death Eaters think you are bringing some pride to your names by allowing a lunatic to command you in this way? Look at the pompous and proud Lord Malfoy lying at the foot of something that cannot even be called a man. Like trash. Like shit."
He stepped off the blonde, listening to a groan suffered by the loss of heat.
"The Lord asked you to do that?"
Again the head nodding a "no", but not a word.
"There was no other way, Draco. Don't worry. Now we have the rest of our lives.", The brunette blushed. "That is, if you want me."
"YES. Avoid accidents like today."
He moaned and begged and whimpered, too sensitive but not wanting to stop, they were so close, so so close…
"Given by the Dark Lord, who also ordered me to bring the food to the prisoner. Or do you want to go check with the Lord?", Draco knew very well how to use the situation in his favor. The brunette snorted a laugh, imagining the guard's face.
"A toast to Hufflepuff!"
Potter may have lost his words, as he just nodded again. Draco finally sealed his lips in a chaste kiss. Then he started kissing her eyes, cheeks, forehead, nose, until Potter was laughing softly. He climbed on top of the brunette, who put his legs around his hips, and continuing his shower of kisses, went down to Potter's neck. There, feeling more instigated, he left a hickey that would leave a beautiful purple mark. Then he went lower and lower, reaching Potter's nipples, and sucking, licking and nibbling, feeling the brunette's hands get caught in his hair and his body arch.
"Guess who."
The game resumed, and they both had to answer some truths, no one wanting to break the show for a dare. When Harry was finally ready again, he just launched himself to the floor, his ass full of Draco's cock, and started to rock against him. He moaned loudly, not caring if he looked like a cheap whore, Draco's cock was too good to not have inside him.
Draco bit back a moan, then clasped Potter's waist and grinded his ass down against his cock again. The room was silent, and Draco took off Potter's underwear, gripping his ass and opening him to the crowd of voyeurs.
At the moment, Harry couldn't hear anything but the noise of blood running in his ears. The demon of fate had decided. Harry wasn't going to reach adulthood, and he would be okay with that if his life so far had not been a succession of disasters and death.
"Severus, I…", The other man removed a mask that Draco knew very well. He felt his heart go cold.
"Hm. Two months and three weeks ago when I left Hogwarts to clear my head, I ended up Apparating to Malfoy Mansion. Things happened, we… um, we talked and I spent the night there. Anyway, it doesn't matter.", Harry's nervous laugh made Granger look suspicious at them, and Draco hoped his face wasn't as red as he felt he was. Her understanding look said that his plea had been in vain. "Do you know where Sirius is?"
"So you walked around like this just to see if anyone would fuck you in front of the whole school?", Potter looked away, blushing tinting his cheeks. "Answer me, whore."
"Enough, enough! Mr. Potter, should I remind you that you are in public?", The scolding came from Madam Pomfrey, but they didn't even care, smiling at each other.
"You call what we did that night of friendship…", Seeing the blonde's cheeks take on a pinkish colour was worth everything. "But it took a while to realize what, or who Dumbledore is. He knew that Sirius was not guilty, and yet he let him stay twelve years in Azkaban. And when he left, he left him stuck in the place he hates the most in the world. And not to mention all that he put me through all these years."
The blonde backed off. Potter was panting, his cock giving little spasms of pleasure, his eyes unfocused. But not enough for Draco. He lowered his mouth over him, but now wetting his balls until the saliva that came out of his mouth fell on the mattress and spread across Potter's ass. He withdrew again, listening to the other's growl of despair. He laughed. Kneeling on the bed, and pulling the brunette's hips until he was almost bent in half, and placed his legs above his shoulders. His hole was wet with saliva, pulsing with the urge to be filled by something. And Draco knew exactly what to do.
"Yes."
"MILORDE!", Draco's father's voice was heard, and he launched himself at the man's feet. Draco laughed, and everyone turned to him.
"Milord…"
"Yes…Oh, so good…"
The game begins.
Looking under his lids drooping with desire, Harry saw Draco tremble, fear and lust filling his gray eyes.
Draco's last step was to enter his own communal.
It wasn't long until he was again spilling himself, this time for the rest of the room to watch. He then rest himself against Draco's torso and breathing hard, turned to the blond and kissed him.
"I wouldn't call you anything else. Potter.", They kissed again, rolling over the bed and messing up the blankets. Draco started to bite and suck on Harry's neck before going down his tanned body. Harry's fingers flew to the blond strands as soon as he was aligned with his dick.
"What?", Pansy's voice was shaky, and Draco turned to her.
Potter's body was limp against him, only little twitches of the orgasm making him move. His insides were still milking Draco, coaxing him to another hard-on.
"My orders are…"
"Dare."
Draco exchanged a look with his mother, but followed the Lord through the corridors. Halfway there, he already knew they were going to the dungeons. The door opened, and Draco felt a relief run through his veins when he saw Harry still physically well.
"A toast to Gryffindor!"
He looked down again, relishing the sight of despair evident on his lover's face.
"What?", When Draco didn't answer, Harry put his fingers around his neck, feeling the rest of the lubricating spell make his hands more slippery. "Did you say something, puppy?"
"Potter, truth or dare?", She was planing something, Draco could feel under his skin.
"Draco, what happened to your clothes? The nargles are dizzy.", He held her by the shoulders.
"Suck.", And Hardy sucked. He cat licked the rest of the cum and had the length inside his mouth, but not the full thing. Then Draco forced him some more, his cock starting to fill again, reaching the back of Harry's mouth. He gagged, eyes burning. There were tears falling in his face, but his eyes were still turned to the back of his head.
Almost.
And Harry came back on top of Draco, now facing him, and wiped away the tears that smeared his face with his tongue. Holding the blonde's cock, he slowly descended the length of the member, placing it all inside him. He threw his head back, moaning long and languidly, and heard something coming from beneath him.
Maybe Harry shouldn't have laughed, but...
Harry fell tired on top of the blonde, and with a murmur, the bonds in his hands were gone.
"Draco?"
"Yes. And no. There are ways to destroy them. As you know, I am a double agent. But not for the Dark Lord."
Potter eagerly opened his mouth, and Draco guided his dick to his lips until they closed around him. Starting with a shallow and easy pace, Draco soon grabbed Potter's hair to push himself into the heat of his throat, feeling it pulse around him.
The iron door opened, and Harry saw Draco come in with a tray with clearly more food than the other Death Eaters brought.
"Enough. We are not going to talk about it, what happened, happened. And we're not going to have much more time, right?", Draco shook his head and pushed the tray towards Harry, who took a spoon and started eating. "Tell me, how are things out there?"
The bed was in the middle of the room, and the moonlight would probably have looked beautiful against the blond hair spread over the black silk sheets. Harry released his breath and walked over to the bed.
Harry didn't hear anything else. He was alone.
"Can you explain to me how, even with Dumbledore dead, we are losing?", Draco had done it? He made a sound in the back of his throat.
"Potter? What are you doing in my room?", His blue eyes closed, suspicious. But Harry must have been in some kind of wave of power, as the wand flew across the room. He got into bed, kneeling beside the blonde. Now he looked scared, his eyes wide. Harry perhaps owed him some explanation for breaking in that way.
Draco led the Slytherins to the front of the gates, the younger ones behind them.
"Dare.", Damn idiotic Gryffindor! He fell into her web, the wench.
In the end, Draco came inside Potter, and put the plug back on to secure his cum would be inside him.
"Yes. Five times will suffice."
"Sounds fun. That's your new dare, Draco."
Harry was positively fed up.
The two Death Eaters left the room, snarling at having to follow orders. Mr. Malfoy himself left, and Draco turned to the brunette in seconds.
He would worship his body. Every corner.
Yes, because they knew each other in their own way, because Draco had changed his worldview so drastically, because he couldn't imagine his life without that equal opponent, that person who returned everything he gave and demanded in equal intensity.
Draco smiled. He pet the unruly hair, and pulled the boy against his thigh again.
"You have no idea... Your magic seems to call me. It's delicious, it makes me hard just to feel it.", As if to prove the point, Harry grinded his erection on the blonde's thigh. "How many times have I not had to go to a bathroom to take care of this after arguing with you... You drive me crazy, Malfoy."
It was Hell.
"Draco! What are you doing? Get out of there!", Harry should be happy for the cell to cancel any kind of spell? Because Bellatrix's eyes were betraying an enormous desire to send a Crucio towards Harry. Draco shot him one last look, his face expressionless, but Harry could read him.
The coffin was brought to the center, and opened. Harry left, staggering and falling to the floor. Draco tried to go to him but someone stopped him.
Perhaps he was not quiet enough to close the door, because when he got close to the bed a wand was pointed at his forehead.
He went up and down on his cock, moaning like a bitch in heat, his own cock bouncing in rhythm. The room was filled with Potter's lust filled voice, the wet dirty sound coming from his ass and muffled whimpers and sighs coming from the rest of the room.
"If I explain to you, will you shut up and eat me up at once?", The blonde didn't comment, just nodded. "Dumbledore said I have to die. It's the only way to end this shit. There is a prophecy, and I know that if you tell your father early in the morning he will be so happy that he might end up saying that he loves you. Now, can you please take off all these clothes? What kind of person sleeps in silk pajamas?"
Harry didn't exactly follow what was said, but then Draco was coming off of him, and he whimpered at the loss.
With a little more movement, he felt Potter's cock against his thigh. Sighing, he went to the brunette's ear.
By his side, Pansy did some kind of victory dance.
Lying on the bed, he waited for the brunette to return, missing his warmth amid the cold sheets. When Potter returned, he lay on his back, still naked, and put an arm over his eyes. Draco lay on his side, his head resting on his bent arm.
“It’s decided! To the Leaky, we go.” Malfoy clapped his hands together, jumping up from his seat.
“I’m a gay man, Potter. Of course I listen to Britney Spears.”
“Is that a buttered croissant?” Draco’s voice piped up again.
“How come you don’t have an accent?” Harry perplexed, leaning forward slightly.
“What your feeling now Harry, is completely normal.”
“I want you to fuck me.” Harry mumbled. Draco’s finger paused.
“Oh.”
“What teas do you have?” Draco asked.
“I haven’t seen one of them in years.”
“Fucking please!” Harry begged again, aware that he must’ve sounded like a whore.
“Fine.” Harry accepted, not wanting to have to argue with the group about it. “Truth.” He answered, he did not want to embarrass himself even more. Pansy’s eyes dimmed slightly.
Draco ignored him and continued squinting.
So, Harry chose to distract himself by pulling his house plans out of his bag and beginning to work on them.
“Apologise for what?”
“Faster Harry, faster.” Malfoy cried out, using all the strength he had to speed up the incessant bobs of his own legs, pleasure taking over him all the way down to his bones. Draco grabbed his own cock and began beating it off to the same rhythm as Harry’s thrusts. “Fuck me hard Harry.” Draco screamed. The sound of skin slapping skin was already so loud that it almost seemed drowning in the large basement.
“I don’t know! But it’s not there.” Malfoy pulled on his hair again, his breath coming out in shallow grunts.
“So… no sex?” Draco asked, Harry felt his ears bristle with heat.
Harry opened his eyes to see the same muddy owl sat on his windowsill, violently pecking away at the glass. Harry had had enough of getting woken up by random owls.
“You’re gorgeous Harry. Absolutely gorgeous.” Draco stroked Harry’s chest, Harry could see Draco’s eyes drooping slightly. He looked exhausted.
Of course, Malfoy had kissed him before but, those kisses were always lustful, heated and deep. He’d only kissed him when the two were about to have sex. What has just happened, that was nothing more than a chaste peck, one that a lover would give to their partner. Harry felt his heart leap at the thought.
With half a thought, Harry removed the magic cock ring, leaving the blonde free of the only thing that kept him from reaching the limit. He sat down just one more time, and while his hole filled with cum until Draco was almost dry, he also came. Long lines of cum flew, hitting Draco in the face and chest.
Severus Snape was dead.
Getting on the Hogwarts Express was almost a dream. Harry had not imagined that he would be alive now to do that again, but here he was, holding hands with Draco Malfoy, in a cabin that was a mix of all the houses.
When Harry Potter started to wear makeup, nobody noticed at first. He had such a pretty face already. But when the Gryffindor Patil Twin screamed "Harry, is that EYELINER?" in the middle of lunch, everybody started taking notice.
Draco approached, his eyes trained on the floor, and he knelt in front of the bars. Harry saw him look back at the door that was now closing and finally finally looking him in the eye.
Sirius entered the room in his dog form only to find his godson on his knees between his boyfriend's legs. He let out a howl and ran away, leaving an extremely embarrassed young couple behind.
He took off the toy harshly, shutting Potter with a hand in front of his mouth and entering him with only his own spit as lube.
Voldemort and Nagini.
"A very interesting and efficient little trick, don't you think?", Potter spoke, while removing his pants, and released his cock, red and with veins jumping such excitement.
His hand on his arm stopped him. He looked up, meeting Severus' startled eyes.
"Don't tell me. You know, everyone always talks about how kind and generous you are, headmaster. But in all the years that I was at Hogwarts, even when someone needed your help, their assistance was always vague and ultimately useless. I think it's time to end this reign of pretended kindness and generosity with reservations.", He raised his wand. "Ava…"
The battle was completely on the ground at Hogwarts now, spells flying through the air. Draco felt his racing heart flutter when he saw Slytherins side by side with Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws.
Yeah, today's the day.
"They're for you, daddy.", Potter said, his hips moving against Draco's dick.
"DRACO!"
"Good then. I'll do it, but if someone ask…", Severus raised his own wand, and the director opened his eyes a little. "You should have protected them better. AVADA KEDRAVA!"
"D-Daddy…", the blond had to look up, the shallow breaths coming from the beautifully painted lips.
"I'm proud of you. And we will be able to have a wing just for us in Grimmauld after the renovations."
"Please, Daddy, let me suck your cock?? Please, please? Let me taste it?", Draco snorted, the look in Potter's eyes far too innocent for the situation.
Taking a deep breath, he stood up. A Horcrux was still missing and he didn't know what it was. Nothing more could be done.
Dumbledore stayed every other day at school, still looking for Harry. Draco would tell him where the brunette was, but besides making sure that it only served to move things faster, he knew that it wasn't just Harry who was at risk.
"POTTER!"
He was already a dead boy walking.
"No."
Harry was in the dungeons of the Malfoy mansion. He had been dropped there, and that, if his accounts were right, was two months ago. He didn't understand why the fuck Voldemort didn't go down there and finish the job at once, but at least he couldn't complain about the "comforts" of the dungeon.
Harry threw his head back, laughing like never before. He was at home.
And he hated every minute of it.
If he was in the rain (literally, the sky seemed to fall on his shoulders and the lightening seemed to chase him), he might as well get wet. If he was going to die, he could also put all those wishes and dreams into action.
Harry had no idea where he had been, but he was coming back. He opened his eyes, looked around. Draco was dueling with Voldemort, and everyone was standing without speaking or doing anything.
Game nights with the Eighth Years was always an Event with capital E.
"So you wouldn't settle for anything less than the best dick, huh?", He grinded his already hard dick against Potter's virtually naked ass, the skit going up and revealing… "Knickers. Of course you'd wear knickers, like the bitch in heat you are."
"Shhhhhh.", Harry was startled by the hoarse voice that came out. "You don't worry, okay? I'm fine."
"Look at me.", The blonde whispered, seeing the green eyes focus on him. Without thinking twice, he took the almost hard member in his mouth, feeling it grow stiffer and moaning around him. He let coherent thoughts get out of his head, and let instincts take over. Her lover's strangled groans echoed through the room.
"Draco. I came here for this. I just... I appreciate you taking care of me yesterday. It was more than I expected…"
He growled, Potter's eyes were looking up at him with surprise, pinned against the stone wall by Draco's hands in his wrists.
"Then get on with it.", With one last smirk, Potter murmured a spell and his eyes went to the back of his head. Draco curiously threaded his fingers to the creack of the others ass and felt it slicked with lube. He got two fingers in easily, the hole magically stretched making a wet sound and oozing more lube.
In one of these, the member touched that exact spot that caused shocks throughout his nervous system. Despite having found his prostate with his fingers, having a dick stretching his entrance at the same time, made it seem as if he had taken a Crucio, where instead of pain, pleasure spread to the smallest nerve cell. For a few more times, he did just that, his eyes rolling and closing in front of such pleasure.
The noise of the director's body falling over the chair was extremely anti-climatic. Draco was shaking.
They were both sweaty, their bodies hot and dirty. When Draco slipped out, Harry shivered with the amount of semen coming out of him.
"I know that, and I also know that just apologizing will not solve anything. But I apologize, and I would also like to learn more about the Muggle world. I don't want to continue to be prejudiced just because my father was. If I want to be with Harry, I have to deserve it."
"What time is it?", Potter's voice was hoarse, and the blonde tried not to care about the shiver she gave him.
"So you won't see any problem begging for my cock, would you?", he left Potter, seeing him shiver with the loss of contact. Leaning elegantly against the other wall, Draco pulled his dick out of his pants, pumping it slowly.
It was no big surprise when, two months later, Hogwarts resumed its school year. Draco's father had been arrested and convicted, his mother lived in a property in France, and Draco had sold the mansion in order to renovate Grimmauld Place. Sirius (who had been absolved of his wrongful sentence, and was now a free man) and Remus had themselves moving there, sleeping in the master bedroom and although Harry and Draco had separate bedrooms, they could easily be found in each other's arms in the morning.
"Harry.", The name came out as a sob.
It was delicious, the heat and the way Potter still held him. But it was more beautiful to see the long fingers stick to the sheets, discounting the pleasure he felt. Dropping the brunette's face, he traced a line through his arms, until he joined his fingers and started to move.
"No! I mean... if the Dark Lord commands. You may come in."
He tried to move and touch it again, but found his hands pinned to the bed.
"You…", Draco was interrupted by the door opening suddenly. Bellatrix's hateful voice echoed.
"Shhhh. I just need you to spend tonight with me, and tomorrow... tomorrow you can do whatever you want. Take me to your father, or hand me over to your Lord at once. Merlin knows that your family is going to need it after tonight's fiasco."
"Draco! I said Draco!"
When he could barely take it anymore, and knew he would come anytime, Harry stopped moving, Draco's cock completely inside him, his internal muscles being the only stimulus other than the heat that enveloped his puppy's member.
All of this, of course, were the only interesting things that happened. Draco almost zoned out for a while, until he heard Pansy saying Potter's name.
"Ready. You're really going to make me scream, right?"
As if programmed, Harry's knees failed, but Draco held him. Wrapping his arms around the brunette to pick him up like a bride, Draco turned his back on the Lord.
"One week.", The Lord's voice was final, and Draco knew he would have no way of arguing. He lowered his head. Harry looked like he was about to cry, and Draco smiled at him. It was what was left, the last thing he could do.
"TREASON!", Someone shouted after him.
Draco raised his Occlumency walls.
"I wanted you to stop talking!", Voldemort shouted, putting more power into his spell. But it made no difference, not when Harry was beside him, feeding Draco's magic in a way he never thought possible.
There were sighs, and Draco deemed necessary show himself also. He opened his pants, and his dick popped out completely hard. There were more sighs when he positioned his cock between Potter's ass-cheeks.
"Draco. Even if I escape, it will only postpone the inevitable.", That's what he said to himself, every day he went to sleep and he still hadn't died. Postpone the inevitable.
"No one takes cock like me, Malfoy.", The pure pride into this statement made Draco grip harder into his waist. He growled.
Draco froze, but followed his mother into the dining room. The Lord was seated at the head of the table, the place where Draco's father had sat, and the rightful place that Draco would one day sit. But not with that crazy man in power.
Soon, Potter was arching his back, his now free cock finally spilling his seed into Draco's shirt. The crowd was silent, only the pathetic sounds breaking the sensual atmosphere.
He stood up, staggering as he looked at Harry's body. And he pointed his wand at Voldemort.
Harry was crying.
"Draco, no!", Harry was clinging to the railings, one hand outstretched as if he wanted to reach him. "It's not worth it."
"Next time you want to try something new, just tell me, you coward. Or do you like to take cock like this into your cowardly ass? Like the bitchy sissy you are?"
He finally arrived in the room where the trail ended. He took a deep breath. And he opened the door.
"But, Draco", Pansy said, fake innocence in her voice, "you are not completing the dare."
"So big, Draco…", Potter moaned into his neck, breath shallow and hot. And Draco knew it wasn't only a compliment in the heat of the moment. He was way bigger than average, and it was, sometimes, a pain in the ass, pun not intended.
Two Death Eaters entered the room, but Draco got up and stood between them and Harry.
When Harry and Draco's spell finally hit the snake man in the chest, his body fell to the floor, empty and lifeless.
"Right. Potter?"
As if reading his thoughts, the door opened, and Narcissa stopped under the door frame. Her rigid posture and the small frown on her forehead were the only signs that something was not right.
"Malfoy.", Draco looked at the boy bouncing on him, his red face and glazed eyes and pink lips. "Truth or dare?"
She was the only distant cousin he allowed himself to approach. The only one he trusted.
"Sure!"
The Dark Lord never stood a chance.
Before they both could disentangle themselves, a voice spoke up.
"Come on, Draco!", The blonde smiled wickedly. Harry Potter was lying on his bed in the middle of the night, wearing only his muggle pants and nothing else, and still desperate for him. Draco had every intention of making the other boy go crazy before that night was over, and although he didn't quite understand why he was there (since, for sure, there should be hundreds of fans and friends who would be more willing than ever to fuck the hero of the wizarding world) he would use every minute with him. He got rid of the fingers in his hair, opened his Muggle pants and found a Muggle underwear. He laughed.
"Not for long. I want to get you out of here, but I can't even leave the mansion, and I already begged my mom... For her to…"
"Potter, wait a minute! What are you doing? What are you talking about?"
Suddenly, Potter lifted his legs from the blonde's shoulders, pulled himself on top of him and with a fluid movement he returned to Draco's lap, wiggling his ass. Their lips touched, and when a moan came out their teeth collided, and Draco just wanted to throw Potter on the bed and fuck him until the sun came up. But the brunette didn't seem inclined to let him do whatever he wanted, at least not now. He pulled away, and put his ass, still wet from the rimming, right in Draco's line of sight.
Remus couldn't help but laugh.
"Malfoy. Why are you here?", Malfoy senior or Malfoy junior?
"What about we have Potter make Draco come with his mouth and have Draco make Potter come with his fingers?"
Harry's scar hurt, and he hoped he wouldn't be around all night.
"ENOUGH!", The voice was heard even before the Lord arrived on the ground. An iron coffin was brought in and Draco wanted to cry.
Almost losing Sirius, dueling Voldemort in person, and discovering that he was going to die for this war to end had taken a heavy toll.
"Are you on Dumbledore's side?"
And finally, FINALLY, their lips met in a kiss, which was applauded by everyone inside the infirmary. Harry laughed and pulled Draco on top of him.
But tonight... tonight.
Draco kissed his hands.
Draco woke up a few hours later, happy to still find the sky dark and the brunette in his arms. A quick Tempus informed him that it was still three in the morning, and that they had almost four hours before anyone woke up in the house.
"Oh, I'm not?", The blond chuckled darkly. His fingers were inside Harry in no time, pressing his prostate, feeling the cum still inside him. Harry came, and came again, and again. His prostate was being milked and then his mouth was being filled and he was in paradise. His body used, he dropped to the floor, only to be picked up by gentle hands that carried him outside of the Commons.
Oh, shit.
Pansy and Blaise were with them, talking to Draco about the subjects they were going to take this year. Luna and Ginny were talking animatedly to Neville and his Hufflepuff girlfriend Hannah Abbot. Ron, Hermione and Harry discussed the renovations that were going to be done at the old Black house, and everything was fine.
"Silence, bitch. My proposal is... If you kill Dumbledore, the bitch will not die slowly as I have planned. If you are successful, he will only die for the spell that should have killed you years ago. Painless."
For what seemed like the hundredth time, Harry prayed for any higher being to keep everyone, but mostly Draco, safe.
"Crazy. Dumbledore is still looking for you. Black was nearly arrested twice for breaking into Death Eaters' houses. Hogwarts will be opened again in two weeks.", With a sigh, the blonde threw his head back. "And I am to take the Dark Mark as soon as the Dark Lord conquers Hogwarts and kill Dumbledore."
"He is dead.", The look that Luna gave him was shocked and sad.
This time, when he came, Draco came too, his cum filling Harry so good.
"Draco. I need you to pay attention.", The blonde stood up, still with his head down. "Have you heard about Horcruxes?"
The fuck was hard and fast, Potter was just a toy for him to use as he pleased. And the brunette took it, moaning into Draco's hand until his mouth was filled with three of the blond's fingers and he eagerly sucked on them.
Things were moving around the mansion. Harry felt that. Something big has happened.
"Did your father not tell you?", Harry gave a bitter laugh. Lucius Malfoy had escaped the Ministry, and would probably face the fury of his beloved Lord. "I'm dead, Malfoy."
"If we're going to do this, and if it's going to be real... Better put a muffiato." Harry laughed softly, desire forming a puddle in his lower abdomen. He murmured the spell.
"My lord, we were betrayed by young ones."
"Yes.", The redness in Weasel's and Granger's face was worth it. The game kept on going, even if they were more focused on Draco and Potter. Soon, Potter started to move again, his hips doing circles with Draco's cock still inside.
This Saturday, Hogwarts would be taken. Draco had spent the week planning, and his time was running through his fingers. He didn't know if he would be able to complete the mission, but for Harry... He would have to try.
"Oh, Draco…", Harry looked like he was about to cry.
The pace was intense, fluid and delicate. Draco had so many different feelings, but the only thing he could do was to whisper words of encouragement and affection in Harry's ear.
"The Chamber of Secrets! Luna, let's go to Mirtle's bathroom!"
And today, with the the rest of the Slytherins joining in, Draco knew it would be even more epic.
He stopped.
On the horizon, visible through the enchanted windows, the sun was rising.
Another round of applause.
"I dare you to let Draco fuck you in front of us."
"Hmm. Let the boy get dressed."
He slept before even entering the dorms.
"And as a last message: the rule of sitting at their respective tables is suspended. We are stronger united than apart. It's time for us to realize that. Good dinner to all."
"I will try. I promise."
Harry had been moved, placed in an iron coffin and chained. It would prevent him from doing magic, according to the Death Eaters. He waited, his ears intent on the outside noise. Nothing but whispers.
Draco sobbed, but Harry was more focused on getting ready. He fucked himself with his finger a few more times, then added another one and started to open himself. Light burning was easily ignored in favor of the pleasure it was to finally feel something inside him.
His eyes searched the other's face for something, but he just found innocence, fear, hope and another feeling that he didn't dare name at that moment. His hands caressed the other's cheek as he buried himself inside Potter.
He got lost in the pleasure, only coming back to reality when he heard a muffled cry.
"Little traitor... you will pay for what you did, you shit…", Before she finished, her weight fell on top of Draco. The dagger fell, a noise too low to be heard in the battle's cry, but Draco heard it anyway. Even with Sirius Black's manic laugh in the background.
Morning came, and with it the door to Draco's room burst open.
"Why me?"
"OKAY, OKAY! Stop you two!", Ron's voice was frantic.
"You can taste it, but I'm going to fuck your mouth, slut. Cheap whores like you don't get to suck dick when their mouth is made for fucking."
Draco placed his fingers in the already red and loose opening, still feeling some of his semen running out. He stimulated his lover, leaving him at the limit of pleasure, and before the brunette reached ecstasy, he moved away, aligning his member with the other's entrance.
"Oh, Draco…", He would give anything for people to stop saying his name that way. He didn't need their pity, he needed that ... that ...
Everything was lost.
Flowy, loose skirts. Tight, figure-hugging skirts. But always just a bit away from being too short.
Several students were already ready for the fight, some dressed in all the clothes of the Death Eaters. It turned his stomach.
"I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to, I don't want …", Draco ran his hands through the other's messy hair, lost, not knowing how to comfort him.
"Mr. Malfoy."
Harry fell, his body the only sound in the silence of the blonde's mind. He screamed and, without caring, threw himself on the body of the one he loved.
"Draco? What was that all about?"
"You don't look worried."
Harry stood up, the gasps and sounds of surprise were muffled when he put his hand in Draco's hand, hugging him sideways. The blonde looked at him, his face streaked with dust and ash cut by the trail of tears but his eyes shone with happiness.
He went over to the woman, and left Harry to finish his food with the feel of Draco's fingers still under his hands.
The alohomora came out of his lips gently, and he entered the house. Wrapping himself in the invisibility cloak, he walked through the dark corridors still following that trail. Harry thought of nothing but silver-blond hair and a mocking smile.
Draco ran to the seventh floor.
Harry took his place on top of Malfoy, who put his hands on his waist.
Harry just moaned, and Draco kissed his forehead before straightening himself and leaving the alcove.
Potter's head was thrown back, eyes screwed shut, and Draco would worry if the brunette didn't immediately started riding him.
"He and Remus were hugging each other in the middle of the dining room. Kind of like you two were just now."
In frustration, he pointed his wand at it. The fire in his veins guided the words, the Fiendfyre spell coming out of his lips, the uncontrollable flames making him run for the exit. A huge flaming face chased him but he managed to close the room door before he was hit, his clothes still smoking as he dropped to the floor.
Potter didn't even need to look twice at him to kneel down on the floor and crawl to him. He pressed his cheek to Draco's thighs and the blond had to refrain himself from reaching and petting his hair.
"What?", Draco's voice was dangerously low. Severus studied Draco's stance, the director sitting calmly, the atmosphere tense.
"No, Severus. Your failures have reached their limit.", The silence that followed was only cut by the cry that Snape had let out. After a few seconds, Harry heard footsteps and a slide.
Draco would do that. For Harry, for his mother. He would.
"Luna, listen carefully: you need to notify all Houses. The Dark Lord will invade the castle tomorrow morning, and all Muggle-borns will be in danger."
The blonde put him aside, and hugging him from behind, they slept.
"Your cock's so good, want it inside me all the time, please Draco, please, fuck me…", there were girls with their hands inside their panties, boys palming their raging erections above their pants, and all couples were getting a little bit more handsy. Draco took in the room, smiling for more effect, and pinned Potter's arms between their bodies. He then started to fuck into him again, and Potter started moaning loudly, his untouched cock high and hard in the air, little beads of pre-come trailing down and dropping to the floor.
The children of the Death Eaters were going back to school, but only to avoid suspicion, and he had his trunk ready, eagerly waiting for his mother to come and get him. It was already 8:30, and she still hadn't shown up.
Draco fucked into his mouth with force, didn't even let him breathe right. Then he turned to the voyeurs.
He put his cock inside his pants again, and saw Potter slide against the wall until he was sitting on the cold floor, his skirt pushed and tucked into the waistband, showing off his abused ass.
He lifted Potter's hips, and guided his cock to the gaping hole begging to be filled. They both moaned while Draco's big fat cock entered him.
"I'm sorry for not getting you out of there before."
Only the Malfoys, really.
Seeing the patriarch leave, Draco dropped to his knees on the floor.
"I… yes, Daddy.", Potter looked so pretty, submitting easily like that. He was really a needy thing.
"That's why he is immortal.", The realization made Draco feel heavier than before.
At that moment, Madame Pomfrey passed them.
