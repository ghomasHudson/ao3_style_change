“Ah,” she said in a deceptively calm voice, “I was just about to fetch you, Harry.” She turned her burning gaze to him and continued in the same placid way, “I was wondering… Are you out of your fucking mind?”
“Mr. Roper,” Draco said smoothly, “get on your knees.” He pointed at the empty space before his desk.
But Harry should have caught wind of something like that. Under the Veritaserum, Harry had confessed to keeping tabs on a few people – which was true – but he did more than that. Harry had contacts in every faction he could find. He used aliases were he could and used his name when he couldn't.
” Ropes twisted from Harry’s wand, binding the small man tightly and he toppled over onto the floor.
“No. And that is why we are leaving for the continent. Right now.” The command in her voice refused disobedience. “Come along, Draco.”
“I enjoyed you watching me. And as much as I love my toys, nothing is better than the real thing.” Malfoy rotated his hips, grinding his arse on Harry’s erection. “It’s so much hotter, so much harder. Filling my hole with a hot, pulsing cock is so, so much better than any toy.”
Losing all patience, Harry grabbed the edge of a blanket and pulled. The lazy sod must have been laying on a portion of the blanket though, because all Harry managed to do was reveal an arm before meeting resistance.
Once on the scene, Harry quickly slipped behind the Disillusionment charm the other two Aurors had set up and went over the situation with them.
“Your cock was so good in my mouth. So hard. It’ll be so much better in my arse. I want you to fuck me so hard. I want you to pound it into me, deep. So deep. Deeper and harder than you fucked my face.” He was panting, eyes blown so wide only a sliver of green could be seen.
“What are you on about? This isn’t a girls’ slumber party. Should Kreacher check for brain damage?” Harry was only half joking.
He looks down at the pale, panting teen his chest constricting painfully as a desperate urge to comfort overwhelms him, he can hear a distant voice that sounds suspiciously like his father telling him to leave, urging him to save himself from what would undoubtedly be a huge mistake. He ignores it, instead giving himself to the soft, comforting urge to help.
The distinct colouring and scaley pattern has him recoiling immediately as Nagini's horrifyingly unique visage becomes apparent "Fuck - Nagini" Draco pulls himself from Harry's mind as the serpent coils to attack, violently pushing himself back into his own mind.
"I'm okay Potter" Draco mutters hoarsely, his throat scratching uncomfortably as he speaks. Harry backs away slightly, giving the blonde space to sit up without being crowded, which Draco was silently grateful for, flashing the teen a small thankful smile.
Draco tosses and turns restlessly in his bed despite his overwhelming exhaustion, his eyes burning with fatigue as he forces his heavy lids to remain open. His mind a turbulent mess of chaotic thoughts, all seemingly centred around the enigma that is Harry Potter.
Pansy opened her mouth to ask what happened, and what in Merlin's name was in that letter. But she was stopped when Draco merely shook his head, looked at his two friends tiredly and stood up to head back to his room.
Draco seemed to sense that harry needed a few moments to gather himself and just kept carding his fingers through the raven's dark hair, occasionally pressing a gentle kiss to his forehead or crown in comfort. That particular action caused the smaller boy to sigh in content and snuggle further into the young Malfoy as he gathered his Gryffindor courage.
Draco shifted and pondered the offer. Of course, the boy wanted more than to be considered a mutual insomniac, however, currently, he'd take what he could get. He also had the hope that this could help them grow closer and create some trust between the ex rivals. "Okay," he replied quietly, flashing a small but genuine smile to the boy beside him. Harry responded in kind and the two reverted to silence.
It took him a moment to gain his bearings but when he groggily opened his mercury eyes to find a certain raven smiling up at him happily, he began to grin.
"However I don't want to burden Ron and Hermione with this and you are already here so..." He paused while the blonde turned to face him. "How about if one of us wakes, we come here and if the other also wakes they can join, we can sit in silence or talk about it or even something random to distract ourselves. What do you say?"
All of these thoughts seemed to weigh heavily on the confused boy as he rose from his place on the ground slowly, almost on autopilot, his body seeming to know where he had to go.
Harry took in everything she said. He agreed with most of it and she probably did deserve to be screamed at, but right now he just needed a friend and here was one seeking forgiveness. "You're right Hermione" he began in his raspy voice he tried to ignore "You have been a crap friend. But you're here now, and I need you to be there for me. So can you do that?" He asked gently.
He read the letter over and then read it again. After confirming it was not his imagination he glanced down at the signature - Lucius Malfoy. His heart rate increased and Draco sat at the table, his eyes fixed on the signature, hoping it was all just some horrible trick.
Hermione clearly had different plans as her head shot up the second she heard the door to the common room, searching for a sign of her own friend who had been acting very strangely recently.
Draco turned his gaze back down to the too-small boy, continuing to comb his hands through the knotted locks. He began to hum, holding Harry's head to his chest and continued to hum the soft lullaby his mother would sing to him as a child, hoping the vibrations would soothe the smaller boy.
Draco kissed the crown of Harry's head before shaking him a little bit, encouraging him to meet his soft mercury eyes. His heart broke when he saw the unshed tears floating in the eyes of the boy before him, almost crying himself as the boy released a sob and burrowed into his chest.
So, eager to continue their fun conversation, Harry eased Draco's fried nerves with a simple "You know you love my humour Draco" And with one simple sentence, and zero acknowledgement of the change, the two returned to their banter.
Harry gave in and allowed himself against the toned chest supporting him. Draco sighed and his breath on Harry's shoulder made him shiver. Draco smirked, proud of the effect he had on the younger boy but then remembered his own situation and sighed again, only causing Harry to shiver more.
Ginny had been fretting over the events of the previous night for the entire time she'd been awake, and whilst asleep. She just couldn't understand what had possessed Harry to say that. She came to the conclusion that one of two things had occurred.
"Don't worry about it mate" Harry responded groggily. His head throbbed but he did his best to ignore it.
Hermione and Ron watched on worriedly as Harry walked quickly out of the class towards the main door.
Harry was shocked, he didn't understand. "I know I've been horrible and an idiot and just an absolute prick for the past 7 years... but I'm truly sorry and I've grown up and I would love to start over and if not be friends then at least be civil," Draco explained.
Draco was aware of how difficult it was for Harry to stop, he knew doing that made him feel in control, kept his focus on one place and made him feel secure and present among many other things, so he was very proud that Harry had managed to take a break from it for so long.
Pansy and Hermione got closer, realising they had lots in common, mainly talking about the difficulties of having two idiotic, egotistical, oblivious best friends. They decided to plan a gathering type of thing for the eighth years.
The bleeding seemed to at least slow so Draco decided to leave Harry's side for a moment in order to get some paper towels.
After hearing Draco's very one-sided recount of the story, Pansy tried to be diplomatic so as not to drive Draco over the edge. So she chose her words carefully; "ok Draco... I understand you're angry, but if you flip the situation..." Draco looked at her disdainfully "then surely you can understand where Potter is coming from."
Harry was so deep in thought he hadn't noticed the compromising position Ginny had backed him into, with his back against the wall and Ginny unnecessarily close to him. His eyes widened comically as he processed the situation and attempted to prevent what Ginny so clearly wanted.
As Draco panted breathlessly, Harry began to giggle quietly. Draco was sure that was not the appropriate reaction to have after kissing someone so he began to worry a little. Harry then eased his mind by simply resting his forehead against the crook of his neck, breathing deeply to calm himself down for his fit of laughter.
Now Harry was very confused and had absolutely no idea how to respond to that so he just smiled hesitantly and asked as politely as possible, what in Merlin's name Ginny was going on about. Ginny, of course, explained what she believed to be true about Harry faking by saying Draco's name.
However, he regretted not staying with them when he felt himself being dragged into a storeroom near the classroom.
As the brunette freaked out in his own mind he remained oblivious to the panicking blonde who's lap he was currently sitting on. Harry's existential crisis required it's own world where the poor young Malfoy was not in the picture.
Deducing that the blood must have been Draco's brain in the panic, Granger thanked Draco and shooed him away, telling him to allow Weasley in "if he decides to behave himself."
"What is it Parkinson," Hermione asked after Ron had moved on. "It's about Draco and Harry". This got Hermione's attention instantly and she pulled Pansy towards herself before dragging her into the nearest empty classroom. "Spill," she told her.
The next morning Draco came to breakfast and returned to class as usual, and anyone who didn't know him well would have never suspected anything to be wrong. However, those who knew him quickly realised he hadn't spoken since he received the letter.
"I just wanted you to know I'm here Harry, I'm not going anywhere and if you need me at all, I'll be by your side in a heartbeat, okay?" Draco explained to the boy before him.
Looking closer, Harry saw that one of the bits looked a lot like a spider’s leg. It gave a twitch. “Oh my god, what did you do? George is going to be
Taking two handfuls of hair this time, Draco said, “be good,” and pulled Potter’s face to his balls. The contact was exquisite, and Potter’s hot breath made it even better. Dutifully, Potter refrained from using his mouth and instead rolled Draco’s bollocks against his cheek, his chin, and his nose. His face was fully pressed into Draco’s crotch and it was amazing.
Harry nodded in acquiescence and sat down to pour tea. “I’d like to know if you’ve heard anything about the Sacred 28 recently.”
be like a muggle mobile once the kinks are worked out. It’s a Wheeze’s product George is working on.”
“Yes, Potter, I beat myself bloody just so I could bask in the regard of the Great Harry Potter. How astute of you, you fucking idiot.”
Harry nodded his assent and she knelt by the sofa. She pulled back the cloak and hood covering the person that Harry had avoided looking at too closely. He gasped. It
Harry’s eyes darted to the witches and saw that they were looking back with hungry expressions. He blinked rapidly, not knowing how to respond.
Without Harry quite knowing how it happened, he was standing, and his hand had shot across the table to grip Roberts by the throat. Harry pulled him within inches of his face as he felt the long-forgotten Taylor grip the back of his robes.
"There was a defect?" Malfoy asked, turning to Harry with narrowed eyes. "Was this before or after you pressured me into trying them?"
Time for forcefulness. “Oh? I think you’re a sad little man who gets his rocks off by trying to feel big. I think you’re a possessive shit who takes his feelings of inadequacy out on others.”
Harry dressed in jeans and a warm jumper then went downstairs and hoped to God that there was a fresh kettle on.
A short while later, Kreacher appeared with a covered tray of food. Without looking at Harry, he whispered softly, “I is keeping a close watch on Master Draco’s condition. I is not letting him die. We is keeping him safe, you and Kreacher. It is being okay to care.”
“No,” Alecto cut her brother off, “we’re going to have a nice chat about her future. Woman to woman.” She turned her attention to Malfoy and said, “take Longbottom to his detention. Oh, and ten points from Gryffindor and another detention for being late, Mr. Longbottom.”
“No! Look,” Harry waved his hands in a placating manner, “Malfoy was just – ah, well, he was… Actually, I don’t really know what he did. But he’ll fix it! Won’t you, Malfoy?” Harry threw a pointed look over his shoulder.
Harry nearly toppled backward out of his chair. He snatched his wand in a tight fist, shooting a few stray, excited sparks as the two front chair legs banged back onto the floor. A slow smile spread across his face. Robards only shouted his name like that for one reason. Harry quickly rose and made his way into the Head Auror’s office.
“Mr. Potter,” she said smoothly, “are you redecorating?” With a tilt of her head, she indicated the empty space that used to contain a sofa.
Giving himself a moment, he wandered to the side table and perused his options. He picked up a supple riding crop and gave it a flex. Yes, this would do nicely. Walking back to stand in front of the shirtless man again, he trailed the padded leather end from just above the bellybutton to under the chin. He applied a little upward pressure and asked, “color?”
Miraculously, Malfoy stopped. He firmly pushed Harry toward the front room and deliberately placed himself back between them, glaring at Ginny with challenge.
Smiling, Harry said, “anybody with two brain cells would like you. And if they don’t, it’s their loss because you are the coolest five-year-old ever.”
Malfoy waved a negligent hand. “That. Nothing. I had a momentary relapse and he wanted to run off and fetch you. I told him I was fine, and look,” he gestured to himself, “I am.”
Standing, Malfoy pressed his body to Harry’s and said in a rough voice, “if only you could fuck my hole while you fucked my face.” Against his hip, Harry could feel that he was hard and ready again.
Malfoy moaned when he saw it and licked his lips. Hips still pistoning up and down, Malfoy leaned back to rest his head on Harry’s shoulder and opened his mouth. Harry slid it in and flicked his wrist, charming it to fuck Malfoy’s mouth.
“’Spose so,” Harry replied. He grabbed Mary’s drink and headed back to their table, hoping Malfoy would stay on the dancefloor and away from his information gathering.
Malfoy, meanwhile, had picked up the Ear-Bugs and was frowning at them. “So, what do these parasites do?”
“Look at me!” Narcissa yelled. And then quick as a flash, her hand swung and slapped Malfoy in the face with a resounding
Dismissing Harry from her notice entirely, Narcissa stood and made to sweep from the room, commanding as she went, “come, Draco, we’re leaving.”
Next, Harry started in on his Ever-Changing Puzzle. It was much more difficult than the muggle variety. The pieces changed shape until you connected them correctly to their adjoining pieces and, because the puzzle changed, he wouldn’t know what the puzzle was until it was completed.
He stepped up behind Potter and squeezed a firm, round cheek. He kneaded it gently, and then, without warning, brought his hand up and back down with a loud
Groaning loudly, Harry thread his hands through Malfoy’s hair and felt his cock hit the back of his throat. Malfoy sucked cock like he really did love it. His tongue swirled around the head every time he pulled back and then engulfed him again down to the base. His moans sent vibrations all the way up Harry’s spine.
Malfoy’s prick wasn’t fully hard but was well on its way. It sat amid well-groomed, blond curls and Harry waited for him to grasp it. Instead, Malfoy moved passed without touching it to caress his inner thigh. His long fingers just barely grazed his bollocks and his cock plumped further.
Lightly muscled, a V formed in the shape of his shoulders down to his low-slung trousers. Harry could just barely make out the trail of hair leading down from his navel.
Harry slept poorly. Again. He’d tossed around for hours, punched his pillow several times, and could not find a comfortable position. Malfoy kept creeping into his thoughts as soon as he began to drift into sleep. Did the arsehole not care if he died? The stupid, buggering git was smarter than that. He’d been trying to ignore his ‘relapse’ and somehow still managed to dissect the Bugs
only yesterday.” Kreacher’s eyes gleamed. “It would be terrible for all of Kreacher’s hard work to be undone.”
He fucked himself on Harry’s cock, slamming his arse down over and over. “So hard. Fuck. Deeper. Fuck me deeper.” He withdrew Harry’s cock long enough to pull his legs up onto the armchair and brace them along Harry’s thighs. With the added leverage, he was able to fuck himself even harder.
Harry was trying to decide if any of that sounded illegal as the bartender was waved over to another section of the bar. What where they
When the staring contest continued beyond what Harry was comfortable with, he cleared his throat pointedly. Neither Malfoy moved, blinked, or gave any indication that they’d heard him at all. Belatedly, Harry realized Narcissa was delving into her son’s mind with Legilimency.
Ginny scowled back. “Hi, Kreacher. Can you set up tea in the sitting room? Harry and I will be there in a minute, after I’m done saying hello.”
Three hours later, Harry had left instructions for Kreacher to watch Malfoy and was sitting in a pub in London. Ursa's Pride was a newer establishment and on weekend nights, was usually packed full of young witches and wizards. At just after noon on a Thursday, it was almost empty. The 20-something wizard behind the bar was chatting with a pair of smartly dressed witches, and a few blokes huddled around a table next to the empty dance floor.
“I should have just sat on my hands and let your mum do all the work? I do have some resources, Malfoy,” Harry said dryly.
“It is not being for you.” Kreacher’s tone was just this side of insolent. With a flourish, he presented the letter to Malfoy.
Draco was aware that he should bring Harry to Madame Pomfrey and intended to do so soon if Harry remained unresponsive, but he had only gained Harry's trust recently and wasn't quite ready to give it up so soon.
Harry sighed as he caught sight of the approaching brunette. Hermione grabbed his arm and dragged him over to another couch, away from the one she had been sitting on with her boyfriend, not that the latter noticed, too engrossed in a game of wizarding chess against Dean Thomas.
Harry shrugged off the cloak and moved to sit beside the blonde, who barely acknowledged his arrival. The two sat like this in silence for what seemed like an hour when it was really only a couple of minutes before the raven-haired boy shattered the tranquillity with a single word.
Harry stroked a hand through Draco's hair, which had grown down past his ears and remained as soft as ever now that it lacked the copious amounts of hair gel he used to abuse it with. Harry continued to hold the boy until his sobbing lessened and turned to sniffles, Draco's hands remaining twisted in his shirt as if confirming he was indeed there beside him.
The game continued but Harry couldn't get comfortable. He kept shifting around on Draco's lap until he was harshly told to quit it. He turned to Draco to ask why when he felt something underneath him begin to dig into him. He immediately stopped squirming. Draco did his best to ignore it and just pulled Harry into his chest so he could lean against him and they could both get comfortable.
"Where have you been Harry? First, you disappear all day and then you just get up and leave dinner for no reason?" Harry scowled slightly when she claimed he left for no reason but said nothing as the girl continued to reprimand him for being so careless and for not telling them where he was going.
Hermione watched the scene before her with narrowed eyes, sure that Harry had some issue with Ginny that she seemed unaware of. She shot Harry a pointed look, with a jerk of her head towards the ginger who was practically sprawled across him. Harry merely shook his head minutely, closing his eyes and taking a few calming breaths.
Before he could fall asleep Harry jerked himself up, making the boy below him startle slightly at the sudden movement. "S-so you like boys too?" Harry questioned the blond timidly.
He sat down at the Gryffindor table and took a bite of an apple. Forcing it down he took another few bites before abruptly standing and rushing towards the abandoned bathroom occupied by Myrtle.
"Um, yeah, I can't fully throw it, I think Dra- Malfoy is decent looking so I was able to just, um kind of, um shift it? I guess?" Harry explained slowly, hoping it made sense.
Paranoia was explained as follows: people go around to different individuals and ask a question, for example, who's the hottest in the circle. These questions are whispered and only heard by the answerer. The name of the person they pick is then called out. This person then has the chance to discover what the question was by picking a number out of 10 at the same time as the answerer. If they both pick the same number then the question is revealed. The question otherwise remains a secret. Veritiserum must be used. Due to a charm, the question cannot be revealed by either person unless the number is guessed correctly.
Harry awoke with a start, he scanned his surroundings in a panic, only calming when he felt the steady rocking of the train carriage. He began to remember where he was. Taking in his surroundings he understood that he was on the Hogwarts Express on his way back for his eighth year. Ron and Hermione were nowhere to be found, probably on prefect duty, but then, he hadn't heard from them all summer, not one letter, so he wasn't surprised by their absence.
Draco merely held him closer and pressed his lips to the crown of Harry's head one more time before letting the exhausted boy rest against him. Draco was concerned about Harry's low energy levels, seeing as the two were sleeping for most of the day, however, he was reminded of how skinny the younger boy was as he rubbed his back, almost able to feel his ribs through his clothing.
Harry decided to be bold and licked into Draco's mouth, mapping it out before the blond took dominance. Draco groaned as he returned the kiss with fervour before the two pulled away to catch their breath.
Draco continued to glare at the girl who was upsetting his Raven, who had only just calmed down before they entered.
The latter query was asked to Ginevra Weasley also, but of course, due to the charm on the game, she was unable to reveal her question to anyone. Much to Harry's relief.
And so he did. He told her every last detail, including the blood that seemed to have disappeared from Harry's top.
Draco finally found his confidence and firmly denied planning on telling anyone about what he saw. "In fact; I didn't see anything," Draco said adamantly.
Harry and Draco had pretty much been left alone, silently observing and occasionally making small remarks to make the other laugh. Ginny had seen this and was frustrated that when she called out Harry's name as an answer he didn't even seem to register it had happened, and so lost his opportunity to discover the question about him.
They seemed happy however and Harry wasn't going to ruin that by voicing his opinion. Pansy and Hermione had planned another gathering for that Saturday and everyone seemed excited to attend. It seemed the seventh and eighth years had begun to enjoy and anticipate the enjoyable nights. They were an escape for some of the troubled teens.
The day began to come back to him and he sobered slightly, taking Harry's arms in his own and gently brushing a hand over the bumps, ensuring they were healing properly.
"Ok spill" Pansy demanded, seconds after sitting down next to Draco. Knowing she would force it out of him, Draco began to describe his encounter with Potter.
Draco settles against the comforting softness of his mattress, the plump pillow heavenly beneath his aching head, he wraps the heavy duvet tightly around his frame, holding the edge in a white-knuckled fist.
As he's violently slammed back into the present he doubles over clutching at his roiling stomach, gasping for breaths, a restrictive weight settling over his chest as he desperately tries to breathe.
"Draco explain yourself" Snape snaps impatiently, his fingers pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration.
Pushing into the room, he slaps a hand over his mouth as a surprised gasp falls from his lips, writhing on the bed before him, face twisted in anguish is Harry Potter. Harry lays in the middle of his four-poster bed, his wavy, ink-black hair a messy halo atop his head, his body continuously twisting and turning uncomfortably, his sweat-slicked chest heaving with ragged breaths and distressed whimpers.
"It's quite invasive-" Draco worries, eyes briefly flicking away from Harry's intense gaze "are you sure Potter?" he questions softly, searching the teen's features for any sign of hesitancy.
With his shoulders set in determination, he spells the large, thick obnoxiously red privacy curtains shut hiding them from the rest of the boys occupying the dorm. He carefully places Harry's wand back on the dresser, he's left feeling oddly bereft as he releases the warm weight of the wands magic, turning to settle himself awkwardly beside the dark-haired teens trembling frame.
"D-do you know what's wrong with me?" Harry inquires apprehensively, his fingers restlessly fiddling with the duvet beneath them as his questioning eyes flick up to Draco's.
He slowly succumbs to a fitful slumber, his body weighed down heavily by dread and weariness as he allows himself to be pulled into the darkness, his incessantly buzzing mind finally calming as he slowly begins to dip into unconsciousness. The tension held in his aching muscles slowly dissipating as he permits himself to tumble into a thankfully dreamless sleep, treasuring the brief moment of tranquillity in his hectic life.
Draco stumbles through the seemingly endless corridor, Harry's nightmare playing vividly in his mind each time his eyes blink shut. He mindlessly walks the familiar route to Professor Snape's chambers seeking the man's guidance, an unbearably heavy burden settled over his shoulders, his frame wrought with tension as he slowly trudges towards the professor's chambers.
His mind flickers to Potter, all thoughts seemingly leading back to the initial event that led to all these other bizarre events unfurling. His mind strays to the easy trust the teen had placed in him despite their abysmal history, a warmth loosening in his chest as he remembers the relieved expression on the teens face when he realised Draco wasn't a hallucination.
He feels a startling resistance as his magic presses against Harry's subconscious causing a slight furrow to form between his brows, beads of sweat forming at his temples as he pushes against the resisting force. The force feels dark, the icy shards of magic splintering almost painfully against Draco's as he forces it to release its hold over Harry's mind, a sudden feeling of unbridled rage momentarily consuming him before he's ungracefully falling into the welcoming glow of Harry's mind.
With a sharp, echoing crack he breaks through the fog, the shiny familiar walls of the Ministry Of Magic surrounding him, a soft eery glow reflecting off their glassy exterior. The suffocatingly dark atmosphere choking him as a shiver courses through his corporeal form.
He distantly registers the sound of his knuckles frantically pounding against the solid wooden door, he doesn't feel the sharp sting the forceful contact should cause. The door swings open, a furious Severus Snape looming threateningly in the doorway a scowl that would have most people cowering beneath it etched into his face. His features instantly softening as they take in the blondes grave expression and trembling hands. "Draco?" Snape calls, raising a questioning eyebrow at the dazed teen shifting nervously before him.
"Arthur Weasly" Draco exclaims abruptly, his sharp outburst momentarily startling the professor. The man releasing a futile huff of protest as Draco bodily pushes past him into his chambers, Snape begrudgingly pushes the door shut turning to face the frantically pacing teen.
Laying on the floor inches from his feet, writhing in agony, bruised and bloodied was Arthur Weasly. Icy fear grips at his heart, constricting around the fluttering muscle as the large form hovering above the Weasly begins to take shape.
"I should be the one asking you that" Harry snaps defensively, stormy green eyes glaring furiously at the blonde as he scrabbles up to sit rigidly beside him.
Draco startles awake, his chest heaving as he struggles for gasping breaths, an uncomfortable feeling twisting in his stomach. A shiver runs down his exposed spine as the cool evening air catches on the thin sheen of sweat covering his torso.
"Harry, Ginny needs to take a hint, I swear she is so lucky I haven't decked her in the face yet. I don't care if she's a girl, she can't be doing this, forcing herself on you without your consent! It's not right!" Harry looked up at the blond with glassy eyes, before abruptly leaning in and pressing their lips together hard. Draco was shocked for a moment by the sudden kiss but reciprocated quickly, relishing in the feel of the raven's lips against his own.
Draco instantly regretted coming into the room and began to back away slowly, mumbling apologies and avoiding eye contact with Harry, guilt written across his face.
"But the whole time all I was thinking was that I wanted it to be a boy kissing me, which makes no sense, obviously. And all I've ever been taught was two boys liking each other was wrong and a freak of nature so it was just even more ways for me to be f*cked up and I couldn't handle it."
At this point Ginny had a 'genius' idea and strolled up to Harry confidently, catching him by surprise as he was mid-laugh from another sly remark the Slytherin beside him had made about the Ravenclaw Zacharias Smith.
Harry was peeking through the crack in the door as they walked past, spotting a familiar blonde head. The others walked on but this particular boy recognised the bathroom and slipped inside unnoticed.
Harry chose to ignore the snide remarks and walk off however Malfoy wasn't finished. Grabbing Harry's arm, he asked: "What is it potter, think you're too good for me?". Harry tried to shrug him off, but the movement caused a tear to fall.
Draco opened the letter slowly, unsure of what was to come. He took the parchment out, letting the beige envelope fall back to the table.
With a grin, Ginny returned to her spot across the circle and awaited Harry's answer. Harry simply mumbled something unheard by the group before he was reprimanded by everyone and forced to speak clearly.
Throughout these nights both boys' opinions and perspectives changed. They gradually became closer and started to laugh with each other as one made jokes to lighten the sombre atmosphere. Draco remained conscious of Harry's problem and would occasionally brush off his arm to see if he'd flinch.
"Harry, come on Harry, wake up, please" Draco prompted gently. At the lack of reaction, Draco became slightly more worried. After no reaction still, he became slightly frantic.
After leaving the bathroom and returning his glamors, Harry had decided that he should give Draco a chance, the war changed everyone, so maybe he changed too. Plus Harry needed to know what this strange feeling was.
After a while, people began to get bored and started asking more controversial questions and more intense dares, at which point the other Hufflepuff and Neville decided to leave. Seamus was dared to snog Dean much to their enjoyment, Hermione revealed she liked Ron until finally, it came back to Harry.
He opened the door to the nearest stall and began retching and heaving, emptying the small number of contents that were in his stomach into the toilet before him. Angry with himself he stood to leave.
The morning after the Paranoia game Harry was bombarded with questions from his friends who wanted to know about his sudden closeness with Malfoy and what the question was.
Harry immediately leaned into Draco's embrace, surprisingly unembarrassed by the action due to each of them seeing the other break down before. They remained like this in silence for the entire night, with the blonde gently carding his fingers through the boy's raven curls.
Harry had a decision to make. He could either drown himself in fears and what if's. Or he could take a risk and tell Draco everything, potentially losing the one person who seems to understand everything about him and new closest friend, which would only shatter the boy more.
Harry remembered trying to leave and being grabbed by Malfoy after stumbling before his vision went black, and he couldn't remember anything further.
The glamours made everything so much easier. Harry wasn't sure he'd survive if he had to deal with all the questions. He hated the attention. He pulled on his school robes and left the safety of the dorm.
Draco merely kissed him again, still softly but a little more possessively, threading his fingers through the younger boy's hair and relishing in the shocked whimper he emitted.
Deciding to address that when her friend was of sounder mind, she pulled the protesting girl from the common room, with the excuse of needing help with 'lady problems' in the hope of the boys not questioning that. Much to her exasperation, it worked very well. She rolled her eyes. Boys.
He approached the door cautiously, conscious of the fact that Harry was likely upset and Draco didn't want to spook him further.
The blonde threw himself to the floor beside the bleeding figure and immediately attempted to staunch the bleeding that seemed endless. Letting out a choked sob, Draco removed his wand and began to recite every healing spell in his mind.
Harry couldn't have asked for someone so understanding to be with him on that night. Draco forgot about his troubles momentarily, simply enjoying the peaceful atmosphere surrounding the two after Harry calmed down.
Hermione finally approached him and gave him a hug. Despite the hurt he felt at being ignored, Harry melted into her touch, not realizing just how much he needed it. Much to Harry's dismay, Hermione pulled away and began to explain; "Harry I'm so sorry I didn't owl you over the summer! I should have and I was an absolutely horrid friend and I totally understand if you don't want to speak to me!" Harry didn't have the energy to fight her so he just nodded dejectedly. "No Harry. I truly am. I thought that you needed space, and maybe you did but I should have realized that you still needed someone. So scream and yell and tell me I'm the worst. I deserve it. But just know I love you so much"
"I-" Harry choked out, before closing his eyes in shame and embarrassment. He wasn't meant to be like this. He was clearly just confused, or maybe defective. With this thought, afresh steam of tears began.
Harry heaved a big breath when he finished, chickening out of telling the boy beside him of his brewing feelings.
Then, with a start, he began to remember. Dra- Malfoy walked in on him in Myrtle's bathroom, and instead of sneering and slagging him, he tried to help.
His scars had remained untouched for many weeks, and other than one small relapse, Harry had avoided any more by seeking out the comfort of the blonde.
Harry spent the next several minutes people watching as he sipped his drink. He’d been right to assume that most of the pub’s patrons would be well on their way to drunk by now. People stood too close, touched too freely, and wore the glazed smiles of the happily inebriated.
Kreacher entered the kitchen, humming happily. “Master Draco is much improved. He is needing to rest, and I is making him some good, strong tea.” The elf continued to hum as he gathered items for tea. Obviously, Malfoy rated higher than Harry’s usual guests because Kreacher was setting up a formal tea tray with fancy cups that Harry didn’t even know he had.
“Master Harry,” Kreacher interrupted, “the young Master Draco is healed. He should wake soon. I is needing some cloth –”
“Mother,” Malfoy said quietly, “can you have some of my things sent over? It seems I may be here a while.”
“Interested? Not a lot of limits, that one,” the bartender smiled knowingly. “You’d have to go over the details with him, but he’s usually up for trying just about anything. But I recommend not rushing off with him just yet. The night’s just starting and there’s sure to be a show or two in a while.”
“I’m fine, Potter. It was mild at best. Your house elf fixed me some tea and now I feel fine.” He took a sip as if to prove how totally fine he was. “I don’t know what he added to it, but it worked wonders and I am fine.”
“Close your eyes,” Malfoy demanded. Harry did. “The crowd in the stands doesn’t matter. You’re a Seeker, high above everything.”
Before the prat could protest, Harry said, “look, you just put the Ear-Bugs in your ears and then tap the music note with your wand. Ta-da, music plays. Just like magic.”
There was a woman lying on the sofa, apparently asleep, but Harry didn’t turn his back to her as he shouted at the man, “where is your accomplice? Who are you working with?”
” over and over. Suddenly, his eyes glazed, and his hands became erratic. He came with a shout, covering his chest and fist with thick, white strands.
Harry scowled. Not wanting to trail after Malfoy like an obedient puppy, he went to find Teddy and say hello to him first.
Malfoy looked up from where he’d been sitting at the table with his head in his hands. His miserable expression changed to surprise. “You have a date?” he smirked, eyes sparkling. “Whatever would the littlest Weasley think?”
“I’ve, ah, I’ve been around,” Harry evaded with a vague gesture. The less solid information he gave them, the better.
a disguise. That looks like a potions accident.” Malfoy stood and approached Harry to inspect him critically. “Who’re you supposed to be then?”
know in a way that kept them anxious, waiting for a blow and wondering if it might not come. You had to feel when forcefulness would press them in just the right way and know when a sympathetic word would break them.
She thanked Pansy for telling her and sat quietly for a moment. She then looked up and gave Pansy a small smile. "I really appreciate you telling me, do you think we could put the past behind us? We've both changed and matured and I think we could be good friends." Pansy thought for a minute, then finally responded, "I'd like that" she said quietly.
Ron seemed stunned and went to retort when Hermione turned to him with a pleading look. "I'll be ok, you go on," she told him gently. He scoffed and glared scathingly at the two before reluctantly walking off, muttering to himself.
The group looked to the vial Pansy pulled from her pocket. It contained a clear liquid with tiny gold specs in it. "Veriteserum" Hermione announced proudly. Everyone stared at it a moment longer before nodding in agreement.
The young Malfoy's eyes widened at this newfound information and he made a mental note to ask about these relatives again at a later date as he explained to the confused boy on his lap that he was wrong and being gay and liking the same sex was totally normal and nothing to be ashamed of as Harry gazed up at him with eyes full of wonder.
A suddenly panic stricken Harry mistook his silence as disgust and immediately started his nervous babble again, claiming he understood if the bond was disgusted with him and wanted absolutely nothing to do with him.
He sat down next to Hermione and across from Ron. Hermione had her head in a book as usual and didn't even glance in Harry's direction when he sat down.
This seemed to finally get Hermione to cave as she sighed and agreed reluctantly. Harry shot Ron a grateful look and Harry started to pile a small amount of food onto his plate.
"What so I'm supposed to tell you anytime I go anywhere?" Harry questioned angrily, "You're not my mother Hermione, in case you hadn't noticed, she's dead." Hermione gasped in horror at Harry as he said that and he pursed his lips, aware that his anger had gotten the better of him.
Draco began to argue but one look from Pansy shut him up. He started to consider Harry's point of view and reluctantly found himself agreeing with Pansy, that he would've reacted the same.
"She kissed me! and I know, I know that is should've enjoyed a pretty girl kissing me but I just didn't; like at all. But of course, she didn't notice this and then she disappeared out the door leaving me a confused blubbering mess!" Har
"Pansy" Draco made sure he had eye contact with his friend before he continued. "Harry was in trouble, and was extremely upset this morning." He gave her a pointed look as he said this.
That was where Draco found the brunette, silent tears streaming down his face as his shoulders shook minutely. Draco sat down beside him and hesitantly wrapped an arm around the distraught boy he had come to call his friend.
Before Harry could panic further and question his decisions any more, Draco placed his hands on Harry's cheeks and leaned down to close the gap between their lips.
Pansy watched the body language of her friend go from upset, to relaxed and back to tensed apprehension within the span of about 4 minutes, and was beyond intrigued to identify the cause of such a range of emotions on her usually poker-faced best friend.
Draco was confused. Harry had seemed happy!... if a little nervous when Draco had asked to kiss him, and Harry had consented! So why was the younger boy sitting on his lap, looking faraway and seeming traumatised.
Harry wracked his brain as to what could have possibly occurred last night to warrant being carried to Gryffindor tower by his arch-nemesis.
His eyes were very much opened in this time and he was beginning to appreciate the struggles that those who were unwillingly branded faced on the other side of the war. The blonde was also learning to understand the constant pressure his new friend faced with the weight of being the saviour constantly on his shoulders.
Draco decided to ignore this and closed the distance between the two. He looked down, nervous before looking into Harry's enchanting emerald eyes.
Sitting at the Gryffindor table, Harry was immediately bombarded with questions from Hermione, confused about his absence from classes and frustrated with his vague responses.
Deciding against bursting into the common room unannounced, Draco asked for Granger and Weasley, hoping they'd know what to do.
The Malfoy Heir carried the Potter Heir all the way up to the room of requirement, where he asked the room to provide a comfortable space to relax and sleep in. He was quickly provided with a cosy room with two couches and a four-poster double bed. He set Harry on the bed, removing his shoes before he did the same to himself and joined him on it.
After going over them in his head again, Harry decided that, for once, Draco was right. Clearly, no one wanted him there or somebody would have come to talk to him, sent him a letter, anything. But he got nothing, no communication whatsoever. He gazed at his unblemished arms and went to find the nearest bathroom. Entering, he removed the glamour around his arms and face. Harry looked at the mirror to see his sunken in cheekbones and hollow eyes. All he could think of was how disgusting he was and how disappointed Sirius must be. He looked at his arms, at the torn skin, shredded by countless slices from his knife.
The two remained after everyone else had long departed, falling asleep on each other and waking with gentle smiles the next morning before heading to their respective common rooms and facing the questions of their friends.
Draco assured him that he could have all the time he needed. He explained that all he wanted was for them to be friends.
Draco grabbed hold of the smaller boy and tugged him to his chest. The two remained like that for some time, heads rested against each other, breathing deeply and basking in each other's presence.
Though on Tuesday morning, Draco was happily talking to Pansy and Blaise, talking about something unimportant. As they were laughing, the owls arrived with the morning post. Draco expected no letter as his mother's letters only arrive on a Friday. However, he was taken aback when an unfamiliar owl dropped a sealed envelope onto his plate.
Harry whipped out his wand, preparing to hex his captor into next week when he was overcome with a familiar smell.
Soon enough the two fell asleep in each other's arms, Draco's body curled around the smaller boys as the slept comfortably in each other's embrace.
He then reached into his back pocket and pulled out his blade and proceeded to do what he had all summer. He dragged the sharp metal across his flesh and inhaled sharply. He focused on the pain and the blood that fell the bathroom floor. To Harry, this pain was far more bearable than the pain he suffered through in his mind.
"Yes, it's me darling" was the equally quiet response. The pet name fell unplanned from Draco's lips, but neither boy seemed to notice at the time. "What happened?" Harry asked softly, subconsciously burrowing into Draco's warmth, that seemed to be radiating in the cold bathroom.
So he decided that in order to calm down and clear his head before approaching Potter again, he would take a nice stroll around the castle. He Made a quick detour to the kitchens to get an apple before heading off again.
After the class was over, Hermione and Ron went ahead. She was trying to convince Ron to take up Arithmancy and Harry didn't want to be dragged into THAT conversation.
To many, this was a shock because they hadn't really been seen together outside the gatherings. One hadn't been held in a few weeks, so their sudden closeness seemed to surprise many of their fellow classmates, who hadn't witnessed their nightly escapades (lmao that sounds so sexual)
He smiled down at him gently and continued his combing of the smaller boy's hair with his fingers, watching in amusement as the emerald eyes slowly closed in sleepiness.
He stood up suddenly, ignoring his friends' protests and walked out of the hall in a daze, unsure of where he was going until his feet carried him to the astronomy tower, where he curled in on himself and allowed his tears to flow.
Returning to his desk, he sat back down to wait. This was one of his favorite parts. The calm before the storm. He suppressed the urge to shiver with eagerness. There was so much possibility with a new partner and the paperwork indicated that this one would be exquisite. There were almost no limits and the client had asked for him specifically. Draco let a hand slide briefly over his crotch and did shiver this time.
“No judgment here, right,” the bartender held up his hands. “Rosie’s got a nose on her like nothing I’ve ever seen. If you didn’t belong here, you wouldn’t have made it through the door.”
“No need to explain to me, mate.” He winked and his grin nearly split his face. “I tried telling them you’d not be interested.” His grin turned sly. “I mean, not even that pretty lass you were talking to before had a hope.”
Harry was still pondering the implications of his house liking someone else better when Narcissa continued, “I will find who did this, I swear it, but I need him to be safe until I do.”
Narcissa narrowed her eyes at Harry but followed Kreacher toward the sitting room with an irritated swish of her robes.
Roberts was agitated and Harry wanted to keep him that way. Without preamble, he asked, “why would an accountant have a woman drugged and abused on his sofa?”
“You know,” Malfoy said thoughtfully, “I think I saw a book in Potter’s library…” He started walking toward the door but paused on the threshold. Looking back, he said, “it was weirdly nice to see you, Weasley.”
“Neighbor, Gladys Periwinkle, called it in. Says she heard a woman screaming. That was about thirty minutes ago, no disturbance since. No prior calls for this address, no records for either of the occupants. Average locking charms on the doors, no dark magic detected, and no wards.” The Auror scanned his notepad before nodding to himself. The nod caused a lock of his curly brown hair fall over an equally brown eye and Harry wanted to flick it out of the way. Honestly, how was he going to focus on the job if his vision was obstructed? Totally unprofessional. That’s why they had grooming standards.
Potter clumsily got to his feet and did as instructed. Draco watched as he positioned himself and picked up the riding crop he’d completely forgotten about. He slapped it against his palm consideringly and then tossed it to the side. He usually used a variety of toys and props, but for Potter, he wanted to be a little more… hands on.
“Enough,” Robards raised his hands for silence. “Harry, I’m giving you one chance. Stop smirking! Taylor is going in with you. At the merest hint that you are about to get out of line, I’ll have him pull you out.”
“There was… a lot… that happened that year. Nobody really knew who they could trust. We were all scared. All of us.” Neville had a considering look on his face. “I want to show you something.”
Her smile became seductive and she placed a hand on his arm where it was resting on the table. “What do you want to know?”
Teddy looked up at him with wide, worried eyes and asked in a small voice, “do you think he’ll like me?”
It could have been one of the ‘feelers’ she had out. A coincidence. But the old witch was too clever by half. In any case, tomorrow night would probably be Al’s last appearance. It was a shame. Harry liked Al. It was his first disguise and his most well-developed. Slipping new personas into the spaces Al would be leaving in Harry’s network would be difficult.
Harry let his smile twist into one he knew wasn’t nice. Flashing teeth, Harry began again, “So, Mr. Roberts, it says here you work for Wibbler, Wibbler, and Brice. What is your position there?”
Sunlight poured in through the open window and across Harry’s pillows, hitting him right in the face. This, and the sound of birds squawking, prompted Harry to bury his head under the blankets. The blankets were too hot, but the air was too cold on his sweat dampened skin to push them aside. With an irritated sigh, Harry flung them down and greeted the beautiful fucking morning.
“What happened?” Harry repeated. “Why does Kreacher look like the world is falling apart and he’s responsible?”
Harry cleared his throat and intoned, “Draco Malfoy, we have reports that you are violating Wizarding Law.”
“You wanted to do this. Ask the fucking questions.” Harry was losing his patience and his head was starting to hurt. Hermione’s insistence that they use Veritaserum was rubbing him the wrong way. God knew where she’d gotten it on such short notice. He was tired, grumpy, and every woman in his life seemed to think he needed to be protected from himself. He was a goddamned adult, thank you very much.
Harry was going to argue anyway. “Yesterday, you had broken bones and your brain was bleeding. What if Kreacher missed something when he was healing you?”
Harry’s face must have shown what he thought about that because she held up a finger before he could vocalize an opinion.
The bartender nodded to Glitter Face’s retreating back. “Always follows the rules, but never has the patience to wait to be approached first. Some find it off-putting.”
It was the surprise of it. That had to be it. Malfoy had always been harsh lines, crisp creases, and thick, dark robes. Seeing him at ease last night and suddenly being confronted this morning with smooth contours and soft, pale curves had just been jarring for Harry’s mind. It had upset his mental concept of Malfoy. Made him more… human? Approachable? Less angry-tower-of-impenetrable-malice? Harry was just confused as to where this new aspect of Malfoy fit in.
organizational skills? Your crap is everywhere! I thought your mum was sending a few things, not the entire contents of Malfoy Manor!”
“You’re so close to my cock. Just a little further and you could taste it.” Draco pulled harder on his hair as Potter tried to do just that. “No. You’re going to watch and not touch. You’re going to stay just on the edge of breathing me in, of feeling all my heat, until I say otherwise.”
The bartended levitated a fresh pint over and said, “this one’s free, compliments of the pretty ladies at the bar.”
Harry hesitated. He needed to question Mary. There had to be a lead somewhere. Just because there weren't any new donors didn't mean there wasn't someone new on the scene. What about volunteers? New employees? Was there an uptick in people requesting the charity’s resources? Desperate people did desperate, stupid things.
Before Harry could respond, Malfoy leaned across the bar and drawled, “I come with whomever I please.”
“Okay, thanks, Uncle Harry!” And with that, Teddy bounced back over to the other children, unconscious of his hair flashing between black and brown.
Harry smiled ferally. “I’m going to enjoy knowing that you’ll never be allowed near Pricilla ever again.”
Draco arched a disapproving eyebrow and darted a hand out to grab a fistful of soft hair. Yanking back harshly, he calmly said, “if you want to be my good boy, you will say, ‘yes, Sir.’”
Laboriously, Harry helped Malfoy out of the bathroom and to the pub’s exit. The cold air and sudden quiet hit Harry like a physical blow.
Harry spun around and stared at the wall. Clearing his throat, he croaked, “your mum is here.” With that, he strode out of the room without looking back and slammed the door behind him.
Kreacher gently took Malfoy’s cup and re-filled it. “Master Harry is being right. I is removing the head swelling and mending the bones and cuts, but your body is remembering the hurt.”
And just like that, Harry was alone again. Sighing in annoyance, he took a drink of the pint Malfoy had brought him. He was pleased to find that it was the same blond ale he’d ordered for himself yesterday.
Harry didn’t know what was happening and he didn’t know why it was so fucking warm in the room all of a sudden, but he did know that this needed to stop. He needed to get his hands on Malfoy. To see if he was okay. Harry knew the pink parts of Malfoy's chest would be hot to the touch and something in the back of his mind wondered if the rest of his skin was hot too.
The little smile dimmed but didn’t have the decency to disappear. “I, in my genius, have made significant progress toward –”
Harry wrapped a hand around Malfoy’s bobbing cock and used his other to grip Malfoy’s hip. He fucked up into him, meeting every bounce of Malfoy’s arse.
Laughing, the bartender said, “don’t look so alarmed. They won’t bite,” he cocked his head to the side in a considering manner. “Unless you want them to.”
Harry looked at her with eyes he’d changed to blue, ran a hand through his blond hair, and smiled. Al was the name he’d chosen years ago for his current disguise. “Good to see you, Mary,” he said.
Malfoy sneered. “My mum would not have – Wait, I was injured?” His eyes widened. “She evoked the Debt, didn’t she?”
Harry slowly walked up his front steps and opened the door. Just inside, Kreacher was wringing his hands frantically and intermittently banging his head on the wall.
“Gin, really, maybe another –” Ginny stopped him with her mouth pressed against his. A loud bang made her jump back.
Malfoy had no such qualms. He tipped his head back, exposing the long line of his throat, and drained his glass. He set the glass back on the bar with a sharp
The walk through the Leaky Cauldron was awkward for Harry. Conversations slowly died as they made their way through and eyes fixed on Malfoy. Harry made a mental note of anyone who’s stare looked a little too unfriendly. If Malfoy noticed their looks, he ignored them.
“It feels so good,” he moaned. “I’m so full, stretched so wide.” He continued to look at Harry while he fucked himself for several more minutes.
sat on the sitting room table. Pulling the spider-like contraptions out of their packaging, Harry lifted them to either side of his head and startled when they jumped into his ears. After a moment of discomfort, he used his wand to tap the newly added music note on his Muggle Brick. He reeled as music instantly began blaring into his brain. With a yell he couldn’t hear, he clawed at his head, trying to get the Bugs out. Not only did they not budge, they seemed to be trying to burrow in deeper. Eyes beginning to tear, he desperately grabbed for the Brick and his fallen wand. He jabbed at the music note again and collapsed in relief when the music stopped.
Harry’s arms and legs protested the entire way to his sitting room. Sighing in relief, Harry put the twisted person on the sofa and asked, “how on Earth did you carry him to my house?”
Harry continued to pace. “No one can be that cool and composed. He was trying to bait me; I know he was.”
“He’s sleeping,” Harry said. “I’ll, um, go get him.” Harry did not want to be the one to break the news of the second Debt if she’d not been able to find who’d attacked Malfoy. He waved Narcissa inside and closed the door behind her.
“Now, now, don’t be so hasty, Potter.” Malfoy cocked his head thoughtfully. “You know, I could use a stiff drink… or twelve.”
Malfoy’s face sobered as he said, “I am extremely surprised Granger would go on holiday after that.”
“You could just ask!” Harry responded more harshly than intended. He breathed out and started again more quietly, “when he got here yesterday, he was –”
” Malfoy cupped his non-existent, invisible, and absurdly large breasts and proffered them to Harry in a horrifying manner.
A door slammed in the front of the house. “Mum! Do I smell lemon t -” Ginny froze in the doorway, taking in the sight of Draco Malfoy, eating her favorite desert, at her family’s table. “Oh
Coming closer, Malfoy looked down at Harry’s progress. “You have to try to match the colors and shapes in the image not the pieces themselves. Look,” kneeling down, Malfoy picked up a piece and fitted it to another.
Malfoy’s eyes widened and he looked at Harry in surprise. “Harry Potter,” he said in tones of wonder, “St. Potter. Golden Boy and Savior. You led a woman on. You
“I’m not. You stumbled into something you don’t understand,” Roberts smiled a secret, knowing smile, “yet.”
Less than five minutes later, Harry was at the Weasley’s kitchen table again, eating lemon tart while sitting next to Draco Malfoy and he was actually enjoying it.
With another whisper into his ear, Malfoy turned around and slid back to his knees. The woman on stage with him used her booted foot to nudge Malfoy’s knees apart. She had him spread his legs so far that it had to be uncomfortable for him. And then – Oh fuck – she placed the heel of her boot between his shoulder blades and
Harry watched his back muscles flex as he fucked himself. Using the heel of his palm, Harry pressed hard on his neglected prick as Malfoy threw his head back and moved faster. He was coming up, keeping the toy just barely inside him and then snapping his hips down hard, slamming it into his hole.
The bell tinkled as she left, and Harry sat back in his chair, dreading tomorrow night. The bar would be packed, the music would be loud, and he would have to pretend to be interested in Mary. He hated that he would need to deceive her like that, but those records might point him in the right direction and it was the best way to ensure she delivered.
“I need another drink,” Malfoy said. He turned and almost stumbled as he began pushing his way toward the bar.
A thought occurred to Harry. “Kreacher, how did you know how to heal him? Bumps and bruises are one thing, but you’re telling me you healed a concussion and broken bones?”
Some men liked to bond while complaining about women. It almost always came from a feeling of inadequacy on the part of the men and Harry had successfully used that to coax out confessions before.
“Don’t worry, I don’t think she could tell,” he said. “I’ll go fend off our lusty ladies over there, shall I?”
“What do you think?” Malfoy asked, giving a little twirl to show off his outfit. It fit perfectly. Black trousers, that Harry hadn’t known he’d had, and a deep green long-sleeved shirt hugged his body closely.
She smiled back wickedly. “Ah, Harry lad, if I was but ten years younger…” She’d still be old enough to be his great-great-grandmother and Harry fought not to let his smile slip.
Malfoy flinched like he’d been hit. Eyes still trained on the floor, he said, “it’s nothing to be concerned about, I swear.”
He positioned himself at Potter’s entrance and took a steadying breath. He pushed forward until he was completely sheathed inside Potter’s body. “Color?”
Eyes narrowed and mouth tight, Malfoy paused and then downed his cup as Harry had. Harry nodded in recognition and refilled his cup too.
“Not yet.” Draco took Potter’s hand and poured a generous amount of lube in it. “I’m going to watch you finger yourself open for me. You’re going to tell me how much you want my cock while you do it.” Draco made himself comfortable on one end of the sofa with one leg bent up on the cushion, legs splayed as he idly stroked himself.
Harry was quickly trying to regain his bearings. Small details were filtering though. A framed piece of artwork depicting a woman’s provocative silhouette hung over the sofa, a vase in the corner held large feathers rather than flowers, and to his left was a doorway covered by a bead curtain that he should’ve been able to see through.
Perhaps one of the many Voldemort sympathizers who'd fled the country after his defeat had returned? The Malfoys were not popular among that bunch. While nearly everyone else had had to run or face Azkaban, the Malfoys had been able to hunker down and weather the storm. Well, except for Lucius. Harry had been called to testify for each of the Malfoys and, while his testimony had helped keep Narcissa and Draco out of Azkaban, it had utterly damned Lucius.
Harry’s thoughts chased each other until light began seeping through his window. Finally, he’d fallen into a deep, if troubled, sleep. He stayed asleep until noon, waking to daylight in his eyes. He showered and dressed without bumping into Malfoy and was glad of it.
Raising his hand to knock, Harry heard a sudden crash and a yell come from inside. “Eustace!” came a muffled shout. “Get your fecking arse off me vase!”
Malfoy immediately began working on the fastenings of Harry’s robes. He shoved them roughly off Harry’s shoulders while pushing him back, and then dropped to his knees. Malfoy grinned wickedly as he looked up at Harry and ran a hand over the bulge in his trousers.
Harry paused as that last thought registered. His favorite pair of pajamas. The ones Malfoy wore on his first day there. He’d forgotten to burn them.
He was about to pointedly look elsewhere when he realized one of the dancers was Malfoy. From behind, he’d just been another nameless body in the writhing mass. When he suddenly turned around, his eyes had locked on Harry’s. No matter how much Malfoy altered his appearance, there was no mistaking that challenging stare. There was a man pressed up behind him and a woman pressed in front, but Malfoy’s gaze never broke from Harry’s. Malfoy didn’t miss a beat while maintaining eye contact. Arms raised high, each switch of a hip seemed to cause the bass to pulse, and the couple incasing him looked like they were worshiping a god.
Draco Malfoy sat in his throne-like desk chair as he casually flipped through a file. His first appointment of the evening was due to arrive in a few minutes and he thought it best to review the contract to keep it fresh in his mind. The terms were not as comprehensive as he might like, but there was still a lot to work with here. It was always exciting to work with a brand-new client. Draco flipped the file shut with a grin of anticipation.
He noted the business hours etched on the door and faced a decision. He could still risk the wrath of Robards, knowing that the odds of getting an investigation with the information he had was slim. He could choose to walk away, accept that there was no case and dismiss his gut feeling as a fluke. Or… He could happen to be in the area after they opened and maybe he was lost and needed directions. Maybe the upstanding citizens of The Leather Petal could point him to the nearest floo? Maybe he might just glance around while listening to instructions?
The smile was gone. Malfoy’s lip curled as he said, “it’s in the bathroom. You do know that there is a handy little cabinet behind the mirror, right? Your organizational skills are shit.”
“Each leg connects to a different function in the brain, tapping into it, without really using it.” He picked up a book, flipped through it and pointed at a diagram. “Eight connectors are needed, but why use a spider as a model?”
Oddly, this advice seemed to work a bit. Harry remembered the feeling of being buffeted by gusts of wind, of having his broom pitched this way and that and only regaining control when he used the bursts of wind to angle himself for the next.
Malfoy pulled the cock out of his mouth and it glistened wetly. “I love sucking cock,” he confided. “It gets me so hard. I love to feel and big, fat prick filling my throat.”
In the sudden silence, Harry realized they were both standing and had been yelling across the table, faces barely a foot apart. Malfoy’s jaw was now hanging open, for once at a loss of something to snap back.
“Wait,” Harry said suddenly, “can’t you look into his head and see who did it? He had to have seen them.”
“How disappointing,” Alecto paused and smirked nastily, “of you. Seems you’re about as useful as your father.” She flicked her wand at a nearby tapestry and its threads fell to the floor as it unraveled. Behind it in a hidden alcove huddled three terrified younger students. Harry guessed that they might be Third Years. “If you’d been paying attention, you’d have noticed Ms. Weasley’s uncanny interest in that tapestry and might have wondered why.”
in tiny lettering. The place was locked up tight and Harry could feel the wards humming against his skin.
Sensing Harry’s waning reluctance, Malfoy cajoled, “come on, Potter. Just for a little while. I need a bit of fun after the last two shit days. I won’t even tell the Weaselette you’re a lecherous hedonist with wandering eyes.”
It did not escape Harry’s notice that she was completely ignoring the question and anxiety began to overpower his hopefulness.
Stung, Harry snapped, “I might’ve gotten more information last night if you’d have stopped throwing yourself at Mary for five seconds.”
Just as Harry was starting to get excited about a big bust, he realized it wouldn’t happen. Robards would just yell at him again. What he needed was evidence, probable cause, proof that he wasn’t imagining things and that that pot hadn’t shatter itself.
“Levitation charm, Mr. Potter,” she said with an arched eyebrow. Clearly, her composure was returning.
“You’re welcome. Do come back to visit sometime. Feel free to use the Floo on your way out,” she said with a smile that quickly became a severe frown, “and don’t you glower at me, Ginny. I am your mother.”
Hermione continued as thought Harry hadn’t spoken and repeated angrily to Malfoy, “are you currently affiliated with any hate groups?”
Harry climbed the stairs heavily, almost certain now that Narcissa hadn’t found answers. Not looking forward to informing Malfoy he was still stuck here, Harry paused outside Malfoy’s door before knocking softly.
Narcissa inhaled deeply and pulled away. “I have a few more avenues I can pursue. When I find who hurt you, you can come home, and we’ll have a chat.”
Narcissa rounded on him and Harry was infinitely glad he’d won the silent contest. She fixed Malfoy with her sharpest look yet and arched a dangerous eyebrow.
“Oh, Master Harry, you must be trying to be less clumsy.” Kreacher had a hand raised toward them threateningly. “How good of Master Draco to be trying to catch your fall.”
“No. This is muggle hell.” Malfoy had his shoulders hunched toward his ears and was eyeing everyone with suspicion. “What is wrong with them? They just… shuffle forward and look at their hands.”
“That’s stupid. No team is going to sign a player just because they know me.” The very notion was off-putting. Professional quidditch was about skill and talent. Ginny would need to train hard, but she could definitely make it to the pro level someday.
“She wasn’t drugged!” Roberts took in several harsh breaths and visibly tried to get ahold of himself. Harry let him close his eyes and breath for a few moments. Mungo’s would be delivering a report of whatever they’d found in her system, but the department hadn’t received it yet. Roberts didn’t need to know that.
“Oh,” he turned back with a surprised expression and continued, “you tap them both at the same time. I thought that would be the most obvious way. User friendly and all.”
- how much Harry hated thinking about that day. He'd spent years trying to forget something everyone wanted to celebrate him for. Trying to shove down feelings of betrayal, Harry waited for the answer he knew Malfoy would give. The man was many things, but he wasn't and never would be a killer.
When he did pull off the toy, it was only to un-Stick it, turn his body back around and shove it back into his hole. He angled himself so that he had enough room to work the cock in and out and stroke his own, leaking prick. Harry could see everything, and it was incredibly hot. Malfoy chased his own pleasure, moving his whole body sinuously.
“It is better,” Malfoy returned archly. “I’ve never had to lower myself to secondhand items or low-quality goods.”
Red Lips’ smile was positively mean as she said, “wards will trigger to keep you out of The Leather Petal indefinitely. We don’t give second chances. And, once word spreads, it’ll be extremely difficult to find anyone willing to play with you.”
to that? Harry couldn’t think of anything other than drugs that would make someone smile the way she had. It hunted him in his dreams, that smile. He’d dream of ropes and bruises and that fucking smile and he’d wake up gasping and sweaty.
“You were so deep in my throat. I want it even deeper in my arse.” He pushed Harry back toward to the armchair until the backs of his legs thumped into it. He kissed Harry with his filthy mouth and moaned into it. They kissed sloppily, tongues and nipping teeth.
If it had been twenty-four hours earlier, Harry would have been ecstatic to blearily stumble from his room at eight in the morning to answer the pounding Narcissa Malfoy was giving his front door. Well, maybe not
“The one that set off our Detection Ward as soon as you entered,” she indicated a shimmering light over Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, you can keep it until after you’ve signed. We are completely discreet about our patrons.”
That was what Harry was counting on. Emilia Fawley was a treasure trove of information, gossip, and rumor. Harry was almost glad she’d trapped him into dancing with her a few years ago at Percy’s wedding, even if she had managed to wring him dry of everything he’d witnessed during the Battle of Hogwarts in just those few minutes of awkward shuffling.
George tilted his head to the side. “The Bugs are designed to default to the volume of your mind. Maybe the feedback of…? No. The input can’t exceed… Huh, maybe it could.  I’m going to need to measure -” He got up and started to head back to his desk.
“Nothing much. The details are boring,” Harry evaded. He leaned forward as she had and said, “I’d much rather talk about you.”
Malfoy smiled with triumph, a gleeful shine to his eyes. “This is going to be hilarious. Merlin, I hope she wants you to dance.”
Narcissa’s face softened and she reached out to touch the red handprint she’d left on his face. Malfoy winced at the contact and it looked like it pained Narcissa to see him do it. She murmured a spell and the print faded. “I sometimes forget that you’ve grown and aren’t a child anymore. But you’ll always be my little boy. Always.”
Harry reached out and grabbed his hand. “Please,” he said softly, “stay. Your mum thinks they might come for you again. Just stay with me until we know who it was.”
“No, Potter, no buts.” Robards rubbed a weary hand across his face. “I cut you a lot of slack, Harry. You’re one of our best in the field, but you are fucking terrible at following orders. I’m going to tell you this once. Leave. It. Alone.”
He undressed quickly and examined a pair of dark blue jeans and the black t-shirt Malfoy had chosen for him. The jeans were a tight fit and Harry had to wiggle ridiculously to get them all the way up. The shirt was worse, and Harry suspected that it might actually be Teddy’s.
He put on Al’s most winning smile and said charmingly, “Albert Humble, entrepreneur and business investor. Friends call me Al.”
Harry readjusted the toys he was struggling to hold under each arm and said, “I did. These are for me.” He quickly swiped another box off the shelf and brushed past Malfoy before the git could comment. He paid for his purchases and ignored Malfoy who was smirking while trailing behind him.
Harry’s discomfort grew with every passing moment. To give himself something to do, he made himself a cup of tea. He almost spilled the whole thing down his front when Malfoy sucked in a ragged breath a few moments later. Looking up, Harry saw that Malfoy was looking at the floor again and Narcissa was blinking rapidly at her son.
“Harry dear,” Mrs. Weasley called, “isn’t that Kreacher? Oh my, he seems quite upset. Is everything alright?”
“No.” Malfoy seemed to wilt and went back to his half-eaten eggs. He chewed slowly, swallowed and looked up at Harry. “Your hair looks rather fetching today,” he said and then shoveled an enormous forkful of eggs into his mouth and took an obscenely long time to chew it into submission. “These eggs are delicious.”
The challenge was clear, and Harry felt his ire rise. The shot he’d taken had spread just enough warmth through his system to give him the courage to stand. He strode toward Malfoy as though drawn by a magnet. Mary was next to him, already rocking her hips to the beat.
Draco released his face and took a step back. He walked around behind his newest client and regarded him from the back. “You know how to use the colors, yes?”
Harry didn’t need to ask which year. “A bit. I mean, she knows about our hunt for horcruxes and, obviously, she was there at the end…”
“You is not asking. Kreacher promised to care for Master Harry, not tell him about it,” he said sourly.
he supposed. He flipped through the papers with a frown. There was nothing in his correspondences that suggested anyone was targeting Malfoy. Nothing. He’d gone through them all twice last night.
Books, parchment, and the bits on the table were slowly bouncing their way to the floor. It was like the table had been set on a running muggle clothes dryer.
Potter’s breath was coming harder and Draco could feel it on his skin. Its warmth and having that waiting mouth so close without touching was maddening. He gave a rough twist to the head of his prick to take the edge off.
A look of satisfaction flashed across Roberts’ face and a feral smile of his own contorted his lips. “I want my lawyer.”
“I did. Thank you for that,” Harry smiled at her. “So, nothing exciting at work? New co-workers? Any volunteers mucking things up?”
Malfoy squinted harder at the mobile the girl just ahead of them was rapidly tapping. “I just lost all of my newfound respect for Weasley Four.”
but certainly relieved. As things stood since yesterday’s Life Debt revelation, Harry was caught between anxiety and hope upon seeing her.
This was absurd. Harry was having an existential crisis over an arse cheek? Everyone had an arse! Some big, some small, sometimes hairy or freckled, some supple, some jiggly. Would Malfoy’s ripple when he walked or bounce firmly? There would certainly be movement to it. There was too much flesh there in the swell of his arse for there to be no movement. It probably bounced. Maybe rippled if slapped. Harry felt a renewed stirring in his pajama bottoms.
“She’s very pretty,” Harry continued. Jealousy tended to be a factor as well. “Maybe you aren’t enough for her. Was she going to leave you?”
“Hardly a distillery,” Malfoy muttered. “I needed a night out after the difficulties of the last few days. Potter was good enough to comply.”
Her eyes left Harry and she fixed her attention back on Malfoy. The woman removed her foot and Malfoy arched in a way that made his red arse cheeks spread and offer a glimpse of what was between them. He was breathing like he’d run a race and little shudders shook him. The woman knelt and gently cupped his face in her hands. It looked like she was stroking his cheeks with her thumbs. She gave him a little kiss on the mouth and the tenderness was so at odds with everything else she’d done to him, it made Harry feel light-headed.
Hermione paused long enough that Harry thought this might be the end of the questions. He was caught off guard when Hermione seemed to shake herself and snapped, “have you ever killed anyone, Malfoy?”
Malfoy stopped struggling and ogled at Harry. Abruptly, he laughed and said, “he helped me unzip them.”
Malfoy tapped both Ear-Bugs and handed them back to Harry. “I guess the Weasleys might pull themselves out of poverty after all,” he said dismissively.
Malfoy dropped to all fours and Harry forgot to breathe. His round arse was on full, shameless display. With her boot still on Malfoy’s back, the woman used her stick again. Malfoy’s arse rippled with the impact.
George laughed, clapped Harry on the shoulder and mourned, “it’s a shame I’ll need to abandon the spider design. Ron shrieked when I tried to show him how to use them.”
He needed a shower. His skin felt clammy and gross. Forcing himself up, Harry trudged toward the bathroom, stepping painfully on a belt buckle as he went.
“How’s work?” With any luck, Harry could get the information he needed quickly, make his excuses, and get out of there.
Her eyes refocused sharply on Harry. “Do not pay me lip service, boy. Take me story and fecking learn from it.” She trailed a finger down Eustace’s wing. “I’ve had eight birds since me husband died, and I’ve named every one of them after him. They all be fecking annoying, talking back, and cause me unending trouble.”
With ice in her voice, Narcissa asked, “why do you smell like a distillery?” Her eyes unfairly focused on Harry, as though it was his fault the stupid idiot couldn’t hold his liquor.
changing by accident. He was getting better, but emotions tended to loosen his control. At least he hadn’t recently gotten lost again because he’d wandered off while looking like a completely different child. And God,
that he gave it to me but, well, who else would it have been? No one else got close enough to have slipped it to me.”
Draco used his grip to still Potter’s bobbing head and slowly pushed his prick back down Potter’s throat. Once Potter’s nose was buried in his blond curls, Draco held him there until he felt Potter’s throat start to convulse. He pulled out to let him catch his breath and then pushed back in. This time he just bumped the back before moving out and then pushing back in. He kept up a steady pace as he began face fucking Potter.
“I – yeah. Let me just –” Finally able to move, Harry bent down and gathered the body in his arms. The limbs flopped uncooperatively, and the head lolled to the side. A weak moan came from under the hood and Harry almost dropped the body in surprise. He’d been thinking of it as ‘the body,’ not believing it was alive. With effort and a grunt, Harry stood up with his awkward burden. “Follow me.”
Breathing and heartrate back under control, Draco summoned a robe, put it on and tied it in place. Potter was still breathing harshly, eyes glazed in afterglow. Draco sat down and pulled Potter’s head onto his lap, stroking his hair while he came back to himself.
Rather than heading straight back to the sitting room while sporting a semi, Harry took a detour to the bathroom. He blinked at his reflection a few times without really seeing himself. His mind was stuck on the flowing line of skin he’d just seen. He hadn't been expecting that. Last night, he’d left Malfoy completely clothed and there was no way the git would have been able to manage undressing himself.
improve them. He did it while, apparently, struggling to breathe and occasionally vomiting. Fucking idiot.
Harry did not want to hear the end of that sentence. “Shut it, Malfoy.” To Hermione he said, “it’s a temporary arrangement. He’ll be gone in a few days.”
As the ringing faded, Harry dropped his quill and headed for the door. Who would be knocking? Grimmauld Place was even more heavily warded now because of the tassel woman, and his friends would have just Floo’ed or walked right in.
A nicely decorated and extremely cluttered room came into view. George stood up from a desk in the corner and smiled as he came over to his side of the fire. “How are the Ear-Bugs? Did they sync with the Brick? Was it too… tinny? To bass-y?”
A streak of red light shattered one of the potted plants to Harry’s left and he heard a voice curse. Harry whirled into action instinctually. He fired off three spells before he’d even finished ducking behind a topiary. Heart pounding, he waited for return fire.
Roberts opened his eyes, and his face took on a placid, disinterested expression. He sat himself up taller, squared his shoulders, and said in a tone just as smooth and strong as Harry’s had been, “Pricilla isn’t most women.”
The two witches stayed a few more minutes before heading for the door. One blew Harry a kiss and he could hear them giggling until the door closed, shutting off their laughter.
The memory of Malfoy’s naked body slotted itself into Harry’s fantasy and he came hard with that image burning in his mind’s eye.
The git slowly lifted a hand to his hair before understanding filtered into his eyes. Looking chagrined and slightly embarrassed, he waved a quick
He flinches back from his careful exploration of one of the shelves as he hears the disgustingly familiar sound of fangs piercing skin, accompanied by a low groan of pain. The blonde spins on his heels stumbling backwards, his face twisted in horror at the sight before him.
Draco hastily makes his way to Potters side, his eyes searching for the teen's wand. His face twisting into a grimace as his fingers curl around the Pheonix feather and holly wand anticipating the uncomfortable tingle of an unfamiliar wand. However, he is instead greeted with a soft warmth curling between his fingers, comforting tendrils wrapping around his wrist as the wand effortlessly heeds to his call as if it were his own, a silencing charm easily surrounding them with a bubble of privacy isolating them from the rest of the world.
With a quiet snap and a flicker of green light, Draco finds himself tumbling to the floor, he buckles under the weight of his limbs as control suddenly rushes back to him. Crumpled on the floor in a manner unbecoming of a Malfoy, he pushes himself onto shaking legs sucking in a sharp breath as he carefully inspects the area surrounding him. Soft whimpers echo through the dimly lit room, the distraught sound breaking up the oppressive silence, Draco strains his hearing, listening intently for the soft whines of pain as he carefully follows the quiet sounds to the source.
"That Potter was Legilimency" Draco hesitantly confesses through gritted teeth. He watches as the misplaced anger seeps from Harry's frame at the startlingly honest confession, the teen flopping beside him dejectedly, his teeth worrying at his bottom lip nervously.  "If it's easier you can show me?" Draco huffs tiredly, unwilling to wait around for the boy to stutter through an explanation of something that was undoubtedly complex.
The night's events play on a continuous loop in his mind, conflicting feelings warring in his gut, his body taut with tension as he worries for Arthur Weasly, a man he was raised to despise yet wishes to save.
"Draco calm down, how do you know it isn't merely a nightmare conjured by a disturbed mind, Potter has experienced more than his fair share of trauma" Snape reasons, placing a comforting hand on the teen's shoulder, giving the tense muscle a brief reassuring squeeze.
"We were at the Ministry, the room of Prophecy I think" Draco recalls, the images flashing behind his closed eyelids. "Arthur weasly was on the floor - Merlin there was so much blood" Draco swallows thickly, his saliva feeling like a dense lump as he struggles to force it down his throat. "Nagini - s-she was attacking him - it was almost like she was taunting him - playing with him" Draco finishes shakily, his dark grey eyes meeting the professors worried gaze "please help him, Severus, I can't have his blood on my hands" Draco pleads brokenly.
"They'll kill him Draco - You're strong you know how to protect your mind Potter doesn't if what you say is true how long until the Dark Lord unhinges his mind" Snape pushes, watching as horror plays across the teens sharply defined features. "Get some rest Draco, I cannot force you to help Potter but I do not believe you wish the boy dead" Snape whispers, gently guiding the distressed teen out of his chambers, giving him a soft nudge in the direction of the student chambers.
"He'll kill me - They'll all kill me Bella, dad - all of them" Draco chokes out, panic clouding his features as he pictures the outcome awaiting him should he help Harry Potter.
The frustrated scowl on the blonde's face softens as he takes in the teens tortured expression "Harry, please wake up" Draco pleads an edge of desperation in the soft plea as he gently guides the teen back to consciousness.
"Potter was having a nightmare, I was drawn to him. I saw everything but I wasn't in control not until I was already in the Gryffindor common room" Draco runs a shaking hand through his wavy hair as he explains. " I saw him and he - he looked bad, really bad" Draco explains a shiver running through him as he remembers Harry's pale trembling frame. "I couldn't wake him so I-" Draco winces "I entered his mind - someone was resisting me and it wasn't Potter-" he shudders the icy feel of the casters magic lodged deep in his bones. "I woke him eventually, and it was stupid I knew it would be a mistake but I told him he could show me the nightmare" Draco hangs his head, his hands tiredly streaking over his face, the rough scrape of his palm leaving the pale skin pink in its wake.
