“Not as hard as I thought it would be,” Draco said. He put his hand over Harry’s, stilling his fingers. “I—thank you for not judging me,” he said. “I was terrified when I first brought my anxiety up, but you just…took it in stride. Didn’t ask questions or looked at me differently. It felt safe.”
Harry took the slip, but before he went to fetch the documents, he walked Malfoy through the rules and restrictions. They were much the same as for the reading hall, but there was greater personal freedom to be had. “Grad students often get one of these for their dissertation research and writing. There’s one in the room next door.”
“No, no, that’s all right. I’ll come back later. I wouldn’t want to hold you up.” Harry left the store and Apparated home, conscious of the fact he was late. Flourish and Blotts closed at seven on Wednesdays. It was Wednesday. Harry had just spent almost two hours in there, unable to make a simple decision about what to buy, not least read.
Harry let the kids play for half an hour, taking notes, and then stopped the game to get them doing drills. Most of them could sit on a broom and handle a second task, like a bat or a passing a Quaffle, but several were still toppling off their brooms or moving very slowly.
“It does sound fun,” Padma commented, a thoughtful look on her face. “Low stakes, adorable children, proceeds go to honourable causes…will you be commentating, Lee?”
Harry punched the air. “YEAH!”
“Yes,” Draco said, slowly. “Let’s.” He steeled himself and then walked in, Harry by his side.
“Yes, no, I mean,” Harry said, “how is your book coming along? It was about dying, right?”
“No. But we’re not going out until Wednesday, which is,” Harry counted on his fingers, “whole five days away, but I’m seeing him again on Monday for non-date reasons, and I just don’t know how I’m supposed to, you know, wait.”
“Oh,” Draco said, pale. “You never learned how to properly maintain your own boundaries?”
Pansy looked at Padma with interest. “I thought you were into femmes.”
“You’ve made your point.” Ginny struggled for a second, then continued. “I’m sorry, too. About everything.”
Harry rubbed his face. All his conflicted emotions were gathering in his belly and threatening to turn into rage.
Well, neither had he and Draco, Harry mused. And since Draco hadn’t brought up sex again, Harry hadn’t either, and it seemed…okay. As if the inevitability had gone out of it somewhat. Harry had noticed Draco looking at him, and he’d joined him in the bath once more since the weekend, but he hadn’t suggested anything, and Harry had been very careful not to bring up the topic either.
“Are you ready?” Draco asked.
It’d been a long time since Harry had last seen Malfoy, though he’d heard a little about him through the grapevine over the years; apparently he’d been keeping himself busy by restoring Malfoy properties and selling them off. Last Harry had heard, Malfoy had spent the previous winter in Cornwall, fixing up a neglected Manor House and doing repairs on the local inn. It seemed they’d held historical value to Muggles in the area. Something about smuggling alcohol from (or was it to?) France during the Jacobean era (or something, Harry didn’t know who Jacob was or why he had an era named after him), Harry thought. Pansy had said something about it.
“Sorry,” Harry said automatically, but then his senses caught up with him. “Oh, Malfoy, hi. Were you…leaving?”
“Yeah, well, Pansy said she hasn’t heard from you in a long time.”
“Did you want him to push you?”
“Do you use this one often?” Malfoy asked, holding the bath bomb up to the light as if it would reveal its secrets to him that way.
Harry could wager a guess. They’d been playing tag—Harry had reduced the amount of directly Quidditch-related activities recently in an attempt to put an end to the (still) ongoing rivalry between the Little League kids and the…not-Little League kids—and the game had turned into a full-blown blood feud.
“But?”
“Leave her alone,” Harry said, glaring at the reporter. “Both of them.”
“Harry.”
“I’ve started a Quidditch Little League team,” Harry said. “For charity.”
“Yes, go on, be pleased with yourself,” Harry told him, smiling back. “How is your research today? Those twelfth century coroner scrolls yield anything interesting?”
Ten minutes before the game would be called, nobody had caught the Snitch yet, and the scores were even at 130-130. Instead of swapping Alice out with Anthony, Harry decided to keep her as Seeker until the end of the game and sent Anthony in as a Beater instead, taking Love out of play before she caused a major incident—Harry could deal with her frothing on the sidelines—and also rotated Denise and Dorcas back in as Chasers.
Harry and Ginny shook hands with the cookbook author, whose name turned out to be Pleasance Downer. “You played a good game,” Harry said. “Maybe we’ll meet you in the semi-finals or finals?”
the love interest,” Harry pointed out.
“Yeah.”
Or maybe Harry should stop overthinking things.
“No, no, I just noticed that Pansy didn’t talk about you anymore. Never mind, go on, you were saying.”
“I think it smells like the burnt caramel Mum made once, but like if she put grass in it,” Betty said.
! He jogged to keep up with the kids, to try to corral them into more sportsmanlike behaviour; they could cheer all they wanted, but they were going to have to be nice to the other team first and thank them for a good game.
“Listen,” Draco said, one thumb resting just on the edge of Harry’s bottom lip. “There is something we need to set straight. We don’t have to have sex if you don’t want to—”
How had that possibly changed him? Was it all that time to just…think? His prison time had been bookended by his community service; he’d been assisting in the Janus Thickey ward for about six months before he went to prison, and he came right back to it afterwards.
,” Ron said, rolling his eyes.
“I’ve never wanted to die,” Malfoy said, without hesitation. “I just
“Did you like it?” Draco asked after the game, cheeks rosy with pride.
” Harry asked.
Malfoy was watching and trying to be inconspicuous about it.
“But…”
Malfoy exhaled. “Okay. Good. Sorry, it’s just, you looked like you were having a panic attack or dissociating or something like that.” He put his hand on Harry’s arm. “I’m sorry for asking. It’s clearly not a safe topic for you.”
“Hey,” he said. “I love you. I’m not breaking up with you.” He didn’t really understand why she’d think that—sure they had their problems, but breaking up? It had never even registered as an option.
It was comfortable in the groove.
Then she hopped off her broom and inspected the Snitch as if she’d just picked up a particularly interesting bug and was cradling it in her palms.
“All right,” Harry said, finding his Big Voice. It wasn’t as scary as his Authoritative Voice, but it was firm and very effective at making scared kids believe he had any kind of control over the situation at hand. “Pick up your brooms and come over here.”
Harry took a minute to breathe. Once, twice, thrice. Then he fetched the first aid kit.
Harry’s heart skipped at the mention of Draco, and he belatedly joined the laughter.
Harry’s robes looked almost shabby in comparison—they were clean, and on his body, and they were his favourite set (bought last fall), with loose sleeves and hidden buttons at the front, but at some point the collar had got a bit bendy and Harry had never managed to bend it back.
He tore a blank page out of his notebook and scribbled on top: possible careers. And then he started making a list, anything and everything he could think of. By the time class ended, he’d filled half the page.
He jogged over. “Show me.”
“I didn’t think talking to me was peaceful,” Harry said. “It never was, in the past.” That, and they kept going over some pretty tough topics together when they weren’t talking about books—which could be tough in their own right.
“When it comes to teasing, it’s very important to apologise,” Harry said, looking at each of them. “Teasing isn’t a very nice thing to do, now is it?” He waited for the kids to acknowledge this, then continued. “Who wants to go first?”
And now he was here, a whole fifteen minutes early for his appointment and still muddy from Little League practice, trying not to pace nervously in the small receiving room. There was a comfy looking sofa and a chair, a large potted plant with vicious looking red blossoms, a coffee table covered in a mix of Muggle and wizarding magazines of a kind that Harry didn’t care to investigate further, and a rack full of pamphlets and leaflets and copies of what looked like a Muggle psychology journal.
Harry considered what to say. Would Malfoy judge him for staying up until two to read it? The tiredness was really making itself known by now, and soon he had to leave for the first Little League practice. “I almost dropped it in the bath,” slipped out. “I didn’t, though! I just—I was reading it in the bath and it got late and, uhm, well I didn’t drop it.”
Malfoy nodded. “Thank you,” he said.
“Maybe it likes it there,” Harry said, parking the trolley by the desk. “You like birds, then?”
“To be truthful, Harry, I don’t know. I don’t know enough about it. I don’t think so.” She gave him a reassuring smile. “However, I do think your asexuality may have been a contributing factor to the trauma,” she added. “In that it is where your lack of interest in sex originates.”
“Yeah,” Harry said.
“But…” Draco was clearly still struggling. “I just don’t understand.”
“Yes, of course.” Harry glanced at the pamphlet again, mind still reeling, but his feet started carrying him towards her. He wasn’t ready. He wasn’t ready at all.
A Bludger had rammed into Alice sideways and knocked her off her broom, and she’d lost sight of the Snitch. Faulkner stopped the game, and Harry ran onto the pitch, all the players hovering on their brooms in place as they watched what was going on.
Harry took the ex libris list and quickly sorted Malfoy out. As soon as the new form was in Malfoy’s hand, he shoved it in his pocket and walked out.
“Maybe it’s not about deserving it? Maybe you just get to have it anyway. In my opinion you
“I saw.” Draco’s smile softened, and he moved closer. “You’ve got a great team.”
The kids looked at one another, now clearly worried that Harry was going to take it away from them altogether.
“I don’t bloody know,” he said. “Just…take your things and go.”
“When you came back from prison,” she answered, without hesitation.
He closed his eyes for a second, drawing in a deep breath.
“But…” Harry blinked. It made sense, but yet not.
“What’d you think of it?”
“You think you’re my happy ending?” Draco challenged.
“Right?” Harry agreed. “It was…I was tired. I was so tired. And after a year of training, I just couldn’t do it anymore. I didn’t want to be a person who fights, you know? I never…I never
He’d taken the job at the Archive just to have something to do, and while it’d been okay and paid the bills, it was just that: okay.
“You were never the only one, Draco. There’s all of us.”
“Hey.” Harry couldn’t stop the delighted grin as Draco approached. The cape was heavy enough that it didn’t flutter much as he walked, though it draped beautifully, the whole thing giving him an air of…elegance and stability. “You look amazing.”
“You might,” Harry said. “Maybe not now, but later. That’s what—” That’s what happened with Ginny, he nearly said. She hadn’t said so, but he had seen it in her eyes, read it in her body language every time they’d fought about it. “I wish sex didn’t exist,” he said, viciously. “I hate it.” He immediately regretted saying it and was about to backtrack when Draco just nodded.
Those evenings were Harry’s favourite. Draco was an animated reader; he’d make faces and noises at the book as he went through it, would laugh and cry, and on one memorable occasion he’d stared at a book in disgust for full two minutes and then set fire to it. When Harry asked, he’d just said it’d been morally reprehensible, and when Harry had pressed further, he’d snapped.
“Pass. My nose hasn’t been the same again since, I’ll have you know.” Harry cleared the bench of water with a flick of his wand and they sat, snug under Malfoy’s invisible umbrella, their food hovering just within reach.
“I know what you meant.” Malfoy was looking at him. “Metaphorically, I guess it was about the power of human connection to stop evil. But on a basic level…it was about overcoming centuries of prejudice and rage and hate—on both sides—and…working on building bridges.” The left side of his mouth tugged upwards. “Or to put it crassly, bone the enemy for world peace.”
Then he went to sort out all the documents Draco had piled up over time in the borrowed study. The painting on the wall was chipper, the hummingbird in it flitting about, the painted sunlight glittering off its iridescent feathers. Unless somebody else wanted to use the room, Harry probably wouldn’t see that hummingbird for a while.
Hugh and Betty whooped, and soon enough the kids were racing each other off the field. Harry followed at a more sedate pace, taking a moment to himself. Being a childminder could be tough sometimes, and never tougher than when he had to deal with his kids’ emotional well-being.
“Oh,” Draco said, mesmerised. “It’s very much like bath potions? But there’s not a trace of magic in this.” He dipped his fingers into the water, swirling some of the pink with the blue. “None at all.”
She followed his line of sight. “Yeah,” she said. Her voice was as hoarse as Harry’s was, but he thought maybe he detected something else in it. “Don’t be long.”
“Yep, that’s probably a good quality to have,” Ron said, with a grin.
“I hadn’t really thought about it,” Harry admitted. “But it makes sense? Does it help, with your anxiety?”
He wasn’t sure he meant it, and judging by the look on Peony’s face, she was aware of it.
Harry stared at the small stack. The topmost book had a black star strewn cover, with a large non-earth like planet on it and a space ship in front, and the title printed in large silvery letters.
to just be a normal fucking person!”
Avery pointed his broom towards the other kids and went off, and Harry turned to Charlie. He was still kneeling by the broom, so he had Charlie at eye level.
Draco nodded. “Big Gay Pub Night, though?”
Basically, sex is hella complicated! Who knew!
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Doesn’t matter now, though, does it?”
meant different things to different people, and if Harry left it late enough he’d be too soused to get up to anything with Ginny, which saved him the embarrassment of plain turning her down. He just…wasn’t in the mood.
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged. It wasn’t a complete lie. He was feeling okay. Comfortable, even. It was always a bit strange, like there was this great physical relief and bliss, but there was also the part that was just okay.  It was the after that was usually a mess, that was the part he couldn’t control, that sometimes hated everything, and sometimes didn’t. What he’d tried to explain to Gladys last week, and that he wasn’t sure he’d really managed to get across, or understand himself. Maybe it’d be okay this time. It felt like it could be.
“Keep it, toss it, I don’t care,” Ginny said. “What do you want to do about the flat? I think I can withdraw from the lease if you want to stay, but I don’t want to just leave you hanging with the rent all by yourself…”
“So…to be clear, this is not some kind of ploy to get back together?”
“Oi!” Ginny called out. “How’re you going to top that next weekend?”
“I didn’t make that decision,” Malfoy said, grinning. “I’m not a fan of it either, to be level with you. In the second half of the book he has several orgies, one of them including Beings. I won’t spoil you for which ones. That’s a surprise best served…as a surprise.”
“I should bloody hope so,” Draco said, smiling back. “You free to go? You need to change.”
Betty and Hugh were only four, too young to join the team and not quite as coordinated when it came to Quidditch because they were still developing. Avery, Charlie, and Alice all had a year or more on Hugh and Betty and were naturally ahead. And now they also had more training, a team affiliation, and actual games (well, so far only the one) to play. No wonder they were feeling good about themselves.
“Yeah.” Harry didn’t really know what to say about it. He sort of got what Malfoy had meant about it being a commentary, but felt he lacked context. “It would’ve been great with some annotations,” he confessed.
of it, but I can’t control how I feel—”
“Ahh…actually, never mind.” Malfoy shook his head, taking a step back.
They exchanged hasty of-course-see-you-later smiles, and Harry left them to enjoy the game. He was the only one who’d come out today; everyone else was nursing hangovers and Ron was manning the shop. Hermione had some prior commitment as well, though Harry couldn’t recall what it was, or even when he’d last seen her. He made a note to book her for lunch soon.
She was at her most beautiful like this, Harry thought, watching her as she somersaulted on the broom, then zoomed towards the ground. Her teammates followed. She was at her most beautiful like this: full of life and excitement and determination.
Abruptly, Harry realised that he couldn’t expect Draco to be the same as Ginny, that it wasn’t just him—he and Ginny might’ve been incompatible in the end, but he and Draco didn’t have to be.
“Well—yeah. I promise I won’t drop it in.”
“No, it’s not…” Harry drew in a deep breath. Malfoy had told him he was writing a book about dying, that he was in therapy for anxiety…and he’d promised to lend him more queer books, he’d…the least Harry could do was answer this one question. “After I served out my prison sentence and community service I was offered a spot and since I had nothing else to do, I accepted it. And everyone else expected me to take it, you know? I was
Malfoy smiled, and offered Harry some of the curry that was levitating by his elbow. “I suspected you would. You like to see the best in people.”
“Like?” Harry prompted. They were almost at the Direction Alley entrance—or exit.
Ginny nodded, getting up. “Yeah. I don’t know what…I’ll leave.” She left her mug of tea, still untouched. “Can I ask you something?”
“Same reason I still slice my bread by hand: habit.” Harry fell in step with Malfoy, peering over his shoulder to see what was on the menu today. Steak and kidney pie, it looked like. “You want to sit outside?”
She came out eventually, trunk floating after her. Harry did the decent thing and stood up to see her out.
The pamphlet from the therapy clinic had something in it about how to help ease the person with anxiety, but the only thing Harry could remember was the bullet point about removing them from the situation that was causing them anxiety in the first place.
“Didn’t hear you,” Harry said, grinning.
“Yeah.” Her voice vibrated. “Okay.”
“What about the Yule Ball?” Harry asked, perplexed.
“I’ll be fine,” he said, the crease between his eyebrows deepening. “I’ll eat when I get home.”
They started walking.
When he returned to the table Draco was listening to Seamus talk about horses.
Malfoy pulled the string shortly before closing hours—for the first time since settling in with his reports—and Harry found that Malfoy just wanted reassurance that he could really keep the documents he was looking at in the room without having to return them.
“I should think so.” Harry grinned. “One of the perks of having private study rooms is that they’re untouchable by anyone who doesn’t have authorised access, which means that only the user—you—and the staff here, can enter. So any documents you request up from the strongrooms can stay here for as long as you need them.”
“Bloody feels like it!”
“What?” Draco’s fork clattered onto the table. “Oh no, Harry, love, I was never going to break up with you—shit, shit, shit—” He scrambled out of his chair and in a flash he was in front of Harry, his hands on Harry’s face, his thumbs swiping over Harry’s cheeks.
cry, he should
The laneway was near a station on the Northern Line, so getting to Camden was quick. Draco, who hadn’t been on the tube before, was fascinated with the turnstiles and the Oyster cards, and was delighted when he got his to work so he could go through. Harry forgot to be nervous for a moment, watching how pleased Draco was with himself, and how much he enjoyed the entire journey.
Coming here had been a mistake.
“Yeah?” Harry looked at him. “How smug?”
“I didn’t know what else to do,” Draco said, cheeks pink. “While waiting, I mean.”
to teach the kids) orchestrating a close meeting with the grass for the other Seeker. The scores were even: if Candy Cranes got ahead by ten points, the Butterfly Bumpkins were quick to catch up or overtake them, and vice versa. There were a few more fouls and resulting penalty shots (Charlie and Rachel blocked them all, which had Harry and Ginny both jumping and screaming) and Love managed to not bash anyone’s nose in, though she did steal an opposing Beater’s bat one time to throw it back at his head.
The rest of the week continued in the same manner. Draco had remarked on Harry’s jittery hands and scatter-brained-ness when he’d come to pick up Harry from training, but Harry had brushed it off,
“I won’t pretend what you said didn’t hurt, but I shouldn’t have pushed you like that. I shouldn’t have let my feelings get in the way…” Draco put a bowl down in front of Harry, full of fragrant rice and steamy curry. “I’m sorry.”
. The article didn’t mention what kind of therapy, what it’d been about or how long it’d gone on for, but maybe Gladys would know.
They hadn’t bought any new things together for this flat, not really. Harry had bought the bookcase all on his own, had seen it in the window of a Muggle shop near the Quidditch Daycare.
“Maybe,” she said. “If you get the certification.”
Seamus was explaining the breeding program to Padma when Blaise turned up. He’d brought a date, a guy that looked vaguely familiar (so Heather was no more, apparently) but that Harry couldn’t place at all.
“I know, but Muggles think wizards and witches all wear pointy hats,” Harry explained. “You know, like on the covers of those novels. And my cousin used to be terrified of magic and wizards, might still be, so…go all out?”
Draco had pushed his food aside as well, and was twisting his hands instead, so Harry reached over and took Draco’s hand in his. He had nice hands, strong, slender fingers, but his palms were rough. Harry didn’t know what to do to help calm him down, or what exactly was wrong, but something wasn’t right.
figure it out?”
He looked lovely like this, Harry thought. That smile suited him. And Harry really,
Well. There were dust bunnies where the bed had been and a lingering smell of sex in the air, so Harry vanished the dust bunnies also and opened a window.
Asexuality had nothing to do with dying, she’d said. There were limited resources and knowledge about asexuality, she’d said, but one thing she did know: it didn’t come from death.
“It hurts,” Harry finished. “But there is—Draco, there
“Now?”
“Well,” Harry said, pausing. “That’s quite all right.”
Fuck everything. Fuck every fucking thing.
“All right,” Harry cut in, before they could wind each other up again. “Betty, I thought you liked the yellow bat best?”
“Well, I…” Malfoy trailed off. “I’ve given you a lesson in house-elves.”
Peony agreed to this and they exchanged a hasty kiss before Julie left and Peony returned her attention to Harry. “I, uh—sit?” She glanced at Draco. “You can stay,” she added, voice shaky. “I mean—”
Harry sighed, leaning on the trolley.
Hilde gave him a look like
“Avoiding…? I haven’t been avoiding you!” Harry sputtered. “I’ve just—I’ve been having lunch with Draco. And,” he added, “I’m in school now, and coaching a Quidditch team, so you’ll forgive me if I’m a little busy these days.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “It was nice to meet you,” he said to Rhosyn. It probably wasn’t a lie. She looked nice, at any rate. “I need to get going—”
It wasn’t lying when one was being evasive, right?
“Did we win?” Harry asked, breathless, as he watched the Candy Cranes Chasers drop the Quaffle a short distance from the goalposts. Lee was yelling, the kids were running onto the pitch to meet their teammates, and Ginny was laughing.
“Good afternoon,” Harry said, offering him his best customer service smile. Ron claimed it made Harry look absolutely frightening, but Hermione had given it one look and said
“Ugh, shut up,” Harry grumbled.
The game passed almost without Harry’s noticing, and before he knew of it, it was over and the Harpies had lost.
“Oh.” Malfoy paused. “Well. What kind of books do you like to read?”
“Ugh.” Harry stared into the container. It looked like Chinese soup of some kind, with dumplings in it. “Half my daycare kids are on my Little League team, the other half aren’t, and since yesterday we played our first game and won, the half that’s on the team has been, quite literally, gremlins this morning, and the other half has, naturally, been upset. And of course, as kids get hungrier and hungrier…” Harry trailed off. “Things were on
Reluctantly, Avery handed it over. It was half a sheet of paper big enough to cover half the table, cobalt blue and crinkly. “Hmmm,” Harry said, deliberately drawing it out. He took a seat by the table, laying the paper out in front of him.
“I wanted to show you that despite your best efforts, I’m great,” Harry said, still looking at Draco, trying to draw some comfort from the fact he was there. Draco was there for him. He was undeniable proof there was at least one person who actually cared about him and his well-being. “That no matter how hard you tried, you couldn’t squash my magic or my will to live, or, or, my person. I still exist. I’m me. And I made it happen.”
“I thought you didn’t mean it, before,” Draco answered, still flushed. “It wasn’t—it just seemed like a thing to say, random, not really…”
? “Don’t you want them?”
“They’re great!” Harry grinned. He knew now where to take Malfoy on a date. “They make the bathwater nice,” he explained. “I can take you to a Muggle store that sells them, you can see them and pick some out for trying.”
The teams were fairly evenly matched, but Harry noticed that his team had more players on the roster. They wouldn’t tire as easily, and everyone would get a turn—if by the time two hours had passed and the Snitch hadn’t been caught, the game would end and the team with the most points would win.
“You get used to it.” He led Malfoy directly to the bath bomb section, where tables and baskets were piled high with bath bombs in all kinds of shapes and colours. “These are bath bombs,” he said. “You put them in your bath and they fizz and melt, turning your bathwater into…well, what you want to turn it into. There’s different ones for different things.”
“I’ve missed you too,” Ginny said. “But not like…”
So did Harry’s. Non-verbal magic wasn’t uncommon for children, but it usually took on more…accidental forms. Curtains catching fire when a child was angry, for example, or a bad haircut growing out after a night of fear and wishful thinking. “Well done,” he said to Alice, and made a note to talk to her parents later.
Unfortunately, Harry decided to come over and look at the Tough Mudders recruitment leaflet as well. Something he was apparently incapable of doing without first pressing his entire left flank against Draco. Harry’s disregard for Draco’s personal space was an ongoing problem, mainly because Draco liked it so much.
announce that you can identify a murder suspect in the middle of an interogation and then prance off into the sunset.”
“Hey, hey Harry; hey, it’s ok.” Alicia was crouched in front of him. She must have moved while he was looking at Draco and Mafalda. “It’s alright; don’t be upset.”
“Oh.” Draco toyed nervously with his cuffs. “Sorry.”
Malfoy merely shrugged and lowered his voice. “Talented taste buds and a penchant for sucking cock.” He winked.
“But that doesn’t change the fact that I want to make at least two hundred and seventy-three bad treacle tarts with you.”
“Oh no, not everything is about sex. Unless you’re a fan of feederism, I don’t judge!” She cut a large slice and offered it to him. Smiling in relief, he took the plate and they stood in companionable silence, munching cake.
“Perfectly.” Something in Draco’s back twinged as he straightened up and he decided that this conversation could be had just as easily sitting down. Slipping into the chair opposite Potter he smoothed a hand through his hair and smiled in a way that his mother said made him look ‘dashing’. “There appears to have been some confusion with my reservation I–”
“Thanks,” Harry told the girl awkwardly and set out after his friends. She waved after them, laughing.
Taking a deep breath, Harry focused on the prick pot. He remembered the thrill he’d felt when the bottle landed on Draco for the second time. He remembered the feeling of Draco’s fingers tangling with his as they both reached for the Snitch. He thought about pale grey eyes and white hair and a quick wit and soft touches.
As Harry watched the group on the twins’ bed rip into the chocolate while the Slytherins shifted uneasily on the sofa, he came to two realisations. The first was that this team bonding thing seemed to be working. Everyone was still awkward as fuck save for Oliver and Marcus who were snogging, and—to be honest—could do with being a bit more awkward.
“Sort us out,” Harry sighed, leaning back slightly against the counter.
“Slick-” Harry spluttered. “SlickEasy’s?” This was abominable, unjust, and straight up sacrilegious. “That, is a - a blatant
“There’s nothing wrong with being a Muggle,” said Harry.
Lunch is nearly over, and Draco’s mind continues to be firmly fixated on Harry’s lower back.
“What’s it called?” asked Harry, still smiling at Draco. “Thank you,” he mouthed, smiling even wider when Draco shrugged and then smiled back.
“Well…” Harry shook his head, rubbed a muddy hand across his face. Then the words came out in a rush as if he’d been brewing them for a while then just decided “fuck it” and dropped in a handful of lizard’s toes. “I only joined the team because you did. And Ginny was really excited about the mud race, but mainly for you.”
The muffled thumps filled the small room, followed by a small groan as he stood, sidestepped the still floating prophecy, and reached for a quill.
“Green? That’s what you’re partial to? Green?”
“Just… tell me?”
“Keep your voice down.”
Draco’s mind hurtled back to late nights in the Eighth year common room when neither of them had been able to sleep, sitting in awkward and then not-so-awkward silence as the fire burned low. He thought about stilted apologies, halting explanations, hesitant thank yous.
“Really?” Harry was falling asleep. “Now m’going to have nightmares about Snape in leg warmers on a treadmill.”
“Cheerio.” Draco waved a distracted hand. His attention was already back on the form.
A shout from George alerted Harry to the fact that the game was ready to resume. This time he made sure to spin the bottle gently, his stomach clenching as he watched it twirl across the carpet. The plastic bottle spun for a lot longer than the glass bottle had, and Harry swallowed against the unease that was starting to bubble up inside him.
It wasn’t until the time loop had restarted for the 27th time — following an attempt by Draco to leave the restaurant via the skylight — that Draco resigned himself to his fate. Judging by the fictional adventures of Timmy the Grumpy Troll, it was clear that the time loop Draco was currently trapped in would keep restarting until he had learnt the error of his ways and become a kind, sensitive, enlightened
Draco tried to imagine what it would have been like if his parents had done something similar, especially during his 5th and 6th years.
“I do not have a pointy face.”
“You think?”
“I’m also on a date with a man called Liam.”
“It’s seriously fine,” said Potter, moving the tapped hand away from Draco and signalling for the waitress. “Don’t worry about it, I-”
“Bollocks.” Harry interrupted. “Literally.”
“No he isn’t.” “I can assure you I am not.” Draco and Ginny spoke at the same time.
“Funny you should ask, Draco,” Potter's eyes twinkled as he turned towards Draco. “I’ve actually always been a bit partial to green.”
“Fine.”
Later, sitting at the pock and pencil marked table, Severus replayed the words of the prophecy. A pure-blood and an impure-blood who had witnessed Voldemort’s death. Magical cores. Presumably, the prophecy was not referring to wand cores, unless the writer pictured Potter choking down a dragon heartstring and a hank of unicorn tail. Magical essence, then. The indefinable, intangible,
Figuring he might as well give their teammates a show, Harry pressed forward, sliding his hand around the nape of Draco’s neck. Soft, ungelled hair brushed against the pads of Harry’s fingers. The others were still screaming and one of the Slytherins had even started singing, but Draco’s lips really were rather soft, his tongue becoming more insistent as Harry twisted himself into a better position.
“Er, no. I was hungover and I thought it would be nice,” said Harry, carefully avoiding Draco’s eyes. “You know. Small animals. Cuteness. Stuff.” He was pleased to see Ron nodding along, although Hermione still looked like Harry had just dumped Tod’s lifeless body on the pub table.
“They are my friends.” Blaise interrupted him. “The Weasleys. Their family has been very supportive of my transition-”
“Are you sure you don’t want this?” Hermione stage-whispered, brandishing the sandwich.
it made his head hurt. What did it matter if he was unable to recite all Umbridge’s silly rules at the drop of a Sorting Hat? He was still capable of telling when a pair of students were engaged in covert activities for The Order and Blaise was hardly an obvious suspect. Ginny on the other hand… “Leave. Now.” Draco turned to Janice. “Unless you wish to put my status on the Inquisitor Squad to a vote of confidence? In which case I would find myself compelled to ask Professor Umbridge to investigate your own activities on the night of the 23rd.”
“Did I pass out?” Draco asked.
“Like a horoscope?” Ron asked, apparently agog.
Harry gave up on sleep around 4am. The sugar from the vending machine snacks was still fizzing through his bloodstream, the events of the game pinballing around his mind. Every time he closed his eyes, he remembered the way Draco had pressed forward to kiss him. Every time he opened them, he remembered that the kiss had happened on this very bed.
“No, I haven’t hit my head.” Harry exploded. “The fucking dates, the dates, the dating thing we’ve been doing. You know, where we date. That thing.”
“He kissed me back,” said Harry, lowering his voice and ignoring Draco’s coughing fit. It was suddenly very important to avoid all eye-contact.
“Sure.” The woman offered the plate to him. “Come visit me at my stand later. I’m here to promote my bakery.”
“Have you tried charm?” Poppy suggested when Minerva broached the subject. The school nurse was still flushed from the excitement of the match and the lack of blood was clearly affecting her cognitive abilities because-
In which someone else finds out about Draco's furry little problem.
“Come again?” Ginny appeared to be equal parts confused and delighted by Draco’s question. Blaise was just confused and Janice was clearly about to tear the desk out from underneath him if they didn’t start torturing
"Dumbledore is already aware of Slytherin's generous benefactor." Snape interrupted Flitwick. Above their heads, the staircase began to swing down to where the Professors waited.
“So it’s weaker, then.”
“Seventeen,” said Snape, smiling like a Venus Flytrap. “Let us see if we can replicate this success. Ms Granger, perhaps you and Draco can start.”
His mind flashed to a drunken night, a few weeks ago. He and Malfoy had attended the same Ministry Ball and, after bumping into each other on the balcony and complaining about the terrible food choices, they set out to drink as much as they possibly could in order to forget how hungry they were. Well past tipsy, Harry brushed against Malfoy whispering “my place” into his ear before heading to the fireplaces. It was the only night that they spent together without having sex. Instead, deciding they were still ravenous despite all the booze in their bodies, they set out to make a sloppy, crumbly, overly-sweet treacle tart.
“A quick tug in the bathroom?”
Maybe the change is simply the way Draco is finally letting himself look at Harry. Letting himself take in broad, slightly curved shoulders. The way Harry’s t-shirt is still rucked up on the left side, showing off the soft swoop of his belly and revealing to the outside world the tattoo,
“Seventeen,” Draco spoke. “We did seventeen, my lucky number.” He turned to smile at Harry and Hermione, neither of whom smiled back.
to secure the weapon?” A faint crease appeared between Umbridge’s eyebrows.
“Should I have tried to save you? Would that have made a difference? You know,” Harry rushed on, “In fifth year, if I’d tried to talk to you about stuff would that have... have...” his voice disappeared, lost in the quiet room.
“We should do this somewhere…not here.” Harry heard himself say. Draco blinked and then sat back, smiling smugly.
Draco Malfoy looked like he hadn’t slept for at least two months, if not more.
“No, natural ingredients. That one is good for sleeping, it has lavender, ylang ylang and…tonka? I think it was tonka. I like it. It turns the water purple and it makes you really calm.”
“In this weather?” Harry blinked. There was outdoors seating connected to the café, overlooking the garden behind the Archive rather than the narrow path leading from Direction Alley to the Square, but nobody used the garden this time of year. “Uhm, sure?”
“That’s not what I meant!” Harry blurted. “It’s just—it was fine, Draco. I didn’t hate it. I just wanted you to have a good time, and so maybe I’m not, I don’t know, comfortable with
.” She shook her head. “But there you have it: he didn’t forget.”
Harry wished he could just close the door on her, but that would probably end this tentative friendship they’d cobbled together. “I know,” he said, after a pause and then decided to tell her a half-truth after all. “I just don't think talking to you, of all people, is fantastic idea. Not about this.”
“You know what,” Harry said, finishing up Hugh’s face with band aids. “I understand that the big kids are really annoying at the moment, but I think we should all be friends, right? So no more fighting about bats, or brooms, or gloves, or helmets, or anything.”
“I know.” Malfoy wasn’t looking at Harry. “There’s nothing I can say that will excuse or justify how I and my family treated him. I can’t justify any of it.”
“Maybe you don’t mind, but you’re bored dumb.” Ron kicked his chair again. “So let me try again. Congrats on the victory yesterday, well done, hilarious catch, your team is fantastic.”
“That should go both ways,” Draco said. “You didn’t like any of it, then?”
“I thought the rule was one charity,” Hermione commented with an eyebrow raised. Beside her, Ron shook his head, grinning.
“I tried a soft coming out first,” she went on. “I told my parents I was bi because I hoped it wasn’t as bad as being trans, and that they could accept that—I had this idea that I could live with just being bi if it meant I could keep my parents. But Dad freaked out and nearly disowned me, Mum—well, she came around, and talked Dad around too. About a year later I couldn’t deal with that anymore and came out to them properly. Dad really did disown me then, and Mum looked at me like—well, you know how she gets. So that was that. I cut ties.”
He’d also become keenly aware that every day he had been looking forward to a few minutes of awkward conversation with Malfoy, and that he probably shouldn’t have been.
“I doubt you mean that, but thank you,” Malfoy said, then started down the hallway. Harry watched him go until he’d turned the corner and vanished out of sight.
They looked at one another, hesitant, unsure, but then Harry extended his hand. “I’ll see you around, P,” he said.
, for lack of other words, he’d…just do it. Get that part over with.
Harry turned to the nearest security guard. “Can we have him removed? Before this turns into a
Mildred gave him a pat on the back and some kind words, and then Harry left, Apparating straight home instead of walking.
The kids all nodded, one after the other.
“What’s the matter? I’ve said it before,” Harry said. He grabbed onto Draco’s feet, previously wedged under his thigh, and pulled them into his lap. Draco let him.
“Harry? Are you home?” Banging on the door. “Harry!”
“I’m fine.” She glanced back at Rhosyn, who was patiently waiting and still pretending she wasn’t following their conversation. “Was there anything else?”
Harry considered this. “Kind of,” he eventually said. “I think for me it was more…slow. Like…Dean and Seamus came out
Draco froze. “They
Harry stared at her. “Traumatic experience?” His brain shut down. “Like—like rape?” Nausea filled his throat. It couldn’t be—Ginny would never—that couldn’t be—
“We haven’t been dating that long,” Draco finally said, sitting up a bit straighter. His shoulders were still tense. “It’s not you, I promise, you’re very attractive and I want you very much, I just—I need more time.”
“Oh, Potter.” Draco’s voice was dripping with venom; Harry hadn’t even realised that could happen outside of Ron’s vampire romance novels. “Do try to keep up. Mafalda and Millicent are in a relationship. You know what one of those is? It’s-”
“He’s fine,” said Ginny, tension melting from her shoulders as Ron swung around to give them two thumbs up. She wrapped an arm around Albus’ shoulders and firmly turned him away from the crowd. “Let’s go and wait with the other families. Draco? Would the two of you care to join us?”
“Oh no. How dreadful. Thank god the rest of us only had Voldemort torturing and murdering us.”
“Just a minute,” said Harry. “Cold-blooded, so fish and reptiles?” He waited for nods of confirmation from Snape and Hermione “So you’re saying there’s a chance that we brew the potion, do the charm, and one of us ends up as a Blue Whale?”
“Doesn’t have to make sense.” Millicent was also glaring at him. All the Slytherins were glaring except Greg, who was still gazing mournfully at his stolen water bottle, and Draco, who was back to staring miserably at the floating Quavers. “You don’t kiss someone when the mist is red. Mal already explained that to you.”
Thud. Thud. Thud.
“You thought, you hoped-” Draco corrects himself, “-that I was coming up here to laugh at you for having a tattoo of yourself.”
“Should have known Hermione was up to something, she’s never offered to set me up before.”
“What?” Draco finally looked up from the DDR. “Why are you asking?” he carried on, before Harry could answer "I’m inclined to believe that inviting Voldemort to join us might be slightly less gruesome than asking you to sit through an evening with my parents.”
“Ah,” Rolanda nodded, raising an eyebrow. “He was a bit of an arse.”
“Scorpius?” Draco stood, stumbled at the sudden movement. “What are you doing here? Is he safe?”
Harry glared. Malfoy gloated.
isn’t enough.”
“How did you… she was standing here less than five seconds ago.” Draco turned to Harry in consternation. A consternation that increased when he realised that they were still very much wrapped around each other. “Surely that isn’t possible. Or normal.”
“I am watching.” Harry kept his eyes on Draco’s profile, noting the way the glasses pressed against the sides of his nose.
“Tell us about the cinema,” said Hermione. She and Ron were being very accommodating, something Harry decided to worry about later. For now he wanted to check that he hadn’t imagined his entire relationship with Draco.
sex toys promised plenty of it.
“What?” something hard and cold settled in Harry’s chest.
“Horrible thing to say.” Hermione continued. “If you’re ashamed of Harry maybe you shouldn’t be dating him.”
“Counter charms to Beltane core magic usually involve the death of everyone involved.”
“No, Hermione’s moods tend to burn out pretty quickly,” said Harry. “Still, we should probably do what she said.”
“Oh,” Snape was back to the blinking. “Well. Thank you for accepting my counsel. It was... tolerable.”
The game resumed. Cassius’ spin landed on Millicent, which resulted in a red mist. Millicent decided that Cassius would have to kiss the fossilised chip that Astoria had found down the back of the sofa. Then Millicent’s spin landed on Cassius, who took soggy revenge by demanding that she kiss the chip too, but only after he had left it to soak in the bathroom sink for a few minutes.
“No! Just, just hold for a minute,” said Draco, standing up and making for the door.
?” He made Liam’s name sound like a rude word and Draco puffed up indignantly, only to deflate when he remembered that Liam was nothing more than a figment of Pansy’s diseased imagination.
“Wicked.” Ron’s head jerked up, scanning the crowd. “Do you mind waiting here for a bit? My boyfriend would love this-” it was the first time Harry had heard Ron admit out loud that Cormac was his boyfriend, “-back in a mo.” Ron gave the arse reader an excited thumbs-up and jogged off into the crowd.
“Should you be doing that?” he asked, nodding to her impromptu bookmark.
“N-nothing.” Scorpius gave a rigorous sniff.
Groaning quietly to himself, Draco pushed open the door and almost tripped over a free standing cardboard cutout of a monkey that appeared to be offering Draco a bowl of its own liquid faeces.
Silently giving thanks that he was the only one working at this early hour — Griselda wasn’t the only team member feeling the need to prove herself — Severus gingerly levitated the prophecy and walked it towards the staff room.
“No menus,” she cheerfully informed him. “It’s a surprise selection tonight.”
“Just, reckon I’ve got enough long, thin, prats in my life.”
“I believe it’s part of the Muggle council’s scheme to rejuvenate the local economy.”
“So I didn’t have to kiss Draco?” he asked.
“Yeah, I got it. Same goes for Oliver and Marcus then, but what about-?”
“That’s it then?” He asked, feeling almost light-headed as relief hit. Ok. This was going to hurt but at least he knew.
“Yes!” The arse reader beamed at him. Why was everyone at this fair so bloody happy? Was this what regular sex did to people? Got them so hyped up that they just went around smiling and offering to look at people’s arseholes?
“Course not; where would we be if you haven’t taught us to use the vending machines?” She grinned and gave him a nudge. “The consent charm was invented because some witches and wizards were feeling pressured to get off with people they didn’t like, that’s all. A few ofthem told Helga Hufflepuff and she developed the spell so that we could all watch out for each other. Make sure that no one was being pressured to do something they don’t want.”
“From what I hear it’s more like facts, not rumours.” Ginny glared up at him, refusing to give an inch.
“I.” Snape blinked. “Y-you want me to advise you?”
“Right then, Harry, I believe that you owe us a kiss.” George bounced off the bed and came to stand beside Alicia. “And I for one-”
“Or vagina,” The girl reminded him before continuing. “And, yes, believe it or not, a lot of the time, they do so with great enthusiasm.” For the first time the girl’s face broke into an amused smile. She seemed to be enjoying the abject horror on Harry and Ron’s faces.
“Potter,” said Malfoy, his voice much softer than when he had called Harry’s name earlier.
“Spoken like a true Hufflepuff,” Minerva smiled. “I’ll have you know that this all-or-nothing temperament is no easier to shake off than your own yen to see us all get along.”
*~*~*
“Oh fuck off,” said Harry. “My head was hurting from the memory charm and...” he trailed off as a silvery, translucent otter bounded through the door, swam around their heads, and settled at the foot of the bed.
“So green, then?” the waitress made a note on her iPad and turned to Draco. “And what about you, Liam?”
He blinked at the “dildos” on the shelves and gulped. His arse clenched involuntarily.
. In that moment, Harry wished he had, indeed, faceplanted on the dildos earlier and poked out an eye. At least that would have got him out of this mess. “Come on, Haz! Sucking cock isn’t that hard!”
“I’ve never had shower sex,” he said.
“I care!” Katie’s hand went straight up in the air, her blue teeth flashing.
The others froze.
“I was here first.”
“He really doesn’t remember?” the pale man asked Mr Snape. “Well,” he didn’t wait for an answer, unfolding from the armchair and coming over to stand in front of Harry. “My name is Draco Malfoy.” A long pale hand was extended.
But he did it anyway, a small voice whispered to Draco as he took hold of the rope and tried to work out how to pull himself up the wall without losing a shoe. By the time he reached the top, Ginny was gone, leaving a trail of muddy footprints in the direction of the showers. Angelina and Ernie had disappeared. Only Harry was still there, waiting by the floating platforms.
“And you’re an idiot.” Mafalda turned to Cassius who was quietly groaning into his hands.
“Like the Forest of Dean,” said Harry.
“Hmm, very proper.” She had wrapped his arm around her shoulders and led him back along the dark hallway into a cold bedroom. “You’re sharing with Draco,” he heard her say as she slipped off his trainers.
“I beg your-”
breakfast,” she said, glaring at Oliver who looked like he was about to protest.
Draco blinked. Then blinked again.
“If you want,” Draco shrugged. It was a bit weird with the shirt stretched over his knees like that.
“Where are you going?” Potter asked.
“There would enticing anecdotes, Potter. I am an excellent date. There would be wooing and-”
“Did you... were you running?” The appalled look on Harry’s face was almost enough to distract Draco from the firm hand Tonks had dug into his shoulder.
“I’m just going to be over, er, somewhere else,” he said, backing away from Ron, Cormac, and the 12-foot popping-candy-encrusted dildo they were inspecting. Distracted, he bumped into someone, hard.
“Really?” Draco rubbed his abused shoulder. He must have sounded rather pathetic as Tonks slowed in the middle of setting up her recording charm and shot him an incredulous look.
“No, that was me asking you out on a date.” Harry spoke slowly and carefully, trying to remember just how hungover Draco had been that morning. He’d seemed alright.
In which Draco discovers an unexpected ally.
“Potter’s task here will be to try and guess-”
“I wasn’t too busy. I just didn’t give a toss.”
“Watch it.” Harry quickly unwound himself from Draco, heading over to the climbing wall and scrambling up without giving Draco another glance. “I’m coming for you, Johnson!”
“No rainbow vomit?” Harry grinned. It was, Draco ruefully reflected, a rather lovely sight to behold.
Potter nodded and swallowed, wincing as he did. “That’s rough as fuck. Looks pretty but you can tell it’s supermarket own brand.”
“Well that depends, do you have any other prejudices you would like to air?”
He glanced at the sign above the stand.
“If you are quite finished.” Snape kept his voice low, enjoying the way some Pavlovian response kicked in for the three ex-Hogwarts students as they snapped to attention. “I shall explain everything.”
, but he was fairly sure that having Fudge as an ally could be very useful. Somehow.
“Buckbeak? Are you serious?”
interest but- “This is not a date.”
“Bad boy.” Narcissa smiled, tapping the back of his hand with her teaspoon. “You shouldn’t tease. Binky really is in a lot of pain.”
“Being lied to, manipulated, by your friends.”
“It seems my trust exercises have paid dividends, Mr Potter; the prophecy...” Snape paused, smiling like the murderer a tiny part of Harry still suspected he was, “Has been terminated.”
him back. “Just talking about work, you know. On the old grind.”
“So Muggles have to kiss whoever the bottle lands on, regardless of who it is?” Cassius interrupted Draco. Which was just as well, because Draco was being, in Harry’s opinion, a complete cock.
“No. What do you mean ‘wobbly’?” Draco asked as he scanned Harry for signs of injury. “Ron said you were unhurt? Maybe we should seek a second opinion, excuse me!” He hailed the nearest Healer.
“Whatever he told you-”
“Do you recognise her?”
“That option is still available to you,” said Draco.
“Er, a bit.” Harry didn’t really know what else to say. He, Ron and Hermione
“I reserved this table for my date.”
“Yeah, but that’s because you were a self-obsessed tit who was too busy saving to world to check how my shagging prowess was coming along.” Ron emptied an entire packet of pork scratchings into his mouth and grinned at Harry.
“Oh, right. That’s-”
“Yeah, they can be horrible little fuckers. Guess we know all about that,” Potter gestured between the two of them, offering Draco another grimace, “‘s much worse when it’s your own kids though. What did you do about it? The kids who were mean to Scorpius?”
“I’ll take it from here,” said Draco. “Thank you Janice.”
that it was the nicest interrogation room in the station but the last time
“And how was it for you? Draco?” Hermione asked, still glaring furiously at Harry. “Did you enjoy your nice date? Or was watching one of the most tragic films ever to be—”
“No. It’s, ah...” Draco paused, glanced at Harry. “She’s wearing a mlfmrtyrsbdg.”
“Well. I know that if I saw Parkinson in here I’d try to dunk her, not snuggle her. That’s how most rivalries work.”
“Yes, Potter,” Draco jumped into the conversation, fighting off another shiver at the thought of consuming a cold bowl of mystery cereal, “is there a colour you usually favour? Maybe to exclusion of all others? Hmmm?”
“Breaking up? Who is breaking up?” Draco’s posture was now so rigid he looked he was about to snap in two.
“It’s not that cold,” Ginny yelled, squirming through the rubber tyre tunnel and grabbing hold of the the zipwire. Catching hold of Harry’s elbow, Draco moved them so that they were both standing against the wall and no longer blocking the door. Harry moved easily, his eyes fixed on Ginny as she leapt into the air, travelling less than a foot along the wire before grinding to a halt.
“N-no.” Granger really was laying it on thick, twisting her hands in her robes and screwing up her face as if she’d eaten one too many Ice Mice. “He said it was to be kept at Hogwarts and the DA, er, Dumbledore’s Army, were supposed to distract you.”
“What about them?” Draco’s tone was scornful, his eyes sparkling. “Those three players tasked with keeping track of one ball?”
“Right,” Blaise’s eyes flicked to Draco. “Well, here I am.”
“Nah, I just made that up.” She gave him a big smile, her white teeth flashing.
“My father’s houseguest is on his way. He asked that I secure the weapon, immediately.” Draco could only assume that whatever reason Granger had for luring Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest was better than her woeful playacting.
The right thing to do would be to wake him up with swift kick to the shin. After a few moments Harry rolled over to stare at the wall, leaving Malfoy to whatever nightmare had him in it’s grip.
No, what was really bothering her, Minera realised as she untangled a pair of amorous Slytherins en route to dinner, was that she hadn’t done any flirting.
Lisa showed Harry the types of e-readers they had in stock and explained how they all worked, what his options were, where to find the books and how to get them onto the device. It was all very exciting and Harry thought Draco might enjoy the e-reader—if nothing else, he might have an academic interest in it, as this small piece of technology seemed magical all on its own—but he was going to need a credit card and a computer and an internet connection to load books onto the device, none of which he had. He didn’t know how to use a computer either, though he’d seen them at the Muggle library he’d visited to look up Peony. Maybe he would go there and ask for help. Later.
“Harry,” Malfoy said. “Harry. Potter.” His voice was unsteady, a bit shaky, as if he was trying to deliberately keep it calm. One hand was hovering just an inch from Harry’s arm, as if Malfoy wasn’t sure whether to touch him or not, as if he was afraid Harry would bolt if he did. As if Harry had turned into a skittish animal.
“Good game, Harry,” Oliver said. “Though you had a run for your money. The teams were evenly matched today.”
“Are you sure this is okay?” Malfoy gestured at himself. He was wearing his usual outer cloak over a set of moss-green robes that Harry had come to recognise as Malfoy’s Wednesday outfit. Everything was neatly tailored, impeccable, and looked good. “I have a change of Muggle clothes with me just in case.”
Harry was losing his voice, but he didn’t care. He couldn’t have asked for a better first game. “All right, all right! Players!” A few more shouts and he got their attention. “You were all amazing! This victory was well deserved!” The kids cheered. “But don’t forget. What do we do when we win?”
?” Harry accused.
Harry’s heart swelled to bursting and he couldn’t keep the grin off his face. “
Harry didn’t know exactly
—to get it just right, to just be, and exist, and
holding hands? Was that something they could do? And from that moment on, everything they said or did would have…a different colour to it, a romantic intent laced through everything, and maybe Harry was going to throw up.
“Yes.”
Draco was staring at him openly, a peculiar look in his eyes Harry hadn’t seen before. It looked a little like desperation. “Maybe,” he said. “Yes, I mean. It’s better. Have you always been able to do wandless magic?”
“Lov-lovely to meet you,” Peony said to Draco, glancing between them. “This is Julie. Uhm. My girlfriend. Uhm.”
Malfoy nodded in agreement. “I don’t think so either. I detected several inaccuracies, and it had an…unfortunate slant of magical supremacy. Even so, I thought the romance was sweet.”
It was a short walk to the College; back to Direction Alley and then down the small path past the Archive which led onto Toothill Square, where the College was tucked in between the Archive Garden and the White Hart.
,” Harry said, glad that Draco noticed. “It just came out. I thought we could read it together maybe.”
Mystified, and not altogether unaffected by his admission that Malfoy was looking cute, Harry tried to pull himself together. “So…more of those for you today, then?”
Harry had been looking forward to Little League practice, especially since they wouldn’t be playing a game this weekend (they had three game-free weekends in a row, actually, and then two games after that, and then they’d know if they’d make the semi-finals), and could relax a little, have some fun, maybe learn some new techniques that were somewhat more advanced in time for their next game.
“It’ll be my treat,” Harry told him, giddy with excitement now. A date! “So…that’s a deal? A date?”
Harry’s second meeting with Gladys had veered off course in a matter of minutes; Harry had gone in thinking he wanted to talk about Draco, who had indeed come pick him up when his shift ended, and had wound up talking about anger. Or lack thereof.
Harry’s resolve wavered. There was still Sunday for homework, but the book…he wanted to finish it this weekend so he could talk to Malfoy about it over lunch on Monday. On the other hand, it would be nice to come to the pub since he hadn’t gone the day before…but the pull towards the book was strong.
“Oh yeah, I guess.” Harry shrugged. “It’s not that I don’t like it there, but what’s the point when I could be doing all this instead? Old documents aren’t that interesting. But kids are—kids are
“Figures.”
Come Friday, he was exhausted. He’d cancelled lunch with Hermione—actually, he’d cancelled and declined every single social commitment that week—so he could spend his lunch break owling parents the training schedule and the tentative dates for the first games he’d received from Pomeroy. The cut-off for joining the League wasn’t for another week, and the real schedule wouldn’t be drawn up and revealed until after that.
“Arse.” Climbing to his feet, Harry stuck out a hand to help Draco up. “It’s fine to fancy your friends, natural, even. You know what’s not normal for friends to do?” He took a step forwards. Draco was too close to the edge of the platform to give way and the move brought Harry right into his space.
“Are you wearing my hoodie?” Harry asked.
“Well... you’re always so uptight about that time and I thought maybe if I made a joke out of it then...” Potter trailed off and blinked earnestly at Draco.
I honestly though I was genius enough to have made up the meeting between Draco and Yordanka in the corridor. Then I saw
“I want to try it.”
“Skinny and pale? Yeah that’s alright,” said Harry, grinning as Draco’s head snapped up.
“Hmm?” Another thing raising a Slytherin had taught Harry was how truly devastating a one-word answer could be. Although the ex-Professor Snape might have argued that “Pottah” was already familiar with that mode of verbal combat. Thinking about Snape—and what he would have made of their current predicament—distracted Harry and he almost missed Draco’s flustered sigh.
“I don’t want to go where I’m not wanted,” Harry insisted, stirring his tea until it sloshed over the sides of the mug.
“Thought we could do them together,” he called.
“You know what? Fuck—” Ginny lost her grip on the zip wire handles and landed face-first in the mud.
“That’s bloody ages away!”
Draco had thought he was in hell before they viewed the tapes. Suspended in those final moments of knowing that Harry had wanted to go on an actual, proper date with him while also knowing that once Harry saw the tapes he’d realise what a flailing idiot Draco was. Shockingly, life post-tape wasn’t much better. Because Harry had still liked him, Draco was almost certain of that. He’d kept laughing up at Draco in that awfully lovely way and Draco had... Draco had... Draco hadn’t even asked for a second-first date and Harry thought Draco didn’t even want to go on a date with him and so probably wasn’t going to do the decent thing and asked Draco on a date. Which was exactly the kind of idiocy Draco should have learned to expect.
“Says the man dating someone who owns three pairs of compression leg warmers and a Shake Wank.”
Approaching footsteps interrupted Draco's musings and he readied himself to leap for the stairs.
“That, Mr Potter, is up to you,” said Snape. “I can offer you guidance, however—”
In which Draco wonders if he should make friends with a Gryffindor.
“Huh? Oh! Well they’ll stick with Shariq if they know what’s good for them,” said Ron, already pushing pint glasses aside to make a Quidditch pitch on the table. “Thing is—”
“Well, well, w-” She didn’t get as far as the third “well” before Ginny knocked her out with a Bat Bogey Hex. Draco had just enough time to appreciate Ginny’s aim before he was taken out as well, along with the rest of the Inquisitorial Squad.
“Not when I lick it off your chest,” Malfoy said, sounding a bit dazed. His eyes were fixed on Harry’s lips and there was a decisive flush spreading across his neck.
“I was calling you a lot of things back in the cafe.” Draco was still staring at the screen. “And I will call you them again if you don’t help me complete this odious task.”
“He wants
“Booooo!” came a cry from the crowd. Fucking
“No,” Potter cocked his head to the side. “You sat down and started banging on about some bloke called Liam, then the waitress brought some drinks over and Hermione texted me. Are you alright?”
As it happens, Hermione did know that Harry hadn’t watched many Muggle films. Although both she and Harry were too busy gapping at Draco to say so and then, in a move that took Harry’s night from bloody weird to bloody what the fuck, Ron reached forward and
“-and I can defend myself. If needs be.” Draco said, primly picking a piece of invisible lint off his right cuff. The movement distracted Harry long enough that the sound of the recording starting up again caught him by surprise.
Draco… Draco is at a loss. Harry does not have a dragon tattoo. Harry has a tattoo that is designed to be seen by anyone, to be admired by anyone. As tattoos are, Draco reminds himself. That is, generally, why people get tattoos, temporary or not. People do not just go around tattooing themselves with symbols of their old school rivals, no matter how much Draco might-
” Malfoy visibly swallowed, “or like a…
, Malfoy had said. Did that mean another time in a friend way, or was he turning the friend date down because he wanted a
“No.” Draco exhaled. “I’m not ready for that. I was just…I don’t know what I was thinking, really. Just wondering.”
Charlie blocked a goal and Harry yelled, next Denise, Dorcas, and Rachel had the Quaffle and shot towards the other end of the pitch, passing it between them and narrowly escaping both Bludgers—and scored. Ten points ahead. Six minutes to go.
“Yes, Mr Harry!” Anthony was clutching his broom, following the game—or the Snitch—intently.
Malfoy laughed. “Well, as far as I know, Muggle robots don’t do that either in real life. As a metaphor, though…you can say a lot about a lot of things by dressing them up as something else.”
“No pub?”
“You did,” Harry confirmed. He was crouching in front of her and could see plainly the wobble of her lip and the fear still in her eyes. This wasn’t the first time she’d accidentally set something on fire and she’d been so frightened the first time that she’d refused to participate in any activity for weeks afterwards. “Sometimes big emotions turn into big magic,” he said, trying to explain.
Harry had thought about it. And he’d thought about it some more, and eventually he got tired of thinking about it, so by Wednesday he’d decided to
“But?” Seamus prompted. He was grinning, and Harry couldn’t quite determine whether he was teasing or not, so he opted for drinking his ale instead of answering the question.
“I did love you,” Ginny said after a breath. She was crying, but silently. “Still do. But you never—I didn’t feel like you loved me. Not in the same way. It was like I was just…I don’t know, some kind of means to an end, or an ideal personified, or something—I don’t know. As much as you talked about wanting kids, you never were very interested in actually making them.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, glancing back at Draco. He couldn’t help the smile; Butterfly Bumpkins may have won their first game, but that was nothing compared to the elation Harry felt when he looked at Draco. “You can say that.”
“I wanted it for you,” Harry then said. He didn’t know how else to explain. “I wanted you to feel good. I liked that, it was great. I liked making you come. I liked seeing that side of you.”
“Yes, it’s not that strange. Lots of people go to therapy.” Her tone was defensive, and Harry had to fight the urge not to laugh.
“Not really.” The paper bag with the new bath bombs sat in Harry’s pocket. He could almost smell the violets if he concentrated.
It probably was. “Not yet.” Harry hadn’t finished his tart yet, and there was still plenty of tea in the pot. What was more important was that he didn’t want to go. Malfoy had a lovely voice, despite the posh accent, not too deep, or gravelly. Smooth. Warm.
“Oh.” Draco was blushing. “I—yes.”
Something weird was happening in Harry’s stomach, and it wasn’t just because the food in front of him smelled and looked delicious. The last thing he’d expected was an apology from Draco. “I don’t understand.”
Harry wasn’t ready for this to be the end, not so soon, not ever. He wanted to…get to know Draco, he wanted to still be getting to know him years from now, he wanted to see his woodworking business take off, he wanted to be there when he submitted his dissertation, he wanted to talk about the book he was reading, he wanted—he wanted so many things.
Ron and Hermione shared a look and some badly suppressed giggles.
“Yeah, I see how those are very different things,” Harry said, amused. Malfoy had delivered the explanation as succinctly as if he’d been giving a lesson, but far more excitedly. “It sounds like a fun class.”
“No,” Malfoy said. “I just…I have anxiety. I don’t do well in crowds or around unfamiliar people.” He was quiet for a bit, looking straight ahead. The blizzard had left behind a heap of snow, some of which was already melting and turning into dirty slush. Not in the garden, here the snow was still more or less pristine, save for bird tracks on the ground. “I’m in therapy, actually. For anxiety and other things. It’s why I’m writing a book. My therapist said I should keep a journal or something, so I decided to write a book.”
“I used to be so angry,” he’d said, and Gladys had nodded and asked “Why aren’t you anymore?”
“So what happened just now was that Alice had a Big Fright, and it turned into magic. So the maple tree caught fire. She didn’t explode it, that’s something that happened because maple trees are full of sap, and maple sap is very sweet, like sugar, and sugar likes to burn. Can you smell it?”
“Do you know which position you want to play?” He remembered her being fast—as fast as one could be on training brooms, anyway—and thought maybe she could be a good Seeker. He hadn’t tried the kids on a Snitch, though. Not yet.
“Yeah.” Draco took a moment to compose himself, and Harry waited. “Okay.”
“We didn’t break up,” Harry said. “You broke up with me. And Draco
“I read the one with the spaceship! Uhm, I mean, I haven’t read the others yet, but I read that one.”
And even if Malfoy could maybe be someone he’d
“I feel a bit like I’m about to ride into the night on a dark horse,” Harry told Draco when he came back outside. “All I’m missing is a sword.”
It wasn’t until Harry materialised just inside the front door and saw Ginny’s shoes that he remembered that he’d promised to make dinner. “Ginny?”
“Okay.” Harry looked at him. “Can I ask you something?”
He went through several boxes, systematically finding places for his and Ginny’s shared stuff, throwing out things that were either broken or that they’d clearly not been missing (including several of Uncle Vernon’s cast-off socks that Harry was mystified as to why they were still around—he took great pleasure in setting them on fire) and moving onwards with the process.
It was a close race.
“Of course!” She rang him up and Harry gave her his last twenty-pound note. “I love your costume, by the way. It looks really cool.”
Three weekends in a row with no games at all had allowed them to focus on learning new moves and formations and perfecting the ones they already knew, so when they’d faced Hawkins’ Hawks after the break, Harry had on his hands not a team of five and six year olds, but rather…bloodthirsty gremlins. Hawkins’ Hawks had suffered a crushing defeat, and when the following weekend they'd played Just Us, the Butterfly Bumpkins had gone in with all the confidence in the world and had utterly defeated them.
“Did it catch fire?”
“If you hadn’t gotten with Draco…” She wiped her cheeks one more time. “Would you have considered getting back together with me?”
, the article read.
Just before Harry was going to call the game quits to take the kids back inside to draw pictures instead, or something else docile and less likely to end in premeditated murder, Avery had nearly run Hugh off his broom in his haste to tag Betty, who’d swerved (shrieking) and collided with Alice, who had fallen off her broom as she hadn’t seen Betty coming at all, and had been taken off guard so badly that she unleashed an accidental burst of magic and…set a nearby maple tree on fire. The sudden fire explosion (the maple tree bursting with sweet sap, Harry belatedly realised, thanking Neville for that titbit of information) shocked all five kids into a complete standstill, their brooms dropping from the sky and the kids with them.
“I think Mildred is on front desk duty on Tuesdays,” Harry said.
Harry considered this. “I’m not sure I understand. Edwarde is…he’s not a good person. He’s just not! So far, he has ignored his fiancée—and okay, maybe one shouldn’t get engaged at fourteen—robbed a jeweller’s store, tamed a Granian, and started a revolution, and I’m only on page 73!”
“Okay—yes—okay.” Harry looked at the ceiling, taking a moment to breathe. “So…what now?”
Harry was absolutely dying to kiss him.
“Is that…a bad thing?” Harry asked, suddenly uncertain. The realisation that he’d have to be introduced to Draco’s mum eventually, as his boyfriend, was…mildly terrifying. He hadn’t seen Narcissa since the battle—not even at the trials, though he’d spotted her in passing.
“Yes, actually.” Harry shook Malfoy’s hand. “No backing out now.”
“Right.” Harry found an empty pocket on the inside of his cloak to put it in. “Right. Okay.”
A few minutes before closing time, Malfoy dutifully brought the trolley of documents back to the front desk, and Harry sorted him out a new request form.
Harry stared.
“I only knew about Pansy,” Draco said, voice raw. “I thought we were the only ones in the entire world. And I thought we had to hide it.”
Soon after that their table filled up and they commandeered a second one; Neville and Hannah turned up, as did Blaise with a date Harry didn’t recognise but whose name was Heather, Dean and Seamus came on their heels, and Theo, who rarely turned up for pub night, had come by with a date also (her name Harry didn’t catch). Janie turned up too, with her husband, and then a co-worker of Hermione’s with her husband, so it was the liveliest Friday night Harry had had in a while.
“Yes!” Malfoy said. He was still sitting by the desk, and it was awkward, talking to him like this, but there wasn’t a second chair in the study. Malfoy seemed to realise this, because he rose from the chair, picking up his notebook and pencil. “It was cosy,” he said. “Like…mundane. Just people existing. Loving other people. Or aliens.”
“Oh? So…you’re done?” Harry faltered, nearly missing the plates Anne was handing him over the counter. Today’s course was roast lamb with mint peas. He grabbed them just in time.
“Yes. Well—no to the pub, for now. What are you doing tomorrow? You don’t have a Little League game this weekend, do you?”
The Butterfly Bumpkins had been twenty points short, and had thus lost the game to the Fishes, but neither team had managed to score very many goals to begin with; the Quaffle slipping through wet hands and aims being off at fault all around. The kids had done their best, but it’d been a thoroughly shitty game.
“Okay,” Harry said.
“Oh. What are my options?” Malfoy seemed to have come in unprepared.
The kids looked at each other, Betty rather more shamefaced than Hugh. “I’m sorry,” she said.
… Harry weighed the book in his palm. It was a ridiculous book, but it had been a gift from his best friend. He couldn’t dream of throwing it away. In the end, he placed it on the same shelf as the photo book, but leaning against the opposite wall.
The rest of the day passed in a haze. He retrieved documents for other patrons, helped Fraunces catalogue a collection of letters from an apothecary, and thought about Ginny every second he wasn’t thinking about shorthand, or which order the letters should go in.
“I think so.”
“Isn’t he at yours all the time, though?”
“Avery took it,” she said, mulishly. “He says it’s the best one and he has to have the best one because he’s a professional Quidditch player and only professional Quidditch players are allowed to use the best bats.”
“Read it and find out.” Malfoy took out his notebook and pencil, and Harry understood the conversation was over.
“Everyone, grab a broom. Let’s start by having some fun—we’ll do two teams, six players on each, and just go. Are you ready?”
“Just like that?” Harry blinked. “What about—”
“Changing my name and all,” she clarified. “All the paperwork.”
He led him down the same hallway that lead to the reading hall, but this time he turned to the last of several short hallways on the left, each lined with two to four doors. “We have a bunch of vacancies at the moment, and I got you the corner study,” he said. “It has two windows.” He turned down the furthest of the short hallways and stopped at the farthest door on the right, and opened it.
“I think it does matter.” There was emotion in Ginny’s voice, something thick and heavy like regret. “I think we could’ve been happier.”
He read the article again from the beginning, absorbing everything, underlining words and phrases as he tried to figure out how it applied to him. At the end he paused again.
, so why was it so hard to believe he might’ve found one already?
The idea that you could want someone and still
“So, Peony,” he said slowly. These words were harder. “You pick that yourself?”
It didn’t take long to get Malfoy’s documents. They did their thing, floating out of the boxes of their own accord as Harry waited, but Harry had to pause. Take a breath. Two breaths. Three.
Ron and Hermione shared yet another look.
Draco frowned. “You should have a hot shower, or a bath—” Harry made a noise. “Bath?”
“About deaths?”
, and Harry just didn’t think the theory was all that interesting.
bad the other night, but it was still,” Harry made a wiggly gesture with his hand, “on the verge. All that—I think that came later, after a lot of…not saying no. I don’t know. It’s very confusing. I’d like to get back to a point where it was…not necessarily something I want, but something I don’t mind, and can enjoy? If that makes sense? And I don’t know how to get there. I just think—when I think about how it was in the beginning, it was just this thing I didn’t have a lot of strong feelings about, you know? It was nice enough, fun, even. I think that’s what I want. For it to be like that again, so that I stop worrying about it.” He drew in a deep breath. “But I found out there’s a
“Oh.” Harry blinked. “So…”
“You can talk about buggies,” Harry said. “I don’t mind.”
She must’ve noticed his panic because she gently guided him into her office and into a chair and offered him a glass of water. “Just make yourself comfortable. I’m Gladys Oakland, you may call me Gladys, Mrs Oakland, Hey You, or whatever else you’re comfortable with. How would you like me to address you?”
“I GOT IT!” she yelled, holding the Snitch aloft and almost crashing into Harry.
“Yeah?” Draco lifted the Stasis Charm on the dishes and suddenly the smell of food permeated the air. Roast potatoes and something beefy and spicy and smokey. “I—I hoped to turn the hayloft into bedrooms,” he said, pointing upwards. “A large one for us and then smaller ones for…little ones.”
Harry had never known that Flourish and Blotts had a section for fiction before, or that the fiction section had so many subsections. Large labels proclaimed that these shelves were CRIME, a smaller label divvied them up into Muggle and Magical. Another set of shelves were all YOUNG ADULT, and yet another was HISTORICAL FICTION. Harry was in the middle of it all, staring down between tightly stacked shelves, trying to decide which section of the section of the section he should look at first, wondering if maybe he should flip a coin, or just close his eyes and spin in a circle and buy whatever he happened to grab first.
They’d have to Apparate back to London and then probably take the tube the rest of the way, as Harry didn’t know where exactly this café was that they’d be meeting in. Not to mention, they didn’t want to accidentally drop into a crowd of Muggles…Harry would prefer to avoid getting the Ministry involved.
“Are you seriously asking me that question?”
know,” Padma answered. Pansy nodded. “It’s…more of a vibe?”
Harry closed his eyes, focused his breathing, and thought about the next steps. The ex libris list. The trolley. The levitating platform that wasn’t an elevator. The hallway. The reading hall. The painting with the meadow. Malfoy sitting below the painting, waiting.
“I know.”
The curry was delicious, spicy and hot and bursting with flavour, and Harry had never tasted anything better in his life. Actually, everything Draco had ever made was delicious and the best thing Harry had ever had and it finally dawned on him why: nobody else had ever cooked for him before. Not like this—he’d been fed by other people, of course, but nobody had ever gone out of their way to make something just for Harry, but Draco had, multiple times. He said as much to Draco, between shovelling in forkfuls of curry and rice.
“Yes.” Malfoy put it carefully into Harry’s basket. “Thank you.”
Ginny put her hand on Harry’s back and he flinched away.
So much for hoping this time would be different.
Could’ve been me, is what Harry should’ve said, because if that novel had been about him, then he would’ve been leading the rebellion against the technocratic government, and Draco would’ve been one of the people under its thumb.
Draco had made some kind of French dish—
“It was hard,” Draco admitted. “And it wasn’t ideal, in many ways. My therapist wasn’t happy. I ended up copying your routine, you know?” Harry nodded. “I was supposed to create my own.”
That last part wasn’t entirely true—Harry wouldn’t be here if hadn’t been for Ron and Hermione, and Ginny, and all his other friends, and even Dumbledore and Snape, who’d led him towards Death. And he wouldn’t be here, in this café, talking to his cousin, if not for Draco.
It would be fun, probably. Something for the parents to ooh and ahh over, and the kids to feel accomplished about.
He ran right into Ginny and another woman just outside the exit.
Everything was fine. He just wasn’t in the mood. That didn’t mean he didn’t love her.
“I guess. Look, what’s important to them is that they’re a family, and though it’s unconventional, they’re happy. It works for them. They haven’t told us who the biological father of each child is, though looking at them you could probably guess. But don’t bring it up?” Harry took Draco’s hands. “Are you okay? You’re not really having a freak-out over George, Lee and Angelina, are you?”
An owl pecked at a window in the living room and Harry rushed to let it in, swallowing his bite of toast hurriedly. His heart was thumping. The owl dropped a thick envelope and took off again, and when Harry looked at it he realised it wasn’t from Draco. It was from Gladys.
Harry fed the request form into a different slot in the trolley and waited while three thousand coroner reports made their way to him, floating out of boxes and folders through the air to stack themselves neatly in the trolley. As he waited, the request form copied itself, the copy wandering off to file itself in the archive’s request history ledger.
, and then there was a tiny number 137 scribbled at the very bottom.
closeness—and it all tangled together in his head. Except he’d never actually
All this was going through Harry’s head as he looked over the Quidditch pitch. Either this would be their last game, or they would get to go to the finals next weekend. The kids were clearly full of the same nervous energy Harry felt, getting into small fights with one another over silly things like standing too close, or leaning their broom over another’s, or having accidentally picked up a wrong pair of gloves. He and Ginny had had their hands full getting the kids ready, and now they were standing at the edge of the pitch elbowing each other and hissing.
“Come to the pub with me,” Harry repeated. “It doesn’t have to be tonight, it can be next week, or the week after, or sometime later, but promise you’ll come.”
“Either is good.”
Malfoy made an assenting noise.
“Right. Okay. Yes.” Harry exhaled. He couldn’t argue with any of that, and maybe he could believe that Draco would stick around—he had, in fact, stuck around for six weeks before Harry had cocked up the other night—and maybe he was also actually hungry. “It smells delicious.”
Harry should’ve gone back to the front desk, but he’d wanted to steal a look at the books Malfoy had brought so he skipped into the break room. He’d put them there, out of harm’s way, and had just opened the science fiction novel again to look at the bookplate Malfoy had made, when Mildred came back.
—that game had been fun, some decent plays, the weather had been nice, nobody had caught the Snitch, the teams had been fairly evenly matched.
“That’s really great,” Harry said, even if he couldn’t help being just a smidge jealous. “Congrats.”
a very serious outfit,” Draco agreed, admiring him. “All the better to wear to confrontations.”
His reading was definitely getting faster now that he was doing it regularly. It also helped that the books were good; he agreed with Malfoy that the detective and the wizard should definitely be boyfriends and made a note to pre-order the sequel with Flourish and Blotts the next time he was heading that way. The second he was less sure about, but felt he needed to finish the book before he could really talk about it.
“Do you want to go in first?”
“I thought she was seeing someone else too?” Draco asked.
“I’m sorry, I wasn’t snooping—I mean—I was just…curious,” Harry said, retreating to a professional distance. His ears were burning. “I guess that actually means I was snooping.”
Which were moist, because at some point Harry had started crying and hadn’t even noticed. Draco was saying a lot of things but none of them were registering with Harry, it was all just a mess of sounds, only it was Draco’s voice, posh vowels and all. Warm and gentle. “You said you needed space,” Harry said, and it came out hoarse and wet. “I thought—”
And there was nothing in this moment Harry wanted to undo more than that. Go back in time and stop himself. Go further back in time and stop himself from suggesting they have sex in the first place. It hadn’t been worth it. It hadn’t been worth it at all.
“Come on, Draco,” Harry muttered to himself. “Please write back.” He was, slowly and surely, getting soaked. His weather charm had worn off, and while he’d made sure the kids were comfortable, he hadn’t afforded himself the same care.
ugly parts.”
“All right.” Harry tried not to frown at him; he’d been told it was unprofessional. “Did you want a new request form for the reports you haven’t looked at yet?”
want to be when you were five?” Harry cut him off. “A pain in the arse? You’re doing a good job of it. Leave the kids alone. They signed up to have fun and because they like chocolate. Let them have it.”
Thank you for reading all the way to the end! I hope you enjoyed the fic! Don't forget to leave the artist (the ever-wonderful
“Yeah, that thing. Lee told me about it.”
“I’d love to,” Harry admitted. “But I don’t want to leave you alone in the kitchen all that time. Seems pretty rude to me.”
The table was still covered in the papers Gladys had sent Harry, and the letter from Peony was there too, forgotten. Harry brushed them aside and sat while Draco opened the containers of food he’d brought and dished it out.
“What’s that?” Harry’s seatmate to the right was looking at him.
“I’m gay. And everyone in that epilogue, all those happy couples? They were straight. The one character I thought I could identify with was killed off. And maybe it’s stupid, but there’s no place for me in the real world, so when there’s no place for me in the books I read, it just—” Draco shrugged.
The possibility of either was ringing in Harry’s head.
Seven children ran onto the pitch, clutching their brooms, and formed a half circle around Oliver. The other team did the same.
“You’re engaged to a Slytherin,” Blaise pointed out with a grin. “You picked a side.”
The way Malfoy was looking at the cards was feeding the hope growing in Harry’s chest. “Not at all. I’m keeping one for myself, but the other I’m giving away.”
“I have one,” Harry said, unwilling to admit that Ginny wasn’t here.
“I can see the appeal, I think,” Draco said, when he finished his second cup of tea. “I’m not sure what I was expecting—some kind of latent magic, perhaps, to be triggered by contact? But it’s actually just nice.”
“You brought me lunch?” Nothing was happening the way Harry had expected—though what exactly he’d expected he didn’t quite know. Grovelling, definitely, pleading, probably, and several moments of terror until Draco deigned to forgive him. Not
“They don’t.” At Harry’s nonplussed look, Malfoy explained further: “Only captured elves serve wizards. House-elves are hard to catch, and because they belong to the house—and they don’t tend to move into a house until it’s been inhabited for a while—circumstance led to it being only wealthy and skilled wizards and witches who could capture one, the wealth being a prerequisite for owning and living in a house that was both inhabited by elves and passed down generations, and then of course the skill was a prerequisite for capturing one in the first place.”
The kids were still crying.
“Yeah,” Harry said, not really wanting to get into this debate, with someone like Malfoy—landed gentry, that was, and pureblood, all of it tied up in old money and imperialism. After the War, Harry had learned more about the intricacies of the social and societal structures of the wizarding world and how they differed from (and aligned with) the Muggle world. He and Hermione had looked at one another, and while Harry had retreated from the public eye Hermione had marched into politics, quills blazing and parchment smoking with determination.
“Actually,” Malfoy smirked. “The SlickEasy’s Lube brand, too, was launched by your grandfather about sixty years ago. But then he sold the name, of course.”
“What have I missed?” Draco Levitated a pint, a bottle of wine, two wine glasses and a packet of mini-eggs over to the table. “For you.” He pushed the eggs towards Harry, going a little pink.
—only to be stopped by Narcissa wrapping a hand around his wrist and giving a quick shake of her head.
“What Blaise is trying to say is that even though your dad tried to murder me-”
told him he was a Potions Master and Flavour Tester, but Harry had thought he worked for, like, one of those stuffy wine cellars at the posh end of Diagon Alley? Or something? How could he have known Malfoy was a sodding lube taster? True, Harry had never really asked, but who the fuck would have thought such a profession even existed? Why did everything about Malfoy have to be so bloody exotic and different and intense? From his choice of profession to the feelings he incited in Harry, Malfoy had to stand out at everything.
Smiling fondly at her old friend, Minerva nudged the plate of crumpets across the table. They had been having variations of this conversation ever since they became Second Year Potions Partners and it was time to move on. Or at least, to turn their minds to speculating on how long Malfoy and Potter would have insisted on holding hands if the match had not been declared a joint win.
“What?” Ginny’s mobile face morphed from teasing to apprehensive. It didn’t make Draco feel as good as he might have expected. “Don’t… You wouldn’t do that.”
“Yes,” said Ginny, still smiling.
“Not unless he is sitting in the Minister’s private box.” Draco mentally congratulated himself on slipping that into the conversation so early. The Weaselette was bound to run straight back to Potter with the news that the Malfoys had secured the best seats in the stadium and-
“So you just put it on?” Harry’s sleep-smudged brain made his question come out sounding soft and curious, rather than the barked interrogation he was aiming for.
“I… of course.” Draco nodded, straightening. He felt Potter’s eyes on him as he left the room and found himself wondering if Umbridge was aware that the classrooms were charmed to negate Privacy Spells. Probably not — that didn’t seem like the kind of information McGonagall would see fit to share with Dumbledore’s replacement.
“I feel a bit wobbly to be honest,” said Harry, running a hand through his hair and glancing around at the crowd. “Did they tell you who the suspect was?”
.” He exhaled. “Only my parents knew about me. And now, apparently, all of magical Britain, including my old friends.”
“Look.” Draco shifted in his chair, tugging Harry around to face him. “My parents are a truly wonderful pair of tyrants who I love very much and do not wish to ever expose you to.” It took Harry a few moments to work out what Draco was on about but he nodded, gesturing for Draco to continue. “I didn’t want to scare you off or, heaven forfend, remind you of how I…how we used to be.”
“Pah,” Draco snorted, uncurling his legs and smoothing the undershirt.
“Dunno.” Ron took another gulp of his pint. “Makes you squirm a bit more when I remind you that it’s Malfoy you’re shagging?”
Draco almost replies. “Because I want to see your new tattoo,” is what he actually says, giving thanks that his tone remains light. For a moment he thinks Harry is going to refuse and then…
“Oh, absolutely,” said Malfoy, smiling in a rather frightening way. “In fact,” he reached over the side of the bed to grab two sheets of paper, keeping his eyes fixed on Harry the whole time, “I have rather an extensive list of grievances for us to work through.”
"This is the boys dorm." Greg insisted. "You can't be in here."
“Oh.” Draco’s eyes unfocused. He licked his lips. “Is that what Hermione wants?”
“Yeah, committed to the Janus Thickey Ward,” Angelina muttered, trying to keep the smile off her face as Fred pulled her down next to him on the twins bed.
“Well,” Harry hiccuped. “At least you don’t think I was trying to attack you. Just me being polite,” he laughed again.
Not for the first time, or the hundredth and first time, Draco asked himself why that lurid pack of Weasels was more palatable to Potter than Draco’s own company. Granted, the boy had some questionable views on blood purity, but what was a little bad blood (Draco chuckled to himself) between allies? If Potter wasn’t such a sanctimonious prig, the two of them could be running Hogwarts by now. The Ravenclaws were a law unto themselves but Potter would have brought the prudish ‘Puffs while Draco won the hearts and minds of the more hedonistic Huffles. Draco hadn’t quite worked out how he would accomplish this winning over—maybe a big cake?—but it hardly mattered as Potter had shunned all attempts at friendship.
Educational Degree 31.”
“Right again.” Draco turned to pick up his jacket, apparently considering this conversation to be at an end. Harry stayed where he was, arms folded and eyebrows raised. “I presume the Lovegoods will have owl’d Scorpius whereabouts.” Draco continued, fussing with his glasses case. Glancing up at Harry, he froze. “Yes? Potter?”
“Dad!”
In which Draco is cruelly abandoned. Not that he cares.
“Draco.” Blaise placed a firm hand on Draco’s back, reclaiming his attention. “The Weasleys are my friends, that is why I was meeting Ginny. They are not… they do not have any alliances that might, might impede your family’s wishes and…”
The final admission was barely more than a whisper. It was loud between them, though, echoing their shared thoughts.
“Albus?” Draco had just enough time to wonder if the evening’s series of unfortunate events had concluded with the resurrection of his old Headmaster; before he was being enveloped in a fierce hug from Scorpius.
“No,” said Angelina, shooting Fred a meaningful glance.
“Exactly.”
“Then you’re off the team,” George grinned, reaching down to give the bottle a spin. It caught on the bobbles of the scratchy hotel carpet and barely turned 90 degrees before stopping at Astoria Greengrass. “Alright Tori,” George cheered, laughing when Astoria turned pink.
“Pleasure!” Chrissy all but bellowed, rubbing her hands together. “Now, let’s get started. Ro—we’ve put the girls on the sixth floor, you’ll take them. Boys are on the seventh, so come with me lads and-” She was interrupted by a loud crack as Professor McGonagall Apparated into the hotel foyer.
“When were you going to ask me?”
“Wait,” he told Malfoy and stepped up to him darting a harried glance at the crowd. Merlin. There were even more people in the audience than before. Harry grit his teeth and hissed. “If you think I’m licking this thing off a fucking dildo, you’re out of your mind.”
“You knew Snape was going to do a Memory Charm on me?”
“What does it do?” Draco tries to draw comfort from the fact that Harry hasn’t pulled away.
-+-+-+-+-+-
“Yeah,” Harry said helpfully, shoving his hands in the pockets of his torn jeans.
“Oi, Malfoy!” No longer able to ignore the voice repeatedly calling his name, Draco turned to confront the youngest Weasley.
“Mmhmm.” Draco nodded, pretending to reread the rights waiver they’d been given to sign and very carefully not thinking about the smell of Harry’s cologne. “And yourself?”
“Oh Harry!” said Hermione. “That sounds lovely.”
“Well I don’t know! It doesn’t sound like me.” Harry scrubbed a hand through his hair. “Alright, maybe I would have suggested it. But what’s wrong with that?”
“Nothing.”
Malfoy’s eyes didn't meet his when he replied. “Oh, that one isn’t very good.”
Draco marched out of the Cereal Monogamist for the final time and silence fell in the tiny interrogation room. Harry cast around for something to say and came up short.
“Six am is hardly the middle—”
“Ah.” Potter nodded. “Well I know what that’s like,” he cheerfully slapped his own beer belly and smiled across at Draco. “Hopefully Scorpius is having an easier time of it now that he’s at Hogwarts? Al hasn’t mentioned any name calling.”
“You’re laying it on a bit thick old girl,” said Blaise. “At this rate you’ll have flooded the castle before we reach the Infirmary.”
“It is a bit flat,” a voice from above agreed, causing the Hogwarts Headmistress to glance up so quickly that her hat slipped. Before the newly-trimmed hat could hit the ground, Rolanda had darted down, snatching it up and landing in front of Minerva with a sheepish grin. “Sorry about that,” she said. “Thinking about bottoms is serious business. I shouldn’t have startled you.”
“What an odd question, don’t you know what it looks like?”
A beat of silence and then Draco rolled his eyes, huffing in manner that implied no man had ever been more put-upon than Draco Lucius Malfoy. Sliding down onto his back, he turned to Harry and raised an eyebrow. Harry let the duvet cover them, but there was still a foot of space between them in the bed, and Draco’s eyebrow was right, it wasn’t exactly cosy.
Malfoy had come. Harry pushed the chair back and nearly toppled it over in his haste to get to the front desk.
“That’s a Berylline Hummingbird,” Malfoy said. “They’re native to Mexico. What is it doing in this painting?”
“Mr Potter, rumour has it that you and Ginny Weasley, Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies, are no longer together. Do you care to comment?”
Ginny’s eyes widened. “You still want me to be assistant coach?”
Harry hesitated. “We aren’t technically dating
Fucking patterns. So much for trying to break them—he’d walked right into one without noticing.
“You know him,” Harry said, nonplussed. “We went to school together?”
It was an interesting game, Harry thought, in between shouting encouragement and directions at his players, because it was so completely different from the first game they’d played against the Candy Cranes. Then, it had been the third game in the Series, the team had been enthusiastic but still finding their feet, and they hadn’t let the competitiveness get to them
Evidently the cashier hadn’t seen such a large purchase before either, judging by the way her eyes widened as Harry put the basket on the counter. “Are you running a spa?” she asked. “We do have B2B programs for that sort of thing.”
They went back in, Draco a little red-eyed but a whole lot calmer, and Harry managed to relax just enough to continue to enjoy the evening.
“Harry, you have been living with a pattern of not having your boundaries or personhood respected your entire life, starting with the abuse you endured from your relatives, and continuing in your relationship to your ex. The fact that you’re used to it doesn’t make it right, but it will make it difficult for you to recognise what a healthy relationship can look like,” Gladys explained, patient and gentle as ever. “Your partner accepting that you didn’t want to have sex and then not pursuing it further is a
“Well done, Denise!” Harry yelled as Denise scored the first goal of the game. Dorcas picked up the Quaffle before it touched the grass and threw it to Avery, who passed it to Denise, who made another pass at the goal—and scored again. “THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT!”
Draco sat opposite him with his own bowl of food. “The way I experienced it,” he started, picking his words carefully, “I was upset at the implication that you’d gone through with a sexual activity you didn’t want without telling me about it. And because I was upset, I was rather more…sharp-tongued than I would’ve ordinarily been. I hurt you, and you wanted to hurt me back, and that’s…where we ended up. And for that I’m sorry.”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat and then floated all the way up to his throat. “Yes,” he said, grabbing onto Draco’s hips. “Please.”
“Just because.” There was a reason, but Harry wanted to talk about that even less than he’d wanted to talk about the Auror programme. “They’re great, right? I had help from the kids.”
Malfoy didn’t say anything, only glanced to the side. He was doing something odd with his lips that Harry had never seen him do before—belatedly he realised that Malfoy was chewing on his bottom lip. It was a strange look on him.
“Oh.” Draco stood there for a bit, then seemed to deflate. “I need to apologise too. I brought you lunch—eat with me?”
“No, I mean…” Draco trailed off, frowning. “How do they…” He gestured. “That’s an offensive question, isn’t it?”
“No, I know, but—okay, you know what. I died.
Right. Food. Breakfast first, problem-solving second.
“Yeah, Rhosyn. I’ve met her, she seems nice.” Harry shrugged, then patted down his pockets. He’d stuffed his change of clothes and shoes into a pocket in his robes—not an ideal place, but Draco’s tailor was a genius with pocket charms, so it all fit comfortably and weightlessly—but he needed his Muggle wallet for the trip, and for the café.
“A real team?” She frowned, then glanced at her son. Charlie was watching the pitch; the players had started filing out. “What do you mean?”
“Not really. It’s like…a time out. A small break. Or I read, or…well,
“I’m not sure I’m enjoying it so much as I’m baffled by it,” Harry answered. He came out from behind the desk and walked with Malfoy to his study. “You said it was a coming-of-age story, right, so I thought it was about growing up, or something like that, but…”
“No, that would be me,” said Draco, evenly. “I don’t trust people, on a fundamental level. When I read that book for the first time…as soon as I realised that her narrative was unreliable, I decided she couldn’t be trusted. She had to be lying about everything. It was…” He tilted his head, thoughtful look in his eyes. “A surreal experience. By the end of the book I was certain it was all a lie. Then I read it again and saw all these little details that didn’t add up. One moment she was wearing a white jacket, the next a grey jacket? A fault of the author’s, or a liar’s slip up?”
, but I’m not sure I have a thousand deaths lined up for it, really.”
“So we can put books in it,” Harry said. “It’ll go over there.” He pointed with the screwdriver at the little wall divide jutting out between the fireplace and the front door. It was just wide enough that he could fit the bookcase there. Harry thought the wall was made for it; the fireplace was awkwardly situated, not quite centred and much closer to the windows on the opposite wall, so the bookcase should balance it out nicely.
The only people who knew that Harry wasn’t straight were Dean and Seamus and probably Ginny.
“Rhosyn, though we dated once—”
“Yeah, I know,” he said. “
“Uhm. Okay. Yes. If it’s not too much trouble?”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked. He’d found a small scar near Daco’s thumb and was tracing it with his fingers.
It appeared it was still a new beginning, but not the one Harry had wished for.
Charlie stepped up to the broom, held his hand out and looked at Harry, uncertainty in his eyes. Harry gave him a nod. Charlie drew in a deep breath and then: “Up!”
Embarrassingly, Draco turned out to be such a fast reader that Harry realised that when they’d read that dystopian novel together, Draco must’ve been pacing himself so Harry could keep up with him. He could read an entire book in the course of a few hours, so while Harry would finish an assignment for Record-keeping Theory and Practice in an evening, Draco would read an entire novel.
“Sorry,” Harry said, already retreating. It’d been a stupid question. Stupid to think he could talk to Malfoy, of all people. “Forget I asked.” He fled the reading hall.
Okay. Harry could live with that. He hadn’t worn hats since he’d had to wear them for his Hogwarts uniform, but he could make an exception.
“Yasmin is also single,” Padma added. “Do you know Zoë? I think she’s also single, though we used to date.”
“What about you?” Harry asked.
“He’s stupid,” she said. “And
“Yeah,” Harry said and changed the subject, picking up an old conversation about product testing for the joke shop instead.
. He didn’t need a week to think about what he wanted out of this relationship, he already bloody knew what he wanted.
Harry picked up the Quaffle. This afternoon he was playing pretend Keeper, which really only meant levitating the Quaffle back into the air for somebody to try to grab it, because so far all they were good at was dropping it.
—I just—” Draco stopped babbling. “I’ll be more clear next time. Can I kiss you?”
“I do read books,” Malfoy said, as he was folding the new form in two. He did it very carefully, and very neatly, so that the crease lined up perfectly with the column divide in the middle of the form. He didn’t look at Harry as he said it, he was looking at the form, placing it with great care inside the black notebook.
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged. He repeated the performance with the tray, setting it to levitate beside the tub. He poured the tea. “I left my wand in my cloak, by the door. So this was easier.”
, so he shouldn’t be feeling so disappointed.
“I know it doesn’t. Look, I’m sorry. I’m just trying to explain.” She leaned over the table. “I’m trying to tell you that my upbringing wasn’t all that great either.”
plans. I don’t know what I’m doing, despite what I just told the press. You do.”
“Thank you,” he said to George with a grateful smile. His fingers were dusty. “Did you want to stay for dinner? We’re ordering in.”
Malfoy didn’t even pause in his work to get a bite of food or a drink from the small café that was attached to the Archive’s western wing. Harry headed down there himself around three to fetch a sticky bun and a cuppa.
“Marvellous.” Malfoy turned to face Harry. He’d extracted his notebook from some pocket or other and was pulling out the latest request slip. “For now, I’d just like this, please.”
Harry had the feeling that Malfoy was being shy. Under normal circumstances that would be an intriguing idea, something to be investigated and be curious about, but as it were, Harry didn’t have any space in his head for it. He just wanted to go home. “Oh,” he said.
there were romance novels about queer people?
“Yeah—hey, Gin!” Harry turned, calling out. She was just far enough away she was outside hearing range. “You good with the equipment?”
They walked the short distance to the tube in silence, and got to the platform just as the train pulled in. The only other people in their carriage were an elderly lady with a small dog, and a man in a suit.
“No, no, I just…” Draco gazed into his mint peas, frowning. “I just didn’t believe it. You have this group of teenagers fight this war, and they win, but before they win two of them are dead, two have become injured to such a degree they’ll be permanently disabled, all of them are carrying a lot of trauma—physical injuries aside, they’re essentially child soldiers in a war they never asked for, they have PTSD, they have survivor’s guilt, they have—a lot of issues. And I’m supposed to believe they just got married and had kids and everything was happily ever after? Just like
