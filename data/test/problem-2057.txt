He lifted the blanket and crawled inside it, facing Draco's back. Draco's sobbing had reduced a bit and so had his trembling and he noticed it.
"Why are you lying, Vernon?" Petunia asked her husband quietly. She knew that she sounded hurt and upset and on the verge of tears. Vernon knew that she had wanted to be a witch when she was a kid, "Why are you doing this to me? You know that I am not a witch. I am not Lily. Lily was a witch. How can you forget that? Harry is a wizard. I can't turn doors into walls. Harry is not dead. He's probably hiding somewhere. I locked him just yesterday night."
"Who are you?" Draco asked, in a low quiet tone although he knew that standing in front of him was the male version of Harriet Potter.
"Maybe, Draco will accept you. He has changed a lot," Severus says, knowing that his words are completely useless. He knows as well as Potter does that Draco is still as prejudiced as he was ten years ago.
His voice is melancholic and defeated yet her face lits up and she wraps her arms around him before resting her face on his shoulder. He places his hands on the small of her back, feeling a little bit awkward.
"I was angry and hadn't meant it. I-" she said and stopped speaking when she felt fingers enclosed around her wrist. She looked up to find Vernon staring at her.
Silence followed Draco's statement. Harry sat in front of him with his legs crossed and his hands on his knees. Draco looked at him steadily.
Draco's eyes suggested that he would not answer any of Harry's questions yet but won't run away from Harry. He was clutching Harry's shirt too hard.
"I don't. Keep away from us." Severus warns him. Meanwhile Harriet attaches herself to Severus's legs, her small body shaking. Severus wonders whether she is crying or whether she is just terrified. Black is knelt beside the child. But the girl refuses to go in Black's arms. Severus doesn't understand why Harriet is not afraid of him. By the look Draco is giving to him, he clearly is. All these years and he still doesn't understand Severus. The one who is at fault is of course Lucius.
"Why does this always happen Remus. Why is he never there when his godson is going through a difficult phase?" He snarled and heard Mrs. Malfoy whisper "All of us are upset Mr. Potter. Please calm-"
"It's okay. You can ask for my help if you want, though. You can use magic. It will help you." Draco answered, trying to look normal. Harry looked at him cautiously and nodded "Thank you. Do you want to talk about, you know? I would like to know."
Harry looked at him and shoved his chest "DON'T BLAME HER. I AM YOUR DAMN HUSBAND. NO POWER ON THIS WHOLE EARTH CAN STOP ME FROM ENTERING YOUR PREMISES."
Draco took a deep breath to cool down "Bring the divorce papers I had asked you to lock,  immediately."
"Good luck doing that," Pansy snorted, not looking up from her book. Granger's fist loosened at that. Draco blinked his eyes rapidly, still not understanding and he hated not understanding but he couldn't interfere in her life. She was married and had a husband and three children. He would not go and make everything awkward because he had misunderstood the situation.
"I don't want to talk about this." Now this is slightly complicated. They need to know about Riddle. Seeing that only she knows the entire truth and Riddle could be getting ready to wreak havoc, it is certainly important to know.
"Are you sure about this Harriet?" Headmaster Dumbledore asks, his eyes twinkling behind his glasses. He is wearing a soft smile on his face, one that indicates that he has accepted Harriet's decision. Harriet regards him, wariness shadowing her eyes.
"So Albus, you wanted to know what happened after Potter caught Draco with Flint and Finnigan. Now that I have sated your curiosity, will you answer
Harry pulls his hands back and backs off and isn't surprised when Scorpius embraces him. He closes his eyes and hugs Scorpius back with a sigh.
They glowered at each other, his hands holding Draco's fist. A yank and Draco fell on his chest. Draco looked at him with narrowed eyes and bit his cheek. Harry retaliated by kissing Draco. The kiss was bruising and harsh. He bit Draco's lower lip and glared at the blonde all the while.
Draco looked around to check if father and mother were here and they were there, sitting beside the window, sharing a pudding. Smiling to himself, he headed towards Granger's table with Pansy and Blaise. Granger looked up from her lunch. There were deep dark circles underneath her eyes. He waited for the request to sit at some other table. She was obviously busy, judging from the papers spread on the table.
It was Ron who spoke "He is alive. You saved him Harry. You came on time. Had you been a minute late, he would have died." Harry sobbed in relief and closed his wet eyes. Ron hugged and him and so did Hermione.
She took a deep breath when she finally reached the huge door of the great hall. The guards bowed and she nodded before pushing the door open.
"I was not sure earlier." Harry replied and continued with a sigh, his eyes trained on his best friend's white face, "She has not met us yet. She knows that I know. She expects you to be angry with me and abandon me."
"Harriet," Uncle Severus started, "You can enter the castle as a member of the harem only and that too only after you catch the eye of the lord and I am not sure if Lucius still entertains himself or it's only Draco who uses the harem. Do you know what that means?"
Black's fingers that were intertwined, clenched and so did his jaw. Something akin to anger flashed in his eyes but he stayed quiet. He swallowed a couple of times, his eyes boring into Draco's as he attempted to calm himself down.
A few seconds pass and then Potter turns his piercing eyes away with a calmly uttered, "Come on Hermione. Let's go."
"On a serious note, I want you to promise me that you won't do anything to end you in Azkaban." Draco spoke and Harry looked into his eyes. Draco almost gasped when he see black fury in the depth of Harry's eyes. He realized that Harry wanted to kill them and this was the exact thing he was worried about.
A few moments pass and he is still kissing her. She places her hands on his shoulder probably because she needs to breathe but he can't bring himself to stop. His need has taken over him. He doesn't want to stop. He wants her so much that it's difficult to breathe.
"All right. I will sleep with you." He mumbled and Harry closed his eyes in relief. It was not much but it was a starting. Britain would not destroy the little peace of mind Draco had gained over the past few days he had spent with him in France.
"Tessa. May I have the pleasure to take you to Honey dukes. It has the most delicious candies I have ever eaten." Draco spoke and Harry said "I will be here and talk to Dudley for a bit. You can take her to Hogsmeade and show her the shops over there. She will like them."
Mom sighs, "It's okay, Scorpius. Go and sit down in the dining room. Mimsi will serve some lunch and I'll come and heal you in a few minutes."
In a matter of three seconds, Harry had stood up and pointed his wand on Ronald and Hermione. In another second they were tied up.
He moved on to another scar. It was a carving. Most of it had disappeared. Something had been carved with a knife.
"I will just cast a cleaning charm, Draco. You can take rest." Harry whispered and Draco shook his head mutely. This was his home as well and he would clean it with Harry. He had this right.
None of them had noticed that Draco's parents had arrived and were standing at the door. Only when Harry turned around did they notice them standing there.
Harry stares at Draco Malfoy-Nott. It's raining and she is soaked and Harry can't look away. She has a purse in her right hand and her left is in front of her eyes as she runs towards him. She has not seen him yet.
Severus has been trying to find Draco for the past twenty minutes now. She is nowhere. He has searched the entire manor. Thinking that maybe she is in Lucius's room, he walks towards it.
Draco was not standing in front of him anymore, probably because he couldn't face Harry. He was standing at the window, looking out and Harry walked over to him.
The woman sat down, sighing deeply. Arthur took her hand in his before muttering quietly, "Don't worry. Everything will be fine."
He held no anger for Draco at all, his sweet Draco who was waiting for his reaction, Draco who trusted him so much who loved him so much because it required courage and trust to do this.
"What do you need Granger? I am busy." He snapped and the woman snapped back at him "I would leave if you like Malfoy but I thought that you would want to know that Harry fell down the stairs at Gremmauld and has received several injuries during the process. He is in the hospital with me."
"Where do you think he is?" Petunia asks and Vernon glares at her. She has asked this very question so many times that he has lost count. He is already worried for the brat. This is not his school and our community don't function like theirs. Anything could happen to him. Anything. The boy wasn't even allowed to use magic to defend himself.
She doesn't know that he would literally do anything she wants. He could spend his life kissing her. He nuzzles her soft cheeks and inhales again.
Fortunately, two elves bring their dinner and the third one brings utensils for them. She is hungry and it distracts her effectively, if only for a few minutes because the elves have brought hot chocolate for her and it reminds her of hot water that he threatened her with.
"Just shut up." Albus snaps and as usual Scorpius only chuckles before locking the car and following him inside.
Draco stops speaking suddenly and Harry stares at her, his hand stilling on her hair. Her hair is nice soft and wavy and long.
didn't say that it was a time turner. Uncle Ron did." James continues, "Of course, while aunt Hermione was away. He also asked me to accompany you, no matter what."
"So- some eggs. Baby corn, broccoli, bread. That- that's it." Draco said, a bead of sweat on forehead and Harry noticed that Draco did not ask for coffee. It had finished and Draco had coffee once daily. But he said nothing and just nodded. He would give Draco time to do whatever he wished. What could it be? Perhaps Draco wanted to be alone to mourn or breakdown.
"From what I know, your friends and you used to despise Lucius Malfoy at Hogwarts because he was a death eater. Would you like to tell our readers why Mr. Malfoy decided to forsake you-know-who's cause?"
"You knew?" He asked and Remus sighed heavily, his eyes guilty. "Yes, I did. Your scent was all over him."
But then Harry's hands were back on Draco's half unbuttoned shirt and his eyes were looking into Draco's again and Draco was starting to sweat again.
"I am giving this vial to you. Drink it once you reach the Dursley's home. I'll inform your relatives about your decision. I'll talk to them-"
Five minutes were spent in comfortable silence, after which Draco spoke up "Harry" He stopped and cleared his throat before taking a sip of his tea.
Initially, it was hard to accept it, particularly when Lily left her to go to that school. With time, Petunia learned to accept it but it was too late to apologize. So Petunia stayed away and then she married Vernon who convinced her to talk to her little sister. He promised that Lily would forgive her and then- and then you-know-who killed her and Petunia lost the chance.
"They raped me." Draco whispered, his voice low but his words clear and he stared into Harry's eyes while he said this. Draco had never accepted the fact that he had been sexually assaulted. According to him, he had always been paid and so his clients had a right to do what they did.
"You do not need to know. I am not going to tell you." Draco glared at him and Harry sighed before closing his eyes. He was worried about Draco. Draco was looking wild now, wild and terrified.
That catches Harry's attention. His eyebrows rise in surprise before he asks, "Why would you do that?"
"The effect that your stupid actions would have on me did not cross your mind even once Harry. I had asked you to stop drinking, hadn't I?" Draco asked furiously.
and you have no reason to be embarrassed." Harry spoke softly and confidently. He had never known the things that Draco had revealed today.
In the matter of seconds Harry finds himself picked up in huge arms and taken inside the car. The speed at which Uncle Vernon drives off is practically startling. Harry is in so much pain that he can't understand even his words.
However, Ron cuts continues, "No. I've to say this. Had you not betrayed him, none of this would even be happening."
"Bloody Hell, Ron. Can I rest in peace for a few hours at least." Harry snaps at the red-head and he glares at Harry, "All right. Suit yourself. I am sure that you don't want to know about the fact that Lucius Malfoy is standing in your sitting room with his wife and Snape."
This was the very first time Harry had lost his patience with Draco. It was not because Draco rejected his advances. More than a decade had passed since Harry took Draco away from that hell and even though they had been separated for a long while, at-least Draco should be comfortable with Harry's kisses, at-least he should be comfortable enough not to hit Harry like this.
"Yes, our dear sister is waiting." Fred murmurs and as usual, his twin continues, "Yes. yes. The show must go on. Let's go."
Cooking reminded him of Draco and he just couldn't stand to be alone in the place. So that idea went down the drain as well. Then he decided to go for a jog. Half an hour later, he realized that he had no stamina at all.
"Okay, my lady." One of the guards whispered and after another low bow, they marched off towards her brothers's rooms. She hurried towards the hall. The castle was huge and the great hall was on the ground floor. There were anti-apparition wards inside so of course, she had to walk. With quick steps, she descended the stairs. Lamps were lit all over and there was no-one around except the guards and a few maids.
Harry stared as Lucius left him and closed the door behind him. His slip of tongue had not gone unnoticed by Harry. Why would Lucius call his father by his first name and speak about him as if he was aware what his dad would want? Harry had never known that Lucius was a writer.
"Harry please. You deserve better. " Draco spoke and Harry stood up to look inside Draco's eyes. It was clearly written in them that he needed Harry to do this.
Harry looked at Draco quietly. In the past week, their relationship had grown and he had started understanding Draco a bit. He had shared some things of his own past with Draco, though his secret stayed hidden.
Draco smiles and leans forward to take Harry's lips in his. Harry closes his eyes and gets lost in Draco's lips.
"I thought that I would just ignore him and I tried but you would bring them to our house. I did not want to tell you. I thought – thought that you would leave me. Then we broke up and when I came back, you were - are a changed man. You are a changed man and now they are interfering again. YESSSSS." Harry jumped in surprise because it seemed that Draco had just spoken parsle tongue. He did not have any time to ask because Draco spun around and walked towards Ron, looking wild and mad. Before Harry could do anything, he had his hands around Ron's neck and he was shouting at the top of his voice "I will kill him and finish it, once for all. I won't let him destroy my life again. "
"It must be Ginny. I think that she took our hair to polyjuice into us and I think that she intercepted their letters to. It would have been easy considering that she was dating Neville." Ron said resolutely.
Lucius looks at her with melancholic eyes before turning towards Severus, "I am ready to beg Potter. He is the only one who would care to rescue her. Please. I will do anything."
"You won't believe what happened, Draco," Blaise muttered, his chest heaving, "The unspeakables told me that it's actually 2001. I barely escaped their clutches."
He had never accepted the clients willingly, so as to speak. Oh! Yes, his basic human needs had compelled him to take up a client but he had never succumbed willingly. At the end, they had- It was impossible to think about it. In France, it had been easy to forget it but here in Britain, memories came back and he did not want to set a foot out of his house.
Draco's hands squeezed his arse roughly and he bit Harry's neck again and Harry moaned, "Take me Draco. Need you so much."
"I wanted to ask you whether you know that we're in some other dimension. It's 2001 and my father is the head auror."
"I detest Lucius. Can you get on with the tale so that I can kick him out of here." Potter snaps at her and she makes a face, "Okay."
"Did – did you lead me to that room that night?" He asked and Ron shook his head "I would rather die than leading anyone to – to that."
Draco stared at him and just stared "I need to go for a meeting with the coven of Werewolfs from Canada. I have been trying brew a potion which might help them keep their human bodies during the full moon, if they so desire. I have to discuss whether they are interested." He spoke in a rush.
He approaches her slowly so that she can back off if she wants. Very gently, he cups her cheeks. He moves closer to her face and takes in her delicious scent.
"I'm afraid I can't," she replied, saying the exact words he had said and opened the door. She closed it and walked down the stairs and after having passed the gargoyles, she wrapped her cloak around her and then she headed towards her bedroom, hoping Bill wouldn't be there. She would try to contact Kingsley. She could do it through the floo. However, she had only taken three steps when she heard soft murmurs and she stopped walking because one of the voices belonged to Ariana. The other belonged to Scorpius Malfoy. He was her secret boyfriend. Harriet knew, though. Of course, she knew. She also knew that Malfoy approved and that he had given them the talk. She was not proud of overhearing the conversations of her daughter and her boyfriend, hidden underneath her cloak but she knew that it was better not to get too attached to Ariana, not when Harriet didn't know what would happen of her in the coming future. She would prefer that her kids stayed with Malfoy if something to happened to her. He was a responsible man. Harriet trusted him to take care of the kids.
Aunt Sierra bowed her head but Harriet saw her cheeks redden before she did. Harriet looked at uncle Severus. He was staring blankly at her.
Harry could also see that Draco was sweating. He might be able to hide his anxiety from everyone but Harry had always seen Draco too clearly.
Harriet had never told the kids about the reality of her marriage. She had told no-one. Ariana had no reason to hate Bill. She was only thirteen and James knew not to disturb his sisters' minds. That is, if he knew the truth which she was doubtful he did.
"I can serve myself." Draco said eating the fruit and Harry smiled "I like serving you. I have missed doing this for the past four year Draco. Do not stop me please."
finish it? We are not even going out. Just because I love you or want you doesn't mean that you have to satisfy me. What- what is going on in your head? I want to understand Draco. What the hell is this?" He hisses sharply.
Albus shifts the photo towards left and unlocks the door with a simple alohomora. He enters inside. The room is untouched and dust has settled on the furniture. It seems that dad hasn't cleaned it for a long time. The memories are arranged date wise on the shelves. There are a very few vials and other than the memories, there are some ancient tomes that dad must have wanted to keep away from Albus and his siblings. He picks up the memory of the day following the night dad caught Draco red-handed.
Sirius grins. Skeeter frowns and Sirius smiles some more. He would never forget that day, that day when his little godson turned Lucius's life upside down the man became a prey to Harry's doe-eyed looks.
because he couldn't afford it. In fact, he was filthy rich and if Albus never wanted to work in his life, he would still never fall short of money. They, just, didn't need a bigger house and also, a bigger place would demand maintenance and time and time was something Harry couldn't waste.
Draco cut him off nervously "I- Harry, I had a nightmare and then wanted to clean myself and then wanted to die but then your face came into my mind and so I hurried to your room."
He had just touched the first button of Draco's shirt when Draco lifted his right hand and punched Harry right on his right cheek before backing off.
"Malfoy!" A loud, surprised and excited voice broke into his thoughts and Draco froze. He was tired, hungry and annoyed. He did not have patience for Ronald Weasley right now. However, he pasted a smile on his face and turned around, expecting a bloated Ronald Weasley in his stupid clothes running towards him. However, when he saw a tall, fit and a quite handsome red head in black jeans and a white shirt, his jaw fell open.
She settles on the edge of the bed and he has to force himself to move away. He can't resist the temptation to touch her. He doesn't want to resist. But he should because she is totally not ready yet.
"Just leave. I don't need anyone's help." Harry snapped at him and he replied "I am bringing our breakfast."
Harry covered the distance between them in the matter of a few seconds and Draco flinched when Harry held his cheeks between his hands abruptly.
"No, Harry, we're not going to visit her." He says sternly. Sirius snickers at him. Severus glares at his husband. Atleast Severus's trying to be stern. If there's anyone Severus has hated more than James Potter, it's Petunia. After Lily's demise, he literally lived in terror that that woman would snatch the child away from him. Sirius's repeated assurances that he's Harry's godfather and that no-one can take Harry's custody from him did nothing to ease his mind.
Hermione chuckled and sat down on her knees and Ron rolled his eyes. Harry smiled on Harry's shoulders and Draco continued his rant, "You don't even own proper robes now and your shirts are old. Honestly, Harry..."
Harry stared and so did Ron. Their expressions were completely similar. They were gaping at Draco, open mouthed and shocked.
Her green eyes flared before she spoke coldly, "What do you mean? He's writing my biography and was just taking our family pictures."
"What is this smell?" She asked finally. He gaped at her and at first, he was just surprised but then anger replaced the surprise and he said in a voice that barely concealed his rage, "I just asked you not to remind me. Will you, kindly, refrain from talking about him?" and then he stalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Petunia's head was starting to ache and the smell was not going. Ten years had passed in one night and Dudley didn't want to talk about that boy. Vernon hadn't shouted for her yet - not once. Everything was strange and unusual. She didn't move for a full ten minutes, testing, wondering when Vernon would finally lose his patience and shout for her or for Harry. She waited for things to become normal and for Dudley to come running inside her room, complaining about that boy, lying about how that boy had been stealing food.
Draco felt smug and looked at Longbottom and Weasley twins who were looking truly shocked. Weasley was looking absolutely murderously at his brothers and Granger had settled down next him. She asked him "Are you really ready for this conversation? We can just have it next time."
Draco staggered and slumped on the bed, staring into his green eyes. They were- Sweet Merlin, Harry's eyes screamed murder. They were so angry that Draco could just stare. The man was practically shaking with anger.
He knew that Draco would not agree. He did not want to quarrel with the man so he just nodded and spoke softly, crawling out of the bed "Okay. I had thought that it would be good for the duelling academy I wanted to start. I had wanted to announce it at this event. But it's fine if you are not comfortable. We don't have to go."
" I thought that you meant it." Harry said and then laughed bitterly, "I should have known that you didn't. You would never initiate anything unless it's absolutely necessary. I wonder Draco if I disgust you since you don't even touch me anymore. We are more like room mates Draco."
"Okay." Scorpius says and looks at the wall, reminiscing the conversation he had with his father long back when he was only eight...
Harry was talking to his mother. Father was hearing the discussion silently. Draco made his way towards them quietly and decided to talk to them. His courage left him as soon as he reached them though.
"-she never got anything." The girl continued. She became quiet and her adam's apple bobbed for a few seconds before she continued, "I hate him."
" Leave. It's too late." Draco simply murmurs before laying down on the bed and staring out of the window once again. The day is really nice.
Harry took a deep breath before speaking "You can take as much time you need Draco. I do wish certain things though."
This commanding voice belongs to Draco. Harry's heart thunders inside his chest. He places his ears close to the door to hear properly.
After a pause Harry continued "I swear Draco. If something happens to you, I will follow you. I won't live alone."
"Please enlighten us then as to how can a person be two different people." The girl hisses right back. Draco swallows. She had expected to be offended by Granger's sharp tone. Instead, she is happy that she is not being treated like a bloody damaged person.
A sound catches her attention and she turns her head. The door is opening and she wants to hide somewhere. She wants to end her life. She wants to flee away.
His green eyes gleam with fury and Draco takes his hands in his. Ginny glares at their entwined fingers.
"I'll survive," she simple says, shrugging and it's the truth, "I'll not come back until Ariana has a mate."
"As if you would listen to me." Draco looked pointedly at him and Harry tapped his nose with his own "Of course, I would."
"YOU BASTARDS. HOW DARE YOU?" He shouted at them. It was obvious that Longbottom and twins were shocked into silence. "YOU BLOODY BACKSTABBED ME. YOU- YOU- I WILL-"
Love was strange, Harry decided. Draco's sorrows saddened him and his happiness made him happy. All he wanted was Draco to heal and he had thought that Draco was healing as the days passed.
Harry cleared his throat and he realized that Harry was looking at him, his proud cock facing Draco and Draco wanted Harry to- to. It was difficult to express what he wanted from Harry because it was not just sex.
Harry stopped after that and Draco waited for him to continue. But when Harry didn't, he turned around to face the man. His eyebrows rose when he found Harry curled into a small ball. Perhaps it was difficult for Harry. His best friends had wanted to tell Draco about it but Draco had refused, wanting to hear the story from Harry itself.
He was here to reject dad's proposition. He didn't want to get into this industry even if it's intriguing but Harry knows that something is wrong and he makes a split second decision and mutters, "I'll take the lead role dad."
"I am meeting them tomorrow. Discussion over." Draco said curtly, though his insides felt warm when Harry snapped at him "I am telling you. If they hurt you in any way. If they even look at you wrong, I would do worst then burning them."
"Come inside and have a seat" Dudley replied again and Harry couldn't help but blurting "You are Dudley, aren't you?"
He had been prepared for this but nothing could prepare him for this- this need to make love to Draco and he had not realized that he had closed his eyes.
"Calm down." he murmured and walked towards Draco. He was trembling with fury. It had been years since he had felt such fury coarse throughout his body. "CALM DOWN. BLOODY CALM DOWN." He screamed at the blonde and pulled his hair frantically. "JESUS CHRIST." He shouted and slammed his hands on the slap.
question?" Mr. Zabini murmurs. For a few moments, Albus licks his lips nervously and stares at the other man in total silence. Mr. Zabini could ask anything and there are things Albus can't tell anyone yet.
"Lucius'll never agree. He could even hurt Harry." Severus some out of nowhere. Sirius turns around and glares at the man who's avoiding Harry's adorable eyes. It's quite obvious that Severus was only waiting for Sirius to deny his godson so that he himself won't have to do it.
"Severus is here too. Can he come in?" Mother asks her softly. Draco nods and crosses her legs before looking at her folded hands on her lap. Some time during the night, Potter had transfigured her shirt into a pajama and night shirt.
Harry walked towards him and Draco's feet froze. He did not want to run off. No, he wanted Harry to – to -. He just wanted relief. It was all too much. He wanted a reassurance that Harry was his and that he loved Draco even though Draco did not deserve him at all.
Currently, they were sitting in the dining room, having lunch silently. Harry broke the silence between them "I was thinking that perhaps we could go and look at the properties around for the academy and you can perhaps set up the shop near it. It would become easy for you."
have been captured. They -" and stopped. The door closed again and Draco slowly turned around and found himself staring into his own eyes - stunned silver eyes.
Creevy wasn't done after one picture. Potter was obviously not comfortable. But, no one said anything.
Sunlight streams inside her room and she opens her eyes, yawning loudly. She had a restless sleep last night. More than once, she felt Potter enter her room and check upon her. She leans against her headboard and presses her knees on her chest before staring out of the window.
Fifteen minutes later, spent and content, Draco lay spooned by Harry, wondering how he would tell everything to Harry. It would devastate his husband. He was also wondering why he wanted Harry to hug him tighter and why he felt unsatisfied though he had just come inside his pyjamas.
He summons her things quickly and apparates right inside Gremmauld place. After being proven innocent, Black transformed it into a a proper manor that rivals Lucius's magnificent mansion. It is not protected by fidilious and has a lot of windows and no dark artefacts, The portrait of Walburga is rotting in the storeroom.
She glares at Ron and then at Harry and then she purses her lips in a way that tells him that the discussion isn't over. He doesn't understand what she wants to achieve by forcing him to talk to Draco. There is nothing to talk about. Draco is made of lies and Harry doesn't want to have anything to do with him.
"Hermione." Ron spoke worriedly and she blinked. Her cheeks felt wet and she realized that she was crying. "Are you all right?"
"Bloody buggering hell. I should never have let him leave that day." Harry hissed to himself and wanted to break something. But he couldn't because that would alarm Draco and the man would think that Harry was angry at him.
"He hates her Albus. He hates her and your siblings hate me and even the Weasleys hate us." The girl murmurs. Harry makes a face. He had thought that Ron and Hermione were above hating a child after everything they went through. He will have a word with them.
"But then it means that you spent three summers in the same house then." He murmurs, his eyes blown wide in shock. This hadn't occurred to him.
Draco returned with some snacks and stopped in his tracks when he saw Harry looking at a child playing with his father. Harry had a longing on his face and this meant that Harry wanted children as much as he did.
"Harry," she whispered, surprised that her voice was soft. She had locked him inside just yesterday night. She had wanted to torture him - not kill him and as this thought crossed her mind, she realized that she was disgusted with herself. She was torturing just because he was Lily's son and had magic unlike her.
The fact that Lucius had never replaced dad's ring with Narcissa's didn't escape anyone's notice and  a new found respect grew in Harry's heart for the elder Malfoy.
"Enter," he muttered a few seconds later and Albus came in, his green eyes wide with something akin to a mixture of horror and pain. The boy had inherited his hair and eyes and the habit of wearing his heart on his sleeves. He had also inherited Harry's tendency to feel others' pain.
But Draco did not speak. He simply looked on the floor. Harry couldn't empathise with him because he had never been in Draco's shoes. He had lived his life in constant terror, yes but Vernon was just one man and he had protected himself.
"I hate wheelchairs." Harry said and Draco had already known this fact so he sighed before muttering "We do not have any alternative yet."
"The ministry would hurt them Harry. They have to remain in hiding because of that." He argued and Harry's voice rose a bit "I don't want you hurt. You don't understand. I know. I know that it would overwhelm you and perhaps weaken you and I know that you would hate that."
The boy's lips twitched and a smile spread on his face before he said in an amused voice, "Maybe, just a little. But, only where you're concerned. You never did pay enough attention to him," and then he did something strange. He touched Harry's scar gently. It was just a brush of his small fingers before he dropped them back on his stomach and closed his eyes, leaving Harry stunned. How did this boy know so much about his complicated past with Malfoy. Surely, Malfoy hadn't told him. Why had he touched Harry's scar? No-one except Albus did that.
"I am here." A voice reaches her ears and a very cautious looking Harry walks in. An elf trails behind him, a tray of tea and some snacks in his hands.
Fred and George looked sharply at Draco but didn't say anything before leaving too. Percy smiled politely at Draco and although Draco was disgusted, he didn't say anything. He smiled back and was so angry that he wanted to break something. Charlie and Creevy left after them and were followed by Ronald who was looking straight ahead, taking care not to look at Draco at all.
"I am so sorry. We never talked about your past. I should have known. I should have understood. I am sorry that I was late. But I will help you. Please, give me a chance." Harry's voice broke and Draco whispered "You deserve better Harry. You do not deserve the emotional baggage that comes with me. I will never heal. Please move on. You have your entire life in front of you."
"So you see, that's what this potion does. It will decrease your thirst, if not quench it. It will make it bearable for you and will not compel you to drink from the nearest human being.
His eyes flicker from her to dad and then back. Dad's face is blank and he is too still and Malfoy is too terrified. He knows that Lucius kicked her out of his house but that doesn't explain why she is here or why she is so terrified.
Surprised , Lucius nodded. The girl continued " I am completely fine only because of him. I couldn't do magic and I couldn't walk or dance or jump or do anything and the healers said that they did know how to heal me. Dad flooed Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Malfoy told him that he is angry with Britain that Britain hurt him and he can't return back and he will check me up if dad brings me to France. He created a potion and now I am completely fine and normal. "
"Draco." He heard Narcissa whisper from a distance. Draco's body had not healed completely yet. No one could touch him. Not because they were not allowed. Hermione had given the numbing ointment to Harry and Harry had applied it. No they were too scared or perhaps disgusted to touch Draco. Narcissa and Lucius were scared perhaps and he did not know about Remus. He wondered why Remus had turned white when he had seen Draco's body. Harry had noticed something akin to fear in Remus's eyes before they turned blank again. He heard something fall on the floor and opened his eyes.
The ministry will have no reason to issue a 'murder on sight order' and you will be able to live in peace. I want a volunteer to demonstrate the effects of this potion.
"What are you hiding, headmaster?" Harriet asked quietly, getting straight to the point, "I need to get out of this castle."
He held Harry's hand to stop the blood but the blood did not stop. Instead it gathered around his hand. He was still in shock. It had happened in the matter of seconds. He had not been given any warning. He had not known the extent of Harry's madness. He had not known the extent of Harry's love.
Harry resolved to leave alcohol altogether. He resolved to show Draco that he was not dependent on him. How could the man be so bloody adamant?
She forced her legs to move and headed towards the small rectangular table and sat adjacent to Vernon so that she could look at bot Vernon and Dudley.
Harry can't help but wonder if he would have had Malfoy as his partner too is the war hadn't thrown them on opposite sides. However, it's futile to even ponder over it. Malfoy is married and from what Ron said, she doesn't socialize. He will just help Scorpia and continue staying away from the wizarding world. It was that simple and there was no need to complicate it.
Harry slammed his hand on the table and snarled "That's it. This is where everything gets stuck. You don't bloody trust me."
She goes through the motions, does what is required to live. She suffers from nightmares and starts casting silencing charms once Harry comes to help her.
Lucius stayed quiet, looking into his eyes and Harry turned to look at Narcissa. She averted her eyes in shame.
"Hmmm." Draco murmured and Harry's eyes shot open in shock when his hands clutched Harry's hair and his lips crushed Harry's. Sirius was still in the room and Draco was behaving as if the man had left.
It took a few moments for Weasley to stand up and look at him. Aurors passed them, paying no attention to Draco or Weasley.
He pulls back and shivers as desire slowly takes him over. He wants her. He needs her. She could have stayed away. Now that he has tasted the forbidden fruit, he wants more.
A bead of sweat trickled down his cheek and he called loudly " Kreacher. KREACHER. ", jumping two stairs at a time.
"CAN'T EVEN BLOODY HATE YOU." After that Draco threw punch after punch on his chest and the force behind them went on decreasing gradually.
Just when he is at the main exit, he murmurs back, "No. I was drunk and so were you. It meant nothing. I want to become a death eater, just like my father. I believe in the dark lord's cause and I want to make my father proud. It's an honor Potter and you will eat your words when my lord will defeat you. You are my lord's enemy and I am warning you to stay away. Do not piss me off." because the kiss can't mean anything, can it? He will be marked in about two and a half weeks and Potter is destined to defeat his lord. There is simply no point of thinking over the impossible.
Someone sat with him and touched his shoulder and someone reached for Draco but he knew nothing except the fact that Draco had died and Harry had never been so ashamed of himself.
Draco nodded and Harry averted his eyes, closing them. As Draco hummed, a peace fell upon Harry's mind. He felt Draco covering his body with a blanket and opening his mouth to force a potion. The pain in his leg reduced and he burrowed inside the blanket.
"Don't worry." He mouths at her, wondering what else Black was right about. The woman nods and retreats towards Harriet's room and Severus apparates back to Howgarts to get some of his clothes. He will have to stay here for a few days.
Severus leans back against the chair, looking quietly at her. He eyes are pained, worried. She still looks at him like she's carrying a burden on her shoulders. He wonders if that will ever change or if she is destined to always fight. He would blame fate for making Draco her mate if he didn't know that fate was not to be blamed in this case.
"Now, I want one in which you're with Percy and Penelope," Creevy muttered. Draco sighed in relief. He was sure Percy would be decent. But Potter's eyes were still upset and her back stayed stiff with tension.
Harry knew that he will have to encroach the subject again and wondered how to do it as he walked towards the kitchen when Draco mumbled "I know you want to talk. I am fine now. You can say whatever you wish."
He was surprised when Draco narrowed his eyes and pulled back, only to shift and bite the pulse point on Harry's neck hard. Harry moaned lowly and clutched Draco's hair hard. Draco did not pull back, choosing to suck the mark he had put on his neck.
Draco stared at Black. When he was informed that the head auror wanted him to help with this case, he hadn't known that the said had auror was Sirius Black. With his usual smirk and dancing eyes, he still looked handsome and he could see why his godfather fell for this man. That he would go from an escapee from Azkaban to the head auror was a considerable feat in itself. But that's not what had stunned him speechless.
"What are you saying Draco? " He asked, his voice a whisper and Draco glared at Ron " He did. He bought me for several nights and fucked me ruthlessly. In fact he was the one who gave those cigarette burns to me, not that you will believe me. "
"Of course, you must be tired. I will have Blinky take your bags in the guest room." Draco spoke with a phony smile on his face. Harry could see fire in Draco's eyes. It was so unlike the fear that had been there for the past few years that Harry was surprised and felt a glee run through him. Draco's eyes that were fixed on Sirius told him that he will destroy Sirius and his smile suggested that he was already planning.
He cleared his throat and beckoned her closer to show her the exact measurements "See, you have to pour 20 ml of this red potion and 25 ml of this yellow one.
Draco follows the plan and lets Sirius take him to 'The Three Broomsticks'. He opens his eyes and pastes fear on his face, murmuring, "Wha- where have you brought me?"
The wizarding world was horrible to slytherins after the final battle. Harry had only just graduated and he attended the trials and forced the wizengamot to pardon everyone who was less then twenty. They did. He stayed until Lily was born and then he left. Ginny wasn't happy with him and he wasn't happy to see the world return to their old hypocritical ways.
"I will stay in touch father. Where are you staying?" Draco blurted in a hurried voice and his cheeks warmed.
"I remember her handwriting Hermione. She wrote to me as well. I did not tell about that letter to Draco. I had recognised her writing."
"Let's go inside before something else ridiculous happens," Pansy muttered, her face still very pale and her arms crossed as if she was cold. Draco could imagine how worried she must be. She was a successful interior designer and had worked really hard to reach here.
"BITCH. Always monopolising you. Always snatching you away from me." Draco whispered in a low and dangerous voice. In the matter of seconds, Draco had come in front him with crossed arms. He was glaring at Hermione and Harry found that he was speechless. When had Hermione snatched him away from Draco? What was he saying?
Sirius grins and ruffles Harry's hair and Snape nods before muttering, "Summon your invisibility cloak Potter. Let's move."
But it would take time and he couldn't bear to see Draco in so much pain. Time was something he didn't have.
Petunia's eyes fell upon the door that was open now and the smell that was wafting inside - it was coming from there. She followed Vernon. Her legs didn't want to move. Something was rotting in there - in her old house. She was too terrified to think anything and only hoped that Vernon and Dudley were lying.
"Stop blaming yourself for everything. You didn't assault me." Draco spoke frantically and Harry shook his head, looking at Draco sadly.
Malfoy's gardens and peacocks were lovely but he did not stop to admire them. He had no time for it. He walked ahead and opened the gate. A house elf greeted him with a bow.
A second later, he felt Harry beside him, pouring cold water on him. Harry poured buckets and buckets of cold water on him and Draco screamed and shouted and begged him to end Draco but the water did not stop. What felt like hours later, two vials were pressed on his lips and he felt Harry carrying him in his arms. Draco wanted to tell Harry. He wanted to apologise but he couldn't. Before he knew what was even happening, he fell asleep.
A second had passed before when he was shoved off. Draco yelped and sat back on his knees, stunned beyond belief, staring at Harry who was wiping his lips. His green eyes were angry and were full of desire. He just stared at Harry for a few moments before speaking, "What's wrong with you?"
"You don't." Harry replied and his voice broke at the end, though his eyes were completely dry when he looked at Draco. "And I do not know what to do to gain your trust, Draco. I have been trying."
Draco doesn't know what makes her do it but she lays down on Potter's lap. He still doesn't touch her. She wonders if he will hate her once he realizes exactly what she has done.
"There go your BLOODY DIVORCE PAPERS. I LOVE YOU AND I WON'T SIGN ANY DIVORCE PAPERS. TO THE HELL WITH EVERYTHING. I WILL NEVER, NEVER SIGN ANY DIVORCE PAPERS. YOU WILL GET RID OF ME ONLY AFTER MY DEATH AND IT IS APPROACHING QUICKLY, SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY." Harry was panting by the end of it and he did not have any strength to shout any more so he spoke coolly "With the quantity of alcohol I consume, it will not be long before you receive a call from Hermione about my sudden death-"
"What did you dream?" He asked and Draco just shook his head crawling on his lap again. Harry stroked his hair and kissed his cheek "You can tell me." But Draco did not say anything, just looking at nothing, with unblinking and sad eyes.
"Harry, do you want to change in your night suit. It must be uncomfortable. But none of your clothes are clean. Wear my night suit for tonight. Okay?" He asked and Harry refused saying "I don't like hand me downs. I will sleep in my boxers."
He cuts her off, "Sorry but I am not interested in knowing." He could provide a shoulder to her to cry but he knows that is not what she wants. This madness has been building inside her for the past few days now. He shivers when he witnesses darkness in her eyes. In the blur of the motion, she reaches for his hand.
He looks silently at her. There is something in his gaze that she doesn't like. She can't exactly explain it but he is making her uncomfortable.
"Harry, did something happen?" Draco asked softly, trying to soften him. It did not work and harry stalked towards him, his eyes burning with fury and his steps hurried.
Harry did not reply. He just stared at Draco. "Hey. I am fine." Draco murmured and a lone tear fell down Harry's expressionless face "You almost died."
Harry simply shrugged and looked into his eyes "You know that I don't like taking help from others."
"Malfoy is currently resting in one of my guest rooms and I would like to know why. He's injured." Harry finishes and is satisfied to see the change in Snape's face. His eyes widen and his jaw drops in shock.
" It is better it remains hidden. He does not want you hurt. I fear that it is just a matter of time before you realize the truth. "
"Because you can't help her and you can't rush her into things. She is scared and wary and I do not want to loose her. I love her." Albus says desperately, "This has to go well. I trust you dad. Even if you are a recluse, you have always been powerful and influential and - and just - please try to look beyond what you see on surface. She is really a very nice person."
He opened the door and their was Draco, standing near the kitchen table, attempting to slit his wrist with the biggest knife of their kitchen. His heart raced and his wand clattered on the floor. His eyes shot wide open.
He dragged his legs towards the bed and sat upon it. Hermione had numbed Draco's back so that it did not hurt him. Harry started applying the ointment on Draco's thighs first and then moved on his calf. Then he proceeded to his stomach, chest, neck and back.
Harry gasps and stops in his tracks. They are at a bit of distance. He can finally afford to take a few seconds to breath. His body trembles as he bends and places his hands on his knees before taking huge erratic breaths.
"Leave me. Please leave me." The voice belongs to Pansy who was trying to flee. Aurors bind her in thick ropes. She stares at Draco, her eyes pained.
This wasn't her room. Had they relocated? Why had they relocated? Why had that boy not made breakfast yet?
Draco was still sobbing and Harry sobbed with him. Hermione pressed the vials on Draco's lips and then Harry picked up Draco's naked and burnt body and placed him on the bed. He covered Draco with a blanket and Hermione said "Don't. Don't cover him. I will give you an ointment. You need to apply it on him and he needs to rest. He does not have to be covered. Lock the door and let his body be exposed to cool air."
It's good that Harriet apologized to Professor Snape for everything her dad, godmother or she had ever done to insult him. Professor Snape has been good to her. He has mentored her and has taught her a number of lessons, one of them being that Harriet should never take anything at its face value. He was right since professor himself was not a heartless man though the way he behaved would suggest otherwise.
"Yes, Potter. It's not like you have a job. What's the rush?" asked Zabini, his brows creased in a frown. Harriet did not know how to answer. She didn't think that Zabini was mocking her. He looked curious.
"You're more then your dad's son. You're a determined, ambitious man who doesn't have an ounce of arrogance in him despite being the best and youngest seeker ever. I've always known that. It's time you accept it too." Scorpius murmurs gently.
"Lord Burbage didn't want us to disturb the muggles living here." Weasley declares roughly and Draco rolls his eyes and even that slight movement is painful. His eyes are burning. He really needs to sleep.
"Despise you. DESPISE YOU." Harry screamed and Draco replied "What am I to you, after all? I have so much emotional baggage."
"YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE POTTER." Weasley shouted and they stared. "GINNY WILL NEVER DO SO. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SOMEONE WAS POLYJUICED AS HER."
"Well, we will meet him. You can ask him yourself." Black replies sullenly, staring with her round and sad eyes at Severus.
"Harry, it- it must stink- don't-" Draco started but Harry cut him off "Shhhh. Let me. Please. I need you so much."
Harry stood up and so did Draco. They pressed a kiss on her head and her cheeks tinged pink before she smiled beautifully at them.
They came inside and sat in front of him. Ron was the first one to murmur "We were not the ones Harry. You know us better than that. Moreover, we were with you after the trial, trying to search him."
"Why didn't you tell us? We could have helped you." James says because he is the eldest and he has always been protective of his siblings.
Harriet wondered who Ariana was talking. There was just something very final in her tone, something that suggested that she was going to do something about this hatred of hers.
"Well, I can't. I need you to protect me. I am afraid that this person would abduct me. Are you saying that you don't want to protect me? Say it bluntly." Harry spoke, trying to sound genuine. Of course Draco saw through him and spoke "You are lying. You do not need my protection at all. You just want to protect me."
He clears his throat and reveals himself. The girl lowers her head very abruptly and he frowns in confusion. Albus's fingers are wrapped tightly around hers.
He could've become an auror but that won't have helped him achieve what he wanted to. Ministry would still run the way it used to. He didn't have the patience or the energy to even attempt to change things.
Draco had struck the deal with the vampire coven the day next to his confrontation with Harry and his friends and had not wanted to make a big deal out of it. But Harry had been so proud of him and had taken him to celebrate in the most expensive restaurant of France. He had expressed his pride innumerable times that day. Draco had never known that Harry could change so much.
"No, Harry, I was not raped. You don't understand. I was not raped. I am a Malfoy and Malfoys are not weak." Draco's voice was urgent and Harry broke down completely. He started sobbing on Draco's shoulder.
"It's your fault. Admit it." He snarled, struggling to pull out of Draco's hold. Draco looked into his eyes for a few minutes after which he whispered "I admit it. "
Harry does not answer and Draco heaves a heavy sigh before pulling Harry on the bed to lie beside him.
"Of course we don't hate her Harry. She is Hugo's and Rose's friend. They asked us to stay away and so we did." Ron answers. Hermione, however looks at Scorpia's head. She is staring at the table silently. Albus is talking to James and Lily.
Green eyes search his face for something. James is slightly taller than Scorpius and is more muscled and handsome.
As she wanted, he is crying but so is she. He is screaming and trembling and nothing except his screams can be heard in the room.
They apparated in front of Harry's home and Draco could finally breathe. He had not been to able to prevent his fear when a large crowd had gathered around him, pushing Harry away somewhere.
For a few moments, she doesn't speak anything. She stares at him, as if waiting for something. He sighs and moves closer to her. She wants a kiss. He will give her what she wants although he is afraid that he won't be able to stop once he gets started.
With a jerk, he slipped out of the tub. Merlin, his skin was burning and it was bound to leave rashes. It was paining so much.
Harry cleared his throat and started "Yesterday, before I came here, I had wanted go to loo but when I tried, I fell down. Somehow, I managed to finish my business and returned to my bed. But then I felt thirsty and went to take water from the table and stumbled again. My leg was aching."
"You can go now." Harry said and they left. He sighed and locked the place. He was about to floo home when he heard an insistent tapping on the window. He frowned and turned to looked at it.
"Scorpia sit down." Harry murmurs and she obliges. He decides to leave the 'trouble' she is in for later. She is not ready to share anything yet. He decides to stick to mundane topics for now and smiles at them.
A flick of Harry's fingers and Draco found himself dressed in a black shirt and pyjamas. On this note, Harry left the room without sparing them another glance.
"I NEVER, NEVER PRIORITISED ANYONE ELSE. I WAS EARNING FOR YOU SO THAT I COULD KEEP YOU HAPPY. BUT NO, YOU HAD TO MISINTERPRET IT. YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE." Harry had never felt so very helpless in his entire life.
"So how do you prefer your tea." He asks sweetly. She gapes at him. Albus grins. His fingers are still wrapped around Scorpia's.
"Merlin! I can't." He whispered desperately and placed his hands on Draco's hips before pressing his lips in the junction of his neck and shoulder. He sucked the skin and Draco protested weekly, "Harry please."
Severus rubs his temple and wonders if he will suffer from a constant headache until Harriet has accomplished what he wishes to. Draco could have made all this much simpler by simply using his mind and refusing to get marked. But no, the brat had to make it difficult and Harriet Potter, of all people, had to be the one to fall in love with his godson. Harriet Potter who thinks like a gryffindor and doesn't care about the fact that Draco could very well betray her.
"But, Harry-" He started and Harry shouted at him "I can take care of it. Why are you arguing with me?" Draco stared, stunned. Why would Harry behave so aggressively? Harry was hiding something and he won't tell Draco unless he feels comfortable so Draco backed off "Okay. If you need help-"
What will he do now? The photos will destroy the relationship that had built between them in the past few days. He shook his head and tried to clear his thoughts. But the image of Harry's devastated and disgusted face when he would finally see these pictures won't leave him. Tears started slipping from his eyes and he pulled his hair in frustration.
Suddenly, they heard sharp and loud barks and Draco blinked on finding that several dogs were running towards them. They were really huge and blood thirsty.
"All right then. I will clean the sitting area and the kitchen. You can take the two master bedrooms and one guestroom." Harry spoke softly. It was surprising that Harry heard his unspoken words too.
There's no love lost between them. Petunia hated Snape for taking her sister away from her. A part of her will always hate this man.
"You are. Running away, cowering in the face of situations that involve interaction with other people are symptoms of cowardice, darling." Harry muttered and Draco pulled back to glare at him. Harry continued, unaffected by his husband's glare "Never figured that you will turn out to be such a big coward."
"You can set the pace, Draco. I am happy. In fact I have not been so happy for the past four years. Every day is worth living when you are with me. I love you so much." Harry whispered and Draco cleaned them with a spell.
Sirius shook his head and said, "Like I said, Ron is running a chain of bakeries now and Harry is the finest auror as well as detective we have."
?" He asks softly and he has to close his eyes to stop the images that are now dancing in the forefront of his mind, the memories - the reminder of his worst mistake. He is still bearing the consequences of that mistake. He wishes to stop this before it gets out of hand but he can do nothing about this. Draco has many qualities but a good heart is not one them. He's his father's son through and through.
"I'm not my father, Malfoy." James mutters abruptly and Scorpius realizes that the other man has stopped walking.
Ron enters and settles down beside Hermione, his eyes tired and asks, "So, where is Malfoy? How is she doing?"
"I am sorry that your effort went wasted." Draco spoke, his eyes on Harry now and Harry smiled "It is worth it. I want revenge as well. Now that you are with me, I can set the academy in Britain all over again. Perhaps, we can make it a Duelling and potions academy. I am certain many students would want internship under the great Draco Malfoy. I think that I will give the necessary examinations and become a professional Duellist."
Scorpius doesn't reply. He only increases the volume of his stereo and leans back before closing his eyes. Knowing that there is nothing he can do to convince Scorpius to accompany him, he opens the door and gets outside. He slams the door of the car tightly but Scorpius doesn't as much as move.
love Potter. Potter is just so easy and naive. Draco needs Potter's protection to get his family out of this mess father has got them into.
Severus sighed " I can't tell you. I have heard that Minister O' Dmello is hosting a party in a couple of days and is going to invite Draco and you. I am quite sure that he will invite some important people from Britain as well. Stay with Draco. That's all I can say. "
"Please, Draco. Undress. Just remove your trousers and underwear and turn around. I would do it myself but you are simply not ready for that kind of intimacy." Harry murmured and he was so angry and worried. Draco must have hidden scars very well. He had never noticed them. Knife created deep scars, which meant Draco had never got them healed. Why had he hidden them for so long?
Potter was following him. Underneath her cloak. Again. It was as frustrating as it was amusing. Hogwarts was clearly pissed off at him. He wanted to pee and the moment he tried to get inside a bathroom, Hogwarts just closed the door on his face. There was one beyond the seventh floor stairs so he was headed there and of course, Potter was following him, thinking that he was upto something.
"Okay. Your tea is already cold. You need to have it." He spoke softly and Draco stared at him, the letter crumpled in his hands. "What? You expected me to snap at you, to force you to spill the secret that has been torturing you for the past decade. You want me to shout at you to tell me about the writer of this letter? Believe me Draco, I am not going to do either. Do not forget to burn that bloody letter."
The policemen had to intervene to stop them from killing the bastard on the spot. Aunt petunia had not wished to see her husband so she had not come with them. He had returned with a lighter heart and a happy Tessa. She seemed content and looked at her father with a newly found respect.
He sits up to look properly at her. He wants to understand that why she thinks like this- just because she initiated something, she must complete it, no matter whether she wants it or not- it's ridiculous to even think about. What gave her this idea. Surely, it couldn't be that - that- well that incident with Riddle. She must know how wrong it was.
Harry opened his eyes and expected to find himself on his floor, surrounded by empty and mostly broken bottles of Vodka and blinked his eyes and realised that he was on a bed instead. His eyebrows rose in confusion and surprise when he looked around and realised that he was not at home.
"I'll be in my office. If you have your own office somewhere, just let me know." Potter said, his back facing Draco and walked away, his hands pushed inside his pockets and his face straight ahead.
He did not turn around though because he stunned speechless when he saw his aunt's eyes well with tears. Her face was pale and thin. She was practically a bag of bones. It was like she was not eating anything at all.
The next question was put to Neville "I owled you and requested you to give me the job of tending to your greenhouses. Did you get my letters?"
Harry looked at Draco and asked softly "Should we proceed or should I fix appointment with another healer?" Hermione wore her gloves and continued "I know a healer who is good and I can get your appointment fixed."
Sirius doesn't reply. Instead, he stops near a table for two and sits on it. Draco sits across Sirius quietly and cautiously. He can't let Sirius escape which the man will if he is given even a single chance.
"Yes. I am coming." Draco replied and crawled out of the bed. He stretched his body and noticed Harry's eyes trailing over his chest. Harry averted his eyes, his cheeks tinged pink when Draco cleared his throat and Draco helped Harry on the wheelchair he had ordered for Harry.
"I lived in a cupboard until I was eleven." Harry murmured and Draco stopped eating. It was comical to see Draco's hand freeze in between and his eyes turn to look at him in shock. The spoon dropped and Draco just stared at him. Harry continued "They gave Dudley's old clothes to me to wear and they were so lose. Vernon often tried to take the advantage of the fact that my trousers could slide down if they were just shook a little but my accidental magic came to my aid. "
A choked "Please" escaped Draco's lips and his eyes shot open. This was a very crucial moment because it would decide whether Draco could trust him or not. It would decide whether Draco would take the risk to make love with him again. He had to control himself. He looked at his achingly hard cock which rested on Draco's thighs. His hand was still on Draco's zipper. He removed his hand and zipped Draco's trousers and then buttoned them. He accioed his own trousers and put them on after crawling beside Draco.
"To the hell with you. I know Harry's anger and anyways I am not interested in Draco now. He has been fucked over and over and I have no intention in doing this anymore."
"So you have already decided, eh?" Hermione scowls at him, "This is completely absurd. Running away is not a solution."
"I told you that there's no point of this. No-body knows where they are." Scorpius mutters, exasperated. They have been arguing about this for a long time.
"You are not dirty, Draco." Harry argued, barely concealing his fury and alarm. Hermione agreed firmly "You are not and that's what I meant. You need to talk about it. Right now, you must rest. We will go shop for some robes for Harry when you wake up. Till then we are going to get ready at our own place. Open your mouth. I am giving you a dreamless sleep potion. I will bring ye medicines you need to take."
"Bring her to my office in an hour. The attack might have left internal injuries. How old was she at that time?" Draco asked blankly. He would not punish a child for her father's mistakes.
"Thank you. I can't tell you more yet. I will when I am comfortable." Harry said and before Draco realized what he was doing, he walked towards the miserable ball that was Harry and turned him over to hug him.
"No." The answer came in a quivering voice, "She was fine. The bleeding stopped and her temperature came back to normal."
For the first time, Draco slept very peacefully and he pressed a soft kiss on his forehead. "I love you Draco."
But he couldn't calm down. It was easy for the woman to ask him to calm down but he couldn't even breathe properly. He couldn't survive in a world devoid of Harry.
"This is the twenty fifth time you have been brought over here in the past year because of the over consumption of alcohol and-" She started speaking and placed a vial containing blue liquid on his lips. He interrupted her after consuming the potion "I am sorry for that day."
It was not that Draco had a problem with bottoming. Harry had given him the option of topping until but Draco had refused. He was not ready for sex. Harry had been so sweet when he had told him that their was no dominant or submissive between them. Draco had known this of course but still Harry had been very soft and gentle while explaining these things and Draco had been relieved.
"Draco. Please. Please be alive." He shouted frantically, his voice breaking and his eyes tearing up.
Through all of it, Harry stayed quiet, reliving all the previous instances when he had confronted Lucius and the man had always avoided looking at him.
"Yes." Harry replied and Draco continued "Let's have breakfast." Harry could have insisted but he knew the consequences will be disastrous. So he merely nodded and whispered back "Can I –" He stopped because he did not know the right words.
"But lord Burbage said-" Corner murmurs and Draco wants to slap his face hard. He resists the urge though because it won't do him any good to confront them when he is so injured.
Vernon gaped at her. A loud and sudden CLANG startled her and she turned her head to find Dudley glaring at her.
He walked towards the floo and knelt down to receive the floo call. He was confused as well as irritated to find Granger's face in his floo.
He freezes on the spot when this happens as if she interrupted his train of thought. His eyes flash as he stares at the scars that her body has and his mouth opens as if he is going to snarl. She doesn't cover herself. This moment ... she will never forget this moment.
"Of course you would support him. You always did. That was one of the reasons I have never told you anything at all. " Draco said angrily and bitterly and Harry stared.
"Fancy seeing you here Malfoy." Somehow Harry's mouth seems fit to engage the woman in small talk. She stands under the shed besides him and turns her unreadable eyes towards him once again. He doesn't get out of his house so he doesn't know if she lives somewhere nearby or not. She doesn't answer him.
Draco looked at him with utterly sad eyes and Harry's heart clenched. Harry expected him to say something but he just shook his head, mumbling "Nothing."
"Where did he go? WHERE DID HE GO?" Draco hears, panting hard. He covers his mouth with his right hand to stifle a moan and braces himself against the wall, breathing heavily through his nose. Blood trickles down his cheeks from the gashes on his forehead and nose. His left leg is so wounded that he can barely walk and his head is pounding. His hands are trembling so much that he doesn't know how he will defend himself, if they attack him. They have snapped his wand and he has no strength to fight them physically.
"Yes, Harry. I want you to be Draco's partner for this case." He sighed and then turned to look at Weasley, "You can help them if you want or you can take an extended leave if that's what you want."
"You are wrong Draco. You never suffocated me. I was wrong and immature and did not tell you about the ghosts of my own past. I need you like I need to breathe; Draco and I will die without you. I will die and the blame will rest on your shoulders because I love you and I will never look at anyone else. Perhaps the next time you meet me, I will be dead and far gone to say this so I am repeating that I love you and never looked at anyone else.  Goodbye and I wish you best for your life." Harry spoke and left after looking at him for a couple of minutes.
He crossed his arms and tried to intimidate Black. He only stood in front of Draco with raised eyebrows. It must be Severus's influence. Draco gritted his teeth and started heading towards the exit.
Granger couldn't have chosen a worst time to arrive. She knocked the door and he flicked his wand to open the door. To say that he was irritated to see her would be an understatement. Her greeting was just an icing on the top of his fury.
"No need to be disrespectful Mr. Potter-Malfoy." Severus snapped at him and Harry glared at him before continuing "I will inform everyone when he wakes up. Leave."
"Scorpia's age as recorded in the ministry records is sixteen but I don't think that's right. She must be James age. I am fairly certain that she was pregnant when she married. No-one remembers though. No-one cared much about that small detail." Hermione finishes.
"She is right and before you ask me, I am not aware of Draco's whereabouts. Draco owled me long back. He had taken residence somewhere. It was temporary and I'll give you the address if you like." Blaise answers politely.
Finally Harry couldn't take Draco's silence anymore. So he decided to break it by telling a little about his own childhood.
"I don't understand anything. Riddle and Voldemort are one and the same. Surely you are mistaken." He mutters and Draco sighs audibly.
"Oh!" Harry exclaimed. He couldn't leave Malfoy alone, no matter how much he wanted to. That Malfoy would be here, in Godric's Hollow, clearly obliviated and that too with his child indicated that something was very very wrong. Who obliviated him and why? After all, Malfoy had not taken the dark mark and there had absolutely been no evidence of Malfoy being a death eater or involved in their activities in any way.
"Harry, don't-" Draco uttered and Harry, stumbled and fell down on the floor, horrified when he saw the damage on Draco's hips and inside his anus. "Harry, I am – I can explain. I will conceal them and you don't have to see them ever again. I am sorry-"
"Leave me alone." Dad says blankly and continues staring at the opposite wall, "Send Scorpius inside."
Draco stops speaking suddenly and his sharp, narrowed eyes flicker over everyone. A bead of sweat gathers on Albus's forehead when they settle on him and blink twice.
he followed Dudley towards the sitting room and Dudley spoke politely "Sit. Coffee or tea or something else?"
Harry looks into Snape's eyes and murmurs, "You have to understand. I can't lose another second. I don't have even a single minute to waste."
"Shhhhhhh." Black suddenly murmured, her cheeks tinged red and Severus froze as the woman stared into the child's eyes before mumbling, "That's a secret."
The blonde slammed the door open and shouted at his best friend who had turned red from embarrassment "Just because I whored myself out to you years ago because I did not have money and was misled, you think that you have a right to enter my bath and watch me naked with Harry. Let me tell this to you, Weasley. I have not hurt you for the past decade because you are Harry's friend, not because I have forgiven you. I hate you and your entire family and not because you are blood traitors. "
"I never received any letter. Did you receive any owl from him? Fred , George." Neville spoke softly and the Fred murmured, his hands in his pocket "No I didn't" "Neither did I" George continued.
"Now leave. " Draco said and Harry had a strange lump in his throat as he walked towards the door. He turned around on the door to look at Draco again and Draco was looking directly at him with tortured eyes.
Severus wonders if the father is one of the Weasley brothers. Potter is still on talking terms with Granger and Weasley. However, their friendship is not even close to what it was then. No-one knows who the father of Potter's kids is. She had left Britain shortly after the war and then had returned a few years later with three kids.
His eyes were wet and he hugged Harry desperately. Harry knew him and so he kept quiet. Draco did not need any false reassurances.
As such, she doesn't have any energy to take part in the war and she is not very proficient in wandless magic but she does wish to watch the dark lord die and she does wish to help in his death if she can. So instead of using the portkey, she follows Potter, knowing that he would go directly towards the dark lord.
These thoughts drove him to alcohol again and he left his suffocating home to get a drink at the nearest pub.
"You're not asking me to do anything. I'm doing this of my own accord." Harriet said, "And anyways, uncle Severus has taught me well. I can take care of myself."
"You tried to-" Harry started but broke off because their was no way to express his madness at that moment. He was furious, worried and just so pathetically helpless at that moment. Their was no way to save Draco from himself.
"Daddy. Who is it?" A girl spoke and Dudley turned around "Your uncle Harry is here with Draco, Tessa. Come and invite them in." His voice was so warm and loving that Harry stared at Draco, trying to depict his surprise. Draco smiled a bit and spoke "People change, Harry."
He shook his head, muttering, "Never-mind. Tell your brat that I'll quiz him on what I taught him last time," and before Lucius could answer, Voldemort apparated. He only cared about killing Harry Potter. THAT WAS IT. Yet, he couldn't get his silent weeping, scratches -
Shame on him. He had lost Draco again. He had lost Draco for the second time. Draco had snapped again. It would have been better if he had stayed away from Harry. That way, at least he would be alive.
"Now, let's get ready. They have done their share of the work. It's our turn now. Back then, Draco you were a boy who was lost and frightened but now you are a successful potions master and have been invited to Britain by Kingsley himself, the judge who gave the judgment to banish you from here. Not just Britain, but various ministries have been owling you to live in their country. Always remember that there are people who would fight for you if you disappear. Remember that your duelling skills equal mine and that no one can overpower or control you now." Harry whispers, Draco's hands in his and Draco breathes before murmuring, "Okay."
It's strange to witness this side of Draco. She has never been so quiet and it seems strange. Harry wishes that she returns to her old self again.
"Harry." Draco nudged Harry's shoulders lightly to wake him up. It was time they left for home. Harry's discharge slip had been given to him by Granger. Harry had slept peacefully in his lap all the whole and Granger had told him curtly that Harry had not slept so well in years.
They only watched as the Fred wrapped an arm around Potter's shoulders. She was still in her off-shoulder gown so his hand rested on her forearm. He wrapped his other hand around her stomach, pulling her close to him. She smiled tightly.
Draco loved Harry so much that he couldn't really express it in words. He knew that Harry wanted to kiss him but did not say anything because he felt that Draco was not ready.
Everything is ridiculous. Potter is supposed to be dead but he's alive. His wand was snapped and he's still doing magic. The sheer absurdity of the situation leads Draco to believe that he's dreaming and everything will simply be gone when he would wake up. He'll probably find himself in a holding cell with handcuffs around his hands and dementors as his guards.
She apparated before Harry had even opened his mouth and he was left gaping at the door, wondering worriedly where she had gone.
"Malfoy is not good for him, Ron. He should have married Ginny. You know. You were there at past ministry functions. You know that Malfoy behaved like a madman, an- an animal." Hermione yelled at him and Ron sighed in frustration for the millionth time "Hermione, Harry is not a child. Will you stop interfering in his life? You know the reason for Draco's behaviour."
Harry snarled "Of course you think that I am concerned about – about the fact that these scars will remind me of your past. You stupid asshole, why DID YOU NEVER TELL ME ABOUT THESE?"
"The first time, those couple of hulks came in, I had tried to free myself but I couldn't. I had begged them to stop but they didn't. They were too strong and I couldn't throw them off and all the subsequent clients had forced themselves on me. I had always protested. I had wanted them to leave and told them that I would rather die of hunger but they wouldn't leave Harry and would show me money and I was so hungry at times that I couldn't deny but by the end, I protested and begged them to stop, to not fuck me but they did it anyways."
"Karma is a bitch isn't it Sirius? Now, you will pretend that you have captured me until Ginny has lowered her guards. I want her spit everything out. You will either do this quietly or we will get your sentence increased." Draco mutters curtly, his fingers pointed towards Sirius. A white light escapes them and suddenly Sirius starts having trouble breathing. Draco is furious and now that he has finally got the opportunity to take his revenge, he wants to punish this man.
Draco stared at Harry and then sighed. He did not want to know what the damned letter was about. He smiled sadly when Harry looked at him but did not ask anything. Harry was startled for a second but then he continued speaking and Draco looked at Ron's white face.
He had no choice, though, because the trio walked directly towards them, not knowing how alarmed Harry and his best friends were.
"Harry." He spoke softly and then closed his mouth to clear his throat. Harry did not speak at all for a couple of minutes. They just looked at each other.
Draco takes a deep breath before laying down on Potter's lap again. She stares at his face. He seems annoyed.
Albus stares at the man silently. Before Albus can answer, Mr. Zabini continues, "Oh my! Now I remember. How could I forget it. I would ask you to stay away from this but I know that you won't. I will have you know Albus that what you are doing is going to have consequences."
"It wouldn't take much to break him again. An accidental meeting with a couple of his past clients who still want him in their beds and boom, Malfoy will break." Ginny snapped "I did it then and I can do it again. Harry will belong to no one if not me."
want? I want to strangle you to death." Draco sneered. Hiring an escort was one thing and humiliating them in front of a hundred people just out of spite was another. No-one deserved that.
Draco opened his eyes and yawned. When he felt for Harry around him, he realized that Harry had already gotten up and left. He cast 'Tempus' and realized that it was half past eight and he was way too late than usual.
Lucius's voice was deadpanned and everyone fell silent. Finally, Hermione spoke up after a few minutes, "Mr. Malfoy, did he say anything about Draco?"
"Neither do I care about your apologies, nor about your family. Draco is beyond any help. He is as thick-headed as you were in your youth. Malfoy genes I guess." Rage simmers inside Severus as he relives how Lucius kept him away from Draco.
Harry had never even imagined that Draco was holding so much pain inside him. He cried and screamed and shook and trembled and hugged Harry tightly. He cursed those bastards and vowed to destroy them, crying all the while. At a point he punched Harry's chest and cursed him for not caring earlier.
Draco is unable to hear anything else because very suddenly the wall rotates and a second later he finds himself in a large room. His stunned eyes take in his surroundings. The room is large and is filled with beautiful wooden and glass furniture of several shapes and sizes. Some pieces are complete and some are only partially ready. It's dimply lit and there's a fireplace on the left hand side of the room. Draco breathes hard, trying to understand what just happened.
Petunia freezes and her jaw drops as she stares at the little child who's once again looking at her with those huge and adorable eyes of his and he's just as cute as Lily was when she was tiny.
"What's wrong? Did I say something?" Draco whispers. He wishes he was over his past. He wishes that he could let Harry make love to him. Harry places his face in his hands and shudders again. Draco sits up in concern and tries to pull his hands away from his face. Harry's eyes are pained and Draco can't bear it. He leans forward and kisses his lips softly before whispering, "What's the matter?"
"I didn't know that he had taken you. Had I known, I would never have let him do that. I would have died but won't have let him do that."
Instead of answering him, mom looks at dad and utters gently, "You know that it's time. We can't change our past."
"Come on, you have barely eaten anything, Harriet. Just one bite," Draco's head snapped towards the voice. It was George and he had a large bite pancake between his thumb and first two fingers and his thumb.
He heard a gasp and spun around to find Lucius still standing at the door, staring at Draco's chest. His eyes were so pained that Harry had to avert his eyes. Narcissa applied the ointment gently on Draco's chest and Harry was astonished. Her eyes were wet but her fingers did not stop, not even for a minute. They did not shake or tremble, like he had expected them to.
"Let's go out. Weather is quite nice outside." She murmurs, her fingers tapping on the bedsheet randomly.
Draco nodded and Harry opened his arms to welcome him. Draco's tremble betrayed his terror and he lingered in Harry's arms.
"Please. Only this once Draco. I want you so much." He begged and left a trail of kisses from Draco's neck to shoulder.
Draco expected Harry to snap at him or perhaps glare in return. The reply he received was unexpected. Harry looked at him apologetically "I am sorry."
"Yes," Neville answered, his brows creased in a frown and Luna, being Luna murmured quietly, "Hogwarts is angry."
"Draco, let him go." Severus who had reached him and was standing beside him spoke in a very stern voice. Draco would have snarled at anyone else but one look into Severus's eyes and he knew that Severus would not tolerate no for an answer. Very reluctantly, he pulled back and scowled while the veela took a couple of deep breaths.
But it came as a blow to him because he should have been there for him when Draco needed him. Instead he had wasted so much time drinking and wallowing in his own misery.
"What about your lab. You have still not set it up." Harry asked and Draco nodded again, replying "I will do it today."
"Well, I don't." Harry replied testily and Draco gritted his teeth in annoyance "You will sign them."
She turned to look at Vernon who was reading the newspaper quietly. He was wearing his pyjamas and a shirt and he looked old. His hair was white and his eyes were fixed on the newspaper as if he hadn't even noticed her yet. She knew better, though. His fingers were clutching the newspaper tightly. He knew about her presence. Dudley was sitting across him with a small glass of milk and a plate that had a very small piece of pancake. Petunia stared - it was close to what she gave to Harry for breakfast. Why would Dudley have so little? A plate of pancakes was kept on the table but no-one was having them.
The wounds were drying but the skin was burnt off at many places. Most of the skin of Draco's thighs, forearms, complete back was peeling off. Fortunately, his face was safe. Harry knew that Draco won't have been able to bear it if his face had burnt. He must have shielded it and his tummy and chest area. There were burns on those places too, though the skin was not peeling off.
To his surprise, Potter came outside and closed the door behind him. He pulled away from the wall and started walking again and then he stopped again when he saw some scratches on the boy's face. They were near his lips and there was also some kind of wound on his throat. Voldemort frowned.
What he did understand was that he had wasted another precious day. So, he would come tomorrow and cast the curse and get it over with and get on with his plan to take over Hogwarts. He would probably become the youngest minister of magic in the history of magic. Well, technically, the youngest. He would make new laws restricting mudbloods and half bloods from using magic.
"I lied. I liked them and I still wear them in my most important meetings, though I have a variety of robes now." Draco replied and left, closing the door behind him with a softly mumbled "This does not change anything. I am not good for you. You deserve better than me."
"What the fuck are you going on about, Harry?" Draco asked, alarmed. He crawled out of the bed and stood on the other side of the bed. Some parts of his body burned and he had stifle a moan. He had still not looked at his body properly. Merlin knew it would be horrifying.
She answers his unasked question. Both Dean and Seamus knew. Yet they didn't come forward to tell Harry.
"No. I don't think I ever will be well again." She murmurs and turns around. Her eyes gaze silently at him. They are wet again.
"Now, I will make you feel the same agony I go through when you attempt to kill yourself. I will make you understand that I love you, that I love you enough to go insane, to die, to - to leave everything for you and then you can follow me Draco. But I-" Harry whispered, his face wet with tears, his voice hoarse from shouting and his eyes mad and wild. He was a picture of madness and Draco moved towards him in concern "I am sorry, Harry. Please." He was alarmed by Harry's statement and wanted to prevent him from taking any rash decisions but it happened too fast, too fast for him to stop.
Harry stood inside the kitchen and could imagine Draco preparing his favourite treacle tart so as to make him happy. He had been so careless, he thought as he walked towards his sitting room.
"Harry, he is angry. He will hurt you. You must-" She started and Harry had expected what happened next. He pulled away from Harry and moved two steps and slapped her tightly on her cheek. She stared at him with a hand on her cheek, her eyes wide with shock. Harry rubbed his forehead tiredly.
"Potter, he really didn't mean any harm to you," Blaise murmured quietly, "he- we thought that you were feeling uncomfortable that's why he intervened."
"The point is," Aunt Sierra started softly, "You'll go and bring him back and won't worry about us. You're not asking us to sacrifice anything."
The black haired irritating slytherin woman sitting on the couch muttered "If we get caught, they will not leave us alive. Together, they are a force to be reckoned with."
"I have heard that she is good." Draco spoke and Harry cleared his throat. He was looking softly at Draco and Draco was glad that it was love he felt for Draco not pity. "You are not comfortable with her yet. We can take appointment of another healer."
Draco felt something press on his lips and then a hand pressed his throat softly. He drank water and the hands were removed and so was the bottle. His body felt heavy and it felt that he had been sleeping for a very long time. It burned a bit in some places but otherwise it felt fine. He knew that he would have a lot of scars on his body, hideous scars that would disgust Harry and would ruin there already non existing sex life. How could he have been so stupid?
It is a surprise that she is desperate enough to believe that Harry will marry her. He hides behind a tree and waits for Draco and others to apparate. The aurors arrive one by one and position themselves at different locations waiting for them as well.
The moment Harry touched his shirt's button, Draco felt his forehead sweat. Still, Harry looked into his eyes intensely and Draco tried to distract his unwavering gaze by unbuttoning Harry's shirt. Harry let him and Harry's shirt was on the floor and Draco stared at Harry's broad chest. He still had a few battle scars and Draco traced his finger on Harry's tight nipples. Harry hissed and Draco pinched them. Harry moaned and Draco's heart raced a bit.
"Shut it." Mother snapped at Draco and father and they stared at her, "You have to speak to Harry, Draco. Fight for yourself like you always did. I did not give birth to a defeatist."
Dad pulls back, takes a deep breath and asks blankly, "That's besides the point. How did you find this room?"
She stops rocking and settles on a couch right in front of the fireplace. She doesn't look at anyone and doesn't say anything. She presses her knees to her chest and stares at the fire burning inside the hearth.
A couple of moments pass before Draco realizes that he has company. He blinks a couple of times and turns his head towards the entryway and is utterly shocked to see Severus standing there. Frankly speaking, he is beginning to wonder if he is in some alternate universe.
He finds himself wondering exactly whom she is hiding from. Besides him, Narcissa is staring at the girl. Her reaction quite similar to his.
"I am proud of the man you have become." These were the first coherent words that escaped her mouth and he blinked several times to prevent the tears from falling again.
"You may leave." Black said and stood up. He leaned against the window and stared out and stood there until all of them left. Draco saw him closing the door, his brows creased.
Harry lay down with a sigh. His anger transformed into pain and longing when he turned around to look at Draco's unconscious face. He looked peaceful, the credit of which went to Hermione and Severus. Severus had brought his self-brewed potions at a short notice and Hermione had been available to assist Harry. He took Draco's hand in his and entwined their fingers after placing a soft kiss on his palm.
According to Sirius, Harry was not on talking terms with him and he was really friendly with Draco. Draco had never really noticed the tight hugs that Sirius always gave to him or the way he had found the man looking at his arse a few times in the past but now it was coming to him. Sirius had always wanted to touch him in one way or the other.
"I was being stupid. You always added extra raisins and caramel for me. Nobody puts caramel in Treacle Tarts. I loved it and often waited for you to make it again." Harry stopped and waited but Draco did not answer so he continued "I should have told you. I am sorry that I didn't."
"Hello, Scorpius." Says Ginny. She dislikes both father and uncle Harry. Scorpius often wonders why.
"Come on brother. Finish him off." The younger brother who is Bellatrix's husband screams and receives a rough, "But the game has just started. I don't want him to get off so easily. I want him to be in pain before we crucio him. We can't risk it. He can't recover from our attack otherwise the dark lord will kill us. This is the best way we can prove our loyalty towards him."
Severus stares at the five year old boy in surprise. He had always scoffed at parents who melted at the sight of their crying or smiling children and had vowed to never succumb to their huge eyes and adorable pouts. However, he really finds himself empathizing with all those parents as Harry stares at him, settled on his lap and dangling his legs in the air.
"Draco. Call me Draco." Draco replied and shook Dudley's extended hands, nudging Harry's shoulders. Harry cleared his throat abruptly, "Um, hello Dudley."
Without even turning back, he snarled at the veela, "I'll kill you today and do this entire world a favour."
Of course Harry was angry but he was angry at people who had hurt Draco. Why would he be angry at Draco at all?
Harry knew that Draco was hiding something crucial from him and he would not tell anything to Harry. This did not change the fact that he wanted to know what Draco was hiding because whatever it was, it was eating Draco from inside.
Sirius gets out of the bed and walks towards Harry before placing his hands on Harry's shoulders, "Harry what's the matter?" His near escape from death at the department of mysteries has changed him a lot. He doesn't take rash decisions anymore and it's a good thing that the aurors managed to catch Pettigrew too. Sirius understands that he is not alone now, that he has a godson who needs him.
Unable to stand anymore, she slumped on her chair, staring at Ron. Had she been so wrong? She is a healer, for god's sake?
"See Hermione I told you. You should have spoken to her." Ron snaps at Hermione. Harry stares at him. His brown eyes are irritated as he regards an equally annoyed Hermione Granger.
The blow however doesn't come. A moment later, Harry feels harsh hands pull his hair back as the elder brother smirks at him. Harry is so terrified that he just wishes that they had just crucioed on him and gotten done with it.
Severus Snape, renowned potions master of Britain and a double spy, stares slack jawed at the green eyed menace standing in front of him. Severus has always been proud of himself for being prepared for everything. No-one ever accomplishes to take him by surprise and Harriet Potter is the only witch in the entire world who can somehow always manage to reduce Severus Snape to this.
"Severus I am going. When will you come?" Draco called after having worn his joggers and a white t-shirt.
Silence ensued until Harry reached the door of the bath. Draco asked in a small voice "Are you not angry?"
"Harry I am sorry." Draco averted his eyes and spoke softly, his fingers tracing random patterns on their bed sheet. Harry wanted to slam his head on the wall he had been staring at.
If this bastard thought that he would go unpunished then he was sorely mistaken. He clenched his fist and glared at the fireplace angrily.
He didn't reply for a few moments - only looked silently at her before saying, "I'm not much hungry. I'll have a glass of milk."
Finally, Lucius started, "How much do you love my son, Harry?" and Harry stared at Lucius. Lucius looked at him, his right ankle on his left knee and his arms crossed.
At thirty nine, Draco is a handsome man with a lean, athletic body. He has broad shoulders and a flat stomach and doesn't look a day over twenty five. Usually, he dresses in muggle clothes. Today he has put on a cream colored shirt and black jeans. No one feature makes him so striking. Although Albus would say that his eyes come close. They are silver and intoxicating and when they fall on Albus, he can't help but shiver under their scrutiny.
He looked at the rack of knifes and smiled. Harry was fond of cooking and had brought knives of various sizes. He picked up the biggest knife and scratched the pulse on his wrist. It hurt, of course so his eyes became wet with tears. The scratch bled and he closed his eyes to try again.
Harry slammed the door open and closed it. Draco was still unconscious and he walked blindly towards the bed. After lying down on it, he just stared at his husband's face. A minute later, the door opened and Harry did not need to turn around to know the identity of the visitor.
Harry's eyes shot open when Draco pulled his hair and crushed their lips in a brutal and hungry kiss. Harry's eyes closed and his hands cupped Draco's buttocks. The kiss was passionate and Harry had missed Draco so much. He had missed Draco's warmth and fierceness and possessiveness because that was the only word that explained Draco's strong hold on Harry's hair and the blood that had gathered on the corner of his lips, as a result of Draco's biting.
Weasley nodded, "And a detective. There are only two detectives. Me and Harry. But we're aurors as well."
Draco reappeared in front of a barren land and paced back and forth. What was happening? How could he have walked out of Hogwarts and right into another dimension because that's what this clearly was. This wasn't time travel because father had always been a business man, not the head auror. This was inter-dimensional travel. But, how was this even possible? Inter dimensional travel was supposed to be a myth!
"SELFISH. I AM NOT SELFISH . I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY." Draco screamed and Harry looked at him, wild laughter bubbling in his throat again. "Harry. Please calm down." Draco was on the verge of panic now but Harry was too mad.
He had not gone to Snape's place. He had shopped for groceries and then walked a bit and spent his time in a garden. When it became unbearable for him to stay still for another moment, he decided to return. It was just seven PM and Draco had asked him to return at 9. But He just couldn't stay away for a moment longer. So he closed his eyes and apparated to his house.
Harry tries to get out of his grip but the man flicks his wand and binds Harry's hands behind his back.
"Nevertheless, I shall talk to them." Severus mutters and takes out the vial from his pocket before placing it in front of Potter.
At last her shoulders relax and she looks up very slowly. Harry prepares himself for the worst. But her eyes are closed and although she looks like Draco Malfoy, there is nothing strange about her. If Albus loves Malfoy's daughter, then it's fine by him. It's only fair, considering that he has managed to develop a sudden and annoying crush on the arrogant woman.
"Look-" Draco started and Harry cut him off "On the top of everything, you think that I do not deserve you." Harry snorted loudly because it was so bloody amusing. "I, who has not done anything but wallow in my misery for the past decade do not deserve you, the best potions Master after Severus Snape of the last fifty years. No one would believe this Draco. Complete Britain wants you to return. They would welcome you with open arms. And me." Harry chuckled before continuing "Had you not come back, I would still be lying in some dark alley, drunk and wasting my life. If it is anyone , it is me who doesn't deserve you. Ask Hermione or Ron. They will gladly tell you. In fact, they will thank you for getting rid of the innumerable alcoholic drinks that were strewn all over this house. You will never agree but I would never have been able to start my academy if you were not their."
Draco shook his head again when there eyes met and Harry bowed his head, mumbling, "I have apologised before and I apologise again."
"You are drunk enough for tonight." The man said in his usual lazy drawl. It was surprising to see how far they had come. Harry had met Blaise at a pub four years ago at the club he was standing in right now. Blaise was with a date. She was lean and short and very slim and a brunette with short hair. Harry was alone and was drowning himself in alcohol to avoid thinking about Draco, his husband, ex-husband, whatever. Technically, they weren't divorced but then they hadn't spoken to each other even once in the past four years.
It was so sad really. She sacrificed almost her entire childhood as well as youth in the name of saving them and this was what she had in the name of family. A bunch of perverts who were exploiting her or were watching her get exploited.
"Ummm, they thought you will be uncomfortable around them." Harry spoke after having a bite. Draco sighed "I am not uncomfortable as long as you are with me."
"I do not get a hug Sirius. I am your godson after all." Harry barked and Sirius spun around, probably alarmed at the tone of his voice. Draco shook his head and pursed his lips even as his fingers reached to scrub his neck and Harry breathed hard to control his own fury.
"That's the point. Our son is under a misconception that we are ashamed of him. He has not met us even once since we returned. Your parents are proud of the man you have become Draco. You are everything I ever wanted you to be, smart intelligent successful. Most importantly, we-" Father broke off and Harry dragged him by his hand towards the dais. He had been hiding from people and as soon as they saw him, they cleared the way for him.
"Then, far be it from me to stop you from doing what you want to. I am here if you require my assistance with anything." Came the soft reply and Harriet nods before walking out of the room. She really mustn't get late. Once out of the office, she starts running as fast as she can.
"I will if you don't keep your mouth shut," Harry warned. He should have known not to say anything to an eleven year old. Merlin, they romanticised everything.
She stares at him, tears streaming from her eyes again. He wants to cry too but he knows that he has to be strong, that he can't change the past. He knows that he can only help her get over this incident.
"Ginny, wait." He says suddenly and reaches for her small hands. They are warm and her fingers wrap around his.
"Look. He told us a bit of his past. The people he lived with were horrid and he will understand. It's not my story to tell but they really were horrible to him. He is a good man and powerful enough to help us and - and your mother."
Ginny hissed at him angrily, "Oh, yeah? Suddenly you are feeling mercy for them or perhaps you want to reconcile with Harry, eh?"
And then she laughed and laughed because it was just a matter of time that they would return. She had owled those letters to instigate Harry's wrath.
"No, I was not raped. I was never raped. It was consensual." Draco spoke and Harry's knees felt week.
"Harry." It's mom's voice. Albus looks behind dad to find her standing at the entryway with a frown and furrowed brows.
Of course, Severus nods just a second later before murmuring, "Of course, I'll take you. Of course."
"At what time should I return?" Harry asked and Draco whispered "In the evening. Eat dinner at Severus's".
Fred's eyebrows rose in shock and he looked at George "Did you get his letter George because we could have made an excellent use of his potions skills? I most certainly didn't."
"Incarcerous." Severus snarls and the dark lord slams on the wall, his hands and legs tied to either sides of his body.
" Sweet Merlin Draco. " He spoke sharply and when Draco tried to open his trouser button, he knew that he must stop this madness " Stop it Draco."
He dragged his chair inside and closed the door. With some difficulty, he placed himself on the bed because his legs hurt.
She passed Arthur's room. It was actually a classroom turned into a bedroom. Everyone was using students' bathrooms since prefects' bathrooms were still locked and refused to open. At least, that was what she had heard. She had tried in the morning and the prefects' bath had unlocked without any issues. It had taken a simple Alohomora. What puzzled her was that how its location got changed from the fifth floor to the second floor. But, it was nice to have a place she could retreat to - one where no-one would be able to enter so she hadn't told anyone, not even Hermione.
They were close and Draco just had to lean a bit to take Harry's lips in his. He wanted to kiss Harry so much. It seemed that an age had passed since they had kissed.
"They have a right to study here. Your forefathers studied here," Severus tries his best, knowing that it's useless. She has made her decision.
"She had accomplices Draco. We need to investigate their identities." Harry said and Draco shook his head "I don't want to know. I don't want revenge."
"Mr Malfoy-Potter, you are right. I am so-" Dudley started, an apology in his eyes and Draco stopped his speech with his raised palm. He heard Harry sigh behind him. But the mans stayed silent. they were completely different in this aspect. Harry was too forgiving and Draco did not forgive anyone, not so easily atleast.
"Are you sure?" Harry whispered and let Draco's head fall on his shoulders. "Yes." Draco replied and Harry looked at the trio first and then at Hermione and Ron.
"Hello, Harry and Ah! Hello Mr. -" Dudley spoke to him politely and turned to talk to Draco. Harry gaped. His jaw fell open in shock because Dudley had never spoken politely to anyone in his complete life except for the time when he had shaken Harry's hands.
"You apologised and you never apologise. You always become defensive." Draco replied and Harry shrugged "You were always right. I took you for granted and i would have helped you clean the house, had I been able to."
He heard a deep breath been taken and footsteps furiously walking towards his door. When he opened his eyes, he found Narcissa standing there "You need to know it. I think Draco's, ah, fate, after the trials is somehow connected to the secret Lucius has kept buried in his heart for more then three decades."
Another thing he noticed was that Draco was trying to- to bury himself in Harry's arms somehow. He stroked Draco's hair and asked "What happened? Had a nightmare?"
"Think about it Harry." Hermione says and she is completely serious. Her thoughtful eyes are gazing at him and he can't help but wonder if he can do that. He shakes his head to get the thought out and averts his eyes. This is not the first time they are asking this of him.
"My father died when you gave me away to him. Don't look at me. Don't meet me. Don't talk to me. Don't show your face to me." Draco screams at him, her voice hoarse.
"Yes." Snape says curtly. Harry doesn't say anything. He starts drawing random patterns on Snape's table. Snape will deny Harry's request. He despises Harry and will scold him mercilessly. Why Harry decided to seek this man's help is beyond him.
He hated crying. He hated being week but Harry always had this effect on him. Why did Harry not understand that Draco would never be the same, that he would never heal.
When he turned around, Draco was laid on the bed staring at him. He unbuttoned his pants and shrugged them off and his boxers followed his pants. He found himself stark naked in front of his very panicked husband and wanted to stop but realized that he had to wait for Draco to stop him.
The only mistake he did was to tell them off for harassing a couple of kids. His knee is already bleeding and his shirt is almost ruined beyond repair. His stomach is hurting from their punches. They really would have killed him if that car had not passed them by.
"Now, ask your questions Draco." He spoke and Draco sat beside him, putting forward his first question "Did you get my letter for giving me the job related to potions in your joke shop?"
Draco opened his mouth to speak and Harry did not let him speak at all "Don't tell me lies. I have seen the letter and the-" Harry breathed deeply and continued "the photos as well. Why did you do this and do not tell me lies. I want to hear the truth."
"Over the past year, I have come upon a decision Ms. Potter. I won't interfere in Severus's decisions. If he says that it's okay, then it is okay. I won't intervene unless you require me to. Severus won't take it kindly if I defy his decisions where you are concerned. He is already very disappointed over the fact that I let you live with Lily's sister. Disappointed is the wrong word I guess. He is still very furious over it and I don't think he is going to forgive me anytime soon." Headmaster finishes.
Finally, Draco came out of his stupor and nodded. Harry tapped Draco's nose lovingly with his and retreated to the bath again. He noticed that Draco did not move for several minutes.
It was Harry's presence that had infused confidence in him. Harry had promised him that he will be just a call away and he knew ample of magic which was uncomfortable but could protect Draco if needed even though he couldn't walk without moaning in pain yet.
"I forgive you." Harry said, his eyes somewhere ahead and he realized that he had in fact forgiven them for everything they did to him and perhaps he was like that, he was like his mother. His mother never held grudges. This he knew from what Severus had told him.
"Draco-" Lucius starts when his son stops because he would pause only for a moment before starting again. He's playing with blocks and when the doorbell rings, he stands up. Draco's a very active child and so of course, he runs to open the door. Lucius follows his son, shaking his head at the child's antics.
Three days had passed and Harry had done nothing except bathe, eat and look at Draco's unconscious face. He barely slept now and there were bags under his eyes. The elfs forced him to eat and so he did it. Everything seemed a chore. He wandered in his house alone. Multiple times, he found himself wishing for portraits to talk to. His silent house was eating him up and he found himself missing the banter he used to have with Draco back at Hogwarts when he would mock Draco and Draco would mock him back.
Mr. Zabini gapes at Albus. His jaw hangs open in shock. His eyes are wide and his entire frame has frozen.
"Harry. Calm down." Draco whispered and had he been the old Draco Malfoy, he would have shouted back but he knew that Harry was hiding humiliation and pain behind this anger. He knew that Harry would never display himself as week which was also the reason he was fighting with Draco. Harry lifted his hand to punch Draco again when Draco caught his fist "You can fight with me if it relaxes you."
But right now, he had to speak to Draco and request him to trust Harry. He walked towards Draco's room, the photos and letter clutched in his hand.
Draco breathed and his throat clenched as he looked at the woman. For just a moment, he could see Lily Potter in the woman and he could simply stare as she spoke her next words "I- we are sinners. I should have ensured that Harry had a happy childhood and god is punishing me for it. Dudley tortured his cousin and now he has to live with the fact that his won father tortured his daughter for god knows how many years. So you see, Mr. Malfoy-Potter, it is circle. As you sow, so shall you reap. Those who tried to destroy you, those who hurt you will be punished, just like my husband will be, at your hands. I just hope that you would find a family in me and Dudley as well, with time. It seems that you have already accepted Tessa. We will wait for that day."
Ron and the twins are doing a good job. They are holding his hands and the other Weasleys are there as well.
Draco sits up and leans against the couch before looking at the girl, "- and he disappeared right after he invented it. Isn't it strange?"
He kissed the scar and moved on to the faded whip marks that were on Draco's stomach and traced them.
" I know you are awake Harry. You can avoid talking to us all you want but I will be back and then we will talk to you and Draco about this. I have had enough." Hermione was relieved and angry at him.
Draco's breath hitched and he tried to push Harry away. Harry didn't move and held Draco's hands on his. "It is scarred... It is dirty." He spoke and Harry's heart clenched.
It is going to be a difficult day and he wishes that they come unscathed at the end of it and that they can finally get them imprisoned.
"Ron, all these years... I had been so mistaken. I had always thought that he was an asshole and that he was prejudiced towards us. I had never even imagined... He must have suffered a lot. We must visit him." Hermione got up, her voice breaking and Ron shook his head "He needs time, Hermione. We must wait for Harry to contact us."
"Sit down Harry. You are scaring the kid." Hermione snaps, "You are going to obsess over her and we are going to help. It's okay. We understand. It must have been such a pain to stay away from her for complete seventeen years."
"Why are you not eating anything?" She asked because Vernon's plate was empty. Even his cup was empty. She picked up the kettle. It had tea.
He frowned furiously and turned around to glare at him "What if you had got hurt? Why did you not call Kreacher?"
He slams the door open fully expecting a pacing or crying or glowering teenager standing in front of him. When he opens the door and a bucket full of water falls on his head, he is so astonished that he can barely stop himself from shrieking.
Finally, Draco nodded and unbuttoned his trousers with trembling hands. Harry wondered if Draco was expecting him to take his advantage. His heart burned from the thought. He would never abuse anyone, leave alone Draco this way. He loved Draco so much.
However, Harry is already standing up, "I told Ginny before she left for her detention. I'll see you later."
Stood at the entryway, Albus regards his graceful frame. He is a piece of art. Albus can stare at him for an entire lifetime. He has flawless skin and defined cheekbones. Albus wants to cup his cheeks and caress them and taste his full red lips and card his fingers through his soft blonde hair-
"You did?" Black whispers back, staring at Severus in surprise. Severus stares heavenward, wondering what pranks the child has in store for him.
It was weird, he had often thought. They would ask him for his consent and he would nod with utter pain in his eyes. Why did they never notice his helplessness? Is pleasuring yourself so important that you do not even think about the other person's sanity, of his dignity?
Draco grits his teeth, clenches his jaw and continues staring outside. He knows that he can't back off.
"I- I am ready. You are just making excuses. You do not want to touch me because I disgust you, because you know that I was a slut." Draco whispered and Harry looked at him with soft eyes.
On this note, Draco stood up and left Harry alone to his thoughts. Harry leaned on the table, his elbows resting on it and his hands covering his face. He closed his eyes to gather his thoughts. Draco would sleep in his own room and Harry was worried for him. It was not getting any better. Draco was curling upon itself.
"Did I ask you to take care of it? Did I? Why did you even offer it when you didn't want to? So you were experimenting. So what- I already knew it before I kissed you." He is almost yelling by this point.
Who said that pain was always physical? Draco's pain had never ceased. A decade had passed and Draco still had that haunted look in his eyes.
Five days later found Draco in the lab. The meeting with the delegates had been good. They did not recognise him and he did not recognise them. It was good and he explained the concept to them and gave the samples as well.
When Harry placed his hands on both of Draco's shoulders and dragged his face towards his own, Draco blinked hard to stop his tears.
He will bake for kids and have a nice dinner and not think about Draco Malfoy and her beautiful eyes.
"I liked the dress robes you chose for me, Harry." Draco spoke and Harry was surprised but he kept his eyes closed. He did not want to chase Draco away yet "But you said that my choice was bad."
Harry wrung the bell. The man who opened the door seemed nothing like Dudley Dursley he knew and if Harry had not foreknown that this was in fact the Dursley house, he would have sworn that he had entered the wrong place. The man who stood in front of him had a strong built and warm eyes. He was not fat, no. He was handsome, in fact and looked quite intelligent.
"Have I told you lately that I love you the most in this whole world?" Harry asked, wrapping his arms around Draco's chest and Draco sighed on Harry's shoulders "No."
"I'm sorry." Harry says and students start milling in the corridor, heading towards their classrooms. The first person Harry sees is Draco. His stride is graceful and his face is blank. He looks the epitome of elegance and grace. It's close to impossible to know what he's really thinking.
It was not sex that Draco wanted. It was difficult to express it in words and Harry understood it now, though he had never understood it in the past.
Scorpius studies Zabini carefully. He mightn't remember everything but he remembers many things. Father had tried to hide his job from him. All he knew was that it wasn't a respectable job and that father was very unhappy. Uncle Harry was a very stern man. They were supposed to address him as sir and were scolded if they forgot. He was the very definition of an arrogant snob.
Harry was looking at him, as if expecting something. Draco just muttered "Go to sleep, Harry." After helping Harry on his bed.
"I am happy Harry. Happy and avenged. They will lead the rest of their pathetic lives in Azkaban and I want to really live now, heal and live with you." He murmurs and kisses Harry's lips right in front of the Weaslette. She shrieks and he kisses Harry again, his eyes gleaming with mischief.
He could see that Draco was swallowing and that his eyes flitted behind him, as if someone is watching him.
As much as he tries to appear confident and arrogant, Scorpius knows that James isn't really very confident and he only knows that because he has spent a long time in studying Mr. Potter.
"Harry, you are being rude. She would be-" Draco started and Hermione cut off "Sorry for interfering but I understand. It's all right. I am under the healer's oath. I cannot hurt you. Do not worry please." She was being surprisingly understanding and Harry wondered if she had deduced some things that he hadn't. Hermione had always been perceptive.
house, he had sought Severus out and had completed his internship under him. He had become a potions master.
"I want to murder him. I will never be able to live in peace unless I punish the bastards who hurt us. Giving up is not in my nature Draco. I cannot forgive them. I need to punish them. When you entered my life, I had decided to forget my childhood. After all, I was never raped. I had lived in constant fear in that house but had managed to protect myself somehow. I simply can't forget it Draco. I have to punish them. I hate them so much."
"Honestly, Hermione. You should calm down a bit. You are being over obsessive. It won't do you any good and Harry would be irritated by this." He snapped at her and she snapped right back "It won't stop me from advising Harry."
"Uncle Severus." Says Harry in a small voice. Severus doesn't open his eyes and Harry wraps his fingers around Severus's forearm right over the dark mark and Severus knows what he's going to ask him.
Lucius just blinked at his wife who had tears in her eyes and murmured "I need to tell him that I am proud of him Narcissa. I do."
Scorpius only rolls his silver eyes and turns them away from Albus, "I don't want to meet your mother."
Petunia was five years older than Lily. Lily wasn't supposed to die before her. Petunia was supposed to beg for her forgiveness and Lily was supposed to be difficult before finally forgiving her and then they were supposed to celebrate the rest of their Christmases together. Petunia was supposed to give Lily, all the gifts that she had purchased for her and never given. She wasn't supposed to die so young.
"I see," he said, "Maybe, I was being needlessly paranoid," and unconsciously took a step closer to her. In just a matter of seconds, he felt the tip of her wand digging on his neck. He stared at her, stunned speechless. She glared at him.
She shoots up at his words, her mouth open and her eyes wide and frightened. He backs off to maintain a distance from her and stays silent. He doesn't move at all. He ensures not to even blink because he knows that any movement will scare her off.
"Whatever you want, head auror Black." The man said and Draco stared, stunned. The answer was shocking because since when did Potter agree to anything without an argument. He crossed his arms and met Black's eyes. That Potter didn't call his godfather by his given name didn't escape Draco's notice.
Harry still stayed silent and sat on his other side very silently. As expected, Granger who had also been sitting beside him whispered in a voice that could barely conceal her tears "You were ra- raped."
"No one dies, Harry. Some day you will move on." Draco stopped because it was impossible to do this. He wanted Harry so desperately. Nevertheless, he continued "You will move on and will find someone who will make you happy. I will never heal. I will always be insecure and over possessive and I don't want to cage you. You deserve better than me."
She was breathing hard and he was not faring well himself. On the one hand, he was angry at Vernon Dursley and on the other hand, his own past was haunting him. So many times, he had been caught off guard. Some of his regular clients used to just barge inside his room sometimes and he had no other option other than entertaining them. He couldn't throw them out and risk losing his clients.
"Hello, Harry" Fred muttered and as usual George continued "How are you?" while Neville muttered "I think that we must talk. We are already having this discussion ten years late."
He nodded and took it in his "Yes. We will punish him and take you somewhere you would have exposure to magic. Next year you would be able to go to Hogwarts. It is a school where you learn magic."
"What does he bloody think of himself? How dare he just enter our bath like this? " Draco muttered to himself and Harry was not sure as to how he should react. If he supported Ron, Draco would be angry and if he didn't Draco would really hurt Ron.
The last sentence relieved Harry. This meant that Draco would stay in his room. Atleast Draco would try and that was enough for now.
He did not know what Draco was going through. He understood a bit but how could he understand everything if Draco did not speak a word. He knew that Draco did not speak to him about it because he thought that Harry would not be able to listen to it and yes to a certain extent he was right.
An owl was tapping on it and it seemed to be the same owl. He looked at it suspiciously and walked towards the said window to let the owl in.
His response is quick. He nods his head and murmurs, "Of course, you will if that's what you want. Please calm down. No-one is going to force anything on you."
"We came to meet you, Draco." Mother replied and Draco couldn't bear to look at her. He had almost forgotten Granger's presence. Almost. She made herself known by a simply whispered sentence "I hate to interrupt this but I really do need to speak to you, Draco." Draco looked at her with narrowed eyes. How dare she? Always interfering. Bloody nosy woman! Weasley and Granger had been one of the several causes of Draco's quarrels with Harry.
"SIGN THEM." Draco ordered and Harry grabbed the papers and tore them into half. Draco just stared in shock, his hand hanging in the air. Harry tore the two pieces into four parts and then made their eight parts and then sixteen and then threw the papers in the fireplace.
It's quite dark but her silver gaze is fixed on him. Her face is expressionless. She doesn't trust him which is quite understandable.
Inside the bath, he washed his face and brushed his teeth wondering about Draco’s sudden mood changes.
Harry experimentally parted Draco's hips and placed his fingers on his anus and suddenly Draco started shaking.
Hermione was alarmed and so was Ron and he knew that they were waiting. Finally, Hermione's patience wore thin and she asked softly "We can just leave if you need time Draco. You must not force yourself." Ron agreed with her murmuring "Draco, we can meet them after a few days. They just wish you well. They would hate it if you hurt yourself any more." Hermione held Harry's hand and Harry's thundering heart calmed down a bit.
Harry did not answer and Draco knew that he would feel cold in boxers so he sighed "Okay. Then you will have to manage in these clothes for an hour. I will get a pair cleaned by Kreacher."
Mr. Zabini suddenly tips his head and laughs hard before sneering, "As entertaining as this visit was, I won't involve myself in this madness
"I WON'T." Harry shouted again, his anger spiking and Draco ordered loudly "SIGN THEM, POTTER. SIGN THEM IMMEDIATELY."
Draco did not understand anything. He didn't understand this version of Potter who was donning heavy gowns that looked pretty but out of place on her, seeming like someone had forced her to wear them or Ronald who was ignoring the fact that his best friend was probably - unhappy with being groped or this Granger who was ignoring both of her best friends.
He tries to concentrate on her face because she is looking too beautiful and he has wanted her for such a long time.
"HARRY. IT IS A NIGHTMARE. GET UP." Draco shouted and shook his shoulders and Harry's eyes shot open.
His question is answered by Snape who slumps on a chair in front of Harry before murmuring, "She is at the the Riddle Manor. The dark Lord threatened Lucius with death in case he doesn't take Draco to him so Lucius left her at the dark lord's manor."
At this, Ron stopped to think. He did not understand why Draco always glared at him. He sympathised with him and wanted Harry and him together. He had always supported them.
The moment they appeared in their room, Harry noticed it. Draco had been putting an act in front of Sirius. Draco dragged Harry to the nearest wall and all but slumped in his arms.
He tried to think about mundane things, things like Black had shoulder length hair and a scar underneath his right year. Absently, he wondered why Black never got it removed.
Sirius was the only source of information they had right now. Ginny would just get Sirius murdered and the flee away if she realized that Harry could get him to spill everything. He couldn't be rash. He needed evidence to finish them off. Rest assured, once he has secured enough evidence, they would regret the day they decided to destroy Draco's life.
He closed his eyes to sleep but couldn't sleep well, in spite of Draco's warm presence in his arms. He would have to convince Draco to sleep with him somehow and he would also have to convince Draco to talk to him.
Draco swallowed and nodded slowly. Harry continued, his eyes firm and adamant "Let's sleep. We will get up and I will make noodles for you and you can tell me things if you feel comfortable. Just know that I won't rest unless he or people who have hurt you have been punished."
Lucius was about to speak something when he felt a tug at his robes. He looked down and found an eight year old girl in front of him in a very pretty pink colored dress. She smiled and he couldn't help but smile back.
Meanwhile, Ron continues, "I will have you know that none of the Weasleys or our extended family hate Scorpia or even Malfoy. We forgave her when Harry spoke to us about his reasons for speaking in her favor at the trials."
"Yes, my son." Narcissa spoke. She was standing beside Lucius now. "Do not think that your parents have led a loveless life. I love your father and I always have and I always will. You don't have to be conscious in front of us. Harry is a lot like Lily. Isn't he Severus?"
Harry did not defend himself because he wanted Draco to know that Hermione cared for him and that she was not his enemy. Hermione parted Draco's hips gently and turned white in just a couple of seconds. What happened was not unexpected. Hermione turned towards him with fury in her eyes. He had not seen her look like this ever since the battle.
She picks Potter's hand and places it on her head before starting, "So, I will tell you about the diary now...
"That's head auror Malfoy for you, Potter," Draco snapped back at her. Couldn't she behave decently for just a moment. He was trying to help her.
She is terrified of him. He is hideous. He is a monster, a beast. He is an animal... actually even animals have mercy in them but he has none and her father left her with
A moment later, he murmurs, "I could just send them away. You could just tell me if you want. No need to tell everyone just yet."
Harry did just that. He breathed and replied softly, looking into his eyes, his green eyes a bit sad, "I know. So am I. Let's go."
"Ah! He's in his room. First room on the first floor. You can take your friend with you." Vernon answers on her behalf and Harry runs out of the room. The other child follows him.
Harriet looked around the large staff room with cool eyes. The kids weren't there, unless they were hidden under the cloak somewhere which was okay if they were together. She trusted James and Teddy to take care of the lot of them. She wanted them to have a normal childhood. She wanted them to have a chance to be children and make mischief.
"I'm afraid I don't have an answer yet," Dumbledore said, his face completely blank. Harriet wondered if he was lying. It won't be the first time. She turned her face to look at the twins. Fred was quite red, his both hands under the table whereas George's face was very white. His right hand was under the table. They looked at her and their eyes grew really furious before they became wide and they pinched their lips together. Zabini's face was so blank that anyone else would think that the twins were just not feeling well. Harriet turned back towards Dumbledore, knowing that this would not really stop them from harassing her. But, it was amusing as well as satisfying to see them suffer.
Severus knows what's going to happen a second before it does. Harry's eyes become huge and sparkle. Yes they sparkle and he sticks his lower lip out and then crosses his arms before saying, "But mom wrote me a letter. I showed it to you. She wants me to give all those things to her and she wants me to give that toy wand to Dudley."
