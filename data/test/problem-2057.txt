Everything turned around
“You owe me. A lot.”
“Apparently she’s also spending quite a bit of time in the headmaster’s quarters. With both of them.”
“Oh, right. I’ll, er,” he knew he had the number for the front desk somewhere, “I’ll call down, shall I?”
Longbottom - and who knew he’d be headmaster, but he seemed to be good at it - had firecalled him around 10:00 at night. He’d been going over his investment portfolio - and his former housemates were doing very well, Pans with her estates, Greg with the Belgian chocolates, Blaise rolling in galleons since he figured out the charms for those muggle music devices - and had just changed into his dressing gown. Hoping to get a good night’s sleep; praying that he wouldn’t dream about -
Harry glanced at his watch. Just a few minutes more. He tensed his shoulders and shook his head and then thumped it down onto the table.
He did.
Draco didn’t look at him, just kept his eyes staring at the bottom of the tub, and his voice was quiet but firm.
(And don’t spend too much time alone, maybe you should get a best friend like Al)”
Harry started to move his hand forward. Just a little, just to see if -
He tried to imagine a life without Lucius. Without the cane, and the black cellar. Without the Dark Lord, and without the snake. A life where he’d gotten to know Andie before she was an old woman, and his cousin Dora before she had died.
He was suddenly, blissfully numb.
“Pansy!” she rolled her eyes at him, “Ugh, alright,” he mumbled under his breath, “The fucking best. Christ, his cock -”
“So.”
“I care for you, Draco. So you must make me proud.”
And then a door creaking open as the woman in question stepped out - in a rather too clingy nightdress - from what he’d thought was an empty closet. His heart thumped, missing a beat.
Potter stepped out from behind the column. Draco turned - oh sweet Merlin, Potter was struggling to zip his jeans, and he was covered in come, and yet he looked so earnest, how did he manage?
“Hey,” Harry’s voice, soft and tentative, “This the place?”
He nearly came from Potter’s gravelly voice, and that wouldn’t do, so he bit Potter again, and spoke in low tones -
Pouring himself into that heat, every inch of him, and how was it possible with that slender body with the silvery scars and the blackened tattoo and God, no one told him it could feel like this -

“You will not hurt him,” she paused as he shook his head, “Again.”
Harry lifted one of Draco’s legs, planting his foot on the mattress, then the other.
Harry reached over, grabbed the waggling hand, held it.
Nev had set up a private room - not, he was relieved to find, his personal chambers - with a light lunch and a view out over the lake. Ginny was already there, of course, and he gave her shoulder a little squeeze as they sat on squashy chairs by the fire.
Like magic.
Thom looked all too delighted, “No objections from me.”
“It’s okay, Harry,” and she reached out her hand, and folded her fingers around his own, “I’ve made my peace with it.”
Some part of you - the jagged parts -
Harry took his hand off the glass so he could reach down and -
Signed, Ginny W, with a messy sketch of a heart.
"Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
“Draco,” his mother stood in the door.
When he saw Malfoy back at Hogwarts, he tried to find some - some connection, some echo of the boy who threw things and gulped firewhiskey and said thank you.
Oh Morgana, he was screwed.
“We weren’t -” from Scorpius, and, “Scorp, we obviously were, so bugger off, Dad,” from Al.
“Will you -”
“Thanks.”
“I just,” he scooched back, sitting with his back against the headboard, “It feels like a lot of... baggage. History for us to live with.”

Or I'll never give my heart
He pulled out his pack and lit a cigarette. Didn’t offer one.
He had promised himself. When Harry left - and then when Lucius died, and when he decided to come back to the manor and start a family - Draco had promised himself that he wouldn’t let it hurt, anymore. He’d see Potter’s face in the paper, hear his name on the wireless, and sure, he’d have a drink, maybe remember a thing or two, but he wouldn’t let it -
And this old world is a new world

He didn’t know that on all of those days, Harry was thinking about him.
It had been 11 months since he’d last kissed Harry.
Harry barked a laugh, then covered his mouth in embarrassment.
“Just. Be careful, Harry.”
It was a lie, but a necessary one.

“It would be better, of course, with champagne.”
“I’m - I’m going to talk, a little, and if I say anything you don’t like, tell me to stop.”
I'm in tears again
“Of course. Now get off me, I’m boiling.”
They’d never talked about her.
He tried not to laugh. Took the tiny hand. Shook firmly.
The chirping of birds and the way he rolled his eyes and muttered, “Fucking Cathal.”
“And I - oh goddess - don’t believe you.”
Living in a high-end flat was… not bad.
"I'm a creep
But from the moment Jamie had been placed in his arms - all ten pounds and fourteen ounces of him, because he’d inherited some of the strapping Weasley size, and Morgana bless Ginny for pushing him out - he felt something deep within him unclench. He’d never known love like this.
(I'll try)
Harry laughed, wetly, and thwapped him.
He brought Draco coffee every morning for a week and a day.
“Get those, would you?” she said, over her shoulder, as she came to embrace Draco.
“Oh,” he smiled, slow and sweet and shy, “Yeah, alright.”
Harry squinted at Pans.
“In lingerie,” he looked both disgusted and delighted at what he felt was scandalous gossip.
Harry frowned.
“Well, er. Yeah. So -”
Like this wasn’t his fault.
“Albus, come on out, would you?”
Draco’s voice, very still, as sharp and deadly as a scalpal - “Can’t bear to be queer, can you?”
“Why?”
“And then think of me.”
And Draco Malfoy dropped to the floor.
The barista looked over at him and gave him a saucy wink.
“Yes, you so obviously care about the rug,” she lifted an eyebrow, gesturing to the destruction around them.
“Name’s Thom,” he grinned. He was rather handsome, in his own way. Draco could not care less.
He laughed, shut the door behind him, listening to Draco’s muttering.
He leaned his head back, and Draco looked down at him, both of them wet and messy, and he kissed him then, one more time, and it was sweet.
"We like dancing and we look divine
In between bites, he said, “That’s what I mean, then. And, my darling wife,” she blushed, “You weren’t always so pleasant, yourself. So we were -”
“My hus-” she rolled her eyes, “Harry Potter is many wonderful things. A great Dad, a good Auror, all that. But I know, better than most, that he can be a selfish prick.”
“Your wife -”
“Again, please.”
“Good enough?”
“Mm. Under your invisibility cloak, no less. Thanks ever so for sending that along with dear Albus Severus.”
No, no. Please, he thought, this was not - not what I was looking for.
August was nearing its end.
“I’m sorry, Malfoy - Draco -” Ginny reached out and caught his wrist, “Look…”
“Yes, I really do.”
“I fucked him.”
“I feel old.”

Responsibility.
Longbottom shifted, with maybe a hint of guilt.
He scratched at the back of his head, wondering where this conversation was going and how soon he’d be able to put the kettle on.
“You alright, Potter? Did you drink too much?”
And a master suite, also fully furnished, with a huge four poster bed and rich green linens.
The flannel was buttery-soft, sliding down his arse, catching on his damp prick. Sweat beaded between his shoulder blades. He felt slender fingers and sharp nails against his skin, spreading him.
He had been right about Cork coming alive at night. Young people spilled out of every doorway, it seemed - university aged men with cigarettes hanging at the corners of their mouths, the women with them in neon high heels and shockingly short skirts. It was loud and jarring and rich with scents, cologne, sweat, bright red geraniums, clove and hashish. And no one seemed to know him, as he ducked through crowds and kept his eyes wide open. He was just another kid, out on a Saturday night, not wonderful, remarkable, cursed, coveted.
And now he stood, regarding himself in his too-tight clothes, debating his next steps.
He didn’t need to be told twice.
He was back in the manor.
As he crossed the street and ducked back into the club, he thought about that image - Potter, biting his lips to keep quiet, his pulsing prick in hand, wet from both of them, his head thrown back - and didn’t know if he hoped he’d show up tomorrow or prayed that he wouldn’t.
“I’ve never been brave, Mum.”
He made a show of looking around the room.
“What?” His voice cracked, almost desperate.
Angry was good. He understood anger; anger at Malfoy was an old friend.
“Are you trying to confess or something?”
“Shut up for a minute, will you?”
“I know it’s rather more than you’re used to, Potter. But it’s one of the safest buildings in London. More security than the Ministry.”
This time he intended to keep him.
Her eyes softened.
“Yeah, no, I don’t have anything lined up yet.”
The towels were fluffier, somehow, and the dark of the night was more profound, and they were slick with oil, and Harry laid Draco out on the duvet, face against the pillows, drew his hips up and back -
The lovers that went wrong"
“Isn’t this a bit -”
He grit his teeth. Fuck that.
Watching Potter as he came was like hearing a symphony, all these little parts, little painful broken things, coalescing until he was too beautiful, too suspended in time, and the wetness on their fingers as they nearly held hands was like a benediction, and when Draco came like he’d never come before he thought, Jesus Mary and Joseph, I could love this man.
He jumped back at Draco’s clinical tone.
Draco’s face was tight - teasing, but not.
“Oh?”
She stood, facing him, and with uncharacteristic tenderness took his face in her hands.
He took a breath.
“I think you didn’t notice, when we were looking at the flat, the way Potter looked at you.”
“What?”
“Get on, yeah - I’m pretty sure Al thinks the world revolves around Scorp.”
“D’you wanna go dancing?”
“Have you -”
“Draco,” he nearly cried out, but maybe it was more like a whimper, “Please, fuck me.”
“You get turned on by baths?”
And he didn’t know when wanting him bruised and bloody on the floor changed into - into the other thing, the shameful thing, the thing that kept him up at night. But it seemed like it happened all at once, naturally, like water breaking through a dam to revert to its natural course. And then he couldn’t think of Potter without imagining what it would feel like - to have him under him and in him, to hold his hands down, to pull him into dark corners, to have him whisper, please.
He was beautiful.
Now on to the next.
That the pain down in your soul was the same
He looked down at her, surprised. She shrugged, and then he shrugged back.
“Al spotted me,” she crossed her arms, then in a mumble, “Kissing Nev.”
“Hello to you too,” she glared at him, “And just a couple of biscuits!”
“How did you know? How could you tell that your precious, pathetic, only heir would be,” he gestured wildly at himself, “Like this? Useless, idiotic - never good enough - a fucking catamite to Harry fucking Potter -”
Cause you had blood on your face
War was everywhere. It was eternal.
“This is something you had to do now, when you should have been in bed?”
His heart pounded too hard.
Ran away.
He heard whispering in the hall. He tilted his head at Gin, who shrugged, and he walked over towards the door.
“But you’re not a hero, Potter, and I’m not going to be the victim of your mastubatory manipulations, not anymore. You can fuck right off for all I care.”
“See Potter, a little luxury never hurt anyone.”
Draco as he clenched, sucking him in further, giving a broken cry, his whole body jerking as he came between them, and holy fuck, it was so hot, Draco’s come wet on their stomachs, and the tender fucked and fucked up gaze, and Harry coming with such excruciating pleasure that it was exquisitely painful.
Author's note:
“What?!”
He couldn’t remember, later, if he’d nodded, but he would always remember the whimper which was unmistakable for, “yes, please, fuck.”
“I’ll have you know that you had nothing to do with that,” he shifted, lifting his head and grumbling.
He sighed.
“Hello, Potter.”
He wanted to die.
Fuck. He punched the cushion under him, not really awake yet but still worrying.
Who cares, he thought, and who the hell needed him in the first place?
“A couple! I had two dozen here," a frown, "And now?”
“You’re going to be alright,” she said, with a reasonable amount of conviction.
“That is not a valid career path.”
“Fuck yes.”
Harry’s heart beat hard and fast.
It should have been cold, but it was fully furnished with thick rugs and plush couches, a real fireplace, open bookshelves with recessed lighting, everything seeming soft and cozy and perfect for long afternoons with endless hot cups of coffee.
He laughed, quietly.
“You can’t do it, can you? Telling me you’re here to beg - to beg me to -” his voice broke off, thick, “And you can’t. Just another fucking lie.” He threw his cigarette across the room.
“Draco, I was a coward, and I did run away, and it -” just touching him like this, just being close, was so beautiful, like everything he’d ever wanted and everything he’d ever lost.
“Put your hands on the glass.”
He thought about the carefully scheduled - by Hermione - portkeys, the reserved - by an American Auror friend of Kingsley’s - bedsit, the folded - again by Hermione - new clothes in his case. Even going to Las Vegas was something that Seamus had suggested, and Harry had just… agreed.
Yeah. He’d spotted Malfoy earlier, there with his wife - well, his ex-wife, and that was the problem, wasn’t it? - and with a tiny Malfoy with all of the icy looks of his father but with a big, toothy grin. He had tried, in that moment, not to think anything at all.
“I didn’t think that you would think so.”
“Totally,” Harry slid a finger in, “Completely,” he flicked against Draco’s prostate, “Without a doubt. Flip over.”
“Come on, Harry. You can’t tell me that you’re not looking forward to climbing a certain blonde bastard like a tree as soon as possible.”
“Draco,” he looked up, “I am not disappointed. But I am sad, for your sake.”
He felt Harry’s shoulders shake, once, like the beginning of a sob.
The sun rose. The first sunrise they shared.
Hermione laughed.
Harry had, in fact, owled him. Asking for Pans’s name. And now he was stuck, because he was too fucking weak to shut Harry down and bury him for good.
Malfoy was turning towards him.
“But - oh, fuck - you can keep doing that, if you like.”
I don't belong here"
“No,” he mumbled, rubbing his face, “But aren’t you - aren’t you even a little bit worried?”
“I’m sorry, I... Oh, what the hell,” he lit the cigarette, breathed in, got instantly buzzed, “I’d forgotten how disgusting and bloody wonderful these things are. Let’s not tell our children about this, alright?”
He didn’t want to have to do that any more.
“I don’t think -”
“It was the only way you could imagine yourself being worth loving.”
“Yeah, yeah.”
“You wanted to what?”
He was still too thin and too pale, but his anger was comforting in its familiarity. Various odds and ends were flying through the air - not because of magic, but because of Draco’s forceful right arm. It was violent, and kind of fun to watch. And it was a little bit beautiful, too, beautiful like some wild beast in a cage, like something feral.
“Do you trust me?”
He tried not to feel like it was empty.
“You know what I want.”
“Hmm.”
Al ruffled his hair - almost as messy as his dad’s - and pursed his lips, thinking.
He couldn’t stay in here.
“Pans…”
Draco held his breath.
Harry Potter had always wanted Draco Malfoy.
He looked up at Malfoy and felt like he’d been hit by a perfectly executed Confundus.
“Ugh,” she swallowed, disgusted, “I don’t know how you drink this muggle stuff.”
“Your child is a menace.”
He felt a stiffness against his arse - a more respectable size, there, than whatever was in the other man’s trousers - and he arched back, turning his head and shout-whispering.
“I mean, you know I go there to get my clothes and stuff.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well. Rebellion-free.”
“Go, be an Auror, whatever. Marry Ginevra, stick your prick in her, fake being... have her pop out a brood of red-headed brats. Just know that this time, the only person who’s forcing you into the cupboard is you. And that you’re locking everyone else in that cupboard with you.”
A week goes by before Poppy Petal lets him off his strange form of medical probation.
If Harry squints, he can sort of make out what appears to be two figures on the roof. As he strategizes how to dodge the incoming attack from the horse and the flock of flying demons, he nudges Ron. “The roof!”
“Sorry. Can’t help that if I don’t know it’s coming.”
As the haze thins out, Harry remembers the communicator sitting in his trousers pocket.
we’ve hurt each other before that I knew. I’ve seen the worst of you, Harry—dragged it out of you, even. Just as you’ve seen the worst from me. And I know you’ll punch, kick, insult, hex a person—but you’d never choose to do something like

is right. We’d all quite like to know what you hoped to accomplish yesterday.”
“Dunno.”
A flush rises up Justin’s neck. “Ha, yeah, well. It wasn’t really a good enough one to justify trying out hero work.”
“Kreacher has been buying me... Blood Replenishing Potion.”
Shifting his head beneath the spray, he hears crackles as the remnants of electrical static leaves his hair. Now when it dries, it’ll fall back into its natural tightly curled state instead of looking like an afro. It’s been happening as long as he can remember being able to power up. The electricity loosening his hair enough to separate it and make it stand on end works wonders for hiding his civilian identity.
Dracon’s head perks up as Harry comes to stand before him. “I figured out you’re not Blaise.”
Potter snorts, and Draco fights to keep his pleasant smile on his face.
Draco takes another step forward, and they’re suddenly so close! With hesitant and halting movements, Draco leans his head down to Harry’s upturned, masked face. He hovers just before his lips touch the cheek of the dragon skull mask, waiting for Harry to pull away.
Hermione sputters for a moment. “The usage of special outfits during the plague is plenty interesting!”
However, when Dracon makes a choking noise and collapses to the floor, Harry bolts back to his feet.
Then he takes that same sparking hand, and has it hover just above Draco’s cheek. “I’m going to power down.”
“Close for villains, then?” Hermione amends.
He chews on his lips while he thinks. “Probably down in that creepy lab they have. Down in their cellar.”
Ron shakes his fork at Harry. “Then you should’ve left him to his own business, mate.”
They owl a bit back and forth before agreeing to meet at Grimmauld the day Draco goes to visit the first victim on the list.
“—erations, mind you—that’s a nice playground for my cats?” Mrs. Figg’s foot taps as she watches him.
-ove you both. You know that?”
“Er, sorry about that.”
As the group enters, Harry finds it’s not hard to spot the new evidence as it lies on the center table as though awaiting dissection.
“You have a problem with bringing him in for interrogation, but no problem with knocking him out to tend to his injuries?”
“And where am I gonna get it? You?”
She eyes him warily; his mask isn’t probably doing him any favors.
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure.”
“Sure,” Harry says unsteadily.
The world starts to shimmer before him, and the ground beneath his feet seems distorted.
When he’d woken up an hour before noon, his breakfast and a note had been waiting for him in the kitchen. The note inscribed with Hermione’s handwriting claimed she and Ron had left for The British Library, but that Ron had made him breakfast. Beneath Hermione’s signature, in Ron’s scrawl, was a post-script that told Harry Hermione'd brought up the topic of the bookstore again. He said he’d agreed and mentioned Harry’s tentative agreement the night before.
Harry pats at her back.
Part of what grates on Harry about his interactions with constabulary while wearing his suit—a clear indicator to all who see him of his hero status—is the disregard and dismissal his law enforcement counterparts display for him. Although, he knows run-ins could turn much worse.
“Ah, but that’s where I got her, Ron.” Harry briefly paused in his job as Professional Pacer and Fretter. “Once the question was asked, Hermione
“Most of ‘em tend to be loner-types. Lonely enough that they latch onto me. And what can I say? I have quite the comforting presence. So really, they pick me, you know.”
“Oh, all right!” Draco bursts out. “T’was t’help you. And it really
“Oh, please lay back down! You’re still recovering!”
He counts the keys until he finds the right one and stuffs it in the door. “Now remember, we want to find out what this gentleman knows. So, no letting emotions cloud our judgment.”
“Oh! I’m so happy to hear you’ve found my boat! Yes, yes. Do come in, dear. You’re getting snowed on standing out there like that.”
“Er, I don’t know if that’s actually the case. While Blaizing Fire might have given us the rendezvous point for him and Paper Dracon, I still don’t know how to characterize their relationship,” Harry says. “I mean, Dracon continued looking for him even after he didn’t show up at the exact location—which Dracon himself admitted being a mistake after I caught him.”
“Er, the villain being interrogated.”
.....................
“I—I—” He wipes his forehead and cheeks with his robe sleeve, a flush rising to his cheeks.
Finch-Fletchley hesitates. “From here on out, my memory’s a bit fuzzy.”
And Draco’s suddenly not drunk enough for this conversation, but his luck’s run out alongside the Firewhiskey in his bottle. “’Whyyy’?”
~~*~~
She nods.
“Yeah.”
It’s faded and hazy around the edges in comparison to Draco’s sharply focused one peering over Potter’s shoulder, but it’s there. From the bright green eyes to the jagged lightning scar, the unkempt black hair to the round glasses, it’s Potter. Even with the grey-tinged skin and hollowed cheeks—softened by the lighting and the evening among friends—it’s Potter.
Taking a deep breath, Harry removes the arm covering his face. His green eyes connect with Fire’s deep brown ones, and Harry notices the smirk he wears. Movement out of his periphery draws Harry’s attention to where Blaizing Fire is removing his black trousers.
The MP hesitates. “I-I don’t know. It was chaos in there the second they struck. Everyone just dashed for the exits.”
Harry takes it as a
Harry’s thoughts go blank.
“But what about—” One of the villains starts to say. It may be GarGoyle.
“So . . . you convinced him?” Ginny at least seems to be taking it a bit better. Though, it may also be that she’s currently too baffled by the situation to have energy to spare to be upset.
? Both are more than four syllables; I already had some people trying to shorten
Unsurprisingly, Harry and Draco’s fists closed over the Snitch at the same time, their fingers sliding together in an awkward embrace. Their combined momentum from opposite directions sent them spinning like a merry-go-round with their joint hands acting as the grounding point for motion.
He’s taken to carrying an unburdensome first-aid kit with him on his patrols, the handle sliding nicely through his belt loop and the box tapping lightly at his thigh. The extra amount of care he can now provide endears him faster to the people he helps. Turns out gauze and bandages go a long way.
“No, I—” Both Harry and Draco gave startled cries as a blinding light emanated from Draco’s chest cavity. “What in Merlin’s name?”
“Let me in to see him.
“Eh, sounds like you’re making excuses to m—”
“Ah,” Alpha Bee says. “While your concern is a genuine and valid one, we’ve already established we won’t be getting too far if we try to rush things there. We should focus on what’s in front of us.”
Likewise, a painful sensation started in his naval, a calling for his astral form to return to his body.
Three minutes after Harry has pulled the last victim from the burning complex, the police and paramedics show up.
With care, Harry turns around, studiously keeping his gaze averted from Paper Dracon pinned to the far wall.
Approximately a week later, Harry stands outside a Waterstones Bookstore in the heart of London alongside Ron, Hermione, and a long line of strangers. Brisk air cuts through the crowd, and clouds form an overcast sky.
Harry wonders. “Think you’d be rid of me that easily, do you?”
“Don’t beat yourself up too hard, mate. After all, everything’s better in hindsight.”
“But you didn’t specify
Carefully, he moves his right hand into the box and takes out one of the little bits. Feeling it between his thumb and pointer finger, he confirms that the material is paper.
But seeing the way Draco’s eyes jumped from one area of the garden to the next, the way his glow kept fading in and out, Harry doubted that it was Ron or him who should fear this place. He placed a hand on his best friend’s arm. “Ron, it’s fine. He’s done something like this before, I think. Remember? He didn’t die at my flat.”
Sitting bolt upright with a gasp—a move that severely agitates his head injury—Harry’s hands fly to his face. The tension leaves his back and shoulders upon finding his mask still in place.
to answer it. My perfect trap.”
She looks down at her shoes. “For my Kevin?” She shifts her gaze to Harry’s mask. “Yes.”
As Harry feels his power igniting in the scar on his forehead and spreading down across his face and sparking in his hair, he studies Dracon for his reaction.
He helps Paper Dracon re-find his balance, and, since both of them are already at the point of stumbling around, Harry lifts Dracon’s arm and pulls it across his shoulders.
“No wonder it looks like you were mauled by Killer Croc. Should be grateful ghosts don’t carry smells, because the
Now that Harry has his hands free, he takes up the roll of bandage and starts below the injury and works his way up. As he wraps the sticks in place, he debates asking where this injury came from. Thinking back on the night he found Dracon wounded in the ditch, Harry is pretty certain a broken leg wasn’t part of what was wrong.
Harry swallows. “Were you badly injured then?”
In his other hand, Dracon grips his dragon skull mask, black shirt, and black dress trousers. “As long as we don’t attack or threaten that thing, it won’t throw actual attacks at us.”
“What’s . . .
The following weeks became a swirling storm of chaos that left little time to visit Draco on Manor grounds. Alongside the announcement of Draco’s death—the brutal details kept from the prying press—came the manhunt for Draco’s killers. Sure, the Ministry had been searching for the three Death Eaters in question before, but just as part of a long list of Death Eaters unaccounted for after the War. Now, though, they had evidence that these outlaws not only lived but still posed a danger to the citizenry.
standing right beside the door to the interrogation room. As he walks closer, he catches bits of their conversation.
“I was mistaken. Or at least exaggerated it a little.” He looks down again while his right hand rubs at the back of his neck. “The vampire—it only really grazed me. So it’s not—that’s not really an
For a few seconds, she and the other heroes just stand there and stare at the escape route made for them all. They seem caught unaware—as though up to this moment, their escape from the Villain Agency’s dungeons hadn’t felt real. Yet, the sight of the night peeking its way into the mansion through the hole blasted there by their comrades makes reality sink in with a force that drives a few weary heroes to their knees.
Potter shakes his head. “None that I recall.”
His villainous rival needs medical attention, no doubt about that. This would be Harry’s prime opportunity to finally put the wanted criminal behind bars if he was certain the police would provide him with the necessary treatment.
“Ron!” The girl, Ginny, shouts.
“Madam, do you remember every meal you’ve ever had? Or rather, what you even ate last week?”
Giving her a weak smile, Harry lets her go, and she heads up the stairs—probably to see Luna before their night patrol.
Reaching up, he gives Dracon a one-armed hug. Then he pulls away and heads back up to his room so that he doesn’t have to see Draco leave.
As Potter continues to stare at his reflection, mouth slightly open, Draco’s gaze shifts to his mirror counterpart. His heart rolls over in his chest when he catches the soft, fond look reflected in his eyes. He tears his eyes away from the mirror and turns away, hoping Potter was too caught up to notice.
Harry goes to follow him but stops just outside when he hears Hermione ask Alpha Bee what will be done with the file they’ve recovered.
robot. But the real treasure he finds are the letters demanding Kevin report to specific Villain Agency bases. One, they so helpfully name, the Mother Base, and it’s located in Kensington.
“Well, he seems to have re-entered the fold nicely.” Harry uses his head to gesture toward the building Blaizing Fire and his cohorts had stood upon.
“That’s all right. How long do you think the fight went on?”
—say you almost sound c-con
The ground shakes violently, but the three heroes stand like the earthquake rocking the villains to their knees isn’t even there. Vice-Net’s sharp objects melt in his hands, and the rest decorating the inside of his suit plop onto the street in pools of molten metal. Paper Dracon’s forced to let go of the origami birds he’d pulled from his pockets as they catch alight. GarGoyle’s new army of stone statues can be heard prowling just outside the impenetrable barrier Hermione has formed.
Hermione shot him a dirty look and huffed. “Harry-”
Silence enveloped the lavishly decorated drawing room before Slughorn sighed. “I do not feel safe,” he admitted in a small voice.
For some reasons, Harry’s cheeks felt warm. He didn’t know why; it wasn’t the first time Malfoy made some modifications to Harry’s outfit. Whenever they had to attend an event hosted by conservative purebloods or foreigners with strong pureblood culture, Harry always had Malfoy check the appropriateness of what he wore.
The Potions Professor nodded. “The very same.”
Malfoy smiled as he deftly brought the thin slices of bamboo shoots to his mouth with his chopsticks (unlike Harry, who had to ask for a fork and a knife). He looked like things had gone according to his plans.
Harry squinted at the blonde who was currently sitting so closely to Mahoutokoro’s Head Boy they were almost in each other’s lap.
Before Harry even came to a decision on how he should react, the chance had come to pass.
Harry sniggered. “Yes, I know.”
Harry suddenly remembered Malfoy. ‘
“I would be even more grateful if you can stop using Theo to let off steam.”
When Harry was sixteen, King Tom learned of Harry’s existence, and the Order of the Phoenix was forced to strike.
Harry followed her lead, but after all the Lumos charms were extinguished, sleep evaded him for a long time.
Two years ago, Harry had no eye for quality at all, but after ascending the throne, and especially months of Malfoy dragging Harry into trade negotiations with merchants of goods, luxury items and commodities alike, the King would like to think that he was now at least able to tell apart expensive and cheap things.
Draco chuckled inwardly at the memory. The bickering didn’t end right away, but he did appreciate Little Wolf’s visits over time. Little Wolf was more intelligent than Vincent. Pansy simpered annoyingly over him, Theo preferred to read books indoors and Blaise proclaimed horse-riding or fencing too strenuous and beneath him. Little Wolf was adventurous and fun and they could teach each other things.
The knowledge spread through the entire Royal Castle within less than a day, and through the entire Kingdom the next day, after the news were covered in the Daily Prophet newspapers.
Soon enough, the liberal faction was thinking of a comeback of their own.
“Your Majesty…” Hestia Jones started.
Harry could see the moment Slughorn gave up. His straight-backed posture changed slightly. For once, Slughorn looked weary and every inch the centennial he was. “Your Majesty…” His eyes were imploring.
Malfoy didn't reply, but Harry had learned to read the meaning of silence.
The good news was, it was not Durmstrang's army that officially invaded Petra, but an independent army of fanatic former Death Eaters, led by a survivor of House Macnair who had managed to flee to Durmstrang at the end of the bloody war.
There was a history there Harry knew not of. Malfoy had worked very hard indeed to endear them to Zhongli.
Several lunar cycles passed, and Draco Malfoy returned to Petra’s Royal Castle with a choker around his neck.
“Stop,” Harry didn’t mean for things to get this far. He didn’t want to impart the impression that he truly didn’t trust his former Potions teacher. “There is no need, Horace.”
There was no way Zabini’s sharp eyes would not miss it, but the other pureblood wizard did not comment. He put down his wine glass and tapped the bottom casually as he remarked, “You have not chosen any aides or ladies-in-waiting, have you?”
Harry began to fret. He’d expected that the blonde would spew indignities and insult him like Lady Parkinson did, but the reply was just as short and cold as Harry’s owl. If anything, the blonde sounded… resigned. Like Harry was going to bid for his life.
“I’m not sure if Your Majesty understands… but having to prove oneself to authorities who are already biased against you is…” The Potions teacher trailed off. “Compared to having a fresh start abroad…”
The Head Girl nodded. “Let us proceed to the dormitories, then.”
Slughorn avoided Harry’s gaze. “Y-Your Majesty, Roseline is… really happy in Kasha. She will hate me if I bring her into this…” he rubbed his hands nervously.
The second wave of a long-drawn war Harry had feared didn’t come to fruition; Walden Macnair’s army was quickly subjugated.
That… was a little unexpected. “Thank you, milord,” Hermione responded happily.
As Harry raised his eyebrow, the other wizard continued. “As Your Majesty is aware, currently I am the only son of House Malfoy. My bloodline will end if I do not produce any heir for House Malfoy. Sure, Mother is still fertile, but she is getting on in years… pregnancy will be tough on her…”
the thought crossed Harry’s mind, but he couldn’t help it. Malfoy always had the ability to turn Harry into his worst self.
"Well, their loss is our gain," Malfoy seemed to have come to a decision quickly. “Theo,” his voice cut through the noise, shutting everyone up.
Harry’s throat felt swollen, choked with unspeakable emotions. “No, they won’t be, ‘Mione,” he whispered hoarsely as his fingers found their way to her hand.
Happy New Year!
As the redhead was finishing his food, he made a show of looking out of the windows. “Zhongli xian sheng, it’s time to water the Glaze Lilies, don’t you think?”
In turn, Harry took the sight in slowly, happy to note that the gaunt cheeks and black splotches were gone from the young man’s pale skin. It seemed he had recovered from the war… at least physically.
Harry could literally hear everyone stop talking. Other guests turned to them discreetly, their curiosity plenty visible, although not to the point of being rude.
Harry blinked profusely.
“Didn’t know the Li’s are so eager,” Zabini tilted his head back. “But anyways, you’re only half right, Draco.”
McGonagall did not show her dismay at the Slytherin’s reaction. She moved on to the next announcement. “As you have been informed, Mahoutokoro School of Magic has offered to shelter our seventh to eighth years while the Castle is being restored. As they have also offered to assist us in the restoration, we are hoping it won’t take longer than a few months. Meanwhile, an interim Head Boy and Head Girl will be selected from the sixth years. To seventh and eighth years, please gather in the Entrance Hall at 10pm. That is all.”
Theodore Nott looked startled at the implication of the gesture. He stepped forward hesitantly, gingerly taking the hand closer to him before bowing and placing the ghost of a kiss on the back of Malfoy’s hand. “T-thank you… I promise I will serve you with all that I have.”
Harry shook his head. He pointed at the door. “Let’s go.”
“Who is it this time?”
They were brought into the drawing room, which was as exotically decorated as the entrance hall.
Harry grimaced. “No, not Draco sodding Malfoy, please-”
“It’s fine,” Harry chased the irritation out of his head. “Let’s continue our negotiation.”
Malfoy shook his head silently, quiet as a mouse.
Harry wondered how they were going to suffer through the awkwardness of sitting around waiting for one person to finish eating, but the redhead gobbled up his food quite quickly. It also helped that Zhongli never ran out of words to say.
Harry turned to his right, where the brunette was still excitedly babbling to an obliging Neville all she’d managed to cram into her brains on the Japanese wizarding community (except the Toyohashi Tengu, the only thing Harry knew about Japan).
The pureblood wizard was not the kind to make such a simple mistake, but this wasn’t really the first time Harry heard others address the blonde as such. Harry let them go unpunished, because there was no point in disturbing the sense of ‘it was only a matter of time’ that was perpetuating amongst his subjects.
Everyone, except the pureblood faction.
“Oh?” Malfoy’s smile turned teasing, “I thought you’re running away,” he bantered.
Malfoy turned to the Han Chinese man. “Your Majesty, please allow me to introduce you to Lord Syaoran Li, the son and heir of Marchioness Yelan Li, the Matriarch of House Li from the Kingdom of Han.”
Harry felt tendrils of anger taking over his mind. He slammed his fist on the armrest of his throne. “How dare you-”
Harry smiled against the palm on his mouth. He looked back at her earnestly. “Of course, Gin. There is only you.”
Harry’s eyebrows rose to his hairline. There were still… 1 hour to morning assembly. Just how early did the blonde’s days start?
“Your Majesty,” as Harry was still trying to figure out what was going on, Malfoy leaned closer to the King, his posture subservient, “Your Majesty, may I propose that we go on a short trip?”
A group of people were standing in front of the Castle, the gold of some of their robes reflecting the sunlight. A woman stood in front of them, dark hair coiffed in a bun at her nape, her robe seemingly the most golden of them all, the layers of the oriental dress beneath them a muted black. What seemed like white foxes with red-tipped tails were embroidered on the hems. She bowed deeply from the waist, and the entire congregation behind her followed, like a perfectly choreographed performance.
Several pairs of eyes turned towards the red-haired royal.
“Bring me a bottle of veritaserum from my Potions Closet! The bottle is labeled-”
Harry blinked… the striking man was… Zhongli himself!? Harry had thought he was the butler, or another guest of Zhongli. From all accounts, Zhongli should be at least seventy years old, but the man in front of them only appeared to be in his twenties… Even early thirties was stretching it.
“And you have done that,” Hermione remarked confidently. “That, and Draco’s Life Debt to you are two separate obligations. Am I not right?” She turned to Shacklebolt and Slughorn, who both nodded, the latter more enthusiastically.
Harry expected Hermione to shrug and offer another name, but she turned serious. “He owes you a Life Debt, doesn’t he?”
Childe Tartaglia picked up his chopsticks, which were lacquered in gold and looked very different from the ones Malfoy, Zabini and Nott were using, with relish. The redhead put the red scarf that had looked like a bloody wound across his torso out of the way. He clapped his hands together and exclaimed. “I will partake!”
“Glad you like it,” Harry squashed the guilt in his heart and forced a smile on his face. “Let’s eat.”
Hermione brightened. This research seemed to have been more successful. “Snezhnaya’s army, the Fatui, did have a group of elites called the Harbingers… but from the accounts I read, rather than Aurors, they… functioned more like Unspeakables. They were elite spies, rather than elite commanders… except the last Eleventh Harbinger, codenamed ‘Childe’ for being the youngest to earn the title of a Harbinger. His battle prowess was legendary. The mere mention of his codename struck fear in the hearts of many.”
Harry had been disguised within an inch of his life and dropped into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he made more friends and honed his magical powers despite the fear and menace spread by Umbridge and the Carrows.
“Zhongli xian sheng,” an unfamiliar baritone voice rang through the dining room, young and playful, yet hiding the edge of a razor under the thin veneer of a velvet sheath. “It’s mean of you to have started without me.”
McGonagall cleared her throat. “I need to…pre-empt you that our counterparts are exceedingly polite, and it is in their culture to never show outright rejection and contempt. You are all old enough to be considered adults, and we are already imposing on them. I do NOT want to hear any news of you causing trouble, am I clear?”
Ah, of course Malfoy and Li knew what Harry was on to. It had become a public secret by now. The couple wasn’t beating around the bush.
“It’s nothing,” the redhead swaggered to the beautiful man and wrapped his arm around that slender black-clad waist. “We ought to spruce this mansion up a bit.”
She smiled at him like a grandmother would a dear grandson. “I have always believed that you have the courage to do what needs to be done.”
Harry shuddered.
Hermione blinked profusely when Harry showed her the letter. She gaped, her mouth opening and closing like a goldfish. “Wha- H-how dare she-!”
“I am deeply honoured that Your Majesty misses this old wizard and finds his skills useful. However, this old wizard is tired… This old wizard would like to return to retirement and live a quiet life…”
[1] Because Harry was kinda in hiding when he attended Hogwarts, he used the name Harry Dursley. Harry wasn’t famous like in canon, but he still developed a rivalry against Draco for being an opposing Seeker his age.
But there was something about the man’s aura that reminded Harry of Dumbledore. It was timeless… and there was also a tiredness to him, something that had seeped into the bones and weighted down his posture.
Hence, Harry had rather assumed that the wizarding world’s attitude toward homosexuality would be that of, well, bigotry. And worse than Muggle’s.
Malfoy only twisted his lips. “Well, I’ve known that I would have a child by twenty since I was a child myself.” One hand rested on his stomach unconsciously.
The man standing at the door frame was tall and gangly. He had orange hair and blue eyes. At one glance, he did not look all that different from a Weasley - like Bill, or Charlie, maybe - but once Harry looked closer, he realised the man’s blue eyes were darker, and they hid monstrous darkness within. Not unlike the stormy seas, where Hydra and Kraken lurked. All of Harry’s senses were working overtime.
Scorp slapped his arm, “Ugh. No one can prove that.”
Draco laughed, and he looked so -
Silence. Ron stirred a pot.
“Fuck, Draco,” he grabbed his arse, thrusting slow and strong, “Just - please.”
“I’m here to - I mean, I want to return -”
And then Draco had a thought.
“It matters,” he exhaled, smoke spiraling, “To me.”
“Yeah, I,” he swallowed, “Of course.”
His heart seized up, his mouth watered, and he longed for a third cigarette.
At least he’d have something to report in his first owl back.
But there was Longbottom’s face in the fire, still nervous-looking but, he had to admit it, rather more handsome than he remembered.
And Al - he kind of glowed.
Playlist track: "The Origin of Love" from Hedwig and the Angry Inch.
“Do you know what it was like, back then?”
“I was young, once. Prone to throwing myself at handsome strangers. And you’ve always been -”
And deep in him was an ugly thing, a petrified thing, a mewling - he had never intended to fall in love with a man. He couldn’t be - couldn’t tell his friends that he was -
“Always.”
“Lube?”
Draco crossed the room, stepped into the lift.
And Harry felt - he felt nothing. As far as he could tell, the young man was absolutely his type - tall, slender, messy blonde hair, a tattoo peeking out from under his collar. One hundred percent, the kind of guy that he thought he should go for, age aside. But all of those features, the things that were nice to look at, lacked the spark, the crucial element, the piece that he’d been missing for so long.
“Yes - just -”
Harry had fucked up in many ways, but as he helped Lily into her pyjamas and let her choose a book for bedtime reading, he thought, yeah, I haven’t screwed up being a dad. His kids were happy. Back when Ginny first fell pregnant, he’d been gripped by terror. What if he was too - too broken, too filled with poison, too dead inside, to properly love a child? What if he was really like Petunia, harsh, cold; what if he’d learned hatred from Vernon?
Cautiously, Harry walks back down the alley until he stands beside him. “Yes?”
Ron’s cheeks flush.
“How?” Fire scoffs. “Only had to set the underside of it on fire at the right angle. Made a nice little explosion too. But you’d hardly notice with the fuss the common folk are m—Are you trying to attack me?!”
Harry jolts up, powers up, and pats at his chest, arms, and face. “I’m alive!” He whirls to face Jane Jenkins and fixes his position so that he’s on one knee.  “Oh, my great lady. Thank you for sparing my life.” He ducks his head in a bow while she and the other children giggle. “In return for this great act of mercy, I shall dedicate my life to making this city as safe as it can be for your ladyship.”
“Hey.” His voice sounds soft and strained to Draco’s ears. “Hey.” His hands hover in front of her, not reaching out to touch.
Hermione claps twice, her eyes shining. “I’m glad to hear it! I loved Galbraith’s first novel, and I’ll probably swipe the sequel off of you when you’re done with it.”
about that.
“For the most part, yeah.”
“Oh, no you don’t,” Harry yelled and propelled himself forward. At this rate, their game would be over soon, with Draco making snatching grabs at the Snitch already.
Harry’s startled to find his electricity stuttering off. Feeling warm under the collar, he prays Dracon didn’t notice, but he knows how unrealistic that would be, particularly given that Harry’s the main light source in the alleyway.
“That still doesn’t explain why
Unfortunately, if you're reading on a phone, tablet, or similar device, you won't be able to see a hero's true name by hovering over their alias. However, there is
Draco rubbed at where his gaping wound had been like the spot pained him now. “It’s time for me to go,” he rasped. “I don’t want to go.”
..................
Laughing lowly, he replies, “I don’t think so.”
“Never like this. You may be a lot of things, Paper Dracon, but you’re no murderer—”
His eyes flick back to Ginny, who’s still struggling with her brother’s weight, and the villain, whose aid would arrive any second to carry him off.
“You need medical attention.”
Silence answers him.
what we’re planning? Do you know nothing about use of leverage, hero?”
“What made everything worse was this giant . . . .” She stops speaking and brings a fist up to her mouth.
“With all due respect, Mr. Hendricks, we’ll be conducting the questions here,” one of the Aurors says.
—because you were subconsciously afraid that we could—
“You’re sharper than Goyle or Crabbe, but not by much.” Draco floated beside Harry, his head hovering over Harry’s left shoulder, watching Harry scribble out the win-count on Draco’s side of the parchment. “Hey, now, I bribed them fair and square!”
“How is your leg doing, by the way?” Harry can’t stop the question from leaving his lips.
Potter turns his head to the side to stare at a point on the wall to the left, his shoulders hunching. “It’s not really something I try remembering all that much.”
“Oh, you know, Hermione. When hero duty calls . . .” Harry says.  Shoving his hands into his pockets and shuffling past her inside the house, he tells himself there’s no reason to feel guilty.
Since
“Simply brilliant, Mr. Fortescue! My associate and I thank you very much!” Draco grabs the two ice creams and a pair of spoons before Potter can stick his foot in the generous offer any further. He selects a table near the back.
“Yes, and, Ha—Izulu, we can’t just leave right now.” Hermione gestures to the Palace. “For all we know, there’s more people trapped inside that haven’t gotten out.”
Dracon’s fingers twitch in Harry’s grip. “It—You don’t know what they’re doing to those heroes. And I—I can’t—”
“Ah.” He puts his teacup down and stares into it for a moment before looking up at Draco. “I’m afraid I was mistaken.”
A thrill of fear shoots down Harry’s spine.
“You implied it well enough.” Narcissa walked past him. “Now where did you find him—my son’s body? Point it out to me.”
Harry groans and turns his head. He spots his mask lying on the bedside table next to a glass of water. As he stares at the glass, he becomes aware of how much like sandpaper his tongue feels as it rubs the roof of his mouth. He reaches for it and misses, his arm swinging wide of its mark.
“What—” Potter looks around at their surroundings. “Wh-why would you bring me
“I don’t know what you’re getting at.”
Fire doesn’t move. Instead, he provides Harry with that annoying sensation again of being measured for all he’s worth. “Strip Poker, huh?”
“Probably until the explosion happened. I think the masked figure fighting the robot caused it to explode somehow.”
“Would have to know a specific location to do that.”
He is still contemplating an answer when his eyes, still adjusting, catch a flash of white as it leaves Dracon’s uncurling right hand. Harry has a moment to shield his head as a giant paper swan catapults into him, knocking him down.
It feels so good not to be in that stuffy medical ward another second.
Once outside, Draco looks at the darkening sky before glancing over at Potter who’s bundled up tight again. “I know you probably want to head home, but there’s one more stop I want to head to before you go.”
Harry raises a brow and asks, “You didn’t eat yet?”
“Ah, yeah, see. People like me—
Hermione either doesn’t hear Ron’s comment, or she’s too happy to care at the moment. “Have there been any books either of you two have been eyeing?”
“Hmm. Thanks for the concern, but it’s unnecessary. I was trained as a villain, after all.”
Justin says, “Sorry, I don’t have any tea ready, and I imagine your time is quite precious.”
The villains have overcome their confusion and seem to be regrouping.
As Harry turns back around with Dracon’s costume ensemble cradled in his arms, he keeps his head facing the wall next to him. All the while, he feels like his skin is on fire from Dracon’s gaze.
silverware
Looking up in the direction of the building, if Harry squints, he can see perhaps another piece flitting out of the gaping hole. His tongue clicks on the roof of his mouth. Now there’s no telling whether these torn strips come from one of the victims, an unfortunate clothing article caught up in the blast, or the culprit as they made their escape.
“You’d like me to try that again?” The hissing voice makes a humming sound. “Will it be more flashes with this hero smiling, glowing in back alleyways, and having sunlight shine on his raven hair?”
Fixing a sneer onto his face, he says, “Well, I’m right here, Potter. You’re welcome to try it.”
Harry fell back, picked up his coffee. He had a feeling that he knew what was coming.
“Have you let anyone else fuck you?”
“Of course,” he felt a bit faint.
He looked up at Aengus, and Aengus looked mildly back.
If he had been a muggle, he would probably have been happier.
“Fuck me.”
She was still annoyed that it wasn’t her turn yet, after all, and any chance to sneak into the castle was much appreciated. As he watched her - taking in all the details, memorizing the portraits and the suits of armor and the smell of potions wafting from the dungeons - he felt the shadow of his first moments, here. Hogwarts was his first real home.
Silence.
Once he’d walked out of Harry’s building, he’d found the nearest corner shop and bought a pack of Marlboro lights. Then he’d gone into the off-license and bought a bottle of whiskey, and then he’d come home, and he’d started throwing things.
“Potter,” a chilled and familiar voice.
He remembered staring at her picture in the paper - beautiful and ethereal in the engagement photo, in a canary-yellow sundress, Harry holding her, and he’d hated her with such bitterness that he thought he’d never recover, and he smoked a whole pack of cigarettes and ashed all over her perfect fucking face.
Playlist track: "Feeling Good" by Sammy Davis Jr.
He started, painstakingly, to rebuild his walls.
“Yes. But…”
Harry held him and kissed his shoulder and yawned.
Harry winced, then, remembering Jamie’s pleased (and mocking, yes, alright) face, grinned.
His voice was softer than he intended, with an undercurrent of - something. Something too nice for the bloke you’d pulled off the night before. Draco blushed, just a pale tint of color.
“Well,” Hermione interrupted his internal monologue, and not before time - he was dangerously close to crying, “I think it’s about time to put this little one to bed.”
There was little tenderness here - and that was okay, sometimes they needed this; sometimes one or both of them needed something harder, more painful, to fuck away the bad stuff. Memories. Ghosts. Sins.
Harry sat, mute.
When they got back from their holiday, their lives linked up, blended almost seamlessly, as if it had always been that way - them, their families, their whole world. Everyone just called them “Harry ‘n’ Draco,” two individuals made into a single unit, never one without the other.
“But I want to, Draco,” he placed his cup down, pulse racing, and turned, tucking his leg under, staring, “I want you, God, how I -”
Harry didn’t think there was a good equivalent to, “I’m going into Auror training so I can track down dark wizards,” so he just nodded.
“Do you think you don’t deserve it?”
But that Malfoy was gone.
He wished he could see Harry’s face.
Because of Draco?
Harry rolled over, staring at the ceiling.
“Have a cunt, more like.”
Playlist track: "Papi Pacify" by FKA Twigs.
Draco snored.
He cares, Harry realized, and he started - just a little - to hope.
And he had that overheard conversation. He told himself it was just - just natural curiosity. Maybe Draco was up to something, again. Maybe he was in danger.
He fucked into him hard, breath on his neck, one hand holding him down and the other gripping his hip, pulling him back, leaving marks that Harry already knew he’d wear and cherish until they faded away. The pressure built in him, overwhelming, boiling like bathwater, sweet and cloying like too much rum, smelling and tasting like Draco, Draco by the water, and in the alleys, and dancing in fey dawn light -
Harry’s voice was quiet.
“What am I going to do with you, Lil-bear?”
Potter was silent. He took one last drag of his cigarette, then dropped it and ground it out with his boot.
Draco pushed his thumb against a tablet by the front door - a bit of magical security inspired by a muggle invention. It read magical signatures instead of fingerprints; Pansy had given him temporary access for the day.
Gin’s shoulders tensed, and then she turned to face him and crossed her arms.
“I know,” he held his muscled back, “But you love me.”
“Draco, I -”
“Oh, nice.”
What the hell am I doing here?
A pain in his chest. She ground out her cigarette on the carpet.
“So it passes Malfoy inspection, hmm?”
What if he would look at a child of his blood and resent them bitterly because they’d never have to live the way that he had, hungry, cold, forgotten? It was a terrible thing to be so afraid of whatever monster might live in him - of the ways in which he had been harmed.
She opened the front door for him and he jumped in, thoughtless, and slammed it behind him. It was only the utter silence of the foyer that alerted him to the fact that he had made possibly the worst entrance in the history of Malfoy manor.
“I do.”
He quickly looked away, down at the coffee.
“So?”
“Well, I’m not going to.”
It's full of charts and facts and figures
“Er,” he passed it up.
“D’you ever -”
“Fuck, Harry,” his voice broke a bit on the name, “Not a smoker, then?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry felt a shard of something digging into his knee, probably cutting him. He stayed still, hardly breathing.
“You have a lot of nerve to talk about family. You’re going to stand here and talk shit, like you had the perfect childhood? Pretend that your father isn’t a boot-licking monster?”
“Would you -”
She was thanking him, and for what?
“Oh,” he felt very small. And kind of vindicated, a gift he didn’t expect to receive from Ginny Potter.
“Could anybody really be this thick, living in my awful flat for… God, the towels are so soft… I may well kill him…”
Slow dancing, high as fuck, in that shitty flat, cans of cider attracting flies
“Except Nev.”
Harry started to laugh.
The corner of Hermione’s mouth curled up, the way it always did when Ron was about to say something uncharacteristically profound.
It probably felt awful. And yet it was so obvious, from the outside, that they were meant to be together.
Just like Potter, he thought. Bumbling, inexpressive, and manipulative.
He took Harry’s wrist, pulling him off the dance floor, shoving him into the toilets.
“What things?”
Draco’s voice was low, dangerous, and deadly serious.
“You shock me.”
“Definitely.”
Harry turned against the glass, breathless, helpless.
Scorp’s eyebrows were drawn together, nervous, “Is it alright, Father?”

Black and white - morality, duty, good and evil, a chess game with clear rules, things he should and shouldn’t do.
“Potter,” he met his eyes, storm-grey, angry, scared, “What - don’t start something -”
“I know it’s not much, Dad -” Al started, embarrassed.
Finishing his second cigarette, he wedged himself into the closet-shaped shower, not waiting for the cold water to heat up. A quick scrub with Tesco-brand soap, a brush of his teeth, and he fluffed his hair with a threadbare towel before running a bit of pomade - his last luxury - through the asymmetrical strands.
Open up
Hidden behind a mouldy grimoire, on the bottom ledge of a built-in bookshelf, was a bottle of Black Bushmills. He moved the book, took up the bottle, and assessed the two inches remaining.
“Something like that.”
“Yeah,” he shrugged, “I’m happy for them.”
“Yeah. That.”
Pansy turned to look at him with a face that said, “Is this fucker for real?” Draco shrugged and fought the urge to laugh.
“Alright,” he ruffled his hair, “So. Cat, or no cat?”
“Me too,” he put his arm along the back cushions, hand just centimetres from Draco’s neck, “Thanks again for the help.”
He sat back down on the couch. Thought about what Lily might say, asking too many questions, wondering if they still loved her. He stood up again in a panic. Thought about Al looking disappointed in him (which was not altogether unusual, God, he was so much smarter than his old Dad). Fell back onto the couch with a thump.
He should have known better.
At the door, he turned around and looked at his beautiful daughter, pink duvet tucked around her, and thought, how could I ever have doubted?
I’m going to do this. He set his shoulders. For no particular reason.
I'm a weirdo
“Yes. But I - don’t repeat this - I think I love her, for how much she loves you.”
He couldn’t live with it anymore.
He breathed in deep, closed his eyes, ground out, “Walk away from me. To the windows.”
Serons-nous admirables ?"
Music was what kept him going - the kind of music that his parents had never let him listen to, ugly and wailing and wild, soft and heartbreaking, stupid and silly and utterly perfect. Led Zeppelin blared out when he smoked his first spliff (courtesy of that same upstairs neighbor, who was quite sketchy indeed, but with an apartment full of exotic birds and a too-kind heart). Tiffany sang about being alone, and he danced in front of the cracked mirror while he cut his own hair.
“Ah,” pushing that very firmly to the side, at least for the moment, Draco leaned forward, “I’ll take that into consideration. Do you two understand why you’re in trouble?”
“I do, yeah,” he cleared his throat, about to explain, when Draco interrupted -
Harry stood, still half in the door, wondering just how badly he’d messed up.
“Oh Draco,” she shook her head, “Perhaps we should have.”
He wondered if they’d get to the begging.
His knees creaked as he stood - he may have felt like a teenager, inside, but his body was one hundred percent 37 years old, and it hated him.
Harry, under him, thrust up, and he ground down, and they moved together there in the daylight. One of Harry’s hands came around and rubbed up against his prick; he pushed into it, chasing that moment, biting and sucking and worshipping that mouth.
“I almost expected you to eviscerate him.”
It was probably for the best that he’d fallen back asleep.
Fuck Potter, he thought. Fuck.
He wanted to burn the world down.

“Shh.”
He’d let Hermione pick out his new clothes.
Harry got up onto his knees, sat back on his heels.
“Or is there something else?”
They looked at each other and grinned, and said in tandem -
“Yes, after you died,” she gave him a bit of a slap on his shoulder, and then her lips wobbled.
“Come here,” Draco jerked his head.
But I
Harry laughed, and maybe he was also crying a little, and he did pull his hair, and Draco took him down all the way, until Harry gave a choked moan and pushed him back -
He stared at rows of bottles, shining in the light - clear, claret, amber, dusty green - and realized he had tried almost every liquor in the place. He was struck by an almost physical ennui. He was bored, tired of everything, his life settled and his fate sealed. And when he saw this bottle of whiskey, he remembered the first night that he and Harry had danced until sunrise.
Draco sneered.
“What do you know?”
“No,” he sighed, pulled himself into a sitting position, “What’s going on?”
“Well said.”
But i swear by your expression
So he remembered something else.
“Just - let me.”
“Scorpius,” Draco called him over, took him by the shoulders, and wrapped him in a firm embrace, “Just be safe, alright?”
She sat down on the ground next to him, arranging her tight skirt, taking off her tailored suitcoat.
But that was just his body, just a mechanical thing, and it didn’t necessarily mean -
Oh Merlin, his friends were killing him.
“Dad,” Lily whined, and it shouldn’t have been so cute, “Pay attention!”
"With light in my head
He rolled over and stretched, lazy, down to his toes. Tired or not, he felt unusually fantastic. His whole body was relaxed like a spiral of honey off the comb, the bed so soft, his muscles slack. Eyes still closed, he remembered last night - the club, the courthouse, the grit of the stone behind him, and Draco’s hand. Draco’s mouth as it bit him and as his whole body released, as if he had been waiting his whole life for that sharp pain.
“So, Potter. What do you think?”
The day was too much.
The feeling of sunrise in Cork - the way the air was damp and fresh, shaking, all too aware of the panic of nighttime, liminal and lined with edges of gold - went best with Bowie. Some mornings he listened to “Heroes,” and he thought about what he had never been. On other mornings he put on “Let’s Dance” and drank cup after cup of shitty instant coffee before heading down across Saint Patrick Street to scrub the sticky floors of the club he’d been writhing in four hours before.
“Is there - do you have some explanation as to why you wanted to, to talk, after…”
Gods bless Hermione for setting him up with a muggle credit card.
He ran his hand along the firm curve of Harry’s leg.
And he wouldn’t have anyone to kiss in the mornings, or laugh at the Quibbler with before bed, or hug a little and pretend -
“You’re in no position to make demands,” but he still shoved in another finger, scissoring, making Harry cry out.
The panel next to the lift - a complex weaving of magi-muggle tech, with a private Sonorus charm linked up with wiring - chimed.
The doors opened.
“No, you’re not.”
“Nice, Pans.”
He was unusually still, “I may have… tried out for the Wasps.”
“Come with me,” her voice brusque, heels clicking back towards the staircase.
It seemed entirely absurd. And beautiful.
Potter was none too gentle getting through the crowd. He shoved aside the bloke - entirely forgotten - in front of Draco, getting a nasty look and then a hasty retreat in response. And Draco couldn’t blame him - Potter looked, for once in his life, every inch the savior of the wizarding world. He was thick with muscle and taller than Draco remembered him, and there was something dark behind his eyes.
He didn’t move.
“Please, Draco.”
“Oh Christ, Ron, what have you let him eat?”
“Thank fuck,” and he slid a finger in.
A month later and Harry was digging in his school trunk and he came across -
They were perfect together.
It was a very sad day indeed when a Potter was the brains of the operation. Draco sighed, rubbed his eyes, longing fervently for a glass of brandy and his bed.
“Al’s Slytherin,” and then he mumbled, “So’s Scorp, if you’ll remember -”
He heard the clinking of dishes being washed downstairs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry,” his breath shook, “I can’t live through you leaving again. I can’t do it.”
“And I will love you if you love me back or if you walk away.”
He had told everyone he was going to America. And he had meant to, but he got… waylaid.
“Right,” he stood up, “Right.”
“Move,” Draco whispered, harsh.
“Yeah,” Draco lit up a cigarette, shoulders tight, “I just don’t want to get used to it.”
Ron was bustling at the stove, making sure that Hermione’s dinner was still warm and ready.
Harry had never been anywhere or done anything. Well, he’d been to Scotland, of course, and he had killed Voldemort, which was probably more than other nineteen year old wizards had done. But that was just - that was the way his life went.
“Let go, Potter,” irate, immovable, his flesh like a stone, and then the cold veneer splintered and Draco closed his eyes, “Please, Harry.”
Clear to follow through
Scorpius leaned forward, tipping Al onto his back.
“And you do not need to explain it. You are a man grown. We cannot change the past. But Draco,” she leaned forward in her chair, and he did, too, their faces so close, “You’ve been so terribly unhappy.”
Harry was hot, through every cell, and his nails were cutting into his palms, and the anger let him pretend that his heart wasn’t breaking.
“No,” he frowned, “She was hiding in a closet. So that’s another family characteristic, I suppose.”
“I don’t even want to ask what the potion was… I think I may need to call your father.”
Draco yawned, stretched, settled more solidly into Harry’s arms.
“One drink.”
He gestured towards Harry’s prick, practically dripping with precome, but Harry shook his head, shy. But then he felt a sense of resolve -
He placed his hand over Harry’s on his chest, a silver band on Harry’s fourth finger complimenting the gold on Draco’s, and laced their fingers together.
How did his mother still make him feel so small?
The stiletto-sharp clack of Pansy’s high heels. He saw her coming down the staircase, regal as ever, and he saw the look on her face when she realized who the mysterious client Draco begged her to take really was.
“This ridiculous charade… these months, every fuck, every pitiful,” he slammed a fist against the wall, “You wanted me to feel something for you, compassion and gratitude and -”
Draco pulled away, wiping his hand on Potter’s shirt, zipping himself back up. He pulled out his pack of cigarettes and tried not to notice his hand shaking as he lit one.
Harry gripped onto Draco’s sides. They were in the half-light of the alley beside their club, and music was playing, and they were crowded on every side by other young people living other secret lives. Harry’s back was to the wall, their come still wet and warm in their jeans after rubbing against each other and laughing and crying out, muffled, into the other’s neck.
“What are you doing here?”
“Shut up.”
“Did you really imagine that I didn’t spot you this morning?”
Draco opened the door.
“Mm,” Draco pulled out a pocket watch - which gave Harry an opportunity to run his eyes over the sharply tailored suit one more time, Merlin fuck he just wanted to rip it off and lick every inch - and frowned, “I’ve a meeting, need to run. But I’ve got a good friend who’s the best estate agent in London. Discreet. Owl me if you want her to set something up.”
“Congratulations. Er, I guess.”
“What are you doing here, Potter?”
“Why now, Harry?”
There’s this feeling that he would get in his chest, sometimes, that he thought he must have been born with - some sort of inherent flaw, a curse, like a faltering heart. It was the feeling of Father putting down one of the hunting crups, a pup, for being born too small - the feeling when he’d had a nightmare and wet the bed and his mother told him he was too old to be comforted, and shamed him. A wrenching, like when Dobby didn’t come home, like when Pansy’d kissed him in fourth year, and he’d felt nothing, and that nothing ached with the life he thought he should have and now knew he never would.
“Yeah. Because - Ron, I did love her. I do, I swear. I thought - we got through the war, and she’d been waiting, and I wanted…”
He came. It was - acceptable. He kicked Thom out with a perfunctory “thanks.” He forgot his name five minutes later.
“Draco -”
“Sure, Draco,” he closed his eyes, smiling halfway, “You can get a cat.”
He listened to The Clash and thought about his father, about imposing his own brand of anarchy on his stilted and tight fisted childhood. He threw things and threw up at two in the morning, the McDonald’s he’d grabbed after a night at the clubs coming up looking not all that dissimilar from the way it went down.
He watched the boys as they walked towards the door, and if he noticed the smirks they sent each other - already planning something else, no doubt - he let himself ignore it. He leaned back in his chair and threw a glance at Longbottom under half-lidded eyes.
And then there was David Bowie.
“Oi, that’s not -”
It was a long slog, the death eater trials. Lucius’s trial was early on - his guilt beyond obvious, his crimes severe - but Narcissa and Draco weren’t tried until three weeks after that.
At midnight, he got up, sat at his desk, and penned an owl in his looping, graceful hand before he could stop himself. Just four words, and maybe - maybe he could have -
They sat on the fluffy velvet couches, recessed lighting off but fairy lights on, and the kids rolled around on the carpet, making a mess, tickling and yelling and coming up with alarming plans, and -
“Okay, then. This portkey will take you -”
Hecate help him, Scorpius looked more repentant about his clumsiness than about the whole “danger to life and limb” portion of the evening.
“I think you’re right, Ron.”
He held out his right hand, “Light another, will you?”
And that was right and good.
He tried to put that away. Pack it down somewhere. Under the cloak - in a cupboard.
“I do,” he wrapped a hand around Draco’s cock - hard and hot and fuck, so ready - and pushed two fingers into him, curling up. Draco raised his chest, head thrown back, stomach concave - and he was like a fucking sculpture, right here in this moment, in marble, glittering, something fit for a museum, something to worship.
He’d missed the portkey.
Greg had a little girl with toasted brown skin, Gabrielle, the first half-blood in his family, and Greg was so delighted, his doughy face beautiful as he held her in his arms -
Draco took a drag from his cigarette. Harry wanted to hit him, and wanted to crowd up behind him, press against his naked back, say no, and fuck you, and please.
Playlist track: "Rock 'n' Roll With Me" by David Bowie.
He wouldn’t do it again for almost 17 years.
Draco colored, looked at his lap, “Yes, well…”
“No, Scorpius. Albus. It’s because what you did was very dangerous,” he ran his hand through his hair, considering pulling it out, “You can’t just go into the forest, expecting to emerge perfectly safely - good gods, your teachers didn’t even know where you were!”
“Fuck the what if. Just do the thing, alright, because you deserve -”
When his alarm went off, Harry burrowed his head further into the down pillows and groaned. Why was he waking up this early?
Harry felt like he nearly shouted, “I’ll owl you?”
This is my world.
Staring up at mural after mural, Harry felt that burden of war continue. People always found reasons for violence, muggles and wizards alike. They found ways to hate and hurt each other; they found in groups and out groups, gods and goddesses and politics and magic, excuses. Concepts to blame.
“Let’s stop there, shall we?” She shivered in disgust, “I am already struggling to keep this appalling whiskey down.

“Holy shit.”
Laughing at dawn and the too-small bed and birdsong
“I realized, in the end,” his voice was relaxed, like they were discussing the weather, “That you didn’t mean it.”
She rolled her eyes.
“After all that you’re going home. To Ginevra. Who is, I think you may remember, a woman.”
So breakable.
“You fucking me? Putting your cock up my arse?”
“So still super gay, then?”
Nothing could have stopped the evil which had always existed in their world. War is war; hate is hate. But in this other universe, the world where the adults did their jobs, where childhood was protected, where they both were loved, they fought on the same side.
“We were young, I know that now, though it didn’t feel like it at the time. Maybe - maybe you thought that telling me that you - that you - ugh.”
Cripes. Harry had barely noticed, trying to get in and out as fast as possible. But he ran back through the evening and realized -
“Why do you think you deserve me?”
“Fuck you, Potter.”
“Whoever she is, son, you’d better be after her.”
Harry felt something crawling in his chest.
He wanted everything. Every stupid, sexy, dirty thing - he wanted it all.
Harry smiled, and he saw a hint of laughter in Draco’s grey eyes.
It sounded suspiciously like Potter.
And he was leaning closer, face so tender and warm and scared -
Draco did, and stared up at Harry, eyes hazy and mouth sharp, “And were you asking me, or my arsehole?”
“Nothing to say?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He snapped his mouth shut and stormed out, embarrassed, because he did care. He testified for them. Of course he did. He’d expected Hermione - or at least Ron - to object, but they were both… oddly quiet on the matter.
“I hated him,” that was Hermione, interrupted by an injured, “Oi!” from Ron, “Oh, yes, it wasn’t real hate, but I... wanted him and wanted that feeling to stop and - and Ronald, I love you dearly, but you were not exactly easy to deal with in school.”
“Still turned on by baths, hmm?”
Once he’d gotten into his room, he fell straightaway onto soft white linen and down-stuffed pillows.
That didn’t go at all as he’d expected.
“Oh do be quiet.”
“From the look on your face, I almost believe you. But know,” the heel-clack noise, firmer this time, “If you do, I will come back here. And I will have no problem, whatsoever, ripping off your fucking testicles. Got it?”
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She crossed to Potter, the heel-clacking noise angry and brutal.
“Harry,” she was picking at a spot on the table with her left thumbnail, “Even after - even though we didn’t work out - I do want you to be happy. If not with me, then…”
He thought that, defiant, and ignored the voice which mocked him - a voice that sounded too much like his father - saying that he was weak, that he could never resist Harry Potter. So the fuck what, he nearly shouted back, just let me, let me -
He’d always wanted Harry Potter.
Some of the eyes were more intense than others. The closely cropped hair on the back of his neck prickled, and he licked his lips, and he knew without needing to look that Harry Potter had come back.
Everyone watched with much interest as Harry stood up, faced the taller blonde and slid a ring across his finger.
Dean and Neville stared as Seamus cut a huge portion of Shepherd pie for himself. “Leave some for us, mate!”
“We do have a bargaining chip with Theodore Nott, though,” Shacklebolt continued.
Her expression was fully contrite when Harry leaned over to gaze at Teddy. “I’m sorry I didn’t let you know of those customs beforehand, Harry. Most pureblood customs aren’t documented… They were passed down from parents to children...we just grew up with them, and they become our common sense but not common sense to anyone else…”
, the thought brought a smile to his face. “I’ll escort you.” The King put down his glass and turned to his guests. “I apologise...”
“We’re going shopping?” Zhongli looked pleasantly surprised. He was always happy to peruse through wares.
“And you, my name,” Draco countered easily, tilting his head to peer at the other teenage boy, whom he’d last seen the summer before he started Hogwarts. Little Wolf had grown up to a…fit young man, filling his high-collared black button-down uniform nicely as far as Draco could see. Not surprising, based on the hours Little Wolf must have spent on martial arts.
Zabini grinned rakishly, his eyes glimmering with amusement. The Ladies stopped what they were doing for a moment and just stared. The only son of Mrs Zabini was really good looking - his jaw, his nose, his cheekbones, his brows, those lips - they were perfect. He was as chiseled as a statue.  Even Hermione was staring, before she cleared her throat and looked down, cheeks turning pink. The sound of a glass being knocked came from Harry’s right.
They fell silent for a while before Li coughed. “Your Majesty, to avoid problems with illegitimacy and birthrights, usually the rituals for pureblood marriage prevents any pregnancy not conceived by the two parties in the marriage from occurring...”
Petra’s first attempt at reopening her borders to other non-blood-supremacist Kingdoms was a wreck.
Harry could recognise the handwriting before he opened the seal.
More time passed. More conservative purebloods trickled back into Petra's court. The engagement party went on without a hitch. The guests, who were pleased that the pureblood traditions were appropriately included, had sung the praises of Malfoy, and by extension Harry. Ginny had looked unhappy in the weeks leading to the event and after. Harry and Ginny didn’t have much of an engagement, after all, let alone an engagement party. But she started to feel the baby kicking, and shortly thereafter Harry was spending most of his available free time kneeling by his wife’s side, with his hands pressed on her stomach and his lips against her skin, babbling nonsense to their baby.
There was a pocket of silence before Harry heard the King of Kasha sigh.
“It’s almost time,” Harry picked up a long wooden cane, the portkey that had been prepared for the trip. “Let’s go,” he said brusquely.
But Malfoy didn’t appear to be listening. “Now that you have the chance to reap the benefit - only the child - and get rid of the rest of us, of course, you would-”
“Yes, I’d say those chains are quite necessary,” Salt n’ Pepper Auror says.
“That—I didn’t know that.” Or he hadn’t really given much thought as to why Malfoy hadn’t fled England like his mother when he’d found out Malfoy had died.
He leaps out of the hole and finds himself landing on the lawn after a half-a-story fall. Having not sprained anything, he looks around until he locates Paper Dracon off to the side, a good way apart from the group.
“No. It’s just . . . . You’ve been tortured for over a week!”
Slowly, Hermione crosses one leg over the other and glances briefly at Ron. “Okay. If you say so, Harry.”
Feeling bold and a little reckless, Harry says, “Why not?”
......................................................
The origami bird’s flapping at him with its wings and pecking at him with a sharp beak. As Harry powers back up to blast the swan, he sees another equally large white shape flying away.
“I-I-I didn’t—Please! You don’t trust me, and you shouldn’t—but . . . . Come on. They’ve probably surrounded the warehouse by now!”
“To... Hogwarts?”
.................................................
“That, I also don’t really know, Alpha Bee. But I do know that I’m making some kind of progress this way, and that what I have right now with Paper Dracon is tenuous at best. Capturing him would likely ruin whatever headway I’ve made or could make.”
Ron’s arms drop for a second as he cries out, then rise up again to swat at the bird buzzing about his head.
“Potter.”
Accepting that none of his friends will change their minds, Harry remains in silence for the rest of the trip home.
“Yeah, well, I say it’s kind of lucky you’re still cooped up in here, mate. Cho’s still pretty steamed about the Blaizing Fire situation.”
Ron doesn’t say anything else, but Harry can see the way his muscles seem to strain beneath his suit.
hasn’t released the names yet.”
Ron inhales some of his drink. “You have your powers’ effects
Malfoy glared down at the table and moved his fingernails across it as though scratching at the grainwork.
They sit side by side in silence for awhile. A single cloud drifts from the right and passes over the moon before continuing to the left horizon.
Blaizing Fire’s head turns as he follows Harry’s walk from the entrance to the seat across from him.
was showing you young heroes the new piece of evidence dropped off by detectives in an ongoing investigation. While you were all supposed to analyze it in due time, you,
The crowd slows, but not by much. Eventually, they all figure out a vague order in which to exit, and their escape goes much more smoothly.
Dracon rolls around so he lies on his back. “Ah. You seem to have forgotten the detail of me and my cohorts having stolen from a government agency. A high federal offence. And that what we stole is deliberately meant to
Placing a gentle hand on one of Harry’s arms, Apha Bee’s face turns serious even as parts of his beard begin to rise up from electricity. “All right,
“Not even going to speak to me, Blaise?” Harry’s near enough to hear the tremble in his voice below the angry bravado.
“We don’t really know anything like that for sure. But what we do know is pretty damning.”
Harry has his hand trained on the villain in an instant.
“And they agreed to keep within your reach—”
. They’ve been going at it for upwards of three years against London’s villains; yet they’re supposed to believe that their enemies have just now realized the heroes have had to have gone on record to be in accordance with the law? Unlikely.
He wonders how long they’ve been going at it.
“More like a good name for myself.” A few seconds pass in silence before Harry realizes what he said.
The villain’s face is turned slightly towards the arm reaching out, so Harry can see that the black under-mask he wears is as severely damaged as the rest of his suit. Normally, the under-mask functions as a generic coverall. All the Villain Agency members wear them. They cover the entire head like a ski mask with no mouth hole and the eye holes done up with white fabric. Harry remembers calling him Venom the first time he saw it, and Paper Dracon sputtering comically before sending a particularly nasty barrage of attacks at Harry. Since then, Harry has learned that Paper Dracon wears the dragon skull face mask for identification.
Ron points to Harry and motions to the right, and then he gestures to himself and to the   left.
“Y-you did. And for that, I’m grateful. But last time, and even before that, I don’t think I really knew why I didn’t bring him in. It was just this weird feeling I had.”
Spinning on his heal, he spots the figure sitting on the higher part of the roof where the slanted sections come together. Her feathered, blue butterfly mask looks grey in the moonlight.
Thinking back to the kind of injuries Dracon had that night, Harry agrees with that assessment.
Caught off guard, Harry nearly swallows his tongue. “Uh . . . the public good?”
“All right?”
“You as well,” Blaizing Fire states.
“How’d you know it turned toward one of the figures?”
, never change, hero. Never change.”
learn,” he says with a sneering tone.
Harry recognizes Paper Dracon’s humorless laugh. “No. I’m under no illusions. If I was, I might I have tried to go with him.” A loud coughing fit halts his words, and, when he next speaks, his voice comes out hoarse. “But I . . . . I did this for myself. A lifetime of having my future, my actions, and my path, planned, coerced, and laid out for me—For once in my life, I made a decision that felt like a choice.”
Her head tilts. “What would that solve?”
“Malfoy, why wouldn’t he—”
Wasting no time, Dracon drags Harry over to the wall where a medium-sized, latched door resides. He yanks it open and shoves Harry through.
“It’s been nearly three years since you’ve debuted as a hero. They should’ve stopped on their own.”
Once he finishes showering, Harry puts his pajamas on, tosses his regular clothes into the hamper, and heads downstairs to the kitchen.
by the Ministry to—”
Harry thinks that statement is pretty rich. When he stands up, nothing but a head’s difference in height exists between them.
“All right, sure. I’m Harry Potter, but I’m not sure you’re Draco Malfoy. Draco’s been missing for a month.”
Harry’s voice cracks the first time he opens his mouth to use it, so he tries again. “Did we get them all back? Or are there files missing?”
beneath his right foot. Looking down, he sees the dragon skull mask, now with its left horn completely severed from the main body of the mask, as well as a series of spider web-like cracks splintering across its face from Harry’s initial point of contact with his foot.
Harry wonders if Paper Dracon knows Fire took his own mask off during his second to last interrogation session and that many top heroes saw what he looks like.
Like he hasn’t heard that one before. “I’ve found it depends on who you ask.”
“Come on—gonna make me say it, huh? Okay—okay, fine. All of them—every one of them—they—they’ve
them at will too.”
Several shot glasses and a wine bottle clunk onto the table, and Ron reclaims his seat.
in?” Dracon asks.
Three figures stand on that roof’s edge closest to the burning building, hands outstretched.
“Wait, I really did inspire you to become a hero?” Cho seems mystified. “I thought you’d just said that first time we met to make me feel welcomed back at the Order.”
“Okay. So, the Agency villain took off his outer mask while fighting the robot . . . .”
“Eh—Excuse me?”
. Her-
“Ron . . . .”
In the second it takes for Harry to be swarmed in white, he realizes he should have said something smarter, like
He opens his mouth to answer.
He and Ron casually leave the queue and head for a café across the street.
seems to shake herself. In an uneven voice, she says, “E-excuse me,” and exits the room.
“O-oh.” Harry doesn’t quite succeed in muffling his laugh and pays for it with a glare from Ron. “Yeah, they’d probably have it locked, considering who we’ve got in there.”
“Sorry,” Harry mumbles for the eightieth time as well. He doesn’t move his gaze from the shadowed ceiling of the medical ward.
“How could you have let one of them get away?” Her voice is hard.
His mind jumps around for what to say. “What’s your favorite brand of tea?”
Hermione frowns. “I hope they’re okay.”
A heavy feeling settling inside him, Harry heads off in the direction of the glow. He’s well outside his patrol route of Shoreditch when he realizes he is heading in toward the Hero Order’s headquarters. The dread inside him grows as he picks up his pace.
Gathering his courage to him, Harry blurts out, “I’ve always been a fan of your work!”
Harry turns his head to get a better look at the newcomers, some of their conversation washing out due to a combination of his panting breaths and the ringing in his ears and the villain groaning next to him.
From his position on the street, Harry can see almost directly into the flats affected. The front door to the complex stands wide open, and movement is visible inside.
“I don’t want revenge. I want justice.”
“I said, get out!”
. His watch is dead from the earlier jolt he’d taken from it.
The villain’s shoulders uncurl, but he still holds himself rigid as Harry—aided by his Supersuit—reels in the current flowing through his hands and gently reaches for his broken leg.
Potter’s lips press tight together as he searches Draco’s face—likely for traces of the schoolyard bully who tormented him not that long ago. Then he allows Draco to pull him right in front of the mirror.
. What stands out the most are several of the Supervillains in the crowd. The more his eyes adjust, the more villains he can see, and the more he realizes that the heroes fighting are sorely outnumbered.
“You’re not calling me weak again, are you, hero?”
Approaching the swearing villain, Harry cautiously lays a hand against his arm. “I don’t know what’s going through your head, but what happened is probably not what you’re—”
Sighing, he tugs on his beard. “Yes, the more experienced heroes haven’t been in lately. But, really, it wouldn’t be right for me, or anyone else, to place the sole responsibility of learning the Villain Agency’s plans on the younger generation. And especially considering the heroes who had their true identities stolen by the Agency are most at risk, it’s only fair that they should receive the comfort of knowing the Hero Order is doing its best to thwart the plot by having those same heroes be the top officials working the case.
Poppy Petal’s Control over Herbs allows her to speed up the healing process once they enter the body of her patients, as well as amplify their effects. Once she’s finished, Harry feels much more relaxed and less like his appendages want to fall off.
Paper Dracon is lying on his back with his left leg splayed far out—while his right bends his heel toward his body. His right arm stretches above his head as though reaching out for the dragon skull mask several meters away, but the hand stays limp. His left arm remains on his chest, hand twisted in the black fabric over his heart—which Harry hopes still beats.
“She believes a few more days of bed rest and not using my powers should bring me back to my normal self.”
Lowering his hand, Harry discretely shifts it over to his opposite wrist and feels out for a pulse.
“I’m not a monster who attacked all those people. You’re all wasting your time here with me when the real one’s still out there—I mean, I don’t even
He has to grip his elbows and hunch over from the chill breeze suddenly cutting right through him.
Closing his eyes, Potter takes a moment to consider. “No,” he breathes. “Or not as much. I—meeting Ms. Adams and Mr. Park... that helped, I think. All of us. Feel less alone in this. And—and being here...” His lips turn upward as he opens his eyes to look around the room and then stops them on Draco. “You came here for me?”
Harry fought a chill. “Another time. I’ll tell you about that another time.”
Harry shifts his gaze upward when silence greets him and finds almost everyone fixated on him.
“Meaning you’re not here, sir,” Harry says, “if the villains have most of the older pro-heroes’ files.”
“Sorry, you can’t bet. This is solitaire, and I’m the only one playing.”
“Do you know who stole the boat?”
cried. And he’s—he’s his own monster now and still...he—” Potter’s baleful eyes search Draco’s face. “What does that make me?”
Granger puts her hand on Draco’s arm, drawing his attention to her face. “I think,” she says, clearly choosing her words with care, “you’re handling it better than most.”
And everything was suddenly so terrible because this game was meant to cheer Draco up, but he looked so
From the moment he met him, Harry knew that Draco Malfoy had terminally caught pretension from an early age. As it stood, judging by the ghost sitting at his kitchen table with the ankle of one leg resting on the knee of the other, arms crossed against his chest, and two ghostly baby peacocks fluttering around him, death had not managed to disinfect him of this affliction. All Harry had wanted was a glass of milk from the fridge to pretend it would keep the nightmares from the War at bay, tricking himself into finally falling asleep, but like peace and solitude, rest was apparently too much to ask for.
Mrs. Figg continues looking at Tracey. “
“I say we knock this smart-arse around some more until he tells us what we want to know,” the small villain says.
“Hey, Malfoy.”
This close, Harry can hear his ragged pants of breath, and he wonders what kind of torture Voldemort meant. But he can’t think on it. The more time he wastes, the more likely he is to be discovered by the wrong people and blow the whole operation. Plus, being in the same room with the evil robot invention sets his skin crawling.
“So you’re trying to claim your death was dignified?”
Finally, he reaches the edge of the ditch. Stomach pressed flat to the earth and body tense, he gingerly peeks over the bank.
“Sure, but it’s always good to check.”
Slumping against the table, he can hear voices chattering around him. Just like with the shouting, Harry can’t make out what they’re saying. Out of his periphery, he can see that sparks still jump from the arm, but its glow has died down again with its movement. Hands are on him, and faces swim before him as he passes out.
“D’you reckon it’s smart to bring a Supervillain into the very heart of our operations?” Ron leans on the wall next to the door, leg propped up against its vertical surface.
Harry’s not quick enough, and the villain hits the ground, hard. He winces in sympathy as a loud groan rises from Dracon. When he goes to lift Dracon back into a sitting position on the alley wall after momentarily powering down to not shock him, he’s limp in Harry’s hands. Wondering if he’s passed out, Harry’s careful not to jostle any of his other injuries, let alone the broken leg.
wasn’t treated. No splint, no nothing. Hell, it had been let go so long that the bone reset wrong.”
“Mmm, you really haven’t gotten much out of Blaise, have you?” Dracon seems to say this mostly to himself.
Though, to be fair to himself, he’s only one person whereas they’re two.
“And—” Harry takes a breath. “And do you remember what their masks looked like?”
There has been at least one attack happening each day over the last few days, starting with the Mad-Eye incident. Seems like the Hero Order is going to be finding out the Villain Agency’s plans without Blaizing Fire around just fine.
Blaizing Fire jerks his head away from where he’s continued to bore a hole into Harry’s head, ruffled at being addressed in such a manner. “Pardon?”
want.” He tilts his head further, maintaining eye contact. “You want to bite me, don’t you, Potter?”
When the three heroes exit the building, they come face to face with multiple police units, some ambulances, and
Blaizing Fire lifts his head from its perch on his hand as he evidently watches Harry shuffle the deck and deal to them both. “Not really up to it this time either. Find yourself a different playmate.”
“It attacked them?”
She nods. “By the time backup arrived and burst down the door, I was nearly unconscious and Ced—he was . . . .” She chokes off again and doesn’t finish the thought. “I was told afterward that the remaining robotic creatures that ambushed us self-destructed once the heroes burst in. They’d barely shielded us from the blast—it had destroyed all other evidence.” She leans her head onto Harry’s shoulder. “Not even Ced's autopsy gave any answers.”
Hermione nods. “Good way to look at it.” She stands and brushes herself off. “I’ll pass your suggestion of shifting the patrolling schedule around to
“She won’t get in trouble for...” His hand hovered over the three fresh dirt mounds.
He needs to focus.
“Could you see what he was wearing?”
“Harry, speak slower, please.”
“Anyway, enough about us, Harry,” Hermione says. “What happened?”
“Hmm, yes. Partly.” Her breath ghosts before her face before dispersing in the air. “You see, it’s my fault he died."
Harry’s teeth snap together with a
“. . . reason I came back.”
“Didn’t have much else to offer.”
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry reaches across the gap between them to pat him on the knee. “To be honest, I think you do deserve to face
Closing his eyes, Harry hears a rustling noise, and then feels something being placed over his head.
He stares at the handle to the door with uncertainty for a few more minutes, juggling the two items
Draco’s breath quickens in a hopefully unnoticeable way as Potter’s thumb starts to massage back and forth while he thinks.
Harry thinks.
“Hang on.” Hermione’s nose scrunches as she thinks. “Harry, didn’t you say you found him unconscious?”
Fingers catch on Draco’s sleeve.
“Wait, why would you have to quit just because your powers aren’t working as well?”
“What? No! Your friends—”
She jumps up and waves her hands before his face as if to silence him.
Draco grits his teeth.
Once Draco’s department knows what to look for, it’s not too long before they locate several victims that match well enough to the description Potter gave; being much more recent attacks, a greater likelihood exists that the vampire hasn’t shifted in appearance—which means better chances of tracking the creature down. And true to his own word, Draco contacts Potter about it.
“I dunno. Do you really think he would go to the trouble of handing me the letter if his plan was to trap you there?  I mean, it was very likely that I would have looked at the letter myself, so it’s not like I wouldn’t know where you were.”
Looking up to the top crate, Harry can make out a single figure standing in the dull lighting of the warehouse. “I hope that, unlike the first time we met, you don’t have any cronies crawling around.”
Shifting his gaze from his ruined game of solitaire to Alpha Bee, Harry numbly nods his head.
Looking over his shoulder, he calls out, “
“Could ask you the same . . . Sir.”
He has the decency to blush and look away. “Oh. Right. Didn’t know that.”
at his throat. The fact that the rest of him remains far away from Draco hardly dulls the spike of adrenaline that shoots through his veins. Suddenly sharply aware of his surroundings, Draco also realises that in his moment of reminiscing, he’d taken another step toward Potter. Draco mentally swears at himself.
Against the wood, he says, “I’ll tell you what I know about him. I know that he was dead and in the ground for at least three months before he ‘borrowed’ that boat.”
“No!” Hermione shouts. “They’ve got inside!”
“We’re not friends.” Still, the way he feels much lighter is undeniable to Harry.
“None of the public’s allowed in to see any of the victims of last night’s incident.”
Mrs. Figg says no more. Instead she’s grasping at the edges of her coat, but they keep slipping through her fingers.
“I know, Potter—let’s make things a little more interesting, shall we?” Draco raises his brows; upping the ante to the degree he wants to could get dangerous, but he has a point to make, damn it. “Here, now—don’t let go.”
Er . . . Uh. No. No, I didn’t look for anyone else. Figured they’d be long gone. And, uh, his injuries were far too generic.”
Before he’s even aware of what he’s doing, Harry walks out of the alley and down the street. His fingers shake where they clutch at his own fabric.  Taking in a rattled breath beneath a streetlight, Harry wonders what the hell he thinks he’s doing. He spins on his heel and heads back to the alleyway, but he finds it empty of any trace of Paper Dracon.
“Been job hunting.”
be the best person to get me to say
An odd ache starts to form in Harry’s chest cavity.
“Like, what?” Ginny tightly crosses her arms. “Your Superhero instinct?”
Several beats passed before Malfoy finally said, “Yeah, okay.”
“You turned the bastard in, right?” Ron asks.
Apart from being in multiple pieces now, what Harry had observed about the mechanical arm remains true. Now, the wiring is in smaller pieces and completely ripped apart in others. Smaller bits of the grey metal litter a good portion of the box’s inside.
“Seriously? What on earth could you do, as a ghost, with excess body parts—of other ghosts?!”
Harry paces in the narrow path empty of junk and storage boxes. Finally, he stops and says, “So, you know how I went to talk to the witness today?”
. I need you to stop now! So, I can get you down.”
“Wha—” Malfoy’s mouth hung open. “Where did they go?!”
look up my alias.”
“Hmm, so why ‘Izulu’?”
Grasping hold of Dracon’s wrist right before the manacle encircles it, Harry brings it closer to his face for inspection. He rubs his thumb along the fault line where the two sides of the cylinder connect.
letting me go?”
Prancing Peacock continues, “I still don’t understand. If you had no delusions about the matter . . . ?”
“Damn, forgot about the explosion.”
Finally, though, the room comes into focus. It’s a wide space with pillars scattered throughout. Harry spots some chains attached to the walls. As he looks around, movement catches his eye, and he realizes how many
But the hand of one of the cops landing heavily on Harry’s shoulder and his dismissive “We’ll handle it from here” causes Harry to straighten. The tightening of the man’s grip after the unwitting zap he gets for touching Harry when he’s unaware sets Harry’s teeth on edge. “We’ll also have to ask you some questions, of course.”
Compelled by the spell of Potter’s gaze, words tumble from Draco’s mouth unbidden. “Thank you. For coming back.”
Justin swings the door open, wearing a yellow pullover and blue jeans. He double-takes on seeing Harry—meaning to Harry that the guy had been so incautious as to open the door without checking through the peephole first. “I-
“Control over . . . Bodies?”
the London sewage system!”
Hermione looked away, her chest heaving once up and down. “Yes, well... Don’t thank me yet. You’re not free from this place.”
While Harry had figured that that crime would end up being one best handled by heroes, he’s still shocked that the police handed over evidence knowing that he’s particularly invested in the case. But the surprise swiftly shifts to a budding dread that blooms in his stomach like an infecting fungus. The case must either not be going well, or the situation is worse than he—or the cops—had originally imagined.
“Just . . . .” Tracey pops her head out the door and glances around. “Come inside. Quickly.”
They both turn to look at him when they see movement in their periphery.
The children spend the next ten minutes arguing who gets to have Harry on their team. Charlie Jenkins ends up settling the matter when he says that whoever has Harry on their team would be at an unfair advantage because Harry is a Superhero. The other three agree with him. So that’s how it ends up being a game of four against one.
Molten lava moves through Draco’s veins and burns him from the inside out at the sensation of Potter’s hand wrapping around his wrist. Eyes probably fever-bright, Draco can’t help but to egg him on. “Come on, Potter. You’re going to have to try harder than that. I can have my wand in my other hand and you Petrified in a second.”
“Far,
on you would—”
! Now I know you’re taking the piss.”
“Why would I say it if I wasn’t?”
Draco flashes Potter a pained grimace. “I don’t think that’s a good—”
Harry opens his mouth to speak, but, finally, self-preservation awakens within him. Is he really willing to risk revealing to so many people what Izulu really sounds like? Cutting off his words, nothing but a wheezy gust of air comes out. All right then. Should he power now? His muscles ache at the thought.
I’m an Auror in-training, and I couldn’t even tell my date was a vampire! Not by any of the other interactions we had. Nothing!”
Monday, Harry’s back at school with his friends. While he’s grateful for their excitement at having him back, he’s less grateful for the workload he now has to go through since he missed a full week. The amount he must do to catch up compounds the stress of
or I had. There was at least no reason to keep her!”
and the seniors of the Agency, and therefore the point changes day to day.”
Harry winces. He really should stop holding important conversations when beaten and knackered out of his mind. “Not the best choice of words, I admit. I just meant why would you come to an intense fight knowing your powers would be—uh—disadvantaged in this weather?”
“And I told
“Was anybody taken this time?”
Still, Harry decides to hold onto the piece he’s grabbed. While he doesn’t want to take any evidence from the scene of the crime if the detectives aren’t finished gathering what they need, he also doesn’t want to leave evidence with his fingerprints on it to add an unnecessary complication. Additionally, there’s plenty of material left for the detectives and police to find when they decide to search the perimeter of the building—and they'd also have the added benefit of knowing whether the material belongs to any of the victims. If he finds anything of note regarding the cloth, he’ll pass the information along to the appropriate people.
The feeling of electricity opening and flooding the well-worn channels throughout his body has never more felt like fire. When he comes back to himself, Harry doesn’t know how much time has passed or when he braced himself against the wall. But when he looks at his arms, he sees the telltale glow of his power on the scars that elongated from his forehead. Sparks and electrical bursts jump along his medical gown. Harry can feel his hair standing back on end, having not been pressed back down in the first place after he’d been knocked out.
“It’s not—none of them are—”
“Ch-Cho!” Harry hops off the counter at the same time that he powers back up.
“Really? How long?” Ron asks.
“He attacked me with one of his giant paper swans. Think he flew away on another one while I was distracted.”
He takes a little longer to collect himself this time.
Finally, Cho inhales deeply and draws her pale hand away from her face. “This giant
“I don’t know. But I hope to find out.”  He looks to Alpha Bee.
as a hero knowing that?”
“Department of Creature Incidents. We’re here to collect your statements.” Draco waits an interval of three minutes before knocking again. “Please, open up.”
“Right. Well, um...” Harry cast about for more to say, and his eyes caught the motion of the peachicks. “So what’s with the little...”
“Oh, it’s fine. Perfectly fine. I’d been thinking this way since I sent in my complaint to the Ministry. The only thing you did was just further prove to me that—”
“Step closer to me.”
, whatever the hell that meant. Harry wanted to stay and find out.
“It’s still raining though.”
“What? I—” He involuntarily looks over at the pot on the hob’s back burner instead of the salted cabbage off to its right on the counter, then back at Draco. “I mean, that was
“Damn.”
She stops and turns her head towards him, the decorative blue feathers on her blue butterfly face mask swaying. “Alpha Bee, I wasn’t aware that the new generation of heroes knew of me.”
“Enough of it. I—” he paused. “I held some resentment towards them, my parents. For what they did during the war. For what they raised me into. It was... nice, hearing her apologize, even if she only half understood why she should.”
Both of their heads whip around to face Harry. But it’s Cho who marches toward him.
“Proper villain?” Harry mumbles, voice cracking slightly from puberty. He’s spent most of the last three years following the adventures of the Superhero duo Cho & Ced before their sudden retirement from the hero scene this year; compared to the Supervillains those two faced, the only thing about this bloke that measures up is his costume. Although, that’s one thing the villain has on Harry—a proper costume.
“That’s just it!” Potter bursts up from his chair and paces back and forth. “There were no signs! At least not any of the usual ones! We’d see each other regularly out in daylight; there was no vampiric aura or distinct vampiric traits—not even during our… our—date. No-not—”
“I’m a Slytherin. And a coward. Do you really think that if there was any doubt in my mind you wouldn’t bite me, I’d let you this close? That I’d
When Harry makes his way to the rain-slicked rooves again, curtains of water descend upon London. He debates heading home now when an odd orange glow in the distance catches his attention.
When they enter the dim light of the shop, Draco is accosted almost immediately by the owner. “Ah, Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to see you!” He reaches for Draco’s right hand and grasps it in both of his. “What a pleasure! Tell me, what can I do for you?”
“Every official hero has had to register with them—Look! Here’s
heroes. I’m sure after I spend my life sentence, my ghost will make an excellent do-gooder haunting my cell.”
Turning back around, Harry sees Dracon in almost the same position he’d left him in. Only the tense set of the villain’s shoulders betray how much those two words must have cost him.
With caution, Harry deftly had followed two men inside a bustling kitchen as they returned from dropping the rubbish outside. Just as reported, the chaos in the kitchen afforded Harry the cover he needed to slip into the main section of the large house.
“I doubt our encounters would be as interesting otherwise,” Harry says. “So, why are you letting me go?”
He continues his route to Whittington Hospital by roof, rather than opting to walk amongst the crowd where anyone can reach out and demand a two-hour boat search.
“Harry, none of this is your fault,” Hermione says.
“Me,” Harry says in return. He takes off the fiery skull mask since he doesn’t like the sound his electricity’s making against its surface.
The children jump and shield their eyes at first when he floods the darkened street with his electrical glow, but, upon recognizing his voice, they swarm him. “
For a moment, Harry considers covering his face again, but he decides against it.
“You had to have tortured him.” His voice rises until he’s shouting. “There’s no way in hell he’d give it up otherwise.”
“You still can’t see no patients like that,” Nurse Moody says.
Gathering his energy to him, he feels it travel faster and stronger from the scar on his forehead down the channels opening up along his body. He can see the light emanating from his suit now on the back of his eyelids; he feels the electrical energy building up to the tips of his fingers.
“Excellent,” Harry said.
Ron doesn’t miss it either as he smirks. “Don’t like it much when the shoe’s on the other foot, huh?”
“Yes, but the villains are no doubt using something similar to my powers to do this to people. How can I feel at ease about that? How can I feel at ease about
Dracon snorts and turns his head away. “You’re just going to lay there and lie to my face?”
“Yes, I thought so.” Alpha Bee pushes himself onto the counter and folds his hands into his lap. “And if you look through, you’ll notice most of the people listed are new heroes. The younger generation.”
“I know,” comes Ron’s voice from somewhere behind Harry, almost equally as pained.
While Harry scores three times, he lets each of the children steal it off him to score once each. After the fourth and final goal, Harry falls to his knees in the wet street and lifts his head to the grey sky. “Ack! You have defeated me!” Then he powers down and collapses onto his back, arms spread wide and water soaking in.
Playlist track: "Poison and Wine" by The Civil Wars.
“Harry James Potter, if you don’t get your arse up in five seconds…”
The Malfoy sheen was gone, hair dulled, dignity erased.
“You don’t need to tell me that it was our fault,” Draco walked over to a table with a decanter of some brown liquor, removing the stopper and swallowing a generous mouthful, “I know what we are.”
“How long have you known?”
“Oh, God,” Harry licked, gentle, around Draco’s entrance, and pressed his tongue in, “Fuck, Harry.”
“Uh-huh,” Al folded up the invisibility cloak, which had gotten them into and kept them out of trouble too many times to count, and flopped down onto the bed next to Scorp.
“Like you didn’t want to.”
God, they were really talking about this.
Draco’s legs clenched and released and kicked at his back.
“University next year?”
“Making up for my uneventful teen years, I guess.”
“Sorry,” he kissed the top of Draco’s head, “Just thinking.”
“I’m glad you took this place,” Draco murmured.
Open up your heart to me
He still found that hard to believe, even though - he needed that love so desperately.
“That’s a bit of an exaggeration.”
It felt fantastic.
He pulled back to catch Draco’s eyes, which were clear and entirely guileless as he shook his head.
“That’s what I thought.”
“I was so scared. I was stupid, and I… And then I had what I’d thought would be the perfect life,” he took Draco’s left hand, held it, and Merlin, his skin was still so soft, “The life that I imagined since I was a kid. That I thought I was supposed to have.
“Yeah, ‘course.”
“Very nice,” she crossed her arms, manicured nails tapping against her elbows.
“Alright,” and in a whisper, “Just try, would you?”
“Wicked.”
“I assume you’re letting Ginevra keep the house. You’ll need a new one.”
So much of those years, with his two best friends, was watching them snipe, be jealous, be possessive - reject each other, need each other. The three of them were busy saving the world (and if he were completely honest, it was probably Hermione doing the bulk of the saving) but they were also - Ron and Hermione - they struggled. They fought.
“Hermione, he’s fine.”
“Nothing with you, I assure you,” Malfoy sneered. “No, I need to talk to Potter. Alone.”
“Hey Potter,” he drawled, sneering happily, “what do you think of Filch’s mangy old cat?”
Harry lay in bed inside the empty boys dorm and realized he couldn’t stop thinking about it even if he wanted to.
It didn’t last long.
He was walking with Ron and Hermione when they saw Malfoy standing in the middle of the hall, waiting. Harry vaguely remembered that the last time he’d seen Malfoy alone was the second time he’d caught him, the day of the kiss
“Hey Harry, do you reckon Malfoy’s gotten a bit worse recently?” Ron said on the third day after Harry’s recovery.
“...I couldn’t find one.”
“Of course not! It’s just…” he grit his teeth, “just...How?”
in any way. That would be
Ron settled down next to him, looking properly pitying. “I’m sure you want nothing more to do with the prick.”
“Mornin’ Harry,” Ron yawned as he walked down the stairs, somehow the first one to wake. Any remaining sleepiness was gone in an instant when he noticed the dark bags under his friend’s eyes.
Before he knew it he was throwing open the doors to the dining hall. Dinner had already started and the tabled were laden with food; he walked briskly toward the Gryffindor table, ignoring the stares that followed him.
“Malfoy. Alone.”
“What do you want, Malfoy?”
Palms beginning to sweat, Malfoy felt the gazes of his friends burn into the back of his head. They were expecting him to go. Not wanting to look like a coward, he reluctantly nodded his head.
“I can’t wait to hear the stories! Do you think Filch has found out?” His tone was both mirthful and cruel, and his laughter echoed through the halls. Parkinson in particular hung on his every word. “I hope it never wears off, I want to see it!”
“...So you’re better then?”
” The grip on his arms tightened and Malfoy winced.
Now rather than enraged he seemed more frustrated and exasperated, the look in his eyes much more Harry-like. Malfoy finally found his voice.
Malfoy froze. His mouth suddenly felt dry. “What?”
“Ah, Potter, I was just looking for you-”
“I don’t want to be the only one suffering, Potter! I want you to be thinking about me as much as I’ve had to think about you!”
“Okay, be careful mate.”
Instead of answering, Harry grabbed Malfoy’s collar and threw him up against the wall. His eyes shone with an anger so bright he no longer looked familiar--it looked more like he was channeling the spirit of some incredibly cruel bully.
She fell silent, still fraught with worry. They stood still, the quiet heavy and tense around them, before Harry’s snore filled the room.
Malfoy, is this your idea of a joke? Did you want me to notice you that badly?”
They deserved it, he told himself, they deserved everything they got and worse. Either way, he had no other way to vent his mounting frustration.

“...It was… for us.”
“...I thought you’re against things like making others do things they’re not willing to.”
Although they had lost their political power, those conservative purebloods had wealth and network. They still had influence on people who were loyal to them. Their grip on various institutions across the Kingdom wasn’t inconsiderable either. Alienating the entire group would only prove to be harmful.
Harry shook his head off the cobwebs of his carefreer past. “Greetings, Lord Malfoy. Thank you for coming.”
“You screwed up really badly, Theo,” Zabini’s proud voice could be heard from the gap between the wall and the door. “You were lucky Lord Tartaglia interrupted when he did. It’s akin to stumbling out of the frying pan into the fire, though!”
“We are presented with enchanted robes upon enrollment. The robes will change in size according to the wearer and change colour as the learning of the wearer increases, beginning a faint pink colour and becoming gold if top grades are achieved in every magical subject,” [4] the Head Girl elaborated patiently.
But Malfoy didn’t budge. “Your Majesty, my understanding is that time is of the essence to reassure Petra’s divided population,” he explained logically. “I have gone through the necessary rituals to prepare my body to be a carrier since the betrothal between House Malfoy and House Li was committed. I am fully ready to carry a child to term now, while it will take Syaoran eighteen months at the very least, before he can even be pregnant. And once I marry you through pureblood marriage rituals, I can’t father his child.”
“Yes, Your Majesty!” The messenger ran as though his heels were on fiendfyre.
To Nott, after much deliberation, Harry wrote very frankly, ‘
Also simple and straight to the point. And cold.
Harry was undeterred. “I will be happy to extend the invitation to Quentin’s significant other as well as any number of people they find essential.”
Malfoy blinked profusely, but the effort was futile. The sobs quickly turned to waterfall. He curled into himself. “T-thank you. I-I si-simply c-can’t th-thank you enough-”
Harry nodded. “Till next time,” he dismissed the blonde with a heavy heart.
Harry turned to find Hermione with her brows furrowed, and the Mahoutokoro’s Head Girl, her face arranged into a bland mask of politeness. “Did you take a wrong turn after coming back from the restroom?” her dark eyes twinkled mutely in amusement.
Harry put aside his papers with an inward sigh. There was no stopping his wife once she’d set her mind to have sex with him. Not that he was particularly opposed. Ginny had been strangely horny quite often recently. Once she had settled on top of him, he answered her question. “Pansy Parkinson.”
“I’m glad,” the relief in Little Wolf’s voice sounded genuine.
‘Eye-opening,’ if he were to be truly honest. Zhongli was a pleasant host and rubbing shoulders with him wasn’t such an unusual experience, but the ten minutes he’d spent with the Harbinger, without the amber-eyed man, ranked quite high in the list of things Harry didn’t want to experience again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Besides, Harry also wanted answers.
He didn’t need to say that too many people have died for it to be the same.
Harry’s first knee-jerk reaction was, ‘No!’ He took a deep breath to calm himself. If he didn’t allow for it, Malfoy might eventually think of murdering Harry just to leave him. The current Malfoy may be incapable of murder, but people change. Harry did. “Yes,” he answered after a moment, “but it will be unilateral. You will have to convince me.” Harry raised his hand to stop the arguments forming in the blonde’s mouth. “I hope you are aware that the job of the Second Consort I am legalised to marry is to represent the interests of the conservative pureblood faction. The long-term goal is to remove the divide between Petra’s citizens, so that we can all live harmoniously without breaking into another civil war. Only after this duty is reasonably fulfilled, can the Second Consort divorce the King.”
“Really?” As he turned to the Ravenclaw, he saw a glimpse of the red hair of the girl walking on the other side of Luna. Blue eyes met his briefly before Ginny gave a curt nod, and looked away quickly.
A callous hand wrapped around his and squeezed reassuringly, the bumps on his palm a reminder to Draco of how seriously Little Wolf practiced sword-fighting. “How are your Mother and Father?” Little Wolf’s voice was hesitant.
Malfoy threw his gaze. “You’re making this awkward, Lady Granger… I am just doing my duty.”
“I’m sorry,” the King didn’t know what else to say. “Malfoy didn’t look well.” It wasn’t technically a lie.
Harry peered at the elderly Potion Masters. “Your niece…” he tried again.
Harry didn’t know, so he heaped everything onto his trolley.
“It’s beneficial for both of us,” Malfoy spoke faster, desperation starting to tinge his tone. “There is a reason why both of you came to Petra, and not Kesha, or Goryeo.”
Meanwhile, Zhongli was staring at Malfoy in surprise, as though he wasn’t expecting to see such a familiar face. “You are.. Yelan’s son’s fiance. Or… former fiance, rather.” Those amber eyes zeroed in on the prominently displayed peridot choker, and then dropped to Malfoy’s protruding belly. “The child you’re carrying… is still of Li blood.”
As Harry lay face down in his bed, for the first time in his life, he couldn’t help but thank Merlin for having a separate bedroom from his wife.
the King thought, somewhat bitterly.
“I’m tired, Harry,” the Queen rested her hand on the visible bulge of her stomach, covered by the cascade of a cornflower blue wool dress. It was almost the end of her second trimester, if Harry tracked correctly. Pregnancy suited her; she was glowing most of the time he saw her.
“I barely slept at all,” Hermione’s cheerful tone was at odds with her words. “There is just so much to read about Snezhnaya, I could only skim the surface-.”
“That place,” Harry shrugged “is a disincentive for me to return to finish my schooling, really.” He pursed his lips and bowed his head.
Wasn’t childbirth supposed to be one of the most painful experiences imaginable?
It was Malfoy who saved him. “Your Majesty, maybe you heard wrongly,” the blonde pasted a smile on his face. Harry recognised that mask; he’d seen it not budge under the onslaught of threats and insults. “Great-uncle-in-law, I would like to introduce you to the King of Petra.”
Little Wolf only shook his head at Draco, his gaze turning…affectionate. “My Mother didn’t choose you for that.”
Malfoy’s fists retreated under the wide brim of his sleeves. Harry suspected the blonde was clenching them tightly out of view. “Yes, Your Majesty,” his reply was calm and even. “Han’s temperate climate has always suited Mother better.”
Cold sweat began to drip from Slughorn’s temple. “Yes, he is! Quentin has a sweetheart there; he’s been writing so much about her in his owls to me…”
Yet, not all monsters were evil.
Other gifts were appreciated more enthusiastically, each accompanied with bright eyes and a monologue.
Ginerva Weasley looked at the man she’d just married less than a year ago with hope on her beautiful face. “Harry, you won’t buy into this bullshit, won’t you?”
“Then don’t do it!” She looked like she was going to cry. “Macnair was just a crazy fanatic! We managed to subdue his gang, didn’t we!?”
Indeed, Zhongli replied with a genuine smile. “I will be delighted.”
Could they?
Zhongli’s expression turned pensive. “I see… Yelan’s prophecy…” he murmured.
“Oh, that’s interesting!” Hermione remarked, a hundred questions bubbling in her mind.
The green-eyed wizard turned to his best friend. At first, she looked equally lost, but as Malfoy went on, understanding began to dawn on her.
“Horace,” Harry used the permission straight away. It was Slughorn’s loss. “I have missed you, your brilliance and keen insight. Wouldn’t you come to my court?”
As the blonde was occupied, Harry sidled closer to Hermione. “What have you been able to find out?”
“Cousin-in-law has brought such marvellous gifts,” the amber-eyed man showed them off one by one. “Isn’t he just so thoughtful?”
“Childe,” Zhongli’s face transformed at the sight of the newcomer. He cheered up, all previous melancholy gone. “I’ve saved them for you, of course. Xiao!”
Silence dawned upon young and older magicians alike. They were all recalling when the young woman spoke up in favour of turning Harry over to King Voldemort toward the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, where they were all huddling for shelter in the bombarded fortress.
The proper thing to do was to let go of Malfoy’s hand, but young Nott only gripped that hand tighter. “I-I’m sorry. I know I don’t deserve forgiveness. I know I could have taken your place… and you wouldn’t have to be here. I-I know y-you’re fond of Syaoran, and he holds you dear, and-” his voice was breaking.
