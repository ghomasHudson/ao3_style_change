“Hello Draco,” Dumbledore greets the other boy. “I didn’t expect to see you here.” A puzzled look goes over his face before it returns to a smile.
Harold has no clue how long they kiss. At one hand it feels like it goes on forever and on the other end, it feels like it was only seconds before their lips part again. Draco smiles at Harold and Harold leans in again to kiss those lips once more.
Potter stands in front of the Dark Lord. His arms to his sides, his face determent. A cut is visible on his left cheek, with a blood trail running down to his chin. Draco can’t believe the idiot has come. Doesn’t he know he is going to die now? There is no way the Dark Lord is going to let the boy wonder life. After all these years, Draco will finally be rid of the boy wonder. The thought brings a smile to Draco’s face.
When Harold and Rodolph are both naked, Harold takes the dildo, a strong piece of rope and one of the knives with him to the table that still holds the woman. He lays the tools down and then crawls on the table. He sits on his knees at the edge, his ass on the perfect height for Rodolph to fuck him when he wants to. Harold takes a hold of the woman’s legs and pulls her towards him. Her arms stretch over the table and when Harold leans over he can kiss the woman on her mouth. Harold massages the woman’s breast and bites on her lips. Then he sits up again and takes the rope he brought with him. He places the rope around the woman’s throat and leaves it there, ready for when he feels like choking the bitch.
“Just know, that we will always make sure you are okay. That is all that matters to us,” Bellatrix tells him.
With hesitating steps, he moves towards the door. Ron and Hermione are just in front of him. He can hear their whispers.
“Good,” Uncle Lucius says. And that seals it. The woman won’t die tonight. It’s a shame. Harold would have loved to see how she would find her end. But Rodolph won’t spoil Harry’s birthday sleepover by upsetting Lucius. Because that would mean that Lucius will drag Draco home with him.
“No, they’ll notice,” Harold says. He doesn’t want to get caught by Uncle Lucius.
“You’re delicious,” Greyback tells her. “I’m going to enjoy devouring you.”
Rodolph slides a slick finger into Harold’s ass and Harold leans against his dad’s chest for a second, enjoying the feeling of intrusion. Then he turns his attention back on the bitch in front of him. He takes the spiked dildo and slides it over the woman’s pussy. When his dad pushes a second finger into Harold’s hole, Harold pushes the dildo into the woman’s pussy. The woman screams as Harold fucks her with the dildo. Her legs kick around in an effort to get Harold to stop. Tears well up in her eyes that are wide open.
“Still beautiful,” Draco answers. “Thank you for showing me.”
Harold’s eyes roll into the back of his head and he welcomes the dark around him. He feels lightheaded and at peace. Then liquid fills his throat and mouth. The last thing on Harold’s mind is that it’s warm and tastes funny.
“Yes, fight it. You’re so beautiful, my boy. Taking my cock deep throat,” Rodolph says. He pushes up further into Harold’s throat. Bellatrix laughs next to him as Harold’s world starts to spin. He can’t breathe. And his head hurts. His body shakes, he tries to stay still, but he can’t stop it. His legs slide to the side and tremble. He lays belly down on the bed, his mother on top of him and his dad’s cock in his mouth. He’s going to die now, he’s sure. His parents will kill him to find their pleasure. And maybe that isn’t a bad way to go. That way his parents will always know how much Harold loved them.
Hermione opens them and looks at the blade in front of her face.
“Mommy put an Imperos curse,” Harold starts. He knows he says it wrong but it’s a difficult word. He hopes Draco understands.
“You're in your head again,” Draco pouts.
Harold and his friends watch as Rodolph opens his robes and pulls out his hard cock. He kneels in between the woman’s legs and pushes his cock into her back hole without any preparation. The woman screams in pain and uses her hands to try to crawl away from the intrusion. Rodolph laughs and fucks the woman. It’s enough to get the other man get into the mood. Mr Crabbe also takes out his cock and kneels in front of the woman’s face. He lifts her head and then pushes his cock into her mouth. It doesn’t take the men long before they both finish inside her and pull out. The woman slumps on the floor, some of the sperm leaks out of her mouth.
Harold nods his head and then is rewarded with a proper kiss. He lets his dad's tongue slide into his mouth. Rodolph’s hands slide down Harold’s side, over his hips and up again.
Narcissa’s head starts to hurt the longer she hangs. Her toes slide over the ground, but find no purpose and no relieve for the pain that threatens to burst Narcissa’s head apart. Her body struggles and tears leak freely. The pain is so intense. Narcissa never thought it would hurt this much to die. She wants it to stop. She wants it to be over now. But it just goes on. She needs to stand, needs to find some higher ground to place her feet. Her toes slide over the ground, just too high to stand on, to find some relief. There is no relieve. Narcissa will die. She doesn’t want to die. What if she isn’t reunited with Lucius and Draco? What if she goes to hell and will suffer for all eternity? She can’t do that.
“You hate the cold,” Harold says.
The four boys get up and go to find their fathers. They don’t have to look for long, as the muffled screams of a young woman and the laughs of their fathers lead the way. They are in one of the hallways with stairs. Harold and the other boys sit down with their legs through the railings of the balcony that looks down on that hallway. The woman is naked and sits on the floor. Uncle Lucius turns his wand and the woman quivers. Her arms and legs give out and she convulses on the floor. Her mouth is open in an agonising scream.
Rodolph sits down next to Harold and places a wet kiss on his neck. “You’re sure you don’t want me to take you to bed?”
“Stop it! Let go of me,” Hermione screams. She tries to place her hands on Greyback’s chest to get some leverage so she can push away from him. Only, it’s no use.
“You should get your revenge,” the Dark Lord interrupts. “Take his dignity before we end him. We’ve still got about twenty minutes before we go to the castle to kill all his little friends.”
And then the suffering starts. Narcissa’s body spasms in mid-air as it struggles for breath. The headache is back until it gets so bad that it passes Narcissa out. Only for her to wake again moments later to suffer through it all again. She hangs in a dark place, with nothing in sight. Alone with her agony, as she suffocates over and over again. For a few seconds, she will find relieve as her body gives out, only for it to start all over again. And over again. She’s stuck in an eternal loop of suffocating and dying on a none existing rope for the rest of eternity.
Greyback slices the blade against Hermione’s neck, making small incisions. Hermione lets it happen. She lets her arms hang beside her body. She stares around Narcissa at the tree in front of her. She reads the words engraved in its trunk. Draco Malfoy, the best son that ever lived. The words sound wrong. Malfoy was a bully, a killer. Why did he get a grave, while Harry, Neville and Dean’s bodies will rot in the open air once all this is over?
-x-x-x-x-x-
Greyback’s eyes glitter as he scrapes his claws over Hermione’s face, slicing the skin open and making Hermione bleed. He leans down and licks the blood of Hermione’s face.
“Keep my parents out of this,” Neville spits.
Harold stares up at the stars. His head rests on Draco’s stomach and Draco’s hand plays in Harold’s hair. Greg walks around them, around the balcony and then back into Harold’s room. Vincent is inside, probably still enjoying the food Binky brought them earlier this evening. Tomorrow is Harold’s seventh birthday and that’s why they have a little sleepover. Theo couldn’t make it. Not that Harold minds. He’s not a big fan of Theodore. The boy thinks he’s better than them. Merlin knows why. But he clearly doesn’t like the way Draco and Harold associate with each other. Greg and Vincent on the other hand don’t seem to mind. They’ve seen Harold kiss Draco. Like properly kiss him, with tongue and all. And all they did was raise their shoulders and continue with their game.
“Should we go down?” Greg asks.
“Let’s test how sharp this sword is,” he says. With one swift movement, he lifts the sword and cuts open Narcissa’s stomach. Her intestines fall forward and hang around Narcissa’s legs.
Rodolph lets his head lean back on Bellatrix’s shoulder and only moans.
“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry,” she begs.
Draco opens up for Harold’s small fingers. One finger becomes two, which become three. Before they know it Harold has his entire hand inside Draco’s tiny hole. Draco moans as Harold takes his cock in his mouth. His free hand slides over Draco’s chest until he reaches Draco’s throat. He squeezes it lightly.
Harold likes the kisses the most. The way Rodolph licks into his mouth and moans around his lips is fun. He wants daddy to kiss him all the time. And when Bellatrix joins them in bed, that is all that he needs to do. And let Rodolph push his finger into his hole. Dad loves it, so Harold lets him. It feels strange most of the time, but not bad strange, nice strange. And it almost doesn’t hurt anymore. Rodolph told Harold that it will get better the more they do it, that it will hurt less and less. And then one day, when it doesn’t hurt anymore, Rodolph will show Harold true pleasure by fucking him into the mattress. Harold can’t wait.
“Not if he gets his kicks tonight,” Draco answers. “He’ll be in a good mood when they’re done with the Muggle.”
Her hands grab onto the rope. Narcissa tries to pull herself up, but she’s too weak. She opens her mouth and tries to find air. Her legs start to kick around as the hypoxia starts to take hold. Her body starts to shake and her eyes start to bulge out of their sockets. She loses control of her arms and they fall away from the rope. They hang next to her swirling body for a while, until the convulsions start. Out of Narcissa’s control her body spasms. The rope starts to turn, making Narcissa swing in all kinds of directions. The pain in her head is immense, it feels like her head is going to explode. Her face is turning purple and her tongue pushes itself out of her mouth.
And now it’s Rodolph’s birthday. Uncle Rabastan and Barty have stayed for dinner, promising to bring dad’s birthday present this coming weekend. Harold isn’t sure, but he did hear them mentioning twins. Harold wishes he wasn’t going to be staying with Draco during the weekend. He’s sure that his dad will get twin boys to kill, and Harold would love to see it.
“You just going to stand there?” Potter asks. He sits on his hands and knees on the forest floor. His clothing torn and dirty.
“Still alive. But not for long,” the man says. Dean recognises him. He’s the werewolf Fenrir Greyback. Fenrir pulls the sword out of Dean’s stomach. Dean rolls onto his back from the force. He watches as Fenrir licks some of the blood from the blade.
Bellatrix steps out of the way when the man takes the knife without saying a word. He steps behind his wife, pulls her head back and then slits the knife over her throat. Blood starts rushing out of the cut. Bellatrix breaks the Imperius curse and the woman’s eyes widen. She tries to take a step away from her dead son and her hands fly to her throat. She gurgles up blood and spit. Her husband pushes her head away from him and she falls forward on top of the dead boy. She lays still for a little while and then she makes a strange noise. She pisses herself and then she slides down from the kitchen island, landing face-up on the floor. Harold looks in awe at the dead woman. Her eyes have the same white sheen as the boy.
“Stop,” Harold screams. “I’m six now, I’m too old to be carried.” He slams his hands against Rodolph’s back and they both laugh.
“Stand up, Potter,” Voldemort tells him. “I want you to stand as I kill you.”
“No, not like that,” Rodolph says as he lays down on the bed next to Harold. “Tonight we’re going to show you something beautiful. The pleasure there is to be found in pain is amazing.”
“Oh, my boy. Didn’t your daddy teach you? Never trust the evil Lord. He lies,” the Dark Lord laughs. “Oh wait, I killed him before you even knew how to walk. What a shame.”
“Sleep tight, my boy,” she says.
“I will never leave you,” he says. And then he kisses Draco again. “You are mine from now until the day I die,” he promises.
Harold turns to her again. “Shut up, Muggle,” he tells her.
“It seems that Longbottom has perished,” Voldemort says. Dean looks at the man. His red eyes twinkle and he smiles. “Nicely cooked, isn’t he?” Voldemort jokes.
The sharp blade of the Gryffindor sword pushes softly against Hermione’s neck. Hermione whimpers as Greyback pulls harder on her hair.
Bellatrix walks over to Rodolph and looks at the painting. “He’s a special boy, isn’t he?” she says.
“He’s beautiful,” Rodolph whispers at some point. “You’re sure?” he asks Bellatrix.
“Today we’re going to spoil mom,” Rodolph says. He stands in front of the bed and Harold moves closer so he can unbutton Rodolph trousers.
The Potter house appears before them when Bellatrix falls in line with the Dark Lord.
“Kiss your doom,” Greyback tells her. He pushes Hermione’s face against the blade and Hermione obeys. What other choice does she have? She going to die anyway. And maybe Greyback will kill her quicker if she stops fighting against him. If she stops being fun.
“How?” Harold asks. He places a soft kiss on Rodolph’s pants. Rodolph lets his hand slide through Harold’s hair and pushes his face against his pants. Harold can feel Rodolph’s hard cock. Harold wonders what it tastes like to take it in his mouth, as he’s seen Bellatrix do a couple of times by now. Daddy always likes it when Bellatrix does that to him. Maybe soon, Harold can do the same for his daddy.
Hermione gets pushed onto the ground. She kicks against Greyback and pushes his face away with her hands. She fights with all she’s got to get away from this monster.
“I’m not just a boy,” Harold says. “I’m the boy that is going to kill you. Slowly and painfully.”
Dean’s head starts to pound as he shivers in his blood. His skin is pale and clammy. He can’t stop the shivering that is only becoming worse. He’s so cold, and nothing seems to warm him anymore. His headache worsens and he can only take short quick breaths. They don’t feel enough. It’s harder and harder to breathe.
Rodolph's eyes scan over Draco’s naked body and flushed cheeks. He steps up to them and slides his hand over Harold’s hand on Draco’s throat. “Let me help you,” he says.
“I love you,” Bellatrix says. “Now go back to sleep.” And Harold does just that.
Narcissa looks around her, scanning the trees. There is one close by, at the edge of the clearing, that has beautiful flowers growing underneath it. A branch hangs over it to cover them, to give shade on the warm days of summer. Narcissa stands up and walks towards it. She reaches for the branch and finds out that she can hold on to it if she stands on the tips of her toes. It will work. This will be perfect. The final resting place of the Malfoy line.
“Well done, my child,” the Dark Lord says. He steps over the dead body and points his wand at the crying boy that stands in his cot.
Hermione shakes her head. “I don’t know, Ron,” she answers.
“This might hurt a little,” Rodolph says as he lifts Harold’s legs and lays them over his shoulders. His cock pushes against Harold’s hole and Harold holds his breath. This is it. He’s going to lose his virginity tonight. He bites his bottom lip when Rodolph pushes a little inside him. He goes slow and it hurts a bit. Harold tries to relax and let it happen to him. He closes his eyes and thinks of Draco. Of kissing him and taking off his clothes. Of laying naked in bed together, exploring each other's bodies with their hands and lips.
Harry slowly puts his feet on the ground and raises his head. He knows this is it. He’ll be joining Malfoy in dead. There is no way to escape and Harry won’t die a coward. He will die strong and upright, just like his father. Just like Sirius and Lupin. Soon he will see his parents. And Sirius and Lupin. He will finally get to know his family and all will be well. He only needs to get through the seconds it takes for Voldemort to raise his wand and utter the words that will kill him for good.
“Fuck, she’s hot,” Barty says. He pulls her up from the floor and lays her next to her dead boy on the kitchen island. He opens his trousers and pulls out his hard cock. He trusts into her and moans. Rabastan steps behind him and pulls Barty’s trousers down. He says a spell Harold doesn’t know and then slides his hand over his cock and Barty’s arsehole. Without warning, he pushes into Barty, who turns around and kisses Rabastan.
Harold passes out with his dad’s cock in his mouth, his mother's hands holding his face down and his body slacks on the bed.
Dean stares at the scene in front of him. Neville is still on his hands and knees as he lets out another scream which stops abruptly. Luna moves closer to Dean and he tightens his hold around her waist. This is all wrong. This is not how this was supposed to go. Dean had come back to Hogwarts to fight the final battle, to help Harry save the wizarding world from the lunatic who stands next to Neville. The lunatic who thinks all of this is funny.
Greyback smiles at Hermione. “Why would I. It’s a shame to waste some nice Mudblood meat,” he says. He looks around and Hermione wonders what got his attention. Without warning, Greyback starts to walk. He drags Hermione along with him by her hair. Hermione has no option but to stumble after him.
Narcissa lets out a howling scream when she sees the knife slice open Draco’s throat. Blood spurts out of the wound and Draco’s body convulses. The Dark Lord moves away from Draco and he falls forwards on the Potter boy. Narcissa hears the Dark Lord laugh but she doesn’t look at him, she only sees the blood spreading over the forest floor. A shiver runs over Narcissa’s back. She stares at the motionless body of her son. His hair spread around his head, slowly darkening from the blood that still leaks from his wound. Narcissa doesn’t care what will happen, she needs to keep his hairs clean. Draco always took great proud in his Malfoy locks. Narcissa can’t let them get drenched with dirt. Without thinking, or caring about the consequences, she rushes forward and pulls Draco in her arms. She lets her wand slide over his hairs, cleaning them with care, making sure they are as pristine as always.
Hermione tries to reach inside her pocket to get her wand. She gets a hold of it and pulls it out. Only her hands tremble and she can’t get a clear view of Greyback as she stumbles along. She raises the wand and tries to cast a curse at her attacker. The curse flies past Greyback, who stops in his tracks.
“Yes,” Harold says. His voice hurts a little, but he’s okay.
Rodolph puts his wand away and takes hold of Bellatrix’s head. He pushes her down on his cock at the same time he pushes one of his fingers into Harold’s hole. It hurts a little and Harold lets out a small cry.
Harry looks at the white train. He wants to move to the train and let it take him to whatever comes next. He knows it’s safe to take the white train. But he doesn’t feel it pull him closer like the black train is forcing Malfoy. Harry turns his head and looks at the black train. He shivers and he knows somehow that the train is evil and will only bring suffering. Draco still fights every step he takes that brings him closer to that train and Harry understands. He would fight it to if it was him.
Harold blushes. “I want to see you naked,” he says.
“Welcome back, sweetheart. Are you okay?” she asks.
Harold gasps when a scarf winds itself around his neck. He didn’t notice Rodolph casting the spell. The scarf tightens, cutting off Harold’s air supply. He keeps bucking on top of Rodolph and he takes his cock in his hand and pumps it up and down. His head starts to spin and his legs start to tremble. He opens his mouth wide to try to find some air, but it’s no use. He’s going to suffocate before he comes. It’s his punishment for watching Draco instead of his dad. But Harold can’t help it. His boyfriend is the most beautiful thing on this planet. Harold never wants to lose him, but at the same time, he wants to kill him. He wants to feel that pleasure again. The trill of the kill. And how amazing will that be when it’s Draco that takes his last breath because of him.
Rodolph laughs behind him. Harold places a kiss on the woman’s lips as she stares at him in disbelief. Then he turns and walks over to the table with the torture tools. There are a couple of knives and even a sword. Some ropes, sticks and whips. And then there are the things that Harold has never seen before. He picks up one of the long shafts filled with spikes.
Rodolph and Bellatrix say nothing else. They both take their own pieces of cake and start eating. Harold finishes his own and then lounges in the chair he’s in. It’s comfy and Harold starts to drift off a little.
Harold looks at his dad and bites his bottom lip. They’ve been talking about it, that Harold is loose enough these days that he will enjoy it. Harold has seen his father fuck other boys, seen how he enjoyed their pain. But when it comes to Harold, Rodolph never wants him to get hurt. Not if it’s not intentional anyway. He still likes it when Harold fights to get air in his longs when Rodolph’s cock is stuck in Harold’s throat. When Harold starts to slam his hands against anything he can find as his body fights to survive. It never takes long for Rodolph to empty his cock in Harold’s throat when that happens.
Neville blinks when he watches the Sorting Head fly towards him. It falls onto his head, taking away his view. The only thing he can see is the inside of the hat. And maybe that is better. At least this way he won’t have to look at his friends as he’s murdered.
“You can always stay with me when things go south,” Vincent says as he steps onto the balcony.
“You shouldn’t have let that boy watch. He’s trouble,” Lucius shouts.
“Stand aside, you silly girl, stand aside now,” the Dark Lord tells her. Bellatrix doesn’t understand why her Lord would want to spare the woman.
“Dad, stop it,” Harold says. “You know it’s not going to happen. Draco is mine.” He pulls Draco’s face towards him and kisses him deeply.
Rodolph undresses Harold slowly. Kissing every part of his body. He caresses him like he’s the most precious thing in the world. Harold lets Rodolph, his mind occupied with what is going to happen tonight. He moans as his father pushes a slick finger into his hole, quickly followed by a second.
Harold nods and slides of the chair. Binky appears next to him and hands him the drawing he made this afternoon. With shaking fingers Harold takes it and hands it over to his dad. Rodolph smiles as he removes the ribbon around the parchment. He unrolls it and then his eyes twinkle. Harold smiles. He knew his dad would love his painting.
Two small hands take hold of the scarf on each side of Bellatrix’s face. He pulls them a little tighter, making Bellatrix moan.
“Goodnight, son,” is the last thing he hears before he falls asleep, dreaming of the young boy dying with a smile on his face.
Rodolph his hands move lower and then start to open Harold’s trousers. Harold wonders what his dad is going to do. Is he going to fuck Harold, like he did that little boy? Will he kill Harold tonight? Harold hopes not. He doesn’t want to leave Draco alone, no matter how happy it would make his dad. Harold remembers how Rodolph had enjoyed watching the boy die. But dad had promised mom that he wouldn’t hurt Harold. Sure killing him falls under hurting him. So Harold shouldn’t worry and just enjoy the attention he’s getting.
Only Dean finds no rest. He wakes in the dark. He can feel a massive snake move around him. Nagini rolls around his body, pushing his longs closed as she strangles Dean. She let’s go and Dean tries to crawl away. But he isn’t fast enough. Nagini opens her mouth and swallows Dean down. Dean screams as her digesting fluids touch his body. They sting and bite at him. Dean grabs around in the hope to find something to hold on to. He feels teeth and pulls his body forward. The world is still dark, but somehow he manages to push himself out of Nagini. He kicks her and tries to stand up. But his legs won’t move and he’s stuck in place.
Harold picks up the knife and lets it slide over the woman’s chest and stomach. He makes small cuts from time to time. His tongue licks over the blood that spills out of them. The woman trashes around him, unable to stop Harold’s assault on her. Harold smiles as he pushes the knife in a little deeper at her side. A muffled scream comes from her. Harold laughs and then stabs the woman again, now in her stomach. He pulls out the knife and watches the blood spill from the wounds. Then he puts the knife down and loosens the rope around the woman’s neck.
Potter’s eyes widen as he looks at Draco and the Dark Lord. His eyes are focused on the Dark Lord’s hand that has pulled Draco’s cock out of his robes and is rubbing it slowly. Draco is hard and he can’t wait to fill Potter with his lid. He takes a step towards him and takes Potter’s nest of hair in his hand to pulls him on his knees, making his mouth line up with Draco’s cock. Potter firmly pushes his lips closed, unwilling to take Draco in his mouth.
All adults in the room laugh. “Oh, poor girl. Do you think we care about you, or your Muggle offspring?” Bellatrix tells her.
The Dark Lord raises his wand and seconds later Potter’s clothes have vanished. The boy kneels naked in front of Draco, tears streaming over his cheeks. Draco laughs as he looks at him. It’s good to get back for all the times Potter has made his life miserable.
Harold points his finger to his lips. “My mouth is here,” he says.
The white of King Cross Station fades away as the train leaves the station. The world around Harry turns black as pain shoot through his entire body. It’s like someone has put an eternal Cruciatus curse on him. Harry screams as he starts to fall. He burns and aches all over as he tumbles down a never-ending pit for the rest of eternity.
Draco pulls out before he gets to close. He doesn’t want this to be over yet. He pushes Potter backwards on the ground and kneels in between his legs. “Have you ever been fucked, Potter?” Draco asks.
Draco feels the Dark Lord slips out of him and Draco feels empty. He’s cold and he wavers. The Dark Lord stands up, releasing his hold on Draco. Draco’s torso wiggles until it falls forwards. He lands on top of Potter. What would Potter think of him now? Will he fear his end would be this painful too? Draco whole body begins to shake and he slides out of Potter’s ass. Draco gurgles and wonders how long this will take before he passes out and dies.
Draco’s hands slide around Harold’s waist and he rests his chin on Harold’s shoulder. “I’ll keep you warm if you want to go outside,” he says.
Harold looks at Draco and enjoys the feeling of Draco’s hand on his head. He wants him to grab his hair and pull him closer. He wants their mouths to sink into each other and kiss Draco until his lips hurt.
-x-x-x-x-x-
Narcissa looks up and shouts: “Don’t you touch him!” Her eyes are locked with Bellatrix’s. Narcissa is not surprised to find no anger in them, or sorrow for the loss of her nephew, just glee and excitement. Before Bellatrix went to Azkaban, Narcissa would have thought the death of her family would mean something to her sister. But now she knows that the only thing Bellatrix cares about is torture and death. And pleasing her Dark Lord. Off course she is happy that Draco is gone. She could never except that Draco knew how to please their Lord better than her. She’ll be the number one again, the one who shares the Dark Lord’s bed.
“Sister, pull yourself together,” Bellatrix snaps as she lets her hand slide over Malfoy’s cheek. “Look how pretty he’s in dead.”
Harold smiles and puts his hand on Draco’s. They haven’t seen each other since Christmas. Mother and uncle Lucius had a massive fight, after which uncle Lucius took Draco and aunt Narcissa home shouting they will never set foot in this house again. Of course, that didn’t last, but Harold was scared none the less. How was he supposed to go on without Draco? The idea still brings tears to his eyes.
The man just stands behind them, the knife still in his hand. “I killed her,” he murmurs. “I’m a murderer.”
Malfoy is naked too. The cut in his throat is gone, but his chest is filled with scars. Harry can’t help but stare at them. “I’m sorry,” he stutters as he realises how Malfoy had got them. Harry has put them there on that faithful day in sixth year. Draco had almost died that day. Would he have been okay with that? To die before he would kill Dumbledore and Snape? Before he became the monster he is now? Is it Harry’s fault that Malfoy turned to the dark side without any doubt in his minds if it was the right thing to do?
Harold laughs. He knows he is. “I can’t help it that my dad has the hots for me,” he says.
“Yes, Master Draco. Dobby will fetch one right away.” And with that Dobby disappears again.
“Yes, you can,” Dean tells Ginny. “It’s okay. I will still be here when you get back with Hermione. She can do the spells to heal me.”
Harold yawns. “Yes, daddy,” he answers. He struggles to keep his eyes open and he doesn’t mind when his dad places him on his parents' bed. Rodolph strokes his hand through Harold’s hair and then places a soft kiss on his lips.
“It’s time. Just be careful. I don’t want him hurt by you.”
When Harold comes close to the kitchen he hears someone scream and he stops in his tracks. The voice is unfamiliar and Harold shivers a little. Then he hears his mother laugh as the screams intensify and Harold wonders what his parents are doing in the kitchen with a stranger. He sneaks further until he reaches the landing that watches out over the kitchen. He pushes his head against the railing and looks down to see what is going on.
Neville steps though the entrance doors that barely stay in their hinges. Voldemort has moved into the courtyard with his Death Eaters. Neville doesn’t give them much attention. His sight is focused on the body in Hagrid’s arms. Harry is naked, his face and torso covered in blood. One of his arms hangs down and wavers with each step Hagrid takes. Neville swallows when he spots Harry’s blank stare. His eyes are open, but they don’t register anything anymore. There is no life in them left. Harry is dead. The war is lost.
Bellatrix lifts the Imperius curse and the woman drops the rope inimitably. She kneels and takes the boy’s head in her hands. “My boy, oh, my boy. I’m sorry. I couldn’t stop it. I’m sorry,” she cries.
Rodolph looks up and spots the boys hanging through the railing. He smiles at them but doesn’t say a word. He will let them watch for as long as they want. Harold just hopes uncle Lucius doesn’t spot them and breaks up the party. The man still believes that Draco should not be subjected to rape and murder. If only the man knew what happens when Draco stays at Harold’s place alone and Rodolph joins their make-out sessions. Harold is sure that Lucius wouldn’t approve of the way Draco would get used by Harold and Rodolph.
Harold stares at the fireplace. The flames have turned yellow again after Draco and his father left some seconds ago. They were the last to leave. Draco didn’t want to, he wanted to stay until midnight, as it was Harold’s birthday until then. Only Lucius wouldn’t let him. Harold thinks it’s unfair. It’s his birthday, and if he wants Draco here until midnight, he should be allowed to stay the night.
“Imperius,” Draco corrects.
“Sharp enough,” Greyback says. “Now let’s get down to business.”
“Who is the boy who lived?” Harold asks Bellatrix.
“That is a good boy, laugh as you bleed to death,” Voldemort says.
Then Neville is lifted from the ground, forced to stand on his legs as a body bind curse pins him in place.
“I know you can,” Rodolph laughs as he starts to takes large steps up the stairs. “But you’re so slow and I can’t wait.”
“What’s wrong, Greg?” Draco asks when Greg walks back onto the balcony. “You’re pacing is getting annoying.”
Dean doesn’t think. He let’s go of Luna who still cries into his shoulder. With speed, he dives for the Sorting hat and pulls out the sword. He turns and lashes at Nagini. Her head falls to the ground and her body shivers. A dark cloud explodes from her and Voldemort screams.
But all had gone so differently. Harry is dead. And it won’t be long before Neville follows him. Dean came back to see the end of the war, but it isn’t turning into the end he thought. It’s turning into a defeat. A start of a world where he isn’t welcome and will be killed if they catch him.
Harry doesn’t have to think about it. He’s the hero, isn’t he? Out to save everyone. He might have died in vain. But he won’t let anyone else suffer for the mistakes he made. With determination, he moves passed Malfoy and boards the black train. He turns as soon as he’s onboard to see Malfoy fall backwards. His eyes are wide and unbelieving as the door shuts in front of Harry. The train starts to move and Harry knows he did the right thing. Draco will go to heaven and finally have peace. Harry doesn’t know why, but he’s sure he would have never found it there, knowing what would have happened to Draco.
“For me?” Harold asks. He steps closer to the cell and smiles. “I get to play with her?”
Voldemort laughs again. “You want to be next?” he asks.
“Yes, they are useless to me.” Voldemort shakes his head and then smiles at Neville. “But you are brave. I could use brave men like you in my new world. What do you think, Neville? Are you willing to follow me, now that your saviour is dead?”
And then Rodolph starts to move. He slides out a little, just to thrust back in. The pain inside Harold slowly disperses as another feeling takes over. He’s never felt this full in his life. It’s good and nice. Harold’s cock tingles and slowly hardens. Rodolph notices and starts to stroke it. Harold knows he can’t come like his dad, that he’s still too young. But that doesn’t change that it feels good. Better than Harold has ever felt in his life.
“Yes, I do,” he answers.
“You’re lucky,” Draco says. “Father always complains about me. I don’t think he likes me.”
“You’ll see him again in two days,” Rodolph says as he lays down a hand on Harold’s shoulder.
Harold smiles when he hears his dad say he loves him. Off course Harold knows this, dad says it all the time. But it never stops Harold’s heart from speeding up.
Narcissa lays the robe on the ground next to Draco. She takes her wand and lifts Draco into the air and then places him on top of the robe. She kneels next to Draco and kisses him on the forehead. “I love you,” she tells him. With shaking hands she lifts one side of the robe and folds it over Draco’s body, covering half his face. Then she takes the other side to cover him up completely. The robe isn’t long enough and Draco’s calves and feet stick out. But it’s the best that Narcissa can do. And at least his manhood isn’t on full display anymore, or the awful muggle way he found his end.
“Do you think it’s dead?” Harold asks Draco.
Rodolph walks them all the way to Harold’s room and lays Harold down on his bed. Harold giggles as his dad leans over him and starts to kiss his head and ears.
“Lily, take Harry, and go! It’s him!” Potter shouts when he burst into the hall to inspect the blast that had broken their door open. Bellatrix laughs when she sees that the idiot doesn’t even hold his wand.
Ginny shakes her head. “I can’t leave you like this.”
Barty loses the rope around the man’s neck and Rabastan pulls out of him. He lifts the body bind curse. The man rolls around to look at his son and the woman that killed him. He looks angry. “How could you?” he asks his wife.
“The boy who lived, comes to die,” the Dark Lord says. Draco looks at the man. He looks giddy as he holds his wand in front of him. Aunt Bella cheers beside him.
“Good,” Rodolph answers. He bends down and gives Harold a kiss on his lips. His mouth lingers for a second, his tongue stroking Harold’s lip. Harold opens his mouth and lets his father in. It’s strange, but nice, having Rodolph’s tongue explore his mouth.
“Don’t you touch him,” Narcissa shouts at Bellatrix. The sisters stare at each other until Bellatrix just shakes her head and walks away from them.
“Give it to me,” the Dark Lord orders. Draco wonders if the Dark Lord is planning to kill Potter with a knife instead of the killing curse. It’s not his style, it’s the way aunt Bella likes to kill people, make them bleed and suffer. She always complains the killing curse is to fast, to easy. And Draco agrees. Let this silly boy feel the pain of death before it takes him. Draco wants to see him bleed, watch the life slowly fade out of him. The killing curse would be to kind for Potter. If only it was his choice, his place to make this decision. Draco would make it perfect.
“Didn’t think you would make it to heaven,” Harry says.
Harold bites on his lip to hold in a laugh that tries to escape him. If his parents hear him he will be sent back to bed, and he wants to know what will happen now. He wants to see how the man and woman come to their end.
“I won’t,” Harold answers. He doesn’t like uncle Lucius either. Harold hasn’t missed the bruises on Draco’s arm, no matter how hard Draco tries to hide them. Harold knows it shouldn’t be hard to make them go away with some magic. He’s had brushes from time to time for the games he plays with his parents during the night. But as soon as he discovers them he shows his dad that will heal them in an instant. That uncle Lucius won’t heal Draco’s shows how mean the man is. Harold wants to grow up and then kill him for all the times he’s hurt Draco.
“And who is this, who tries to deny my power?” Voldemort asks.
“I’ll never hurt him. I love him, Bella,” Rodolph says.
Harold bites his bottom lip and thinks about it. “What would it be like, freezing to death? Do you think you’ll suffer, or will you be too numb to feel it?” Harold asks.
Dumbledore strokes his beard again as a new twinkle lights up in his eyes. “If you are sure it was your doing that forced his hand, you have a choice to make. Not if you will go back to your life or board the white train. But if you will take Draco’s place on the black train, so he can be set free and take the white one. Just know you will be choosing eternal suffering to save him.”
Greg lays down next to Draco and sighs. “Mother and Father fought before we came here. She said that Rodolphus is a bad influence or something.”
Greyback pulls Hermione closer and kisses her lips. Hermione spits against them. Greyback laughs and then pulls her against his body. “This is just the beginning, baby,” he says. He places his arm tightly around Hermione’s waist to keep her in place.
“Love you,” Harold whispers.
Someone pulls Malfoy’s body of Harry and takes it in their arms. Harry opens his eyes and watches as Narcissa takes hold of her son and rocks his dead body in her arms.
Draco takes Potter’s legs in his hand and lines his cock up with Potter’s hole. Draco pushes in with force and Potter cries out in pain. Draco fucks him and Potter whimpers. He looks so pathetic like this, snot leaking from his nose, tears straining his cheeks, his hands grabbing the forest floor, blood escaping his anus as Draco destroys it. He keeps begging for Draco to stop and Draco loves the thought that this is how Potter is going to die, as a whining little bitch. As his whining little bitch.
The Dark Lord laughs, and the Death Eaters around follow. Draco shakes his head. Stupid sheep, most of them. The Dark Lord is angry, crawl. The Dark Lord is laughing, laugh too. The Dark Lord has an opinion, agree even if you don’t. It’s pathetic. They’re all just like Father. They lack inspiration. Or a spine. Draco might be a Death Eater, he’s still got a mind of his own. And that’s the way the Dark Lord loves it. It’s the reason why he and aunt Bella are his most trusted followers. Not because they do whatever the Dark Lords bits them, but because they do it with creativity and charm. With a little spice of their own.
“Oh, no you don’t, baby,” he says. With a swift move, he pulls Hermione’s wand out of her hand and drops it on the ground. He smashes the wand with his foot. Hermione stares at it with disbelief. Her last hope of escaping just got destroyed. There is no way Hermione will be able to fight Greyback with her bare hands.
And now he was gone. Still, pale and dead. Narcissa will never hear him laugh again. She will never find him in front of the piano, playing one of the classics in the middle of the night because he can’t sleep. Her boy will never graduate, or marry, or have children of his own. He always wanted children. And now that joy was robbed away before he even had a chance to grasps it.
Bellatrix shakes her head and places a kiss on Harold’s forehead. “Nobody you need to worry about,” she answers.
“Let’s make this a game, see who dies first,” Barty says. He places the second rope around the neck of the man that uncle Rabastan is fucking. The man’s eyes fly open when Barty pulls the rope tight. He starts to put op a fight, only uncle Rabastan shakes his head and puts him under a spell. His body goes stiff, the only evidence that he’s struggling visibly on his face. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open. Tears fall over his cheeks.
“Love you too, my boy,” Rodolph answers. “Do you want to sleep with us tonight?” he asks.
Neville looks at the door of the great hall. He can hear the voice clearly in his head. Just like he’d heard it twice before this day. Only this time the words seem unreal. It can’t be true. Neville had heard the prophecy. And he’s sure that if Voldemort’s words are true, all hope is lost.
But it’s all no use. Over and over again, Nagini comes for him and swallows a part of him or his entire body. Dean’s flesh is burning and he feels sick from the pain. He fights to not be eaten, and somehow he always escapes. Only to be eaten again. And again. For the rest of eternity. Always in pain from the digesting fluids of Nagini, but never for long enough to perish and find peace.
The Dark Lord stops and caresses Bellatrix’s cheek. He pushes her chin up and smiles. “You’re my loyal servant, I would expect no less of you than to worry when needed,” he says before he rests his lips on Bellatrix mouth. The kiss is short and when the Dark Lord pulls away Bellatrix can’t help but follow his face with hers.
Harry wants to say that Draco’s statement is invalid, as he is dead too, but at that moment two trains ride onto the platform, a white and a black train, parked on both sides of them. Harry looks around again and recognises King-cross station. It’s only white now, and empty and clean. So different from all the times he’s been there, but somehow still the same. It brings a smile on his face.
They don’t hear the door to the room open. Or see how Rodolph takes off his clothes as he watches the boys make out. It isn’t until the bed dips when he sits on it that the boys look up and spot him. Harold sits up and holds out his hand in an invitation for Rodolph to join them. Rodolph takes his hand and moves closer so he can kiss Harold. His hands slide over Harold’s body, just like Draco’s. Harold breaks the kiss and turns his head so he can kiss Draco again. Rodolph kisses his neck and back and then moves up again. Harold turns his head to find Rodolph’s lips.
“Pull them as tight as you can,” Bellatrix tells Harold. “And don’t stop until your daddy tells you to.”
Rodolph releases Bellatrix her hands and she sits up to kiss Rodolph. “That was amazing,” she tells him. Then she pushes him on his back and motions for Harold to come to sit in between her and Rodolph.
Narcissa drops her wand, she won’t need it anymore. Then she takes hold of the branch with both her hands. She lifts herself a little, so her toes don’t touch the ground anymore. And then she lets go.
Rodolph drops the topic and just lays down on his back. Without another word, Draco kneels in between Rodolph’s legs and takes Rodolph’s cock in his mouth. Harold holds up his fingers and Rodolph lubes them up. Harold sits down behind Draco and pushes into Draco’s hole. His other hand is placed on top of Draco’s head. He pushes Draco down on Rodolph’s cock and holds him in place. Rodolph thrusts upwards into Draco’s throat. Draco’s head turns red and his body starts to shake as he fights to get some air. He tries to lift his head, but Harold holds him down. Draco’s arms twitch and slide away, unable to keep Draco up any longer. His head falls down and Harold pushes him further onto Rodolph’s cock. Draco’s eyes are wide as his legs tremble between them.
“It’s a dildo,” Rodolph says. “One not made for pleasure, but pain.”
“Sister, pull yourself together,” she says. “Look how pretty he’s in dead.”
“I’d like to use this one,” Harold says.
“Punishing himself for burning breakfast,” Draco answers.
“Can’t even swallow like a decent person,” Mr Crabbe says. He smacks the woman in the face.
The man laughs again. “He’s got something I want,” he says. With force, Dean is turned onto his side. He screams in agony as the sword moves around in his body.
“I saw my parents kill some Muggles,” Harold whispers. “A boy and his parents.”
Harold has no time to think of what Bellatrix means. She pushes his head further onto Rodolph’s cock. It pushes into Harold’s throat. He tries to cough, but he can’t. He can’t breathe and he panics a little. He starts to hit around with his arms, but that only makes Rodolph laugh.
As Harry moves closer the person comes into focus and Harry recognises the platinum hair and the dark mark on the left arm. The person is Malfoy.
Harold pushes his finger against one of the spikes. It pinches a little and a small drop of blood falls down. Rodolph takes Harold’s hand and sucks on the blood.
“Snape wasn’t innocent, he was a spy,” Malfoy says. “You would have done the same if it was one of ours.”
“You will pay for this,” Voldemort says. He lifts his wand and suddenly Dean feels at peace. He doesn’t have to worry about the war or how it will end. It doesn’t matter that he’s in the middle of a battle, or that he just killed Voldemort’s snake and is under his attack. All is well and will forever be. Dean doesn’t worry about anything anymore. No, he smiles as he feels fantastic. The best he’s felt in years. His anxiety from moments ago is gone, just like the urge to act. Everything is perfect now.
“You can’t leave me here, Potter,” Malfoy says. He looks at Harry with pleading eyes. The fear that had haunted Malfoy’s eyes in sixth year, before Harry attacked him is back. The fear he had before he became a killer and a devoted Death Eater. Before Harry almost killed him. If only Harry had never used that spell. If only he could take it all back and help Malfoy keep his soul clean.
Rodolph lays his arm around Bellatrix her shoulders. “Don’t worry, Bella, our Lord knows what he’s doing. Tonight is the night we win and take over this world. Trust me, it’s all going to be perfect.”
Draco laughs. “You’re silly,” he says.
It’s the right thing to say. Draco smiles and then lets himself fall back onto the bed. “Promise me you’ll never get angry with me,” Draco says.
“I will, sweetheart. We’ll make sure that Draco is fine.”
Bellatrix leans over Harold and whispers in his ear. “Don’t worry, we won’t hurt you. You will feel how amazing it is. Daddy will love it.”
Rodolph smiles at Bellatrix as he opens his trousers and takes out his cock. Harold can’t stop looking at it as his father pushes it inside the young boy’s ass. The boy screams and Rodolph laughs. “Oh, you’re a good boy. Nice and tight. Just the way I like it,” he says. Harold is fascinated by the scene, the blissful look on his fathers face, the moans escaping his mouth, as he fucks into the young boy. The boy cries and tries to push Rodolph away from him. And then uncle Rabastan takes his cock out and pushes it into the unconscious man. His rhythm in sync with Rodolph’s. The brothers smile at each other as they fuck their unwilling victims.
“Where’s Dobby?” Harold asks.
“What does mom like?” Rodolph asks as he lets go of Harold’s head. Harold falls back onto the pillows and thinks.
“Bella, are you okay?” Rodolph asks.
Harold smiles as the woman does as she’s told. The boy starts to crawl at the rope around his neck with his hands, as his legs try to kick Rodolph off of him. Rodolph just takes a firmer hold on the boy’s hips and thrusts in harder.
“Yes, Malfoy killed him too,” Harry snaps. “He got pretty good at killing innocent people after that.”
“Now, let’s go find a quiet place,” Fenrir says. He starts to walk again and pulls a screaming and kicking Hermione with him. Dean can’t do a thing to help her as he’s unable to move. The only thing he can do is stare at the darkening sky above him.
It doesn’t take long before Harold sees the woman again. When his friends and their fathers have left the next day, Rodolph takes Harold down to the dungeons. The woman sits in her cell. Her knees pulled up against her chest, with her arms around them. Her face is hidden in her knees. She shivers. The blood and sperm of last night are gone.
“You are worried,” he says.
It doesn’t take long before Voldemort comes inside him with an awful moan. Neville is left sitting on his hands and knees as Voldemort slides out of his abused hole and stands up. He continues with his speech as if he didn’t just rape a schoolboy in front of everyone. Neville fights the body bind curse with all his might, but he just can’t move. He can’t stop this man from taking his life. He’s as weak as his grandmother always told him he was, as useless as Snape had always known.
“See how she molests your son, as he’s nothing but a sex toy,” Barty tells the man. “You can stop her. It’s simple. Just take this knife and cut her throat.”
“I love you,” Draco says when they break their kiss.
“Does he still fuck you?” Greg asks.
For some time, both Rodolph and Rabastan fuck their two dying victims. Harold can’t look away from the boy. His struggles start to die down, his hands hardly lift up anymore and his legs go limp next to Rodolph’s hips. His body starts to shake uncontrollably and his tongue slowly swells out of his mouth. It’s fascinating and Harold wishes he could get closer so he could tough the young boy.
“You’ve watched your mother to ofter,” Rodolph laughs as he picks up his wand and taps it against the dildo inside the woman’s vagina. The dildo pushes in and out of its own accord. Harold watches as blood starts to spill around it.
“Let me take care of you,” Bellatrix says.
“I don’t know, I just know that I’m here to tell him that he can go back if he wants to,” Dumbledore says.
Harold gets pushes against Rodolph’s chest and the hand on his throat squeezes. Harold can’t breathe. His body starts its fight for life as his dad fucks him hard. They move forward so that Harold’s head is next to Draco’s. Harold pushes his tongue out of his choking mouth so he can lick Draco’s cheek. The world begins to spin and Harold’s head hurts. He shudders and his arms jerk around him. Rodolph pushes him down on Draco, pushing their naked bodies against each other. It’s enough to have to feeling of perfect pleasure rip through Harold. Once it’s over the pain and terror flushes back. Harold his eyes spin to the back of his head and he wants to scream. Only he can’t. He has no air. Panic takes over and then the world just ends.
“I’m okay, Gin,” he says. “Fenrir took Hermione into the forest. Get help and rescue her.”
“Now pull,” Harold says. Both boys pull on the rope, enclosing it around the peacock’s neck. The bird starts to trash around, opens it’s feathers and gives some loud screams. They pull a little harder and then the screams stop. The bird’s feet leave the ground and Draco starts to laugh. It’s funny to see how the bird tries to place it’s feet on something solid, only to find air around it. And the head keeps turning around. It’s not the same as the boy, but it’s just as fascinating. But the most beautiful is the big grin on Draco’s face.
Ron takes a step forwards, only to be pulled back by Hermione. “Don’t,” she says. “You’ll die.”
Dobby returns with a large rope and Draco and Harold both take an end. “You can go now, Dobby,” Draco says. The elf disappears, but Harold thinks it’s still close by so he can see what they are going to do with the rope.
“Maybe I don’t want you to come to bed with me,” Harold says. It’s a lie, but Harold doesn’t want to give in that easy. He wanted Draco to stay too. Why can’t he have both? Have Draco and dad in his bed at the same time. Draco would like to see it. It’s not like he doesn’t know what Harold and Rodolph get up to. Harold tells him all about it when they are alone, when uncle Lucius can’t hear. Draco is jealous of it. He wants to know what it feels like to suffocate. How it is when you almost die. He should get a chance to experience it too.
“Our special boy, Bella,” Rodolph answers.
“I know, mom.”
“I wish I knew how to cast a warming charm,” Harold says. He looks out of his window. The balcony is white with snow, but the sky is bright tonight. It would have been nice to sit on the balcony so he could watch the stars.
“Never,” Neville spits out.
“Okay, mom,” Harold answers. He pulls on the scarf and watches as Bellatrix’s mouth falls open. Rodolph starts to kiss her pussy again. Bellatrix smiles and then closes her eyes. It doesn’t take long before they pop open again. Bellatrix her hands shake in their ropes and her legs start to kick around Rodolph’s head. He just continues to lick and kiss her. Slowly Bellatrix her head turns red and her eyes start to roll inside their sockets. Harold looks at them with fascination. He wonders if his mother is in pain, or if it’s only joy she feels now. The young boy he saw die this way, didn’t seem to like it. But mother is different, she’s not some pathetic Muggle.
“You any idea what this is?” Malfoy asks.
“Is she dead?” uncle Lucius asks.
A zipper opens and moments later Greyback’s huge cock pushes into Hermione’s pussy. There is no gentle strokes or time for Hermione to adjust to the intrusion. Greyback slams into her, over and over again.
“Fuck,” Draco utters. Harold understands. You don’t talk about your husband like that. It’s a dangerous thing to say. Draco’s mom once said it when his dad had given Draco a bad beating. She walked around with trembling limps for weeks. Harold doesn’t want to know how many Cruciatus curses she had to endure. Neither does Draco. She never talked about leaving after that. Mother thinks aunt Narcissa is weak, that she should have given uncle Lucius what he deserves. She doesn’t like Lucius, thinks he’s a coward and a fool. And Harold tends to agree with her. The man can’t see how amazing his son is, and that just baffles Harold.
“You love the woman that killed your only son?” Bellatrix asks. She puts another Imperius on the woman and orders her to stand up. The woman stands in front of her husband who still cradles their son. Bellatrix pushes the woman’s dress off her shoulder. Let’s it slip down her body revealing the woman’s breast. Bellatrix plays with them a little and then moves her hand down to the woman’s panties. Bellatrix’s hand disappears inside them.
“Well, I’m here. Wherever here is.” Malfoy waves his hand around and then looks back at the crying part of Voldemort’s soul.
“Draco, my boy,” the Dark Lord says. Draco turns to look at his Lord. “I believe I promised you a reward for warning me about Snape and his treacherous heart. Did you know, Potter? That the man loved your mother more than he loved me?”
“Open your eyes, baby,” Greyback tells her. Hermione refuses. She doesn’t need to see Narcissa’s body in front of her. She doesn’t want to know what Greyback plans to do next.
He only makes it four paces from the crowd before he’s hit by a Crucio and he falls to the ground. It’s like knives slice open his entire body. Neville can’t hold on to his wand and it falls away from him and rolls out of reach.
“I love you, dad,” Harold says when he breaks off the kiss. Rodolph smiles at him and kisses Harold.
“Maybe next time you stay over, we can sneak down and see what our parents are doing,” Harold says. He wants Draco to be happy, to see what he’s seen. He’s sure Draco would love it even more. He likes seeing blood.
“Oh, fuck, Harold, I love you,” Rodolph tells him. His hand slides over Harold’s throat. He must be close to his climax. Harold places his free hand on Rodolph’s and squeezes, giving Rodolph permission to strangle him. Rodolph tightens his grip and Harold feels so good. He looks at the woman’s bulging eyes. Her body tremors around him and then goes rigid for a couple of seconds before the tremors start again. She must know that she will die soon. Harold feels his own hands start to tremble from his lack of oxygen. He lifts the knife one more time and stabs it into the side of the woman’s neck. He pulls it out again and smiles at the fountain of blood leaving the woman. She jerks and twitches on the table. Harold takes the knife and cuts her hands free. Her arms move around as life slowly leaves her. Harold slides the knife over his naked chest, enough to feel it, but not to cut. His heartbeat pounds and he lets his free hand rub over his hard cock. He grins as the woman spits out more blood and as her eyes roll around in her head.
“Perfect,” Draco answers. “I’ll run. My legs are longer, I can do it quicker.”
Rodolph takes Harold’s hand and guides him down the stairs. Bellatrix smiles at them when they pass. She sits on top of the man as she uses the Cruciatus curse on him.
“You’re the most beautiful of all,” Rodolph says before his lips touch Harold’s chest. Rodolph’s tongue slides over one of Harold’s nipples and Harold giggles.
“Ah, look, it’s the fool who killed Nagini. Do you think he’s still alive, baby?” Greyback asks.
Hours later, Harold wakes in his warm bed with his resting father next to him. Harold smiles and can’t help it, but he’s sure he’s the most fortunate boy on this planet.
“I’ll deal with it for you,” Draco says. “Even if it means freezing to death.”
“Yes, that one. She made the mother touch the boy. They were both naked. And then Barty said that the man would be set free if he killed her. I think he believed him,” Harold continues.
“Not as delusional as you, thinking you’re safe because you have a hold on the boy who lived,” Lucius answers. Then he picks up the dead peacock and walks out of the courtyard.
Mr Goyle raises his wand. The word Crucio leaves his lips and the woman screams from the pain. Her hand and knees slip to the sides and she ends up spread out on the floor. The adults laugh and Harold can’t help the smile that forms on his face. It’s fun to watch that stupid Muggle get what she deserves.
Potter looks at Draco. Hatred boils in his eyes and Draco smiles at him. “Don’t get all worked up, Potter. Just because I killed your beloved headmaster and his little errand boy, doesn’t make me evil.”
Harold lays his head on Rodolph’s chest. He’s still tired and the hand stroking his back makes him drift off. He doesn’t want to go to sleep but it doesn’t look like anything else is going to happen. Bellatrix puts her arm over Rodolph and Harold.
“Yes, that’s good. Keep going, my boy,” Rodolph says.
Rodolph lets go of Harold’s throat and Harold spins his head around so he can kiss his dad. He just gave Harold the best birthday present anyone could ever wish for.
Harold can’t help but laugh a little. “You will scream for me,” Harold says. “You will cry and trash until I’m done with you.”
“Let go of me, you filthy wolf,” Hermione screams from somewhere behind Dean. He turns his head to see if he can spot her. Two heavy footsteps move towards Dean. They drag something along with them. Someone, more likely, going by the screams coming from Hermione.
Dean is cold and he shivers. He tries to stop the bleeding from his stomach with his hands, but it’s no use. There is too much blood spilling from his body. He will die, and it will all be for nothing. He will never kiss Seamus again. Is Seamus even still alive? Dean hasn’t seen him in a while. He went missing before the retrieve an hour ago. Chances are Seamus is long gone. He would have found Dean by now if he was still alive, wouldn’t he?
“Nobody’s eating today,” Dean says. He smiles at Voldemort who’s enraged. Dean has no idea what came over him, or why he feels so giddily now. “Guess you need to find a new pet.”
“Please don’t, Malfoy,” Potter begs. “Don’t do this.”
With a swift wand movement, a hole in the ground is made. Narcissa levitates Draco’s body into it.
“Don’t get my hopes up,” Draco says as he drops his head back on the bed. “I will just get disappointed,” he mumbles into the sheets.
Bellatrix whispers something in the woman’s ear. The woman stretches out her hands and rubs them over the dead boy’s chest. Bellatrix pushes the woman’s panties down and then moves her hand’s back to the woman’s breast. The woman takes hold of her dead boy and pulls his face between her legs. She rubs her pussy against his face, lets his thick blue tongue slide against her. And then she moves her hand’s towards the dead boy’s cock and takes it in her hands.
“You don’t think Harry went to him, do you?” Ron asks.
“Yes, my dear. I’m fantastic. We’ve saved our son from those awful Potter’s that had kidnapped him. Now let’s go home so we can start to search for our Lord.”
“There is no need to hide the state in which this traitor died. He tried to sneak away. Leave you all for dead. But my Death Eaters caught him and showed him what we do with cowards,” Voldemort laughs. “At least he didn’t die a virgin.”
Bellatrix shakes her head. “Oh, I know just what to do with you,” she says. Bellatrix points her wand at the woman and whispers ‘Imperius’. The woman stops her pointless begging and just stands in front of her son. Bellatrix takes one of the ropes from Barty and hands them to the woman.
Draco slides his cock into Potter’s mouth and pushes Potter’s head all the way against his crotch. Then he pulls him out a little before pushing back in. Potter sputters around his cock, only urging Draco on to push even deeper into his throat. Draco finds a nice rhythm and lets out a pleasant moan. The Dark Lord kisses Draco’s neck and lets his hands roam over Draco’s chest. Aunt Bella lets the Imperius slip and Potter starts to fight the intrusion again. He pushes his hands against Draco’s stomach and tries to push him off him. But it’s no use, Draco has a good firm hold on his hair and keeps his cock inside his mouth without much fight.
Narcissa brushes her hand through Draco’s hair when she looks back at his face. With his eyes closed, she can almost fool herself by pretending he’s just asleep. But the blood that still drips from his nose, and covers his lips and chin give away that he’s no longer here. Narcissa slides a finger over the open wound on Draco’s throat. It’s deep, cutting halfway through it, exposing body parts that should be hidden. Narcissa her hand slides further down, over Draco’s arm that hangs loosely to the side. She lifts it and places it on Draco’s stomach. He shouldn’t be naked. Only enemies are left uncared for, humiliated and abandoned. Draco deserves better. He deserves a proper burial. One that was stolen from his father. Narcissa won’t have it be stolen from her boy.
“My boys ready?” Bellatrix asks when she steps out of the bathroom. She’s naked and has her hair pulled back in a braid.
Draco let’s go of the rose stem and bends his head towards Harold’s. His eyes twinkle and Harold smiles.
Draco smiles. “You’re lucky. I never get to see anything interesting. Mother always wants to protect me, and father doesn’t like me.”
“I want you to be my first,” Draco says. “My first and my last.”
-x-x-x-x-x-
“How did a piece of the Dark Lord’s soul get here?” Malfoy asks.
They both smile at each other and Harold wonders what would happen if he would lean in closer and kiss Draco. They love each other, just like how Harold and his dad love each other. It’s what you do when you’re in love, when you want to show the other person how much you care. And Harold wants Draco to know that he cares. That he will always care.
When they come up for air they are both flustered. But it’s not enough. Harold wants more. He wants to be just as close to Draco as he’s to his father. With care, he pushes Draco’s trouser down a little with his hand.
“Shit, I suck at healing charms,” Ginny says.
“Goodbye my boy,” Narcissa says as she covers the hole with the ground. Then she points her wand at the tree. With care, she engraves Draco’s name and a final goodbye. Small tears fall from her eyes as the gravity of her loss takes root in her mind. The Malfoy line has ended. Her family is all gone and her purpose stolen away. There is no reason for her to still be here. No reason to go on, only to feel the pain of her loss every day. It was bad enough to live without Lucius. Living without Draco will be hell. Worse than hell. She will be better off showing the world what following the Dark Lord truly means.
“Go! Run! I’ll hold him off-”
“Don’t let mom see you throw your clothes on the floor,” Rodolph says. “She might get mad.”
The Dark Lord tells the woman that this is his last warning, but she doesn’t listen. She keeps begging him to spare the child, to have mercy. The Dark Lord shakes his head and turns to Bellatrix.
The knife touches the side of Draco’s throat and Draco knows his life is over. There is no way he can fight off the Dark Lord. His wand lays to his side, out of his reach. He’s pinned between Potter’s squirming body and the Dark Lord.
Draco turns away and stares back at the ceiling. “Don’t ever leave me,” he says.
The battle moves away from Hermione and still, she doesn’t move. For the first time in her life, she doesn’t have an answer ready. She doesn’t know how to fix this. And it paralyses her.
Aunt Bella hands her knife to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord pushes Draco’s back firmly against his chest and holds him in place with his other hand on Draco’s chest.
-x-x-x-x-x-
“Maybe we should take him to bed tonight,” Bellatrix says. “As an extra birthday gift.”
“Don’t tell father,” Draco says after some time. “He will get angry. He definitely doesn’t like you.”
Dean lands with his face in the dirt and the sword goes all the way through his body. The top sticks out at his back. Dean looks to the side and watches as people run around him, towards the castle.
Dean looks at the sword in his right hand and smiles at it. He strokes it before he closes his other hand around the shaft and holds it firm.
“No,” Harry yells. “I love you both the same much.”
“Do I have to go?” he asks Dumbledore.
Rodolph turns towards Bellatrix and pulls her head towards his. He kisses her deeply and Harold giggles. It isn’t the first time he’s seen his parents kiss, but this time it seems more heated. The kiss lasts a while and Harold gets bored looking at it. He gets his piece of cake from the table and starts to eat it. No way he’s waiting for them to get around to it. And Harold would hate it if he had to go to bed before he can eat his cake.
Sharp teeth scrape over Hermione’s shoulder. They are followed by a tongue that licks away the first drops of blood. Hermione closes her eyes and just hopes this will all be over soon.
“Don’t fall asleep, sweetheart. You’ll miss it all,” Rodolph says.
Bellatrix laughs as she pets the woman’s hair. “You’re a good girl, giving my husband precisely what he wants.”
Harry’s head snaps back to Voldemort. “You promised you wouldn’t harm them if I surrendered,” Harry shouts.
“I didn’t get to finish before when I killed your dead hero. So you will do,” Voldemort says. The Death Eaters laugh as Voldemort pushes his lid into Neville’s hole without any preparation. Neville screams as his anus tears. He’s forced to look at his friends, as he can’t move a single muscle in his body. Hermione and Ginny hold on to each other as they cry. And Luna hides her face in Dean’s shoulder. Neville had wanted to ask her out, and now he will never get the change. Instead, he will be raped and murdered in front of her.
Dean’s blood boils in his veins. This is one of his best friends that bastard is talking about. There is nothing nice or funny about him being dead.
With care, Narcissa lays Draco down on the ground. She stands up and takes off her robe, leaving her in only her bra and panties. She doesn’t care. Her life is worthless now. The only thing she lived for is dead and gone. Now she just wants to cover up the naked body of her baby boy.
“I told you fuckers that it was a trap!” she screams at the others. Rabastan and Rodolph stare at her, their eyes wide. Barty stands beside them, his lips trembles. Bellatrix knows it’s up to her now. If they stay here, they will go to jail. They need to get away and make sure that no-one will touch them. Her eyes dart back to the little boy. It would be the perfect revenge. They took her child, so now she will take theirs and raise it as her own. Nobody will dare to harm them as long as they have the boy.
“Don’t be, I deserved it,” Malfoy says.
Harold smiles and then places a soft kiss on Rodolph’s cock.
Harold shakes his head. “Daddy said mommy killed him in the end, after hours of torture. I went to the kitchen to see, and their bodies were still there. I touched the boy’s face. It was covered with his mother's blood. But his eyes were still open and I think they were beautiful.”
“Dean lay still. Let me help you,” Ginny suddenly says. She hovers over him and Dean tries to smile at her. He hasn’t noticed her before. When did she get here? How long ago was it that Fenrir was here, pulling Hermione with him?
Harold turns in Draco’s arms so he can look at him. He kisses him and then leans against the window behind him. “No, they haven’t,” he says. “You know I will tell you. I know how badly you had wanted to be there.”
“I see,” Dumbledore says. He pulls on his beard.
“You want me to kiss it better?” Harold asks. He doesn’t wait for a response, bents down a little and places a soft peck on Draco’s finger.
“Is it now?” Rodolph says. “And would you like me to kiss you on your mouth?”
Draco kisses Harold. “I’ll try,” he says.
“You always know what to get me. It’s beautiful, my dear,” Rodolph says.
Ever since Rodolph’s birthday, Harold hardly sleeps alone at night. Dad either comes to Harold’s room when he’s just gone to bed, or he takes Harold with him to his bed. Harold likes the last best. He loves sleeping in between his parents and waking up to the smile on his father’s face.
Harold smiles and rests his hands on his dad’s buttocks. He squeezes them and places kisses against his fathers back. Even when Harold is old, his father will still want him, and that is the best gift Harold has gotten today.
“Patience, my child. We first have a job to do. Then you can show me your devotion.” The Dark Lord steps away, he opens the small gate to the cottage that is the Potter’s home. Bellatrix looks over the dark hedge, into the window and watches the Potters play with their child. Potter makes puffs and coloured smoke erupt from his wand. The boy laughs and giggles from joy. Bellatrix pulls out her wand and clenches it in her hand. Her vision is clouded when she follows her Lord into the house. The Potters will pay for all they have done, for what they have taken from her, tonight Bellatrix will get her revenge.
And then Rodolph pushes him further onto his cock and the scarf tightens even more. The world turns black and Harold passes out. His limp body hangs backwards as Rodolph pulls him up and down on his cock until he releases his sperm inside Harold. Then he throws Harold off him and leaves him naked and dirty on his bed. Tonight they won’t wake up with Rodolph in their bed. Not now that it’s clear that Harold has chosen his favourite.
“You didn’t think you would get away, just because I had to interrupt your execution because of the traitor Malfoy brad?” Voldemort says.
In an instant, Draco’s clothes vanish in thin air and Draco shivers. He knows what is coming now and he can’t wait. The Dark Lord kneels behind him and lets his finger slide over Draco’s hole. The lubrication spell tingles and Draco smiles. The Dark Lord pushes into him and hits Draco’s prostate on his first thrust. It’s heaven as Draco finds the perfect rhythm of fucking and getting fucked at the same time.
Neville falls to the ground and rolls around. He loses the sorting hat. Something shiny is visible inside it. Dean stares at it in disbelieve. If he’s not mistaking, a handle of a sword sticks out of the hat.
Moments later, Harold wakes up when he’s lifted from the lounge chair. He blinks his eyes and then wraps his arms around Rodolph’s neck. “Love you, daddy,” Harold says.
And then he spasms once before his body stops moving altogether. His blank eyes stare at the sky as the last of his blood slowly leaks out of his dead body, mixing with the dirt around him.
“What do you think our fathers are up to now?” Draco asks. They are all staying the night too. Uncle Lucius, Mr Goyle and Mr Crabbe. Rodolph promised them some good entertainment. Harold thinks it’s the Muggle lady that has been chained in the basement for the last month. Mother had her fun with her. Harold has heard the woman scream and beg.
The world around Neville turns bright and colourful. Neville smiles as he looks around to find himself in a beautiful meadow. He lets his hands slide through the flowers as he walks towards the small home at the edge of a massive forest. Everything is bright and beautiful. The air smells fresh and animal sounds are all around him. Neville opens the door of the cabin and is greeted by a tight hug from his mother. He spots his father close by and he signs. He’s safe and at peace, in the place he always wanted to be when he was still alive, the loving home he never experienced before.
Draco doesn’t get it. Does Potter truly want to die? Who would want that? Isn’t it better to live, no matter what? Draco knows what it feels like to get close to dead. It’s not a pleasant feeling, the pain and fear. The question of what comes next. Doesn’t this frighten Potter? Where is his survival instinct? Why did he hideaway for all these months only to surrender now without a fight. It’s crazy. But that is Potter, isn’t it? The crazy boy that always gets away with everything. Well, this time he won’t. This time he will die and Draco will be free.
Harold laughs. “Because he likes to fuck and kill?” he asks.
“Daddy fucked the little boy and his mother pulled a rope around his neck. Mommy made her do it. The boy kept kicking and hitting the counter and daddy laughed a lot. And then after some time, the boy stopped thrashing. His movements slowed. And then he started shaking, really bad. His tongue started to push itself out of his open mouth and his lips turned blue. And then he stopped moving. His eyes stayed open and they looked weird but really cool.”
Draco’s fingers still inside Harold. “I want Harold to be my first,” he says without any hesitation.
The body bind gets removed suddenly and Neville falls to the ground. His body rolls around from the pain for a little in a fruitless attempt to stop the flames. Neville opens his eyes one last time, only to see darkness when his eyes melt away. He stops moving and just lays there while the flames eat his skin away for the next minute or so. Than Neville perishes and the flames fizzle out, leaving his burned body behind.
“You’ll be the example then,” Voldemort tells him. Then he turns to the crowd. “Let this be an example to you all. If you defy me, you will die. You and your family. I will hunt them down, every person you ever loved, and I will kill them all. There is no escape. I’m the only one you should put your trust in. Follow me, and you will live. Fight me, and you and your loved ones will die.”
In the corner of her eyes, Narcissa sees the green light that kills the Potter boy. She doesn’t care. That boy has cost her her entire family. He deserved to die. It should have been only him who passed away tonight. Draco didn’t deserve to go, to be slaughtered in front of everyone, downgraded to a whore for the Dark Lord’s pleasure.
Bellatrix starts to laugh. “You think our Dark Lord thought Barty was deranged? Is that why he preferred his company over yours? You’re delusional, Lucius.”
“Well, look what we have here,” a voice says from beside her.
“Yes, dad,” Harold answers. He yawns as he snuggles into his pillow.
The door of the bedroom creaks open. Harold lifts his head from Draco’s cock to see who it is. Rodolph smiles at him. “What do we have here?” he asks. “Are you playing without me?”
“I’m sorry,” she whispers. She should have run with him the day she found out her husband was dead. Killed by the man he always so eagerly supported. Nobody knows why the Dark Lord had killed Lucius that night when the Dark Lord returned. Narcissa had asked Goyle and Crabbe about it, but they both didn’t want to say or also didn’t know. The only thing Narcissa found out is that the Dark Lord had said something about Lucius being the reason a part of him had died and that he will pay the price for it. Lucius was killed and then eaten by Nagini. There had been no body to bury or mourn.
Draco nods and steps forward. He lifts Potter’s face and spits on it. “You will beg for mercy before the end,” Draco tells him.
“That it was,” Rodolph agrees. “But now you need to sleep. It’s way past your bedtime.”
“What would you like to do to her?” Rodolph asks.
“Harold doesn’t have chores. He’s a soiled brat,” Greg says.
“Bloody Merlin,” Draco says.
-x-x-x-x-x-
Only Narcissa hadn’t run. She had stayed and had tried to comfort Draco in his pain. She had watched him struggle until one day he found his voice and had done the Dark Lord’s bidding. He had killed Dumbledore and found his way into the good graces of the Dark Lord. He had found out about Snape’s betrayal and had saved them all. The Dark Lord had taken him into his bed and Draco had grown to become a man his father would have been proud of.
“That’s a good boy,” Bellatrix says. And then she shows Harold how to hold his lips over his teeth so he can take Rodolph’s cock in his mouth. Harold does as she tells him and lets his mouth slide over Rodolph’s cock.
“You leave him alone. He’s a hero,” Hermione yells. It warms Dean to hear Hermione say this. He might die here on the ground, bleeding out from a wound he inflicted on himself. But at least he’s considered a hero. It the right side wins, he will be remembered forever.
“I hate him,” Draco says.
“Mudbloods always taste good. I’m going to enjoy eating you,” Greyback says.
-x-x-x-x-x-
They walk towards the woods as the darkness starts to set in around them. The trees are large and threatening. Hermione wonders if this is where Harry walked when he went to see Voldemort. When he walked into this forest to die. Hermione should have known he would do it. She should have stopped him, should have convinced him that Voldemort would never keep his word. Only Hermione didn’t. And now she will die in the same forest as Harry. Maybe even close to where Harry was raped and killed. The only question now is if Greyback will rape her before or after he kills her? Hermione hopes it’s the last. That her death will be quick and painless. So she doesn’t have to suffer any more than she already has. That she doesn’t have to feel the same shame and pain as Harry and Neville.
For some time Narcissa just sits there, her hands resting on top of the robe, somehow still trying to connect to her dead son. She can hear fighting in the distant and she knows the war continues. Only she doesn’t care anymore who wins or loses. What is the point of a better world if her son isn’t here to live it? Why did they stay with the Dark Lord, if he only meant to end them all? The only thing Narcissa can still do is show him what an end means. Others will hear, and they will abandon him. Narcissa’s life can still mean something.
A young boy lays naked on the kitchen island. He’s older than Harold, by maybe two or three years. Daddy stands in front of the boy and pushes his hand over the boy's chest. He places kisses on the boy. Next to him lays an unconscious man. His face looks similar to the boy’s, and Harold thinks he might be the boy’s dad. Uncle Rabastan waves his wand over the man and then his clothes vanish into thin air. Barty laughs as he takes out a pair of ropes from one of the kitchen cabinets. Mother stands a little to the side, her wand pointed at a woman who lays on the kitchen floor. She’s the one that screams as she twitches around on the floor.
Rodolph agrees and then kisses Harold. They kiss and undress slowly. Harold is so turned on. He can’t wait to push the dildo into the woman’s pussy and destroying her from the inside.
“No,” Hermione screams. She slams into his face and turns around on the ground. She starts to crawl away, only to get grabbed by the legs and pulled back. Greyback’s claws slice over her back, tearing her shirt to pieces. Greyback pulls it away and then tears Hermione’s bra from her body. He forces his hands underneath Hermione and pulls her upper body upwards while squeezing her breasts. His tongue licks over Hermione’s neck.
Malfoy turns and signs. “Don’t think we’re there yet, Potter,” he replies.
“The same as being six, only with more chores,” Vincent says.
“Thank you, my dears,” Rodolph says. “This was the best birthday present ever.”
Bellatrix bows her head. “Of course, my Lord. I’m sorry I doubted you.”
“You’re beautiful,” he says with awe. He takes Draco’s arm and pulls him on top of him. Their lips collide as Harold lets his hands roam over Draco’s naked body. Draco wriggles his hands in between them and unbuckles Harold’s trousers and pushes them together with Harold’s pants down to his knees. When Draco takes a hold of Harold’s sweater, Harold sits them upright and lifts his arms in the sky. Draco pulls the sweater over Harold’s head. Their mouths only splitting for the short second it takes for the sweater to pass it. Harold’s hand travel down Draco’s body. He lets his fingers slide down Draco’s hole. He pushes against it a little. Draco is hard against his stomach. Harold wants to make him enjoy himself, just like how Harold enjoys it when his dad fucks him into oblivion.
After some time Rodolph takes his wand and spells some lube on Draco’s fingers. Draco pushes them in Harold’s hole to open him up for Rodolph’s cock, which is hard and leaking in anticipation.
Hermione can’t move. She’s rooted to the spot. Her mouth hangs open as she stares at the scene in front of her. Harry is naked, covered in blood and death. Neville is black and burned, just as dead as Harry. And Dean lays face down on the ground with the blade of the sword of Gryffindor sticking out of his back. Hermione had watched in horror when Voldemort ordered Dean to impale himself. For some time Dean seemed to like it. Until Ron attacked Voldemort and the spell was broken. A horrible cry had come from Dean. And now he lays silent in his own blood. If he isn’t dead yet, he will be soon. And there is nothing Hermione can do to stop it.
“She will,” Rodolph promises. He binds the woman's hand above her head and then breaks the Imperius curse.
“Fuck, he’s beautiful,” Rodolph says about the boy in front of him.
“Seamus, where are you?” Dean asks the sky. “I’m thirsty,” he says. His hands tremble in the pool of blood that grows around him. His breaths become shallow and he feels tired. He should just close his eyes and rest. Maybe he will be warmer when he wakes up. Seamus will be back and the world will be warmer. Sunny and bright.
When Harold wakes up again, he lays in his dad’s arms. Rodolph is sound asleep next to him. A blanket is pulled over them. Harold looks towards the other side of the bed. Bellatrix is staring at him and places a soft kiss on the top of his head.
Harold runs through the garden towards Draco, who sits close to the rose patch. Mom had opened the door for Harold and told him to go play so the grown-ups can talk. Harold didn’t mind, he’d been wanting to go see Draco for days now. He wants to tell him all about what he’d seen on his midnight stroll.
“Fuck, he looks hot,” Barty pipes in when he enters the hallway.
A green light flashes passed Dean. He looks at it in wonder. It’s followed by flashes of more lights. Green, red, purple. Dean smiles at them as his blood soaks his shirt. His hands push the sword in further until they hit some resistance. Dean takes a firmer hold and pushes hard. He needs to get the sword in further. It’s the only thing that matters. The sword needs to penetrate his whole body.
“Don’t cry, my girl,” Voldemort tells her. “He was a traitor, believing he could replace me.”
Draco holds up his finger. A small trickle of blood runs down it. Harold takes a hold on the finger and looks at it.
In the meantime, Harry carefully crawls away from them. Maybe he can make a run for it. It’s clear Voldemort won’t keep his side of the deal after he kills Harry. He said so himself. If only Dumbledore and Snape hadn’t died last year, then maybe someone would have been able to tell Harry how to stop this man. Harry doesn’t know for sure if Hermione, Ron and he have found all Voldemort’s Horcruxes. The ones they did find are destroyed, except for the snake. Harry hopes it’s enough. He knows his friends will fight to the end if necessary. He’s sure of it. Harry just hopes they will survive.
Harold sits down in a massive lounge chair and stares at his parents that sit on the sofa. Bellatrix gives Rodolph a small box that contains a new ring for him to wear. He loves it and kisses Bellatrix on the cheek.
Harold rests his forehead against Rodolph’s and tries to relax. He breaths in and out slowly. He’s wide awake by now and he is fascinated by how his mom is bend over his dad’s cock. Rodolph pushes her further down and she moans. The finger in his ass starts to move up and down in the same rhythm as Bellatrix’s movements. Harold lets his small hand slide over Rodolph’s chest and Rodolph takes his mouth in his again. They kiss for a long time and Harold is glad to notice that the pain in his ass is fading away and gets replaces by something else. It feels nice and Harold doesn’t want it to stop.
“Wow,” Draco says. “I wish I could have seen it. Father never lets me watch when he kills Muggles. He says it’s no good for me.”
Rodolph lifts Harold from the sofa and swings him over his shoulder.
The Dark Lord forces the door open to the baby’s bedroom. Potter’s wife stands there, holding her boy. Bellatrix wants to hurt her, destroy the one thing that this woman had taken from her. She raises her wand and bears her teeth. Potter’s wife puts the boy in his cot behind her and throws her arms wide, like that will save her child.
Draco nods and then smiles. “It didn’t hurt,” he says.
Harold swallows in the hope his heartbeat will leave his throat. “You want me to kill you?” he asks softly. The idea fascinates and scares Harold at the same time. To watch the light go out in Draco’s eyes, see that white sheen cover them for his eternal stare into nothing, it will be beautiful. But the idea of going through life without Draco by his side. To go to Hogwarts without the love of his life. It will be a nightmare.
“Let’s go back to our room,” Draco says.
“Open them, now!” Greyback yells.
Draco lets out a muffled no. Harold is relieved. He hates it when Draco is hurt, knowing Draco’s father wants him to keep his wounds to teach him a lesson. It’s brutal and unfair.
“See, you do want me to take you,” Rodolph says.
Narcissa takes her bra off and points her wand at it. The bra turns into a sturdy rope and Narcissa smiles. She ties one end of the rope around her neck and then steps on the grave she just made for Draco. She throws the other end of the rope over the branch of the tree that she can reach. She stands on the tip of her toes and then points her wand at the rope. A tight knot is formed around the branch. Narcissa tries to stand down on her feet, but she can’t. The rope is nice and tight around her neck, and if she would take her toes off the ground, she will hang.
“We need to be careful,” Draco says. “If we come to close the stupid peacock will bite us.”
“Don’t be a prude, Potter. Open wide for me and maybe we’ll make it quick and painful,” Draco tells him. Aunt Bella laughs from his side and Draco shakes his head. He knows he’s given the Death Eaters around them a nice show. It won’t be the first time, and probably also not the last. Depending on how many prisoners they will be taking tonight. Draco hopes Granger survives. He would love to see his aunt torture her again. And maybe Draco can take her too, fuck her until she begs for it to stop. The Mudblood deserves to die a horrible death for all the times she made Draco look like a fool in school.
When Harold wakes up again, he’s safely in bed. Draco is still beside him. His arms draped over Harold’s chest. He’s asleep. Harold looks at him and his heart swells. Draco looks at peace. His pointy features are softened and a red bruised hand is visible on his throat. Harry’s hand is marked on him. Branding Draco as his for the rest of their lives.
Dean sobs and shivers. Who was he mad at just a moment ago? He can’t remember who was just here. He’s sure someone was just beside him. Was it Seamus? Where is Seamus? Shouldn’t he be here and help his boyfriend?
Bellatrix shakes Rodolph’s arm off her. She steps away from him and tries to ignore the laughs of Rabastan and Barty behind her. She loves these men, but the high they’ve all been on since the Dark Lord had taken over the Ministry was going to get them all killed one day.
“Don’t make me go,” Malfoy pleads. “I’ll do anything,” he begs. “I’ll do anything you want me to. Just please don’t make me take this train.”
Harold moves a little closer and places a soft kiss on the back of Draco’s head. “Let me help you forget,” he says.
The Crucio lifts and Potter tries to stand up. Draco turns his wand and Potter falls back to the ground.
The rope holds and Narcissa smiles. She can feel it cut into her throat. Narcissa opens her mouth to breath, but no air finds it’s way into her longs. She will be with Lucius and Draco soon, where she needs to be.
“What are you doing?” Draco asks.
“Mommy knows I’m very patient. She’s just jealous that you love me more than you love her.”
“Yes, my Lord. It’s too easy, too simple. They’ve been hiding for over a year and now we just get their address handed on a silver platter. I don’t trust it.”
“Have it your way,” Voldemort tells him.
“I can’t,” he stutters. “Please don’t make me.” Tears start to fall from his eyes and Harry wants to reach out and pull Malfoy back towards him, closer to the white train.
Bellatrix moves closer and pushes some of Harold’s hair out of his face. “You’re daddy loved it. Did you like it too?”
Potter doesn’t look at anyone else except the Dark Lord. He doesn’t seem to notice all the Death Eaters around him, slowly creeping closer. Draco does and he wonders what they all think of this pathetic small boy that taunts their leader. He’s no threat and that is clear. Maybe now they will see the Dark Lord for the idiot he is.
“It’s what you always wanted, so why wait. You’ve got me. I’m here. You can kill me. Nobody else is going to die today because of me,” Potter declares.
“Nagini, he’s all yours,” Voldemort says. He steps away from Neville’s corps and joins his Death Eaters. His pet snake crawls towards Neville’s body. She’s going to eat him, isn’t she?
Bellatrix kneels next to her. Narcissa doesn’t look up to her, she just looks into Draco’s eyes. His once filled with life grey orbs. Now they are empty and dull, so different from how Narcissa remembers them. She used to love watching his eyes explore the world when Draco was just a baby. She watched them be filled with admiration, fear, confidence. They had always been the place where you could see what Draco truly felt. And now they don’t show anything anymore. A tear falls from Narcissa’s eye as she moves her gaze away from Draco’s eyes.
“The giant spawn can carry him,” the Dark Lord says. Hagrid is forced to pick up the Potter boy. His naked body is covered with Draco’s blood. He’s on full display as Hagrid holds him up. One of his arms slides out of Hagrid’s embrace and swings lifelessly while the crowd starts to move away from the clearing in the forest. Nobody pays any attention to Narcissa, sitting on the forest floor with the naked body of Draco in her lap. None of her friends asks her if she’s okay. They just leave her alone with her grief. A forgotten memory already.
Suddenly the hat on top of Neville burst into flames. Neville screams as the flames lick around his face. They heath up and Neville closes his eyes in a strange attempt to protect them. He’s in agony, as the flames burn his hair and face. They slowly travel down his body, licking over his neck and putting his clothes on fire. His entire body turns into one big torch. The pain is unbearable and Neville wishes he would pass out so all will be over.
“Please, don’t” the woman begs.
Draco smiles and takes a hold of Harold’s shoulders. “You are the best friend ever,” he says. Then he screams for Dobby who pops into existence next to the boys. He bows deep and waits for his orders.
Harold shakes his head and closes the door behind him before he lays down next to Draco. “Forget him. He’s an idiot.”
Harold lies awake in his bed. He stares at the enchanted stars on his ceiling. He wants to get a glass of milk. Only he’s not supposed to get out of bed. He could call for Binky and have him bring a glass off milk to his room. Only the elf tends to spill drinks all over the house, and it would be unfair if he gets punished for something Harold made him do. It won’t be the first time and Binky always looks so awful after he’s been punished by mother. So Harold would just have to sneak downstairs and hope his parents won’t notice him. They will be busy with uncle Rabastan and Barty. Dad said they were staying the night.
Neville screams. He swallows the flames and his throat burns closed. Neville’s scream dies abruptly. He can’t breathe. The lack of oxygen makes his mind shot down. He can’t think straight anymore.
Bellatrix stands up and pockets her Lord’s wand. She lifts the boy from his cot and holds him close to her chest. “Don’t worry, my son. You are safe now,” she says.
Draco shivers. If only he had been better at closing off his mind when he was younger. Then the Dark Lord would never have seen the silly teenage fantasies Draco had back then, of him and Potter in the Quidditch locker rooms, all sweaty and horny after chasing each other on the field. They had been fantasies that will never come true. Draco has moved on from them, has learnt what real sex is like, discovered how rewarding it is to have someone fuck his ass. He has no need anymore for fantasies. And he’s sure that Potter’s cock will never be as satisfying as the Dark Lord’s.
