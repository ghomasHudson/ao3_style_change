It’s so lively here just like Hogsmeade on the weekends we visited it, but like everywhere all the time. I woke up to a lot of bells and people chattering. It was so weird. Not in a bad way. Just new I think we’re planning to go see this mosque called Charminar? Malfoy also wanted to go to this fort later in the evening. We’ll see. Super excited!
and that I’m a buffoon, so I’m going to ignore him. We went boating after lunch. The sun was even brighter over the water, and the person in our boat was very interesting. His little daughter loves drawing flowers and Ganesha, and he showed us tons of pictures. I even brought one back with me. Malfoy is saying that’s because I’m a sentimental weakling. I disagree. It was just so sweet! Anyways. We got back early so we went to the market—oh wait. Malfoy was right. Nevermind. Actually, I think we went to the fort right after. There was so much traffic! I don’t remember much from the Fort. I knew the Fort was going to be boring as hell, but I didn’t deny him when he suggested we go there. Even though he tried to play it cool, he got so excited about the architecture, and it was so adorable. I wasn’t going to say no to
. This piece of stupid bendy muggle plastic- in itself it means nothing to me. It was always your dream of me passing my driving test, your pride in my skills at something so muggle, your excitement to see me drive up our driveway. Your hands teaching me, in your car. Your lips against my cheek when I messed up. Now… It tucks easily into the dirt along your gravestone, sliding in until only one pink rounded corner is visible.
. "Potter?" Malfoy asks again, his voice closer this time. Harry turns around triumphantly and immediately both he and the owl freeze. Any elation he has over succeeding plummets straight down into horror.
"Sorry Harry. They said they can't unship the package. It's already in the pipelines." They're all congregated in Harry's cubicle at the Ministry. Harry doesn't remember when Hermione and Ron had last been here, and secretly he can't help but feel a little grateful for that rogue box of sex toys for giving him his friends back for a short while.
The credits start rolling, and Harry turns the screen off. Taking care to not wake Draco, Harry slips off the sofa and kneels in front of it. For a moment, he lets his hand lay on Draco’s knee, drinking in the disarray of blond hair across rosy cheeks and the slight drool collecting at the corners of parted lips. Then, he brings both of Draco’s arms around his neck, cradles Draco’s head on his collarbone, and slides a hand beneath each of Draco’s thighs, guiding them around his waist. He hoists him up. The muscles in Harry’s shoulders protest, but he pays them no mind. Draco’s head rolls sideways, and Harry has to heave him upwards again to bring it back into the crook of his neck. Draco shifts sleepily, a hand curls loosely into Harry’s collar, another into the back of his shirt.
"Nothing to do but hope," says Hermione and flops down on the ground. "Say are we on top of Flourish and Blotts?"
That’s when I tried sending the letter by the way. But it wasn’t an emergency, so the postman refused to send it. Something about it not being auspicious.
Potter looks around for another second before he turns to Draco and asks, "Walk me around?" Draco agrees nervously and leads him around to the Chrysanthemums to the right and the Camellias beside them and the Lotuses in the back. He's afraid that he'll turn into his obsessive flower scholar personality who rambles and is decidedly not sexy, but Potter keeps asking
“Hey!” Harry protests. “I didn’t do it on purpose! It just… happened…” Parkinson just gives him a look like he’s worth less than gum stuck on her heels, and for the first time, Harry recognizes the hot, shameful feeling squirming inside him as guilt. It’s not that big of a deal. Really. It’s just a dildo. (And vibrators and fancy rope and anal beads and fluffy handcuffs and silk ties.)
. You noticed the beauty spot at the corner of his lips, the strength of his tan hands, the sway of his arse as he walked into the Great Hall. You noticed his knobbly knees and his sinful neck and his golden skin. You noticed the dimple in his smile, the bounce of his messy locks, the flicker of his eyelids in the sun. Then you noticed him wandering the halls at midnight, near your prefect patrols, and for some reason, instead of docking points, you followed him over to the kitchens.
Draco has a brief vision of that gruff voice talking all kinds of filth to him and nearly passes out. He has to physically shake his head to get his libido under control. He looks up through his blonde, nearly invisible lashes, and says, "Yes, Potter? How may I help you?"
"Draco's not in my league at all," mopes Harry. "Even with good clothes, Hermione. He and I, we're just not going to happen. He's just too gorgeous for me."
, you think. You always came. Like a pet trained by its owner, at the glance of Harry's eyes, at the crook of his finger, at the murmur of your name. "I didn't think you would." You shouldn't have. If you had any sense, the first time you saw him lost and small at Madam Malkins, you should've run far far away from this boy with a nest for his hair and the forest for his eyes.
"I didn't do it for you," she tells you. "I did it for Harry. He isn't a murderer. This isn't what he is."
Suddenly, a nearby elephant sprayed water everywhere with its trunk. The baby elephant shook its head violently, and then put its trunk in its mouth before settling down near Harry. They both looked away, cheeks red, as their hands dropped to their sides. Harry cursed. If only they had been interrupted a second later. Then he thought about how it would feel to actually kiss Draco, and promptly blurted a stupid comment about how grey the elephants were. Draco, bless his soul, took Harry’s offer and ran with it, somehow managing to hold a conversation off of Harry’s awkward, completely obvious remark. Draco was just too good.
"Because it's not right," she murmurs, clenching her jaw. "It's not right, what they're doing to you, after all you've done for us. All you've done for Harry." What you did. What did you do?
Slowly she turns around. With a sinking sensation, she realizes she forgot to factor in the sheer enormity of bird population at any time at the owlery and the menagerie across from the road. At least a dozen birds, owls and non-owls alike, dive towards her big bag of goodies. She screams. With a loud snap, the trap closes on two birds and a half, and in the ensuing ruckus and panic, it's a wonder she emerges with only two small scratches.
opened. It is no wonder then, that our story starts here (though one could argue it actually started at Hogwarts, or even earlier in Madam Malkins, we shall assume our audience is familiar with the convoluted saga that is the backstory of our two lovely boys).
Luna’s. Bloody hell. Fuckity fuck. Pansy had told him nothing important happened while he had been rat arsed. That cunt!
Potter’s also taken to writing a travel journal. He’s always scribbling away in it whenever we get back
Draco’s lips twitch and then break into a pout, and his eyes crack open to reveal molten silver in the dark of the night. “Bugger.” Then Draco turns onto his side and lets out a low groan. “
Potter just nods weakly. His face is as red as the underside of a Chinese Fireball by now. Draco is quite pleased. Nothing like getting a cute, flustered
"My, my, Potter. I didn't know we had a professional singer in the house!" he teases. Potter squawks, looking just like the owl he was wrestling in Draco's shop earlier.
More honks and I am driving again, and it’s raining harder, and it would be so easy to just swerve off this bridge, but
Draco quickly takes off his robes, rolls up his shirt sleeves, and ensures a couple of strands of his hair fall into his eyes. Hippogriffs are dancing in his tummy, and he thanks all his tutors for teaching him how to look bored and composed even when he was anything but. The door chimes, and he looks back down at his records, pretending not to notice the other man as Harry strides right up to the front desk.
When you look at him again, the whites of his eyes are red and wet, from crying, from the chill, from the rain, you don't know. His breaths are these great shuddering things that take you back to that night, his wand in your face, your heart stilled. Unlike Harry, your breaths are measured, slow, deep, and your eyelids are dry. Your hurt ran so deep, so cold, so old, that all you can do is feel numb, like a dead leaf twirling on an autumn tree, ready to fall, but unable to let go.
Pansy nearly spits out her tea. "What?" she asks weakly. "I thought you were joking about the Potter coming around everyday and taking you out to romantic dinners, thing. Ow! Don't hit me. It was a completely reasonable assumption considering your histories!"
When they ask you to identify Potter, you want to say no. But then your brain catches up to your mouth, and you say, "I can't be sure" instead. In the other room, Granger screams under the crucio. The Weasel shouts too, and Luna is shifting in her cell shaking her head at you, and you focus on Potter's swollen face instead. He recognizes you. Of course he recognizes you.
When they leave the pizza place, the cold wind nips Draco's cheeks and its chill seeps past his coat, but inside he's warm and alive and
He opened and closed his mouth a couple of times. And then he blurted, “But we’re supposed to be enemies! Archrivals!”
. He sets it down gingerly and then picks up the orange glass sculpture nestled in the center. When he holds it up, dozens of leaves seem to shimmer and glint as light fractures inside the glass. It's long and thin and bumpy (and Draco has no idea what it's supposed to resemble), but it's possibly one of the most beautiful things he's ever been gifted with. Gently, he turns his attention to the rest of the stuff. There are vines with miniature pumpkins running throughout the lining, and a bigger piece of vine is tied into a netted structure near the corner. Two long feathers are hanging off a string of beads in the same glassy orange material as the big sculpture. Beside it are two plastic pumpkins and a weird conical leaf imitation all just a bit smaller than an egg and with little platforms underneath them. Several shiny silky pieces of cloth in a variety of reds and oranges and yellows and browns line the bottom of the chest. There are even two fluffy brown bracelets with tiny spiders hanging off of them! (Though, Draco has no clue why they won't separate. Such horrible design, he's going to have to
Harry had spent the first half of the night staring at Malfoy from across the bar and complaining to Ron about how Malfoy shouldn’t be allowed back in England at all. Malfoy with his impossibly shiny hair and his sharp jawline and his quicksilver icy eyes. Really what was the git thinking, trying to take over Harry’s friends. Then halfway through the night, Draco had looked up at him and looked away guiltily. Harry’s complaining immediately turned into ‘I think Malfoy’s up to something again guys.’ Turns out, all Malfoy had been up to was shoring up courage to thank Harry for his testimony at the Wizengamot trials. But he had been drunk then. And so had Harry. He wondered what it would like to talk to Malfoy sober. To talk to a sober Malfoy. Somehow he didn’t think there would be as many theatrics involved. Then again, Malfoy had always been incredibly dramatic. Harry wondered about Malfoy often enough, and now he had a chance to get to know the pretentious git better. Anyways, his hair was so beautiful and shiny. Harry had always been a sucker for shiny hair.
On the way up from the bottom of the zip line– Potter’s first time on a horse. As always I was right and we did get horse shite on our boots. But Potter enjoyed so I suppose it was worth it. I had to lead our horse through some very narrow roads (if they can even be called that). Terrifying (but not more than Voldemort living in your house I guess).
"Not the issue?" Hermione screeches. "Your friend's drinking alone on a working night, and it's NOT AN ISSUE? None of this would have happened, if you'd TALKED to him about limiting his alcohol consumption and talking to us LIKE I SAID!"
At the beginning of time is a Wednesday afternoon. A Wednesday afternoon at Harry Potter's favourite place in the world:
Ron laughs gleefully. "Even better!" With his hands still over his head, he holds the letter open. "Let me read it out loud for you!"
Harry kicked at the foliage beneath his feet. “I used to teach Defense at Hogwarts. Well I say used to, but really I only did it for one year before I took a break.”
The only topic she doesn't touch on is Harry Potter. You don't ask. You're happy never to acknowledge his existence ever again.
"Hey! I did have to work in my life! Probably more than you did, you rich ponce," Potter shoots back, apparently comfortable in this familiar territory of snarking at each other.
Ron raises his hands. "Just sayin' mate. You already got him fluffy handcuffs and anal beads; I think you're past the kissing stage now."
"It isn't like that," Harry whispers. His lips feel parched and his head is buzzing and his voice is barely wisps of air. The perfect cover up comes to him right that instant. He shoves the bird in front of him and conjures up the most indignant voice he can. "I came here to cook lunch for you, but your owl attacked me the moment I set foot inside." The owl hoots indignantly at the blatant lies, trying again to peck him on the hand. This time Harry lets go. The owl hoots louder, plucks a tuft of hair off Harry's head (Harry shrieks just a bit) and flies off. "See?! It's violent!"
He opens the folder again. Name, age, date filed, address, guardians… His eyes drift to the top right, to the blue eyes of a young girl. Even in a wizarding photo, she holds herself so still and quiet—as if she was trying to fold into herself, not bother anyone with her existence. He takes off his glasses and rubs his hands over his eyes.
"I do! I love it," he exclaims, very very loudly. He wraps himself tightly around his boyfriend, and hides his face in the crook of Draco's neck. (A good thing Harry did that; after all, it is the only way he'll be able to get away with lying so blatantly.) "I love it
"I get it, Potter," he says and his voice shakes slightly. He turns away from Potter. "It was my fault. I was the one who assumed it was a gift, a token of your affection."
"Ah, no, Draco, you do remember what you were like in Hogwarts, don't you?" Pansy says sweetly, the tears from her laughing spell quivering at the corners of her eyes. "Potter this, Potter that. I was just appreciating what Hogwarts Draco would have thought of this right now."
Draco turns a baleful eye at her. "You're just jealous," he accuses her midsentence as he lovingly tucks his baubles back into the bubbly wrapping paper.
I guess what I was trying to say was… I don’t think you’re selfish. At least I try not to think that of you. I swear, I do. I try my best. I know you had your reasons, you tried your best, you didn’t mean to hurt me. (
Harry pulled Draco’s hand forward and put it beside his on top of the baby elephant. As Draco got calmer, Harry felt as if he should let Draco’s hand go, but he did not want to. It was so warm and nice. Draco had nice long fingers. Pianists fingers Luna would call them. He looked up at Draco, and Draco looked back at him with dark eyes. The platonic hand holding time limit had long since set sail, yet neither of them let go. In fact, if Harry had to guess, he would say that they were in fact leaning in. Just a little. Harry was sure it was not on purpose. Just a little more.
The first stroke of Harry’s warmed and oiled hands across Draco’s back draws a hum of pleasure. Harry digs his fingers in, seeking the bundles of tension and rubbing at them until all the muscles in Draco’s back feel like butter. As his fingers move, his mind begins to drift back to the notes in the second drawer of his cabinet. His brow furrows as his mind walks through the details all over again.
You both kneel on the cement, crying, until the rain stops, and the dawn breaks. You shouldn't do this. You don't deserve him. He doesn't deserve you. There's a thousand things wrong with loving your murderer, with loving an ex-Death Eater. He pushes the hair back from your forehead, and you close your eyes. An apology doesn't do anything, not when it's for almost murdering your boyfriend. And you know trying again with Potter will end in nothing but pain. You know it's not healthy, it's not good.
The owl tries to follow the package into the fire and Harry barely catches it before there is a fried owl in Malfoy's fireplace.
Harry turned around. A herd of big grey animals was slowly making its way down the stream towards them. The leader paused as they neared the two humans further down the stream. Then it raised its trunk and let out a loud rumble.
"Then they're all yours!" Draco beams. "On the house!" Potter nods, clearly feeling lost. Draco decides to help him a bit more. "Don't you have auror training to go to, Potter? It's striking one soon."
Harry’s mind stops, and for a moment he thinks of a tiny cupboard in a muggle suburb, of disapproving and unloving adult faces, of trying to hide away every little mistake he made in hopes of getting food (or even a pat on the head) that night.
"RON!" Harry squawks and tries climbing up Ron again. He'd seen that kit, yes, and he'd imagined the way Draco would look in half of those things, but a confirmation of shipping? When did he buy it? "Give it back!" Ron guffaws and tries to read what it says. "RON! I didn't order anything! I need to read it!"
With ears ringing, his mouth moves and out comes: "But they had my name on them." Harry touches his elbow and his mouth moves. Draco flinches back, and his breaths come shallower and shallower. "I thought… I thought they were a... a courtship..." he trails off in a small tinny voice Draco hates. And then he realizes. "Merlin," he exhales. "Merlin, I didn't even wait for you to explain." Harry's eyes are wide and he's shaking his head wildly trying to get a word in, but Draco doesn't let him. He doesn't even notice. "I just… I just assumed. Stupid.
Malfoy didn't hate him, he couldn't bring himself to open that door knowing there was a package of sex toys possibly flying towards them that very moment. It was probably better if he didn’t go inside anyway, Harry thought balefully. He'd end up spilling the beans to Malfoy if he did.
Harry just winked at Draco and said, “It comes with the job description. All you need to do is have a prophecy name the month you are going to born in. That is all.”
The night the Death Eaters test the cabinet, you offer to get Granger as many portkeys as she needs to evacuate all the mudbl—muggleborns from the castle. (You hope that includes Potter. You don't know what you would do if you had to face Potter tonight.) She shakes her head. Evacuating everyone would tip off too many people about your change of sides. Instead, she gets some Gryffindor army (the DA?) to be on hand if needed to do an emergency evac.
You weren't raised to believe in religion, but you send up a prayer to all the gods you've heard the muggleborns name, and some more.
Our three Gryffindors do in fact plan out their criminal activities very seriously—or well, more seriously than they ever did at Hogwarts. It takes them the entire Wednesday night, but they all agree that it was well worth it. Harry's love life is on the line, after all. They even come up with three (Three!) backup plans. As morning dawns, Harry feels quite sure that the package will not reach Draco. (Though, why there is a little, heavy weight in the middle of his chest at the thought of this whole fiasco, he cannot say. He doesn't want Draco to know he fancies the git, of course, he doesn't.)
When you get out of the ward, Theo deliberately trips you outside the common room and laughs when you fall over.
The chill of the night settles into your bones as you watch a falling star make its way towards the Earth. If Mother was here, she would tell you to make a wish. “
. Draco hated feeling slimy and gross after his shifts ended, but he always rushed to the kitchen first, never wanting to let Harry make the food before him. Stubborn competitive man. In go the tomatoes too, and Harry moves to check the rice.
"They will," she assures you. She assesses you, and then lowers her voice to add, "So will Harry." Your breath gets stuck, and your head swims. You've managed to not think of Harry for 1 day and 3 hours now. Not that it matters
First of all, Malfoy is so annoying! We finally got out of customs and all that good stuff at like 7 pm. It took us three hours. Three hours Hermione! Malfoy said that it’s because “This isn’t the English Ministry where you get a free pass due to the virtue of being the Saviour, Potty.”  Also there are so many people here! So. Many. People. And they are all wearing such bright clothes.
with Draco. The clock strikes nine and out hops a small unsuspecting pygmy owl. It stretches one wing out and then the other, getting ready for a day of good honest work. Then with a happy hoot and little twirl, it takes flight.
"Of course it does," chides Potter, and as if a dam has opened, he's suddenly much more talkative. "You did manage to open your flower shop," he says smiling lightly.
"I suppose you do," he murmurs into Draco's hair, and then pulls back to give Draco a deep lingering kiss. And Harry's not lying; Draco
"Would've been easier if you actually did." Almost as soon as the words fall from your mouth, you want to take them back. But you shoulder on. "For a long time I wished you'd done it. Wished you'd killed me." The first drop of rain falls on your cheek, wet and chilly. "I was ready for it, you know. I wanted it. Death." Harry's face is painted in horror to your right (why, you don't know, it wasn't like you put up a fight that night. Harry should've known, he should've noticed, he should've... he just should've), but now that you're finally speaking, you don't think you could ever stop. "I wanted it more than I wanted you by the end of it all. A full stop. A way for a bit of peace, a bit of rest, a bit of freedom. Oh the promise of it!" The raindrops are bigger now, sharp and stinging. Their wetness makes your cravat hang heavy around your neck like a noose. "I couldn't kill myself, not with the shame it would bring to the family, to my parents. I couldn't complete my task, not without losing Hogwarts and signing your death sentence. I couldn't give it up, not without killing my parents and ending my inheritance." You lift your face towards the heavens, feeling the droplets cut tracks across the valleys in your face. "I was tired," you say, "I was so tired."
She slips you a blanket and a pack of crackers, and you hold them tight to your chest as you watch her leave. You know the guards will rip them both away from you before the night is over, but this strange warmth inside of you, none of them can even see. Someone other than your parents gives a damn about you. It's quite...novel.
You press yourself against the freezing bars and, in a voice rasping with pain, tell her the name of every single guard who has tried to convince your mother to sell her body in exchange for being treated as a living being. Granger does not care much for you, but she does care for justice. And Granger's a woman herself. Her mouth tightens, and you know she'll take care of it.
Potter's such a gentleman—Draco sighs to Pansy over the floo—so proper to not kiss Draco on their first date. Shows how romantic Potter is, Draco nods wisely, and emphasizes how Potter is in it for the long term. When did Potter become so perfect?
As Potter reached Draco and the child, the toddler had started crying from shock. Draco, being incredibly inexperienced with children, started panicking.
Draco's breath stops, and before he knows what he's doing, he's pushed through the door, and right into the faces of two horrified Gryffindors. "What weren't for me?" he says, cutting right through something Hermione was saying. "What did you lie to me about?"
"What's the problem then mate?" Ron gently puts a large warm hand over Harry's shoulder. "What's got you down?"
When they were about to begin walking towards the kids’ houses, the littlest one, Sonia they’d learnt her name was, said something to her older sister and was put down. She then ran to Draco, and stood before him holding onto his pants.
He is yelling something and slamming you over and over again into the wall. You feel blood trickle down your collar, and you can hear lightning crack in the distance. He accuses you of poisoning Ron. He accuses you of a lot of things. You pay it no mind. You savor the feel of his breath on your mouth, of his fingers clutching your neck, even if it is in rage instead of love. He throws you onto the ground across from him. Iron hot pain flashes through your knee, and you back up to the wall. Potter's eyes are full of hatred as he raises his wand, and you are surprised at how much it hurts. Outside the window, the beat of rain on the shingles quickens into a loud drumming frenzy. He opens his mouth and you close your eyes, not knowing what to expect. You wonder if you will like the way you go out. You wonder what flowers Mother and Father will use for your funeral.
Suddenly strong arms wind around his middle and tan fingers grasp his wrists. Draco's heart stops beating. A warm chest plasters itself along his back, and a chin drops onto his right shoulder.
I wait until his car pulls away before rolling up my window. I wipe my face and drink some water. Check the mirrors, take some deep breaths. Spell the inside dry. Then I start the car again. I flick on the headlights, which I should’ve done ages ago. And I pull out slowly, steadily. Maybe I should’ve brought Pansy along with me. Maybe, I shouldn’t have taken the long way around. No matter, it’s not far now. I keep my eyes on the road right in front, but you don’t appear anyways.
We’re driving through some really hilly roads. A local called them the Ghat roads. They’re supposed to be really pretty. Personally, they are absolutely disgusting. I have thrown up four times in the last twelve hours we’ve been driving. We’re at at a muggle inn right now, stopped for some water. I refuse to get on the car for the next one hour. I swear to Merlin these roads were made just to torture me. Throwing up stomach bile is almost worse than Crucio. Almost.
"Then it's settled," Hermione nods, ignoring the rest of what Harry says. Ron nods with her. Then she reaches into her purse, and both Harry and Ron goggle as out come stacks of books with all kinds of birds on their covers. "I went ahead and got all this beforehand. Kidnapping owls is, after all, serious business."
“Oh my!” Draco exclaimed softly. The chick had clearly fallen out. Draco reached out his hands and scooped the baby up. “Where did you come from?” He cooed.
“Oh hey, darling,” Harry tries, running a hand down Scorpius’ back. “It’s okay. It’s all okay. Hey, here, shush, my love. I know, I know, I’m so sorry Papa upset you. That was unfair of him. But see, Papa
On the 30th, you ask your mother to set you a meeting with Astoria Greengrass. The Greengrasses are wealthy, their reputation is untouched, and Astoria's a lesbian. It's the best match that will let both you and Tori stay on good terms with your families.
.” You think of a green eyed boy with his annoying cowlick and his spindly limbs. You imagine him happy, smiling and laughing and loving. You imagine being the one to make him happy.
Granger yanks you up harshly into a sitting position, and your teeth clack painfully together. You roll your head over to look at her.
“When I was young, I dreamt that one day I would wake up and Father would walk in and tell me what a good child I was. I tried my best. I really did. I always pleased my tutors, I perfected my manners, I went out of my way to insult the Weasleys. It never was enough. I was never enough. And then he lead me straight into Voldemort’s circle, and well. That was that, wasn’t it.”
"Mate, maybe he said that because he didn’t want you to miss your training?" Ron consoles. "I don't think he hates you."
At my destination, five minutes later, I park where Granger parked the first and only time I’ve been here before. I grab the bouquet from the back seat, red roses, green leaves, white lilies, double check the rectangle outline in my breast pocket, and step out into the grass. I float through the rows, and despite it being over a year since I was here, my feet know exactly where to go. What path to take to you. There it is- the archway and little monument the Ministry insisted on building you:
“Because you’re tired,” Harry points out. Draco’s face scrunches up, but all it does is make Harry bop that cute pointy nose. “You haven’t even changed.”
have limits to what I will display on the table," he apologizes near the end. Harry sucks in a breath.
, he thinks faintly, as Draco finishes locking the front door behind him. Then he steps forward, and a conical leaf stuck to the front comes into sight.
Hermione huffed and curled her hands tighter about her steaming coffee mug. “A vacation Harry. You should take one.”
Suddenly, even bigger tears well in Scorpius’ eyes and he wails louder than ever. “NO SANTA CLAUS!” he screams, thrashing about in Harry’s grasp. “DADDY SAYS NO SANTA CLAUS!”
"A year and two months," Potter blurts and then squeaks. Potter's off—it's actually been a month and twenty-eight days—but Draco will take it. Draco hums, gently takes Potter by the elbow and leads him up to the counter. "Errr... I meant yes, long, it- yes, has been. It has long been. Yes," Potter stumbles, clearly panicking.
“She must have spotted it when she was falling out of the tree herself.” Draco murmured in agreement.
Harry blinked. Malfoy had just suggested they just explore. Bloody Malfoy. He was usually the one who would refuse to do anything that wasn’t ‘respectable’ (aka fun). Fluffy must have changed Malfoy more than he earlier suspected.
Zabini ducks out of the kitchen with the last of the crisps in their mouth, and Parkinson stands and brushes her skirt. “Well, toodles now darling. We’ll head out.” Zabini tilts their head and then reaches out a hand towards Harry before they leave. “Remember Potter. You hurt Draco, I hurt you.” Harry approves. He shakes the hand. “Understood, Zabini.” Then after a beat, he adds. “Same here.”
Two more lights, and another turn. By muscle memory, I stop right outside the third blue building. It stands there, looking the same, looking like it's still ours except- the for sale sign is gone. That rose bush there, that’s new. And the windows are cleaner. The little ornaments Teddy hung up at our door whenever he visited, they’re gone. The door opens, and for a second you walk out the door, wearing your apron, cake batter on the corner of your mouth. For a second, I’m walking down the path to you, jogging, running, to fling myself into your arms and let you carry me home. Only for a second. Because you’re not here, this house isn’t ours anymore, and I’m never going to be in your arms again. I start the car again, and I don’t look back.
Harry sips his coffee and smiles at her. She smiles back and pulls out a journal filled with wrackspurt sketches. She starts writing something, and Harry goes back to looking out the window. Today, Draco's arranging green leaves around some red, petal-y, non-rose-like flowers (the narrator can confirm this one knows shit about flowers and that in reality, it's Acacia and carnations respectively). Draco tilts his head slightly, and the sight of his long pale neck makes Harry feel a certain kind of way. He dreams of wrapping his hands around those slim hips, of nuzzling that neck, of kissing that soft smile Draco reserves for his flowers. Draco's long silky hair is tied into a ponytail that spills softly over his shoulder and gleams gold in the sunlight. His pointy chin has softened slightly with time, but his nose and his cheekbones are as pointy as ever, and Harry loves it. He lifts his hands to stretch, and Harry sighs out loud as that reveals the long lines of his body. Oh to be able to cuddle against that on movie nights.
Harry imagined going to Hawaii with a shriveled old man, as nasty as Aunt Muriel, slinging insults at undercooked lobsters and nearly started crying.
What does matter is that the windows of our little cafe provide an optimal view into the flower shop across the street. A flower shop run by a reformed Death Eater and drama queen extraordinaire, namely one Draco Lucius Malfoy. Harry Potter had figured this out exactly three weeks, five days, and three hours after
Into the pot go the onions, and he stirs them lazily, simultaneously flipping the parantha on the pan. He fishes out a tomato. The shower turns on upstairs, the thrumming sound making Harry smile softly.
“What is this? Put on a bit of pudge, have we?” his husband crows, coming up behind him to poke at his belly. Harry slaps Draco’s hands away.
Parkinson, however, seems to have no such compunctions. She ignores his small talk in favour of looking meaningfully at the vase above the both of them. “So, Potter,” she drawls smirking nastily, “I heard you gave Draco
The last thing he will remember from this night is lying passed out on the sofa, practicing a serenade to Draco on his wand. That is why, the next day he will wake up calmly (or as calmly as one can with a raging hangover). And he will get ready calmly, and collect the mail calmly, and put it away to read for later calmly, and forget to read through it very, very calmly. Unfortunately for Harry, this is also why he doesn't find out about his mistake until it's too late.
Of course, Potter would leave his door open. What would happen if a reporter found his apartment? Or worse yet a Dark Lord sympathizer?
“I don’t see any. I don’t see why your friends would choose to hire you for your physical strength. Maybe it was for your pretty green eyes. Would make anyone with sight hot.”
Draco laughed, petting Fluffy a little. Draco had a good laugh. “Wow Harry.” Harry liked the way Draco said his name, with a slight roll on a puff of air. “What an awkward little duck.” Harry blushed. “It’s okay I get what you mean. I didn’t know what to do with myself after the war. Mother was exiled from England, and the only reason I wasn’t in Azkaban was because of your testimony. Thanks again by the way for that.”
If you were to ask for something… If you believed in making wishes… Well, the whole point is that you don't anymore—believe in wishes and miracles and parents. But if you did, you know what you would ask for.
. Like real fun. Genuine non-flirty fun. He'd be lying if that doesn't make a piece of his heart irrevocably Potter's.
Draco’s head whipped around in horror. “Harry no! You’ll get killed you buffoon!” Harry ignored Draco. If Hagrid had taught him anything in their last twelve years of acquaintance, it was that any animal could be tamed. You just needed respect and love. And probably a little bit of giant in you. But that was okay. Harry could manage without. Draco hurried after Harry as Harry swam upstream to the Elephant herd.
"Yo, Harry!" Ron calls out from where he's organizing Harry's mantelpiece. It's Sunday morning, and Ron's helping (read: forcing) Harry to clean his apartment. Harry pops his head out of the kitchen with a questioning sound. "You didn't tell me about this! Man, George is going to be so proud."
A snowflake floats onto your right cheek. The sky is cloudless which means the flecks of snow fall from the stars just like grandfather's favourite snow globe. Another settles on your brow. It feels almost as soft as Harry's hair. You think of the nights you spent talking to him with your hands in his messy locks. You think of the way his smiles have gotten more beautiful these last weeks, the way he has started saying your name like a prayer, a love letter. You think of the happiness he filled your world with, even if it was only for the briefest of moments.
liar. But, Draco doesn't think there is a drop of malice in whatever happened today. After six years at Hogwarts as rivals and low-key mutual stalkers, a seventh on opposing sides of a war, and an eighth living in the same quarters, Draco knows ill-will and stalking in Potter's face all too well. And there was none of that today. No, the shade of Hogwarts Express that Potter had turned—it had to be something embarrassing for Potter. Something romantic. Something sexual, perhaps. So, Draco's willing to let it slide. Harry will tell him in due time, he's sure.
Alarmed, Draco gently asks, “Scorp darling? What’s wrong?” Scorpius rapidly shakes his head, his eyes filling with tears. “Is it the glass? You know that’s alright baby, it’s all fixed, see?” Scorpius shakes his head harder and scoots back from Draco again.
Malfoy hummed. “Let’s take a break then. Lay a sheet on the ground under these trees. Explore a little. The like. You should know. You’re a Gryffindor.”
Together they both broke the toddler’s fall so that the greatest harm to the toddler was the shock of falling from the tree. Draco prepared himself for high pitched wailing, but suddenly the toddler started giggling instead. She shrieked a word in her native language repeatedly, and Draco had the scariest suspicion that she wanted to fall out of a tree again. As Potter reached Draco, so did the other two girls, presumable the kid’s sisters, both looking shaken and guilty. The older one thanked Draco in tears while the younger one took the kid from his arms and cradled her in her arms.
Hermione spluttered indignantly. Ron on the other hand looked incredibly relieved. “So I’m off the hook right mate?” Harry slapped Ron’s shoulder and laughed some more at Hermione’s annoyed expression.
They both burst out laughing. Draco’s imitation started off a chain of imitations of other teachers and students from Hogwarts. As they talked, they inched closer and closer, until they were pressed up against one another from shoulder to knee. As Harry turned to Draco after one particularly lively retelling of the seventh years breaking into McGonagall’s alcohol stores, he found Draco already looking at him with an intense look on his face. His eyes were bright by the fireside. Slowly, Harry leaned in a placed a short kiss on Draco’s lips. Draco’s eyes fluttered close, his lashes a brilliant gold.
"What seems to be the problem?" asks Hermione alarmed. Ron hauls his best friend off his wife and dumps him on a dining chair. Harry digs his hands into his hair, and incoherently hands over the letter to Hermione.
Harry packs up, wears his muggle coat and makes his way to the front, making sure to bid the old lady at the front desk goodbye. A cool light breeze welcomes him as he steps out of the building. He looks up to the sky with not a whit of blue in it. It will rain soon; he should apparate home. Instead, he puts his hands in his pockets and starts walking. The streets he walks through feel just as grey as the heavens. Not the gloomy kind of grey, but like the grey of Draco’s eyes. The light peaceful kind of grey that feels infinitely bright. Harry’s favorite kind of grey. The sounds of children laughing echo in the distance as Harry approaches the neighbourhood playground. He watches as a football bounces over the wall, and the kids chase it across the street. They’re all so very
Draco flushes. "Yes, well. I like flowers." Draco feels a bit self-conscious as Harry's eyes rove over his entire shop.
Your eavesdropping spell fell at the same time that you did. There, on your knees behind a suit of armor, you opened yourself up to the reality. People like Harry James Potter don't fall in love with people like you. People like you don't get to escape your fate and name. People like you don't get happiness. No. The only thing you deserve is pain.
At the next crossing, the map tells me to take a right. I take a left. Onto a path I’ve walked innumerable times, waking and asleep, under a canopy of stars and bright sun, alone and… alone. That park over there? You wouldn’t know it, but it has a tire swing- your favorite. Creaks every other oscillation. That corner there? An ice cream truck parks every Tuesday evening. Sells all of Teddy’s favorite flavors. This spot I’m passing here? No trees overhead, but buildings block the sun in the evenings. Perfect place to park. I always wanted to bring you here. I wanted to bring you to so many places, do so many things, buy so many presents…. You didn’t give me the time, the chance. (
No one comes to visit you after Granger leaves (once you imagine you can hear Potter’s breath at night). You lay still the entire time and think of everything yet nothing at all.
Harry looked over his shoulder, in the middle of pulling off his shirt. “I’m going to into the water of course. Aren’t you?”
"Yeah, yeah, yeah," Potter bops his head with his eyes closed and twirls around with a spatula in the air, showing off the long, lithe line of his body. Draco's mind breaks a little, and he gurgles. Just a little. Potter freezes. His green eyes are wide when he turns around. Draco watches Potter's Adam's apple move up and down as he gulps.
Like always, Harry comes home to an empty house, a noisy head, and a full liquor rack. He jiggles the key out of the lock, throws his robes over the couch, and leaves his socks under the dining table. As always, the silent darkness makes his heart feel heavy; he turns on every light in the house. In those early days after leaving Hogwarts, all he needed to do was firecall someone, anyone, and he'd have company. But now it seemed as if everyone, even Ron and Hermione, was too busy for Harry. Relationships, kids, work—they'd all grown up. And left Harry behind. It was all fine by Harry though—he didn't want to be
“It’s not my fault you insist on making those delicious treacle tarts each week!” he protests. Draco grins and rests his crossed arms on Harry’s shoulder. Harry frowns at their reflection in the mirror. “This is unfair. Why don’t you gain any weight? It’s always me!”
Remember how I told you in my last letter we were going to look for a farmhouse to stay in on our way to Cuttack? Well we found one. We stayed at this place owned by an old couple. They were super sweet, and their food was amazing. We saved their granddaughter when she fell out of a tree, so they actually invited us to their youngest daughter’s wedding in a week. Malfoy was a bit put off that I agreed to come without asking him, but since he didn’t have any better plans, we are going.
Harry sighed. “It’s been three years now. It just became a little too much for me. Too many memories. Too many missing faces. Fuck. I kept walking past the corridor where Fred and George escaped from Umbridge, you remember that? And I would keep expecting Fred to pop up and ruffle my hair.” He ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t think I’m going back. I kept thinking about it when I was in England, but these past few weeks have given me a perspective on how being happy feels like. I don’t ever want to feel the way I felt at Hogwarts again.”
In Draco's defense, the whole set-up is really quite beautiful. The vase is tall, elegant, and classy, and within it, a tasteful assortment of autumnal flowers and leaves complement the glass dildo. A string of glass beads wraps around the neck of the vase, and shiny silk and pumpkin vines net cover the rest of the vase. Strategically placed magical orbs shine light into the piece, scattering thousands of tiny rainbow segments across the room.
The first time Harry made love to you, it'd been a week since you'd been to the seventh floor. Father had owled you just an hour ago about rumors of you betraying the cause. (When did he get out of Azkaban?) You wrote back:
First of all, you wench! You put a tracker on me! I cannot believe you. You’re worse than Rita Skeeter with your inability to stay out of everyone else’s business! I swear to Merlin’s saggy tits you need to find yourself a life for yourself. A tracker! A bloody tracker! The ones our parents used on us when we were younger! Do you have no sense of respectability you absolute bitch? Do you have no sense of my respectability? Why am I friends with you?
"I happen to like your left bollock, Ron," grumbles Hermione. Harry gags. "Don't go around betting it."
"You can't do that without turning into a tomato already, Mate," Ron grimly informs Harry. "And yes, Hermione. Not the issue. We have to focus on how to do damage control now. Come on now, look at Harry." He makes his best pleading eyes and gestures towards Harry.
"Oh please," he scoffs. "You think you could abandon your lord to hang out with Potter and get away with it?" He mockingly ruffles your hair. "Think of it as a kind reminder, Draco dear. You're lucky I like you. The Dark Lord wouldn't be pleased to find out what you've been doing." He kisses your cheek and heads up the stairs. "Chop, chop, Draco. You better get to work!"
Parkinson (she did try to hand him over to the Dark Lord and all), but for Draco’s sake, he’s at least going to try to be civil.
When the alarm goes up, you jump straight into action. While most your classmates prepare for battle, you track down every first, second and third year Hogwarts still has in its bowels, and you hide them far far away from the war. They scream and they fight you all the way, but you don't mind a few extra firstie bite marks if it means that all the kids are safe.
"Calm down, darling," she says as she steps out from her mother's old parlour. "You say that at least three times a day you know. It has lost quite a bit of its novelty." She has a cup of tea in her hands and a shawl around her shoulders.
Then you think of never kissing that dip near his hip-bones. Of never feeling his fingers wrap around your wrists. Of serving the Dark Lord trying to kill the man you love.
Everything’s still. Outside, the rain continues to fall. Inside, all I hear is my heart thumping. The dash gleams a steady blue; the only light in the middle of this storm. Am I even breathing? I can’t tell. Maybe I am dead. Maybe I should be dead. The last shards of your presence are gone now, and I’m all alone again. In your car. Slowly, I pry my fingers off the wheel, one by one. I put my car in park and take my foot off the brake. I raise my hand and it’s steady. I’m steady. I’m alive.
Neville nervously chuckles. “I thought you were right? Hermione told me.” Then his eyes widened. “Wait did she not tell you?!”
Draco watched as Potter sweet-talked the old couple who owned the wooden hut they’d rented for the night. They seemed strongly affected by Potter’s awkward charm. Draco would know. He found it more endearing then he should. Draco nudged Potter, nodded at the couple, and started walking towards the fields. The day was warm, but the evening sun was not too sharp. It was brilliant. Draco wandered about aimlessly for a bit.
Azkaban is not as cold as the Manor, your Manor, had been. In fact it is quite a relief, for the bars caging you and your family in also cage the rest of the world out. Here, in the damp, desolate prison cells, you can lay your head down without worrying about werewolves or snakes or Dark Lords. Here, your mother does not hesitate to put her fingers in your hair, and your father bothers not to scold you for dishonouring the Malfoy name. This place, which is meant to be your nightmare, becomes the closest thing to peace you know.
“What the hell you doing, mate?” the man with an umbrella and red face snaps. I just sit there, quiet, wide-eyed as the rain water soaks through my side of the car. “You out of your bloody fucking—” his eyes catch on something on my face, and he stops. My fingers reach out to touch my cheek, and it comes away wet. “Mate?” he asks, blue eyes suddenly a little softer, reminding me of the Weasel.
Mother wants you to see a mind healer. It's all bullshit. But it's bullshit that makes Mother happy.
Okay," Harry decides. "Okay, yes. I am going to talk. To Draco." He breathes in deeply and puffs his chest out. "I am going to talk to Draco." He throws down an extra tip, kisses Luna's forehead, and determinedly walks out of the cafe. Luna hums happily and takes to finishing the rest of Harry's coffee.
Fuck his life and Aunt Muriel and Ginny’s red hair and the chipped corner of his teacup which had just stabbed him in his lower lip. Fuck that chipped corner in particular.
Ron, who is still about fifteen meters up in the air, ducks his head down to look at her, and nearly falls off his broom when he catches sight of his pregnant wife trying to whack a particularly enthusiastic peacock with her wand. Like a good husband, he immediately ignores her words, abandons the pygmy and dives.
"We did," she smiles. "Harry's going to be so happy. Let's go down and get the package, shall we?" Ron grins and they both get to finding a way down from the ledge they're on.
, he tells himself. No projecting. Then he gets up. It’s getting late anyway, and he’s read the file enough times that it’s burned into his memory. It’s time to go home.
“We should get going now,” Harry says after a minute. “Don’t want Scorpius or Teddy to throw tantrums if they wake and their gifts aren’t under the tree, do we?”
Oh! Oh, that was wonderful! Harry could come clean about the rest of the toys too and not lose Draco. But then Draco continues with an adorable little frown, "I'm so sorry, Harry. I will adore everything you give me; I promise! Everything but those rings—they were just so ugly!" Harry is going to
You tilt your head, watching the curls on his head ruffle in the wind. Your eyes roam his lithe figure, drinking every angle and color in, as if he's the oxygen that keeps you alive. In his absence, you've alternately managed to convince yourself that seeing him would right every wrong in the world, or that his sight would tell you how far you've moved on from him. You were wrong. His eyes bring back every single minute of Sixth year that you thought you'd packed away, every memory that you thought you'd dealt with, every hateful feeling you thought you were over. His sight brings you pain. But you'd still die for him. You'd still kill for him. You're still bloody in love with him.
I kneel, put down my bouquet, and kiss the top of your gravestone. Then, I sit back and from my breast pocket, I take out a folded letter, the last words you left me, (
Harry wished to touch that magnificence. Then he decided he was going to touch an Elephant. “I’m going to go pet it.”
. Harry quickly tries to step out of his Santa suit and reach out to Scorpius too. But Scorpius twists away from him. “I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU BOTH!”
Luna, the good woman, had brought him his favourite comfort food from Fortesque’s without prompting. How she always knew when he needed comfort, Harry would never know. She sure was brilliant.
You don't know who deserved what. All you know is that you've nothing left. You wish Granger had just let Potter kill you. What will you do now? Hide away from the rest of the world and let the Dark Lord kill your parents? Go back and watch the Dark Lord kill Potter? You could go renegade, and you giggle at the thought. "I deserve it," you murmur happily, and Granger's hand stills on your arm. "It's not like I had anything else to offer him." You're not sure you even make sense at that point, but Granger must have seen something in your face because she gasps.
“Hey look, Scorp, it’s me!” he cajoles again. Scorpius sees Harry and throws himself into his Daddy’s arms.
Pansy chokes again and does a poor imitation of a dying fish flopping about. "Oh, darling! I'm sure that's not necessary! Potter doesn't like publicity, does he? I don't think he'll appreciate that. Plus what if some muggleborn got jealous, and stole it away from you? It does seem like it's quite precious, doesn't it? It probably is very dear on the market too! You know Potter would pull all the stops to seduce
“Draco…” Pansy repeats, stepping in behind me. When she leans forward into the window, her hair falls in straight black lines, sliding off her luxurious coat and spilling in. “You don’t have to do this, Draco.”
"The proposal. For courtship," Draco says patiently. "I will enter into a relationship with you." Potter sputters. "Of course, now that we're lovers, you shall call me Draco, and I will call you Harry."
. You wanted to climb inside him, to cut open his heart and hide yourself away in it, to surround yourself so fully with him that the rest of the world never touched you again. For once in your life, you wanted to see what being good felt like, and being with Harry was the closest thing you could do.
And then Granger asks you a question you hadn't discussed before. "You and Harry James Potter, also known as the Boy-Who-Lived, were in a relationship for three months in sixth year. Please tell me about that." In the silence that follows Granger's question, you can hear your heart beat loud and clear. It takes you a moment to process the question, and suddenly everything goes still within you. You lick your dry lips and look at Granger. Her gaze is firm and knowing. She did this on purpose.
Their plans take-off during lunch break on Monday. Even Draco, who has at the moment no idea of this pinnacle of Hermione's planning genius, feels the gravity of the day when he catches Potter standing outside his shop fixing his hair and leather jacket, and nearly breaks his neck back-pedaling to double-check what his eyes saw. Potter. Potter dressed up.
Out on the terrace, the sky yawns big and black over your head. Thousands of stars hold their breath, and the snow covered world stands still around you. Turning your face heavenwards, you can pretend you're in Wiltshire. If you close your eyes, you can almost feel Mother's soft hands caress your cheek and Father's strong arms wrap around your shoulders. The air turns sweet and spicy from the elves cooking in the kitchen, the stone under your hands smooths into warm granite, the Manor's fields quietly rustle in the distance. If you turn around now, the peacocks will be strutting across the gardens, Mother's rose bushes will be in full bloom, the fountains will be spouting clear water. Any moment now, you will go inside and Mother will fuss over your crooked collars. Your father will smother a smile when you abscond with his cufflinks again, and the elves will let you play with the dough to keep you out of any further mischief. This is what it means to be a Malfoy for you—what it meant to be Draco Malfoy. This is what you made yourself a slave for, what you kill for. This is what you put in danger every time you lay with Potter. You think about doing your duty as a Malfoy, about leaving Potter forever, about succeeding in your tasks and making everything perfect at home again.
As they came to a nice shady spot, and Potter pulled Draco down to sit on the ground with him. Weak the savior was.
You didn't go back to the cabinet the next day. Or the day after. Or the one after that. It wasn't like the Dark Lord planned on you succeeding. You were done being a Malfoy. (What a fool you were, thinking being a Malfoy was something you could run away from.)
, but they were also inexplicably thrilling. Every new, dare you say, kind friendly gesture, meant another night spent obsessing over what it meant, what Potter wanted, what he would do next. And since thinking about Potter meant you weren't thinking about the brand on your arm or the poison in your trunk or the corpses at your home, you let yourself think and obsess and watch over Potter in a way you never had before. And you started noticing
"If killing me meant Harry would be happy, I was okay with it. If signing my death sentence by spying on the Dark Lord meant Harry would be safe, I was okay with that too," you say clearly. Gasps go up all around you.
Bells chime at the door, and Draco angles himself just so that his best profile faces the visitor. He dithers for another second, giving Potter enough time to take in his figure, before turning around and making a show of putting his hands in his trousers and looking surprised at Potter's presence.
wordless charms. Draco's sure there are hearts in his eyes. Potter's eyes crinkle in a smile, and he gestures Draco out the door. He obliges and follows the food out to a small glass table with candles lit up all around it. His breath catches and he glances towards Potter who is nervously waiting for Draco's reactions. If he had any doubts about Potter's affections, he had none now. "It's perfect," he proclaims and with a flourish, he settles into his chair. "Come, Potter. I'm hungry."
, you remember yourself thinking while you were delirious from the hit to your head. It's not a bad idea. You turn over and start plotting.
“Hey, hey! Look, it’s me, Scorp!” Harry reassures, but Scorpius wants none of it. He screams and screams.
. Your fingers trailing down my cheek, a moment still in time, short, criss-crossing, everlasting, a breezy kiss against my lips, your scent stronger than I’ve smelt it since last April- and I would- I would
You read all his letters. Then you do it again. He is beautifully sorry in all of them. He spins a tale of anger and misplaced revenge and finding his sexuality and being a teenager in a war. It's all deliciously tragic.
Eventually though, all good things must come to an end, and so does Potter's lunch break. Potter leaves with a magically protected Iris on his lapel. But before he goes, Potter turns around and says, "This was fun Malfoy. Catching up with you. We should meet up again, not during my lunch break, so we can, like, hang out."
It's Ron who notices the brown square package attached to the small owl's left foot. "Hermione," he says slowly pointing to the pygmy owl perched on the roof next to them. "Is that..."
On the 31st, You find yourself at the edge of Thames. Like on any proper London summer day, a thunderstorm is quite close. When you were a kid, they would scare you something honest. Now, you barely blink as the dark clouds gather over the roiling river.
"I errr... I..." Potter trails off. "Date. I wanted a date. I mean, I like dates. You smell like flowers. Do dates have flowers?" Potter's picked up speed, and now he's rambling like a train speeding through a tunnel. "Er, do you want to go date flower picking?...uh...I mean not that they'd be pretty. Not like you. I mean like your flowers...er...Like those ones. They're pretty." Potter's blindly pointing at the only non-flower, leaf arrangement in the store. Potter's so
And here, perhaps you, just like Ron and Hermione, might make the mistake of assuming that their harrowing experience is over. It isn't. For the very next moment, a black, post owl flies over them. Hermione shudders. She was never going near birds again. Ever.
For reasons, this sets Pansy off even more, and she practically guffaws. "I'm sure," she gets out, "that Harry's love for you," another round of giggles, "is very big."
) The light’s green. It’s starting to rain. I squeeze my eyes shut. What do I even have, without you in my arms? It was so easy for you to leave, but did you ever think of me? Did you realize I
Then Ginny picked up Harry’s hand and looked at him with a pleading expression. He might not dating her anymore, but that expression still made him cave to her every request. He already knew he was doomed. “Please Harry? We just want to take care of you. Look you don’t even have to do anything. Just let us book you a vacation yeah?” Harry furiously swirled his cold tea. “Harry. Please? Pretty please?”
Draco sighs. “I… Just its Harry, you know. It’s just the fact that Harry planned it so perfectly to ask me out. For me! He did it for me!” Draco looks down. “After the war, I didn’t think anyone would ever do anything like that for me. Even before the war, it’s always just been my parents, and you and Blaise.” He sighs. “I know I’m not the easiest person to like. But Harry… For Harry to give me a gift… A gift chosen specifically for me, not just a formal flower arrangement or a crockery set or jewellery… Pans, you know how it is in pureblood traditions.” Harry can’t see Draco’s eyes, but he has the strongest suspicion that they’re a bit wet. (Or perhaps it's Harry’s own eyes that are wet, and Harry’s just projecting. Or maybe it’s both.)
. Harry half grabs the package halfway there and pulls with all his might. The owl pulls back, its claws dragging across Malfoy's furniture. Suddenly, both of them lose their footing and go tumbling to the ground, knocking over a couple more bouquets on their way down. The owl makes an ungodly sound right into Harry's ear. Wings beat in his face and he catches a mouthful of feathers. But he doesn't let go.
“Okay, now you just want a picture of my arse,” he says. His husband sticks his tongue out, making a 'bend over' motion with his finger. “Oh come on,” Harry groans quietly. “You have enough pictures of me holding this stupid bag. Is there no way to satisfy you?”
, Draco. It's for a version of you that never existed." She squeezes your shoulder tight, as if that would give you strength or courage or, Merlin forbid, hope. "I need you to remember that. Promise me, Draco."
When Draco reaches Harry's apartment that evening, he can smell the curry through the door. It smells
. Apparently tired of waiting, the owl glides down to the floor and pecks insistently at the door. Harry wonders if he should go over and let it in, but a little girl on the street beats him to it. The owl ducks its head and hops into the flower shop. Harry has to conceal a small smile.
The Carrows will make sure the wizarding population dies out. You're sure of it. By the end of the year, you don't think a single child will be left alive under their watch. You can't say whether being forced to torture first years is worse than watching the atrocities happening at the Manor. At least there you got useful information to pass on. Here, you can only try and fail to save everyone around you.
With both the eldest Weasleys done, everyone else swarmed Harry to say their farewells. Harry finally pushed out of the crowd of his loved ones after half an hour, with Victoire hanging off one leg, and his robes hanging off his other shoulder. His hair was even more of a disaster than usual (courtesy of one Fred Weasley), and he was generally ready to leave. Especially since the portkey to India left in half an hour.
Granger continues: "During this time, you were privy to his plans against you and Voldemort. Why did you not disrupt or report back to anyone on any of these plans? Why did you decide to work undercover to destabilize Voldemort's plans?" Potter looks horrified, as if he has just realized you knew all along. As if he is
just to keep Harry happy and then Harry would find out and be gutted and then Draco would make it up to him with sweet
"Harry! Mate! Come right through!" Ron says cheerily. He steps out into a warm cosy sitting room and settles onto the sofas right beside Hermione.
Harry patted down his robes and ran his fingers through his hair. He thought of not having any contact with the Weasleys for the entirety of the trip and felt a little sick. The only memories he had without the Weasleys or Ron and Hermione in them, were, quite simply put, shit. The only thing keeping him from running the other way was the thought that he would meet Malfoy. Harry wondered if Malfoy knew they were going to India together. Probably.
. He can feel a little bit of blood trickling down his face already. He scrambles a bit to get a better grip on it, and the little blighter pecks wildly at his hand. If the bird thinks this can defeat Harry, it's wrong. The owl pauses for just a second and Harry seizes the moment to detach the package from the owl’s feet and scrambles up. The owl tries to dive bomb for him, but he leaps out of the way. Never before has he been more grateful for grueling auror training. The fireplace is three paces from him; the floo powder is right there next to him. Two steps, he throws in the floo powder—the owl hits his back—"190 THE STRAND" he calls—there's a beak digging viciously into his elbow as the owl leaps for the package—the fire turns green—and the bell chimes as the door opens.
Potter starts, panics, and then runs out of the shop, with a trailing thank you behind him. Draco giggles and rests his chin in his palm as he leans over the counter, watching Potter leave. That man's so cute. Such a catch. Plus he likes him. Draco! Potter likes Draco! Draco's going to have so much
Sonia babbled something in her native language, and Draco looked at the eldest girl for a translation.
By the time he’s done with the chicken tikka masala, Draco has finished his shower and is waiting for him in the sitting room.
Now if there's one thing to know about Draco Malfoy, it's that he loves gifts. Gifts in any shapes or sizes, for any occasion or declaration, by friend or foe, with or without wrapping—everything goes. And a gift from Harry? It practically screamed good news! He sits down right there on the carpet and rattles the box around. It's surprisingly heavy, and nothing rattles inside. Draco tilts his head, with a wide grin on his face. "What did you get me?" he asks. "It doesn't sound like books or crockery and it doesn't look like wine." Potter looks a little peaky from nervousness, and he opens his mouth to say something. "Oho! No! Don't spoil it! I have to open it first!" He deftly slips a nail under the flap and slices it open. A dark wooden chest emerges. It's not that big but it's elegant and classy. Potter's turning red. Oooooh Draco hopes it is something romantic! A note slips out when he flips up the handle to the chest.
believe he doesn't deserve it, do you?" Small tendrils of a sick feeling crawled up your body. Who was Harry talking about?
All the colour drains from both the Gryffindor's faces. "Draco," pleads Harry, getting up and reaching towards him. "I know how this sounds, but trust me, it's not..."
Draco glances up at Harry through his lashes shyly as if to gauge his reaction, and his face drops "Oh," he says, sounding gutted. "You look like you're going to cry. You don't like it."
Ron shoves a couple more chips in his face and twirls around on Harry's wheely chair. "That sucks mate," he says with a full mouth. "But hey! Harry made progress. Tell her Harry!"
Harry pouted some more. Eventually, Draco decided to conjure her a little playpen with a top (Draco refused to call it a cage), and hung her from a low branch on a nearby tree. He then proceeded to spell her playpen against any imaginable danger including predators, falling down and even a snowstorm. Once he was satisfied she was safe, he quickly undressed and entered the water himself.
"Nonsense," says Ron. "You're so much better than him Harry. Come on, let's get you into a good outfit."
“Oh fuck the hell off,” Harry grumbles, then shoves Draco who bursts into giggles. Harry gives up and spells his suit larger. Then he shrugs on his Santa coat, tightens up the belt and puts on his hat. Draco comes back to wrap his arms around Harry from behind.
The first time he talked to you without hatred in his eyes was during potions. It was two months into term, when you'd finally started realizing the sheer futility of trying to fix the cabinet. Mother's handwriting had gone from shaky to illegibly bloodstained, and Aunt Bella had started sending you updates on the number of muggles being tortured in your dungeons. It was after four sleepless days working on the cabinet, after your first failed attempt to kill Dumbledore, after Severus' first hints that he was reporting back to the Dark Lord. You were having panic attacks every three hours and failing all your classes, and you didn't care because you were failing at life too, and he would kill your parents if you failed, and you hadn't slept for days because your life was a living nightmare, and your hands were shaking, and you'd spilled the last of your moonstone all over the floor, and
"Draco, no wait! You've got it all wrong!" Potter tries to hug Draco, but Draco stumbles backward, and then scrambles for the door. He can't breathe, he can't think, he can't
Draco thought of itty-bitty Potter with large round eyes thinking so in the darkness of a cupboard. The thought made him unbearably depressed. He shuffled to lay properly on the ground (oh how Potter was corrupting him), and rolled over to face him.
This Wednesday, at the start of all time, is in most ways just like all other Wednesdays that came before it. Harry wakes up early, goes for a run, shows up to auror training five minutes late, runs more laps, and works his butt off until lunch, then he walks all alone to the cafe, drinks a vanilla latte, and stares out the window intently. After lunch, he's back at the Ministry getting bored in classes and feeling jealous of all his friends who have their lives together. At night, he will go home and get ready to do it all again the next day.
Ron sighs dramatically. "Oh, Harry you're such a blushing virgin." Harry sputters in indignation. "Okay, okay, here, look we can both read it, how about that?" Finally, Ron brings the letter low enough for Harry to be able to read the first half of it.
But your throat hurts, and everything in you is stuck, and all you can do is stare at the space between your pinky and his on the railing, remembering cold flagstones underneath you, green curse fire above you, Harry's murderous voice around you, and you remember how you hurt that year, all the time how you hurt, how you still hurt sometimes (often-a-times).
Potter opens his mouth and then closes it. Hmmm. Seems like the Boy Who Lived isn't the Boy Who Plans Discussions Beforehand. Draco taps his foot. "Come on, Potter."
Potter’s being weird. No insults, no jibs, no punches. He’s, dare I say, might actually be trying to befriend me. He called me ‘mate’ yesterday. How absurd. As if nothing happened during the war. As if I I haven’t accidentally almost killed his best mate, as if he hasn’t accidentally almost killed me. As if [indecipherable scribbles]. I don’t know what to do Pansy. I don’t know how to deal with this Potter who isn’t angry, who acts happy to see me. I just don’t know Pansy. Did I tell you we’ve even taken to only renting one room and then taking turns on the couch to save us the expense? Not that he needs to, but it was his suggestion, and I certainly couldn’t turn down the blessing of saving half the residential expenses of the trip. I wonder what he’s playing at.
But it seemed like something he said struck a chord with Malfoy because the other man's face softens radically and he almost smiles. "Alright, Potter." Then he looks all over the shop and grumbles, "I swear if it was literally anyone other than you..."
When they finally got to the greenhouses, Neville was busy repotting some Venomous Tentaculas. As they sat down to help Neville, Harry prepared himself to start his rant all over again.
Ron struggles a bit to keep his profile low and unnoticeable as he follows the excitable creature in a mad flight hither and thither. Just as he starts getting the hang of it, the owl picks a direction and swoops down in the direction of the post pickup. Ron sends up red sparks.
Halfway between him and the fireplace, in his direct line of sight, lies a box. A box with his name on it. Almost as if the universe (or Harry) purposely put it there for Draco to find. Almost like a...gift! A surprise gift! Draco squeals.
"Well, I forgot to put the box away when he came over for dinner, and then he saw his name on it and asked me what I got him for a gift." His voice gets more and more frantic as he progresses through his rant. "Then I panicked and I told him they were a muggle thing for someone's partner and then he was like, like an intimate partner and I said yeah, like you were courting someone and then he assumed it was a declaration of my undying love for him and I was too weak to explain the truth so we're dating now but it's based on a lie and oh Merlin he told me to call him by his first name but then we were boyfriends already and OH MY GOSH Malfoy's going to KILL me!" By now Ron's alternating between crying and shaking, and Hermione too is biting her lips as if she's trying hard not to react. Harry's neck gets uncomfortably warm, and he sinks lower in his seat to hide his face behind his knees. "What am I going to do?" he moans pitifully. "I can't dig myself out of
The first time Potter called you a friend, he'd been acting weird for a month. He would nod at you in the hallways, pick up your things when they fell, smile at you when you were alone. For anyone else these actions would have been common courtesy, but for Potter and you, they were definitely
"Sorry, sorry," Ron chokes out in between full body shakes. Hermione purses her lips but then turns to Harry.
The only way I have now, to say I love you. Perhaps on some level, a last-ditch attempt to make you return to me—Silly. I know. You always said you feel like you can add nothing to this world after Voldemort, but don’t you see? Me—I’m better because of you. My success is all at your feet. This license, it’s your achievement.
"If you drop me, YOU'RE the one responsible for telling Molly who put her grandbaby in danger!" his wife yells. Ron panics harder and accidentally turns them upside down.
Together, they silently creep downstairs to the big Christmas tree in the sitting room. The red and green lights shine prettily in the dark as Harry drops the bag on the ground with a thunk. “No, wait!” Draco says. “Pull that back up! I need to get a photo of you with the bag.” Harry obliges and twists this way and that way as Draco directs him while clicking away on his camera. “Now hold it in front of you. And stand like this...yes, just like that. Don’t move!” Harry groans but does as his husband asks. “Now bend over.” Harry drops the bag and straightens up.
"Draco," Harry says back. "Draco." You think you would end the entire universe for Harry, if only it meant he would say your name again. "Draco."
"I… the gifts, Draco, they weren't meant..." Harry tries. "Crap, this is coming out all wrong, Draco, it's not, we're still..." But Draco's stopped listening.
And under the sky full of stars, both Harry and Draco fell asleep to each others hearts and breaths (and to Fluffy who managed to climb over the car to lodge herself between them sometime during the night).
“You know when I was young, sometimes I would dream of running away and becoming a farmhand.” Potter murmured, pulling at the grass near the base of the tree he was leaning against. “Guessed even a barn would be a better place to grow up than a bloody cupboard. Thought I could find someone to take me in, so I’d have a family too.”
. "We're magic!" Hermione yells. "Stun it!" She slows down and clings to the railing as she tries to catch her breath. "STUN IT RON!" A red flash streaks past the owl and bounces off the walls of the neighbouring shop. Another one bounces off a boiler, before a third one hits its mark, and the drops like a stone. For a second they both just stare at the place the owl was. Then Ron hoots and rushes back over to his wife. "We did it, Mione! Mione! We saved Harry!"
On the way back from the top of the peak– My first time zip lining. Can’t believe Potter managed to convince me to try that death trap. Muggle sports are terrifying as fuck, but also superbly fulfilling. I suppose they do have to make up for the lack of Quidditch somehow. The scenery on the way down was incredible.
Potter looked up at the sky. “Yeah something like that. I just. I wanted. Y’know. Just a family. And a place to sleep that weren’t the streets or my cupboard.”
Most times you feel like an inferi, dead and cold and will-less. And the times you don't, you feel like you're burning in muggle hell—panic attacks ripping through you every hour, flashbacks waiting for you around every corner.
“I already knew that guys. You all are terrible at keeping secrets. Neville told me the day you told me you coerced me into saying yes to this madness.”
. Potter usually only appears half an hour after his lunch break starts, and never in anything other than his red training auror robes over his tatty jeans. And for the last few days since Draco had flirted with him, Potter hadn't shown at all. Draco had thought maybe he'd been too forward and scared Potter off, or maybe he hadn't been enough and Potter had lost interest, or maybe Harry was straight after all and it was Potter's old stalkerish tendencies flaring when he stared at Draco through
"No, he hates me. Even if he didn't, he's REALLY going to hate me now," Harry blubbers. "He's going to think I'm weird for sending him sex toys with no context!" Ron draws his best friend closer, but he has no idea what to say.
"We're not! It was an accident!" cries Harry, unable to calm down. "I don't even remember ordering this kit, Hermione!"
has it all. But this is a love story not an advertising piece, so none of this really matters (except the staff—please leave them love and tips).
He shakes his head. A strange lump rises in his throat. “I… I don’t know…” he whispers. “I…” Parkinson shakes her head again, but before she says anything, the kitchen door opens, and in comes Draco, beaming and half-carrying, half-dropping at least five tall bottles of wine. Zabini follows with a tray of an assortment of fritters, crisps and bruschetta floating beside them.
“Yeah,” he says gruffly. Parkinson nods at him. And then Harry understands. She meant for him to overhear their conversation. Parkinson isn’t trying to tell Draco; she’s trying to guilt Harry into telling Draco himself. It’s working.
birds), Harry was battling his affections for Draco. His job had been to keep a watch on Draco while they nabbed the owl, and he was doing well. Very well, in fact, Harry thought to himself as he stood outside the front door of
I’m at breakfast right now, waiting for Malfoy to show up right now, if he ever decides to show up. He’s probably too busy doing yoga. Oh by the way MALFOY DOES YOGA! I didn’t know that! I wonder where he picked it up from. I walked in on him doing yoga and I swear. He wasn’t even wearing a bloody undershirt.
By midday, they had reached the banks of a large stream of water. Harry dropped their conversation, and ran towards the stream.
You will remember nothing else from this night, except for the betrayal in Potter's face when he looks at you. It tickles you a little how he expected you to be the good guy after spending a year torturing you for being bad.
. But because he's a Good boyfriend (and because there is the pesky problem of Harry not wanting to tell Draco about the sex toys), he doesn't say that. He does move their kissing to the bedroom, though, and if he has motives other than sex, well, Draco doesn't know that either.
Ron sputters and flails at being caught red-handed. "No? No. I was just. You know. Getting myself some coffee..." He trails off under Harry's raised eyebrow. And then he rubs the back of his neck and admits, "... at
gleams in the streaming sunlight. For what the structure and walls lack in color, the flowers more than make up for it. There are vines trailing up the sides of the doors and the two windows on the second floor reflect the blue sky perfectly. Butterflies dance over the display, bees hum around the decorations, and an owl hops along the ledge with a package tied on its foot.
but I can’t see the road anymore through my tears, can’t hear anything anymore over my heaving sobs, except in the rearview, a flash of green and red, the pile of Christmas presents we’d picked out; I reach out to the gear shift and its warm, from your hands, pushing it together; breathe in and your laughter echoing in the air, Teddy’s squeals in the backseat,
The playground, and I see you swinging Teddy in your arms; the pub tucked away on the street over, and you’re there drunk and laughing with your Gryffindors, winking at me thinking you’re slick except you’re really not, and I’ll just reach out and kiss you silly and- the parking lot where you introduced me to parallel parking, and the orange cones are up, a blue Mustang practicing, and you pop your head out from behind it, shifting the orange cones, showing me a thumbs up; and we’re on the street past that, examining a bit of graffiti and your tongue is sticking out as you add a little DM+HP to it; a motorbike is pulling up beside me, and you’re on it, pulling off your helmet, putting it on me, telling me to hold on as you pull into the air, and the ice cream parlour, the entrance to Diagon, the telephone to the Ministry you’d kiss me good day before work everyday; the restaurant where I was going to propose to you, and and and-
Harry thwaps him on the arm. "Shuddup," he grumbles. "It's already been longer than three days, so it's not like I can change the order now, can I?"
Well anyways. When we finally got out of the customs place, we decided to go eat lunch. Malfoy wanted to go to a posh restaurant, the spoilt pureblood that he is. But then by the time, we reached the restaurant it was closed, so we had to go find a place to stay. Apparently, he’d expected me to have made the reservations beforehand, but I didn’t know what to do, so I’d decided to wing it once we got here. So we got a dingy inn in the wizarding part of Hyderabad like at 10 at night.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he says sheepishly. "But I would bet my left bollock that the ferret thinks it's a date. On such a short notice too! Why the ferret probably likes Harry back too."
Finally, they let you go back to Hogwarts. You've lost all your standing in the Slytherin common room, and without your wand, there is no protection for you anymore. You use all the warding and privacy tricks you know, and when that doesn't work you move your stuff up into the abandoned room you and Potter used to sleep together in. By the second week, your back hurts all the time from sleeping on a lumpy conjured mattress, and your hair is a mass of painful knots. Your stomach hurts from infrequent meals, and more than once groups of children whose parents Father fucked over after the first war have left you bruised and broken in the middle of the dungeons. Most evenings you manage to drag yourself over to the seventh floor in time to eavesdrop on the resistance tuning into Potterwatch from outside the room they're camped in. You don't know how long you can keep this up.
Harry admired the view of Draco shirtless, his golden hair gleaming in the sun, and his cheeks flushed bright red from Merlin knew what. They played about for a bit in the water, pulling each other down, and splashing water about. Suddenly Draco gasped, and shielded his eyes from the sun.
"Not a date, he says. Why, Hermione, you should've seen the way Malfoy's face lit up when Harry asked him out!"
Ron panicked and pointed at his empty wrist. “Oh no will you look at the time? We really should be leaving! Wouldn’t want to miss an international portkey will we?” Before Harry could argue anymore, Ron hurried out of Grimmauld Palace with Harry’s disillusioned bags.
Ron peers around and shrugs. "Dunno. Never been here before." Then he flops down right beside his wife. "I'm hungry." Hermione hums.
, you think as you send that forward. Too many people know about it now. No one will be able to tell who, if anyone, leaked the information.
Draco thinks. Inside, the curry smells even better. Draco follows his nose down the hall out to the living room and into the kitchen. He stops. There's Potter. Potter in a frilly apron standing over something on the stove. Potter's humming along to something under his breath and wriggling his arse to the song and he looks absolutely delectable. Potter didn't even have to cook. If he served himself up on a platter, Draco was sure he wouldn't mind.
As they both got up, the sounds of children running about floated over to them. A quick glance showed that two small girls were climbing a large tree near them. Draco smiled fondly as he remembered the times when he used to climb the Malfoy apple trees during his childhood. The nostalgia soon turned into alarm however as he saw that one of the girls was also attempting to drag a toddler up the tree with her.
(Now you wonder at your naivety. Friends are for proper people—people who aren't death eaters or selfish or unlovable or you.)
You hum. "For a while I knowed." Knowed? Knew? You're too woozy to think straight now. Your vision blurs and your eyes roll up. "Draco?" Granger's voice sounds panicked. Your hands give and you topple over to your left. The floor feels nice and cold on your cheek. Granger's voice goes in and out. The last thing you remember is her hands probing the back of your skull.
But you're free. (Not that you deserve to be.) And everyone thinks you're a hero. And you've proclaimed your love for Harry Potter publicly. As a kid, you would've wanted nothing more perhaps. As an adult, you hate everything around you.
Draco huffed out a chuckle before Harry tackled him in another kiss. They didn’t get much past the snogging, but Harry was okay with that. Really. After all, they had the rest of time to do whatever they wanted. Right now, he just wanted to kiss Draco some more.
Stopping in front of the Head Elephant, Harry bowed and stood very still. Maybe it would be like Buckbeak and bow back—who knew? The Elephant rumbled and waved his trunk around Harry testing his scent. After a few moments it ambled over to Draco standing behind Potter, and swiped its trunk at him. Unbalanced, Draco went toppling into the water, and Harry stifled a laugh. Apparently satisfied the Elephant moved on. Draco came up with round eyes and red cheeks.
“They won’t be anymore,” Draco says, sure as always that Harry will turn up enough evidence to convince the court. Harry looks up to meet soft grey eyes brimming with a sleepy stolid kind of mettle that has made him fall in love over and over again, and he cannot look away again in the face of the shining beacon of unconditional support in front of him. Draco’s hand moves from Harry’s jaw down to Harry’s waist. Harry follows the silent offer to slip into the duvet right next to him. In a fluid practiced move, his shoulder tucks into Draco’s armpit, his head under Draco’s chin, his hand over Draco’s beating heart, slotting into place perfectly.
boy to boost one's ego. He carefully picks up one of the more beautiful flower chains and hands it over to Potter.
“What if she wanders off? What if some tiger shows up and eats her up. She’ll be gone in a flash, she’s not even a whole bite!”
So I decided I’m going to keep track of this trip (My first trip abroad!). I wouldn’t have but Malfoy dropped this journal in my lap, muttering about writing memories down lets people remember more, while we were out at the market earlier this week. Dunno how he figured out I was thinking of starting a journal—come to think of it, I may have said something about wanting to remember my first time abroad on our picnic yesterday. He would deny it if I mention it, but it was awfully nice of him.
After a moment of silence she sighs. "You didn't deserve what Harry was doing." Her voice is softer than you've ever heard it be. "No one deserves that."
Harry buries his face in one hand, the perfect picture of a remorseful boyfriend. You want to forgive him. You want to gather his frostbitten hands in your own trembling ones. You want to kiss each frosty finger, to reassure him, to hold him close and to never let go.
Harry had in fact talked to Malfoy after the trials. Their had talked at Luna’s party two months ago to be precise. Two months and three days ago. Two months, three days and three hours ago.
"Er okay," says Potter. "Let's go to this pizza place I found a while ago with Ron, They have the best stuff ever."
"Eighth year doesn’t count," Draco mumbles, simultaneously wishing Harry would keep pretending those nights in the common room didn’t happen and wishing Harry would bring them up again.
. Then you feel bad, and you pray for your parents and Granger and Pansy too. You yourself don't matter quite as much as the rest of them do.
"Of course it is, Harry," waves Hermione in a what-can-you-do-about-it gesture. "But the package might also be delivered any day now. Do you want to take the risk?"
"Shut up, Hermione!" Potter roars back, sounding well and truly unhinged. "He's the reason Ron almost died today, and you're still defending him?"
Their paddy farms were so peaceful. After we agreed to come to the marriage, one of their older daughters and her husband decided that they were going to take us around Bhubaneshwar. It was so much fun!
As Draco got more Puchka from the food tables, he watched Harry chase Sonia around the DJ floor. Neither of them knew how to dance, but they were enjoying themselves fully. Harry and Draco both had turned back and kept driving until they found civilization. From there they had decided to take a portkey to Kolkata to make it in time for the wedding. Draco and Harry were heading back to France tomorrow. He would miss having alone time with Harry, but he supposed he had the rest of his life to get Harry alone. He couldn’t still believe that he was romantically involved with the fucking saviour. He might not deserve him, but he sure wasn’t going to let him go. Harry made him happy. As he finished the spicy filling, he headed off towards Harry and Sonia. Maybe Harry would agree to trying one of the chili dumplings.
It was a pleasure to hear from Mother and you in your last letter. I should probably have warned you in advance, but I am bringing Harry home with me. Be on your best behaviour. Don’t mess this up for me. And please tell Mother. We will be there by nightfall.
Chuckling, Potter pushed off the banister. “C’mon Malfoy. We should get on the road before seven.” Praying fervently for his reputation, Draco followed Potter indoors to the smell of burnt toast and sandalwood.
Later, as everything is winding down after lunch, Harry excuses himself to the loo. When he returns, only Parkinson and Draco are in the living room. He hears his name and pauses right outside the entrance.
“Have you talked to him since the trials at all? Malfoy I mean. He has changed you know. He’s much less of a git now. Maybe use the opportunity to set the record straight between you two. I think you might like to hang out with him in a place with less memories.”
“You aren’t listening to me anymore are you Harry?” A distinct silence and muffled hand banging and clinking of bottles answered her with a resounding denial.
, his heart jumped. Finally! It was happening! Potter was going to come over, talk to Draco, and fall madly in love if he wasn't already! If Draco had his way, maybe they'd even have a date by the end of the night! Resisting the urge to fix his hair or press down his robes, Draco focused very hard on shifting the bouquet back and forth on the table just so.
At the start of hols, Theo tells you in confidence that Pansy will fuck him soon. He's sure of it. Almost as sure as he is that Dolores Umbridge is holding mudbloods captive down in Newport. You don't think Pansy will be fucking anyone any time soon—she's been too busy giving you the worried look. The Order finds 21 muggleborns shoved in a cage in Umbridge's mother's house. In Newport.
Harry gave him a sly smile. “So does that mean you and Parkinson never had sex in the Forbidden Forest?”
When Draco nodded mutely, Potter turned around, just so that the light set fire to the tips of his hair.
Draco feels a bit put out. "What?" he snaps. "You don't think Potter could get me gifts?" Sticking his nose in the air, he sniffs loudly for emphasis. "Well, newsflash Pans, Harry gave me these...these glass sculptures and miniature baubles and these fluffy feathery things to signify his great undying muggle love for me."
“Malfoy?” Through the corner of his eye Draco watched Potter lean on the railing. Draco felt as if his stomach was being pulled up by hooks. If he moved his elbow just a little to the right, their elbows would occupy the same space. The hairs along his right arm stood up, as if Potter exuded a magnetic field that drew them towards him.
Potter flushes prettily but pushes Draco away gently. Draco lets him. (Draco would let Potter do a lot of things, but that's besides the point here.) "Curry's my favourite too," Potter says and turns around to turn the flames off. "I'm just done. Here, let me carry everything out to the dinner table." The auror flicks his hand, and Draco watches in awe as the shelves open, and crockery rolls out and flies out the door clinking merrily along the way. The pot of curry and a pot of rice follows them, and a small line of spoons brings up the rear. Wandless
). But as soon as the flavour hits, all of that goes flying out of the window and the country and the entire universe. The taste, oh sweet, sweet Salazar,
"RON!" she calls and waves her arms wildly as soon as she is halfway out. "GET THE PYGMY! BACK UP! PLAN B! RON! PLAN B!"
Granger frowns when you tell her about your idea of turning spy. The next day, she gives you a coin to communicate with her.
, he'd forgotten what a heady rush it is to be able to see that beauty spot on the edge of Potter's lip.
This isn’t my achievement. For me, it's an apology. Atonement—even though you said you didn’t want that from me. (
Thursday is bright and sunny: perfect weather for their plans. Ironically, they might have succeeded if it was rainy—there would have been much fewer birds around. However, as that would ruin the point of this tale, we are quite lucky it wasn't so. Quite lucky indeed.
As we would expect, the moment that Mal-Draco's out of the door, Harry dives for the floo. Ron answers within seconds (almost as if he were waiting for it, hmmm).
Over the summer, you and Granger manage to work out a way to exchange notes inconspicuously. The Ministry falls. Granger tells you she's going camping with Harry instead of to Hogwarts, so you helpfully tell her all of the Snatchers locations on the island. She doesn't tell you where they are going, but she doesn't need to. You're smart enough to figure it out if you need to.
Harry pads in, spatula in hand, and frowns. "About what, Ron?" His friend holds up a half opened letter with a shit-eating grin on his face. "Oi! Stop going through my mail!" He lunges for Ron.
The next instant, they're both on their feet. "The net Hermione!" shouts Ron, referring to their Plan B equipment, and starts running towards the owl. Hermione waddles as fast as she can after her husband. She reaches for her bag, eyes widening a moment later when she remembers dropping it. The pygmy owl glides past them back towards the other edge. "QUICK! IT'S ESCAPING, HERMIONE!"
, and try to stop it from being shipped. If that doesn't work, step two, we stalk the local owlpost offices and try to intercept Malfoy's mail from there. Simultaneously, we run step three, where Harry will make friends with Malfoy, so that in the worst-case scenario, if Malfoy gets the package, we can play it off as a prank." She claps her hands together. "What do you think?
Harry flushes, and unwillingly his eyes stray upwards. His lips and throat suddenly feel incredibly dry, and he can feel sweat gathering in the dip of his spine.
You feel as if you should care, as if you should feel betrayed, as if you need to want revenge. But all you can feel is numbness—a numbness that muffles, stings, freezes your every cell. A numbness that you know from a lifetime of betrayals and loneliness. A numbness that says,
Scorpius’ sobs trail off into hiccups and he sticks his fingers in his mouth. There is a moment of almost silence. Then with wide eyes and a trembling voice, Scorpius whispers around his fingers, “Santa isn’t real?”
It happened on a Saturday afternoon, exactly four weeks and four days after the Wednesday that started it all. The sun is soft, the winds cool, the trees almost bare. It's one of the last weekends before autumn dawns and winter creeps in. Draco had been insisting on calling his friends over to officially introduce Harry as his boyfriend, and this was the afternoon which they’d settled on.
Two hours later you're on your knees, trying to scrape out every bit of ash and hold it close to your heart.
They drag another muggle girl into your dungeons. You hear her screams for weeks on end, even after you were sure she'd died.
“Help? What seems to be the problem?” Ron thumped down the stairs. His best friend had recently taken to imitating Professor Queenly or something from a frog’s factory Rosie liked to watch on the TV. But then he saw the three women surrounding his best friend. And he slowly backed away. “I think you should listen to what the smart people are saying Harry,” Ron said nervously.
Draco makes a face, remembering the last time they forgot to put gifts from Santa Claus under the tree. “No, we do not,” he agrees, grabbing the camera from the shelf. Harry takes a deep breath and heaves up a big shiny bag that Draco insisted he carry for pictures.
You lock every single page of his writing in your study. When Granger inquires about Potter's letters, you don't tell her anything.
Draco turns around and bounces happily when he sees Harry gaping at the vase. "Oh oh oh! Do you like it? I set it all up myself!" He drags Harry closer to the table and chatters away about all the creative ways he's used Harry's gifts. "... and I know I didn't put in those rubber rings, but really Harry, even
If he squinted, Draco swore he could see the sea along the horizon, even though the caretaker had said they wouldn’t be able to see it until they crossed another thirty kilometers up the winding roads.
“They were starving her,” he says quietly, his gaze unfocusing as he pictures the details from the file again. Even though between Draco and Molly it’s been over a decade since he’s gone to bed hungry with no idea of when his next meal will be, his tummy gives a squeeze in memory of that horrid feeling. Draco stills, and his back rises in a deep breath once, twice. Then he turns over on his side. Draco’s hand trails down Harry’s temple and tucks in wayward curls behind his ears.
“Hey!” protests Draco in the background, but Harry slaps his hand over Draco’s mouth. Teddy is stopping Scorpius’ tantrum; his husband can keep his fucking mouth shut. Harry needs some goddamn peace.
“I don’t know why I said yes” Harry whined to Luna on their weekly trip to Neville’s greenhouses at Hogwarts, and stuck another spoonful of his Butterbeer ice-cream in his mouth.
Harry shakes his head and whines, "But he's going to be so heartbroken, Hermione, he is. Those stupid things mean the world to him, how am I going to tell Draco that they weren't for
The cold evening wind nips at Draco's cheekbones, and embarrassingly, his eyes water slightly. Muffled sounds of children playing blend in with the rising evening sounds of the trees' denizens overhead. He runs his eyes over the cracked pavement and tries hard to keep breathing evenly (a shudder or two creep in anyways). Potter shuffles behind him, probably preparing to leave. Probably preparing to confirm that it was all just a misunderstanding. Probably apologetic but finally free of Draco's expectations.
They bundle up (or rather bundle each other up) and head out. The sun is close to setting, and all the critters and nightlife are stirring. A comfortable silence settles between them. Harry keeps stealing glances at his boyfriend as they walk. The golden sunlight streaming in from behind them makes Draco look like an angel complete with a halo and shining skin. He catches Draco peeking back at him, and they both smile into their scarves. Then a hand takes Harry’s and squeezes. Harry looks at Draco who is already looking at him. Harry squeezes back.
“Draco!” Pansy gasps, mockingly scandalized. “Surely we can’t drink that much wine! For lunch that too!”
Draco’s right; Harry will always figure out a way to fix things. But that’s a job for future Harry. And as far as the past is concerned… it’s in the past. Harry and Draco are here, in the present, in each other's arms, within the home they’ve built for themselves. Harry’s arms tighten around his dragon, and he slowly drifts into dreamland. They are home now. That’s all that matters.
Do you understand me? If she hadn't sent Kreacher over to fool us that night, he'd still be alive today."
"Well," drawls Draco. "Considering you were the one who asked me to dinner, take me to whatever your heart delights in, Potter."
Tires on asphalt and drumming rain come crashing in; a screeching honk from in front of me. The steering wheel spins in my hands, and everything is spinning out of control, everything is shattering, shards of memories, of you all around me, and I can’t feel, can’t think. My foot slams down, and for a second I think I hit the accelerator, the seat belt cuts into my throat, and I remember I’m on a bridge,
Parkinson looks at Harry surreptitiously. Then she says, “But still. I’ve never seen you get this way about a gift before.”
"I...Potter," Draco breathes and looks up. Why is Potter looking like he's going to be walked to the gallows? This is one of the
Draco turns Harry around and catches Harry’s hands against his chest. “I always do, darling,” he whispers, bringing their hands up to kiss Harry’s palms. “You know I do.” Harry feels his cheeks warm slightly and buries his face in his husband’s shoulder. Draco whispering in that voice, complimenting him… it never gets old. “Here let me,” his husband chuckles, and pulls Harry’s face away gently to spell his beard white. “There you go; all done.” He cards through it and Harry leans into Draco’s touch, his eyes fluttering closed.
, Granger writes. The final battle will be soon. They're almost done destroying the Dark Lord's fail-safes. You don't write back to her. You will be ready when it happens. She knows you will. She'll keep Harry safe for you.
The war is over. Harry did it. He killed the Dark Lord. You feel nothing but a tired sort of numbness. Your family huddles in the far corner, part of neither the defeat nor the revels. Your mother tells you, the way Harry survived the killing curse again. She holds you tight, and despite Father's disproving gaze, she whispers to you the way she lied to keep Harry alive. Because she loved you.
"I am good too," Potter replies awkwardly. A silence follows. It seems like Draco is going to have to do all the work here. Okay, that's okay too. He's suddenly terribly thirsty. "So tell me how is auror training treating you?" he asks Potter, putting away his record book.
"A date! Oh, Harry, you move quickly don't you!" Hermione exclaims. Ron nods vigorously, his eyes proud.
The loved leather seats, the half-naked stick, the fading dash--it’s all the same, and for a moment, you’re almost sitting there in the passenger seat again, with that challenging smirk and those enticing curls. I run a finger over the steering wheel, and it comes away with a layer of dust, bringing the musty smell of a space abandoned. If she were still yours…
It was one of those few Monday nights when she had no grading left to do, and she was occupying the left hand corner of the Big Room which tripled as their dinning room, lounge and kitchen. Harry agreed distractedly as he tucked the turmeric into the perfect spot. As he fished for the paprika, he stole a peek at her. With her elbows on the stacks of books littering the table, grey rimmed spectacles low on her nose and a can of biscuits balanced on the tartan couch that Harry bought for McGonagall, Hermione looked every bit of the stern professor she was.
Then Potter smiled at him. (Potter! Smiled! At Him!). “I do have to say you’re quite a cute drunkard. You talk so much.” Wait, what? Buggering hell. What secrets had he spilled to Potter in his drunken stupor? How much did Potter know about him that Draco didn’t know that Potter knew? He made a strangled gurgling noise and promptly blushed brighter in embarrassment.
He beams at Potter, who for some reason still looks like he's going to throw up. "A proposition! Potter! How Slytherin of you! How well planned. I am so proud!" Potter opens his mouth again, probably to tell him to look at the actual gift. "Oh shush! I'm getting to it, Potter. Give a man some time, you know." With a loud click under his fingers, the chest opens to reveal... well. Draco has
“It isn’t. Something else. Harry means it,” Draco insists. “He’s been wonderful this past month.” Parkinson just inclines her head and then makes a show of noticing Harry standing at the entrance.
, sitting with Harry as he drinks his coffee. As is often the case with Luna Lovegood, neither Harry nor the narrator is quite sure why, how and whence Luna has appeared from. But as he loves Luna he doesn't question her presence (neither do we). Anyhow, it's her presence that is of utmost importance here, not her unsurpassed knack for knowing when and where she is needed.
“If we’re doing this whole exploring the forest thing together, I would rather have you call me Draco than Malfoy.” Malfoy explained quietly and smiled lightly at Harry.
. He can't—he has to go. The door crashes into the wall as he shoves past it. "Draco!" Potter calls after him. Draco practically flies back down the staircase. He can feel the broken shards of his heart pouring out of every bit of him, trailing on the ground, getting crushed under Potter's feet once again. "Draco wait!" Potter hollers behind him. "Draco!" Blindly, Draco crosses the street, and almost crashes into the wall in front of the park. From this angle, he can almost see the tree under which they'd had their first picnic. His slight pause lets Potter finally catch up to him and he feels his elbow being caught in long fingers and tugged into a solid chest.
"I'm going to throw up," Hermione moans as the world spins. "I'm going to throw up our baby, Ron. Oh god, Ron, what if I go into labour early from all this stress!" Then she teeters to the left, and Ron swoops to the right to balance them, bringing them to a skidding stop five inches off a cemented roof where they both tumble off the broom. For a minute they just sit dazed.
Then Molly smushed his head to her neck again, blubbering about how if he loves them he’ll go on this vacation. He won’t survive past the next two minutes. No he was strong, he was capable, he was…. And Ginny behind him pinched his arm. Hard. Harry shrieked. Time to call in backup. “RON! HELP!”
You stay out of Potter's sight for the rest of the year. It proves to be harder than you thought. Even in a full crowd, he has the knack for knowing exactly where you are (you're the same way). Slowly, the greens and blues and reds bury themselves deeper into your wardrobe, until everywhere you look, everything is black. Pansy gives you worried looks, but she never talks to you.
Scorpius hesitates and then grabs Teddy's hand, letting himself be led upstairs to Teddy’s room. Distantly, Harry hears the faint crackling of candy wrappers. He looks forlornly at the bag and his discarded suit and sits down heavily next to his husband under the Christmas tree.
"No, Ron. No hitting Malfoy," Harry says firmly. Ron pouts. Harry takes a long swig of alcohol, and then blurts, "We're dating." Hermione exclaims joyously and Ron thumps Harry on the back. But when Harry just mopes silently, they both look at each other and then at their best friend again.
It finally happens two weeks later. Your confrontation with Potter. Later you find out it wasn't anything you did that tips Potter over, but it happens nonetheless, and it changes your life forever.
Draco spluttered. “Some of us aren’t heathens Potter! We don’t take off our shirts in the middle of a fucking forest.”
I turn on the blinkers and back out of the driveway, drowning out the rest of her sentence. Reverse, turn, drive. Stop sign, count till three.
Perhaps, you may think, this is it. This tale of how Harry and Draco got into a relationship. Perhaps this is how it ends: in Draco's apartment, under decorative sex toys, next to two boys learning to navigate each other. Perhaps this is where it starts, the story of the rest of their lives—of how Harry will always return from lunch with flowers tucked into his hair, of how Draco will start becoming a fixture in the future Head Auror's office, of how they will end up adopting three children and two cats, of how they will grow old together and become that sweet old couple on the block who everyone envies.
"He doesn't have to know does he?" Ron points out, his mouth moving over Harry's hair. "As long as nobody
Teddy nods wisely and gives both Harry and Draco a side-eye. “Oh yes, he has the tendency to do that,” he says, and Harry feels like an absolute heel.
For the first time ever, I turn onto the main street without you in the passenger seat. Quaint shops pass me on either side, some I don’t recognize. I stop at the red light and glance towards the coffee place we went to for our first date. In the past year and a half, it seems nothing has changed— the decorations, the busy lines, the cute waiter you tried to make me jealous with. And you leaning against the entrance, waiting for me to catch up— I turn back sharply to look again, but you’re not there anymore. The dormant heartache I’ve carried around ever since you left takes a breath and expands like a living entity, fluttering all over in my body. I grit my teeth and look away.
She kneels and picks up your hand, without flinching though you both know the filth and germs thriving on your skin. With a firm voice and firmer eyes, she says, "I will get you out of here Draco."
Parkinson must have read his face because she purses her lips and says harshly, “No, I won’t tell Draco.” Harry opens his mouth in relief. “Not for your sake. For his and for mine.” She shakes her head. “Morgana knows why he likes you, but he does. I don’t want to be the one who tells him his boyfriend is a fucking liar.”
—I’m not an utter berk. Then we came back to the inn and we played cards. We went to these waterfalls the day after. They were so pretty. I  persuaded the cook at our inn to make us some nice sandwiches (which again had spices in them. Seriously? I am still pissed. Malfoy said it is good for my countenance. What the hell even is a countenance?). We had a good picnic in a grassy place nearby, and then I had a good long sleep in the sun (there’s sun here!). Malfoy refused to lay down like “common riffraff”. He is so pretentious (Ha! See I can use big words too Malfoy you wanker).
Harry waved it off. “You were just a child Draco. You didn’t deserve a life sentence in Azkaban for actions you took when you were young and under duress. We all did stuff we weren’t proud of.”
Harry had never had a change of moods quicker. He drove their car a bit further into the forest off the road, and they both got down from the car. As Harry charmed their car to look like a big rock and attached a tracking charm to it, Malfoy made quick work of shrinking their luggage and tucked it away into the pocket Fluffy wasn’t in. Content with their set up, they both then decided to walk about a little.
's windows. But seeing Potter here, Draco thinks, maybe Potter's just really shy and anxious. His heart threatens to beat right out his chest.
Malfoy's sharp gaze lands on him and the bird. "Were you fighting with my post owl?" he asks, sounding a little dazed. Harry's afraid that if he opens his mouth, he'll burst into tears. Malfoy shakes his head. "No, wait. Don't answer that." He raises his hands. There's a pause, and then Malfoy turns around as if he's had some revelation he can't bear. "You know," he says in a voice so hollow it makes Harry want to cry even more, "Auror Potter. You didn't have to pretend to befriend me to ransack my place. You know they wouldn't hear my complaints anyway." He raises a single hand to his face. Harry wants to scream. He wants to deny everything, to tell Malfoy the truth, to tell him how
"Well it's dated to Thursday," observes Hermione. "Whoever it was, ordered it Wednesday evening or sometime Thursday morning."
Today, though, it isn't the loneliness that presses down on him. Or, at least, not only the loneliness. When he closes his eyes tonight, all he can see are grey eyes, blonde hair tips and a wicked snarky mouth. Date flowers. Gods. What a fool! He cracks open a bottle and chases his mortification down with burning alcohol. Such a fool! He's not surprised Malfoy was so eager to get rid of him Why did he get so stupid? All he had to do was ask how Malfoy was doing like a normal person! The ghost of long fine fingers presses down on his elbow, soft breathy laughter blows across his ears, and he takes another swig. Sweet, sweet Merlin. That arse clad in blue trousers. Malfoy was something else entirely. But date flowers? Really? He collapses on the couch, a half-empty firewhiskey bottle in hand and a strong desire to get sloshed in mind. It doesn't take him long.
Potter clears his throat and pauses, then clears his throat again. It's okay, Draco's patient. Potter can take however long he wants to ask Draco out. "Malfoy. How are you?"
You can't help the Gryffindors or the upper years. Whenever you go near them, suspicion and disgust follows you. You don't care very much. The other younger years are much better anyways. They learn how to pretend to be under the crucio when you pretend to cast it so well, that it takes the Carrows about a month and a half to figure it out. They chalk it up to you being too weak to cast a crucio and trying to cover it up. The Dark Lord holds you under the crucio for five minutes, but you don't mind. All that matters is that it wasn't your mother.
"Did you like it?" He grins wickedly. "My gift?" At your blank stare, he grins wider. "The poisoned mead you were going to give to Slughorn? I passed it onto the Weasel."
"Go ahead then," Malfoy gestures to his shop. "Find anything incriminating? Think I'm up to something, Auror Potter?" His eyes are sharp, his hands clenched, his lower lip still. Suddenly, something tells Harry this is it. If Malfoy's trust breaks in this second, that's it. Harry won't ever have another chance.
She takes a couple of gasping breaths and then leans over to look at the box closely. "He gave you those?" she asks in a wobbly voice.
Both Harry and Draco helplessly try to shush and distract Scorpius, but the little child only twists out of his Daddy’s grasp and screams louder. “DADDY DESTROYED SANTA CLAUS!!!!” Harry’s head starts to hurt.
It takes them about half an hour to put Draco's shop to rights again. Potter apologizes profusely again and again as they work, but Draco waves it all away. Yes, it hurts to see his precious shop trashed, but he has magic for a reason. Now, Draco is no fool. He sure hasn't forgiven Potter completely—of course not. There was something Potter was trying to hide; Potter is a
You watch your friend walk out of sight, before laying your head on the ground and weeping silently.
Potter mumbles something, and they apparate into a London alleyway. The pizza place turns out to be this little hole-in the wall kind of place that Draco would never go to alone: the air smells of oregano and cheese, the tables feel a bit too greasy, the menus aren't shiny enough. As he takes his first tentative bite under Potter's hopeful gaze, he's fully prepared to pretend to love it for Harry's sake while hating it inside (and then perhaps it would become a
Draco ignores him. "You don't have to stay or try to explain or… or anything. I understand." He pulls his jacket tighter. "I do."
. The kids run back into the field, and Harry pauses at the gate to watch them play. Once, even he was that tiny. Most the kids he fights for right now are that tiny. How could anyone look at these small faces, and want to hurt them? A drop of water falls on Harry’s face, and he rubs it off. Then he shakes his head, and continues walking.
The stone floor is cold under your hands as Potter's shirt slides over the moonlit expanse of his tan skin. His smile, soft, sweet, loving, fills your vision and your entire universe. He leans over to kiss you, deep and slow, before he leaves. His touch lingers on your right cheek. When you close your eyes, for a moment, it almost feels as if he really does love you. His voice, low and content and sleepy, echoes softly in your ears.
Then there is a flash of light, and something thuds in front of you. Thunder rumbles through the floor, and you open your eyes to see Granger wrestling Potter's wand out of his hand. Potter rolls her over, and gets up with his wand still pointed at you. "Harry no!" she cries, climbing up to her knees. "Don't do this. You aren't like this!"
Harry's eyes rove over toppled vases, crushed flowers, scratched shelves, and shattered glass. By the time his eyes meet Malfoy's gaze, he can barely breathe. His gut churns; there's a tremble running all over him. Suddenly, he becomes terribly aware of the now cold coffee drenching the front of his robes, and the back of his neck heats up. Harry wishes he could vanish into thin air. Malfoy's eyes go from his face to the owl in his hands back to his face. Then they go around the shop just like Harry's had.
—doesn't exist anymore. It stopped existing the day the Dark Lord crossed the Manor's threshold. Ever since, your fountains have been dry, your gardens dead. Nagini hunts your peacocks for sport and you haven't seen a butterfly since two summers. You can barely remember your parents' smiles. The elves may scrub as much as they want, but blood and torture stains every marble floor. You can't even walk to the kitchens without being harassed by werewolves, and Mother needs to lock every door and window before sleeping. Father is in Azkaban, and once he is out, he will never be safe. Whichever way the war ends, your Wiltshire is gone forever.
Harry wails. "He ALREADY hates me, oh my god. I was so stupid last time. He's definitely not going to want to be friends with me now!"
By the way Malfoy acquired a chick from the farmhouse, and we named it Fluffy (yes it’s after Fluffy from first year Ron). It’s brown and little and cute. And an attention hogging bastard. Literally since we’ve gotten it, Malfoy literally spends more time parading Fluffy around than he spends making his hair look perfect. They’re both so annoying!
Hermione dropped the topic, Merlin thank tiny blessings, but Harry had a feeling that this wasn’t the last time he will have to deal with this.
Wetness stains the corner of Harry’s eyes as his mind wanders back to an empty cupboard with broken crayons and scavenged toy soldiers. Once, he thinks, he had nothing, yet now the universe sleeps in his arms. He rests his forehead against Draco’s and closes his eyes, reveling in the way their breaths mingle.
“He’s a Gryffindor,” Draco says simply. “Plus he has Granger, doesn’t he? She knows enough for the both of them. He wouldn’t do something if he didn’t actually mean it.”
“DADDY!” he sobs. “DADDY!” Harry shushes him as Draco hangs back helplessly. “Daddy! I came down for water and then Papa was here with Santa Claus and then he kissed Santa Claus, but Santa Claus wasn’t YOU,” Scorpius chokes out before bursting into sobs. “I TRUSTED PAPA!”
For a moment the thought that perhaps Potter doesn't like him flits across his mind, but Draco quickly shakes it off. He'd rather have fun now and worry later than worry now
Potter owls you again. This time you send it back. On the back, in your elegant loopy handwriting, you write:
Suddenly, a startled exclamation cuts through the cafe, and Harry swivels around, wand in hand, to see a transparent Russell Terrier bounding down towards him. The back of his neck prickles. Ron's patronus stops, its mouth opens, and out pours his best friend's frantic voice "Mate. Harry. I'm so sorry, we thought we caught the ow—uh you-know-what, but apparently, we stunned the wrong pygmy, and the top-secret-cargo escaped. You probably already know this by now, but in case you didn't… well good luck mate. You'll need it. Probably."
Harry smiles and nods. “Wait, I’ll show you, look,” he says and waves his wand, changing his beard to white and back to black again. “See? I
You'd been so grateful, that you even forgot to question how Potter had failed this potion after months of acing Slughorn's class.
Harry's face went stonier than it already was. His voice, when he spoke, promised just as much death as his face. He almost looked like Father in an unholy rage. "You don't get to tell me who I am, Hermione," he drawled. "I can kill whoever I so please. Anyways, you don't
But you don't think you will ever stop loving Harry James Potter for the rest of your lives. And you're through with right and wrong, with good and bad. If choosing Harry still means endless suffering, well, it's not a choice you've hesitated to make before, is it?
He exhales a small laugh, and says, "Saviour, oh Saviour," delighting in the half scowl that crosses Potter's face at the moniker. Potter is
Everything is white in Madam Pomfrey's ward. The window beside your bed overlooks the lake, and you can hear a quidditch match going in full gear beside it. Funny how the world still moves on even when you've crashed and burned. Granger tells you that Potter broke your skull. That must be why you passed out.
The tip of Mahendragiri mountains – Potter’s first time eating cotton candy. Don’t mind Potter’s face. In addition to excelling at being ugly, Potter does not understand the meaning of appropriate photograph expressions. Also the corncobs up here are amazing and perfectly smoked.
“All better,” Draco murmurs into Harry’s hair, pressing a soft kiss into his unruly curls. “Because of you.” Harry shifts to hide his small smile in Draco’s neck as his husband reaches up to shut the light off. Their chests rise and fall in tandem, and Harry feels the the warm loose-limbedness that comes with complete security cover him like a blanket, melting him, melding him into Draco, until they are but one creature. Harry’s sooty eyelashes flutter around the edges of his vision, framing the moonlit shadows that creep slowly across the ceiling in a curtain of feathery black, and he can’t help but think of another night, another life, watching the moonlight shine through the bars in a house he couldn’t call home. Of Draco, too, in a dark manor, trying to sleep, wandless, scared and alone. Of another child tonight, perhaps doing the same thing. Draco shifts under him, and Harry shakes these thoughts away.
Potter put a hand on Draco’s shoulder and reassured her it was no problem, and then he asked after their parents. Draco let him do the talking for the both of them, for he still felt incredibly shaken up.
Harry doesn’t understand. Parkinson said she wouldn’t tell Draco. And then her eyes lift up and she holds his gaze meaningfully as if she’s telling him something.
And that may have been the end of it; if what happened that night hadn't happened. Harry was mortified and shy, and he very well would have hidden away for the rest of eternity. But, it did happen. And the narrator can gladly say that
. Draco takes pity on him and reaches up to nudge Potter's arm so that it's pointing towards the pretty Ivies in the corner.
Draco’s gaze is soft, and he hums quietly. “One more?” he implores. Harry gives him two more, and he feels Draco’s lips tug into a bigger smile under his own.
By the time they’re done eating, Draco’s eyes are already slipping shut, and Harry can see sleep creep up on his husband. Draco doesn’t even make his usual protests to Harry’s unwavering gaze trained on him. The colored lights from the TV cast soft shadows across Draco’s face, highlighting his aristocratic cheekbones and parted lips, setting the edges of his blond eyelashes aflame. Quietly, Harry pulls Draco closer so his head is resting in the crook of Harry’s neck. His husband doesn’t flinch—he’s properly asleep now. Harry runs a thumb under his dragon’s closed eyes, tracing the dark circles that hint at the grueling hours he spends saving people’s lives in the emergency ward. He gathers Draco even closer, cherishing the feel of the living breathing body against him, the incredible human warmth of his skin. He lays a soft sweet kiss on the corner of Draco’s slack lips.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “They just wanted to say goodbye you dummy. Honestly Harry.” Then her eyes softened. “We all love you so much Harry. Just remember that yeah?”
Unfortunately, Harry isn't a man of refined tastes, and all he can see is the dildo. And well the anal beads. And the pumpkin vibrators inside the magic orbs. And the bondage silks and rope.
Harry chews his own rice, and thinks of the manilla folder he left on his desk. “It was alright,” he says finally. “New case.” Draco gives him a side-eye. Harry looks down at his lap. “It’s child neglect.”
, and you scream. "Well guess what Potter! So did I! I knew I deserved every bit of shitty piece of life fate doled out to me! I knew I was worthless! You didn't have to cook up a plan to murder me to drive it home! I knew, Potter, I knew!" You scream and you scream, and when your voice breaks, you break into sobs, whispering “
Oh Merlin, you probably just went along with me as I manhandled you into a relationship." He pushes Harry away from him. "I'm so… I'm so sorry, I'm so," he gasps.
You could refuse to answer Granger's question. You have that much power as a occlumens over the effect of Veritaserum. Involuntarily, your gaze strays over to where you know Potter is across the room. He's already looking at you. You can't read his green eyes. He's shaking his head, like he could control what you do. Your mouth opens, and out pours the entire tale from sixth year—your relationship, the night Granger saved you, your willingness to part from your family for Potter. You pause. Potter is shaking his head harder now as if he can deny everything you say.
They bring in a pregnant halfblood girl, and instead of going to the dungeons, they take her up to where the Death Eaters are living. Father follows them in, avoiding your gaze, and Mother just grips your hand tighter. You spend that night on the bathroom tiles throwing up into cold porcelain.
Luna looks at him patiently and places her hand atop his. "You like Draco. You should talk to Draco. I think Draco would like that too."
