‘Not really.’
‘Well, I suppose so. Just for a little bit.’
‘Very,’ Draco replied, deadpan.
‘It’s brilliant,’ Harry said, the sincerity clear in his voice.
The time went by in a whirlwind, Harry overwhelmed both mentally and also with things to do. Although Ginny had gone back to the Burrow after Harry had told her his decision, she had come back again the next day so that they could plan. Harry had told her to stay in their house, offering to move to Grimmauld. They had both agreed that they wanted to keep the news to themselves for as long as possible, to give them time to process before the press and the public began to pry, and if Ginny rented or bought another house, they would lose that secrecy. Harry still owned Grimmauld Place—it had never felt right to sell it—and he could easily move there without anyone knowing.
Harry briefly considered refusing, or at least asking for another Healer to check what Malfoy was giving him, but then Malfoy sighed.
‘You were supposed to wait for me to do that,’ Harry burst in.
Harry wrenches his gaze away from Draco’s fingers long enough to glance up at his face, taking in the mischievous grin on his face as he watches Harry writhe under his touch. Harry opens his mouth to say something but then Draco’s hand tightens round his cock, squeezing the head just enough to send a bolt of pleasure racing up Harry’s spine, and he gasps instead, all words forgotten.
‘And you didn’t even have to pay for it,’ Draco teases, too full of happiness to find referencing their past upsetting.
‘Uh, yeah, I’m fine,’ Harry said, shaking his head in an attempt to dispel his, quite frankly, disturbing thoughts about Malfoy, regretting it immediately as his head began to ache.
‘I have to go,’ Potter says.
The bath is helping though. He’d made a beeline for the bathroom as soon as he got home, dropping his bag in the hall and stripping off his clothes as he went, desperate to sink his sore muscles into the soothing water. He’s never found anything else -- magic or otherwise -- that soothes a tired body in quite the same way.
‘Are you all right?’ Malfoy asked, looking down at where Harry was clutching his hip. His cheeks were still slightly pink, his voice low, but before Harry’s eyes he seemed to pull himself back together, calling on his Healer persona and retreating back into professional Malfoy.
Today, though, is different. The crash doesn’t seem to be arriving, his heart rate still just as high, the restless energy in his legs still present. He knows what it is, even if he’s been trying to avoid admitting it to himself. But when Draco comes and leans against the wall with him, close enough that their sleeves brush against each other, Harry can’t deny it. He’s been watching Draco. He’s been doing it all his life, really, but the watching has taken on a different tenor recently. He can’t seem to stop staring at Draco, whether they’re sat working in their office, Draco messing up his hair as he tries to puzzle through a case, or when they’re in the Auror gym, Draco’s tight clothes leaving little to the imagination and making it impossible for Harry to concentrate on his own exercises. And especially during raids, when Draco turns into a force of nature, eyes gleaming as he casts perfect spell after perfect spell, the way they work together making Harry wonder just how compatible they could be in other ways too.
‘See you on Friday, Harry,’ Malfoy said, and then he was gone, stepping out into the night.
Suddenly in desperate need of a break, Harry mumbled an excuse to Evangeline and escaped to the toilets. They were blessedly empty, and Harry washed his hands, splashing his face with the cool water as he tried to get Malfoy out of his head. He’d only had a couple of pints, but he must be drunker than he thought, to be standing in grotty pub toilets, his mind consumed with alternating images of Malfoy laughing and carefree, and Malfoy lost in the throes of passion, his hand on his dick and his mouth on Harry. If he was honest with himself, he had been having these thoughts regularly ever since the incident, but tonight, now that he’d seen Malfoy again properly, they were having even more of an effect than normal, and Harry couldn’t deal with that.
A knock on the door interrupted them before either of them could say anything else, and the mediwitch who had been there when Harry first woke up after his accident poked her head around the door.
But Draco comes into the bathroom anyway, propping himself on the edge of the bath near Harry’s head.
dedicated,’ Esther said with a chuckle. ‘He’s been putting in rather a lot of overtime since you turned up, what with your nighttime walks and long conversations that mean he has to stay late to get the rest of his work done.’
Even though he spent longer than usual getting ready, his anxiousness at seeing Harry again manifesting in a need to ensure that he looked his best, Draco still managed to arrive at Andromeda’s while Teddy and Harry were finishing off their breakfast, Teddy excitedly waving a sausage round on the end of his fork as he babbled about the day’s trip. Fending off offers of toast and scrambled eggs, Draco sat down and waited for the others to finish eating.
The match raged below him, fast and furious and more than a little dirty. They’d had multiple fouls called on both sides already. It was the first match of the new season, and everyone was a bit on edge. Nerves warred with excitement, leaving everyone skittish and jumpy and resulting in one of the tightest, most exciting games Harry had played in a long time. Puddlemere were aiming to win the League this season, and Oliver had endlessly drilled into them the importance of getting a good start, of establishing dominance early on, and they were feeling the pressure.
‘Yes,’ Draco says simply. He knows what people think about his job, but he’s not about to be shamed for it, especially by someone who seems to have no issue paying for his services. ‘It pays the bills, gives me freedom, and I’m good at it. Plus, I like sex. This way I get to have as much as I want.’
When Malfoy looked back up, his cheeks were tinged with pink. ‘It’s all right,’ he sighed. ‘We manage. I visit a lot. Even with all his many faults, she really did love my father. It shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that a love like that can break you.’
‘Yes, I was supposed to get married here. I was supposed to do a lot of things, supposed to follow all the rules my mother wants me to teach Teddy, and yes, that would be one of them. Maybe even the most important one.’
‘Right. We’re going shopping. Tomorrow, after work.’ When Harry opened his mouth to argue, Draco cut him off; ‘No boyfriend of mine will be seen in stained robes, Potter.’
Without thinking, Harry shot out a hand, reaching for Malfoy. His hand landed on Malfoy’s arm and Malfoy instinctively turned back around, glancing down at Harry’s hand on his arm for a moment, before looking up at Harry’s face. Following the instinct that had told him to reach out, Harry stepped forward, closing the gap between them, and leaned up slightly, pressing his lips against Malfoy’s.
‘And why would we do that?’ Draco said, one eyebrow raised.
All week he’d been haunted by the memory of the kiss, somehow even worse than the memories of the incident, because this time he’d done it on purpose, for no reason other than that he’d wanted to. He couldn’t tell himself that it was fine, that he’d had to do it to save his life, that Ginny would understand because she’d want him alive, no matter the cost. He’d wanted Malfoy, so he’d kissed him. But at least it was only a kiss.
‘You really want me to fuck you, then?’ Potter says, bringing his finger to his mouth and sucking on it. Draco moans at the sight, and Potter seems to take that as a yes. He hurriedly strips himself of his own clothes, and Draco gets a quick glimpse of Potter’s muscled chest and the dark hair that leads down tantalisingly to his hard cock. But then Potter’s turning him, arranging him so that Draco’s palms are pressed against the cold windowpane, his arse brushing against Potter’s cock.
‘I was going to ask you that,’ Malfoy said, his words muffled. He was standing next to Harry, bent double, his hands on his knees, his back moving rapidly with his breath. ‘What did you do?’
‘What is it?’
‘Sure,’ Harry says, answering Draco’s smile with a grin of his own.
‘But we could just go on a trip anyway? No lesson, just… us, taking Teddy out?’ Draco offered, hoping Harry wouldn’t mind being referred to as an ‘
‘Of course. My mother’s parents insisted. There haven’t been many weddings here in recent years though, they were the last Blacks to marry here. I did attend a few weddings here as a child, but I can’t believe how dilapidated it’s got.’
‘Happy to be of service,’ Harry said as Teddy and Andromeda came back into the room, Teddy happily chomping his way through a bag of Hula Hoops.
‘God, it’s late—I should go. Do I owe you extra for going over time?’
were lessons that all pure-blood children took, led by the oldest male in the family, so that they knew what was expected of them and understood pure-blood culture. Draco had undertaken them himself as a child. In the years since the war, however, Draco had begun to realise what a disservice his parents had done him, raising him to believe in his own superiority over everyone who wasn’t pure-blooded. The crimes he had committed in the name of those beliefs still sickened him. Even though he had long ago served his punishment and spent the following years working hard to try and make amends for what he’d done, he could never shake the shame of what he did in the name of ‘tradition’. The thought of teaching those same toxic beliefs and ideals to an innocent child made his stomach turn.
Harry pushed through the crowds of people, not turning back to see if Draco was following him, exiting the ballroom and walking up the ornate staircase in the entrance hall. After trying a few doors, Harry found one that swung open, letting him in to a small sitting room, tastefully decorated and slightly less formal than the rest of the house, three vintage looking sofas arranged around a glass coffee table. Harry walked over to the large windows that overlooked the grounds, listening to the sound of Draco’s footsteps following him into the room.
‘And then,’ Draco adds, a small smile spreading across his face. ‘Maybe we could go for a drink? To celebrate the raid, you know?’
The day the news broke in the papers, Harry stayed at home. He didn’t even bother to owl in—he knew his boss would see the
‘Don’t be a dick,’ Harry chuckled. ‘Would you like to come and see my nice warm shower?’
Draco’s always loved Paris, let it steal his heart and made it his home, but now everywhere he turns there is a reminder of everything he wants but can’t have, and it’s like he’s losing Paris too.
‘He sounds like a wonderful Healer,’ Draco replied, a glint in his eye that set heat building in Harry’s gut. ‘How do you plan to thank him?’
‘Don’t you dare,’ Draco almost growls. If Potter leaves now, with him hard and dripping and desperate like this? Well, Draco doesn’t know what he’d do.
Draco stared for a moment, eyes widening in surprise, but then his expression turned calculating.
‘I need to get flying again,’ Harry said finally, skirting around Malfoy’s last point. ‘I can’t miss the whole season, so whatever it takes, I’m up for it. When can we get started?’
Malfoy took a deep breath, then said the words that made Harry’s heart sink to the ground. ‘If we don’t do anything, it’ll kill you.’
Malfoy settled himself in the chair next to Harry, and they both sat in silence for a moment, Harry panting slightly from the exertion. The curtains were open to the night, the moon hanging in the cloudless sky, more stars visible than usual. Malfoy had come to see Harry in the morning as always, bringing him his Skele-Gro dose, but he’d been pulled away to deal with an emergency before he could assess the progress of Harry’s hip, throwing a promise to come back later over his shoulder as he dashed out of the door. It had been well after dinner by the time he returned, and Malfoy had said they could wait until the following day to try walking, but Harry hadn’t wanted to wait any longer than he had to.
The robes Millie had made for him had been hanging in his wardrobe for several days, layers of protective spells surrounding them to ensure that they were still in pristine condition for the ball. With shaking hands he took them out and slowly put them on, marvelling at the wonder that Millie had created. He’d never had such well fitting robes - they clung to his frame without being indecent or overly showy, and still allowed him to move freely, not too baggy or constricting like some of his old robes. The material was soft and silky, and he let it run through his fingers, enjoying the way it felt. After much debate, they’d decided on a deep navy blue, with intricate silver stitching and small silver buttons down the front, and despite his initial misgivings about wearing something so fancy, Harry had never felt more himself. After desperately trying, and failing, to control his hair, Harry was ready. He had one last look in the mirror, trying to imagine how he would look through Draco’s eyes, and then took a deep breath, steeling himself, before leaving his house and apparating to the manor.
He’d been assigned a complex case at work that had required him to spend multiple days in a shop on Knockturn Alley, undoing layers of centuries old dark magic. It was tiring work, and he’d returned home each day exhausted, his magic spent from hours of casting, with only enough energy to shovel down a quick dinner before collapsing into bed. It should have been a blessing—it should have left him too busy and too tired to spend endless hours thinking about blond hair and clandestine kisses. And yet, he couldn’t think about anything else. He’d set off another curse because he couldn’t focus on the strings of magic, only avoiding being hit by a nasty spell thanks to the speed of his automatic shielding charm. By Friday, his nerves were shot, thanks to too much work and too many nights spent tossing and turning, alternating between thinking about Malfoy and trying not to.
Harry realised with a jolt that Malfoy and Grace had fallen silent and were looking intently at him.
Needless to say, after the week he’d had, Draco wasn’t in the best of moods when he arrived at the Manor. Narcissa appeared to have sensed his mood, and didn’t ask him for much interaction. Instead she chatted away about the comings and goings of life at the Manor, the book she was reading, and the progress of the gardens. Just as Draco had been lulled into a false sense of security however, the topic of Teddy’s accidental magic reared its head once more.
As Malfoy walked away to cast his Patronus, Harry stood up gingerly, relieved to find his legs weren’t too shaky, and began to cast Stasis charms over the rest of the objects in the room. They’d have to come back another day to finish off, and deal with that jewellery box too. Everything was fine, until Malfoy stepped through the bedroom door onto the landing.
‘I love it,’ Harry said, simply. ‘It was everything I needed back then, and the press attention was bearable because of how good it felt to fly again, to have nothing to worry about other than where the Snitch was. I still love it now.’
‘Yeah, Oliver keeps us busy.’ Harry laughed. If Oliver had his way they’d never do anything
They went to a wide variety of places together, some more successful than others. Teddy had adored going to watch a Harpies match from one of the VIP boxes, screaming himself hoarse every time Ginny so much as flew near the Quaffle. Draco had enjoyed it more than he’d expected, and Harry clearly had too, judging by the beaming grin that had stayed on his face the whole time, a grin that Draco kept having to tear his eyes away from.
‘Indeed.’
Draco nodded awkwardly, unsure of what to say, but relieved to hear that Andromeda was less keen on the lessons than Narcissa was. It meant he wouldn’t have to try so hard to avoid her overhearing what he was going.
‘I just- I don’t know. I was done with it, the bureaucracy and the regulations and the feeling that I wasn’t really helping anyone, stuck behind a desk barking orders. It just, it wasn’t right anymore.’
‘Come with me,’ Harry said, holding out a hand to Draco, who immediately took it, regretfully leaving the warmth of Harry’s bed.
Normally when Pansy comes to Paris, her visits are a whirlwind of cocktails and shopping and dancing late into the night, but instead of immediately dragging him out to some fancy gala, Pansy pushes Draco into his living room and makes him sit down.
‘Good,’ Draco laughed.
They were moving slowly now, even Draco having given up on the fancy steps, instead just leading Harry in a slow circle. There was nowhere for Harry to look other that at Draco, his previous need to watch his feet gone thanks to their slow pace. Draco was watching Harry too, and as their eyes met, Harry felt a jolt in his stomach. Neither of them looked away, and the couples dancing around them faded into the distance as Harry stared into Draco’s eyes. When Draco’s gaze flicked down to Harry’s lips, Harry was done for.
‘I wasn’t asking you to do it, Draco,’ Narcissa said serenely. ‘I’ll simply find someone else who will.’
‘Well—you’re—you know,’ Potter sounds flustered, and Draco can’t help grinning.
‘He’s probably desperate to get to Hogwarts,’ Draco said, thinking back to that painfully slow final year at home, when all he had wanted was to be off having adventures at Hogwarts rather than stuck at home with his parents and his tutors.
Malfoy took the hint and walked over the threshold, his arm brushing Harry’s as he passed. Just that simple touch sent shivers down Harry’s spine, and he felt dazed as he closed the door. The snick of the lock echoed loudly in the otherwise silent hall as Harry turned to face Malfoy. Only a few paces separated them, and Harry’s body burned with awareness of their proximity. It felt like so long since he had touched Malfoy, the two months since that last night dragging on for eternity. Malfoy’s face was half in shadows, the dim light from the sconces on the walls making it hard for Harry to see his expression, but he thought that he saw a familiar look of hunger, of want, on Malfoy’s face.
‘He does have a head, it’s just not properly attached.’ Of course Harry had been filling Teddy’s head with tales of Gryffindor and its ghost. ‘Every house has its own ghost though, so whichever house you’re in you’ll get to see one.’
‘Can you feel it, Teddy?’ he asked, knowing that Teddy wasn’t likely to be feeling it as easily as Harry was.
One evening, as they lie on the bed, the sheets in a heap on the ground and sweat drying on their skin, they even warily broach the subject of the war. They’ve skirted the topic multiple times—the war naturally encroaches on any discussion of their lives and shared history—but this time they don’t shy away. Draco listens, rapt, the setting sun making Potter’s skin glow golden, as Potter describes the loneliness of having the world’s hopes pinned on you, of being a scared child in a game controlled by adults. Of the grief that had followed the war, and the loneliness that had remained, even as the world celebrated his achievements.
‘Fuck you, Malfoy.’
Potter takes a step forward, one arm moving as if to reach out and touch, and then he stops dead.
‘Do I have to beg? Is that what you want?’
‘Why not? I know it’s a bit shabby but it wouldn’t take much to fix it up would it? Surely the Malfoy name could get it sorted out.’
Finally,
‘I suppose,’ Harry conceded. ‘But you got over it?’
‘I’m sorry, Harry, that sounds awful.’ Malfoy’s voice was soft, and one hand unfurled from its grip on his mug, coming to rest gently on top of Harry’s. The touch sent sparks down Harry’s arm, and he looked up, locking eyes with Malfoy. The startled look on Malfoy’s face suggested that he’d felt it too.
After that, it became impossible for Harry to avoid thinking about Malfoy, and impossible for him to pretend that this was nothing more than just a quick blowjob to save his life. Thoughts of Malfoy plagued him from the moment he woke up, hard and aching from dreams filled with pale hair and long limbs, to the moment he drifted off at night. He tried to hide it, to keep his inner turmoil from Ginny, but Harry had a feeling he wasn’t hiding it very well. He found himself working late, his stomach curdling when the clock ticked towards five o’clock, automatically reaching for another report when he should have been packing up and heading home. It was safer to stay hidden away in his office, where he could let his thoughts wander as much as he wanted without worrying that Ginny would sense what he was thinking about.
Draco had been waiting for a client. It was a Wednesday evening, 9pm, which always meant Jean-Luc. Draco has no idea how Potter persuaded Jean-Luc to give up his spot, but he only spares a moment to wonder about it. He’s far more intrigued by why Potter is here at all.
‘You’ll need an intensive course of Skele-Gro. According to your notes you’ve taken it before?’ Malfoy was talking like there was no history between them, his tone polite and professional, even slightly disinterested.
Or at least he tries to. It turns out forgetting Harry Potter is harder than he anticipated.
‘I don’t,’ Potter spits out, and Draco can’t help but smile. Potter’s in the game now, and experience tells Draco that Potter won’t back down without a fight.
‘It’s an old curse, a combination of bonding spell and sex magic, designed to keep couples together and make sure they consummated their marriage,’ Malfoy sighed, his eyes no longer meeting Harry’s. ‘You’ll be in pain until we…’
Draco jumps, caught in the act.
‘We were. But then—,’ Malfoy paused, before continuing, ‘but then I slept with you, and then I did it again, and again, and that changed everything. We’d always said we’d continue with our arrangement until it didn’t work anymore, and several weeks ago Astoria sat me down and said it wasn’t working anymore, that she couldn’t be married to me while I was in love with someone else.’
‘Fuck, Malfoy,’ Potter swears, voice rough, when he finally looks back up at Draco’s face.
‘What the actual fuck?’ says a painfully familiar voice.
‘Coming in?’ Harry asks when they separate for air.
‘Yes, very good.’
‘Draco?’
‘Which bit do you think disqualifies you? I would have said we know each other quite well by now, after all this time you’ve spent cluttering up my cafe.’
He’d often wondered what it would be like to see Harry again, after so many years and so much complicated history, but in those imagined scenarios he’d always dealt with it much more smoothly than this, showing Harry how wonderful his life had become rather than collapsing into a state of nervous exhaustion the minute his back was turned. He’d never expected that he’d still react so viscerally just to Harry’s presence, and he hadn’t been able to predict the make over that made it all so much worse. He certainly hadn’t thought that five minutes spent in the same room as Harry would make the crush he’d secretly harboured throughout his teenage years come roaring back with such ferocity.
‘What’s wrong?’ Malfoy said, picking up Harry’s chart. ‘Your Monitoring Charm went off, suggesting an increased heart rate.’
‘Not straight away. I had the same thought you did, at first, that playing Quidditch would put me back into the limelight again, when the press had only just stopped following me everywhere. But the idea wouldn’t go away once Oliver had put it into my head. I spoke to Ron and Hermione, and Ginny—she was already signed to the Harpies by then—and they all encouraged me to go for it, so I did.’
The suspect is tiring, his curses less powerful, his arm shaking as he points his wand in their direction, and Harry chances a glance over at Draco. Draco looks back, his face pink, his hair plastered to his face with sweat, and nods, ever so slightly. They’ve got him. Swiftly, with years of practice behind them, they advance, Harry sending a barrage of minor hexes towards the cowering suspect in an attempt to distract him as Draco, always more skilled at precision work, waits for the perfect moment before casting the final spells to disarm, silence, and handcuff the suspect. Before Harry has even had time to wipe the sweat off his forehead, their back-up team is running down the alley, throwing a cursory ‘good work’ in Harry and Draco’s direction before disapparating with the suspect in tow, bound for the Ministry’s holding cells.
Draco expects Potter to give up after the fourth appointment he refuses to take. There’s plenty of people out there that he can pay for sex, after all. No need to keep coming to Draco when a warm body is all he wants.
Draco is momentarily frozen, mind racing.
The cool air of the alleyway next to the pub was a blissful relief, and Harry sank back against the wall, closing his eyes and trying to forget what a fool he’d just made of himself. He’d only been outside for a few minutes at most when the sound of the side door of the pub opening made him open his eyes. Malfoy walked through the door and into the alley, his footsteps the only sound in the otherwise quiet night as he walked up to where Harry was standing. Harry didn’t move from his position against the wall, even as Malfoy stopped in front of him, so close that Harry could feel the warmth emanating from his body and smell the cologne that Malfoy always wore.
All of Harry’s doubts about whether Malfoy felt the same way faded away as they kissed, clinging to each other like they would fall apart if they let go. Malfoy’s cock was hard against Harry’s, and Harry’s hips automatically began to push forwards, tiny little hitches that increased the simmering desire pulsing around his body. Malfoy responded in kind, pressing against Harry deliciously, his hand slipping down further until it cradled Harry’s arse. At that, Harry’s cock throbbed, almost painful with need, and he groaned into Malfoy’s mouth. Malfoy gasped, with what Harry assumed was pleasure, until Malfoy hurriedly pulled away, stepping back with a horrified look on his face.
‘The more we talk to people, the more likely it is that we’ll be found out,’ he said, the exasperation in his voice making it clear that Harry really should have thought of this already.
‘I was explaining to Trainee Healer Barnett that you turned down Dreamless Sleep last night,’ Malfoy said, his brow furrowing as he looked down at Harry intently. Harry was certain the pain really
‘Nah,’ Harry said, once again perusing the menu. ‘I fancy a hot chocolate, I think. It’s bloody freezing out there. Think I’ll try the peppermint one. Thanks.’
‘Oh,’ Harry said, looking anywhere but at Malfoy. ‘Yeah—I mean, just feeling a bit under the weather. Busy week, you know… I think I’ll just—just go and get some fresh air.’ Harry’s cheeks were burning as he scrambled out of his seat, pushing past the others in his hurry to get outside, away from all the eyes he could feel on him.
‘Are you?’ Harry said when his brain finally processed what Malfoy had just said. ‘In love with someone else, I mean?’
‘There isn’t anyone else, Potter. Your case is complicated; repairing this many badly damaged bones is a challenge, and, unfortunately, you are considered a V.I.P. who requires the best care. In this case, the best care means someone with experience treating these kinds of injuries, and so here I am.’
it anymore.’
‘Good, good,’ Malfoy mused as he walked back into the room. He came to a stop in front of Harry and pulled out his wand, casting a spell over Harry which he recognised as one of their diagnostic spells when lights appeared all over his skin, thin threads of colour that gathered at his chest.
‘I’m what?’
. He might be fit, and brilliant at sex, and sure, Harry might have liked holding his hand and talking to him this evening, but that didn’t mean he
‘It’s good,’ Harry said, indicating his glass.
‘Erm, hello,’ Draco said awkwardly when neither of them looked up from their fight.
As Harry looked up at Malfoy—his cheekbones as razor-sharp as they had been at school, his hair still just as blond, although less severely slicked back—Harry was reminded of the public outcry that had accompanied his appointment at St Mungo’s several years ago. For weeks the
That night, Harry had the best night’s sleep that he’d had the whole time he’d been in hospital, the Skele-Gro a low burn under his skin rather than a raging inferno, and he woke feeling refreshed and almost like he was getting back to normal. The pain in his wrist was nearly entirely gone, and even the watery porridge he was served for breakfast couldn’t dent his good mood.
They appeared on a hillside. In the distance the sea could just be seen, beyond the rolling patchwork hills. In the other direction a small hamlet was just visible, the smoke from chimneys floating up into the clear sky. Draco was pleased that the weather had held out—the views here were far better when the sky was cloudless, and he always felt like the magic was freer too, more playful, not held down by oppressive clouds or rain. He let Harry and Teddy take in the landscape for a moment, not saying anything, a small smile spreading across his face when Harry didn’t let go of his hand even though any practical reasons for needing to hold it were long over.
Ron and Hermione visited several times, on one occasion accompanied by Molly and Arthur. Molly brought a quite frankly excessive amount of food with her, but after so long eating hospital meals, Harry could barely restrain himself from devouring it all at once. At first, Molly fussed, plumping his pillows and fretting over his injuries, but thankfully Harry soon managed to convince her that he really was fine. After that they fell into easy conversation, time flying as Harry was filled in on all the latest stories from the extended Weasley family. The team had been training so intensely in the lead up to the first match that it had been several weeks since Harry had managed to make it to Sunday lunch at the Burrow, and it was only now, as Molly talked excitedly about all her grandchildren that he realised quite how much he missed them all.
Pansy looks at him, concern etched across her face, and Draco hates it. It reminds him too much of the bad times. He doesn’t want her to be worried about him again, not about this.
From then on, Harry always stayed in the cafe while he drank his drink, and occasionally indulged in a pastry, always with a book open in front of him. Draco was fascinated - he’d never expected Harry to be a reader, but clearly he loved to lose himself in a good book. Draco had lined one of the walls of his cafe with bookshelves, filled to the brim with books for his patrons to choose from. By necessity they were all muggle books - he couldn’t risk one of his muggle customers accidentally stumbling across a mishelved wizarding book - but Harry didn’t seem put off. After his first perusal of the shelves, he stopped bringing his own book and started to pick them off the bookcases, taking each book home to finish but always ensuring that he brought it back the next time he came in. Draco didn’t like to admit it, even to himself, but he started to look forward to discovering what Harry would pick, and he found himself bearing Harry’s taste in mind when he browsed second hand bookshops for more additions to the cafe’s shelves.
person in the whole Ministry who could work on a case. It was flattering, in a lot of ways, and Draco would be lying if he said his ego didn’t enjoy it, but the confidence boost couldn’t make up for the lack of sleep and long hours spent in the office trying to determine the exact potion that was responsible for a number of deaths the Aurors were investigating.
The memory of the softness of Harry’s lips against his and the heat that had pulsed through his veins sustained Draco through a hellish week at work that prevented him from doing any more than exchanging the briefest of owls with Harry. He was at work before it got light in the morning, heading home just to fall straight into bed long after dark, scribbling quick notes to Harry in gaps between meetings. Draco loved his work, really, and normally lived for weeks like this, when his brain was constantly whirring and he really felt like he had the opportunity to achieve something big. But this week all he could think was that work was stopping him being able to see Harry again. By the time the weekend finally came, Draco was exhausted, and going out of his mind with the need to see Harry, to touch him, to kiss him again. Judging by the notes Harry had sent him, Harry was in a similar situation, never explicitly coming out and saying it but clearly looking forward to their weekend trip and the chance to see Draco again.
‘They always have the same look; complete and total exhaustion, but not sadness,’ Malfoy said, and Harry looked closer. He was right—the man was clearly shattered, but he didn’t look hollow with grief, unlike the older couple.
’ he shouted, slapping his hands down on the counter. It was the alcohol, he decided. He’d had too much to drink, and he and Ginny hadn’t had sex in a while (since well before the incident, a quiet voice in his mind whispered, but he ignored it), and that was it. It had nothing to do with Malfoy at all. He would go home and sleep it off, and then he could go back to trying to ignore Malfoy in peace, and continue to pretend that absolutely nothing had ever happened between them.
So he’s entirely unprepared when he opens the door to a furious Potter.
Three days later, there’s a loud banging on Draco’s front door. He thinks it must be Pansy, assuming that she’s realised en route to her portkey that she’s left something behind.
‘Because I had to,’ Potter says, his voice quieter, his eyes boring into Draco’s. ‘How else was I going to see you?’
‘Shit,’ Harry swore, closing his eyes again. The longer he was awake the more intense the pain was becoming. It was as though he’d been numb, and now his nerves were slowly coming back to life.
When the Bludger first made impact, he didn’t understand what had happened. One moment he was stretching out a hand to reach for the Snitch, and the next minute he was gasping for breath, pain blooming in his side where the Bludger had connected with its target. With one hand off his broom and no time to prepare, he couldn’t brace against the impact, and for a moment time slowed as he wobbled on his broom, clenching his thighs as he tried desperately to maintain his balance. But the neverending chase for the Snitch had sapped his strength, and his muscles were no match for gravity. For one sickening moment, Harry was aware that he was falling, his stomach turning over from the sudden change in direction, and then everything went black.
Harry woke up aching, every fibre of his body calling out for Draco’s body, wave after wave of desire rushing over him in a way that he hadn’t felt in a long time. Even as the details of the dream began to fade, the feelings it provoked in him remained, a previously unnoticed need for something deeper bubbling up to the surface. All day his hand itched to reach out and touch, the need only growing stronger each time he remembered he couldn’t. Seeing Malfoy was torture, feelings he had never even considered before, suddenly making themselves known through butterflies and shaking hands whenever he looked over at Malfoy.
’ Draco gasped, his eyes wide and heated as he looked down at Harry.
By the time Pansy has run out of stories of socialites and soirées, they’re both lying on the floor, the cushions from Draco’s sofa stuffed under their heads. The floor isn’t at all comfortable, the wood cold and hard against Draco’s back, but he’s too drunk to care. Too angry, as well.
‘That’s very nice of you to offer, Draco, thank you. Andromeda will be so pleased.’ Narcissa smiled pleasantly at Draco, and Draco cursed himself for being so easily manipulated, even after so many years of attempting to avoid it.
‘It was part of it, although I would never claim full credit,’ Malfoy said. ‘But I have certainly encouraged my colleagues to include some form of physical therapy with their patients, when suitable. They haven’t been very keen to act on my suggestion, however,’ Malfoy added with a wry smile.
‘What?’ Harry hadn’t expected that. He’d thought that maybe Malfoy would suggest Dreamless Sleep again, or worse, try and talk to him about his nightmare.
They appeared in the grounds of an old country house, far older than the Manor, its exterior now starting to show signs of age and neglect, the grass growing up over the soles of Draco’s shoes.
Afterwards, they lay sprawled across Harry’s bed, sweat drying on their skin, their gradually slowing breathing the only sound in the room. For the first time in a month, Harry’s brain had stopped spinning while he was lost in the feel of Malfoy’s body on his, but as the afterglow faded, Harry couldn’t stop his brain from whirring into action again.
‘Oh,’ Harry replied as he trailed behind Malfoy. He and Malfoy might be on better terms now, but he was still wary of Parkinson. ‘Sounds fun,’ he added, scepticism bleeding into his tone despite his best efforts to sound sincere.
‘It is,’ Draco agreed. ‘It’s not why I brought you here though. Come on.’
‘But you wouldn’t want to waste it, surely? Might as well get your money’s worth.’
‘Good,’ Draco says, knowing that the topic is far from forgotten about but relieved to have the initial discovery over with.
‘Probably should go to St Mungo’s,’ Harry sighed. He hated going to the hospital. Hated being fussed over by an endless parade of Healers and mediwitches who all wanted to be able to say they’d helped save Harry Potter’s life. And he really didn’t fancy word getting out that he and Malfoy had ended up injured on their first case together. No one would believe that they’d been working well together when they found that out; his boss would definitely go back to not letting them work together, and Harry had actually quite enjoyed his day working with Malfoy. It was still weird, no denying that, but Malfoy was undeniably good at his job, and Harry appreciated working with someone as efficient and effective as him.
The power of Harry's Apparition combined with his hand in Draco's left Draco reeling when they arrived, the adjustment to a new location taking longer than usual. They'd appeared in a tucked away side street, lined with terraced houses. It felt worlds away from the hustle and bustle of London, even though Draco knew they hadn't left the city. As Draco looked up and down the street, curious to see where Harry had chosen to live, Harry's house appeared from between two others. An eggshell blue front door contrasted with the brick walls of the three storey house, and two Laurel bushes stood either side of the three steps that led to the door. Draco followed Harry and Teddy into the house, shivering as the wards washed over him and drinking in every detail as Harry led them down the hall, pointing out various rooms as they walked. Teddy ran ahead into the living room, jumping on to a comfortable looking sofa and immediately reaching for the TV controller. Clearly he was very familiar with Harry's house, and Draco wondered just how often Teddy stayed here. They left Teddy in the living room, the TV already blaring music, and Harry showed Draco into the kitchen, promising cups of tea and biscuits.
, or anything Father would have approved of the Malfoy heir doing. I wanted something different, something that was mine.’’
‘What were you planning to do to me, Potter, before you knew it was me?’
‘But he’s a git!’ Ron said, still incensed, his ears turning a deep pink.
‘We better get back to the office. They’ll be waiting for our report.’
By the time Draco got Teddy back to Andromeda’s they were both exhausted but happy, and Draco couldn’t help but think how grateful he was that Harry had suggested the idea of trips out. It was going to make all the difference to the lessons, and Draco couldn’t wait for the next one.
‘They do have rules, yes. No marrying Half-bloods, Muggle-borns, or Muggles of course.’ Draco took a deep breath, and added; ‘and no marrying men, either.’
And then Potter walks into his hotel room.
‘Okay,’ Harry said, raising his good hand in a strange half wave as Malfoy left, immediately dropping his head back onto his pillow when the door shut in despair at himself.
In the end it’s Draco who makes Harry stop, pushing him off with a shaky, breathless plea for
He’s furious, and he needs to do something. He briefly considers going to find Potter so that he can shout at him, but then remembers he has no idea where Potter lives. Just another reminder that this was all business for Potter, that none of it had been real.
‘Fine,’ Harry said, even though he wasn’t at all. His leg ached and his mind whirled as he tried to process what had just happened. He’d wanted to kiss Malfoy, desperately, and for a moment it had seemed like Malfoy wanted it too.
‘Be careful, Ron!’ Hermione admonished. ‘We’ll leave you to rest now, if you’ve got everything you need?’ Harry nodded. ‘Let us know if you need anything else at all, and we’ll come and see you again soon.’
Harry didn’t take his eyes off Malfoy as he spoke and kept his mouth shut, even when Malfoy referenced the way he was viewed after the war. Harry was well aware of how quickly the wizarding press had turned on the Death Eaters, even though much of the papers and wider society had been falling into line behind Voldemort only months earlier. It wasn’t like Harry’d had a problem with it at the time—the Death Eaters had deserved all they got, he’d thought, and it was only later that he began to wonder if more could have been done to help rehabilitate them. Judging by how much the man sat in front of him had clearly changed, Harry thought maybe it would have been possible.
‘Well, I suppose I can be, for the right person.’ Draco’s heart was pounding in his chest, nerves making him feel sick. He hoped he hadn’t taken it too far, that he hadn’t misread Harry’s comment. It had sounded flirty, but Merlin, what if Draco had just imagined it?
‘So?’ Harry said, flicking his tongue out to lick Draco’s cock again, grinning at the sharp intake of breath from above him.
Harry had been searching for the Snitch for well over two hours now without even a sighting. Judging by the frustrated expression on the face of Thorebourne, the opposing Seeker, she was having no luck either. The Chasers below them were trading goals, taking it in turns to edge ahead on points before the other team pulled them back to level. The crowd was loving it, the shouting and singing only getting louder as the points racked up but no clear leader emerged. Harry, however, was tense. The only way this ended was if the Snitch was caught, and it needed to be by him.
‘I don’t really do anything, I suppose,’ Harry said after a momentary pause.
‘Ginny? Is everything ok?’ Harry quickly shoved his wand in his back pocket and hurried across the room to where Ginny was sitting at the kitchen table, her arms crossed over her chest, her face stony.
Potter casts the spells—Draco normally prefers to do things manually but right now he’s grateful for anything that gets Potter in him quicker—and then he’s taking Draco, right there in the window, for all of Paris to see.
The weather was grim the next day, endless grey drizzle cloaking the city in a shroud of mist, a sea of umbrellas surrounding Harry as he walked from the Ministry to Diagon Alley. He could have Apparated to avoid the rain - Draco had, shaking his head and muttering about Harry being completely incomprehensible as he went - but he had wanted the walk to clear his head and, if he was honest, to delay what he was about to do. All day Draco had been chatting about the tailor they were going to visit, ‘a genius with fabric’ apparently, who would make Harry the best dress robes he’d ever own. Draco was extremely excited; Harry was extremely nervous. Buying robes together, letting Draco have input into what he wore, and maybe even watch him try them on, seemed far too intimate to Harry. But there was no way he was getting out of it, however long he dawdled on the damp streets of London so, steeling himself, he entered the Leaky Cauldron.
‘It can be. But then some days are so rewarding that it makes all the tiring days and late nights and no social life worth it.’ Malfoy’s face was earnest, leaving Harry in no doubt that he meant what he said. ‘It feels good,’ Malfoy continued, ‘to be able to do something good. It’s about the only thing that lets me sleep at night.’
Draco’s cock rubs against Harry’s stomach with every one of Harry’s thrusts, and it feels incredible. Harry’s hitting his prostate incessantly, pushing Draco closer and closer to his orgasm with every stroke, and although Draco doesn’t want this to end, he knows he can’t hold off much longer. When Harry closes his eyes and kisses Draco, his tongue slipping into Draco’s mouth, Draco is done for. He moans into Harry’s mouth as he starts to come, their bodies growing sticky as he spills between them. It’s the best orgasm of his life.
Draco doesn’t reply, but instead starts to tease Harry, tracing lines around the head of his cock with one finger, making Harry’s cock jump as he brushes the sensitive skin under his head. It’s exquisite torture, keeping him teetering on the edge without giving him enough stimulation to send him over.
‘Great,’ Harry said, smiling up at Malfoy to confirm that his words were genuine. He was never quite sure if he was able to convey enthusiastic agreement without sounding painfully sarcastic instead. But Malfoy seemed to get the message, as he smiled back at Harry. His eyes darted down to Harry’s mouth briefly, and Harry’s stomach twisted again.
Malfoy nodded at Harry’s words, his lips twitching up into a smile that made Harry’s stomach somersault. ‘I know it won’t be easy,’ Malfoy said, his tone sincere, ‘but I want to try too.’
Harry had been there, of course, at his trial. But they had never talked about it, and Draco didn’t feel like he could yet, especially not with Teddy there. To Draco’s great relief, Harry took the reins of the conversation, sparing him from trying to talk around the lump that had formed in his throat. He half-listened to Harry explaining the wizarding justice system to Teddy, trying to pay attention to what Harry was saying so that he could expand on it further during a future lesson. But with every word Harry said about the process of charging someone with a crime and putting them on trial for it, Draco couldn’t stop the flashbacks to his own post war experience. He knew he’d done terrible, terrible things, things he probably couldn’t ever make up for, but with the new perspective on his childhood that he’d gained from teaching Teddy, his heart ached for the misguided child who had been brainwashed into believing he was doing the right thing.
‘It’s Gracebourne Estate. It’s where all the Blacks have got married, going back centuries. Lots of other pure-blood families too, of course, but we’re here for the Black connection.’
‘Cheers. I try my best, anyway,’ Harry said, before stifling a yawn.
After a month, Pansy comes to visit. She too had fled Britain after the war, settling herself in Monaco where she’s become somewhat of an it girl, dating a string of gorgeous men and women and swanning around on yachts. Draco had been planning on visiting her this summer, as he always does—it’s good to get away from the city in high season—but he hadn’t, first caught up in Potter, and then caught up in missing him.
Draco woke up early on Saturday morning, his stomach already tying itself in knots with wrestling nerves and excitement. He couldn’t wait to see Harry again, but was nervous to see whether things would be different between them, unsure of how they would behave around each other. That wasn’t the only reason for his nerves though. He’d had this trip in mind since he first started to plan his and Teddy’s adventures, but had been saving it until the end because of its importance and significance, both to the pure-blood communities but also to Draco himself. Draco had been taken there by his parents when he was young, maybe aged five or six, so long ago that his memories of the event were fuzzy and indistinct, but he would never forget the way the magic felt coursing through his veins, the moment when he really understood what he was and what it meant. He couldn’t wait for Teddy and Harry to experience it.
There’s a wriggle of something like happiness and excitement in Draco’s stomach at Potter’s words.
‘I asked first,’ Draco says, internally cursing himself for the childish retort.
‘I have no idea, Potter,’ Malfoy said finally. ‘Maybe it’ll be enough. The only way to know for sure is to test it.’
‘No, or at least not heirlooms from that family. Robertson did some digging and found out which shop they’d come from, and we eventually managed to get the owner to show us his records. The daughter had bought them all, in quick succession, and had evidently decided to hide them at her mother’s house.’
‘If you need anything, don’t hesitate to let us know,’ Malfoy said, before gesturing to Grace to go through the door, adding, ‘after you.’
They managed to keep the news of their divorce a secret for two months.
‘And you were brought here as a kid?’
They both fell silent then, Harry’s brain racing as he tried to find a loophole, any way to avoid this. It’s not like he
‘Merlin, yes,’ Malfoy said, his voice ragged. ‘You have no idea, Potter, no idea how—’ Malfoy cut himself off abruptly, hauling Harry back into a devastating kiss.
Things started to go wrong, however, as soon as they entered the Tube station. Draco had been to Gringotts and exchanged some of his Galleons for Muggle money, so they headed straight for the ticket machines, Draco desperately hoping he could remember how Muggle money worked. He wasn’t completely useless with technology—he knew how to use a computer for Merlin’s sake—but the machine was slow and unresponsive each time he jabbed at it with his finger, and his frustration grew each time he accidentally poked the wrong option and had to backtrack. A queue was starting to form behind him, people even starting to pointedly look at their watches or tap their feet in a sure sign of extreme impatience, but as Draco grew more self-conscious about his slowness, he just got clumsier. When he finally got to the point of paying for their tickets, he thought the worst was over, but then he fumbled and dropped a bunch of money on the floor, Teddy shrieking and chasing after the coins as Draco hurriedly picked up the notes. It was painfully embarrassing, and Draco’s cheeks were still burning when they eventually made it onto the train.
‘Charming as ever, Potter, no wonder you don’t normally bring a date to this kind of thing,’ Draco laughed, before starting up the path to the house.
Ron grumbled something that Harry couldn’t quite make out, and then tugged the chart out of Hermione’s hands.
‘Why did you, then?’ he asks.
, a mixture of comfort and practicality with each piece of furniture or decoration somehow coming together to make the room seem like somewhere Harry completely belonged. The mantelpiece and several of the shelves of the bookcase in one of the alcoves contained many photos, some showing Harry and Teddy, others of Harry and his friends, a few in pride of place containing worn old photos of people Draco assumed must be Harry’s parents. He was in the middle of browsing Harry’s books—they ranged from Muggle classics, to Quidditch autobiographies, to magical theory books that surely were a gift from Hermione—when Harry reentered the room.
‘It’s true!’ Harry exclaimed, casting about for a way to make her believe him. ‘If he stopped touching me, everything hurt, almost as bad as the Cruciatus Curse. Apparently it’s old magic, meant to, um, help with marriages. And we didn’t fuck, anyway,’ Harry added as an afterthought, although he regretted it immediately.
‘I—uh—I don’t know,’ Harry said, aware that nothing he said was going to make this any better but still trying to work out a way through the minefield anyway.
They’d stopped walking as they got more involved in their conversation; Harry was glad to be able to concentrate just on Malfoy rather than on the increasing throbbing in his hip. The wall he was now leaning against provided some much needed support as he took the weight off his sore leg, but Malfoy was still standing close by, just in case.
They stood in silence for a moment, and then Malfoy sighed. ‘I should probably go,’ he said, his gaze locked on Harry. Something in his expression made Harry’s stomach flip, and he had the sudden urge to grab Malfoy’s hand, to ask him to stay, just for a little bit longer.
Harry rubbed a hand over his face, his stubble rough against his palm. He did usually go to end of the week drinks, and usually had a great time, but Malfoy would be there. Harry had managed to mostly avoid Malfoy since the
‘I’m cold, and sticky.’
Potter’s hands move to bracket Draco’s face, trapping him against the window, the small flexes of his biceps catching the corner of Draco’s eye. There’s so much power, both physical and magical, hidden just below the surface of Potter and Draco loves it. He almost wants to try and move away, just to see how Potter reacts.
‘Um,’ Harry hesitated. With anyone else, he would lie. It would be so easy to say that his leg had hurt and woken him up, that he’d twisted wrong in his sleep or put pressure on one of his bruises. He definitely should want to lie to Malfoy. But something made him want to tell Malfoy the truth. Something made him think he could trust Malfoy with it. ‘I had a nightmare,’ Harry said finally, hating how vulnerable it made him feel to say that, however much he now trusted Malfoy.
—Malfoy once again demonstrated his oral skills, leaving Harry’s hands scratched from scrabbling against the brick wall as his legs trembled under the onslaught of Malfoy’s mouth, and Harry had never felt so powerful as he did when he returned the favour, overcome by the heady rush of knowing that he was the reason Malfoy was falling apart, his hands tight in Harry’s hair as he spilled down Harry’s throat. When Malfoy spun Harry around one week, the mouth on Harry’s cock being replaced by Malfoy’s hand and a tongue licking up his crease, Harry came almost immediately, the novelty of the act and the feeling of someone touching him in a place he’d only tentatively explored on his own more than he could bear. The week following that was one of the hardest Harry had experienced, his thoughts constantly returning to the alleyway, his cock constantly half-hard. When Friday finally came and Malfoy did it again, Harry nearly wept with relief.
‘Must have been desperate,’ Harry said, walking up the cobbled path to join Malfoy outside the house. Their boss had sworn never to let them work the same job after a big fight early in their careers had resulted in a cursed necklace nearly blowing up a client’s house, but everyone else had been busy today, so he’d been forced to reconsider his policy. ‘Been here long?’
‘Morning,’ Harry said, his own tone rather more maudlin. However glad he was to be done with disgusting potions and uncomfortable hospital beds, he couldn’t make himself feel cheerful today.
‘Mmh?’ Draco replied, nervous.
It’s enjoyable, for a minute or two at least, to see Potter on the back foot. But Draco has in fact grown up over recent years and no longer takes pleasure in tormenting people—at least not unless they ask—so he takes pity on Potter.
‘What are
‘What the -’ Harry spluttered as he looked away from the menu. ‘Malfoy? What are you doing here?’
‘You like it here, then?’ Potter’s voice is tentative, as though he too is trying to restore the peace.
Malfoy shrugged, the gesture casual yet still infuriatingly elegant and drawing Harry’s attention to the shirt Malfoy was wearing instead of his robes.
‘Just like you are,’ Harry replies, settling himself between Draco’s open thighs and wandlessly casting the spell to slick his cock. ‘I want to see you, kiss you, while I fuck you.’
Harry’s stomach flipped over as Malfoy moved closer, so close that Harry could see every pale eyelash, and the flecks of blue in his eyes. Malfoy was slightly taller than Harry, and it was as he slowly bent down that Harry was hit with the realisation of what they were about to do. His gaze flicked down from Malfoy’s eyes to his mouth, and then Malfoy’s lips were on his.
‘So you came here.’
Draco made his way back over to Harry in time for the speeches to start, and as the presenter introduced Draco’s ex with a long list of all his accomplishments, Harry reached down and took Draco’s hand once again, his heart beating out of his chest as he did so, terrified that Draco would reject it. But Draco didn’t, the frown that had appeared on his face when his ex took to the stage being replaced by a small, private smile that made Harry’s heart leap with joy. Harry didn’t even listen to Baptiste’s speech, too focused on the warmth of Draco’s palm against his to care what he was saying. Harry was taken by surprise when suddenly Draco started tugging on his hand, dragging Harry onto the dancefloor.
‘Do all wizards know about this place?’ Harry asked, Teddy opening his eyes and looking interestedly at Draco.
‘Isn’t it incredible?’ Draco asked, smiling at the delighted look on Teddy’s face as he luxuriated in the feeling of true, unadulterated magic. Even the less powerful version that Teddy was feeling was still something beyond compare, like nothing he would have ever felt before.
‘Fuck, I can’t do this,’ Harry gasped, stepping back in a desperate attempt to put space between them, to stop him reaching out and hauling Malfoy against him again. ‘I have to go.’
But then Potter leans in, and any thoughts Draco had of delaying this vanish. Potter’s close enough that Draco can feel his breath ghosting across his lips, can see the very faint smattering of freckles on the bridge of his nose. His eyes are flicking between Draco’s eyes and his lips, and Draco knows Potter is about to kiss him. For a brief moment he contemplates letting him, thinks about giving in to his desire to know how Potter’s lips would feel against his. But he can’t. It’s his one rule, and he can’t break it for anyone, not even Potter.
‘Merlin, Pansy, I work with her!’
By the end of the week Harry was exhausted. He was spending several hours a day watching training sessions and the rest of the day was taken up by exercises and sessions with the team physio. He barely had time to himself during the day to think about anything but training, let alone spend hours missing Malfoy, and yet he couldn’t stop the thoughts that popped into his head every so often when he thought of something that he wanted to tell Malfoy, or when he successfully did a new exercise and wanted to show Malfoy how much he was progressing.
‘That’s—that’s good,’ Harry murmured, afraid that speaking too loudly might break this quiet bubble of intimacy that had formed around them. He opened his mouth to speak again, but the sound of a Monitoring Charm going off in the room next to them made him jump and broke the moment. Malfoy looked away and gestured for Harry to keep walking.
‘I think whatever curse was on that jewellery box did more to us than we first thought,’ Malfoy said, his voice grim, his face set. ‘I want to examine it, will you be all right for a moment?’
They’d come to a halt in the kitchen, and Malfoy turned to face Harry, ignoring his comment. ‘I’ve made a start on the initial detection spells, as you can see.’
He heard someone, a Healer, he assumed, move closer to his bed, the sound of their footsteps loud in the otherwise quiet room. The last thing Harry wanted to do was open his eyes, past experience making him well aware that the lights would make his head hurt even more than it already did, but he also wanted to get out of here as soon as possible. He knew that the longer he pretended not to be awake, the longer they’d keep him. His head screamed in agony as he tentatively opened one eye, squinting against the lights. The shock of the sudden brightness prevented him from seeing anything in the room, glowing spots of colour blooming before his eyes instead.
‘I thought I’d come and check up on you before I left for the night,’ Malfoy said when Harry didn’t speak, answering Harry’s unspoken question about his change of attire. ‘How are you feeling?’
But that will have to be saved for another day—and Merlin, Draco hopes that there’s another day. Today, his hands move to the button of Harry’s jeans, undoing it and unzipping his flies. As soon as they’re undone Harry is eagerly pushing his trousers down, revealing his toned thighs and a pair of straining black boxer shorts. Draco can’t resist dropping to his knees and kissing along the length of Harry’s cock, delighting in the noise that Harry makes. And then Draco is slipping his fingers under the waistband, needing to see Harry properly, without a scrap of fabric between them. Draco pulls off Harry’s boxers, and then he’s bare and all Draco can do is look, letting his eyes wander up and down Harry’s body, taking in every detail.
‘You wouldn’t have known, watching you fly,’ Draco said as he came to a stop in front of Harry. His gaze was admiring, and Harry was reminded of one of their dates, a month or two into their relationship, when they’d finally been able to fly together. It had been one of the best dates of his life, and as they’d laid in bed afterwards, sweaty and sated, Draco had confessed that he’d always been turned on by watching Harry fly.
‘That one of the Founders put a big snake in the castle because he didn’t like people with Muggle families and then sometimes the snake attacked people, like Hermione,’ Teddy said matter-of-factly.
‘That’s good, very good,’ Malfoy said, nodding to himself. ‘I’ll need to give it a proper examination but we should be able to start exercising it tomorrow.’
He works, seeing his regulars and a few new clients the hotel finds for him. He wanders the streets of Paris, sticking to the quieter neighbourhoods to avoid the hordes of tourists that swarm the city in the summer. He goes out with his friends, losing hours to lazy conversations over drinks and cigarettes on the terraces of bars in Le Marais.
‘Yeah, me too, Ginny will be…’ Harry trailed off as a wave of guilt washed over him. Ginny would be at home, waiting for him, ready to spend a nice evening together with no idea that her husband had just had sex with another man. Harry felt like he might be sick.
‘What the fuck was that?’ Harry gasped out when he finally felt able to speak.
‘I know.’ Draco sits back on his thighs, smirking up at Potter, remembering all the times he’d provoked Potter with a similar expression back when they were younger. He never would have expected to be in this position years later, but he’s momentarily pleased that he spent so many years goading Potter—he knows exactly how to push his buttons, and that’s useful information to him right now.
Harry licks a stripe up Draco’s prick, savouring the taste of him, before licking around the head, revelling in the groan that escapes Draco. With just the tip of his tongue, Harry teases Draco, his hand loose around the base of Draco’s cock, his own prick throbbing in the confines of his trousers as he explores every inch of Draco’s cock.
‘Well if you can’t fly with them, we’ll have to go some time. Have a rematch, finally figure out who the best Seeker really is.’ The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them, before he could remind himself that Malfoy was just his Healer, and was only spending time with him because it was his job. Harry might be finding himself with some slightly uncomfortable new feelings for Malfoy, but that didn’t mean Malfoy reciprocated them in any way.
‘In that case I’m sure you’re aware of how painful it can be, and how long it takes.’ Malfoy paused until Harry nodded. ‘As you’ve broken so many bones, it will take several days to repair them all.’
Harry eventually rolls away, but he doesn’t get up and leave like Draco is used to. Instead, he stays next to Draco, seeming totally at ease with his nudity and what they’ve just done. He starts to stroke Draco’s wrist, his fingers making Draco shiver as they slowly explore the flowers tattooed there. To Draco’s relief he doesn’t say anything. He knows Harry is aware of what the flowers cover, but he doesn’t want to discuss it, not now. Not when he’s so happy and at peace.
Unsurprisingly, Ron was angry with Harry at first—Harry had let him shout, get it out of his system, had let the insulting things Ron said about Malfoy wash over him until Ron ran out of steam, his anger burning out as it always did eventually. Once Ron was settled on the sofa with a cold beer in his hand, Harry explained everything, from the incident at the cottage through to his conversation with Ginny and his plans for the future. Ron’s facial expressions told Harry exactly what he was thinking as Harry recounted the events of the last few months, but he stayed quiet, letting Harry talk, and only when Harry had finished speaking did he admit that he wasn’t sure he’d ever understand what drew Harry to Malfoy, but that he was with Harry whatever he chose. Heart full and shoulders drained of tension that he didn’t even realise he’d been carrying, Harry pulled Ron into a hug. Things weren’t completely fixed—Harry knew he’d have plenty more awkward conversations to get through, but as the evening passed by, the two of them sitting on the sofa listening to a Quidditch match, beers in hand, Harry felt like just maybe everything would be all right.
‘Oh, really? Try me,’ Ginny said, looking up at Harry again, her tone icy and her expression cold, but Harry could see the tears filling her eyes.
‘Fuck, Draco, don’t stop,’ Harry pants. ‘’M so close.’
‘You call yourself an Auror, I’ve been standing here for at least two minutes,’ Draco says, the left-hand corner of his mouth twitching up into the smirk that Harry loves so much.
Harry felt it first, and Draco caught the moment where his eyes widened in shock and his mouth fell open, Harry coming to a sudden halt before tripping forwards as he chased the feeling further into the valley.
Draco mutters something about being pleased Potter had a good time, before getting off the bed, his afterglow well and truly vanished. He stands by the window, pretending to watch the outside world as he studiously ignores the sounds of Potter moving about, straightening his clothes and gathering his things. He doesn’t want to look over, afraid that his face will say something he’d rather keep hidden.
‘Who can’t you marry here? Do they have rules? Is it a strict pure-blood only thing?’ If anyone else had been asking all these questions, pressing on such a sore spot for Draco, he would have told them to fuck off and mind their own business, but for some reason he couldn’t get angry with Harry, and instead found himself wanting to open up, to talk about the things he always struggled to discuss with his friends.
‘How is your pain?’ Grace was asking, and Harry turned back to focus on her. ‘Manageable?’
‘Harry told me, did you know he can talk to snakes? It’s so cool,’ Teddy explained excitedly.
‘Enjoying yourself?’ Draco murmurs, his hands never pausing their movements through Harry’s hair.
And now Potter’s standing right in front of him, apparently willing to pay for sex. Draco doesn’t think he can pass up this opportunity to live one of his fantasies.
‘Indeed.’
‘Goodbye, then,’ Malfoy said, and then he was gone, and Harry was left alone, in the room where they’d fucked, the room where he’d betrayed his wife.
Harry tailed off, not knowing how to find the words to explain what he was feeling. How to explain the swirling guilt that still lingered, despite knowing that he was free to sleep with whoever he wanted now? And yet, he knew he wanted Malfoy, knew he wanted to keep doing this. Being back with Malfoy, after what had felt like a neverending time apart, had felt like suddenly being able to breathe again. But then Malfoy shifted position, and the light caught on the ring on his left hand, and Harry remembered that he might be single now, but Malfoy wasn’t.
Harry spent the day lying on the sofa, a hand-knitted blanket that Molly had given him and Ginny when they had first moved in together pulled over him. He barely moved, not bothering with lunch, pretending to listen to the wireless but in reality staring blankly up at the ceiling, his brain alternating between being blank with shock and almost overwhelmed with thoughts of Malfoy, and curses, and Ginny. Each time he thought of Malfoy his stomach twisted with a mix of guilt, anger, and lingering desire, and thinking of Ginny was even worse. He hated that he had betrayed her, hated that a part of him was still stuck on the implication of Malfoy’s suggestion that they
‘The papers thankfully quickly lost interest in us, but understandably no one would hire me. For a while I just floated, not sure what to do with myself, occupied with making sure Mother was coping as well as she possibly could, but eventually it became clear I’d need to do something if we didn’t want to run out of money. I didn’t want to do something
would never let that happen, certainly not while he played professionally.
Harry was achingly hard already, and he ground his hips against Malfoy’s, his stomach twisting with excitement when Malfoy rocked back against him. The friction and the knowledge that Malfoy was as into this as Harry felt incredible, but Harry wanted more. Pulling back to give Malfoy the chance to stop him, Harry pushed Malfoy’s robes off his shoulder, the dark blue fabric puddling at their feet, before moving a shaking hand to the top button of his shirt.
‘What the fuck is this, Malfoy?’ Potter says, brandishing a piece of parchment in Draco’s face.
He’s so relaxed, in fact, that he jumps, water splashing over the sides of the tub and onto the floor, when he realises that someone else is in the bathroom with him.
And now, as they stand alone in the alleyway, the only sound their slowing breathing, Harry can hardly bear it. He can feel the heat pouring off Draco from where they’re stood so close together, nearly touching but not quite, and he suddenly aches with need, more forceful than he’s felt in a long time. It’s like he’s been ignoring it for so long that its suddenly decided that going full force is the only way to get Harry to act on it, and now that he’s even slightly mentally acknowledged it, the urge can’t be held back.
‘I want to see you,’ Potter pants, before flipping Draco over, slipping one of Draco’s legs over his shoulder and pushing back in again.
‘I don’t kiss my clients,’ Draco says, Potter’s eyes snapping up to meet his. ‘Not on the lips.’
Harry wanted so much; he wanted to taste Malfoy, to let his hands discover every inch of his skin, every peak and valley of his body, to sink into him again and again, to feel Malfoy inside him, but he couldn’t bear to pull away for long enough for any of that, too lost in Malfoy’s kisses and the motion of their bodies as they rocked into each other. Harry’s orgasm crested quickly, too powerful for him to stop, and he came with a gasp and a whispered
‘I had a similar case, several years ago,’ he began. ‘Quidditch injury, a fall from very high up—higher than your fall—more broken bones than I’ve ever seen on one person before. You probably remember it—I think you were playing by then.’
Draco talks too, telling Potter things he’s only ever shared with Pansy. He talks about how hostile Britain was to him, after the war. About his father dying in Azkaban, and the Ministry refusing to release his body, stripping him and his mother of the ability to hold a proper funeral. He tells Potter about the life he’s built here in Paris, about the friends he’s made and the freedom he’s found in being able to live and love openly.
‘And that’s why you brought us here?’
Her voice gradually got stronger as she spoke, and when Harry nodded in response, any last traces of nerves on her face vanished, replaced by a tentative smile. Harry couldn’t resist glancing over at Malfoy, who was watching Grace closely, a look that could almost be described as pride on his face.
From that note on, Draco and Harry regular correspondence. At first they just discussed their trips, planning things they could do in the future, or talking about Teddy’s reaction to the previous one. Gradually though, their notes began to branch out into more general topics, first about a tough day Harry had at work, then about the theory Draco was trying to prove and Teddy’s latest obsession with something called Pokémon. Throughout the day Draco’s eyes would flick over to the window, checking whether an owl was on the horizon, excitement rushing over him each time he unrolled a new note from Harry. The more Draco learned about Harry and his life, the more he wanted to know, their messages getting longer and longer each time. It was on the verge of taking over his life, thoughts of Harry, and their notes, and their trips, and Teddy distracting him from his work and life to the point that his boss had to pull him into his office to ask what on earth was hindering his progress with his investigation.
‘Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks aren’t here, and Edward is growing up in a pure-blood family. It’s important that he learns these things,’ Narcissa said, her tone taking on a sharper edge.
‘Want to try going for a walk tomorrow?’ Malfoy asked.
‘Nothing revolutionary, believe me,’ Malfoy said. ‘Any of my colleagues could have done the same, but I had one advantage that they didn’t. Due to my, ah, lowly status within the hospital at the time, I had a significantly smaller caseload, and so was able to dedicate far more of my time to my patient. He followed the same course of Skele-Gro that you’re taking now, although he required several more days than you will, due to the quantity of bones to be repaired. Any Healer would have followed that regimen of potions.’
Once Harry was safely deposited back in bed, Malfoy let go of his arm but didn’t immediately leave.
‘Ready to go, Teddy?’ Draco said when he finally tore his attention away from the match long enough to notice his arrival.
‘Right, well I’ll leave you all to it,’ Harry continued, heaving himself off the sofa with a grunt. ‘Enjoy your lesson, Ted, and I’ll see you next week.’ With a quick ruffle of Teddy’s bright blue hair and a hug for Andromeda, Harry was gone, leaving Draco behind to try and get his thoughts away from Harry and back onto the dull topic of inheritance.
‘Shit!’ Draco hissed suddenly, his hand coming to grip the base of his cock tightly, forcing Harry off him. ‘Was going to come,’ he explained at Harry’s curious look.
‘I can feel it!’ he exclaimed, laughing in shock as his eyes slid closed again.
‘And then what would you want me to do?’ Draco has his ideas about what Potter might say next, but it doesn’t matter really—he’ll do whatever Potter wants.
‘Good,’ Malfoy said, before striding across the room and onto the landing. ‘And now?’
‘I’m well aware of what the British public are like,’ Draco says, a hard edge creeping into his voice. ‘Why do you think I left?’
‘Or it might be the best thing I’ve ever done.’
‘When I have nightmares I always find moving helps,’ Malfoy said simply. ‘We can go to the tearoom.’
‘Anyway, we can figure out the whys later, let’s focus on the curses. I don’t want to be here forever.’
Harry didn’t think about the ball for the rest of the day, too caught up in the excitement of finally having a potential lead for his case and then distracted by the busyness of dinner and trying to get three far too awake children into bed. But then, once the children had all finally gone to their rooms and the house fell silent, thoughts of his and Draco’s conversation came rushing back.
The next day was no different. This time Ginny insisted that he stay at home, telling him he looked dreadful. He must have looked really bad, as she sent him back to bed, bringing him up enough water and snacks to last him until she got home from work. When he heard the crack of her Apparating away, Harry couldn’t hold back the tears any longer, and he sobbed into their pillows, the scent of Ginny all around him.
An awkward silence fell then, as they looked at each other. The danger had passed, Harry would survive, what they’d done had worked. Harry supposed he should probably say thank you, but he couldn’t seem to speak. Malfoy came to his rescue yet again.
Harry couldn’t quite place it, but he thought that it must be one of the Healers who had treated him on one of his previous visits. He’d been here often enough that he’d been treated by most of the regular Healers on this ward before. He blinked rapidly, trying to dispel the dots floating in his vision, and slowly the room coalesced into something recognisable, although he didn’t dare move his head to look around, unwilling to risk more pain.
Draco’s words hung in the air for a long minute, and then a smile slowly spread across Harry’s face, and he was moving, shifting so that he was fully facing Draco, and his face was coming closer and closer. And then Harry kissed him, the touch of his lips so light and gentle that Draco almost thought he’d dreamed it. But then Harry kissed him again, and Draco knew he wasn’t dreaming. This kiss was deeper, more intense, and Draco couldn’t help the gasp that escaped him as Harry’s mouth opened, his tongue flicking along Draco’s lips. That gasp seemed to be what Harry had been waiting for, as he moved even closer, bringing one hand up to tangle in Draco’s hair, the other snaking round Draco’s waist, pulling their bodies as close together as they could get given their awkward positions on the sofa.
Malfoy didn’t say anything for a moment, and Harry thought he was going to try and leave again. But then Malfoy spoke, taking another few steps further into the room and away from the open door.
‘What about this?’ Draco said, bringing another fabric up to them and holding it up against Harry’s chest. ‘The colour would go with my robes.’
Harry was proved right when Malfoy took a step forward, and then another, slowly closing the distance between them. He stopped just in front of Harry, so close that if Harry twitched his fingers they would brush against the fabric of Malfoy’s trousers, and stilled, looking at Harry for a long moment. Deciding that it was now or never, Harry dropped all the barriers that he usually kept wrapped around his heart and didn’t try and keep his feelings from appearing on his face. He let Malfoy look, let Malfoy see all the want and desire that Harry felt for him, let Malfoy see how much Harry had missed him while they had been apart.
. Without breaking their kiss, Harry walks them over to Draco’s bed, pushing Draco down onto the soft covers and covering Draco’s body with his own. Harry’s hot and heavy on top of him, their pricks rubbing together as Harry begins to move his hips. Draco’s been so turned on for so long that the friction is enough to make him moan, and his volume only increases when Harry moves to finger him open.
Three weeks pass this way, with Draco pretending that nothing is different and praying that time will wash away the memory of Potter inside him, all the while aching with the knowledge that he’s had as much of Potter as he’ll ever get.
And Draco doesn’t think he’s imagining the flash of disappointment on Potter’s face.
Harry had managed to make it through eleven pages when the door to his room opened and Malfoy entered. Another wave of guilt rushed through him at the relief he felt at being interrupted, even as he immediately closed the book. The guilt twisting his insides mutated into something different, however, when he looked at Malfoy properly. For the first time he wasn’t in his Healer’s robes and was instead wearing a simple dark blue shirt and smart grey trousers. Malfoy had somehow managed to pull off the rather unpleasant colour of his Healer's uniform, far better than some of the other Healers Harry had been treated by before, but now, clad in well-fitting, clearly expensive Muggle clothing… it was almost more than Harry could process.
But he didn’t get up immediately, even as his fingers curled around the edges of the armchair in preparation for pushing himself up. Harry was strangely unhappy at the thought of Malfoy leaving, but then a huge yawn escaped from him, pain lancing through his ribs at the force of it, and he knew that he probably should sleep.
But then Potter moves, as he always does, sitting up and running a hand through his hair, and shatters all of Draco’s hopes with his careless words.
‘Not much.’ Malfoy pulled a notebook out of the pocket of his robes. ‘She died a few weeks ago, of old age as far as the Healers can tell. Only family is a daughter, who inherited this house and burned her hand trying to tidy away some ornaments. St Mungo’s alerted us, once they confirmed it was curse damage, though thankfully minor.’
As they moved together, their hands still clinging tightly on to each other as pleasure built in Harry’s gut, he realised the sexual desire he’d felt for Malfoy had changed, shifting into something far more unsettling. It had become something more, something that led to him dreaming about Malfoy for hours each day, paperwork pushed aside and long forgotten as he wondered what Malfoy was doing, where he was in the office, whether they might bump into each other, an anticipation and excitement that he’d not felt in a long time. When Malfoy moaned and clenched around him, ripping Harry’s orgasm out of him with a shout, Harry was overtaken by a rush of emotion that had him dropping his forehead onto Malfoy’s shoulder as he let it wash over him, a confusing mix of pleasure, guilt, happiness, and above all, a sudden realisation that he wanted to keep this newfound intimacy.
Hot water fell all around them, cloaking them in a curtain of water, the noise drowning out the increasingly desperate sounds Harry was making as Draco continued to wreck him just with kisses. Harry had kissed his fair share of people over the years, but no one had ever kissed him like this; no one had made him feel so much through such a simple act. Draco’s hand wrapping around his throbbing cock made Harry cry out, already so close to the edge, and he nearly sobbed with relief when Draco sank to the floor and swallowed him down. It didn’t take long for Harry’s legs, already tired from the match, to start shaking as pleasure rushed through him, and Harry reached blindly for the cubicle wall, needing something to ground himself with as he lost himself in the feeling of Draco’s mouth on him.
‘You don’t get to just decide to send it back! I don’t need it, don’t want it.’ Potter is pacing around Draco’s living room, his voice echoing loudly.
As Harry was starting to pack up his things, Esther knocked on his door. When she’d first introduced herself to him, she’d reminded him forcibly of Mrs Weasley, apart from her shock of bright pink hair, which was so Tonks-like it sent a sudden pang of sadness through Harry. Along with Grace and Malfoy, Esther had taken on the bulk of his care, and she seemed to have developed quite a soft spot for him, always gently chastising him when she thought he was overextending himself with his recovery. He’d miss her, although not quite as much as he’d miss Malfoy.
‘Really?’ Malfoy’s head snapped up at that, his eyes finally meeting Harry’s again.
The slide of his cock into Malfoy was slow and blissful, the sensation different and even better than he’d imagined it would be. He had to close his eyes tightly against the sensation as his orgasm threatened to overtake him, holding still and trying to distract himself until the immediate rush of pleasure ebbed slightly. Malfoy began to move first, shifting his hips, pushing back against Harry as he started to thrust forward. As their movements picked up speed, Harry’s world narrowed to just them, and the feeling of Malfoy’s body around his cock, and the heat of his back against Harry’s chest. He leaned forward, pressing their bodies even tighter together, that distinctive Malfoy smell surrounding him, the alley filling with the sound of their groans and harsh breathing. Needing to touch more of Malfoy, Harry grabbed one of the hands Malfoy had pressed against the wall, interlocking their fingers. It was the most intimate, affectionate,
Harry sinks back into the water, letting his eyes close again. It’s blissful, floating in the warm water, and it only gets better when Draco starts to run his fingers through Harry’s hair.
‘Cheers, Hermione, for all of this,’ Harry said. ‘And you, too, Ron.’
‘Yes!’ Hermione jumped on the new subject, looking as relieved as Harry felt to have moved on from Malfoy and Ron’s suspicion. ‘We weren’t sure how long you’d be here for so we’ve brought you a selection.’
Harry watched him walk away, his heart full, anticipation for Friday already blooming. He didn’t know what this Friday with Malfoy would involve, only that it would be very different to the Fridays he’d come to cherish, but he couldn’t wait to find out.
Harry's kitchen was modern: the dark slate tiles on the floor complemented the white units, and it was fully kitted out with lots of appliances that Draco didn't recognise but which he knew were Muggle. Harry quickly busied himself with filling up the kettle, asking Draco to grab them a couple of mugs out of the cupboard he indicated. Draco did as requested but couldn’t hold back a rather undignified snort of laughter when he read the writing on the side of one of the cups he’d chosen.
Draco could only nod as he took a small step forward, closing the remaining space between them, reaching out a trembling hand to rest on Harry’s hip. Their first kiss was gentle, soft, and even better than Draco could have dreamed. They exchanged small, tentative kisses for a moment, and then Harry’s tongue swept across Draco’s lip, and Draco sighed into the touch, his hand automatically gripping Harry’s hip tighter. That drew a moan from Harry, and then suddenly they were kissing properly, deeply, passionately. Draco slid his other arm around Harry’s waist, pulling him in, a rush of pleasure shooting through Draco at the feel of Harry’s broad chest against his. Harry’s hand slid up to tangle in Draco’s hair, and he slowly walked Draco backwards, pressing him against the counter, Harry’s hips coming into contact with Draco’s for the first time. Draco couldn’t help but press up into Harry, his hips bucking automatically at the delicious pressure, his blood on fire as they continued to kiss. Things would have progressed much further, as Draco desperately wanted, if it weren’t for the sound of footsteps coming down the hallway.
One afternoon, Harry was surprised to see Oliver Wood’s face pop around his door. They passed a very entertaining few hours together discussing the matches that had been played while Harry was recuperating, and Oliver regaled Harry with stories from training. Harry laughed so much his newly healed ribs ached at Oliver’s rather dramatic reenactment of the team’s failed attempts at one of his new plays. It left him with a bone deep longing to be back with his team and to get back to training.
Malfoy seemed to be feeling the same satisfaction too, as the cold blankness that had clouded his features when they first began working had vanished, replaced by flushed cheeks and a small but definitely present smile. He’d discarded his outer robes an hour or so into their work, and had rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. When Harry glanced over at one point to see Malfoy running a hand through his hair, leaving it rumpled and dishevelled, he had to look away quickly, his stomach turning over at the sight. Harry might be married, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t still appreciate an attractive man.
‘Well, anyway, it was hell for me too, so I left. I’ve not regretted it for a second,’ Draco adds, his tone softer this time.
The Snitch was flying upwards now, drawing them higher and higher above the pitch. It was cold this high up, a fine wet mist clinging in the air, and Harry’s hands stiffened as he clenched his broom handle tightly, his knuckles pink and aching. He hoped desperately that the Snitch would change course, stop climbing higher. If his hands got much colder, he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to even reach out to grab it. Thorebourne was almost neck and neck with Harry now, and he turned his head slightly to see her flash him a wicked smile. Her face was alive with the adrenaline that Harry could feel coursing through his own veins, and it only spurred Harry on more. He didn’t want to lose this.
One idea Harry had suggested in one of his notes was a cinema trip. He said that Teddy always enjoyed watching TV at Harry’s house—evidently he’d managed to get around the issue of magic and technology—and Harry had mentioned that he’d been to the cinema once as a child and loved it. Harry hadn’t gone into any more detail, and Draco didn’t press, but he did wonder why Harry had only been once, when it seemed as though Muggles went to the cinema a lot. Harry never talked about his childhood though, and Draco didn’t ask any questions—he could quite understand having a past you weren’t too keen to talk about. Instead, Draco simply agreed that it sounded like a good idea, and suggested that Harry book them some tickets for their next trip.
Of course Harry had to go and ruin it all.
‘Please, Draco?’ Teddy continued, oblivious to the tricky situation he was putting Draco in.
‘What? Why?’ Draco was gobsmacked. That wasn’t what he had been expecting.
‘My mum was a Hufflepuff. I hope I’m one,’ Teddy replied, the reference to his mother slipping out without any hesitation. Draco had noticed that there were plenty of photos of Tonks and the odd one of Professor Lupin scattered around the house, and he wondered what exactly Teddy knew about the circumstances of his parents death. He hoped he didn’t know how much of a part Draco had played—although Draco knew he would deserve it, he didn’t want Teddy to hate him.
'Yes,' Draco blurted, his need to not leave Harry yet overpowering his normal tendency to think before speaking. 'I mean, yes, that would be nice,' he added, cursing the blush that he could feel warming his cheeks.
‘I can’t do this,’ Malfoy repeated, his eyes wide with shock, one hand coming up to gently touch his swollen lips. ‘You’re my patient, this is wrong.’
‘What about you?’ Draco asked, keen to move the topic away from him, worried he might find himself spilling all his deepest secrets to Harry. ‘What do you do that means you can spend endless hours each week taking up space in my cafe?’
‘You know you’re fit, Malfoy, I don’t know why you need to hear me say it!’ Potter bursts out, before murmuring something that sounds a little like
Harry nodded, folding a tiny patch of his bedding in on itself, over and over again, as he listened to Malfoy.
him. And on top of that, Potter had kept coming back, had told Draco things he hadn’t told anyone else, had made Draco think he could be something more than just his whore. How dare he? Why did Potter have to come and ruin Draco’s life just as he was finally happy?
‘I—I don’t know,’ Harry said, the lingering pain leaving him confused, Malfoy’s proximity only making things worse. He couldn’t look away from him. ‘What happened?’
It was just a kiss, Harry told himself afterwards, as he walked aimlessly around London, not ready to go home yet. Just a kiss, a harmless kiss that meant nothing. The first time had been to save his life, this time just a kiss to get it out of his system. He could live with that, couldn’t he?
‘I didn’t?’ Harry takes a tentative step forward, nearly closing the gap between them, and Draco’s heart leaps. Maybe sometimes taking a risk is worth it.
Both smiling slightly, they lapsed into silence, and Draco felt as though something had shifted between them, a warm bubble of contentment mixed with excitement settling in his chest.
But soon their hips are grinding together, Harry’s cock a hard line against Draco’s, and Draco needs more. He wants to have sex with Harry properly, knowing that it’s because they desperately want each other rather than because of any money or obligation. He breaks their kiss, thrilling at the moan of loss that escapes Harry.
‘Potter,’ Draco says, warning clear in his tone. He knows what Potter has just seen, and he doesn’t want to talk about it. Doesn’t want guilt and memories and darkness to come between them just as they’ve finally found something good that connects them. ‘We don’t have to do this now.’
They sit like that for long minutes, Pansy’s top growing damp with tears as Draco lets himself go. Most people never see this side of Pansy, but Draco can’t think of anyone he’d rather be with right now—she’s always known how to comfort him, take care of him. Slytherins have always had a reputation for being self-serving, for being ruthless and cold, but that has never been Draco’s experience. At Hogwarts they’d formed a little family, looking after each other when their parents were too distracted with chasing power and the rest of the world had written them off.
‘Did you know,’ Teddy continued, breezing right past Draco’s speech, far too distracted by thoughts of Hogwarts, ‘that there are ghosts there, and one of them doesn’t have a head?’
Harry cringed, knowing that he’d used exactly that argument to justify it to himself.
Harry quickly learned what Malfoy might have been implying when he had mentioned
‘We don’t think so—reports from neighbours suggest that she was having memory problems, that a lot of the time she couldn’t keep track of things, so we presume the daughter thought she could sneak things into the house and her mother would never notice them.’ Malfoy’s tone was harsh, his words dripping with disdain for the daughter’s actions, and Harry hated how much that pleased him.
As his teammates disappeared into the showers, nudging Oliver until he followed them with a reluctant look back at the trophy that he’d finally let go of, Harry sank down on the bench. He stretched his leg out in front of him, testing it, but when no pain came even after all the work he’d put it through today, he leant back against the wall, closing his eyes. Elation warred with exhaustion, as it always did after a win, and he was grateful for a moment of relative peace to try and begin to process it. The months of rehab after he’d left St Mungo’s had been worth it, however much he’d grumbled about it at the time. Every hour he’d spent stretching, every boring day he’d had to spend at home, every game he’d had to watch from the stands, had been worth it, as it let him be here for this moment.
Malfoy’s face clouded over, his easy smile vanishing as his lips turned down at the corners. ‘She’s not well. She hasn’t been since my father was sent to Azkaban.’
,’ he said, making the wand movement that became so familiar over that year. With a jolt of surprise, he felt a wisp escape from his wand, an indistinct shape but clearly
‘It isn’t. It’s old pure-blood magic, not something I’ve come across before, except in one book.’ At that Malfoy paused, his eyes worried, his mouth moving slightly as he seemed to struggle to find the words he was looking for.
‘Found anything interesting?’
Then it’s Draco’s turn, and it’s as though Potter’s confessions have unlocked his own. He’s never really talked to anyone about what it was like that year that the Dark Lord occupied the Manor, but he finds himself telling Potter about the fear that never left him during that time, about the spells he would cast on his bedroom door at night, about the way he struggled to sleep anyway, well aware that his attempts to protect himself wouldn’t help at all. He describes that terrible day when the Dark Lord had found him hiding in the library and told him exactly what he had to do if he wanted to ensure he and his parents survived the war. Potter doesn’t say much as Draco talks, just listens, occasionally nodding or making little noises of encouragement. It’s the most Draco’s ever talked about the war.
Draco looks up so quickly that his neck cracks.
‘Yeah,’ Harry confirmed after a moment. He didn’t want to tell Malfoy anything, but he was also desperate to get out of the hospital and withholding information that was clearly in his chart would only make him look petty. ‘At Hogwarts, when Lockhart Vanished my arm bones, and then a few times since after Quidditch injuries.’
‘Could you still get married here? It’s not too late. You’re not too old to get married yet,’ Harry added, a teasing edge to his voice that briefly lightened the mood.
‘Hey,’ Harry said, his voice scratchy from sleep.
The only way Harry could make it through the day was to keep reminding himself that this was temporary, just the lingering effects of the dream making him see things that weren’t really there. He’d had sex dreams before, and had never ended up fancying the people in them, so the chances of it happening this time were so tiny as to not be worth worrying about. It had just been too long since he’d been intimate with anyone, and Draco was an attractive man who he spent nearly every day with - it made sense that he would be the focus of Harry’s dream, especially now that they were pretending to go on a date together. It meant nothing more.
‘Yeah,’ Potter says. ‘Bye then, Malfoy.’
‘Excellent,’ Malfoy said flatly, avoiding Harry’s eyes and instead picking up his chart, flicking through it distractedly.
‘Well only one of us joined a pro Quidditch team after school, while the other one of us ran themselves ragged working all the hours in the day, leaving no time for exercise, let alone flying, so I think I have a pretty good idea who would win,’ Malfoy said with a wry smile.
Malfoy shot Harry a look at that, one so familiar and yet brand new in this context, and Harry felt his cock twitch. Despite his fervent hopes, the small smile on Malfoy’s face suggested he hadn’t missed Harry’s reaction.
True to his word, Malfoy returned the next morning, his robes once again pristine, not a single wrinkle to be spotted, his hair far less messy than it had been the night before. Harry had only just woken up, despite it being nearly ten o’clock, and he felt more than a little worse for wear. It had taken him ages to fall asleep after Malfoy had left, the pain from his gradually mending bones only increasing and his mind whirring as he dwelt on the half-conversation he’d had with Malfoy. He knew very little about what Malfoy had got up to in the years after the war, and he found himself wishing he’d paid more attention. It was a strange feeling, knowing so much and yet so little about Malfoy at the same time.
‘Eventually, yes. I know it might sound silly to you, but I was nervous, at first, to mingle in Muggle society. I had no idea how to act, what to say, how not to give myself away. And there was a part of me that wondered if my father hadn’t been right about us having something to fear from them—he’d told me about the weapons they use, how destructive they can be, how they wouldn’t hesitate to use them against us. I know now that that was all nonsense, of course,’ Malfoy said, when Harry opened his mouth to rebut the idea. ‘But you can understand how I would be wary, having grown up hearing that.’
Draco spent the rest of the afternoon answering Teddy’s questions about Hogwarts, deciding that he’d said enough about pure-blood culture for one day. He didn’t want to lay it on too thick, and he wanted to leave time for his message to sink in. They had plenty more lessons left to cover everything else, after all. By the time Andromeda came in to tell Teddy it was tea time, Draco was exhausted, the incessant chatter and enthusiasm of his cousin more tiring than he’d anticipated, not to mention the reminders of his own chequered history. He returned home completely drained, sinking onto his sofa with great relief, but there was a little kernel of warmth lodged in his heart as he reminded himself that he was on his way to stopping the next generation of the family making the same mistakes he had.
That first year after the war, Harry had been almost paralysed with grief and a deep weariness, and only external pressures and the ever-present support of Ron, Hermione, and the Weasleys had kept him going through funerals and award presentations and countless other events he was roped into as the
‘Really?’ Harry couldn’t help asking, totally powerless to stop the smile that was spreading across his face.
He was half-hard in his trousers by the time Malfoy joined them at the table, his movements graceful and his legs distractingly long as he weaved between the tables, never spilling a drop of his drink. Condensation was dripping off the glass and over Malfoy’s fingers, and Harry was seized by a sudden urge to lick them, to taste the cool water mixed with the taste of Malfoy’s skin. For a moment he wondered whether the curse was still active, still causing him to want Malfoy. He hadn’t felt desire like this in so long—it was like being a teenager again, reminiscent of those weeks at Hogwarts in his sixth year when he and Ginny had first got together, his mind occupied at every moment with thoughts of her. But this time, it was Malfoy he couldn’t get out of his head. He dropped his head into his hands in despair, as he willed his prick to go down and thoughts of Malfoy to go away.
‘I’m very good at taking,’ Draco says, turning to wink at Potter. Potter’s cheeks are already pink, his hair dishevelled, his glasses tossed away who knows where, but at Draco’s insinuation the flush deepens.
‘What’s going on, Harry?’ Draco said once the door was firmly shut. ‘Is everything alright?’
A noise of frustration escapes Draco, but Potter just laughs.
‘How is she?’ Draco replied absentmindedly, more focused on quickly finishing his roast beef so he could escape back to his own house as soon as possible.
Excitement began to build in Harry’s stomach once again as he thought about the party that awaited them. His friends and family, not to mention his team, would be waiting, and Harry was sure it would be an epic celebration. Harry was just glad that Draco was here to celebrate with him—after all, it was only due to his skills that Harry was even here. Draco was as responsible for this victory as Harry and the team were.
Draco sighed when they fell on Harry’s soft bed, their bodies aligning, pressing against each other in the most delicious way, sinking in to each other with every kiss, every touch. When Harry pressed inside Draco, the burst of pleasure that spread through him was nearly overwhelming, and it only increased with every movement Harry made. Draco’s magic, still so near the surface after their trip to the valley, seemed to reach out, sensing Harry’s, and as the two intertwined it sent shockwaves of bliss through Draco, Harry moaning into his mouth as he felt it too. Their magic cocooned them, wrapping them in layer upon layer of sensation and pleasure as they moved together, Harry’s eyes never leaving Draco’s. Draco didn’t know whether it was Harry, the magic in the air, or the slow build up as they’d taken their time to get to this point, but he’d never felt anything so incredible, his climax overtaking him in a rush of white hot pleasure and crackling magic.
‘All right,’ Malfoy nodded, ‘dinner then. Friday? Work pub nights have rather lost their appeal over the past few weeks,’ he added with a wry smile.
‘Surely that’s incredibly risky, bringing highly dangerous objects into the house of someone who might accidentally set them off? Who would put their mother’s life in danger like that?’
, a book Draco had read not long after he started spending more time in the Muggle world. His stomach and brain feeling all muddled, Draco returned to his sanctuary behind the counter, where he could continue his appraisal of Harry without being close enough to be even more mixed up by the smell of Harry’s aftershave. When Harry finally finished his drink - it had surely gone cold long ago - he quickly pulled on his coat and left, without even looking over towards Draco, who tried to pretend that the slight didn’t affect him at all, despite the hollowness that Harry’s departure left in the pit of his stomach.
Harry jolted awake, ripped from deep sleep by a spasm of agony. Sparks of pain were shooting up his left arm and his hip was aching deep down in the bone, the kind of ache that made it hard to remember what his hip had felt like before. The room was dark, a narrow sliver of moonlight spilling through a gap in the curtains and stretching across the thin white material of Harry’s bedding. Harry could just about hear the bustle of the hospital outside his door, but in his room it was quiet, with nothing to distract him from the pain spreading through his body. He wanted to curl in on himself, as though if he made himself as small as possible he might be able to hide from it, but even attempting to move his hip made him groan.
‘How come you decided to become a Healer?’ Harry asked. It was the question that had kept returning to him again and again ever since he got to the hospital. Harry would never have guessed that the boy he’d known at school would grow up to be a Healer, and his curiosity was piqued.
‘Harry.’ At Draco’s voice Harry finally looks up, his stomach flipping over with nerves.
‘He did always seem rather… intense about winning, when he played at Hogwarts.’
Malfoy broke the silence first, to Harry’s surprise. ‘How’s your leg feeling?’ he asked, as they passed a patient barking like a dog every time she opened her mouth.
‘Who wouldn’t think you’re attractive? They’d have to be out of their minds.’
‘Potter.’ At Malfoy’s quiet word, Harry looked away from his hand to see that Malfoy had opened his eyes and was watching Harry, his eyebrows furrowed in concern.
Malfoy hurriedly unzipped Harry’s flies, shoving his jeans and boxers down in one fluid motion, his cock springing free, the cool air a balm against Harry’s hot skin. So quickly that Harry could barely process what was happening, Malfoy dropped to his knees, wrapping one long-fingered hand around Harry’s cock as he did so. Harry couldn’t hold back a moan when Malfoy leaned in and licked a slow stripe up the underside of his cock, and he slid a hand into Malfoy’s hair, holding on tightly as the world spun around him, his eyes sliding shut.
‘You saw the paper, then?’ Harry said eventually.
Once Draco is pushing back on Harry’s fingers, taking them with ease, Harry stops. Draco’s body misses the sensation immediately.
Malfoy’s professional blankness slipped slightly at Harry’s words, his eyes flashing. ‘You should trust me because I take my job seriously,’ he snapped. ‘I took an oath to treat anyone who needs help, which, unfortunately, includes you. I will treat you and do it well, whatever my personal feelings towards you. Besides, no one will get you back on a broom as quickly as I will, believe me.’
They made their way slowly up the stairs, pausing to strip off clothes and explore newly revealed skin, the magic still lingering in Draco’s veins making everything feel heightened, more intense. Harry’s room was dark when they finally made it there, but without breaking their kiss, Harry waved a hand, the bedside lights flaring into life and suffusing the room with a soft glow.
When Potter licks a stripe up Draco’s crease, his tongue flicking over his arsehole, an unholy noise is ripped from Draco’s throat. Of all the things he thought Potter might do, that wasn’t one of them. But Merlin, it’s good.
‘It’s one of the few places left in the country where you can feel true magic. There used to be hundreds, all over the place, but as wizards were forced into hiding and Muggles began to build their cities, the magic retreated back to the safety of the ground. It still seeps out in some places, and even the Muggles can feel it sometimes, a vague feeling of ‘something is different here’ but this is one of the only places you can go and really
Harry didn’t respond for a moment and turned back to his packing to hide from the shrewd glance Esther shot his way. He hadn’t thought much before now about what it meant for Malfoy’s job that he was spending so much time with Harry. He’d been too wrapped up in enjoying the building friendship between them that he hadn’t considered what it was costing Malfoy. But of course Malfoy had other patients whom he needed to spend time treating. And yet, that hadn’t stopped him spending hours with Harry, and that thought set hope blooming in his chest. Maybe Malfoy would be as sad about Harry leaving as he was.
‘Uh- I’ll have a latte I guess,’ Harry said finally, after looking back up at the menus several more times.
And that was all Harry thought it was, a good friendship and work partnership, solidified through years of shared history. Harry saw no reason why agreeing to be Draco’s date to the ball should change any of that - he was just helping a friend out, nothing more. But then, with just two weeks to go until the ball, Harry had a dream that changed everything.
‘What?’ he said finally, just as Harry was considering fleeing the country and never returning.
‘Yeah, Teddy might have mentioned that. I—uh—well, I thought maybe I could come along? On your trips that is, to help out with the Muggle stuff.’ Harry actually looked nervous as he waited for Draco’s response, his expression losing some of its easy confidence as he nibbled on his lip.
‘How often should I do them?’ Harry asked, massaging his sore arm with his other hand in a vain attempt to relieve his muscles.
The end of the film took Draco by surprise, too wrapped up in thoughts of Harry and his hands to notice the credits begin to roll. He hadn't taken in a single frame of the film. He couldn’t have even begun to describe what it had been about. Harry seemed equally taken aback, as Teddy had to poke him in the side to make him realise it was time to leave. With a small smile and a rueful glance at Draco, Harry let go of his hand and got up, following Teddy out of the cinema. Draco brought up the rear in a daze, his hand still tingling with awareness and the ghost of Harry's touch.
‘I’m not sure that makes it any better, Potter,’ Draco sighed, finally looking up. ‘He’ll probably turn up with some young model or a famous Quidditch player as his date, and I’ll look a fool.’
They’d rolled over to face each other now, bodies curling in to each other, but there was still a gap between them. It felt wrong to touch Malfoy as he talked about his wife, even though they’d already done so much worse.
They were silent for a moment, the only noise in the room the faint sounds of the bustling hospital beyond the door. Harry waited for Malfoy to say he had to go—he was on his way home after all, after what was surely a long and busy day—but Malfoy didn’t move. His gaze darted around the room, returning back to Harry’s face again and again, before settling on the book Harry had put aside when Malfoy came in.
He’s wondered before, what it would feel like to kiss Draco, but he never thought it would set off such an intense desire in him. Any thoughts he might have had about taking this slow fly out of his mind immediately, his cock hardening as he slips his tongue into Draco’s mouth. For his part, Draco seems just as into it - his hands are everywhere, burning a trail through Harry’s Auror robes as they explore his body.
‘I’m never going to be able to look at the sofa the same way again. Let’s do it on the counter next time.’
‘I know, it’s alright,’ Draco said, kissing Harry once again to show that he wasn’t annoyed. ‘I’ll see you next weekend for the next trip out? It’s a good one—I’ve been saving this place for weeks.’
‘I can’t wait,’ Harry said, walking Draco to the door, where he proceeded to push Draco up against the wall and thoroughly scramble his brains with a breathtaking kiss. When Draco finally left Harry’s house, he Apparated home with a huge grin on his face that remained firmly in place until he finally drifted off to sleep to thoughts of Harry.
‘I had,’ Harry agreed. ‘I hated the fame—I still do. But, well, I just didn’t really know what else to do, and ever since I went to watch the World Cup before fourth year I liked the idea of flying professionally.’
‘Doesn’t matter,’ Potter says, his voice low.
‘Well
His own cock hard and aching in his trousers, Draco leans forward, towards the unmistakable line of Potter’s cock. He takes his time, giving Potter a chance to tell him to stop, but then Potter’s hand comes to tangle in Draco’s hair and his hips shift forwards slightly, bringing his cock closer to Draco’s mouth.
It all just reminded him too much of Malfoy. Every wrist exercise brought flashbacks to Malfoy demonstrating them to him, his long fingers sending sparks across Harry’s skin. Every walk around the block made Harry think of his long walks with Malfoy, losing hours to conversation and laughter. Harry had thought about Malfoy nearly constantly since he’d left the hospital. Heat bloomed in his gut every time he remembered their kiss, almost immediately followed by a sadness so intense that it left him feeling sick when he recalled the way Malfoy had rejected him afterwards. He’d really thought Malfoy wanted him, too, after the kiss, their conversations, and Esther’s comments about all the extra time Malfoy had spent with Harry. But clearly not, as Malfoy had practically run away from Harry, leaving him to finish packing and head home alone while fighting back an urge to cry.
‘Yeah, just like that,’ Potter says.
The moment finally came when Harry noticed that Teddy had fallen asleep right where he was sat, his empty plate still on his knee even as his head began to tilt forward. Quietly, Harry motioned to Draco to move, and they both got up, doing their best not to wake Teddy. Harry picked up Teddy’s plate before gesturing for Draco to follow him out of the living room. Excitement building in his stomach, Draco followed Harry into the kitchen, the only light the streetlight next to the window. Harry put down Teddy’s plate, the sound resonating in the otherwise silent room, and then turned to Draco. Draco’s heart was pounding in his chest as Harry moved closer, his intentions clear on his face. Harry came to a stop just in front of Draco, only centimetres separating them, so close that Draco could see every detail of Harry’s face in the glow of the streetlight. They stood like that, not yet touching, for a long moment. Draco soaked in every single detail, from the coolness of the tiles on his socked feet to the exact way that Harry’s hair was sticking up in the back, not wanting to forget a second of this. Just when Draco thought he couldn’t take it any longer, Harry reached out, gently cupping his face.
‘Oh, um, yeah I am, I suppose,’ Harry said, unconvincing even to his own ears. Clearly, it sounded equally untruthful to Esther, as she fixed him with an assessing look that made Harry feel like his soul was laid bare.
‘It is,’ Harry said, chuckling weakly. ‘In a good way though, I think.’
‘No,’ Draco says simply.
But Harry’s newfound feelings didn’t fade. He found himself watching Draco even more than he usually did, his eyes drawn to his hands as he wrote case notes or to the way his hair would gradually become messier and curlier as the day wore on, cataloguing all these little secret details about Draco that he’d hardly noticed before. It was making work difficult - Harry felt constantly on edge, even the most innocent action from Draco enough to make heat rush through Harry’s veins, any tiny contact they had as they handed each other case files or brushed past one another in the corridor making Harry’s nerves scream with want. Draco, thankfully, seemed completely oblivious to Harry’s inner turmoil. As the ball drew ever closer, he started badgering Harry about what he was planning to wear, wanting to know the exact colour of Harry’s dress robes, so he could make sure his didn’t clash.
Harry awoke with a shout, his heart racing. For a second, he had no idea where he was, aware of nothing but the fear rushing through his veins like ice. He’d not had a nightmare that bad in years, and the terror that had woken him clung to him even as the dark hospital room became clearer. His hands were shaking, sweat pouring down his face even as he shivered, and he pushed back the duvet that was tangled around his legs. He needed to move.
After presenting their invitations at the door, Harry and Draco walked into a large entrance hall. It was grand, with an intricately painted ceiling and gold accents everywhere, waiters standing ready to offer glasses of champagne as soon as they were past the front door, which Harry gratefully took, ignoring Draco’s look of disapproval at the speed he drank it. The hall led into a large ballroom, an orchestra already playing, the music soaring over the conversations of the guests mingling on the dancefloor. A few people were dancing already, dresses sweeping the floor as they twirled. The room had been decorated for Christmas, and flakes of enchanted snow, charmed to never melt and not be cold, drifted down from the ceiling, settling on the shoulders of Harry’s robes, lingering for several seconds before disappearing without a trace. It was beautiful, and almost unbearably romantic.
Ginny didn’t look impressed by Harry’s explanation, her eyebrows raised and disbelief etched across her face. ‘You expect me to believe that you fucked Malfoy because of a curse?’
‘Ah, that rules me out then I suppose.’
Fury was radiating off her in waves, and Harry took an automatic step back as she continued to shout. He’d known he was wrapped up in Malfoy, that Malfoy could hold his attention like no one else, but he couldn’t believe he’d been so distracted that he hadn’t noticed his own wife in the alley with them.
‘Yeah, ok, right.’ Harry had never seen Malfoy so off his game before. Malfoy was usually so in control, cool and collected, but now he seemed flustered, lost for words. ‘All right, how do you want to do this?’
Draco’s anger is coiled in his stomach, ready to explode, and he hates that once again Potter has got a reaction out of him. Whether they’re fucking or fighting Potter always gets the better of him, and he can’t bear that. He wants to win, just once. And if winning means he never sees Potter again, that he loses the one man he’s truly wanted, well. So be it.
.’ Malfoy looked like he was trying and failing to stop himself laughing. ‘And if it doesn’t work? Well, then we try something else.’
‘Yeah?’
All of a sudden, the pain receded, reducing to a burn under his skin rather than outright agony. Harry looked up, confused, and found himself looking directly into Malfoy’s grey eyes. Malfoy’s hand was on Harry’s arm, and the touch felt like a balm, the place where their skin met the only part of his body that didn’t hurt.
‘The Ministry Yule Ball invitations have arrived,’ Draco said, dropping his and burying his head in his hands.
‘Close your eyes,’ Draco instructed, which Teddy immediately did. ‘Now try and focus on your feet, and on your skin. Do you feel anything? If you’re quiet, and patient, the magic will come and find you. It knows that you’re magic too.’
For a while, Harry kept the anxiety at bay by practicing Quidditch plays in his mind. Before the season started Oliver had made them spend several long, tiring days ensconced in one of the training rooms at the club while he talked them through every single play he wanted them to use over the season. The room, which they usually used for stretching and lifting dumbbells, had been transformed, all the mats Vanished and replaced with rows of chairs. At first glance, they looked comfortable, but by the end of the third day Harry’s body had been protesting so much time spent sitting down not moving. Harry knew Oliver was just trying to look out for them all and set them up for success, though, so he’d only made one jokey comment when Oliver had handed them each a folder full of wriggling diagrams and mock scenarios for each play. He’d glanced at it a few times since then, flipping through to find the ones which were relevant to him, and he occupied himself for a while trying to remember them all now. He had nothing else to do, after all, and it was as close as he was going to get to actually training for the next few weeks at least. He made a mental note to ask Ron to bring him the folder next time he came in to visit if it looked like Harry was going to be here for much longer.
After several weeks of stilted conversation followed by feigned ignorance of each other’s existence, everything changed. It was late, nearly closing time, and all Draco’s other customers had left, heading home to families or out to meet friends for dinner. Draco had given up on seeing Harry that day - he never came this late, and only someone who desperately wanted to spend all night wide awake would risk drinking coffee at this time of day. Draco was finishing wiping down the counter and the machines, preparing to leave for the day, when Harry surprised him by pushing open the door, a harried expression on his face.
that Draco took him in fully, pulling out all his best moves in an attempt to drive Harry mad. Soon Harry was moaning loudly, his hand tight in Draco’s hair as he moved up and down. It was the best feeling Draco had ever experienced.
‘I can hear you thinking from over here,’ Malfoy said, his eyes still closed, his hair a mess.
,’ Harry murmured as they pulled apart, resting his forehead on Draco’s for a moment as Draco tried to compose himself. ‘I’ll go sort Teddy out, get him into bed. Will you wait?’ Harry looked uncertain, for reasons Draco couldn’t understand.
Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough for Draco, too impatient to see Teddy again. Now that he had the idea for the trips, Draco suddenly felt energised and excited about the lessons, and he was looking forward to actually doing something fun with Teddy. Work had been fairly quiet for once, and he’d actually managed to leave at a reasonable hour most days, something he didn’t usually manage. He spent every evening poring over the books he’d borrowed from the Manor, searching for details of historically important magical locations, excitement building in his stomach with each location he added to the list. He loved the idea of taking Teddy back to where it all began, before it got twisted and warped and became about being superior to everyone else. He just wanted to show Teddy why everyone loved magic so much, why it deserved protecting. He hoped that by combining it with trips into the Muggle world, Teddy would see the best of both worlds, and understand how both traditional wizarding culture and Muggle culture had something to offer. Teddy was a Half-blood, after all, and should know about both sides of his heritage.
Harry’s guilt wasn’t enough to stop him hurtling towards his orgasm far quicker than he expected. Malfoy’s tongue was doing sinful things to his cock, and Harry couldn’t resist looking down to watch Malfoy stroke himself off, the tip of his prick poking through his fist with every stroke. He was nearly at the point of no return when he suddenly remembered why they were doing this.
For a while, they sat quietly, talking occasionally, as Harry slowly ate his cake, the sugar chasing away the final tendrils of dread from his nightmare. Malfoy started talking to Harry about the hospital, about the things he’d seen here, the cases he’d treated. He got more and more animated as he talked, any tiredness from the late hour disappearing, his love of his profession shining through. Harry couldn’t think of a job he’d personally be less suited for—he definitely didn’t have a strong enough stomach for it, to judge by how he felt as he listened to Malfoy describe some of the more unusual and unpleasant ailments he’d had to cure. Quidditch was a much better fit for Harry, but Healing seemed perfect for Malfoy.
And then Potter’s pulling out, leaving Draco gasping and empty.
‘I’d love that,’ Harry beamed.
His second week at home, Harry attended his first training session, although only as a spectator. Oliver wanted him to start feeling like part of the team again, and watching the others train, seeing what plays they were practicing and where they were having issues, was part of that. Harry’s appearance at the grounds had been greeted by a huge cheer and plenty of hugs from his teammates, and that combined with watching them fly had excitement building inside him at the thought of being up there with them again soon.
. It was hard, watching young Draco hanging off every word that his father spoke, soaking up the prejudice that had seemed so acceptable at the time. Draco wanted to reach through the memory and grab himself, tell him that this was all wrong, that he shouldn’t listen, that he didn’t have to live like this.
Harry shook his head, too shocked that Malfoy was bringing up something even tangentially connected to the incident to speak.
Over the next several hours, they worked through the kitchen, the dining room, and the back room, which Malfoy had been correct in saying contained the most dark magic. It was hard work, and Harry’s wand arm was shaking from the intensity of the magic he had continuously been channelling through it for hours, but it was also immensely satisfying to see the coloured threads of the detection charms gradually shift as they removed piece after piece of dark magic from the house.
‘So,’ Draco says, taking another step closer to Potter. ‘What brings the Saviour to a whore in Paris?’
‘That’s part of why I came here,’ Malfoy said. ‘I needed to explain—Astoria and I, we have an agreement, I suppose you could call it.’
‘Any time,’ Draco says, thankful that his tone sounds as casual and disinterested as possible.
With his cock free, Harry starts to gently stroke himself, keeping his touch light so he doesn’t run the risk of coming, but still enough to relieve a bit of the need that’s driving him mad. He keeps sucking Draco off, savouring the way that Draco’s thighs are starting to shake under Harry’s hands, greedily devouring every sign that Draco is starting to fall apart above him. Draco’s hand is clenching and releasing in Harry’s hair, his other fingers scrambling for purchase on the brick wall behind him. Harry’s knees are starting to protest at the hard ground underneath but he can’t bring himself to care, not when Draco is making those sounds.
Malfoy tipped over the edge first, his hips stuttering, losing their rhythm, as he shuddered against Harry. The knowledge that Malfoy was coming, spilling inside his fancy trousers because of Harry, was too much for Harry, and he followed suit, coming to sound of Malfoy groaning his name. He collapsed back against the wall, eyes closed, shivers of pleasure rushing over his skin, his brain unable to process the complicated mix of pleasure and lingering lust and guilt he felt. He could hear Malfoy straightening his clothes, felt the magic in the air as he cast a cleaning charm on himself, but Harry kept his eyes closed, too scared to open them and see Malfoy. If he kept his eyes closed, he could avoid facing this for just a little bit longer.
‘You’d be a great Hufflepuff, they’d be lucky to have you,’ Draco said sincerely.
Harry practically floated home, the grin that had spread across his face as soon as he took to the air still firmly in place. Despite the lingering aches, his body felt better than he’d expected, and he was filled with hope that he would soon be match fit. High on adrenaline and excitement, Harry chucked his kit in the corner as soon as he got home and rushed to find a piece of parchment. He’d nearly written to Malfoy on multiple occasions since he left hospital, always changing his mind at the last minute, but today he was too happy and hopeful to listen to the little voice in his mind that pointed out all the reasons not to do this. He wanted Malfoy to know that his efforts in the hospital had paid off, that Harry was flying again. That Harry was still thinking about him.
Teddy had picked out a film for them to watch, another cartoon, one that he and Harry had apparently already watched multiple times, to judge by their comments as the film started. Draco tried to follow along with both the film and Teddy and Harry’s chatter, but it was incredibly hard to do so when Harry’s thigh was pressing against his own, the warmth of Harry’s body and the feel of his muscled leg unbearably distracting. Draco could smell that distinctly ‘Harry’ smell, and everytime Harry shifted positions all his nerve endings set alight once again at the sensation. It only got worse when Teddy and Harry began opening the packets of sweets, Draco’s thoughts taking a distinctly impure turn as he watched Harry swallow as he ate his way through a bag of Skittles. The cheeky smile on Harry’s face when he turned to look at Draco made him think Harry knew exactly what he was doing, and that thought only made Draco’s need increase.
Harry had been here before with Healers and was used to them trying to avoid putting a timeline on his recovery for fear of disappointing him, on the off chance he didn’t recover as quickly as expected. But this was Malfoy, so Harry couldn’t resist pushing.
‘After the war-’ Draco began hesitantly, worried that mentioning the war would bring the truce they’d seemingly established crashing back down on him. ‘After the war, I was, well, a bit lost. You know of course that I didn’t go to Azkaban-’ Harry nodded at this tacit acknowledgement of the part he had played in Draco’s trial. ‘But of course Father did - rightly I must add - and we had to pay a lot of reparations.
The wave of guilt that always accompanied Harry when he returned home from his Friday nights with Draco rolled through him as usual when he appeared in his front garden. Conscious that he was even later getting home than normal, he cringed at the loud gravel under his feet as he walked up the path, and tried his best to open the door silently. Waking Ginny up as he snuck into bed, the fingerprints of another man still lingering on his skin, would only make him feel like even more of a dick.
‘He seems excited today,’ Harry noted, shifting on the sofa so that he could face Draco properly. ‘The trips out seem to be working then?’
‘Not really,’ Malfoy said, gesturing for Harry to follow him into the cottage. ‘Astoria and I are due to go for drinks with Pansy and Theo.’
‘What are you doing?’ Harry whispered, confused after being jolted from his contemplation of the feel of Draco’s knuckles.
‘I’m not sure. I went out to send my Patronus, and then you—you screamed, and then I saw you on the floor.’ Harry realised with a jolt that Malfoy looked terrified, his eyes wide with shock and fear. ‘None of the usual spells did anything, and Merlin, you wouldn’t stop screaming. I was going to Apparate us to St Mungo’s, but as soon as I touched you, you stopped screaming.’
They ended up in the middle of the dancefloor, surrounded on all sides by couples dancing to the music. Harry’s heart went into overdrive as he realised that he would have to hold Draco and dance close together like them. Draco took the lead, placing a hand on Harry’s waist and moving them into a dancing hold, the spots where they were in contact with each other burning with awareness. Harry let Draco guide them, trying to keep up with the steps even while his brain was completely distracted by their proximity. He was just about surviving, and had only stood on Draco’s feet two or three times, but then the music changed, slowing down. In turn, their movements slowed, Draco pulling Harry closer seemingly on a reflex, until their chests were nearly touching. Harry had never been so aware of such a small amount of space.
‘It should be, Ogden charged me a fortune,’ Draco said, sinking further back into the cushions. ‘He always rips me off whenever I go in there.’
As Draco lay in bed that night, tossing and turning and failing to fall asleep, guilt curdled in his stomach. How could he teach Teddy all the lies he was brainwashed into believing as a child? Teddy was such a sweet, open, loving child. He shouldn’t have hate poured into his veins, hate that would warp him, damage him, make him do things he’d regret. Draco couldn’t be a part of that. After the war he’d made a promise to himself to make sure that things got
‘It’s Paris, Potter. What’s not to like?’
Draco does as he’s told and then waits for Potter’s next instruction. He wants to see how far Potter is going to take this, how much control he’s capable of wielding. That’s not to say Draco will let him get away with anything—Draco’s always been the type to push the limits—but he knows he’ll do more for Potter than he would for anyone else.
Draco’s gaze moves up to Potter’s face and catalogues every mark and freckle, every line of the scar that descends across the right side of his forehead and cuts through his eyebrow. It’s beyond strange, to see Potter like this, so relaxed and at ease. He never looks like this in the photos in the paper.
? ‘The right person would be someone who I can talk to, who isn’t boring, who knows me and my life and the magical world. And someone disgustingly attractive too of course.’
Ron came to see Harry before he could go and see him, appearing through the Floo one evening several weeks after he had moved into Grimmauld Place, nearly giving Harry a heart attack with his sudden arrival. Harry had been feeling guilty about avoiding Ron, had known he should have gone to see him straight away, but he had been afraid to. Ron had always been protective of Ginny, and still distrusted Malfoy, and Harry knew Ron wouldn’t have been happy to hear that Harry had cheated on his sister with a man he hated.
Although he knew he should go home and see Ginny, tell her everything, confess and hope she was a better person than he was and could forgive him, Harry instead sank down onto the bed, dropping his head into his hands. He sat there for a long time, not moving, unable to face seeing Ginny but unsure what else to do, his mind a whirlwind as he tried to come to terms with what had just happened. He’d never expected to be the type of man who cheated on his wife, but he had, and he would have to live with that for the rest of his life.
‘Yes, after a while. I’d spent quite a lot of time in Muggle cafes, after the war, just discovering what Muggles were really like, and I always enjoyed being in them. It took some time for me to find the right thing, and the right place, but then I came here, and, well. It all fell into place.’
love it, I’ll have my tea in it thanks.’ Draco laughed, handing it to Harry along with a rather more boring Chudley Cannons mug for his drink.
Harry nodded, but as soon as Malfoy removed his hand, the pain crested again, and with a garbled yell, Harry lunged, grabbing on to the first part of Malfoy he could reach. Once again, as his hands gripped the fabric of Malfoy’s trousers, the pain became manageable, still present but not unbearable like it had been when Malfoy had let go of him.
Potter starts to swear as he gets nearer his climax, biting down on Draco’s shoulder just enough to send a frisson of pleasure-pain through him, and Draco is so close to coming.
‘So what did you do then? With all that extra time you had with your patient?’
‘Well, yes, I did. But that doesn’t mean the people I want to find me attractive do.’
‘Did you think he lived here or something? He’s dedicated to his job, but not
‘It’s amazing, really,’ Harry said, the sincerity in his voice making Draco’s heart ache.
‘Shut up, Potter,’ Draco replies, unable to keep his voice from giving away just how affected he is.
Harry had been so relieved to be out of pain that he hadn’t really considered that it was perhaps worse that he felt alright. A curse that left you writhing in pain was one that could be identified and dealt with, even if it wasn’t the most pleasant experience. A curse that left no obvious effects was more concerning. Who knew what was happening inside their bodies, their brains, their magical cores now.
Pulling to a stop, Harry looked down at the crowd in awe. An endless sea of Puddlemere flags waved back at him, his name ringing around the stadium as the crowd chanted. It was almost more than he could take in, and he shook his head in disbelief as he tried to commit the sight to memory. He’d known that they’d stood a good chance of winning the match, and at the start of the season he’d really believed Oliver when he’d said that this could be their year, but after his injury a tiny seed of doubt had been sown. Even though he’d played, and won, several matches since returning to the pitch, a small part of him had wondered if he’d be able to come through when it really mattered. But he had, and now he was part of a League-winning squad.
While Harry went upstairs to put Teddy to bed, Draco wandered back into the living room. He’d had a quick glance around before they started to watch the film, but Harry’s closeness had soon distracted him from his surroundings, so it was with great interest that he looked around the room. It was somehow just very
Once they were out onto the street, Draco pulled Teddy to one side, getting them out of the way of the crowds as much as possible, and began pointing out landmarks as they walked. He showed Teddy the Houses of Parliament, comparing it to the Ministry of Magic, just as busy making decisions and passing laws. Teddy was very impressed by Big Ben, proclaiming it the biggest clock he’d ever seen, and wondering if it would be possible to add hands to it for all his family, just like Mrs Weasley’s clock. Draco gestured to all the people walking around them, speaking countless different languages and gazing around at the sights with the same wide-eyed look of interest that was on Teddy’s own face, and told Teddy about how people loved to come and see this famous place, where laws were made that were supposed to—at least in theory—make life better for everyone. Draco described how the Muggles elected their own leaders and how that was different to the way the Ministry worked; careful to make sure that he explained it in a way that would make sense to Teddy and present him a balanced view of both systems. He made a mental note to take Teddy to the Ministry on one of their next trips.
wasn’t, but her daughter was. That’s why she hid the objects at her mother’s house, because she knew her house was at risk of being searched. The Aurors have a file on her, have been investigating her on and off for several years, and they were very interested in what we’d found. They’ve taken over the case now, and hope to finally prosecute her.’
‘Try again,’ Harry said, and the encouragement and affection in his voice stopped the embarrassment that was starting to creep through Draco in its tracks.
‘Wait,’ he called, and when Malfoy stopped walking to the door, Harry scrambled to think of something to ask him. ‘Um, what happened with the match?’ Ron had already told him, of course, but it was all Harry’s panicked brain could think of to ask about.
‘Me too,’ Draco laughed.
Draco’s hand tangled in Harry’s hair as Harry opened his mouth wide, taking Draco’s cock down as far as it would go before pulling off and repeating the action. Harry slipped one of his hands under Draco’s shirt, feeling the hot skin and muscle hidden there as he began to suck Draco’s cock in earnest. His other hand wrapped around the base of Draco’s cock, his mouth meeting it again and again as he did his best to drive Draco mad. Judging by the way Draco’s hand was rhythmically clenching in Harry’s hair, and the way his hips were moving to meet Harry’s mouth with tiny thrusts, it was working. Draco’s moans and pants filled the air, and Harry revelled in it.
‘Fuck, yes.’ Potter turns his head to face Draco, and the open, relaxed expression on his face makes Draco’s chest ache.
‘All you have to do is ask.’ Draco shifts so that he can open his legs, gratified by the way Potter’s eyes darken. He still has his trousers on, but the bulge of his cock is obvious, and he can only imagine what he must look like to Potter.
‘Really? Already?’ Harry was surprised. Malfoy had said he was good, and that he’d get Harry back moving as soon as possible, but this was even faster than Harry had expected.
‘Of course it did,’ Ginny said with a harsh, mirthless laugh.
‘Well this whore doesn’t want your guilt money,’ Draco says, whirling round to face Potter properly. He’s momentarily grateful for the few inches of height he has on Potter, even if Potter is far broader than he is. It makes them feel equal, just for a moment.
‘Was everything okay with that patient you had to go and help?’ Harry said, adjusting himself so that he was facing Malfoy. He looked tired, Harry thought, drained.
‘Then what?’ Pansy prods when Draco falls silent.
Hurriedly, Harry pulled out the chair opposite Ginny and sat, wanting to get his explanation out before she started shouting, or crying.
‘Nothing at all?’
‘Not anymore,’ Harry said cagily, sipping his coffee rather than elaborating. Draco just watched him expectantly, waiting for Harry to say more, but when he didn’t, Draco spoke instead.
Of all the things Draco expected to see when he walked back to the counter after taking a quick break in the back room, Harry Bloody Potter standing in the middle of his cafe was not one of them.
‘What about your friends? Wouldn’t they play Quidditch with you?’ Harry asked. Malfoy hadn’t talked much about his friends, or specific boyfriends, and Harry was desperately curious. There hadn’t been much in the papers about Malfoy for the first few years after the war, which Harry now knew was due to him being in France, but not long after Malfoy had got the job at St Mungo’s there had been a year or so where public interest in him had been high, and photos of him had regularly appeared in the papers. Some of them had just been Malfoy leaving St Mungo’s, but others had featured Parkinson and Zabini too, or occasionally unidentified men who were clearly on intimate terms with Malfoy judging by the way they touched each other. But as Malfoy slowly proved himself to be capable at his job and not secretly plotting anything, public interest waned, and the photos stopped. Harry had no idea who he spent time with anymore, but he wanted to know. He wanted to know everything about Malfoy, and that scared him more than a little.
A knock on the door has him turning away from the street, leaving the crowds to their evening, his mind turning back to his. A quick check of the clock above the fireplace confirms that it’s just gone 9pm. He says nothing, wanting to see if his client is waiting to be invited in, or whether they’ll just come in anyway. It’s something he always likes to do—he finds it tells him a lot about a person. Over the years he’s developed these little ways of reading people. It’s one of the things that makes him so good at what he does—that and his impeccable oral skills, of course.
They lingered in the valley for hours, Harry casting spell after spell, beaming at the way they were all so much stronger than usual, Teddy shouting requests for different spells he wanted to see. Draco mostly sat, cradled in the grass, watching, laughing, soaking up the magic that surrounded them, luxuriating in the sensation. He couldn’t stop watching Harry, the crackle of his magic, already so naturally strong, amplified by the waves of magic around them, washing over Draco’s skin and making him want, and ache, and burn. It was so much more than that though, more than just desire, more than just a physical need. Draco knew Harry was feeling it too, his looks increasingly heated, each glance sending a shooting star of pleasure up Draco’s spine with the promises they contained. Part of Draco wanted to grab Harry and Disapparate there and then, to take him home and let the tension building between them explode, and part of him was content to wait, each minute deliciously increasing the anticipation.
And then he adds, ‘Worth every Galleon.’
‘Maybe,’ Draco chuckled, heaving himself out of the soft cushions and going into the back room to retrieve his firewhiskey and two glasses.
happy?’ Harry hadn’t missed Malfoy’s use of the past tense.
, and the subtle dominance in his words sends a shiver of lust through Draco.
His eyes had fallen shut as he came, so he felt rather than saw Malfoy swallow and then release him, heard the creaks of floorboards as Malfoy stood, felt the crackle of magic in the air and across his skin as Malfoy cast cleaning charms over them and the floor. The sensation of Malfoy’s magic on his skin only added to the pleasurable aftershocks still running through Harry, the particular tenor of Malfoy’s magic familiar now from their afternoon of working together. He thought that he’d be able to recognise it anywhere now, its tones and colours etched into Harry’s skin.
‘Impressive,’ Harry murmured, smiling at Malfoy, whose mouth twitched up at the corners in response.
Harry moans when Draco’s hand closes around his cock, his hips automatically lifting to meet Draco’s slow strokes. He can’t take his eyes off them, off Draco’s long pale fingers wrapped tightly around Harry’s flushed cock, and the feeling is incredible. Over the years Draco’s learnt exactly what Harry likes, and he’s merciless tonight, stroking Harry until he’s breathless and on right on the verge of orgasm.
And Harry ran out of the pub, not caring that he’d left his coat behind, the sound of Malfoy calling his name as he left ringing in his ears, his lips still tingling from the feeling of Malfoy’s touch.
‘Nah, it’ll still go down in history as one of the best chases,’ Ron reassured him. ‘The commentators were going crazy, couldn’t stop talking about you, even after Thorebourne actually caught the Snitch.’
‘What?’
‘I know. And that’s why she got in touch. She’s worried about you.’
‘Where are we going?’
And then the room became a whirlwind of activity, Harry standing stock still in the middle as Draco and Milllie debated colours and cloth and cuts. Harry let them talk, recognising that this was by no means his area of expertise, his mind wandering as they began to discuss the differences between two seemingly identical colours. It was strange, really, Harry thought, how comfortable he felt standing there, with two Slytherins discussing how best to show off his trim Auror figure to most annoy Draco Malfoy’s ex boyfriend, of all people. Before today, he had never even set foot in a tailor’s, but he was actually quite enjoying himself, and found himself soaking up the different terms they used, learning more about the world that Draco and Millie were so clearly comfortable in. He was starting to understand why Draco was always so happy the day after he had been to see Millie for a new suit.
‘There’s a chance we might be called to testify against her,’ Malfoy sighed. ‘To explain what we found.’
‘How should I know? Do I look like I know a lot about sex curses?’ Malfoy said in a much more familiar sarcastic tone, one eyebrow raised.
stitched above the crossed wand and bone embroidered on her robes, marking her out as a Trainee Healer. Harry had a vague feeling she was the one he’d heard Malfoy talking to that first day, when he’d been half asleep. As Harry struggled to prop himself up slightly higher on his pillows, Malfoy gestured at her, and she took a step closer to the bed. She glanced quickly at Malfoy, and at his nod, she turned to Harry.
, you want.’
Draco didn’t see Narcissa again until their next weekly Sunday dinner—work really had become busy, the Aurors requiring a consult on a case that had seen him working more overtime than he had in years. He loved his job, had found meaning there that he had never expected to find in his life, but sometimes becoming an expert in a niche topic seemed to have been a terrible decision. He adored researching potions, discovering how to refine previously clunky recipes and eliminate side-effects, and found a particular pleasure in identifying ways to improve detection of unusual potions and even specific ingredients. Sometimes though, he wished he was slightly less devoted to his job—particularly on weeks where the Aurors decided he was absolutely the
Potter stills, hips twitching as he spills inside Draco, his long low groan rumbling through Draco’s chest. He stays there for a moment, his arms trembling as he holds himself up, and then he flops onto the bed next to Draco, close enough that their arms touch.
‘Sleep well, Potter,’ Malfoy replied quietly, a look in his eyes that Harry couldn’t quite decipher.
‘Is this okay?’ Harry whispered, his voice low and quiet.
‘So,’ Malfoy said when he finished telling Harry stories from his job. He fixed Harry with an intent look. ‘Do you want to talk about it?’
Silence fell between them, Malfoy turning to look out at the night beyond the window, Harry continuing to watch him. This Malfoy was so different in so many ways, and Harry almost ached with the desire to know more, to keep talking until he knew every facet of Malfoy, everything he thought, how he lived his life, what he did when he wasn’t working. Malfoy’s hand was resting on the arm of his chair, so close to where Harry’s hand also rested, and Harry’s fingers itched to reach out and touch Malfoy, to see if he felt like he had in his dream.
It got to the point where Harry was so invested in the trips that he began to send Draco owls with suggestions of places to go. The first time Draco received one he nearly fainted in shock when he unravelled the parchment to find a short note in Harry’s messy handwriting that simply read:
He knew he should have gone home straight after work, should have declined when Robertson popped his head around Harry’s office door to tell him it was pub time, and yet he wasn’t strong enough to say no, even as every rational part of his brain told him that drinking around Malfoy, in the place where they’d kissed the week before, was a terrible idea. But that wasn’t enough to stop Harry, and before long he was ensconced at their usual table in the pub, his second pint sat in front of him, his eyes trained on Malfoy where he stood at the bar.
