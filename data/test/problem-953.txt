By the end of the whole ordeal, his heart is so full of love that he's sure he'll burst if he doesn't go capture Draco right this second -
And who is Harry to deny his greatest friend of something? Even if that friend is currently trying to lead Harry away to his death. It's his hero complex, he concludes and resolves to fix the dastardly issue someday.
Harry glances at Malfoy and he can't stop his smile from widening. "Draco's flowers are the best, Mum, I know you would've loved to question him about his garden."
"Set your stuff on the table and sit in the chair, I'll be out in a moment."
"My dearest Harry, you've come back to me." Malfoy closes the leather bound journal with a slight snap -
Malfoy nods respectfully, gliding across the floor towards him and Harry tries not to suck in a sharp breath as the scents of sweetened almonds attack him. Was that some sort of cologne? Surely Malfoy doesn't smell like this
Draco, instead of looking nervous and scared for his life - as he should be - Draco smirks, a slow-blooming thing that sets beautiful fire to the base of Harry's stomach. He looks up through his those translucent lashes and chuckles, and Harry just...
Waking up and smelling the lilies has been worth it, he thinks. Perhaps the best part of his year.
And now, it seems, is no exception. "Look, Lav - I'm fine, really. I already said I don't want to go anywhere near -"
The bench reminds Harry of the outside, painted a tiresome pale green -
7,878
He settles for eavesdropping on Draco's conversation with the young girl in front of him instead. Less scarring and damaging of his brain tissue that way. The girl is pretty; definitely, the type he would have gone for back in Hogwarts while he was still forcing himself to
No, Harry concludes, one cannot.
And with a slender grin, she opens the door, allowing the cool blast of air outside to come in and practically freeze off Harry's non-existent tits.
The end :D
Their knees bump against each other, chests falling and rising and grazing and pulling apart. And suddenly the world very much seems to shrink to accommodate only two wizards on all of the Earth. Draco leans in, and Harry notices for the first time how he seems to have grown into that nose that had seemed all too pointy at Hogwarts. Now the softly rounded flesh pushes against Harry's jawline, running across the stubble that dots it.
"Right, right, I do apologise. I think they'll be looking for some poinsettias then. Those are known as these 'Christmas flowers' you speak of."

Draco looks over his shoulder and smiles, a radiating thing of sunshine and sunflowers. "No,
So he decides to take a wander.
Wow, that was deep. Anyway, Harry huffs out a tired sigh and blinks at Malfoy's new expression.
Harry didn't know that. Yes, he knew Hermione was a publisher, but he didn't know that she published Malfoy. Oh.
He does as he's told, and as he sits in the chair, he can't help but feel as though he's heard that voice before. His leg jiggles a bit, betraying his nerves. There's a door on his left, which is really more of an archway covered in those dangling crystals that don't do much to hide the view on the other side. If Harry leans out of his chair a bit... he catches glimpses of white-blonde hair streaked in colors and a rounded arse.
Malfoy frowns, a little downward pull of the corner of his lips that makes Harry sorry he even asked. Malfoy steps forward and brings with him the scent of fresh lavender coated in almond milk. It's unusually sexy, and Harry tries not to let his instant arousal show. The amount of times he'd casually wanked off to the man right in front of him makes him almost blush, but he reigns himself in.
He purses his lips. "But Andromeda doesn't have any freckles." Somewhere in the fog of confusion, curiosity and - okay, he admits it - arousal, he swears he remembers Draco making fun of Ron's own face of constellations.
"Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, seems cute. How much is it?"
Harry is sure that he once upon a time he could use his tongue and mouth to form something called worfs, or aords, or something of the sort, but with the way that Malfoy's shirt has risen up slightly to expose the pale expanse of his soft, lean stomach, Harry realises that today will be a monumental day.
The blonde's ministrations almost slow, but he keeps going regardless. "What would you do if I said no?"
That doesn't matter. What matters is the garden that surrounds the house. The bright, lovely, absolutely brilliantly smelling garden that Harry pilfers from every time he comes round.
"I want - shit, I need -" Harry watches curiously as a thick flush, much like the one earlier today, ghosts underneath Draco's skin, before he leans down to lick a long stripe up a pulsing vein on his Draco's dick. "Oh, Daddy! I need you to, to fuck me."
"Merlin," Malfoy hisses, holding tight onto Harry as his orgasm rips through him, his face melting into an expression of pure pleasure. Harry rubs his thumb against Malfoy's slit and grins when Malfoy takes the slight jolt of pain from the sensitivity. He keeps doing it, watching the blonde squirm between intense discomfort and intense pleasure. Finally, he lets go, and Malfoy jolts in his arms, moaning softly.
They just look so damn happy, and if he's being honest, Harry wants to hang this up more than he wants to chuck the hammer out the window - he won't be bested by an inanimate screw.
Just because Harry quit Auror training 3 weeks in after having a panic attack during their first exam. Honestly, you flake one time and suddenly your best friend thinks you're no longer qualified to be the hero of the goddamn Wizarding World.
invades his personal space. Merlin, he feels so soft.
Who in Godric's name says '
"I said," Draco presses his chest into Harry's back, his hips and half-hard member pressed into the curves of Harry's arse,"tell me your kinks, Harry."
Harry groans, trying to find support on his husband's shoulder. (He loves how that sounds - his
"Right, sorry. I'm a potion's analyst, as you know. Or, I mean, you don't have to know. It would be weird if you didn't, actually, as Rita Skeeter has a field day questioning my qualifications in
Malfoy has grown his hair longer - Harry wants to ask if the bastard is
Ron quirks his lips. "Don't worry, it'll be the bloody best thing you've ever done."
The world hates him.
Harry's feet don't like him - they carry him to unexpected places.
Harry thinks.
Because Harry is a potion's analyst, and so that's the easiest lie he has to use right now. Plus, he's sort of drunk on the sight of beautiful Malfoy.
He's not ready for the quick rush of relief as cold air brushes over his aching dick that springs up to slap at his stomach, and most certainly not really for - wait...
Harry forces himself to look at Ron. "Sorry, what?"
Above him Draco seems to be having fun, writhing and rolling his hips, trying to thrust into the clenched fists wrapped around his member. Harry uses the pearly liquid sliding down Draco's prick to make it easier for him to start a slow pump that makes the blonde squirm and gasp out loudly. Draco's other hands reaches down to tangle in the coarse locks of Harry's curls.
"Harry, look at me. And for Merlin's sake come closer."
See, here is where Harry sort of starts to skirt the edge of the legal limit. Along a street in Godric's Hollow, there's this house. And the house is rather large and white, sort of obnoxious in the light of everyone else's house, but whatever.
It has to be - who else would just be standing there, watching him? Other than the little girl, but she's tiny, and certainly not 6-foot-something and a wall of hard muscle.
"You also look...um..." Shit, what does one say to someone one kind of wants to bang on a bed of roses?
Malfoy gives him a long glance from the side of his eyes. "I'm an author, Potter, you know that. I write novels for a living, and Hermione is my publisher. Do keep up."
It's all rather unnerving.
With his nosy husband gone, Harry quickly sticks the picture to the wall with a charm and Vanishes the hammer.
Harry hates himself, but he still kneels in front of his mother's grave and places the flowers on the soft earth. He glances over his shoulder at Malfoy and lets slip a tiny, mangled smile.
Harry decides he'll take his time looking around, and if Malfoy just happens to turn around - well, who is Harry to deny fate? And also the fact that Draco's arse doesn't look half bad in chinos contributes to the whole cause.
Draco hands one of the large flowers to the girl, and the edges of his own lips quirk up. Harry's staring, he knows this, but he can't help himself. I mean, really, can one see such a fine specimen as Draco Malfoy and not stare at him?
The girl hands Draco a few sickles and traipses back to the front door. She pauses a bit, her own small, gloved hand placed on the brass handle.
This new revelation leaves Harry with a bitter taste in his mouth, and he shakes his head, trying to rid his tongue of the bitterness.
He quickly steps away from Malfoy - the git has the audacity to be smiling slightly - and is halfway out the door when that lavender voice is drawing him back.
Harry closes his hanging jaw and wipes at the drool threatening to spill onto his chin. "Uh,
want to think, thank you very much. He had spent the last 9 years thinking, and quite frankly, he was bored with it. Merlin only knew the anxiety his thoughts had caused him, and so right now he wanted to go with his gut feeling. And, would you look at that, Harry's gut is promptly telling him to get the fuck out of Diagon Alley before 'you're roped into something you can't escape, Harry.'
Harry wants to actually die. He averts his gaze and feels the burn in his cheeks spread down his neck. He lets out a strangled breath.
Draco walked into Harry's kitchen to find Harry staring a bit blankly at the bacon as it fried. Before going over and wishing Harry a good morning, Draco took a minute to think. There used to be a time when Harry would have been grinning like an idiot as he cooked, but now, Draco couldn't remember the last time he caught Harry smiling. Instead, Harry had been quiet and withdrawn.
Draco smiled at him softly. “Glad I could help, and actually, I feel like you've made a good start on apologizing to me for my dad.”
Draco paced Harry's bedroom for nearly an hour in indecision. On the one hand, staying could lead to more brilliant shagging. On the other, staying would more than likely lead Harry to believe that they were in a relationship when – as far as Draco was concerned – this had simply been a to-
“Listen one and all, tonight I have a special treat for you! A one of a kind fight – a LYRICAL battle!” He cried out in a singsong voice as he rolled and swayed through the air. “For this battle, two unlucky students have been cursed to sing nothing but the truth and will have to fight it out in song. So sit back, me hearties, and enjoy my treat. I promise you a musical delight!”
so much to tell you, and you’ve got to tell us — the Dementors! When
“See as much as that does make sense, I'm actually rather surprised that you want to DATE me,” Harry stated. “If you said that you want to have me in every way possible, at your beck and call day and night, but otherwise I should stay out of your way and leave you alone – THAT I would believe. Dating me... You DO know that I'm hopeless at relationships, right?”
Draco leaned across Harry to grab the biggest Bowtruckle. “Maybe the stupid oaf's got himself badly injured.”
“Harry,” Draco murmured sternly, trying to prevent a lengthy word vomit.
Anthony and Ernie both shrugged and decided to play while Michael Corner – the other Ravenclaw – declined. This left Nott and his fellow Slytherin undecided for a long moment before shaking their heads.
Harry felt a little bad that his imaginary friend sounded so sad. He took out a ballpoint pen he'd stolen from the kitchen junk drawer, and did his best to write on his own arm.
Draco smiled at him. “Then please just leave me alone and let me get on with it. At this point, I'm almost certainly going to fail, but at least I'll know that I gave it my very best.”
Abruptly, Snape conjured up a rack against the bare wall off to his left.
The look on his face should have confirmed to anyone with an ounce of observational skills that he was not himself. He looked almost drugged with dreaminess when he focused on his bride-to-be. Even Harry could see it!
James2 rubbed the back of his neck and ruffled his hair nervously. “Erm... well, the 19 of us grew up hearing stories of you, and we REALLY wanted to meet you in person.”
“Thank God!” Harry gasped out, throwing his arms around Draco and holding him so tight that he almost couldn't breathe. “NEVER leave me again!”
e on his arm. It looked as if his parents had FINALLY accepted his decision. They'd asked the elves to use the formal china, not to mention the expensive crystal. The only thing that made him frown was that there seemed to be an extra place set.
Ron gave him an incredulous look. “It can hurt if the CLOTHES are too tight?! It hurts PERIOD!”
This was highly intriguing to Draco. So much so that he lost all track of who was singing what. Pansy went a few songs later, deciding it was time to up the heat in the room by singing a song that had NO illusions about not being sexual. She sang a cult song called
Their kiss deepened and seemed like it was going to continue all day, except that Ron and Hermione walked past them, pulling Harry's mind out of the fog. Keeping his cloak over him, Harry pulled free from Draco and ran flat out so that he'd get to the Great Hall before his friends did.
in which they both pretended to be boxing fighters while they sang. The crowd was entertained and cheering them on. Toward the end, a friend of theirs – that they must have asked to join them – went up on stage with them so that they could pretend to beat the bloody hell out of him. All in all, it was hilarious and made Draco feel a bit better about staying.
That thought made him want to cry.
Harry smirked at him. “Oh? I think I should do it all the time!”
The voices hadn't penetrated the thick fog of lust until that point. Draco and Harry pulled back and whipped their heads to look at Draco's parents in apprehension – nearly terror on Draco's part.
Sighing, he stood up and walked out of his room. He knew that Harry would leave while he was gone, probably with a note wondering why Draco hadn't woken him up and kissed him goodbye before leaving his room to do whatever. But the truth was that Draco didn't want to wake Harry up nor be there when he left.
Pansy after all - the Slytherin doesn't joke around. But after a moment of stomping his feet and curling his arms around himself to stop his body from shutting down with the cold, Harry decides that if he stands outside the shop -
After a moment, just when Harry is contemplating feigning sickness and heading home - it really is far too cold to be outside - Pansy's delicate face breaks out into a pretty smile. "Yes, good idea Potter. I think if I couple these with those books on the Gringott's Banking system she wanted last week, as well as some of that sappy Muggle music you two are fond of, I'll be the best girlfriend ever." Pansy extracts her limbs from Harry's and blinks up at him, her short black hair swirling around her face with the slight breeze. "Wouldn't you agree, Potter?"
He doesn't know what to say to make the woman shut up - though, with the way Ron's piercing blue eyes are regarding him, Harry isn't sure he's quite allowed to. So he settles for blocking out the sound of her incessant squeak of a voice, mind switched off as he people-watches.
"Oh hush it, Harry. Don't worry," the woman giggles, nose patched a very vibrant shade of pink, and her gloved hand tugs at his elbow,"it'll be so fun! Just think, you and Malfoy -"
Malfoy stopped singing a while ago, now busy with rearranging the ceramic white flower pots for sale at the far back of the room. The shelf rests against a burgundy wall, the only dark thing in sight and Harry thinks it makes for an interesting contrast.
He hates the fact that he's so close to Draco now he can trace the man's face with his eyes, greedily taking in the translucent eyelashes, the dusting of freckles sitting just inside his skin, and the pale rose blush spreading across his nose and cheeks. It's fucking fascinating, watching that thing spread like wildfire across the pale, ivory canvas of the Slytherin's flesh.
Fuck, his cover's been blown, and Harry can't feel more than embarrassed.
. But you yourself are looking quite dashing."
Harry stands in a large open space that smells suspiciously of sweet apricots; not to mention far more flowers than he's ever imagined. In his life. Who knew so many existed? He can't imagine Malfoy getting many customers if the empty shop is anything to go by. But, Harry supposes, it
But then Harry remembers he's a Gryffindor and logical isn't really in his dictionary.
"So what do you think he's looking for?" Draco asks, all brisk business and flowering petals. Today, nothing hangs from Suspend charms by the ceiling, and so the floor isn't littered with compostable rose bits and disregarded twigs and leaves.
"Enchanting? Dangerously handsome?" Draco's grin still brightens up even the darkest corners of the room; the droopy flowers are left forgotten as he glides over to the sign on the front door that reads
Everyone looks so jolly, so fucking jovial that Harry can't help but think, 'is this it?' Is this the future he'd been pining for as a kid, still stuck in that awful closet under the stairs? Was this the future little 11-year-old Harry had when he first heard the words "You're a wizard, Harry," escape Hagrid's lips?
Harry's boxers are soaked, somehow.
"I don't care what we do right now okay? All I know is that I want to get you off, and you bloody well better want to get me off, yes?" The blond waits for a slight nod from Harry before he continues. "Truth be told, I haven't done anything close to this with anyone ever before and...and we have all of our lives to practice,
"Um...she'll appreciate the magic gone into making them?" He tries instead. Harry knows he's stretching it, but he knows Hermione. The girl had a weird interest in things like that. Pansy hums, her free right hand coming up to tap her chin.
Before Harry can tell himself to stop and
"Er, hey, Malfoy." Is this how one greets an ex-arch-nemesis? Harry wouldn't know, he's never done it before.
Images, unbidden, flash across his mind. Arms clutched around his torso as heat licks at their feet. Grey eyes alight with malice so bright it turns them quicksilver. Grey eyes dulled down to the color of lead from months in Azkaban. The soft fullness of a mouth he's watched for so many years.
Pansy glares at him, thin lips pressed into a tight line, her dark eyes sinking through to his soul. Harry decides he should backtrack.
Her hair is a strawberry blonde kind of thing, tied up in two buns atop her head, and even from where he's standing Harry can see her pretty, doe brown eyes. They have nothing on moonlit pools of silver, he'll tell you that, but they speak to him in the same way his father's eyes did, back when he caught a glimpse of him and his mother in the Mirror of Erised.
His dick is thin and long, the same moonlight colour as his flesh, the tip, covered slightly with delicate foreskin and leaking pre-come, is a rosy pink. Harry's heart aches, and he hopes, he prays, that once this is all over this man will still be his.
Malfoy is oddly silent behind him, and Harry doesn't speak.
This is more than anything he could have imagined. The way the soft press of his dragon's tongue -
Don't look so surprised, one must have seen it coming. Harry
This haze of barely-there feelings and pale coloured thoughts? This mess of a life where men with silver pools for eyes and soft, curled hair haunt him in the dark escape behind the closed skin of his eyelids?
His breathing almost stops when Malfoy turns around, lowering himself onto Harry's lap with strong legs. Malfoy looks down at Harry, a radiant look on his face. He's gotten less pointy in the past few months and Harry can tell he's recovered somewhat from Azkaban and his Trials. The blonde wraps his arms around Harry's neck, pressing his nose into his jawline. Harry's hips buck involuntarily up at the pressure, and pleasure explodes from the very essence of his being.
Harry doesn't believe the breezy, singing boy dancing around in
The first thing Harry sees are scantily-clad people on floating, multicolored poles, which he'd expected so it's not like it comes as a surprise. But he'd never expected that all of it, the smoke, the heat, the sensual music, to affect him as it does. After 18 years of Voldemort-imposed celibacy, Harry doesn't know what to do when his eyes glance over at a male dancer grinding in some lucky man's face.
the same love that Harry didn't even know he himself possessed. Draco raises another perfect eyebrow - everything about the man is perfect - as if awaiting an answer, and instead of giving one in words, Harry finds himself pressing his lips to the softness of Draco's mouth.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow and rolls his eyes. "Potter, you work with high-level Amortentia and colon-burning potions, I highly doubt you need my lilies and hydrangeas."
"For fuck's sake, Potter, just pound the bloody thing into the wall, it's not rocket science!"
Harry's head betrays him; he looks up. And sure enough, yep, it's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy, to be exact. The same Malfoy that Harry hasn't seen since the Trials, the same Malfoy that sort of disappeared and that Harry gave back his wand, only to have it shoved in his face.
Harry chokes. Like, seriously chokes on nothing but air; strong yet tender hands clasp in between his shoulder blades and hit him rather forcefully. He holds out an arm, waving frantically to get Draco off of him. He's fine. Harry's fine. Don't your ex-arch-nemeses ask you about your kinks? Apparently, Harry's does.
"Merlin, Harry, are you alright?" Draco is smiling murderously, one perfectly plucked eyebrow raised. His hands don't flutter from their position on Harry's shoulders but the Gryffindor is in no position to call Draco out.
His hands - still encased in their thick gloves - seem to have gotten the memo from his feet that today is ignore Harry Potter Day™, as they're up against the glass door, poised and ready to grasp the brass handle. He hates his limbs, he decides. He really does.
"It's Draco. I suggest we start to act like the adults we are. Unfortunately, War strips the 11-year-old out of a man."
Draco, ever the businessman, launches into a pleasant conversation with the kid, and Harry wants to allow himself to admire the way the man discards the whole debacle that took place not moments before, but he doesn't.
he thinks. And that's the end of his thinking for the night.
crying, not Draco. Still, Harry wraps both arms around the man he has yet to really figure out and lets him weep.
Harry Potter has a slight habit.
To be quite honest, Harry doesn't know what he's doing, not since he drank the tea - which Draco makes surprisingly well - and the two of them ran out of small talk to talk about. They had already agreed the weather was perfect for Christmas, had already caught up on what the other had been doing the past few years, and now all Harry wants to do is escape the intoxicating smell that is Draco Malfoy.
Harry sighs deep into his inner elbow ,slithers onto the ground and crawls out of his room. He has a shower, scrapes his scruffy hair back into a low bun and throws on a band t-shirt and black jeans.
"Fuck, Draco, you look so hot like this."
Malfoy just looks at Harry with suspiciously shiny eyes and lets out a strangled laugh. The Slytherin shakes his head and kneels down beside Harry, placing a hand on the small of his back.
Before Draco can protest, Harry's slamming him into the patch of wall beside the nail, face flushed and breathing heavily.
Does one cough when near an ex-arch-nemesis? Harry wonders if he should resolve to buy a few books on the subject; as it seems he'll be ending up in this situation far more times than he'd ever anticipated.
no. Not at all. Yourself?"
Sometimes Harry thinks it's best if he doesn't question things.
Warm hands press into his back, and through the haze of confusion, Harry feels himself leaning into Draco's touch. He's almost certain this isn't supposed to be happening, but he can't be too sure. Too many sense working on overdrive right now.
"Me?" Malfoy murmurs while working. "Apparently, I'm here to give the Chosen One the lap dance of his life."
Thick, white cum spurts between them, emitting sickening squelching sounds as they continue to endlessly rub against each other, and Harry knows that nothing in the world can feel better than this does; the feeling of euphoria that only Draco can cause.
He's shivering, he realises and dripping melted snow onto the hardwood floor of
The smirk that crosses Malfoy's features does nothing but make him more attractive, lightening his eyes and pulling his cheeks across his cheekbones softly. "And a kiss, if you want it."
A few years ago he'd never have dreamed of Draco
in his eyes,
He leaves it at that, and Harry thinks the conversation has ended. But Malfoy just keeps sneaking stares at him, so Harry sort of just indulges in this odd game with the Slytherin.
He sort of looks...determined. And Harry has no idea what that means. All he knows is that Malfoy has faint pink flushes on the porcelain skin of his cheeks, and he's sort of focusing on that.
In concern, Harry tried to gently pat Draco awake, but that didn't work. He got a bit more forceful, but that didn't work either. Then Harry bit his lip in concern as he wondered if he should bring Draco to Madam Pomfrey. Except... he didn't think that Draco would thank him for taking such a risk when all he probably needed was some good sleep.
how much we're supposed to be trying to fit in, I'm NOT dancing with you like that!”
It was now May! If he didn't do the job soon, he wouldn't JUST vex the Dark Lord, he'd literally run out of time! In all possible ways!
Also, perhaps because Draco was the only one literally bleeding, and therefore had proof that he had fought (even though he hadn't really), he was released first. That said, being forced to lay there on the floor as his parents (and Greyback, but who cared about him) were tortured... well, it felt almost a hundred times worse than being tortured himself.
Draco instinctively tried to hide his arm from view, but instantly realized that the action itself basically shouted that it was true. With a sigh, he gave in and held his arm out for Harry to see. Harry unexpectedly sat down (collapsed?) with a sigh.
Greyback was more than happy to cut in and assure them all that he was more than willing to come along uninvited – wouldn't pass up the chance in fact. However, considering Draco's clearly wavering resolve, the other Death eaters were happy enough to pass the time with insults and taunts. Until all of them lost their last bit of patience and snapped at him to do it or stand aside.
woman with light brown hair and amber eyes.
Alright, so, I know I didn't tag dubious consent for this, but that's because I knew that the suggestion to shag *wasn't* a magically bound dare, and thus, even though these silly boys try to use the excuse of having to because of a dare, they're actually both just really eager, lol ^_^
Narcissa pulled him into a tight hug. “Oh love. I want you to know I'll support you no matter what, but perhaps you should spend some time thinking about what it is you actually want.”
Harry sighed in defeat. “Yeah... I suppose I understand. After all, I've half convinced Ron and Hermione that you somehow slipped Katie that necklace. If I suddenly smiled at you across the Great Hall and said that you had no idea Katie even had the necklace, they'd wonder what got into me. Worse! I might have to explain this whole thing between us!”
“You do that,” Draco stated, also setting her on her feet.
“MOVE IT LUV!” A woman demanded confidently. “You're snogging the seat I need!”
Harry gave an in depth overview of his life and answered questions, even as his parents and their best friends also answered questions. Harry and his kids asked all sorts of things. Such as: “How did you survive Azkaban?” “Did you KNOW you were going to die in the Final Battle?” “What's the afterlife like?”
“WHAT?!” Draco roared incredulously even as Harry scratched his head in confusion and questioned: “What?”
Draco snickered softly, giving Harry one last tiny kiss. “Good luck!” After that, he turned and left. Harry felt his brain melt as he watched him go, and then literally shook himself and raced off toward Gryffindor tower.
Amelia gasped in delight. “Ooo! I bet that was when daddy was walking into the Forbidden Forest in order to let Voldemort kill him!”
listening to Draco sing, and I want to pay attention to him.”
After making several more pots, he had enough to fire – once the clay had a bit of time to dry so that the moisture didn't cause cracking. Calling it a day, Harry went to the kitchen, absently scratching his bum as he went, not noticing that he left a clay smudge on his naked flesh. In his kitchen, he just barely remembered to wash his hands before frying up a simple dish of potatoes, sausage, and eggs.
With a grin, Blaise held out his hand. “Alright, if this goes all pear-shaped, meet me in the Three Broomsticks.”
Draco felt betrayed! Just moments before, he'd pulled Vince out of the way of a stunning spell. And yet, Vince ran off and left both him and an unconscious Greg to fend for themselves. He did his best to pull Greg to safety, but there was NO safety!
Draco groaned as the hot splash on his hands triggered his own orgasm. The two of them leaned together while recovering for a few minutes. Then Harry suddenly pulled back and gave Draco a quick kiss.
Grinning at her, Draco lifted her onto her feet and smacked her arse. “Now go the bloody hell away and attempt to dance with those wobbly legs!”
would have done. There's no need to feel indebted to me!”
Then he decided that his best bet was to use all his lurking and sneaking skills to avoid all attention, especially any sort of battle. Unfortunately, a fully masked Death Eater spotted him and didn't care who he was. Based on his size and shape, Draco suspected that this was Rowle, taking advantage of an opportunity to get back at Draco.
The next time Harry saw Draco was at the End of Term Feast. Dumbledore was talking about Cedric's death, and Draco didn't look sad in the slightest. In fact, he didn't even seem to be paying attention! This pissed Harry off so much that if it had just been the two of them, there'd have been hexes and punches flying in equal measure.
Harry didn't have time to do much more than glare at Draco before Umbridge came bustling breathlessly around the corner. She was beyond delighted and well into jubilant when she saw Harry lying on the floor.
Ron quickly cast the spell to negate the urge to tickle Harry. “Sorry there, Seamus. Didn't expect anyone else to be in here yet, or I'd have come out first and spelled everyone.”
Harry frowned. “I have no idea why, but all of the other students seem to be looking towards our kids to lead them – no matter the House. It's a bit frustrating as it makes me wonder if they think that only our kids have a chance of winning this challenge. Also, it sort of makes me feel like none of the other students are benefiting from this exam.”
Blaise bit his lip to stop from grinning, while Ron looked a bit faint.
His body was now shaking from the effort of suppressing his magically bound urge to drag Draco away and do as dared. Ron was clearly wondering what Harry had been dared to do – since Harry probably looked about ready to vomit – and patted him on the back in commiseration. Unfortunately, this unbalanced Harry and made him lose his grip on the table.
Both Ron and Hermione were studying Draco speculatively. The fellow Hogwarts Alumni was looking posher than ever in a bespoke Armani suit, richly embroidered blue and silver waistcoat, and a silver tie. His signature blond hair nearly glowed in the light with the occasional colored spotlight turning it bright colors as he walked under them.
Harry quickly moved on to assure everyone that he'd overpowered Draco weeks ago and was now using Draco's own wand, which somehow made him the true master of the Elder Wand.
! And... Draco wouldn't even know it was him anyway. Sighing, Harry pointed at Ron's ample cleavage.
Ron took a deep breath, knowing full well that if he declined – considering who his brothers were – he'd never hear the end of it. “Yeah, I suppose I could stand to take a dare.”
“No. I don't want Harry to ever leave.”
Once again, Harry grabbed Draco by the arm, except this time, he pulled him on to his lap and gently cupped the back of his neck so that he could look him in the eye. “You are?”
Suddenly, it felt like he needed to
Even so, between official meetings to discuss plans and lessons in both Occlumency and Legilimency from his aunt, Draco had a surprising amount of time on his hands. Between his frustration and boredom, he was tempted to write to Harry via their bond, but two things stopped him. One: He was still irate at Harry. And two: He absolutely did NOT want to risk anyone finding out about the bond and using it against him. Specifically the Dark Lord.
Harry seemed to read his mind and shook his head slowly back and forth just one time each. “I only want one thing from you: How did you give Katie that cursed necklace?”
Harry was REALLY into it now, but Draco couldn't help but frown. He wasn't certain if the song was originally sung by a man or a woman, thus the lyrics about a boy COULD just be the woman who originally sang it, but coming from Harry, it made Draco pause. WAS Harry intentionally trying to say something? Such as he liked some boy???
Once they were outside the common room and across the corridor in an unused classroom, Hermione gestured for them to sit down. Once relatively comfortable sitting braced up against the wall, she turned to face Harry directly.
“Where's the fun in that?!” Terry asked with a snort. “It should be things like: I dare you to strip off and streak across the Quidditch Pitch!”
“And I just – look, if I didn't say anything at all, you'd never even know, but... I... I WANT you to know that I'm trying here, that I'll be up front with you and so you can trust me.”
“Mmm?” Draco murmured in his sleep.
James and Lily – the ghosts – looked at each other in confusion before looking at Remus and Sirius. “Anyone know what happened?” Lily asked in the tone of a person used to discovering that pranks had been played.
This seemed to fill Vernon with a perverse satisfaction. “Filthy little bastard – just like your parents, I'm sure.”
“WHY does that make you sad?” Harry asked in confusion.
always get the good looking ones?!”
you don't think that a Malfoy would
The crowd got strangely silent when Harry got up on the tiny stage. He chuckled nervously. Then he ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair.
A few hours must have passed, because when Draco drifted awake again, it was to find Harry holding his hand.
warned Harry that no matter how into it he got, he wouldn't be going home with anyone else. Thus, trying not to look like he was going to murder everyone in The Club, he watched as Draco unzipped his sexy as fuck, tight and shiny black leather trousers. Those long fingers folded the flaps back to give clear access to the agreed upon part, but was careful not to show anything he didn't want touched or licked.
Once again, the girls had no problem going up either solo or in groups to sing songs, but it seemed to take the men an hour or so to warm up and get into the idea of singing in front of everyone. Dean and Seamus performed a duet that was a mashup between two songs:
Harry shook his head and let out a heavy sigh. “Nothing. It's just... my dad... He might've actually been an arrogant arsehole after all.”
Draco was utterly grateful that the castle was more or less empty during Christmas hols. It gave him the opportunity to basically camp out in the Room of Hidden Things the entire time. Even when he ordered (via message coin) the Imperiused Madam Rosmerta to poison the bottle of her finest Oak-Matured Mead that Slughorn had ordered to give to Dumbledore for Christmas, with a very lethal poison. Unfortunately, nothing he did to the bloody cabinet worked.
"Lap dance?" He's impressed with himself when he doesn't stumble over the words.
I don't have -" He tries to say more, he'll be the first to tell you he really does fucking try, but Draco's dick is hard in those chinos of his and pressing against the crease between Harry's arse cheeks. And fuck, it feels so good, Harry can feel his own boner twitch minutely.
Draco's whole body, lithe and sleek, arches up, and Harry captures his dragon's mouth, tongue thrusting in and out of the hot crevice as his hips roll in time. The whole world crashes in on him as Harry's balls draw and tighten up, and with a final moan that Draco's lips silence, he's coming in time with the other man.
Draco's hands - pale, delicate... feminine, Harry notices - reach up to touch his freckled face. "Oh, these? I've always had them. My father detests the things, though, they remind him too much of my Mother's sister, Andromeda, so I used to cover them up with magical glamour."
It takes him4 more attempts and one plaster later for Draco to snap.
He ignores the snicker Draco gives when he almost drives the 'stupid Muggle contraption' onto his fingers, and throws the hammer down. "Yeah, yeah, right, you won. Why can't we just use sticking charms now?"
Harry knows that; he really does, but he isn't sure his body does. Hot flashes sing through his limbs, encasing his bones and seeping into his veins like poison. A really delicate, almond-smelling poison. "Yeah, yeah I know - but like...it's just um, weird for me. To say that."
"Here she is - the beautiful woman. I think she's perfect, personally, and deserves all the stolen flowers she gets."
bitch what? - is really Draco Malfoy.
I have no idea what I'm actually doing.
the time. Right?
"Shut up, Malfoy. What happened to being a rich fucker running a law firm?"
Harry smiles brightly, unable to help himself. "Yeah - yeah, ready as I'll ever be."
Or bury himself in it. Either one will do.
"Harry, it's not that hard to say my given name. I won't bite." Malfoy's rosy lips spread into a smile that reminds Harry of a shark, all teeth and no humour. "Much. I won't bite - much."
Harry's stuck, his breath lodged in his throat as a warm body, so full and so
Malfoy looks away, and Harry sort of thinks he catches glimpses of a small smile. His heart sort of warms and he scolds himself. God, this is such a bad idea.
Nodding, his best friend drags him to the front of the massive collection of wizards and witches alike all huddled by the front door, where a bouncer stands twirling her wand. At first glance, Harry thinks she must be some sort of descendant of Hagrid's. Her dark hair is cut short enough that she can fit it all underneath a leather witch's hat, and her golden eyes make Harry feel just that little bit threatened. She takes one look at his forehead, though - Ginny had left his scar visible for all to see, part of the 'process of not being a hermit, anymore' although Harry feels like it's rather redundant - and stands back. The door, freshly polished and gleaming in the night, swings open, and suddenly the quiet of the night is filled with roaring music that almost scares him.
So off Harry goes.
when both their cocks rut together blindly - the murky cloud in his mind clears a bit because of something stirring in his stomach, something akin to worry.
Is this indecent? Rubbing against your ex-arch-nemesis in the middle of his flower shop? Right where any incoming customer can see? Perhaps, but Harry's too focused on the heated flush that marks Draco's once flawless skin, watches it seep underneath the first translucent layer of flesh and travels down the blond's neck. It's beautiful. Draco is beautiful.
"Is that Pansy?" The Slytherin asks, and Harry wonders how long it's been if the man can't even recognise his old best friend's voice. "I haven't seen her in ages. Can I come say hi?"
"Potter."
It will be the day that Harry's words escape from his mouth that's - admittedly - hanging open just the slightest; the day that Draco Malfoy is wearing a damn kimono and his top button is undone. It is the day that Draco Malfoy has one of those dandelion wish flowers clinging to the back of his left ear; the day Harry splutters till he can form sentences no more.
No one responded for a long pause, and then Ron nudged Harry, clearly dreading being forced to be first if no one volunteered. Harry was actually sort of used to being volunteered to do things like this – such as that time in Care of Magical Creatures which ended up with him riding Buckbeak. He sighed.
“Blimey! Is this REALLY all there is to this shirt?!” Ron asked in dismay as he realized that his scanty shirt didn't really cover much of anything.
“I'll try. You too!” Harry wished with a small smile.
is COMPLETELY out of our home when you're finished with him.”
Harry nodded in acceptance but Ron turned a bit green as he slowly pulled off everything but his pants. Harry heckled him: “Better pray the bloke you're turning into isn't bigger than you! In fact, chances are good that he's going to be smaller and your pants are going to fall off anyway!”
hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the –” He pointed at the woman in charge of the Karaoke machine. The chosen song was started which made a distinctive tinging from the symbols of a drum set ring out twice. “FLOOOOORRR!!!!”
Draco was not the only one suddenly staring at Harry in shock. Harry was now the one fervently wishing that the table would absorb him and put an end to his misery.
Draco entered the lift without really paying attention to where he was going. He was just finished up shopping in his favorite high end muggle shop and was planning to go to his favorite club. His life tended to follow a nice pattern – business during the day, relaxing during the evening (often including a bit of shopping), and exciting new lovers every night. All in all, life was good.
“Sorry Professor, I can't seem to stop myself!” Harry called out before the 'curse' took full effect.
During the meeting, the Dark Lord had humiliated the entire family, inviting the other Death Eaters to laugh at them. He ordered Lucius to hand over his wand – which he reluctantly did – and then taunted Bellatrix with the news that her niece (Nymphadora Tonks) had married Remus Lupin. He'd finished the whole thing off by asking Draco if he planned to babysit the cubs.
Harry sincerely wished that he could hex the both of them at that moment.
“I'm SO close, and I am NOT about to let you move and chase it away again!” He snarled, making Harry chuckle.
Suddenly, the moment arrived, announced by the very first red glow of the sun itself. It landed on both of them, which seemed to be the cue they were waiting for to shout at each other.
“Why not?” Harry wondered.
Draco smirked. “I'm leaving something to the imagination to entice you with. Maybe you'll come back sooner.”
“Alright, Narcissa, but only if you call me Harry,” he bargained.
The cries of grief were so deafening that Draco might have been able to join in without notice, but he couldn't risk it. His best bet now was to wait until the right moment presented itself. A moment in which he could rejoin his parents and encourage them to... Maybe they could all escape? Find a different country where they could build a nice nest to hide in, warded to the teeth so they'd never be found.
With a small smile, Harry awarded Gryffindor the promised points for winning the challenge. Now all he had to do was review all the footage and determine each student's score – and thus, grade.
Harry snorted. “I've actually been planning this out since I first started – maybe even before. So, roughly four years of wondering how it would work and coming up with challenges, not to mention working out the obvious problems I spotted during planning.”
Harry laughed and gave his husband a kiss. “Oh no! That's the bare minimum requirement to PASS the test. They have to do a hell of a lot more to impress me to get an E or an O.”
The very air itself seemed to thicken with anticipation, until finally, Draco moved into position on top of Harry. They moved together slowly for a long time, Draco sliding rather smoothly in and out of Harry even as Harry met him thrust for thrust. Neither were in a rush – perhaps because they knew their time together like this was quickly coming to an end. In practically no time at all, school would be over for the summer, and strangely both had this irrational fear that next year would not be so easy for them to meet as lovers.
oooo ooo oooo ooo, Breathe it in and breathe it out and pass it on, it's almost out. We're sooo creative so much more, we're high above but on the floor, it's not a habit it's cool, I feel alive if you don't have it you're on the other siiide.” – Harry and Ron wandered over to the group that was clearly taking a break from dancing in order to do a bunch of potion drops.
Much later on, as Harry was falling asleep, he decided that even if it was Malfoy, it didn't really change anything. They still clearly hated each other very much. Except... Malfoy had said he was worried about him. So... DID it change anything?
Taking this as a good sign, Harry pulled his shirt off. Draco was so excited that he forgot he could cast spells to get undressed in seconds. Instead, they both tore their clothes off and tossed them away carelessly. In less than a minute, they were both diving onto the cushion and kissing so enthusiastically that it resembled a mini battle fought with their mouths.
Sirius was stroking his chin in thought. “That... makes sense. After all, I was stuck in a sort of underworld – or limbo – until that day. But afterwards, I also remember nothing. It's good to see you again, Prongs, Moony.”
“I suppose I wouldn't mind drinking with you, Malfoy.”
, and he sounded good enough that the crowd got into it and clamored to go next.
“Why not?” Draco asked curiously.
About 10 minutes later, Ron and Hermione were astonished to see Harry walk into the common room. He'd pulled his cloak off to give the password, and then promptly forgot that he didn't want anyone to see him at the moment. He was still lost in a highly dreamy remembrance of what had happened.
fall off his lap.
Scorpius pointed to Teddy. “The Head Boy always has permission to access, well, MOST of the restricted section.” Then he tapped on his chest before pointing at Rose. “And as the Ravenclaw Prefects, Flitwick always gives us permanent permission to access the restricted section so that we can learn as much as we want.”
On August first, Yaxley's plan finally succeeded and the Minister for Magic was dead, the Ministry had fallen to the Dark Lord's control, and they'd learned a great deal about the security protections put on all the places where Harry Potter might be hiding. The most likely of which was the home of the Weasleys, which was currently hosting a wedding.
“FUCK OFF!” Draco called back over to him. “YOU CAN NOT!”
The real trick was figuring out how to make it so that it
“And risk hurting you...?” Draco asked in a near whisper.
Staying in front of them and threatening to kill Mundungus Fletcher the entire way – even after he popped up and then popped off to tell Dumbledore what had happened – she escorted them back to Number 4 Privet Drive. By that point, Harry was bursting with questions for her, but she ran off before he could ask them.
Harry made extra sure that both Ron and Hermione were asleep, and then pushed up his sleeve and stared at his blank arm. Once again, a massive amount of confusion filled him. When he'd been dating Ginny, their few stolen hours alone had filled him with a happiness he'd never known. Even relatively recently, when she'd taken him aside on his birthday and kissed him, he'd felt a need to get lost in it.
Life was fairly tense all around. The Dark Lord had officially named Malfoy Manor his headquarters and moved in. He had insisted that the wards on the front gate – at the very least – be keyed to the Dark Mark, so that Death Eaters of the Inner Circle could come and go as they pleased. Although no one quite dared to do so without official business.
! I'm getting drunk and horny and shagging whoever the fuck I please!”
Draco smiled as he entered the dining room with his
Even so, he couldn't help but watch as the waitress returned to the counter, carefully selected something that would hopefully appeal to Draco – a nice India Pale Ale that Harry rather liked – and then poured it in a tall mug. She took a quick look around and subtly turned so that her back was blocking Draco's view if he should happen to be looking at her, but Harry could still see her side clearly enough to see her hands. She made a very tiny movement that Harry almost missed, pulling a vial out of her cleavage and emptying it into the mug.
During the summer between First and Second Year, Draco got so bored that after ordering all his house elves to dance and sing with him for the hundredth time, he lay on his bed and wrote on his arm.
Draco smirked at him devilishly. “If you insist.” He proved he was serious by casting all the necessary spells to be absolutely sure that Harry wouldn't be hurt. He sank into Harry with a blissful sigh.
“Not me,” Padma stated firmly.
Hand in hand, Harry and Draco ran out of the hall to do just that.
This coincided with magical little fluttering that made Draco cry out: “I'm gonna –!”
To Draco, she gave this command: “Draco, move this scum outside,” referring to the four Snatchers she had stunned in short order. “If you haven't got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.”
“What?” Harry asked, not certain he heard that right.
“Then why were you late?”
Harry had to shake off a rather goofy dreamy expression before Ron noticed and asked him what he was thinking. He hadn't had a chance to tell Ron and Hermione that he was dating Draco, and he wanted to tell them both at the same time. It just seemed like tomorrow during dinner at the Burrow would be the best time – then EVERYONE would know.
Suddenly, Harry felt a hand on his side.
Ginger nodded in confirmation. “Yes. As I said, we need to know what the effects are, so we need a couple of first hand accounts. Plus – after we finish for the night – we'll all be reporting to the Ministry Mediwitch on duty so that she can scan you both and take notes on the effects on your bodies.”
Harry felt his left eyebrow go up in surprise. “You do?” This didn't seem likely, coming from someone who always looked like his hair was just tended to by highly skilled professionals.
Smirking in amusement, Draco strode up to the bar – people clearing a path for him as he went. Blaise roared out a protest from where he was dancing. “OI! I CAN DANCE BETTER THAN DRACO!”
Then, before he could give into the urge to kiss him after all, Draco stepped onto Harry's fingers, over his body, and out of the compartment. The entire way into the castle, he was plagued with an urge to go back and drag Harry somewhere private for a much more relieving reunion, but reason prevailed. It was simply safer for both of them if they not only appeared to hate each other, but never risked being seen together when not in class.
“Feels like you're makin' a mess! You're hell on wheels in a black vest... you drove me to the fire... and left me there to burn... every little thing you do is tragic, all my life, oh was magic, beautiful boy, I can't breathe, I got a disease, deep inside me, makes me, feel uneasy baby, I can't live without you, tell me what am I supposed to do about it? Keep your distance from me, don't pay no attention to me, I got a disease, and well I think that I'm sick, but leave me be while my world is coming down on me, you taste like honey, Honey, tell me can I be your honey? Be, be strong, keep telling myself that it won't take long 'til, I'm free of my disease...”
The Slytherin that Harry recognized but couldn't remember the name of held up a drink as if toasting them. “Here here! Good thing I'm already engaged to Theo and they can't force me to set a date before I'm good and ready!” She then downed the drink.
Harry really did try not to trip over his own feet, but he couldn't stop watching Draco long enough to concentrate on his own dancing. The woman that had insisted Draco dance with her was basically rubbing her body all over his and their dance was a spicy hot emulation of shagging peppered liberally with genuinely skilled and flashy tricks.
so let's just keep on dancing, you hold me like you should so I'm gonna keep on dancing!”
After that, Umbridge quite got into it. Using both hands, she wiggled her fingers everywhere, trying to find his most ticklish spots and make him squeal as loudly as possible. She tried under his chin, his armpits, his stomach, his sides, even his buttocks!
Harry leaps back, his heart racing, and his face sort of burns. He doesn't look up because of that voice...it sort of sounds like...
The raven-haired man quickly wipes the tears from the corners of his eyes and takes three deep, gulping breaths to calm his frantic heart.
He reaches out and places a hand on the round rump of Malfoy's arse.
"Er - hi." Harry wonders if he should stand up and shake his hand or something. "Malfoy, um, what are you doing here?"
Draco spots Harry's dubious expression, and delicately waves one hand in a simple gesture. "There's no one out there of interest, anyways. I'd much rather talk to you."
Mild bad language, Smut
"Right...right." Harry tries not to reach out and grab the shorter man's face and kiss him senseless. He clears his throat again, tries to think of something even remotely witty. "I...since when do you have freckles?" Harry pauses before adding, "
Harry's cock twitches violently, pressed between both their bodies and smearing precome against Draco's flushed stomach. He pulls away from the blond's suckling mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Or so, he tells himself.
"No, no. It's fine, Malfoy, we have to go feed...her pet Hermione." Harry wants to kill himself, he really does, but he manages to ignore the rise of one perfectly plucked blonde eyebrow. "Yup. I'll just...be taking my leave now. Bye!"
Things - brightly coloured things - hang from the ceiling with what Harry guesses are a lot of Suspending Charms; so that showers of many petals and skinned branches spill from the heavens and onto the floor. Harry wonders how it all hasn't been squelched to compost.
Harry wants to scream. "So you're here just for me?"
This world where Harry Potter's and Draco Malfoy's let each other explore their skin with plump lips and hesitant tongues just isn't the right world for this Harry Potter.
So. Yunno, the ends justify the means, and all that.
Although for now, Harry agrees that it would be best to just go along with the tea. Ask some unanswered questions, deal with the longing building inside of him.
"What if, um, what if I'm not... ready?" So close to his slender dragon he can see each freckle individually - and he feels like the biggest coward on Earth. Surely sticking his cock in someone else couldn't be
And who is Harry to deny his beautiful dragon such a thing?
Harry is not at all ready for the way his body wants to claim the man in front of him, fucking hell he's not ready for the way Draco's godforsaken fingers are quickly unzipping Harry's trousers, quickly pushing them down to the middle of his thighs along with his boxers.
Many, many tags. lavenderbrown, smut, fluff, christmas time, pansyparkinson, dracomalfoyisverypretty, just all-round being adorable by my favourite boyz
He wants nothing more than to launch himself out the window and race back home, but he's worn and flushed underneath his many layers of clothing, not to mention that overtop the kid's head Draco is giving him the evil eye.
Harry almost Avada Kedavras himself into oblivion.
Harry swears - he
No one (because I have no friends)
"Do you - " Harry pauses as the twist of Malfoy's hips almost careens him off of the edge. "Do you get hard for everybody that comes in?"
Malfoy pushes Harry back into the armchair, helping him relax his limbs.
"Honestly, Potter, from Chosen one to a common thief. Is there nothing you don't aspire to be?"
Well, alright, it's more of a sort of problem...like a law-defying, slight theft sort of problem. But don't worry, it's nothing bad. Nothing that the Aurors would jail him for - not that they would even if it
Draco leans against the spot on the wall beside Harry and smirks. Harry tries not to get sucked into the beauty that is his husband's face and focuses instead on shoving Draco's shoulder.
Harry meets this new Malfoy - is he dreaming?
Draco mewls - Harry never knew he needed something so much as he now needs that fucking
"Do you like this, dragon?"
Draco's hips slam into his, ripping a violent moan of pleasure from Harry as explosions of white heat cloud his vision. Harry wonders if the fact that he's getting off by humping his ex-arch-nemesis in the middle of his own flower shop is cause for any sort of worry, but he's too caught up in his own ecstasy.
"Chop, chop Harry. You're not the Chosen One for nothing."
Implying that there will be other days. Harry stops himself from asking and instead watches as Malfoy's grip tightens around his neck and he starts grinding. If you could call it that. To Harry, it feels more of a glorified hump, with Malfoy's hardness pressed against his stomach.
Not that Harry had been complaining then. He had been mighty fine with letting Draco and his posse be the leading factor of gossip; it kept the fangirls for himself at bay.
Lavender and Ron have determined that Harry should go back to Malfoy...
He throws his head back, heat rising through his jumper and onto Harry's fingertips as his husband rolls his hips, a breathy moan leaving his mouth.
- he came here with someone named Panty, or Patty, or something of the sort, and he probably should be getting back to that person, but he can't be too sure with the way Draco's intoxicating scent in invading his personal space.
"I'll pound you into the bloody wall in a minute." He breathes, glad he's taking up most of Draco's personal space. "If you don't shut the fuck up."
"Yeah, I'm sorry about that, I..."
After a few moments, Harry turns around to leave and bumps into a hard chest. He stumbles against the person and his hand reflexively curls around a hard bicep.
flowers that Po-Harry's been pilfering."
"Shit, Dray I...I didn't know you liked -" He's quickly cut off from whatever completely pointless words that were about to leave his mouth when Draco strips off his own boxers and chinos.
do this without distractions, goddammit - and pics up the picture he's going through all this trouble for.
"Potter, why the bloody fuck are you still holding onto me?"
And Draco's sark is really starting to piss Harry off.
If the man will let Harry strip him down and take him.
It's all very disconcerting, far too cute and pretty for his taste, but Harry can't deny that the colours calm him down, and spread a sort of warmth that's short-lived and stops at his fingertips. He's just about to turn back around to pace for the umpteenth time when a shop at the end of the street catches his eye. It's a sort of mint colour, he concludes after staring at the pale green, yet Harry isn't quite sure why this strikes him as odd. Still, it's intriguing and beats waiting for Pansy, so he lets his feet carry him down towards the shop front...
You know what? Harry thinks it's time to just quit real life and bury himself next to his parents.
Ron grins at the bouncer who flushes a bit too prettily for a woman twice their size, before he glides in, Harry grasping onto the hand on his arm.
These days get on his nerves. He's Harry bloody Potter, he's supposed to be up and running 24 hours, 7 days a fucking week. Everyone needs him to, and Ron likes to remind Harry of that every time he comes over.
And so Harry stays, finds himself retreating back to nestle in Draco's earlier corner of solitude, and lays his scarf, gloves and oversized coat on the bench.
Meaning he totally misses the time he steers them through the gates of the graveyard and suddenly they're standing in front of Harry's parent's grave.
Harry realises with a slight jolt, that he's in love with this freckled Flower Shop Boy.
On the other hand, Harry is quite glad that Malfoy has thought to do such an undignified a thing as ask, as it gives Harry quite the excuse to politely tell him to fuck off.
Harry almost jumps out of his skin at the voice.
1. Merlin, this new Malfoy is a dramatic prat, but he's beautiful and his voice is like absolute sex.
dragon. His Draco. His everything - presses against Harry's bottom lip, mouth hot and wet and tasting of tea. So soft and so hot and so, so
"Alright, mate?" Ron shouts over the music. Harry nods minutely, his eyes taking it all in. "We've set up a room for you - one free lap dance, courtesy of yours truly."
Harry snorts anyway because the man has a point.
but...yeah."
Harry doesn't think his heart could take it if Malfoy walks out from that room.
Harry shudders and turns his back on the girl, and just focuses on taking the prettiest lilies.
"What? No! No, Malfoy, I didn't miss you. Er - um, why would you...uh think that?" Harry peers at Malfoy as the blond's expression drops.
His head hurts at this point.
And suddenly the whole world turns on its axis, the stars realign with the planets and the galaxies fall from the sky in beautiful, arcing motions. Harry wants to touch the beautiful man behind him, wants to turn around and shove Draco against the wall, wants to bite and lick and fuck him till the blond can't remember his own name.
Harry's been to too many gay clubs since, seeking friction and heat and redemption from the hard bodies of strangers. He doesn't think it's anything to worry about, but Hermione's sort of worried about him.
Mature
Harry practically melts, allows his body to fall forward and slips into Draco's embrace. He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing, or what has possessed him, but Harry also finds that he doesn't mind. He wants this. So much more than he ever could have imagined. Hips grind into his, and Harry bites at the exposed skin on Draco's neck - it's taunting him, he thinks, daring him to lose all control and become positively
When Harry comes down from his high, and Malfoy's curled in his lap, he presses his lips to Malfoy's, capturing them.
Wait.
It's a good one, as well - one of Harry and Draco in front of their new house for the first time. Draco's standing behind Harry, arms wrapped around his - Harry's - midsection, face pressed in close to Harry's neck. Grey eyes look like moonlit pools of silver, and Harry falls in love all over again.
Harry almost screams 'YES!'. "I mean, if you're offering then I won't say no," he says instead.
How did the pretty, freckled boy that had been singing and dancing in the shop not just a day ago turn into this sex God ready to devour Harry? Suddenly, he's turned around forcefully, and all of a sudden it's far too much for the man to handle. He's hot and flushed all over, prick straining hard against his thigh, and Harry is pretty sure his hair is more of a mess than usual. The air closes in around the pair, scents of incoming sex and lust and
damn near shagging right on the dance floor. This had the rest of the crowd cheering them on and trying their best to copy them.
“Huh?” Harry asked groggily.
Harry smiled at him. “You too.”
Happily enough, shopping with his mother was always a good experience. She had been raised in a wealthy family just like his father had, and so they were both of the opinion that Draco could have pretty much anything he wanted – with only a few exceptions. So even though they had given him his own vault, when she took him shopping, all he had to do was say he wanted something, and she would buy it for him. All in all, it was rather satisfying.
Harry felt his mouth drop open in surprise for a moment before remembering that he'd seen her put something in Draco's drink. “Ah, a love potion,” he whispered to himself.
“Yeah, and even though I'm not under the influence of Veritaserum, I hope you understand that I'm not lying,” Harry said before taking a swig of his Brewdog IPA. “I reckon I just spent so many years dwelling on you that I noticed that you didn't really want Voldemort to win the war, and once I realized that, I could see so clearly that you were trapped in a horrible situation. To this day, I'm obsessed with knowing whether you're doing better and wondering if you found happiness.”
not supposed to be in here!”
Snape sighed unhappily, slowly turning to look back at Harry. “Very well, very well – Potter, we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening instead.”
For so many reasons, Harry was rather depressed. So depressed that he'd just left the Hospital Wing because his friends had started talking about the shattered prophecy. He walked along the corridor leading away from it slowly, looking out the windows as he passed them by.
With a sigh to exhale any negative emotions, Harry continued. “Since the majority of the other Professors are currently occupied giving their Final Exams, I've recruited a lot of your parents to help me monitor the Maze. That means that EVERYTHING will be watched and recorded. I strongly advise you to NOT do ANYTHING that your parents will punish you for – so, for example, DON'T punch or fight each other, and probably best not to try to sneak in a quick shag either.”
Harry nodded in acceptance. “I know that better than anyone.” He then narrowed his eyes, suspicious all over again. “You didn't steal your dad's illegal time turner and go snatch them from right before they died, DID you?”
“No no,” Ron assured him in his soft and fluffy feminine voice. “You look nothing like me, aside from the red hair. I'm dead certain that you're a famous muggle bloke that sings.”
When the song was over, the waitstaff had trays full of shots of Firewhiskey ready for everyone to take. Draco set his dance partner back on her feet and downed another shot. His friends did too, and then Blaise grabbed Draco and held him by the back of the neck so that he could glare at him.
It was a bit of a gamble, but since the Room of Requirement was apparently one of the places that the fighters were using as a home base, chances were good that Harry would come here eventually. And he was right. Harry showed up and it took Draco keeping a firm grip on their arms to keep them waiting until the right moment.
Lucius held up a hand. “Not so fast. We've invited a guest, and unless he's even more atrocious than I think he is, he should be arriving any moment now.”
After a quick kiss goodbye, Harry summoned all his belongings and held them in his arms as he snuck back to his dorm under his cloak. A glance back showed that Draco had managed to get his trousers back on and was working on the buttons of his shirt even as he deftly avoided catching Peeves' attention.
Undaunted, Voldemort used both hands to try to tickle both of Harry's armpits. Harry couldn't help but chuckle even as he tried to back away.
“Oh please, there's plenty of time for things like that. First, you must sit and let us serve the excellent dinner our elves prepared,” Narcissa insisted, gesturing to indicate his intended chair.
“Harry, I know you just stood up to go to the loo, but come sing your song first,” Luna half commanded half suggested in a dreamy tone.
It was Draco. He wanted Draco's arms around him. He wanted the simple and platonic cuddling they'd almost never had a chance to do. More, he wanted Draco inside him making him feel bliss.
“Right!” They agreed with a nod, suddenly ashamed to realize that they'd forgotten part of the lessons they'd learned on going undercover. Fit in. Don't break cover. Mingle. Ask questions! (But don't be obviously an Auror pumping people for information.)
As planned, Draco opened the door and stepped out by himself – already holding his Hand of Glory – and saw that his suspicion was right. Some of the more interfering students were loitering in the hall as if waiting for him. Not deterred in the slightest, Draco tossed out some Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, then led his people through it by the light his Hand of Glory provided him alone.
Draco was ordered to retrieve the wands, and as he did so, absolutely no one was looking at him, except for perhaps his mother. Holding his wand defensively, he grabbed the one at the weasel's feet first. Then, a bit gingerly, he approached Harry and tried to memorized every tiny detail of his Soulmate, especially since this might very well be the last time he saw him. Alive.
They wrestled and grappled around on the cushion for so long that it was a miracle that someone didn't come looking for them after all. Eventually, they were both so turned on and ready that Harry grabbed Draco by the back of his neck and glared at him fiercely.
Harry stared them all down seriously for a long moment. “I am well aware that as your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I have taught you all a LOT of unpleasant spells. For example, I've taught you what the Unforgivable Killing Curse is. Just because I've taught you what it is, DOESN'T mean that it's acceptable to use it in this exam. Don't even joke about it!”
“Wha's tha?” Draco wondered, obviously trying to wake up enough to pay attention.
Draco sighed. “Listen... I still think this is a bad idea, but most of me wants this bad enough to say fuck it. So, rather than say yes or no right now, let me think it over. Let's... Let's start by living together – officially. Announce our relationship to the world and see if we can survive the backlash. If – IF – we're still together and happy in a year, then... yes. I'll marry you.”
Harry shrugged. “ I suppose tea wouldn't go amiss.”
faithful – in a way, a sort of convoluted way, but still. On the other hand, his definition of body shots was NOTHING like Harry had imagined!
But Draco didn't even hear him. He was currently so preoccupied that he went straight into the shower for his dorm and turned it on until it was two degrees short of scalding. Then he stood there – fully dressed in his pajamas – letting the soothing hot water rain down on him.
Harry snorted. “Ron, you're fully dressed.”
They were all too stunned that it had worked to say anything for a long moment, then James cleared his throat. “I call to the spirit of my namesake and grandfather James Potter.”
“No... only Draco...” Harry murmured, an extremely goofy lovestruck expression on his face.”
, if things go wrong we can knock it down –”
“I'm so honored to meet you, Mr. Potter!” The man gushed, working himself into quite a frenzy before Harry was able to sufficiently thank him and send him on his way. When the man was gone – apparently to the loo to compose himself from such an overwhelming meeting – Harry frowned and cast a discrete spell on the ale to see if it contained any undesirable additions.
Nah, why would Harry sneak into their compartment when the two of them could easily meet up in secret later on? That said, Harry must be as mad at Draco as he was at Harry, because neither of them had written a word to each other via their bond all summer. Maybe it was possible after all that Harry had foolishly risked his neck by sneaking into their compartment and hiding. If caught, the five of them would be able to hex him nastily and claim that they were just defending themselves from his attack. After all, HARRY would be the one coming to them in their compartment – rather than the other way around.
“Draco,” Harry whispered, kissing him, hoping to wake him up in a good mood.
here?”
Harry smiled and gave him a kiss in return. “I had them wake us up at half 5, so we don't have too much time to linger here if we want to get back to our dorms before being caught.”
Turning away for a moment, Draco spelled the piano to play itself. Naturally, it was a song that Draco wanted it to play.
“That's not the problem!” Draco protested as he sat down after all. Harry unconsciously kept a grip on his arm. “The
Those words rankled! “How do you know?” He demanded almost petulantly. The fact that he sounded a bit like a precocious child made Draco flush in embarrassment. “You don't know what I'm capable of,” he insisted in an attempt to regain his confidence and control of the situation. “You don't know what I've done!”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Funny, you'd think I'd have stopped walking around...”
A week later, after serving detention with Professor McGonagall, Draco was surprised to see something on his arm when he was changing into his pajamas. Something that sent an undesired thrill through him.
“WHY did we have to return home NOW?” Another asked with a sneer that indicated that he was a bit repulsed. “I REALLY didn't need to see my son in his pants with a naked lover about to shag in the ballroom.”
They all got busy eating and Ron ACTUALLY managed to forget his illicit pact until Peeves decided that everyone had eaten enough and started howling near the enchanted ceiling – which was in the process of displaying a gorgeous sunset.
Instead, he was bent over a sink, wondering whether he'd actually vomit. Worse, he was once again crying pathetically in front of the ghost girl – just because she was sympathetic. Even so, she wasn't the best at comfort.
A month later, Karaoke Night has been made official. EVERYONE wants to participate, even a mildly reluctant Draco.
Nodding, Harry fell silent, simply holding and kissing Draco. After a while, Draco was far more relaxed. He wasn't exactly full of boundless energy, but he was definitely interested in taking advantage of Harry's willingness to comfort him. Without warning, he used his wand to cast spells to undress them both – which made their clothes fly onto separate desks and fold itself into neat piles.
and had the ability to weigh your options through the filter you normally have to prevent you from blurting out the unvarnished truth.”
“Yeah alright,” Harry agreed, sort of thankful that he wouldn't have to immediately tell everyone should his dare happen to be something like: grope the arse of the person on your left. He could just do it and get it over with, and then apologize profusely. He stuck his hand in the cauldron and swirled it around a few times. One slip seemed to stick to his hand, practically refusing to be let go of, so Harry shrugged and pulled it out of the cauldron.
Daisy nodded and pointed at her dad's name. “Yep, my dad's Dudley, Harry's cousin, making you my Great Aunt.”
The ale flashed white gold for a split second, and Harry pinched his chin and squinted his eyes in thought as he tried to remember which potion was indicated by white gold...
Getting to his knees, Harry began at the bottom and worked his way up, licking every drop as slowly as possible to savor the experience. Once he got to Draco's belly button, he shifted his eyes to Draco's and...
feeling. I actually recommend taking 10 drops. That's just enough to give you a pleasantly fuzzy horniness that you can enjoy without wanting to shag every person in this Club.”
Harry made a gesture that wordlessly and wandlessly cast a summoning spell on Draco, who flew into his arms. “I said I'd rather kiss you.” He proved his point by doing exactly that.
The long months at school were not exactly pleasant. In fact Draco was now thoroughly disgusted with himself. With Voldemort in charge via Snape, he'd made some rather disturbing changes.
But the longer they were apart, the more Harry realized that he'd felt happiness because she was a source of comfort. A person – perhaps the only one in the world – that treated him like a normal ordinary person who deserved normal things like a relationship. Even so, he'd long since recognized that he would never be free to actually be with her. All during Bill and Fleur's wedding, he'd had thoughts and visions of Ginny being able to find love and get married to someone else. Whereas he would never have that because anyone and everyone he associated with – let alone dared to love – was going to be in enormous danger. They'd be hunted so they could be used against him.
They looked over to find Peeves lurking at the very back of the alcove. Exchanging a concerned look, both wondered if it would be worth the waste of breath to try to convince him to go away and mind his own business. Both ALSO wondered if they could cast a spell on him to scare him off – or at least hex his mouth shut.
And with that, they went their separate ways, both strangely looking forward to returning to school next fall.
Draco tilted his head to the side as he studied Harry's face. No matter how much he looked, Harry seemed serious. Intensely serious.
Inside an old and rather dingy house, Harry was beyond happy to see and hug Molly, who promptly tried to tickle him (as Moody had unthinkingly taken off the Disillusionment just then). Thankfully, everyone else was already headed off to a meeting and weren't looking at him.
Harry had no way of knowing that Draco was suddenly a nervous wreck, thinking about all the things that could have gone wrong. No, all Harry knew was that he had a surprisingly excellent night's sleep.
Actually, it hadn't been studied thoroughly enough to know for certain, but from what Beedle the Bard had managed to discern, only the Soulmates themselves could send the messages, except for rare cases when one was incapacitated and a different person had to send a message on their behalf. But as for things like tattoos and scars, or anything resulting from magic – such as a hex leaving a whiplike mark – none of that showed up. This information relieved Draco greatly because no matter how mad he currently was at Harry, he DIDN'T want him to know he was Marked.
Harry forced a tiny smile, laughed, and flapped his hand dismissively. “That's what I have you for!”
A thought occurred to Harry. “Er... how long until this kicks in?”
Draco scoffed dismissively, knowing that he had nothing worth doing to make the day a good one. He wandered around the house for an hour or so before deciding to go shopping. With nothing he NEEDED to buy, he spent the entire time picking things he thought might look nice in Harry's house. He did this fairly often over the months and had inadvertently remodeled Grimmauld Place because of it. As he shopped, he thought about Harry and more lyrics floated through his mind.
She growled at him softly. “If you think there are, you're imagining things!” Then she grabbed the comb and ran it through his hair a moment, muttering under her breath. “I should just get a shaver.”
Once Draco was asleep, Harry ran his hands through his hair again and paced his tiny flat. After a while, he decided that taking a shower might help him relax, which it did. By the time he was done, he felt rather languid and ready for bed. Except his bed was currently occupied, so, he transfigured one of his two arm chairs – his not favorite one – into a small bed. After getting comfortable, he managed to drift off to thoughts of:
Draco wasted no time sinking into that divine warmth, happy to kiss Harry with every thrust. Draco pounded into Harry as if trying to win a race. Harry was seriously into it – especially since with this position, Draco was rubbing his shaft with every thrust. So into it that he started squealing with orgasm in about a minute.
Harry was impressed even as he was dismayed that – once again – the flag was brought to him via a determined student working alone – as opposed to as a team. That said, the rest of the Gryffindors HAD tackled as many other students as they could so that none of them could intercept or impede Sai. So... mission accomplished?
In the meantime, he occupied himself with tearing the entire Prophet into minuscule pieces. Thankfully, he didn't have long to wait – or unfortunately, depending on how you looked at it, since he didn't have time to calm down. Harry arrived home about ten minutes later with Ron and Hermione in tow.
