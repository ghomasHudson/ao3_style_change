In fact, he wanted it so badly that he tried every tactic he could to win over the Professor. “Sir, I think you knew my Grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?”
Harry looked stunned, but that didn't stop his next song from being sung. “Oh you're a loaded gun, yeah, oh there's nowhere to run, no one can save me, the damage is done, shot through the heart and you're to blame, you give love a bad name!”
“Harry! You bloody fucking idiot! HOW is getting married going to solve anything if you're not happy with the way things are?!” Draco demanded, getting angry now himself.
Auror Ginger rolled her eyes. “Oh please! Everything is properly covered! It just LOOKS like no one is wearing anything because what they are wearing is tiny and revealing.”
As the potatoes cooked, he grabbed the Prophet that had been delivered that morning but he hadn't read yet.
It didn't take long for them to reach their climax. Draco was so pent up that he went first, and that sudden hot addition to their lubrication made Harry shiver in bliss, and then pump out what felt like an ocean. Sighing in a mixture of relief and happiness, the two gave each other a couple more small kisses before curling up and falling asleep.
Reality crashed on Harry enough to make him agree and get to his feet to follow Ron out of The Club so that they could Apparate away. By the time Ginger had Apparated them to the Ministry Mediwitch, Harry was in a GREAT mood. The potion he'd just taken made him giggly and happy in the best possible way.
Not even waiting for a reply, he slipped out of bed to his trunk that was already packed for Hogwarts. Opening it, he quickly located a book that he'd found in his family library about a year ago. It was called Rare and Unusual Magic.
. Cho handed off to Padma, who sang a breakup song called
And for the most part, this was true. There was one group in the corner that looked like a bunch of fashion models who had just come from a photoshoot. One of them – who was facing away from Harry – even reminded him of... Draco actually.
I'm gaining weight and getting flabby.”
The next thing he knew, a feeling in his arm made him sit up with the certainty that his mark was burning him, only it wasn't. Instead, there was writing.
Draco shrugged before nodding. Narcissa nodded in return. Once again, she whispered into his ear so that no one could possibly overhear her. “Just know that my loyalty is to you above all others. If it comes to it, I will stand with you – even if you chose to stand with him.”
For the hearing that Harry had to attend, and then a few weeks later when he rode the Hogwarts Express back to school, the best solution they could come up with – other than casting spells on everyone who saw Harry to help them control their urge to tickle him, was to cast a spell on Harry that made him slightly blurry to those that looked him. It seemed to work in that no one in the Ministry or on the train tried to tickle him. The problem was that the spell was only temporary and had to be renewed every hour. The other problem was that Harry could not cast the spell on himself – which is not to say that he couldn't cast the spell at all, simply that the curse itself seemed to make it impossible for him to cast anything on himself that would negate the curse.
This managed to catch her attention this time. “As in LUCIUS MALFOY???”
Harry nodded, feeling that since Draco had been forced to admit to a few truths he really didn't want to, it was only fair to admit to a few of his own. “Yeah, over a year, and there never really was a lot to begin with.”
This was an excellent start to the plan. As soon as they were relatively clear, one of the minions was sent ahead to cast the Dark Mark above the Astronomy Tower in order to attract Dumbledore's attention and prompt him to return sooner than he'd planned to. Even so, with the sudden arrival of several extra people who didn't even belong in the castle at the moment, plus a couple of other students, they had a job of standing their ground.
Draco shrugged and snorted in amusement. “Even I'VE heard you telling them over and over that they need to work together. It's really their own fault if they lose points for not listening.”
This inexplicably interested Harry, who got a rather disconcertingly good look at the sight as he waited for Draco to shift to a comfortable laying position, and then covered him with the blanket. Then Harry sat there staring at him for several long moments wondering why the sight of Draco in his bed made him feel uneasy. It was suddenly stiflingly warm in the room and his heart felt like he was supposed to be running away from some serious danger.
Harry pressed his head to his hand again and prayed for a miracle.
Sadly, Draco was so in need of a nap – and maybe a good meal or two – that he barely managed to follow instructions. His finished potion was merely passable, and probably wouldn't work very well anyway. Not having the energy to care that Slughorn once again favored Harry, Draco simply packed up his belongings and left the moment the bell rang.
As he trudged toward his common room on the night of March First, he heard whispered gossip from nearly everyone he passed that Ron Weasley had nearly died from poisoned wine that morning. Draco winced, NOT relishing the images of what Harry would do to him if he found out Draco was inadvertently responsible for his friend nearly dying.
On the one hand, Draco may have tried to subtly help Harry by letting the others escape, but on the other hand...
“Not so!” Peeves assured them, looking a little affronted. “Red weasel's venerated brothers told Peeves to give 'em hell for them, so that's what Peeves wants. I'll help you by distracting everyone long enough for you to slip the potion in their drinks – then the WHOLE HALL will be on hand for this naughty prank!” He cried out in glee.
The orbs shimmered and grew much bigger and fainter for a moment before seeming to melt into actual people. Physically real people who could touch and be touched. Not to mention talk and be asked questions.
Lucius smirked mischievously at his son. “It's simple, really. Mr. Potter will be given a small vault – as you were – and added to the list of Malfoy Heirs. In 60 or 80 years when the time comes for me to pass on, he'll be entitled to the younger Heir's portion of our fortune, with the larger part going to you. And if you should happen to have no Heirs of your own, he and his Heirs will be the next in line to receive your portion.”
The prospect had Draco sick to his stomach, and he couldn't eat even when given food. He wanted to just... curl up and go to sleep and never wake up. He wanted to... well...
Lucius felt like the explanation needed to back up a bit and provide clarity. “So... you're saying that you've been staying with Potter all this time?”
Imagining the look on his father's face made Draco happy enough to cast the Patronus that Harry had been trying to teach him. He was delighted to see that it was a dragon. Being a Patronus that represented some aspect of him, it was only about the size of a Manta Ray, but that was fine by Draco. Perfect in fact.
“Quite,” Lucius agreed dryly, turning to leave. “Just be sure
But there was no answer.
Laughing, Harry promised him: “Whatever makes you happy.”
“You need to take better care of yourself,” Draco murmured in concern.
“Because...” Draco shifted so that he was facing away from Harry, who promptly spooned up behind him. He sighed morosely, only able to admit the truth because he already had. “My heart already belongs to you. I don't want you to use it like a tool to control me. If you don't want to date me, please just tell me now and let me go home. I promise I'll never bother you again.”
Harry gave him a look that was just short of rolling his eyes. “Draco, we share an underwear drawer, remember? I bloody well KNOW you've got an illegal time turner.”
“Who you being married off to?” Pansy asked out of both sympathy and curiosity.
Harry decided to wake Draco up before slipping out of bed. It had only been five days since they had decided to try dating, and sadly – true to Harry's word – he had so little time to spend with Draco that all they'd managed to do was hold each other and snog a bit before Harry fell asleep. In fact, Harry was looking forward to tomorrow because he'd be able to come home from dinner at the Burrow with a few actual HOURS to spend with Draco. However...
Utterly relieved, Narcissa turned the conversation to other things to occupy the time until dinner. After a mere half an hour, it came out that Narcissa not only loved to garden (which Harry dabbled with a little whenever Neville stopped by for a visit), but that she knew a bit about making pottery.
Time seemed to stop as Draco and Harry's eyes met. Draco and his mother were standing there passively, both privately hoping this escape attempt succeeded even if it meant severe punishment for their family. Harry was concerned for the goblin and house elf he was holding onto, even so, as their eyes stared into each other for the briefest moment, they both seemed to be saying the same thing.
Harry closed his eyes and raised up just a little to meet Draco for a soft kiss that got fairly possessive rather quickly. As they kissed, a flash of light burst from Harry that swirled around them for a dozen seconds before zooming up into the air and vanishing.
“Oi, listen, STOP obsessing over Malfoy!” Ron advised in amusement. “HE'S not the reason we're here tonight! He just so happens to be getting pissed with his mates. WE need to keep an eye out for that bloke AND the potion.”
Harry chuckled softly, looking Draco up and down as he leaned against the door of the ballroom. “At first, I woke up when you slipped out of bed, and I thought maybe you were just going to get breakfast, but then I heard you talking to someone, so I followed to find out who. As it turns out, you were singing to yourself, and I was amazed at how good you sounded. So I followed you, quite enjoying the sight of you in your pants while dancing around. But then I realized WHAT it was that you were actually saying.”
“I want you to be happier,” Draco added, trying his best to look at anything but Harry.
Weeks passed...
Although he would admit – silently to himself, in his head – that he was beyond grateful that the bloody cabinet worked on humans too, and not just an extremely lucky bird.
Remus looked at his dad and scratched an itch on his cheek. “Erm, well...” He pointed back and forth between his sister and himself. “As Hufflepuff Prefects, we ALSO have permanent permission on file to access the restricted section as much as we want.”
Draco looked down, pinching his chin as he thought this over. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he wondered why he couldn't remember meeting his fiancée before he proposed to her. Surely if he had such strong feeling for her, he'd remember at least seeing her around the castle.
Harry ignored him. “Am I wrong? IS it possible to cheat on someone you're not dating?”
you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I
Harry kissed him and they both got lost in the kiss for a few minutes before breaking apart and helping each other to their feet. As Harry got dressed, he couldn't help but appreciate the sight of Draco pulling on his silky blue pajamas.
Happily, Umbridge's first day as Headmistress was spent chasing glorious fireworks all over the school. However, the next day, when Harry was on his way to Occlumency lessons with Snape, he ran across Cho, who tried to apologize to him for her friend, but only succeeded in making him madder than he could recall being – and he'd been mad a lot!
Pansy immediately went to the loo to double check her appearance. Draco took advantage of this by having a quick word with Blaise. By the time Pansy returned, Draco had ordered a round of drinks and joined Greg at the table that had been reserved for the Slytherins.
“He's a good singer!”
And having apparently reached an agreement with himself, Draco quickly transfigured a few of the desks together into a rather large bed, and then levitated Harry onto it. After pulling his necktie off, he used a spell to duplicate it until he had four in total. Then he used a spell to bind Harry's hands and feet to the head and footboard, using the ties more as decoration then as actual binding.
Four men wearing club uniforms appeared from the crowd. “So sorry, Mr. Malfoy! Let us take care of this.”
He quickly told them the plan and gave them their orders, more than a little smug that the Dark Lord had specified that Draco was in charge and that they were to listen to him and – more importantly – NOT get in his way as HE did what he was supposed to. Still, as confident as he was that he could lead anyone through anything – having superior blood to almost everyone here (especially that mangy Greyback) – it was one thing to lead them and quite another to actually do the deed.
Draco glared at him fiercely. “ARE you dating that mud – hhhh! Granger. Are you dating Granger?”
Pansy roared with laughter. “Looks like the two of you are going to be rather busy for the next hour or so!” She pointed at all the women who were now eyeing up Blaise like he was a piece of quality steak ready to be grilled.
“IT'S 8AM! IF YOU'RE NOT RUNNING OUT THE DOOR, YOU'RE LATE FOR CLASS!!!”
“What Potter?” Draco asked in frustration.
“Alright, as you heard, the rules state that I may place the drop anywhere on your lover's body so that you can lick it off them. You COULD just have it dropped into your mouth, but in order to avoid the risk of any sort of cross contamination, we have to administer the drop far enough above your mouth that the dropper never even gets close. IF the drop of potion should happen to miss, you still have to pay and we DON'T replace it. With that in mind,
“Right away sir,” the Waitress promised before running off.
“Please murder before I have to do this,” Harry begged.
JUST as they finished getting dressed, Harry feeling almost as numb as he had after the Final Battle, the Auror in charge of their training for the night entered the shower room, making Ron yelp and reflexively try to hide his breasts.
“You cooked?”
That's when it hit Harry. “Are you... trying to get him to kill himself?”
wanted to get away.”
Harry chuckled. “Well, if I had my druthers, you'd have met your justice in the Final Battle, but since you didn't, I would prefer it if you lived out a natural life. What I'm ACTUALLY saying is that I don't need to be named as one of your Heirs; I have plenty of my own money, thank you very much.”
“Never...” Harry promised, feeling ready to pass out. He'd had a LONG day after all. Thankfully, Ron had him tucked into bed in no time, letting Harry hum and purr Draco's name in his sleep.
“Thanks anyway, but I'm off the market,” Draco informed everyone with an amused laugh. “But that said, I suppose I can sing another song.”
Then Harry flung his arms around Draco and Draco gasped out a small sob of longing and relief and sheer need. He pulled Harry into him and held him so tight that Harry almost couldn't breathe. Lucius – and about 99 percent of those in the hall – was goggling at them in shock and astonishment.
“That's true...” Harry whispered as he thought this over. “I'm... not adverse, but... I... I really think that we should both think this over before jumping into anything.”
Narcissa set the brush aside and pulled her three year old son on her lap. “Because – my love – you might be one of the lucky ones.”
Relieved, Draco tucked the book back in his trunk and crawled back in bed. “So... if she goes to a regular school – presumably meaning a muggle one – then maybe she's actually a mudblood and just hasn't gotten her letter yet. AH!”
As he was being licked, Harry had a chance to look over at Draco, who was now sitting in his original chair, reclining a bit with his shirt unbuttoned and a random woman from The Club licking potion drops off his well groomed chest. Pressing his lips together, Harry had to fight the urge to go over there and shout until the whole bloody Club went home. Standing up, Harry turned to Ron.
Harry was a bit alarmed by the fact that it was difficult to breathe. He was also rather disgusted that liquid kept dribbling into his mouth from something that felt like a smooth pair of lips. To his relief, it didn't smell or taste like what he thought pee would.
The good news was that when the article was published, Cho seemed to like him again. But judging by the dark look Draco gave him, the hate between them was back on again, and possibly even deeper than ever. Harry sighed a bit sadly, wondering if he was making the right choice.
Harry threw the pillow right back at him. “And HOW are they supposed to do that when they don't know where you are and you refuse to answer their Owls?!”
Taking the time to really work him open, Draco eventually pushed three fingers in while his tongue wiggled all over the outside to soften him up. Also, he occasionally paused to cast a lubrication spell. Eventually, Harry was fairly well prepared.
To his surprise, Ron rolled his eyes. “You're bloody obsessed! He's not UP to anything!”
“Alright then!” Terry exclaimed a bit gleefully as he passed out the slips to those who agreed to play. Everyone took a minute or so to decide on their dares and write them down. Terry collected them in an empty cauldron so that no one could see the slips once they were in it.
“Wait, you want me to make Harry *sing* what's on his mind?” Ron asked incredulously, deciding that Blaise had definitely lost the plot.
“Been here long, Potter?” Draco asked as he blatantly stole Harry's ale and downed at least half of it in one gulp.
NOT that he planned to tell Ginny that she was right! They were broken up for good now and there was no need for her to have cause to say I told you so!
A woman was now standing in front of Draco. She was topless and wearing a ruffly blue skirt that reached her knees. She gave Draco a flirty grin.
Harry was so worn out by this point, that he didn't have the capacity to register Snape walking over to him. He had one insane moment where he thought that Snape was going to give him a hand up, but then Snape made a noise that suggested he was contemplating a deep mystery.
“Huh...” Harry murmured, a look at the woman Ron currently was Polyjuiced into made him wonder if the potion even COULD work on him, since the mere thought of shagging Ron in any form made him so limp it felt like pudding. Shrugging, he held up two fingers. “We'll take a drop each.”
Sometime in January, Harry found a book in the girls' bathroom that had upset Moaning Myrtle, and too curious to just leave well enough alone, he kept it. After a horrifying Valentine's day, Harry finally figured out the secret to the diary.
After the drops were gone, the man leaned forward so that he could give Draco a kiss. Draco returned the kiss for about three seconds before turning his head. “That's enough now. Go dance or something.”
Ron made a sound that was hard to interpret.
Hermione chuckled even as Ron looked a little green. “Alright then, two hours, and we'll do our best not to worry if you're a little late.”
Chuckling under his breath because Harry had come to have a genuine appreciation for the sometimes underhanded tactics of Slytherin House, he went about resetting the Maze and adding in the slightly harder things the Sixth Years had learned about in his class. The good news was that the first exam had only lasted a little over two hours, and so, the Sixth Years still had a good five or six hours before Harry was going to call a break in the test for dinner. He advised them all to eat a quick snack and bring something little with them for if they got hungry, but for obvious reasons, a big meal right before the exam was a bad idea. Plus, it would waste a lot of time and was best saved for after the exam was over.
“Deal!” Harry agreed enthusiastically before trying to steal Draco's soul via a kiss. After that, they fell into bed and didn't plan to leave it for a long time. Except...
Since Harry was closer to the stage than the loo, he agreed without protest. He stepped up to the stage, taking the microphone from Luna. She gave him a kiss on the cheek and murmured: “You'll be just fine,” in his ear. He returned her kiss to the cheek and gently pushed her off the stage.
want that to be your sister's
“Oh...” Draco murmured softly in disappointment. His sharp grey eyes pierced Harry for a moment before he shrugged. “Well, I was considering leaving you a note apologizing for not coming over tonight anyway.”
Draco raised his head to look him in the eyes. “... We'll see...”
Ron frowned. “So the more I take, the more I'm going to want to shag everyone here?”
“Erm... Malfoy,” Harry stated, bracing himself for Ron to nearly strangle him in incredulity.
“Harry's going to murder me!” Ron wailed softly, tempted to tug on his hair. Prior to now, he had been hoping they could lure their idiots to a private corridor or classroom. But now he saw that he was basically trapped in this course of action, that PEEVES would make his life a living hell if he chickened out now.
After a series of soft grunts that ended with a happy sigh, Draco melted onto Harry's back. He was panting lightly and making noises that suggested he'd be pleased to go right to sleep with Harry as his bed. If he were honest, Harry wouldn't mind this either, as he was currently at least half out of it.
Instead, he was preparing to hex the bloody hell out of Draco!
Draco tried to leap to his mother's defense, but ended up tripping over the overly long unhemmed robe he was having fitted, which made the weasel laugh much louder than necessary. “Don't you talk to my mother like that, Potter!”
The next morning, the Owl said: Stop being a child, Draco, and come the fuck home!
“You may not know this, but I once had to have six of my friends Polyjuice into me, and when they did, NONE of them cared about the fact that they were wearing MY naked body, and while I was a little embarrassed at the time, after I thought about it, I realized that there was nothing to be embarrassed about,” Harry explained.
“Too right!” Blaise agreed with a grin that promised Harry anything he wanted later on – if he was so inclined.
Draco heaved a sigh. “Fine. I suppose I can spend time singing with my friends – if I
“So, what you're saying is that you want me to keep pounding you like this until we both pass out?”
“Because we're not friends and you hate me,” Draco pointed out. “WHY in the bloody hell would I want to give you all the ammunition I have so that you can use it all against me for the rest of my life?”
“Oh won't you stay with me? 'Cuz you're all I need, this IS love, it's clear to see, so darling, stay with me!”
But then Draco stood up as the waitress came back to check on him again. He pulled her into his arms and brushed her hair away from her eyes. She looked extremely pleased with herself and grinned at him flirtily.
“Oi! Draco! It's YOUR turn to buy a round!”
Hermione held her hand out to Ron, who was now staring vaguely in the direction of the shower and clearly wondering what could possibly take an hour and a half. Twenty or forty minutes, sure, but and hour and a half??? Shaking his thoughts off, he took Hermione's hand and they Disapparated.
After a year of Karaoke Nights, Harry is getting rather frustrated.
Harry stood up and walked over so he could pull Draco into his arms. “I'm serious. I love you and want to marry you. I've been brooding over how to ask you for weeks! I thought about making grand romantic gestures, or doing it in public so that everyone knows how I feel about you, but then I realized that you'd probably say no and murder me on the spot if I did that, so then I thought maybe a SMALL romantic gesture – such as dinner, but...”
Draco shook off his melancholy and walked over to Harry. He put his arms around Harry's waist and snuggled him tight for a moment before giving him a kiss. Harry hummed slightly before giving Draco a tiny smile.
Harry felt vulnerable all of a sudden and shrugged as he turned to sit at his table. “I dunno. Having a family of my own as soon as possible sounds like a brilliant idea.”
Harry shook his head. “Two hours. I promised Malfoy an interesting shower.”
Even so, he had to be sure: “Who else is here?”
Anthony Goldstein waved a hand as if he thought he was an expert on the subject. “A dare should never be anything YOU PERSONALLY do not want to do.”
“IT'S GOING TO BE 100 LAPS AND 25 BURPEES!”
to be buggered.
Pansy's part came first. “You're the light, you're the night, you're the color of my blood, you're the cure, you're the pain, you're the only thing I wanna touch, never knew that it could mean so much, so much...”
Harry couldn't help but look over to where Draco was sitting by himself in the corner of the Leaky Cauldron. Harry was there trying to unwind after a particularly trying day. He had just resigned as an Auror because he'd realized that the job was all stress with very little reward, and that was taking into consideration the fact that he'd managed to help capture all the Death Eaters who'd succeeded in escaping from justice after the Final Battle.
Draco sneered, knowing that Harry loved Hogwarts too much to risk getting expelled. “Yeah, like you'd dare do magic out of school.” Then sheer curiosity took over. “Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.”
Screaming in frustration that he'd survived nearly being murdered at Harry's hands – which he would have welcomed – AND an infuriated torture session from the Dark Lord, only to die like this, more or less at the hands of someone he actually considered a friend when he was in the mood to be sentimental.
a debt to me – not as far as I'm concerned.”
“What? Oh, er, sorry...” Harry mumbled.
Suddenly, there was a loud banging on the door.
Harry shrugged. “Mostly I just like the song, but I'll admit that I might be serious too.”
Meanwhile, Harry looked like the article was written about someone else, and the weasel looked remarkably close to being jealous – considering that he was pounding his pestle into the work table rather than the mortar full of scarab beetles. After Snape told them off, Harry finally thought to look at Draco, who was so upset by this point that he simply HAD to show his anger. So he tapped on his badge in the spot that would make it read POTTER STINKS!
Both elves popped into the room looking like they'd quite like to murder each other. “Master/Sir called?”
Draco slumped onto Harry, almost knocking them both over. “I really can't tell you. All I can say is that I was told to do something and I HAVE to do it or the people I love will pay the price.”
Draco looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of the pale, pointed face contorted with rage.
Minerva smirked at him and then turned her attention back to Harry. “Do you have a plan for if your children abandon their Houses and work together to win?”
Sighing, Draco pointed at the badge he was wearing. “I made a new one for myself. This one, well, see?” He tapped it and it changed from Support Cedric Diggory to Potter is my Champion.
“Well, no. It's just that I need to tell you something before I go to class,” Harry said.
Rose sighed and rubbed her temples, feeling that it didn't matter what she thought since she was clearly in the minority and would lose a vote anyway. “Fine... If we're going to do this, then let's do this.”
“Excellent!” Blaise crowed in triumph as he handed the vial over.
Taking his hand, Draco led him to the cushions. They got to their knees, and then lay down so that Harry was on his back with Draco on top of him. The first kiss was soft, almost hesitant.
“I'm too bloody busy studying to become an Auror to shag,” Harry admitted in a grumble.
“When we decided to be Aurors, I REALLY didn't think we'd have to wear things like this,” Ron muttered, pulling on the extremely short skirt that barely covered his knickers. “Where the bloody hell are we GOING?”
Draco harrumphed and gestured for Blaise to get on with playing his song. It had a bit of a lengthy instrumental intro, and then the song was sung in a slow and intense way that sounded just a bit creepy. Enough people recognized and knew the song that he could hear them singing along with him. Which was interesting to say the least and nearly made him laugh with mental images of the entire student body of Hogwarts singing this in the Great Hall at dinner.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione sighed, not exactly reassured, but relieved that it was a likelihood.
Draco banged his head a few more times, muttering: “Why me???”
It took him banging his head on the wall several times before he could wrap his head around this information.
in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of
Harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry stopped dead; so did Draco and the others. For a few moments, the only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes of students playing in the Black Lake drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors.
until he realized that he'd have to take off his shirt. He did so and tossed it off to the side, noticing that there was already a small pile of clothes lining the sides of the room. Harry bent over slightly, bracing himself against a table where the occupants were watching the show with clear eagerness to get to their turns. The woman placed nine drops along Harry's spine – which was only very lightly hairy and didn't interfere with the licking.
Harry shook his head. “No, I'm not going to give the bitch the satisfaction of knowing that she got to me. Besides, after writing enough lines to satisfy her for the night, the fuzzy spell had worn off, so when she told me to let her look at my hand, she looked right at me and got hit by the full effect of the curse. She tickled me until I chucked up all over her, so, I got her back and good!”
He had done it! It worked! Draco had succeeded! This news was enough to have him shouting in glee and dancing all over the place. His mood wasn't even dampened when that imbecilic Divination teacher walked in and nearly caught him, but he managed to get behind her and evict her from the room before she even had a chance to see him there.
Harry smiled at him before taking a sip of his IPA. Then he frowned. “You're wrong about something. I'm NOT actually dating anyone, nor am I likely to have any amount of kids in the near future.”
Harry grinned, not looking at his friends but still at the ceiling. “He, well I already said he was licking me everywhere. It was... nice. It got me... up, you know what I mean?”
Wait, no. This was an impetuous Gryffindor. A rough and blunt Gryffindor with no subtlety. If he wanted another weekend, he'd just say so. He'd have sent an owl of invitation. He
Suddenly, half excited and half terrified, he ran up the stairs, casting an Expelliarmus the moment he burst through the door. After seeing Dumbledore's wand going flying over the rampart, Draco took a careful look around.
Ginger roared with laughter and dragged them out of the shower room so that they could get going. They just needed to make a quick stop first. A minute later, they were in the incident room assigned to them for the night.
I feel like I cheated you out of some really hot sexy times, but literally JUST as I got to that part, my son came in the room to chat and completely killed the mood. Sorry! However, the real point was to get the boys together and the smut was just added for fun anyway, lol ^_^
“Er...” Harry said in apprehension.
Harry raised a brow curiously. Normally he didn't go to the Leaky – or anywhere in public really – without at least one of his friends to chase off overeager fans, but tonight, Ron and Hermione had a special dinner planned, Neville was on a date with Hannah, Dean and Seamus were having a night in, and even Luna and Ginny were off doing other things. Thus...
Hermione raised her brows. “Did you run into Cho and, erm...” She also trailed off, not wanting to force Harry to admit to anything in front of several unwanted witnesses. To her surprise, Harry sat down in the wooden chair next to her and rested his head on her shoulder.
Hermione kissed Harry on the cheek. “How about we give you two time to eat breakfast, and then you can meet us at the burrow in a half an hour or so?”
Feeling like he could quite happily hex the lot of them into slugs to stomp on, Harry grabbed Draco by the scruff and hauled him to his feet. “Come on!”
Draco couldn't help but wince at the sound of the name, not even despite the fact that he was more or less expecting it, since it was well known that Dumbledore was too cocky to fear saying the name.
Draco looked entirely way too gleeful to hear that, gloating at Harry. “I didn't know.”
“First of all,” Blaise stated as he pulled Ron into the privacy of the alcove with him. “I'm not asking you to betray a trust, so just listen to what I have to say. If I'm right, there's a certain someone who's been a brooding and moody bastard all of Eighth Year. Someone who's thoroughly annoyed us all because he SHOULD be a smug and triumphant bastard, but he's not.”
Draco feigned being scandalized. “Language Potter! Would you kiss your mother with that mouth?”
Once ready, Harry ordered the Sixth Years to get to their starting points, and then shot off another gorgeous firework.
Harry shrugged. “I dunno. I guess I am. I er... No. I'm not,” he finished, shaking his head.
Harry wasn't quite sure how – as he was panting and heaving in recovery – but Dumbledore got Harry out of the way and magicked a golden statue to protect him. As Harry calmed down a bit, although his head still hurt quite a lot, he managed to pull down his shirt and put on his pants and trousers.
Through an act of INSANE luck, Harry – once he yanked his wand up and broke the weird golden bond between them – managed to run over to Cedric – dodging spells left and right – until he dove onto Cedric's body and – just as Voldemort was ONCE AGAIN about to cast the Killing Curse – summoned the cup and was gone.
Draco had a brow raised as he watched this scene unfold. He knew his parents felt indebted to
Harry was laughing and shaking his head at Draco. “You're terrible!”
to be sung, Draco clearly did not give a fuck as he sang it – to the actual music with no changes – in an almost operatic tone of voice. A male opera singer, meaning not a soprano or even a mezzo, but not quite a full tenor either. Harry wasn't sure what the range he was singing in was called, but it was bloody fucking
Lily and Pearl stood by to each toss a different potion onto a large pile of spell ingredients, which was meant (among other things) to activate a brief portal. The moment they tossed the potions – the glass bottles shattering the contents over the spell ingredients – a small explosion caused a bright flash that blinded them all for a moment. When they had the ability to look again, a glowing lavender oval floated before them.
Draco shook his head. Then he sighed. “I'm just really busy this year, so unless we're going to do something productive, I think I'll just go to bed and rest up for...” Again he trailed off and refused to say anything more.
Draco couldn't help but laugh as Harry hit his head on the bed while trying to stand so he could pull up his trousers. “That's alright. I've suddenly realized that I have nothing better to do than lay in your bed, snoop through your belongings, and pretend my hand is you until you get home.”
“Right,” Harry agreed in frustration, running a hand through his hair in a way that unconsciously fluffed up the back.
Draco didn't know what to say to that. Thankfully, before he had to decide, a stag Patronus ran into the room. They all stared at him in surprise for a moment.
Tearing at his hair and seriously wondering if he would be able to find a way to murder Peeves for putting him through this, Draco shook his head, desperately trying to NOT sing anything else, but it burst forth anyway.
“Can't really see anything in it for me,” Nott informed them.
Ron looked rather amused. “Just try not to tickle me.”
Draco glanced around. Harry knew that he was checking for signs of teachers. Then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice: “You're dead, Potter.”
“Who said it wasn't love?” An unexpected voice startled him so much that he dropped his favorite guitar.
“I just knew, Pansy luv, that you'd bet or dare or otherwise coerce me onto stage at some point so that I could sing one of your insipid love songs, so I decided to be proactive and get on the list before you could try anything.”
“Yeah,” Theo agreed with her, his arm around his fiancée. “I've got a good woman I can shag if that's all I want, but that's not the point now is it?”
Terry sighed reluctantly. “Fine, I agree that perhaps the dares shouldn't break rules so publicly like that.”
“Alright, as you were told, you're doing a special training mission,” Ginger began. “It's NOT intended to turn into any sort of dramatic wand fight or sting operation. Hell! We're probably not even going to make any arrests. All we're doing is gathering information. See, there's a place in Knockturn Alley that sells a particular potion. We're not certain if it should be illegal or not. As far as we can tell, it's just a weak lust potion, and everyone in the place is theoretically consenting, so all we really need to determine is if anyone is given this potion against their will – like it gets slipped in their drink or something – OR if the effects are so much stronger than we've heard that it's definitely illegal. And also, see this picture?”
And with that, Draco gave into the urge to break Harry's nose by stomping on it hard enough to do just that. “That's for my father. Now let's see...” he trailed off as he grabbed the invisibility cloak out from under Harry. With it not in use and the inside of it face up, it was clearly visible to see. He tossed it over Harry's body, bloody nose and all. “I don't reckon they'll find you 'til the train's back in London. See you around, Potter... or not.”
Draco had no idea how he made it through the rest of the celebration, but he managed it somehow. Then eventually, he was allowed to go to bed and get some rest. His mother promised him that he wouldn't be doing anything stressful until he stopped looking so thin and malnourished. Grateful, he kissed her on the cheek and vowed to stay in bed unless he absolutely HAD to leave it.
Draco didn't answer for a moment because he was too busy sucking on Harry's nipples to moans of encouragement. “Hmm? Oh, the writing squeezes itself close to my wrist so that I can read it.”
“Pr'bl'm?” Draco asked in a slur.
Just when Draco reached for Harry's belt, he managed to remember that they were in a rather public place with no real guarantee of privacy. He stopped Draco by grabbing his wrist. Draco looked upset to be denied.
Harry placed the clay on the wheel and tapped it to center it. He'd taken Ginny's advice on attempting to relax by taking a class to make a simple pot, even though he hadn't thought for a moment that it would help. She'd suggested that he learn a hobby to occupy his mind, and he'd scoffed, assuming that there wasn't a hobby on Earth relaxing enough to stop him from thinking about how he'd ruined his life by quitting his promising career as an Auror.
Meanwhile, Harry was positively glaring at Draco, his shirt smoking just a little bit again. Ron burst out laughing and dragged Harry off to a corner as the first person on the Karaoke list was called up and prepared to start their song. When they were alone, they took advantage of the temporary quiet to have a whispered conversation.
Draco looked at Harry, noticing that Harry now looked afraid that he was about to be tossed out on his arse and never talked to again. He wrapped his arms around Harry a bit tighter and shook his head.
Draco's mouth dropped open in surprise. “Wha...?”
Ron raised an amused brow as he realized that this was why Harry had run straight to the shower. Deciding that he needed one as well, he pulled off all his clothes – tossing them in the hamper on top of Harry's, and stepped up to the shower right next to him.
That same thing that made Harry's brain go offline whenever he saw Draco took over, making him grab the Slytherin prat and pull him close for a demanding kiss. Relieved, Draco pushed Harry into the nearest stall, giving them a bit of privacy should any other boys happen to come into the bathroom. After that, they snogged for so long that they probably missed a class. Harry could only pray that it wasn't Umbridge's – who would give him detention even if he claimed to be laying on the bathroom floor vomiting up his guts.
Since this would make both of them happy, Draco didn't object to being ordered around. That said, just to be a shit, he decided to follow orders in the most teasing way possible. He licked Harry's shaft, pressed little kisses along its rigid length, sucked lightly on his bollocks, and used a hand to slowly pump him without actually trying to get him off.
Harry's eyes went wide in shock and he immediately looked at Hermione. “Mione?”
Sighing, Draco visibly relaxed and returned the kiss until Harry remembered that he had Divination and rushed off before he was late.
Draco felt about a thousand percent better than he had last night. He smiled at Harry and gave him a kiss. “Good morning.”
She made a sound of protest for a moment before shrugging and surrendering to the kiss.
By this time, Theo had finished singing and Blaise was taking a turn. “I'm gonna fight 'em off, a
“Draco!”
“But you didn't seem to be happy with me anymore, so I thought maybe I should just wait until,” he sighed and shook his head. “I dunno, I made you happy again.” Harry held Draco tighter and rested his head on Draco's chest. “But then you said you were going home, and that word made my heart hurt. I want you to think of HERE as your home! I don't want you to ever leave!”
“That's correct!” Blaise confirmed with an expression just shy of being gobsmacked.
Narcissa gently ventured a question. “Do you mean to say that you've been dating Harry Potter?”
Anaya put a hand on his arm to comfort him. “I don't think daddy will really be mad, so he'll stop dad from murdering us.” When they weren't in school, they often called Draco dad, even though he technically wasn't for most of them. Being married to Harry made him sort of their dad, and so they considered him that when he wasn't terrorizing them as their potions professor.
“Harry! What are you doing here?” He blurted out, highly flustered.
Harry nodded shyly.
Miraculously, they did as they were told. Perhaps they understood that Draco didn't really have a choice in the matter. Or maybe Harry just didn't want to force his hand at the moment. Either way, Draco was able march into the dungeon and drag Griphook away.
Draco gave him a look of profound sadness. “I'm so sorry about that. I was desperate and felt like I was running out of options. Hurting you at that point in time could have helped my parents...”
Draco threw a pillow at him. “Fuck you, Potter! I'll consider speaking to my parents again when they apologize for the last – OH... – three or four YEARS of my life!”
And with that set, Draco spent the next five minutes using a special powder that covered his Dark Mark with a dragon tattoo that couldn't be simply wiped away. Nor could it be ended – like a glamour – with a Finite Incantatum. It could only be removed by a special remover, thus even if Harry tried to wash his arm (or they snuck off to the Prefect's bathroom for an interesting bath), the tattoo would remain.
So, gathering up all his courage, Harry asked: “Aunt Petunia? What does that say?”
“Right,” Ron agreed easily, pulling Harry's arm over his shoulder and yanking him to his feet. “Come on, mate. Let's get you home and in bed.”
Just then, the woman in charge of the Karaoke called up the next singer. “Draco Malfoy, get you're fit arse up here! It's
Then Draco pumped him full and literally passed out on top of him. At first, Harry simply thought that he was recovering from an orgasm and its accompanying lethargy, but no. Draco was well and truly out.
“What?” Harry blurted out softly, but since Draco had blurted it out loudly, no one heard him.
Snape lowered his wand and turned to face Draco. “It's alright, Draco, Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.”
Year Seven
Suddenly, Draco's attention was yanked to Blaise. “Oi, Draco! Get the bloody hell up here already!”
The two of them danced for a couple of hours before helping each other pick out and put on the perfect clothes. Once ready – and looking rather a lot like high class fashion models – they Apparated to the Leaky Cauldron.
Draco spun to hex him for being an irritation when he was already quite vexed. Harry looked like he was silently daring Draco to tell him what he was actually up to, but before Draco could so much as mutter a hex, the Heads of House all shouted for them to be quiet.
Ginger crossed their paths, quietly ordering them to: “Mingle and ask questions!”
Draco was torn between being relieved and upset when he alone was allowed to leave the house arrest they'd all been placed under. Even Bella, who hadn't been physically punished, was still in hot water and confined to the Manor. The fact of the matter was that Draco alone had a way in which he could still be useful, and that was going back to school and torturing as many rebellious students as he could. Knowing that his family would suffer if he didn't, he cast aside all of his emotions and really threw himself into the task.
Now he couldn't stop thinking about how Draco was literally in the hands of Voldemort. How he was being used to hurt and torture people. How he probably had no one he could confide in or seek comfort from.
With a disgruntled sigh, Ron rushed to their sides.
“Hey! If you're not singing, you had better be
Then Harry stood up straight. “But you said that for NOW, you're single. That means that you have no reason NOT to go back to mine for the night.”
Harry decided the time was right to regain control of the conversation. “Yeah, but what if I don't need any of that? I already have two vaults full of gold, and I can't imagine needing to inherit anything several decades from now.”
Harry was now humming in thought as he examined every millimeter of the dragon. “Hmm... I guess I would have assumed that you'd get a really colorful tattoo of a dragon in Slytherin colors, but this is plain black. That said, it's done in a stylistic way that makes it look really good.”
“Then fucking MARRY ME!!!” Harry roared angrily. “As THAT'S the only way I'm ever going to be any happier than I already am right now!”
That night, Draco fell into his bed in exhaustion. He wanted nothing more than to pass out and never wake up. To his surprise, there was a very faint tickling on his arm.
Which meant that after his last DADA meeting right before school let out for the three week Christmas break, when Cho pointed out the mistletoe and then kissed him, Harry didn't feel any sort of guilt. In fact, he was more than half convinced that he and Draco had the other – NOT romantic – form of Soulmate Bond. Thus, there was nothing to feel guilty about.
“I already made plans with my friends before we got together, and had you said you were coming home early tonight, I'd have canceled on them, but since you're not... I think I'll go. Erm...”
Draco looked a strange cross between gleeful to hear that and confused by the situation. “I didn't know, but erm, sir? A rack???”
“Are you avoiding me?” Pansy demanded as she exited the floo into his room.
Draco harrumphed and pulled Harry close for a nice long kiss. Sighing happily, Harry relaxed into it, deciding not to think about anything else at all for the rest of the night. Sensing that something was different, Draco decided to push his luck. He slowly slid a hand down Harry's chest, and this time, Harry let him unbuckle his belt.
“Why am I so emotional? This is not a good look, gain some self control! And deep down, I know this never works, but you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt.”
Sighing, Draco finally admitted to himself that he was too scared to think about what it might mean if they DID get into a relationship, so, he got dressed and Apparated home long before Harry got off work. Then he spent nearly the entire next month hiding in his room playing his piano and singing and dancing as much as he liked.
Ron was busy inhaling his bacon sandwiches and nudged Harry to wake him back up before their lunch period passed and Harry had to starve.
“He's more or less fine. Certainly no worse off than if he'd gotten drunk off his arse,” the Mediwitch pronounced after a thorough examination. She then pointed at Ron – both of them had long since changed back. “And that one is in even better condition. Barely even tipsy at this point. The potion is probably designed to wear off quickly so that people will keep buying more drops.”
Harry, grasping his wand desperately, rolled onto his back so that he could try to expel Voldemort's wand from his hand – and thereby end the tickling. Weirdly, in addition to using his wand to tickle Harry, Voldemort was now also using the toes of his bare foot.
“No I haven't!” Draco roared angrily. “We hadn't even gone to bed when I asked her to marry me!”
The expression on Borgin's face turned to pure fear. Draco felt it might be best to state the obvious. “Tell anyone, and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He's a family friend. He'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you're giving the problem your full attention.”
“I have a feeling that she took more than a quick look when she Polyjuiced into me, so really, how mad can she possibly get?” Harry wondered, also quickly getting dressed.
Draco kept his eyes on her so that he wasn't tempted to look over at the person he was actually singing this song to. Especially with lyrics like: “Help me! Tear down my reason. Help me! It's your sex I can smell. Help me! You make me perfect. Help me become somebody else!”
“I'll take it!” The bloke cried out happily.
Still, he
Narcissa had probably been quietly snickering over her son's words, but she decided that a show of support was definitely called for. She stepped forward and fixed her cold gaze on Harry and his weasel.
Harry paused a moment to think this over. If he was honest, he'd actually REALLY liked kissing Draco. Smiling a bit shyly, despite being alone in his bed with the curtains shut, he shrugged.
Harry gasped from uncontrollable laughter, rolling around in an attempt to escape, but Snape was surprisingly able to keep up with him. He was too weak to jump to his feet and run away – considering that he was still suffering from all the attacks on him over the past hour – but that didn't mean he just took it in silence.
Harry sighed in frustration. “Madam Pomfrey says that she's tried everything she could to break this curse. Bill has too. And they both say that because it was some sort of accidental jumble, nothing breaks it. It must have a very specific countercurse, but only the person who cast it would know what it is, and since it seems to have been an accident, THEY might not even know it either.”
to hear what her sister suggested next.
No one really managed anything – aside from Susan Bones splinching her left leg off – that first lesson, and everyone left feeling dispirited.
Pansy looked him up and down. “
” Harry repeated indignantly. “
“HOT DAMN!” Astoria burst out in appreciation. “I'm going to have to try that next!”
Saw an expression of confusion settle over Draco's face. “Green...?”
Minerva flinched. “Oh! Well, that bat-bogey hex certainly worked! Poor Miss Fletcher...”
“You... what???” Draco asked in confusion. He COULDN'T have heard that right.
“If you are planning to be naughty, Peeves wants in on it!”
Draco's legs started to shake and he had to grip the shelf behind his hips in order to remain upright. “Merlin, fuck! Salazar! Potter, if you don't stop, I'm going to – to –” he was cut short by a groan of sheer pleasure. His bollocks tightened as a feeling like electricity went up his spine. His toes even curled!
Astoria grinned at Draco. “You didn't know? Your parents sent a request for my hand to my parents earlier this week. As far as my parents are concerned, all they have to do is have their lawyers draft an acceptable contract, and the deal is as good as done.”
Hermione huffed a laugh. “It doesn't have to be stupid things! Although I'm certain you boys will write stupid things. You could always write something like: I dare you to tell the truth about something in particular, or I dare you to help me finish my potions essay.”
Ron gave him a long and appraising look, and then nodded his head slightly. “So if it's harmless, what's it do?”
Dumbledore was occasionally sliding bit by bit down the wall he was leaning against. “As a matter of fact, I did,” he said. “I was sure it was you.”
Harry squinted suspiciously. “You do believe me, don't you?”
Harry certainly couldn't argue that at the moment. Draco gave him a quick smooch. Then he frowned a bit.
“Well count me out!” Hermione muttered fervently. "I have no need to waste any time on such foolishness when I have homework to do!”
Harry rested his head on Draco's shoulder for a moment. “Yeah... Tickle me?”
iiin my skiiiiin, these woounds they wiill not heaaal, feeear is how I faaall, confuusing whaat is reaaaaaaal...”
They ALL finished up the summoning with: “Hear us – oh ancestors – and take form so that you can temporarily visit us!”
Before he could say a word or take a breath, he was up and marching to the front of the room where Draco sat with his brethren. Almost certain that his face was making the same expression it would make if he was in front of a firing squad, Harry grabbed Draco firmly by his arm and yanked him off his stool. THANK MERLIN that he had enough control to drag him to the storage cupboard.
Thoroughly uncomfortable, but now more or less certain that Harry wouldn't come to attack Draco again, Snape silently rose from the chair and returned to his quarters.
It was Harry's turn to look gobsmacked! Draco stood up straight again and laughed softly. He felt so light and happy that he lifted Harry off his feet and squeezed him tight as he swayed side to side. This made Harry laugh and resume kissing Draco. Until McGonagall insisted that they take their rather shocking passion someplace private.
“Do what?” Draco asked with a deep curiosity that he just couldn't suppress.
“I'm almost afraid to ask,” Ernie muttered warily.
Ron patted Seamus on the back sympathetically even as Harry quickly stepped around him and grabbed his pajamas out of his trunk so that he could get dressed and crawl into the privacy of his bed before anyone else showed up.
He was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not. Whenever he was in company, he wanted to get away, and whenever he was alone, he wanted company. He thought he really might go and visit Hagrid since he had not talked to him properly since the half giant's return.
Meanwhile, Peeves was rolling around near the ceiling in manic anticipation, rehearsing a bit of a ditty to sing during the distraction.
Draco was curious enough to push aside his misgivings and ask: “But what?”
“Oh stop!” He shoved her away playfully. “Either dance with me or go away!”
Thanks to Lady of Moon over Silver Seas for this irresistible plot bunny ^_^
Thanks to Hermione coming to pick him up each week, Snape hadn't succumbed to the curse again. This time, they hadn't even started yet, and Harry suspected that Snape was considering tickling him ON PURPOSE – and not because of the curse. The look on Snape's face certainly suggested that he was considering it.
Sighing in relief, Harry went into his assigned room to find Ron and Hermione beyond happy to see him. Hermione practically attacked him with a hug, babbling at high speeds as she squeezed him tight for a moment.
Feeling like his toes were going to curl right up his legs and into his arse if Harry didn't stop, Draco yanked him to his feet and stared at him with wide eyes for a long moment, trying to think of
Harry was giving Hermione a pleading look, but she could only shrug as she had no idea how to stop things – having already tried a couple of spells to end active magic, which failed.
Ron raised a brow in amusement. A glance over at Ginger showed that she'd gotten closer to them so that she could watch the show – which was actually so that she could verify in her report that they did in fact do as ordered and take the potion. Taking a deep breath, Harry licked the nine drops of Lust Potion off Ron's cleavage, making Ron moan in surprise.
Draco bristled until Harry ran a hand down his spine and pressed a kiss to his shoulder. “Hmm... I think this conversation would best be conducted outside. Ladies, what do you think? Bonfire?”
She laughed. “Well, yes and no. You'll WANT to, but you wouldn't strip your boyfriend off and have your way with him in front of everyone like an animal. You'd have to take ALL of that original large bottle of potion before you got to the point where you'd lose control of your actions. Every drop you take up to that point simply enhances the fun.”
do you plan to tell us who in the bloody hell this bloke you're dating is?”
Harry shook his head. “No, not AFTER. We both know that changing into others can hurt if the clothes are too tight.”
The Hufflepuffs made their way to the north side of the Maze while the Ravenclaws headed to the east side. The Gryffindors trekked south, which left the Slytherins marching to the west. The Sixth Years cheered on their Fourth Year Housemates from the stands of the Quidditch Stadium – which was where the Maze had been constructed. Parents were given the choice between literally walking on top of the walls or flying around on brooms, and they'd divided fairly evenly in half between the two. Once everyone was in place, Harry shot off an impressive dragon firework provided by Ron and George.
Draco sat watching the lake with everyone else. This part was actually pretty boring. That said, the people in charge of the event FINALLY got around to telling everyone what was going on. It seems that each Champion had someone important to them – apparently their MOST important person – taken hostage. Their task was simple: rescue the person before time ran out.
She sighed in disappointment. “Well then, I think I'll go dance for a bit before I make any irrevocable decisions.”
Come the first day of lessons, Harry showed up as prepared as possible. He'd had Hermione renew the fuzzy spell just as he left Gryffindor Tower, praying that it held for the full hour since Snape said he refused to give more of his time than that. He also had his cloak with him so that he could use it to get back to Gryffindor Tower unmolested if necessary.
“Aw, come on now, don't make a big deal just because it's my turn,” Harry begged with a becoming pout.
When September passed and October was in bloom, the Vanishing Cabinet was proving to be so difficult to fix that Draco decided he had to give himself a break and try something else. So, he sent an owl to Borgin and Burkes ordering a cursed opal necklace. It was delivered to him at Hogsmeade and he promptly took it to the Three Broomsticks so that he could Imperius someone into delivering it for him.
Draco couldn't help but chuckle. “Well, I wouldn't mind a cuppa.”
Harry smirked at him, thinking that it wouldn't be bad to be the bottom partner again, since this had been seriously brilliant. Then he sighed a bit morosely. “We should probably get to our dorms before...”
Increasingly, Draco wished that he could just skive off all classes and more or less move into the Room of Hidden Things. Not even his infrequent breaks to go to the Sixth Floor Boys' Bathroom to cry his heart out to a surprisingly sympathetic ghost named Myrtle truly soothed his rising sense of panic.
“Not shy?” Auror Ginger asked, mildly impressed.
Even more slowly, Harry felt a frown grow deeper across his face. Sure, this potentially COULD teach Draco an important lesson, but was it really right to just let some witch ruin his life like this for nothing more than a tiny bit of revenge over a slight?
When Harry was laying face down on the ground after surrendering himself to Voldemort and being hit with the Unforgivable Killing Curse... After going to a sort of limbo and having a shockingly forthcoming conversation with Dumbledore, he cracked his eyes open ever so slightly to see Narcissa bending down over him to see if he was dead.
Draco narrowed his eyes and inspected the empty mug he'd taken from Harry. “I should've known...”
“I FUCKING CAN TOO!” Blaise shouted, pointing at Pansy and gesturing emphatically for her to join him on the floor. “PANS! GET OVER HERE AND HELP ME PROVE THAT WE'RE BETTER DANCERS THAN DRACO!”
“It's 100 laps AND 25 burpees!” Their instructor roared as he pointed at the clock.
When he rushed into the first class of the day, it was to find everyone staring at him with mischievous grins.
Pansy rubbed herself against him. “Draco, Darling,
Fifth Year – Still Harry
Ginger smacked both their rears after the three of them accepted their drinks – which Harry and Ron spiked with a dose of Polyjuice. “I don't care if you can't dance to save your lives, drink up and get your arses out there!”
“Being licked!” Astoria exclaimed. “Never been
JUST when it looked like another Slytherin was setting herself up to be right in the exit to summon the flag and win the challenge, Sai shouted out a summoning spell for his broom, jumped on it as it arrived, flew after the flag, grabbed it, cast an anti-summoning spell on it, and flew it out of the Maze.
With a look like he'd rather suffer the Cruciatus Curse, Lucius sighed, nodded in acceptance, and walked away, his wife glowing from parental pride as she followed him. Meanwhile, having forgotten all about the elder Malfoys, Draco Apparated Harry back to his bed as previously suggested, and stayed there for the rest of time. Mostly.
Draco moaned in longing, not just accepting the kiss he wanted so badly, but escalating it as much as Harry would let him. A suddenly sense of queasiness alerted him to the fact that Harry had Apparated them somewhere. He opened his eyes and looked around for a moment before Harry lifted him up out of a chair and pressed him into the bed they were right next to.
Harry didn't answer, but Voldemort turned to give him a little bow. “We bow to each other, Harry. Come, the niceties must be observed. Dumbledore would like you to show manners... Bow to death, Harry...”
” She even lifted up his blue singlet to inspect his abs.
At one point, Blaise stepped out of the compartment because of an invitation from the new teacher, Slughorn. When he returned, Draco was interested to know what the old bastard had wanted. Even so, a flash of white as Blaise and Greg were tussling while trying to shut the door made Draco wonder if...
But he didn't dare write because he couldn't guarantee that even at a time when Draco was likely in bed sleeping, he was alone and able to receive a message from Harry without being caught. He could only assume that Draco felt the same, for he never messaged either.
“Yeah?” Harry was now confused as to why Draco looked almost...
Sighing, Harry downed his drink and held out his hand to Ron. “I suppose this means we're trying not to trip over our own feet together.” Ron looked a bit queasy even before he downed his drink and joined Harry on the floor. Lucky for them, all they really had to do was bounce to the beat.
Madam Pomfrey – who had somehow been immune to the curse – quickly scanned Harry and discovered that he had some sort of garbled curse on him that she couldn't untangle and get rid of. The best she could do was cast a spell to curb the effects of it on Ron and Hermione, and then promise to research ways to break the curse by the time he returned in the fall.. Needless to say, Harry was allowed to ride his broom with only Dumbledore as an escort back to Privet Drive that year.
“We THINK this is the man who owns the establishment AND makes the potion we're investigating. Should you happen to spot him, let me know immediately.”
Draco couldn't help but blush and feel a little guilty. “Oh come now, mother! I'm 21, surely you can't expect me to be entirely celibate.”
When they were done and had collapsed into a pile of boneless meat, Draco took the opportunity to snuggle with Harry. He held him close and stroked a hand up and down Harry's arm. He even hummed very very softly.
Draco smirked. “I ordered Muffy to cook.”
Since no one was currently looking at him, Draco looked over at Harry, who despite probably not being able to see clearly due to the fact that his eyes were almost swollen shut, compulsively looked over at Draco. They both knew what Draco had done to those two at Voldemort's command. Also, it was the last time they had written to each other. Hastily, both looked away.
After everyone laughed for a bit, James put a hand on Harry's shoulder. “So, son, aside from marrying a pretty blond arsehole and having a LOT of kids, what have you been up to?”
“Ooo!” Several people burst out. “Who you want to date, Harry?! Is it me? I promise I'll say yes!”
The lesson was... weird. It consisted of Snape trying to break into Harry's mind and Harry trying to defend himself – and supposedly in the process, learning how to defend his mind from such attacks at all times.
Happy to discover naked flesh under his hands, Harry caressed everything. He also pressed lots of tiny kisses to places like Draco's neck and shoulders. Soft moaning encouraged him to leave little bruises until Draco almost looked like he'd been pummeled by a hailstorm.
Not needing to be asked twice, Harry grabbed his cloak and rushed off to the same classroom he and Draco had been occasionally meeting in for months now. Draco himself looked almost demonic with a weary red tinge to his eyes. They had barely shut and locked the door when they flung their arms around each other and simply held one another tightly.
His parents exchanged an alarmed look even as Draco resumed his quest to murder every object in the room with as much prejudice as possible.
Draco had to be seen as doing everything he could to stop Harry, even so, he was profoundly grateful that he knew how to cast spells nonverbally. In fact, he was rather good at it by this point. So, while aiming at Harry with what hopefully looked like deadly intent, he simply cast a harmless spell. It was actually a cheering charm, but Harry had other spells to dodge and threw himself to the floor and rolled to the safety of behind the sofa.
“Mum wants me to be home for breakfast so we can spend tomorrow together,” he lied smoothly.
“I do!” Harry roared.
As Harry was once again on his hands and knees on the floor panting, Snape looked at his watch. “Our hour is up...”
“Oh no,” Ron muttered reluctantly. The packet was a product from his brothers' shop.
“Definitely!” Ginny agreed with a grin. The others agreed with cheers, rushing to clear the table and bring their wine with them.
The entire next week consisted of an owl showing up each morning asking Draco to please come home and Draco replying with a curt: no.
One day, something happened that made Harry sigh in relief. In class, they read a story about a pair of boy girl twins meeting an imaginary friend and going with him into an imaginary world that was full of adventures.
Draco raised his brow and gave her a
Draco felt like he was punched in the chest. No! Full body slammed by a wall! All of the emotions that he'd had to lock up and deny for so long came flooding back into him without warning, making him stagger a bit and cry and blubber, chanting the word: “Yes!” Over and over until Harry silenced him with a fiery kiss.
Still very confused, Draco found himself singing again. “It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy, 'cuz every now and then I kick the living shit out of me!” He blushed lightly and glanced over to the Head Table, hoping no one docked him points for lyrics that were beyond his control. “When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell, when you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell!”
Somehow, he thought that if Harry knew, it would be that one thing too far that made him reject Draco once and for all. As much as he wanted to punch Harry hard enough to break his nose, he didn't actually want the two of them to never speak again. Why in the bloody hell did he have to be bonded to the ONE person in the world he couldn't actually be with?! Life just wasn't fair sometimes...
“Maybe to a Slytherin, but I'm a Gryffindor, remember?” Harry reminded him before stealing a kiss while Draco's eyes were still closed.
Harry stopped just in front of the door to look back at him. “What would be the point? They're all hand me downs from my cousin, and so, WAY too big for me. They don't stay up and make me look like I'm wearing a diaper with the way they bunch up in my trousers.”
The moment they were out of the bathroom, Snape cast a lightening spell on him, scooped him into his arms, and practically flew him over to the stairs, down two floors, and into the hospital wing. Draco was still more or less out of it when he was tucked into a bed and Snape explained what happened to him. Madam Pomfrey quickly got to work and Draco fell asleep – probably a magical one brought about by the Mediwitch.
Hermione shook her head and hugged him. “Not at all. You can love whomever you want. I just meant that WE were vastly unprepared to pop in to find the two of you naked and curled up so sweetly.”
But Draco was too busy trying to determine if any of his lackeys were close enough to force him to actually do what he was supposed to do.
Draco gave a half shrug. “I have someone I want to be with more than anything, and I'm NOT going to give him up just because my parents would never accept it.”
Draco stood up and brought his dishes to the sink, vanishing the last of the food off his plate as he did so. Then – before he could change his mind, he headed toward the fire and took a pinch of floo powder from the pot.
And then finally, he got to the point: “And here his is... the boy you all believed had been my downfall...”
“Alright fine,” Harry gave in with a sense of helplessness. He honestly had no idea how to dissuade them. “So what did you have in mind?”
She was silent as she chewed on her bottom lip in thought for a long moment. “Well... I suppose... no. You said he seemed to have a bit of control. He dragged you to someplace private, and then used gentle methods that you actually enjoyed. I'd say – like the example I used of Cho kissing you – I'd say that if he licked and shagged you, it's because he wanted to.”
Strangely, since they
Harry and Ron exchanged a questioning look, and then shrugged. “Alright then.”
Seeing someone who interested him, Draco strode confidently up to the bloke. Halfway there, an enormous man who looked like he could be paid to pick normal sized men up and tie them in knots with his bare hands stepped in Draco's path. He was leering most unpleasantly and dared to grab Draco by the arm.
“OH-HO!” Both Pansy and Blaise blurted out in delighted surprise. “Who's this now?”
Harry frowned. “Woooould that be so bad...?”
But Narcissa cut her off. “Please Miss Parkinson. While I appreciate your concern for my son, please consider your words carefully.”
The next song was sung by all the girls from Slytherin currently in the pub. It was in a different language except for the repeated title lyric:
“IF YOU'RE LATE FOR CLASS, YOU'LL BE REQUIRED TO RUN AN EXTRA HUNDRED LAPS!” The Alarm Charm warned.
Draco rolled his eyes and looked away. “I have to bottom until I receive a nice deposit of semen, and whether or not I have any fun with it is irrelevant. I mean I usually do, but that's not important to the curse. The curse was cast by someone who apparently hoped I'd hate every minute of it and fight it as much as possible. See, if I'm too busy being a slaggy cock whore, then I can't settle down and get married and work on an heir – so whether I die directly or my line ends with me, the result is the same. The end of the Malfoy line. It's a clever curse, I'll give them that...”
Now Harry looked at a loss. “You... didn't give it to Katie?”
To Draco's amazement, Harry kept his word. He was so determined to have Draco in every way possible that he spent hours worshiping him and working him up. Draco gasped in astonishment and fell apart at least three times before finally
“Well now, Astoria, you seem to be getting into the spirit of things for your first time here,” Draco drawled with a smoky grin as he gestured for a gorgeous woman with long and riotously curly black hair to administer the drop.
“So...
Draco turned around abruptly so that he was thoroughly tangled with Harry and holding him like a precious treasure. “You mean that?”
With a shrug, the target slipped out of his chair and followed Draco out of the club.
Harry grabbed him by the arm before he could run away. “You what?”
Looking rather horrified to suddenly be the center of attention, Draco took a deep breath and tried to step down, but he couldn't. Without warning, his mouth opened and his rather posh and smooth voice burst forth.
The front page was unsurprisingly devoted to Harry.
Harry kissed Draco again and they got lost in it for several long moments, until it occurred to Harry to wonder why his Alarm Charm hadn't gone off yet, and THAT reminded him that he had preemptively turned it off when he woke up so that it wouldn't wake Draco. “FUCK! I'm probably late!” Harry wailed in dismay before stealing another quick kiss. “I've gotta go! See you tomorrow night?”
Draco felt all alone and a bit lonely, ever since his parents had left for an extended world vacation. When they'd first left, he'd been elated to be on his own and able to do whatever he wanted. Now he just wanted them to come home so that he could talk to them and see if maybe THEY could figure out the mess he found himself in.
Every night for a week, he and his best friends returned to the club because Harry wasn't ready to just give up. He simply wanted to find someone that felt right in some way before taking such a big step. His friends were tireless in their support, understanding since neither of them had ever really been in a position of just picking a stranger for the night.
At one point, James2 got his grandfather alone and asked his most pressing question: “How in the bloody hell did you Marauders pull off the Portkey Prank of '76???”
Hermione gave him a far too knowing look. “Harry, it's not really a choice. If you are interested in blokes, then you're probably going to fall in love with one, and once you fall in love, gender doesn't matter.”
“Well, the first few drops probably won't feel much different than the horniness you were
“ME TOO!” Several others called out in agreement.
“I only do that to get you to pay attention to me,” Draco informed him before looking rather shocked. He then seemed like he was trying hard to take it back but couldn't.
Harry breath was inexplicable ragged now. “Malfoy???” He gasped out softly, not sure what to say or how to respond.
Of course, Draco couldn't just NOT taunt Harry too: “Hey, Potter, how's your scar feeling? Sure you don't need a lie-down? It must be, what? A whole week since you were in the hospital wing; that's a record for you, isn't it?”
Hermione and Ernie Macmillan were talking about Umbridge throwing a fit when she couldn't get into Dumbledore's office, Hermione saying: “Oh I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head's office. Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed up, power crazy old –”
Narcissa looked perilously close to tears as she swept Draco's normally gorgeous but currently matted hair out of his face. “Oh Draco...” she whispered emotionally.
“It seems my luck is better than expected tonight,” Draco murmured pensively before downing the rest of his stolen drink and holding up a hand to signal a waitress to attend them. “I'd like a bottle of that Albariño that's ordered especially for me, and go ahead and put whatever Potter wants on my tab for the rest of the night.”
Draco squinted and wracked his brains to see if he could figure out WHO was usually so habitually late that they counted on it. Before he could come up with an answer, an elf popped into the room with the LAST person he would have ever expected.
After that, the conversation was over.
Draco gently forced Harry to turn his head to the side so that he had access to his neck. Once again using his tongue, he flicked a very light path all along where Harry's neck met his shoulder. When Draco unexpectedly latched on and sucked rather strongly, Harry didn't even care that Draco's other hand's fingers were now making a sort of light galloping motion on his belly. The tiny shocks of tickling – that normally made Harry shriek with laughter and try to get away – simply exacerbated that problem with his breathing. He moaned and it sounded... like he wanted more...
Harry caressed his forearm tenderly before forcing himself to try to get some sleep. He needed it after all.
He took a deep breath. “Alright Potter. If you're serious enough to marry me, then I'll honor my vows and never leave. Er well, I might need to leave your side temporarily to vent anger or do things, but not... permanently...”
“I think it's actually working,” Ron murmured. “I'm getting rather...”
“Peeves!” McGonagall cried out sternly, but he stuck his tongue out at her and blew a raspberry before flying out of the Hall – just far enough that she likely wouldn't chase him.
Draco chuckled. “Sorry, but that's NOT something I'm prepared to do tonight.”
Dolohov both nodded and shrugged. “Well, yes. Dumbledore IS dead. However, young Malfoy here, despite leading the mission rather well, seemed to falter at the last moment, and so, Snape burst onto the tower and cast the curse before any of us could really do anything to stop him. To be honest, I didn't think he had it in him, and so, it didn't really occur to me to intervene.”
Pansy decided that this was going to be fun for her, so she sat on his lap and gave him a flirty kiss. “You look like someone I know, for some reason... Mmm... In any case, there's no particular NEED to do these drops to get horny, they're just fun. An interesting diversion on an otherwise boring night. Don't you ever get tired of doing the same things every day? Don't you ever WANT to just say
Nearly the whole month until he had to go to King's Cross passed before he realized that he hadn't received anything new from his imaginary friend. Had he or she stopped existing? Excited and nervous about this new chapter of his life, Harry did something he'd never done before: he wrote first.
Draco threw a handful of mini bombs at Harry's face. “You arsehole!” He threw another handful just as the first handful hit Harry, taking him by surprise and stinging more than anything. “You bastard! Fucking prick! Wanker!” With each insult, he tossed more of the bombs at Harry, now aiming for other places as Harry was trying to dodge them.
Draco gasped and then stuttered: “Wait! But! But!” Quite abruptly, his knees seemed to go weak and he slumped against the shelf. “Merlin's crooked prick! That feels so good!”
Harry frowned since it was summer. “Why?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Because you did a rather shoddy job and the upholstery from the chair you used is still clearly visible in random places.”
Harry snorted. “More like fate screwing with me.”
With infinite tenderness, Harry pulled Draco onto the bed, settling them both so that – despite being fully dressed – they could actually fall asleep in each other's arms. This was when Draco surprised Harry with a soft kiss.
“Er...” Harry bit his lip in thought and looked over to see that Draco was currently bending his head to the side so that Blaise could lick a drop off his neck. He pointed at Ron's neck. “There is good.”
Draco couldn't help it, he was bloody impressed! And relieved. So relieved that he broke his promise to himself.
Encouraged, Draco pulled Harry closer and – without breaking off their kiss – gently lay them both on the ground, him on top of Harry. Then he got busy exploring that mouth that tasted like... butterbeer and treacle tart. The two of them spent probably an hour like this before Harry pushed Draco away with a gasp.
ignore his debts!”
can I keep him like that?”
Harry formed a W with his hands. “Yeah but that's that part I don't understand. You don't
and Harry was
break cover. Doing so at this point could fail him from the entire course! Still, Harry had to wonder if Draco chose these songs because he honestly felt this way, or if he just liked them. This one sounded so... real...
Before anyone could respond, the woman Blaise was licking let out a high pitch squeal and pushed him away. “Alright enough! I can't TAKE any more!” She was panting heavily and someone handed her a shot of Firewhiskey to wet her throat and calm her breathing. A moment later, she kissed Draco. “Thanks for the suggestion, luv! You were right.”
“I always want to be near you –
Draco laughed at Umbridge's statement about the castle soon being Weasley free in an odd way that gave Harry hope that he was just flattering her for his own good. It didn't really make Harry feel any better thought. In fact, the more Draco laughed at Umbridge's cruel remarks, the more enraged Harry got – until he was literally shaking from it.
here wants to tease himself with my body. Alright then, place a dozen drops up my body and enjoy the show as he licks them up.”
Harry and Ron had an entire silent conversation in a series of looks before nodding at Ginger in understanding and acceptance. Even so, Ron muttered under his breath: “Mione's going to
“So I'm just going to ask it! Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?”
“These are papers to write magical dares on,” Terry explained, turning to grin at Padma in a way that suggested that he was trying to impress her, but she simply rolled her eyes and shook her head.
“Try it,” Auror Ginger suggested with a purr.
Groaned reluctantly, Harry reached out and unfastened Draco's trouser – since his school robes were already hanging open.
Harry got another good look at him. “What happened to you? You look like you just got dragged across the entire grounds of the castle.”
That said, Vince had gotten too big for his britches – in a manner of speaking – and tried to take control and kill the entire Golden Trio. It was all Draco could do to remind him that Harry was not to be killed by ANYONE but their Lord. But it seemed like Vince had gone mad with the prospect of power and rewards, because he kept trying to kill until he cast of an out of control Fiendfyre Curse.
Harry laughed merrily. “You make a quality offer, but there's actually someone in particular that I'm trying to talk into dating me, so I'm going to have to decline.”
Both joined him for lunch with full sympathy, but Harry had almost forgotten what they were even talking about. But then he remembered and was grumpy all over again.
Narcissa reached over and took his hand. “Harry, set aside the fact that you defeated the Dark Lord and freed our family from a horrible fate – of our own making, I agree. The far more important thing is that our son told us how you saved him from dying in a Fiendfyre. As he is the most precious thing to us,
“Are you blind???” Draco questioned with a raised brow. “
But first, just before they opened the door, they kissed each other and murmured: “Good luck.”
This went on for a couple of years, and maybe because he wasn't pushing his luck too far, but his Soulmate never told him to stop again. Most of the time, she simply didn't respond, but when she did, she actually talked to him. Fortunately, her spelling and grammar got better.
Hermione quirked a brow at him. “Was your dare to tell someone a truth you don't *think* they already know?”
After a hard battle that Harry wished he'd had an unrestricted view of, Voldemort disappeared and tried to possess Harry. While literally inside Harry – and considering what had just happened, Harry actually felt a least three times more violated by this thing forcing his way inside him – Voldemort taunted Dumbledore, telling him to try and kill him while inside the boy.
“Exactly. What I really need your help with is TOMORROW night. I'm going to be spending the night somewhere and I need to find something to wear that says: I'm from a good family and worth your attention and respect, but please bloody shag me!”
Harry smiled faintly, recognizing the snark for what it was. “Well... what is this substance?”
Pearl sighed and shook her head. “This is going to take a while, and we have no idea how long they'll be here for.”
“Son... Did that Potter brat hex you?”
The mere reminder of everything he'd been through this past year almost made Draco vomit, but he managed to hold it down. After gulping and several deep breaths – all while glaring and keeping his wand aimed at Dumbledore's heart to illustrate how deadly serious he was – he answered the question. Almost compulsively.
Suddenly footsteps thundered nearer until a quartet of his minions burst through the door. From this point on, there was a lot of bickering over Draco getting on with it or stepping aside and letting someone else doing the deed. Only Antonin Dolohov MUST have been ordered to ensure that Draco – and Draco alone – do it, because he kept stopping others – such as Greyback – from impatiently doing it themselves.
In fact, they seemed to be popular choices for the body shots as an astonishing amount of people were standing around waiting for a turn to lick them. Therefore, it didn't seem odd for Harry and Ron to just randomly walk up to them and strike up a conversation. That said, they DID have to wait for an opening in the conversation in progress.
Before Draco could do more than return the kiss and grope Harry's arse in appreciation, a blaring noise interrupted them.
Narcissa laughed mischievously. “What's to explain? I should think things are rather obvious.”
Karaoke night!
When Granger sobbed out something that was likely a lie – that the sword was a copy – Draco was sent to fetch the goblin Griphook. Again grateful for the excuse to leave for a bit, Draco took his time getting to the dungeon. Half of him hoped the prisoners all listened and didn't give him trouble, which would be an excuse for the Dark Lord to punish him. The other half hoped that Harry would jump on the opportunity to lead a small rebellion, overpower him, and escape.
Harry sighed with relief so profound that he nearly passed out from it. “Good!”
Draco's plan actually relied on them holding the area at the bottom of the stairs to the Astronomy Tower and as much of the corridor as possible, so that they could get the job done and have a relatively secure exit route. Unfortunately, a bit of a fierce battle broke out as the Death Eaters tried to protect their plan and the others tried to protect the school from them.
