for help. “I just, I know you were talking about how you read that book about moonstone, it was checked out of the library so I couldn’t get it. I don’t think I exactly nailed it- and I, I just-” she trailed off, stumbling over her words.
He had honestly forgotten that tonight was Halloween. He really did, but he wasn’t going to tell Hermione that, as he didn’t think that she would believe him.
He hated having to wake up this early and mess up his routine. He hated that he wasn’t even awake by the time he was on his broom and he hated that he still had to go to class after leaving everything he had out on the pitch.
He sighed, not saying anything, just staring at her as she read through his potions essay. “I haven’t even begun marking that one-”
“Snape told me,” he said. When she looked confused, he took a deep breath and continued. “Snape told me about Harry’s dream, about Arthur Weasley. About what it means, and I am sure Harry told you.”
Potter’s voice made him nearly jump out of his skin. He had dropped his quidditch shoes and scrambled to pick them up and shove them in his bag. “I- I just, uh- I did not realize anyone was still here-”
They glanced over, and sure enough, Potter and Weasley’s cauldron was boiling over with black goop. Granger stifled a giggle.
He felt trapped. He couldn’t move, no matter how hard he tried, and it caused him to start to panic. Harry was too close to him, so close that Draco couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t think, the only thing he could concentrate on was his head and his stomach and his lungs and his chest all simultaneously screaming at him, but there was nothing he could do about it because he was trapped.
There's finally some interaction between Draco and Harry, and there will be much, much more coming up.
But why did she bother him so much? He had heard rumors about what had happened at the end of the tri-wizard tournament. There were so many stories that he didn’t know what was true and what wasn’t. It wasn’t like he was going to ask Potter himself, as he would just shove him away. He did believe that You-Know-Who was back, but he didn’t know what else to believe.
He scanned his teammates, finding a fourth year open. He chucked the ball at them, but as soon as she caught it, a bludger was shot directly at her head. She dropped the ball.
“I really do enjoy my time with you. I’ve had a great time with you tonight, and I had a great time in Diagon Alley when it was the two of us just talking about Quidditch. I want to be good friends with you, I really do, but I’ve gone and made it so hard for myself to realize that and I’ve made it so hard for you to like me and I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all the emotional distress I’ve caused you along the way, and I just want it to be over. I know it just can’t simply
“What? No, no one actually plays that. Other than first years,” one of the Hufflepuff girls scoffed.
Draco did feel bad for him, as Hermione was definitely singling him out. Sure, the rest of them really weren’t as bad, but they sort of were in the same boat.
But she even said that she only wanted to be friends with him because Potter and Weasley were too much. But now the three of them were getting along just fine again, so why did she need him?
It would be one thing if she was a Death Eater. If she looked like his Aunt Bellatrix. But no, she came off as a sickly sweet woman who liked cats and pink and ate too many cookies. And she used dark magic on her students.
“Well it certainly isn’t yours!” Draco wanted to defend himself, but he didn’t know what to say. Last year, that comment wouldn't have really hurt, but now it made his chest ache just a little bit. “Then, you just
It was the second time someone had accused them of having some sort of romantic relationship. “No,” he said as he finally stopped laughing, “our relationship is
He was currently on one of the couches in front of the fireplace, one of the few spots that wasn’t too crowded but wasn’t occupied by a bunch of overly horny teenagers. He was on the couch between Ron and Harry, surrounded by the rest of the fifth year Gryffindor boys, the Weasley twins, and a few Hufflepuff girls. He tried to ignore what felt like electricity on his right arm, the side Harry was on.
“I meant alone.” He said, staring into Draco’s eyes. Draco quickly looked away, not liking the feeling in his stomach. “I want to apologize.”
was really happening, Draco had pulled away, and Harry was now taking his frustration out. Harry had kissed Draco
“Really?” He was shocked. “But- but you hate Divination so much? They are really similar, I cannot see how you can love one but despise the other.”
He flung himself out of bed and scurried across the room, as Harry’s bed was on the opposite side of his. His heart felt a sting every time Harry yelled. The other boys in the room had started to wake up, still disoriented and confused as to what was happening. Soon Ron was on his feet and peering over Draco’s shoulder as he reached Harry’s bed.
They climbed in the carriage with the Hufflepuff prefects, Granger making polite conversation with them while Draco stared off in the distance. He fixated on the carriage in front of them, containing Potter and one of the Weasleys.
“So, you are alright, then? After everything?” Normally, Draco would think that someone who asked a question like that would be prying, sticking their nose into his personal life, but he felt Hermione’s genuine tone. His chest felt warm, as it was nice to have someone care about him.
That had to have been it. Potter must’ve talked to her before dinner, convincing her to never speak to him again. Or maybe she realized it of her own accord, that she didn’t want to associate with such a-
. I want you so badly that it drives me absolutely fucking insane. And now that I finally have you I am
“I’m sorry, that was harsh, but it’s true. I’m sorry that I ran away from you, I shouldn’t have. I know you wanted to apologize to me, and I knew that you wanted to before Harry ever spoke to you. But I, something inside of me didn’t really want to accept it. I needed some time to clear my head.”
“I have heard you say it yourself! Just because you had a spot last year does not mean you get to keep it.”
“I would not dislike him so much if he did not make it a point to sneer at me every chance he gets. What is his problem with me, anyway?”
But then he followed her eyes and she was watching Weasley. His brief happiness immediately came crashing down. She caught his glance and gave him an over-eager smile and two thumbs up. He smiled back, but it didn’t reach his eyes. It never did. Not in five years.

You could cut the tension in the air with a knife. It was like their heart to heart in the dorm had completely gone out the window. The three boys avoided eye contact, pretending to be interested in their waffles or a peculiar spot on the wall.
He was alone in the room when he closed his eyes, but he opened them abruptly when something had moved. Had he heard the door slam shut? Draco sat upright in his bed, still fully clothed. The motion caused his open book to fall off his chest and onto the floor. It was dark outside and the rest of the boys were asleep in their beads, meaning that Draco had really closed his eyes for a few hours. He cast a quick tempus charm and saw that it was half-past two in the morning.
“Sorry,” Draco had to catch his breath when Harry looked back up at him. He would never get tired of looking into his eyes.
“Just give him some time, Draco,” she whispered. “He just needs a minute or two to get comfortable.”
He heard Granger screaming from the stands, as well as the applause from a few others. His teammates flew to him, congratulating him. His body filled with pride, a Malfoy smirk creeping onto his face.
“Those people that you trust are the same ones that have made me the way I am, the same ones that have now replaced me.” His words were bitter and laced with venom.
But first, Draco was just going to close his eyes as he lay in his bed, just for a brief moment. His eyes had grown heavy from reading. Harry wasn’t due to come back from his lesson for another hour, Draco could spare a minute or two to relax.
Draco had learned about Sirius, through Hermione. He had overheard bits and pieces of their conversations, about how Harry was writing to him, and one day he approached Hermione because he felt that he deserved to know why his friend was writing to a mass murderer.
“Please,” she begged, even tugging on the sleeve of his robe. “Just come for an hour. I won’t be drinking, and you can stick to my side all night, I promise I won’t abandon you.”
Quidditch team?” He laughed again, trying to ignore the growing pit in his stomach. “Last time I checked Angelina Johnson was the captain, you are just the seeker who steps to the side and watches for 90% of the game.”
“Yeah, uh, Hermione kinda made me. I lost her though, I don’t know where she has gone off to.” He was glad he had found Neville, and from the looks of it, it seemed like he was staying sober, so at least he could
Potter banged his arm on the side of his head, causing him to jump out of his trance as the lockers ricocheted against his back. “You know exactly what I am talking about!”
it define you. There are ties stronger than family ones, but you don’t necessarily need to spill blood in order to form them. The friendships you make and the ones who love you no matter what are the real ties. Blood may be thicker than water, sure, but love is thicker than blood.”
“I just can’t do it,” he admitted in a defeated sigh as he collapsed into a chair. He ran a hand through his hair, taking another deep breath. He could hardly come to terms with this by himself, how was he going to have a conversation without breaking down like the absolute mess that he was? How was it that four months ago, he had no emotions at all, and suddenly he was experiencing almost every single one at once?
The portrait door slammed shut behind him. He stormed immediately to his room, thankful to find it empty. Without even taking his shoes off, he threw himself onto his bed, drawing the curtains shut and casting a silencing charm around himself.
He lifted his head, pushing the anguish in his chest into a deep, dark closet somewhere inside of it. He would deal with it later. Along with, everything else. Eventually.
“I will leave you a bottle of dreamless sleep on your nightstand, if you feel that you should need it,” she said, grabbing the box and standing up.
Harry sat up straight, causing Draco to let go but still keeping an arm around his shoulders. He shook his head. “No, I want people to talk about it. People refuse to even say his name, and, it’s like he never even existed. He was our classmate, and now he’s
He was not expecting Harry to move into his embrace, choosing to curl up against his side instead of the couch.
“No,” Harry said. He was no longer yelling at him, but he was still up in his face, his voice stern.
Everything went by so fast, and before he knew it, Draco was standing in the Great Hall, in front of the entire school, in the middle of the sorting ceremony.
“You said you also loved your broomstick?” He poked his head up and nodded. “Why haven’t you ever tried out for quidditch?”
“Death Eaters. I know, you do not have to be afraid to say the word. I know what they were.” He leaned back, running his hand through his hair, laughing. “Oh, do not look so scared, Granger. I was disowned by my family the second they found out about me being in Gryffindor. I have not spoken to them, nor seen them, in five years.”
The other boys came into the dormitory, breaking his train of thought. He suddenly felt uneasy, as their usual boisterous voices immediately turned to soft whispers. He turned his head to glare at them, and they all quickly turned their heads away.
“That does not change the fact that you said it! What, were you ashamed of me? Did you not want Saint Potter to know that you were befriending the Quidditch-stealing enemy, huh? Did you not want the castle to know you were befriending a Malfoy? A blood-traitor? A pathetic excuse for a-”
As he walked onto the pitch, his heart was pounding in his ears. His palms were so sweaty that he could hardly hold onto his broomstick. He didn’t know how he was going to be able to fly it.
“It’s actually a muggle phrase, you know,” he said as if everyone knew the truth. He sounded like Hermione. “People use it wrong all the time. It actually refers to how bloodshed on the battlefield creates stronger ties than your family ties.” He paused, letting the words sink in.
“Expelliarmus!” His wand flew out of his hand, once again. This time it soared over to Ginny, who caught it midair.
of the Potter bloodline? He invented Skele-Gro and Pepperup Potion? He basically founded medicinal potions!”
She wiped her mouth with her napkin, nodding. “Yeah, actually. We’ve gotten to know each other quite well over the past week.”
He continued to glare at them, locking eyes with Potter when he turned back around. His eyes pierced into his, making him feel uneasy in the stomach. Scoffing, he dramatically whipped his bed curtains shut. He cast a silencing charm on his bed, so even if they continued talking about them, he wouldn’t have to hear it.
There was a reason he didn’t have friends for the past four years. He was afraid to let anyone in. He knew that if he did, it would leave him weak and vulnerable, and they would leave him the same way his parents did.
It seemed that Snape was just constantly disappointed with every word that left Draco’s mouth today. “You know I only still keep in touch with them to protect you.”
“Has anything like this ever happened to you before?” He shook his head. He had been nervous, or scared, before, but not to the point where he lost control. “Have you been more stressed, recently?’
Harry didn’t say anything in response. Normally, Draco would push on, but he felt like he was walking on eggshells around Harry. Draco had expected Harry to blow up at him the second that Draco came down the stairs, but he didn’t, and Draco was going to try to hold onto this gentleness for as long as he could.
“I had long hair when I was a kid!” He defended. “My father made me cut it all off before Hogwarts, saying that I would look more
He didn’t know why he had done a lot of things, lately. He didn’t know why he had blown up at the first-year who called Granger a mudblood. He didn’t know why he was so concerned with Potter’s bruises and scars. He didn’t know why he helped Granger, why he asked her for help, or why he was beginning to open up to her. He didn’t know why she continued to associate with him, but he didn’t mind. Maybe having a friend would be a nice change.
Draco liked being invisible. He didn’t care what others thought about him, but he just preferred if they didn’t think of him at all.
“He seemed fine when he got off the train,” she remarked. “I’ll have to ask him at dinner.” Draco nodded and tried to not pay attention to Potter, but he couldn’t help it. Potter seemed to calm down as he began talking to another student in the carriage. Everything clicked when Draco realized he was talking to Lovegood, and he had probably just seen the thestrals for the first time. Draco had never seen them himself, though they’re mentioned briefly in
” The door to the Gryffindor common room swung open, and one by one, they entered the common room. The first years
Harry bit back a small smile. “I guess when you put it that way,” he said, but his smile fell. “Snape told me that you were able to do it. He said if you could do it, then it would be easy for me.”
Draco pulled back sooner than he would have liked, his heart beating so fast that he could hear it in his ears. He was almost afraid to open his eyes, but he did, to see Harry gazing intently back at him, his eyes dark, his lips still slightly parted and his cheeks flushed.
She had instantly flung herself at him, wrapping her arms tightly around him. “Oh, Draco, I’m so glad you’re okay. I’m so,
Draco hadn’t necessarily gone overboard, but it was enough for him to let down his guard. He wasn’t jumping away and revolting at every touch of human skin, he didn’t feel claustrophobic in the crowd anymore, and his signature scowl had been replaced on his face by a slight smirk.
And he could’ve sworn that the seventh year Ravenclaw boy had been looking at Draco the same way that Draco had been looking at him.
Hermione led them right to him, taking a seat next to Harry, leaving him to sit across from them, next to Weasley.
Well, he wasn’t going to be a keeper. He would rather die than sit in the same spot all game. He didn’t really want to be a beater, but he didn’t really want to be a chaser, either. At least with being a chaser, he would be able to score some points.
Draco used to eat lunch alone, but he now ate with Hermione. Potter and Weasley had a different lunch time than the two of them, as they were in Divination and then ate while Draco and Hermione had lunch then Arithmancy.  Draco quite liked this, as he didn’t want to be fourth-wheeling the ever so perfect golden trio.
“Do you know how advanced Occlumency is? Do you know how few wizards are able to master it? The fact that you’ve made it through three lessons without collapsing is astonishing,” Draco assured him. “Plus, it’ll take you a while to do it in your dreams. You’re bloody unconscious, for Merlin’s sake.”
Something did dawn on him, though. “Wait,” he yelled, trying to find the right words. “The two of you were ganging up on me because you could see the cards that I had!”
“You read all of this in one summer?” He was amazed. He had read five books, at most, over the summer, and he was the one who was locked up in a castle.
Draco spent the remainder of the train ride telling him all about the wizarding world and Hogwarts. From quidditch to classes to Aurors and Ministers, he explained it all. The silent wall that surrounded the boy had begun to fall and was replaced with a bond between the two boys. A bond of friendship.
“Oh, well I thought if we turn the heat up twice as hot then we could cut the time in half and leave class early.”
The boy near the front of the group shyly raised his hand, and Draco bent over so he has face to face with him. “Now tell me why you thought it was okay to say that word, and why you thought it was okay to say about another person?”
Draco yanked the curtains aside. Harry was thrashing his head side to side, covered in sweat, the blankets pooled at his feet. Draco placed one hand on each of Harry’s shoulders and started to gently shake him.
A small smile crept onto Draco’s face. The fact that she was obviously stressed that she was so late and the multitude of arithmancy books she had brought clearly showed that she really wanted to help him.
His sneer fell as he realized Harry had a point. After a brief demonstration, he broke them off into pairs, Draco with Ginny. “I want you to practice with your partner to your comfort level. The point of this exercise is to get the wand movement and incantation as engraved into your mind as possible, so repetition is key.”
His eyes found his way across the room, locking onto the seventh year Ravenclaw boy whom he had danced with earlier. “Preferably with a penis.”
He didn’t look behind him to see if she noticed his abrupt departure. He didn’t open his ears to listen to any more remarks from Potter or Weasley. He didn’t want to know.
true!” He stuttered as he shouted, pressing him further against the wall. Draco’s breathing hitched when Potter’s body was pressed up against his, a knot forming in his chest when they collided. He was so close that he could feel his heavy breaths, his heart pounding against his own. It took everything in him to not let his composure fall.
Looking down at Harry, he felt a pang in his chest. Here Harry was, with a dark wizard literally manipulating his mind and ashamed that he was unable to defend himself against it. The pain that Harry was probably in, the pain that Harry had felt as a child thrown into a war was
Were people actually going to see him as something more than the disappointment who wallows through the halls? Were people going to actually see him as a Malfoy, as a man of respect, of a man to be admired and praised and feared?
“Are you kidding me?” He interrupted her. “Do you understand the magnitude of what’s going on? People are beginning to disappear. If Voldemort is really back, and I believe he is, that means there’s a war coming. And do you know what happens in a war?
But the practice was over before he knew it, and they were all crammed in the locker room, everyone joking and pushing each other around. Well, everyone except Draco, of course. He kept to himself in the corner, taking the care to neatly fold his practice robes before he put them in his bag.
“Oh, you should play your Jack now, right?” Draco said as he watched over Harry’s shoulder, his chin just barely an inch from Harry’s neck.
Harry had opened his eyes and was staring at Draco’s face. His eyes looked different without his glasses. Draco felt that the glasses hid them away from the world, that they were so much brighter than he had thought. So much greener than he had though. Green had always been his favorite color.
The houses flashed past the windows, the countryside soon coming into view. Draco couldn't help but let a grin spread across his face. Honestly, it was a relief to be on his own. Outside the walls of The Manor. Without his father breathing down his neck every two seconds, watching his every move, he could finally be himself.
“So, back to last names, huh?” He frowned as he stared at his empty cup, sighing when Ron filled it back up. He wasn’t so sure that he wanted to keep playing, let alone keep drinking.
Hey guys! Sorry this is a tad late, I was out of town over the weekend and AO3 was giving me some issues yesterday. I hope this makes up for it! There will still be a regular update on Thursday :)
It was like this every year. Every year he’d seem so disappointed to go home, and whenever he returned, he was covered in cuts and bruises, and his eyes shone a little less. Draco didn’t know why he cared so much, he despised Harry Potter. But for whatever reason, Draco felt sorry for him, and even a little hurt whenever he saw the bruises.
Malfoy smirked as he moved through the common room. Yes, people were talking about him, but for once, it wasn’t negative. The praise. The admiration. He
Except Draco couldn’t really argue. Potter was an amazing seeker, and with Draco out of practice, Potter was definitely the better of the two.
Sure, he disliked the word. He used to always be the one to use it, but once he was disowned by his family, he realized that pureblood ideology was just a load of shit. In fact, procreating with muggles would raise the wizarding population, so why was it so frowned upon? Magic was something to be celebrated, to be proud of, not something to be kept behind closed doors.
Draco politely clapped through the sorting ceremony, listening to bits and pieces of the conversations around him. The Weasley twins were planning some massive prank against the Slytherins, a few second years were complaining about not being able to eat yet, and Potter, Granger, and Weasley were talking about a woman named Umbridge, who he presumed to be the new professor sitting at the staff table.
Draco, however, would skip breakfast and instead head to the library. He liked to get in a bit of light reading before class to warm up his mind before the day really began. Today he happened to be reading a muggle book, something he had never done before, but Hermione had recommended it. It was called
“You- you do know he has detention, right? With Professor Umbridge? He won’t be there, not for the next two weeks.”
“I never said you didn’t!” She said, raising her hands defensively as Pince shushed them again. “I’m just saying that he has a soft spot for you.”
Harry sighed. “Here,” he softened his voice as he moved behind Draco. “First of all, you need to relax your shoulders.”
“I have been meaning to talk to him, anyway.” It was a lie and not a lie at the same time. He didn’t
Harry groaned and threw his hands up in the air. “Goddammit, Malfoy! Thanks for giving away my hand!” He played an eight, so obviously Draco was wrong.
drunk-” Ron said as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a flask, pointing it at Draco. “Why, d’ya want some?”
what he wanted, for everyone to see him hanging around with Harry Potter. The boy was famous, powerful. Everyone knew his name, and if Draco spent all his time side by side with him, soon everyone would know the name Draco Malfoy just as well.
“I said just drop it!” He realized he had raised his voice and the entire class was staring at him. The dropping feeling in his stomach from last night had returned. The voices started back up again, and they knew they were all murmuring about him again. This was worse than before, as it wasn’t just Gryffindors. No, this was the class they shared with Slytherin, so now the story of last night’s outburst was spreading through the houses and around the castle. As if the Slytherins didn’t already think he was a blood traitor.
He didn’t know why it upset him, it just did. “Well, I am sorry. And I am sorry for bullying you. It was a dick move on my part, I was a righteous little brat.”
Draco's father cleared his throat and gave a cold, sickly smile. “Of course, my boy. First year at Hogwarts?” Potter simply nodded his head in response, wide-eyed. “The same is true for our boy, Draco. I’m sure the two of you will just be the best of friends.” Potter’s eyes met Draco’s, and he instantly remembered him from the shop as well, though Draco didn’t think he enjoyed their meeting.
He paused, refusing to look at Draco. He knew he hit it spot on. “I mean, it’s just that you were so
He found that if he sat in the dorm for too long, Potter and Weasley would send him dirty looks. He instead would spend his time in Snape’s office when he could, or would otherwise hide in the Room of Requirement. Hermione would never dare to go down to the dungeons, and to his knowledge, he was the only student in the school who had known about the hidden room.
He shifted on the bench. “I talked to uh, Harry last night,” it was still weird to say his name, and judging by the way he looked at him, it was weird for Harry to hear Draco say his name. “But I really do not want to be tied to the Malfoy name anymore, and I think calling people by their last name is a bit pretentious, so, um, if it is okay with you I would like to be on a first name basis.”
proud.” His mother’s comment warmed his heart, as he had been nervous about this moment for the past year.
She blew her whistle, and everyone swarmed to find their positions. Draco, along with everyone else wearing a red shirt, flew over to one set of goalposts. Looking back, he saw the keepers in green at the other. The beaters were in blue in the middle of the field. There was no one wearing yellow.
Everyone froze, including the upperclassmen. Most people had never even heard him speak before, let alone raise his voice.
He decided it was probably best to keep it on him at all times, in case there was an emergency. But what counted as an emergency? He had only ever had something like this happened to him just this one time, but he was pretty sure that losing consciousness counted as an emergency. But how would he know if he was going to pass out? How did he know if he was having a panic attack or just general anxiety? Pomfrey had explained it to him, but he didn’t quite fully understand it. What if this was just something his brain was making up, and he was faking it and being a big drama queen over nothing?
He would usually spend extra time in the shower so that he had some time to be alone and relax under the running water. He let his mind water as he stood there, letting the water just simply fall over him, not caring that his hair was in his eyes. Draco also liked spending the extra time because it usually meant he was one of the last ones in the locker room. He was able to change and take care of his hair without feeling like there were a million eyes watching him every second.
Draco placed a soft kiss on Harry’s lips, much like the first one. He pulled away so that their foreheads were no longer touching. Draco trailed one hand from behind Harry’s head until it rested beneath his chin. “Listen to me. I was such a fucking idiot before, I think I absorbed some of your savior complex and thought that I could protect you by running away, but I’ve realized that is the most bloody ridiculous idea I’ve ever come up with.”
“Are you serious right now?” Draco pushed it away from him. “We have a Herbology test first thing in the morning! What would Hermione say?”
“I’m not kidding, though. You both had similar upbringings, then were the first in your families to not be sorted into Slytherin, and ended up in
He had spent the majority of his first year hiding in the library. He had no one to talk to, no one to turn to. After being shunned from his family and the entirety of the Slytherin house, he grew cold and sinister. Potter had tried to talk to him, and every time he had done so, Draco just snapped in return. He had been part of why he ended up where he did, and Draco refuses to believe that might not be true.
He looked around. It was still the middle of the night, and he was the only one in the room. He sat up, carefully, as to not agitate anything that he had injured. But as he sat up, he found that he was able to do so with ease, and nothing was giving him pain. His head didn't even hurt. Why was he here?
“I do not care!” He shouted, standing back up. “That kind of thinking is severely outdated, to begin with, and that word is very disrespectful, and quite frankly, very racist. If I hear you, or anyone else for that matter, ever use that word again, especially while talking about another student, you will receive a detention, and it will not be a pretty one. Is that understood?”
Draco bit the inside of his cheek as a billion thoughts raced through his head all at once. Why were they being so supportive? They were making it into a bigger deal than it needed to be, really. Was one of
Draco put down his quill and smirked. “I mean, sort of. We mostly just work together for school, but she is nice to be around too.”
His nerves were suddenly pushed to the back of his mind. He immediately grabbed the quaffle and sped off to the goalposts. He adrenaline pumped through his veins, the wind rushed through his hair, and the excitement spread throughout his body.
She gently stroked his hair. “I think you ought to get some sleep, it’s still the middle of the night. There are many ways to approach it, and not everything works the same for everyone. We can discuss it in the morning, but I think that your brain could use a little bit of rest.”
“Fantastic. And welcome to Gryffindor house, by the way, I hope you have a splendid evening.” And with that he stormed off to his room, leaving a dead silent common room behind him.
want to end up like that. He was perfectly content with sitting back and watching the world happen around him. He tried to pick up the rules of the game, but every time he thought he understood, something would happen that would ruin all understanding that he had.
“It is very long,” he noted. “If I recall correctly, Snape said twelve inches. This has got to be, what, eighteen inches?”
The three of them were silent, and Draco went back to pushing his food around his plate, afraid that he had overshared.
Granger rushed up to him. “Oh, Draco, I’m sure your nose is broken!” She cried, touching his nose, causing him to wince. “Here, let me walk you to the hospital wing.”
“This was really, really helpful, actually. I am really glad I asked you for help. Thank you so much.”
“No, mate, there’s nothing wrong with that,” he said as he finally took control over himself. “No, Draco, I’m sorry I laughed like that. None of us here really give a shit about stuff like that.”
Draco was dreading his next reaction with him. Their encounter was completely out of character for Draco, but that wasn’t it. It was the first time that he had ever attempted to be
of all of this stupid fighting. And for what? I’m sick of it. I’ve spent my time hating you, and you’ve spent your time hating me, and I think we’ve both had enough of it.”
yesterday, it only seems fair that you return the favor.” He crossed his arms over his chest and glared at him.
Draco just shook his head and chuckled. He didn’t find the particular situation very humorous, but it was funny, almost in a maniacal way. “You’re ridiculous. I am not scared of you, I am scared of,
after what I did. I should have never thought it would be a good idea to just turn cold and leave you alone in all of this, I’m so sorry. I don’t want to ever leave you, but if you want nothing to do with me, I would understand.”
Potter moved across the room as if he were flying instead of walking. His long legs floated his body quickly towards him, until he grabbed him by the collar and shoved him against the wall. He put his face in Draco’s, their eyes staring into each other. His were wide with rage, his nose sneered, his mouth breathing heavily. Draco felt his stomach drop as he stared into Potter’s wild eyes.
The line moved quicker than he had hoped. He hoped to stand in this line for hours, and somehow miss his chance at trying out. But soon he was at the front of the line, quill in hand, Angelina glaring at him.
The party had died down, the other houses slowly retreating to their respectable common rooms as the Gryffindors made their way into their dormitories. All the people playing cards had left, and although there were still a few people milling around the common room with faint music still playing in the background, Harry and Draco were the only ones left in front of the fireplace.
Draco didn’t know why he liked being in Harry’s presence so much, why he craved it so desperately. A month ago, the two of them could hardly be in the same room as each other. A month ago, he hated Harry Potter with all of his guts. But here they were, talking about friendships and those who loved you no matter what. Why the hell had everything changed so fast?
“Harry, wake up. It’s just a dream, Harry,” he repeated over and over again, in a low voice. He wanted to jolt him awake, to get him out of whatever horror he was currently stuck in. He wanted nothing more to get the pained expression off his face, but he knew that startling him was not a good idea.
mean what I said in the shop. I was just, off that day. After traveling all the way to London, avoiding being spotted by muggles all day. It was just tiring, you know?”
He squinted at Draco, as if he were trying to see through some sort of veil of lies around him. Eventually, he just shrugged. “Seems fair to me,” and shoved a spoonful of food in his mouth.
He gently moved his hand up and down Harry’s upper arm in a soothing motion. “Do you want to talk about it?” Draco mumbled into his hair.
“Yeah, and now I am looked down upon by everyone who values the Malfoys. I am still technically the heir, you know, but I doubt I will be able to find anyone who would be willing to continue the Malfoy bloodline with
What do you guys think of the length of this chapter? I’ve been aiming for longer chapters lately, but this one is almost twice as long as my usual ones. I didn’t want to split it into two, but at the same time I’m not sure if it was too long. Is it okay? Should I go a little shorter, or even longer? Please let me know!
to go by the board, you say we should go by the board! I can’t win.” He huffed and slumped back in his chair.
Draco realized that this was the first time that he was sitting with the two of them, and they both seemed very uncomfortable.
Right. The infamous Gryffindor Halloween party, where the fifth, sixth, and seventh years (with the occasional fourth year or two sneaking in) would stay up all night, blasting music, getting themselves embarrassingly drunk whilst all the prefects and professors turned a blind eye.
They had finally pulled away, gasping for air. Draco’s hands were wrapped around Harry’s head, holding his forehead in place against his own, and Harry’s hands were doing the same. Draco opened his eyes to see Harry opening his, and the two of them sat there like this, staring into each other while breathing the same air until Harry broke the silence.
he felt when he woke up next to Harry, a happiness that he didn’t ever think he had felt before. This time around it was almost painful.
His gaze fell as he stared at his feet, mumbling something under his breath, but something Draco assumed to be along the lines of “I want it to be.”
Yay, finally an update on an actual Sunday! Well, it’s almost 2 AM here, so I guess it’s technically Monday, but I’m getting better, I promise!
Draco thought that he would pick up the rules as he went along, but he couldn’t wrap his head around them. He wasn’t the only one, as there were several people who were
He smiled at Draco before he left to help another pair, and that smile got him through the rest of the lesson.
Draco ignored him as he walked over to the couch sitting next to Harry. He sat in silence for a moment, letting Harry adjust to having someone next to him.
He was sure Snape lined up his assignments on purpose just to torture his students, but why couldn’t the rest of them just give them a
“It is two in the morning. I did not think anyone else was awake.” He stated, trying very hard not to stumble over his words.
Draco didn’t say anything as he scooted closer to Harry, their thighs touching. When Harry didn’t flinch or move away, Draco draped an arm around Harry’s shoulders, who immediately curled into Draco’s side, Harry burying his face into Draco’s neck.
Harry must have said something to her once he stormed out of the door. She was Harry’s friend too, and Draco didn’t want to lose her, and he didn’t want her to have to pick a side. She didn’t deserve to get dragged into his mess, everything was Draco’s fault. But he was sure that Harry had spoken to her because she would not stop staring at Draco intently as they ate breakfast the next morning.
Thanks so much to everyone who has read this story! I appreciate all of your feedback so much, and I welcome even more! I hope you all have a fabulous weekend :)
“Okay, so Draught of Peace, should be simple enough,” she said. Draco merely rolled his eyes. They began their potion, working in near silence, Draco grateful for this. While she was very smart, Granger was also quite bossy, even when she wasn’t right. It was very annoying.
“You didn’t let me explain myself! Every time I tried to approach you, you ran away with a tail between your legs! You can’t just retreat into some shell and distance yourself from everyone every time you encounter a slight inconvenience, Draco!”
“Malfoy,” he heard a hiss and whipped his head around. Granger, of course. “Where were you? All the prefects were supposed to be in the compartment-”
He didn’t feel safe. He felt safe hiding in the dark corners of the library and the room of requirement. Not here in the common room, where people had started to come out of their rooms to see what all of the yelling was about.
speaking with him now?” He seemed revolted, his emerald eyes nearly bursting out of his head in disgust, and Draco couldn’t help but scoff.
“I know, I know.” Draco cut her off. “I must have had something horrible before getting on the train, I spent the whole ride in the lavatory. I am feeling better now, though. Perhaps it was just motion sickness.”
“I do not know what you are talking about.” He said without looking her in the eyes, opening one of the books she had just closed.
Draco sighed. He knew he couldn’t speak with his godfather for more than five minutes without one of them spouting insults at the other, which is why they usually sat in silence. “I should get going to dinner.”
gay? No, he shook that thought out of his mind very quickly. “Well, you guys are kinda making it into one.”
Draco didn’t know how to respond. He shrugged. “Fine. Just pretend I was not nice to you. Problem solved?”
“Only because if we didn’t, you’d go lock yourself in the library for the rest of the term thinking we all hated you.” He said, slurring his words ever so slightly. Great, he was still a little drunk, too. Harry had a point, but Draco wasn’t going to admit it. “Merlin, Draco, we’re your
He opened his mouth to ask Granger about it, but she was already saying goodnight and went up the stairs to her dormitory.
He found himself pacing back and forth on the seventh floor, where despite not being too crowded, the whispers were still following him. Suddenly, a door appeared to his right, and he decided it was in his best interest to duck into this mysterious room before anyone else did.
Draco had never been in a crowd like this before. There was someone pushed up against him on all sides. How were there even this many Gryffindor students, let alone upperclassmen? Soon he realized that it wasn’t just the Gryffindors that were in the common room, but there were Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, and even a few Slytherins.
Draco continued. "Besides, I think without you around, one day I’ll have a panic attack and believe I am going to die so hard that I actually die. I need you.”
Harry and Draco made their way through the aisle, finally settling on one of the last empty compartments. Draco waved goodbye to his parents as the train started moving, going faster and faster, leaving King's Cross far behind them.
Draco groaned and put his head in his hands. Dear God, Harry Potter was going to be the death of him, in every single way possible.
“Draco, it’s Halloween. You’re not locking yourself in the library redoing work you finished on Tuesday because you don’t want to socialize.”
Harry glanced up to give her a small smile, secretly thanking her, and it made Draco angry. Harry hadn’t even acknowledged his presence this entire time. But isn’t that what he wanted?
Draco didn’t think she had done it on purpose. One minute he was standing right next to her, and the next she was gone. It wasn’t her fault, she probably turned around to say hi to someone while some else had slipped in between them, separating them and pushing them into opposite directions of the crowd.
And she was right, he had already rewritten everything on Tuesday. But after taking one glance at his Transfiguration essay, he knew that he had to do it again. He was sure that he would get by just fine on his Potions essay without rewriting it one more time, but he was in a mood where he
He should say something. Anything. But before he could string any words together, Harry had placed his hands on both sides of Draco’s face, pulling him down to continue where they had left off, Draco meeting him halfway.
“So,” Ron said, not bothering to fully chew his sausages as he spoke. “I think Harry has a lot to tell us about, don’t you, mate?”
Harry didn’t lift his head as he stabbed at his food with his fork. “No, I don’t. Not really.” He said.
She huffed as if she had been told this a million times before. “Divination is just arbitrary guesses and made-up tales. Arithmancy takes a
I know you scored higher than me on our exam last term. But this is just everything that I had read over the summer-”
He didn’t know why Harry was doing this. Draco had gone off on him in Hog’s Head, sure, but Draco still had so much to apologize for on his end and he didn’t know where it was all coming from. Maybe it was because they had spent all night together, or that he was drunk and rambling and just not thinking about what he was saying.
“And you wonder why Snape dislikes you Gryffindors so much.” He handed her back the parchment. “You need to cut it down, it should be fourteen inches
“I’m sorry that I hated you, but you have to look at it from my perspective. I don’t really know how much you know about this, but I live with Muggles. I was raised without any knowledge of magic until I was eleven years old, and you were my first wizarding friend and all of a sudden you turned around and shit on it. That, and you bullied me. I know you stopped after first year, and I should have let go when you did, but I didn’t. I was stubborn, arrogant, and selfish. And I am
“What?” Draco pulled his head back, placing his fingers under Harry’s jaw, tilting it upwards. “Harry, look at me. You have
She gave him a quizzical look, then scoffed. “Oh, alright then,” and the two of them headed to the prefect’s carriage in silence. Draco didn’t mind Granger, she was always friendly enough towards him, even after she thought he was the one who sent the basilisk out to kill the muggle-born students their second year. He also had some respect for her, she was the only one who could keep up with him in school.
“He- he’s just been on edge since we’ve gotten back. It kinda does seem like everyone is against him, since no one believes him.”
He felt like his head was going to explode. He was noticing every little thing around him. The fire was too hot, too bright. Hermione’s voice was too loud. His hands were shaking, sweating, his heart pounding too fast. Everything was too much.
The five boys stood there in awkward silence, Draco and Ron standing next to Harry’s bed, the others still in their own, rubbing their eyes, trying to go back to sleep.
He blinked in shock, putting his fingers up to his nose, and felt nauseous when he pulled them away to see them covered in blood.
It wasn’t as bad as he thought. He didn’t gag or spit it out. He felt the warmth in his throat, the magic of the firewhiskey spreading through him.
“No,” she cut him off, and he felt the anguish seeping back in. She sat down in the armchair across from him. “I want to apologize.”
He couldn’t help but notice how close they were. His heart was pounding, and he was sure that Potter could feel it. He could definitely feel how warm his torso was, how he was breathing down his neck, one arm pinned on the locker beside his head. His lips were
to me last night, I expected you to just turn around and walk away, I was surprised when you actually talked to us. But then you sat there and
Draco chuckled. “First of all, I’m hurt. Second of all, I don’t know if I’d still be able to do it, it’s been a while since I’ve practiced. In order to master Occlumency you have to completely shut down your emotions and not bite back at
and he could clearly see that in the way his arms bulged out from his shirt that was just a little bit too tight.
“And remember to breathe,” he took a step away, Draco’s body screaming at the loss of contact, begging for Draco to reach out and touch him.
“Watch it Potter, your temper is getting out of control again.” It took every ounce of control for Draco to stay calm and not sink down to Harry’s level, as he knew that it would piss him off even more.
The redhead coughed as he shared a nervous glance with Potter. “Well, people have been noticing it. They’re starting to, you know,
“Ron, I think it’s time you ought to go to bed,” Hermione said gently, trying to get him off the couch and away from Draco. Ron argued with her, but eventually gave in, miraculously standing up.
“`Mhm, and you think about what looks good on me all the time, it seems?” Draco smirked. He could do this.
“It sounds like a textbook. It is not word for word from ours, but it sounds as if it might as well be. Yes, it is supposed to be highly factual, and everything you have is correct. But I can see you are an excellent writer, so show it off a little more.”
Draco had planned to wait up for Harry. He was going to catch him in the common room when he came back. Draco knew he would be exhausted, so even if Harry wasn’t up for conversation, Draco could at least support him from his lesson.
Draco rolled his eyes at his father’s comment. His mother simply rolled her eyes along with him, gave Draco a small smile, and clutched his hand.
only stirred it three times, but changing direction and stirring it five times after adding the moonstone reduces the potency of the moonstone. If you only stir it three times, as the instructions say, the potion will induce grogginess after the main effect wears off, as the moonstone is too strong. But you still have to add the full amount of moonstone, or else it will just simply not work. When you stir it like this, you effectively prevent that side effect from ever occurring while still ensuring the potion functions as normal.”
“Why? What’s the matter with you?” Potter nearly interrupted her, and Draco couldn’t help but roll his eyes. It was mostly for dramatic effect in case they looked over, so that they knew he was listening. But he didn’t want them to see how Potter’s comment actually panged his chest. Of course there had to be something
At least he was almost done. He had finished up his Herbology project earlier in the day and had spent the past several hours working on his Transfiguration essay (a whole 24 inches- Draco wanted to know who the
Before long, the other three were through the wall, his mother brushing his hair with her fingers one more time. “Oh, stop moving Draco. I do not want you to look anything but your best for the sorting ceremony.”
“What is your angle, Malfoy?” He whipped around. “Were you trying to fuck with me, or send a message or what? Why would you get so close with my best friend just to hurt her?”
“I think I’m going to sit out and jus’ watch on this one, actually,” Draco slurred when Ron had asked Draco if he wanted another cup. He didn’t like how he was beginning to lose control over the words that came out of his mouth, and he didn’t like the way his head was beginning to spin.
His shirt clung to him, sticking to the sweat that was beginning to drench his body. His hair was messier than normal, which said a lot, and his hands were gripping Draco’s biceps, his fingernails digging into his skin. His chest rose and fell, quickly at first, but gradually slowed as he came to, his grip loosening and his eyes darting around the room.
He stood up, cutting her off. He panted, barely being able to get the words out of his mouth. He felt weak, like he was going to collapse any second. “I cannot do this right now. I am sorry-”
I definitely enjoyed this chapter, and hopefully you will too. Yes, it's full of angst again, but hopefully it's all worth it in the end ;)
“Expelliarmus!” She shouted. She was quicker than him, stronger than him, and his wand flew ten feet away before he could even get the word out of his mouth.
“Then you show up this year and everything has changed. Suddenly you were everywhere, hanging out in the common room instead of the library, becoming friends with Hermione, and joining Quidditch. And I was
Harry was in the common room, alone, sitting on the couch next to the empty fireplace. He was curled up against the arm of the couch, his head buried in his arms. Draco thought he heard him crying, but Harry immediately tensed up and went silent. He had probably heard someone coming down the stairs and lifted his head ever so slightly to see who it was, enough to where Draco really couldn’t see his face.
stop staring. He knew it was wrong, he knew he should move, but he was frozen in terror and his brain wasn’t working.
He had woken up at five in the morning, unable to rest. His nerves for the tryouts were beyond compare, and he decided to try to ease them by flying laps around the pitch before anyone else awoke.
Harry took his hand, seeming almost afraid to do so. As he did, he could hear his parents muttering about them behind his back.
His first Christmas was especially hard. He turned to his books and found an escape. The more he threw himself into his schoolwork, the less he had to think about those around him. The only thing that mattered to Draco was himself and his grades. It paid off in the end, too. He had received the highest marks in his year. He nearly lost to Hermione Granger, but he scored one point higher on his potions final examination than her.
The second they stepped off the train, the silence was back. Draco, along with all other first years, were in a trance. He had heard many stories and seen many pictures of Hogwarts, but nothing prepared him for the enchanting castle looming over him, reflecting off the glass-like waters of the Black Lake as he glided towards his home for the next seven years.
“Oh, no,” Draco said. He had to get Potter’s trust, he had to make him like him. “They’re not all bad, just a few, you know? I didn’t
He used to think that feeling was just because of the mutual hatred that they shared, and that feeling of electricity was going to settle down once they did. But it never faded. It was still there, alive as ever, only intensifying.
Lips barely touching, they giggled into each other. Draco savored every second of it, even the awkwardness, because it made it feel so very
Draco didn’t know how he was going to do this. He couldn’t hurt Harry, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. But how was he supposed to pull himself away? Every time Draco looked at Harry, it was like time had stopped and nothing else mattered, nothing except Harry, and Draco would let himself get pulled into Harry’s gaze. How was he supposed to resist that? He was going to have to do it slowly, and it was going to hurt, but it was the only way. The only thing that he was afraid of was Hermione noticing. And of course, she did.
Percy Weasley, one of the Gryffindor prefects, came up behind Draco. “Malfoy, I think you need to calm-”
He didn’t realize how much he really loved flying. The way the wind rustled through and messed up his hair was exhilarating. The ground was a hundred feet below him, and the thought of plummeting promptly to his death made him feel oddly better. It pumped adrenaline into his veins and made him realize that some things were just too insignificant to be bothered with. He could leave all his troubles and worries on the ground, he could leave his problems in the castle, on the ground, and distance himself from them by being up in the air.
“That’s great to hear,” she said, then paused before  continuing, “Harry feels really bad about what happened.”
“Yeah, I would stop too if I were playing as poorly as you were,” Seamus had called out to him. When the hell did he start becoming friends with
“Thanks, Draco, for leading me into my first point.” He shot a sickly smile, and Draco kept his sneer plastered on his face. Could he be any more condescending? “First of all, I have literally used this against Voldemort himself a few months ago. But my point here is that you don’t need fancy, intricate spells to protect yourself. We all already have the skills to keep ourselves safe, we just have to learn how to use them the right way. It’s better to find one spell that you know that you can always turn to, that you can use without thinking, than to know twenty spells you haven’t yet mastered.”
But of course, Snape just had to torture him by partnering him with Granger, a smirk crawling onto his face when he read off the names.
He immediately recognized it as a calming draught, and gulped it down without complaining. He knew there was no use in fighting Pomfrey, no one ever got their way against her.
Draco placed his hand on top of hers, the contact of their skin grounding him into the library, into a place that was real. “Snape told me that he was teaching Harry Occlumency, and that I, er, had a
His heart sank. He really didn’t know why he did it, and he really didn’t want people to remember that he did it. He just stared at her directly in the eyes and shrugged, hoping she wouldn’t question it further.
you know? You can turn someone into a Newt or make someone fall in love or heal your wounds, the possibilities are just
The essay normally wouldn’t be so bad, but he rushed to finish his first draft before Quidditch practice at the end of last week, so he really had to scrap it and start all over. He had worked on it since then, but it still just wasn’t tight.
He had nowhere to go. He didn’t have class until later that afternoon. He couldn’t hide outside somewhere, it was too nice outside and everyone was there. There were always people in the common room. He couldn’t go to the Great Hall. Snape was teaching a class, so he couldn’t hide in his office. He needed
that this house has! As soon as the house got wind of your detention, it was like everyone knew they had the opportunity to finally show the world how better they are than you, not just at Quidditch, but in everything, quite frankly-”
He saw the bludger coming for him out of the corner of his eye, twisting his broomstick upside-down to dodge it. It missed the bristles of his broom by centimeters.
need to talk to him, he just wanted to make sure he was okay. Draco didn’t think he would be able to go back to sleep without knowing what had happened, without knowing that Harry had someone there to support him. But he
His chest hurt. He could feel his body starting to sway, his head beginning to swim. Hermione was saying something to him, but she sounded underwater and he couldn’t hear a single word that she was saying. Draco closed his eyes, not that it made a difference, and tried to concentrate on her voice, how she was being gentle with him. He focused on the touch of their hands.
“Oh, this is only the second time I’ve driven you to a panic attack. That’s totally normal and healthy, isn’t it?” Harry snapped. He had removed his arm from around Draco’s shoulder and started picking at his nails as he stared at his hands.
Harry’s lips were soft against his own. It was gentle and slow, and even though it only lasted a mere few seconds, Draco had felt that time had stopped.
wanted to be a seeker. He loved controlling the game, he wanted the thrill of chasing the snitch, the pressure for him to catch it, the roaring crowds admiring him when he won the game for his house. But he didn’t think that was really an option, as that position had already been filled.
He thought of their Defense Against the Dark Arts class, of how Potter had snapped at their Professor. It’s not like Draco didn’t agree with what he said to her, but he couldn’t help but cringe at his outburst. Potter, our savior, just
“You don’t have to apologize, my dear boy.” She smiled, reaching into the box and taking out a vial. “Here, I think you should drink this.”
Or was he wet? Maybe he was drowning. He heard voices, someone was yelling, he was sure of it, but he couldn’t make out what they were saying, like he was underwater.
He sneered and grabbed it out of his hand. They set up again, Harry standing with his arms crossed behind Draco, watching them. He wasn’t going to mess up this time, not with Harry watching him. No, he was determined to finally get it right.
“No, that’s not what I was saying! You just need to relax. Show me how you would hold your wand, as if you were about to cast the spell.”
Draco almost burst out laughing. It was the scrawny boy from the robe shop last week, the same one who was hanging around that big
been meaning to talk to him, about if he was feeling the same things Draco was starting to, but he didn’t think he was ready for that conversation quite yet. Maybe it was just a fluke. Maybe the butterflies and caught breaths would go away, and bringing it up would be a mistake. “Unless you really want to talk to him,” he added.
“Seriously, Potter? Do you even realize how many potioneers you have in your bloodline? And you can’t even manage to muster up a simple wit-sharpening potion.”
Maybe someone really did need him, after all, and the guilt that he felt was far worse than anything he had ever felt before.
IT HAPPENED IT HAPPENED WE'RE FINALLY THERE!! Hopefully it didn't take too long, did it? This work is already just about the same length as my longest completed work, whoops. I'm very proud of it though, I like the slow burn :)
don’t even read the instructions!” He protested. “Every time I try to go by the board, you sit here and go
He paused, taking a deep breath after working himself up. Draco wanted to say something in return, but every time he went to say something, the words would slip out of his mind.
you know? I get things the first time around. As I got older, I would always read potion texts for fun. They just- they can do
Potter raised his voice. “Do you not care what other people are saying? People are noticing that you’re spending more time with him than you are with us!”
“Oh, don’t be like that. You’ve come to see this in the past month or two, you just needed someone to
” Draco winced when Harry used his last name, feeling a sharp sting in his stomach. “You saw what happened to Hermione when you did this to her. And your relationship with her wasn’t even
He bumped into someone at the bottom of the stairs. “Oi, watch where you’re going!” He heard the voice call at him.
He felt Harry smile into the kiss, which drove Draco absolutely mad. Draco’s hands were everywhere he could manage, on Harry’s hips, around Harry’s neck, slipping beneath the hem of Harry’s t-shirt, roaming around his body with an insatiable thirst. Draco couldn’t believe that this was
“There, try it like that,” he said. Draco turned his head to look at Harry, who was staring into his eyes with a look that Draco couldn’t decipher, causing the knot in his stomach to erupt into butterflies.
right? If you had stuck around to eavesdrop a little longer, you would hear her say that’s how it started out. That she was surprised that it had gone any further, but that she was really happy about it! She
“I, uh, I was not ready yet,” he mumbled, retrieving his wand as she smirked. “Okay, again. Expellia-”
“Hi, uh, excuse me?” The three of them turned their heads at a small voice speaking behind them. "I'm so sorry, 'mam. I couldn't help but overhear your conversation, could you help me get onto platform nine and three-quarters?”
” Harry had loosened his grip just enough so that Draco no longer felt as if he was trapped, but still enough to keep him in place.
Harry laughed as he picked up his own cards. “Wow, you really got me there. How can I ever recover from such a harsh, original insult?”
The halls were loud. The common room was even louder. And for whatever reason, Draco thought Pince might have been kidnapped, because the library was the loudest. Everywhere he went, the whispers, the names, followed him. This was
He wasn’t exactly sure what he didn’t know, which just frustrated him. “Well, I was just really behind during class yesterday. I was able to catch up a bit and it made more sense today, but I just did not really grasp the main concepts in either class.”
“It’s not like the teachers care,” she said “and you don’t have to drink, you know that. Plenty of people don’t and just go to hang out with their friends. Does that really sound so bad?”
you.” He pulled his fist back as far as he could while still being pinned up against the wall, but Potter was pulled off of him by Weasley before he could get his hit in.
But it seemed as if the Universe wanted to keep them apart, as they never did get the chance to speak with each other that day. Draco had spent the past few days so meticulously avoiding being alone with Harry, but now when he needed it more than ever, he wasn’t able to.
it. He sat in the armchair by the fireplace, opening his book. He soaked it all in. The words circulating through the common room warmed his body more than the fire did.
They didn’t even speak at breakfast, since Hermione thought it would be best to go over plans for the next DA meeting. During lunch, Alicia had called an informal quidditch team meeting to go over what happened in practice that morning. And Harry had an Occlumency lesson with Snape after dinner, so Harry had rushed to eat as much as he could before it, not speaking to any of them.
He took a deep breath, rolling his shoulders back. He was tensing up without even realizing it, and he had to focus to change the way his fingers around his wand.
youngest seeker in a decade? Just because you got your spot first year does not mean you get to keep it.”
Two weeks had passed since their initial meeting in the Hog’s Head, and here they were, finally having their first, practical meeting. Everyone who had been at that meeting was sitting alongside him in the Room of Requirement. He was both relieved and worried that no one had dropped out. He didn’t know everyone there, so how was he supposed to know if he could trust his peers?
Harry looked up from his plate and stared him dead in the eyes, making something not sit right inside of him.
“Which I did.” Draco interrupted. “Which I then followed with one stir in each direction, canceling them out.” She still seemed furious and confused, so he continued. “The potion will still brew correctly either way, as I
I hope you all enjoy this chapter, I've had this scene stuck in my head since I first fully planned out this fic. It didn't come out the way I wanted at first, but I think I finally did it justice in the end!
“I am fine, thanks for asking,” he said, trying to break the silence and the tension, but the glare that he received from Hermione made him feel like that had been the wrong thing to say.
up. That would make Potter just loathe him. The previous night, he had simply told her to meet him in the library, yet he hadn’t specified where exactly to meet. He ended up reserving a private study room in the back of the library for them to study together. If they had sat together, in the middle of the library, he couldn’t imagine the stares and whispers they’d get. He thought back to how Potter had reacted when they were seen together in the Gryffindor common room. About how the whole school blew up in rumors following Draco’s outburst on the first-year student. If people saw them together, again, for the
He shook the thoughts out of his head. It was now twenty past the hour, and she had still not shown up. She
you’re finally here though,” Harry said, trying to ease the conversation off Ron, who gave him a thankful look. “Draco’s been asking about you
Draco turned off the shower, listening for anyone else. He couldn’t hear any showers running, and he couldn’t hear any voices or footsteps, either, so he had a good chance of being alone.
“Listen to me, you’re okay, alright?” The voice was soft, so much different than the angry one that was yelling at him before. The voice was calm and smooth, gentle like the rolling of soft waves across the sea. Draco felt a hand rest on his jawline, the fingers warm against his cold skin. “I need you to take a deep breath, okay? I’m going to count to ten while you take a deep breath, can you do that for me?”
Draco thought to himself. As he scanned the room, he realized that there was one empty bed and it was Harry's. As he pieced everything together in his still fuzzy, dreamlike state, Draco realized Harry must’ve had another nightmare. It made sense, he was probably exhausted from his Occlumency lesson that he had nothing left inside him to put up a fight in his sleep.
He felt his heart sink. He felt something he had never felt before, guilt, and he didn’t like it at all.“Oh, I- I did not really know she felt that way.”
“It is okay,” he said, smiling. “You did not know how I was going to react like that, and you wanted to talk about our friendship. I get that.”
“Draco, he really thinks that there’s nothing wrong with you being gay,” she reassured him. “I swear, we all do. It really doesn’t matter to us, and we will support you no matter what, okay? Besides, I’m glad you told us,” she smiled, “maybe now they’ll stop trying to get us together.”
Draco didn’t even realize that his eyes were closed. He opened his eyes, blinking away the tears that blurred his vision. “Um, I can see-” The only thing he can focus on is Harry’s face, right there in front of his, the green eyes piercing into his own. Harry’s lips are softly parted in a worrying expression. He thinks for a second that he could lean forward, and-
“Yeah, I am doing alright.” He was going to stop there, but he knew she would be restless without more information. “I had, um, a panic attack,” he lowered his voice. “I just, got so overwhelmed that, I, my body had a physical reaction, I guess. Pomfrey helped me with some ways to stop it, and gave me some calming draughts for emergencies. I will be meeting with her again later this week, but I think everything is going to be alright.”
Draco rolled his eyes. He had been partnered with Harry for potions, so naturally, he had taken over and done almost all of the work. He let Harry have some fun, as he made him dice all the ingredients for him. “I think you should get your glasses checked. The board says twenty-four.”
Ron patted him on the back, just a little too hard, causing him to wince. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”
Once she turned to talk to his father, Draco turned to Harry, sticking out his hand. “Look, I know you remember me from the robe shop. I was a brat, and I apologize for that. I hope we can make things right between us, sit with me on the train?”
His hands were cold and clammy, and he could barely hold onto his wand. But they managed to complete their potion, along with only five other pairs. Of course, they were awarded ten extra points for their exceptional alteration.
She gave a skeptical nod. “Okay, sure. Now I wasn’t exactly sure what you needed help on, so I prepared for everything.” He fought to suppress a chuckle. “Obviously not
Thanks so much for all of you who continue to support this story, it means so much to me! I'm glad you're enjoying it as much as I enjoy writing it! See you all next Sunday <3
“No!” He stood up. “You cannot tell me what to do! I will not listen to you! I do not belong in this house, I belong over there,” He pointed at the Slytherin table, “and I do not care what some stupid hat says! I am Draco Malfoy, I am a Slytherin, and I will never,
Harry thought this was hilarious, as he was doubled over with laughter. Draco was annoyed. Annoyed at how the two of them could be so irresponsible, annoyed at how Ron had called him
Harry sighed contently and moved so that he was sitting next to Draco, putting his arm around Draco’s shoulders as they sat there and stared at the opposite wall of lockers. Draco instinctively placed his head on Harry’s shoulder as his hand loosened its grip on his shirt.
other people close to him. And he was feeling that other people were comfortable with him being around, too.
He couldn’t focus on any of his classwork. Even though he felt like he learned everything one could about arithmancy in one night, he was still lost in class. He couldn’t properly transfigure his toad into a chair. Even Snape made a snide comment about how his potion was merely sub-par. He couldn’t focus on anything. His entire mind was occupied by his fears about the quidditch tryouts later that evening.
Harry’s face was so close to his. Harry was still curled into Draco’s side but had lifted his head away from Draco’s shoulder so that he could talk to him better. Draco still had one arm draped around Harry, the other with his hand resting on his jaw. He was so close, all he had to do was hold him a little tighter and lean in just the smallest bit to close the gap. All he had to do was get himself to do it. Why was he so scared? Harry had been an open book lately, he had given Draco every reason to believe that the feelings he held for Harry were mutual. Even Hermione had seen it. All this fighting and tension was a byproduct of Draco’s stubbornness, and they could move past that all if Draco could just bring himself to close the space between them.
At least he wasn’t with Finnigan. God, he’d rather jump off the Astronomy tower than have him burn his hair off.
You’re so oblivious sometimes. It’s hilarious,” he chuckled as he dealt out the cards. “That was also a joke, if you didn’t catch that one.”
Today was Friday, which meant he began the day with Double Potions followed by Care for Magical Creatures, then lunch.
beyond anything Snape had done, and he was scared for his next Defense Against the Dark Arts class. He didn’t want to go anywhere near that woman. And his classmates didn’t even
I’m so sorry this is so late! I was planning on making a double update this past weekend to make up for it, but I rewrote this chapter about three times instead because it just wasn’t turning out the way I wanted it to. It’s still kinda meh :/ so feedback is very very welcome!
Madam Pomfrey had stepped out from behind a door a box of potions tucked underneath her arm, rushing over to him. “Oh, take it easy my dear boy!”
Draco couldn’t remember what she had said, as he was already drifting off by the time she began to walk away.
He heard it first in his dream. He couldn't remember what he was dreaming about, but he knew that he was talking to someone when their words slowly morphed into incoherent moans and cries.
Harry shrugged. He moved so that he was laying down on the couch, his head in Draco’s lap. His hands found themselves playing with Harry’s hair, trying to smooth it out, but eventually giving up and just let himself run his fingers through his hair.
Draco made it to the station just in time to slip into the crowd of students making their way to the carriages.
had a problem dismissing his emotions. “You should go to Pomfrey, this isn’t normal. She could at least give you a bottle of-”
A round of applause ensued, and Professor McGonagall gave him a smile as she removed the hat from his head. He looked over to the Slytherin table, a scowl on almost every face. Blaise Zabini, whom he learned to play quidditch with, refused to look at him. Pansy Parkinson, whose mother had many dinner parties with his mother, was giving him a look that he was sure would kill him.
It hurt him to see Harry like this, and it hurt him, even more, to see him bottling it up, pushing him and Ron away. It reminded Draco too much of himself.
He sighed, knowing that he wasn’t going to get anywhere. He didn’t want to push Harry further than he was comfortable with. “Fine. What do you want to talk about?”
me inside. Do you know how hard it is for me to sleep in the same room as him at night? To see him at every meal, to run into him every waking minute, and I just have to sit there and pretend to hate him?”
The next chapter is my absolute FAVORITE, It’s been in my head since I first thought through the idea for this story, so I’m really excited to finish it and to have you guys read it. This chapter is a very close second favorite, though!
It wasn’t long before the sun rose, before the rest of the castle began to awake. He flew gracefully to the ground, dismantled his broom, and walked back to the castle, eager to get the day over with.
“No!” She laughed, trying to lighten the mood. “It’s just that you called me unattractive, that’s all-”
The two of them whipped around to see Potter standing in the middle of the common room, shocked to see the two of them talking together.
He felt stick to his stomach, his hands were sweaty, and he could not stop his knee from bouncing up and down. He had seen her in class earlier today, but hadn’t seen her at dinner. Maybe she got sick between class and now, and was laying in a bed in the Hospital Wing, hurt and-
He broke from his train of thought, watching her sit across him, grabbing even more books from her bag and organizing them into near piles.
“Relax, Lucius. How can you be so cynical on a day like today? Our boy, our baby boy, is finally off to Hogwarts. Oh, I am just
” he lowered his voice, gesturing over to Umbridge’s seat at the staff table. “I feel like it is second year all over again, and I feel like I am not safe at Hogwarts.”
Draco was stunned. He was only expecting Harry to apologize for breaking his nose, but no, he had gone all the way back to the beginning and apologized for every single thing that he had done to Draco, and he was
to assign all their essays and projects to be due on the same exact days? It had been like this every year, where everything was either due on a Friday or Monday. Couldn’t the professors just work something out? Why was it that McGonagall and Sprout
“Malfoy, can I ask you a question?” She asked quietly, as if she was afraid, and he briefly looked up from the cauldron to raise his eyebrows, signaling her to go ahead. “What- why did you defend me yesterday?”
Draco stared at the ground, shifting his weight between his feet. “I should get going to the station. The train will be here soon.”
He smiled. Harry Potter actually smiled at him? He was sure it was first, it seemed forced, it was a small smile that didn’t reach the rest of his face. But a smile nonetheless.
His hair, however, had to be magically styled. He found that no muggle product was advanced enough nor stylish enough to be of decent quality to him. He would dry it and slick it back, and every few days he would charm his roots to be a more platinum blonde rather than his usual dirty blonde. He would then change into his school robes, and at this point, the other boys would begin to stir and get ready for the day, heading down to the Great Hall for breakfast.
kissing him, and he was blessed with the opportunity of letting his fingers explore every square inch of his skin. And it was like he couldn't get enough of him, and he didn't want to stop until the sun came up.
“And second of all, you need to loosen your wand grip a bit. I would suggest,” he felt Harry place his other hand on top of Draco’s his fingers delicately, “loosening your thumb and middle finger just slightly, the rest of your fingers a little more.” His voice was barely a whisper, his mouth just inches from Draco’s ear, as he moved his fingers one by one.
and you aren’t leaving until you tell me.” Harry said, almost threateningly. He was beginning to wear Draco down, and both of them knew it. Draco could only keep up this cold facade for so long before he either burst into a ball of anger or ran away, just as he always did.
“No, I really do not!” Draco yelled, actually pushing him off this time. Potter nearly tripped over the bench behind him, and Draco moved closer so that he could point his finger in his face “What the bloody hell is your problem with me?”
of moonstone. You do not need to go off about the discovery in the beginning. It adds a nice perspective, but there is a limit.”
He sank into the seat and immediately felt at ease. He didn’t know what this place was, or how he had come across it, but he was certain that no one else would be here. It was exactly what he had needed.
And it hurt, because Draco knew that he had hurt Harry, too. He knew that he had been in the wrong, that he had a strong part in them not being able to be friends, but Harry was sitting here and taking all of the blame.
Draco shook his arm free, staring at his feet to avoid Harry’s gaze. “Hermione briefly mentioned that.”
After saying his final, formal goodbyes to his parents, it was just him and Potter. “Alright then, shall we find a spot?”
He groaned and put his head in his hands, gripping his hair as he tried to think. His head hurt from all the work he had been doing, his eyes were sore from reading his textbooks, and his stomach was growling because he had skipped dinner so that he could get it all done and still manage a good night’s sleep.
Happy Sunday! I rewrote the end of this chapter maybe three times, so I hope my work paid off. Honestly, I kinda struggled with writing this chapter and thought it was going to end up being pretty short. But it is officially THE longest chapter (so far)! So yay!
He started moving past Harry, refusing to make eye contact with him, when Harry grabbed Draco’s elbow and pulled him back. Draco felt the warmth of Harry’s hand through the sleeve of his robe, which was oddly comforting yet awkward.
Draco looked over at him and watched as his shoulders rose and fell in an uneven pattern. Yup, he was definitely still crying. He didn’t know what to do. He never had to comfort a crying person before. Was he supposed to say something? Was he supposed to do something? He surely wasn’t supposed to just sit there, but what was he supposed to do?
at the beater drills. He could always hit the ball with the bat, but it never went where he wanted it to go. He nearly took out one of the twins several times, which definitely made some of the teammates think he was there just to harm someone. But in all honesty, he was just quite terrible at being a beater.
“I could ask you the same thing,” Harry spat as he tightened his grip on Draco’s arms, pushing him even further against the wall. Draco felt his stomach drop “What the hell is
Draco was curious as to why Snape would mention his father’s letter to him. He rarely ever spoke of him, so it must have been of importance.
sorry. I panicked. Harry and Ron, they’re really dense. I didn’t know if they would understand. I shouldn’t have said that. Our relationship means a lot more to me than studying and academics.”
Draco instinctively wrapped his other arm around him as Harry’s fists grabbed Draco’s t-shirt. He buried his face in Draco’s chest with a sob. His cries were audible now, and Draco felt his shirt grow wet where Harry’s face was. He rubbed Harry’s arm with one hand and made small circles with the thumb of the other in an attempt to soothe him.
She was right. But why did he care? The whole school already thought he was a loser for the past god knows however many years, so why did he have to change that now?
At some point, everyone had thrown in their cards and given up on the game. Draco was leaning back on the couch, relaxed, while Ron and Harry were in an intense debate over something about Quidditch, probably about how Ron’s favorite team was absolute horse shit.
The first kiss had been cautious and gentle, a tentative dip in the water. This was nothing like that. It was if as soon as Harry registered that
with Harry, and comforting him after being punished by Umbridge had been sort of a big leap. On top of that, the moment they had shared after Weasley had left felt oddly intimate, and it was a big deal to him.
Draco sat down on the couch next to him, making sure to give him a foot or two of space. “I take it the lesson didn’t go so well?” He asked.
He still had no idea what his feelings were, or where they had come from. They seemed to come out of nowhere and hit him like a truck. He had never felt something like this before, and he wasn’t even good at processing his emotions when they knew what they were, so how the hell was he supposed to know what was going on inside his head? Was he supposed to be feeling this hurt whenever Harry let out another cry? Maybe that just meant that he cared for him, but at what point does he cross a line?
“Expelliarmus!” He yelled before Ginny could even get a sound out. Her wand didn’t fly across the room, but he managed to be faster than her. Harry was right, relaxing had allowed him to move his wand much quicker. A smile started to make its way onto all three of their faces.
He curled himself into a ball, feeling his face grow wet. A piercing feeling shot through his heart, spreading to his chest, which just made it hurt even worse when the eventual sob escaped his lips and shook his body.
Maybe it was because the word was directed at Granger. Again, he didn’t mind her, but it’s not like he was friends with the girl, either.
His jaw dropped. “You amaze me.” He hadn’t meant to say it out loud, and she was obviously uncomfortable. He cleared his throat. “Sorry. I-”
I really really love this chapter. Things are finally looking up, and I hope you enjoy it as well :)
about it. I don’t know why, and it’s not your fault, and I hated you for absolutely no reason at all and I am
He was on his way over to the dormitory, about to go up the stairs, when a group of boys came barreling down.
Or perhaps it was because he spent all summer locked up alone in a castle with minimal human interaction, and being around a few hundred at once made him so horribly irritable.
“How do I stop it from happening again?” He cut her off. He couldn’t imagine what would happen if something like that had happened during something important, like an exam, or something that could put him in danger, like in the middle of a Quidditch game.
Harry nodded, not making eye contact with Draco. They helped each other up off the floor and walked together, silently, back to the castle.
Opening his eyes, he saw that her face was bright red and her eyes were watery. “Can we put this behind us? You hurt me, but you had every right to be mad at me. I am sorry.”
He didn’t want things to change too much, though. He liked taking things one step at a time, slowly adapting his normal routine. He couldn’t just jump into a new one, that was impossible. Having one friend was fantastic, but it was almost too much for Draco. To have someone know everything about you, to spend time with you, made him the slightest bit uncomfortable. It made him vulnerable. He could not imagine opening up to more than one person. At least not at once. He was fine with Longbottom joining their group on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays because he really only ever talked to Hermione, it wasn’t like Draco was getting close to him as well.
He dove at top speed, being the first to do so. He got to the ball before anyone else was even close. The second he felt the leather touch his fingertips he pulled back up, causing two chasers from the other team to collide into each other below him.
“But I am right, am I not?” He raised an eyebrow, taking her silence as a yes. He sighed. “I do not blame you, I was being a dick. You had every right to be mad at me, but I had no idea to know that you were upset! How would you feel if
, huh?” Draco tried to come off as playful and joking as he had been with Harry, but it came off bitter and cold. Part of him was bitter, though, as she had broken a promise.
The first time he visited Madam Pomfrey was when Harry broke his nose. But that was just a quick walk down to the office. Now, he had woken up in a bed, and he had no idea why.
Draco felt a pang of something in his chest. Sadness? Disappointment? Jealousy? Perhaps it was all three, sad that he couldn’t disarm a fourth-year girl, disappointed that he had done so in front of Harry, and jealous that Harry was giving Ginny all the praise.
“Why are you being so difficult?” Harry demanded, but the rest of his words began to fade and Draco couldn’t hear what he was saying.
“Do not speak to me!” Draco yelled. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, his heart pounding. “This is your fault! You are the one who sat with me on the train, and
“Well,” Hermione cleared her throat, talking barely above a whisper. “Harry, Ron and I have been talking about that lately. We can’t just sit around and do nothing, but- we can’t talk about this here.” She cast a nervous glance around her. “We are going to meet in the library tonight, the same room that we have been studying in, Draco, at eight o’clock. Don’t tell anyone. If anyone asks where you’re going, Draco is tutoring us in potions.”
what people would say. The Slytherins would belittle him for befriending a muggle-born, just giving them another reason to shun him for all of eternity. Some people would be furious at Granger for ever trying to help such a pitiful person. Half the school would assume they began a relationship. That wouldn’t have been so terrible, it might hurt him inside, but it would preserve his reputation. It was better than if they found out the truth about his sexuality. But worst of all, he feared that people would begin to dislike Granger for hanging out with him.
“It is hard for me, for me to do this. But I am willing to try, and you need to be too. That means not blaming yourself for
She continued to list every single career you need an O.W.L. in arithmancy in as they packed up and walked out of the library. He continued to nod but wasn’t really listening.
Harry’s eyes fluttered open as he violently gasped for air, his body shaking when he did so. Ron breathed out a sigh of relief.
They awkwardly stood there, just staring at each other, not moving. “We should probably get going, I think Hermione will hex us if we are late,” Draco said.
The room was completely silent. It was empty apart from a large, plush armchair, a side table, and a fireplace with a warm, gentle fire.
After the school year, Professor Snape allowed him to stay at the Castle with him over the summer with the permission of Dumbledore. Draco stayed in a bedroom connected to an unused classroom, originally designed for a previous professor. Dumbledore kept this arrangement under the table, and the only people who knew about Draco Malfoy’s permanent residence at Hogwarts were the professors themselves. His parents had no idea where he was currently living, nor did they ever try to figure it out. Snape regularly wrote to them, being close friends, but never once mentioned Draco.
Potter stepped forward and grabbed his tie, pulling him into his face so that he could lower his voice. “Do all you want to me, I don’t give a shit. But when you hurt my friends, then it’s personal.”
“Potter also looks awfully ill, doesn’t he?” Draco asked Granger when they started moving. It was true, he had turned a sickly white and seemed even paler than his friend. He kept taking double-takes at the empty space in front of the carriage, as if he didn’t ride the same one every single year.
