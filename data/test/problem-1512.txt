“I’m glad you took me shopping today,” Harry said.
“It was,” Draco said. “
“Harry, where in Merlin’s name have you been?!”
“I don’t know…” Harry trailed off as he pounded harder onto Draco’s cock.
“Don’t tell me—”
Draco was so shocked, he slipped — the floor and his trainers were incredibly slick with melted snow. He fell forward, splaying his arms out to catch himself and protect the
“Yes,” Harry answered simply. “Malfoy and I have been… talking.”
“There!” Harry said. “By the door!”
Hermione nodded and passed the book across the table.
Realization finally dawned on Harry. “You’re writing our song, aren’t you?” Harry shook his head, but when he spoke again, Dragana could hear the smile in his voice, “You ssentimental Sslytherin.”
(Kreacher looking out the window of Number 12 Grimmauld Place.)
“It must be very old.”
Harry weakly reached his arms out for Draco, who quickly climbed into them. Harry buried his head in Draco’s chest, clutching the other man tightly to him.
Notes: It’s day 6! I hope you found this Drabble just as magical as I did ^_^ And I now have two wonderful Betas who have not only gone back to edit my already published chapters, but plan to help me throughout the month of December. Thank you, Vukovich and crazybutgood for your notes and feedback that will really bring my Drabble collection to the next level <3
in this horribly crowded market. Did you see how many people arrived just as we had finished our nuts and begun to look at the different
It's Day 21 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! I hope you love the allusions to the Christmas Rose tradition from my December Drarry Drabble <3 xo
He nodded fiercely. “Y-yes! Please.”
Please keep in mind: I am personifying magic in this chapter. Magic is represented in a visual way and the two of them can perceive it. They also have a very intense magical connection. These are things I would love to explore in a longer fic, but in this one shot I figured giving you a heads up would be better than going into all of that right now. I'll expand later, I promise ;)
Harry wished he could stop Ron from digging this hole, but once his best mate got going it was nearly impossible to stop him without ending up in the hole with him.
Harry didn’t respond. He stood still for a couple seconds, presumably in shock at the icy water on his skin. Then, he took his hand—no gloves, as though he hadn’t been planning on staying out for long—and wiped the back of his neck, clearing the rest of the snow that clung there.
“You’re joking.”
Draco chuckled. “A Malfoy would never. Actually, I have to confess that you chose the gift I was planning on giving you last.”
“Shh, it’s okay.” Harry tried to reassure him. “Breathe. Just breathe.”
Draco sighed loudly. “Please,
“Everything okay?” Draco asked.
Harry’s face contorted in disgust. “'The Vanishing Spell was also used until the 18
Draco groaned. “You can say that again. We’re supposed to lead this...this reformation of the school? Why us?”

missing and would discover it had been Draco. The Slytherin attempted to even out his breath, regretting not having warmed up beforehand.
“I would have never understood the epicness of this magnificent piece of architecture if you hadn’t have taken me to those places first.” Harry finally returned Draco’s grin and he felt tears form behind his eyes. “This is the most well-thought out and meaningful gift anyone could have ever given me, Draco. Thank you so much.”
The two men let their magic intertwine, resting on each other’s foreheads, eyes closed, and clasping hands. Harry breathed in deeply and showed Draco in his mind’s eye the perfect Christmas tree.
“I know it’s Christmas, Harry. That’s why I’m here, you
Draco raised an eyebrow, but surprise quickly slipped to irritation once more and he glared at Harry. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
“Finally,” Harry wrapped up his explanation, “Our song is the sound of the Earth…humming. Every night, when we are preparing for bed, casting spells of protection, health, warmth, and peace around our home, hearth, and hearts. When we reconnect our magic with its source and with each other—that hum is the sweetest sound I’ve ever heard. It’s my favorite song.”
I just,

He hadn’t
The other man had not moved from his spot, but he was sniffing his tea with disdain.
She wrapped herself in a fluffy blanket which her mother had helped her knit at the beginning of December. It had a Quaffle and three gold hoops knitted with the softest fabric Ginny had ever felt. It helped, of course, that her mother was quite gifted at domestic charms and had shown her a couple of family tricks. Ginny pressed her fingers lightly to the Quaffle, perfectly imperfect in her first ever knitted piece. She felt a sense of calm in her next breath as she concentrated only on the fibers softly tickling her fingertips.
“But…I guess I don’t want to wait anymore. Harry. I want you to be my husband.”
Feeling this, Draco stopped moving and withdrew a few inches. “Everything okay?”
“Here—” Draco grabbed one of the pillows and repositioned it. “Set yourself on this, then lie back, facing me.”
Harry grinned, pleased at having wound Draco up so quickly.
“You think it’s a good thing then that those Gryffinpuffs’ new common room has randomly appeared in the dungeons then?”
This, Harry thought cynically, was probably the whole reason they set up this fancy, shmooz-y “eat and shop” system in the first place:
It was, without a doubt, the strangest gift he had ever received. And he had received some very weird Christmas presents over the years—a fifty-cent piece, a toothpick, and a single tissue from the Dursleys, to name a few. Oh, and of course Dobby the House Elf had painted a portrait of Harry when he was 15. Although he’d found it weird at the time and hadn’t appreciated its uniqueness, Harry had grown immensely fond of it over the years and it was currently hanging in the upstairs bathroom. Maybe…he’d feel that way about this gift in a few years?
“So...” Malfoy said, and Harry slowly turned to look back at the man across from him.
,” Draco said, the word practically purring out of his mouth.
“Oh my God, that’s… that’s perfect,” Harry shivered and then gasped loudly as Draco hit a new spot inside him.
Draco’s eyebrows practically flew off his face, he raised them so quickly. “We are?”
Draco swallowed painfully over the lump in his throat and pointed his wand at the patch of snow he’d been sitting on. He said the incantation for a hot air charm, causing the snow to melt away and reveal the Earth underneath. Then, he sat down, defiantly.
“Look up,” Draco whispered. When Harry did, he saw the full moon right above them shining brightly over the water.
“'That being said, I cannot allow Hogwarts to stand undefended. Knowing what I know, I must do everything in my power to ensure Hogwarts will be able to adapt and heal after the devastating events that will transpire here. Therefore, I will be enchanting the castle with the spells I have crafted in this journal, but they will remain dormant until Hogwarts itself determines it is the right time. Then, Hogwarts will activate these enchantments and begin the process of adapting to the needs of the current students, as I have always said it should be doing all along. My dream has shown me that unity between the Houses and perhaps a dismantling of the Sorting System all together will be the only way to heal the school and progress into a better future.
“Oy, Dragana, loosen up, will you? Ow!”  He patted at her white-knuckled hands clasped around his waist.
“Very eager, are we?”
Malfoy nodded again. “You’re welcome.”
“I’m brilliant,” Harry replied. “I… I’m so happy right now.”
Harry packed the journal and the biography securely in his school bag, threw the Invisibility Cloak over the two of them and made to leave the room. Before he could take a step, however, Draco took his hand and pulled Harry against him.
Draco shook his head. “You don’t have to apologize for crying.”
Harry smiled at the word “love” falling freely from Draco’s lips again. “Makes sense. I mean,
“What are you doing here, Draco?” Harry’s tone was hushed and serious.
Harry glanced up from the journal. Draco’s head was still on the table, his face buried in his arms. Harry reached out a hand to gently rub Draco’s back. As he did so, he continued:
. What you’ve been through. The experiences you’ve had that brought you to the realization that the House system didn’t serve you, or me, or anyone. But particularly us.”
“How—Draco, the market is closing…” Harry trailed off and gestured towards the muggles who were packing up their little wooden huts. The muggle who had sold them the nuts was struggling with the metal hinges on theirs and couldn’t lock the window. Harry couldn’t resist using a bit of wandless magic. He lightened the burden on the contraption, which then glided smoothly into place on the muggle’s next attempt.
Harry opened the door and there stood Draco.
After a few seconds of silence, McGonagall said, “What did you mean, Mr. Potter, when you said you didn’t feel you had a ‘choice’ in whether you were involved with this?”
Malfoy smirked back. “Of course not.”
“Mate?” Ron asked. “You… ready to continue?”
Also: I havn't had a chance to edit this for my Americanisms. I hope they won't be too jarring to those British readers--I promise to do my research when I go back and edit everything when this month is over :*
“You just need to relax a little,” Draco said.
“I am.” Draco nodded. He took a deep breath, and his hands shook a little as they still presented the Nutcracker and the ring. “Harry James Potter…” He began, and at those three words, Harry felt the tears start to fall from his own eyes.
“I’ve started to really hate the entire House System, if I’m being honest. Remember what I said before, about how I think we should all embrace the characteristics of the different Houses depending on the situation? It’s because we all have the ability to be courageous, loyal, wise, or cunning—but being pigeonholed as just one is doing us all a huge disservice.”
“A beautiful sight… we’re happy tonight…walking in a winter wonderland!” Harry took his husband’s hand and spun him around, their kids giggling at their sides.
, let’s get you out of here before you cause a scene.”
“It’s true.”
“But that’s
“Fucking you did clear my mind of everything else, I must admit,” Draco said, winking cheekily.
“Shut up!” Ron murmured, crossing his arms. “I’m trying here.”

“Looks like the author was a bit of a fangirl, doesn’t it?” Ron asked, chuckling. Harry was about to laugh at the adulatory title, but caught himself just as Hermione and Luna glared at Ron, who stopped mid-chuckle.
“My dear, sweet Dragana. I love you, Dray, and Draco, and accept who you are with all of me. You're the one I wanna be in competition with. You’re the one I wanna chase. The one I wanna hold. I always knew there was something special about you, even as we skirted around this at Hogwarts. And to you, my love, I will always be faithful. I want us to be to each other what we always needed. I want you… and your beautiful soul.”
we were supposed to be going to bed, and you kiss me like that?”
“Oh, the usual,” Draco said vaguely. His answer every year.
“Sorry, love.” Dragana loosened her grip and took a few deep breaths.
Finally, Potter said, “Yes.”
“So not true—”
Harry felt his heart skip a beat but resolved to finally pluck up some of that Gryffindor courage he was famous for and turned his hand slowly around so their palms were touching. Then, one by one, Harry and Draco interlaced their fingers together.
Harry stopped abruptly causing the two of them to lose balance and Dragana to trip on her tulle skirt.
“Fuck proper timing,” Harry mumbled. Draco wasn’t sure he’d heard correctly, so he asked the other wix to repeat himself. “I said FUCK proper timing. When has the timing ever been right for us?”
“Take off your trousers,” Harry ordered. “Leave your pants on. For now…” The other man quickly obeyed and struggled a little in his haste to unbutton and remove his trousers, while blindfolded.
When Dray comes downstairs looking more delicious than the cookies Harry has just finished decorating, Dray must decide whether she’s willing to let go of all the hard work she’s put into this outfit…
Harry thanked her and placed the biography in his own bag.
Harry chuckled. “Come on.” He reached out his hand to Draco, who took it, his heart pounding in his chest.
“Magnificent, isn’t it?”
Still, Draco did not respond, but kept holding space for Harry, his memories, his emotions. As Harry had done for him many times before and would continue to do throughout their relationship.
“I can’t wait to spend forever with you,” Draco said, his voice, for the first time, unwavering.
Harry’s heart fluttered, already looking forward to the next day of Advent.
Harry glared at his best mate. “Look, I wasn’t sure how to tell you. I thought you’d react—well, just like this, actually.”
Draco saw tears forming in Harry’s eyes, but the other man blinked them away.
“Oh, Merlin! Papa, you can’t make everything into a Quidditch metaphor!” Albus Severus rolled his eyes dramatically and Draco’s husband let out a howl of laughter.

I love Drarry, you all know this. They're my OTP. And I know that there are a lot of people who hate Ginny. First of all, I validate those of you who have these experiences with and opinions about this character--I also occasionally enjoy a good fanfic that may be "Ginny Bashing." But I also want to think about this, as if it were a relationship outside of Fiction--what would have happened? If Draco and Harry are meant to be together (as I believe, they are, as we've established, LIFE, and my OTP heehee <3) what would have happened to Ginny who thought they were going to get together when the war was over and Voldemort was gone?
“What do you mean?”
Harry nodded, not yet able to speak.
“Dragana, I am appalled,” Harry deadpanned. “There’s a lantern right here in front of us.”
“Are you cold?”
“I am very freaked out,” Harry said, “but I
Draco approached the wards outside Grimmauld Place and waited.  And waited.
Harry felt tears burn behind his eyes, threatening to fall. He clasped his hand over his mouth and turned away, attempting to hide his face from them all. Harry tried to even his breath and ride through the wave of grief.
So, this smut chapter ended up being over 4K, WOW. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it with the help of my Betas <3 xo
But Draco could rise above this. He didn’t have to stoop to Potter’s level.
Harry’s heart pounded hard in his chest and his stomach leaped.

Draco laughed, caught red-handed.

“There’s a reason, Harry, just trust me. Please, may I continue?” Harry didn’t respond. “Please?” Dragana pressed.

Finally, Harry closed the journal, an action which seemed to bring the two of them back to the present moment. Draco exhaled loudly, and when he spoke, his voice cracked. “I… I’m speechless.”

“Yes, sir.” Kreacher nodded. “Shall I let him in?”
“Would you please check the wards with me? I think someone’s trying to get in. It might be Ron or Hermione.”
Before Draco could prepare, Harry placed his lips over his right nipple. “Ahh!” Draco said, his body shocked by the sudden intrusion, but quickly growing excited. Draco was soon panting and mewling, a sound Harry lived for in these moments. He enjoyed teasing the former Slytherin so much—and to prove it, he gently released his teeth, which he’d been protecting with his lips and started to nibble softly around the now hard nipple. Draco’s breathing slowed and deepened as he concentrated on the mutual feeling of pain and pleasure that Harry was giving him. Finally, Harry licked the nipple sharply, causing a gasp to escape his partner.
“Are you a wizard, or aren’t you?”
“Potter...” There was no malice in the word this time, “I thought you... Fuck. I thought you trusted me.”
“You had to. The teacher and other students didn’t know and might hear the dirty sweet nothings you

“Why?”
“Sneaking, then,” Harry amended.

A lumpy Christmas present caught Ginny's eye and she reached out to hold it.
Draco grinned. “So…what?”
“How the hell do you unintentionally make a Horcrux?!” Draco interrupted, beside himself.
Draco wrapped his fingers around the bell securely and nodded.
“You heard me. Whoever ends up having the most beloved Christmas crackers not only gets free reign for every future Malfoy-Potter Christmas Party—”
“Not when you’re acting suspicious as fuck, I can’t.”
“That’s not what I meant! I don’t just mean sexually. I—I can’t get you out of my head. When I think about you, it’s like my entire head is spinning and…I just want to be close to you.”

“Okay, so where was I?” Dragana shook her hair loose from where it had gotten caught under her collar, tossing it over her shoulders again, the silver-blonde an intensive highlight to the deep blue of the sapphires.
During their free period the next afternoon, Harry, Ron, and Malfoy were sitting in the Room of Requirement, which had transformed itself back into the meeting room from last night. The three of them sat together at one end of the table, consulting
Draco clutched it tightly as he bolted through the snowy courtyard.  Flurries of snowflakes fluttered about him happily, enjoying the burst of energy and attention on this icy, still, and deserted day in December.
“Gotta stay on your guard, Harry.” Draco examined the cloak. “This really is a true masterpiece.”
Draco’s moans were the loudest yet, and Harry could tell he’d pushed him so close to coming already. He quickly stopped rubbing his partner’s shaft, climbed on top of Draco, and slid himself slowly and teasingly onto Draco’s cock.
“Yes. Yes, of course they are,” Harry reassured, and leaned in to kiss him. Of course. Of course, he knew his answer. As he pulled away from his lover and their eyes locked, he knew Draco knew, too.
Harry nodded, eager to return to the reason they’d agreed to meet up in the first place. “I must admit, since coming back to Hogwarts, the only thing I’ve noticed is you.”
“And what about you? Any seeds you’re hoping to plant this month?”
“You’re so… calm about this,” Draco said, sounding slightly accusatory.
“I’m sorry to say that...” Harry cleared his throat again, “...tea is not one of Kreacher’s strong points.”

“Hey!”
“I thought the name sounded familiar! I think my Aunt Amelia was friends with Rowan during school. I’ve saved as many photographs as I could from her house after...” Susan swallowed. “After… she died… You know, a couple years ago.”
“Well, er, actually…” Harry coughed. “He made seven.”
Harry felt his heart leap at the suggestion.
Harry was already grinning from ear to ear before Draco had even gotten to his final point.
“Shut up, Draco.” Harry tangled his fingers in Draco’s hair, forcing Draco’s lips back on his. He was determined to enjoy every inch of Draco, and it seemed Draco had the same idea about Harry.
Harry tentatively lifted the camera.
Harry blinked and chastised himself for getting caught up in irrelevant details. He’d had enough of this.
things were different between you two.”
The dining room rang out in a chorus of cheers as Dragana tugged Harry off the ground and crashed her lips to his, sealing their engagement for a second time, pouring every ounce of love and trust into Harry, and feeling her fiancé return in kind.
Gryffindor. I will marry you.”
“It’s locked.”
Harry shook his head.  “Sweetheart, we have already succeeded. Come.” They released each other. “Let’s go down together.” He held out a hand for Dragana who took it, steadying herself. She then interlaced her fingers with Harry’s. The silk gloves between his fingers whispered dirty promises and Harry shivered. “I’m so happy. Tonight is going to be momentous!” Harry exclaimed as they turned to make their way down the hall, down the stairs, and to the main floor.
Draco took the expletive as an invitation to quicken his pace, which caused Harry to cry out. “Yes!”
Harry reached out and retrieved the tie. He kept his eyes on Draco’s as he intently wrapped and unwrapped the tie around his own hand and wrist.
She was radiant in her long royal blue sweetheart gown. The strapless bodice sparkled with crystals in an intricate and stunning beaded design, transitioning into a full tulle skirt, beads trickling down it.
“You can say that again,” Draco said. “I would love to have just a peek of that journal.”
…miracle. We always could have been. But you just wanted us to stay invisible. Like…” Draco swallowed. “It’s like you want us to be these shadows. And I just want you to realize—you have a choice. And you should choose me. And not her.”
“Look here!” Ron said, pointing at a particularly lengthy passage about the staircases. “‘At the turn of the 11

. The prat had woken him approximately 20 minutes ago, ordering him to put on his shoes and grab the Invisibility Cloak.
“Nah, older than that. And yet—” Draco swooped the Cloak over his shoulders and all of him but his head disappeared. “The Enchantment is flawless to this day. Hasn’t worn out in the slightest.”
“First, we went to Rome on our first holiday together, then we went to Greece that summer...”
“Well?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrows in question.
Professor McGonagall did so, obviously taking great care to keep her face neutral as she read.
“What did they say?” Draco asked.
Draco exhaled loudly. “This is remarkable. We’re actually going to read the words of Ravenclaw herself and discover things about Hogwarts no one ever has.”
“I’m good. Much better. But…” Harry’s eyes begged at him from approximately two inches down. “Please. Don’t make me go on the Underground.”
“So…” Harry trailed off.
It's Day 22 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! It's the beginnings of a super fluffy wonderful date in Hogsmeade <3 xo I promise, one day soon we will have more of this date!
Harry was not offended, in fact, he let out a much-needed burst of laughter.
“Green for go. Yellow for caution. Red for stop.”
“I want to be closer to you,” Draco whispered, wrapping his legs around Harry.
Harry frowned.

“Does this look good to everyone?” Harry asked, jolting Draco out of his thoughts. They had come to a halt in a part of the garden where they enjoyed having scavenger hunts with the kids in springtime.
"Very good. Or..." Harry conjured a little jingle bell and placed it in his lover's right hand, "drop this to stop."
Dragana gave him a short pinch in the side. The man yelped but let Dragana keep making her point.
Harry’s eyes widened and he let out an involuntary scoff. “Excuse me?”
“Oh, baby, you know I will.” Harry winked at him. Little strands of excitement, hope, and arousal wrapped around the grief and anxiety which, momentarily felt more grounded and peaceful inside him than just five minutes ago.

Harry’s grin turned slightly evil. Playfully evil. He remembered June 5th of this year quite well. He had tied Draco up with some magical ropes and gagged him with his old Gryffindor tie. What a brilliant idea, Harry thought mischievously, and wasn’t surprised at all when a nicely folded tie appeared on the blanket in front of them. Draco groaned, feeling outnumbered.
Draco frowned.
“Yes?”
“Well... what are we going to do now?” Draco asked.
She realized Harry was present with her. Ready for anything she wanted to say or didn’t want to say. She said it. “Why?”
“Yes, of course,” Scorpius answered, loud enough for the adults to hear and Harry snickered while Draco bit back a smile.
“Are you done y—"
he was sure about. Yeah, it had taken him some time to come to terms with his sexuality, with help and support from Ron and Hermione—but that he might actually be attracted to Malfoy?
“Now, Harry, are you paying attention? Look.  Do you see the façade in the center, which leads to the porch?”
The former Gryffindor took the Room’s Christmas present [a/n: a Santa-Snitch themed tie] and unwrapped it from his wrist. Then, very slowly he tied it around Draco’s eyes. The blond froze for a moment, shocked at the unexpected sensation around his eyes. But the sensation building in his trousers was a lot more distracting in that moment…
Harry moaned at the words and his hips bucked, trying to get closer to Draco.
Harry, I’m sure I could manage. But could you?”
Harry jumped and almost dropped the doll, but he quickly got a hold of himself when he realized it was just Draco who had entered the room. He turned, trying to hide the present as he did so.
Harry swallowed. “She saw a Gryffindor and a Slytherin, two young wizards, united by their love for Hogwarts and each other, helping to mend the divisions caused by the House System by starting the reformation.”
The first time Draco saw Harry after his hearing, a good three years later, the former Gryffindor was ice-skating with Weasley and Granger.
“Mmm…just like that…Fuck, Draco. That’s good.”
Draco frowned.  “I hope you’re not planning on skipping Potions to read that book. Your… Polyjuice potion was looking a little weak and could really use some attention—”
“What?” Alarmed, Harry tried to pull the book closer toward him,

“Everyone who is coming already knows Dragana’s coming. They’re expecting you.”
Ron was so taken aback by the admittance it took a second for him to regain composure. He cleared his throat. “Excuse me?”
. My make-up is all messed-up now.”
Sensations of pleasure began to overtake the discomfort, and then Draco stopped.
Harry’s heart was pounding in his chest and he found it difficult to breathe. “Fuck me.”
Malfoy tore his eyes away from Harry and glanced down at the First-Year who was squinting up at them, their lips pursed in an inquisitive expression that reminded Harry of Hermione.
“It’s you, Draco. This whole time…it’s always been you. I mean, of course, I knew I felt something for you when we were at Hogwarts, but...haven’t you wondered why ever since Ginny and I broke up, I’m always asking to hang out with you? No one else? You kept trying to encourage me to see Ron and Hermione or set up dates with other wixen or muggles…but this year…I haven’t wanted to be around anyone else as much as you. Or as often.” He paused, took a breath, and exhaled slowly. “It’s you, Draco. It’s always been you.”
“Everything…okay out there?” Draco asked, breathlessly.
Kreacher sighed melodramatically and placed the tea on the couch table in front of them.
“I was. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Voldemort tried to kill me in the Forest, as you know. He ended up not killing me, but that part of his soul.”
“Now, we strip,” Draco said, giving Harry a sultry look. Harry didn’t have to be told twice. As they removed their clothes, Harry felt himself growing aroused. He’d never gone skinny-dipping before, let alone with someone as beautiful as Draco.

“Draco.”
“Anyways, anyways!” Harry said, and his slightly elevated voice encouraged their guests to quiet down. “Dragana and I are truly embarking on a life together, and…like stories…life is full of unexpected twists and turns.”
“Good boy,” Harry said. He reached out to retrieve the Christmas lights the Room had thoughtfully provided for them.
.” Harry bit his lip to hide a grin.
“Are you really that cold, Potter?” he called again, softer than before. Draco knew it was useless and the bastard couldn’t hear him anyway. He paced the area, hoping to trigger the wards as many times as possible. He doubted the Weaselette’s magic was attached to the wards yet; she and Harry had only just officially begun going out again after the War. But he hoped to Merlin that Harry’s own magic was on edge, sizzling at being irritated by his relentless triggering of the wards.
“Fffuck, Draco—please, will you fuck me? I want your cock inside me, filling me up. I need it…
“So, I’ve got a question,” Harry said.
“I know,” Harry said, shaking his head in disbelief. “Hermione would
But he was pulled out of his musings about the evils of capitalism by the child exclaiming happily and ecstatically pointing at the jumper, which was good as new. The pink-haired wix grinned, obviously pleased at having sparked so much joy in the child. They were now gazing at the garment in astonishment, telling their parents to come look.
Strangely, the absence of his touch made Harry uneasy, so he turned to look at the man who had just apologized to him. Malfoy seemed to be waiting for Harry to turn around, and they instantly made eye contact. Harry found himself rooted to the spot, incapable of looking away. They were so close Harry could see his own reflection in Malfoy’s cool grey eyes.
“Can you… go faster? Please?”
Harry considered this. “Well, I don’t think we can answer ‘why.’ But...I think we’re already doing it.”
“Wow. It is…exactly as you described it,” Harry said delicately. It was true. The Christmas atmosphere was most definitely prevalent from the very first second, exactly as Draco had told him over tea that morning.
“It’s perfect!” Scorpius said and Albus Severus quickly nodded several times, his signature grin back in place.
He had barely escaped the Gryffindor Quidditch Team’s changing rooms without being caught. But it wouldn’t be long before Potter found his
instinct, flipped a switch in Harry’s mind.
“Do you want me to open it now?” Harry asked.
In fact, it felt as if her soul had splintered open, and there were miniscule cuts everywhere, inside and outside her body. Ginny felt her magic burst forth like a wave from the sea and crash over her. The sheer amount of magic and pain she felt coursing through her veins was intolerable and she began to cry.
“Well, don’t go bringing up
Draco bit his lip.
“I love you, too, Dragana,” Harry said, soft and tender.
Draco is on his traditional Christmas Eve walk when he serendipitously runs into Harry, Ron, and Hermione ice-skating. Draco has gone through a lot of significant changes in the past three years since the war and his trial where Harry spoke for him—and he’s now ready to tell Harry the things (at least some of them) that he’s been keeping secret since he was eleven years old...
Dragana (trans/gender fluid Draco) and Harry are taking a ride on the Firebolt. It’s midnight on Rosh Chodesh, and the two get talking about “their” song.
“I swear to Merlin this Room is ALWAYS on your side,” Draco mumbled, but his arousal was unmistakable as he practically salivated, looking at the Room’s most recent gift—an immensely kitschy improvised toy—a green tie with golden snitches bedecked in red Father Christmas hats.
“It shouldn’t be,” Draco and Hermione said in unison. They both cracked a grin and made a gesture towards the other, inviting them to continue. The unintentionally synchronous movement caused a ripple of laughter across the table.
“Kreacher, please, it’s no problem—” but the elf had already disapparated with a
“With me?” Draco whispered in his ear and Harry felt himself breakout in goosebumps.
They’d barely been speaking for 60 seconds, and both Draco and Harry had revealed something quite personal about themselves and their mental states. Their miraculous ability to be open and raw with each other so immediately did not go unnoticed by either of them, and they both blushed.
“Have you got anything…”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I wasn’t
“My dear Harry… I thought you’d never ask.”
Harry closed his eyes slowly. Then opened them again. “Yes, that was me.”
Harry.”
“I know.”
“You’re acting mighty suspicious right now, you know that?” Harry said, his voice sharp with annoyance.
It's Christmas Eve. Harry has just returned home, and it soon becomes painfully clear that Harry's breaking up with her. And if it's for the reason she thinks it is, she doesn't want to know the truth. She'd rather he tell her a lie.
Now, the two wixen’s competitive streak had only got worse since they’d gotten together. They were always trying to best each other at something—the best hot chocolate, the best date idea—and now Harry had had the brilliant idea to stir up a little competition around the Christmas crackers they would be providing for their loved ones.
“Mmm, yes, please…” Harry said.
Draco chuckled softly and sounding a little high he said, “This goddamn Room…Merlin…” he nodded. “Yes. Green.”
, the patron saint this church was built to commemorate who was revered as a healer for plague sufferers.”
Ron’s ears went red, but he smiled back and made a gesture that Harry interpreted to mean “You’re welcome, now please can we move on?”
The wix’s jaw dropped again, equally surprised at the breaking of tradition. They hadn’t discussed exchanging personal Christmas Crackers—Dragana had probably suspected they would just choose any which were left after the guests had chosen.
“Oh, yes, my sweet prince.” Harry leant down and whispered in Draco’s ear in the way he knew completely undid the former Slytherin. “How much do you want me to touch you?”
most embarrassing moment of my life, then, thank you very much!”
“It’s…well… No one’s ever made me feel like this.”
Harry smiled, tears forming in the corners of his eyes as he turned to face his lover and mouthed, “Thank you.”
Harry widened his eyes and Draco laughed, kissing him on the mouth. “Come. Let’s go. She’s invited us for tea this week, anyway, might as well make it a surprise visit!”
It was only after the War that he was able to actually start dealing with the trauma of his childhood. And now he's expected to be a grown-up: a grown-up wizard who grew up in a muggle family who hated him and all he was. An adult, who'd had to raise himself, who never had an actual parent in the house to teach him how to live, how to be a… well, just a person.
“But, please,” Harry said as a thought occurred to him. What if this wix blabbed to the Prophet or other paparazzi that Harry Potter had ordered something for his lover? “I need you to keep this transaction a secret,” Harry explained. “It’s a surprise.”
Draco thought as his hands lifted the lid of the box. Inside he found... a stack of parchment. All clearly letters. And all addressed to…Draco.
Ever so slowly, one article of clothing at a time, the two of them undressed the other. As soon as they were both completely bare, Draco stepped close enough that their legs and already half-hard cocks grazed each other. With his fingertips, he traced Harry’s collar bone, his neck, his chest. Harry brought his own hand to the small of Draco’s back and began to trace up his spine before venturing back down. Harry had never felt this intimacy with anyone before, and he felt himself melt into Draco as they caressed each other, occasionally stealing kisses.
Summary: Draco has a second surprise for Harry, one that he hasn’t yet mentioned. A grave mistake that he soon realizes as the Adventmarkt am Karlsplatz draws to a close on Christmas Eve.
Ron’s eyes widened. “Oh, Merlin. I
“I... I did.”
” Dragana snarled. She scooped the skirt up with a flourish and inspected it for harm. Seeing nothing, she huffed and let it fall. The tulle floated back down to the floor and Dragana punched Harry in the arm.
Draco sighed. “That one. You chose that one.”
“Wha—?” Harry began, but then Draco’s lips were on his. The way Draco kissed him made Harry go lightheaded and weak in the knees. It seemed the other man was trying to convey as much love as possible as he kissed him underneath the Invisibility Cloak, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Surprising himself, he felt tears welling in his eyes and returned the kiss, matching Draco’s intensity.
The rest of them murmured in agreement.
“I guess I never asked before… but where does trash go when wixen throw it in a bin?”
“What’s this?”
“You’re right, it was,” Hermione said. She sounded thoughtful, and she kept looking back and forth between Harry and Malfoy. Her expression was similar to the one she sported when she was stumped by a particularly difficult exam question. “You trust him,” she said finally. Her statement was aimed at Harry.
The Room must have dropped the invisible barrier it had conjured, for Draco now heard the Gryffindor pounding on the door and shouting expletives at him through the wood.
“Good,” Draco said, reaching a hand for Harry’s cock and stroking it.
“How are you?” Draco whispered.
“Thanks. Well, it really shouldn’t be possible for these enchantments to be breaking! In Chapter 7 of
“I’ve felt this way for a really long time.”
“I will.” Harry’s voice cracked and he laughed at himself before clearing his throat and repeating, “I will, Draco. Of course, I will marry you. I want to be your husband.”
Harry. It must have felt to him more like an ambush. Harry had known there was
She found some words and blurted them out in between sobs, probably partially unintelligible to Harry, but it didn’t matter. “I know we didn’t mean to hurt each other. But this fucking hurts, Harry. It cuts. Like knives, everywhere, all over my body. And I’m just so…tired. I’m so tired.” A new round of sobs, and Ginny felt herself go dizzy, so she lay her head down on Harry’s chest and the man stroked her hair. He’d always been so tender with her whenever she’d cried.
“Are you even listening to me?” Dragana was snapping her fingers to get Harry’s attention.
it this time. To help us understand Ravenclaw and Hogwarts more.  I have a feeling it would really help us solve this myst—”
Professor McGonagall knitted her eyebrows together. “What do you mean by that, Mr. Potter?”
“Does it?” Ron squeaked. “Harry… are you really… in love with him?”
As Harry stepped under the cloak, his side pressing firmly to Draco’s, he tried, unsuccessfully to stop shaking.
we should probably head back to the dormitory and sleeeeeep.” He drew out the last word for emphasis and Draco chuckled.
proposal.
“Dragana…our song…is the sound of echoing footsteps in the deserted corridors at Hogwarts. Sneaking to the Room of Requirement all through sixth year.” Harry took a breath and continued. “When we were whispering to each other in the back of classrooms, and you spoke so slowly.” Harry moved his lips and tongue languidly around the words.
!” he corrected. “It’s the most important gift I’ve ever picked out for someone.”
Harry felt the magical wards protecting Grimmauld Place trigger and he froze. He hadn’t been expecting anyone so late. Who did he know who would call on him so late?
It’s date night! In Hogsmeade? Harry muses about where Draco might be taking him and he’s stunned when they arrive…
“Can you give me a verbal yes, so I know you’re ready?” Draco pressed a hand to Harry’s cheek.
“We really appreciate you taking the time,” Harry added, “and for… well, taking us seriously.”
Dragana narrowed her piercing grey eyes at him. “You just said your Christmas crackers would be better than mine, ‘no if’s, and’s, or but’s.’ Sure sounds like you want to take the reins, Santa!”
“It was hidden in the walls of the Room of Requirement,” Draco explained. “Must have been under a very powerful stasis spell.”

Draco rolled his eyes. “You tosser. You know what I meant.”
“You’re quite right. It is common for the people in the portraits to move around, use objects, and visit other paintings. But they always come home. They have to. Or else their magical enchantments would start deteriorating, and they’d be lost forever.”
“When you try and murder a baby who was prophesized to one day defeat you.”
It looked like Mrs. Norris was sniffing around the dungeons and Filch was on his way to the kitchens.
“Alright then. Enjoy.”
“I’m looking for my quill and some parchment...”
Harry turned to look at him, and Draco immediately put his arms around him, pulling him into a tight and tender embrace.
“I’m gonna — Draco, I’m gonna co—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because… it sounds ridiculous, even to me.”
Then, finally, Draco readjusted their bodies to look him directly in the eyes. “I love you, too.”
“Let me see!” Susan said, and Draco passed the book along.
“But Gin, that’s not true—”
at tall wooden tables were pleasantly startled.
turned out.”
“Oh, no,” Draco reassured. “It’s nothing like that. I just…am trying to get my thoughts together.”
“So. What’s going on, Malfoy?”
Harry laughed, having successfully flustered Draco into an adorable mess.
He turned towards his guest. Draco was handling his cup of tea with curiosity and concern.
“What…um…which present did you choose to peek at?” Draco asked, and Harry was shocked to hear a bit of worry in his voice.
“That doesn’t sound like a good idea,” Harry said. “What if there was an emergency and something
It was a crisp winter afternoon, and Draco was sprinting across the Hogwarts Grounds as quickly as he could manage without jostling Harry Potter’s broomstick.
“Mmm… can’t help it,” Harry said. “Do you know what you’re doing to me?”
Draco nodded. “I know I give off that impression. But… despite what I’ve always been taught to believe, I think there are traits in all houses we should all wish to emulate in different situations. Anyways—” He turned back to Susan. “As much as I value learning more about Hogwarts founders, I assume there is a reason you are mentioning this to us. And a reason you were looking for more information about her today, just as Hermione was aiming to check out that biography about Rowena Ravenclaw.”
“Yes. Rarely, though. Why would we want to use technology invented by people who chased us down, trying to burn us at the stake?”
“And this year we decided to compete and see who could come up with the best Christmas crackers for you all—our loved ones.”
“Shh…now did I give you permission to speak?” Harry smirked.
“I want to know.”
He extricated himself from Draco and stood up, shakily. He threw the Invisibility Cloak over the two of them and led Draco out of the Trophy Room and upstairs to the Seventh Floor.
she would know how to work with the Board of Governors to actually implement some educational reform. Plus, she’s been working on this Hogwarts mystery ever since the start of term. We should
“Stop!” Draco said, lifting his head in alarm.
Harry didn’t have a chance to respond, for in that moment Hermione entered the Room… followed by two other wixen.
Harry leaned comfortably into Dragana with a content hum—but Dragana wasn’t finished.
“Y-yes,” Harry said. “Yes.”
Draco did. He squeezed Harry’s hands and the two locked eyes as Harry tried to guide them both into breathing deeply in unison.
“I’ll be right there,” Draco reassured him. He slid off the condom, tying it in a knot and placing it in the bin.
“Would you like to…join us?” Harry invited him, and the Snitches returned to Draco’s stomach in full force.
Day 3 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! The newly married pair tries to go Christmas shopping at "Harrodz" (a wizarding department store that closely resembled the muggle "Harrods.") Little does Harry know (and let's be honest, I, the author, also had no idea this was going to happen) that he's going to be working through some past childhood trauma with the unconditional love and support his new family--Draco.
“It’s my favorite joke!”
“Oh, for the love of Merlin, please, shut up, I can’t take it anymore,” Dragana begged.

The snowball splattered across the back of Harry’s neck and the water dripped over and into his jacket.
“Actually, Professor,” Harry said, “in the interest of full disclosure, I had been following Draco because I thought he was behind it all.”
Harry sighed in relief. “That’s excellent to hear, thank you.”
...tea. But he appreciated Kreacher  for trying, nonetheless.
Yes. While you were taking your sweet time touring the portrait gallery, I realized that Gryffindor’s had just completely vanished.”
“NO!”
“In that single moment, I fell in love with you a thousand times over.”
Malfoy glared at him. “First of all,
Harry placed his own mug back on the table. “Why are you here, Draco?” Harry asked. He made sure to sound as open and non-judgemental as possible, trying to put the other man at ease.
“I know, love, I know.”
“You… you’re welcome,” Harry finally said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I did believe I was doing the right thing when I defended you and your parents.” The guilt had risen, and Harry swallowed over a developing lump in his throat. He blinked and looked away, walking back to the table. Malfoy followed him, and the two sat down across from another once again.
on the way to the 7th floor .
Step 3. Show off their impressive wand and spell work that (oh, imagine that!) must go into each and every one of the items they sell at "Harrodz."
Ron scoffed, stood up, and approached the two of them, Hermione following behind.
“You know why I’m here.”
“I want—could you please—choke me while I come? Sir?” Draco’s cheeks had flushed red as he asked the question, and Harry considered. Or at least he pretended to consider, tracing his fingers around his lover’s collarbone and neck.
“I’m fine,
Harry and Dray attempt to have a Christmas quickie before their guests arrive--but due to distractions they might very well be late for their own party…
Harry and Draco have settled in the Room of Requirement to celebrate Christmas their first year as Hogwarts professors. Things get quite steamy in front of the fireplace with a string of multicolored Christmas lights ;)
“You don’t seem happy?”
He came a short time later, long strings of cum landing all over his naked stomach and chest. Harry groaned in satisfaction at the release, then quickly glanced towards Ron—who was thankfully still fast asleep. Harry sighed and stroked himself until the very last bit of cum had dripped down his shaft and over his fist.
“Oh!” Harry said, just remembering. “Before you took off for the dungeons, I realized the portrait of Godric Gryffindor was missing, replaced by three smaller paintings I’d never seen before.”
“'It is true, that if Hogwarts were to start shifting around, it would cause confusion and concern. That being said, there is an argument to be made that though change is often confusing and concerning, Ravenclaw was leaps and bounds ahead of her time in realizing that change is often necessary if we are to advance as a society and improve upon our traditions and abilities.’”
Harry said nothing, but swept Draco’s blond hair back with his free hand. It had grown exceptionally long in the last months, as Draco had no desire to cut it, enjoying the longer style.
When Draco made contact, Harry moaned. “Please… more.”
Ginny leant back against one of the two early Christmas presents she’d received from her mom: a pillow with fancy script and the words: “Wake me up when winter ends.” The second pillow was on the other side of the sofa and simply said: “Brrrrrrrrrrrr.” Ginny remembered her mother gifting her the pillows on the Solstice. Mum had hinted that she’d done some tricky charmwork on the thread as she’d sewn so the pillows would give off a soft magical pulse of calm.
“'Although all founders were heavily involved in the architectural planning of the castle and its grounds, Ravenclaw was the brilliant mastermind behind the magical architecture. It is common knowledge that she crafted the ever-changing floor plan of Hogwarts. It is less well-known, however, that it is rumored she wished for the castle to remain ever in flux—occasionally restructuring itself to better fit the needs of the staff and students, adapting with the modern times. Given that it is highly well-documented that the rest of the Hogwarts founders believed in the power and strength of tradition, it can be assumed that the majority of Ravenclaw’s numerous architectural plans were dismissed as “too radical” or “unnecessarily problematic.”
It was much easier to understand how Ron was feeling. His ears were beet red, and he was fuming.
“You’re reckless, you know that, Potter?”
(Picture of a snow and ice encapsulated Hogwarts/Clock Tower with snow flurries everywhere.)
Harry honestly couldn’t believe his ears
“You won’t ever get…this right…” Ginny repeated, trailing off. “You mean…us?”
Harry nodded quickly. “Yeah. Sorry about that.”
“Oh, hold your Hippogriffs, Potter.”
Ron crossed his arms. “I’m reacting like this because you’re keeping us out of the loop.
When they arrived in the entry hall, Kreacher stood at the window and gazed out.  His eyes searched the cold, dark winter night for the person, or people, who had triggered the wards at 10 past 10 on a Monday evening.
“I assure you, Professor, we are quite aware,” Harry said quickly. “However… I don’t think we really have a choice in the matter.”
Draco renewed his laughter, and Harry joined him, shaking his head in disbelief. “A Malfoy, really? In public, like this?” Harry’s tone was light and playful.
“Here,” Harry said and placed the box in his hands.
“No!” Ginny cut him off sharply. She realized with a start that she was looking down at Harry. When had she stood up?
Malfoy’s face fell. “Er —you’re right,” he said.
Draco narrowed his eyes.
He and Dragana had agreed he’d be the one to start the speech. They were going to do it now, just before handing out the Christmas crackers. It was time to tell them all that he and Dragana were engaged. Harry stood next to his chair and looked down in adoration at their friends and loved ones: the Weasleys and Fleur, Andromeda, Teddy, Narcissa, Blaise, Luna, her father, and Neville.
“You’re
“It’s…it’s…” Harry couldn’t find the air to finish his sentence, and simply laced his fingers in between Draco’s and squeezed, his eyes glued to his ring.
Physically healthy people can't be created by being malnourished or starved—a mentally healthy person isn’t going to just rise from the ashes like a phoenix. Not when they're abused every day; forced to hide their true selves behind another's toxic beliefs about them.
“Harry, this midnight ride is one of the most romantic ideas you’ve had in awhile—”
Despite all the…horror of that year, they had connected every couple weeks: sharing passionate kisses and finally exploring each other’s body more intimately than either Draco or Harry had been willing to admit to their friends at the time. Ron, the rest of the Weasleys, Hermione, as well as Blaise were now all very informed about the seriousness of their relationship.
(Image: a feminine person with long wavy brown hair and brown skin wearing white nail polish, white heels, and a blue dress. For a more detailed description of this dress, please continue reading the story!)
In the quiet evening hours, Harry crept towards the common room door.
Harry stopped in his tracks, his hand freezing in mid-air, inches from the handle.
“Draco...” Harry warned.
Draco bit his lip, as if trying to hold back a smile. “Go on,” he encouraged. “Keep reading.”
He knew that by the time he met someone— probably sooner rather than later— and decided to settle down and have a family, he would have more tools in his toolbox.
“Sit your arse down!”
“But to think it’s been here for over 1000 years! It’s in pristine condition, too… it must have been under one hell of a stasis charm in there,” Draco said.
Harry heard and sensed Malfoy step out from behind him and reveal his presence to Ron and Hermione. Almost comically, their eyes widened and Ron’s mouth dropped open in shock.
“Move this along, mate!” George shouted along the table
Three notes before we start ^^
“Yes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shut the fuck up, Potter...” Draco said groggily, stifling a yawn.
“You never answered me you know,” Harry said, putting on a fake pout in Dragana’s direction.
Thinking of which, the Room seemingly raised the volume around the doorway once again.
Draco rested his forehead on Harry’s and they both caught their breaths. “Harry… I can’t believe you’ve done this.”
and Dragana was not convinced that this was the smartest idea her reckless Gryffindor had ever had. Granted, Harry'd had way worse.
he thought.
At any other time in his life, Draco would have been uncomfortable with the reaction and the subsequent reactions of Weasley and Granger. But now, he saw the comedy in it—as much of a shock as it was for him to see Harry here, it was probably just as startling for Harry to see his former “archenemy” turned ally during the Battle of Hogwarts.
When she could let out a few words she said, “I fought so hard for this. For
“Well…I see you haven’t finished opening it,” Draco said.
“Happy Christmas, my love,” Harry whispered into the quiet room, holding Draco tightly as he slipped off to sleep.
As the entire story started to unfold, the room rang out in wild laughter.
Potter glared at Malfoy again, fury rising in him. “Fuck you, Malfoy. I don’t do publicity stunts.”
“I love you, Draco,” Harry replied, and the two pulled away slightly to give each other a soft peck on the lips.
spells . He saw
Harry jumped at Draco’s sudden outburst. He noticed Draco was trembling wildly and quickly reached out to hold his hands in his.
“Are you ready for your reward?”
“Unfortunate indeed,” Harry said, and turned the page. “Here’s some notes about Hufflepuff’s ideas for implementing House Elves at Hogwarts. ‘Though I agree with Helga’s initiative to give House Elves a safe work environment at Hogwarts, she will not heed my concerns about a potential uprising in the future. My prophetic dreams about conflicts between witches and wizards and other magical beings have, to my great frustration, been dismissed. I am certain one day House Elves will no longer accept their subservient role in our society. I’ve discussed some potential enchantments with her for the kitchens and the Great Hall which would make it possible for students and staff to be fed without using the Elves, but, again, I have been overruled.’”
“And now you regret it?”

This is part 4 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry, but part 2 of the fic started on Day 2, so be sure to go back and read "I swear to Merlin this Room is ALWAYS On Your Side..." before this chapter if you wanna really... set the mood ;)
“Beloved friends and family, wixen of all ages!” Harry held his tumbler of Firewhisky up in a toast and the glass reflected the twinkling fairy lights which illuminated the dining room of Grimmauld Place.
Harry was intrigued to hear Draco was just as aroused as he was simply from giving Harry pleasure and knowing Harry wanted him. He decided to beg some more, to see how much he could drive the other man wild. “Pleeeeease, Draco. Fuck, I need you to fill me with your thick cock. Pleeeassse fuck me, Draco!”
A/N: It’s Day 14 of Draco and Harry and here’s some more trans/gender fluid Dragana loveliness <3 xo In case it isn’t painfully obvious, this fic is inspired by “Our Song” by Taylor Swift.
Yes, the Weasleys had always allowed him to crash during the holidays ever since he became friends with Ron—and he loved them dearly for it. But now that Harry finally had Draco—yes, finally—he was ready to start his own traditions. Draco already had some fond memories and traditions to draw on for inspiration, but this was something Harry realized he had lacked during the most formative years of his life, until he left for Hogwarts.
“It’s improved significantly,” Harry confirmed, though reluctantly.
And finally,
Malfoy protested, indignant.
Harry had been staring at the
“S-i-r-i-u-s—ly,” Harry said. “Molly still cannot believe that I have stolen Christmas from her, but she has no idea how magnificent and magical the first Potter-Malfoy Christmas party is going to be.”

Luna continued her story where she’d left off. “So, we’re watching them scramble about the kitchen and Susan asks them ‘Why are you in such a hurry? Dinner isn’t for another five hours.’”
Draco shook his head. “No, sir.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you ready?” Harry whispered, kissing his way down Draco’s chest and stopping exactly where he knew Draco would let out a frustrated moan. Draco did not disappoint.
“Don’t portraits always change a little?” Harry asked, a little embarrassed at his lack of knowledge in this magical department. “I mean, the Fat Lady visits her friends, Sir Cadogan jumps from one frame to the other… Isn’t it normal for magical portraits to just… look different sometimes?”
“I’m sure McGonagall will let you look at it,” Ron said. “Sometime.”
Draco listened and didn't speak for a while after Harry finished. He knew it was because Draco wanted to be sure he was finished, and he gave his lover a small nod to signal this to him.
Dragana sighed and placed her hands on her hips and Harry’s cock twitched.
“You know it,” Dragana replied. She was already nose deep in the parchment, the quill scratching away…
“Nope. That was Lorenzo Mattielli, who was inspired by Trajan’s column in Rome.”
Dragana was shaking with anger—but also pure joy at Harry’s absolutely
Draco frowned and Susan flushed and glanced quickly between him and Harry, not keeping eye contact for more than a couple of seconds.
“Malfoy,” Hermione said, greeting him gently, but with caution. She then turned her attention back to Harry. “Have you been with Malfoy since you wolfed down your supper and took off
“You’re so worth it, Dragana,” Harry whispered. His skin was still flushed with residual embarrassment, but Dragana noticed the teardrops in Harry’s eyes, threatening to fall, and finally, one fell, gliding smoothly down Harry’s cheek and lingering at the bottom of his chin. Dragana quickly leant forward to put her lips to it in a tender kiss. The salty taste spread across her taste buds as she sent a pulse of her magical energy into the other wix.
Harry wasn’t sure what to make of this new information. This experience sounded unbelievable, but so did most things that had happened to Harry in his own life. Unable to figure out an appropriate response to Draco’s confession, Harry found himself stroking Draco’s knee with his thumb. He hoped the gesture, regardless of his inability to find words, was reassuring to Draco. Harry wasn’t going anywhere. He didn’t judge him, and, above everything, he trusted Draco.
“You’ll need some skates…I’m sure Hermione can transfigure some for you.”
“Mm-hmm?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re not telling me you’ve put a first-year level locking spell on this thing.” He pulled out his wand and murmured, “Alohomora.” The box clicked.
He dove in. “I was watching you, laughing there with your friends in the snow, and—” Draco trailed off and took a deep breath, regaining the courage to complete his thought. “And you looked beautiful.” A thought occurred to him. “You still look beautiful, now, of course!” Feeling he was absolutely done for, Draco continued digging himself a bigger hole, “Not just now! I mean in general you do, too, I just meant…specifically just now you looked—”
Ron’s eyes went wide as dinner plates and Hermione’s eyebrows shot straight up. Susan’s mouth rounded in an “Oh!” and Luna said, “Mmm….makes sense.”
“JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION, DRAGANA!” George shouted, and a chorus of, “Yeahs!” echoed him.
Draco blinked once. Twice. Then his face screwed up, his eyes narrowed, and his eyebrows knitted together as he scanned the first page:
Harry cleared his throat so as to give the guests a chance to hide their own laughter with hacks and coughs at carefully curated interludes.
Susan nodded in agreement. “Very impressive detective work,” she complimented.
“I feel a little torn. Like, do I deserve to read this? This can’t have been meant for
let her know we’ve solved it so she can stop worrying.”

“Oh, no?” Harry couldn’t believe that after two years, Draco had finally got him hooked on this stuff too.
Draco nodded, the grin breaking out across his face. “And you know why, don’t you?”
Ron straightened up and rubbed his eyes. “Yeah, mate. We’ve been worried sick—”
“You’re right,” Dragana backpedaled, “I just meant, this is particularly splendid—you really outdid yourself this time, spoiling me. I don’t deserve this.” She tapped Harry on the shoulder so he would turn to face her. When he had, Dragana batted her eyelashes at him, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
Harry’s irritation quickly subsided. “I’m sorry I tried to guilt-trip you. I just…was a little embarrassed, I guess. At being caught.”
“Thank you, Professor,” Draco said, his voice breaking slightly.
Harry’s suspicions didn’t completely evaporate in that moment. But his gut instinct, maybe his
“Well, for instance, mealtimes have been pushed later and later since the beginning of term. And when a plate is empty, it takes ages to refill, if it does at all.”
“You’re doing so well…” Draco said as he slowly released his finger to apply more lube. He pressed two fingers to Harry’s entrance, and Harry exhaled, relaxing into Draco’s fingertips.
“Malfoy,” Harry cut her off, “Do we have a deal?” he offered his hand.
**Summary**
e laden with decorated Christmas cookies (including stockings, gingerbread men, and a Santa jumper) tea light candles, and different pies.)
“Now.” Harry said firmly. “Better?”
Draco took Harry’s hand and they walked toward the four-poster bed the Room had conjured for them.
refused to lift. In fact, he was starting to get some strange looks from a decrepit pensioner in Number 11—they glared daggers at him through the window beneath their wide-rimmed glasses—and Number 13—a young child with a pacifier who stood just in a nappy, both hands pressed to the window. “STOP PRETENDING I’M INVISIBLE AND BRING ME SOME FIGGY PUDDING, MOTHER FUCKER!”
**Ohhh another note, as I do a final read through :D I use the term "wix" to describe a gender neutral magical human and the pronouns they/them to refer to magical humans Harry does not (yet) know the correct pronouns for.
“Are you ready to come in?”
However, Harry and Draco’s intense eye contact was more than enough to cause some shifty movements and Ron let out an awkward cough.
Draco saw Harry lift his chin, a sign he recognized as the other man asking to be kissed, and Draco happily obliged. The two stood there, huddled warm, snowflakes from the First Snowfall landing and melting on their eyelashes, Scorpius and Albus Severus throwing snowballs and shrieking joyously, having gone and gotten themselves distracted from their hunt for firewood. But there was no rush. They had time. Oh, yes. They had all the time in the world.
Harry clutched Draco, both of them shaking from the intensities of their orgasms.
Harry couldn’t help grinning, “Well, there’s a first time for everything, I suppose.”
Draco smiled at Harry then turned to Professor McGonagall. “I suppose we should start with a confession,” Draco said. Professor McGonagall raised her eyebrows as Draco continued. “Harry and I have been searching for clues and attempting to solve the mystery behind the strange things that have been happening at Hogwarts since the start of term.”
Suddenly, Harry felt a distinct rush of arousal flow through him and to his cock which twitched eagerly.
Of course, neither Harry nor Ron owned the book themselves, but Malfoy’s looked just as worn as Hermione’s, which Ron was flipping through while Harry scanned the pages of the copy the Room had summoned for him.
“Winky told us that apparently the charms on the flatware are acting incredibly finicky. And the magical enchantment connecting the Great Hall tables and those in the kitchen is apparently weakening with every meal.”
“Hmm…now I’m not sure I should. I don’t think you really want it,” Harry teased, hoping for Draco to take bait. He was not disappointed.
That's all for now, and please feel free to leave a comment :D
, you would know this information?”

time. A new evening, at sunset instead of midnight, a second particularly magical
Ron and Hermione returned to the couch and Harry and Malfoy sat in the two armchairs on either side of it. They filled them in on what had happened the other night—the missing and frozen portraits and running into the First-Year Gryffindors with Hufflepuff badges in the dungeons. Harry admitted he’d been following Malfoy because he seemed suspicious, but he and Malfoy had agreed to move forward and put their pasts aside to work together on this mystery.
Harry leaned forward and whispered in Draco’s ear. “You like that little spark of danger when I flirt with the
“You really are very much a Ravenclaw in many ways,” Harry said, lacing his emerald green gloves with Draco’s silver ones.
“It was
“I suppose we are. Come on, then. You ready?”
“Harry, Harry, Harry… Do you think I’d allow that to happen? Don’t you trust me?”
I honestly cannot believe that Day 25 is over. I know it sounds a bit cheesy, but this 25 Day Advent Challenge has changed me signficantly. My entire approach to writing has been uprooted and shook around a bit, being replanted in a brand new garden. Three actually. A03. Tumblr. Discord. This is only the beginning. But this was such a wonderful experience.
“I did. I just like to tease you.” Harry grinned. “If I’m being honest… I think the best thing to do is tell Professor McGonagall.”
The older wix reminded Harry so much of Tonks with her hair, charm and knack for entertainment. As Harry and Draco passed the kiosk, Harry squeezed the other man’s hand, lest the wave of grief crash too hard in that moment.
Draco’s mouth dropped open. “What are you, five?” Draco glared at Harry, and though it was the same glare Harry had been seeing since Hogwarts, it still irritated him. He glared back.
“Yeah, we’re
Harry snorted. “Honestly, Draco, why are we at the lake in the middle of the night?”
Harry shook his head in disbelief. “But… how could you?”

It's Day 15! I can't believe there's only ten days left, and it also feels like a lifetime away bahahahaha. I hope you enjoyed <3 xo
“I said ‘yes!’ for fuck’s sake, Potter—”
“Oh, yes! Of course— I’ll get it.” Dragana reached into her pocket for the Expandable Bag, and pulled out the gayest radio. To be more specific, this gay radio was queer as fuck. It was rainbow (black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) on one side and trans pride on the other (blue, pink, white, pink, blue).
Before Harry knew it, Draco was straddling him, kissing him with great fervor, occasionally sucking or nipping at Harry’s lips.
“You can fall asleep like this,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t mind. Draco?”
Draco was desperate to stop him. He looked around wildly, and seeing nothing but the snow, brought his gloved hands to it, forming a large, slightly mushy snowball with a mixture of old and fresh snow. Before he could register what he was doing, he had thrown it at the back of Harry’s head.
Draco mumbled something incoherent.
Harry gestured at all of Dragana in a slightly clumsy fashion and she couldn’t help but let out a laugh and emotional sniffle.
Harry heaved a sigh. “Fine. But Draco, don’t be a prat.”
“It is. I got it from my dad.”
“Of course, Master.” The Elf grumbled a little under his breath as they made their way downstairs and to the front door, but Harry knew it was just an act.  Kreacher had perfected it over the years, and would have berated Harry strongly if he hadn’t have called on him to help check the wards.
“DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY IF YOU DON’T OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT THIS SECOND, I’M GOING STRAIGHT TO PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL!”
Harry took a picture and the photo printed out automatically. He took a few more pictures from different angles, admiring his beautiful work of art. His Draco.
thing. But don’t you
“I wish I could,” Malfoy said, “but I’m just a lowly detective with barely a scrap of evidence.” Malfoy turned back to Harry, gently resting his gaze upon him once again. “Perhaps if I had a partner.”
“You’re keeping an open mind?”
“Yeah. I’m good.”
“Anyway, the portraits seem to be a major clue here. In the last couple weeks, I’ve seen dozens of portraits change.”
Draco’s life was brilliant. His love for himself was so much purer than it had been in his school-age years and even in the year after the war. Now, he was bursting with love and ready to give some of it to someone else…and he was sure he knew who that someone else was, as he looked at Harry’s bouncy, wild black hair and lightning bolt scar making their way towards him across the ice. He was an angel. Draco laughed at the cheesy thought—but it was true. Harry smiled when he saw Draco laughing and the two finally reached each other, approximately two feet of ice still between them. Draco had walked onto the rink in his trainers, he’d been drawn in as if by some magnetic force surrounding the other man. When he met Harry’s eye, the former Gryffindor raised his eyebrows. “You are fucking high, right now, aren’t you?” he asked, amusement colouring his words.
Dragana shook her head in disbelief at the situation—then realized what she was doing in response to Harry’s proposal and stopped mid-shake. “I can’t believe you fucking did this.
“So ahead of her time,” Draco said. “I’ve never seen such progressive opinions in any wixen history book. I’m not surprised her ideas were rejected by the other founders.”
“You’re absolutely beautiful,” Harry said when Dragana had completed her twirl, arms still outstretched.
Harry nodded and Draco said, “Yes, Professor.”
Under the table, Draco placed his hand on Harry’s leg and every nerve in Harry’s body fixated on the sensation. He knew no one else could see the gesture. What was Draco doing? Harry forced himself to look at Draco, and the sympathy emitting from the other man warmed Harry from the inside out.
Before either of them could say another word, Kreacher arrived with the tea.
They’re also...changing.”
Harry was starting to feel more uncomfortable the more Draco explained. “I’m really sorry I opened it early. I fucked up.”
Harry’s eyes widened, obviously shocked at hearing such a word come out of his mouth. He’d always used words such as “lovely” but never in his presence.
His lover lightly squeezed his hand and Harry took the opportunity to glance down at their intertwined fingers. For a brief second, he blissfully noticed he couldn’t tell which were his and which were Draco’s. And he knew. He knew he’d found his family at last.
it’s explained that the magic holding the school and its daily goings-on together is tremendously powerful and permanent, inflexible even.”
“And maybe,” Harry continued, “the rest of the founders should have listened to Ravenclaw. Things would be so different. Probably for the better.”
, I was getting to that. They make an excellent point about the importance of change.”
“Um…” Harry thought about what he could say. He landed on the truth.  “Okay,” Harry sighed. “You caught me. I…was having a peek at the presents. I was going to seal them back up later.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That sounds perfect.”
“Yes,” Harry breathed.
“Go ahead,” Draco said, and folded his hands in his lap, looking at her attentively.
Ted really wants a Firebolt 360 for Christmas. So much so, he’s convinced his five-year-old brother Scorpius to sneak downstairs with him under the guise of trying to catch a peek of Father Christmas with their presents…
“I just… don’t want you out of me. Just yet.”

“Go on,” Harry said, “I have a gut feeling about this.”
Draco grinned. “And I love you, Harry Potter. All the way to the moon… and back again.”
Their own boys were now eight years old and had been casting the spell with the support of their dads for the past two years now, but they were optimistic they’d be able to hold their own power this year.
Harry finally looked back from the ring and met Draco’s eyes, which were unmistakably starting to glisten. Seeing this, Harry felt himself choke up, and swallowed hard as his gaze fell back to the beautiful engagement ring.
Draco sighed and folded his arms across his chest. “I will. It’s just… I’m worried you won’t believe me.”
“What have you been up to?” Draco chastised, and Harry heard a hint of disappointment in his lover’s voice.
Hermione nodded, then looked to be considering something. Finally, she held out her hand to Malfoy. “Draco, I accept your apology.”
here, can’t you see?”
“Please… will you… suck me?”
“Where are we going?” Harry grumbled. Draco had invited him on a date—however, when he’d said Saturday morning, Harry didn’t think he'd meant at
“Are you serious?!” Harry was so startled he jerked the broom and the two of them had to hold on tight so as not to fall off.
Draco sighed happily and the two sunk deeper into the couch. They definitely had no plans to get up any time soon.
The amount of betrayal and anger...it affects her mental health and her control of her own magic. This story was just begging for me to tell it, so I hope people will forgive me that, athough this is for my Drarry Drabble collection, this one is all about GINNY.
Draco quirked an eyebrow but did as Harry suggested. “Oh,
“I’ll say,” Narcissa, Andromeda, and Molly said in unison, causing a burst of laughter to ripple across the table. Grimmauld Place had definitely gone through a massive transformation in the months since Dragana had moved in.
“Tell me anything.
Day 16 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! I'm so sorry to have left you with such a cliffhanger, but today was my first rough day while writing as I go through some personal things. Don't worry, I can promise the smut hinted at in today's chapter will come back before Christmas ;)
Draco nodded fervently. “Yes. Yes, please. Sir.”
Harry and Malfoy were sitting across from each other at a table in the middle of the Room of Requirement. It had transformed into a comfortable meeting room of sorts. The two Eighth Years were seated at a long oak table that could easily have seated another ten people. The fire was burning and the warmth in the room stood in stark contrast to the harsh autumn wind blowing outside.
“Okay.” Draco said simply. He paused, and then said it again. “Okay.” He opened his chest and held his arms out in a receiving pose. “Do you want to come in?” Harry nodded and buried his face against Draco’s chest and hugged him close.
“Of course, my sweet prince.” Harry banished the lights and Draco stretched, testing his freedom after being restrained. Harry made sure to kiss all the spots that looked particularly red and irritated from the unorthodox binding.
“A…wish?”
“I care about you. So deeply.”
, Harry,
“We have come to a very special moment of our evening together,” Harry commenced. “I am very pleased you have all chosen to celebrate Christmas with me, with us.” He placed a hand on Dragana’s shoulder, and she lifted her own hand on top of his, giving it a tender squeeze. “As you all know, this is our first Christmas party at Grimmauld Place.”
the portrait gallery, Potter. I was looking for clues.”
Harry rearranged to straddle himself over Draco’s bottom half, briefly making contact through his clothes with Draco’s ever-growing bulge under his briefs. His lover jumped at the unexpected touch, but Harry let himself splay his hands across the gorgeous chest in front of him.
Harry bit his lip, flushing. “I wouldn’t count your Snitches, my little prince…” His voice was soft and Dragana had to lean in to hear him properly.
Ron looked aghast. “You want to talk to
Harry turned to the first page of full text and read aloud: “‘This journal belongs to Rowena Ravenclaw, one of four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Inside this journal I shall document the process of establishing the first great school for all magical folk living in Britannia, Caledonia, and Hibernia. It is my hope that one day this journal will be found and the true story behind this glorious Wizarding historical event can be revealed.’”
Finally, Draco whispered, “Could you please get these off me, love? They’re starting to dig in uncomfortable places, and I need to rest.”
After a few moments, as their heartbeats started to return to normal, Harry said, “Fuck. Draco… that was…” He trailed off, unable to come up with a suitable word.
“Not without me, you’re not.”
“So good.”
“I won’t ever get this right, will I?”
Harry celebrates his new accomplishment with his loved ones--including the one person whose inspired him the most. In fact, this achievement is mutually theirs, and theirs alone--not just some fate that was thrust upon them. He and this person have had vastly different but shockingly similar journeys and they are both about to reap the benefits of their hard work.
When McGonagall was done reading, she lowered the journal back to the desk and let out a long exhale. She instantly noticed the two of them holding hands and her lips curled in a small smile. “Looks like Ravenclaw was a powerful Seer.”
“I say…bring it on.
Indeed, a couple of seconds later, the fire turned emerald green and signaled Harry’s return.
(Two images of a femme white person with brown hair past their shoulders wearing a tiara and a silver necklace. They are modeling a royal blue gown. For a complete description, please read the story!)
Malfoy shivered.
“I just couldn’t bear it.” This time Harry fell to the floor next to her and squeezed her hand tightly. But he also buried his face in his other arm, hiding his face from her. Ginny sensed the dark shadows of shame and disgrace radiating off Harry, mixed with his own spiraling magic, reaching into every inch of that dreary, old, decrepit room.
“Why would a frozen portrait cause you to bolt to the Dungeons?”
“Well, then...” Harry said. “I suppose you two would probably like to know what the hell’s going on.”
Harry smirked. “Shut it, Malfoy and listen to me.”
“Well, Salazar Slytherin has also vanished, for one. But it’s not just that portraits are going
“No, it’s okay. It’s good I told you. That I... talked about it a little bit.” Harry shivered and tried to snap himself back to the present. “Anyway, the reason I brought it up was simply because—obviously, I had to destroy those objects. I wish we could find this journal, too… but actually
“Daddy!” Scorpius admonished him, and Draco raised his eyebrows at his son. “Papa, Harry can’t help it that his voice is so bad. But he sings from the heart— and that’s what’s important!”
“Yes! You only get one extra special wish with the extra special magic of the First Snowfall and I don’t want to waste it on the wrong thing!”
think,” Susan replied, “but now I
Draco’s eyes softened. He swallowed. His lips curled into the smallest of smiles and he sighed softly.
The rest of the guests laughed at the frivolity of the young wixen.
Harry’s mouth dropped open. “B-b-but it was
Harry stepped away from his lover’s body, quite aware that this would disorient him and sneakily put his lips to Draco’s ears. “You’re absolutely gorgeous.”
Draco’s lips curled in a smile. “No problem, my love. I’m glad you spoke up and stopped me.”
Ron narrowed his eyes. “Talking?”
It’s the beginning of December, and Harry’s sneaked downstairs to peek at the presents. When Draco catches him, he reveals to Harry a most unexpected Christmas gift.
“What does it say?” Harry said, reaching for the book. Draco allowed Harry to hold one end and read aloud, “‘I had another dream. I know it to be prophetic, just as I was certain my dream with the warthog would lead to us building Hogwarts on this very spot. I have had another glimpse into the future, this time hundreds of years from now. It’s difficult for me to reconcile.  I am almost afraid to write this, as if doing so will ensure the prophecy comes true.
He was finally happy. He’d started smoking marijuana around 9 months ago, and since then he was able to get out of his depression slump, and tackle the things that had been terrifying him for the past two years. Things like finally following his dream of becoming a Potions Master. He was in his first year of an accelerated two-year program, thanks to the expertise lent to him in private lessons with Severus Snape.

“I can hardly believe this is happening,” Draco confessed.
were illuminated by the firelight.
“That would be quite strange indeed,” Malfoy said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. “But then again, Slytherin went and put in the Chamber of Secrets without anyone’s knowledge.”
“It’s…the young Malfoy boy.”
When he finally calmed down a little and settled into his improvised seat in the snow, he realized how still the evening was. The silence was broken only by the melody of a single bird. He tilted his head up and noticed the glistening branches of a tree hanging above and around him. They were frozen, the frost seemingly having caught them by surprise. The deadheads were locked in icy cages. The sight was breath-taking, but Draco couldn’t help but wonder if the tree found the sensation unnerving or not.
Harry groaned in frustration. “Just answer the question!”
As their group approached the Grand Staircase where the Eighth Years would separate from Luna, the Ravenclaw said goodbye to all of them. Then, she reached a hand out to Susan’s cheek and gave her a soft peck on the lips.
Draco’s eyes widened. “Harry…you’re not serious?”
“You’re beautiful,” Draco repeated. “It’s true. I saw you here, at the market—we were moving from place to place,
“No,” Draco admitted, “But I remember my birthday this past June…”
“You’re lost. Where did you go?” Draco reached out a hand and stroked his lover’s face, encouraging Harry to look him in the eyes whenever he was ready. Finally, Harry did look up and, feeling as if Draco’s eyes were holding him in a tender and safe embrace, told him all about how he'd been triggered as they’d passed the jumper kiosk, his hatred of capitalism, the pangs of grief still washing over him all these years later, the PTSD of his childhood, and the war.
my dear Potter.”
“What does? No, it doesn’t.”
“Damn right, it does,” Draco said, smirking. “I’m going to start moving now,” he warned.
“Merlin, help me,” Harry muttered. “Yes, I do.”
reverberating off the stone walls and making Malfoy jump. “Oh, for fuck’s sake, Malfoy! Wasn’t it obvious I didn’t want the attention? I never wanted to do any of that bullshit.”
, Potter,” Malfoy chided.  “Set an example, won’t you?”
They enjoyed a moment of stillness of Midnight, connecting with the Elements around them, and released their New Moon intentions into the darkness.
bathroom getting ready for our Christmas party.” He continued checking himself out in the mirror, ensuring his hair was still in place from the new potion he was trying out.
“May I help you, Mr. Potter?” A kindly elderly wix was blinking at him from behind large spectacles, bedazzled with different colored crystals: blue and silver.
Draco swallowed. “You’re beautiful.”
Ravenclaw biography!” The book zipped out of Harry’s school bag, across the room, and into his outstretched hand.
“Okay,” Harry admitted, his cheeks flushing. “It’s just that... I haven’t... you know.”
“You’re right, but honestly… I can’t believe that wixen aren’t researching that and developing technology-friendly enchantments yet!” Hermione said, throwing her hands in the air in exasperation.
landing arse-first in my mother’s favorite rose bush, and yowling so loudly, Hildegarde, the house elf, couldn’t help but notice you. Our song is your magnificent yelp as thorns scraped your skin, and how horrified poor Hildegarde looked as Monsieur Rudolph’s nose bobbed right out and tapped her own nose as she came to your aid. Our song is my riotous laughter tumbling down from the balcony as you scowled and harrumphed away, only to return the very next night. ”
