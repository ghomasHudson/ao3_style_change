"If you did, if you really were ever serious about things, you wouldn't have—" Potter presses his lips into a thin line. "Never mind," he finishes, turning towards the door.
He doesn't quite get that. What he does get is Potter coming back a third time and a fourth, and then again and again until Draco finally loses count. Draco tells himself that's good—it
“Are you—” said Malfoy, and then, lowering his voice til it was barely above a whisper, “—on something?”
place—slowly spinning a lowball glass between his forefinger and thumb. He'd thought Potter looked great before, but now he's stunning—the way his tousled hair draws attention to his face, how even the light frown line between his eyebrows makes Draco want nothing more than to smooth it over . . .
"I see," his mother says moments later. "Perhaps you ought to come visit," she adds softly, "the town looks lovely this time of year."
“Mercy takes no skill, mercy takes no will,” Draco mutters the mantra to himself, willing himself to stay calm, busying himself with his tea. “Have mercy on her and leave her be…” Does he really have to listen to her hogwash gibberish everyday? Because his mind keeps saying,
“There were—” Potter pauses “—signs,” and his voice sounds quite odd, quite unfitting. Like he’s actually
Then Potter brushes the hair out of Draco’s forehead, like he needs to know something, quite frantically. Draco knows not what it is, but it seems to be there, in his eyes, so he smiles a little smile and pushes Potter off him. Then, he bends his head and gives the tip of Potter’s prick a tiny lick, just enough to prove his point. When he looks up to see Potter’s face, his eyes are shut.
Pansy did ask him how it had gone after the first time, but Draco had simply shrugged, unwilling to give too much away. He guesses she must have thought it went wrong. Draco, on the other hand, thinks it went all too well.
It’s seven in the morning and Draco feels thwarted and ruined, like he’s been stumbling around without sleep for weeks, worrying over things that can’t be solved. It almost makes him laugh because… well, because he
Much to his dismay, Hermione does take to dragging him out for a pint every Friday evening, and the Weasel trails behind her, dragging along a very disgruntled-looking Harry. Harry looks downright mouthwatering in his torn jeans and green Converse trainers, and Draco's heart stops beating in his chest.
Draco can’t even contemplate telling Potter the biggest lie of all. He once told him, it’s not forgotten; Potter just doesn’t know it’s actually him, the lad who lost it in the loo. The thought nearly makes him giggle, though it shouldn’t since it was no fun at all.
Today is one of those days. The light coming in through the curtains registers before the brief confusion turns into panic, into shame, sometimes into shame of panicking over memories past long gone, and things he can’t remember anymore. Neither of those emotions is too flattering to go through. But he does know this bedroom. He’s been here before, with Mother.
For a moment there, Potter looks almost as if he'd been hexed, and Draco can't bear the injured look in his eyes, he can't bear being the one who's put it there. He can't bear how much he wants to apologise, as if all of this were his fault, how much he wants to . . . he's not even sure what he wants anymore and he
, which is kind of priceless because he really, really isn’t. His first time was two years ago, and he doesn’t even like to think about how it went, so go figure…
here, Potter is. “You’re no longer pregnant. I have one of those bottles you used to like.” The issue here is Potter is asking for things neither of them wants. Things Draco doesn’t even
Harry stays put for a while, glancing up at the bottle. Likely seeing nothing, Draco thinks. He’s just opened his heart here, he hopes Harry can see that much. He hopes he’s seeing the
Draco has (badly, since his magic seems to be perpetually turned off these days) healed the tiny cuts Potter’s teeth left on his skin. But he still remembers what got them there. He remembers, and he’s not likely to ever forget. “It’s fine,” he says, even as his thoughts revolve around
Harry glances between them, looking for all the world as if he’s missed something relevant here. Draco thinks perhaps he has, being a Gryffindor and all. “What does he mean?”
"Please," Harry would say softly, "For me," and something fragile would flutter in Draco's chest—something dangerous, and Draco was never a risk taker but he'd welcome it anyway.
Harry sits across from him but never looks at Draco, though he does shift uncomfortably whenever Draco talks, and eventually excuses himself to go to the loo.
“… as if it were the most common thing for a wizard, as reverently famous as he is, to have lunch at a Muggle place—”
He stares at Draco across the courtroom for a moment too long, and Draco hopes. He hands Draco back his wand with a curt, "Malfoy," and Draco nods, as if he'd been expecting this all along. As if he'd always known Harry would keep his wand for him.
Draco watches him. Watches him fill Scorpius’ feeding bottle, watches him shake it, touch one side, grimace slightly. Quite tentatively, he asks, “You know what I really, really wanted, back when I was a child?”
Sometimes though, on the rare occasion when Potter looks his way, Draco does think of hexing Potter, of punching his nose in until it breaks all over again—and yet, he never does. But every time, he feels his trousers get a bit too tight below the hips, and he has to excuse himself to pay a visit to the loo.
"Fuck off," Draco said, but he was smiling. As soon as Potter looked away, he slid his foot a couple of inches to the right—just a couple of inches, just until it was barely brushing against Potter's.
too. Dismally enough, the paper comes time after time with his whimpers, and their accusative matching head shake. Potter’s whines seem to oscillate between “I honestly can’t believe I’m doing this,” and “Seriously…” Draco finds the first one side-splitting, especially since Potter seems to be purposely evading the ‘for you’ that often ends that sentence. Once, Potter even goes as far as to venture an, “I don’t even get what grabs your interest, when all they publish is crap.”
about paying attention. They've been working together for two years, and Harry has never once talked to Draco and how,
"Suit yourself," she says, "but frankly, I hope this doesn't become a habit now. Not that I don't enjoy your company, but there are better times for visiting your friends than—" her eyes flicker towards the clock on the stove, "—six in the bloody morning. Sweet Salazar, are you trying to kill me?" She doesn't sound particularly angry. She sounds amused, weary, possibly a bit worried—and yes, underneath all that, perhaps a bit cross. But Draco knows she loves the gossip and he knows she's his friend, which basically means he knows he'll be forgiven eventually. Even though she'll make sure to bring this up as often as possible. "Not to mention leaving Potter alone in your flat probably wasn't the brightest course of—"
"Well, is this supposed to be you, then? His current—" Pansy lifts her hands, flexing her fingers to make air quotes around the word, "—girlfriend?"
"I told you to go away!" Draco yells, but when he finally looks up, Potter is standing by the door to the bathroom, looking for all the world as though his favourite hippogriff had just been
be one. One that he just can’t recall, somehow. So he opens his mouth, and lets lie after lie flow out in a way that’s almost music to his ears. “I have nowhere else to go.”
“You think?” Draco looks down at his stomach. It looks pretty much as it’s looked for a while. A bit larger than usual, but still, that’s not a good reason to call him fat to his face.
Like a filthy rat who just crawled out of a sewer, only deserving to be spit on. Stepped on. Not worthy of even a try.
Harry speaks for him at his trial. He speaks for a very long time, saying things like Draco was brave and had been under duress, that everything he did, he did for his family, that the war couldn't have been won without him.
"Fine, okay, perhaps they used to hate you. Probably," Harry admitted. "But look, it's not like they're going to hex you while I'm there. I'm still bonded to you, it'd be a bother to have to levitate you all the way back to school."
"I'm not sure that's a good idea," Draco mumbles. But still, Potter looks desperate enough that Draco winds up grabbing a roll of parchment from under the counter. He hastily writes down his address and hands it to Potter, and Potter thanks him before he leaves.
Draco's head snaps up. His muscles tense up so fast he has to let go of the cup to hide the shaking in his hands because he can almost hear the silent 'to you' at the end of that sentence—he's always been special to you, hasn't he?—and
“I…” What is she even talking about? What on Earth did he tell her, what could he possibly have said that night that would matter to him now? “No?”
(According to Potter though, they are done and gone, ever since his little adventure at the Ministry.)
"Can't, sorry. We're going to Blaise's birthday and it's invitation only," Draco replies. He can tell Pansy is still gaping at him from the kitchen, likely because he's on the Floo with his school-time enemy—who was sort of his boyfriend for a day back in eighth year, who's now back to being his enemy—and they're actually just . . . chatting. Like old friends would. "Tomorrow, maybe?"
It's been two days since since Potter sought him out at work, and Draco has been feeling kind of twitchy ever since—but all in all, he thinks he's doing a fairly good job of covering that up.
Potter ends up rolling his eyes upon Draco’s further complaints, mostly based on Potter’s lack of shopping skills, and sometimes on, “If you’re going to buy donuts, at least you could buy the ones covered in chocolate. They taste better than these ones.”
When he lets the door fall shut, the noise seems to startle Potter out of whatever trance he's been in.
Draco's brain quickly shuts down. He stares out of the window instead, letting their voices blend into one another in the background. On the charmed landscape beyond the glass, autumn is swiftly fading into winter, the snow slowly covering pile after pile of dry leaves upon the ground. The last sparks of colour are being chased away by a heavy white fog.
Across the room, the girl Weasley would pale in shock and drop the two drinks she'd been holding. Draco would glance over, and find her holding onto a table for support.
“Fine.” Potter’s look is subtle enough. Draco does catch it, though. Up and down, but not derisive. “Much better than before.”
"Fine." Pansy sighs. "But if he's the new Dark Lord, why would you be asking about him anyway?" she asks, and Draco glares at her.
"My back aches horribly in the evenings, I should probably—" he gestures weakly towards his bedroom, "—go lie down for a while."
"I do take my work seriously," Draco says. His voice comes out strained, but at least he's managed to keep the 'you irksome little prat' he'd been planning to add near the end a silent one. He figures he ought to congratulate himself for that.
He has to go find Harry now. He's supposed to talk to him, brief him about this case he knows nothing about because he was too caught up in his own panicked ruminations to even
"I still don't think it's a—" Draco started, but Harry was faster, "Please?" he begged, gazing up at Draco with wide eyes. "Please, I haven't been able to go to Hogsmeade with them for months now, it'd be nice to—"
himself than go crawling back to Potter. Even though he really, really wants to. It’s not like he can do that though: there’s still a child to take care of, a child who won’t even let him rest his eyes for a mere second.
That’s pretty much how the whole date goes, with Miller calling him unpleasant things, and treating him like he’s rubbish taken out of someone else’s can, and it keeps going like that until Miller tries to tie him to the bed. “I’m sorry,” Draco says. “I don’t do that.”
In all honesty, Draco thinks he'd like to stay there. It's a more challenging job than the one he had at St Mungo's, and he doesn't have to deal with Potter there.
“Hello to you too,” Draco says, under his breath. He’s a bit annoyed, mostly at himself: annoyed because Pans is not like his johns, annoyed that his first thought upon arriving was
“A bit on the prejudiced side of the fence, isn’t he?” Draco tells Harry one day. Mostly because he’s heard those two last terms used before, usually on him, and he can’t say they came from someone who approved of queerness per se. Or of him. Or of what his job used to be.
be, because he's sick and tired of always making the wrong choices when it comes to Potter, because he still wants Potter more than he's ever wanted any other man.
“Oh.” Yes, well, there’s that. That, and that none of his toiletries smell quite as feminine as Pansy’s, and largely that he should have seen that coming. “Are you…”
"I never really got to see a film in the cinema. My Muggle relatives, they didn't like the idea of magic. They rarely took me anywhere, and I did—I did watch a few films on the telly, but that's it."
"No, of course not. You're my only son, I'm glad you decided to visit." Narcissa's eyes hold his gaze. "I just worry about you. I worry that you're running away."
Draco spends his first two weeks there feeding them, but when the snow comes and mornings get chillier he takes to the tower. It's a nice place to think, he finds, small enough that his warming charms will hold. He can see the whole town of San Gimignano from up there, and it's really quite beautiful.
“Who’d have thought! Harry Potter, the master of lies.” But Draco isn’t thinking that, not then. In fact, his thinking mostly includes that perhaps he should do that thing with his foot, and why not? Tiny movement, likely huge progress.
“Yes.” Yes. Yes, above everything. He wants his tiny, tiny human seeing the light of day. No one can do anything to stop that.
“You don’t get it, do you?” He pushes at Potter’s chest, hard enough that Potter stumbles backwards a few steps. “You don’t trust me now. You have never trusted me. You didn’t even trust me back on sixth year, when you had me fucking Obliviated.”
“They call that the opening scene, you see. It’s the beginning of your tale, that then moves on to the...” Hermione’s hands were moving all over the place, and then something rather odd happened. Harry’s not quite sure what went wrong there. Perhaps he moved too fast, perhaps he moved too slow, but somehow when he tried to pick up his coffee, he ended up waving his arm in the air and going, “Ow!” because for some bizarre reason his Macchiato had spilled all over his hand and —“Bloody hell...”
"Hello, Malfoy," he mumbles, reaching up one hand to slip along the white cotton of his scruffy shirt's neck. Draco's breath hitches in his throat as his gaze follows the movement—he remembers mapping out the skin there with his tongue, with his
Draco, raising his brows, has to concede that much. It’s definitely crap, since Potter’s all they ever notice, but instead of agreeing with him, he reads aloud
Pansy handles the logistics of their enterprise, managing their bookings and calls while Draco… well, Draco mostly brews tea, occasionally makes Pans coffee in the morning, and plays
However, he still hasn’t gone beyond touching Potter. He’s not sure if it’s out of respect—which, apparently, he now has, developed at some mysterious point he can’t quite place in time. Or perhaps… perhaps out of shame. Shame of himself. Potter doesn’t know what he is, what he’s done, how many men have had him. He treats him like he’s some poor abused little flower.
He’s been introduced as Harry’s date. Few things, he thinks, can even compare to that. He’s now the freaking hero’s boyfriend; swallow
she'd know that. He's the careless idiot who got drunk and told her Potter's abs looked like something out of a magazine in the Cannon's new calendar last year—so tight, so bloody
Hermione is mumbling something under her breath, something that makes Draco pause and ask, “What did you just say?”
? He’s useless and he knows it, he knows it now better than anytime before. He swears that to himself over a hundred times: promises and promises and promises, until the liquor puts him to sleep.
True to her word, Hermione did open the door. At least a tiny little bit. One sleepy eye blinked at him several times from behind the small chain attached to the door frame. “You,” she said. “Again. Jesus, Harry, it’s past midnight...”
“God, yes.” Apparently it was the right response, another point for him in the Get to Know Your Muggle Workmates game. “I called to have it repaired, but the blokes came almost an hour late… flipping disgrace, I tell you. I keep hoping today is over. Tomorrow can’t be this bad, can it?” Then, she asks, “And you? Going home already?”
? Surely ten interesting things happened there before morning tea. Harry snapped on one glove. “Well...no.”
“Absolutely. We’d have every pureblood in the British Isles with a thoroughbred Granian calling for your head.” Draco took an experimental sip of tea, and found it, as promised, exactly the perfect temperature. “I don’t want to think about this anymore. It’s almost five o’clock.”
Harry tightened his hands around Draco’s hips, and rolled them both over once again. Draco parted his legs around Harry immediately, and Harry wordlessly - and wandlessly, of course, both his hands and mouth being currently occupied - Banished his little black underpants to the bathroom hamper.
“Oh, Christ alive, it’s Harry Potter,” Verity’s eyes were wide with shock. “And Auror Malfoy, oh my days. I’m in such trouble now!”
Harry pointed his fork at Ron, and a bean bounced across the table, coming to rest against the pepper pot. “You were busy brooding over Hermione, and snogging bloody Lav Brown!”
Unsurprisingly, Potter’s mouth was warm and tasted strongly of tea. Draco had given up all pretense of resistance as soon as Potter’s mouth had pressed to his, and he no longer cared what Potter might think as he took a fistful of Potter’s robes and pulled him closer. For his part, Potter certainly didn’t seem to have a problem with the idea; he slid directly onto Draco’s lap, his legs splayed on either side of Draco’s thighs, and the chair creaked as Potter proceeded to press Draco into the leather with his lips, his tongue, and most of his body. Months of repressed yearning to touch, to grab, surged upward from Draco’s very toes, and he found himself with handfuls of Potter, a bit of thigh in his left hand and a handful of bicep in his right, and Potter had his fingers in Draco’s hair and on his neck, and his lips on his throat, and his teeth as well, and before he really knew it Draco was pushing Potter backward off the chair and onto the office floor.
Harry realised his mouth was open only when he went to speak. “Erm, yeah, of course. ‘Course you can. There’s loads of space,”
Draco wasn’t wearing any. He’d been in a bit of a rush, and hadn’t planned to stick around long. “Wouldn't you like to know.” Cashmere underpants, honestly. He set down his cup on the conference table. “Right, how do you want to do this?”
The pad and pen from the kitchen slapped into Draco’s palm a moment later. “Starting a new list.” Harry grinned. Of course he was. “Now, obviously this affects a lot of the rooms, correct?”
“The person who last took a shit goes next,” Harry said. “And before you ask, no, it’s not honesty based - there’s a spell.”
“There he is,” Malfoy said, inexplicably smiling. “Welcome back, Potter. So, if I may sum up; you understand that even exceptionally talented people aren’t brilliant at everything, and it doesn’t make them any less talented. You understand that sexuality is not black and white, and that needs, and relationships, change over time. You accept your friends without judgement and are evidently willing to defend them at the slightest provocation. And yet, you hold
“Am I him?” Malfoy asks, dazed. His eyes look hazy and dark, and his mouth is blood red from Harry’s stubble, and teeth, and the sucking kisses he can hardly stop pressing to them.
the lab, because he wasn't sure quite how he could adequately explain to an unexpected visitor that this was not what it looked like. And what it looked like, Harry imagined, was one extremely composed blond wizard radiating pure sex, and one damp and red-faced idiot with a raging erection and a handful of the most frightening rubber dildo known to man.
can in fact do this, but you can’t tell me how.” Potter opened his mouth, but Draco waved him off. “Nevermind, Potter. Let’s just get this done.” He looped an arm through Potter’s and ignored the smell of chocolate. “If you Splinch me, I’ll have your balls. If you damage my coat, I’ll kill you. Understood?”
Malfoy had the good grace to at least look visibly surprised this time. “Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office – what official business would bring you to my establishment, Potter?”
He thought about how Malfoy had looked tonight. The way his perfectly tailored trousers had been cut around his hips and thighs, and arse. Harry was the last person to care about clothes, to know anything about them, but he knew Malfoy looked incredible in his tonight. His hair glowing fuschia in the neon light in the street.
Harry didn’t expect the other man’s easy smile. “That’s okay. It’s nice to look, sometimes. I noticed you looking.” Orange Singlet Paul cocked his head to one side. “Nice thighs and fingers, wasn’t it?”
“Lift up, sweetheart,” Draco’s breath stuttered, and he tilted his hips enough for Harry to slip his hands under his thighs, and pull him onto his lap. Cufflinks, tie, the final button at his throat. Harry pressed hot kisses along his neck while pulling the shirt from Draco’s shoulders. The scars on his chest were razor thin and sensitive, and Harry traced them by memory, and mouthed Draco’s shoulder.
“They’re too small to be carrying such large parcels!” The words burst forth along with a few fat tears. “You should see how their little bodies suffer! It’s cruel, magic-folk are horrible to creatures and the owls included. I was just trying to rescue the smallest ones, I promise. I didn’t mean to do treason or anything — I promise!” Verity was howling properly now, and Potter put his arm around her reassuringly, pressing a crisp handkerchief into her hands.
“Draco. You’re looking delectable as always.” Clementine grinned back at Malfoy, and then cocked her head at Harry. “And this is…?”
His outfit was laid out on the valet in the bathroom (tick), his luggage was packed and assembled neatly by the front door (tick), and an elf service booked for a spring clean while he was away. The perfect schedule, revised a dozen or more times over the past several months as he counted down the days to this much-needed break.
“How dare you,” Draco said, finally finding his voice, and he found Potter’s fingers with his own and wound them together.
“Of course,” Malfoy said, walking smoothly towards the bar. “Trust me, Potter. Try to suspend your disbelief and let yourself trust that I’m here to look after you tonight.”
The last time he’d fucked Potter, he hadn’t known that it was. That it would be. If he had, maybe he would have done things differently, taken more time.
“Barely. Her name was Tiina. And that bathroom was almost more traumatising than the cheese.” Draco looked at him, his face pink and soft. “That was so early. We’d only been seeing each other a little while.” Draco’s mouth turned down. “And you saw every undignified moment through those fucking bathroom walls,
. Harry did his best to imbue his glare with actual murder, but Ron remained frustratingly alive, and smug as fuck.
The last person he expected to see in this place was Granger. It was about as out of the way as a bar could be, while still being able to claim it was in wizarding London. Draco would never have said the grubby ambience of the Old Mallard was really her scene either, but this place was definitely not one he expected to see any of his colleagues at, unless it was the last place to buy a pint in England. Even then.
“What do you mean, ‘no’?” Harry threw up both hands, and nearly poked Ron in the eye with his wand as a consequence. Ron shouldn’t be standing so close behind him, if he wanted to avoid losing an eye to a rogue wand.
Draco shrugs. He’s not even sure what Guinness is—not to worry, he’ll search it once Potter’s gone—but it reminds him he needs to be the one in power here. Control. He doesn’t want Potter subjugated exactly, just at his mercy, so he tries, “I like Italian sparkling wine. Lambrusco tastes quite well.”
“Thank you for, you know…” Draco pauses, gesturing towards his face, which is now healing but was once broken. He doesn’t want to say
"No, I don't suppose he would, the great Gryffindor prat." She pauses, tapping her fingers against the side of the table before muttering under her breath, "But then again, perhaps he doesn't need to."
Some mornings, when Draco first wakes up, it takes him a moment or two to remember where he is. To remember his war days are over, that the present is something else that sometimes doesn’t hurt as much, though mostly it does. That there’s something missing, but he doesn’t know
Draco draws back, hands still tangled in Potter’s soft—and of course utterly messy—hair. He looks into his eyes. “Do you sometimes feel like all this happened before,” he asks Potter, wondering, “at some point?” Potter’s lips are red and swollen and he wants nothing more than to kiss them again, but he needs to know. He needs to know if perhaps he’s not the only one to feel this, to feel like a large part of him has been torn out and left missing. “Like we’ve been together on a different life and now it’s all, I don’t know… forgotten, somehow.”
“I have to say, I’m quite impressed,” Draco says, once he’s done reading yet another Potter-based article on the
"I really am, aren't I?" Draco hesitantly puts his hand on Harry's head. He cards his fingers through Harry's hair, and it's impossibly soft against his skin. Much, much softer than it looks, and Draco really must be off his face on painkiller potions for any of this to seem even remotely normal. "But I still like you a lot."
, Draco thinks, let him complain all he wants. He catches himself hoping, a bit maliciously, Potter chokes on his complaints the same way Draco choked on apologies and sorries for months on end, no one else beside him but Pansy. See, at least Potter is lucky in that too: he has more than one friend standing by him.
"Merlin, just—just shut up. It's not like it's my first time, for fuck's—" Draco starts, but Potter leans forward and kisses him, swallowing the rest of his words—and it's sweet, it's oddly sweet, not at all like Potter's kisses back at work. It's soft and tender and quite possibly driving Draco insane, and it's only made much better by the feeling of Potter's hard length finally—
"Piss off, Potter," Draco rasps, pressing his forehead against the cold surface of the toilet. Seriously, of all the inconvenient times to drop by—it's almost as if Potter needed to see him at his most humiliating moments.
“I wanted, you know, friends. People who admired me for what I’d done, not because their parents’ told them to. I just wanted… I don’t know, a normal life, kind of.” He doesn’t say,
"Really? And I suppose you would have told me then what you went to all this trouble to keep from me?"
Across from him, Pansy hides a yawn behind her wrist. "More tea?" she asks, tilting her head towards the teapot.
He was up pretty early, Scorpius woke him up crying at four. It’s rather nice he gets to go home soon this week, though he still has to stop by Potter’s place. On the way to Morden South station, he smiles at the old man who sells papers near the coffee shop. Then, he waves at Salma, his replacement from six forwards. “Naomi is going to bite your head off,” he shouts at her, over the wind, over the children playing at the park. “She’s been complaining for a while that you weren’t there yet.”
Draco shrugs. "It's not as if you want to be a Mind-Healer though. Technically, you just need to pass."
Potter doesn’t need to see him down on the dust, just as he doesn’t need to know how messed up Draco’s life is right now. So, no. The plan can jump out the window for all he cares, for he’s not going to stick to it. He’ll go as an escort, a random escort picked out of the gigantic pile of potions they keep in the entry cupboard—remodeled by he himself; not that he’s taking credit for it, but he did manage to make the inside rather huge. He figures he’ll pick one out of the largest assortment in there and hope for the best, because the longer he can keep Potter using Polyjuice, the better. That is, if Polyjuice even works.
. Pansy claims they’re good, but since they’re sold illegally… They don’t even know who brewed them. For all he knows, Nott—or worse, Longbottom.
Hours later, once Potter's nose has been fixed and all the blood has been spelled clean, once Potter is finally done getting praised—over his
Draco slowly turns around. Potter is standing there, holding a beer in his hand, and even after all these years he still looks just as stunning as he always has in Draco's mind—a bit older, sure, but stunning all the same. Draco really, really wants to hate him for that, only he's never figured out how.
if they are, but Merlin, he wants to. He wants to curse Potter. He wants to break his stupid nose again, but somehow, he manages to calm down just enough to say, "You can't actually know that, Potter. You don't know me anymore."
Potter stares at Draco, as if he’s something new, something he wasn’t expecting, something he doesn’t even want to touch. As if he’s icky. As if he’s
His luck—or lack thereof, more likely—is stunning, as usual. These days Draco’s taken to thinking it ran out when he was eleven, when he bumped into Potter on the Hogwarts Express. It’s just easier to believe that, rather than what actually happened. Besides, the more he thought of Potter and the dreadful choice that brought him here, the more his head started to hurt, sleep evading him farther. He’d much rather stick to easy thoughts (a.k.a. blaming Potter for all his woes) mostly because it’s painless. And anyway, at least
It’s nice that Potter’s taken to sleeping here more and more often. It’s not like Draco knows what happened with his wife. He doesn’t want to ask either, he figures he’ll just make use of these moments he has with him because, sooner or later, Potter’s going to realise there’s something off with him and… and Draco doesn’t know what will happen then, but he figures it won’t be good. Rather like his luck: unreal and nonexistent.
"It just is, okay?" Draco snaps, but then he adds hesitantly, "You didn't see what he was like during our eighth year, and what he turned into after . . . you only saw bits of it, but you didn't see him in private—the way he acted around me . . ." He shakes his head. "You couldn't have known."
is the one to blame here. “… and then you spent almost half a year ignoring all my calls, all my apologies, all my fucking
“You are useless.” Useless, useless… the word reverberates, as continual agony, all while he wonders,
He cringes. Even the thought of Polyjuice makes him dizzy these days. It’s like he’s forgetting who he is, who he was,
Before she leaves though, she says, “Oh, by the way. Tell your boyfriend Lily is mine,” which kind of suggests she and Harry are not talking to each other. “I’m keeping her,” she adds, and it seems determined.
“Wait, does this mean, I mean, what you said before… Are you taking me as—” Draco swallows “—your date? To the gala?”
He's so cross, so confused, so incongruously turned on, and the next thing he knows, he's kissing Harry. It's harsh and angry and demanding, and not even close to how it was in his dreams, but still sublime, Draco thinks. Sublime.
He himself reckons Madonna isn’t exactly chaste herself either: he’s searched her pictures on Google Images and, said bluntly, her and virgin are quite hard to visualise on the same sentence. Unless the sentence reads ‘really not’. He heard her for the first time on his laptop, on some random YouTube video. Since then, he’s downloaded all her albums on this program called eMule—the one that has an odd donkey as its logo. He’s quite a huge fan. Wikipedia says that song came out when he was four, which is both comical and amazing: it took him sixteen years to find it, but now he knows he’s finally in love.
Draco’s heart thumps in his chest. He tries not to trust it too much; this could be heaven, this could also be hell. “And?”
He shrugs. “We were just kids.” Four years ago, and it seems ages. They were just kids, playing a game too big for them—with too many enemies and too many deaths involved, all things considered. It’s a shame none of them managed to see it then. “You’re now doing it for a living though.” He’s certainly seeing it now, that perhaps Weasel’s sis is not a crone from hell. He can’t help resenting her a bit—Potter was hers after all, at least by the time he came in and took him.
"You're supposed to crush them with a silver dagger," Potter says. Or, "You're supposed to wash them before you boil them," and Draco just sighs. He sighs, and kindly doesn't point out Potter is obviously getting it confused with the Sopophorous bean, and that in any case, it's not as if he's making Draught of Living Death, so it doesn't exactly matter.
Draco's fingers tighten around the flask he'd been holding. It's been months since Potter last called him by his first name, but Draco could recognise that voice with his eyes closed. He turns around, letting his professional salesman mask slide over his face.
“Potter…” Sadly the worst part of all this is that he’s rather sure Harry knows that, too. He’s just not listening hard enough. “… let go of me.”
Miller looks at him like he’s crazy, like he doesn’t see why on Earth Draco wouldn’t want to be tied up, like this is part of his job, this is what he gets paid for, isn’t it? And it’s also his job to be a tiny bit more obliging towards his clients. “Anything else you won’t do?” he enquires. “I’m assuming you do at least take it up the arse. Otherwise, I’m not sure what I paid for here.”
He takes a Portkey to Chudley in the morning, to train with his team, and then Apparates to Draco's place to shag him over the sink, like he's so bloody desperate for it he can't even wait until they make it to the bedroom. He travels to France with his girlfriend and then—yet again—to Draco's place to give him a hand job, to watch as Draco's lips tighten when he shudders and as he closes his eyes for the shaky release, spilling all over his chest and into Potter's hand. How has this become his life?
"God, I hate you," Harry breathes out, slumping down against the wall as if it were the only thing holding him up. As if the whole world were crumbling around them. "I really fucking hate you."
Potter groans. His lips move sleekly against Draco’s, his mouth parting a bit. Draco follows suit—he wants to feel the wet smoothness of Harry’s tongue touching his—parting his own lips to allow him access. Potter’s hands, previously plastered to the table, rest now on Draco’s hips, a light touch that grows more and more firm as the kiss goes on. Draco’s hands travel up from Potter’s shoulders, into his hair. He’s quite pleased with Potter’s response, moaning his approval into his mouth.
There’s a glimpse of Potter’s mouth turning upwards before he leaves, and that’s good enough for now.
“The ghosts?” she asked, and at Harry’s nod she said, “Yes, all right,” followed by an extremely long sigh. She closed the door, and after that Harry heard some rambling inside, metal on metal and who knows what else. The door opened again, only this time it opened fully. “Sooo... um,” Hermione began, “would you like some...”
It's right then that Draco decides it might be best to ignore Potter for the rest of his time here, to stop looking his way whenever he's near. Of course, he fails miserably not even ten minutes after reaching that resolution—but none of that keeps him from noticing how Potter has definitely stopped looking back. For now, at least.
Wright. Yes. Potion labeled three, and through the fog that is his mind, he mumbles, “Tell him I’ll go.”
Of course, Draco had known Potter worked at St Mungo's back when he first applied, he just hadn't expected him to
He watches through wide, incredulous eyes as the head of Harry's cock disappears rhythmically beneath his fingers. He catches the glint of the first drops of precome, wipes at them with his thumb.
Having made it to the Ministry and back, still in one piece in spite of all the insults thrown his way, Draco leaned back against the door for some reassurance, for some calm. Closing his eyes, he took a few deep breaths, the way Mother always told him to when he was stressed. “It’s really not a password Pans.” One, two… come on, relax already, boy. It’s not like any of them can get you here. “It doesn’t even
It changes nothing, though somehow it changes everything. When he leaves Scorpius there the next time he does, Potter doesn’t even try to touch him. He doesn’t even try to kiss him. He’s being too nice, too polite, too civil. Draco is missing a bit of the other Potter he’s seen, the one who did things before talking, the one who tried to kiss him out of the blue. He’s kind of wishing it would happen again. Alas, his luck is still missing.
At least he knows he’s kept his side of the promise he made himself, months ago. He’s kept his distance from Potter, even if Potter is standing here right now, pushing his head back to stop the bleeding. Draco kept true to his word. It’s rather the world around him who can’t keep true to its own. But then again, it’s never been a mutual promise. And the world, it seems, has its own plans, regardless of how Draco feels about them.
"God, you're… Just stop doing this to me, all right?" Draco wants to laugh at the sheer amount of desperation in Harry's voice. "Just leave me the fuck alone."
Draco wakes up in his own bed, under sheets that don't smell like Harry because Harry has never been there. When he goes back to work on Monday, he gets partnered with Bones. He tries—he
“So that’s how it is in Muggle's programming. Basically, you spell something, anything, wrong,” Hermione was saying on the way back to the Ministry, “and the whole thing stops working until you find
It all worked fine at first: he made his way to the door, yanked it open and walked a couple of steps down the corridor, but it was right then, as victory was looming just out of reach, when he'd been on the verge of turning back to Potter and snidely saying, 'See? I told you I could leave,' that he felt it. A wall in front of him, a wall he couldn't actually see—transparent, but undeniably there. Hard air, impossible to penetrate.
. It’s as good a time as any to test her theories; she’s always been best out of them two, regarding what people want. In several strenuous efforts, Draco grits his teeth, swallows his jibes, and offers Weasel a cup of tea. Or a sandwich. Or anything else edible that’s at least somewhat close to him, day after day after day. By now he thinks he rather knows Weasel, and what he’s learnt is he likes food.
Potter shrugged again. "I like it. Besides, Winky keeps bringing them up here. I think . . . I think she misses Dobby."
, because he can’t believe he’s said that when he really shouldn’t have. He listens to the cars outside, the slug ringing of the tin bell Kreacher has downstairs, Potter’s slow breathing. It seems ages go by, and Potter does nothing.
Pansy stays behind after he's gone, throwing Draco worried glances until he rolls his eyes and tells her, "I'm fine, really."
“Indeed, as normal as it gets,” Draco answers. Useless left behind, no more failures in his life ever. Sometimes, he can feel the sun guiding their steps—forwards never backwards, forwards is the way to go. It’s just a shame his sun looks exactly like Potter: green as spring fields, pleased like a Quidditch winner and always, always brighter than light itself. But he can totally live with that. More than, even. Life is but a blessing, he’s been thinking lately.
You, in fact, weren’t even there when he was born.” He can’t help it: the words want out. “No, you decided to take yet another, what, month and a half? Before you even decided to
“Did you now…” He looks up. Keeps his face in a significantly unimpressed pose, though he really is quite impressed. “Where?”
”—Draco also knows nothing ever is going to feel as good as these moments, that no kiss will be as sweet as Harry’s, that no other arms can keep the chilly cold from his soul tucked away as warmly as Harry’s do—“I’m bonded to you.”
Harry first noticed his clock was off during breakfast. He was conscientiously licking a tiny droplet of strawberry jam hanging on the edge of his thumb, when he somehow noticed, for some odd reason, that there was a one where there should be a two under the ‘day’ sticker. He had to admit that was a teeny, tiny ickle bit weird — especially on a magical clock — because it wasn’t just one hour or two, but a
Draco glances up, but otherwise doesn't reply. Yes, he knows what she means, but whatever. It's not as if he's here for her entertainment.
"Look," Pansy says, "it's either that or you've fallen in love with cooking, and considering you burnt my omelette again, I have to say that doesn't seem very likely."
In his mind, his tiny self shakes his head. Mother sits down on a bench nearby, in their rather large garden. “It’s not really a curse, or at least it didn’t start out as a curse,” Mother tells him. “It’s a spell placed on every Malfoy male heir. An old time spell, it comes with your surname…”
His voice sometimes wakes up the lethargic droopy portraits on the walls of the corridor. They stretch and look down at him, with interest. “Isn’t that Narcissa’s son?” one of them whispers. “Indeed,” an old man wearing a tuxedo says, “I believe he is. What was his name?”
"Because it's just around you! He doesn't treat anyone else that way, it's just you, and I can't for the life of me figure out why he'd be such an arse to you," Pansy replies. "He forgave me for trying to turn him in to the Dark Lord, he even saved your life, for Merlin's sake! And you used to get along just fine back in eighth year, and now . . . now you can't even stand being in the same room together."
Draco looks around the dusty room. He looks at Potter, crouched by the side table next to the bed where Draco’s been sleeping for… he doesn’t even know how long. Hours? Ages? He’s not sure what to say here, he’s just considering mentioning the weather, when Potter offers, “It’s getting late.”
It's not St Mungo's he needs, it's a fucking Mind Healer. An Obliviator to remove every single memory of Potter from his brain—but he's not going to get that, is he?
But then again, the old Draco Malfoy stopped existing about six months back, after his release. Now he’s just a pretty face, utterly forgettable, because one too many hits did him in for good.
When his eyes finally find Draco's, he turns away, shaking his head furiously at whatever the girl Weasel is saying.
Draco feels torn. He wants to be left alone so he can brood, he wants to hate Potter for his carelessness—Potter, who probably doesn't even realise what he's making Draco feel, who has no idea that he'll end up hurting Draco in the end.
“I had a short break between two dates, so I went into the Albany. I was about to order a cocktail, but when I looked up though, there he was! Potter, having lunch…”
Weird to think that this is the first time he really touches Potter’s cock. Weird how much it suddenly seems to matter. He used to touch men’s pricks every single day, and it has never made him feel like he’s feeling right now, like it means
Potter looks surprised, uncertain. “I don’t see how that would be my choice. I’m not the one who’s pregnant here.” Draco feels stupid and clueless because
,” she emphasises. And, okay, that kind of explains it all, the lack of a ‘Hey, how are you?’ and definitely her ‘At last’. “You see, technically, you should have arrived there—” she leans back, checking the magical clock hanging on the kitchen wall, “—around ten minutes ago.”
Frankly, he’s not sure why, but he’s not too convinced. That smile looked a bit too sugary, didn’t it? Besides, “Your mum is daft, you often say. It’s not as if you care much what she thinks.”
"If you took things seriously—" Potter's voice cracks near the end. "If you took things seriously, you never would have broken off our bond the way you did, back in eighth year."
“I’m so flipping sane,” Harry told his mirror self. “There’s not even the slightest bit of wrong in what I’m seeing.” And then came Percy, Seamus, Zabini, Neville...
The sad thing is, she’s not too wrong in her assumption. Draco will never be over him. He knows that much, just as she does.
Miller seems satisfied enough with his answer, but remains quiet. Draco wonders, for a second, if he’s going to have to do all the work here, at least until he concludes that
Draco’s eyes itch. He has a dire feeling about all this. It’s not going to end well. It’s never going to end well.
Weasel is really not as bad as he used to think he was. He still much prefers Granger: her topics, at least, are barely interesting, so long as she’s not ranting over house-elf freedom. They all seem to be getting along fine, talk about surprises! It’s quite a pity Pans is not here. She would have loved it, given her blessed joy at these—
"And since I can perfectly remember finding out last year you'd been madly in love with Potter back at Hogwarts—which, by the way, you hid much, much better than this—I figured you must be hanging out with him."
over the Weasel. They'd still end up in different houses, and Draco's heart would clench miserably during the Sorting ceremony with the looming threat of estrangement, but it wouldn't last. Harry would still sit next to him in Potions every week, and his thigh would press warm against Draco's as he leant in closer to copy his notes.
"Really now?" Pansy raises her eyebrows. "And how's that working out for you? Because the Draco I remember from school would never have managed to remain indifferent where Potter was involved."
Eventually, the mediwizards step back. They stare at him from what looks like the borderland between startled and shocked, as if he's grown a second head while they were watching, until one of them—the tall one that looks a bit like McGonagall—clears her throat.
,” as is that one. “And no one except him. At least he let me live there, and that’s something most people weren’t willing to do.”
that and is actually glad it’s happened. Draco is rather glad too. Exhausted but glad, because love still lives in him and this moment here is the closest to perfect any time in his life has ever been—“are having a baby.”
In Draco's dreams, Hermione would drag him out for a pint at an old Muggle pub every Friday evening. As usual, the Weasel would trail behind her, dragging along a very reluctant-looking Harry. And Harry would look stunning—so spectacularly fit in his torn jeans and leather jacket that Draco's lungs would simply refuse to cooperate for a while, and he'd be left breathless.
“We haven’t.” Pansy shrugs. “He looked quite well-off, to be honest, I thought we might charge him extra. I told him you were new here so…”
In the end, Draco asks for nothing. Doesn’t even contemplate it. He has to admit that inside him, his mind is still chuckling at the mess his life is. It would be so easy to give in, yet he’s too scared to lose Potter once again, given how last time nearly destroyed him. Given that he’s still alive now mostly thanks to Scorpius, the tiny human growing in his belly all those months ago. On the outside, he just picks up Scorpius and leaves.
Draco turned around in his bed, squinting in Harry's direction. It was dark, but if he tried hard enough he could still make out the contour of Harry's face—his cheeks, his nose, the strong angle of his jaw.
Draco's hips roll with Potter's thrusts—it feels delicious, and he's pretty sure he won't last much longer—they've both had ages of weird foreplay after all, even if it didn't feel much like foreplay at the time. As Potter's cock keeps nudging Draco's prostate, Draco can feel his eyes slide closed. Potter's hand finally wraps around his cock, pulling on it firmly, and suddenly, Draco is coming all over Potter's hand.
Draco nods, of course. He’s kind, if nothing else. He tries a, “You are quite a good seeker,” which mysteriously doesn’t get him cursed.
Sometimes he wonders if it’s the world, asking him perhaps to choose, to act, to do something here, anything. His mind is all over the place. It’s all a mess. And he’s still not sure of what he’s chosen when he rages into Potter’s house and fucks him over the couch, but dear Merlin, it feels like
because it somehow makes him feel like a normal member of society again. And these days he’d give both his kidneys and a piece of his heart, to have his life return to anything remotely close to the so called ‘normalcy’ he had before.
But he also wants this. He wants Potter to make love to him gently. He wants him to stay afterwards, to cuddle through the night, to bring Draco breakfast in the morning, because apparently he's a bit of a hopeless sop when it comes to Harry bloody Potter.
And it hurts. And it’s funny Harry says that now, when they’re over, especially when he never had the guts to say it before. The closer he got was ‘I
“Of course I don’t,” he sneers. “Sixth year was ages ago!” And a rather long time to be able to remember anything at all. She’s going to have to be a bit more specific.
get there: nothing he’s done so far has pushed Potter to take the first step. Draco knows quite well how to act when it comes to sex—years of practice and whatnot—but this whole
He goes mad as a bag of ferrets. Which almost makes him laugh, considering he’d been one for a while, and it bloody
The next time he wakes up it's to Pansy shaking his shoulder like the world is ending outside, calling his name in a sort of panicked voice that has Draco reaching for his wand before he can even process the thought, before his eyes are all the way open—a leftover memory from the war, he guesses.
Potter's baby. Draco wonders if it'll have Potter's eyes, and hopes to Merlin it won't have Potter's impossible mess of dark hair—thick and wavy and quite possibly spell-resistant. Only then he starts wondering if he'll be reminded of Potter whenever he looks its way, and suddenly his eyes feel watery, and the thick clump at his throat seems far too big to swallow. So he decides to forego further speculation for the time being. He can do that later, if at all.
One night, Granger and Weasel drop by for dinner. Draco spends half the evening trying to talk to her, mostly because she seems easier to deal with than Weasel. Besides Potter wouldn’t be, say, extremely pleased, if he decided to leave the room. Or punch Weasel’s nose, like that evening.
Harry took a final swallow of water and pushed the glass back into Draco’s hands, and flourished dramatically, wandlessly drying all the mess from the bed, which included the water, the sweat, and several less savoury deposits best left unmentioned.
Hermione dug a serving spoon into the mountain of golden salad, speckled with green and pink and red bits. “What do you put in there, that makes it taste like-”
Draco swallowed, and nodded in acknowledgement. Nothing else was said on either of their parts, although Draco could feel that infernal prickling sensation which indicated Potter was watching him again, and probably wanted to say something. He sat down at his normal place at the table, then got up again remembering it was his job to set it. He moved about the kitchen, silently removing forks and side plates, and a pair of napkins, with his eyes carefully slipping over Potter to focus on just about anything else. Their silence was uncomfortable, for the first time. His fault.
“Later,” Draco seemed to remember he had hands, and groped his way to the drawstring of Harry’s joggers. They helped each other push Harry’s trousers down as best they could, considering they were unwilling, or perhaps unable, to stop kissing and touching each other, and Harry was three fingers deep in Draco throughout the whole operation. Draco was hard again as he urged, “Come on, please, I can’t wait, I need it,” and so Harry moved above him and between his thighs again, because he needed it too, couldn’t wait for it.
Ron scoffed. “You had hair. Hairiest bloke in our dorm. You were a right hairy bastard from a young age, made me feel bloody inadequate.” Harry stared at him. “What? Are you saying you never looked in the showers? Everyone looks. I bet you could pick my penis out of a line up.”
“Mmmm,” Draco closed his eyes happily, and turned the water off. “That’s going to go straight to my hips.”
“But you’re not having one with anyone else, though, are you? In fact, I can’t remember the last time you pulled, or even made an attempt.”
Harry’s briefing with Ron, Shacklebolt and Throttlebottom had been difficult to say the least – it was now Thursday, almost a full week since the cocks first appeared, and Harry was no closer to a solution. Following his visit to Malfoy’s shop on Wednesday mid-morning, Harry had sent away the details of the postbox to see who it was registered to. He wasn’t expecting an answer until at least Friday, and in the meantime wasted the rest of the afternoon searching through Ministry census records to see if there was any mention of a Fanny Ballhatchet in Cockfosters, or anywhere else in Wizarding Britain in the last hundred years. As expected, there was none.
“Yeah,” Potter stalked closer, pointing a finger in Draco’s chest, just short of actually touching him. “What does traditional mean?”
“You really do, don’t you,” Malfoy’s cheeks were slightly pink, whether due to the stuffy pub, or the beer, Harry couldn’t say, but it looked good on him. Was distracting. “Do you ever think about how strange it is sometimes?” Malfoy gestured between them. “Us, getting on. Being such a good match.”
The wards surrounding the Ministry parking garage dragged over the car before releasing it, and Harry aimed for a parking space between a sleek silver limousine, and an old fashioned Mini which was the precise colour of peanut butter. “Between stealing my breakfast and ranting about Knobgate, I nearly forgot to ask you if there was an actual reason for your visit this morning.”
Draco dug his chin into Harry’s shoulder while he looked at Narcissa and Andromeda, leaning together on the settee. “Hmm, well, she’s had two glasses, so naturally she’s sloshed.” He leaned away, and fixed Harry’s lapel. “Have you had something to eat?”
“Ow,” Harry said, a bit more awake now, and starting to get annoyed. He found his glasses and shoved them on. Malfoy’s nearly bare body came into better focus, which didn’t help Harry keep track of the conversation any better. “Who woke you up?”
. They sat in Draco’s kitchen again while Theo set the phone up and showed Draco the basics, and they put in their own numbers, and Pansy’s.
Potter had a booklet of photographs of Draco in his sweaty Quidditch kit. When they were still in school. What.
“I think I might fuck you on that fancy chair,” Harry said breathlessly, and Draco went even pinker.
Malfoy stands there, looking cross, holding a bright blue plastic bowl with Thomas the Tank on the side, and a plastic spoon shaped like a duck. Harry’s stomach does a thing, like it just fell off something high, when he sees Malfoy. It happens nearly every time, lately. Has done for months.
“Not the same thing at all,” Harry muttered to himself. So what if he didn’t really go out much? And, yes, maybe it had been a little while since he’d been on a proper date...a few months...or maybe a year. Years. It wasn’t like he didn’t have a perfectly active sex life. Well, actually, he didn’t have anything near an active sex life, unless you could characterise a cursory evening wank in the shower as either ‘active’, or a ‘sex life’. Things had just become a lot more complicated since Ginny. Meeting people who were not secretly weirdoes, fuckwits or Death Eaters was actually a lot harder than it sounded, and he’d wanted to be respectful to Gin, give her time to move on, minimise the speculation about what had caused the end to what
“It’s alright, Verity. I can’t say you’re not in a world of trouble, but I’ll make sure everyone understands you had good intentions. I’ll vouch for you,” Harry smiled at her warmly. “I’m the famous Harry Potter, so they’ll listen to me. No Tower of London for you this time.” She gave a watery chuckle, and Draco’s heart did strange things again, as did his belly, and his legs, a little. “Auror Malfoy needs to take a sample of your magic, and then we have to bring you in. Do we have your consent?”
Harry plugged the phone into the charger, and rolled over onto Draco’s side of the bed. Only two more days til he’d be home.
“‘Mione put a track-and-trace up last time she was here. Pinged its tits off when you showed up tonight.”
Harry could feel the moment Malfoy saw him; looked up from his cigarette through a curl of fuschia tinged smoke and smiled, slow and easy like this was all perfectly normal. Harry felt his breath catch and knew he was fucked, really, actually fucked.
They were going to have to improvise. Harry's eyes scanned the table, and lit upon the butterdish. His fingers scrambled over the tablecloth, reached the edge of the ceramic dish and pulled it closer. He knocked off the lid, looked at it once, and knew they'd have to throw the rest of the butter out once they were done. And then he plunged his fingers in, and coated them greasily in the thick yellow spread.
He rubbed the back of his neck and looked at Hermione, feeling a hot prickle rising up his throat. “It’s sort of embarrassing actually. If I tell you,” Harry brandished his buttery knife at Ginny and Ron in turn, glaring, “I want absolutely no smart comments. Am I clear?”
That sounded good. “Practically Nando’s,” Harry said, finding a place in the fridge for the pasta. “Have you got any perinaise?”
Potter jogged into step beside him, and Draco took care not to spare so much as a glance in his direction. “Why do you resent my presence so much?”
“Not long now,” Potter sighed into his neck, his breath hot and moist. “Gonna make a mess of you, Malfoy. I know you love it,” Potter’s fingers tightened around Draco’s, and Draco was whining now. “You love it when I come into your office and make a mess…you love the crumbs, and the bent paperclips…you love it when I stack files crookedly, you love to come along and fix it all up, don’t you?” Draco cried out, a wordless agreement. “You love it most when I make you sweat, make you drip, cover you in spit, lube, when I come on you and in you, and it drips down your skin -
That left...what? Perhaps Potter was just a little drunk and flirty. That was certainly plausible, as Potter had been making impressive progress through the open bar.
“I – Potter, there are only two things that I have, that I earned all by myself; my N.E.W.T. marks, and this job. Everything else was given to me by somebody. Obviously, I want you,” Draco felt his face heat up again. “But if things go wrong between us, I don’t think I could bear to stay, and that’s – well, that’s a lot to lose all at once.” Potter stopped him by pulling his face gently down to his own, and kissing him hard, until Draco had forgotten what they had been doing before the kiss had begun, and had just about forgotten everything else as well, including his own name. With a twist of his hips, Potter had Draco on his back, and he eased his thighs apart and settled between them before finally breaking the kiss.
“Ah. Well, my former boss was, well, a difficult personality shall we say, and I decided it might be nice to take some time off, get in touch with the inner me – you know, find myself.”
Draco tracked Scrivener’s progress across the room. By his calculation, the Undersecretary had already consumed six standard drinks so far, and had eaten almost none of the canapé’s, which was not a good sign. He was wandering rather too close to the Mermish Ambassador’s tank for Draco’s comfort, especially since he had worn a cravat of spectacularly ugly proportions this evening. The last thing Draco wanted was for the Undersecretary to fall in and cause a cross-species political incident, or drown. Actually, the drowning might be just fine by Draco, if he was perfectly fair.
Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s ear, and nipped at the lobe. “Come upstairs for a minute, and let me suck you off.”
Harry set down his clipboard and picked up the lube, slicking up his two right fingers again. Malfoy had a hand on each synthetic buttock, parting them to reveal a realistically puckered hole, and Harry realised he would need to at least partly lean on Malfoy’s arm if he was going to be able to do what he needed to. He thrust his fingers in quickly, smearing the lube around as efficiently as he could manage, then squeezed some more onto King Dong. With a quick tap of his wand, both dildo and doll glowed a soft lavender.
“So you knew you were gay, even then?” They’d reached the laneway. Malfoy took a quick look around them, and seeing they were alone on the road, took out his wand and proceeded to charm the words
“Ugh, god,” Harry glared, and studiously ignored the flush blossoming up his throat. “I take it back. I want to do the opposite of celebrate you.”
“Potter,” he said questioningly, but right as scheduled, Harry’s mobile rang, and he waved Malfoy off apologetically.
Next, a tshirt, a comfortable old band shirt that was faded and soft, easy to pull on with one hand while he looked for a pair of tracksuit bottoms. By the time he’d dressed, Harry’s hair was nearly dry, curling slightly around his ears, and he’d started to feel a bit dry-mouthed again. He trotted down the stairs to the kitchen, grabbing a Lucozade from the fridge and gulping it down almost in one, easing an enormous belch between his teeth, and quickly followed it with a Berocca just to be thorough.
The table roared with laughter again, and Harry chanced a look at Ron, who made a face at him that expressed disapproval and delight in equal measure. If this was his best attempt at forcing Harry to admit
"We're not enemies…" he conceded, with a lift of one shoulder. "But still. You did something for me, really important, and I've never said - I've never said -"
“I’ll come with,” Blaise said, putting a hand on the nape of Draco’s neck. “Theo can stay and make sure Pans doesn’t break any laws.” He rubbed his hand reassuringly against the close crop at the back of Draco’s head. “None of the big ones, at least.”
In his excitement, Harry accidentally apparated himself into the apartment, and blinked for a moment in confusion at the sight of their living room, and the familiar blue curtains he'd always secretly hated.
