That was not exactly what Draco had had in mind, but hey, a bit a space travel might just be what Harry and he needed to get past this whole elf-request debacle.
She had heard that he had received a Muggle burial, she shuddered at the thought, with a whole dug without magic by his so-called wizard friend.  The shame of it. No friend should refuse to use his precious magic wand for a proper send-off. Every time she thought about the rumours going around about her beloved Dobby not having received a proper Elf burial, she got mad. Mad enough to kick her butterbeer habit and get herself cleaned up and start a search for this S.P.E.W manifesto, she vaguely remembered as being pushed aside with disdain by the other house-elves into the furthest corner of the massive Hogwarts kitchen.
Sorry, I do not mean to argue with you, I just never knew that this is what he would have wanted, but if you say that this is what he would have wanted…’, Squid Harry’s voice trailed off.
‘It was quite fun, actually’, Seamus said and Harry noticed the tell-tale sooth smudges on his face, which was never a good sign.
He had thought it would be very weird for George’s wife Angelina to have Fred hanging around all the time.

~ ~ ~ ~
In fact, it was the big celebration for her 30th birthday that finally put a stop to all the non-sense. She had erected a big marquee on the site where the Quidditch world cup had been held many years previously and had invited our entire year. Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly for anyone who truly knew Luna, everybody in our year attended, apart from those who did not survive the war, of course. Luna gave a toast, saying that we were all lucky to have made it to our 30th year alive and asked for a moment of silence to remember those who had been less fortunate. Then she went on to say that it was time we all buried the hatchets. Life was too short to let things like parents, different houses and backgrounds, different world views and sexuality, ruin the one things that we all shared; being capable of humanity, friendship and forgiveness. In typical Luna-fashion she raised her glass for a toast and then asked everyone to hug the person next to them and say ‘I forgive you and I care about you’.
When all weary travellers and patients had nodded off, and the crowded house was at last silent, Harry snuck out of the room he shared with Ron and Dean and made his way to the backroom where a camp bed had been set up for Draco. He silently sat down on the floor beside the still pale looking Slytherin, who appeared to be asleep. For a while Harry watched the slight rise and fall of the boy’s chest, before tiredness overtook him. He rested his head on the side of the low bed and nodded off to sleep.
Harry took a little longer to recover from the rude awakening, but eventually managed a small smile himself.
‘We have tested a number of prototypes and Ginny has flown some of them and we have made several calculations, which Hermione and Neville have checked and double checked.
The others laughed again and pulled Harry towards the back of the workshop, where a brightly coloured contraption stood that resembled a giant version of one of the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes fire works.
‘This is better than our honeymoon’, he communicated to Harry.
She liked space: the stars, the planets, the moon…
When the pain got too much, Harry closed his eyes and passed out.
The knowing look on Luna’s gentle face, confirmed his suspicions.
It was close to midnight and Draco and himself were dressed in the bright orange space suits.
Winky had to blink twice.
‘The space suits are specially designed to withstand extreme heat and pressure, which we did test thoroughly.’, George said.
Within minutes of the first guests arriving, she realised the flaw in her plan. All the guests were wearing fancy dress costumes, with most of them hiding their faces behind masks or even wearing full head-to-toe animal suits that obscured their entire features. How would she be able to identify Harry among the ghouls, vampires, ghosts, guests wearing snake heads or lion heads in honour of their houses, or dragon heads and many other weird and wonderful disguises.
‘A proper send-off through S.P.A.C.E.’, she shouted.
His heart filled with relief and joy and for the first time that day, Harry felt that maybe this day would end better than it had started.
In fact, Harry was slightly puzzled himself by Draco’s action, but guessed that it was not prompted by a desperate need to save the little elf.
Luna showed them where she had temporarily stored the remains of the little elf at the back of Neville’s cold-storage shed. Luna had again outdone herself. With Winky’s help she had made Dobby look incredibly life like. The beautiful death mask was the image of the carefree elf and he was dressed in an eclectic mix of colourful clothes, hats, scarves and socks, made by Winky and Luna. Beside his head lay the stone that Harry had carved with the inscription ‘Here lies Dobby, a Free Elf’.
Once again Ron had hit the nail on the head without realising it.
3.	get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures
Harry could not believe they were doing this.
As soon as Malfoy left, Winky sidled up to the Squid person.
He had once asked Fred why he had not gone on, after he died.
Winky had looked at the piece of paper so many times now that she could nearly recite the words off by heart, but she still did not understand what it was supposed to be about.
‘You are joking?, Harry muttered, knowing full well that they were not.
‘Did you say, Dobby?’, the Squid head murmured.
Harry looked from one to the other, while Draco raised his eyebrows at Neville while simultaneously glancing over at George and his ghost-twin Fred.
‘First of all we are going to burn this silly manifesto before it can do any more harm. I don’t think you really want to start a S.P.A.C.E. campaign do you? I mean there is nothing wrong with wanting to campaign, but I get the feeling that you are not really keen to pursue it further.’
The original heading had been crossed out and replaced with something with the acronym S.P.E.W.
‘What?’, Hermione said.
All the anger she had felt for this wizard over the past few years dissipated instantly.
THE END
2.	changing the law about non-wand use
He had been thinking along the lines of some sort of rocket launcher to shoot a casket with Dobby’s remains into space, but an entire spaceship…why not?
They all looked at her in stunned silence. They had all forgotten about Winky. The only one who had remembered the elf was Luna, kind, caring Luna.
Harry had only understood some parts of the excited, technical explanations, but understood enough to realise that they were planning on shooting him into the sky like a boomerang.
Harry had already tried the diplomatic route of asking the muggle prime minister, without going into any detail as to why he was requesting this and what he was referring to, to approach the muggle president with the request to include a commemorative space capsule in their next Space Shuttle launch, but the muggle president was having none of it. ‘Get you own damn Space Shuttle, we are not a taxi-service.’, was the reported reply.
Harry woke with a start and sat bold upright, immediately wide awake, but the eyes staring down at him did not reflect the sneering words spoken by those gorgeous, delicate lips.
‘It is about Dobby, Sir’
Of course we had to recreate your fabulous bathroom, and create the most luxurious bedroom imaginable, as those are the two rooms we use most frequently in what I call our forever home, as I have no intention of ever moving house again.
‘Small problem?’, Fred shouted as he floated above Draco, hands on hips, ‘I have you know that this was not a small problem. We spent every waking moment working on this small problem of yours, I have you know.’
Winky hiccupped again and this time nodded her head eagerly.
What would have probably surprised most of them, and would most definitely have scared the shit out of some of them, is the fact that we have a very unique shared hobby, our pet snakes, Sal and Syl, which by the look of Syl, may soon end up being a whole family of snakes. I know they don’t refer to themselves by those names, and that you don’t like me calling them Sal and Syl, but as you are the only one speaking parseltongue, I can be forgiven for not being able to pronounce their snake names. Most people would be surprised if they knew you purchased the boa constrictor from London zoo and found a mate for him some time later and designed a special snake sanctuary, which to visitors looks just like an ordinary terrarium, until you actually enter it and end up in a life size jungle. They would be even more astonished, if they knew you often went in there to converse with our pets in their own language.
‘You want to send Dobby into space?’, a confused Squid Harry asked. He had only been able to hear bits of what the elf had been saying through the big fluffy squid head and was finding it hard to understand why she was spelling out the word space repeatedly .
‘I…’ Draco’s words faltered.
Never in his wildest dreams would he have expected to see his favourite elf appear with a pop in the dingy dungeon of the Malvoy home.
As usual, Ron had tapped the little wireless that morning and used the Vance password to listen to today’s messages, as the trio packed up the tent.
Immediately both young men squared up to each other with murderous looks in their eyes.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
‘Jeez, Fred, can you be more obvious about plugging your Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products’, Harry thought.
The next time we have a fight, it will make for a nice apology gift, though we do seem to fight less frequently these days. Sometimes I just start a fight to have an excuse to make up with you later in the bedroom. I have a feeling that you have caught on to this, as I have noticed that you participate into these fake fights with great enthusiasm.
Then a loud ‘Noooooooooo’ erupted and a silver haired boy flew in front of the flying object and wrapped his arms around the group, as they apparated from the mansion.
Not that she remembered much of that period in her life, as she had been in a constant butterbeer fog, but she remembered Dobby. Kind, stubborn, misguided, but most of all fiercely loyal Dobby.
Draco had of course heard all the rumours about how Harry had buried Dobby, digging a grave with his bare hands, but he never discussed this with Harry.
Harry James Potter, you make me a better person, will you marry me?
Finally they were ready to set off.
When the night of ball arrived, Winky was keeping an eye on the entrance door from behind one of the massive carved pumpkins that were dotted around the Great Hall.
Even so, Harry hoped that Draco and himself would be able to return in physical form to tell everyone about their trip.
Draco watched them leave and wondered what exactly he had set in motion.
Luna had gone to Hogwarts a few days after Draco had invited them to the Malvoy-Potter home to outline Harry’s quest. Something had not resonated well with Luna and she decided to visit Winky to hear the story from the horse’s mouth so to speak. I did not make sense to her that Winky wanted Harry to send Dobby into space.
He also detected rune-like markings and was that an amulet of sorts?
‘Don’t get any ideas, lover boy’, Harry communicated back, ’We are on a mission and I don’t want to end up floating in space for eternity because you could not keep your hands to yourself.’
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
On the bottom end of the contraption was a small container with a see-through lid, beautifully crafted and large enough to contain an elf-sized object. The inside was clad with colourful satin fabric depicting scenes that brought back lots of fond memories to Harry of all the times his life had intersected with Dobby’s. Luna’s painting skills were legendary, but even she had to admit that she had outdone herself with this master-piece.
~ ~ ~ ~
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 With a tremendous roar that even drowned out Seamus’ whoops of delight, the rocket took off and Draco gripped Harry tightly as they hurdled into the air. Binding spell or no binding spell, he was not letting go of him.
And with a pop she disappeared just as Harry’s scrumptious date returned to the table.
She also did not care about wand-use. There wasn’t a single elf who could not perform the same magic as wizards and they did not need some stupid wand to perform their magic, nor did they need to shout silly spells. Of course they were not going to let their masters know the level of magic they were capable of. Best to let sleeping dragons lie, as the saying goes.
People sometimes wonder why I still call you Potter, but over the years it has become my pet name for you, and you don’t seem to mind it. Even in Hogwarts, calling you Potter was a way for me to address the love of my life in public, without anyone realising. Anyone, but Luna that is. Thankfully you don’t feel the need to call me Silvery or Slippery Dragon in public.
‘Why two?, he asked.
‘Space suits?’, Harry shouted, only now realising that the two bright orange things which he had mistaken for Halloween costumes were in fact space suits with large bubble helmets. On the back were the signatory intertwined Ws from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.
There must be something he could do.
Winky was very confused that Harry wanted to send Dobby into space, but the loud music was giving her a headache and all this campaigning for S.P.A.C.E. was just too difficult and tiring and it made her want to drink.
It was therefore in an act of sheer desperation that he took out the small piece of mirror and silently mouthed HELP.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
‘Hello, Winky, How are you doing and what can I help you with?, a kind muffled voice sounded from beneath the Squid head.
Can you remember how long it was before you shared my bed? It was quite some time, as we wanted our friends to get used to us being in the same room together without glaring at each other, one hand always poised on our wand. Maybe we were naïve, but neither of us had anticipated that our friends would be so unforgiving of us being friends, never mind being more than friends. The only person who was completely accepting of our friendship was Luna, who always suspected that I had feelings for you at school. She often would catch me staring at you and would whisper ‘You are not your father, you know’, before skipping off to wherever she had been on her way to.
I secretly wrote you love letters, which I never sent. For appearances sake, I kept up the charade of going out with a girl my parents had chosen for me. I liked her fine when we were younger, but by the time our Hogwarts letters came, I already knew that she and I would never make it to the isle.
‘We will light this bit here and that will shoot you into the sky with enough force to…  we incorporated some of the magic we use for fireworks, with some apparition… you squeeze through some wormholes to save time… lot faster that way than muggle space shuttles… you just ride it like a broom really… and just before you reach the asteroid belt you can release this lever to launch Dobby’s Capsule into orbit…and then the g-force will catapult you around the moon and you should have enough force to re-enter the atmosphere around the earth and then gravity will take over and you will land safely back home.’
Harry looked amused at the free elf sitting in front of him. It was quite obvious that Dobby had trouble reconciling Draco’s heroic act with the usual behaviour of the family he had once served.
He let the twins and Seamus explain how it would work.
‘I wouldn’t do that. At night I mostly hang out with other ghosts, in Hogwarts or in the Leaky Cauldron, there are plenty of us around, you know. Sometimes I hang out with Cedric and recount quidditch matches. Stuff like that you know and then in the morning I am back helping George with the shop and inventing new products. Not a bad after life really.’
She outlined the ideas she had for the cloth she was going to paint, which would line the little space capsule.
‘You won’t be able to bring your wands, of course, but you are both well able to perform non-verbal spells should it be necessary.’
Luna agreed to come back in a few weeks to show Winky the finished shroud and promised to paint lots of flowers and stars and elves as well as images of his friend Harry Potter.
They do a lovely one now which includes a glass of champagne, something you are quite partial to. Just as well we don’t have to put up with the muggle rules of drink driving. There is no such thing as drink apparating restrictions, though, as you well know from our Ministerial reports, there are occasions when apparating under the influence leads to some unfortunate appearances of wizards at muggle gatherings. Luckily they put it down to photo bombing and muggles seem to be quite keen to get in on the act of popping up in photos unannounced.
‘Gone on where, Harry? Everything and everyone I love is here. I go on when George is ready to join me. Until then I have plenty of things to keep me occupied.’
We were oblivious of the rain that was coming down in buckets, which was why we had both been running in the first place.
‘Thank goodness we have friends who know what they are doing’, Harry smiled.
Without any warning, they could feel the catapulting force described by the twins and Seamus swinging them in an arc back towards Earth.
‘Don’t worry, Harry’, Luna piped up. ‘We have really thought of everything. We added Binding charms to your space suits, to make sure you two stick close together and stick to the rocket.’
All Winky could see was a pink squid shaped head and a tangle of wriggly tentacles that were clearly charmed, as they seemed to be moving independently causing a bit of a stir. One tentacle grabbed a drink from a passing tray, another playfully pulled at a lion’s tail of one of the female guests, and one seemed to be caressing the leather clad bottom of his companion.
‘Hey, wait a minute, how are we going to breathe up there? Is there not something about there not being any oxygen in space, or something?’
~ ~ ~ ~
Even my Father has by now gotten used to the idea that his only son has pledged his love to the Boy who Lived. You did not meet my parents under the best of circumstances and over the years you probably have been at the receiving end of my Father’s wrath more often than I have been, but in his own way my Father is grateful to you and happy for us, at least as happy as he is capable off after his total fall from grace during the war. My mother is much more open about showing her gratitude for the times that you have saved my life and while she had other plans for her only child, she is genuinely happy for us.
Winky was taken aback and for a few seconds did not know what to say.
The working conditions clause was the only thing that some elves might want to improve, but really, there were only a handful of wizarding families who were excessively cruel. Most masters just ignored them and let them go about their business, which had suited Winky perfectly well when she was working for the Crouch family. The only time she had been unhappy was when she had to sit at the highest part of the stadium at the Quidditch World Cup, but that was only because she had a fear of heights. She had been too embarrassed to tell Mr Crouch and she regretted that ever since. Poor Mr Crouch. She was very sorry that he had been killed and by his own son no less. Barty Jr had been a bit of a dish, Winky blushed at the thought. She had fancied the young wizard when he was a boy. Her mother used to have to give her a clip around the ear to stop her from staring at the young master. So handsome, he had looked good enough to eat. But then again, elves did not really eat wizards, unless they were forced to and then they invariably tasted worse than they looked.
‘It is Winky, Sir’, she said, unable to keep the ingrained deference from her voice.
Dobby had always been going on about how good Harry Potter was and how he always treated Dobby as an equal, but Winky had never believed him. Some Masters were kind, but no wizard had ever treated her as an equal, so the question knocked her for six.
‘Gosh, this has been such a nightmare…’
‘Shit’, Hermione thought, ‘exactly like S.P.E.W’ and she glanced at Luna for confirmation.
Harry had to admit that the twins had never steered him wrong when it came to their inventions, Seamus however…
As expected, Luna was full of wacky ideas, Seamus was mad excited and Ron just scratched his head every time a new idea was thrown into the group. Hermione and Neville had a more thoughtful approach and Ginny was just keen to fly the space ship.
I am so grateful that you are my Past, Present and Future.
‘Into space?
Then all of a sudden he remembered that they were supposed to be going into space, the final frontier.
He had to think of something, or at least he had to get someone else to think of something and he supposed there were only a handful of people who could come up with a solution to this.
Aims listed in the manifesto were:
‘Don’t worry, Harry, Neville has that covered’, Hermione said.
‘Oh yeah’, Fred said, ‘Myrtle told me all about that. She is quite a character that one, with a wicked sense of humour. Quite an eye for the young gentlemen students as well’, he winked.
How I would gently kiss your forehead at the end of the night. Just a little sweet peck to signify the start of a new beginning for us. Poor Pansy must have taken the wistful gleam in my eyes for undying love. She was not wrong, only she was not the object of that love.
‘I am glad you are ok, Harry’, Draco finally said.
‘There are also tonnes of protective spells and anti-collision charms added to the rocket and the suits.’
Ok, so maybe she could approach him at the upcoming Masquerade Ball that he was attending here in Hogwarts with his husband next week.
Muggles had put men on the moon decades ago, so it could not be that complicated.
Once Harry had recovered from the shock of seeing all his old friends in one place on a day that was not any of their birthdays or feast days, he asked what was going on.
‘Glad you are here with me,’ he messaged Draco and he felt a tight squeeze in return.
You must think this is all just one big drunk confession, but I promise you it is not. I may have taken a firewhisky or two to steady my nerves, but I am far from drunk, at least not from alcohol.
Harry touched the stone and was again overcome by emotion as he looked at the little elf, who called himself Harry’s friend.
S.P.A.C.E. would be for Dobby, she decided happily. Maybe she should change the name to Society for the Promotion of After Care for Elves (S.P.A.C.E)? Now all she needed was a plan of action.
While there was an unspoken understanding that nothing would happen that first night, we did end up in your luxurious bathroom, which reminded me of the prefects’ bathroom in Hogwarts. ‘We are wizards’, you shrugged, when I raised an eyebrow, ’after years of putting up with muggle plumbing in a bathroom I had to share with my aunt and uncle and nephew, I decided that I deserved a bit of luxury in my spare time.’ And what luxury it was, the scent of the bubbles and lotions in my nostrils was enough to make me weak in the knees and if I had not already been madly in love with you, soaking with you in this beautiful bath tub would have been enough to send me begging. With our sponges we explored each other’s scarred bodies, which still showed tell-tale signs of the war.
‘I didn’t want to do any of it, you know…’
Draco laughed into his bubble helmet. ‘No worries, Potter, it will keep.’
From the first time I saw you, I have wanted you and from the first time we fully gave ourselves to each other, I knew I wanted to share the rest of my life with you.
‘Glad it all worked out’, Draco communicated back, admiring the view of their planet as it grew bigger on their approach.
‘Secondly, this is going to be our little secret. You want Dobby to have a proper send-off in a nice suitable vessel surrounded by the things he loved in life, right?’
Hermione, ‘The Brain’, Granger of course, or possibly she went by Weasley now since her marriage to Ginny, who would also be a great asset to the think-tank; Luna Lovegood, who might be wacky, but had more creative juices than anyone he knew; Neville Longbottom, who matched Hermione’s intellect when it came to book knowledge and knew his way around potions, despite years of trembling in Snape’s presence; Seamus Finnegan, who as McGonagall called it, had a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics, which might come in handy for this particular job; and he supposed he would have to ask the Weasel, as Harry still considered Ron his best friend despite the fact that Ron was not fully reconciled with his marriage to Draco. He wasn’t sure what Ron could bring to the group, but Harry would never forgive him, if he did not include Ron. There was no point in asking some of his Slytherin buddies, they were even less accepting of his marriage to Harry than Ron and they would just laugh at the notion of sending an elf-corpse into space. Oh, they would happily do so, but not for any noble reasons. Draco sighed, being married to Harry was wonderful and exciting, but also immensely complicated.
~ ~ ~ ~
I knew then for a fact that you were my soulmate. Despite our vastly different backgrounds and all the things my family and I had inflicted on you, you were able to see past all that and make a joke about it. I don’t think I could have loved you more at that very moment.
The original S.P.E.W. movement never took off, not least because it had been a mad idea forced on elves by an ignorant Muggle-born wizard, followed by the Wizard war that made everyone forget about elves until they needed them, and of course the untimely death of the only Free Elf in the wizarding world. Yet somehow a copy of the S.P.E.W manifesto surfaced some years later in a corner of the Hogwarts kitchen.
~ ~ ~ ~
‘Are you sure, this will work and will last for the correct amount of time?’ Harry asked.
Dobby was safely stowed in his burial capsule and looked very peaceful and they had gone over the various procedures several times. They had test flown the rocket without any propulsion just to see how it handled. It was a bit more sluggish than flying a broom, but between the two of them they were well able to manoeuvre the big contraption. How they would feel once they were launched into space at frightening speeds was another matter, but they were both up for the adventure.
The rest of the gang laughed at the sight of the outraged ghost.
‘Yes’, Neville said, ‘It was really quite an interesting project. First I had to find a plant with similar properties as Gillyweed, but which allowed you breathe in space instead of under water. It is the same principle really. It took me while to find one, but then I remembered  that there was a Himalayan Mandrake that had quite interesting properties, which combined with Gillyweed turned out to be perfect for the job. We also needed a way for you to communicate up there. I know you both have some telepathic ability, so I looked for something that would boost your natural ability and used the dirigible Plum for this. I have been doing quite a bit of research into the dirigible Plum lately, thanks to Luna, and it is a fascinating plant. It also takes care of all your dietary needs during the trip. Now, because you will be gone for quite a while and you do not really want to eat tonnes of the stuff or drink litres of potions, I managed to distil what I have called Stellaria Maxima into quite a nice small capsule that you can take just before you take off. It will kick in at the time you reach the correct altitude and then will help you breathe in space and allows you to communicate telepathically.’
All Harry and Draco wanted to do was to go home to bed. It had been quite an adventure.
He gently helped the boy up and once they were both standing face to face, he wrapped his arms around the taller boy and hugged him so tight that Malvoy groaned, ‘Watch it Potter, that hurts’. But there was none of the usual malice in the boy’s tone.
All the tension of the past number of months left Harry’s body and for the first time in a very long time, Harry felt safe and at home.
They might have been the world’s biggest pranksters, but they were quite ingenious when it came to inventing magical devices.
Do you remember the first time we gave in to our feelings? I think we met at some Ministry function and we reached for the same piece of shrimp on the buffet table. An electric current ran from our finger tips through our bodies and when our eyes met, we both knew that this time there was no going back. We made polite conversation for a while in front of our colleagues, before making our separate excuses to leave early. My heart still beats faster when I think of that night. We talked for hours entwined on the couch in your living room, fully clothed, while gently stroking each other’s hands and wrists and arms. Subtle slow caressing movements, while we talked about our feelings.
Hermione completely agreed and the others simply nodded in stunned silence.
So how could he help Harry.
