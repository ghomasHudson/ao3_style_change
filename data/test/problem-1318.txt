“Mate,” Ron tried, but his voice cracked. He cleared his throat, embarrassed, and tried again. “Mate. What…” He trailed off. There was a drained bewilderment in his voice.
Hermione frowned a little. "I don't understand."
"It is my home, elf, that is hardly necessary," Lucius snapped. He took in the scene before him: Harry and Draco sitting next to one another at a small round table, Harry tracing the lines of the marquetry with his fingers. "I realise I instructed you to befriend Harry Potter, Draco, but you appear to have taken that instruction more to heart than I could have anticipated."
"You have a letter, Master Potter," Kreacher said grudgingly.
Harry looked around all the faces in the room. “I have made mistakes. I am not perfect. I never was. But on the day you all needed me most, I walked out to meet Voldemort and die knowing exactly what my fate would be. Then I came back, to finish what had to be done. I have done my duty all my life.
Sirius nodded.  "Do you truly believe," he said, coming to sit next to Harry at last, "that Draco Malfoy would do the same for you?"
sounded behind him, Harry spun at once, pulling his wand out and levelling it at the door.
"Well," Malfoy said, aiming for his usual drawl but not quite managing it. "I think we understand one another now."
The words blurred before Harry’s eyes.
“No further questions at this time.”
“Yeah,” Potter said ruefully. “Some people I thought I could trust and some I never actually touched. You’re only the fourth person I’ve slept with you know. And you didn’t even remember it. Between you and Oliver, I might have got a complex.”
“Could Ginny be convinced to travel for a while?”
At once a hush fell over the previously bustling room before the conversation picked up promptly at twice the previous volume and speed. Harry prayed that he would do nothing to embarrass himself as he and Sirius proceeded to where Mr and Mrs Bones waited to greet them, both well-dressed but to look at them definitely people with preoccupations other than fashion.
“Not yet,” he said, and then his hands were beneath Draco’s knees, drawing them up, placing them on his shoulders. Potter muttered something and slid two lubricated fingers inside Draco, who cried out raw and incoherent at the intrusion. His body remembered the night before even if he did not and gave way easily to Potter’s fingers. Potter smiled at him and gave his fingers just a little twist; Draco felt his cock jerk, and cried out again, closing his eyes tight in case it all became too much.
“It feels as though everything is spinning out of control,” Harry said. He ran his hand over his face, slipping his fingers beneath his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose.  “I don’t know what to do.”
"Mm, no matter," Draco said. "I was waiting for you; we need to visit Twilfit & Tattings."
Genuinely doesn’t know Potter’s single, Draco noted. “Good.”
“Yes,” Draco acknowledged. “Yes, I know that was hard for you. If something like it happens again, bring me back here and fuck me brutally until I feel like myself again.”
"I really wish you would cease from harping on that point," Draco snapped. When falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of happiness?
"One door, six rooms?" Harry guessed.
“We are all deeply distressed by this case, and we can only hope that you conduct yourself in a more appropriate manner once your sentence is complete. This trial is now adjourned.”
"We write," Ginny said, smiling. "Not as often these days. She is still unmarried but she rather prefers it that way I think."
Pansy had arranged to meet Gabrielle for lunch at Tore de Pants. When Draco arrived, Pansy was already chain smoking, her usual activity in lieu of actually eating, and Gabrielle was sipping a Pumpkin Pimm’s. The little tart.
"I suppose after the quietude of a life alone the idea of the whole family Christmas might be intimidating," Sirius concluded at last.
"Madam Pomfrey has managed to alleviate the pain," Harry said, taking another long pull on the cigarette. He coughed a little – it was not his vice, but Sirius kept them in the house for stressful times such as these.
Harry’s cock stirred. “And if it goes well?”
“What did Malfoy want?”
“You said you and he argued over some bill or other?”
Diggory met his gaze at last and sighed. “Well and so, young Potter. We had quite the lively discussion over the relevant laws and statutes and have concluded that the appropriate punishment for you will be two years in Azkaban.”
Harry was troubled by another thought, one which had come to him periodically before now, but which had in every case before been ruthlessly shoved to the back of his mind. Now, however, he felt the need to ask. "How much of your father's politics do you agree with?"
Draco realised he’d let that slip – good lord, he was all over the place this morning. “I mean that there doesn’t seem to be any truth to it.” Significant pause. “Because there isn’t – is there?”
"You may say it is selfish and I cannot help but agree. But I have been desperately lonely, Hermione," Harry said, pleading now.
Harry opened his mouth to say that he would be coming back but Draco had already snapped, “
"You are gone for long stretches of time," Draco replied smartly, "and married besides. Do you think if I were suddenly afflicted with the green sickness of celibacy it would raise no comment?"
Filch continued to squirm. He could not possibly look guiltier, Harry thought. “I think he visited the rooms. Maybe to see about renting one.”
By some incredible good fortune, he was speaking to the one person who would not judge him for his inclinations, who would understand why he had felt compelled to follow this feeling wherever it led.
Harry’s mind was racing as he wondered who had come to see him. Who could have afforded the bribes, or held sufficient sway to ensure that they would be permitted access to such a prisoner?
He lifted a phial full of silvery liquid to the eyeline of the Wizengamot. A memory.
Harry looked at Draco sharply. "I had not thought."
I would kill him."
The parliamentary procedure here is cribbed from This House which was shown on National Theatre Live at Home. I’ve been catching up on my culture while in quarantine :)
Ginny snorted in a most unladylike fashion. "Dissembling does not suit you, husband, it never has."
"I'm inside you," Harry echoed, looking into that most dear and desired face. Draco's eyes then were so wide, his eyes almost all pupil. He looked as though his very senses had been stolen from him so that he could do nothing but feel; he had been reduced to pure sensation and Harry's nerves twitched. He caught one of Draco's hands and pinned it down on the mattress, interlacing their fingers before he began to thrust.
Harry looked away. “You make me sound like a coward.”
A flash of red hair in the corner of his eye made him look round sharply, but he could see no one familiar in his line of sight and was forced to conclude that he was suffering from mere paranoia.
Draco did, took in that face, those eyes, there but unreal.
Shaky, Harry stood a moment, breathing deeply. His mind whirling, it took him a few minutes to register that something was odd about the house; he had expected it to be dark, but he could see through the window that the lights still blazed. Harry frowned in confusion, and entered the house at once.
Some of these odd acquisitions he had presented as gifts to Harry: a green enamel ring to 'match his eyes', a pin shaped like an oak tree to signify his 'arbor vitae' – Draco loved using such double entendres and watching how they made Harry's face change.
“Is your
"Harry," Remus began, "do you really mean to live apart from Ginny? Permanently?"
Malfoy responded to the kiss by fisting his hands in Harry's hair, gasping for breath, words like "Yes" and "So good" and "Please" all spilling from his mouth. Harry did not dare explore Malfoy's body though he was desperate to touch him – the thought of running his hand over flat chest or wrapping a hand around another man's cock was just too, too much. But this, kissing him, letting Malfoy slide his jacket off and work at exposing as much of Harry's skin as possible, this in itself was enough to make Harry feel as though the whole world were breaking apart.
The committee was comprised, quite deliberately, of many people with different areas of interest and different agendas. Lord Malfoy was speaking in support of Lord Blishwick, and those two seemed to have Lord Scrimgeour firmly on his side while the opposite case was being argued by Lord Prewett and Lady Longbottom. Harry had not seen Neville's grandmother in many years and, despite age which would have bowed a Muggle woman, she was still proud and fierce as she ever had been.
,” before erupting into tears. She pulled him into a fierce hug and Harry relaxed into her strong arms around him, his face full of her bushy hair and slightly damp from her tears or maybe even some of his own.
"I did," Harry said, and he knew it for truth. If the best parts of him were his mother and father and Sirius, with shades of Ginny and Ron and Hermione, then the part which had become increasingly important, the passionate, demanding, selfish heart of him – that was Draco. "I cannot control that part within me any more than I can control you."
Sirius had employed a nanny for the duration of their stay, a Scots girl named Morag MacDougal. It was with no considerable relief that Harry left James and Albus, now fully awake, in her care and closed the door to Sirius' study.
~o0o~
They had shaken hands once before, in the middle of a room full of people, both of them wearing black leather gloves. This time, Harry had taken his off to place the potion phials within his tincture box and Lord Draco wasn't wearing his, either.
o0O0o
Harry flashed him a rueful look even as Edmund Burke, another one of the pureblood supremists got to his feet. “This bill will be crucial to ensuring that we wizards are able to rediscover a number of artefacts misplaced over the protracted period of the witch trials. It has now been long enough since Muggle brutality necessitated the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy for us to claim reparations for the lost estates, for one, and to seek specific items known to have been lost.”
Harry looked at her and felt the abject misery bleeding out of him. Hermione covered her mouth with her hand and reached for Harry's arm with the other.
Sirius's face turned chalk-white.  Harry felt a sick triumph at having seen what Sirius had not meant him to see before Sirius emptied his glass and immediately refilled it, hand shaking.
~o0o~
"Remus," he said, frowning slightly.
"Charming," Harry said, though he had been utterly unable to follow the latter half of the performance. Sirius had suggested attending a gentleman's club but Harry didn't dare; he knew instinctively that Malfoy would be there, either by design or by reason of the terrible misfortune which had caused them to meet in the first place. He insisted on going home to check on his family, leaving Sirius to spend the evening gambling his money away alone. Harry had checked on his sons before selecting a book on which he could not concentrate, to provide himself with the illusion that he was not thinking of Malfoy.
"Of course," Draco said. "But Black is a bachelor. Did he then offer much insight into the subject?"
“They’re debating, but it will be either gross indecency… or sodomy.”
"Whose fault is that?" Draco snapped back at him. "I've been right here and you've been off… Oh, Potter, do that again."
Harry's mind raced but he forced himself to stay calm.
Sirius nodded. "I could tell. She did not look herself at all."
"Quite," Lucius said with a dead-eyed smile. "I hope to see you in committee."
Harry’s blood iced over. “What do you mean?”
"Indeed," Harry said in a low voice. "And what would you have done if I had not come home in time to find you like this?"
Harry crossed to the left, looking carefully at a fixed point on the wall behind the designated area. It was a nice wall, he told himself. Lovely wooden panelling.
Ginny flushed a little, it not being at all the done thing to refer to her condition even obliquely, but she followed Dobby inside willingly enough even as Harry woke his sons.
At seven, Harry was dressed and waiting. Draco only kept him waiting ten minutes this time, and then the two were off to dine at a private establishment, Spelling's, where Nott knew the proprietor.
"And you," Harry replied honestly. He turned to Hermione and kissed her cheek. "Dear Hermione, how have you been?"
"Sirius would think it all a great adventure, surely?" Teddy said, raising himself up on his elbows. They were in the garden, enjoying the sunlight, dressed all in white. Teddy never liked formal clothes and his straw hat had already been discarded.
Hermione stood up slowly. At least Harry had told her enough that she knew about the blackmail attempt.
Sirius' lip curled upward, baring his teeth. "We are all war heroes and he is still on the fringes of society."
Draco's jaw tightened. "I am merely wondering if I should have believed you when you told me that it had been only I."
"I do not care to hear it," Draco thundered. "This place is ours, yours and mine. It is sacrosanct and you bring her here with you."
"Are you quite well, Harry?" Hermione said as she closed the door behind them, leading him into the parlour. "Goodness knows there's no need for formality between us but it isn't often you come to see me when my husband is not present – it's terribly improper, you know." She was teasing, of course–none but the cattiest of tabbies would remark on a brother and sister-in-law spending an afternoon together. She was merely telegraphing her concern, inviting Harry to confide in her.
Harry heard about it from Ron, who wrote him a letter with a few bits and pieces of news but who was really writing to ask if Harry had heard any rumblings about this at the higher levels, did he know the reasoning? He also invited Harry to dine with he and Hermione but Harry didn’t dare in case he let his own complicity slip. He did though force himself to attend the all-Weasley intervention meeting where the whole family came together to talk through Percy’s next moves. There was less pressure on Harry with so many voices in the room wanting to be heard. Percy seemed humiliated by the whole thing, always proud, and kept asking everyone to hush. Ginny had brought the children, who clustered around Harry to envelope him in their joy at seeing him. How much the boys had grown without him filled him again with guilt and self-loathing even as the sight of them lifted his spirits. So many feelings flowed through him that he recalled Hermione listing everything Cho Chang must have been feeling after Cedric’s death and how he’d struggled to understand how one person could feel so many things all at once. He understood now, when there was no friend to talk him through it; Hermione would not look at him while Ginny seemed near tears more than once. Ron was too focused on his brothers to notice, which was Harry’s only saving grace.
"Not a doubt in my mind," Sirius said gently, before resuming his briskness. "I must prepare for the Muggle relations committee. We're due to begin at half past eleven, though to be frank it will more likely be after luncheon."
“Draco knows about him.” The rest remained unsaid.
He was not ready to face Draco so he instead walked through Muggle London until he finally found himself at Grimmauld Place. Perhaps he could work out some way to bring Sirius at least partially into his confidence. It was one of the few bridges Harry had not damaged with fire, if not burnt to ash, by his relations with Draco.
"If I see one smile on your lips when we meet again, I shall need no other happiness," said Draco and then he spun around to knock over the stone and Harry disappeared.
“To destroy me.” Harry reached again for the Firewhisky – another new development. His thirsts were growing ever-deeper.
He had thought this might abash the lad but Bertram only smiled and said, “Right away, sir.”
you to Lord Draco. If you take my meaning.”
,” Pansy shrieked at him. “We have a code Gold!”
"That is not who I am."
Sirius shook his head. "Damn fine woman."
Strengths: Highly intelligent and therefore resistant to manipulation, soulful eyes
“You want us to…”
"No," Draco replied. "No, some choose instead to torture themselves by fearing that which they long for most fervently. But you and I here together, who does it hurt?"
Harry blushed a little and ducked his head.
"And you're afraid of your wife," Sirius finished for him. "That's all well and good - and no doubt exactly as God intended - but see here, Ginny has been abed for days now and you're pining."
“Mr Kirke,” she said calmly. “Is it true that you once attempted to extort money from Mr Potter?”
~o0o~
Draco sighed. Harry reached out and squeezed his hand, but the pleasure of the day was somewhat lessened.
Harry grinned at the character of the letter. He had looked forward to seeing Sirius, of course, but it did rather leave him at a loose end as he had anticipated spending that evening with his godfather. The hotel suite was not booked until the following night.
Harry could feel the blood drain from his face.
~o0o~
“Of course I know,” Draco said, kissing the tip of Harry’s nose fondly.
"A little," Harry saw no harm in confessing. "He has a reputation, to be sure, but I find him to be a very useful person to discuss upcoming policy with as he can always think of the criticisms which will be levied at the bill."
"Everyone will be there!" Sirius crowed.
Harry very carefully put down his cup. "You insult my lineage and my family, Lord Malfoy."
Filch’s mouth opened and closed rapidly.
Draco swallowed and looked away.
Harry rallied as best he was able. "I shall endeavour to do so!" he managed before he found himself alone and was able to make his escape to the billiard room.
~o0O0o~
He could not face the thought of Godric's Hollow and his familial home so he wrote to Ginny to let her know that business would hold him in town a few days longer and he would instead travel to the Burrow with Sirius on the twenty-third.
"Oh, hours at least."
Harry nodded. “He told me that he thought I should leave for Europe. That the Malfoys won’t just let this go.”
Sirius laughed again, sharp and hurt. “A Malfoy, of all people! They are all cruel, Harry, even the ones who are not outright evil. Abraxas Malfoy was well-known for spit-roasting a house elf who displeased him over his fire! Morpheus Malfoy earned his nickname by inventing the Draught of Living Death, which he used liberally on all his political opponents.”
Lucius paid her no attention. "And your children? You have three, I believe?"
Hermione nodded slowly. "All right, Harry."
Harry hadn't expected such a direct question. "Er," he said.
Kreacher bowed. "Yes, Master Potter, Master Black has gone away for several days and taken Dobby with him. Always he is favouring Dobby though Kreacher has served the family longer, it is shameful…"
are paying for it all?” Sirius said, incredulous. “Despite all of Malfoy’s money?”
"Oh! No, do not hide your face from me," Draco said, reaching out to tip Harry's face back up. "I would see you."
To hear Sirius, reckless Sirius of all people speak of running away!
The shock of a lady’s presence after the soft delight of finding Lord Draco was like an abrupt soaking in ice water. The pleasant, drugging sensation he had been experiencing quite vanished and Harry felt a frisson run though him of disaster narrowly averted. He had the perfect excuse to leave now as he and the lady were not acquainted, and Draco had not seen fit to begin introductions.
“Always so plebeian, Potter,” Draco teased. Somehow Harry knew that it was intended this time to soothe him, and to some extent it worked.
Draco's mouth was hot and eager beneath Harry's, opening to receive Harry's tongue which swept once across his lips before delving inside. Draco's hands slid over Harry's shoulders to tug at his hair while pulling him closer, urging the kiss on and on. Over and over again Draco's tongue met Harry's, their lips crushed together, their breathing growing ever more ragged. Harry felt as though he were in some state of delirium and as he clutched at Draco's skin, all Draco's games and challenges were swept away at last.
The guilt still clawed at him but Ginny was right in that Harry was at peace with himself for the first time he could remember, perhaps the first time ever. The balance had been struck: politics and town and Draco when the Wizengamot was sitting, country and children and Ginny during the six recesses each year.
Reprieved, Harry smiled gratefully at him and they continued their meal. But the world had found them at last, and both were a little subdued - until, that is, Draco pulled Harry through to the bedroom.
"Muggle-born, then, have it your way. It is mere semantics."
Fawley tried to reason with him but Smith simply stunned him – and who could blame him for that course of action? When he came to, he was chained to the floor. The chains had been there since his first day in the cell but this was the first time he had actually been bound in them. He wondered if it was because of the outburst or just because they
Harry swallowed. "Not even Ron."
Harry reached to link his fingers through Draco's hand and Draco shouted in pain though he tried to stifle it. Harry pulled away concerned and looked at Draco's missing finger. He seemed to concentrate only a moment and then the finger grew back, pink perfect flesh precisely as it had been before.
"Tell me!" Harry snapped, that strained voice coming once again.
“That is correct, Minister.”
“Do you wish to speak at all, to provide context?”
“Memorable this time?”
The consuming need to please Oliver Wood at school. The moments when he looked at Ron's brother Charlie and something odd curled through his stomach. The curiosity underlying the shock of finding out what the renters were and what they did.
Harry swallowed. "I thought you said Lord Malfoy was not a member of this committee."
“Oh, well, if it’s just him,” Gabrielle said, her accent abruptly much more comprehensible. “What do you want, Malfoy?”
There was something to that, perhaps. Harry sighed. "I merely wish to have my wife back. You remember when we used to enjoy one another's company? When we used to talk about sports or some interesting new development in magic or politics?"
"Show me," Harry said heavily, and Draco did, sliding his shirt from his shoulders and opening his trousers to slide one hand on his cock. His other hand curled awkwardly around Harry's face, elbow bent, wrist against cheek, fingers tight in dark unruly hair. Draco gasped and tugged and Harry watched, rapt, never looking away except to press the occasional kiss to Draco's wrist.
Draco straightened his cufflinks, examining himself in the large mirror which was in the middle of telling him how attractive he looked. “All the more reason for us to go, don’t you think?
Harry's eyebrows shot up. "Did she say something of the kind to you?"
Harry's fingers shook as he raised them to his mouth. "Is it not painful?"
The boy tilted his head to one side. "For a discerning customer, we have certain choice images that might not be appropriate for just anyone, if you take my meaning."
Harry's cock had been soft but at this it began to harden again, and became full almost at once when Draco looked up at him with heavy-lidded eyes and pressed his lips to it. Harry groaned as Draco first licked the tip: the sound seemed to electrify Draco, who opened his mouth and took Harry in deep. The tip of his cock was against the palate of Draco's mouth, his tongue flattened beneath and Draco pulled back slightly only to surge forward with more determination. Harry could not keep silent at this; his breathing increased and he began to grunt as Draco continued to look at him and suck on his phallus.
"Is you having breakfast Harry Potter sir?" Dobby asked. "Dobby can make you finest breakfast!"
“I mean, Draco, that I have already betrayed my wife and family and friends and now you’d have me betray everything I fought for?”
Did the whole wizarding world know this address? Harry sighed and put his wand away. “What do you want, Zabini?”
By the time the appointed day came, Harry hadn't heard from Malfoy at all and was glad of it.
He’d had a lot of time to daydream, and Draco only appeared in every other one.
Harry sank into the nearest chair himself. There was no way to deny it now.
"I do not believe I would like to spend much time away from home having only recently returned," she said.
“Good,” Potter said, and before Draco could manage any kind of comment, his mouth was full of Potter’s tongue.
That Strathpeffer was beautiful, Harry could not deny. The large hotels in the modern style were at odds with the sweeping hills and gnarled old trees surrounding the town. It was quite the resort, with the pump room and numerous Healers available to suggest the best relaxation techniques. Molly was as good as her word; she took over the care of the children so that the nanny was able to go home to her family for a few weeks, leaving Ginny free to divide her time between them and the sulphuric waters which everyone kept insisting held great restorative properties.
"Potter," he snarled as Harry brushed past him. "I will give you yet another piece of advice you will not heed, though it may be the best advice you will ever receive."
Draco raised an eyebrow. "You are seeing all of me at this very moment, are you not?"
Draco laughed shortly and reached for his robe, pulling his wand from a pocket. Instinctively, Harry reached for his; Draco noticed the movement.
“Bien,” she said. “So you suddenly want to help me?
curse? Have you tried the remedy for Amortentia?"
Harry chuckled. “I suppose you could say that.”
"Many couples live apart for reasons of business or convenience. Our situation in being together throughout our married life is atypical as you know."
"I suppose I have," Harry acknowledged. "It didn't start out that way; I was spending a great deal of time at the Wizengamot. I sit on four committees now."
~o0o~
And yet when the concierge asked him, "And will you be staying with us over Christmas, sir?" Harry's response was, "I will spend it with family, but please do hold the room until the end of January."
"Would that not seem strange? If it were to be only us four?"
Harry trusted Draco in some ways but not with the secrets of another. “Something like that. He also went to great lengths to warn me that your father would stop at nothing to separate us.”
Draco's sudden scrambling forced Harry to lever himself upright. As Draco twisted himself around Harry thought for a moment that he was about to start a fight, but instead Draco wrapped his legs tight around Harry and kissed him so fiercely Harry was certain he felt his heart squeeze in his chest.
“I suppose we will see,” Harry said, already wondering what fresh hell tomorrow would bring.
"Lucky you have room enough for them all. I can't thank you enough."
“I thought you two were already at odds?”
“Hermione?” He was right, it would have been obvious but for the distance that had grown between the two of them. “Ron, I know she’s the cleverest person we know but surely someone with more experience in the field—”
Harry could not look away from Draco's mouth, the mouth that had been on his, on his body, the mouth that had elicited such raw
Harry had spent the end of the previous week trying his best to remain calm and personable but he knew he had been a little fractious despite his best efforts. The weekend had been spent with Ginny, who had welcomed him home. The boys had been so happy to see him. James’s light hair was darkening into something more like his mother’s auburn while Al remained quite the image of his father. And Lily was crawling!
Harry and Draco were having afternoon tea when all at once a familiar Patronus in the form of a large silver dog entered the room.
Harry pressed his lips to her forehead. "Let the party begin!" he muttered under his breath.
Harry shifted, uncomfortable at the way Sirius made his love for Ginny sound. It was not a convenience, never had been. In fact it had been quite the opposite at times. Harry opened his mouth to object when he looked for the first time to the box directly opposite theirs and saw Lord Draco Malfoy.
“I know how
“Draco wants to fuck all of you,” Harry said bluntly. “I am but here to watch. You can bring me more gin.”
Draco looked up at him. "You fear me?"
“That was a hundred years ago!”
Harry sighed, the fight leaving him all at once. “Yes, I know. I know, Draco, but I have it in my power to stop all of this. I bolstered myself against an attack so he has turned instead no my family.”
“Oh Merlin, you’re no fun!” Pansy sulked. “I promise, it’s good.”
“You’re telling me,” Draco wailed, “that last night I fulfilled the fantasy of years and got you to go to bed with me, but I was so drunk I barely remember any of it?”
When Harry reached up Draco smacked his hand away. It was not a playful gesture but one born of equal parts determination and frustration. Draco opened Harry's trousers in seconds and pulled them down his legs only to find boots preventing their being completely shed.
Harry had at once recoiled, jerking away from Draco without quite meaning to, unable to control the violence of his reaction. His erection began to soften almost at once and he turned away from his lover in shame.
"What?" Harry started. "No, I… I never thought you would tell anyone about that. No, that's not why I'm here."
Harry swallowed.
A frown crossed Ginny's face. "You are displeased?"
"You do not yet know what it has cost," Sirius said sharply.  Harry could make no answer; he fell silent.
"Very well," Harry said, which was how he found himself in the Black opera box not two hours later.
Harry absorbed this. "His son is like him?"
"I love your family," was all the answer Harry had to offer. Molly had been such a comfort to Ginny he could hardly gainsay a visit, despite his rising irritation at the influence she exerted. Harry had loved Molly Weasley as the mother he had been denied since Ron had first taken him for a visit at the age of twelve, but he had not married Ginny hoping that she would become her. Indeed he had loved Ginny for her differences from her mother – her razor sharp wit, her focus on the outside world rather than her family. Her bright vibrancy was what had attracted him but that Ginny seemed to grow further away with each passing year.
“No!” Ron burst out. “Not now. Because if you tell me I’ll have to get angry with you and if I do that I won’t be able to help you so tell me what you need now and the inexpressibles will have to wait.”
He needn’t have worried, for without warning Sirius blurted, “You are prigging
The burning grey of his eyes haunted Harry for the rest of the day, swirled through his mind as Minister Shacklebolt slapped his back and called him 'My boy', as Headmistress McGonagall told him that "Albus would be very proud of you today."
Potter’s fingers were tugging at the lower half of Draco’s robes now. Everywhere he touched, Draco shivered. He’d never been so hard, couldn’t imagine ever being this hard again unless it was with Potter, Potter who stripped his clothes from his body and then bit  his thighs. Draco looked down to see Potter looking up at him, glasses gone who-knew-where but his gaze focused as he stared at Draco’s cock.
Victoire stared at him a little and offered her hand, mumbling something.
Once they were gone, he allowed himself a long, shuddering breath, pulling the summer air deep into his lungs.
Yes, he had. Was he weaker now? Tired, perhaps? Tired of lying now that he knew what had been missing all that time.
Harry folded his arms over his chest; he had not yet put on his jacket, and so his linen shirt slid easily along his red silk waistcoat. "Permitting Aurors to use such a spell in special circumstances is hardly the same as indicating to the general population that such tactics should be used freely."
Draco recoiled as though Harry had struck him. “What do you mean by that?”
"Quite right," Molly nodded. "These years are so precious. Before you know it your children are grown and married. But you must take care of yourself!"
Draco's chin lifted. "And yet back you shall go and all shall be as it was, not so? Off you go then, Harry, and I shall go back to my life. I'm sure there's more than one renter in need of a good fuck - enjoy your inertia." And then, with a spin and a crack, Draco was gone.
"I agree, the names are too similar," he said. He looked at his daughter again, all squashed and misshapen and so very dear already. Harry looked at Ginny and looked at his baby girl and thought,
"Please," Draco sobbed, his muscles squeezing down all around Harry who could bear it no longer and came inside his lover's body. He closed his eyes just for a moment but when Draco cried "No!" he opened them again at once, so vulnerable and open to anything Draco might ever choose to ask of him.
Lucius waved the hand holding his cane. “Yes, yes, you undoubtedly hold views on such things, however, the point remains: they are reliant on salaried income. The Wizard Wheezes no doubt fund a great deal of the family lifestyle – trade, indeed – but Weasley Senior relies on his Ministry salary. As does his son in the Minister’s office. Another is an Auror.”
"Perhaps it is a reminder that love cannot be chosen," Harry said without thinking.
The roar of a fireplace attracted Blaise’s attention. He frowned as though not expecting anyone, and carefully placed a leather bookmark into his reading material.
At that Harry’s eyes flew to Lucius, who for the first time looked discomfited.
“This is a fishing expedition, pure and simple. Minister, I object to the recall of Mr Filch and ask that unless Lord Malfoy has something substantive, we move on.”
No one quite knew what to do with Harry after they arrested him. There were holding cells in the Ministry, of course, but given the sheer interest there would inevitably be in this case Dawlish reckoned they were not secure enough and was making some alternative arrangement. Harry was left there meanwhile and could almost feel the anxiety of the DMLE representatives who fluttered in and out of the room.
at some point and the rooms was instead filled with a warm glow.
Harry didn't know what to say as he pulled his clothes back on.
But who at the Ministry? Harry thought to himself sardonically. He knew.
Draco smiled wider. "Ah, well, you are lucky then Potter for such a thing is indeed within my power. You see, I might take a fancy to go back to town for a spell," he said, nuzzling at the side of Harry's face. "If you were to be there too, minus your familial entourage, well, there would be plenty of time for us then."
"I don't..."
“…from Terry Boot. That man has been desperate for even a sniff of Potter’s panties for years.”
“Your father had Percy Weasley removed from his position at the Ministry,” he told the lump huddled in the bed when he entered the room.
Harry nodded, not acquiescing, but acknowledging Draco's words, thinking it through. "Not quite yet," he said at last. "I think that this I can do, this I
"Perhaps bridges might be built?" he suggested feebly. "I am sorry, Ginny, none of this has been about what we want for ourselves."
"But I hear that there are several resorts where taking the waters has quite the same effect as the strongest potions!" Molly cried. "Why, consider Strathpeffer in the Highlands – good mountain air, a strong wizarding presence as the town is still rather inaccessible by Muggle means, and a spa where you would be able to relax, indulge yourself a little. Perhaps Arthur and I might even join you! We could look after the children while you look after yourself."
It was Sirius; Harry had been sitting here far longer than he had realised.
Strengths: Tattoos, sexy-dangerous job, hot like burning
Harry swallowed; he was doing her a disservice and he knew it. Hermione would never turn her back on anyone who needed her, especially not him, after everything they had been through in the war.
But in the night all he thought of was Malfoy, his swollen mouth and hot gasping breath.
Draco's passage was so tight that Harry feared he would last barely a moment before he reached completion. His cock was clasped and gripped; he shivered and ground his teeth and thrust again, watching Draco's eyes roll up in his head. And then the world was heat and sensation, Draco's body and his own fusing into one being. Draco met his every thrust and cried out incoherently for more, more, more. Harry gripped Draco's hand as hard as he could – it was his anchor to reality, the only thing keeping him tied to the world as his blood boiled, his veins burned. That hand and those eyes, never looking away from his own.
at Kirke when he judged himself to be a good enough distance away.
“That is correct, Minister.”
Sirius snorted. "I assure you, those days are far behind me. It's all dining with respectable families these days. Puts me in mind – while I know your wife needs her rest, it does put rather a spoke in the wheel. I had accepted an invitation to a gathering this evening. Thought Ginny could do with a bit of society before being shut away for months."
Just a moment, he told himself. Just a moment to gather his thoughts and to remember, and then he would return.
He slept but fitfully; the benefit was that he was up and out for the day before Ginny had even stirred.
He and Ginny and James and Al and a baby girl. He had always wanted a family. He would do nothing to threaten the commitments he had made.
Blaise Zabini was indeed about as good as it could have been. Draco was convinced that it was a ploy at first, a way for Blaise to ingratiate himself with the new ruling classes, but then when he saw them together there was an expression on his old friend’s face he’d never seen there before. Blaise was… happy.
A sly look on his face, Zabini said, "Mr Harry Potter, may I present my mother, most recently Mrs Blishwick but prior to that, Mrs Prince, Mrs Thurkell and a variety of others though in my heart she will always be Mrs Zabini."
“You’ll never believe,” she said with relish.
Pansy smirked. “Glad I woke you now?”
Blaise ignored him, taking in the suite instead. “It’s all rather bourgeois, but then, I suppose that was to be expected.” He hesitated. “Do you know where Malfoy is?”
"Mm," said Harry, non-committal.
"Will you be returning to town for Recall?" Lord Malfoy asked Harry with every air of solicitude.
Draco smirked. "You have perhaps never worked up such an appetite before," he replied.
“Ah, yes, Mr Potter, the wizarding hero and the heir to two fortunes looked into renting a room for the lower classes. That seems likely. Try again, Mr Filch?”
As Harry took a few long, deep breaths to steady himself, Draco curled up around him. He touched Harry’s hair, chest, face as he whispered, “So good, so amazing, Harry, yes.”
related by “sources close to Miss Weasley”.
“How would she even know?” Pansy laughed. “It’s not like she’s got a load of experience!”
Pansy snorted and took a long drag on her cigarette. “Honestly, if he didn’t like cock, I’d think you two were perfect for each other.”
~o0o~
The Muggle man had hanged in the end. It was felt that sending him to Azkaban would be inappropriate.
He had failed to consider what a burden this would be on the man who had first-hand experience of the prison to which Harry might find himself condemned. Every time Harry thought he had reached the depths of self-loathing, he discovered a new way in which he had let down someone dear to him.
~o0o~
Harry shook his head. "Teddy, you are not a boy any more and I certainly am not – a man must act with decorum."
"…disgrace the family," came a voice and Harry instinctively ducked behind a nearby tree.
“All rise for the Minister of Magic,” one of the clerks called, and the court crowd obliged. Diggory met Harry’s eyes with a sad smile as he took his chair.
Hermione took a long, shaky breath and nodded. "Let us see what we can find."
Harry shuddered slightly as Malfoy stroked his chest with one hand and his hip with the other. Long, deft fingers slid up his cravat to stroke the line of his jaw and Harry couldn't move. Malfoy's hand curled under the bottom of Harry's jacket to slip beneath the waistcoat and caress the soft skin with nothing between them there save the thin cotton of Harry's shirt.
"Too much," Harry heard himself gasping, but Draco made no answer other than to press his lips to Harry's again in an almost chaste gesture belied by the ever-quickening pace of Draco's thrusts, so fast the friction almost hurt. Still, Harry felt something within tighten and tighten, waiting to explode.
Harry suppressed a smile. “Do you like it here?”
~o0O0o~
Harry opened his mouth but Draco cut him off, "So help me, Potter, if you extol the virtues of marriage I will not be held responsible for my actions."
Narcissa gave a small cry and flew to her husband’s side.
Crabbe frowned as though that was not the response he had expected. "I will not tell Lord Malfoy that you are a common eavesdropper as it would serve only to embarrass him. You are too old to require correction like a child; show some self-discipline."
Harry hated to be rude but the boy had made him so angry that all he could force out was, "Take the money, if you please."
"I don't need it all," he promised his father with a voice terrible, forced out from a throat which no longer felt designed for the purpose. "I won't take…"
The image his mind produced at such a thought was sufficiently graphic that he jerked his hand away from the picture, taking deep breaths to calm his pulse. He glanced again at the ever-smirking face on the family tree and knew what it was Lord Draco had caused him to feel. The idea was at once grotesquely alien and horrifyingly familiar: something dark and immoral beckoned and told him it already knew his name.
Harry only had eyes for Lucius. “Did you lock him away? Try the Imperius curse? You must have tried everything you could think of to get him to turn on me but if you’d managed it then
"Of course I came, Harry," Ginny said gently.
It took another week for Sirius to wear Harry down to agreeing to attend a quiet soiree, and another week again to induce him to attend the gentlemen's club Sirius favoured. Ginny grew closer and closer to giving birth every day and Harry should have been spending his time thinking of his soon-to-come son or daughter. Instead the dreams grew stronger – Malfoy's eyes, his lips, his skin. Pale, slender limbs welcomed him into the darkness whenever he closed his eyes: Malfoy stretched out on the bed before him,
“The next witness is Philip Kirke, who I now call to testify.”
Then, at last, Ron was there. His face flushed red as his hair, his expression incredulous, his Auror robes wrinkled though well-kept. His face looked as though he had been awake every bit as long as Harry.
The boy's hat came askew as Malfoy pushed him harder against the wall. He was smiling, they were both smiling, and then Malfoy lowered his head to the boy's and flicked his tongue over the boy's lips.
Filch blustered but it was clear the answer was yes.
Harry flushed when he realised what he had been thinking, and told himself sternly,
"Er, I see you have a pine tree," Harry said, desperate for something to speak of. "Following the latest fashions?"
"She's been good as gold," Hermione said, smiling at her husband in a brittle way that did nothing to hide her discomfort; other than her teenage infatuation with him, Hermione had never hidden much from Ron.
On any other day, Harry might just have paid him off. He might have reasoned that it was the least likely to cause further harm but the truth is that he would have worried and fretted and possibly even asked Draco about it. Draco would most likely have laughed.
“For the most part, sir, though he had visitors.”
Potter appeared to be thinking, as terrifying a prospect as that was. “So wait… you didn’t come in here and throw Baddock out because you knew you and I had already…” Potter waved his hand between the two of them. “You just decided you wanted me and you were going to have me?”
“We call Argus Filch.”
~o0o~
~o0o~
“He keeps strange hours.”
Remus's face filled with regret. "I cared deeply for her," he said. "I left her because I was selfish. I had committed the act, I had made a decision and now I feared to face the consequences."
“And you won’t tell me what this is about?”
"You're going to kill yourself," Harry says quietly from the corner behind him. It's the first time he's spoken in days.
“The nays have it. The bill must be reworded before it can be considered further. Let us break here for today and begin discussion of the next agenda item on our return.”
Once inside the red and gold room, Malfoy removed his cloak and handed it to Bertram to hang for him. Harry, completely out of his depth followed suit, handing his own cloak and hat to Kirke before looking around. The décor was just as ugly here, but the room was wider. Two chaise-longues were positioned carefully opposite one another; Malfoy took a seat on one. Harry had rather expected a bed, but there was nothing of the kind, just the two chaises, a fireplace and a thick-looking rug on the floor.
“We could fight him off!”
"Yes, I know," Draco replied. "But that doesn't mean you're going to get it all your own way."
Draco leaned into Harry's touch. "At school," he said, "at school there were two boys caught being together. They were like us."
Given that Pansy had once drunkenly confided that half the reason she’d married Neville was because even after two years they were still on a twice-a-day sex schedule, Draco could only imagine that this disruption was not going down well with her at all.
all these clothes for daring to come between his skin and Draco's. He raised his hands to place his fingers in the hollow of Draco's collarbones, marvelling that they had not changed at all, that they still entranced him beyond all reason. Harry wanted to spend hours kissing his way along them but the need was too strong. Reason had deserted him completely.
“Potter?” Ernie’s hand clapped him on the back. “Are you well?”
All the tenderness they had shared, all the ways Draco had seduced him, reduced to this: Harry acting the predator Lucius had described and Draco refusing him.
"The Master and Mistress will be here very shortly, sirs," one squeaked as it backed out of the room, bowing with every step.
Harry nodded slowly. His throat was closing and his ear buzzing. Diggory’s voice was coming to him from very far away. He felt quite light headed and almost as if he was watching all of this take place from the ceiling rather than with his own eyes. Needing to confirm what he was hearing, “So I have been suspended?”
"I know what you're thinking…" he began.
Gabrielle blushed a little. Draco had never understood why she looked up to Pansy but she did, and there it was.
“No, it’s not fair!” Draco agreed.
When he turned around, Malfoy was glowering at him as though he had seen the moment which had passed between Harry and Teddy and had come to precisely the right conclusion.
"I invited Harry for dinner," Hermione said brightly. "He hasn't been enjoying the social scene in London. Sirius has been keeping him far too busy so I thought he might enjoy some quiet time here with us."
Ginny looked at Harry with wild eyes. "Harry, have you been spending time with Lord Malfoy's son?"
"Dates," Draco whispered to the plate in front of him, and sure enough, dates appeared.
It had perhaps not been as inward as he had hoped, as the first thing Ginny said to him on returning from saying her goodnights was, "You are being rather rude to my mother, Harry."
~o0o~
"And Teddy must be such a consolation to Lupin," Lucius said. "Children always are."
Blaise merely inclined his head. “I can feel the wind changing and Lucius is in the role of Aeolus. He will ruin you to bring Draco into line and Draco is not strong enough to gainsay him. This ends one way for Draco, Potter — back in the loving bosom of his family. How it ends for you is another question. If you broke with Draco now and returned to your wife, well, it might be enough. Better by far to retire to the continent.”
~o0O0o~
"We're here," Malfoy announced, abruptly rousing Harry from his thoughts as the carriage bounced to a halt. In mere moments Malfoy was out of the carriage and rapping on an unmarked door. Harry looked around nervously as he clambered out. He did not know this part of London, and the dark shadows and stares of the passers-by were making his skin crawl. The cobblestones were filthy, the archways threatening. Harry wished he had had more to drink.
“In some ways it’s wonderful to see,” Sirius said. “You seemed to be constantly retreating into yourself after the war ended. It was like all that certainty and strength bled away and you did not know how to find another place in the world.”
“I…” There were still no words in Harry’s head, still no defence to offer. Sirius had caught him completely off guard. He cleared his throat and tried, “Is this because I had lunch with him at the ministry? Because—”
The rest of the afternoon and into the evening was a barrage of questions, spells and suggested counter-potions, interrupted only when Rose demanded her mother's attention. "Do you know when you might have been slipped a potion? Have you ruled out the
“You too,” Charlie said helplessly, and off he went, one child clasping each hand, no one remembering to give back the Sneakoscope.
Harry had plunged his body into ice cold water and tried to slow his pounding heart, uncertain of everything about himself. But when he saw Teddy again he said only, "There you are, Harry – I was afraid you'd got sun stroke."
Half-truth again.
“Do you understand?” Harry repeated softly.
Draco had been consumed with it, the careless way Harry bested him, the careless way Harry had always bested him, and he needed, needed, to prove that Harry had been wrong to dismiss him all those times before.
Draco had always desired Harry, wanted to conquer and cherish, to defile and deify. But as his childish whims had given way to something far deeper and infinitely more terrifying, Draco found that he also desired the company of a man who could sympathize with him, whose eyes would reply to his. Harry had proven himself so many things: gentle and courageous, possessed of a captivating as well as of a caring spirit. His tastes were so different from Draco's own and so it always meant that much more, when Harry would deign to approve or amend Draco's plans.
He had now been away from Draco overnight, he reflected. Draco might well be frantic or furious. Harry would have preferred to wait and talk to Sirius again this morning, but he could not in good conscience leave Draco longer with no word. He sighed and rubbed his face. He had never managed to tell Sirius about the card, not with everything else they had had to say to one another. It would have to wait.
Draco's mouth curved into that particular smirk which indicated that he was about to say something he hoped Harry would find filthy. "Why, I would have reached for the oil and stroked myself, of course," he said, his fingers caressing Harry's where they lay over his cock. "I would have slicked up my hand and touched myself ever so slowly, hoping that you would come and find me, save me from my frustration."
“Older than you were when you got started,” Pansy pointed out.
"I am yours," Harry said in reply, clasping Draco's fingers ever more tightly. "I am yours."
Diggory came in. “After several rounds of voting, we have reached a majority decision. Will the accused please rise.”
"Indeed not," Ginny said. It shouldn't have hurt, but it did.
Lucius turned to look at him then and for a moment Harry panicked, wondering if the man was a Legimens. He slammed up his Occulumency shields as best he could, but Lucius’s expression did not change, and in another moment he was back to the matter at hand.
Harry reached out and took her hand, stroking his thumb over her knuckles. Usually that would be enough to calm Ginny at least a little but this time her spine stayed defiantly stiff.
"Ah yes," said Ron. "I think I remember her."
How was it possible to feel so completely himself with Draco if Harry had to sacrifice so many of his best qualities in his name?
Sirius' hand on Harry's back reminded him,
"But you still fuck other boys," Harry said sharply.
"That is rather my point, Draco," Lord Malfoy said waspishly. "You are not taking responsibility for any of our estates, you are not taking your obligations to the Wizengamot seriously, you are not interested in preserving pure-blood traditions. You have spent the last month or more in what amounts to little more than a sulk and it is unbecoming."
"Every day for the past three years!" Terry said hotly.
"What was it today?"
"We do so appreciate your patronage, sir," Filch said, bowing slightly. Harry's gaze flickered around the entry hall, taking in the peeling wallpaper and the badly-constructed furnishings. The effect was that of affected bourgeois. Harry had never considered himself an elitist but something about this place made him more uneasy even than the street outside.
"I hate you," Harry said, muffled.
~o0O0o~
Draco looked at him in honest confusion. "I am telling you a story. Perhaps you are right and it would be a story better told once we are truly alone."
Malfoy half laughed, half-sneered. "You interrupt an evening with my friends…"
"There was always scope for fear," Harry sighed, "so long as anything I love remained behind. But I never believed you'd… Draco, please look at me."
The distance was insufficient for him to be able to finish his mind's feverish speculations: he was permitted to walk under his own power into the stone room at the end of the corridor, considerably cleaner than any he had walked through to arrive at this point. As the door closed behind him he looked into the one face he had been so desperate to see.
"Coming, sir?" Kirke asked, his voice neutral but a twist of something Harry couldn't identify to his face.
"Acheron and Lethe, Potter,
"What?"
Ginny, Morag and the children were on the uppermost floors, while Sirius and Harry were on the second. Harry considered going up to look at his children to banish this strangeness but found himself instead descending the stairs, heading for the drawing room.
o0O0o
Harry smiled as best he was able; he remembered being hopeful of young love but that innocence seemed very far behind him. "That is marvellous, of course. But-- If I could give you one piece of advice, Teddy –"
Ginny turned her head slightly to look into the room. Harry looked at the familiar curves of her face in profile. Strange, he had never thought of how he would be without her and yet this sudden question – which he must concede she was well within her rights to contemplate – had his head in a spin.
Draco deflated at that, and sank into the nearest cream silk couch. “Who does he think he is?”
Malfoy did not speak again until they were at the Potter's townhouse and Harry was stepping from the carriage. Able at least to appear composed once more, Harry looked back to Malfoy and asked, "You will send for me?"
"Do you love your wife still?"
Ginny spent a moment after admiring herself in the looking glass before placing a delicate kiss on Harry’s mouth. "I am ready. Let them come and see us." Ginny sighed, resting her head against Harry's shoulder. "Let them gawp at little Lily. You know, there are perhaps ten people I will be happy to see tonight? Sometimes I do wish that you were not to be Lord Black."
“So,” Draco acknowledged.
That one struck a nerve. What did Malfoy intend to imply?
“And you think now he might proceed with his plan in any case?”
After watching the Pride of Portree positively smash the Holyhead Harpies, Ginny was disappointed by her team's loss but excited to have been to her first match in several years. Harry had shaken off most of the unease of Lucius' words and was now listening to his wife recount some of the highlights of the match as though he hadn't been there.
"Living like a bachelor again?" Sirius smiled, sitting back on the couch.
Harry rose. “I have complete faith in Hermione in all things.”
And there it was, Harry's guilt, a yawning chasm waiting to swallow him. His wife had nearly died and all he could do was resent her for being other than she had been.
~o0O0o~
Charlie snorted. “Yes, I worked out that there was something you wanted to say.” He folded his arms and Draco was distracted for a moment by the delicious bulge of his upper arms.
"Harry," Draco called, more concerned with reaching him than the fact that his hand still bled where he had cut off his finger, more concerned with knowing he was alive than anything else in the world.
At length, Harry’s breathing and heart rate returned to normal. Draco kept petting him, pressing his body close until Harry looked him straight in the face and said, “Never suggest anything like this ever again.”
Teddy blushed a little more. Harry looked around quickly; the others were still occupied so perhaps he could get away with asking the other question he so needed an answer to.
Harry flinched away from the sight, berating himself. Men always swim naked and usually in groups – what was the matter with him? "You're in the stream, Teddy," he said, but his voice didn't sound like him and he couldn't quite breathe.
be here I fail to see what he could tell you that would say more than that memory,” Lucius went on. “You saw with your own eyes the way Mr Potter pursued him and how my son was forced to say no to a man known for a volatile temper.”
to overcome this madness. He had to.
Sirius waved Harry's thanks away. "What else would I do with my money but take care of family?"
"People are human," Harry said quietly. "Even I, though the world has scarce allowed me to be so. Sometimes our feelings get the better of us, sometimes decisions do not seem so black and white as you would paint them."
Harry had taken about as much of this as he was prepared to. “
There was something in the way he said that which compelled Harry to look at him hard. He could see nothing in Lucius's face but a sort of blandly amused blankness. The mask was hard to penetrate.
Malfoy flinched away as though Harry had tried to strike him. "Merlin's beard, you really are here." He looked a little nauseous at the realisation, and took a step back from Harry. "Why?"
“Mr Simpson, do you recognise the man sitting there?” Lucius pointed at Harry.
Harry stood for a moment, absorbing Sirius' remarks.
“That’s not my title, Fawley,” Harry reminded him. He gave Padfoot’s head one last gently pat and pulled his hands back through the bars. “But thank you. And thank you, Ron.”
Blaise shook his head at his friend and stood, crossed the room to pour a port and retrieve the cigarette box. “I rather think he thinks of himself as Harry Potter – a man with a great deal to lose. Why on earth did you set your sights on him of all people, Draco?”
Harry was high on new sensation but still he slid his fingers down and back, pushing his index finger back into Draco's body. It slipped inside easily again, so Harry pushed two fingers inside; Draco gasped and arched up into him. Three fingers, the same.
Pansy had actually come over that time so they could read it together and howl. Draco had some of his favourite excerpts memorised. Oh, there were inanities such as,
“Your Sirius, then. You have kept me away from him specifically to avoid such a reaction, is it not so?”
His guards were named Fawley and Smith. Neither of them seemed to know how to talk to him. He’d tried to make conversation before but Fawley was awestruck by the Great War Hero and Smith seemed unable to reconcile the charges with the history he knew.
"I don't care overmuch for your father's approval," Harry said drily.
Thoughts of duty filled his mind again as he stood ready to vote.
“Ron,” Harry said but that was all he could manage.
"Where have you been?" Harry snapped.
Except on this night, Draco turned back to Harry and said very clearly, “I have some contacts who would most likely be very useful. They are men not much younger than Father. I do not think you would like what they would ask me to do in return.”
A touch on his hand startled him; he looked up to see Hermione lacing her fingers through his. “I know, Harry,” she whispered, clutching his hand so tightly he would have marks from her fingertips in his knuckles. “I know you did.”
Harry should have expected that. Draco had at first taught Harry how to take all his length into his mouth, how to bring him pleasure in this way. He had curled his fingers up inside Harry and encouraged Harry to do the same. But then, one night while their pleasure raged between them, Draco raised his head from around Harry's manhood to ask, "Would you let me now show you the true pleasures of Greek love?"
There was, however, one awkward moment at the dinner table when Ginny mentioned Harry's visit to the Bones. Considering the frosty silence which had met word of his going, she was quite nonchalant when she mentioned, "Harry visited the Bones last week and saw Susan there."
When he opened it, it was merely one line.
"There is an entire floor to be had, Harry!" Sirius said at once. "And Remus is only here for the weekend, it's the middle of term don't you know..."
Draco’s letter.”
The effort seemed to drain him; he collapsed back into his chair. There was a glass and an open decanter on the table next to him; Harry realised he had been drinking heavily, presumably to digest the results of his investigation. He’d come to the house at the worst possible time.
Of course he had. Simple and clinical. “I’m almost surprised you don’t do it after each engagement, as a matter of course.”
"How long will it take to brew?" he asked.
“Indeed. So you approached Mr Potter with this letter and that was when he struck you?”
"So do I not belong here?" Harry spat. "I, who lived my youngest years outside this world?"
"Permanently?" Harry didn't know where to look. "I do not know. At least for a while. Her last pregnancy, Lily's birth - she has been under a terrible strain and I, I am hindering her recovery." It was all true, he told himself over and over again as everything he did not say made him feel every word a lie.
. Harry looked at it and wondered if he should write something more, some entreaty or greeting, something more than the bare bones. But he could think of nothing to excite Draco beyond what he had done already and was forced to be content with what he had written.
He had heard nothing from Draco. He still wasn’t sure how that made him feel.
From behind the enormous bustle of her ornate dress, Zabini manoeuvred himself into the room and grinned. "Up early, Potter. Did you think about my invitation?"
Goyle nodded and let himself out.
Ginny was already in her own room on the other side of the suite, which was just as well: he knew not how their next conversation might be.
He remembered school, brilliant days of Quidditch and visits to Hogsmeade and the freedom of his teenage years. Was it really true that his school days were to be the best of his life? He had done his duty in the war despite not being of age. Was the rest of his life to be defined by duty?
"Though a most overdue one in this instance," Sirius chimed in. "I gather you received my message, so why not tell us what you have been doing this past month?"
Draco kissed and licked at Harry's cock and every caress he offered Harry echoed. He played with the hair that grew around it, he slipped a hand above to feel the weight of the testes, he caressed buttocks and slipped a finger along the crack.
Terry looked at the small blue pyramid in Draco's hand with no recognition.
"I did not think you enjoyed the tragedies," Ginny opined, her tone a little peevish. She shifted in her bed and Harry reached for her hand again.
“Ginny,” he said, voice smooth. Until that very moment, Harry would not have been certain that Draco even remembered his wife’s name.
The mask had not dropped a fraction. Harry had never been good at maintaining a blank expression but he endeavoured to do so now. "Indeed, we met at the Boneses, I believe – I remember because it was around the time our daughter came."
stepped into the corridor.
Four days Harry remained in the suite that had been his home with Draco – for that was precisely how he had thought of it and there was no sense lying to himself now. Draco was not coming back, not even to collect his things. Or perhaps he would only after he was quite certain that Harry was no longer in residence.
The thought of Malfoy now brought a flush to Harry's skin. All he could see was that pink fleshy tongue flicking over the boy's plump lips, teasing and wanton, slick with saliva. He turned away from it, rising from bed and with a
Slowly he withdrew his finger and sat up, only to have Draco reach for his shoulder, pulling him on top of Draco's body.
"Manners, my son," Kore said, looking Harry up and down with frank assessment.
"Will you be here very much longer, Potter?" Zabini was asking.
Draco was watching Harry's face keenly.
"Do you know," he said now, "I think if I ever saw Draco again I would kill him."
“You’re leaving?” Draco all but screamed.
“Visiting for a few weeks, but who knows what he could accomplish in that time,” said Pansy. “He does have a certain
"Lord Malfoy trying to intimidate you, Harry?"
Draco blinked in terrified awe. "Heavens, that's specific. Given that some thought, have you?"
Harry reached out and took Sirius' hands in his.  "But you survived."
There was a momentary pause before the courtroom descended into uproar. Lucius was roaring about an attempt to defile even his very son, the crowd, somehow no longer silenced, was shouting
“Did he occupy the rooms alone?”
Draco cried out, of course, he couldn’t help it. His body was burning with sensation: Potter inside him, the heat and the strength of him as he fucked into Draco and pulled back, thrusting again and again, sending Draco higher and higher. Draco was dizzy, could barely breathe. Potter pushed forward from standing until he was almost flat on top of Draco, pushing his knees to his shoulders. Draco wasn’t quite that flexible and it hurt a little but that just made it better, somehow, more intense. Potter was gasping and staring right at Draco, and Draco, usually so detached, could do nothing but lie there. He couldn’t make his hands reach for Harry, all he could manage was to catch his own knees and keep them down, hold himself open for Potter to fuck them both out of their minds.
"The seal indicates that this is from your
"Potter wouldn't like it if I hurt you," he whispered to her, to remind himself.
Ginny smiled. "Thank you, Harry. Let us begin anew…"
Harry wondered if there had ever been anyone for Sirius, perhaps someone who'd been lost in the war. It was the one subject they never spoke of.
Harry swallowed his brandy. Was it his fourth or fifth? He had lost count.
Lucius frowned but it seemed as though he would accept the gentle rebuke, until Draco muttered, "It would make it so much easier to disinherit me if you'd had that spare."
At once Dobby disappeared and a moment later, Sirius appeared, half-dressed with his smoking jacket thrown over his nightclothes.
"Forgive my being late, Sirius," Harry said, breathless. His best attempts at hurrying had been thwarted by Draco, who had seemed determined that if Harry was indeed to visit the Ministry, he should only do so thoroughly dishevelled, covered in marks beneath his robes.
"Thank you, no," Harry said, grimacing. "I have been sitting for the better part of two days."
But Katie Bell had been around and done things Ginny Weasley hadn’t even known about until Blaise. She was also too savvy to get it in the papers, but the chat around the pub was telling: Harry Potter? Lives up to the hype.
"Your godson," Malfoy repeated, his tone mocking the very concept. "Yes, your godson and ten years younger than you and yet you look at him as though you'd die for a chance to tear his very clothes from his body!"
he asked himself,
“Wrackspurts,” Luna Scamander said with authority.
"Very shortly," Harry agreed. "But it would be a pleasure to receive you no matter the circumstances."
To that, Draco could say nothing.
Draco gulped and gasped, too deep under pleasure's spell to make any kind of reply.
April rolled into May and with it loomed the commemorative ceremony for the end of the War. Harry had been avoiding society for weeks, but there was no avoiding this. The Minister for Magic had personally requested his presence.
By eleven o'clock, Harry was still alone. He swallowed his third glass of brandy and stubbed out his sixth cigarette. Obviously Draco had found something better to do. Or perhaps he had never intended to come at all. Perhaps all this had just been a joke at Harry's expense. At that thought his fingers tightened on the glass in his hand and without thinking, he threw it into the fireplace, pleased by the sound of the glass breaking.
"I want you," the memory of him said to the gasps of those assembled in the court. Harry let his eyes close so he couldn’t see his own face, so full of emotion, or Draco’s tensed body, the lines of which could be terribly misconstrued.
“I was at the Manor for dinner last night,” Draco said, dimly recalling. Brandy with Father and then off for drinks with… Malcolm Baddock? Hard to imagine that boy getting him into this state.
Draco snorted. “In that unlikely event, fuck me brutally in celebration.”
The Resurrection Stone, turned over to summon Harry's shade.
"Perhaps that is part of what makes him restless," Sirius said with a careless shrug, but it was obviously forced.
Kreacher bowed again; like the muttering it was a habit they had never quite managed to break him of. "Yes, Master Potter."
Harry whirled; there at the open door, Draco stood at last. He was sheathed like a dagger in black: black slender cut trousers, a double-breasted black waistcoat with silver buttons, and a black cravat accented by his white shirt. The outfit was far from colourless, however, as his robe and cloak were in the brightest Vienna brocade Harry had ever seen, gold and red and bronze forming elaborate patterns around Draco's trim body.
Lady Malfoy was rather lovely when she stopped scowling, and to see her now, it was easy to forget that she had ever been other than perfectly cordial. She smiled at him and kissed Draco's cheek until some of the tension bled out of him.
Harry nodded. “Almost entirely.”
Smith was a Hit Wizard; highly trained and competent. But Hermione had been in the war. He eyed her and raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. “I intended no disrespect.”
“I would certainly not wish you to bear such costs on my account,” Harry said, angry with himself, with Kirke, with everything and everyone.
And he had lost so much to Draco, who had given him such passion and brought him to ruination.
Harry scowled. “Are you here to collect Draco’s things?”
"This isn't how it's supposed to be," Harry said.
They had somehow grown closer over the course of their fight. Harry found himself snarling those words directly into Malfoy's face, his hands clenched into fists by his side. Malfoy was barely inches away, his face flushed, his eyes furious and alive.
In the small space of the carriage, Harry found himself uncertain again. Malfoy sprawled on the seat opposite him with a smirk playing around his mouth. He seemed disinclined to offer conversation and so Harry spent the journey alternating between staring at him and desperately fidgeting with his hands to keep himself from doing something unpardonable. His skin crawled with the tension and he closed his eyes a moment and thought about raising his wand and Apparating back to Ginny.
"Yes," Harry said, looking into her dear face and thinking of the love he did not have and the many he did.
living with the scars of Azkaban too deep. I had struggled and avoided but it was only until there was you, a purpose, that I really worked with the healers to overcome it. You spent years with those Muggles monsters because of me, because of my choices. Remus and Tonks lived in a barely stable marriage for years. Arguably it is my fault your parents died.”
“But the least you could do is bother to remember that I’m one of them,” Potter went on, aggrieved.
Weakness: Excessive vanity
“He was polite and tidy. Dressed a little oddly, obviously an eccentric like you gentlemen here, but never caused trouble.”
Draco pushed his face into the caress. "Mm, and our own world is most satisfactory indeed."
"Remus? He is a school master now!" Sirius said, shaking his head in disbelief. "Gone back to Hogwarts of all places!"
~o0O0o~
"This is not about my position!" Harry cried. "Ginny, I know you need time but I… I feel so…"
Draco acknowledged it with a forced shrug of his shoulders. "You come and go and I try not to grudge it," he said. "I know that for you it is me, only me. But it is a lonely life nonetheless, living a lie. Blaise knows about you though he never voices it. He is the only one but if I were to speak to him of love he simply would not understand. Who else is there? Nott I could not trust. I have to lie to all others I know about the very nature of who I am. I have long lunches with a Pureblood girl whom my mother dreams I will wed. I smile and flatter and lead her to believe I may love her when the truth is that her body repels me."
Harry pulled back and Draco moaned at the loss, his fingers twitching as if to pull his head back down.
Harry sat on the edge of the bed. "Would you like your present? It's only small, it's not…"
Draco tried to smile again but there was something uncertain in it. "I asked you before if you knew what you were getting into."
Ernie was talking. “Indeed! I confess I did rather wonder what you were doing with all your time in town.”
“And who lands in the papers more often than I do? Who could wear your clothes more often and drop your name into more interviews than I?”
Malfoy was lounging in his chair in a most louche manner, laughing at something one of his companions had said. Harry recognised neither of them: one was a stringy looking man with a strangely rabbit-like appearance, the other was an attractive man with dark skin and a haughty expression. Harry looked away from their box almost at once but he could not resist sneaking looks throughout the interval or indeed during the second half of the performance.
~o0o~
Ginny raised an eyebrow. "I am sorry that the quiet life is so irksome."
When Harry came back to himself, he was lying on his side, his face buried in Draco's neck. Their legs were tangled together, their ejaculate cooling and sticking uncomfortably to Harry's skin. But he would not move for worlds, not as long as Draco was holding him, pressing gentle touches to the nape of his neck, the curve of his ear, the knobs of his spine. He wondered when he had removed his glasses. It didn't seem important.
Gabrielle bit her lip, considering. “Not if I start today. Come with me, we will take your measurements. And then we will go to Gringotts, non?” Her eyes glittered.
He was handing Malfoy all the power and knew it but didn't know what else he could do. There was no way to fight this, no way he could do other than succumb. He was managing not to touch Malfoy right this instant; that in itself felt like a victory as important as any of the last war.
"Why don't I invite Ron and Hermione as well?" Ginny asked, her eyes still on him. "I know you miss my brother's company."
“Everything he said is circumstantial,” she whispered back.
But Lucius was holding out his card and it would be the cut direct to refuse it before all these assembled. Harry considered it anyway, but resigned himself and took it even as he said, “I am sure I could reach you, should I find the need.”
"I mean it," Harry repeated, pulling Draco back down to kiss him again. "I do."
“The devil take it all!” he snapped.
Hermione snorted in a most unladylike fashion. "There's
spreading through him. It was enough to know that it was there, and it was dangerous, and Sirius was right.
Draco had found his wand and with a quick, "
Kirke moaned and collapsed to his knees. He said something Harry could not make out.
“I disagree, Lord Malfoy,” Harry said flatly.
"I was caught in conversation," Harry said.
"You can keep yourself from falling?" he asked. At Harry's jerky nod, he smiled and brought his little finger to his mouth, fellating it as surely as he had Harry's cock. Then his mouth was back on Harry's shaft and his hand was around Harry's testicles again. Harry gave himself over to the pleasure of it, the wet heat of Draco's mouth, the persistence of his nimble fingers. Draco's hand slid further back and then that wet finger was teasing at Harry's entrance, sliding around it and playing with it. Harry gasped and almost wanted to say no, not that, but the pleasure was all too intense. The finger slipped inside. Harry groaned. His senses were overloaded; there was ecstasy to be found in the way Draco worked his body, agony in the tension of his arms keeping him in position.
“Before you start, Potter,” Draco said, but he didn’t get any further before Potter had caught the front of his robes and hauled him into a kiss.
He sat down and covered Draco’s hand with his own. “Are you anxious about us being apart?” For they had barely parted for moments in days.
It was only after another hour of such greetings that Harry was able to snatch a few moments alone, with the excuse of making sure Morag, the nanny, got the children back to Grimmauld Place before the evening's festivities really began. He took the four of them to the Apparition point, kissed the boys and Lily gently, all three of them very nearly asleep, and watched them Disapparate.
“Can you describe the nature of these visitors?”
Harry remembered Lucius dispassionately slapping Draco across the face and felt his own face burn. Lucius had tried every way he knew to grind Draco down, but he was still standing. Damaged and hurting, certainly, but not broken. Harry remembered his smile, his real smile of joy. The deliberately seductive curve of his shoulder and the honest way he shivered when Harry ran nails over his throat just so. His sobs and strops and favourite colours. His flush when jealous and the flash of disbelief in his eyes when he had first read Harry’s love token:
Now that he was no longer fighting himself, he had thought he would be able to meet Malfoy without fear. He had confronted the dark heart within himself and believed it would cease to have power over him.
Pansy shrugged. “Neville knows I tell you everything he tells me, and I didn’t have time to extort it out of him with sex. He’s still passed out dead drunk at the moment,” she said with a sniff.
For those keeping track, this is the last of the previously-posted chapters. It's all new material from here on out!
"Master Sirius is having company," Kreacher said, pushing the door wider. "Is the same company as always. My mistress, my poor mistress, it would break her heart it would, it would."
Harry bit his lip. His erection was still painfully in need of attention. He was desperate to touch Malfoy everywhere, desperate for this to never end. Once again he felt the presence of a terrible danger but he could not heed it – he desired too fiercely.
"You might at least say goodbye to the boy who sucked your plug-tail," Malfoy remarked as they stepped back out into the street.
"Do you resent that?"
“We could go away together.”
Teddy looked at him then, his face very near. Harry pulled his hand away, pretending that he had not felt a sudden rush of heat.
Sirius peered at him, his quiet demeanour not fooling his godfather at all. “What about you?”
"Yes?" Draco prompted when he did not continue.
“Wait,” Potter said, pushing Draco back just slightly. Draco stared at him in a haze, taking in the look on Potter’s face. Pupils huge, mouth bruised- Draco wanted him so badly. Draco leaned to kiss him but Potter said again, “Wait.”
“If you like. But you must…”
Marble did not come back that night. Harry imagined Draco reading it. Maybe he needed time to think. Maybe he had no interest in Harry any more, had already moved on. Harry had no way of knowing.
"Right," Draco murmured into Harry's mouth, and then there were no words for a while as coats and waistcoats were removed. Harry's fingers longed to find Draco's skin but there was still not enough time to fully enjoy removing Draco's clothes.
“Oh,” Potter said, and then he smiled again, rather shyly. “Well, that’s ok then. I was just a little afraid you would have been put off by all that stuff they write in the papers, you know.”
As if responding to his thoughts, Draco shifted his head. "Oh, Potter," he said again. "
"You fear your feelings are genuine?" Hermione said, her voice barely a whisper.
James Potter's left tibia, retrieved from a grave at Godric's Hollow. Lucius Malfoy's blood, drawn from his arm against his will. Draco's flesh. Draco's left ring finger, willing given. The finger on which he would have worn a wedding ring, the finger which was Harry's by right and desire.
, the gesture said most clearly.
Harry could barely breathe.
Harry glanced over to the Malfoys a few times more. He had known Sirius all his life; the man had virtually no contact with any of his family. Harry had met his cousin Andromeda and her husband on several occasions as a young boy but AFTER Ted’s death, his attention had all been for little Teddy. It seemed incredible now to think that there was a great swathe of Sirius' family of whom he knew next to nothing.
“Draco Malfoy,” he said, ready to burst into an entirely fabricated account of why it was urgent and why Potter had to see him at once.
Harry frowned. He was stepping forward even before Kreacher had formally announced his guest. "Kreacher, that will be all. Goyle, what are you doing here?"
Draco knew he wanted Potter, he’d always known, but he hadn’t expected it to be like this. He was always just a little detached during sex, some part of him observing, noting reactions, determining how best to please. But Potter, while not doing anything special exactly, somehow had the effect of blowing all of this out of the water. Draco could only manage a moment of awareness before his mind was reduced to thinking
He poured himself another cup.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Quite.”
"Hermione, I would not speak ill of a lady," Harry said, taking refuge in formality even as a part of him longed to unburden his soul of the terrible secret. "Not without proof and I fear…" He hadn't meant to say so much. He wiped his mouth.
“Try again,” she said without even blinking.
“What are you doing?”
The disdain with which Blaise said the last made Harry stiffen. He was tired and had been sorting his belongings by hand in order to help himself accept the transition away from the life he and Draco had shared these past months. “I suppose I am.”
Harry digested this for a moment. “I’m going to call for some coffee.”
Before Harry could ask, Lucius had turned and Disapparated with a
Draco was so broken though. All his fire was out. Harry knew that feeling, knew it well. He sometimes felt as though the war had drained the very best parts of him away leaving only a shell who still felt sporadic violent impulses, tightly controlled, and an urge to do good but whose spirit had never really recovered.
Sirius kept an owl named Marble, and it was to him Harry took his letter. I have been a fool, he had written, but the truth was he was still a fool. He could not control fate, or the law, or Lucius Malfoy, or even, apparently, himself.
Draco reared up at once to bite at the lips; there was a soft click in Harry's new throat as he gasped, the same reaction Draco had always been able to elicit. Desire flooded Draco and he reached to touch all of Harry's new flesh, colder than he remembered but pliant all the same. He had to screw up his eyes against the urge to cry, overwhelmed with the joy and the ecstasy replacing the loss and the silence.
The Minister wishing to speak with him in the midst of all this was hardly a positive sign.
The door opened, and Draco and Harry stepped into an antechamber. The burly man behind the door promptly closed it behind them.
Diggory sighed deeply. “I am inclined to agree, Mrs Weasley. Lucius, this story is all rather fantastic and there has been no evidence of any kind put forward beyond contradictory testimony. From the list you submitted, I know you have no other witnesses to call. The evidence is simply not strong enough.”
If Sirius had been enraged before he was now incandescent. “What did you say?”
"There weren't many left able to teach," Sirius said. He was jovial so often that on the rare occasions when he was serious, it sent shivers down Harry's spine. "Most of the Aurors dead, almost all of the Order dead. He is chained up like an animal at the full moon, but he is useful to them so they let him be."
Draco shrugged but the carelessness seemed forced. "You are my intimate friend."
~o0o~
“If Draco
Draco had celebrated by levitating Harry into the air and peeling his clothes from his body; Harry had laughed and let him and Draco had touched him everywhere, mastering him at last and feeling less triumph than he had imagined, more affection, more delight.
Hermione turned to him, startled. “Harry, of course I am. I might not agree with everything you’ve done and I might think some of this trouble is your own fault but that doesn’t mean I won’t do everything I can to help you.”
"Unnatural," Draco said scornfully. "Perversion, they say. Perversion is all that's worth living for."
Sirius cleared his throat and said, "Will you not come and look at your grandchildren, Molly?"
Sirius' back immediately went rigid and Harry turned to look at the people who had elicited such a reaction. His view was obscured by the people between him and the entryway, but he could see Lord Malfoy clearly enough – a tall, older man with unfashionably long hair and extremely fashionable and expensive robes. His wife was also blonde and wore pale blue; Harry could not see the third member of the party from where he stood.
“Many of you would think I chose the wrong person to love. I certainly chose a difficult person. An inconvenient person. But it was real.” This last he directed to Lucius again. “So yes, you can throw me in Azkaban. You can make sure I never see him again. But you cannot stop him from loving me – and he does. We both know he does. Or else you wouldn’t hate me so much.”
In the gloom, Harry could not tell if Kirke’s complexion changed at all, but the boy did take a step back. “Now, Mr Potter, I…”
Draco had written,
"Mr Potter," Draco said with a smirk when Harry found him. He was sitting by the entrance to the pump room reading the Quidditch scores and performing some rather complicated Arithmancy; Harry barely noticed anything save the shapes he made, slender fingers holding the top of his cane, lean limbs tucked beneath the table in front of him. He was wearing purple today and Harry longed to pull his cravat from about his neck to expose his throat.
"You should think about what you're doing," he said to Draco, which Draco thought was funny because Weasley had never seemed to find Draco capable of sound moral judgement before.
On entering the memory, Harry found himself in a room he did not know, all striped wallpaper and cream furnishings. Blaise was reading, sipping a brandy; presumably this was his apartment. The book was titled
Zabini smiled almost benevolently. "It was I who suggested he might like to join us this evening."
"They are my wife's favourite team," Harry told him. Perhaps some little present for Ginny would help resurrect the easing in her temper that Ron and Hermione's visit had seen.
He won the vote.
Perhaps the Dark Lord's mistake had been in his scattershot approach. He wanted immortality, blood purity, power, servants. Draco wanted only Harry forever and always.
Harry reached out and took it. “Thank you,” he said softly, hating that Sirius had had to think of how to care for him because he was too weak to do it himself.
Sirius quirked a smile at Harry. "Ostentatious, don't you think?"
The invisibility cloak was the easiest: Draco inherited it when Harry died. In the sense that he knew where it was and he knew how to get it.
Victoire was gazing straight at Teddy, the smile on her face confident but tender.
“Charlie?”
Harry knew he should have recognised it but his mind was working more slowly than usual.
“You’re mine,” he near-growled and as he pulled out and slammed back in, Harry could only gasp and promise that yes, yes he was. Yes for the rest of time.
Terry was behind the counter as always, all dark hair and glasses and lean lines. Draco reflected how narcissistic his attraction to Potter must be. "Terry," he said quietly.
So Harry dressed himself quickly and Apparated to the suite.
Draco gave an incoherent snarl, and reached for the cloak he had just discarded. "I tell you no such thing," he snapped. "I tell you only that you ask if you are mine and then you prove that you are not."
"Remus has always been very kind," Harry agreed. "To Sirius and I both. But Teddy is his priority, naturally."
“Any time, mate,” Ron said, giving him a soft smile. He nodded at Fawley, flicked his gaze over the still-snoring Smith and quietly retreated down the corridor.
~o0O0o~
Harry looked at Hermione, wondering how much of his feelings were showing in his eyes. “Did they tell you the charge?”
“And Gabrielle Delacour.”
Once Malfoy had Harry's upper half naked at last he slid his hands over Harry's shoulders, down his back. Harry moved closer, pressing the length of his body against Malfoy's for the first time.
They lay there a while, Draco all but naked, Harry still fully clothed but everything askew.
He turned his attention back to the stage at once, focusing on Elvira's pleas with Don Giovanni, a man who did not deserve such devotion. He risked one glance back over at Malfoy a minute or so later – Malfoy was no longer even facing the stage but rather blatantly staring back at him. Harry forced his eyes back to the performance and did not look again.
Now, Harry looked at him. He was still beautiful, in plum purple robes today. His nearness still sent white hot sparks through Harry's blood. But the shame and the self-loathing, the way he had felt so heartsick after their last encounter made it easy to say, "My wife needed me."
Ginny frowned at him from across the room. "Are you quite well? You have been very quiet these last few weeks."
Harry had been half-expecting, half-dreading this. But it was inevitable.
He let that hang for a moment.
Ron and Harry both made noises of objection in their throats while Ginny laughed.
Harry stood, staring at the faces. He thought he already knew, from the way some people were smiling viciously while the majority would not meet his eyes.
Ginny held up her hand to quell him. "I cannot plan for the future until the sentence is passed. I cannot however see how we could possibly resume our married life as it was before."
Naturally, the first person Harry had seen was the last person in the world he wanted to see. Malfoy had grabbed his arm, dragged him into a side chamber and glared at him.
"No, indeed," Harry said at once, grateful for the excuse. "You have a visitor already."
“Yessir.”
"Meaning yes." Harry could hardly be surprised if Draco had learned some of his tells in his turn. Draco examined his cuff at length and Harry had to fight the urge to say something that would no doubt come out all wrong.
"What care I for Weasley's remembrance?" Draco snapped.
It was inevitable that this was the moment when his eyes should land on Malfoy. He must have spoken briefly with Sirius, or perhaps even Ginny. Harry's stomach turned to ice.
“Yessir, he was a long-term guest at the hotel at which I am employed.”
“Don’t,” Harry said gently. “Don’t. You would never see your mother again either.” Draco frowned, ready to disagree. “You couldn’t. What if she did come to see you and your father followed her? Or hurt her to get to you?”
Malfoy had not looked away.
“I promise,” she said, her voice strangled; she had given in to her own tears, then. He wished he could comfort her again.
~o0o~
Harry looked at the boys and looked back at Malfoy. His stomach lurched. "You brought me to a bawd-house? You brought me to invert whores?" He had
“It means they are prepared to make some exceptions for you, which we can definitely use to advantage,” she explained to Harry on one of their regular meetings. Harry would be taken from his cell to another, where he spoke with Hermione across a table. His cell was often in disarray when he returned having been either searched or cleaned, he wasn’t sure which.
"Ah," Draco sighed. "Jealousy."
"Draco," Harry gasped and was dually rewarded as Draco's mouth took him in completely and his finger slid all the way inside. Harry climaxed at once with a sharp cry, and his arms gave out. He would have crashed to the floor but Draco held him, withdrawing his finger from Harry's back passage and rearranging Harry's body on the couch.
Harry sighed. "Which is precisely why I avoid town when I can. I infinitely prefer a quiet life."
Harry felt something within him squirm. He looked back at Malfoy to find Malfoy staring at him, an expression on his face that Harry could not identify. Instinctively, his arm went around Ginny and Malfoy's face darkened before he turned away.
Draco's fingers stilled. He dropped his hands and leaned forward onto the dressing table, gripping the table's edge tightly. "You are a half-blood," Draco said quietly. "This world is as much yours as is the other, and you know that. But consider your friend, the one who married Weasley."
Ginny looked him straight in the eye. "You must never, ever see Draco Malfoy again."
Harry had never felt uncomfortable with Ron and Hermione before in his life; that dinner marked the first and, he hoped, the only time. Hermione had chattered away, encouraging Ron to regale Harry with stories of life as an Auror and Harry had hoped that Ron would chalk up his inability to concentrate to exhaustion from too much socialising in London.
"I do," Draco said. "I know you will feel strangely about it. But Potter, I feel my skin will flay itself from my flesh and I know but one way to solve it."
"Oh?"
The only place Harry knew of where Draco’s demand could be met was the bawd-house he’d been taken to that first night, so long ago. He didn’t even know where it was, precisely and was reluctant to ask Draco since this was something he had asked Harry to do for him. He had thought for a few minutes before sending out his stag Patronus to find Goyle and instruct him to collect them from the Italian Gardens at Hyde Park. He did not know how much Goyle knew about Draco’s living situation and would rather not run the risk of having anyone from the wizarding world find them out.
“Last night, you asked me to fuck you,” Potter said, brushing Draco’s hair from his eyes. “Is that what you want now?”
"Did you miss me a great deal when you were away?"
"All right," Harry said at last.
“Poor Ginny. I presume she knows none of this?”
“I object!” Hermione said at once. “Mr Filch offered nothing of substance before and Mr Kirke’s testimony is clearly motivated by revenge against Harry… that is, the accused, for standing up to an attempt at blackmail!”
“Order!” Diggory snarled, the gavel hitting the bench with considerable force. “Mrs Weasley, I take your point but given the nature of what we have seen, you cannot expect me to simply throw the matter out.” He sighed, looking suddenly very old. “Does the accused wish to speak in his own defence? Perhaps addressing this memory?”
"You blame me still I think," Draco said. "For disrupting your marriage. For turning you into a mandrake, as though it was not something within you." Draco's face was pinched, unhappy, the way it always was when he displayed something he was uncomfortable with the world seeing. "You love me, yes, but would you have chosen to?"
His business with the goblins was concluded before lunchtime and when he left the bank he was disconcerted to find Remus waiting for him.
SO I ACCIDENTALLY POSTED THE WRONG CHAPTER HERE FIRST TIME I'M SO SORRY
Harry placed his knife and fork neatly back down and touched his cloth napkin to the corners of his mouth. "Thank you, Kreacher," he said without looking around. "That's all for this evening."
For a long moment they lay there together in the peace that follows intense pleasure.
Draco shook his head. "Nowhere to brew them. Blaise is still in the north, but Nott will be in town."
Harry had been present for James’s first steps and Al’s first words. He had missed so much time with his daughter already – he could only hope he would be granted the time to make it up.
Malfoy smirked. "So then you must be here because…?"
~o0o~
Draco kept looking at him as he licked the hand Harry was not holding and reached to stroke himself to completion as Harry watched, dumb. It took him mere moments and then his body was spasming and arching, clasping at Harry's who could hardly bear the new onslaught of sensation and cried out again with the shock of renewed pleasure on his over-sensitised flesh.
Harry clamped his hand over his mouth, the full horror of what he was seeing hitting him all at once.
In the morning, Harry lay holding Draco for a long while before hunger at last demanded that they rise for the day. Both needed to bathe and while Draco's suggestion that they did so together tempted Harry greatly, he demurred, saying that was a pleasure best savoured when they would have time to enjoy it fully.
He wanted everything all at once, couldn’t separate it all out. Wanted Potter to touch him everywhere. Sounds were pouring out of his mouth, moans and grunts that would have embarrassed him, but they were evoking a whine from Potter, who gasped and grabbed Draco’s head, pulling their mouth back into alignment until he could kiss him utterly insensate.
Harry’s hand tightened on his wand. He could curse Lucius again, of course he could, but what would it change beyond making his opponent even more determined to destroy him? “You have said quite enough, sir. I must ask you now to leave.”
It reminded Harry of Ginny, something in the tone of it which on the surface seemed mild but beneath held a kind of accusation.
Sirius kept eye contact with him as he drained his glass one final time. “In that case, I rather think we had get another bottle after all.”
Ginny laughed. "Indeed, I feel much more at peace. Oh – Mother intends to visit us this week."
"What is wrong?" he asked.
“I object, on the basis that this memory is not the best evidence – testimony would be preferable in this instance.”
Because Harry knew now how he felt. If Lucius was going to win anyway  then maybe, just maybe Harry could have what he wanted.
Teddy shifted uncomfortably. Harry could have kicked himself: at this point the
Harry did not want to think of Draco taking a wife. Instead he asked, "Never at all?"
This was it, then. A numbers game. If Harry voted with Lucius’s cabal, the bill would continue through the house. Who knew if it would pass? The Wizengamot was deeply divided on a number of issues. But if Harry did not vote with his conscience, he would have helped a law he found deeply disturbing overcome its first hurdle.
"You know a lot about it," Harry observed.
"How could I miss the memorial?" Remus said. He was dressed in his habitually shabby robes, his money all going on things for Teddy despite Sirius' best efforts at looking after them both. His face looked thin and tired as always though his eyes were warm, and when Harry shook his hand, it was with real affection. "Your speech went well, I thought," Remus said. Harry grimaced. "Yes, I know you hate having to give them," Remus commiserated, "but you came across very well. I thought you should know."
Padfoot whined and tugged at the lead Ron had on him, presumably for show.
"Master Draco sent me," Goyle said as Kreacher muttered his way back to the kitchens. "I’ve got your owl, just let him go a minute ago. He says not to send him owls, it draws too much attention."
Lord Draco smirked again and Harry found himself distracted from his thoughts by watching those lips curve into different shapes. He shook his head to clear it, perturbed by his abstraction.
"Yes?"
Draco had been preparing for this mission for several years of his life.
“No, indeed,” Sirius agreed. “The Malfoys of the past have been exacting, intelligent and quite ruthless. Draco by all accounts is a spoiled child who likes to pull the wings off flies.”
“Mr Simpson, do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?”
Sirius slapped him on the back a little awkwardly. "Good. Good. Now," he cleared his throat. "Shall we to the Burrow?"
He would return his life to the way it had been. He could do it. He
"I've been Siriused," Harry moaned, sliding down on to the chaise longue and resting his head on Draco's lap. "He has been overindulging himself and insists that I join him."
Sirius barked a laugh.  "He would if it would save someone he did from a living hell."
“I except, on the grounds of the best evidence rule.”
There was no talking, no thinking now. Just Malfoy, his skin, his scent driving Harry to distraction. Their bodies slid into a rhythm together almost unbidden, Malfoy straddling one of Harry's thighs, Harry desperately rocking against him. Malfoy's erection pressed into Harry's leg, the rolling of their hips making Harry groan. He reached up blindly to have Malfoy's mouth back and found it, swiping his tongue over those lips as he had seen Malfoy do to Bertram back in that alley.
Something in Draco’s tone made Harry’s eyes flash to his. “What would you have done?”
Lucius jumped to his feet. “Minister, I beg you to now recall Mr Filch, who can verify Mr Potter’s presence at his… establishment.”
“Yes. You must know we have a history and…”
Draco forced himself to stand, ignoring the ache in his limbs and his arse, the pounding in his head and the rush of blood to his cock.  “I need my wand,” he said hoarsely.
Ginny had been gesturing in her excitement; she pulled her hands back into her lap, staring at Harry. "I haven't thought of for some time," she said, picking at the cloth of her skirt. "There were so many other things to consider."
This was going to be bad.
"So, you shall stay here?" Sirius asked with a quick glance at Remus.
"I could hardly send her no word, Draco!" Harry cried. "I could not have her wondering where I was, trying to find me - I would not worry her. And I wrote to my children, too!"
The confusion lasted only a moment though before Madam Pomfrey appeared at the top of the stairs.
The breath left Harry’s lungs in a whoosh. They had done it. They had actually done it. “May I know the nature of this complaint?” Harry forced out.
He had, however, been consciously avoiding Ron and Hermione, knowing that one or both of them must have choice words for him.
Harry gave a half-laugh. "Oh, it is nothing of consequence. Just that… Well, in town I was desperate for the quiet of home and now I find myself wishing again for the bustle of town."
He was almost at the park gates when he heard his name called. “Mr Potter?”
Draco flinched away. "Let's go, Harry. Mother, I apologise for the scene." And he swept out of the manor, magnificent and free.
“Why?” It came out rather more aggressively than he had intended.
Blaise’s expression changed again, becoming more thoughtful. “You see it with your own eyes but you will not believe it?”
"Good evening Lord Draco," Harry offered as he approached the table; he smiled at Zabini but did not greet him.
Draco’s mouth was flapping a little, he knew it, but as quick as he could usually think up a flippant response, just at that moment nothing was coming to mind.
“But you can’t!” Hermione was saying.
Ginny's gaze kept darting back and forth, from Harry's face to his chafed wrists to his torn clothes.
Harry swallowed hard.
As ruses went, it was far from Hermione's most subtle but Harry was in no position to object. Ron didn't even look at her curiously, he just said, "Of course," and was gone.
Draco. Looking at him wide-eyed. “Harry, I’m sorry. I’m too late and I’m so sorry. Please — don't let them change how you feel about me! Not ever!"
"It's your wife!"
"I know," Harry interjected with some force, conscious of the doorframe and the people beyond it and everything else which might intrude on this moment and make it worse, so much worse. "I have hurt my wife and I will endeavour to desist from doing so but do not tell me that you know how my marriage has been."
“What manner of guest was Mr Potter?”
I have made her unhappy, Harry acknowledged to himself at last. She loves me deeply and in return I have made her very unhappy.
and lots of dull hand-wringing over not wanting to hurt anyone. But then there was the delightful passage about halfway through the article:
"The entrance to the public gallery is over there," Sirius said, pointing, but Harry had already seen a flash of familiar pale blond hair.
"Nor I," Harry responded. The light caught the water in the fountains, turning it brilliant white until it almost hurt Harry's eyes, but the gentle sound pleased him. He shifted to look at Draco, who appeared deep in thought. Reluctant to broach the subject, Harry forced himself to ask, "Do you wish we were spending more time in wizarding society?
Harry hadn't slept in days and it wasn't just because of the hard stone beneath his body or the awkward angle the chains kept him twisted into. His mind was racing, imagining everything that might happen – to him, to his family. The only clamour louder than the fear of what was coming was the self-recrimination over what had already been done. Harry leaned his head back against the stone which dripped with the condensation of dozens of bodies sweating and breathing in the same space, and wondered for the thousandth time if he could have fought harder, if he could have resisted. If he could have refused Draco.
"I know you used to frequent brothels," Harry said softly, "of course I know that. but do you still?"
Worse, Harry remembered a time when Ginny would have met his gaze and rolled her eyes at her mother's effusiveness. They would have grinned together and understood that while Molly was only offering help out of love, they would find their own way to raise their children. Now though Ginny listened, and when Harry tried to catch her eye she frowned at him.
Malfoy stood, and Harry wondered how so great a change could have taken place in this filthy little room.
Harry smiled, and turned to sit down between Draco's legs, his back to Draco's chest.
"Mrs Taylor is a radical?" Harry asked, hiding a smile.
She cleared her throat. “Esteemed members of the Wizengamot,” she said, stalling, “I suggest to you that your duty is simple and clear. This case is in short nothing more than a collection of innuendos and entirely hinges on a memory taken from a witness who never testified – who has made no statement, nor presented himself for questioning. The defendant speaks of love, not indecency. Given his record, which Lord Malfoy dismisses as irrelevant, it behoves us to take him at his word. In making judgement, members of the Wizengamot, you are called to act not upon suspicion or prejudice, but upon an examination of the facts, and on the facts, I respectfully urge that Mr. Potter is entitled to claim from you a verdict of acquittal. Thank you.”
Harry lowered his eyes. "His nephew would have been, as well."
"Then it's settled!" Molly said with a smile. "We'll all go."
He turned to Malfoy sharply. "What-?" But he was unable to finish his question since, as soon as privacy was ensured, Malfoy was on him, body pressed against his, lips frantic against his own. Harry reached out in blind shock as Malfoy eagerly pressed himself closer. Harry would have expected the rattling of the carriage to make maintaining the contact difficult, but Malfoy was on top of him now, pinning him down to the seat. Malfoy kissed the corner of his mouth, his top lip, pinched his lower between sharp teeth. That last made Harry gasp and Malfoy took full advantage of Harry's open mouth, sliding that tongue over Harry's lips, making him moan and open his mouth further. All the disgust at the turn the evening had taken slipped away as Malfoy's tongue licked over Harry's lips each in turn before sliding between them to touch the tip of Harry's own tongue. This was nothing like Kirke, nothing like watching – this was Malfoy wanting Harry back. This was exactly right.
~o0o~
Charlie had a small strawberry-blond child on the end of each arm, obviously the offspring of the eldest Weasley and the elder Delacour. Extremely attractive people, both, and Draco took a moment to study the children’s faces: both likely to grow up pretty. As it should be.
If it were anything else he could talk to someone – Sirius was not always his first choice, but there was Remus or Ron or Hermione. But he had no idea how to tell any of them the lurid things that filled his mind now any more than he could speak to them of the melancholy which gripped him seemingly at random, robbing him of his will to socialise and, in extremis, his appetite and his ease in sleeping.
Harry didn't want that, didn't want that at all. "Would one be enough," said Harry, bracing himself, "if it were mine?"
But what would it do to him to watch Draco fuck himself into oblivion?
~o0o~
"Take care, Potter," Malfoy said and he breezed past Harry and out the door.
Harry twisted his gloves between his fingers. "Recently I have found myself having feelings I fear may not be my own."
"We're not finished our hand of cards," Malfoy said at Harry's quizzical look. "But it won't take long." That last seemed to be directed to Nott who giggled nervously, a strange high-pitched sound.
Bile rose in Harry’s throat. “This isn’t about how much I love you, Draco. This is about what it’s costing everyone else. Percy was the warning shot – Arthur could be next, or Ron—”
Harry had gone to visit Remus for a few days while Ginny visited Luna Lovegood. Teddy had been only sixteen at the time, and had plagued Harry with questions about his life, his family, his choices. Harry found himself telling Teddy all about his long-abandoned dream to be an Auror.
“That was it?” Harry whispered when she was done.
Diagon Alley seemed quite busy this day. Harry had rarely come in spring, and the clean, warm air was a pleasant change from the filth of the Muggle streets. The chatter of shoppers going about their business made Harry smile. He did not spend enough time here.
Harry held Draco for a long time, the two of them kneeling on the dirt floor. Draco sobbed for a while, clinging on to what he had made: Harry so much larger and stronger than him now, by his own design and his self-neglect. Draco had become so thin and he hadn't noticed at all.
"Thank you," Harry said quietly, a little ashamed.
Draco was still trying to catch his breath. His legs wobbled beneath him and Harry took more of his weight.
His spasms wrenched a fierce noise from Potter’s throat in turn and then at last, Potter began to shudder and shake and Draco could feel himself being filled up.
Harry did not know what he had been expecting from the leap within him whenever he had seen Malfoy, the almost painful desire which spiked when Malfoy touched him. He knew that the reality far outstripped any of the naïve fantasies or even that strange dream-like encounter in the carriage. This felt absolutely real and all the more intense.
talk of segregating the sexes at Hogwarts if you can believe such a thing. The Founders were of both sexes, I tell the board, they have placed more than adequate protections in place. Magic is the best chaperone, is it not? This is merely a reaction to the work of so many to ensure equal rights for women. Of course, witches can sit on the Wizengamot but you recall the outcry at the appointment of Artemisia Lufkin to Minister?" Harry had drawn breath to concede that he knew what she meant but before he could she continued, "That was fifty years ago and there has been no other woman in that office since! First it will be segregation, then it will be exclusion and then it will be as if we were Muggles and left to receive no formal educati0n at all!"
“How do you make a living?”
Harry managed a chuckle at that. "I am sorry, Sirius. I fear that for too long I denied the things I wanted and now…"
"Harry," it said, "I have heard that you are in London and yet I have seen neither hide nor hair of you. I wondered why you hadn't replied to my letter - now I know. I assume all is well but I hope you will visit and confirm that."
Once it was lit, Draco regarded him seriously. "How long will you be in London, then, Potter?"
Sirius appeared right behind him, and, having also divested himself of his outer garments, they followed the butler to be announced, waiting at the entrance to a room almost the size of Harry's entire home at Godric's Hollow, with an enormous fireplace at one end, elaborate chandeliers sending rainbows of light down to the marble floors… Harry barely knew where to look at the display of such opulence.
“The storm is coming, Draco, and until we know what form it’s going to take we can’t know how to ride it out.”
All at once Harry felt that loneliness which Draco had described. He didn't know how to help Draco and there was no one he could ask.
When Harry turned it was to see Ron in his best robes standing there with a resigned expression on his face. Hermione was nowhere in sight.
“Filch is done,” Diggory said flatly. “What else have you?”
“Three years ago, I had been employed as a valet but was out of work and as my family is poor, I had few options. I met Mr Filch in a bar by Piccadilly and got into conversation with him. When I mentioned I was unemployed, Mr Filch suggested there were easy ways to make money if one cared to, and that there were men who were happy to pay for a younger man’s company. I understood his meaning.”
Harry’s mind raced as he both wondered what exactly the letter could possibly say precisely as he realised the nature of this visit. He shifted his weight slightly so that his hand was nearer his wand. “Is that so?”
“Your patrons?” Gabrielle repeated, bright blue eyes opening wide. “Forgive me, but what, exactly, is your job?”
A mistake, he saw at once. "Oh, indeed, you know Blaise. And Blaise has designs upon you, I suppose you enjoy knowing that."
“A most lively debate today, did you not think?”
Harry reached for Draco's hand but he pulled it away. "Draco, even aside from how difficult it would be for me to attend such an exclusively pureblood event, I must visit my children at Christmas time."
"Heavens, no," Draco laughed. "He has met a charming Spaniard and finds himself quite occupied in the evenings."
Harry scoffed, “Oh, so I am selfish and unreasonable, is that what—"
“Minister, if—”
The Wizengamot deliberated for four hours. Harry and Hermione ate lunch together in the little room off the court, in silence. The food at least was considerably better than what Harry had been eating in prison, and he made a point of telling her so.
In retrospect Harry should perhaps have anticipated that he would not be the only member of the Wizengamot using the Minister's box that night.
"But you loved her still," Harry said. The sentence sat there, half-statement half-question.
Harry clenched his jaw and reminded himself that it was just one night and then it would be over.
.” Harry slammed his fist against the desk, rising to his feet as he did so. Sparks crackled from his fingers and all at once the courtroom was silent as it seemed to occur to everyone at last who he was and what he could do.
. A reckoning was coming and Harry would have to face it – or he would no longer be Harry Potter but some other creature he would no longer recognise.
They were both sweating: they had been battered about the room, subjected to tickling sensations, static shocks, transfigured animals which darted at them. Draco had seen Harry's eyes dip to his mouth, and licked his lips. It was enough of a distraction. Harry fell to the floor, his wand leaping to Draco's hand.
"While you-" Harry couldn't finish the sentence.
“Harry, think about it.” Earnestness filled Draco’s face. It was a most peculiar expression on him and filled Harry with great unease. “We go away. To the continent, where the laws are considerably less restrictive. We can live together there, openly.”
~o0O0o~
"Teddy is my godson!" Harry snapped. "You are trying to corrupt me! The two situations are hardly comparable!"
“Not long at all,” Harry repeated, thinking of something quite different.
“Yessir. I knocked on the door and entered at the usual time. There was someone in the bed. It was not Mr Potter as the hair was blond not dark. I thought at first it was a young lady but when the person looked at me, I saw it was a young man. Mr Potter then emerged from the water closet and asked me to come back another time.”
"I quite understand. Sirius does not think of these things," she said with a reprimanding look at the man in question.
Malfoy laughed. "Perhaps you
Yes, I know, it's a tease. Enjoy!
Draco had been between his parents and thinking
Even without a wand, it would have been relatively simple to escape had he the will.  Malfoy would want him to think of everything he had lost.
It was the thirty-first of July. Draco waited for the date, relying on its significance to lend power to his actions.
“Will you be gone all day?” he asked at last.
"Precisely," Draco gleamed. He had chosen gold for this evening's robes and it looked very well against the orange and black carpets. He threw himself down as if on a chaise longue and Harry laughed at him.
“But if you were to back him,” Draco said, still a million miles away, “then he might leave us be. I can work on Mother.”
home for me to meet?” The way he said
Their skin made contact for the first time. Lord Draco's fingers were long and cool, long enough to curve around Harry's whole palm so that the tips grazed his wrist. Harry gulped involuntarily, looking at the wicked curve of Malfoy's mouth as he ran his fingers gently over the pulse point, once, twice. Awareness flared, so very strange and yet familiar as though some previously unknown part of himself was awakening. He raised startled green eyes to amused grey, but couldn't quite manage look into such a knowing gaze for long. He dropped his eyes again and stood, content to hold on forever just feeling Malfoy's fingers begin to warm against his, gazing at Malfoy's mouth all the while. Harry licked his lips as his own mouth suddenly went dry; Malfoy's gaze dropped to watch the action and Harry's nerve gave out. He yanked his hand away and took a step back, rattled. That was not how two men touched one another.
"Harry, I love you as though you were my own son," he said at last.  "But I cannot protect you from this.  For this reason," he swallowed hard.  "For this reason I will tell you now what I have never spoken of to a living soul."
“This is most irregular,” Hermione pointed out.
“Yet oddly convenient, Burke,” Diggory replied. “Lord Malfoy are you telling me that you have no way to recall your son?”
Remus smiled at them both before moving away. Harry watched him go, unsure what he was looking for until his eyes fell on Teddy with a group of other Hogwarts students. He was laughing, his face lit up and happy, his hair bright blue. Harry watched him for a moment until Teddy turned, perhaps sensing his gaze. Their eyes locked. Teddy faltered slightly before his smile grew wider, his hand raising in a gesture of greeting. Harry forced himself to smile back before looking away, ignoring the confused feeling in his stomach.
"Look," Draco ordered Harry and he complied, watching Draco part those perfect lips, stretching them around Harry's cock. In this moment he was lovelier and more obscene even than Harry had been able to imagine. His cheeks hollowed as he sucked, his eyes on Harry's own the whole time. His grey eyes were devoid of their usual wicked gleam, instead glazed with desire as though Draco was unable to see Harry despite gazing right at him, as though he were unable to see anything at all.
Which is why when Draco Malfoy returned to his suite that evening, Harry was waiting for him in the hotel corridor.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Harry said at once, taking another step. “You know he was stalking me?”
"Not all," Ginny said. "But you're right; stories for adults tend to have unhappy endings." Her hazel eyes were miles away.
~o0o~
“No, I kept it to myself.”
Draco had a slight tell and Harry threw up “
Weasleys. Draco shook his head. It was almost a shame to take their money.
Harry blinked to himself. This was not a possibility he had considered. "She was terrifying."
“Well, that’s obvious,” Ron said. “Hermione.”
The first of the consequences did not take long to manifest. When Harry returned to his hotel suite that night, Draco flew at him immediately. “You voted down the bill!”
There was an odd silence as Ron tried to work out what was wrong.
Remus nodded once, then looked away. "Harry, no man can know the truth of another's marriage. But I ask you to consider honestly: is this what is best for Ginny and your children? If you truly believe it is, then you are on the right path. But if it is for reasons of your own, at their expense…" He sighed. "Harry you cannot begin to imagine the guilt I have felt these long years. I was apart from her for less than a month, but after she died all I could think of was how that time could have been better spent."
If boredom had been evident at Godric's Hollow, it became Harry's constant companion on their holiday to the Highlands.
Harry bit his lip, and began an abridged version of events in Strathpeffer – the beauty of the Highlands, his growing discomfort, and his words to Ginny. He did not mention Draco once, saying only that he had been seeking peace and respite.
"I think Sirius mentioned that your family held a ball at this time," Harry said carefully, remembering Sirius' snorting about the pureblood pretensions. It was a Black tradition rather than a Malfoy one, and Sirius had recollected sneaking down with his brother to watch the festivities which according to him were "archaic and designed to secure them in their superiority".
After dinner, after the celebration and the fireplace and the snide remarks on his time in London from Percy and Audrey, after the drinks and the jokes and the games of Chess and Snap, after all of that, Harry had lain awake for hours. There was insufficient space at the Burrow, so he and Sirius had returned to Grimmauld Place to sleep. Ginny was to stay at her childhood home that night and they would meet tomorrow.
Harry’s shame at himself deepened. “I had not thought it had been so long. Of course, I’ll come round on Saturday. How is little Lily?”
What she would have said next Harry would never know, as the door on the other side of the suite opened and Draco emerged.
"I know," Harry said, rubbing his wrists. "Oh, Ginny, how can I ever…"
Harry had sat by her side for the rest of that night and well into the next day until she woke for the first time. He'd held her hand, stroked her face, ignored Madam Pomfrey's insistence that he get some sleep. When Ginny had finally awoken, he had kissed her knuckles and whispered, "I'm so sorry."
“We?”
was what was important. Malfoy could go to the devil: Harry was with his family.
Ginny had gripped his fingers as tightly as she could. "This was not your fault," she'd said. She'd said other things, about how she just needed rest and quiet but all Harry had heard was her absolving him when she had no idea of how callous he had been, how selfish. He could see now that he had been distancing himself from the idea of her – and now he had abruptly been reminded that she was real.
Harry snarled low in his throat. How was it that Draco could drive him insane in mere moments. “I care that I am responsible for his life being ruined!”
It took Lucius a moment to recover himself.
Draco shrugged. "Observation. Of him and of you. He has been your de facto father, no? And you are in many ways a conventional man yourself."
Harry's stomach sank. "Oh?"
"You'll be all set to begin Healer training, then?" he asked, the kind of question family members are expected to use to break the ice.
“That’s quite enough, Mr Kirke,” Diggory snapped across the room. “Unless you have more questions Mrs Weasley – no? — Mr Kirke, you are excused.”
Harry would once have apologised. Now he tightened his grip on the back of Draco's neck, licked his shoulder blade. "You are mine, Draco," he said simply, "And I took you."
Harry’s fingers tightened on Ginny’s; she gave a sharp intake of breath and he released her at once, meeting her gaze in apology.
"Can they do it to you," Harry said, hesitant, "if there's no body?"
Draco nodded, and looked back over to where Harry stood, still rigid against the wall. "And I am sure that while at school she visited you, or she visited the Weasleys. Did you ever visit her home, her Muggle home?"
"And only I was worth the risk?" Draco's expression turned smug.
Draco swallowed hard. “It’s too late for all that, don’t you understand? He’ll be coming for you.”
“Yes sir. He came to the house and I serviced him.”
"Molly doesn't hate you," Harry said, having heard this one before. He still was not completely convinced that he spoke the truth of it, but he was determined that Sirius should believe it.
Many husbands lived apart from their wives, for reasons of business or finance or simple inclination and it would not seem strange. I'll see the children, he told himself. I'll see them all the time. But the words sounded hollow even in his own head. It was their mother, not he, who was the most intimate part of their lives and Harry knew it.
Blaise had never reacted to Draco’s temper that Harry could remember, and he didn’t now, saying merely, “Malfoy! What an unexpected delight. May I offer you a brandy?”
“Oh, hell no,” Draco snarled and without another word he had physically caught Baddock by the ear and was hauling him out of Potter’s office. “I did not put in a full day’s groundwork to have you pip me at the post!”
“What?”
Sirius' face clouded over. "Has it been so terrible to stay here with me?"
"But that's not why you did it," Harry said, knowing Draco so well, knowing that all Draco had ever wanted was Harry all to himself.
“I requested a reward for the return of a letter written in his own hand alluding to acts such as we have discussed, that much is true.”
Ginny met his eyes. "You will be convicted, Harry," she said quietly. "There is no question of that after yesterday."
decide to come – it was unlikely to be favourable. But since all of this was a fantasy anyway, Harry imagined the two of them getting to know one another and coming to some kind of détente. Draco had liked Remus that year he’d taught at Hogwarts, Harry thought he remembered some mention of it or other during their time together. There would be that, at least.
Draco raised an eyebrow in lieu of cajoling; he knew she would enjoy it far too much. “Probably not. Do you think I need a manicure?”
Draco was checking him for wounds or some such but at this, his eyes narrowed. “And where did you spend the night?”
“Uneventful. I declined to get dressed before it became absolutely necessary.”
"Perhaps you should attend more matches. Leave the children with Morag more often."
Harry tried to dismiss the image from his mind as he roused himself. His bed was empty, his wife sleeping in the confinement bed already, and he neither missed her nor found himself enjoying the space. His stomach felt unsettled, as though some gnawing fear plagued him. He kept thinking of the dream and of Sirius's words:
"Well, a husband is a terrible nuisance after all," Hermione interjected, with a sly look towards Ron.
Malfoy was always colourful and so Harry chose a burgundy waistcoat and cravat to wear beneath his tailcoat; he had purchased matching gloves but never worn them as Ron had declared them 'dandyish'. He thought perhaps that on this occasion that would be appropriate.
Kirke was very talented at what he did, there was no sense denying it. Harry's hips were jerking involuntarily and Kirke was meeting every thrust Harry made, taking him deeper and deeper. Bertram's fingers snaked up Malfoy's body to pinch his nipple and with that Malfoy cried out and shuddered, Bertram's choking making it clear that Malfoy had found release. With that, Harry could hold back no longer and, closing his eyes, he emptied himself into Kirke's willing mouth.
Draco laughed harshly. "I will never make my father proud. I had my chance in the war, but I refused to do as he bid."
Dumbledore had always told him that his heart was his protection. Perhaps indeed it had been, but now it was become his greatest weakness, so full of conflicting desires that he knew not which to follow.
“Potter!” Draco said, bursting through the door.
"It just happened," he pleaded, knowing it to be a lie. He should feel it, shouldn't he, should feel shame at his infidelity and at his perversion but he could not. The knife twisted at the thought of Ginny's pain but he would not this time destroy himself to save another. "All right, it didn't," he decided suddenly. "Hermione, I…"
"Of course," Draco spat. "Of course, take a fortnight to visit your wife and your red-headed in-laws rather than taking the time to even try to make yourself known to my social circle."
“Not at this time, Minister.”
He had not told either Ginny or Sirius where he was going or who he intended to meet. It was damning, he knew, but he had felt as though he had no choice. He had to know what Teddy had to say to him and he could not face their questions if he had to talk to the boy about anything untoward.
was somehow more venomous than any insult Harry had ever had hurled his way.
Startled, Harry protested, "You believe me so easily persuaded?"
"Perhaps not," Draco said, shaking his head. "Yet I think there are certain establishments where we would draw less attention than we otherwise might. I will meet you here at seven o'clock."
Harry rose to his feet. He had failed his wife tonight; he would not fail his children. He would not fail again.
Harry slid his mouth over his lover’s cock again and again until Draco was moaning above him, fingers knotted in Harry’s hair – though he did not tug, did not fuck his face but rather allowed Harry to worship him. The head of his cock hit the back of Harry’s throat and he gagged a little. Draco whimpered at the sensation so Harry let it happen again.
Harry cringed a little as the ever-overwhelming Molly Weasley swept on to the scene. He shook hands with Arthur and the two exchanged wry glances as Molly fussed over Ginny, asking if she was sure she was up to the strain of the party, if she was sure that this could not have been delayed to allow her more time for recovery – in short, she asked again all the questions that she had come to Grimmauld Place to ask repeatedly over the weeks before this evening.
Malfoy managed to get Harry's cravat untied and open the front of his shirt. The touch of Malfoy's fingers on Harry's bare skin was indescribable, sending white-hot chills through Harry's body. Harry moaned and held on tighter to Malfoy's silk strands of hair.
"But of course I will be Lord Black one day," Harry said with a rueful smile. "Any such career would be beneath the dignity of such a noble house."
October cooled into November in days blurred together with joyful discovery. Draco's clothes slowly accumulated in their hotel room and Harry found that watching his lover dress, meticulous and always with an eye for maximising the impact of his attire, was just as arousing as removing his clothing. Harry for his part discovered that Draco loved to climb into his bath, spilling the water all over the floor as their slippery bodies melded into one.
“Between six and ten on average. Depends on the season.”
"You always did," Sirius sniffed. "Much more like your mother than like James in that respect."
“All right,” Draco said with a sigh. “There’s no help for it. I want to be invited to more of your family events.”
"What would you like to do this evening?" Harry said, trying to make up for his departure. "Anything at all."
"You must have passed the messenger on the way," Sirius supplied. "Is Ginny all right?"
Sirius bit his lip as though afraid he might scream.
"You cannot promise that, you know you cannot," Draco cried. "And I…"
“No, sir. No, it’s
“None,” Pansy said. “Sorry, darling. I can tell you that they’re definitely done though – Nev said that Weasley was all for stringing Wood up and Potter had barely talked him out of it.”
Harry looked down at his brandy, rotated it around the glass. "This one has been hard on her."
Harry sighed inwardly and turned. “Yes, who is there?”
“How many young men would you say rent rooms from you?”
He sighed. He was growing chilly now, and it was not sensible for a man of his standing to be out in the darkness, unaccompanied. If he was seen, people would talk.
"He always wanted you and I to become friends," said Draco.
"Are you going to return to living with Ginny?"
The Burrow always felt over-full and over-decorated but at Christmastide, with almost 30 guests in the house, both of those characteristics became more pronounced. The walls seemed brighter, the lighting more pronouncedly red, the sound of so many demonstrative people in one space larger. It was all overwhelming, Harry thought, and so far removed from Draco's description of his family's ball that Harry felt his fingernails dig into his palms before he even realised he had clenched his fists.
Harry kissed the tip of his nose gently, then his forehead once again. He was such a fool for this man.
Harry didn't know where to look. He couldn't pull his eyes away from Draco – he kept drinking in the sight of him, his throat, chest, thighs. Harry was so
“His father would hardly afford him an allowance for the purpose,” Harry returned, and Sirius conceded the point.
He glanced at Draco, who was looking at him with a slight frown as if trying to work him out. He might have spoken then, either of them might, but that was the moment when Goyle arrived with the carriage.
Harry fidgeted again. “She has to know, about this.”
it was irrational, but he could not stop himself. It was as though the melancholy which afflicted him had been amplified by his failure in this until there was only fear and self-hatred and a gnawing certainty of disaster.
~o0O0o~
"Oh yes, of course, your children," Draco sneered. "They will keep you forever tied to her. I see you studying their photographs when you think I am asleep."
“Yes sir. On one occasion he bid five of us go to a room with him.”
He had in fact reminded Harry that he would have to tell Draco he was going. Harry was not relishing the prospect in the slightest.
He had reached his limit. He could not watch Draco tup these gal-boys and play the part of the sexual adventurer. Draco was enough, more than enough for him; why was he not enough for Draco?
When Harry came back to himself, Kirke was wiping his lips and Malfoy was looking at him with that terrible knowledge in his face.
"You continue to comfort yourself with the notion that you have no choice," Draco said though his tone was, for him, exceedingly gentle.
Teddy looked uncomfortable at the mention of Malfoy and Harry's gut clenched as he wondered why. "I've met him a few times," Teddy said, guarded. "He is my cousin after all, though he sneers at me because of Father's condition and Mother's history." Her blood status, of course, Harry thought. "We do not correspond regularly, but he invited me to visit him at Malfoy Manor once or twice. I declined."
“He’d have to,” Draco said, but Harry could tell he didn’t quite believe it himself. “I could convince mother, I know it, and she is the only person he ever really listens to. We could have a life together, a real life.” Draco had grown closer to Harry and took another step now, sinking to his knees. “The Blacks had a cottage in Provence. Imagine a life there, drinking wine, socialising with other men of fashion. Walking and touching in the open. It’s sunny there most of the time. You’d love it, Harry. You could get a suntan while I’d be doomed to use a parasol like a woman, I suppose, but it would be the two of us and it could be good.”
“It’s so much more convenient for Harry, living in the city when he must attend the Wizengamot every day,” Draco said blandly, interrupting Harry’s thoughts. He was occupying himself by pouring coffee, and ostentatiously realised as he did that there were only two cups. “I’ll just ring for another cup. Or do you prefer tea, Ginny?”
Malfoy sighed dramatically. "Pansy, please."
"Oh," Harry whispered.
Harry shifted, uncomfortable. "Should I be? Will the world take one look at us together and draw the correct conclusion?"
Diggory nodded at Hermione and looked again at Harry, who wondered if perhaps Hermione had got through to him. “Thank you, counsellors. I will ask you now to leave the courtroom while we deliberate.”
"I remain steadfast until death," Draco translated. He closed his long fingers around the coin.
"And you were so kind when we were here before that I do not wish to outstay my welcome," Harry said firmly. "There are no doubt some reasonable rooms to be had for rent; it need be nothing extravagant."
Harry wondered bitterly if people ever did anything else.
But then, there was no one in the house…
Harry took a deep breath and followed suit with his wand. “This is from before Scotland, isn’t it?”
"Sleepy start this morning?" Sirius asked, bringing Harry's attention back to the present.
man as your husband."
Malfoy held Harry's gaze as he reached out a hand to trace the angle of Harry's waistcoat from collarbone to where the two halves met halfway down his chest. Harry couldn't move, found himself rooted to the spot, unable to do anything but look into Malfoy's eyes as his other hand slid around to Harry's hip.
"In some ways," Harry acknowledged. "He was as you know very close with my parents before they passed away."
“Good,” Harry said, relieved. “Good boy. I’ll miss you.”
“No,” Charlie said.
Harry smiled at her and proceeded into the gathered throng. Many of Sirius's old acquaintances were present. Some he greeted with pleasure and some with mere politeness. But Harry did not see Sirius's jaw actually clench until the arrival of, "Lord Malfoy, Earl of Wiltshire, Lady Malfoy, and Lord Draco Malfoy!"
“A relief?” Draco repeated. “You know that everyone wants to shag you.”
Potter gave a pained little laugh. “Right, because of the papers. You know Ginny never said that. Any of what they put in the papers. But she wasn’t about to deny things that made me look good when she’d gone and dumped me.”
Harry swallowed hard. “If he says things like this to the wrong people – the right people… Draco, what we do is still illegal.”
“Come now, Draco. I understand it must be galling for you to have a seductee refuse you at last, but it happens to the best of us.”
Harry answered as best he could and Hermione fired off counter-spell after counter-spell.
The words of the fiend rung in his ears like a death-knell; he could appreciate the irony.
Harry sighed. "It would be not to rush."
, over and over again though he could not have said who he was thanking at the time; it certainly wouldn't have been Potter.
He had sent an owl to Hermione to let him know of his appointment to the committee and asked if there were particular issues of which she felt he should be aware. He knew her well and as expected, she had been unable to resist lecturing him via the written word on the importance of the work of the committee. The letter began rather cold, but Hermione was always one to warm up to her subject if not her addressee. In particular, a private member’s bill that contained relatively innocuous language but which could apparently be interpreted to allow for whole populations of Muggles to be forcibly relocated away from sites of interest to wizards had caused her ire. A long paragraph explained that this had been inspired by the treatment of Muggle tenant farmers in Scotland and Ireland, rather ironically, and that would likely be used as justification. Harry fully agreed with her assessment that two wrongs should not make a right, though he snorted when he read that last.

"Draco?" he said softly. "Draco, I still haven't given you your birthday present."
Ron's expression turned ugly at once. "Malfoy," he spat.
Harry winced slightly; he couldn't imagine that life as a Malfoy servant was particularly pleasant. As he stepped into the room, his feet sank into deep oriental carpet. Above hung a pink glass chandelier, almost certainly imported from Italy.
"You were fine until…"
Ron shrugged, "Never knew him very well. No one else?"
"That will do very well," Draco said, over emphasising the L sounds which had the effect of making his tongue curve over his front teeth. Harry's face flashed hot and Draco's eyes glittered.
"Of course. It could not be postponed indefinitely."
He sat and inquired at once after Teddy. The topic took them through their first course, though Remus' face told Harry that his manoeuvre had not gone unnoticed.
It stung, particularly after Harry's own determination to remain faithful to Draco despite everything. But this was nothing he had not known or could not have surmised. He reached out to stroke Draco's arm. "Are you not happy?"
“Well, yes, but given the memory we were shown, I would think Draco Malfoy should be required to testify.”
It was an argument with no resolution. Harry wanted to keep talking, to tell Draco of all the fine things he saw in Hermione, and had seen in Colin Creevey, and all the others he'd known who according to Draco had no place in their world. But he was not a skilled orator and he could not see how he might change Draco's mind.
He hadn't been in ever since that name-shouting incident. He'd taken to ordering via Owl instead, considered it best for all parties – in much the same way he did when he had a hankering for goods from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Of course, in the latter circumstance, he also used an alias just in case.
Teddy grinned. "Well, then Harry, let's take a dip in the stream!"
“Maybe… Terry Boot,” Draco admitted.
It still hurt him to pull out the knife.
"Would you have chosen to love me?" Harry asked, holding his breath slightly. Draco had never actually said the words.
“Be seated. Lord Malfoy, you are here to act as prosecutor in the case against Harry Potter, is that correct?”
Yet Harry could not look away from the face in front of him. Lord Draco seemed to shine in the lamplight, all pale skin and pale hair and pale eyes. Harry dimly registered that he should have looked washed out but instead he appeared radiant with some inner light. His lips, pouting and pink, belonged on the face of the world's finest courtesan, not the son of a nobleman. Harry felt as though he had been struck by a Bludger. Confused by his reaction, he felt his face begin to flush.
"Mr Potter!"
“Well above the going rate,” he promised rashly.
Lucius Malfoy sat in the procurator’s chair. Harry never looked directly at him, but could see the fine quality of his robes and the relaxed posture of his body. The man was most likely excited by all of this.
~o0o~
The huge white marquee had been beautifully decorated. Delicate golden chairs formed clusters around the refreshment tables while gardenias hung from the poles keeping the structure upright, filling the air with rich, sweet scent. Guests would enter to the sight of the whole Potter family, plus Sirius as honorary patriarch and host, and proceed down to where the festivities might begin.
After a hearty breakfast of kippers and bread, Harry kissed Ginny goodbye and Flooed back to Grimmauld Place.
"And did you kill any?"
"I'll call her now," Sirius promised, and stepped past Harry where he sat on the stairs. He looked at Harry and reached out hesitantly to touch his shoulder. "I'm sure all will be well."
But Draco was still speaking. "Can you promise that no one will?"
Draco continued not to speak for the rest of the day. After they returned to their shared suite, he went to lie down and simply stayed there. He would not respond when Harry spoke to him, nor was he stirred by offers of food or alcohol.
Mercifully, Sirius had gone out by the time Harry returned or he did not know how he would have explained Blaise’s presence. Kreacher had come creeping out of the kitchen to bow and scrape and offer him coffee, which Harry accepted having been denied a drink at the hotel.
“No doubt, Mister Potter,” Lucius returned. “Do bid my son a good evening.”
The hell of it was that he was right. Sirius had cautioned him against his actions but Lucius had issued a warning shot. But for him to vote with Lucius after all this? It was too much to ask.
“Draco,” Pansy said, wincing slightly, “I rather think you need to put it away.”
"Quick and dirty, then," he said to himself. If Draco recalled correctly, that was the way Terry had always liked it.
“I think it unnecessary.
"Are you mine?" Harry asked, straightening again to examine Draco's response.
Terry's head came up at once. "Draco," he said, discomfited. "I'm surprised to see you here."
Harry turned to meet Draco's gaze. There was an expression in his eyes that Harry was unaccustomed to seeing – something quite unlike the brash confidence Draco wore like armour or the softness Harry could find in him sometimes when their passion ebbed and they lay together like this.
Hermione held him until she managed to stop weeping, then she took a seat. “Before you say anything,” she began, “I’m going to need to cast a few spells to ensure the Aurors aren’t listening.”
Harry swallowed. "It is hard to know whether that is a desirable state of living."
"On the subject of women," Sirius said awkwardly.
He remained quiet a long time. Then, "I don't know."
Ginny nodded briskly; there was a flash of pain across her face but she did not falter. "I had thought to change the children's surnames to Weasley. Everyone will still know whose children they are, of course, but it would perhaps insulate them from the worst of things. I had also thought of taking them to the continent. Sirius has offered a place in his Italian villa, to which he also will be removing himself." Her tone made it clear that she knew why. "I have not yet decided whether he remains a suitable influence for the children."
An eyebrow flickered. "I would never miss an engagement, Potter. It doesn't do to let down one's friends."
"I'm sorry," he said gently. "I did not realise it would have such an effect on you."
“I might,” Draco said loftily, but by Harry’s laugh, he could tell he was fooling no one.
