to get it out; it looks to Harry like the way he felt every time he had that urge to break things. He can't hear all the words but there's the phrase
“I mean -” Percy plays with his fingers, tearing at papers he isn't holding - “It was my fault, wasn't it? That he died. Fred. That's why I couldn't come home. Why I couldn't talk to any of you. I thought the best thing I could do was try and be of use here.”
“Yeah, well -” Ginny sighs heavily, but before she can continue Taz stomps over to her grinning – stomping is Taz's normal way of walking, after all, and she throws an arm heftily over Ginny's shoulders -
“Have you talked to Draco about this?” she asks instead, surprising him and giving him that plummeting sensation of guilt all at once, because he hasn't of course and he was feeling bad about that
“I swear -” Hermione starts, but gives up. “Look. Anyway. Sex jokes and pyjamas aside are you coming to these fireworks or not? You are, that's the end of it. Harry -” she adds magnanimously -
was significant, corners and sections of the building still in disrepair, and then all the new ghosts, so many of whom were people they had once gone to school with. He had known from the first few days that he was not going to last the first time, let alone the whole year; he had already told Ron of his plans to quit and take up his position in the Ministry before Christmas.
“The headmistress sent me -” he remembers - “- with a message for Miss Parkinson – she'd like to see you in her office as soon as possible.” The kid nods, pleased with himself for remembering this in the face, Draco supposes, of his own brilliance and vague fame. He glances at Pansy who seems to have gone a litle green.
Harry thinks, depressed by it, they might have got so much further so long ago if he had just been able to
The Great Hall is heaving when Harry walks in, every student, teacher and visitor apparantly in attendance for
“Blerghk -” Pansy croaks, still bizarrely angled with her forehead planted firmly in a stone. Draco looks around a little nervously.
said Ginny had nice skin -” Ron's brain catches up to his mouth which promptly falls open in horror - “Oh seven shades of no, Harry do you think about Ginny when you're -”
He stops rather than say it and add to the list of things he never had. Draco frowns, a memory floating up to him like a shadow flickering in a candle flame.
It takes Draco so long to react, Harry is afraid for a while that he will not. When he does, he looks around the room for someone, perhaps who will stop him having to be visible.
For so long now he has felt helpless in the face of destiny and other people's expectations, their ideas of him, the things they thought he had to do, the people they said he had to be – everyone it seems but Draco – Draco just hated him for his own sake, because of the idiot he had been in refusing his hand, and there is such relief in that. If he feels helpless now it is a different kind of helplessness, one that realises how much it has placed in the hands of somebody else, in making one person so much to him. He kisses Draco's head, terrified and exhilarated by how much he wants.

as glitter in every imaginable colour rains from the ceiling. The room fills with whispers, squeals, laughter and gasps as it settles on them all and still hangs in drifting rainbows through the dark above their heads for some time. Then there's a second crash and a bright white beam of light illuminates a figure on the stage as though they have just beamed down from outer space. He hears Luna squeal
“The hell did you do?” he says quietly, but not – Draco realises, watching his face – accusingly, just sad; sad for him. It occurs to him that the warm spark in those eyes, the spark that has been following him so much of the time, might be compassion.
He curls a hand, the gentlest of fingers around Harry's neck, and pushes up hard to meet his thrusts and it feels like the boldest he has ever been in his life.

“You know,” Ron says, breaking the chance for an awkward silence to take root - “You ever think about re-opening this place, I'm game.”
“Harry!” now Hermione comes striding over, Ron and Krum flanking her like soft bodyguards - “Draco! Both of you – don't you realise Wonderful Wizarding Week starts in two days now?”
“No -” Harry feels suddenly conscious of this, along with his awareness of it; the jeans and t-shirt terribly mediocre even next to a simplified Draco – not to mention a little sweaty from the heat and press of the Great Hall. “No sorry. Had to hurry.”
“Whaa?” He had half sat up groggily, blinking and squinting . He had never been the worst at waking up quickly – all those years of Dudley jumping up and down on the stairs, not to mention all the years afraid of imminent attack, or at the very least nightmares, never having quite left him even so many years later.
His brain catches up to what he said before, and his lip twitches into something that almost resembles a grin and his shoulders jerk with a huff of amusement. Potter catches on to half a smile like a fish to a hook and reaches out his hand to Draco's right. Draco has to practically sit on his hand to push it out of reach because his instinct shrieks at him just to take his hand but he won't. He remembers a viciously made vow to himself from years ago – that whatever else happened – they could kiss, they could fuck, they could kill each other but he would
“Yeah but – why me though?” he frowns at Hermione, unsure why she thinks he needs to hear about anyone elses problems just yet. He's not sure he can carry his own, let alone even
“Whereas I sleep in my clothes, obviously.” She sighs and throws a dressing gown on and by the time she reaches the front door Narcissa is already letting in a woman who for a brief moment makes her blood run cold and she has to force herself not to run away panicking; Ron grips her arm with protective tightness.

She groans. She's almost certain fixing Harry and Draco are essentially one issue. But what can she do? She can't throw them in a room together and hope they'll just sort it out because she's fairly scertain that they
Not long afterwards Draco finds himself deeply ashamed of how quickly he did so, crying out, screaming uncontrollably as though being told what to do was what he had been waiting for all along. His unravelling is the final straw for Harry and he's gone, emptying his heart and hate and balls into Draco, pushing his face down by the back of the neck as he does, jerking out every last drop of desire with frantically stuttering hips.
“I, well -” he looks a little confused. He looks like someone looks when they have been cut in half in the moments before the dead pieces fall to the floor - “I was being nice.”
or something in that vein. In fact he hardly dares breathe, for fear it will stop Draco actually talking about this. As it is, Draco stops walking in the doorway between the corridor and the landing and Harry sees the shudder that ripples through him, down his back and making his shoulders twitch. He wants to touch, to run a hand down his spine, but he suspects it would not soothe like he would want it to; but god he wants to kiss the tension out of every line of Malfoy, wants -
at shutting himself off even he is unsure who he is any more, what he stands for. The whole last part of the war – the battle – all he seemed to do was run on instinct, instinct leading him to the room of requirement, to swing himself up onto the back of Potter's broomstick when it was offered, to instantly run away from the fire when he could and hide in a broom cupboard until the world outside seemed quieter, taunted by the memory of an awkward third year fumble in that same broom closet that seemed just then to be a million years ago.
“Yes yes my Gabrielle – she is like you, very sweet, very innocent and trusting. A foolish, beautiful child that I love.”
which means within the hour. He's had to put extreme undetectable extension charms on their bags just to allow for books. Then Covent Garden was a success and he's building up to Camden market though he's heard there are still a few hidden dark magic shops up Camden market and he's not sure he wants Draco getting ideas. Not that he's
She had seen the boys in the corridor not ten minutes before – seen enough to know better than to disturb them now. Curious, she thinks, to be the parent of a child (and how long before she keeps thinking in those terms, that word? Forever? When he's the age she is now?) - a child in love. Because he is of course, she has suspected it for years, and it would be blind and foolish both not to do quite a bit more than suspect it now. Thank god for the occulemency lessons that had hidden
But it's too late, Harry and Hermione are on them before they can move and Draco finds himself staring at Potter like a rabbit in headlights.
“Sure.” He shrugs with one shoulder, he supposes he always did; him and Fred only ever having one whole shrug between the two of them.
“Besides it's not entirely accurate is it?” Luna smiles benignly - “He mostly fucks you and we all know it.”
“No, I didn't think so dearie.” She watches Molly attempt to suppress a smirk and fail. Oh dear. That means everyone heard. She supposes they could not have avoided it if they wanted to; she cringes inwardly at the idea of anyone hearing her raise her voice like that, not to mention the
“I'd rather be Crucioed!” Harry wails, but he sits up grumbling and Draco perches stiffly on the bed beside him, because for all his talk he isn't entirely comfortable here either, and they both look at each other for a moment with a glance that says they both really
“Sounds like reason enough for me,” Draco beams - “Let's give it a bit until Blaise loses it too, shall we?”
“Oh my -” Harry sighs, staring skyward as though in prayer - “It's so nice when the whole family get together for New Year. No Luna, Gin?”
He nods glumly and stares heavily at the turf as they all trail off ahead of him, wondering what the hell they all think he needs to get a grip about and
that had been the first moment he thought of when he was first attempting a Patronus – the moment he had fallen head over heels whilst still deciding his first love was his first hate.
“It's not -” he hangs his head - “It's a different world from the one I grew up in -” it sounds pathetic even to him - “We're losers surrounded by the people who won, we're defeated – there
His head and chest still throb to the beat of his last song, the music casting a spell on him as he makes it that lingers long after the singing is done. It always has done – ever since he took it up, ever since he felt how healing it could be. He feels like he's still flying on it. Sometimes he wonders why he did not go further with actual flying, he had always secretly wanted to in school; he wasn't terrible either, even if one particular arsehole always beat him to the Snitch. Oh
“Malfoy” Ron nods at him, not quite curt, not quite friendly, but in the faintly embarrassed recollection of all their conversations with Harry before coming out.

it was second year again. He can hear raised voices from down the pitch – Flint – who's a better and fairer captain of the Wasps than Harry would have ever given him credit for when Captaining the Slytherin Quidditch team – heading back up the field towards them still rumbling his assurances that – as Taz just said there's room on this pitch for all of them – and a group of what looks like angry rainbows and sparkles trailing after him.
be persuaded, however much he knows better than to share his worst opinions these days) Harry grits his teeth and swings his plan into action. Then, that night when Draco gets home, he picks a fight with him on purpose. Draco's always easy to bait; he's known this since first year, it's something they have in common after all, and it works like a charm.
But he sits in his chair and he touches his face and looks at his hands fidgeting in his lap as though constantly trying to reassure himself he does exist, that he still lives, trying to work out who he could possibly be now. The door opens and he jumps. Twice in one morning is too much.
that's what that voice is - “Not that I don't appreciate you being here, but did you come up here just to talk about babies? Also –
He hands her the letter and she gets up off the library floor, kicking a book which spits and scuttles away from her under a shelf. She reads it over with a little frown between the eyebrows and he casts an eye around the library – it has only taken Hermione three days of
“I propose a toast,” Draco says, chin jerked up a little pompously, but as Harry looks around the table he sees the others looking at him with faint smiles and little to no animosity and sighs a deep and happy sigh - “To the re-opening of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, and you can bloody well let me in this time!”
“You don't get to decide that. I want to see at least. I want to visit – there's nobody inside, I take it?”
“Luna? Miss Lovegood?” she closes her eyes briefly. Nothing here is easy, nothing at all. How to atone; she who never felt such a need in her life?
“I love you,” Harry says, before he can talk himself out of it. That little head shake again, as though Draco cannot stand to hear it, does not believe it, or both. The coward in him makes his lips start to form the word
a lot of them seem to have an idea as to why he played so badly that he does not even have himself, sharing knowing nods and sighs with each other rather than giving him the shit he suspects he deserves.
“You're so obtuse! Both of you! You've been being obtuse for ten years, now that you're finally at least snogging I think it's time to sort it out, don't you?”
Draco frowns, wondering why Harry would feel the need to tell him this when he never has before. He finds he cannot say anythign, terrified at the prospect of saying no, uncertain how to even begin to voice consent. Instead he says -
He really had wanted to help – hadn't he? He had been sure of it. He had been hoping to see Draco since they had got here; so that he could
“Just because you had some sort of falling out last night – yes you did, Hermione told me – doesn't mean he's not kind. You weren't there when I was staying at the Manor – I mean staying at the Manor makes it sound nice, but I was in a dungeon so it was ever so boring and a bit unpleasant – but he came to see me quite a lot and brought me extra food and books at least so I had something to do. He always looked so scared but he did it anyway. He got me blankets too. That's really incredibly brave, don't you think?”
“Seriously Draco,” Blaise comes to stand beside him, eyes following where Draco's eyes go, not looking straight at him, as tends to be his way if they ever
“Almost didn't recognise you under that bumblebee suit. Merlin, you look like a Hufflepuff on acid -” the laugh is fake and clear as a crystal bell in the morning air, but the glee that accompanies it, Harry fears, is entirely genuine. It occurs to him that he's been
Brigade whole heartedly. He just looks down at his fingers on the table, still and tense, every line of him tight and as though he has been paused, just waiting, not even caring what happens to him. He has been watching them since they got into the court room. Narcissa gave him a mildest fraction of a nod when she saw him looking, Draco made eye contact like a butterfly in flight, eyes skittering away in the instant like a frightened foal. The others are stationed near the exits, ready to move in; Harry just wishes he could let the Malfoys know, the nerves coming off Lucius are enough to knock a man out and no wonder. The crowd on the way in was as ugly as he predicted, shouting for their deaths, for immediate lynching, shouts of
Draco just nods and makes a high, short, stifled noise. Harry grips his hand tightly and looks around them, positively frenzied. Room of Requirement, just down the hall; it's almost ridiculous, he thinks, when he's never even required anything quite this much, but that last turn of the staircase led them here, of course it did - like the school itself wants them to work it out. He practically drags Draco into the room, which seems to have decided on minimum requirements only today; there's not even a bed just a decent sized mattress and sheet in the corner, blankets, a night light.
“Something nobody's tried,” he says, and Draco has to keep from panicking, breaking down, bolting and the gentleness of those fingers on his skin, the way Harry leans in to kiss ever so gently this time, putting aside whatever he previously wanted for some doubtless malicious purpose Draco cannot quite fathom. His hands are gentle on Draco's back and shoulders, the ghost of every half loving caress he has ever stolen teased out between his fingers. They're moving awkwardly until their legs hit the sofa and they go down, still entwined, Harry pushing Draco ever so gently onto his back and mounting him with every gesture a question that allows him to escape, though that is the last thing Draco wants to do.
hard, he had thought every day that something or other might get him killed. Above all, his mother had repeated, insistence hiding her own terror – he couldn't cry, he could never cry; when they gave him the Dark Mark he had to grit his teeth and heart, and numb his brain and pretend it didn't hurt, that he wanted this, that he was
Draco's finger nails cut crescents into his palms for clenching so hard and he cannot wait to find out
“Did you? I don't know Potter, I was in the bloody dungeon, and sure alright just go there why don't you?”

It feels to him now as though over the years he had wanted every different possibility – he had been jealous, wished it were him, wished they could be friends,w ished the bloody Chosen One had died in his crib, wondered what he was like, wanted to grow up with him, wishing they never met, unable to wait until the day they went to school together – all of that before they ever even met. He'll have to explain this, but his head aches just imagining how to start –
Potter was dead. He had died. He had died and they had failed – he still cannot forget being aware of that. Feeling the absence of that
Just before he can leave the door Hermione bounces up, whispering something to the others and catches him -
“What the fuck?” he's frowning, taking a step towards Draco, hands turned up in bewildered pacification like he's trying to talk to a horse that just threw him. Draco skitters back hard until he's standing at the top of the stairs.
that power – or you could have – but it never even called out to you, did it? You never for one second thought to pick up that wand with all the power it contained, and Voldemort – he was prepared to kill the world for that wand but you – so you see – that was when I realised that I loved you.”

Draco hisses, lip twitching, but he's scared, for all the spite he manages to force into the word - “Don't ruin it, Potter.” He waits until Harry inclines his head ever so slightly in an agreement they both read as
feel like it goes that far back, like there has always been this core of him that was amused by Malfoy's humour, ennervated by his presence, tingling beneath his scornful silvery gaze.
“What? How you always hated me? How it's all been too much too fast and you can't do this any more? Fuck you Potter, I don't want to hear it,” Draco almost screeches, finally yanking his arm away and looking ready to run off at any moment, although it is not lost on Harry that he doesn't.
lonely, Potter.” It's a lie of course, he's lonely most of the time, has been since he can remember, it just hasn't necessarily mattered for a very long time.
There's only one thing he can do; be the coward he always knew he was and run away. He can picture all that ice creeping out from his heart, turning him into a statue of himself and shattering apart, damaging everyone around him with the splinters. He walks briskly, not quite running, out of the house and slamming the door savagely behind him.
“She's helping me research the history of the house. The books didn't like me at first because I'm not – well, you know – and in return I'm -” she realises that now is not even faintly the time to say what she's trying – possibly unsuccesfully – to help Narcissa with in return. Luckily Draco does not really seem to care.

“It is different, yes but also the same. I understand also I do not. Everyone can feel many things that are contrary simultaneously – this is a right word yes?

Anyway, she has no intention of staying around and being privy to all this girly gushiness; if it's not about her she's not especially interested, which reminds her – she gets up without comment and heads upstairs. She may not pay overmuch attention but she still knows where to find the younger Monsieur Malfoy at this time of day and she raps on his door smartly.
everything that just occurred to him or if he's just happier because he's going home – even briefly.
“Ughff.” Percy sits down heavily on the bottom step of the staircase, George takes the spot on his left and somehow or other that feels okay. He notices that there are bags under Percy's eyes,his sleeves are rolled up and his hands are filthy; he's not just been helping organise the re-build, he's been pitching in.
just to finish our education. I for one am going to go back, regardless of the rest of you.” She nods definitely.
“Bloody saviour with your bloody hero complex,” Draco snaps - “Maybe some of us are sick of being saved - did you ever think of that?”
“He was here,” Draco says, Harry coming to a halt beside him on the landing, looking down into the front vestibule. He can see Draco's hand, pale against the dark wood bannister, fingers very still and stiff - “When I arrived home that summer – on the
So many lies, he wonders even now if he'll ever trust anything anyone says again – easier to pretend to be someone else, to be Draco Black, the rock star; not Draco Malfoy the frightened boy, pretend it until it becomes the new truth – he needs.
Pansy's lip curls almost ferally back from her teeth - “Fuck's sake – Draco's completely -” she pantomimes a melodramatic swooning gesture, “-then?”
makes it sound personal, like he cares more than if it was someone else, like he's been stalking Malfoy since the start of term, making sure he stays halfway okay.
to be the one to apologise. I think perhaps there is less work to do here than I had thought before I came?”
“I was thinking childhood trauma-ville, you slow dumb fuck, but you do you. Look, making friends with me is a) impossible, b) you won't like me and c) probably your main concern – won't get you into Draco's pants any quicker, and I swear to shit you
“Well, all those stars up there – they're dead, aren't they? And supposedly we're all made out of dead stars or something. I always thought, maybe you and I -”
“Kind of. It's two stars that are so close they look like one star, from a distance you might think you're seeing one star, but really it's two, always together, fixed in each other's orbit. Draco –
“Remember the first time you came in here?” the smile that tugs at his lips feels a little ghostly, as though those little first – year – to be's are still in here with them - “It was the first time we met,” Draco adds, unnecessarily.
“Oh, please don't, it doesn't suit you – oh well I didn't mean that exactly, how rude of me, I meant it means you're sad – I know you
Harry sounds furious, exasperated, his voice straining like he is groaning deeply on the inside. Draco is immediately angry that whatever

Hermione's certainty irks him, the last irk perhaps in a long line of everyone's confidence in him irking him.
Honestly, hating on Potter is the most comforting emotion he seems to be able to conjure up right now. He just wants to be left alone, utterly alone, alone enough to imagine that nobody is even trying to get into his head any more. He got so
“Oh no you mustn't do that!” Luna's eyes widen in alarm - “Regrets are a waste of time. You see, they don't help and they make you feel all wiggly inside. You should brush your hair though, and talk about things. They
“Harry, we've already been through this a hundred times this morning, then you went through it twenty times more with Ron and a couple with Viktor and we all told you the same thing.”
It occurs to Harry that if he still had the map on him, he would probably have used it by now to find out where Draco was, to somehow accidentally quite by chance, without meaning to – have ended up roughly in his vicinity, somehow, of course, quite by chance, without having even
right now, and his breathing is ragged, coming out in gulps like he is trying not to scream. Sometimes the screaming part
“Don't worry about Luna,” Hermione repeats - “I've never met anyone as forgiving or – or – odd. If she says anything awkward, well, she – does that to us all. That's just Luna.”
“Us too,” George nods - “Right Fred?” he looks to his side. Everyone tries to look elsewhere. George nods to himself, remembering for the thousandth time, and his face looks as though it hits him again for the thousandth time -
Thankfully someone had shouted at him then, in no uncertain terms, to get his arse on his broom right the fuck now, and he had been granted the perfect excuse to run away.
“I am not taking back, and I think you are waking up on wrong edge of bed this morning. I did not even come to talk about you silly boys and nobody is
“Oh -” he hears his next breath hiss out in a burst of slightly hysterical laughter - “I bet you do.
“No.” Draco's lip curls in scorn and Harry wants to kiss it, wants to burn in the flash of gunpowder that glints in those silver eyes - “What a stupid, pedestrian phrase. Why would I ever -”
“They're not going anywhere fast Harry -” Hermione reassures him “There's time. Nobody can stay in their room forever. But it might help if you're not waiting literally outside the door when he
But he cannot ask, and god knows if Potter would even have helped. Was there ever a time when he might have? It feels like there might have been, but it is a time now hidden behind the dreadful wall of this past term and that terrible cruel summer.
a lie in!” snapped Hermione, who they notice for the first time is already dressed, has a cup of tea and is attacking her hair with a brush.
“Which one?” Draco scowls, folds his arms, holds in his own ache of wanting with what he hopes looks like a defensive gesture - “What do you mean
“Yes,” Hermione nods quickly, gratitude leaping in her eyes. “Yes, I was just telling Ron, I've been on the 'phone – you – I don't mean to be rude, but you know what that is?”
All he seems to want to do just now is sleep. Every time he wakes up there is immediately too much to get used to – so much his head spins and he feels exhausted before ever getting out of bed. He has to remind himself where he is, what he is doing here, how he came to be here and then
Cissy too, he suspected, had always acted more out of loyalty to the family than any true dediction to the cause – to the Ministry or to the Dark Lord. She had supported him silently in everything, yes, but shown no passion for anything beyond himself or Draco. When she had fought him on anything it was only where the boy was concerned; and in those instances, she had been fierce enough to scratch him into submission every time. The truth was and is that any time his wife truly insisted on anything at all, he would always give way to her, not because he was scared of her moods – her steely temper and her terrible terrifying silences - but because he wanted more than anything in the world to make her happy; to give her everything. Draco too. He had been raised in a firm belief in the necessity for power – power meant stability – enough wealth and influence and your family could never be harmed. So he had always gone where the power was and morals be damned.
“So do you,” he says stubbornly, sitting up, pushing himself back against the headboard and glaring. This time he does get a -
she says with a pointed look that makes it clear she is not being self pitying, and Narcissa realises instantly what she must have done.
He resists Draco's attempts to just barge on past, and Draco finds himself essentially running into him like running into a wall. He realises for the first time how close they are in this stupid pointless room, how he can feel the heat coming off of Potter, the tension in his body, his bloody breath against Draco's bloody face and it occurs to him for the first time that he probably doesn't smell too good after the days in his room
He rejoins his team as they cluster on the edge of the Quidditch grounds looking to where their team Captain is locked in altercation with a group of people a little too far down the pitch for Harry to make out clearly.

He'll be skulking back a villain, who has, for reasons not all the students will understand, been given some kind of reprieve. Every day finds him a little more tense about it, a little sulkier with Harry and at the same time with his parents whose concerned and repeated inquiries as to whether or not he's
has always been a bit of a touchy subject; a walk down amnesia lane he suspects he only ever wrote into his repertoire to hurt himself.
“Oh be quiet and fetch tea, Ron!” Hermione pushes him, but she smiles as he goes and shrugs apologetically at Andromeda - “You'll have to forgive him, he's a bit slow -” she leads the way into the small drawing room and opens the curtains. The room lets in the sunlight as though it has been starved of it too long, the weak watery light illuminating the gold in the furnishings and sloshing across the floorboards. The sisters sit down in facing armchairs, Hermione perching herself discreetly on the edge of a chaise longue.
close before he realises he can't, that this feels too good, that he does not deserve it and he cannot possibly express so much so fast, and he tears himself away viciously though it fucking
Roughly a year after the wedding, they find themselves in a carriage pulled by thestrals, gliding with eerie smoothness through a series of increasingly narrower country lanes. These are the lanes hidden in between the hedgerows, the byways of the countryside that even walkers do not see, and a cloaking spell masks the carriage from any passers by or from the cars on the main road cutting through the fields beyond the window. Their muted grind could belong to a different reality and sometimes Harry still has trouble reconciling the two worlds that feel like they should exist in different places, not alongside each other. He can hardly stop fidgeting, like the clueless kid he once was, on his way to Hogwarts for the first time, hands restless in his lap. He glances to Draco, looking for any reassuring signs of restlessness or nerves that might make him feel better about his own but there's nothing. Draco's hands are still in his lap, his face a careful blank.
He actually has to look away from the play of hurt confusion on the idiot's face; he actually feels mean for spitting those words back at him. He hadn't meant to, but they had made him feel so soft and when Potter had kissed him – they had made him feel like being wrapped up in warm starlight. How could he
“Merlin's bloody beard on a bike!” Draco announces - “It's a sea of sodding weasels – uh, no offence, Mrs Weasley,” he adds quickly, blushing profusely when he notices her noticing them.
but I've been helping McGonagall organise the re-build. Well it was better than working for the Ministry, and I couldn't come home, not after -”
“Yes,” she echoes - “But we'd like to get back to her as soon as we can – I don't suppose there's a quicker way than flying?”
that he was kissing back – he's not entirely sure how it is he cannot remember this clearly – maybe because it still feels like a dream, god he's imagined it for so long it's felt like a memory for much longer than this after all. Then the strange swirling space his head was in, the strange choice of words that had come out of him before he did it – everything like he was under a spell, like it couldn't possibly be real. The more he thinks about it the more it feels to Harry as though it didn't really happen after all.
“It was in our seventh year,” Harry shrugs. “And it was blue -” Hermione tilts her head to one side with a quizzical look - “Blue and green,” he amends. “It was pretty, like the sea, the colours – they cheered me – I had a moment of feeling like they made me feel better – and it was because of how they looked – huh, I only just realised that. It
“It does happen.” Narcissa wipes one finger under her eye but she keeps her other hand in Andromeda's grasp - “Look, I understand,” she says eventually. “I do not expect you to forgive me – there's so much that has happened, so much still happening – but we are not who we once were – any of us, and perhaps with time you and I could be – something like sisters again?”
He's been thinking about this for a little while anyway, terribly afraid that a certain name could spill out of him at the same time as everything else.
“I don't think -” Lucius tries to summon up a glare but his heart is not in it and Narcissa cuts across him -
Once again he finds himself hating Malfoy with a fiery pleasure, hates him from the toes of those knee high silver glitterboots to the crystal jewels studded in a starburst pattern around the corner of his eye. He hates the way his nose turns up as he looks him over, like Harry was something he had stepped in, hates the knife-edge lines of him and the contrasting softness of the scarf playing around his neck as though the breeze itself was in love with him. He hates the way Malfoy towers over him, now more than ever in those six inch platforms, hates the sneering cut glass and crystal of him, silver and gold glitter in his hair and the breathtaking strength and fragility in his eyes – he
“As what?” Harry looks at him curiously, but Draco has started walking just a little in front of him as they head down the corridor, keeping his face carefully hidden.
“Show me.” Why does he have to sound so demanding? So authoritative? Under other circumstance it would have been quite painfully arousing.
“The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold -” he says, the words coming up to him out of the depths of something once read, half remembered, out of context, better and more perfect now than they were to begin with - “The curves of your lips rewrite history.”
Standing at the foot of the staircase, looking upwards and away from him. His heart stops, stutters, lurches. Gods it was a mistake, a mistake this whole time! He should have known. His heart had kept telling him it wasn't real, after all. He should have listened, he -
if he remembers rightly the context wasn't as sweet as it sounded, but the words would never make it out of his mouth anyway, that would be romantic and he doesn't get
“All sorts,” Harry says, relieved - “like a rainbow, only one colour after the other, not all together – when I first heard you – fuck that was only yesterday -” he pauses, trying to process this, wondering how they can have come so far in such a short space of time; but then again they've waited long enough. “You were golden – I never felt – or saw anything like it – and tonight – god, you were like -” he finds himself blinking back tears – at the memory of it, at his own inability to find words beautiful enough for how Draco sounds to him. “Sorry,” he hangs his head at his failure at a sudden excrutiating rush of his own inadequacy - “I'm an idiot, sorry,” he blinks back tears rapidly, unable to look up.
never failed to impress, wasn't that what his father had always said? He had felt ashamed of how much it stung, a shame which had grown into something bordering on heartbreak, a confused and horrifying sense of rejection which he had quickly decided was hate rather than let it keep stinging.
about what she did – when she sent us all to the dungeons. She said she understood why I'd said it, that I was – you know – it wasn't a picnic having the Dark Lord in your head, and I was just saying what half of us were thinking, and – you know, Potter actually came to talk to me today, and said
“You know I've never actually punched you before? It's starting to look like a great time to break a record -”
“I still hate him too,” Harry sighs with painful honesty; if it's only half honesty, it's true enough to bother him. He sees Hermione close her eyes in pain -
Oh shit, he can't stop – once again he cannot stop staring at Draco's lips, like his drug and its antidote are held there, sparkling in the gold dust; he feels so
fault? Don't be stupid. I – I – I -” Draco's voice shakes, and Harry sees his shoulders shudder with a sob.
Sound asleep since round about midnight, the strange light waking him, a semi – softly whispered “Lumos!” in the dark beyond the bedposts, Draco dressing by the window, not even trying to be quiet about it.
Malfoy, I'm never done -” he finds himself no longer surprised by how well his face buries into the crook of that distracting neck, pressing kisses into the collarbones as if to smooth out every sharp angle - “Not with
“I don't want to sound bossy -” Hermione says, and Harry raises an eyebrow at her because she doesn't care a bit about sounding bossy and they both know it - “But I do suggest you work it out before you – um –
“Soppy git,” Draco shakes his head and Potter leans in to kiss him, forgetting about the pins and threads swirling around them - “Pins!” Draco yells - “Pins! Pins!” as they both get prickled and pull back into position, chuckling.
clearly, though she is far too delicate to say this out loud - “Do you think – may I presume to ask if you think we should do anything?”
she and the Weasleys are taking it in turns not to let him be alone even though he cannot help but feel a lot of the time as thought that is exactly what he would like best. Still, he's glad she's here now, for advice, and it
“Doesn't matter -” he clasps the back of Draco's head in his hand, presses their foreheads together. “It doesn't matter what you wish you'd done – the second I was alive you were there – not any of the others, it was you – you who realised I was unarmed, you who fixed it. It was your wand that destroyed Voldemort, not mine, not Neville's, none of the others –
the best reason. Think about getting warm, think about lying down somewhere soft out of the wind. Think about that little spark of joy you get when you tell me what a loser I am. Think about flying. Think about chocolate and feast days. You really want to never taste again? Or feel? Or be loved?”
“Helpful,” Draco sighs, rolling his eyes, still looking out of the window. It's strange, the view, because their little lounge area feels so otherwise like the Slytherin common room; but here's the sky outside and the view beyond, they missed out on this as students here. He can see all the way out over the hills, he never really appreciated before how beautiful it was. It hadn't been until his sixth year that he'd really started coming up to the higher parts of the castle and then – well maybe he wasn't ready to be honest with himself about exactly what he was thinking back then, but it certainly hadn't been to appreciate the beauty of the place. He watches the leaves spiral in the October breeze, tries to pick one and follow it until it floats out of view; he follows it for a long time, like watching a Snitch, trying not to get distracted. He can be good at this if he tries, there was only one thing always broke his concentration – and it's the same thing now as when he was playing his first Seeker's games. He sighs, doesn't want to look back at the others, too busy imagining himself as one of those leaves, just content to be flown hither and thither on the air. He misses flying and it occurs to him that a certain amount of aimlessness could be wonderful.
“Actually -” Hermione whispers as she lets her in and closes the door. “Ron charmingly abandoned me to mediate on a Black family reunion. It's utterly awkward and thank god you're here.”
“Of course”. He bends down as though about to kiss her on the cheek, seems to remember they're not alone, and kind of just bumps her face with his face instead, both children snorting a little before the girl pushes him tenderly away. He side-eyes her on the way out, as though he does not quite trust her, frowns as though he is trying to work it out, and is gone. Perhaps Hermione sees her frown a little because she stands up, holding her hands in front of her awkwardly -
“Just here to support the bae,” Ginny shrugs without malice - “Can you believe Bulgaria are even sending their National Team to play at a mere school festival anyway?”
like this? It can't be right. He wishes he was capable of moral right here, but if his thoughts are, his body is not, and his hand is on Draco's hip before he knows how it got there.
to glam rock, the tailored waistcoat and gold swirl down his face looking more like a uniform on him than their school robes ever had.
looked like he might – would that have been a good thing? Would he even know what to do? Why was Malfoy so mad about him having helped them already anyway? Why did he care so much? God he was getting obsessed with a spiral of questioning, it was like sixth year all over again, only with more helplessness and stuck in a cupboard with a stupid bastard erection and sense of regret.
“None taken dearie.” She looks fondly at the boys as they join the group in the square by the lion statues; she pauses just on the verge of ruffling his hair, Harry pleading at her with his eyes not to,
The first thing she realises, when Harry and Draco apparate in, is that they have almost certainly had sex. The second thing is that – for reasons she cannot grasp, considering point one – they aren't speaking to each other.
“I suppose we'll have to,” Draco's smirk pulls up on both sides - “Since I suspect we'll break everybody's heart if we don't -” he doesn't say
that he's shut out from, and though that's alright, he does suddenly feel a little jealous – not of any one of them but of the soft, easy affection he cannot possibly imagine having in a romantic relationship. And why is that? A voice niggles at him –
“You and I. We are very alike I think. We see but we do not say – and they say beautiful cannot mean clever,” she scoffs. “We will speak again”.
step – having been in no position to be permitted to cry or scream or even react at the time – was to blame himself, start screaming at night and develop an absloute terror of snakes (which is a whole extra level of shame for a Slytherin, Harry has long since discovered).
She can practically see the Rita Skeeter headline, no doubt suspecting her of nefarious purposes. Not that she ever even
Draco practically whoops, Harry hasn't heard that whoop since fifth year, usually it signalled delight at some failure or pratfall of his. Over the last two years he had been almost starting to think it was a tone of voice he missed. He was wrong.
“With actual lying in?” Harry adds - “No offence, Hermione, but it's eight o'clock in the morning and we didn't sleep until four.”
“Does this mean they're – getting on? I thought -” she flaps a hand - “Well we heard them after breakfast, raising voices in the hallway, and I think – I think -”
And he had still failed. This is the part that kills him by degrees, has been killing him since he got out of Azkaban. He had been right in so many ways to want to stay there rather than face the Dark Lord again, but in the end it had not been the Dark Lord that was too much to face- it was seeing the change in Draco. It was knowing that he had seen him last before the start of his fifth year – the boy he knew shining with so much of his own hope and arrogance, sparkling with his mother's tenderness and mischief, and then coming back to find him hollow cheeked and wide eyed with fear, crushed by a sense of failure and hopelessness, painfully unable to look anyone in the eye. He had felt enough of the latter himself that he cannot now remember when he last made eye contact with his son.
not -” Ah thank goodness, Harry thinks, he's fine, he can hear the scorn coming back - “- there are still wizards out there who know how if you know where to look. Of course, I don't know -” he finds himself drawn towards the stool at the central grand piano as he talks, betraying an incredibly shy enthusiasm that makes Harry feel like he ought to hold his breath - “I don't know if I'm any
“She will have lists,” Viktor smiles benignly, kissing Hermione on the top of the head as he walks by - “She is loving the lists.”
“Yeah -” he risks a cautious sideays glance, but Draco's face is that bewildering blank that he both uses for truth and hides behind. “I wanted to tell you straight away – when I realised – but I couldn't find you and there was so much happening -”
It hardly feels real; kissing Draco has always been strictly the stuff of late night wank fantasies and rarely even that since
Everyone blinks for so long in surprised pleasure to hear George spontaneously speak so cheerfully about
feels like it has to be the wrong word for it, some of these galleries feel like being in church, the ceilings swooping high above their heads and their voices echoing like little lost ghosts - “I think my aunt Petunia would probably approve – all of – you know –
“Trying to get me alone Potter?” Draco smirks, lip curling in the old arrogant way, starlight in his eyes.
“I thought -” he says, taking a deep breath to say it - “I thought you hated me -” Draco smirks, but it's somehow kind.
“Well, never mind -” Hermione goes on quickly, saving him, glaring at the other two – simultaneously Harry notices, even though it requires her looking to each side of her which takes some mad Hermione-only skill. “I wouldn't worry about it Harry, I just can't believe you hadn't noticed before now.”
just say no, wants to say he's not here, but either way it's too late and there's Hermione closing the door quietly behind her.
The voice sounds distant, as though calling him from far away, another time and place, only it's this one, this time, this place, not the one he put himself back in, the terrible one.
like breathing, he's ready to explode from how much and how intensely he wants. His fingers tremble at the buttons of Draco's shirt.
Then there's Luna of course. One afternoon she comes to him about the colour scheme for the upstairs sitting room; the downstairs one is classy enough she says, she let Narcissa call the plans for that one – this one she's thinking something fun – something colourful, rainbows and beanbags – didn't they have a bunch of decorating stuff in storage from when they were first decorating the shop? They do, it's at the back of the shop; thanks for that, she says, as though George actually
“That's good, 'cause you're not gonna get it. Fuck, Malfoy - I'm hard as rock and I hate you, what do you think's going to happen?” He pushes him in the chest - his hands want to linger on his skin, but he wants him pushed back against the mattress. Draco shoves back but it's ineffectual.
and Harry had to wheedle this out of him like untangling jewellry – ever think she deserved to die, and he certainly did not want her eaten by a snake. In fact Draco, Harry realised only after a very long time, never did, never would, wish anybody dead and hated physical violence, backing off from it every time like you'd back away from a slug.
“The sky's awake, so I'm awake!” he beams. Harry shakes his head with a sigh. That's it, he knew he should never have let him watch
of Draco to do this, simple and impulsive and affectionate and open – open like he was in their first year, before the world and the war ever taught him to close up, just a kid who had tried to make friends with another kid going to the same school, neither boy quite knowing how to do it.
“What? Fleur? Really?” Hermione frowns - “She's – well, I think she's quite difficult to like, to be honest.”
he said, and his mind has been stuck on the three words ever since; sometimes he just sits in this room, half rocking to himself while they roll over and over in his mind;
it – you were too busy drooling over some skinny twink Gryffindor back when were all supporting Krum -”
do they? But then - then I know that's unfair, and you can't compare pain just because it's different – like Harry, he lost his parents and then just like –
Narcissa nods. She remembers the things Draco had once had to say about Hermione too. She also remembers catching sight of them talking the evening he and Harry apparated back from Malfoy Manor.
By rights they should not be flying out here, in a place where muggles might see. But it's early July and the air is heady with the warm smell of cornfields, there's magic in the air, and they are both rule breakers at heart, really. More to the point, it's not like he can ever really deny this idiot anything. He can see him shining up ahead, hair bright, face wicked and alive in the moonlight, teeth white when he turns his head to grin because -
this, likes every nice sensation, every moment of pleasure and he knows it would all fall apart if Potter saw his arm. Just thinking about it throws him backwards -
“Speaking of which – and I know this isn't quite relevant -” Arthur cuts in apologetically - “But after quite a lot of negotiating I finally got Shacklebolt to force Skeeter and her people off of their little campsite – the Manor's clear again Malfoy – whenever you need.”
“God yes -” Harry almost whimpers it, and his mouth is on Draco's and Draco can feel the thing in his chest fucking clawing to get through, to break through him into Harry and scratch them both to pieces and wrap them up together in the tatters of their former selves; he reels with the force of how much he wants. They grab at each other very like a fight and he feels positively furious with lust and neediness, and for a while he lets it be all he feels rather than having to fight the thing in his head, which tells him in a snooty, logical voice that it's not true, of course; Potter cannot possibly love
“You – suggested the sleepover?” Harry blinks blearily from his pile of cushions, squinting at her tentatively - “In fact I said, isn't nineteen too old, and Can I bring my boyfriend, and
“Oh -” she remembers as she stands up, handing Teddy back to Hermione - “Ginny says hello, and have Harry and Draco worked it out yet?”
the song itself is a deep rich purple and they clash so terribly it gives him a hadache. From the second he saw that symbol he had been expecting an attack, and sweet Merlin on a bike what did Draco think he was doing using that – even as an illusion –
“Is he always like this?” Pansy raises an eyebrow as Blaise heads out, eyeing them both suspiciously like a parent who does not believe the child's promise to sleep for one moment.
- from George in the next room, everyone finishes up all the faster and mutters excuses before hurrying off in different directions.
She goes to her own room smiling. That night she dreams of Australia and two people who do not know her welcoming her all the same before putting her in a paddock with the pet kangaroos. Eventually the kangaroos start kicking her and she wakes up grunting to find Ron poking her and telling her there's someone at the door.
Funny, how things keep happening, George thinks; first Angelina, then the shop and a few days after that a call from Ginny at the Burrow – almost as though these things are meant to happen. Ginny asks him to come home, to sort out the picture of Fred in the family portrait hung over the fireplace.
She wonders at the sensibility of handing Teddy over to Luna but she shrugs and risks it anyway as they wander through into the kitchen.
“Do you know? I don't think that's entirely true. But I would be honoured – to be half of your star.”
she remembers – nods and stands up - “I'll be off then. Let me know what time you want me to tell 'em when you're done?”
His fingertips glide up Draco's arm with just a hint of nails and Draco shivers happily and snuggles in closer, making a humming noise of comfort, almost a purr, self satisfied as a cat.
“I've decided that the house system fosters mistrust and enmity. Actually, I've written a letter to Professor McGonagall about it, suggesting they overhaul the entire system before the next term – if there
who could possibly have come out of a war undamaged. How could there be? She determines not to try and make this list have any kind of order of priority any more because to compare what each is dealing with is impossible.
“Shut up Malfoy.” He never uttered three words more tenderly. It sounds almost like he might be saying something else. He has to kiss sentiment away, but it's hard not to
“I didn't say anything,” Hermione sags a little. “Harry,” she reminds him, remembering that she needs to - “And Draco. We have to talk to them.”
“Go,” she says, shooing him with hand gestures - “Go on get out of here. You have a date on the roof most of this room would
Draco, actually. Anyway, she'd often thought of it and she said she was glad I was here so she could say it. It was – I mean y'all can shut up, but it was kind of nice.”
“Yeah. Course. I forgot, you weren't there. Last I ever saw of our brave new head, she was sending me to the dungeons for not wanting us all to die. Like she's going to just
peculiar. She makes his bed and lies down on top of the duvet. Harry looks at her and eventually sits down in the baggy green armchair. She wonders why it takes him so long.
in silence he says it with every line of his body, with every press of his hands and suddenly this problem where they cannot stop touching, cannot communicate beyond their physical urges, is the opposite of a problem and when Draco runs his lips up Harry's face and kisses him so softly on the scar he starts to cry, like he has not done this whole time, quietly but wrenchingly, shaking with it, incapable of saying anything other than
“Speak for yourself.” Blaise shrugs - “I'm a fucking delight. But yeah, I'm a fucking delight with pyrophobia. I can't lie. How are you doing?”
“Fuck off, Potter -” Draco snarls like a cornered cat, prickly and hissing, trying to drag himself out of Harry's grip .
He stops, almost nose to nose with Flint, who stands in front of his team as though protecting them from this onslaught of glitter, shimmer and arrogant petulance. Harry finds himself blinking rapidly, like some of that silver dust cloud got caught in his eye and he cannot help but take a step forward frowning at the same time as the silvery – gold head turns to stare at
“Um – yes and no? No as in – I still feel like shit. I get mad at having to fake it, knowing that if I say half of what's on my mind, if I look sad, if I cry too much it'll make my mum cry – yeah that sucks. Sometimes -” he confesses, in a quiet voice few have ever heard - “Sometimes I hate her for it. Like nobody else should get to miss him except me, because they don't
be something you'd do.” They lie for a long time hand in hand, both afraid the other will hear his heart beating out of control. Eventually Draco turns over, reaches half heartedly for his clothes -
any more either. He stands up abruptly, turning round quickly enough to catch Draco watching him with a raised eyebrow.
she sent us to the dungeons to keep us safe – because so many of us had family amongst the Death Eaters, she didn't want us to
even to make him feel better. Her arm itches. He stares at her when she reaches a hand to it and she drops it - “I'm sorry about punching you.”
Strangely enough hating Potter gives him enough strength to work his hands into taking tea with a muttered
“Well -” Draco shrugs - “Sort of. The rest of the family disowned him before I was born, so -” he shrugs again - “They used to do that a lot. Honestly sometimes I'm surprised I'm still in favour. Still; alright, the dog star – heh – must have been some pre-cog abilities my ancestors never knew they had.
“Just you. Trying. I've seen you Draco, I've seen you every day trying, you and your mother, changing how you think, how you behave. You've always thought you were like your father, haven't you? Well that's not who you take after at all. I see you, we've all seen you. Being better than you were. I don't need a heart of gold; who has that ? I just need you, being you, being better today than you were yesterday, that's all any of us can try for, isn't it? I fail at least as much as you, you know.”
do that. I just – I don't seem to be able to think straight when it comes to Malfoy. I don't know why.” He is not sure why it has taken him so long to admit this out loud to anyone, let alone to actually think it.
The truth is he's not sure if he does – or he does, but he knows in his heart he would resent them anyway.
“Like – you might be thinking they have really nice skin or something and this is – like connected to – um – what you're doing -”
“The Dark Lord -” he flashes Harry a look, one designed to challenge him not to look away without him having to see too deeply himself. “I think he was – I don't know. He hated anything with a hint of goodness in it, happiness – or – or sweetness – because music's not always happy, nor should it be – he hated even the sound of it. We were lucky any of the music collection survived. Or the peacocks. Everything he destroyed he left us
After all the noise he finds himself crying, silently, shaking and there's Draco, shaking beneath him and he moves carefully off him and to one side, but never letting go, clutching on to him as she weeps in a continued outpouring of release, enjoying the feel of crying, and Draco clings back, trembling, burying their faces in each other and tangling up their limbs into something nobody could hope to separate.
“No,” Narcissa looks at her with something like amusement - “I'm not. Though I suspect you're right. Have you seen this?” She hands Hermione the note.
to be some kind of glamour, right? Malfoy – exactly as he had been today, all pale perfection and elegance and poise, even the way he looked at Harry like he wasn't good enough to kiss his ridiculous glitter boots, makes Harry whimper in needy lust, thrusting into his palm and trying not to think about those eyes, what that skin would feel like to touch, how delicate and strong he seems all at once, how the sharp angles and soft skin of him would feel beneath his hands. He can see that tongue coming out again to lick his lips with foul intent –
“Half? Are you mental? It' three times the rate for you, you twonk; actually fuck it, you can shop for free – it's what Fred would have wanted.”
“They revolve around each other,” Fleur nods, almost making her jump, if she ever did that. “I have seen,” she shrugs.
“That's that, then. Do you know which room is Harry's? Not that I don't like the Malfoys but I already disturbed one this morning- nearly two -and I
“You -” he says, as though it's a miracke, breathing heavily as though he has just come from the battle itself and he has, reaching to cup Draco's face with fingers just starting to to feel the relief of it - “You. I almost lost you too.”
he knows what it means, he leans back and slams into him savagely. This time he does run nails down his back, making marks that leap out in instant red; he's so soft, Harry hears himself hiss between his teeth – he could hurt him so easily. This is why he kept away, why he hated him, why Draco always got him
He's in a corner of the bathroom floor, knees pulled up to his chest, fingernails digging into his arm and just ever so slightly starting to drag, face screwed up, angry and sad. It's taken them years to bring his reactions down to anything this good, but Harry still wishes – he wishes and he wishes for a lot of things.
“Oh no you don't. That's for you to work out, and I mean that in all seriousness. You need to start thinking about what you owe yourself, what you want.”
I'm the one who allowed every fucker else to show what they really thought of us, and I'm the fucking coward who's not facing
“Give em some peace, hey Gin? It's snog break, isn't it?” she winks at Draco and Harry and kisses Ginny before she can retort.
it turns out, some muggle literature; Charing Cross is now a regular daytrip, and yes it can take the whole day. Draco gets testy if Harry tries to drag him out of shops
Luna approaching Lucius on one of those first mornings he came down, with every appearance of utter disingeniousness – asking him if he knew the purpose of come weird dark magic artefact she had found in one of the upstairs bedrooms. He had, he admitted with what looked like real guilt – known. This had proved incredibly useful to the entire project as far as Luna claimed to be concerned, and after that she came to him constantly with untoward items, eventually coming to an agreement in conversation with the Malfoys and Harry to move as many of these curiosities as they did not dispose of to the Malfoy Manor collection, thereby de-cluttering the house, simultaneously letting Lucius be of use whilst gaining something in the process. It said a great deal perhaps, about the trust they were coming to have in the Malfoys, that questions of these items ever being used were never even raised.
“We're here.” The car pulls up to a white-fronted house with a red door, and she sits for a minute before getting out.
Most of all, once again, she has to help Draco. Little else matters. And with sudden clarity she realises who best to talk to to help her help him. She does not like it, but she grits her teeth and sets out through the house to find her.
“I think Hufflepuff. But really – don't tell him, he'd be mortified. Anyway, you don't have to be in the same house to be friends – or whatever it is you want to be to each other –
never will. Fuck sake, he's barely twenty, too young surely to be mooching around thinking Glory Days thoughts.
offer it. He feels, acutely, how Draco must have felt all those years ago when their roles were reversed and he had been the one to refuse Draco. He
It seems to Narcissa, when she comes back down in their wake, that the shadows maybe have lessened just a fraction, that Draco's tiny frightened, brave whisper left the room just a little lighter than it was before. She smiles.
“Teenagers – mostly they are thinking of themselves, they have so many troubles. Some will see, some will not. Me – I was not connected, I suppose – to these people? So I see. They think I do not but I see.”
He finds himself telling her how he cannot produce a Patronus any more, not when Fred was there in every happy memory he ever had. She glares at him for it, asks him if the memories are sad now, then? He starts to say of course, how could they not be, and she shrugs him down, doesn't make the past sad for what the present is. Would they have been crying then instead of laughing if they had known what the future was going to be? Happy memories aren't finite, she says, some of them haven't been made yet. When she says goodbye they agree to meet again soon.
“It wasn't that -” Draco waves it away - “It was the place -” he stops, suddenly remembering exactly what it
“So uh -” he looks round at them all - “Hermione told you the plan right? Does uh – anyone have any questions.”
The three of them run to catch up with the others, and they tumble into the bar stamping feet and rubbing hands together against the cold.
“In some ways yes, in others no,” she tosses her hair, finding that she actually rather delights in being able to talk to someone who is utterly unmoved by her every gesture since in truth, they never have been mannerisms intended to seduce, everyone has always just fallen over their own feet at her anyway. Frankly, it's been tedious.
Fleur appears to be ignoring her, and starts painting her nails, resting a divine hand on the arm of the sofa.
“I -” the whole courtroom can hear Draco's jerky breaths and something in Harry aches for him - “Yes – that – that's correct.”
Strange, almost like grieving, to know that he loves this boy beyond anything in the world. Beyond anything she could give him or prepare him for. She feels bereft; maybe all mothers do, she does not care, does not like other mothers, does not, in fact, like children. It is almost like heartbreak to know you are no longer first in your child's life – but a selfish heartbreak, one that any kind parent has to hide, and strange because there is a happiness in it too, knowing how glorious love can be and perhaps it hasn't been like this before; perhaps her son, because he is after all who he is, covered love with a lot of scorn and loathing and rejection – she can understand that – but if it was not wonderful before, she thinks perhaps it can be now. She saw the way they looked at each other, she knows how it feels, what love looks like – and what she saw makes her happy for them. There is no option in choosing between the happiness and the heartbreak, no sensible option anyway. Something inside her glows golden with it.
Harry jumps at the same time as Hermione to the sound of a huge bang, like a door slamming so catastrophically the whole house reverberates with it. It occurs to him for the first time that there were actually others in the kitchen with them all this time, George sitting quietly reading at the table and pretending not to be hearing them, Ron frying bacon with his back turned stoically to them and Narcissa wandering in just as Hermione was saying this last thing.
“Not now Hermione,” Harry snaps, and leaves the room almost as quickly walking as he apparated in, leaving her and Draco staring at each other awkwardly.
It is so rare they even use the front door of Number Twelve, and he is in such a panicked hurry that he does not even close it behind him, running straight out into the street and looking left to right wildly. For a minute, his vision is so blurry with his own panic that he does not even see Draco anywhere on the street and then he does, right down the far end and disappearing round the corner at a brisk walk.
means in this context. He sees Draco drift towards the window. He's so pale, he notices suddenly, suffering aside, he's just so pale anyway, like a moonbeam, a silvery shadow falling across the floorboards – he looks so small in this house, ghostly almost. Hard to imagine him living here, growing up here,
“Well – that one -” he points with a straight arm and can feel Draco's eyes following his finger. With his spare hand he idly strokes the ever arrogant tilt of that chin; almost like tickling a cat, he can practically feel the purr in Draco's throat - “That's the saucepan thing -”
It seems almost unjust to him, as he heads downstairs, that nobody will ever know the effort this takes, how brave this feels. Because it's not an act of heroism; it's not even useful to anyone, it's just – just breakfast. It's impossible. He stops on the stairs, clutching the bannister, almost ready to fall from weakness in the knees, almost turns and runs back to his room. But he promised, he promised his mother he would try. He's failed at everything, disappointed everyone, time and time again – he can do this. He can do breakfast. He clenches his fist, gathers all of his mental strength. When he approaches the door to the kitchen and hears voices he almost fails again, he manages to peer in without them seeing him, counts the people –
exactly like that morning nine years ago. Malfoy's face swimming into view amidst the glitter eye makeup and sparkling chiffon cloud, his eyes narrowing – were they always
“Is it – always this cloudy here? You know -” Harry grins, intentionally obnoxiously. “For the aesthetic.”
his heart has been howling it for the past half year and it shakes up out of him now in this stupid flood of tears.
“Harry, I believe,” Fleur shrugs - “And Monsier Malfoy. They have gone home. I believe. I still do not read the language so good.”
“Harry!” she calls out, raps again - “Harry!” and again - “Harry!” Pause - “I'm going to carry on until you open this door Harry Potter so you may as well let me in!”
out loud. Petunia had thought she was fancy for having an old Upright Piano that nobody could play in one corner of the sitting room. But this – he shakes his head, wandering between gilt and glass cabinets of string and wind instruments – it's just – just – well if Ron was here Harry suspects the word he would use would be
It's been three days of lurking already, and he's honestly starting to wonder what the point is; he watches Draco's door like a hawk, he's seen how many times Harry just
happen, and how does he lose it? Then Potter's kissing him, and something unlocks just a little in his chest and he's kissing angrily back, teeth and tongue and snarl, lips curling under lips, both of them ready to tear into the other, and it's frankly the best thing he has felt all year. Somehow the hands that he puts up to push Potter away end up balling into fists in his shirt, pulling him closer, and it's like they're thirteen again grinding up against each other furiously, hard and wanting and magnetised to each other as ever.
to be refused now and he knows it, he is almost ready to give up, ready to die, mind spinning out of control with loss -
Another half a day and the name of just about every boy in Gryffindor, until not only Harry but most of the form are shouting
“Observant as ever, Potter? I'm getting dressed. The putting on of clothes should be a dead giveaway.”
to be – I think? Or I thought I did. And then – when I failed, the things He said, the way he treated us – I – I think about who I was in first year – second – third – and I can't see him in me any more – I miss that twat so much -” there is a break in Draco's voice that makes George want to hug him. He looks so small perched on the sofa, so lost, it's amazing how much like that first year boy he actually
– but he is here, and this is now, and they are elsewhere and this feels wonderful, just rough enough not to break him with tenderness, and he can see Harry's eyes dark and fixated and wanting him, his hands on Draco's skin, shaking just a little for the desperation of needing him, for the sweetness of having him and he wants to be able to talk and say
have talked it through with someone else in the house, least of all Hermione, but suspects that her resolve could waver at the doubtless sensible objections they might all put up. The girl especially would probably be the first to try and talk her out of it, but the girl does not know what she wants and needs anywhere near as much as she thinks she does, and in this at least, Narcissa has been determined to override her.
explain to him that this might be a good thing. She has no intention of giving up, but she would not have even asked his thoughts on her sister now, let alone ask if he would meet with her as she will. She is nervous about the new world herself but she has never in her life let nerves stop her. That's why she's holding the family together, gripping it like sand beneath her fingers.
as well – in this stupid world where all I knew were these power-mad arseholes using us as pawns in their games, and all you wanted was not to hurt anyone and to stay safe – it was all I wanted too, you know.”
“No it wasn't that -” shit, Harry realises he has to explain this one now he's started. “Well – maybe a little bit that, I don't know – but your lighting effects – they were a different colour from the song – I – I see music in colours? Luna says it's called synesthesia?”
“Yeah?” is all Draco says when George steps away, and he nods, glad the kid didn't ask him anything stupid.
“Guys, shut up!”Hermione attempts to elbow everyone simultaneously and practically succeeds - “Fireworks are starting.”
“Did you?” Andromeda's eyes betray delight - “I would have liked to see that. But your son – Draco – is he -”
staring at Draco's lips, isn't he? He wrenches his eyes up, but those coolly mocking grey eyes are no better; they seem to be laughing at him, at the same time challenging him to yes, absolutely believe they have neither of them changed since they were young Seekers battling across this Quidditch pitch. He wonders if it's a game, an image Malfoy is projecting entirely for fun or if it's harder than he makes it look, and he gulps because yeah, he looks bloody amazing, like every second of work his make up department have taken on him has been designed to draw the eye back to him wherever he goes and frankly, he always had that effect on Harry anyway. He's torn – he's been torn in various directions all morning – between wishing he could talk to Malfoy seriously about everything he's needed to talk to him about for far too long, and frankly enjoying the verbal sparring with a surge of nostalgic joy.
like that. Ghastly. Woke me up in a sweat when I was little I can tell you. But they got to liking us and we got to like them. Snowball even slept on the end of my bed sometimes when the others were picking on him.”
Harry looks at him sideways, suspecting that this is in fact Malfoy for being actually quite pleased to be invited and positively Looking Forward To It. The fact that Draco then stretches out across the sofa with his head in Harry's lap as he continues to grumble also confirms this theory.
looks a little shocked, or more affronted, by the question, but at the same time surprised with herself because she knows she is going to answer it - “That
“Well because – because I -” he almost whispers it for fear of the truth shattering everything if it came out with too much volume. “Because I don't think I've ever felt like this about anyone? Because I think – I think just maybe, this could be it -” he nods, feeling the lump of terror in his throat that tells him this is true - “The big one. I think I really, really love him Hermione and I can't do that to someone – you know what happens -”
wand – oh speaking of which -” he gets it out of his pocket - “I suppose it's time I gave you this back.”
“Yes,” Harry says, patiently again - “I do. I was here, and I saw a lot of the rest of it in my dreams -”
As the days go by not mentioning it becomes a habit, one which weighs on him more and more until the constant awareness that there is Something going unsaid between them starts to make him angry, to make him tetchy. With Draco. Which is utterly unfair of him and he knows it, though the knowledge does not lessen the issue in the slightest. Worse, Draco keeps getting tetchy back at him and it feels almost like falling back into the old days of verbal sparring and hell, maybe Draco doesn't want nay of this, any of
“Harry -” Draco's hand, turning his face, he fights it for a half second then simply stares at him beseechingly, a lump in his throat at the sound of his name spoken like
part of her screaming with which she had shocked even herself, before slamming the door to her room and leaving him out in the hallway. Well, it had been worth it to hear Draco laugh anyway, even if she had heard him crying later in the room next to hers as she tried to sleep.
He hasn't heard his name said like that in years. He'd had no idea how much he'd missed it – he'd had no idea that amount of condescension, verging on disgust even,
“Just now. Just after you said how much you used to hate him and you couldn't do this any more.” She sits down at the table and reaches for the toast.
Draco is still laughing as he puts the hood back up and when his back is turned Harry cannot help but smile; it feels as though a little bit of ice melts out of his chest at hearing Draco laugh and - at his expense though it may be - he finds himself wanting more than anything to make that happen again and as much as possible.
