"Is there a problem, Mr. Potter?" McGonagall asked.
Hermione poked her head out the door. "Oh, good, you fell for it," she said.

"Well, I didn't want to be defenceless while digging through leaves. And, I suppose, it wouldn't look very good if I came out of the Forest with Potter dead.
"Yeah, Malfoy," Weasley said, "You're blushing."
"Harry," he said softly. He looked away, still silently sobbing. "Harry," Draco said again. "Harry, how long have you wanted to apologise for everything that isn't your fault?" Potter's arms curled around himself. Self-comfort. He reminded Draco of himself in sixth year; when he had done that, his mother had pulled him close, sat him on her lap- though he had been far too big- and had just held him and listened as he cried. Potter never
The group nodded; one person (perhaps a third year?) stepped forward. "What makes you assume we'd drink so much we'd get alcohol poisoning?" they asked.
"It was a promise."
"Turn around?" Potter asked.
- "I also saw this- you wrote in a notebook of some sort and you were writing about- uh- Dreamless sleep and death. And I just- I was wondering... What was that?"
He'd succeeded.
Lingering on the fringes of the woods behind the cabin were two glowing yellow eyes.
"Hey, Malfoy, you want this apple? It's green," Harry said, entering the potions classroom Snape used to basically inhabit. He watched as Malfoy's head perked up at the mention of a green apple, and tossed the apple he was holding at Malfoy, trusting that Malfoy's Seeker reflexes would kick in. They did, and Malfoy caught the apple easily, taking a bite immediately.
Harry grinned at Draco, and an identical smile spread across Draco's face.
Harry had sighed. He'd known this was coming, but had still hoped to avoid it. "Yeah, I guess so. Where do we start?"
Pansy said. A satchel. Potter was halfway to the doors; he turned and waited for Draco.
- on the last one, the furthest to the left, he found one. It split the window in half, and was easily big enough for a person. "
"How do you even plan to get the resurrection stone?! Wait, scrap that. How do you know it even works?"
He spotted just the slightest blur of black below him, blurred by his speed; as he approached rapidly, Draco became clearer. His eyes were shut tight, limbs loose, his robes snapping around him wildly in the wind.
Down in the Slytherin dungeons, Draco was nearing the portrait. When he saw the camera next to it, a little red flashing light, he stopped to give it an exasperated look. He sighed, and said, "I love Harry Potter." The portrait swung open, and with a shake of his head, Draco went to tell Pansy about his trick, excitement building once again. He didn't notice the second camera, hidden slightly to the left of the first one, in a little crook of the wall. He didn't notice that it was painted an obnoxiously Gryffindor red, either.
"Back to stalking me, Potter?" one asks the other. They don't argue. They make small, rather awkward talk about one's family, and the weather, and one's friends, and the public and the appearances, and their jobs, and how
?" Draco asked incredulously. "The incompetent, stuttering fool? Who shook like a leaf every time you so much as
As Pansy would say, this couldn't go anywhere good.
Eventually, Pot- Harry pulled Draco hard enough to get him to move, though his feet felt planted to the ground.
He told himself it didn't mean anything.
Draco leant back and listened to Potter rediscovering his childhood home when his eyes caught on the one thing he'd changed.
"Breathe in for a count of four- one, two, three, four; now hold your breath for a count of seven- one, two, three, four, five six, seven. Now out for eight- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight." Draco was careful to keep his voice slow and steady, counting a beat for Potter. "Good. Do that twice more, thinking of your happy memory as you do." This breathing pattern released calming chemicals in the brain; it showed Potter what sort of emotion he would be hoping to provoke with Occlumency. Thinking of his happy memory as he did would hopefully associate the memory with the breathing exercise, and therefore the emotion the memory provoked as a result.
Harry looked over, blinking, and saw that instead of casting something like a

The old man smiled. "Yes, I can see you. Potter, eh? By any chance, would that be James Potter? You match his description quite well... Oh, wait, no, there was another one, wasn't there? Found my Stone and so I had to give up the Elixir. What was his name? Hagrid? No... H... Harry?"

for him, have you?"
He seemed to know that Draco couldn't escape, too. He started off towards the living room- where he had presumably stepped out of the fireplace- beckoning for Draco to follow him.
Potter looked up from where he was rocking the plant, and, seeing the look on Draco's face, said, "Don't. I didn't know how to keep her quiet, and she reminded me of a baby, and, well, this is a popular Muggle method for calming babies. Hey, it worked. I think she's asleep now, though, and my legs are falling asleep. Could you- help?"
And so Potter, being the contradictory little Gryffindor that he is, looks Draco dead in the eye, and says, in the most deadpan voice, "I

Draco gasped in outrage. That would
"I would."
Draco had always adored trying on clothes; he loved strutting up and down the small aisle, doing a little twirl in his fancy suits and his stylish jackets. He liked tipping his hats, when he wore them, as he bowed; when the Golden trio joined them (having skipped trying on clothes and moving straight to buying them), Draco loved the rounds of applause he received. He loved talking with Blaise before emerging, comparing outfits and giving compliments and adjustments.
"I was with Hermione and Ron, but I ended up losing both of them to some of the challenges down there. So I went into the final chamber, which had two things. The Mirror of Erised, and Professor Quirrell."
"Oh. Wait, you're
"You know how you put all the items in your rooms?" Draco asked.
"Alright, boys, settle down," Dumbledore said with a chuckle. "So, what are you doing next? Something to do with the Deathly Hallows, I assume?"

Bellatrix was- well, even Draco wouldn't go to her, if he could. Andromeda was viewed as a blood traitor by the rest of the family... Where else could someone be? Where would a sole survivor of the Black family go to?
Draco froze, all thoughts of tea and biscuits vanished from his mind. He jumped up, pulling Harry up with him, and sprinted off towards the castle. "We can make the Elixir," Draco muttered to him as he began to protest. Immediately, Harry shut up and suddenly it was Harry pulling Draco towards the castle.

They slowly resume their old stance- meeting casually, never planning to, but with more friendly banter, more inside jokes and smiles and true laughter.
"Well, when I walked into the Forbidden Forest in the Battle of Hogwarts, I used it to summon my parents and Sirius. Then, when I got close, I just- sorta- threw it aside, I suppose."

Above him, he heard a strangled shout of his name. What on earth? But he wouldn't let that distract him. After all, this was where he usually went wrong. He felt the lightening charm hit his body- so he was about a third of the way down.
"Swedish Fish," Potter told the gargoyle hiding the headmistress' office. It moved aside with a terrible screeching sound, revealing a long staircase. The two ascended at different paces; Potter was trying to take the steps three at a time, while Draco tried to take them one at a time. This resulted in the two tumbling over almost immediately. Draco wouldn't physically survive five months of this. He doubted he would stand five days.
"You're welcome. In any case, I learned- I mean, I remembered a new method to calm yourself. It's also a way of remembering things pretty well. And it's why I brought you-" he gestured to the home around him- "This.

Pansy looked aghast. "
Draco's breath caught in his throat, but he slowly undid his buttons with shaking hands. He shrugged off the silk, letting it crumple in a pile on the floor. He still wasn't looking back at Potter. It was fine. He was safe.
"Okay. And even if we do get out, how are you planning on getting me to shut up about who made the potions?" He smirked at Draco. "What'll you do? Kiss me?"
finished, Draco was still protesting that he was "
And then Potter- dense, dense Potter- seems to finally realise what this conversation is about, even if he doesn't fully comprehend how much this is frightening Draco, or why, but enough to say, "C'mon, Malfoy. She's just a grass snake. Barely the length of my forearm. She doesn't bite, promise- d'you- I could hold her while you stroked her, if you want, she wouldn't move a muscle if I told her not to-" And he looks so earnest, and that's not what Potter is to Malfoy, he doesn't look so- so

"Anyone got Floo powder?" Zabini asked.
"Draco!" Pansy exclaimed. "Oh, perfect, I was just thinking about the Christmas shopping we all need to get done." Draco glared at Blaise for involving him in Pansy's dreaded shopping spree. Blaise grinned back at him. "None of us have done much yet, so we're all going out after lunch to Hogsmeade. I know for a fact that you haven't bought your annual Potter Present, so you'll be coming too. Lovely. Anyway, as I was saying-"

Ron just picked up one of the long branches, fallen from the tree, and (avoiding the flailing branches of the tree) hit the knot at its base. The tree stopped moving, and Ron entered the dark tunnel, trusting Hermione to lead the others after him.
"Well, you see, Harry's gone missing-" Ron managed to get out before both Hermione and McGonagall interrupted him.
Jisky hesitated for only a moment before nodding. She led the boys out of the room, still sniffling quietly, and made her way down to the cellars.

bed. He could only barely see, though- he was almost blinded by sunlight streaming in through the window. "Morning," Harry said. He lifted up his fist, blinding Draco further as the light glinted off of something in his hand. Something... red. Red like the sky he remembered escaping. The realisation of what it was hit him like that punch from Granger in third year.
couldn't portray Potter's eyes quite right. (He'd picked it up again during sixth year, though, as a sort of coping mechanism. His skills improved drastically.) What had been entertaining for his friends to watch during this time was that Draco had often antagonised Potter just to see a certain shade of green, or to see how the light hit his eyes at specific moments; to how he talked, to his tells when he was lying to how far he went when you insulted his family (Draco knew that one from personal experience; it'd been one of the first owls he'd sent home containing a Potter Fact in first year).
Draco, still half-turned around, fell, as the staircase flattened out and turned into a ramp. He scrambled for purchase, clawing at the walls, as Potter slipped back slightly. For the second time, Draco fell onto Potter.
What did he want Draco to say?
He modelled this outfit slower than he had the others, more delicately. He walked down the left side of the aisle, passing the group, who were silent, their faces painted with identical looks of awe. Harry's mouth was hanging open, Draco noted. He smiled to himself as he walked.
Harry hesitated a moment before entering. Too focused on Jisky, Draco didn't notice.
"Say, why are you being so- I mean, this must've taken ages. It's accurate to my real home, as far as I can tell. Just- um- why?"
"Er, right. And, the incantation is..?"

No, Draco Malfoy didn't love Harry Potter.

"Don't know; at least another two day-"
"Actually, yeah," Potter said.
"I'm sorry for the fiendfyre; for the deaths of anyone who you knew and held dear. I know that not many people get affection from you... I'm sorry for those who did that are- that are dead.
"Er," Potter said, "I'm not sure."
and said, "Don't worry about me. I couldn't even begin to tell you half the rules I've broken for people I love; and if I still had a mother when I was in Hogwarts," he adds a little more quietly, "I'd want her to do anything she could to see me after i was injured. Even if that meant breaking the law."
"Room of Requirement." The idea had come to Draco last night as he's been wandering the shores of the Lake, pondering what he knew about the Stone, and he'd remembered when Potter had taken him to the Room, and changed it to how he needed it to be. Draco had moved all the plants himself, before he returned to bed- and he hadn't asked McGonagall, but he hadn't told her where he was brewing potions and growing plants before and she'd found him.
"Er-" her gaze flickered to Draco. "Well, um, I can't say, they asked us to keep their identity a secret."

After that, Draco, Ronald and Pansy travelled to Scrivenshaft's for quills while Hermione and Blaise went off to Tomes and Scrolls to buy books and other such presents. "Bet you a galleon 'Mione will bring back at least three books that she's bought for herself," Ronald muttered to Draco.
Draco threw his hands in the air, turning back to face Potter. "And just
Oh, Merlin.
And Draco understood.
He narrowed his eyes at Draco. "Are you okay? Are you under the Imperius curse?"
"Maybe. Well, Ill go get Granger. Wait down here."
"Well, what can I say," he said, starting to smile. "Common sense. Beats talent, skill and pure dumb luck every time."
Parkinson stepped up to the door first; she opened it with a flick of her wand. The group entered silently, avoiding the portrait of Walburga Black, making their way into the living room- well, they started to, but Parkinson and Hermione (leading the group) both stopped in the doorway so abruptly that Ron walked into Zabini. "Bloody hell," Ron muttered. Parkinson and Hermione immediately turned around and shushed him, then tiptoed further into the living room. So they were being quiet, then? Okay.
"Oh my
After a long trek up moving, winding staircases, Draco encountered his newest problem. The gargoyle that guarded the entryway to the Headmaster's office. And Draco didn't know the password. He was certain he didn't know enough about McGonagall to even attempt to guess the answer, so he sank down onto the floor to wait for someone to come by.
"Now, think of your unhappiest memory. That could be something to do with Voldemort, or your nightmares; it could be sad, or angry. Imagine it in as much detail as you can, even if it hurts. This has to be your
And then Harry remembered why he was out here- it was a good stress reliever after a nightmare, but apart from that, Malfoy was up to something. That got harder and harder to believe, though, as Harry drifted closer.
"Youshouldreallywearmakeupanddressesmoreoftenyoulookastonishing," Harry said, all very quickly.
Draco knew this from years of observation and seven years of friendship respectively; for the first, slightly flushed cheeks, almost indistinguishable from their usual dark shade, fidgety, fiddling hands and a tapping foot, eyes darting nervously around, pushing round glasses up their nose, and chewing on their bottom lip were all obvious tells of embarrassment. For the second, the smirk was wider than the usual sardonic one, the right side pulled up ever so slightly more, the chin was tilted up defiantly to look down the nose at the other even though they were several inches shorter.
his face!
As soon as the word "mother" left Potter's mouth, Narcissa strolled in through the doors, looking for all the world like the regal lady of the Malfoy family- but Draco (having grown up with her) saw how her pace was slightly accelerated, and how her lips were pursed, and her brow furrowed, rather than her face being the usual smooth mask the Malfoys had learned and cultivated. There was even a crease in her dress. When she saw that Draco was alright- and that he had visitors- she paused for only a moment (in relief) before continuing towards them in her usual manner, the way she presented herself to the public.
Pansy gave Blaise a triumphant look. "Pay up, darling, pay up." As Blaise reluctantly gave her a few galleons, she said, "Honestly, Draco, you disappear for a week, then you steal Potter from the Gryffindors, and you don't even say hello?"
"That's what

Draco's eyes widened and his breath caught; he stiffened, paling against Harry's dark-skinned hand.
The room was a comforting array of cool, dark tones- blues and greens scattered across the wall in such a formation that they looked like sunlight, dancing through water. Harry rubbed his eyes and realised that the colours were moving on the wall. Why was Harry surprised? He'd lived in the Wizarding world since he was 11. Still, to have the paint move across the wall- and not have a conscience- seemed strange. Well, it was pretty, Harry supposed.

Maybe there are arguments. Maybe there are insults. But maybe, now, there are also apologies and regrets that help balance everything out.
He wasn't at breakfast the next morning to see Potter looking for him, a "theoretical" question about sleeping potions and draughts of death and fatal potions on the tip of his tongue. (Although Pansy and Blaise were, and shot each other a knowing look and an eye roll.)

He could try and help.
He turned sad. "No, she isn't. She died before she could add her memories to mine to join me here..."
Draco glanced around one last time. Severus and Dumbledore were watching him expectantly; Fawkes was now playing with a cat with round, spectacle-shaped markings around its eyes; McGonagall had disappeared, the papers she'd been reading still on her desk. Draco leaned forwards, and, with a rather awful tumbling sensation, fell into Dumbledore's memory- and straight into Harry Potter.
He somehow managed to not throw up when his feet hit the ground again; probably helped a lot that he had retained all his bodily parts this time. (He did do a double-check, just in case, and found himself fine.)
Ripples spread out across the lake, and then a series of splashes preceded the arrival of something swimming to the shore.
She gave him a pitiful smile that Draco could tell she didn't mean. "Sorry, Harry, it is."
Draco smiled. It was working! "Alright, I've got some work for you. Every night, before you go to bed, try this exercise to calm you down. When you're doing the breathing exercise, think of your happy memory. If you wake up from a nightmare, try this, too; it might help you get back to sleep."
No, Harry Potter isn't perfect. But then, who is?
Harry thought about how he hadn't known until he was seventeen. But that wasn't his fault! In any case.
"Yeah. Hey, what do you guys think we'll get this year? I hope I get something good... Last year I just got clothes."
Draco told himself it was only Viv who wanted them, and not himself.

As Potter settled away from the fire on the floor next to a seat, he gestured for Draco to join him. Draco did, after a moment of deliberation; only he sat next to the fire and floo powder. Just in case. He realised, very quickly, how hot he would get in his robes, sat in such close proximity to the blazing fire. He shrugged off his robes, and, after a moment, his jumper. As he did this, his white school shirt (silk, obviously) slipped up; he knew this from Potter's sharp inhale.
"Gentlemen?" asked a voice behind him. Draco spun around, attempting to quench his laughter (and failing, quite badly) to see McGonagall, one eyebrow arched inquisitively, looking on at the scene; Potter, sat in a rocking chair, holding a potted plant, Draco, laughing, a pile of children's books on the floor.
Hermione opened her present and got her quill and paperweight; she immediately set about writing something or other in the Never-Ending Notebook she'd received from Harry.
A little unnerved, Draco moved closer to the first mirror-Harry he'd seen. He shuffled over, right next to the mirror, and rested his fingertips on the glass. Who was this strange Harry, separated from him by a layer of glass, who smiled at him like nothing else mattered, like he thought Draco was-
"Yeah, we're- well done, Draco. Well done."
He watched as Malfoy set foot on the stairs.
Potter turned, holding the recipe, and walked out the door without a backwards glance.
dominant hand free, he could do things like more precise cutting. He wouldn't shut up, though, constantly on about what was going on and what he was thinking. Still, the potion was now ready to sit and brew for three months; Draco had added the ingredient that grew only by moonlight, and he should only have to wait a while longer until he could separate from Harry.

Well, he was going to fix it.
He absolutely didn't know what Malfoy's eating habits were, and he definitely didn't steal a green apple- specifically green- from the kitchens to take down to Malfoy because it was the

being the one to talk about him.
The record was recorded on a little yellow erasable post-it note, enchanted to never fall down, and was stuck on the notice board in the Slytherin common room. To Draco specifically, it was nothing more than a reminder to somebody that Quidditch practice was on Thursday; it was a pitifully simple concealment charm, and applied only to Draco. He could probably break it with ease if he knew it was there. So the players of the game were careful not to let slip the true contents of the note.

He grinned.
Draco shifted uncomfortably. "No, I- I didn't know if you were done with it, and I didn't want to give it over without your permission. After all, you have the dead family members, not me."

Potter emerged from the tops of the stairs, holding a weathered piece of parchment that Draco had hoped he'd find. "How'd you get this?"

He felt a rush of air next to him, and the folds of fabric rustled against his fingers.
Being a good Slytherin, he came up with an entirely plausible excuse.
, Draco,
"Yeah," Zabini added. "We're in."
Draco told himself he didn't care.
Draco spent quite some time continuing to test the potion; whether it was poisonous, or possibly toxic in any way at all, and if it still had the same effects when duplicated (it did, thank goodness. Draco wouldn't have to keep brewing more and more batches of it as long as he kept one vial of the original batch) before moving on to administering it to Harry and himself to check for effects from differently sized doses. It seemed to work just as well as the normal Draught- even better, if Draco did say so himself- and when their testing session was over, Draco and Harry were no more addicted to the potion than they had been when they began.
Harry shot out of bed and down to the common room. Sure enough, the windows there stretched from floor to ceiling, providing a magnificent view of the grounds. Through them, he spotted a small shining pinprick of blonde hair.
Maybe they tell the public.
"Why did your wand just nearly take my nose off?!" She asked. Potter sat there, holding Draco's wand in his hand, looking rather guilty. He hurriedly hid the wand behind his back, putting on the worst
There was a perch, where a fully-feathered Fawkes trilled in greeting. On the desk was a considerably large jar on the desk, filled with- cat hairs?- and a box, which held a whole cat. Potter drew out a piece of parchment from his back pocket, muttered something at it, and opened it up. He frowned and said, "I don't understand. It says she's right here, on the desk."
"Well, do that but with people. Get out of the Room of Requirement, get back into Hogwarts; start going to lessons and all again. But pay attention to your friends. To anyone you want to put into your house, really. Memorise them. Little things they do when they're bored, how they fiddle, what they like to eat, their speech patterns; memorise them."
' even as the ink spread, painting the map of Hogwarts he'd pored over for hours at a time, searching for the very name he was looking for now. When the map had fully unfolded, Harry frowned.
He refused to look at Pansy and Blaise, although he could feel their triumphant gazes burning a hole in the side of his head. Nevertheless, he had a task to complete.

"Ah, Mr. Malfoy," Flamel greeted him. "I presume you have the Stone?"
It was a normal day in the Great Hall, where the Slytherins were sat eating breakfast, trying to block out the noise of Draco (who had not learned his lesson in the slightest) droning on about Potter.
"I am ready to die," he said again, pulling the snitch closer to his lips, so that Hermione and Ron finally took notice of it.
"Right here," Flamel said irritably.
Another half hour later, Draco could've sworn his fingers were going blue.
And he hates how quiet, subdued his voice is, but Potter is smirking and saying, "I knew it'd get you to do it- and it worked, didn't it?"
When he was sure he was out of sight, he changed into the pink skirt. It was lovely; so free and loose and swirly. He twirled again and again, watching how it flew out around him; when Pansy came looking for him, she applauded him, then walked him back into the Hall. All eyes were on him as he settled back down again, giving Harry an almost-shy grin and mouthing "Thank you," at him.

"I'm- I'm sorry for the insults, for the judgement, for never giving you a second chance, for the War, and for Voldemort; I'm sorry for never trying to help you, never trying to get you out, for abandoning you, and I'm sorry for the jests and the fights and the curses and for judging you from the
He didn't hear Malfoy's sharp intake of breath next to him, didn't see how the hand he'd been reaching towards Harry jerked away.
"'Mione. Look at the Slytherin table."
"Guys," Potter said. "Sorry to interrupt your bonding, but we have a Hallow to look for. 'Mione, why don't you try spells? Malfoy and I can talk you through what happened as you try them."
Draco tucked his wand into the inside pocket of his furry grey coat, bent over and joined him, rustling through the leaves with his hands.
Beside him, Draco had fallen asleep. Harry glanced at him; his robes were in tatters (he would be angry later, when he woke up) but they seemed to have sustained most of the damage. As far as Harry could see, he was unharmed physically.
, and you need to stop this obsession-"
"Okay. But, if you hadn't noticed, Dumbledore is sort of dead. Can you bring him back from the grave?"
? Scratch that- you're
Potter pointed his wand at the parchment and said, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." The parchment unfurled, ink spreading across it, painting a labyrinth of lines across the parchment. Draco watched it form a map of- of Hogwarts?
Maybe the public is in outrage.
)) wanted to.
Harry Potter. It had turned out that the Potters had a cupboard under the stairs, too; and while theirs had been full of canned provisions- likely in case they'd needed to fully shut down to hide from Voldemort- Draco hadn't felt right leaving it in this remodelled home, a visual reminder of Potter's childhood abuse. Especially not with what Draco had designed this place for.
Potter stepped forwards, holding the stone in one hand, the other open for the recipe. Flamel passed the photo, eyes fixed on the Resurrection stone. He took it from Potter's hand almost gingerly. "Alright," he said. "That's everything. Go on, now, off you go."
Draco's eyebrows shot up. "Okay,
! How did they even
The list itself was comprised of:
"Now, take your five objects. In your mind, starting at the doorway, make your way around the room again; as you do, place your five things. Go around the room again. Make sure you know those objects, and where they are. Always walk the same path past them to remember them best.
"So, um, I was trying to make a - a potion that can fix that. I got permission from McGonagall, and I'm using Snape's old classroom and his ingredients. I'm just experimenting, but..."
. Just another adaptation of himself.
reasonable that Draco immediately stiffened- Potter flinched back in surprise- and Draco took the moment to bolt out of the Room like a frightened bunny.
"Obviously," Draco muttered under his breath. Potter ignored him. Wow, his self-restraint had increased drastically since first year.
"We have to change, to best suit ourselves to our situation; must make it reflect on us well, must make it benefit us," his mother said. Draco didn't particularly like the change. He didn't like the way that he constantly was having to change. Change his attitude, his wording, his personality, his mind.
"Ooh, was that a threat, Weasley?"
At this, Harry full-on laughed, just as Draco had hoped he would. But the story wasn't over yet.
Potter blinked. "Er, yeah, I suppose so."
Pansy grabbed Draco by the sleeve and tugged him along after her, even though he resisted all the way to the Great Hall doors. Just as he was leaving, Harry walked in. "Save me!" Draco cried; but Potter, useless git he is, just stood and watched Draco be dragged away to be tortured. Tortured how, you ask? Shopping with Pansy Parkinson.
Could Draco have said it better? Gryffindors, honestly. Draco sighed. "Alright, Potter. You blink when you're confused. You get quiet after a nightmare. You trace your scars when remembering them or what gave you them. Whenever someone mentions something you don't like, you close off completely- it's actually a little scary. When someone brings up a dead person who fought for you, you turn your head a little to the left, like you're trying to turn away from the conversation. You're almost always looking over your shoulder, and when you go round a blind corner, you hesitate a moment. You stand in your duelling position, with your left foot in front of your right-" and Draco cut himself off there, because he was revealing that he knew far too much about Potter, and
"Well,
fight?"
The war is over.
The eighth years gathered in the Great Hall again that night, discussing who might've made the potions. Harry was being badgered with questions, and had been for most of the day; everyone wanted to know who'd succeeded where so many others had failed. Harry had kept the truth from the school for most of the day, but now he was being asked by his closest friends, and Draco could tell he was close to cracking. He decided to just keep an eye on Harry to make sure he didn't say anything, but otherwise continued his hushed conversation with Pansy.
"My dad never did like the rules," Potter said in response, as if that explained everything.
"Potter," he managed to choke out, "Sweet
Then Pansy (who Draco suspected had finished buying her-
," Harry whispered. There was a click, and then the window swung open away from him.
Meanwhile, Draco and Harry left the room, talking excitedly about what they ("Me, mostly," Draco reminded Harry) had done. Draco was positively bursting with excitement. He was the best potioneer alive! Merlin, Mother would be so proud! Snape, too- Draco froze midstep. Harry stopped with him, looking confused and worried and ever-so-slightly-scared, but Draco's mind was entirely occupied by another matter entirely.
He'd had Harry come and sit with him, and Harry added a few more recent ones; ones that Draco hadn't even had long enough to really notice. They were far more similar than the ones he used to have, and incredibly different to how he used to be.
With an exasperated, very much put-upon sigh, Draco followed.
Malfoy would be sure to eat- no, that was
"Blaise, where did I find the mirror shard?"
"A broom!" he shouted aloud. Somehow, Harry heard him over the whistle of the wind; comprehension spread across his face. He was already holding his wand- still lit with Lumos- and pointed it straight up, behind Draco's back.
When he stepped off the broom, he fell face-first in a heap on the ground. The adrenaline had been a bit much; and his head was dizzy with victory. He could've sworn he heard a quiet snort, but, in his victory-clouded mind, he brushed it off as his own. Still smiling, he tried to get up and take a wobbly step; when he fell again, he resorted to just crawling back to the castle. Who cared if someone saw him? He'd just- he'd just performed that stunt!
"So then Quirrel fought me for the Stone, I ended up accidentally killing him-"
"Yeah, thank Salazar. If there wasn't I might just have chopped my hand off.
stuff this time."
Granger looked horrified. "You're testing this on- on living things?!"
and died-
Malfoy hesitated before answering this time. "Yeah, I do..."
"Hey!" he protested, patting down his hair. He'd stopped gelling it almost entirely this year; it was far fluffier than ever before. Draco found it was also easier to maintain, though when Pansy had declared him "Almost cute," he'd come very close to gelling it back again.
"Pansy! How
The door led into a cramped stone corridor. It was dark when Harry first entered, but when Draco shut the door behind him, a small bronze sconce flickered to life, lighting the passageway with a dimly flickering flame.
As Pansy stood next to Draco, admiring the newest additions to the board and seeing if Snape had added anything, she let her eyes flicker over to the Record. The eighth-year boys in Slytherin had had a sleepover last night; it wasn't a surprise that the time went up. It
," Ron said.
"Well, because I've used it, obviously."
Thankfully, Potter was oblivious and thought Draco had just been listing off his attributes, not revealing all the things he'd noticed.
"Is here okay, Malfoy?"
Faster than he thought was possible, Harry swung his broom around, leaning flat against the wood, and flew downwards in a nosedive- a Wronski Feint with no clear ending, he supposed. The wind was now pushing him downwards, making him go faster and faster and there!
And burst out laughing.
, at breakfast tomorrow."
He stepped forward. The cat looked up at him lazily. "Professor?" he asked. The cat flicked its tail and curled back up. "Bit rude," Draco muttered.
going to the
It was Draco Lucius Malfoy who finally brought Harry back.
. . .
"My name is Draco Malfoy, and I am an aspiring Potioneer. I attempted- am attempting- to make a derivative of the Dreamless Sleep potion that is non-addictive.
"Uh oh," Harry said from beside Draco, grinning.
- without McGonagall knowing, Harry really couldn't say.
, Malfoy?"
McGonagall turned to her. "
This wasn't where they'd appeared last time.
He didn't see Malfoy's confusion as to why, when they saw the snitch, Hermione and Ron froze, then looked towards Harry to confirm it was the snitch they thought it was. All four of them watched as the snitch's surface turned and changed until it opened, revealing a small, open space where a stone once sat.
"Right... So you joined the Gryffindors because you missed me and they missed Potter?"
"I have another present for you," Draco told him as he opened the door. Harry shot him a surprised glance and made his way into the classroom to open it. It sat on the nearest desk, wrapped carefully with air holes poked in the top.
"Brilliant!" Potter exclaimed.
Draco continued to ignore him, watching the little blobs moving across the wall.
"Draco," he said again, and this time his voice was soft. "When was the last time you ate?"
from where it previously stood at just over 2 hours; it was now at 6 hours, 23 minutes and 18 seconds. Dear
He had, instead, gone straight back down to his potions room to have a look at his mandrake samplings. The one with the normal Dreamless sleep had awoken; it was writhing around again, and would be able to be reused for another test. It would be slightly altered, though; it would always want for more Dreamless sleep. Addicted to the unicorn's blood.
"Young Master Draco?" said a timid little voice.
"Alright, mate." He turned to Draco. "You can go, then. But if you do absolutely
By this time, the students had grown slightly used to the biggest nemesi of the school going around hand-in-hand, so Draco and Harry had started eating in the Hall again.
Harry groaned, along with Weasley- Ron- sat next to him, but shook his head.
It looked rather... Familiar, so close up.
"Well, yeah, but what if something happens?"
The two argued (obviously) and came to the decision that they would sleep in Draco's bed every other night, and Potter's the rest of the time.
"Well, the Resurrection stone. It does only bring back a spectral version of the person, but... Well, you're Nicholas Flamel. Surely you could come up with a way to make it permanent and full."
. Right, my turn.)
And- nearly every time Draco talked about Potter, actually.
books; Pansy took her winnings from the scowling boys with a sugar-sweet smile.)
The heat from the flame was potentially deadly now; he renewed his protection charms around himself and the area.
He instead mimed writing with a quill, then gestured at Potter. He never took unnecessary items to class, and they rarely ever did writing now in eighth year; just spells. Potter withdrew a quill and a piece of parchment from his bag and handed them to Draco, who wrote,
But, yes, it was a chilly night; it made Draco long for his bed, soft and warm. He collected the Mandrake snippings drowsily; didn't really remember making his way down to the potions classroom and storing all the snippings. Next thing he knew, he was crawling into bed and falling asleep, forgetful of the nightmares lurking in the darkness of the night.
"Oh, Merlin. Harry- yes,
Harry turned to Draco smiling that special smile of his. "Thank you, Draco," he said. "Thank you so, so much."
Now, he didn't cry.
Unlike the popular opinion, Harry Potter wasn't perfect. In fact, he was far from it.
Draco made his way downstairs cautiously.` On the wall of the entryway hall, a large blanket had been thrown off to reveal a portrait- the source of the screeching. The label read
Then Harry stood and gave himself a quick check-over; in the midst of action, when he was full of adrenaline, Harry often gave little notice to injuries he sustained. They usually went entirely unnoticed until somebody else pointed them out. He stretched, checking his muscles; then brushed his hands down his body to check for blood. He found none, but he was pretty sure he'd bruised his tailbone when he'd fallen down into the room of Mirrors of Erised; it ached, especially when sat back down again.
"Did you give Flamel the stone?" Potter asked, slipping on his glasses.
"Who are you and what have you done with my friends?" Draco asked them. "
Nonetheless, he turned back to Flamel and said, "No, thank you, I'll wait for my companion to awaken."
for Potter to be the one to help him, despite him being absolutely
Snape, watching on from the side, said, "Yes, Draco, they all are. Every single one. Absolutely insufferable, the lot of them."
Still out of breath and panting, he assumed his own battling stance.
"Thank you, Draco," she said. "Thank you."
set Madame Pomfrey off. She started berating Snape (who looked already hungover and drunk, and had his hands over his ears to block out the noise) for such terrible manners and terrible control of his students, and then Pansy, Blaise and about fifteen other Slytherins came wobbling into the great hall, giggling and crying and heading in the general direction of Malfoy. They were warbling a- a song?
Harry flew into the air; Hermione set him down beside the imprint in the snow he'd made. "Ooh, it's a good one!"
"Wake them up?!" Ron said, his voice muffled by Hermione's hand. "'Mione, are you seeing what I'm seeing? They are asleep together! Hermione, they are
"Darling, you can't hide things. Spit it out."
"No," Ron said. "We were wondering if you knew where he was, or if you could find out."
But in any case.
, and he's not sixteen anymore- although when he
Draco's mind was whirling. He'd- he'd held such power, and not even
Harry reached out and wrapped his arms around Draco suddenly, buried his head in Draco's shoulder, still bare, his gasping breaths and his dark skin as hot as the fire that still burned in the fireplace. Draco didn't even hesitate before wrapping his arms around Harry in return, burying his head in the mess of black hair- just as soft as Draco had expected it to be. He didn't hesitate in his decision to keep holding Harry, long after both of them had stopped crying. He didn't flinch when Harry's arms randomly tightened around him.
The tug got stronger.
He stepped out into the cold air; it was dark tonight.
"Er- yeah, I did. But, well, we need it as a bargaining chip against Flamel for the Philosopher's Stone, and we need help to find it. So... Help?"
Cloudy, too; the moon's light was diluted and the stars were invisible. Perhaps he'd go to bed afterwards, instead of returning to the potions room. He could leave the wards up, and return to work all of tomorrow; he'd done all of his homework but his Transfiguration essay, and he'd half-arsed that already, it just needed some editing.
?- bolted upright, already reaching for his wand, while the snake recoiled, backing into Potter's nest of hair. Had he even tried to brush his hair
It was a snake.
He turned away from Harry and sprinted down the corridor, not registering Harry's shouts for him to "Wait, Draco!" in his haste to find out just how screwed he was.
"And, while I can tell you that, I am, unfortunately, unable to say anything else; I do not even know anything else, in this form." He gestured to his painted body. "Perhaps, though, there may be some choice memories by my pensieve you could view? I give my full permission for you to do so."
It- it is a

Draco had a sudden and incredibly inappropriate flashback to one night with Pansy in the Slytherin dormitories; the night he'd come out to her as gay. She'd given him that oh-so-infuriating look and asked, slyly, who'd been his "awakening". She'd then spent the next ten minutes trying to convince Draco he was gay for
"'Mione," he said, that night in the Gryffindor common room. Hermione hummed in acknowledgement, but didn't move even to put her book down. "'Mione, Harry's been gone for hours," he tried.
Harry had had enough of cupboards before he was even
Hermione seemed just as surprised; she was so shocked, she didn't move to stop Malfoy from grabbing her arm and pulling her outside. Harry, obviously, followed. Who knew what Malfoy could be up to now? The flowers could be poisonous!
and he is going to
"Impressive. Why did you bring me out here, though? To show me a map?"
"Potter," Draco spat, the way he always did; but it was lacking in its hatred, its disgust. It sounded half-hearted, and- forced.
Now, Draco's parents weren't really dead; Lucius may as well have been, having been given a life sentence in Azkaban, bu Narcissa was only on house arrest for a year, and without magic for the same amount of time; but she'd been more closed off after the War. Draco was pretty much alone, in terms of family. Family by blood, at least.
"You're too stiff," Hermione told him. "Loosen up. Relax. If you're worried about your clothes getting wet or rumpled- well, we're magical. We have drying charms and ironing charms. Have some fun, Malfoy."
"No, Draco," Harry interrupted. "Really. Come down. You'll want to see this."
The excuse of a teacher agreed with Potter immediately, obviously, and Draco prepared himself to spend an hour practicing something he'd mastered in first year. He wondered if he could cast the spell wordlessly. Since Pansy still hadn't un-silenced him, he supposed he'd find out.
"Well, er, I could go get a snitch or something and stay away from you? It's a good night for Quidditch, I don't really wanna waste it." Malfoy waved Harry away with a roll of his eyes. Harry sighed, but flew down to the Quidditch sheds, where all the Quidditch equipment was. He pulled out the case Oliver Wood had shown him, back in first year, and opened it to find the snitch's compartment empty.
The mandrake was dead.
"You can almost feel it," Pansy said one morning at the Slytherin table, munching on a slice of buttered toast. "And you can definitely smell it, what with the early snow arriving and all the mince pies the elves have been making."
"Oh, Merlin," Blaise said from beside him. Draco inclined his head in his direction ever so slightly. "I- this is literally
. No, I mean it.
Draco's eyes caught on a stack of story books piled on a table next to Viv; the same books Harry had read to her before. Draco looked around, just to make sure no one was watching him, then pulled up a chair next to Viv and began reading to her in a hushed voice.
Harry skipped over that. "Well, you don't like missing lessons. And I
, Pansy," she said disapprovingly, "What are you
Then it hit Harry that Draco was gone, running away from him, and was probably going to keep running until he was far away unless Harry stopped him. So Harry ran.
"Really, people are supposed to be there to prompt you, to make you think a certain way. So a Hufflepuff might be there to make you think more kindly, a Gryffindor to make you braver. A Ravenclaw to make you smarter, a Slytherin to help you achieve your goals. So, that's your mission for the next-" he glanced at the potion- "two days. After that, I'll need you to supervise me with the potion in case something goes wrong. But till then, off with you. Go learn some people, inside and out."
"But- Hogwarts is unplottable!"
"Alright, Potter," he said at last. "It's a deal."
I'll win against Potter
He hurtled away at the ground, such a quick contrast from hurtling towards it he felt dizzy. As he rose again, his leg brushed past something sort of scaly and rough- when he looked back, nothing was there.
"Jisky, Jisky," he said soothingly, "Don't punish yourself. I'm not mad. C'mon, let's head down to the cellars and I'll get you some food, okay?"
"Yeah," Potter started to say, grinning triumphantly, but Draco interrupted.
- anyway. Fifth year- a leftover Potter Stinks badge you found. You know, when Pansy gave you that and suggested you give it to Potter, she'd enchanted it so instead of supporting Diggory, the other side declared your love for Potter."
"Why do you know when he last practiced, Draco?"
And then, so his future self or any other potions masters who may read this in the future to parade his brilliant work didn't get confused, Draco wrote, very slowly,
This one was one of the weak-willed pansies that bent to Potter's every will.
The next morning, the Golden trio walked into the Great Hall happy as usual. Ron and Harry were discussing Quidditch tactics while Hermione read her newest book- something about a cupboard and a secret world and some sort of talking lion.
At about midnight, there had been a
. Yes, I think we are visible."
in that time period?
It appeared that while the day had passed faster than imaginable, the night was taking twice as long as usual. Draco tossed and turned for a good hour or two before finally dropping off into a fitful sleep.
When he reached the end of the aisle, he performed a slow turn for the group; Pansy applauded him, which seemed to awaken the rest. Excluding Harry, who was looking at Draco, still open-mouthed, like Draco was the most perfect thing in the world, they all started to cheer and clap; Draco grinned at them as he made his second passage down along the right side of the corridor, on the other side of the bench the group were sitting on. He stopped in front of Harry, who was still staring at him, and gave him a small curtsey, slightly pulling up the hem of the dress so it didn't get caught.
He picked up his silver knife- sharpened razor-thin- and took a deep breath. He held Viv's main stem still as he carefully- oh so carefully- cut off the largest of her leaves. She started wailing, but Draco couldn't wait and calm her; her biological structure and adaptations meant that any of the plant left exposed to the air would seal itself up quickly. Including the bit of plant Draco was holding. He knew Viv would be fine.
!"), they insisted Harry open the largest one first. It was a rather peculiar shape, and roughly the same size as Harry. He undid the spectacularly large ribbon atop it, then tore away the paper at the top.
"It can," Draco moaned. "The main ingredients can only be picked at the full moon, and I bet that Snape's supply is all out... When's the next full moon?"
"Um- yeah, no, the potion's fine, nothing happened, just-" his head ached just thinking of the brutal verbal lashing he'd received- "I, um, forgot to take Snape down to watch as we made the potion, and he wasn't happy about it. I decided I should go get the telling-off lecture now before he gets even worse, which is what took me so long."
"I believe I've found the solution- the unicorn's blood. I believe the blood, instead of cursing the drinker, makes them addicted to the potion. But the unicorn's blood also counters the fatal bits of the potion. I took the unicorn's blood out to remove the addictive attributes, but I can't find anything stronger to replace it to keep the drinker alive... And so I went to the smartest girl in our year for help." Potter gave Draco a strange look.
were to know the layout of Hogwarts, it would be her.
, Malfoy!"
Draco turned around to thank Potter for saving him when a heavy weight slumped against his back- he looked over his shoulder, alarmed, to find Potter- had he passed out?- resting against him. Draco sighed.
Ron himself was having an internal battle, which continued even as Parkinson led the group back out, and as the group returned to Hogwarts. He hated Malfoy. They ferrety git had insulted him and his family for all of his life. He'd been prejudiced and rude towards Hermione- well, he
Harry jumped forwards in excitement, falling on the ground; as Draco went to make sure he was okay, he began doing what Ronald was, only... Faster. After a few seconds, he called out, "Levitate me!"
"The last one was last night, actually."
Maybe more gifts are given and received. Maybe birthday gifts and well-wishes are sent. Maybe there are sweets, and smiles, and laughs.
. I'm going to practice Quidditch for the tournament."
, Merlin forbid
((I'm still pissed.) I know, I'm sorry. (You had no right to be that sweet about me.) It's all true, though. (Yeah, I'm not denying that. Anyway. What's the last one?) Umm... You now. (I'm still mad from before, but- you write this one. You can probably describe me better than I can. I'm not moving from here, though. I'll watch and listen to you the whole time.))
Flamel's windows were lit, curtains parted once more. Draco stepped through the wall.
He'd always been a bit rebellious, and Potter always made him fly off the wall; but he was here now, and his pride wouldn't let him back down, so he marched forwards, around the mini-Creevey, and faces Potter, with his shoulders squared, and waited for his silver tongue to get to work. It didn't- it really didn't. It turned to lead, and then Draco was just stood there in front of Potter, wordless, looking like a right idiot in front of what must have be a good couple of hundred people.
He sat up, grabbed on his glasses, and pulled aside his covers and the drapes around his bed.
hung up on when you rejected me in first year- when I was being an absolute
"I'm sorry for insulting your parents, your parental figures, your friends, your mentors. I'm sorry for betraying you and all of your friends by joining Voldemort. I'm sorry for- the bathroom incident. In fact, I'm sorry for all of sixth year.
He continued looking over the room, seated on the edge of Draco's bed. He saw a black cabinet and a matching bookshelf, a dark blue door he assumed was the exit of the room, and- upon closer inspection- another door, blended into the walls by the same paint and patterns which led to an en-suite bathroom. It had a bath like the one in the prefects' room at Hogwarts, with many differently coloured taps. Harry closed the door quietly and thought with a frown that it seemed far too bright; he noticed a window was open, and the sun was rising in the distance. It couldn't be morning
Harry laughed; upon realising he had done, he looked at Draco as though Draco were a miracle-maker. Then he beamed at Draco; the same blinding smile Mirror-Harry had given him in the Land of the Aurae. Draco felt physically shaken.
Draco's eyes glinted dangerously. "Potter..."
Then Potter stood.

have those little hammer things you use to smash glass in case of emergency- wait.
He grabbed his notebook and quill before he left the room, planning out everything he was going to do the next day, once the Mandrake roots had had plenty of time to react and wake up.
. You're
Potter set off, headed for the kitchens, and Draco retreated to the potions room, where Viv had started crying. As he hushed her, he heard a cry from the House (as he had dubbed the adjoining space). Potter stumbled out of the room a little later, holding a trunk. Oh, so he'd found that, too. Good. It'd taken Draco a while to find it, and it'd been a pain to haul it from the outskirts of Hogwarts to the Room of Requirement, but Potter was very clearly happy with it. He hugged it tight, held Draco's eyes confidently, even as his voice broke as he told him, almost reverently, "Thank you."
Potter didn't even try to deny it. Draco started laughing again. McGonagall turned on him.
Potter sighed and turned to Draco. "Please can we get Ron? It would go faster, and I'm sure you're tired of searching like this..."
, he was
Flamel's head shot up. "What do you mean? Actually, how are you here if Albus is- is dead?"
"Potter, look," Draco said. He set off in the direction of the cottage, not waiting for Potter.
While attached to him, he had gained a certain sort of... fondness for him, though. He was such an idiot, so oblivious... Actually, no, that was just annoying. But he was far better as a friend than he was as an arch-nemesis.
Draco blushed bright pink. It looked far too much like what he'd seen in the Mirror of Erised. Beside him, Harry was blushing again too... But neither of them made any move to change the snowmen.
Harry blinked. "My... The Marauders' Map?"
Potter went ahead of him; about halfway there, he froze. He was staring at something in the forest, far enough away that Draco couldn't see. He made his way over to Potter; when he saw what Potter had, he froze, too.
Draco was miserable, having had nearly no sleep the previous night. Pansy and Blaise, thankfully, picked up on this, and were silent as the trio made their rounds of the grounds, letting Draco clear his mind as he wished. Then, the white noise of Hogwarts erupted in a cacophony of chaos, drawing the three's attention. "I bet you 10 galleons it's Potter," Draco said monotonically.
After a week, Malfoy still hadn't shown up for any classes or mealtimes, and Harry was starting to worry. Malfoy wouldn't skip a whole week of school willingly, even if he was sick. After all, when Malfoy
Draco opened his mouth in outrage to protest, but Pansy quietly silenced him before he could cause a disruption.
Oh, oh oh, oh,
"What?" Draco asked. "What is it?"
"Yeah. Dobby!" With a crack of apparition, Dobby appeared. "Could you get me a carrot, please?"
Harry also went back and forth between emotions faster than you could blink, especially after a nightmare when he was extra paranoid and vulnerable and defensive. All at the same time. The Gryffindors, bored without him, started a tally, too; they kept track of how many emotions Harry went through in one day, seeing who could record the highest amount. Draco ended up joining this competition when he heard about it; being with Harry all day, he obviously beat all the Gryffindors. Harry, in retaliation, joined the Slytherin's competition; thus, small inter-house friendships began to form.
"Oi!" Harry shouted. "That's mine!" But the elf just passed the wand to Draco and retreated.
As she was saying this, Snape (who had groaned as Malfoy had muttered that everything was Harry's fault) looked at Madame Pomfrey, Harry, and then stared at Draco as he took up his very own- was that a
Draco jumped as a sort of roar emanated from the teachers' snowball fight, followed by an almighty splash, and every single person out in the snow froze, looking to see what had happened.
"Come in," McGonagall said before Draco had even knocked. He opened the door and stepped inside. "Ah, Mr. Malfoy. What is it?" She was sat at the larger wooden desk, the phoenix perched next to her. She set down a stack of papers she was reading as Draco stepped further into the room.
," Harry replied immediately. When Draco gave him a surprised look at his quick response, he half-blushed and muttered, "I put it in my memory palace."
"You did?"
In all honesty, Draco had actually been considering giving Harry a present; especially now that they weren't proper enemies like before. In any case, Blaise had been lying about most of the presents; Draco had never even considered giving Harry the Malfoy heirloom, and the Flame had been for a Beauxbaton student to take back to France and give to an acquaintance of Draco's as a present. It was just
Harry nodded his agreement, staring at Draco with wide eyes.
done) before continuing his climb. By the time he'd made it to the top of the tree, Ronald had finally managed to lower himself to a branch below him, and was watching Draco. When he noticed Draco's attention on him, he called up, "Not bad, Malfoy."
He set up all the usual wards, letting people in but alerting him and identifying them, and protective wards around the ingredients and the cauldrons and the possible danger zone and himself.
"That's just a children's story, Potter. Everyone knows that. How do you produce to the Elixir of Life from the Stone?"

Harry smiled sadly. "I faced Death like an old friend," Harry told the snitch quietly. "I didn't want to die."
This seemed to sidetrack her. "Well- um-"
"Well, I can't tell you that, Professor, it's the secret to their success!"
"-and, in general, he's just angry that he wasn't involved. Oh, when I told him we'd succeeded, you should've
"Yeah, I did. Really early in the morning. I knew I wouldn't be getting back to sleep, so I came down here early."
Draco's eyes lit up at the sight of the heaps of presents awaiting him.
Draco let Potter take a day to familiarise and memorise his childhood home, storing each room in his mind palace, each room having the five main objects within it. Draco took this time to tend to his plants and to the base potion that would, hopefully, produce the Philosopher's stone.
He tried to turn around fully, but a pair of arms wrapped around his waist. "I'm here," Draco said; his voice was scratchy and hoarse, but his hold on Harry's waist was still strong. Harry was so relieved he didn't even try to argue that he hadn't been looking for Draco- after all, he had been. Draco had been the first thing he'd thought to look for after landing.
"Right, you're doing well. Now, go and do the same for all the other rooms. Five large, unique items and the room they're in. Travel the path of this room into the next, and once you've done a room, return to here with your first five objects and make sure you remember them all, and then go through your house in your mind again, always walking the same path. I'll just be in the other room if you need me."
"My- my apple?"
"No, I starve. Yes, Potter, I eat."

Harry could pinpoint the exact moment he knew something had gone wrong. It was when the presence at his back disappeared.
Hermione and Pansy grinned and shut the door.

"Wait, Potter, I don't want you to know the password. You already stalk me enough when I'm
He'd been flying the two- himself and Draco- upwards, into the wind, towards the sky, hoping he could be fast enough to escape the potion before- before- he didn't even know what would happen if they didn't get out, actually. He knew it was bad from the way Draco had reacted to the sky turning red, from the panic in his voice when he'd shouted for a broom. Before he'd joined Draco in the potion, he'd watched Draco prepare and enter it; Harry hadn't seen the exact warning on the parchment where Draco had written the instructions. He hadn't taken the time to read the new writing that appeared once Draco had disappeared, either; he'd gone in headfirst and unprepared, as per usual. If Hermione had been there, she would've given him that exasperated look she'd perfected for Harry and Ron over the years. When Harry succeeded nonetheless- he always had done- she'd always rolled her eyes and berated him for his lack of a plan. So Harry had to get out of here, or he probably wouldn't get to see Hermione do that ever again.
"Draco!"
He'd tried to go in chronological order as much as he could (because that might help with realising what there was, and why it was there, and because Draco just liked things to be organised, okay?) but had a voice-responsive quill write the list so he could add personal notes and additions as he wished.
"Well-"
and a shout of "It's
In his hand was a little photograph, a few-seconds-long loop, taken by Bathilda Bagshot on the day of Harry Potter's first birthday. In it, a little boy rode a tiny broomstick around the house, chased by his father, while his mother sat by, laughing.
"As if," Harry replied, but there was the slightest note of doubt in his voice. Obviously he hadn't read
An emerald tree boa, to be precise.
"If you think you're going off looking for Potter while Draco is missing and probably with him alone, you are sorely mistaken," Parkinson said.
The day had flown by; before he knew it, the sun was nearing the horizon, and only one present remained in front of Draco. It was from Harry.
"Malfoy, look-"
McGonagall, though incredibly worried, steeled herself, nodded, and shooed Ron and Hermione out of her office so she could start working on finding Harry.
When the sun's rays began to finally peak over the hills Draco and Potter had descended from, Draco decided enough was enough. He'd lost count of how many wards he'd cast; his eyes ached from observing the same landscape over and over. His skin prickled from the cold, his lips had long ago turned numb, and his fingers seemed frozen in a tight grip on his wand. Still, he hadn't left his position by Potter's side the entire night.
Maybe some of them knew this would happen from the very first day at school. Maybe money changes hands from bets that have been ongoing for over a decade, now. Hands of people in real life; and painted hands, too, and the hands of those long dead. They've all watched these boys grow up together, too.
"Oh, yeah. These are Valerian sprig-"
Beside him, Potter watched as the first few wolves slammed into the shield confusedly; he glanced at Draco, wand at the ready, and figured it out.
"Hopeless," Draco muttered under his breath, but Potter's bringing up loneliness had sparked an idea for him. "Say, Mr. Flamel,"
But what was the stone?
And sweat.

"So- you're famous. You're not hungry, or poor, or in need of anything physical; you're living in your own personal paradise, surrounded by magic, protected. You're not sad. But do you have everything you could ever want? Everything you could ever need?"
Great green hills rose above to the left, slowly receding into the horizon. Behind them, acres of forest stretched out in a canopy of leaves and branch-laden undergrowth, full of winding paths and little dirt trails that criss-crossed all over the place. To the right, plains of tall golden wheat; and, situated in the middle of one such field, lay a cottage.
shameful that he fainted at that tiny, pathetic-looking thing; but its face as the same sharp quality of Nagini's, and its eyes hold the same bright intelligence. He shudders. "Draco, darling," Pansy begins, and
She glowered. "I am glad to hear you are well, but I, myself, am struggling. Not only have I and this house been abandoned- we have been taken up by- by mudbloods and blood-traitors and- even worse- Gryffindors. How could this have happened? Draco, why did you and your mother let this happen? That traitor of a son- Sirius-" She spat his name out like it was poisonous- "Has entirely disregarded his heritage, his family- me! And then that godson of his, the Potter boy-" Draco stiffened. Potter?
As he thought this, the wind that had previously been pushing against them, bringing tears to Draco's eyes, turned and flipped the other way- like it was pushing the pair down, rather than slowing their descent. Draco had the most peculiar feeling that he was falling upwards. But he still needed to get out. What could he do? He needed to go up...
Blaise, who was previously scowling at her, but is now smirking at Draco, says, "50." Draco corrects himself. He hates Pansy, and Blaise, both of them are

was Draco's favourite part.
So, in a desperate attempt, Harry turned back around to face Draco (pulling their attached hands over their heads) and said, "There's an antidote, right?"
Pansy eventually took pity on the group. "Alright, darling, shut up now. Yes, this game is called "We Will Actually Die of Alcohol Poisoning Before Draco Admits his Crush on Potter", or "W.W.A.D.o.A.P.B.D.A.h.C.o.P" to keep it a secret when talked about with others present. The only rules of the game are that every time Draco mentions our beloved Lord and Saviour, every person playing the game who is within earshot of the conversation has to take a shot. The game will last until midnight. Any questions?"
It must've been a good couple of minutes that he waited before Potter spoke up. "I encountered Nicholas Flamel's invention in my first year here at Hogwarts. I'm sure you remember that the third-floor corridor was off-limits to students; well, I ended up there accidentally-" he glanced over at Draco, saw the disbelieving raised eyebrow, and added, "Shut up, Malfoy, it was an accident. I was an innocent rule-abider in first year." Draco snorted. He truly had let go of his care for his reputation in front of Potter. "I
"Yes, Ronald, I see- do you know what I also see? Harry is
At this point, they'd reached the entryway to the Room. Potter stepped forwards and paced back and forth three times, muttering something under his breath. On his third passage, a door appeared in the wall. Potter stepped forwards and opened the door. "After you."
Maybe the friends figure it out. Maybe they start going to extra measures to get the two together. Maybe it's a little more awkward between them now. Maybe it's an improvement.
They are both children born in the midst of a war, born of parents following someone who shares their beliefs; a
The boys only walked a few steps outside the house before they returned to the real world in a beam of white light. Draco didn't quite know how it worked; he just willed to return home and he disappeared, Potter beside him.
"Hey, Malfoy, what're you- blimey, Harry, what are those? They're adorable!"
"So you came running after me to tell me the password so I wouldn't have to wait out here? How chivalrous of you, Potter. Such a Gryffindor."
Hermione opened the portrait door to Draco Malfoy holding a- a
"Oh, um, okay. But- er, I mean- how- what do you mean?"
"Ohh," Harry said, eyes widening. "So now my wand swears allegiance to Draco, too?"
"Oh shush, Draco there's an easy enough way to get out," she interrupted.
He spent the next day locked away, too; he knew he was fixating on this, completely ignoring anyone and anything else.
. . .
He made his way down the shore leisurely, calm and level-headed after all the meditative exercises he'd done. His head did hurt a little- he'd forced a lot of information into it in a very short amount of time- but he was glad he'd found a personal use for this technique other than meditation.
Her voice was cut off when Draco shut the door. Whoops. He'd be in trouble for that later. But for now... "Blaise," he said. "This is urgent. What did you say I nearly gave Potter in first year?"
Draco fished Potter's glasses out of his pocket where he'd kept them while Potter rested, handing them over as he spoke. "Yeah. I couldn't very well leave here with you asleep; you have to be awake to leave."
"You're welcome," Draco replied.

He changed for others; he changed for certain circumstances; he changed for himself. "Malfoys must learn to adapt," his father told him.
Pansy offered to buy the dress for Draco, who let her do so happily. It was a hefty price, considering the group were in Hogsmeade. He'd told the others to go ahead, that he and Pansy would catch up, but Harry stayed behind. As they watched Pansy buying the dress, Draco heard Harry breathe in deeply, then say, "Did you like wearing the dress?"
Potter sighed and started heading off in the opposite direction to the one Draco had started going towards. "Yeah, I know just the place. C'mon, Malfoy. Do you remember the Room of Requirement?"
The Burrow stood tall and crooked, while Hogwarts stood large and proud. Harry's house from Goric Hollow was nestled between them, and when Harry shook the globe, a light snow dusted the roof.
(Draco in his Weasley jumper)

He gained many strange looks from classmates, up late from nightmares, portraits and ghosts; to escape them, and to clear his head as the sun rose over Hogwarts' great turrets, he strode down to the Black Lake.
"Voldemort- Quirrell- was trying to get the stone, too, and it was down there, but he couldn't find it. He made me look in the Mirror. I saw myself, and mirror-me put the stone into my pocket. When I went to put my hand in my pocket in real life, the stone was there. Dumbledore had enchanted it so it could be taken out of the Mirror, but only by someone who didn't intend to use the Stone for themselves. That's why Quirrell couldn't get it.
Potter blinked, then let out a quiet, "Oh." After a moment, he added, "Er- thanks, Malfoy. You didn't have to do that, but- thanks. I did talk to my parents and Sirius and everyone last night, though, but thank you."
Having spent the past seven years watching Malfoy's actions closely, analysing his every move, Harry was slightly concerned when Malfoy didn't show up to breakfast the day after he and Harry had retrieved the recipe for the Philosopher's Stone; when he brought it up to Hermione, however, she gave him that knowing Look again and said, "Harry, the war is over. He's not up to anything," and Harry nearly said,
the sweet, caring side of Draco Malfoy, who is shown to Harry always and occasionally to sick or sad friends in need of comfort, and very occasionally his family. No one else. (And if you so much as entail that this part of him exists, he will not hesitate to rip your vocal cords out.)
The Slytherins- as many as were willing to- were crowded in the common room, stood around a few crates' worth of fire whiskeys (butterbeers for the young 'uns). Hushed whispers and murmured conversations filled the room.
Perhaps...
This was followed by talk of names and meanings; Grang- Hermione summoned a book after about ten minutes. She would ask it a name, and it would come up with a definition. Suddenly,

"Oh, don't worry. I have everything I want already." Harry waved the student off, murmuring, "Or nearly," after they passed through the doors. Draco stepped out from behind the column where he'd been hiding.

"Alright, Potter. Lead the way." He grabbed another apple- green this time- for the journey, and put another in his expanded potions satchel. And it was a

The eighth-years all congregated in the Great Hall. Their curfew was far later than everyone else's, so they called for some hot drinks from the elves. As they warmed their frozen hands and feet, they discussed in their small groups what they would be doing for Christmas. A large portion of them were staying at Hogwarts, far more than usual; especially the Slytherins, and others who might want to avoid their homes. Draco, Pansy, and Blaise were planning to stay for Christmas for the first time ever. Harry was staying too, obviously, and Hermione and Ron had decided to stay with him. Draco heard Longbottom was staying, and he said that Luna was staying too. Good. Draco had gotten her a present, too, and wanted to see her reaction when she opened it. When he said as much to the group. Longbottom immediately turned on him and said, "You better not give her anything bad, Malfoy, or I'll- I'll hex you!"
They'd eventually won the war. Bloody, beaten, and bruised, but victorious nonetheless. Mourning friends, mourning families, but alive. They wondered if they'd rather be dead.

you've tried that on me.
Surrounding them were what must have been dozens of black figures, hidden in shadow, but Draco could make out all too well what they were.
"What do you think, Potter? I'm growing the things I need for the Philosopher's stone. What else would I be doing?"
In that case, it'd probably be a while.
"And?"
Potter had begun to slow in his sprint; he was losing energy, and he would need energy for the inevitable duel. Draco forced himself out of Potter's arms, knowing they'd need both their wands to stand even a slight chance against the wolves.
Their little group did panic, but didn't spread the news. Zabini then said, "You know, we think Draco's been missing for about that long, too. Usually they're brew- er, arguing somewhere together; maybe they're together now, too."
Pansy had been the one to set the previous record, and at just half an hour she was struggling to keep concentrated and focused on her goal.
He was holding a small part of the cauldron, and inside it was a shimmering pool of golden liquid. The Elixir of Life.

Draco felt the eyes of every person in the Great Hall on him; he stood and walked out of the Hall with as much dignity as he could muster, carefully avoiding the sick. He let the doors close behind him and with a swish of his robes, he set off for the Slytherin dorm rooms, hopefully where Death would take pity on him and just kill him.
, Ron. When he goes off, where is he usually? Somewhere with Malfoy, making that potion of theirs."
"Go on, then."
The war left everyone damaged. People had gone through a life-changing event, one that left them worse-for-wear. They'd lost so, so much. Most of them emerged from the war with things like PTSD, survivors' guilt, depression, anxiety, and so much more.
"No, he's terrible at them. I'm pretty good at them, though. What do you wanna do? Stick Draco and Potter together?"
Meanwhile, down in McGonagall's class, Harry felt the strangest tug at the back of his head. He shook his head to clear it, then continued on the essay he was writing.
She pulled him towards the sole apparition point in Hogsmeade, heavily guarded (you never knew who might come through) and apparated them to Diagon Alley, leading him up to the Magical Menagerie opposite Florean's.
Harry slowed the broom slightly, keeping pace with Draco as he fell, slowly urging the broom closer and closer and closer- he stretched his arm out, the way he did when he was trying to catch the snitch, and grabbed for Draco; he caught only a handful of robe, which tore away in Harry's hand as Draco steadily picked up speed.
Pansy thought that if Draco didn't shut up soon, he'd be
Draco cocked his head to the side and smirked. "Hm, no, I don't think I will. Oh, Potter, by the way- she?"
Draco appeared to be an adequate teacher, and calming enough to successfully get even the constantly panicked Potter to learn a few breathing techniques. So, he'd succeeded.
do? Draco wasn't good with animals. He frowned. Looked around. When his eyes landed on a wriggling vial of- something, a thought came to mind.
Potter's eyes had widened, and his lips had parted. "How?"
"A couple of weeks later, though, I heard him say he was going to sue someone at work; when I asked was suing was, he told me it was demanding recompense for being inconvenienced. Of course, I went around for the next couple of months asking my father to sue the birds, the fountain, and the fish; he ended up actually giving me some money to shut me up. And that," Draco concluded to a now grinning Harry (Mission accomplished, he thought triumphantly), "Is how I sued someone at three years old."
That night, Draco met Potter by the edge of the Forbidden Forest. They exchanged a glance and a nod, and then walked in together, side by side, illuminated wands held high.
Not even a minute had passed before every one of them had been hit by a snowball and brought into the fray. Hermione built up a formidable defense wall while Pansy and Blaise supplied the snoballs; Ronald was (for some absurd reason) shaping each snowball with his hands, making far less progress than the others, while Harry and Draco took turns peeking over the wall and flinging snowballs into the fight.
Draco, however, was stuck. His eyes wouldn't move from the spot Dumbledore had implored him to join the Light; his mind wouldn't move from the moment.
And maybe that happens again.
Slowly, Draco brought Harry back. He- quite literally- moved in, saying that Narcissa had moved to France (true) and didn't want him there (false) and the Weasleys had told him to go to Harry (true) because Harry was being a pain in the arse (false) and wouldn't open up to anyone (true). Harry only protested weakly, knowing that he couldn't win. Mostly, he was curious as to why the Weasleys had picked Draco Malfoy, Harry's well-known nemesis, and degrader of the Weasley's (and, by extension, Hermione, who had moved in), to come knocking. But, although he would (somewhat) allow Malfoy to move in, he would not give Malfoy the satisfaction of Harry actually speaking to him.
to lift Draco up, he'd used
Maybe one boy gives the other a small, intricate, enchanted dragon to accent clothes that crawls all over the other boy's body. Maybe the dragon is the most treasured thing to the other boy.
"Actually, it was instrumental in killing Voldemort. In that final battle between us, he had the physical Elder Wand, but I had its allegiance. He tried to kill me with it, but couldn't, because the wand didn't obey him, it obeyed me, and it refused to kill me. Hey, Malfoy, if you hadn't disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy tower I would've died."
Harry had a flashback to first year, when he had been in a position similar to Draco's, while Ron was in his. What had Ron done then? Oh, yeah.
"Slytherin cunning," Granger muttered under her breath.
Draco left the room for nearly the first time that night; he attended dinner. He sat at the Gryffindor table, with Pansy and Blaise and Weasley and Granger. Harry wasn't there. He ate quietly, as much as he could stomach.
Blaise raised an eyebrow, looked pointedly from Draco to Potter, and said, "50, at least."
"That doesn't help!" Ron said incredulously. "What's Malfoy gonna do if they get in trouble? What if Malfoy is the one
Still shocked, Flamel nodded jerkily. "Y- yes, a little."

Jisky had eaten; she was waiting patiently for Draco and Harry when they returned. "Jisky will be leading Harry Potter and Young Master Draco out of the House now," she said. She took both their hands and apparated them to the edge of the Malfoy grounds; Harry and Draco needed only to step out and they would be out of the apparition wards and able to apparate to just outside Hogwarts grounds.
"Is she here with you?"
She rolled her eyes. "Obviously. I'm a pureblood; we all go to each others' houses when we're young. I've been there, and Malfoy Manor, and Blaise's home, too."

They were at the base of a hill; to one side rose the great sloping side of the hill they'd rolled down, and to the other lay a- a wasteland, pretty much.
Instead, he turns to Pansy, who will no doubt be slightly more sympathetic, and says, "He has a snake." Pansy raises an eyebrow. "And? So does the zoo down the road. So do about a third of the Slytherins. So did-" and then she freezes, and Draco watches realisation sweep across her face.

He was terrified the entire time.
It all began in Charms.
During the war, Harry was- well- stunning. Not absolutely perfect, but he can't have been far off. His reflexes were unbelievably sharp, honed to a point, dodging curses and hexes thrown his way like he was born for it- perhaps he was- whilst shooting back a barrage of spells (mostly

Kreacher tilted his head to the side. "Master Potter is currently in Grimmauld Place's living room. Would you like me to take you to him?"
"Huh?"
Draco lay there in Harry's arms, terrified that he'd messed up; it was Harry who sat up tentatively first, peeking at the table. He scrambled upright and pulled something off the table. "Draco," he cried, "Draco, look!"
Special thanks to Yarrah for all your lovely comments! (You really motivated me to get this one done, thank you)

He leapt up to the lowest branch- which snapped, and Draco fell back down onto the ground. Blaise had turned red from laughter, and it seemed that Ronald might drop off the branch from laughing. Draco stood up and sniffed, dusting the snow from his clothes, before jumping up to catch a sturdier branch. This one held his weight, and he swung up to sit on it. Being an intelligent wizard, he immediately cast a cushioning charm beneath himself (something that Ronald had
?! Oh! The
Draco took a moment to make sure she'd eaten- she looked far better than she had the last time he'd seen her, that was for sure- before asking, "Could you watch over this and alert me when it melts?"
Outside, a blizzard seemed to have erupted.
Hermione picked up her book again, glanced at Ron leaving the room, put it back down again with a sigh, and called after him, "I'm coming too!"
"It's red."
He looked up as Zabini and Parkinson dusted off their robes. The house emerged before him, a looming grey wall of foreboding.
The words were left unspoken, but they hung heavy in the air:
The evening passed in a flurry of quiet conversations and light hearted jokes; at one point, Ronald produced some of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes newest product, the Hysteria-Inducing Holly (especially for the festive season!) which sent most of the room into fits of laughter. Then came some rather peculiar sweets that turned the consumer into an animal; an old classic from when Honeydukes and Zonko's had collaborated to make the "best product for students" a few years back. They were in high demand amongst the eighth years, and the Gryffindors ended up summoning stashes of sweets they had hidden in their rooms in order to satisfy everyone.
They spend seven years together at Hogwarts.
The student nodded.
"Right, I see. Thanks."
"It will not!" Draco protested. The food had disappeared sometime during Blaise's revealment speech, and Blaise grabbed Draco's stuff before he began heading off to class. Draco chased after him, but he levitated Draco's bag into the air, just out of Draco's reach. He then led Draco out of the Great Hall and down the corridor towards his first period class- Transfiguration with the Gryffindors- arguing with Draco about what he would get Harry for Christmas.
"Yes, I know, I've been in your class for
He threw himself onto his bed again, crossed his arms, and stared sulkily at the light of the waves on his walls.
Malfoy frowned. It was a good offer, Harry knew; he hadn't been offered Slytherin for nothing. And Malfoy was visibly exhausted...
Let the air rush over his robes. Something brushed by him- probably just his imagination. He closed his eyes, keeping a firm hold of his broom with one hand... And dropped.
Maybe their stories go down in history. Maybe they are analysed and praised, or criticised and hated; maybe they both hate their situation. Maybe it has been that way since they were born.
Potter was still examining him. When he returned to Draco's front, he murmured, "I'm so sorry."
"Well, Voldemort had been drinking unicorn's blood to keep himself alive. He was trying to get the Philosopher's stone so he could-"
Draco, who had been calming down with Occlumency tips from Severus, immediately lost any regained composure as he screeched, "You had the

The one with the bright yellow eyes growled; a low, menacing sound that reverberated through the ground, shaking Draco's bones. The rest of the group growled in response.
After all, he was safe.
Draco and Harry had gone over their plan, and if Harry messed it up, Draco would kill him.
Draco huffed, acting wounded, and said, "Excuse me! Potter and I can absolutely have a decent conversation. Especially in public."
Draco sighed. "Are we physically here, or are we like- like ghosts? Can we pass through walls and such?"
As soon as they left the shelter of the building they were hit with a wave of cold air and a layer of snow. The wind whipped around them as they made their way up to Hogwarts, tangling Draco's now-soft hair. Just as they were crossing into Hogwarts boundaries again, the snow began to recede, and the soft snowflakes from before returned. The floor was now coated in a thick layer of snow, and every step made a soft

As Ron thought, Parkinson and Hermione started talking very quickly in very high voices about Draco and Harry. Ron put aside his inner turmoil for now and listened.
Draco gestured at the snake, and Potter just. Stood there. And blinked.
Draco and Harry stayed asleep at Grimmauld Place for far too long. They slept until the sun had set and then risen again, and through most of the next day, too. They were undisturbed in that time- well, nearly.
He raced back up the stairs, panting, and slid down onto the floor beside his bed as quietly as he could. He reached under the bed, feeling around for- there it was. He pulled out his Firebolt, still in good condition, and hurried back down to the common room. He was entirely unaware of the five pairs of eyes watching him, having been woken up by Hermione's wards she'd set to notify them whenever Harry left bed at night.

"Oh, yeah! Well, the draught isn't finished yet, I'm going to leave it to brew for an extra-long time, just in case, but we got the-" he lowered his voice- "Elixir."
"My sentiments exactly." Draco stood up, dragging Potter with him. "Right, we're off. I can't get the ingredient needed to be collected by moonlight, but I can brew the rest of the potion up until it needs it. Come, Potter, and try not to get in the way
The mirror didn't show Harry. Well, it did, but it didn't show
Maybe, in face of the awkwardness, they return to arguing about every little thing. But maybe the insults are tinged with affection now. Maybe the arguing is more fond than angry.
"Bragging rights. Until the next time we play this game. Proof you have a high alcohol tolerance. This'll probably be the biggest drinking event of a single house in Hogwarts history, so you'll get your name down in the Student Stories history book, too. Bragging rights forever as the first victor of W.W.A.D.o.A.P.B.D.A.h.C.o.P. Any other questions? No, Draco, you don't get to say anything. Right then, that's it. This is your last chance to back out. Everyone staying?"
"Thank you, Jisky," Draco said. "I'll probably be gone until Christmas this time- not quite as long as before- but I'll be fine. Really. You just keep eating, okay?"

They shook their heads.

", while Harry opened his Quidditch set from Ron. Both the Golden Trio and the Silver Trio received knitted jumpers  from Mrs. Weasley (Draco nearly cried) because, as Ron said, "C'mon guys, did you really think Mum was gonna let you out of sweaters now you're a part of our group? No way!"
But he does find him, and they exchange pleasant conversation as they examine the potion. Then, a few weeks later, maybe one of them gets attacked by vengeful fans of the other; and maybe the other one's resurfaced unhealthy habits pay off because he can immediately step in and get help.
When he had finished with the physical layout of his house and was able to recall every room and the items within it as quickly as Draco could think of them, Draco deemed him able to move on.
That seemed right. But how did it-

"'Course not, Malfoy. Just thought- you being you- you wouldn't have done anything this year to be called into McGonagall's office, so you wouldn't know the password, so you'd be stuck waiting out here for ages. She's in there at the moment and probably won't come out till it's time to eat. It's 'Sherbet Lemon' now. She was feeling rather sentimental when she set it." As Potter spoke, the gargoyle made a scraping, screeching sound of stone against stone- why were the Hogwarts floors all stone? So cold, so
Pansy smirks and gives Potter an appraising look before continuing; "So, yes, you like playing the damsel in distress- where was I going with this? Oh, yeah- but did you really have to
"Harry-" Draco said, reaching out, but Harry rounded on him as soon as he felt the brush of Draco's hand against him.
Narcissa, somehow unphased by this pity-me-please story, nodded at Potter before turning back to Draco and continuing, "So, as you already know, the house elves' magic doesn't really count as magic, so they are still able to perform their previous tasks for us at the Manor. Well- so- house elves are able to disapparate, and a few of them work down in the kitchens, and so- so I came on a little- ah- supervisory visit to see how they're all doing down in the kitchens. Entirely legal," she adds, before pausing slightly to say, "technically. But your Headmistress allowed it, so I think I'm fine. I do probably have to leave soon, however; I cannot stay too long. You

Draco seated himself, grabbing an apple and resting his chin on his hands as he continued to observe. People-watching was one of his favourite pastimes; one that was well-developed after years and years of practice.
!" Draco shouted, pointing his wand at himself. He descended slowly, flipping sideways so he landed on his back softly. Then he looked at the wand in his hand. "Hey," he said, "This isn't my wand!"
Now, this, Draco could relate to so much it wasn't even really funny. He still had a legacy to protect, even as an ex-death eater, even as an outcast of society, he still had to protect his father's legacy as the sole heir of the Malfoy family- and probably the last, too, seeing the way his social standing was. And his sexuality- but that was for another time.

So he resigned himself to walking quietly behind Harry. This probably wouldn't go well.
She flopped down somewhere behind him, and Draco tried to listen to her advice. To his surprise, it seemed to work. It was actually almost... Fun. He stood up, careful to stay inside his imprint, and jumped out. When he looked back, he could just about see how his silhouette was an angel; with his arms making wings and his legs making a robe of sorts. Huh.
enough alcohol to all get sick?!"
Seeing he had no choice, Draco did.
Potter went up to fetch Weasley. They came down together talking quietly; when Weasley saw Draco, he stiffened, but his hand only clenched into a fist, not moving even an inch towards his wand. Granger gave Weasley a proud look from behind Draco, and he gave her a tentative smile.

Potter's face dropped. "What?" he asked, not seeming to want to know the answer.
Harry pulled off the invisibility cloak, and Draco had to consciously suppress the urge to start grinning like a lovesick idiot.
Evidently Potter had been to see his home; he recognised the place immediately. He walked hesitantly into the room, brushing his fingers lightly over the furniture and the books. He wandered into the kitchen, out of Draco's sight, and Draco heard the creak of a cupboard being opened, followed by Potter's soft gasp. Potter emerged a few minutes later, and Draco pretended he didn't see the tears glistening on Potter's cheeks.
The tree began to topple.
Thanking Potter after he spoke for him at his trial- and his mother's- although Draco already owed him a life debt; losing sleep over everyone who had died in the war, and feeling so terribly, terribly responsible; being unable to sit by the roaring fire and stare into its flames without being transported back to that traumatising event in the Room of Requirement; allowing himself to be pushed into an eighth year at Hogwarts just because he didn't know what else to do with himself- and now, relating to a song? And a
They put into motion the preparation for it, having Blaise stand watch for Harry; soon, the teachers and other students began walking into the Hall; Hagrid walked in, and gave them encouragement, going so far as to provide them with the biggest spool of ribbon Draco had ever seen. Of course, he didn't see it for long.
Uh oh. He knew the look on Snape's face.
Like he was flying!
Draco looked at the gap in the mirror across his heart.

"What the-
looked over his shoulder, he would've been able to tell that Harry was feeling rather confused, a little hurt, and ever so slightly suspicious. He did end up going to ask McGonagall, who only told him that Malfoy was to be trusted. His lingering suspicions were only eased in the slightest, and he was still incredibly confused about why Malfoy had reacted the way he had. When he retold the story to Hermione later, Ginny interrupted halfway through to let Harry know he looked like a "kicked puppy".
"You heard me. By the way, Theo, are you recording this?"
"Pans, look at that. Quidditch tournament next week, us against Gryffindor. I
Immediately and effectively distracted from his snow angels, he asked the pair what they'd made.
Draco took a step away from Harry- or he was going to. His foot never left the floor, and he just fell over. "What- I can't-"

had stubbornly refused his care, always wanting for Draco instead.
Maybe they've been watching, waiting for the boys to get over themselves and get together.
Harry grinned. "Yup. Now, anything I want?"
Stop, he told himself. Don't go down that route. Not here. Not now.
"Yes. Well- they're real."
Harry was. Draco sank down onto the ground; next to him, mirror-Harrys two and three followed his movements, sitting next to him. When they caught him watching, they both smiled that blindingly bright grin.
Draco stepped forwards, into the reflection of the mirror. It was fractured, a spiderweb of broken lines criss-crossing the surface; a fragment of the mirror was missing, right about where Draco's eyes would've been when he was younger. Now, that spot was over his chest- over his heart.
Blaise rolled his eyes. "Of course not, Draco. You know I'm a last-minute shopper. You yell at me about it every year," he replied. Draco shuddered at the thought of leaving things so last-minute. He could
He turned back to Potter- still asleep, silent and still. The edges of the Resurrection stone were barely visible in his pocket. Draco could easily take it out and exchange it, but... This was
Harry was still laughing, his eyes on the teachers, but his hand (unfairly warm after being in the snow for so long) had taken Draco's cold one. Draco felt himself melt inside; he linked their fingers and squeezed Harry's hand softly.
), he got just as comfortable as Potter looked; lounging across the chair, head on one of the armrests, legs slung over the other. He looked into the flames as he waited for Potter to say something.
Draco stumbled over to it, nearly falling over his legs; they'd fallen asleep while he'd been reading to Viv. He examined the mandrake carefully, holding samples of the potion, uncorked, around it. It didn't move towards them at all.
She released the spells holding Draco up, and Draco was thrown into freefall. His stomach stayed at the top of the tree, but his body went hurtling towards the ground; he gripped the tree trunk, screeching, and went down with a
Over Harry's shoulder, Draco could see the sky; shade by shade, it lightened, turning from pitch black to a dark, smoky red. Then it continued to lightened, though becoming more and more vivid a shade of crimson; now, as the two tumbled, it turned blood-red. Danger, Draco thought, though he couldn't quite remember why. The mirror-Harry had played with his mind, and now real-Harry was clutching him as they fell from the scarlet sky, and- oh, Draco thought, the potion's gone red.

They went to Dogweed and Deathcap first, where Granger and Weasley spent an unbelievably long time helping Blaise pick out a plant for Neville Longbottom. After half an hour of "No, that's too bright," and "It's not deadly enough," and "Neville has 10 of those already", Draco strode forwards and picked up the plant that had first caught his eye.
His brain didn't register that he was attacking Draco, not Wormtail, until he had Draco up against the stone wall; at some point he'd disarmed Draco, and was now holding his wand against Draco's throat.
He rolled down the rest of the hills, levitating his robes behind him so as to not get tangled up in them again, finally coming to a stop on the plains. Potter rolled down beside him, and stood, staring at the cabin with him. By now the full moon had risen and hung nearly overhead; the cabin's lights were out, and no smoke emerged from the chimney. The curtains were drawn, the door shut firmly, and Draco could feel that the magic in the wards were stronger.

Potter hesitated. "Ask your question, Potter," Draco said.
Draco noticed, as he watered his plants again, that his thoughts continued to drift to what he'd said at Grimmauld Place. He noticed that now, when he thought Harry, he thought of Harry; not Potter or anything else. Just Harry.

The world allowed them a moment of silent peace, but when Harry opened his mouth to say something, a crack of apparition announced Jisky's arrival. "Master Draco," she said, "Your potion has finished."

"Right, ready?" Hermione asked him once the group had gathered. She was taking Ron in a Side-along, while Parkinson and Zabini went together. He gripped her hand as the sickening feeling of apparating washed over him.
"Well- maybe not here?" Granger looked around to see the whole common room on edge and glaring at Draco.
Draco was about to leave for the Great Hall in hopes that breakfast would pass the time, but realised that breakfast wouldn't have started this early in the morning. He looked around for something to do, but apparently the Room didn't provide things this early in the morning. Stupid Room.
Draco had asked Harry for a fresh start; unfortunately, that wasn't wholly possible with both of them waking up from nightmares every other night, waking the other up with their struggling, and the nightmares being about the past.
sick (which was a rare occurrence in itself), he would be so worried about the lessons he was missing he'd return before he was even healed enough to. For something to keep him from school for a week, it had to be pretty serious.
Pansy, never one to back down from a bet, smirked at him and replied, "You're on."
. . .
until he tried to climb back into the Tower, whereupon he would accidentally slip and fall.
He took Hermione's scarf (Hermione had come prepared for the winter weather, unlike the rest of them) and enlarged it so he was barely able to lift it; then he levitated it up and wrapped it around the snowman's shoulders. He then focused the levitation on just one end of the scarf, the longer end, looping it over and under and around and through, then pulling, making a perfect knot  that sat snugly around the snowman's neck. He sat and picked up his hot chocolate as he waited for Potter to finish.
The eighth years rose, the Hall silent for them in respect for what they'd done to bring about the nightmares. They all took a bottle from Harry with a quiet, "Thank you," before returning to their seats. When it was Draco's turn, he only pretended to take a bottle; he had many more stashed away in the Room of Requirement, and he didn't want to take someone else's potion. He and Harry shared a small, secret glance before Draco turned away and returned to his seat next to Pansy, who'd already taken her potion.
Maybe tales are passed down through generations of hatred turned to friendship turned to love, and all the imperfections in between.
"Er- Malfoy, it was actually from you."
It smelled of blood.
He smirked as he pulled his snowballs from around Blaise and sent them into the snowball battle, hitting multiple students and damaging defences, effectively starting the fight once more... Except now, there was a third side of the fight; the small group of eighth years.
Potter nodded.
Well, whatever nefarious plan he was scheming now, Harry would stop him. He was careful not to wake Ron as he left, since Ron would only tell him about how "the war was over and Malfoy had no reason to be doing this stuff anymore". Hermione was really rubbing off on him now they were together.
The eighth years opened their presents together in a circle, handing their presents to the designated recipients, building up their own pile as they went.

"Everything I don't know, yeah."
"We're both well, thank you. Yourself?"
Potter arose and rejoined Draco in shouting spells at the pack.
"Draco," Harry said softly, "Look up."
Hermione had managed to sneak up while Harry stared, motionless, out the window at Malfoy; she sat on Ron's bed, observing. Harry dashed around the common room, looking for a latch on a window, or a handle or
"So, Malfoy," Potter said. Ooh, conversation without any "er"'s or "um"'s. Perhaps Potter was finally becoming adequate at social interaction!
Draco was down in his potions room, somewhat awake and sort of functioning with a Pepperup potion (or two) and a strong cup of coffee (how the muggles came up with this stuff, he'd never understand, but it was heavenly). He rolled his sleeves up, preparing for another day of work, Harry Potter the last thing on his mind for once.
the second-best, not quite good enough, not good enough for his father, always living in his shadow (Draco, none of this is true. (Yes, Harry, I know that now, but the point of this is figuring out- something, and this is related to it, so just leave it.))
"Don't get on Draco's bad side," Draco said boastfully. They'd arrived at the square arrangement of the tables, and sat next to each other.
"I'm going to teach you the more meditational way of using Occlumency. It's far easier than learning to defend against Legilimency, and you should only need to learn this to stave off nightmares. Also, you can use this knowledge and apply it to stronger forms of Occlumency; and should you ever need to use Legilimens on an Occlumens, you would, theoretically, know the weaknesses of Occlumency to exploit them.
Ignorance was bliss.

song, no less. Merlin, Draco had fallen. It was true, though; life really didn't discriminate. It hadn't take pity on Draco when he'd been tormenting Potter for the fun of it, because he was supposed to; hadn't taken pity on him when he'd been under death threat from Voldemort himself to commit murder; hadn't pitied him when a giant bloody chicken had mauled his arm in year- oh, who
Draco, still sat in his chair in the Room of Requirement, was scowling at the thought of having to possibly wait until mealtime to grab Harry when the doors opened and Harry bloody Potter himself came sailing in like a possessed ragdoll and was seated on the other chair. The doors slammed shut behind him.

Potter turned away abruptly. When he spoke, his voice sounded a little thick. "Oh, well-" he cleared his throat- "Thank you. It- er, I don't have much like this that I can- can openly display. So, er, thank you."
"Alright," Ron said, standing up and going to the portrait-hole.
!" Draco protested.
Blaise was chortling beside him at Draco's reaction. "Eugh. Didn't notice. You wanna finish it?"
Draco wanted more from Harry than just a smile now.
Out of McGonagall's office, Draco turned to face Potter- as much as he could, considering their linked hands- and said, "To try and save us both from agony for the foreseeable future, I'm offering a restart. Not a truce, a full on re-do of everything. I'll start. Hello, my name is Draco Lucius Malfoy, I've grown up a lot more than people think since I was younger. You can call me Draco. Would you like to be my friend?"

"So, you remember that breathing exercise I taught you yesterday?"
The snitch hovered right in front of his nose.
mastering that trick! Ever since he returned to Hogwarts for his eighth year and had been allowed to play Quidditch and own a broom again.

Then Ronald came into his dressing room as Draco was putting away his last outfit (it had been a strong, collective "No," from the entire group) and gave Draco one last outfit. He handed it to Draco and told him quietly, "Harry will love it," and stepped out again.
"I am so, so sorry about this," he brushed his hand over where Harry's scar was, raised skin on his forehead, "And I know I couldn't have done anything to stop it, but I should've known it was terrible to be you. I'm sorry for being envious of your fame, I'm sorry for wanting what you have. I'm sorry for this, too," he said, brushing his fingers over the raised skin on Harry's hand that he received from detentions with Umbridge. "I'm sorry for the Inquisitorial Squad; and the DA; and for your Godfather. I'm sorry for hating the Weasleys because they loved you, and they showed it. I'm sorry for- I'm sorry for everything from the past seven years, pretty much," he finished, looking away and playing with his fingers.
Potter blushed. "Yeah, well, I- she seems like a she."
moving faster than Draco.
He'd seen the Sectumsempra scars.

He returned to the snow outside with a pounding headache (honestly, portraits should have volume limits) and a damper on his earlier cheer. He spotted his group all sat watching the teachers (who were, apparently, now working together to build a snowman taller than Draco's (they were failing, obviously, because Draco was

Draco found all of this out in less than five seconds.

heads of black hair there, and they were far too close together.
It counteracted the combination of the Powdered Root of Asphodel combined with the Infusion of Wormwood and Valerian Sprigs- but, as Draco looked back up the list, there was no ingredient that would make the potion addictive as it was. Unless...

It was far more run-down than the rest, but most of it was recognisable. Draco had learned the layout, all of the little things like the genres of books on the bookshelves, the main items in each room, even the organisation method of the cupboards. He'd memorised the smell of the home, the softness of the carpets, the amount of stairs.
"Er... Viv, short for Vivian."
He threw open the door to the Room and headed to the nearest cauldron. He removed the staisis charm on it and drew out the shard of the Mirror, trying to recall what Dumbledore had told him to do. Something along the lines of liquifying the stone, adding the heart's deepest desire, and casting a spell to extract it. Okay, two problems there. Draco looked down into the cauldron before him. The
A wicked smirk came upon Pansy's face. "Well, this is where it gets interesting. See, the game revolves around our beloved Draco here-" she pulled him from the edge of the clearing, where he'd been lurking on the fringes of the crowd, and to her side, where he was met with cheers and amicable groans- "and his well-known crush on one Harry James Potter."
She reached out a hand, but before she so much as touched him, the door swung open of its own accord, and Harry went flying out of it.
This was just a fact.

"Um-" Wait, actually- when
Draco sectioned off a portion of the Elixir, just in case, before adding the necessary amount to his pre-prepared base potion for the Dreamless Sleep potion. Now, with unicorn blood, he'd usually only have to wait for the potion to stop bubbling until he could move on to the next step. He wasn't sure if he could proceed so quickly using the Elixir, and he did not want to mess this up, so he decided that he'd wait until he physically couldn't any more.
"She does? Oh, that's brilliant- wait, how do you know how much I write?"
"I stand corrected," Harry mumbled, rubbing his ears and glaring at the plants.
He emerged in the Shrieking Shack, and made his way out into the streets of Hogsmeade. It was a quiet day today. The shops were open but not busy, and only a few people were roaming the streets at this time.
The war was over, long over, but he still awoke like this nearly every day. He'd gotten into the habit of placing silencing charms around his bed before he went to sleep every night, and of drawing the curtains closed around his bed to hide his nightly struggles from his dorm-mates, all of whom had come back to Hogwarts for their eighth year.
"Well, not

hate Harry Potter, he was on the third attempt of the potion.
His brother, however, had been hailed among the children of Walburga.
Draco was on-edge; every crack of a branch or rustle of leaves not caused by himself made him tense up and glance around. Potter led the way, mostly, seeming to know exactly where he was going although they had long ago strayed from the path, but made sure Draco stayed right by his side.
"Grimmauld Place? Hogsmeade?" Ron suggested.
From below him began an unbearable screeching.
Flamel's shock was palpable. He froze up, his eyes widened and his mouth parted; he made as though to stand up from his chair in outrage, but then sank down, looking visibly crushed. "Oh," he said, and his voice was quiet, too. "Oh."
"No, you moron," Draco said, grabbing his robes. "Potter, honestly. We don't know where we are, we could've been trapped somewhere, and you want to go

"See, that sounds good, except I don't want to tell more people about my potion. And, besides, who do you think would actually come and join us if we told them we were looking for the Resurrection Stone? Or even just any old stone? They'd think we'd gone mad."
Even the few firsties gathered, who had only been attending Hogwarts for a couple of months, groaned with the older students, far more accustomed to Draco and how he could drone and whinge and whine and moan on and on and

Draco nodded and took a deep breath. He only had one shot at this. Where'd he put the Mirror shard?
Draco opened the door again, walking confidently up to McGonagall and asked, quietly, "Are there any rooms near the library? Any at all?"
Draco turned around to Blaise just in time to receive a snowball straight to his face. He sat there with the the most dangerous
Potter and Granger glanced at each other. Granger looked away first; back at Draco. "Sorry, Malfoy, I can't help you there. I don't know any more than is already written in books like the Potter History book; Harry can help you, though. He knows far, far more than I do. That's all I should say here; you two should probably go somewhere more private. The reason I don't know more about the Stone is because the information is rather powerful; if it gets to the wrong person, it could be used really badly. So no, I can't help. Harry will, though."
Harry took a long breath in, then seemed to deflate. "Alright, then. You say, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' to open it; you say 'Mischief Managed' to close it. Be careful, please."
Uh oh.
"What do you mean, 'nearly'? And also, Harry, you nearly gave me a heart attack. Please don't do that again, even if it
"Nope. Oh, look, Hermione says she's ready. C'mon, Draco." Indeed, across the Hall, Granger had stood up and was beckoning the Slytherin trio.
"Two," Potter said, holding up his cloak.
. . .
Potter poured the memory into the pensieve, and said, "Malfoy, just do what I do. It's so easy, I did it without even meaning to my first time. You can't really mess up. Just follow me." He leaned forwards, plunged his face into the thin pool of water, swirling with memories, and then kept going forwards until he was gone into the Pensieve.
that project failed, he wanted to be there to make sure I wasn't hurt, and also to laugh at us-"

When Harry heard this, he immediately decided he would go and check on Malfoy; after all, the last time he'd avoided his friends like this, he'd been working on getting Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Yes, he'd go make sure Malfoy wasn't planning a Vanishing Cupboard act that would end in someone dying again, that was it. What Harry was
Draco frowned and Harry sat back, gaping. What month was it? December? And he'd started school in September. Jisky hadn't eaten anything

Draco took the parchment from Harry. At his touch, the writing on the paper flared gold, like the surrounding landscape he was in. He read the new writing.
It made him feel like when he was being himself... he wasn't really being
But, apparently, this was not enough. Because a moment later, another snowball flew into Draco's back, this one launched with so much force he was knocked off of his makeshift seat and onto the ground.
He scanned the room for Pansy's short black bob, listening for Blaise's baritone voice or either of their sassiness. He began to frown as his eyes passed over the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables with no result. He almost didn't look down Gryffindor- what would Blaise and Pansy even be doing at a table of lions?- but the internal need to sit with company he could have an intelligent conversation was too strong. He just glanced over the table, and had to do a double-take when he spotted Potter's nest of black hair.
, the way girls often did, and then stood up unanimously and made their way over to the door.
. . .
The cellar looked... strange, to say the least. Almost out-of-place, with its fresh-produce-lined shelves and small wooden cubby-holes. It was empty when Draco and Harry entered, but elves quickly started apparating in to take some food; just a loaf of bread or a block of butter and then

Draco rolled his eyes.
. . .
Harry had to take a minute to try and calm the blush he could feel had risen on his cheeks before he could join them.
Blaise's eyes widened. "Oh. Um, I think you said something about a room down the corridor from the library?"
"Draco? You alright?" Pansy called out.
"Is that your answer for everything?"
! (You're hopeless. I've tried my best, but you are truly hopeless.) You can't get rid of me! (Watch me.) ... Please don't, Dragon, I love you- (Don't worry, you're as stuck with me as I am with you.) Oh, good. Wait, no, that's not good. (
He loved how- oh, Merlin, there was Malfoy. His platinum-blonde hair was easily distinguishable from the rest of the dark night. He looked rather delicate, so pale and pretty on his broom, hovering above the Quidditch pitches. He looked so... relaxed. He hadn't seen Harry yet, then.
The floor opened, and Harry and Draco fell.

Harry, who he could touch, who wasn't separated from him by a layer of glass. Apparently his Harry had been watching him with the Mirror; he stumbled slightly as Draco fell, looking at him in confusion. He blinked.
Potter still brought him food; he'd been sneaking food in from the kitchens (he'd tried asking the Room for some, but it just didn't taste quite as good) and had taken to cooking up lunch for Draco and himself. It forced Draco to take a (well-needed) break from his potions and plants, and it allowed Potter a break from his memorising of his house.
"Blimey. Well, that settles it," Ron said, standing up. "I'm going to find Harry."
?!" incredulously.
about them, no matter
"Well, do you know Beedle the Bard? And his stories?"
Draco's eyes snapped open, and he looked into Harry's eyes for a moment, looking confused and slightly frightened, before the situation hit him. He started flailing madly, his mouth wide in a scream torn away by the wind before Harry could hear it. His eyes were wide and frightened, his skin drained of what little colour it usually held. He looked almost like he had done in sixth year; deathly pale and scared. He turned to Harry for help.
"Um... Merlin, Draco, I don't know. Why, anyway?"
There was Malfoy. Leaving the castle. Was giving his whole house alcohol poisoning not enough? Had it been too quiet for him?
Potter's eyes went dark. Uh oh. They hadn't done that in a while. And last time Draco had seen that look directed at him- oh. Sixth year. Girl's bathroom.
It's a change; a little one, but a change nonetheless.
Draco knew, as he watched Harry walk away from him, not to call out. He couldn't make any sudden movements, couldn't light his wand or cast spells. He knew well enough that Harry didn't need a wand to defend himself.
. He'd joined Voldemort incredibly young, and died young, too. Draco passed his room quickly.
Potter sank to his knees before him. "Oh," he breathed. "Oh, Merlin." Draco could practically feel his eyes roaming the scarred expanse of Draco's chest. The skin itself was smoothed, physically indistinguishable from any other part of him; the Dittany did that. But it wasn't quite strong enough to stop the visual scarring- or the emotional scarring, or mental. Visually, there were cuts- thirty-seven on his front, to be precise- lacing his skin with imperfections. The worst was one that stretched from his right shoulder down over the left side of his ribcage, and halfway round his back. It was crisscrossed with many others.
Harry looked up confidently. "Deal."
Malfoy and Flamel reacted the same way.
He stood and turned to face the direction it had come from- the main snowball fight, which was still going strong. The fight had stopped, however, when Draco was hit, and the participants had all turned to watch Draco. As he glared at the group, they all seemed to cower a little. Ooh, it'd been a while since Draco had terrified the younger students. He was going to have some
"May I?" Potter said- whispered. This seemed too delicate to talk about normally. It had to be treated gently. Potter gestured to Draco's shirt. He wanted to see all the scars.
"Third year, Malfoy- Buckbeak the hippogriff." Draco glares at Potter. Now he's siding with Draco's own friends-

The cottage was small, cosy, sweet; a plume of smoke rose from its chimney. It was only two stories tall. Its windows were alight, the curtains parted. The walls were a soft beige, the roof slatted rows of weathered stone. The door, too, looked weathered. It was wooden, with little lines and knobbles from whatever tree it was grown; softened over the years.
Zabini and Parkinson, having apparently established that Malfoy would be where Harry was, listened and made a list as Hermione and Ron ran through places Harry might've gone.
. Shoot.
And Pansy had drawn a lightning scar on Harry's one and charmed the scarf on Draco's to be a Slytherin green and silver, so that it looked like Harry and Draco holding hands.
"Kreacher," she called out. With a crack of apparition, the house-elf appeared in front of her.
Grimmauld Place.
"Ah. Well, I'm not sure I can help with that, either. But, maybe Dumbledore can?" Draco sighed. Was this what it was like with
Oh. Harry's Map.
Above their heads was a sprig of mistletoe.
!- and- oh, Merlin.
Spintwitches' Sporting Needs was next, where Ronald bought his present for Harry (a Quidditch ball set of his own, missing a snitch for some reason. When Draco asked, Ron gave a sort of half-smile and told Draco that Harry had a snitch of his own he could use). Pansy then walked up beside Draco and said that perhaps Draco could get Harry a snitch of his own as a present; Ronald rejected the idea and helped Draco make a custom snow globe that Harry would like. Then the two took their sweet time going over nearly every Quidditch-related item in stock, comparing items and advising each other on what to and what not to get. Pansy rushed off to J. Pippin's Potions (presumably to get Draco's present), but was back before the boys left (unfortunately). It didn't take her long before her impatience won out and she was dragging the boys away from the store to move onto their next destination- Zonko's.
Malfoy turned back to his work. "I'm insulted, Potter. Do you really think I'd let my hair get into such a greasy state?"
"Oh, Merlin. He
The group spent a long time in there, each getting individually lost in the aisles of sugary heaven. When nobody was looking, Draco dashed into the Post Office to wrap Harry's present. He made sure it was all safe and secure before he sent it off to his dormitory, made sure that the little snow globe wouldn't break. When he emerged, he looked around cautiously before stepping outside. Pansy somehow saw him anyways, and gave him a knowing look. "So the snowglobe
The fabric rose upwards slowly, and Draco stepped out.
"But, knowing Harry," Hermione said, frowning, "He won't even realise for ages..."
! I meant like a leg-up!"
Draco explained the rough basics of it before beginning to go into more specific details about what he'd discovered about the Dreamless Sleep potion, what he'd thought and theorised; both wizards nodded along as he spoke. "So I came here to ask if you know how to extract the Elixir of Life from the Philosopher's stone?" He paused, then added, "Or, just, how to make the Stone in general?"
The . . . indicates a change of perspective.
, hadn't he bothered to
"Cover me!" Potter said, and he bent down and started hissing at the snakes. In a couple of seconds, the snakes were slithering forwards; they started diving at the wolves, hissing and biting as much as they could.
Draco nodded. It would help to have his godfather there; Severus had always been a mentor for him, especially in potions.
"Alright, I'll be going then. Oh, and Mr. Potter?" Potter glanced up from where Pansy and Blaise were still playing with the snake. "Thank you."
"Harry?" Draco asked, opening the door again. "Harry, I've finished the sandwich, you can come out now," he said. No one answered.
Panicking, Harry looked around him- the sky was far lighter than it was higher up; were they nearing the ground?- before trying one last time.
The next day, Potter arrived before Draco did; when Draco found him, Potter insisted Draco go to classes and catch up with friends, saying he was good enough to look after the plants. Draco hesitated, but the lure of company other than Potter's and plants was irresistible. He left with a quiet "Thank you," and went to join his friends for breakfast.
"I give up," Potter announced after about half an hour of searching.
Then Draco's gaze caught on his mirror-self's hand.
. Those were
The Map showed that there was, indeed, a room near the library. Two large, plain wooden doors were set seamlessly into the walls, so cohesive with the design of Hogwarts they didn't stand out at all.
Snape spoke first. "What you've done sounds far too good-willed to be true. Even if this will help you, Draco- why offer it out? Why not sell it? And you said it would be anonymous? Why not even disclose the fact that this discovery was you? You've always taken pride in your work."
Harry was there.
"Yeah, you have a temperature?" Blaise asked jokingly.
He turned into quite a child at Christmas; full of energy for days before, jumping and leaping around the place, grinning from ear to ear. This Christmas was no exception. He ran down to the foot of the tree and just sat there, amongst the presents, revelling in the feel of Christmas that flowed through the air. Ron and Hermione had been eating at one of the tables; Blaise and Pansy approached them with murmured greetings and tired smiles. Hermione gave Pansy a sympathetic look when Ron bounded over to Draco; apparently he was a fellow Christmas-lover.
Harry's laughter was cut short, however, when the boys heard a creak outside the door.
He'd told Severus he'd bring down a painting so Snape could watch and make sure Draco was okay.
," he said. The liquid seemed to evaporate as he spoke, turning from scarlet liquid to pink-tinged smoke of some sort. It had no identifiable smell, yet Draco was reminded of everything in life that he loved; his mother, his broom, the gardens at Malfoy Manor, hot chocolate and the smell of freshly cut grass, and Pansy's perfume and the rain and the snow and an overwhelmingly strong scent of Harry. And then... What was
After Draco had decided that yes, he

Hermione stopped mid-instruction and said, "Oh my God, Harry, that's a brilliant idea! Levicorpus!"
The night before November 2nd, Vincent Crabbe haunted Draco's dreams.

Dumbledore, in the portrait next to Snape's, laughed. "He's fine, Severus. Just doing some good.

The group watched, over the next few months, as their Harry returned. Slowly, oh so slowly; but they hadn't expected anything else. The boy had
Potter's eyes widened and darted around the way he did whenever he accidentally revealed something. Ooh, suspicious. "Oh, er, a children's story. Yeah, obviously. 'Course." So he was hiding something. Draco filed that away to think about later. "Er, the Elixir? I'm not sure. Ask Hermione?"
He didn't fit quite right in his body. When he told Pansy and Hermione, they sat with him and talked a while. When he left them to head home, he had a few ideas about what to do. He sat down.
She retreated from the fire, severed the connection, and made her way to the Gryffindor common room. At her arrival, Hermione and Ron bounded over to her, eager for news on their friend.
He'd had this happen to him with Wormtail. It wouldn't happen again.
"Huh. Say, Potter, do you know what Occlumency is?"
She was also
"Ah, I feared he would be like that. I hope he didn't cause too much trouble. Well, how are you two going to get the Stone?"
One goes to unhealthy lengths to be noticed- staying up all night to make badges; conducting over a hundred students in a chorus; climbing trees and making a fuss over their injuries and pretending to be a soul-sucking creature just to get a rise from the other.
he felt a little warmth towards him when he did something like waiting for Harry to be ready before trading away the Resurrection Stone, and yes, he was interested in the Dreamless Sleep potion Malfoy was making, but that was only because Harry suffered from nightmares and wanted them to go away as soon as possible, nothing more.
. . .
Pansy wore the Look. The Look she'd had when she'd asked Draco if he was gay.
And while witches and wizards of all ages told their children and their friends the great tale of the Saviour of the Wizarding World in all his glory and flawless grace, Harry himself was probably more broken and flawed than anybody else those ignorant wizards knew.
"Right away!" Dobby cried. A few moments later he reappeared with a carrot, which he handed to Harry happily, then disapparated. Harry turned to the snowman.
McGonagall was laughing.
Blaise leaned over and patted Draco on the shoulder. "That's good of you, Draco."
!" Harry said. The loaf of bread Draco had been trying to get floated down off the shelf and onto Jisky's table.
Didn't notice as they settled, as a three, around him.
Viv still hadn't calmed down by the time Draco and Potter had reached the Potions room. It took half an hour of both boys fussing over her to get her to calm down. When she finally stopped crying, Potter sank down into the rocking chair, looking utterly exhausted. Draco remembered what Weasley had said earlier.
"He's coming!" Blaise hissed to the group just as Draco was moved to his place. The others all fell into position, too, distracting Harry as Pansy added the finishing touch; a label that read, "

The first thing he saw was the outfit Ronald had given him.

Potter's expression turned sad. Draco turned away as Potter said, quietly, darting a glance at Draco, "Albus Dumbledore died two years ago, Mr. Flamel."
The breathing technique Draco uses actually works; some sciencey stuff makes it release calming chemicals from the brain. It's good to help calm yourself down; just repeat the exercise a few times over if you're stressed.
"Neville, it's 'Bumpernuggets'. Honestly, this is the third time this week!" Harry shouted at the portrait.

"Well, what if we brought him here for you?"
The boys waited until the next day to return to the pensieve and Flamel. When the sun's rays glinted off the black lake and the trees were aglow in the sunrise, they made their way back up to McGonagall's office, both too tired from the previous night to do much more than move one foot in front of the other. At one point they had to stop because Potter had gotten himself stuck in the trick stair, and Draco spent a good ten minutes trying to get him out.
Draco didn't sleep that night; he spent the whole time reading and practicing, wandering around the Slytherin dormitories and Common rooms; then he slowly expanded his trail outwards a few corridors and classrooms.
Hm. That was a little trickier. "Well, what if you observed me for a couple days? Or even a week or so? Just until you know I can be trusted. Or, er, maybe till they stop screaming so much."
fight." Pansy turned to Blaise with a smirk. "Should I go 20 galleons, or 30?" She asked him.
There was one large, flat rock that Potter sat down on. Draco would not sit on a rock. Not as a Malfoy, a pure-blooded, skilled wizard. He transfigured a leaf into a plush chair, and took a seat on that. "So, um," Potter began.
"Need my help, Potter?" Draco asked as the door to the Room creaked open.
So, yes, it was a good thing Narcissa was here, Draco contemplated as he re-told his story for her.
"In any case, we should head over to Grimmauld Place to use the Floo. We need to get off Hogwarts Grounds to apparate there. C'mon," he said, heading towards the Whomping Willow.
"You know about Grimmauld Place?"
"Oh? So you're planning on getting out from under this mistletoe, then?"
"Morning, Harry. Mandrake's not up yet."
. Harry slammed his hands over his ears and shouted for Malfoy to make it stop. Malfoy stepped forwards, next to the table, again, and the noise and thrashing immediately stopped.
Harry pulled Draco on behind him; Draco's arms wrapped instinctively around Harry's waist as Harry yelled, "Hold on!" and the broom shot towards the wind- upwards, Draco supposed.
He made his way to the outskirts of Hogsmeade, over the edge of a snowy cliff. He remembered sitting here with Hermione; remembered Malfoy, being pelted by snowballs, and Harry playing with the strings of his hat. He smiled.
That was what drove him as he flew upwards, battling the wind; that, and the arms wrapped around his waist so tight it hurt. Harry couldn't stop flying, had to get out- because if he didn't, he wouldn't be the only one to suffer the consequences.
"What do you want, Draco?" Harry asked once Draco had dragged him outside.

He hated this feeling; he knew that something would happen tonight, and he knew that it would be big, whatever it was. He knew that it could be life-changing. And he couldn't share this feeling with anyone. No one else had seen and helped him in his labours; no one else had held and calmed his plants, no one else would feel the sweetness of their labours paying off tonight.
When they arrived at the castle, they found a throbbing mass of people in the courtyard. They made their way around the edge of the throng and, eventually, up to the balconies, where they looked down upon the commotion.
Draco thought. Potter knew this, though. He bowed his head, looking ashamed and sorrowful and remorseful. "I'm sorry," he said again. Then, after a moment, he said, "I'm so sorry. For everything." Oh. So this was happening
Maybe, together, they are told of to younger students in that school.
He'd spent a good while looking around, noting the architecture and colour scheme, until he came to what was clearly the Potter's old house.

? Just 'cause Draco didn't particularly like her didn't mean he didn't acknowledge her intelligence. "She and Potter here helped me realise I needed your Philosopher's stone to produce the Elixir of Life. We don't need to become immortal; just to combat the fatalness of the Powdered root of Asphodel, the Infusion of Wormwood and the Valerian Sprigs together. So... could you help us?"
He sat down on the stone steps, frowning.
She hesitated, then sighed. "Oh, alright. But you can't keep them, only copy them out. Alright?"
: the schoolboy sweetheart, with girls drooling over him, and hanging off of his arms, the Slytherin prince with money and flowers and jewellery and presents and a smart mouth and heaps of compliments (You were so good with the girls back then, I guess I can see why you didn't realise you were gay until, like, fifth year. (Obviously, Potter. I'm surprised nobody else apart from Pansy and Blaise guessed, though; honestly, did anybody see how much
Harry reached out and took his invisibility cloak from where he'd stuffed it in his pocket after being caught in McGonagall's office. He pulled it around himself, disappearing under the material as he did; he left his head out to prove he hadn't just cast some spell of sorts.
Each wall held one in its surface; they all faced the center of the room, where Draco and real-Harry were stood.
was he saying that in front of Potter.
of- Filch was sat right outside the Gryffindor portrait. If Harry left now, he was sure to be caught.
Parkinson rolled her eyes. "Draco wouldn't hurt a hair on Potter's head if his life depended on it, Weasley. Our problem is where they're at, and anyone else that might be with them." Most of the Gryffindors had stopped listening when the conversation turned to Malfoy, so only Hermione and Ron leaned in to hear what Parkinson said. "Y'know, there's been talk amongst the Slytherin parents about a new group of Death Eaters. People who escaped Azkaban and want revenge on Potter. I don't know if it's true, but he could be in danger. Draco, if he's with him, could be in danger too."
"Obviously," Draco drawled. "Who else?"
Draco waved him off. "I put up spells around them to monitor them, and they've all been moved to our new location."
"So my lucky parents were able to behold the wonderful sight of me running, screaming, from a flock of very colourful exotic birds- flamingos, peacocks, parrots and toucans; the whole lot. And poor me was leading the flock. I glanced behind me when one of the faster birds nipped at my heel; I kept looking behind me, even as I ran. I veered off the main path and into a rather shallow ditch in our garden. But that's not the worst part.
"See, that was also the first day I performed accidental magic. There was a lock on the birds' enclosure to stop them getting out. I managed to manifest my magic well enough to get past it and into the enclosure. Except, I never actually entered the enclosure. The birds got out.

With a jolt of realisation- and horror- Harry realised what the look had been. Fear. Fear of Harry. And the last time Harry had seen that fear, directed towards himself- Draco had nearly bled out on the floor of the girls' bathroom.
The shopkeeper was clearly on the edge of adding "

that her name was Harry- short for Harrietta- too. The only gift Draco had actually considered was, in fact, the Potter Stinks badge; and only because that had been the year Harry dropped out of school to- y'know- save the world.
?" And Draco barely has the self-restraint not to hex him right here, right now.
Finally, he set up the small muggle radio in the corner; it'd been here when he'd started making the potions, and McGonagall told him she'd put it there in case he wanted music to work to. She showed him how to make it work manually- but that'd been months ago. Now Draco just cast a few spells at it and it sprung to life, blaring the newest popular muggle music. Draco had been listening to this specific station for so long, he actually sort of knew a few of the songs. As he grabbed a scalpel to start cutting up ingredients, he sang along quietly to them, making sure his silencing charms were up and working. As he poured the first tray of ingredients into the cauldron, bubbling with water (mixed with three drops of Essence of Dittany), he felt something brush against his arm. He shrugged it off as the breeze- the window was open- and shut the window quickly. He didn't want anything as unreliable as a breeze to potentially mess up his potions.
"Hey!"
Potter frowned (he did that when he was confused. He frowned an awful lot of the time). "Draco, your name means Dragon?"

"They're snowmen," Harry told him. "You make snowballs, but bigger, and put them on top of each other to make people."
The room was dark.
running in those. C'mon, let's go." Every single Slytherin and most of the Gryffindors watched as Draco sashayed out of the Hall, and every single pair of those eyes watched how Harry Potter didn't take his eyes off of Draco until the doors slammed shut.
He'd held on to Harry just like this.
Pansy loved the plan; as did Hermione. Blaise had added suggestions to the plan and improved it bit by bit until it was deemed flawless.
Potter, it turned out, was surprisingly competent at looking after things.
, Potter." He immediately set about making a new snowman, a better one; it would be the biggest snowman ever. When the head was about as tall as Draco was, he moved onto the body. He ended up having to use magic to help with that. He levitated the head up on top of the body, making sure it stayed firm, before bringing it down again. Blaise had re-emerged with hand-made hot chocolates and passed them around, keeping two aside for Harry and Draco.
"Draco, when was the last time you ate?" His voice was inquisitive, calm- but Draco had analysed Potter's every move for as long as he could remember.
Draco, of course, took the challenge.
He looked wistful. "Yeah. Yeah, I did. Perenelle. Sweet El. What of her?"

Harry had barely finished telling Hermione his story when there was a knock on the portrait, followed by the Fat Lady's squawking. "Neville's probably forgotten the password again," Harry sighed.
? Even a small attempt? Draco imagined any comb too flimsy would just break if Potter even attempted to tame that wild nest now.
Draco's head shot to him, his body tensing instantaneously, his hand already beginning to reach for the floo powder. He saw the look of hurt in Potter's eyes, the way his posture sagged and his movements halted entirely, and slowly let himself relax and look away again. He was safe. He was safe. He was safe.
! Second- '
Draco frowned. "
"No, it can't," Potter said.
Oh, Draco had hoped this would happen. He grinned. "Open it, Harry," he said.
"I thought as such. Harry, come out from under that cloak, my boy." Draco whirled around, and, sure enough, Potter emerged from under the cloak, looking almost sheepish but not quite guilty enough to manage to pull of the expression.
- Potter, do you have no
? Are all Gryffindors so brash and careless?"
"Okay, Jisky," he said. "Well, before you report that- when was the last time you ate?"
"She's not venomous," Draco murmured to Harry. Harry reached out and unlatched the cage, slowly lowering his arm inside, hissing softly. The snake flickered its tongue at him and made its way up his arm to coil around his forearm; she was a baby at the moment, but she could grow to be two meters long.
