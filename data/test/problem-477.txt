The name sounded different when Malfoy said it. He spoke it with the same respect that he had for his own family name, pronounced so the pure blood could be heard, the tapestry of the Black family tree unfolding in every syllable.
“I assume you’ve realized you can’t have Death Eaters going to your school,” he said. “It makes perfect sense, so there’s no need to pretend otherwise.”
He picked up his cup and went to sit down on the couch. Malfoy stayed on the sill and lit another cigarette. There were a couple of newspapers spread out on the coffee table.
“Maybe… I mean there might be a source,” he continued. “But we don’t know that it’s something we can find, it might not be something tangible-“
"Can it wait five minutes? I know you're not feeling great right now, but Hermione wanted me to ask you if you apparated home last night, because-"
"I've got a muggle job, Potter,” Malfoy said, undoing the window latch. “Very hard to get through without cigarette breaks."
Someone, possibly one of the many aurors now on the rotating schedule of guard duty at Azkaban, had smuggled a camera into the tower. It was amateurish photography, but it wasn’t like the motives needed much framing to convey the horrors of the prison. Draco couldn’t stomach looking at more than a few of them before he had to put the paper down. He wished he had done it sooner. He had seen it all before, he didn’t need to be reminded. He didn’t think he had needed to read that caption either:
Granger had pulled out her wand. She held the book in her other hand and carefully recreated the pair of runes on the wall. Then she moved about a foot down the wall and did it again. She levelled her wand at the second set. Draco recognized the stance immediately, the way she placed her fingers on her wand, he had done it a thousand times himself by now. But it was very different from watching Potter cast the spell – he did it so effortlessly, made it look so straightforward, like it was just brandishing and shouting. Granger’s brow was furrowed in concentration, her hand tense on the wand - she made it look exactly as difficult as it was.
The anti-climax of their discovery settled in his chest as a tense lump of anticipation. He remembered his thoughts from the other night. As soon as they had even the slightest chance of success, they had to go. So if they thought this might work, if this was the solution they were going with, that meant they were going to Azkaban.
"It's the truth, and you know it,” he said. “Now pull yourself together and stop being a spoilsport."
He kept his eyes fixed on the wall. He was so aware of Potter’s presence it was like a physical touch against his side.
She shook his hand off and continued down the stairs. Hesitantly, heart still racing, eyes still on the professors, Draco followed her.
Hermione had started out in Magical Law Enforcement too, but before he had even pulled himself together to quit, she had moved herself to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and taken on a thousand projects at once. It was a paid internship, which Ron said was rare, and Harry was pretty sure she had a lot more influence than was normal for any intern anywhere. She was good at that sort of thing, taking charge and inserting herself where she thought she was needed. And she was doing important work. She was part of drafting the new werewolf legislation, and even though it seemed to cause her endless agony and Harry knew he could never do what she was doing, it was hard not to feel a little bit jealous sometimes.
Harry took another step into the opening. His patronus was quite a way ahead of him. Then, without even a flicker of warning, it winked out and an icy fist smashed through Draco’s mind, he felt himself falling as the hallway and the prison was swallowed by a vision of the polished floor of the Manor, of his father screaming and writhing with limbs twisting in odd directions, the sound of high pitched laughter ringing in Draco’s ears and his mother’s frantic voice: “
The seconds ticked away while they stood there, not looking at each other. He didn’t know why Malfoy had thought himself an idiot, it seemed to Harry he was the only one who deserved that title.
There was the sound of running footsteps behind him and Harry whipped around just as Malfoy caught up with him.
He was looking at Lovegood when he asked, but she didn’t say anything and it was Granger who answered him:
“And now you’re, what, snogging in secret in between classes? Having clandestine meetings at night?”
“That he should try casting it with an actual dementor there. That’s what I did when Lupin taught me. Except it wasn’t really a dementor, it was just a boggart, since my boggart is a dementor. And I’d found a boggart in this old classroom, so that’s how I got the idea, and – actually, none of that’s really important. Anyway, so we were in that old classroom down in the dungeons, right before I came up here, and it… It didn’t go well. I mean, it worked at first, but then everything went wrong, which seems to be how everything in my life generally goes. I hadn’t warned him what we would be doing, and apparently the dementors hit him really hard, so even though it wasn’t a real one, it was still pretty bad. And I panicked a bit, so instead of casting
“That’s not the same as knowing you’ll be able to cast it inside Azkaban. I mean, you probably can, but I think this might be good preparation.”
The silvery light illuminated both of them and Draco could feel the protection of the spell as a physical touch of warmth. He looked at Potter, smiling so much it hurt, and Potter was grinning back at him. It felt like doing magic for the first time.
“Don’t give me that shit,” said Potter loudly. “What the hell was that? I thought we were – and then you pull something like that?”
Harry had just turned away to go back down the stairs when he heard the lock snap and the door was yanked open.
Hermione leaned heavily on Harry, he felt her trying to shift her weight away from him, but her legs and feet were unsteady and he had to catch her from falling. He could hear Draco right behind him, breathing over his shoulder. They were moving ever so slowly back through the dementors. They kept close to his patronus, but where before the spell had meant that the dementors shied away from them as they made their way through, the stag now had to jostle them out of the way with it’s antlers, and from all sides they pressed towards them, desperate, starved mouths open, the ones in the front pushed closer by the hundreds behind them. They crowded against the shield, sucking in the white light. This deep in Azkaban, even two corporeal patronuses wasn’t enough to keep them out entirely and Harry could feel their effect seeping into him. He thought he could make out the light from Hermione’s tracking spell on a distant wall and he kept his eyes on that when he could, and when it disappeared from view, he just hoped the patronus was leading them in the right direction.
Draco took another deep breath, knowing this wasn’t all he needed to say, but hating that he had to expose himself like this.
She cast a look around their circle of friends who were happily discussing the upcoming match against Slytherin or, in the case of Parvati, happily playing up how exceptionally bored she was with the subject.
Malfoy looked surprised for a second, as if he had momentarily forgotten that this was why Harry was here; that Harry wasn't just hanging out in his apartment. It was odd.
“Don’t look so worried,” she said when he stood in front of her. “You’re not in trouble. I want to talk to you, but this is not an ideal time. Do you think you could come by my office after dinner this evening? Eight thirty should be a good time.”
An unhappy contortion flashed across her face, and he realized she probably already had, and that it hadn’t gone too well. He suppressed a smile.
Harry sighed inwardly. He was so tired of this. Why was she so stubborn? Why did they all look like they agreed with her?
"I don't know," said Potter. "I have no idea, actually. I know you’re an arrogant prat and you think being pureblood makes you better than other people, but it’s still quite a jump from being a spoiled brat and an arse at school to taking the Dark Mark. I actually can't imagine why anyone would want to be a Death Eater in the first place unless they were mad.”
Either way, Dumbledore wouldn’t make it through the night. He was dying, and he wanted his death to be useful. So Snape still shows up, commits the murder he has promised, and drags Draco with him, fleeing Hogwarts with the other Death Eaters. Draco doesn’t hear a word of the exchange when Harry catches up with them; he was told to keep running, so he does.
Harry tried to reconcile the image with the things Hermione had said, with the Malfoy he knew and hated. He wondered if Malfoy was acting – not the drunk part, he couldn’t have faked that, but the likeable parts. The part that had sent him the embarrassing note, the one that told him to leave and didn’t mean it, the one that was afraid to visit his father. Malfoy had admitted it at the pub, that he was using Harry. Harry wondered why he hadn’t just left as soon as he found out. It hadn’t seemed so obvious at the time that that was what he should have done. It still didn’t, really.
But Potter didn't let go, he just leaned into Draco a little more, his face so close Draco could smell the beer on his breath. Potter was staring at him, brow furrowed, his eyes swimming and unfocused.
“I…” Malfoy cleared his throat. “Well, I was wondering if… perhaps you might meet with me. Maybe over a drink.”
As he climbed the stairs to his dormitory, the thought struck him that perhaps the sense of urgency that he remembered feeling had had more to do with Potter and less to do with the prison itself – that perhaps this had mostly been about getting close to him, and he just hadn’t been able to admit that to himself. It did make sense when he thought about it like that – the more certain he had felt about Potter not abandoning him, the less urgent Azkaban had become. They were putting themselves in danger by rushing it. They had time, didn’t they? Perhaps they should even reconsider the possibility of a political solution.
Her voice finally became serious, hard and sharp the way it did when she would quiz him and Ron on homework:
Without their watches, he quickly lost sense of time. It reminded him of the Department of Mysteries, this endless walk down dark routes where they had no idea what awaited them. Draco looked scared. His eyes darted back and forth, he kept looking back over his shoulder. Harry tried not to worry about Ron and Ginny or Neville and Luna, wherever they were above them.
“Yesterday,” Harry said, not really looking at Malfoy. “I thought maybe we should talk about it. About what happened.”
“How can you say you're over him when it's been actual years since you had anything to do with him and yet you're
“Yes. She was an experimental witch, like my mother. We have some of her other books back home, she had some very interesting theories. I didn’t know there were any books about her dementor-research.”
Everything that happened between them happened when they were fifteen, except for that one lapse in sixth year, when everything was going to shit. Potter tried to kill him and Draco thought he had been figured out, but no aurors ever showed up to take him to Azkaban. No Death Eaters came to take him to the Dark Lord. Potter hadn’t snitched, and Draco couldn’t ask him why, and the one time he got a chance to, they made out in an empty classroom instead. And Potter found the mark on Draco’s arm. And he still didn’t tell anyone.
“I came back! I was here for the battle and I was here every year before that, I started the D.A., so don’t talk to me like I don’t know anything-“
It got colder the further down they went. Which wasn’t right, Draco realized. They shouldn’t be able to feel the effect of the dementors when they had a patronus with them. He cleared his throat
“We should go,” said Neville. ”They’ll have alerted the guards back on the main land. They could be here any minute.”
“The treatment mainly consists of conversation,” she said patiently. “It was recommended to me by both Ms Granger and several other students and parents with close ties to the muggle world. Because of this, Hogwarts has appointed four who are all parents of former Hogwarts students, so they already knew about our world, and they are specialized in working with minds that have been damaged by war. They work at St. Mungo’s and the students who see them floo there for their appointments – we thought it would be more discreet than to have them stay at the castle with Madam Pomfrey.”
And Harry was almost half an hour late. He hadn’t honestly expected Malfoy to still be there. He had kind of been hoping he wouldn’t be. But there he was. So Harry took a deep breath and squeezed past the tables, making his way towards Malfoy’s corner.
He had kissed a bloke. That was one thing. And he wanted to kiss him again, which was another. He wondered vaguely if this meant that he was queer, but he would rather not think about that. He didn’t have to decide about it now; it didn’t matter anyway, as long as no one knew.
They both fell quiet. In the other end of the common room, a flock of third years erupted in laughter. Ginny looked over at them. She was curled up in her chair in a sweater that was too big to be her own, it looked like she was melting into it. Harry couldn’t read the expression on her face. He wondered if she knew the third years. Maybe some of them had been in Dumbledore’s Army. He wondered if she felt old in the same way he did when he looked at them.
"I didn't want to bother them," he muttered, since it seemed like Ron wanted some kind of answer, and that was as good as any.
The doe took a step towards Harry and Draco followed. The dementors had retracted into the darkness, leaving a narrow path for Draco to be led back to the others.
Harry hadn’t thought about Malfoy in a long time. He hadn’t heard anything about him since the trials. As far as he knew, no one had heard from him. There were lots of people from Hogwarts Harry didn’t keep in contact with anymore, but he felt like he could hardly even go outside without running into someone – magical London wasn’t that big, after all. He had even seen Malfoy’s mother a couple of times. A while back he had actually bothered to ask around about it. It had seemed odd that Malfoy would be pardoned and then just disappear, but no one knew anything, and it wasn’t like Harry cared; he had been busy with auror training back then. So he had forgotten about him, and now the git had suddenly decided to turn up again, out of nowhere. It wasn’t like Harry looked forward to seeing him – in fact, with every hour that passed he dreaded it a little more – but part of him couldn’t help but be just a little bit curious.
“It used to be a werewolf. My boggart. That’s why it didn’t even occur to me… That’s why I didn’t figure it out.”
“Yet judging from the students who are actually in your house, the sorting hat doesn’t seem to care very much about that distinction, does it?”
“You know, I was reading something earlier. I didn’t know if it was worth anything, but I’ve been thinking about it, and it might be, so I need to get a hold of him soon,” she said, lowering her voice even though no one but him and Ron were within earshot. “In fact, we probably need to get a hold of everyone, but if you get the chance, will you tell him to get to the room when he can?”
“Really?” he said, cutting Harry off mid-sentence and lowering his wand. “You cast that sort of spell by thinking
And then the Death Eaters are waiting for them when they do. Hedwig doesn’t make it. George loses an ear, and Moody is killed. It’s another reminder that people Harry had come to think of as immortal are anything but. He doesn’t feel like he needed any more reminders.
Granger and Lovegood had taught them the runes. They didn’t have to understand them as long as they drew them correctly, so they moved forward in succession, spreading out over a stretch of wall, each etching a rune into the walls with the tip of their wands, then they all moved further down, repeated the process. The chain would run along the surface of the wall the way it had in the secret room. They had tested it across a window and it was able to breach the gap, so they assumed it would go across the cells as well as long as there was a rune on either side. The width of it was enough to shut the dementors out of the cells completely. And hopefully that would work.
But he didn’t really believe that. He had noticed Potter watching him quite a few times, and when Draco looked back at him and caught his eye, he would smile before he turned away. Draco wondered if anyone else noticed. Part of him wished they did, despite Potter wanting it to be secret and Draco knowing that he was right that it was better that way. He knew it was vanity, but he wanted people to see the way Potter looked at him – see that Draco Malfoy was wantable, worthy of a crush. And not just by anyone, by Harry Potter, who could have had whoever he wanted, but had chosen Draco for his hungry eyes.*
“I know, Malfoy. I just… I thought I was done with this, alright? I thought that I would never have to do this again. Or at least that it would be a very long time.”
He could see Mark from where they stood, still outside, leaning against a wall, just a silhouette against the light from inside.
Harry had to run from the transfiguration classroom to make it to his next class without being late. It was two floors up, and he was out of breath when he got there, still fuming and rushed with adrenaline. He could hear noise and chatter from inside, so he had made it before Binns. He stopped outside the door, taking a moment to steady himself and straighten his uniform.
“Your grades have dropped dramatically compared to previous years,” she began. “And you hardly ever participate in class anymore. I have noticed this during my own lessons as well. I know you’re very skilled in transfiguration, but it seems you’re not even trying. And your written assignments have, as you know, been far below your usual standard. There is also the issue of you skipping classes. As far as I can tell, this has been an especially big problem for my lessons, and I wonder why that might be?”
Harry was alone in the darkened living room at Grimmauld Place. Ron and Hermione had both gone to bed a while ago. Harry had considered doing the same. He had had a glass of firewhisky and then another one and he should probably have gone to his room and at least tried to go to sleep, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to, so he had stayed where he was, in the soft armchair in the living room, listening to the nighttime noises of the old house.
He handed her the cup. He had just been moving something about on the counter, the cup just happened to be in his left hand. He wasn't really paying attention. Her fingers closed around it and he let go, and then she wasn't holding it, it slipped from his grip and hers and the whole thing dropped, lid coming off, coffee spilling everywhere.
Malfoy was moving jerkily, Harry was sure the paper thin cups would shatter, the way he slammed them on the counter.
They changed the subject, but Harry couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy. The thing that bothered him most wasn’t that Malfoy was being an idiot again, it was how suddenly he had reverted back to his old self. It had come completely out of nowhere, when he had thought everything was absolutely fine. And the worst part about it all was that it forced him to admit that he had been wrong about giving him a second chance was. Right then, that stung worse than any of Malfoy’s insults.
“Tell me again, how it was you suddenly became good at Potions after sucking worse than I did?” said Ron.
!” he yelled, because he had wanted to yell that at someone ever since he found out. “Because that was his father’s animagus form, and I can’t even
He turned over in his bed, the rustling of the sheets seeming loud in the magically enhanced silence. He regretted casting the spell. On other nights when he had been awake, the sounds of the others sleeping had given him a sense of where he was. It was too dark to see anything and when the only sounds he could hear were his own, it made him feel detached from the world.
Harry followed where he was pointing to and saw the angular shape of a darkened house a bit further down.
“Why didn’t you come? Why didn’t you write me back? I mean, it’s not like my life revolves around you coming to my parties, but I don’t like to be stood up and I don’t like to be ignored, so you better have a pretty good excuse for being such a prick.”
Harry shook his head, and for a moment they just stared at each other. Then Harry’s face split into a grin. Ron started laughing too when he did, the relief and overtiredness washing over them, and there wasn’t anything funny about it, but then Harry was laughing because Ron was, and Ron was laughing at him.
“I know it hasn’t, alright, but I couldn’t stop thinking about all the ways it’ll become even more difficult if everybody finds out.”
"I think you can let go of me now," Draco said, trying to make his breathlessness sound like a laugh. "I trust you to stay vertical on your own."
Harry pulled out the folded piece of parchment. Apparently even the letters sent by the Malfoy family looked more expensive than those of normal people. The parchment was heavy, smooth and cream-colored, inlaid with a watermark of the Malfoy family crest, and the writing was in a beautiful cursive that it took Harry a while to decipher. It wasn’t a long letter and it was formal to the point of being impersonal, which was probably why Malfoy allowed him to read it. He had never thought about what sort of letters Malfoy would receive from his adoring mother, but this definitely wasn’t what he would have imagined.
Draco turned around. Harry had jammed his hands into the pockets of his robes. There was a frantic look in his eyes, like he too was about to bolt out the door after Pansy, or as if he was hoping Draco would.
Harry started and turned around, ready to explain away his presence at the pub, and saw Malfoy sitting by a table in a corner of the room where he hadn’t been visible from the door. Harry hesitated for a second by the counter before he walked over and pulled out a chair. Malfoy smirked at him. Both his hair and his clothes were dry and he looked as pristine as ever.
It’s past midnight when Draco hears the knock on his door. The summer nights are still bright, but this late the last of the blue twilight is gone, the attic is dark and the light by his bed casts long shadows crawling over the floorboards at the feet of all the rubbish and leftover furniture that occupies the space Draco doesn’t.
Harry glances around the room. They’re standing by the door, which Draco is still holding open, but now more like he has forgotten about it than as if he expects Harry to leave.
“I don’t know where that hostility is coming from, here I am, sincerely trying to save you from yourself, and then I’m met with such rudeness.”
His voice doesn’t sound like his own, it’s loud and shrill and terrified. And then Moaning Myrtle lets out a deafening scream:
Also, he had definitely not considered that when he insisted he wouldn't wait outside, that meant he would end up in Malfoy's bedroom.
He forced himself to relax his stance. Potter walked a few steps closer. His eyes didn’t leave Draco for a second and he held his wand level and aimed at Draco’s chest. He wondered vaguely if he would still be able to beat Potter in a duel.
But thinking about Ginny and watching Ron and Hermione stung less now than it used to. Which could possibly be attributed to Malfoy, which was endlessly weird.
And maybe Mr Weasley would look up to see what was going on and he would start – stand up, hesitate for a moment, and then he would stalk out of the room, unable to even look in their direction a second time.
“Yes, but how is that enough to get him off for attempted murder, cursing and probably torturing people, being pals with Bellatrix Lestrange and having Voldemort hanging around his house? If I were on the Wizengamot I would be thrilled at a chance to lock him away.”
There was a moment’s hesitation where neither of them moved to leave and Harry wasn’t sure what to do, because just going up the stairs would seem like they were pretending that nothing had happened, and he didn’t want that. He ought to say something to recognize that it was real. But then Malfoy leaned in and kissed him. And he supposed that worked to pretty much the same effect.
Draco spends the year trying to get poison and cursed artefacts into the school. He mends the broken vanishing cabinet. He cries alone and quietly in empty bathrooms as he realizes he is not supposed to succeed. He still jerks off to memories of Harry, and he doesn’t even bother to feel bad about it anymore.
The phone rang. Harry's heart jumped. He rushed over, managed to hit his shin on the coffee table and swore under his breath as he dropped onto the couch and scrambled to pick up the receiver.
“There’s Dean and Seamus – not quite sure what the status is with that at the moment, it’s not official or anything, but you know…” she shrugged, then picked up again: “And Ginny says Lavender and Parvati were together last year. She seemed so silly to me, but they all talk about her very differently now, it might just be because she’s – no, sorry, that was an awful thing to say. I’m worried about Parvati, though. She’s grown really quiet…”
Harry’s stomach did an uncomfortable flip. He knew that wasn’t what Ron meant, but it still sounded too much like what Luna had said. He continued:
The classroom was in a disused corridor of the dungeons far from both the Potions classroom and the Slytherin common room. The door was locked, but it only took a simple
It turned out the afternoon Draco and Harry had spent up in the Astronomy tower was going to be the last good weather they would get in a while. The very next day the sky had turned grey again and it was pouring down from the heavy bellies of ominously dark clouds. The students retracted back into the castle and holed up in their common rooms between classes.
Draco followed him, but they had only made it a few feet into it before Harry stopped and pulled Draco with him into a niche between two suits of armour. And then without letting go of Draco’s arm, he reached up with his other hand, pushed it into Draco’s hair and pulled him in for a kiss. And Draco’s heart convulsed in anxiety as much as excitement, because this time they weren’t hidden away in the astronomy tower or in the secret room – no one was going to walk by and notice them, but anyone could. And he let it happen anyway, let Harry push him back against the wall, his hand cupped around the back of Draco’s head, holding him in place, his tongue pushing into his mouth. Draco looped his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him back with him. Harry’s chest pressed against his own, his fingers clenched in Draco’s robes. Draco loosened his hold on Harry a bit, and Harry pulled back, looking slightly flushed but with a wide grin on his face.
The hand against his cheek held him in place and forced him to look at her until his vision grew blurry and he felt the warm tears spilling over and running down his face. She let go of his arm and pulled him into a hug.
He left quickly down the hall, and almost immediately slammed into someone walking in the opposite direction. The other boy had been in a hurry too and their heads knocked together painfully.
“Because I won’t be going to Azkaban with you. I’ve thought about it, and I’ll help you all I can with this part, planning and research and everything. I have an internship at the Prophet, so I can probably get into their archives, that might be useful. But I won’t be of any help in a battle situation, and honestly, I don’t want to risk my life for this.”
Harry glared at him. He was suddenly incredibly done with this whole thing. He should have listened to Ron. This had been an awful idea.
“Promise me you won’t let him hurt you. You don’t deserve that no matter what his friends think of you. And he isn’t worth it no matter how famous he is.”
He didn't tell Pansy about Potter's surprise visit. She might have sensed that there was something he wasn't telling her, but it was easier not to cave under her pointed questions when she was just a voice on the phone.
Thankfully, the street was deserted except for the two of them. Only about every other street lamp was lit, the sickly yellow circles beneath them seeming to serve more to highlight the darkness than to actually brighten the street. The houses were big but decrepit, looming hollow-eyed behind Georgian terraces and ornate iron railings. It looked like it might have been a wealthy neighbourhood once, but now the air had a distinct smell of piss and there were overflowing rubbish bins by nearly every front yard.
“You shouldn’t sound so surprised, Potter,” said Draco in the exaggerated, condescending drawl Pansy would use when she was mocking him.
Draco doesn’t kiss him this time. Harry leans his head back and closes his eyes when Draco reaches for his belt. His hand stings. After a while he tells Draco to stop and they both leave.
Draco wanted to hex him just for bringing that up. He hadn’t told anyone but Pansy about it. He could just imagine what his mother would make of it. She had already forgiven Potter for everything he had done to their family. If she found out that Draco owed him his life, she would never let him live it down.
“We all had to find ways to survive last year, and some of us didn’t have the option of hiding in secret rooms and trying to save the world by putting stink-bombs in Snape’s office.”
“I would prefer if we could talk face to face. I know you have no reason to want to meet with me, but I would be very grateful if you would… consider it, at least.”
Harry nodded. He stood awkwardly at the edge of the group, unsure of what to do with himself. Ginny was still scowling.
"Well, that went smoothly," he said. "I don't think even my father used to get off with that little effort, and I'm pretty sure he was bribing or blackmailing half the Wizengamot more or less continuously."
“No. No, he’s doing really well,” he said, though after that afternoon’s failure it didn’t feel entirely true. “It became corporeal yesterday, so we could have just stopped, but…”
“I don’t really have to conjure the memory,” he said slowly. “Not anymore, I think. I can just sort of… feel it. I know what my patronus is supposed to feel like, and it’s the feeling of the memory I use, but I don’t actually have to remember it.”
“No, not at all. I just need some air. I already finished the paper for Muggle Studies anyway,” he said, indicating Hermione’s roll of parchment.
Now, however, every sentence that crept over Malfoy’s lips was sleek and glossy and Harry had no idea what their conversation was even about or why they were sitting there, drinking firewhisky together as if they were friends.
He could still just leave. No one had noticed him yet, no one would stop him from simply slipping back out the portal-
Harry hesitated. He tried to think it through, past the total absurdity of the idea, of this conversation, but he was too tired, his mind too sluggish. And then he decided not to think about it, because fuck it.
He had thought so too. He wasn’t sure how to navigate the tight hold of the hand on his shoulder. He scrambled clumsily back from the corpse, his limbs still felt weirdly disconnected from his mind.
"So, Harry, are you going to get yourself a pint or are you just here to watch?" asked Irie when Draco had finished his introductions.
He never planned on talking to him about it. He had contented himself with knowing this was just something he would have to live with – the awareness that he had been that close to killing someone.  So it’s just a coincidence when they run into each other and happen to be in an empty corridor. If they had just kept walking, they could even have made it past that interaction, which Harry realizes only the second after he has stopped and they stand there, staring at each other. Malfoy has dark circles under his eyes, his lips are pressed into a hard, thin line. He isn’t going to say anything, he just watches Harry, while Harry struggles find a single word in the English language that’s less useless than “sorry.”
“I don’t know!” he said. “I don’t know anything about it except that it’s bad. I think it might be sort of like… like a very bright light, you know? You can’t look at it directly without hurting your eyes, but even though you don’t look at the source, you can still see the light - and maybe Azkaban is evil in the same way, where it hurts too much to think about it, so people just don’t, and instead it becomes this black spot that they work around without considering it, even the ones who guard the place, and the ones who sentence people to go to there. But just because we don’t look at the source that doesn’t mean the evil doesn’t affect us. Does that make sense?”
“I’ll take it as a compliment,” she said, but her smile was that of someone who likes the idea of murder, not receiving a compliment.
“We won’t make it. It’s been two hours already since we left the castle. We have to be back in three. This is taking us too long.”
Her eyes darted to him as she said it. Of course it was already obvious that the “unexpected complications” had quite a lot to do with house Malfoy losing what had previously been their almost absolute control over the paper, but he still had the strong, flickering impulse to hex her for being so indiscreet. She might have felt him tensing up, because she quickly continued talking:
Draco made his way back to his friends with the drinks, slamming the tray down on the table before dropping into his chair.
“It’s only a little past one,” Draco says. He’s gotten his voice back under control. He sounds cool, uncaring. Over it. “You’ve still got oceans of time to get your beauty sleep.”
“No dangerous spells,” said Ginny, holding Pansy’s wand out to her. “I didn’t break the rules either. If it had been real, it would not have been
Silver light, the shape of a snake blinked into existence, then collapsed. Hermione shifted her weight against Harry, her breathing was beginning to sound troubled again.
"I'm not going to apologize for getting drunk at a pub," Harry said, dropping his plate and silverware loudly in the sink. "That's what they're for."
Harry stared at him. He hardly recognized him like this, and for a moment he wondered if he actually had gone mad. There was a slightly manic look in his eyes.
Malfoy, who was halfway to the door, turned and looked back at him with an eyebrow raised in a question, half smiling. And it hit him again, hard this time, how much he actually liked him. How much he cared about him. How nice he looked, too. Harry had always thought that Malfoy looked exactly like Lucius, but now he thought the similarity was more in his mannerisms than his actual appearance. Without the haughty arrogance that both father and son had projected, they really weren’t that much alike. He couldn’t quite recall what Malfoy’s mother looked like, but he thought it was possible that apart from the sleek, white blonde of his hair, he was actually taking after her. But he had never seen her smile like that either.
Harry grinned and swung a leg over his Firebolt. They kicked off and rose high into the air, two arrows shooting straight up towards the clouds. Simultaneously they broke their ascend and curved, racing each other to the treeline.
She was stabbing at him, but he tried to appreciate it. It would only get worse when they arrived at the school, so he might as well try to get used to it.
“I suppose I should go back to Ravenclaw now,” she said. “I’ll see you later, Harry. Enjoy your pie.”
“I am serious. It’s just as she said, the Carrows gave us special treatment, and in return they expected us to be cooperative and sympathetic towards their cause and sometimes to be cruel, so we were. Especially the older Slytherins, we were hoping to take some of the attention off the younger ones.”
“I didn’t mean to – I didn’t mean for something like that to happen,” he pushed on. “And I didn’t know it would bother you so much, but of course I should have thought of that. I wasn’t messing with you when I said it’s not a big deal for wizards. I thought you’d know, but you can ask anyone, they’ll tell you the same thing.”
When he glanced up again, Malfoy was seated at the Slytherin table, no longer looking in Harry’s direction.
Malfoy switched on an electrical kettle in the little kitchen. He opened a cupboard over the sink, taking out a teapot and two delicately painted china tea cups.
“There’s no reason they would check our beds. We’ll be back before they even wake up tomorrow. And if we’re not, Dean and Seamus are going to be the least of our problems.”
He breathed out deeply and closed his eyes for a moment. Why had it all turned out this way? This was never how his life was supposed to go. He wasn’t supposed to end up like this, penniless and lonely and queer and living like a squib, slowly losing contact with all of his old friends and on top of all that, still unable to get over his stupid school time crush.
The silver stag was the first to join the hare, but it was soon followed by an otter, a terrier, Draco’s snake, Ginny’s fox and – surprisingly and clichéd – Longbottom’s lion.
He can’t believe he has to say it, that he has to explain that to Malfoy. As if it hasn’t been years since it was as simple as
“Ron, I think Harry is right,” said Hermione. “I don’t think Malfoy is lying about having been to Azkaban. I’m not so sure about whether he wants it destroyed or if he wants to free his father or something else – it
She sounded so calm. Draco stared at her and tried to look past that, tried to see the girl he had talked to in the secret room just a few days earlier, who had been fracturing under the pressure of the secret and the quest. He couldn’t imagine why she would tell them in this way, or why she hadn’t asked him or Lovegood to do it instead. He caught Lovegood’s eye, but he couldn’t read her expression. All the others looked perplexed.
She was looking past Draco at what was behind him and he twisted around to follow her gaze. He wasn’t surprised to see that his patronus was gone, but Granger’s and Harry’s were still keeping up the protective barrier around them. Their light made it harder to make out the dementors in the dark, but they were there. He could still hear their rattling breaths, and for a moment Draco felt like he was back in the wizard’s memories. He looked away.
One day a third person’s handwriting began appearing on his and Granger’s notes, making strange connections from the contradicting information from different sources. He mentioned it to Pansy, and she said she had seen Lovegood up there once or twice, messing with their notes. After that, he generally ignored the additions.
“Potter and Weasley, would you mind being quiet?” said Slughorn loudly. “This is a very delicate and advanced potion, and it is not one you would want to mess up on. Now, when you slice the ginger root-“
Potter smiled, and Draco could feel his heartbeat all the way to the tips of his fingers. And then Potter moved his hand from Draco's shoulder to his neck, fingertips resting lightly against his skin, surely able to feel his pulse hammering out the rhythm of Draco's panic as Potter halfway leaned halfway stumbled into another kiss. It was clumsy, just a brief press of soft lips, a second where Draco could smell Potter's awful breath when he pulled away, the pressure of Potter's hand on his shoulder as he braced against him for balance. Draco's mind didn't even have time to catch up before it was over. Potter's eyes were half-closed, he seemed to be looking down at where his hand was resting on Draco's arm as if he too was confused about what it was doing there.
“This is the obvious route that we’ve all taken the last two times, right?” she said. “And the first alternative would be to go down the east staircase from here instead…”
“Honestly, Harry, I don’t think that’s a good idea. Neville made it sound like the DA was practically a refugee camp within the school last year, not really a duelling club. And even when we started it back in fifth year, the purpose was teaching kids how to fight and defend themselves. I know we joked about it, but we were turning them into soldiers.”
They were two weeks into the school year and Harry still felt weird about putting on his uniform. He felt silly, like an adult who was pretending to be a kid, like he was going bald and the uniform was too small and everyone could tell, but just pretended like nothing was wrong. He knew the out-of place feeling was only in his head – just looking at them, it wouldn’t be possible to tell the actual seventh years from the ones who were redoing their seventh. But maybe it was just that all the students were looking older than they should. He had noticed the way the little kids would get quiet near certain classrooms, the grave expressions on their faces, that were completely wrong on children of that age.
“You knew it was there,” he says. “So why did you- did you just want to make sure? Figured you could bear fooling around one last time, you know, get a chance to feel around…“
He should have waited, Harry thought. This was not the right time. But if he had waited, he probably would have lost his nerve.
She turned to Irie and Chris, who had stopped in the middle of whatever they had been doing and were staring wide eyed at the spectacle, at the spilled coffee and the screaming girl and Draco who stood frozen and silent in the middle of it.
Harry pulled on his jacket and shoved his hands into his pockets - and then his fingers closed around the wand. His stomach dropped. He had completely forgotten about it. He had forgotten the whole reason why he was even at Malfoy's place in the first place.
“Well, then it is only good that you do it yourself so you can get better at it, isn’t it?” she said triumphantly.
Harry dug his hands into his pockets. His mind was still hazy from drinking. Words and thoughts were coming slowly. Malfoy jutted out his chin.
“But even then… from what I’ve heard, people go mad long before that. I wouldn’t have thought anyone could survive even a year. Twelve is just… it sounds impossible.”
“With my luck, the castle would be overtaken by feral nargles the first time I ever tried a sleeping potion.”
“I didn’t have Dark Arts with you, but I know what Parvati and Neville told me - they said you were practically begging to get to cast the cruciatus curse, and that you and your friends were laughing when you left the classroom.”
Harry leans forward, hands planted against the lockers, breathing deeply, feeling calm and endorphins wash through his body. Draco is still on his knees, steadying himself with a hand against Harry. Harry listens to his breathing and watches his crouching form, his blonde head, and he doesn’t feel anything except far away from himself.
Her voice was firm, but her eyes were wide and scared. Harry wished suddenly that they hadn’t left Ron upstairs. He was better at keeping his head than Hermione, and she looked like she was about to panic.
eventually reject the theory,” said Lovegood, talking over Granger. “She found that it was much more likely that it was caused by wrackspurts. Sadly, she died young before she could publish her work. My mother spent a lot of time assembling her notes.”
They walked as a group towards the gates. Draco longed for his bed and the blessed promise of exhausted sleep. Now that the excitement of it all was over, he could feel how tired, beaten and cold he was.
“Drink the whisky, Potter, I promise it’ll make all of this more bearable. And remember, this is not a condition. I’m still going to keep the promises I made you earlier, whether you accept my suggestion or not, but I also propose that we get to know each other. You don’t have to publicly declare anything about me, though of course if an incident does occur where we have to interact in front of others, I hope you will be civil with me. It won’t be public, but it’s also not going to be a secret.”
He flipped the magazine open to the page of the article. There was the picture of Heather and Ginny. It had been taken from afar and the quality hadn't become better by being plastered over half a magazine spread, but you could still make them out: the two of them in their uniforms, walking off the field after a match, Ginny with her arm around Heather's shoulder, leaning in to kiss her cheek. And next to them was some awful portrait of Harry that he was pretty sure was a lot older than the one of Ginny, but he supposed they didn't bother hunting him down for pictures of his angry face any more - they must have at least a couple of hundreds stowed away in their offices by now.
She gave him a stern look that reminded him terribly of Professor McGonagall. It was so odd the way Granger occasionally behaved like a teacher towards her peers, though he suspected she had toned it down quite a bit over the years. He remembered her being completely insufferable when they were younger. It was no wonder she had been so unpopular.
“Yeah, if the choice is between spending the night battling whatever dark shit Sirius’ family has stowed away up there or going to a pub, I think I actually do prefer Malfoy.”
Ron and Harry ate their toast and Harry made more tea. A little while later Hermione's voice called to them from upstairs:
, not unless he knew, because apparently he was an unnoticeable legilimens or something like that, and this was him trying to be
There had been a short period of numbness after that. Draco hadn't left the grounds of the Manor much, hadn't really seen anyone. He'd developed a creeping anxiety of staying inside and had spent his days going on long walks in the surrounding countryside. And in the night, he'd returned to the house and to his room to spend endless hours slipping in and out of sleep, in and out of claustrophobic dreams of the days when they had shared their home with Voldemort. There were locked rooms they would never use again; he had avoided them in the daytime but inevitably ended up there in his dreams: the cellars where they had kept prisoners, the dining hall where Voldemort had held court, the bedroom he'd sometimes disappeared into and where he'd presumably slept. The aurors had taken special interest in those rooms of course, and there was hardly anything left in there save for the wallpaper and the curtains. There had been fewer searches than in the period before the trials, but they'd still happened once in a while. Draco had felt like a ghost, trapped in the gloomy halls of his gutted childhood home.
There was an old lady with a walker making her way past a group of boys by the bus stop on the other side of the street. Harry followed her progress with his eyes. His heart was beating too fast. One of the boys laughed.
Potter didn’t say anything. The room was dim around them, most of the candles on the walls still burning, but the light didn’t extend far. The rest of the school felt very far away.
“Just forget about it, Harry. It’s all fine. I’ll go talk to her. And if you still don’t feel safe, you can obliviate her. Or you can wait and obliviate your own friends when they find out. Do whatever the fuck you want.”
“If we had thought so, we wouldn’t have allowed you to come back in the first place,” she said. “I assure you this has nothing to do with the role you played in the war – at least not directly.”
Potter opened his eyes, which was sort of spectacular to watch when you were this close to his face. Every time, Draco was a little bit surprised at how green they were.
Ron didn't laugh. He crossed his arms and leaned his shoulder against the doorframe, frowning up at Harry.
They both laughed. It was weird. Harry had grown up muggle too, but he couldn't remember ever finding the names of the houses funny. He supposed he had been too preoccupied with the wands and the ghosts and the magical portals to hidden train stations, he hadn't had time to consider that the
Harry pretended he hadn't noticed. He shook the guy's hand and explained about the apparition. He didn't even get to say that he would happily deal with the consequences, the man was already waving it off as a trivial matter, and Malfoy was rolling his eyes.
He explained his theory again, the one he had previously presented to Potter, that Azkaban had somehow turned itself into a blind spot, unwatchable and unquestionable, that no one could hold in their mind for too long at a time. Granger listened carefully. Twice she noted something down on her parchment.
“The trip back will be faster,” said Draco. “It won’t take us as long to get back as it took to get here.”
His eyes settled on Draco maybe for the first time since they apparated, and there was a flicker of grim awareness on his face.
“No. Well, yes, I suppose you could say that, but not really,” he babbled. “I like talking to you, I honestly do. I thought the feeling was mutual.”
It was the first time in this school year that anyone had actually targeted him with a jinx rather than just insulting him, but the little incident had made him exponentially more paranoid. All day he kept looking over his shoulder and tensed every time he passed other students, even if they were only second years. In the evening he was late for dinner and was rushing down the stairs when a bat swooped down and brushed past him inches from his face. He started and actually managed to pull out his wand and get into a duelling stance before he realized that he wasn’t under attack, no one had cast a bat bogey hex and that the hall was empty. The bats hanging from the ceiling and occasionally dropping down to flap around above the marble staircase were some of the early Halloween decorations that had already been put up. Draco put his wand away and took a deep breath to compose himself. He continued down the stairs just as another boy came hurrying from the opposite direction.
Light flared from the tip of Hermione’s wand, illuminating the darkness, the staircase and the dementors. They were everywhere. Close, towering over them on every side, only just out of reach of the patronuses. Draco made a strangled noise behind him. Harry felt his stomach twist. Each winded breath was a cold stab down his throat. He had never seen this many dementors in his life; they were packed together so tightly the movement of one was a wave through all of them, the mass parting ahead of their little group and retracting again behind. Harry hadn’t noticed the sound before, in the dark it had seemed only a draught of wind. Now he could see the gaping mouths and the sound dissolved into hundreds of individual breaths.
Harry took a deep breath. He glanced down the table, but it was almost empty now and the closest people were almost at the other end.
. Merlin, if it had been one of your people who came through that door, that thought wouldn’t even have crossed your mind, you wouldn’t even think of violating any of their minds like that. You might not like her, but you do
He heard the soft sounds of their blankets, then the chink of the curtain rings. He pulled his knees up, rested his arms on them as he pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes. He felt wide awake. He took a couple of deep, shaky breaths. He tried not to remember what he had dreamt.
He reached out towards the bars of the cell door, but then stopped, glancing down at the thread of silver that ran across them. Harry was close enough now that he could have reached out to pull him back, but he didn’t. Instead, he looked into the cell. Through the shimmer of light, he could make out the figure of a man huddled under a blanket, his face peeking out but half obscured by shadows. His cheeks were sunken and his skin ashen, and Harry hardly recognized him without his long, silky hair. Of course Harry had known Lucius would be there somewhere in Azkaban, Draco had told them. But he hadn’t spared it a single thought that they might find him. They had to have passed him on the way down too and he hadn’t even noticed.
He got up to find a pen and extracted a piece of parchment from a pile of Hermione’s drafts of articles and petitions. He jotted down the address.
respectively. Draco remembered them from his own read-through. They were from one of the chapters that made no sense at all.
“This whole idiotic thing started because I thought some things might have changed after the war and – I don’t know, maybe I felt guilty about some of the things that happened to you, and it really messed me up seeing you at your trial, and you played it well, I’ll give you that. For a while I really thought that this,” he gestured to both of them, “whatever it was could work out somehow. And then I was reminded what an absolute shitstain you are, and I’m not going to forget that again. I never want you near me or any of my friends again.”
“Yeah, right,” said Ginny, turning back to her own table as Slughorn began explaining the theory behind brewing the advanced antidote to the curses they had read about in their homework.
Somehow it was more painful to hear Malfoy tell it this time. He looked much more uncomfortable than he had during their detention and for a moment Harry regretted having asked so many of his friends to come.
Draco is holding himself rigidly, Harry must be able to feel how tense he is. His hold on Draco’s arm is loose, he could pull away if he wanted to, but he doesn’t. And Draco knows he has to ask, even if he can feel his throat closing up around the words, even if he doesn’t want to know.
“Well,” she said. “I’ve had to hear from professor Slughorn of all people that you’re planning on taking a year off? Apparently, Mr Malfoy told him.”
“I fell asleep in transfiguration once,” he said. “Very scary thing waking up to McGonagall standing over you with that look in her eyes. Can’t recommend it.”
“I don’t know!” Harry snapped. “Maybe I just like talking to him, and maybe I want to do that without having to think about how that affects everyone’s feelings. Why does
He only needed to get Potter by himself for a few seconds so they could set up a meeting, but there never seemed to be a chance. In one of his more desperate moments, he had considered pulling the detention-trick again, but Potter didn’t want people to find out. A second showy classroom fight and subsequent detention probably wouldn’t lead anyone to draw the right conclusions, but it might still end up pushing Potter away. The last thing Draco wanted was for him to decide that it was too risky and call it off. Draco wasn’t going to fuck it up by calling attention to himself.
There were more potions, more spells, more sharply smelling ointments. Harry paced between the beds, cringing whenever another sob of pain escaped through Hermione’s gritted teeth. Ron stood like frozen next to the bed, his face pale and worried. He started when Madam Pomfrey suddenly stopped to look at him.
He stepped inside to find Granger sitting on the sofa with her legs pulled up and her face turned to the windows where raindrops were hurling themselves against the glass and trickling downwards in tiny rivers. There were no open books near her or even on the table and she sat unmoving, lost in thought, as if she hadn’t even noticed him. He cleared his throat and she started.
the Ministry, you're lucky that sounds enough like a muggle thing that no one picked up on it. If you'd brought up the Wizengamot, we would have been screwed."
"Seriously, Potter?" Malfoy said and Harry could almost see the indignant sneer on his face. "I'm trying to be
He could see one auror lying on the floor right by the door, but the other three were still standing. Ginny was the farthest away from him, quickly retreating down the gallery as she took on one auror by herself, throwing curses like mad and dodging the attacks as well as she could in the narrow space between the wall and the railing. Between her and Harry, the other three were duelling the remaining two aurors, who still hadn’t noticed him and Draco.
*I borrowed the plant that Draco and Luna work with in Herbology from The Monster Blog og Monsters. Source: http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/post/111124644250/hell-bramble-or-acheronta-movebo-one-of-the-most
“I did. I wouldn’t be able to stay back here not knowing what was happening to all of you, or if something did happen I don’t think I could live with knowing that perhaps I could have prevented it if I had been there.”
“That was probably his own decision, to show us all how adult and independent he is now. I heard he was pissed that we have to come back.”
There was a beautiful dining room at Grimmauld Place, but it had taken a long time to get it lightened up, remove the ugliest paintings and the grimmer decorations. In the meantime, they had all gotten used to eating in the kitchen. Harry liked it better there anyway; it was cosy, a bit more like the Burrow. The dining room felt formal and it was too big for three people anyway.
“Yeah, it’s good,” said Weasley. “Big enough to hold all of us, and if we push back the furniture, I think there’ll be space for practising spells.”
Until they tell him he’s being moved again. To the Weasley family home. Where Potter is currently staying.
Harry picked a workstation and pulled out his potions textbook. He listened to Slughorn instruct Malfoy on how he wanted him to catalogue newly received ingredients for the potions class.
Harry opens his mouth and closes it again when no words present themselves. For a second there is just silence as this new truth hangs between them, as the words reverberate in Harry’s skull, reshaping distant memories of slips of paper, whispered times, empty classrooms.
“It’s alright, Harry,” she said. “I think we all overreacted a bit. So what do you think we should do about Azkaban?”
He didn’t return to the tower until late, and when he did, he was relieved to find the common room empty. He was almost at the stairs to his dormitory when he heard a noise behind him and started.
“You’re not in a hurry, are you? The weather is terrible, so I don’t think we’re going anywhere for a while.”
He’s been trying not to think about that. It makes it seem ridiculous that he isn’t going back – he knows he needs to find the horcruxes, to stop Voldemort, but if there are going to be Death Eaters at Hogwarts, people will get hurt. It will be worse than anything Umbridge ever did. He ought to be there, and he can’t.
The four days passed uneventfully and so fast Harry felt sure they must have skipped at least one day entirely. He had left potions that afternoon and when Draco passed with a whispered “see you tonight”, he had had a moment of confusion where he had no idea what he could have meant.
He pushed off from the wall and took an uncertain step forward, losing his balance almost immediately. Draco surged forward and grabbed his arm, reacting on reflex rather than intent, and before he could extract himself from that blunder, Potter had grabbed onto him and was leaning heavily against him.
“We can’t,” said Hermione sounding reluctant at having to argue his part. “Malfoy is the only one who has been to Azkaban. We’ll need him.”
Then they heard Mrs Weasley’s voice calling out to them over the noise. A cold hand grabbed Harry’s wrist. He looked up at Draco’s strained face. Harry took his hand.
Harry slipped out the door and back into bed. If Neville hadn’t been awake he might have taken his Firebolt and gone flying for a bit, that would have calmed him down.
“Asleep, as far as I can tell,” he said, still speaking barely above a whisper. “I think they do actually cast silencing charms on the drapes…”
He knew he should be grateful that they’re trying to get him out, it’s obvious that few of them want to, it’s just that it’s difficult to be grateful when you’re scared. And he is. All the time. It’s a different type of fear from living at the Manor – he’s escaped the oppressive terror of knowing he was sharing his home with monsters, that his life or death was entirely dependent on their whims, but it’s been replaced by the constant paranoia about when they will catch up with him. He tries to be grateful, but it’s so difficult to remember what one kind of fear felt like and it’s very easy to be consumed by the one that’s currently happening.
Harry grimaced. He had gotten somewhat used to people being star struck by him. He was good at shouldering through; enough one-syllable replies usually made people stop. And it wasn't so much that it was bad when people did it, it was just a little embarrassing and it felt undeserved. But this was different. This was the Ministry, acting like the law didn't apply to him just because of who he was - and that wasn't just embarrassing. It made his skin crawl.
They had slowed down and were gliding quietly through the air. Harry’s heart was still pounding, but he could feel the shock seeping out of him. He was watching Malfoy, who rolled his eyes at him.
“You're nothing to them," he continued. "Being a Malfoy isn’t much to brag about anymore. Are you really so sure you’re still part of that
When Harry returned to Hogwarts after the holidays he was feeling better than he had in months. They could see the end now, which meant that Hermione was already stressing over exams, but to Harry they still felt far away. Classes only picked up slowly after the break and there wasn’t a lot of homework. He spent his free time playing quidditch on the grounds, drinking tea in the common room, and visiting Hagrid with Ron and Hermione, which they hadn’t done a lot that year.
Mark didn't work at Starbucks. He was one of Maya and Irie's friends, but apparently didn't need to be introduced to anyone but Draco. Irie asked maybe-Josh to move over, but he said he needed to be getting home anyway, so Mark took over his chair instead. He barely had time to sit down before Irie sent him and Draco to get more beer.
He hadn’t been staring, but when he entered the Great Hall, his eyes had sought Potter out at the Gryffindor table. They had exchanged what felt like a meaningful glance, except he wasn’t sure what they had been trying to say. And then when he sat down at the Slytherin table he found he could still see Potter, and he had caught the git looking at him three times so far, which was unnerving.
“Yes, that is an excellent idea. We’re leaving,” said Daphne, grabbing Blaise’s arm and practically dragging him with her.
“Yes, the DMLE and the Auror Office have been headhunting all of “the resistance” for jobs, but they don’t want them until after they’ve taken their exams, apparently. I almost feel sorry for Granger – all that hard work and it turns out they’re just going to hand out high profile jobs in the Ministry to every mudblood who tried to die in the battle.”
“That’s not what I meant. I think it was great back then, when we needed it, but we don’t anymore. We need to learn how to not be at war.”
Draco flinched. Hermione looked like she wanted to break his nose, and maybe he remembered that she almost did once. He drew himself up.
He turned his broom around, trailing behind Malfoy in a lazy curve. They made their way to the village in silence with Malfoy leading the way.
Draco jerked his head back and Potter stepped away from him so fast he wasn’t sure he didn’t apparate.
“I talked to her the other day. She came up to me after Herbology and said that she was very sorry for making up names about me and that she wouldn’t be mean to me while we were in the DA together, but if I didn’t like having her around, she would do her best to avoid me.”
They went down another staircase and then the auror unlocked a heavy iron door and a gust of cold air brushed against them, making Draco shiver. He hesitated for a second, before stepping through.
a few years ago. They only made a few, since it’s pretty much the same broom just with a few adjustments.”
“Actually, that applies to all situations,” said Ginny. “We shouldn’t talk to each other outside of this room in case people notice. Obviously we don’t talk much now, but we’ll need something like the coins for arranging new meetings.”
He was probably thinking of Rita Skeeter. He supposed there were certain similarities, if you didn’t know Pansy well.
“And you won’t,” she said. “We can choose how we want to remember people. To me, your father will always be the man he was before the Dark Lord ruined him-“
“Would’ve been a bit hard to explain why you’re coming to stay with us in August if we hadn’t,” said Ron.
And he supposed sometimes standing next to Harry Potter had its perks; the bartender's irritation melted off his face the moment he caught sight of him. Draco rattled off the drinks he wanted before the gawking idiot could start asking Potter for his autograph. He drummed his fingers impatiently on the counter top and tried to ignore that Potter was still right next to him. He managed it for nearly twenty seconds.
“That’s good,” she said looking down at her notes. “I didn’t get all of it, so do you think you could write it down later? As well as anything else you remember. Maybe draw some of it for us too, that might be useful.”
Maya started laughing again, and the corners of Irie's mouth twitched, which kind of undermined the menacing stare she had been giving him.
They were on their way down another broad staircase, they couldn’t even see far enough to make out the wall to their left and only saw glimpses of the railing to their right.
All noises in the dormitory seemed louder that evening. Putting on his pyjamas, brushing his teeth, joking around with the others, all of it made him feel like he was an alien of some sort going through the daily motions of being Harry Potter with no idea what that actually meant. Harry hoped it was only to him that Ron’s laughter sounded so fake.
He’s aware that he’s probably doing an incredibly shitty job, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind, he gasps the second Harry touches him, he’s ridiculously hard and every time Harry moves his hand to stroke him, he’s rewarded with another soft moan. It doesn’t take long before he comes, shaking in Harry’s arms.
A week after Potter’s visit, Draco was meeting Irie and a couple of the others for their usual routine of beer and small talk that would turn to gossip that would turn to lewd jokes that inevitably led to all of them staggering home when they were too plastered to be coherent. He was on his way out when the phone rang. For a fleeting second he had the ridiculous thought that it might be Potter. It wasn't.
might change their angle on you again. Not that I would mind, I do think they were onto something with that whole “Potter the nutter”-series. It might help deflate your ego a bit as well.”
But he remained seated, and when they were all gathered, Potter crossed over to the door and locked it. Longbottom hadn’t sat down either; he was walking around the room, muttering silencing spells at the windows. Granger was pulling quills and parchment out of her bag. She had settled herself with her legs pulled up in one of the chairs and was taking down notes. He couldn’t read what she was writing from where he sat, but he suspected it might be an agenda for the meeting. It was incredible how that girl would turn everything into a school project. He wondered if she had made time tables and to-do lists for taking down the Death Eaters and defeating the Dark Lord. She probably had.
Draco had only managed to walk about five metres down the hall after he had split up with Potter, before he had to stop and steady himself. He slumped back against the wall and closed his eyes for a moment. Somehow he felt worse than he had after their fight. At least that incident had felt like something he had controlled.
“But Malfoy hated being a Death Eater, didn’t he? And he was very young when he joined.” said Hermione.
“I’m not sure,” he said. “I just think – even if all the dementors were removed, there might be something evil left. Something deeper. Like the walls would still drive people mad.”
“She’s not dumb. She would have figured it out eventually anyway. But I talked to her and she won’t tell anyone. It can still be a secret.”
He felt a violent flash of anger towards the calm, dignified woman across from him, who was so old and claimed to be so good, but who didn’t care about this evil just as nobody else cared. Just as he knew they wouldn’t.
“Anyway, Potter told me learning the patronus charm might help with the nightmares, so I asked him if he would teach me.”
“Look, shouldn’t we at least talk about the possibility that he might be lying to us?,” said Ron. “How do we even know that he went to Azkaban?”
“Sure,” he said. “I’ll start calling you Harry as soon as you start calling me Draco. See you Monday,
By the time he made it back to Grimmauld Place, he had let himself slip into completely rewriting the pointless conversation in his head. He had had no reason to be polite to him, he should have let himself yell everything he had ever wanted to yell at Malfoy, at least
“Before the holidays, you seemed to be improving. In fact, I thought it seemed you were doing… rather well.”
“The Malfoy thing,” she said, “I think you should drop it. I can tell you’re about to get yourself really worked up about it, and I honestly don’t think there’s anything going on. Nothing serious and nothing that concerns us anyway. If he’s having a fight with his friends, then fine, let him.”
“I think Potter still sort of believes that it was all because of the Death Eaters, so I tried to explain why it’s not. How it’s an entire system, not a single incident, not just one evil person. How all the old families have been running the country for centuries and how they’ll probably continue to do that for the coming centuries too. And how we’re playing some sort of political game in Slytherin, and if I ever have kids they’ll be playing that game too, befriending the Zabinis or the Greengrasses, or whoever is the most important pureblood family at that time.”
“So what, you want all of us to be pals now? I can deal with him during the DA-meetings, or whatever they are, but I won’t pretend I like him.”
“See you around,” he said with a smirk and slipped away, another Slytherin quickly taking his spot by the table.
“Maybe you could have been… Maybe you would have changed sides earlier. Before it all became so serious.”
and then kept everyone else at arm’s distance for the next seven years. Can you honestly say you would be able to properly trust someone you didn't even
The hallway was thankfully empty when he got there. He tried to be quiet, but they must have heard him anyway. He had only just stepped into his shoes when Hermione showed up. Ron didn't. Maybe that was what they had discussed while he was on the phone, the best
Harry had a hard time believing that Malfoy’s friends would abandon him after a fight if they had stuck with him until this point. And though Harry had noticed Malfoy’s exclusion from his usual pack of Slytherins, the otherwise alert system of gossip within Hogwarts hadn’t picked up on it, which meant the fight, whatever it had been about, couldn’t have been too dramatic.
He just nodded. Remembered red blood swirling over a waterlogged bathroom floor. He took another swig of his beer.
“Fine. Whatever. Come see me when you have some free time, okay? Don’t forget me just because you’ll be best mates with Harry Potter now.”
“Crates are quiet again,” he announced. “I’ll drop them by the store on my way to work. If they blow up they should do it there-”
She sat on the edge of the sofa, her arms resting on her knees and what looked like all of her notes spread out on the table in front of her. A couple of the books lay open too, with the strange one at the centre. She looked up when he came in.
“Sure it isn’t. I know you, Draco, I can tell you’re still agonizing over last year, and apparently it isn’t enough for you to just lay low until it’s blown over. You think you need some sort of redemption and that being friends with Potter will make you feel better.”
No one said anything. The boat reached the dry beach of the island and dragged itself up on the sand. The aurors jumped out and Draco and his mother followed. He looked back out to the steel grey sea. He wanted to run away. He did not want to go any closer. He did not want to know what was inside. Still, he felt his body moving towards the tower, put one foot in front of the other. The urge to flee was overwhelming. The fear felt primeval, as if the aversion to the horror ahead was suddenly the most deeply rooted instinct in his body. But he pushed the feeling back. He followed the others across the island, telling himself that he wasn’t really there. It wasn’t really happening.
“That’s none of your business. Now may I remind you that I am not the only one who is out past curfew, and I suspect that our new headmistress might punish even the chosen one for breaking school rules. Personally, I’m not enjoying this conversation in the least, so unless you’re going to hex me in the back when I turn around, I’m going to leave.”
They were doing homework in the Gryffindor common room. Harry had been checking his watch every thirty seconds or so for the past five minutes. He was supposed to meet with Malfoy two minutes ago. He still hadn’t decided if he was going or not.
“That’s what Hermione said, isn’t it? We could allow him in on it and all, get him to tell us what he knows and see if this was something we still thought needed to be done, and then if it was, we could see if we trusted him enough to bring him along. And we don’t.”
“Yeah, well try to be nice to her about it. We’re all trying to deal with things our own way. She’s just worried about you because she spent all of last year trying to keep you alive, and then you went ahead and died anyway.”
Harry took a deep breath before he pushed the door open and went in. He dropped into the empty seat next to Ron.
He didn’t know what to tell them. They were all looking at him as if he had betrayed them, and he realized that was something he had been waiting for – had been dreading for years now. He had imagined it a thousand times, what it would be like when he finally let them down. He had thought it would be over something more inevitable, that when he eventually failed to live up their expectations, it would be because his luck had finally run out and there was some miracle that he couldn’t pull off. This was all just bad decisions. It was something he should have been able to avoid.
He turned his head very slowly to look at her. He opened his mouth, but didn’t say anything. Draco looked at his mother. Why had she wanted to do this?
“And the other day,” Malfoy continued, speaking more carefully but still without taking his eyes off Harry. “The things I said – I’m not going to pretend that I didn’t say them. I know I did, and I’m sorry, but I don’t think I would have said any of it if I hadn’t been to Azkaban. While we were there, I accidentally got out of reach of the patronus. It was only a couple of seconds, it shouldn’t have meant anything, but I wasn’t really myself afterwards. That’s why I came back late, too. The other day, I just wanted you to leave me alone. I said what I thought would make you the most angry. It wasn’t about them. And I don’t know why I wanted you to be angry. I just didn’t have enough… space in my head, and I wanted you to go away.”
She spoke in the calm, rehearsed tone of voice she used in class, and he felt pretty sure she had practised this conversation in her head.
Draco and Pansy had taken up each end of the sofa nearest to the fireplace and sat with their backs to the armrests and their legs tangled together in the middle. Draco was trying to read, Pansy was half-heartedly following Daphne and Matthew’s chess game. Blaise was there too, writing letters with a calm look of concentration on his face. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had been in the same room as all of them with this little tension between them. Blaise had been a pest in the beginning of the year with all of his snarky comments to try to get a rise out of Draco, knowing how high strung he was with the way the other students looked at him. But Draco had made it pretty easy for him too. He had probably had far overestimated how much talk there was about him in the school. Most people probably hadn’t cared too much. As soon as Draco had occupied himself with other things, all the rest of it had quieted down a lot too. He remembered how desperate he had been to claw his way back to the top of the pureblood hierarchy. What a stupid idea that had been.
“I almost forgot,” she said, turning back to look at him. “Harry asked me to tell you to meet him at five down by the west wing stairs to the dungeons.”
Nothing happened. Only then did he allow himself to scream. He kicked angrily at his bed and then his empty suitcase under it. He threw his wand on the bedside table and started beating one of his pillows, sinking his fist into it again and again and again, and it did nothing to ease the twisting anger in his stomach or the burning humiliation stretching under his skin.
He couldn’t even remember when he had stopped tolerating Draco or defending him out of some principle, and had actually started to like him. It had happened so slowly he had hardly noticed.
"I said I'd go with you to a normal pub," Draco hissed. "But you could have told me that it was going to be a bloody Hogwarts reunion party!"
He fought back irritation – he couldn’t blame her that she hadn’t gotten anywhere. He should have been working too, pulling his part of it.
They all nodded in agreement and then Pansy and Draco walked away from the others as the groups spread out. He pulled his wand out and they took up position. He had had practice duels with Pansy before, and a few real ones when their fights had gotten out of hand. Draco almost always won; Pansy was smart, but her magic wasn’t very powerful and she struggled with many spells that came easily to him. She smirked at him, glancing at the others like she thought it was all a bit silly.
"Yeah, that's why I came," Harry said. "I've had it since the war, and I just figured, you know, after our talk, that I should probably give it back."
There were parts of himself that he could simply put away when he needed to. He had had to watch his aunt torture Granger back at the manor, and so he had switched off, and he had watched, and he hadn’t cared.
“Look, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “Can we talk about something else? I have to spend the whole evening in detention with the idiot, so I think I have been punished enough.”
Malfoy had already pushed open the door, holding it open awkwardly, and for a second Harry considered just taking that opportunity; rushing out and going home and pretending none of this had happened. He couldn't do that though. He needed to get this done. And then he could go home and never think about it again.
of it. I mean, what’s the point? My father used to talk about the legacy of the Malfoy family and how I needed to carry on the traditions, and I was terrified of letting him down, but I’ve been thinking about it, and now I’m not so sure that it’s really all that important. To spend my whole life making sure that my family
“You mean to tell me you have not imperiused him or slipped him a love potion and that he was actually acting of his own free will this morning?” he said. “Come on, Draco, in what world have you and Potter ever been friends?”
Their table was too close to the Gryffindors for Draco to be able to relax. He had his back to them, but they were loud, their voices carried. He couldn't hear what they were talking about, but he could easily make out Potter's voice, Potter's laugh amongst the others. He had the prickling sensation of being watched, but he couldn't turn to look in case he was right.
Harry didn’t say anything. Malfoy’s apprehension was a physical thing in the silence. It would be so easy to just… but it didn’t seem right to dismiss it all just like that, even if it was coming from Malfoy. He remembered what it had felt like when he carried the locket that had been Voldemort’s horcrux. He remembered what it had done to Ron too, being that close to something evil. And he found that he was already starting to believe what Malfoy was telling him about Azkaban.
“But it isn’t all on you!” he said, louder than he had intended. “It’s great that you think you’re obligated to try to save the world and it’s great to know that sometimes you can’t rely on others to do the things that have to be done, but you also have to trust that you’re not the only one who’s trying. Besides, there’s more than one way to save the world, just because you’re in Gryffindor that doesn’t mean you can only do things that matter when you run in wands blazing with no idea what you’re doing, the way Harry does. If you had been in Ravenclaw you’d probably have been fine with doing practically all the research, basically solving the problem of how to kill a dementor, and then not go with us to Azkaban. It’s not like you don’t know you’re one of the most talented witches to graduate from Hogwarts in years, so aren’t you planning to save the world in other ways too? Politics and science and philosophy, that’s still important even if it looks less impressive.”
“Yes, but remember how we thought maybe it was drawing from a much bigger area than what we normally assume – I drew it somewhere.”
"Yes, exactly," Malfoy said. "Scottish thing, actually. Something we say up North. Where our school was. Is."
when he passed him in the hall or heard his footsteps upstairs. It seems ridiculous now, of course. Who the hell would Malfoy have told? He doesn’t talk to anyone at the Burrow, just keeps to himself, and Harry was doing just fine ignoring him, pretending as if staying in the same house as him and Ginny while trying to focus on finding horcruxes wasn’t already a slow kind of torture. But now they’ve talked, and suddenly he’s impossible to ignore. It’s like they’re sharing a secret again, and now every time Malfoy comes down for meals, it’s like he sucks all the air out of the room, and Harry is feeling that awful pull again, feeling himself gravitating towards him, the way he did back at Hogwarts. He finds himself wishing for the thousandth time that he could go back and do things differently. He should have known even back then that it would come back to haunt him. He probably did know. Maybe that was the point. Maybe he had wanted to be haunted. Or maybe he just hadn’t really believed he would live past 15.
There was a lull in the conversation, another stretch of silence. Luna got up from Ginny's lap to put on another record.
And then, before Draco had had a chance to remember how words worked, Potter had straightened up and pulled his wand out of his pocket. He was still holding on to Draco's arm.
Pansy wasn’t in the common room. He walked over to where Matthew Selwyn and a couple of other seventh years were laughing about something stupid. They stopped when they noticed him.
Nott knew that Draco had bought whiskey and had probably deduced part of the pathetic scene that naturally followed, but he was the sort of person who got more joy from hoarding secrets than spreading gossip, so he kept quiet too.
One of the others began unfolding the paper, hiding the message before he could read the rest, and instead revealing a detailed map of the school. That in itself was impressive – Draco had never seen a map of Hogwarts before, because even though the castle looked like a somewhat tangible building from the outside, its insides didn’t seem to follow any of the rules that usually applied to architecture, such as space, direction or permanence. The map had several extra flaps to accommodate the impossible construction, such as the non-existent floor they were currently on, but still it must have taken a tremendous amount of work to create it. And as if that wasn’t enough, Draco noticed the dots. There were eight of them in the room they were currently in, each labelled with a name. The dot called
Slytherin had Transfiguration with the Gryffindors this year, which was still taught by Professor McGonagall. Apparently they hadn’t been able to find another teacher, or maybe she was just sad to let it go. It had happened before that the headmaster had been teaching a class as well, though Dumbledore had been too involved with his politics on the side to have time for it.
It was two days before Harry got a chance to speak to Draco again. It used to be so easy to get a hold of him, to hang back after class, slip him a note in the corridors or just run into him by chance in the Owlery or the library, but now it felt nearly impossible to even come near him without being noticeable. Maybe it had always been like that, but he hadn’t really noticed the difficulty before, when it was just about Azkaban, and he hadn’t wanted to get a hold of him
“It probably would just have made it all worse,” she said, her voice very small and still managing to sound brave.
He was met with silence from the other end. There was an unnatural buzz in his fingertips. He tried to breathe normally, to keep down the building panic in his body.
She bolted upright, startling both him and Granger. Draco felt an excited twist in his gut even though he tried to suppress it – this was Lovegood after all, her excitement was bound to be as illogical as everything else about her. She scooted to the edge of the sofa so she could lean over the table with them.
“It worked, didn’t it?” she asked. “I think we felt it all the way here. I’ve been so fucking worried- where’s Weasley? And Lovegood?”
Harry's hands curled into fists in his pocket and his jaw tightened. For a second he had actually been relieved when Malfoy caught up with him, but - it was one thing to know in the quiet of his mind that he was being pathetic, thinking of going somewhere else to drink by himself, but that didn't give Malfoy any right to mock him for it. They had been perfectly polite to each other all evening, and sure he had been desperate to get out of the house, but it suddenly seemed like the stupidest decision he had ever made, he didn't want his
Of course, Draco doesn’t know that, he wasn’t there. It’s just a coincidence. A deeply fucked up coincidence that makes Harry want to scream or put his fist through a wall or just get the fuck out of there and never look back.
“Like you’re one to talk, you’re being indecent with Hermione all over the common room and nobody ever complains about that.”
“What do you mean you don’t? You’re the bloody expert on heroics,” said Malfoy, who was starting to look completely unhinged. “You’re the Chosen One, you defeated the Dark Lord and every other dark thing you could find in the world. You’ve almost gotten yourself killed with heroics every year since I met you.”
“Can’t you see how ridiculous it is that you think you have to go because of the colour of your robe?”
“You shouldn’t have had to go there,” she said. “You shouldn’t have had to see your father like that.”
Harry had to hold back a laugh, mostly because Malfoy attempting to parody his own poshness was almost indistinguishable from him simply being posh.
With a dazed expression, she walked to the end of the room, went through the door to her quarters and closed it carefully behind her.
Potter twisted the handle and pulled the door open. From the darkness came a gust of cold, the low sound of a rattling breath and Draco waited while the dementor glided forward towards Potter, who had his wand out but hadn’t raised it. Draco couldn’t see his face, but his shoulders were tense, and for a second he was distracted by the thought of Potter in third year, passing out whenever the dementors came near, and how he had never found out what it was they made him remember. Then he felt an icy twinge in his own mind and for one dreadful second he thought he had forgotten his happy memory, he thought that Potter was already raising his wand, that he had failed again.
By that time, he had started leaving his room again for meals. He would eat with his mother in the dining hall. Sometimes she would talk, and he wouldn’t say anything. Sometimes they just ate in silence. When it had been four days she started asking him when he was planning on going back to school. She was gentle at first, but then she got tired of his indifferent shrugs and started reminding him that he was all this family had left and if he didn’t make an effort he wouldn’t amount to anything, and he had survived the first half year, so he would survive the last one too.
“About half a year, right? I was surprised to hear it, I thought that was just the sort of action packed, heroic career you wanted.”
like this. We find something that’s impossible to do, and then we find out we have to do it, and then we try to plan or prepare and then we go there and find out we missed something important and then all of our plans fall apart and someone looses a limb or gets caught or dies. And I just thought it would be nice if, just for once, we had actually prepared enough.”
, or like a really big radius. And then you wrote down somewhere that Azkaban wasn’t built by anyone, or we don’t know who built it, it was just found a really long time ago. And
Half an hour later, the door swung open and Harry barged in, out of breath and looking completely disoriented.
Draco looked up. Across from him, a Weasley took the seat next to Pansy. Freckles and bright, red hair. Red and gold trimmed robes. It took him a moment to realize that Granger was there too.
"Where did you even take us?" he asked, casting his eyes around, mostly to make sure no one was around to witness the scene.
Ron took a step back down the stairs. He looked from Harry to Hermione, like he was assessing the conspiracy of both of them having known about this and not told him – or possibly like he was waiting for one of them to start laughing. When neither of them did, his frown deepened.
And Draco thought for the first time since this whole thing had started, that there was a chance he would come to like Potter. He liked him right then, and not because he could use him or because his presence promised redemption, but just because he smiled that way.
“Well we can’t all live in a state of heightened moral understanding, and I know I would be a lot happier with being back at school if I didn’t have to see his face in the hallways.”
The discussion didn't end until Hermione left for work, and Ron kept nagging until he had to leave too. And then Grimmauld Place was quiet. Harry cleared away the last of the dishes from breakfast.
He nodded again and she returned to her papers. He turned to leave and as he did, he had to fight back an overwhelming urge to scratch at the mark. When he reached the door, he briefly touched the edge of his sleeve before pushing down the handle and slipping out into the corridor. He wondered what his mother would do to him if-
There was a light touch on his shoulder and he flinched away from it. Irie was looking at him with confusion written all over her face. He blinked, looked past her at every face in the store now turned to him, all of them staring open mouthed, confused, disapproving and suspicious.
He sounded like he disapproved. It was amazing that anyone could be so good and righteous all the time – even when it was Pansy, whom he obviously didn’t care for, Potter still didn’t like the idea of Draco talking bad about his friends behind their backs.
Harry shrugged, looking around the dormitory to Ron’s and Neville’s beds with the curtains drawn around them; Dean’s empty bed that he hadn’t slept in for quite a while now.
, Ron,” said Dean, who had reached up to pull the curtains out on the other two sides. “Don’t worry.”
Then the images of Azkaban were drowned by the light of the silver stag that erupted from Potter’s wand.
He reached behind him for the door handle, turned it, and hurried out and away down the corridor as fast as he could.
He closed his eyes for a moment when he had finished reading. He was so tired, but his body felt restless. His mind was overused but it wouldn’t stop whirring. He recognized the feeling from past nights of insomnia and knew he wouldn’t be getting any sleep.
“You might have noticed that you’re the only one so far who has made any demands as to what our truce is going to entail,” he said.
Part of him is itching to go. He can feel Ron and Hermione getting restless too. The longer they wait the more time they have to dwell on all the things they don’t know. They aren’t ready, but they never will be. Harry wears the fake horcrux under his shirt, and it’s a constant reminder that they are already one step behind.
“Of course, as a Malfoy I used to be able to buy whatever I wanted anywhere, but that isn’t the case anymore...”
“There’s no reason that should reflect back on us. You can’t hold kids accountable for what their parents did,” said Pansy, managing to make it sound like they were still having a conversation.
He sounded scared of what he was saying. It didn’t sound like lies, but neither had everything else he had told Harry over the last few months, and that had all turned out to be fake, hadn’t it? Besides, he knew what Malfoy was telling him couldn’t be true.
“Right,” she said, looking down at her notes. “So now that that’s settled, there is quite a lot that we don’t know yet and a lot of questions we need to answer before we’ll know what the best approach to the situation is.”
Draco looked at her. Her skin was sallow in the ghostly light. The need to hurry was gone. Here, time stood still.
The voice of the Dark Lord was a gentle whisper of recognition. His face had twisted into a smile, and Draco knew that this could not be real, that it wasn’t real, but his thoughts were jammed, he couldn’t
He felt a thrill as he turned his eyes to one of the crowded corridors at the other end of the castle and saw that the dots there were moving around, each of them labelled with a student’s name.
, and Draco had no idea how to handle that if he couldn't run his mouth on autopilot. And around Potter, that apparently still meant spewing out insults at every turn. There wasn't any snarky comeback from Potter, though, and when Draco glanced over at him, he had his eyes fixed straight ahead and an oddly serious expression on his face.
"I don't," he said. "It's Blaise's birthday, I couldn't very well turn down the invitation, but believe me when I say I would prefer to be somewhere else."
Irie was looking at Malfoy like she was watching someone have an aneurism. Malfoy's face was twitching a bit. He looked like he was contemplating the legal consequences of singlehandedly bringing down the Statute of Secrecy.
There was something peculiar in Potter’s expression, as if he was searching for something in Draco’s face and the search had distracted him from slipping into his usual mask of obvious revulsion. Draco felt a well-known irritation stirring.
Malfoy pushed the window open and fished a crumpled cigarette packet out of his pocket. He put a cigarette between his lips and then, to Harry's surprise, pulled out a lighter. He cupped his free hand around the flame and inhaled deeply. On the exhale he twisted his body halfway out the window, though most of the smoke drifted into the room anyway. He put the lighter down, and Harry followed it with his eyes. It was made of blue plastic. It was the second time within 10 minutes that Harry had seen Malfoy use muggle technology for things any wizard would do by magic. And both times had been casual, not like he was doing it because Harry was there, to prove a point or something, but without thinking about it, like it was a habit. And well, maybe if it had been some other wizard, Harry wouldn't have found it odd. Maybe if it had been someone muggleborn or someone like him who had lived in the muggle world for a long time, who had had reason to develop habits like that. But this was
Potter was leaning over his potions textbook, frowning at the instructions. He didn’t even notice when Draco passed his station.
“I’m just saying, if you want to complain about what we’re spending our time on, then how about you just tell us instead of pretending this is about school.”
“No, I just – I wouldn’t exactly say we’re ready to go since we still haven’t figured out what to do about… about the dementors.”
“I was just longing to hear your sweet voice. I haven’t heard from you in nearly a week. How are you?”
It turned out there was a lot of paperwork involved in claiming a body. It took forever for them to even get their security clearance for entering the ministry, and then there had been some misunderstanding with the ceremony official and they had to find a replacement who would know how to deal with the wards in the Malfoy family mausoleum. When they finally returned to the manor, they received notice that the transportation of the coffin with Lucius’ body had been delayed, and Draco almost started laughing at the absurdity of it all – him and his mother in their traditional mourning dress, as if death was something that could be dealt with with ceremonious dignity, and then it turned out the whole thing was just a mess of practicalities and bureaucracy and inefficient delivery services.
“Yes, well it can’t be removed. I’ve had quite a few visits to st. Mungo’s, and I got them to try everything short of cutting off my arm, but there was nothing they could do. I would have gone abroad to find some better healers when the English ones turned out to be incompetent, but my family hasn’t been allowed to leave the country.”
“That won’t work,” he said. “He won’t be able to get it through the Wizengamot, you know that, professor.”
Harry slides his hand down Draco’s arm and takes a hold of his wrist. And then on an impulse, he lets his fingers migrate under Draco’s shirt cuff. His fingertips brush over uneven skin, raised scar tissue, and Harry’s stomach drops. He tightens his grip involuntarily, fingers digging into the mark on Malfoy’s arm.
“My shoulder’s still getting wet,” he said and watched the strange trajectory of the raindrops that fell straight towards them and then suddenly curved as if they had hit an invisible shell.
“You all know he came back late after the holidays,” he continued. “Because he got out of reach of the patronus while he was there. I talked to him right when he came back, and he was acting… strange, which was why we got in a fight.”
He still wasn't looking at Draco's face when he said it. His thumb was stroking the fabric of Draco's sleeve. Draco just stared at him. At this drunk boy, who was definitely Harry Potter, who looked like he would pass out the second he was horizontal, who still for some reason had decided to stay standing, who had just kissed him, again, and was still touching him, as if that was allowed.
Potter doesn’t leave. He stays there on the landing, one hand resting on the bannister. It’s dark, Draco can only just make out his face.
“I couldn’t think of what to get you,” she says, closing the door to her room behind them. “I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn’t be able to take it with you. So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.”
“Then what?”Pansy snapped. “What do you think would have happened, Weasley? Do you think Snape would have resigned and Voldemort would have pulled his Death Eaters out of the school because one more house was uncooperative? So what if we were cowards, there were kids in Slytherin too, but as far as I know you never let a single person in green into your little hideout.”
“Hey,” he said. “I’ve been waiting, I was starting to worry I might have missed you. I wanted to see you off.”
“You’ll be fine. You’ve done nothing but fight him for the last seven years, and you still managed to get him into bed with you.”
It takes Harry a second to realize that she isn’t referring to his mother’s protection, or the trace being lifted, all the things that have made Harry’s coming of age the final barrier keeping them from beginning the search for the horcruxes.
Move on. That was what he wanted to say. That was what he was trying to do. And he supposed it was nice that Malfoy wanted to apologize, it was just that Harry had no desire to be there for it. It wasn’t like it was Harry’s job to absolve him of anything. And if Malfoy wanted to apologize, Harry was pretty sure that
“Fine!” he said. “But I’ve got no idea if we’re together, alright? It’s not like it’s been bloody simple, but yeah, I like him. I like him a lot, and I’m sorry about that, sorry I didn’t tell you, I was going to, I just really didn’t want to have this fucking fight with you right now.”
Draco doesn’t expect it to ever happen again, but he knows he’ll probably be wanking to the memory for the next ten years of his life. He casts a silencing charm on his bed that night and comes way too fast.
“I haven’t forgotten,” Harry said. “And I’m not saying I’m going to be friends with him, I just think that maybe there’re some things we don’t know about. You didn’t see him at his trial-“
It didn’t sound like nothing, and suddenly the silence between them was tense rather than triumphant. He knew it seconds before it happened what it was Potter was about to say, because apparently he hadn’t gotten away with anything. Potter hadn’t let it go, he had just saved it for later. For now, apparently.
“You know, you should probably start calling me Harry,” Harry blurted out before he could stop himself.
But then he had to go and talk to him, like an absolute idiot. He could have just stayed in his bed and ignored him; he knew it was Malfoy out on the stairs, he had heard him coming down from the attic every night since he arrived at the Burrow, but no, he just had to get out of bed and talk to him, just had to bring up Dumbledore and all the shit before that, and now Malfoy’s presence is impossible to ignore. He can’t stop staring at him. He just wanted to assure himself that Malfoy wouldn’t tell anyone, so he could stop worrying about it, because it had been there, that small, nagging voice in the back of his head whispering
Harry turned around to look at the Slytherins. Once or twice, he had spotted a person in green sitting down at with the Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs, but there wasn’t a single person from another house sitting at the Slytherin table.
Hermione and Luna were waiting for them by the side of the road. They looked tense but determined and just seeing them took the edge off Harry’s own nerves.
Draco winced. He remembered those coins from back when he and Pansy had been in Umbridge’s Inquisitorial Squad.
Pansy stood in the doorway. The door was open to the corridor, her hand still on the handle, lost in the middle of movement and she was looking at the two of them with an expression like she had just eaten one of the more unpleasant types of every-flavour-beans.
He threw his transfiguration into his bag and they headed down the stairs and towards the Great Hall for breakfast.
And then they had Potions with the Gryffindors on the Thursday before a Hogsmeade weekend. Professor Slughorn was going over the instructions when Draco noticed Potter staring at him again. He had caught him at it a couple of times since they had run into each other in the owlery, and this time, Draco gave in. When Slughorn told them to get started, Draco waited and went to pick up his ingredients at the same time as Potter. He told himself he wasn’t accepting Potter’s help, that he was simply too Slytherin to reject an opportunity like this just to spare his pride. But there was also some part of him that found it disproportionally appealing to perceive this as an opportunity to get Potter to finally take back his rejection of Draco’s ancient offer of friendship, even to the extent that he didn’t care about admitting to himself that he hadn’t let it go entirely.
He’s instructed not to leave the house, so he doesn’t. He’s invited to eat with them, but he doesn’t. Not just because of Potter, he likes to think he could have managed it if it was just Potter. But there’s a reason Draco wasn’t in Gryffindor. In fact, in this house of people fighting back, knowing what it might cost them, all of them willing to sacrifice themselves for a greater good, doing what is right rather than what is easy, he settles into what might be the first true narrative he has ever spun around himself: that he really is a coward. That he has never done anything but what was easy, the things that were made easy for him, walking the road that other people have paved, and being praised for walking it. So he doesn’t eat with them, because he is spineless and there is no way he could stay that long in a room where less than half the people in it are able to look at him. He deserves it, of course, but he would be punishing them as much as himself if he stayed.
As the day went on Draco grew more anxious about his meeting with the headmistress. He ended up leaving the Great Hall halfway through dinner, and even though he went by his dormitory and tried to get a bit of homework done, he was still by her office almost fifteen minutes too early. He paced back and forth in the hallway for a while, then stepped up to the gargoyle that guarded the entrance. She hadn’t given him a password, but he assumed it would let him in when he had been invited.
And he hesitates, because he doesn’t know how he actually expected this to go. Maybe he came up here because he is spilling over with restless, angry energy and part of him wanted a fight with Malfoy, but he also wanted… Malfoy has grown smaller since arriving at the burrow. He has become even paler than usual. There are dark circles under his eyes and there is an unfamiliar scruffiness to his appearance – his hair is getting too long, his clothes are crumpled. He moves through the house like he is trying to blend into the wallpaper. Even in 6
"Hermione would probably say it's the decent thing to do, but honestly mate, I don't think it matters."
Draco is sitting on one of the desks, a book in his lap - how early did he get there? He doesn’t notice it when Harry comes in, and for a moment Harry watches him and finds that he looks innocent like that. He looks normal, just a 15-year-old boy reading quietly to himself in an empty classroom. He doesn’t actually resemble the corrupt, perverted creature Harry thinks of both of them as when they meet like this. Then Draco raises his head as if he knew Harry was there all along, as if he wanted to let him watch and think himself unnoticed. He doesn’t smile, but he puts the book away.
Potter looked disoriented and Draco felt like he was in free fall, not even sure if he wanted Potter to go along with his ridiculous excuse or not. Then Potter halfway returned the grin, though it was more of a grimace.
“There was that poem in there about “the nature of the spell”,” said Granger, pointing to the book. “I thought that might help, but it can take years of work to alter a spell, especially one as old as the patronus charm...”
"Keep a lookout for muggles, will you?" He pulled a pamphlet out of his pocket and turned so he had his back to the street before getting out his wand.
Each word was warm against Draco’s neck. Draco had had the same thought. He had had it over and over this year and the years before, had dreamt up quite a few scenarios of it, but they all depended on him being a smarter, better and kinder person than he had been.
“But Ginny is right that we shouldn’t trust them, especially her. She tried to make us hand Harry over to Voldemort!”
Harry nodded. Quiet settled between them. Harry glanced around the room, searching for something else to talk about, but once again every topic felt loaded.
Draco wished he had thought to apologize for putting him in that position. He hadn’t even considered the consequences for Potter if he tried to build a bridge between his friends and Draco. He remembered that Potter had not spent Christmas with his muggle family since he was eleven, how appalled he had looked at the idea of reducing friendships to alliances, and how many of Potter’s people were dead. He wanted to apologize and then he wanted to leave because, he had asked for Potter’s help, he had not asked him to risk his friendships.
The darkness returned. He lay back down and closed his eyes. Restlessness clawed at his chest. He concentrated on his breathing, almost drifted off to sleep, but then jerked awake when he felt the dream starting over. He wouldn’t get any more sleep that night. Slowly he drew back the hangings around his bed, letting in the sound of rain pattering against the windows. He pulled the Marauder’s Map out of his trunk and crept back into bed.
Whatever angry thing he was about to say dies in his mouth. He becomes suddenly aware of how quiet the attic is around them.
He followed her up the stairs and into the Entrance Hall in awkward silence. The hall was only dimly lit this time of day and it was a second before either of them noticed the figure sitting on the stairs waiting for them.
“So it probably won’t help the cooperation if we tell him not to bring Parkinson because we don’t like her.”
“No of course not. I mean, in families like mine, the heir is expected to marry so that he or she can carry on the legacy, but otherwise people couldn’t care less.”
as that, but he had thought it would be more than this. And now here they were, and it didn’t feel wrong exactly, it just felt flat. They were just three teenagers in some odd room in the no-man’s hours between classes and dinner. Three teenagers with a couple of books from the school library and an overestimation of their own abilities that probably correlated better with their amount of trauma than their actual achievements. It felt more like they were finishing up on homework than edging closer to the fall-down of some great source of evil.
“Please Potter,” he drawls. “I know this was never anything other than some sort of masochistic… I don’t know, ‘fuck you’ to all the things people expected you to be.”
The door to the guards’ room was closed, but a sliver of light shone out from under it. Draco held his breath when he passed. Harry had stopped, waiting for Draco to show the way, so he went past him and retraced the route the auror had taken all those months ago, forcing himself to believe that he was remembering it correctly. They reached the iron door and he stopped and put a hand against it. He looked back over his shoulder.
The Ministry had only sent one employee to deal with the transgression, and it didn't take long to get rid of him.
They had all expected it to be big news. They had expected these tense days of pretending they knew as little about the events as everyone else. Draco had expected the sideways glances from everyone who looked at him and thought
“I don’t want a fuss,” he says quickly. “Really, Mrs Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine… it’s the day before the wedding… please, don’t go to loads of trouble.”
Ron and Hermione notice it too, Ron asking if something’s up with him and Malfoy, Hermione saying he should “just ignore him”, as if it were that easy.
He listened to the sound of her footsteps as they receded up the stairs to the girl’s dormitories. Then he stuck his hand into his pocket and pulled out the note. It was a long walk from Gryffindor tower to the Astronomy tower, and he couldn’t even get his invisibility cloak from his dormitory without risking that one of the other’s would ask him where he was going. He looked at the two staircases, the one leading to the girl’s dormitories, where Ginny and Hermione had just vanished, and the other that led to the boy’s dormitories where Neville, Dean, Ron and Seamus were probably asleep by now.
“They won’t respect you just because you throw curses at them,” said Pansy. “You’re just confirming their prejudices.”
His phone was in the small kitchen area of the flat. He hadn't switched on the light, he stood in the dull, streetlit half-darkness feeling like an idiot for talking aloud in an empty room. He still wasn't used to muggle technology.
Harry waited by the door while Malfoy picked up the bag he had left on the couch and started emptying it of books, that he placed in stacks next to Hermione’s on the table.
He tore his eyes away from the dementors right ahead of him to see where she was pointing. They had walked along the rail of the staircase, close enough that there were no dementors immediately to their right. Instead there was the drop to the floor below, the air was filled with thick, grey mist that vanished into obscurity and at first Harry thought that it was simply too deep for them to see the bottom. Then he realized that what he saw beyond the fog
Narrow metal stairs were bolted unto the side of the building and rose all the way to the top, where the only entrance to the tower was. It was a long, slow climb to the top, where they were led through a metal door, down a hallway to a small office, where four other aurors were seated around a table in the soft, silvery glow of a crow patronus that was perched on the back of one of the chairs. They were playing cards and only looked up from their game when Belby knocked on the doorframe.
“You don’t have to keep secrets from me. No one outside this office will ever know unless you want them to, and if you do not want me to help then I will not try. But if something happened while you went home, or if there is some other reason that you are not well – because you’re not, Mr Malfoy – then I think you should tell me what it is.”
The mark was itching under his sleeve; it had been for the past half hour. It was driving him crazy; he was considering going to the bathroom just so he could scratch it. But that would mean going past Potter's table again.
“I don’t want to be policing who you spend your time with,” she continued. “I just want you to know that your actions have consequences.”
Draco had almost drifted off when Potter spoke again. His mind was soft darkness and the promise of dreamless sleep, so he didn’t open his eyes this time. But he wasn’t all the way asleep either, so he would still remember the words in the morning:
He didn’t sound very calm either. If this had been about anyone else, he would have gone to talk to Ron or Hermione immediately. Hermione was much better at this sort thing than Harry was, and though Ron was usually just as clueless as himself, at least they could be confused together. But he couldn’t tell them about this, and knowing that only made him more irritated.
One of the papers was open to an article about the living conditions in Azkaban. There was a picture too, a dark tower in the middle of a stormy sea, and shadowy cloaked figures floating in the air around it. Harry reached out and closed it, and there beneath it was Ginny, staring up at him from a glossy magazine cover.
“Maybe we should mix it up a bit? I’m already acquainted with Draco’s style and I suppose you might feel the same way about each other?”
“It was for some stupid noble reason, wasn’t it?” Draco asks, a trace of a grin on his lips, and Harry nearly flinches at the words, a perfect echo of what Ginny said at Dumbledore’s funeral.
was delivered, knuts paid and owls sent off again. He thought it took quite a lot longer than necessary before an owl landed by his own plate. He yanked the paper away from it when it did and the bird ruffled its feathers indignantly. He paid it its knut and then unfolded the newspaper impatiently, already bracing himself for the headline – “
Harry looked back over his shoulder – Ron and Hermione were standing a few feet away, looking curiously at him.
She was right, of course. It wasn’t as simple as just killing off the dementors and they all knew that. But Granger looked very uncomfortable saying it, not like she hadn’t liked pointing it out but like she wasn’t happy with where the observation was leading her.
Harry and Ron exchanged glances, but before either of them could say anything, Hermione spoke up again:
It was such a small inflection in his tone. He probably would have sounded polite to anyone else, but Harry could hear the laugh, the condescending smile that was just about to break through.
“Okay, I’m done,” Malfoy said. “You’ve been looking like you wanted to leave since the second you stepped in here, so I’m not going to keep you any longer."
“I don’t think you need to worry about that,” he said, which was when Harry noticed the faint blush creeping up Malfoy’s neck.
It was odd that neither Ron or Hermione seemed to have noticed his weird behaviour, but then Hermione had seemed a bit off as well, and he knew Ron was worried about her.
She grabbed at Harry who hauled her back on her feet as Draco disentangled himself from her. She glared at him.
“Oh, come on, Draco! Look, I’m not criticizing you, it was a very Slytherin thing to do, seeing what people need and using it to make them do what you want. You saw that Potter needed someone to tell him what to do so he could feel useful, and then you gave him a heroic quest to destroy the prison that just happens to be where your father is. I just think it’s silly that you won’t admit that’s what you’re doing.”
“Don’t say that, Ms Weasley. You’ll still be my students, even when you’re all forty and I’m teaching your kids,” said McGonagall, though her words were slightly undercut when she reached out and pulled Ginny into a hug.
"Oh. Wow, okay then." He grimaced. "That's more than I ever wanted to know about your relationship."
It was easy to be with him now, he supposed. They had found a way of talking to each other so that they could joke and be friendly while steering clear of all the mess that was still there. But whenever he left after talking to him, he was always confused, always frustrated, like the whole time there was something he had been missing. Like he had thought when they were together that one thing was going on, that they were practicing the patronus charm for example, and then when he left he had the sense that it wasn’t about that at all. Something else had been going on, and he should have noticed it. It wasn’t that he suspected Malfoy of anything. He thought maybe it had more to do with himself. It was just a feeling.
And even though there ought to be thousands of possible answers to that question, Harry hesitated. The problem was that by meeting here and by their previous agreements, most of the reasons for their enmity had been suspended. His first answer would have been “because we hate each other,” but they were only having this conversation in the first place because the reasonability of that hatred had been called into question. He could have listed some of the terrible things Malfoy had done over the years, but in many of those instances they had been equally awful to each other, and even when they hadn’t, a war had happened since then. Harry wasn’t sure he had actually meant to suggest a truce when he said that things had changed, but the war did seem to have created a chasm between the “before” and “after”, and he wasn’t sure where those two worlds overlapped and where they didn’t.
"Okay. So this weird thing happened at work a little while back. Draco was handing this girl her coffee and she starts screaming at him, right? Just completely out of nowhere. Calling him a murderer and all sorts of crazy shit. And, okay, this might sound a bit mad, but it seemed like it was because of his tattoo?"
Harry watched as the old man filled two more glasses at the counter and then headed over to his and Malfoy’s corner with them.
It was a narrow corridor and she had to squeeze past the others. It would be a terrible place to duel. He flattened himself against the wall to give her room to work with the lock. She crouched down in front of the door and reached into her pocket. He could hear her breathing.
Ginny and Pansy didn’t sit with them, but despite Draco’s claims of exhaustion, it wasn’t a particularly peaceful ride from Hogwarts to London. It was only in the evening, when the sky had darkened and they were nearing King’s Cross Station that quiet finally settled in their compartment. They had finished all their candy long ago and Harry sat slumped back in his seat next to Draco, full and happy, the gentle rocking motions of the train making him sleepy. Across from him, Hermione had pulled out a book and Ron was absentmindedly reading through the facts on the chocolate frog cards.
But the pub itself turned out to be easy enough to find. He spotted it as soon as he came up the stairs to the underground, right where Malfoy had said it would be, though at first Harry was certain that he must have misunderstood something. It was the right name over the door, and Malfoy had said the place was muggle, but Harry still hadn’t expected it to look this… normal. There were two windows facing the street, yellowish light seeping out from inside, and Harry could see a large television mounted behind the bar showing a rugby match. Two older men stood outside the door, smoking cigarettes. Harry walked past them, shrugging off his coat as he went inside.
“So if we assume that’s right then it should just be a matter of keeping them in one place and preventing them from feeding on anything within their reach, and then they would just- because see, here,” she flipped to a new page in the book, one of the chapters in verse. “She says here that they become
It wasn’t all dark and dangerous magic, some of the books were just incredibly rare or incredibly old and most of them incredibly valuable, so it made sense to keep them off the shelves that were accessible to 11-year-olds. It could take forever to find what you were looking for in there, but Draco had become well-acquainted with the section during his sixth year. It felt like he had lived there some weeks, scouring the shelves for some dark or forgotten magic that might have enabled him to assassinate the headmaster. He hadn’t had much success – not that there was a shortage of the dark or the obscure, but most of it had been far out of reach of his magical abilities. It had been quite unsettling too.
He felt the exact moment he lost control of it. He had been sustaining it, feeling no strain even though it had gotten further and further away, and then out of nowhere he had been cut off. He wondered if it had made it to the Gryffindor dormitories or if it had just flickered out in some hallway.
So they would be back soon. That should have made him feel better. It didn't. It would be nice to have Malfoy back, to have just one person in the room he actually knew. But he didn't like Mark. He was nice enough, he just seemed a bit… clingy. He had just met Malfoy, so why was he hanging all over him? Shouldn't he talk to his friends too, instead of leaving that to Harry?
They sat in silence for a while. She read and he looked out the window. He usually cared quite a lot about her opinion, but for some reason her aversion to his alliance with Potter didn’t bother him. It had been his plan from the beginning to make friends with Potter only as a way of repairing his image, and that was still all there was to it. And even if it did feel a bit like a private redemption, that was just a convenient side effect. Pansy looked up again.
“Get your story straight, Parkinson. Maybe you could ask Malfoy to help you with the consistency, I’ve heard his story is very neat, good enough to keep him out of Azkaban, even with that pretty tattoo on his arm.”
“I just thought I should tell you that this doesn’t change anything,” she said as soon as he stepped out.
He figured that as soon as he got used to it, he would be happy to be back. He liked sharing a dorm with Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean again. It was almost like before the war, except they had all very quickly gotten into the habit of casting silencing charms on their beds at night, so they didn’t wake each other up when they had nightmares.
Hermione was sitting in a corner of the common room with a couple of the other Gryffindors. Seamus looked up when Ron and Harry came over.
Potter looks away. Draco waits, but Potter doesn’t say anything. Draco hesitates, then turns away. His heart is still hammering. He can’t feel his knees. He takes another step up the stairs to return to his attic room. He has come to hate it these last few days, but suddenly he wants nothing more than to curl up in his squeaky bed and never talk to another person again.
He turned surprised to her, looking for the smirk around her lips, the thing she was actually saying beneath what she had said, but he couldn’t find it.
He looked up and saw a third broomstick zooming towards them from the castle. A flood of relief washed over him. A few seconds later, Draco had joined them.
Though his days had been centred around preparing for going to Azkaban, he had not recently been paying a lot of attention to his memories of the prison itself. He had been preoccupied with the planning, with learning the patronus, so the painful parts, the ones that terrified him so much it seemed ridiculous that he was even attempting this, they had taken second place in his thoughts. Though this had made the impossibility of their mission seem lesser, it had also made it less urgent to him.
Harry almost breathed a sigh of relief at the insult - at least that meant they were done with the apologies.
“Now you should probably get going,” McGonagall said. “I think Mr Weasley and Ms Granger are waiting for you.”
“And then, in case we do end up having to go there ourselves, Harry should probably start teaching Malfoy and Parkinson how to cast the patronus charm.”
Malfoy's voice was acidic. Familiarly so. Harry watched the way Malfoy's bony shoulders rose, the way he kept fiddling with the tea rather than turn around.
And Draco didn't get to ask what that was supposed to mean, because the key finally slotted into place and Potter pushed the door open. He stumbled inside and after a moment of hesitation, Draco followed. Potter was steadying himself with a hand against the wall. He looked like there was some risk of him throwing up again.
“Probably… most of the classes are in English, but I might have to anyway. Some of them are at a muggle school, they have this whole system of enrolling wizards for certain parts of the muggle curriculum without the muggles noticing.”
Umbridge’s regime becomes imposing, unsettling. Hagrid might get fired. Hermione suggests they start their own defence against the dark arts class, she wants Harry to teach them, and all he can think is that he isn’t a hero.
It felt very self-indulgent to cast a patronus charm when there was nothing around for it to protect him from. But the light and warmth of it was so comforting and it made the secret room seem much less gloomy. He wasn’t sure what time it was, but probably still late at night. The glass in the windows was mirror-black and showed nothing of the world outside, only reflected the soft light of his patronus back at him. He watched it where it lay coiled on the sofa next to him. Despite its silvery glow it seemed almost like a real animal. And while he wondered about that, he remembered something, though he wasn’t sure from where: That the Order of the Phoenix had used patronuses to send private messages. A lot of information about the people who fought against Voldemort and the way they had operated had become public when the war ended. He might have read about their messages in the newspaper, or maybe it was just another one of the many stories that circulated in Slytherin.
Then he caught sight of Pansy pushing her way towards him. He straightened up and waved to her, trying to look composed, like he hadn’t almost bolted at the sound of her voice. If she had noticed his flinch, she didn’t show it. She was grinning at him.
“As if that matters,” he says, and Harry hates the bitter knowing in his voice, hates the resigned way he talks, like he has this all figured out while Harry’s head is screaming from trying to keep up.
He reached out and folded up the map, then handed it back to Potter. He took it, and Granger cleared her throat.
Harry slipped between two students in front of him, reaching the table but getting out of earshot of his friends. He picked up two of the shiny, green beetles from a big jar on the table.
He had also gotten to coach some of the first years for their flying lessons one time when he went back, since Madam Hooch had retired after the war. He had liked that. They’d all been so excited. And they were so tiny. He couldn't believe he had been that small the first time he flew a broom.
So that was one thing that was different. There were other things about being back that were almost unbearably normal. They had patched the castle up over the summer, and you hardly ever found physical signs of the battle. The first years still got lost on the upper floors, the prefects still got lost trying to find them and next to him, Ron and Hermione were bickering about homework, their voices slowly rising above the otherwise peaceful breakfast conversation:
Harry let the door fall shut and ran to the door in the back wall. He had the terrible thought that Madam Pomfrey might not be there, but he pushed it back and hammered on the door, the sound seeming loud enough to wake the whole castle. An agonizing second passed and then another. He looked back over his shoulder – Ron had pulled off the invisibility cloak, Hermione was a dark shape on the bed. Harry pounded on the door again, his heart going crazy as it slowly and horribly started to dawn on him that they could loose her.
“I wasn’t being an idiot. It’s not like she was the first one to act like that, right? It’s been like this all year, disrespect and unfair judgement from all the other houses, even Ravenclaw. Someone had to speak up sooner or later, remind them that their insolence is unacceptable.”
He looked into the fireplace where the embers had gotten hold of a crumpled up piece of parchment and little flames were flaring up.
“I always return the books on time and I’ve never damaged any of them,” he said, just to offer some justification. “That’s more than can be said for most other students in this school.”
Harry realized that despite spending the whole day worrying about this, he hadn’t been able to anticipate at all how weird it would be to see him. He was at the same time instantly recognizable and utterly transformed. Harry would have recognized him anywhere, but in this context, he was hit by the same sense of disconnect he had felt when he’d heard his voice on the phone. All these incongruous elements that had somehow been forced into the same space – Malfoy, who was so entangled with Harry’s years at Hogwarts and with the war, suddenly intruding on his post-Hogwarts, post-war life. Malfoy, who was the epitome of aristocratic, pureblood wizard-snobbery actually sitting there, in a seedy little pub in Peckham wearing a knitted grey sweater when Harry had known him for seven years and never once seen wearing anything other than robes. It was disorienting.
He nodded at Harry, once, resolutely, and then he turned heel and stalked out of there as fast as he could without actually breaking into a run.
He took a step closer to the wall to their left – or towards where it should have been. He reached out his arm and didn’t touch anything.
The photos ignited another wave of public outrage and the Ministry began the process of moving the prisoners to another “more humane” but “still secure” location almost immediately.
Draco knew that spell. Or he knew variations of it. There were different wand movements that meant different duration and coverage. The incantation was the same though, and all variations served the same purpose: it was a shield charm against dark curses that would block almost anything short of unforgiveables.
“I don’t know if it does, it’s just that I think that’s what I’m afraid of,” he said. “I don’t want that. Can you imagine if we all came back to that platform some day, content and married with our own kids, and all of my friends were still Slytherins and yours were all Gryffindors? Just the fact that we don’t stop belonging to the houses even when we leave school... I can’t stand that thought. The
“What do you want?” she snapped with a command in her voice, a warning that he ought to stand to attention and state his purpose before coming any closer.
He stood frozen and watched as Weasley ran for his sister, followed seconds later by Longbottom, Lovegood and Harry. The dark shape of her body disappeared from Draco’s view when they crowded around her. He watched as Granger yanked her wand from Pansy’s limp hand and went to join them. Pansy was still breathing heavily, her mouth half open, her face red and splotchy, strands of black hair clung to her cheeks.
She tore her eyes from the man in the cell and they began moving again. Draco checked his watch – they had only lost a couple of minutes.
"It might have," Blaise said, leaning back in his chair and swirling the last of the firewhisky around in his glass. "I mean, we all picked sides during the war and that last year at Hogwarts was pretty rough, but the thing with you and Potter goes back to way before that, I thought maybe going through a war would make you see how childish-"
“I know I wasn’t a hero and I don’t need you to approve of anything I did. I don’t need anyone to do that. I’m just sick of your narcissistic hero-worshipping when the kids in Slytherin are ashamed of their house because of the way your lot tells the story. I think it would be fucking great, especially if Potter is serious about this inter-house cooperation-shit, if you would stop making us all out to be evil, because we’re not. And maybe for the sake of cooperation, or truth or fairness, you could admit that it was sad what happened to us, what they did to us, just as it was sad and wrong what they did to you. It wasn’t all our fault what we did to each other – you can admit that there were people and circumstances that made us do those things, or at least made it much harder not to do them, without having to compromise any of your sacred morality. We shouldn’t be the villains of your story.”
“Don’t, Draco. If you want to roll over that’s fine, but I’m not going to sit here and listen to her telling lies about us.”
Draco kissed him again. He buried his fingers in the dark curls and felt Potter’s hands on his hips and moving up his sides, stroking his back and pulling him closer.
He nodded to them and then left, dragging Alain with him out of the Great Hall. Everyone watched them go, and only when the two of them had disappeared through the doors did they turn back to their friends. Mutterings spread down the tables. Pansy looked mildly horrified, Draco was sure he wasn’t any better. An angry flush was still visible on Weasley’s cheeks. Granger cleared her throat.
They raced up the final staircase and launched into the chaos on the topmost gallery. Spells were flying everywhere; one brushed by Harry’s face so close it singed his ear.
Harry reached out and pulled Draco in, for a short moment clutching him tightly and Draco could hear him breathing right next to his ear. It was just that brief moment of panicked closeness, then he let him go and quickly got to his feet like it hadn’t happened. Draco looked past him when he stood up to where Granger was standing, her face illuminated by Harry’s patronus. She was staring at him, comprehension dawning on her face.
“It’s bloody unfair is what it is,” said Ron, turning to Harry. “Why don’t they have a ward to keep the blokes out of each other’s beds too?”
Potter opened his eyes again, looking up at Draco with his head turned so his cheek was pressed to the backrest and his glasses were pushed askew. The T-shirt had slid down a bit and Draco could see the shape of his collar-bones.
Draco wasn't nearly as pissed as Potter, at least he thought he wasn't, but that had not made a lot of sense.
“Maybe that’s your problem – people usually do come off as unintelligent if they are deliberately trying not to think.”
“What would he have to say to Harry that might be important?” Ron said. “It could be a trap for all we know.”
Draco couldn’t hear if his mother replied, but he followed her inside. As soon as the door had closed behind them, the world was quiet again. They could still hear the sound of the sea, but they were shielded from the wind. His mother dragged strands of hair out of her face, running her fingers through it and probably regretting she hadn’t put it up. There was another auror inside the house, a skinny woman with a pointed face leaning against a desk by the opposite wall. She nodded at them, but didn’t introduce herself. She had her wand out too.
Draco’s wand was already tucked away in his forearm holster, so disarming really wasn’t necessary. Potter looked down at his own hand as if he hadn’t been aware of the wand before.
“Yeah,” he said, straightening up a bit. “Yeah, I’ll be studying herbology in Sweden, actually. In Uppsala. The school has rooms for foreign students, so…”
It was strange, Harry thought, how you never got used to fear. Nothing he had been through in the last couple of years, no matter how horrible, did anything to diminish the overwhelming sense of dread. Possibly it made it even worse, made it easier to imagine what they had ahead of them.
They had gotten the message from the Gryffindors the day before. Draco’s fight with Pansy had gotten in the way of him telling Harry what they had found out about the dementors and he hadn’t talked to him since. So maybe Granger had told them, or maybe they had no reason but simply felt it instinctively, how it was all looming ever closer, the way Draco did. No matter the reason, they had decided that they ought to practice their duelling before heading to Azkaban. They no longer had access to the room of requirement, so they would have to get off the school grounds to stay unnoticed.
Draco nodded curtly at him. Pansy had her lips pressed together in a hard line and was staring past the boy at the other Weasley standing right behind him.
