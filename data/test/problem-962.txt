“Okay so where will we be meeting then? I have a feeling the others might get suspicious if we just walk in to your office at all hours of the day.” Dean sighed, turning to Seamus who shrugged his shoulders. “What about the safe house? You know the one we used when we were investigating those exploding cauldrons?”
“It’s Olive, dear, and yes - I found them missing this morning, what it was, was I went outside to do my usual plant watering.. Yes.” she nodded her head, beginning to pour tea in two the three cups on the tray. “And I said, well I said oh where have you gone?” Harry bit his lip harder to stifle a laugh. Draco ducked his head down, scribbling furiously at the notepad in his hands. “I thought oh well, I knew you were there last night, where could you have gone.”
After the speech had ended, Harry walked off the platform and towards the crowd, he answered several questions of reporters that had been present as best he could before he walked straight towards Hermione, who smiled warmly at him and greeted him immediately. “That was a nice speech Harry.” she placed a hand on his shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze. “I just wish it wasn’t happening.” he admitted, shaking his head. “Mm.” she nodded.
Draco had not uttered a single word, the sound he did hear was the other man hurling into a drain near another house. Immediately, Harry was at his side, he placed a hand on Draco’s back. Once he’d finished, he turned his head to Harry his cheeks pink with embarrassment. “Sorry.” he whispered, leaning his head into Harry’s shoulder. “I’ve sent word to the department, someone’s going to come out and… Collect it.” Seamus grimaced. Harry only nodded.
The sixth time it happened, Draco had been standing waiting for almost an hour out in the courtyard, it was quite chilly so he had his long black coat buttoned almost to his neck, his large green scarf wrapped around his neck. Absolutely convinced that Potter had been messing with him when he’d asked him to Hogsmeade, Draco let out a sigh, his breath clearly visible in the cold air.
Lavender shook her head, walking further into the room. She took the chair Hermione had sat on previously and studied Draco’s form, letting out a sigh. “No, Kingsley said we’re not allowed to interrogate the scumbags - Unspeakables need to do it.” she spat the last part, clenching her hands into fists. “Doesn’t surprise me.” Harry shrugged.
“Oh honey I’m happy to see you too.” Harry teased, sitting down on the end of the sofa. Draco chuckled and grabbed the meat feast box, opening it to reveal a steaming bundle of pizza goodness. “Gods I’m so hungry.” he whined, pulling a bit of pizza out of the box.
I haven’t told mother yet, I thought that was something we could do together. Though I’d rather wait a while, she’s overbearing at the best of times and I can imagine when I do finally tell her she’ll never stop pawing over me like a bloody mother hen. Today she brought me cookies, cookies! Why? I have not a bloody clue.
Harry frowned. Hermione cleared her throat and turned her head towards Draco and Harry, a pained expression on her face. “We have been aware of the Celtic Serpents for about three months. Their official name is Serpents of Death, but they’ve caught wind of your codename and took it upon themselves to change it, they seemed to like what you dubbed them as.”
When she told Harry the details, he’d looked less than interested. She’d speculated Harry cared far more deeply for Draco than anyone knew. Lavender had watched Harry and Draco’s interactions, she was an Auror, of course. Trained to spot things normal people were unaware of, they were so deeply connected. Lavender hoped she’d find love like that one day.  Dean and Seamus had arrived shortly after explaining Henderson and Endelton were in the Minister’s office, being briefed on the Celtic Serpent case. Harry let out a sigh of relief that his team would be part of the operation, the whole team. They couldn’t do it without them.
Draco let out a snort of amusement. “I didn’t let you use it, you took it.” he shot Potter a pointed look, before the corners of his mouth turned up in amusement. Potter looked like a wounded deer in headlights. “You’re welcome.” he finally said, putting the man out of his misery.
Harry took it eagerly, scanning the document in question before nodding his head. “Right, let’s go then,” he said, exiting his office with Seamus close behind him.
He really couldn’t catch a break. Stood there with a Domino’s Pizza, Potter had a weird smile on his face.
At twenty five years of age, you're not supposed to feel old. Nevertheless, Draco did. Unsure of what to do with his life these days, Draco had adopted the rather annoying hobby of 'people watching'. He watches as they animatedly talk to each other, the rapid waving of one's arms sets his teeth on edge, the bright faces of the bustling traffic coming through Diagon Alley in early August. With Hogwarts resuming, he knew there would be a lot more people here than there usually was, but he didn't expect the extent of the crowd.
“Uh, Robards weirdly enough.” Draco laughed and signed the document accepting his holiday leave. Robards was only a part timer now, after his position had been filled by Harry. The Auror seemed grateful Harry hadn’t asked him to become his deputy, they never did decline any of his requests for leave - during the course of their training Robards assisted with many cases, and saved their hides just as many times. Harry believed it was duty other than actual care - the man was grumpy and drove Harry round the bend most of the time.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco spotted his cat. He’d been worrying about the bloody thing for days now, his smile changed to a full grin as Meowth ran into the kitchen and jumped up on the counter. “Hello, did you miss me?” He asked, giving the cat a little stroke behind the ears. Meowth purred.
in a weird way. Draco felt like his existence actually meant something, he had begun to worry what would happen after Harry got bored, or if they figured out what the man was up to.
“I suppose..” Draco said, chewing his lip again. Potter cleared his throat and passed a wooden box over to Draco. “I er, nearly forgot,” Potter said, looking somewhat awkward. “Thanks for err.. Letting me use it.” he said lamely, rubbing the back of his neck.
Draco looked up at him, turning his head to the side a little as though he was trying to figure Potter out, maybe the flicker of something in his eyes, a twitch of an eye, or the turn of a lip. Unfortunately, Potter had always and will always be an absolute enigma to the blond. “PTSD.” he said, shrugging his shoulders.
After they’d finished their desserts, Potter suggested going to the pub for a few drinks, to which Draco politely declined. He was already feeling somewhat tipsy from the two Gin’s he’d had waiting for Louisa and Weasley. The dessert they’d bought was so enormous they couldn't actually finish the entire thing. It amused Draco that Louisa was defeated by a dessert, but it seemed to amuse Potter more in Weasley’s case.
“Potter,” Kingsley said, eyeing him closely. “Are you alright?” Harry nodded slowly, he attempted to get up but found his legs were like jelly, he let out an exasperated sigh and rubbed his face with his palm.
“Extra wards, paranoia you know?” Harry said, shrugging. Draco nodded again. Harry was a little worried at how quiet the other man seemed to be. “So pizza?” he repeated. “Sure.” Draco replied, walking towards the kitchen, he opened the cupboard and pulled out all the snacks he’d bought previously, laying them on the counter.
“I know you told me about the whole magic thing, but do you think this Potter bloke is actually going to return your wand?” She said, scowling at the open glove compartment. It had been an interesting conversation to say the least, Draco had expected Louisa to immediately conclude he was insane, especially since he couldn’t actually
, weren't they? If so, then she’s already guessed about the baby. I distinctly recollect Cissa remarking how those cookies were her particular craving when she was expecting
“I could always get it out,” he winked. Draco swatted his arm and rolled his eyes. “Don’t be such a slag Potter.” though his voice held no malice.
I apologise it's taken so long to update this, here's the newest chapter. I'm hoping to get the next one out soon so we can finish this fic. Thank you so much for baring with me!
He’d brought the novel with him, it sat beside his plate for the world to see, or rather anyone who walked past him though nobody paid much attention to him anyway.
Rolling his eyes, Draco let out a small laugh. "I have enough galleons to sink the Titanic again, but you'll wish I asked for galleons when you try their tea."
"Oh yes of course, it's on my bucket list," Potter spat sarcastically, rolling his eyes. "Well, are you waiting for me?" he asked again, leaning casually against the wall beside him. Draco narrowed his eyes, he could lie and say he just happened to be there, but what would that achieve? He did want to know what the hell Potter was doing down that alleyway.
They become great friends over the course of the eighth year, people often commented on the weird close friendship they’d shared but neither boy really cared what other people said about them. Hermione would often find Harry sitting beside Draco as he brewed potions, or on the couch in the eighth year dorm reading to each other, she’d always suspected there was more going on than simple friendship but never pressed.
“You’re right.” the new Healer announced, nodding her head towards Jenkins. “Hmm,” he nodded, the faraway gaze in his eyes once again. Harry couldn’t help the irritation that flared. “Well, what is it?” Harry grumbled.
“Right well, I suppose we better go take notes about these really important pumpkins.” Harry groaned, trudging up the gravelled path towards a heavy dark oak door. He knocked on the door, turning his head towards Draco who was inspecting a very large pumpkin beside him. “There’s a knocker, you know.” Draco pointed out as he turned his head to the door. Taking in a breath, Draco exhaled slowly. The door opened and there stood a very short elderly lady, her hair was white, a pair of half moon glasses sat on the tip of her nose.
Draco cleared his throat and scratched the side of his face awkwardly. “Oh, well, I-I’ve been helping my mother a lot,” he said, hoping that put an end to it, unfortunately Luna gestured for him to continue.
“Mrs. Dunn’s reported someone’s stolen her aubergines this time, there’s a witch in Hogsmeade that’s reported someone broke into her house - also there’s a crop circle here.” Dean shrugged, handing the reports to Draco who accepted them eagerly.
Draco and Harry had entered their office together, as soon as the door was closed Draco let out a shaky breath and stood with his back up against the door. He was a little unsteady, Harry walked towards his desk and placed a piece of parchment he’d received off Unspeakable Wilson down on his Celtic Serpent pile. His thoughts flickered to Blaise, he’d known him for a long time now, they’d gone out to the pub together, had him over to his and Draco’s flat, he’d been at his wedding, how could he know so little about the man he thought was his friend?
Bethany seemed to take quite a liking to a children’s television program called Pokemon, in the spirit of friendship he’d agreed to let the girls name his pure white kitten, he ended up with the ridiculous name but it had grown on him after a while.
Draco bit his lip, acutely aware of how close he was to telling Harry the truth. His heart began to beat rapidly in his chest, his palms clammy under the fleece blanket. He placed his hand on Harry’s chest. ‘Just a little closer’ he thought.
Upon apparition, Draco, Seamus and Dean were immediately embroiled in an intense wand fight. Seamus clocked a wizard who seemed to be hanging in the back, casting a complicated series of wand movements, he couldn’t hear what the person was mumbling. Feeling a shift under his feet, Dean’s eyes darted to Draco who had just been hit by a Stupefy. “Fuck!” cursed Dean, running over to the blonde. “Draco!” he shouted, kneeling down beside him he cast a Protego around them and checked Draco’s pulse, he’d hit his head pretty hard on a rock jutting out of the bladed grass. Seamus cast a Protego around himself, he looked down to his wristwatch and pressed a button on the front. They’d been issued them two months before, some new invention they’d come up with for Aurors. It had been pretty irritating really, Seamus didn’t like watches or bracelets, he’d argued the toss when they’d been given them but now in the heat of battle he couldn’t help but feel a little grateful, perhaps a little ashamed of the amount of moaning he did about the particular bit of kit. Looking up quickly, his quickly made a note of the headcount, there was one perp in front of him, full black hooded robe. To the person’s left there was another perp in full black, hooded cape. The man to the left looked a little different to the person straight ahead. Seamus made a mental note that this particular wizard was male, which he could tell by the build but he had gold piping around the edge of his robe.
“Who’s there?!” The voice called. “Lumos!” He shouted, waving his wand around. Harry’s heart was hammering so hard he was sure it was going to burst out of his chest soon, he really wasn’t cut out for Auror work, he was about ready for a full blown panic attack.
Draco could almost feel the angst radiating off Harry’s body, he cleared his throat. “Harry, what aren’t you telling me?” he asked, narrowing his eyes. He could tell there was something
Draco frowned, his eyes wandering as Harry walked towards the wardrobe. “What are you doing?” he asked curiously, eyebrow raised. Harry looked at him as though he had two heads. “Getting dressed, why?” he asked, opening the wardrobe door. Although they spent every single night sleeping in the same bed, Draco must’ve missed the memo when Harry moved all of his clothes into his room. The thought caused his cheeks to stain with the pinkest blush.
with his life, which wasn’t completely unlike Draco, however when Weasley spoke of Potter, he brought up Potter’s conquests which he couldn’t help but turn up his nose at.
Potter looked up at him, still beaming. “You’re barmy.” he said, shaking his head. Draco frowned, then offered a small smile. “I’m glad someone noticed, maybe now they’ll put me in the Janus Thickey ward, I hear they have excellent bingo there.” his smile widened.
Harry felt uneasy lying to the other Auror’s about this cases existence, he knew Lavender was itching to do more than what they were doing - although Endelton was the most irritating man he’d ever met, the man got things that needed to be done, done. Henderson was quiet, but her duelling was vital to their operation and Lavender’s sheer strength was always comforting.
Harry gave him a wink and smirked. “Oh will you?” he said, his voice low and husky. Draco couldn’t work out if Potter was taking the piss or flirting, he wasn’t sure which one he preferred. If Potter had moved the duvet he’d be greeted with what that bloody voice caused.
After he finished duplicating the paperwork, he sent a quick memo to Spell Damage to assist and he gathered everything up and took a deep breath - flexing his hands, he opened the office door and frowned, on the other side stood a very nervous looking Lavender Brown. “Brown, what’s up?”
Pictures adorned the entirety of Harry and Draco’s feature wall, really. Most of them taken during eighth year as well as Dean and Seamus’ annual eighth year reunion, which was really just an excuse for an all out piss up. The two of them had gotten together during eighth year which was really no surprise to anyone and they seemed pretty happy. Auror partners and life partners. Draco turned his head towards Harry and wondered if one day that would be the two of them, silently cursing himself over his unending crush and unrequited love.
Harry nodded and wrapped his hand around Draco’s, he moved a strand of hair out of the other man’s face and sighed. Hermione watched him, pursing her lips.
Harry turned his attention to the book, reading the title and stood up quickly, running a hand through his hair. “Never mind, I’ll see you later Malfoy!” he said a little too loudly, before jogging away from the blond.
Immediately, eyes rested upon Harry. Some were that of disdain, others wary. He let out a huff and linked his arm with Draco’s. Looking down at their linked arms, Draco bit his lip and walked up to the Head Goblin. “I have an appointment.” he declared smoothly, the Head Goblin looked him over and nodded his head, gesturing off to the right.
Harry closed the door behind Draco and immediately passed him the parchment. It was a standard report, however it was filled out by Auror Lockwood. Yesterday. “Hm.” Draco hummed, he made his way over to his desk and sat down placing the parchment in front of him. Fishing through the files in the filing cabinet to his left, Draco finally found the piece of parchment he was looking for and set it down beside the new one.
Both Draco and Harry followed her inside, Harry sat down first - Draco stood to the side of him pulling out a small notepad from his robe pocket. Harry could tell that Draco looked somewhat uncomfortable. He was fiddling with his self-inking quill nervously. It always happens whenever someone commented on his surname. “You alright?” Harry whispered, looking up at Draco with a smile. He nodded in response and shrugged his shoulders.
Lockwood growled, turning towards the man. “It’s done when I say so.” he spat, glaring daggers. Harry frowned, he had no idea how he could’ve ever missed this. Lockwood was clearly deranged but in the office he seemed so mellow, normal, he had been a decent enough Auror - though Draco often moaned about his ‘shit paperwork skills’ he’d never had a problem with the man before. Harry was sure after all of the dark wizards he’d encountered during the war he’d be able to spot another one, he felt a pang of guilt.
“Where was I?” she asked, picking up another cup she passed it to Draco who took it appreciatively and began to sip, he pursed his lips and placed it back down on the tray. “Thank you, it’s lovely.”
“Oh this is exciting!” Louisa exclaimed, her head following the mess of red hair flying around the pitch. Draco was so busy in his own head he’d not even realised the match had started, he turned his head towards Louisa, a fond smile appearing on his lips. Draco felt a slight pang of guilt for not bringing her sooner, since Bethany was a witch Louisa wasn’t totally excluded from the Wizarding World, it was just that she couldn’t enter it without someone else.
They turned the small tv on to the left of their false fireplace. Draco seemed to enjoy the many animal themed documentaries, so Harry made the effort and bought Sky TV, just so Draco could watch them on the National Geographic. He’d never forget the look of glee on Draco’s face as he came home and found the new ‘weird lighty up box thing’ as he called it sitting to the side of their television.
Harry’s hand rested on his knee once again, without thinking Draco wrapped his fingers around his hand, squeezing gently. The Goblin continued on telling him about the vault, Draco had asked what the contents of the vault were, however the Goblin merely said he needed to have a look for himself. Draco let out a sigh of discomfort. He wanted nothing to do with his father. He only wished to close the damn thing.
“Yeah, good job,” Potter nodded, pulling himself up to lean against the headboard too. Draco looked around the room briefly. “I spy with my little eye, something beginning with D.”
“That’s that mark, hold on.” he mumbled jogging over to the stack of case files he had on his desk, he bit his lower lip in concentration as he looked for a specific file, once he found it he opened it and leafed through, looking for something in particular. “Here it is,” Harry nodded his head, walking back towards Draco he thrust the folder in his face and pointed down at the symbol on the page. “I knew I’d seen that before, you said that came through the memo system?”
“You have my wand.” he finally said, narrowing his eyes. Potter let out a short laugh, nodding his head. “I do, I’ll give it back to you after the match.” Draco was unsure why the dark haired wizard looked so amused by the question, he could feel irritation bubbling under the surface.
You need to be careful, that sounds dangerous. I hate undercover missions. However I am very much looking forward to this grooming session I will admit. My very vivid imagination as you so put it is
Had I known you’d have this sort of reaction I’d not have told you until you returned, I was just so excited. I hope you’re okay to continue the mission - I don’t want you distracted and ending up dismembered or dead, if you die Potter I’ll bring you back just to kill you myself!
“We’ll figure it out.” Draco sighed, rooting through his paperwork. “What you got there?” asked Harry, who’d turned towards Draco and wandered over to peer over his shoulder. “Nothing interesting, holiday requests.” he shrugged, pulling out his quill from the drawer in his desk. For holiday requests, there was a special quill and ink in scarlet red, they’d changed the procedure after Aurors were caught forging holiday documents for extra time off.
The third time it happened, Draco had been sat at the back of the Potions classroom, as though he was trying to meld in with the shadows of the dimly lit dungeon. The seat next to him was unoccupied, which wasn’t unusual. However, his eyebrows raised as a certain dark haired Gryffindor sat down next to him. This was becoming increasingly common, something Draco was exceptionally curious about, however he'd never admit that to anyone - not that he had anyone to actually admit it to.
Draco sat on the edge of the bed and looked around, noting the small TV sitting on a wooden cupboard just off to the right. This room was quite a lot nicer than the one he’d been in last night, but obviously the lack of two beds posed a problem. “Do you think the Premier Inn would mind if I transfigured their bed?” Draco asked, frowning at the bed sheets.
“This is brilliant, Malfoy!” Potter praised, a smile appearing on his rosy lips. Draco couldn’t help but lick his own lips, soon realising what he was doing and quickly ducked his head down. “Oh, okay then,” Draco said quietly, he could feel the heat in his cheeks - he’d been thinking all night about his conversation with Hermione. Why was Potter asking about him? It was slowly driving him around the bend, he was sure.
Draco nodded, he shifted closer and brought his knees up to his chest, resting his head against Harry’s chest. “I’m going to talk to Hermione, she’s probably the best person to talk about this to,” Draco sighed, he ran a hand through his hair. Draco knew what that particular curse was, it turned the victims vital organs to mush, extremely slowly, extremely painfully. When he’d explained it to Healer Jenkins she’d cringed, nodding her head in agreement. There really wasn’t a name for it in particular, but his father had liked to call it Muggle Sludge, they’d primarily used it on Muggles who concluded the deaths were organ failure.
Chapter three as promised! Next chapter will be tomorrow at around 10PM GMT again. Tuesday (may) be a little later on at 11/12pm due to picking my brother up from hospital. If it isn't Tuesday it'll be Wednesday but I'll keep you all posted! ^.^
It was something that frequently came up in his group therapy sessions, they’d consistently ask every week if Draco had met someone, claiming there was ‘someone for everyone’ he scoffed every time. There had been plenty one night stands, or idiots who decided he was interesting then found out that really, he wasn’t. No person.
It always hurt Hermione that she couldn’t discuss anything with Ron. After all, they’d been through so much together. Ron simply didn’t ask anymore, which Hermione wasn’t sure whether she was comfortable with. He spent a lot of time away from her now, over the past week he’d spent almost all of his time in the Wheezes shop - which was nice, but she missed being able to walk down a few corridors and spend her lunch break with him.
“See, I told you, when you find your person…” He winked. Draco really couldn’t piece together Potter, part of him wondered if the man was flirting, then the other part wondered if Potter was just incredibly bored and trying to half assedly wingman his best friend. If that was the case, Draco was not the charity case Potter was looking for.
"I'm going to need a bit more than 'about six foot and black hair', Potter." Chewing on his lower lip, Draco turned a page again, his eyes resting on a particular description. "Actually, I have one here, six foot, black hair, slight hunch." Harry looked thoughtful for a second before nodding. "He does have a slight hunch." He moved over to Draco and peered down at his book. "What is this?"
Another hooded figure turned up, Seamus found himself immediately duelling the new figure, curses began flying back and forth the steady stream of magic illuminating the area. Harry moved up behind Draco and pointed his wand towards the attacker, from this angle he could see the man's face a little better. He had blue eyes, pointy features - he didn’t recognise the man but maybe Draco would.
Harry was absolutely certain the only reason Draco came round to his and Luna's flat was to borrow the computer and play the Sims whilst Luna was at work. Draco sat at the computer as he usually did and thought back to his conversations with Hermione. It had been a month of her telling him to give Harry a chance, but Draco had still yet to ask Harry about the whole ‘Playboy Don Lothario’ thing he’d mentioned when they were locked in together.
First: I love you. I miss you, and I love you. This mission is the hardest one that I think I’ve ever encountered and now, as it begins to draw to a close, all my thoughts are of home.
“I need a fucking holiday,” he whispered to himself, shaking his head. Harry hated Auror work now - ever since Draco was admitted to St. Mungos, he had been mentally checking off all the reasons of which he should retire. He’d even come up with an elaborate idea of a little coffee shop he intended to open, making a note of asking Draco to open it with him.
“Right..” Harry mumbled, looking back towards the television. Suddenly, he didn’t really feel like watching anything so he turned the television off and stood up, straightening himself out. He looked down at his pyjamas and bit his lip. Maybe if he made a little more effort, he thought.
“You’re getting old.” Draco smirked, standing up. He brushed down his Auror’s robes and wandered over to the corkboard, he then began pinning a copy of the report he’d made on the cabin, as well as a picture of the sticky note and turned his head towards Harry. “Seamus came back whilst you were away, spell damage reported nothing out of the ordinary, though they did trace the sticky note to Lockwoods desk.” he sighed.
“What about our flat?” Harry suggested, turning his head to Draco. Draco’s eyes widened, they’d never used their flat for work before, it was a safe place for him. Harry took the hint and shook his head. “Hm. I’ll get back to you on that one.” he mumbled.
A week later, Draco was thoroughly sick of following Potter around Diagon Alley. The man seemed to always go down that damned alleyway. Draco had even staked out the alleyway beforehand, noting any person who went near it, he'd even bought himself a small notebook and scribbled names of people he recognised, or their brief traits. He wrote the dates, times and locations of where he first saw Potter and the time he entered the alleyway, which had always been around 2pm. The first time it had been 1:52, the second 1:55, then the third again 1:52. Today however, Harry had entered the alleyway at 2:01 which threw Draco off a little.
Draco took in a deep breath and nudged Potter, passing over his notebook with all of his careful descriptions of various different passersby and motioning towards the book with his head. “I figured out some information if you’d care to read.”
Ron has been liaising with his brother Charlie. Many of the smuggled eggs, as well as the recently hatched dragons will hopefully be heading in the direction of his sanctuary. It’s just a case of getting them out safely. Charlie is optimistic that a few of the older dragons might be able to be released back into their natural habitats after intensive rehabilitation, but that’ll take a good few years. How anyone can treat these beautiful, magical creatures in the despicable way that the smugglers have is utterly beyond me.
“What did you buy?” asked Harry, turning his head in Draco’s direction with a raised eyebrow. Draco merely shrugged his shoulder and dumped the bag down on the countertop. Tossing the applecore in to the bin, he quickly washed his hands and opened his grocery bag. “I got marshmallows, haribo, jelly beans, dolly mixtures, hmm,” he trailed off, picking up a packet of sweets from the bag. “Pear drops, they sound interesting.” he nodded in approval. Harry sat up and let out a laugh. “Are you serious? You went to Tesco to buy random junk?”
“Thanks.” Draco finally said, turning his head towards Louisa, who had not said a single word. Louisa cleared her throat and looked up at Potter, Draco could tell she wanted to say something this was what she usually did - the woman always needed to think about what she said before she actually said it.
“Malfoy, hey,” Potter greeted, gesturing for him to sit down at their table. Draco glanced quickly at Louisa, who’s eyes were glued to Weasley. Rolling his eyes, he unhooked his arm from Louisa’s and sat down in the booth beside Potter. They both appeared to be still wearing their Quidditch robes, however there was no musky smell of sweat he’d become accustomed to after a rigorous game of Quidditch, so for whatever reason they spelled themselves clean.
Another three drinks later and Draco was telling Potter all about his years without magic, about his job and everything in between, in return Potter told Draco all about his work with the Magpies. That was the one thing Draco couldn’t stand about being tipsy, or drunk. He seemed to pour his innermost secrets out to anyone that wanted to hear, a classic bartender overshare story and Draco had plenty of those.
“Potter,” Draco started, staring at the television from across the room. “What the fuck are you watching?” he asked. Harry shrugged his shoulders and held the remote up in the air. “Some shit, what do you want to watch?”
“I’ll be back as soon as I can.” she said simply, jogging out of the hospital room. “You’ll let us know if you find anything, yes?” the healer asked, turning towards Harry. “Yes, if it helps Draco,” Harry sighed. “What’s your name?” the woman let out a laugh and smiled. “Healer Lana Williamson.” she nodded.
"Do you think I could get a new broom?" a hopeful young blonde girl asked shyly up to her mother, who narrowed her gaze. Draco snorted, he remembered asking his own father for a new broom - he wasn't met with that much disdain, more of a 'If I buy you it, will you fuck off?' kind of look. "Maybe if you're good," came the reply; Draco rolled his eyes. He brought the cup up to his mouth and sipped lightly, his lip curling at the taste. Not only was their shop horrendous, the tea wasn't much better. This didn't put Draco off though.
“So we’re going to follow him again, right?” Potter asked, he seemed to be studying Draco’s face rather intently, which made him feel a little uncomfortable. Clearing his throat, Draco simply shrugged. “If you want, though you don’t seem to have gotten anywhere by doing that have you?”
. I took those bloody awful Potions for no reason, according to the Healers I've been pregnant for quite a while! How on earth did I not notice?
Luna smiled brightly and nodded her head. “That’s a lovely thing for a son to do for his mother, however I don’t hate you Draco.” Draco smiled slightly in response, nodding his head.
Dean began casting a series of curses at the wizard, almost perfectly in sync with his boyfriend's movements. Seamus finally broke through the man’s shield, casting a Stupefy that hit him right in the crotch. Seamus let out a bark of laughter, throwing his head back. “I did it! I finally did it!” he shouted as Dean ran to the man. He cast a quick incarcerous around the man in question and rolled his eyes at the other man. “Seriously, Seamus?” he mumbled, shaking his head. He couldn’t help the smile that crept onto his lips.
spell you use smells a little too much like tulips to hide the truth. Well, I truly don’t mind, love. The idea of you lying there lonely in our bed for the next few weeks is an awful one for me to bear.
“Well, Auror Potter, we better get back to the office and type up this report about the pumpkins.” Harry teased, grinning at Draco, who looked utterly confused, all of a sudden it clicked and he blushed, his eyes widening a little. “Shut up, you idiot.” his features changing to a scowl, shaking his head. He took off a little ahead of Harry and stood at the gate, his arms folded.
“That didn’t go well,” Lavender sighed, running a hand through her hair. They were all frustrated at this point, Lavender’s thoughts kept going back to the distressed look on Harry’s face at the prospect of losing Draco, it pained her deep in her heart.
Harry began to explain the ins and outs of the case, how he’d been to the Department of Mysteries and shared information with them, it earned a frown from Kingsley but nevertheless he continued, he explained Hermione had pinned an important piece of parchment to his cork board, but of course hadn’t told anyone who it was from. He explained about the other crop circles, Lockwood’s memo and report and other relevant information. The look on Kingsley’s face was dark, the man was certainly angry at the prospect of a spy within the Ministry. After Harry stopped talking, he waited.
“Each place had one thing left, the mark, the body, the veratiserum.” Harry stated. “We missed something.” Draco whispered.
“Tell me tomorrow,” Potter whispered, leaning a little closer. Draco’s heart almost stopped, he slid down the bed and cleared his throat, turning on to his side away from Potter. “Okay, goodnight Potter.” he said quickly, closing his eyes and pulling the duvet up to his neck.
know that. It's gilded too, it looks more expensive than our entire home. Mother has made me put it in the room across from ours, she even looked disgusted when she'd realised we haven't decorated that room yet. How dare she!
Harry stood up too, a little closer than intended and he offered Draco a warm smile. “Time for bed I guess.” Potter said, looking towards the bed, then back to Draco. They stood awkwardly for a few moments, before Draco let out a laugh.
Draco, love. I think I have to go. Mils just said that one of the criminal gang have given her information about a possible delivery of a dozen Horntail eggs. They are concealed within a delivery of harmless potion supplies. We have to check it out now and find out if we have truly fooled the smugglers.
“Home then?” Louisa said, still looking up at Draco. Nodding, Draco held out his arm for her and she wrapped hers around his. “Are you seeing him again?” Draco asked, trying to keep the disdain from his voice. Someday, Draco would get over his hatred of Ronald fucking Weasley.
Hermione frowned at this, but nodded again nevertheless. “Interesting.” she said simply. “Do you mind if we keep these copies?”
Draco looked down at the folder and frowned, tracing his finger over the symbol on the page. He’d seen it before but he wasn’t sure where, before he’d seen it on the case files of course. He wracked his brain like he’d done previously and sighed, maybe he’d been dreaming it but he was sure he’d seen this particular seal on his father's desk a long time ago. Of course Lucius was dead, but it didn’t mean anything really.
He was just about to unbutton his trousers when he felt Draco’s hands on his biceps. “If you pull those trousers down, Potter,” Draco started, the look in his eyes something Harry didn’t recognise.
“She’s alright, I only like one song though,” he replied, studying Harry’s face. “I prefer Mariah Carey.” A slight blush tinged Draco’s cheeks as Harry let out a barking laugh. “Mariah Carey? Really?” Harry asked, almost disbelievingly.
Although Dean and Seamus also possessed excellent qualities, when it came to high profile or dangerous cases, he was always happier to do it as a full team. Strength in numbers, Draco would say.
It wasn’t that Draco was jealous, but he worried about Louisa. It had only been two days since she’d met him, but then again Draco was a natural born worrier.
In walked Seamus, his hair sticking to his forehead with sweat. “We think we’ve found Endelton’s location,” he said, panting. It seemed as though Seamus had been running. Harry raised an eyebrow and stood up, brushing his robes off. “First warehouse, we cleared it a while ago and removed the wards, his last known location was about a mile away from it.” Seamus said, passing a piece of parchment towards Harry.
Potter walked in behind him, scanning the room. A smile appeared on his face, he turned his head towards Draco. “This is exactly as I expected it to be however,” He winked. Potter’s eyes travelled to the picture collage and as if hypnotized, he walked towards it.
“Do you want to dance with me then?” asked Harry, the hopeful look on his face made Draco’s heart melt, he stood up from the computer chair, fake Sim Draco forgotten and took Harry’s outstretched hand.
Over the next few months, Harry and Draco met up almost every day. They quickly became close friends, bonding over their mutual taste in music, books and travelling. The day Harry showed Draco the Sims was the day he realised he really shouldn’t have mentioned that game to Draco, ever.
. The word is diving around my brain like a demented snitch that, for the life of me, I can’t manage to catch. I know that we’ve been trying for a couple of months but I never dreamt that it would happen for us as quickly as it has done.
The fifth time it happened, it was about two weeks after the last incident and Draco by now was entirely convinced Potter was a raging homophobe, deciding to ignore and avoid him over a bloody book. It was not as though Draco was trying to jump his bones or something.
“Cold?” Harry asked, placing the boxes down on the coffee table, he opened the lids and pulled the sauces out of the cut out holes. “Yeah, it’s freezing in here,” Draco moaned, shaking his head. “We need to keep the bloody heating on.” he said, picking up a slice of pizza.
She added milk to the three cups, then frowned. “Oh dear, did you want milk? I forgot to ask.” Harry nodded his head and smiled “Yeah, milk is fine, Draco likes milk too.” Olive smiled in return, handing a cup to Harry. “Thanks.”
What if Harry Potter had accepted his offer of friendship at eleven years old? What if the man had been sorted Slytherin instead of Gryffindor? What if he’d helped the man slay the Basilisk instead of getting him into trouble? If he’d been there to assist Potter in the Room of Requirement instead of the dreaded fiendfyre?
Harry shrugged, his thoughts immediately went to Seamus and Dean - what happened to make them run off like that? Was it Celtic Serpent related? “No reason.” he replied, before jogging back to his office. He shut the door behind him and looked over at Draco, who was sat on top of the filing cabinet beside his desk, swinging his legs.
Ron raised an eyebrow, pursed his lips and nodded his head slowly. “Actually-” he started, but was cut off by Draco who let out an exasperated huff and held his hand up in protest. “No, not you as well, I won’t have it,” he demanded, shaking his head. “I’d rather not have another boyfriend that cheated on me with
Harry nodded, he couldn’t disagree the work Unspeakables did was not only dangerous, but of course a secret. He’d been friends with Hermione most of his life and she was yet to tell him what she actually did within the department. Not even Ron knew.
He sneered at her, licking his lips. “Am I not entitled to legal counsel?” he asked bitterly, the edges of his mouth turned up into a sickening smile. Lavender was briefly reminded of the way Fenrir Greyback looked at her, all those years ago. It sent a chill up her back.
snogging Ronald Weasley. Draco often wondered if he hated the ginger git because he wanted Potter as his own friend, or because he was a Weasley, or an idiot. The thought plagued him for a few drunken moments before he turned his head back to an amused looking Potter.
“You’re going to die today, little traitor.” Hissed a man. Harry could hear the thump of a hand connecting with another person, he cringed. Trying to make as little noise as he possibly could, he walked forwards but kicked something as he went.
“Probably a long day tomorrow.” Draco mused, crawling into bed. He pulled the duvet cover up to his chin and turned his head, watching as Harry stood by the foot of the bed, he wondered if he was actually going to get in or not, but he was surprised when Harry walked around the bed and slipped under the covers too. Draco turned his head back and stared at the ceiling. He wasn’t really sure he’d actually get enough sleep with Harry next to him.
“That’ll be the food.” Harry said lamely. Stood up, he walked to the door and opened it, grinning at the delivery boy stood before him. “Hiya Harry, here’s your food.” This particular delivery driver had been Harry and Draco’s favourite since they moved in. The first piece of mail they’d gotten was a menu to this particular Chinese takeaway and they’d immediately gone - Draco said it was simply ‘not polite’ to ignore mail, Harry had tried to tell him that if they answered every piece of junk mail they’d ever get they’d never have any time for anything else but Draco on this occasion had been too hard to reason with.
Still, they were all worth it. I knew, Draco, knew from that first time I saw your small, unsure smile at Blaise’s Christmas party, that you were the only person I’d ever need. You, however, took a little bit more time to believe my intentions were genuine.
Lavender had come to report straight to Harry about Lockwood. Once she’d entered the Ministry, her plan was to take him straight to Auror holding, however she’d been intercepted by Unspeakable Wilson. Instead of Auror holding, she’d taken him straight to the secure facility within the Department of Mysteries. Lavender had protested, but Kingsley had informed her that was where Lockwood would remain. The other two perps were in Auror holding, but Lavender had explained to the Unspeakables that one of them was far more advanced than the others.
Harry pressed his forehead against Draco’s and let out a shaky breath. “Draco,” he whispered softly, he hesitated for a few moments, thoughts wild. “Draco…” he repeated, unsure. “Yes?” replied Draco, in the same hushed tone.
Harry let out a chuckle and smiled at Draco, shaking his head a little before standing up. “You’re a funny one, aren’t you Malfoy?”
“I can’t believe we just watched that,” Admitted Potter, shaking his head in disbelief. They’d polished off two of the pizzas and Draco’s stomach was thoroughly stuffed. Draco let out a laugh and nodded his head. “Who knew there was so much to learn about camels?” Draco said, standing up. He shook his ankle a little and stretched his arms above his head, letting out a yawn.
“Yes, I need to go to St. Mungo’s I think,” he whispered, still staring into those emerald pools. Draco was sure he could get lost in those eyes, all those years spent fantasising come to life before him. “Potter…” he started, however cut off by Aurors piling into the room.
“A crop circle, in a farmer's field in North Yorkshire.” he passed over the photograph of the crop circle, Unspeakable Wilson was reading the report about the warehouse, but she gave nothing away whatsoever. “We went back to that scene and found three perps in full black cloaks outside a cabin in the nearby forest.” Hermione pursed her lips and nodded.
He cursed the amount of hot chocolates he’d had that day, but it was absolutely freezing. They were merely to warm him up. Nothing to do with the fact they were chocolate, sweet and delicious. Nope, not at all. He’d burst into the bathroom and closed the door behind him, walked to the toilet and frowned at the amount of steam, before he turned his head and realised to his horror he’d walked in while Harry was in the shower.
The healers levitated Draco out of his arms and moved him through the stark white corridors and through teal blue double doors off to the right. Harry followed them, but he was stopped by the Healer in charge. “Please wait here, Sir.” he said, before disappearing through the doors.
Harry then began to explain to Kingsley and Dean about the crop circle, what led up to them investigating, the boundary, forest and cabin they’d encountered whilst they were out on the field. Kingsley asked very few questions and Dean stayed silent throughout, only nodding when he heard keywords. After Harry had stopped talking, Dean turned to him and cleared his throat. “Is, er, is Seamus alright mate?” he asked, a blush raising up his neck. Harry let out a laugh and nodded. “Of course, he’s a good Auror.”
“Harry mate, can you hear me?” Asked Dean, who was crouched down to Harry’s left. How long had passed? Minutes? Hours? Harry had no idea. “Don’t worry mate, we’ve got Endelton, breathe,” Dean said, resting a comforting hand on Harry’s shoulder.
talking to other people, it was that he preferred not to. Gone was the days where he wanted attention, now all he wanted to do was disappear into the shadows. He’d only returned to Hogwarts for his mother, she said he needed to continue his education, to finish what he’d missed.
As it turned out, it had been the best meal Draco had ever tasted. The sausages were done to perfection, the bacon just the right amount of crispy, baked beans - something Draco never thought he’d find himself eating were so rich and flavourful, with mushrooms and toast. It was heavenly. Since then all Draco seemed to order was the Full English, which always made Louisa cackle.
“Oh that’s fine, well I’ll give you mine and if you get one then you can text me?” she asked hopefully. Potter nudged Draco’s shoulder and gestured towards the pair of them, a smirk on his face. “Seems like Ron’s pulled,” he said, giving Draco a cheeky wink.
“Fuck sake, what the hell?” he muttered to himself, shaking his head. Clutching the steering wheel tightly, Draco looked in his rear-view mirror and pulled off, unable to shake the uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach. It was a mix between anxiety and irritability. What should’ve been a quick and relatively painless journey seemed to turn his head upside down instead.
“We meet every Sunday for coffee, Potter,” Draco said, correctively. “It’s not the same as having an actual friend, you know, to actually talk to. I heard you and Luna are very good friends these days.”
“Unfortunately Mr. Lockwood, when you’re brought into the Ministry under suspicion of terror attacks, you’re not entitled to legal counsel. You can thank Kingsley Shacklebolt for that.” Hermione had argued about that particular law, it unsettled her. Some of the Death Eaters had been children, forced into servitude by their misguided parents. Draco had winced when he heard of the law, but he simply stated if someone was caught or they had solid proof they were acting against the Ministry and the Wizarding World in terror attacks, they deserved it. Hermione couldn’t help but feel it was wrong though.
“That’ll be why he did it then.” Harry suspected, ignoring Draco’s jibe about his age. Padding over to him, he felt a weird bubbling sensation in the pit of his stomach. He’d spent so much time staring at three photographs - now that there was more information he knew he’d spend more hours agonising over the same thing. Though, at least they were making some sort of progress. “I assume so.” Draco agreed, chewing on his lower lip. Harry noted that Draco’s hair was more mussed than usual, he wondered how many times he’d ran his hand through his hair whilst he wrote out the field report. He chuckled lightly. “Mm?” asked Draco, still staring at the corkboard in front of them.
“Thanks.” Endelton grinned. Henderson jogged towards Draco, kneeling down beside the blond. “I think we need to get Auror Malfoy to St. Mungo’s now.” she said, a note of worry in her voice. Harry had bound his perp, unfortunately the other two had gotten away. The anti apparition charm had been broken the second Seamus had brought down the back wizard. The other Celtic Serpents that had been behind had vanished too.
“Do you want to share this one?” Louisa asked Ron, who looked down at the menu. The item in question happened to be thirteen different flavours of icecream in a boat, topped with smarties, flakes, chocolate sauce, wafers, M&Ms and Merlin knows what else. Weasley’s eyes lit up like Christmas, nodding enthusiastically.
“What about you, Potter?” Draco asked curiously. It was definitely NOT because he was interested. Not at
“I don’t think that would do us any good,” Draco said quietly. This morning over his usual bowl of stale cornflakes, Draco had read the Daily Prophet. It was clearly a stupid idea, however, he was intrigued and he still had a subscription, but what he saw turned his stomach. Splashed across the front page: a picture of Harry with his arm around some wizard's shoulders and he appeared to be having the time of his life. Draco tried very hard not to be a jealous person, but it was an uphill struggle.
I got your letter and let out the most dramatic sigh of relief you’ve ever heard in your life, honestly - I’ve not been in to work because I feel so poorly, Orion has been worried, he’s circling me like an old sheep dog. I sat down on the couch in the living room and he jumped on top of me, I’m not sure he’ll allow me to go anywhere without him. I even tried to go to the loo and he followed me, sat down and stared at me. It was actually rather unsettling, a bit like my mother when she looks at you all
Harry looked furious, his cheeks blotchy red with anger. “Where the buggering fuck is Endelton?” he shouted as he wrenched the door to Kingsley’s office open. Kingsley stood up quickly, wand drawn. The Minister’s hand hovering over the Ministry’s panic button, which was installed just after Harry’s visit to the Department of Mysteries. It was an amusing story really, apparently a group of teenagers managing to get into the Department of Mysteries was unsettling, but the Dark Lord himself was enough cause to install it. Upon pressing it, the Ministry would be enveloped in a site wide Anti-Disapparation charm, as well as horribly loud alarms that gave Harry a bloody headache.  “Harry, you nearly gave me a heart attack.” the man stated, shaking his head. “Please don’t do that again, I haven’t seen Endelton, why do you ask?” he let out a breath, if a little shaky.
Potter rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t help but smile at Draco’s ridiculous statement. “Alright, you got me, but really, what time is it?” Harry nudged him lightly with his elbow. Draco shrugged his shoulders and sighed, leaning back into absolutely nothing. “Fuck I keep forgetting this shite Cafe doesn’t have proper bloody chairs.” He slapped his hands down abruptly, causing Harry to jump in surprise.
The next day, Draco decided to wait by the edge of the alleyway for Potter to turn up, checking his watch. 1:50, no Potter. 1:55, no Potter. "Hmm." he mumbled to himself. He checked his watch again at 1:56, where was Potter?
“You’re…” Draco said, frowning up at the dark haired man, all those months of angsting, of not being able to ask that burning question and it all came down to Whitney bloody Houston.
Harry launched himself in to a full blown conversation about the Celtic Serpents with Draco, talking about what they’d learnt the previous day. The dinner settled in to a comfortable chatter, Harry picked up way too many pieces of garlic bread, dipping it into the sauce generously. Even though he had terrible table manners, Draco couldn’t help but feel satisfaction when Harry enjoyed his food. He was never allowed to cook in the Manor, he was never taught. He found it therapeutic to learn, then he realised he thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a little like potions, you could alter it slightly to make it better, but if you did too much it would end up bad. He’d even started creating his own recipes.
“I’m good thanks, are you going to Hogsmeade this weekend?” Potter asked, chewing the inside of his mouth.
Once Harry had left the office, Draco let out a shaky breath. He was determined to work on this case as hard as he could but his mind couldn’t help but drift off to what happened last night and this morning, he knew it was stupid - he knew it was nothing, but it kept plaguing him. Having Harry in such close proximity made his concentration basically zero.
Placing the cake down on the side, he carefully cut two slices and plated them up on small side plates, sticking a fork in the top of each one. He walked back over to the table and placed it in front of Harry, who eyed the cake. “Mm, I love this one.” Harry commented, leaning forward in his chair. He grabbed the fork and started stabbing the cake, shovelling it into his mouth with impressive speed. Draco shook his head.
“You caught me.” he said, stifling a laugh and holding his hands up in mock surrender. Unspeakable Wilson let out a huff and rolled her eyes. “You’re a petulant idiot aren’t you?” the cold tone in her voice made Hermione wince inwardly. “What were you doing in that field?” asked Wilson, staring at him intently.
“Well I better go home I suppose,” Draco said dreamily, nodding his head. He thought back to his comfy couch, his furry cat, all the many blankets, throws and other random junk he’d bought over the years, he’d become somewhat of a hoarder. Muggle objects were very interesting.
At around midnight, Draco had finished watching his dolphin program, then he went on to an animal rescue program after that - he was watching a dog that had been abandoned by some rather vile muggles in his opinion, nothing to do with their status as one would have once thought. When they’d received the dog it had severe starvation, as well as a few diseases. The program was called Animal Cops Houston. Draco was lucky Harry was asleep next to him his head on Draco’s shoulder because he would have laughed at Draco’s tears. The truth was, he really didn’t want to move. It was so nice having Harry so close to him, he needed to go to the bathroom about two hours ago but he held it just for the closeness. It was funny, he knew the pining was ridiculous but it seemed like they went through this endless cycle of never dating anyone else, yet dancing around each other. Draco wondered often if it worked both ways, sometimes he’d see a faraway look in Harry’s eyes, or he’d hold his gaze for a little longer than a friend would, or maybe he’d smile at him, that soft loving smile.
though. Dropping a whole case of Wolfsbane? Not using even the simplest of levitating spells? That isn’t like you at all, Draco. You should have told Theo to sod off when he called you names! It make my hackles rise to even
Draco gave him a sidelong glance and shrugged his shoulders. “If you insist.” Harry bit his lip and walked towards the kitchen, pulling out the spaghetti from the cupboard. He placed it down on the side and grabbed a pan for it. He filled the pan up under the sink and placed it down on the hob, turning the dial.
Harry began to explain to Draco how they’d both been hit by a stunning spell, however when Draco tumbled, the man had kicked him hard in the head, knocking Draco out. Harry then began to explain they were locked in some dingy supply cupboard, and that his hands were bound together. Draco frowned. He looked down at his own hands which were left free, but then noticed the shackles around his ankles and let out a groan.
The lady that owned the Cafe looked as though she could be closely related to Ollivander, haggard looking and probably past her sell by date. When he’d first came to the Cafe, he’d winced upon seeing her, his mind flashing back to when Ollivander was indeed in the Manor's dungeon. Of course Draco had often taken a biscuit or two down to the prisoners, he remembered the beating of his life he’d received when Fenrir Greyback caught him trying to sneak down there for the fourth time in one day.
“Draco.” Harry breathed, waving his hand for him to come over. Draco walked towards him, looking at him expectantly. “What?” he looked in the direction Harry was fixed to, his eyes widening. “What…” he breathed, he held his hand out to pick up the object but thought better of it.
“Mm, I think you’ve earned yourself detention, Potter.” Draco stated, shaking his head. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and you have to order takeaway for the next fifty years too.”
Kingsley walked forwards, towards the staircase in front of them and turned his head. “Well, now is as good as you’re going to get.” the Minister stated, before he walked out of sight. Harry looked around, scanning the faces of Aurors around them. He wandered over to Henderson who was appointed to guard the front doors and leaned forwards “Henderson, please send an owl to Narcissa Malfoy about Draco’s state, mention nothing but request a firecall with her.” it came out as a whisper, she nodded and turned on her heel.
Draco rolled his eyes and stared down at the menu, not catching the amusement on Potter’s face. It seemed like Potter’s favourite past time was now to watch Draco intently. It almost reminded the blond of Hogwarts, wherever he’d go in sixth year the oaf would be somewhere nearby. “Why don’t you take a picture, Potter,” Draco said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Potter raised an eyebrow. “It’ll last longer.” he said, his eyes rising to meet the brightest, deepest emerald.
He sat down at his desk and sighed, something that had become a habit recently. He unbuttoned his Auror robes and slung them across the back of his office chair. He suddenly remembered the parchment he’d shoved in his pocket, he pulled it out and smoothed it down. It looked like it had been opened and folded over several times.
Maybe Draco was just overthinking it, like he usually did. He inwardly cursed himself - he always did this. If Harry had an ounce of interest in him he’d have told him years ago, after all he had the Gryffindor courage, not Draco. Sighing, he nudged Harry gently. They had work tomorrow and he knew if he let him sleep on the sofa he’d have a cranky Harry in the morning. The last time they’d done this he’d woken up with a stiff neck and he’d never stopped banging on about it all day. It drove Draco around the twist.
“Mm,” Draco finally nodded in agreement, in all seriousness Draco blocked out the world only focusing on himself, his job and Louisa. Of course Bethany was a large part of his life too, but Bethany was a package deal with Louisa. “I can see why you’d think that.” Draco said, his voice faltering slightly. It was picked up by Potter almost immediately, Draco ducked his head down, avoiding the man's gaze.
After about twenty minutes, Harry returned with two large pizzas, one meat feast and the other meatilicious, which was Harry’s. “I got those cookies that you like too.” he said as he kicked the door shut behind him. Draco’s eyes glistened and a wide smile appeared on his face. “Oh baby, am I glad to see you.” he let out a squeak as Harry handed him the box of hot chocolate chip cookies. Harry blushed and averted his eyes, placing both pizza boxes down on the coffee table.
“Is that..?” he trailed off, eyes wandering towards Harry’s face. Harry nodded, giving him a grim smile. In front of them, stood a trinket box with the mark of the Celtic Serpents.
As for your lack of faith in my journalistic abilities, Draco, I think I might have to concede your point. Last night I ended up apologising to Ron because he woke me with his snoring! I wouldn’t last six minutes at the
When they’d arrived outside Mrs. Dunn’s cottage, Harry looked down at his watch and tapped it lightly with his finger. “Home after this.” he grinned, giving Draco a wink. Draco ducked his head down, a blush tinging his cheeks.
Sipping at his drink lightly, he placed it back down on the wooden table and met Hermione’s eyes, almost a challenge. The door to Costa swung open and in walked the ginger head of Hermione’s husband, Ron.
“Hiya, how’s it going?” Returning the smile, Ron leant down to kiss his wife on the forehead before plonking down on the seat next to her. Draco shrugged a shoulder casually, clearing his throat. “Your wife here is trying to get me to go on a date with Potter.” He said, glaring at Hermione who looked amused.
“What do you think of Whitney Houston?” asked Harry, who sat rather lopsidedly in a chair next to his bed. He was flicking through a Witch Weekly magazine with disinterest, before throwing it down on the wooden table next to the bed, his eyes settling on Draco.
“You have nothing to be sorry for.” he whispered to Draco, who looked up at him. He could see the pain in his eyes, Harry could only imagine the horrors the blonde witnessed during the war, they’d talked about it of course, but he could only assume. “Mm.” Draco mumbled, shaking his head. “We have to catch these bastards, Harry.” his voice faltered, he looked destroyed, pain etched in to those sparkling gray eyes. A tear ran down his cheek, Harry’s heart broke for him.
This pretentious rich boy eating peasant food, she’d said. Harry was no different he’d commented immediately when Draco ordered the Full English. “I didn’t think you’d like something like that,” the man had said, Draco rolled his eyes in response, placing the menu back down on the rack to the right of him. Harry had ordered the same thing.
These days, Draco kept to himself mainly - the only friends he had left from school being Pansy and Blaise, he did have quite a decent amount of muggle friends too, his best friend being a girl called Louisa.
Lavender nodded in agreement and bowed her head. “I’ll go find Henderson now, sir.” she mumbled, before turning on her heel and jogging off towards her desk. Harry watched her retreating figure and smiled slightly. Always eager to help out any way she could, Harry wondered if the war was the reason for her tenacity. Shaking his head, he tried to clear his mind of errant thoughts of the war and made his way down to the Department of Mysteries.
“Well it seems we’ve both been thinking about the same thing then.” Harry admitted, letting out a laugh.
“I have no idea, Dean and Seamus ran off about twenty minutes said it was important, Brown and Henderson got called into the Minister’s office and I think I just saw Draco go in to your office.” he said slowly, looking up at Harry with a frown. “Why?”
“Have you got a camera?” Potter replied, a cheeky smile on his face. The edges of Draco’s mouth turned upwards into a slight smile, he rolled his eyes. “What are you having?” asked Draco, gesturing towards the menu. Pursing his lips, Potter snatched the menu out of Draco’s hand and began scouring the list.
Sighing dramatically, Harry nodded his head and folded his arms, putting them on the table in front of him and slumped his chin on top of them. “I know, but I wish I wasn’t," he mumbled.
by the news. I cannot wait until the day arrives when I can lay my hands on the swell of your growing belly. I want you both to feel the depth of my all consuming love for you.
“Are you two going to play footsie, share desserts and flash crazy eyes at each other?” Draco asked, looking down at the menu casually, inside he felt anything but casual.
Hermione had left a little under an hour ago, Harry had only realised she left when Healer Jenkins had entered the room, he’d cast a series of status charms on Draco’s body and scribbled something down on the notes at the end of his bed. He’d only learnt the man’s name from another Healer who shouted for him and he quickly left. Harry sat staring at Draco intently. Almost willing him to wake up. After Jenkins had left, Harry began talking - he’d read somewhere that even when people were unconscious they could still hear people talking, or something.
“Hello darling,” she smiled, pulling the chair out from under the table for him to sit. Draco had gotten over his disdain for Weasley over the years,as he was actually quite a decent person to talk to, or well, he was decent in general. Draco received almost all of his Quidditch related information from Ron, who had a thick binder of stats on Quidditch players. Hermione often commented if Ron spentas much time on his homework at Hogwarts as he did his fantasy Quidditch, he’d have been an academic.
“Are we nearly there?” asked Louisa, still staring down at her new Joan Jonker novel. “Not long now” Draco smiled turning his head towards her briefly. “I’m starving,” she sighed, closing the cover of her book. Louisa opened the glove compartment and slid the book inside.
Potter ordered two Spiced Rum and Coke, which happened to be Draco’s second favourite drink. Not that he would admit that to Potter. “So, what have you been up to?” Potter asked nonchalantly, turning his head towards Draco.
“So, if you don’t wake up I won’t ever let you watch your documentaries ever again, no dolphins, no pharaohs, no sad doggies needing rescuing.” he announced, staring at Draco’s face - he wanted just a flicker of
Louisa rolled her eyes, linking her arm through Draco’s. “Why are all the hot ones gay?” she moaned, she pulled her sunglasses up on to the top of her head and nudged Draco lightly. Draco let out a snort of laughter. “I knew you wanted me, you saucy bint.” Louisa rolled her eyes again, shaking her head in dismay. “Come on, let’s find our seats.”
Truth be told, I'm not sure that I agree with Pansy’s description of you as ‘ridiculously hormonal’. You don’t appear to much different to the Draco that I’ve known and loved for more years that I can remember. I can quite believe you barking at poor old Orion though. I distinctly recall you barking at me on a few occasions when I tried to nab a couple of chips off your plate. For such a skinny arse, you are terribly protective of your dinners. You and your stinky old crup are two of a kind, love. Best just to accept it!
I’ll be sure to pass on the message regarding that awful excuse for a newspaper. I heard from Daphne (I think she’s feeling bad, she came in with a care package earlier, I thought that was quite kind of her) they’ve agreed to go on a date, so I’ll be your eagle eyes and gossip queen for this particular situation, I assure you. Although it seems rather sudden, I need to do some further digging and find out what spurred this on so quickly. After all, we've been waiting for far too long already.
“What the bloody hell are you doing?!” Draco asked, trying to cover his eyes with his hand in melodramatic fashion. Harry let out a laugh. “You’ve seen me naked in the shower, and you’re upset about me taking my clothes off here?”
Our case is close to finishing soon, I’m sure of it. We’ve nearly got enough evidence to put before the Wizengamot and be guaranteed of a conviction. Those Horntail eggs that I told you about? They were 100% genuine. The smugglers are convinced that Mils and I want to buy them. Once the eggs hatch, then the final counterfeit transaction can take place. That’s when we’ll make the arrests.
Draco was feeling a mix of discomfort and vulnerability, there was something oddly intimate about sleeping in the same bed as someone else, like you’re sharing the same space, for all Draco knew Potter could kill him in the night. Draco could hear a low, consistent thump from the next room, he squinted into the darkness of the room. “What’s that noise?” he whispered to Potter, trying to place it in his mind.
“Cufflinks.” he said lamely, turning away from the other man. Harry nodded and pulled out his own suit, letting out a sigh. “I hate wearing dress robes.” he declared, throwing it on the bottom of the bed. Draco eyed it, noting that it was pretty much identical to his own. It only caused his blush to deepen. They matched.
“Harry?!” came the shout of a familiar voice, Draco’s eyes shooting open as he finally recognised the voice. “Ron?!” Harry shouted in reply. Relief flooded over Draco’s features, he slumped in his sitting position and let out a relieved sigh. “Thank Merlin, I thought we were done for,” he whispered to Harry, who nodded in agreement. As he was about to reply, the door to the supply room they were shut in flew open, Draco immediately closed his eyes, unable to take the blinding light shining through the doorway.
It was that swirl of thoughts that always knocked Draco well off his kilter, there were thousands of different possibilities in the world, he’d learnt that from sitting in a science lecture one day, he wasn’t actually meant to be there but he’d walked into Leeds University and just sat down.
“Me neither, still fucking annoying though.” she narrowed her eyes, her gaze wandered to Draco’s hair. “Why’s he still covered in blood?”
“Mr. Malfoy,” the Goblin started, eyeing Harry curiously. “As you are aware, we have found a vault belonging to the late Mr. Malfoy.” Draco nodded, gesturing for him to continue. “Naturally, we had to have it scanned first, however it has come up clean therefore we can hand over the key to yourself.”
. If you wolfed them down like they were going out of fashion (and you did, I know you far too well!) then I’ve no doubt that several more packages have arrived by owl by now. Narcissa knows already, Draco. Let the fussing commence!
“Yes, well, anyway, let’s get tea before our beards grow in shall we?” Draco said, frowning at his own words. Beards? What the absolute buggering fuck?
“I’ll pass, thank you.” Draco replied, scowling at his friend. Hermione tutted, shaking her head. “Harry was asking about you today actually,” she said, narrowing her eyes. Draco knew exactly what she was up to; it would never happen. “Apparently the two of you have been conducting some sort of elaborate investigation?” The sparkle in her eyes left Draco feeling a little uneasy.
It really was so unfair how good looking Potter was. With his abs and his tight clothes, his stupid just shagged looking hair and those gorgeous eyes, it was almost as though he was a walking advertisement for blue balls.
“Come back you!” Draco shouted, his boots clunking against the floor as he ran. “No! I didn’t mean it Draco no!” Harry stood up against the front door, his hands up in the air in surrender.
“Sounds like you’re important,” Potter said, stabbing a sausage with his fork. Draco chewed his bottom lip thoughtfully, before nodding his head. “I mean, who would book appointments without you?” Potter winked, shoving the sausage into his mouth.
“Wanna watch a movie then?” Potter asked, gesturing with his shoulder towards the square television. Draco nodded, feeling somewhat awkward again. The alcohol had helped loosen him up, but now he was sobering he felt the effects of his anxiety come back tenfold. It was really an annoying trait of his.
Draco cleared his throat and shrugged his shoulders. “Not a lot really, I book appointments, sign people in, file paperwork and pretend that I’m actually a valuable asset to the team.” he laughed, it caught Potter off guard a little, as though it was something rare you’d never see again from the blond.
“Right, well we haven’t had any more cases come through our department, yourself and Brown are free to get lunch.” he offered her a weak smile, she nodded curtly at Harry, then Draco before exiting the office closing the door behind her.
way. Your baby crib sounds very flamboyant to say the least. Some pieces of ancient magical furniture have protective wards built into their construction, so lets hold onto it. Maybe we could transfigure the gilded design into something a bit simpler? And perhaps if Cissa doesn’t like our lack of decorating, she could send over a couple of the Malfoy House-Elves to help you? You know they’re always wrangling to come and visit you.
“Very nice,” Potter said, nodding his head. He ran his hand along the kitchen counter top and bit the inside of his mouth. Draco shrugged his shoulders and walked towards the kettle, which sat beside the sink and clicked it on. “It’s home.” Draco said, a small smile on his face.
“Ronald will receive his full pension, as well as a monthly retirement package, the first Auror to receive this package since it was introduced two years ago.” Harry turned his body towards Ron, who was standing next to him was definitely looking better, still stood with his cane but otherwise he was himself again. The look of sadness etched onto his face saddened Harry greatly. Nevertheless, he picked up a purple ribboned medal and placed it around his shoulders.
going out, I have a date.” he smiled. Harry’s head immediately snapped towards Draco’s direction, his eyes wide. An unsettling feeling in the pit of his stomach, like waving nausea. “You have a date?” he repeated flatly. Draco nodded his head. “Yes, I have a date.” he tapped Harry’s legs for him to lift up, once Harry had moved his legs he pulled himself up off the sofa and made his way back to the kitchen.
“Hey, here’s your coffee.” Harry said as he walked through the door, he kicked it shut with his heel and walked to Draco, handing it to him. Draco took the coffee and nodded, uttering a quick thank you before he started sipping it. “You know, we only have one murder but we have many crop circles, perhaps that woman was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time?” he suggested. “Do we know where she’d been prior to the murder?”
Draco nodded. “Yeah.” he let out breathily. He brought his left arm up and linked his fingers with Harry’s, there was absolutely no way two friends would act like this, but Draco could neither ask him whether he liked him too, nor ask what the bloody hell was happening. A few moments passed and Draco felt his eyes droop, it didn’t take him long to drift off to sleep.
Have you told Cissa about the baby yet? I’m thrilled to see what her reaction will be. She’ll be ecstatic. Her broomstick will fly over the bloody moon. Of course, you’ll never be rid of her once you tell we’re expecting. I suspect she’ll make noises about moving into the spare room...
Potter let out a rather loud, enthusiastic laugh, his smile almost reaching his hairline. “I already have a beard Malfoy, you didn’t notice?” It was weird, Draco hadn’t really had a civil conversation with Potter, actually to tell the truth he wasn’t sure he’d ever actually had a
The case was getting more and more complicated by the second. There was a lot more to it than he’d originally anticipated and if they did have a mole in the department he needed to tell Kinglsey as soon as possible. Sighing, he left the office and made his way towards Kingsley’s. This was not going to be an easy meeting.
But let me change to happier subjects. I have every belief that the raid will go exactly as planned.
“I think so.” Harry mumbled, clearing his throat. His mouth was dry, his head pounding. It wasn’t unusual Harry would get a headache, but this one felt like his head was about ready to explode. “What happened?” he asked, a blush staining his cheeks.
Kneeling down, Harry winced and reached his hand up to Draco’s forehead. Their eyes met and Draco bit his lip hard, because if only for a moment, Draco felt as though perhaps Potter felt the same way too.
It was painted quite nicely, a simple white - all the kitchen counters were black marble top but the cupboards themselves were white. There was illuminated lighting underneath the cabinets, with a microwave, toaster and a large range cooker in the middle, surrounded by a kitchen island.
Pursing her lips, Louisa nodded her head. One of the best things about her was the fact she did not press, she believed in letting you do things in your own time. Something Draco often wished his parents had learnt. He shuddered remembering his mother prying, rummaging around his bedroom after he’d sat staring at his cutlery one day instead of eating his dinner.
“No, I mean, the crop circle doesn’t really tie in to illegal activity, unless they were doing something in that particular field and they had to cover it up, so they burnt the crop circle in to the field.” Harry bit down on his lower lip and jogged over to his desk leafing through some of the paperwork on his desk. Pulling out the sheet he was looking for his eyes skimmed the words until it landed on what he was looking for. “Yeah, here, look.” he held the sheet up and jogged over to Draco’s desk thrusting the parchment into his hands.
“Indeed,” Draco nodded, his eyes still following the form of Potter. Draco couldn’t deny he was a decent flyer, but a seekers job was the most boring until you spotted the snitch. Draco also couldn’t deny that Weasley was an impressive beater, he’d definitely finessed his skills since Hogwarts. A rather painful flashback of ‘Weasley is Our King’ flashed through his memories. It wasn’t totally unusual for Louisa to find the brute attractive, he was alright, Draco supposed.
“What do you think I was doing?” He asked, his tone mocking, his eyes sparkled with mischief. Wilson stood up, ready to lunge at the man - held back by Lavender who placed a gentle hand on Wilson’s arm. “He’s not worth it,” Lavender whispered, her eyes searching Wilson’s face. “Let it go.”
okay?” He whispered into his neck. The action startled Draco, he wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and closed his eyes. “Yes,” He replied simply. “You look like shit.”
Pulled out of his musings, Harry looked towards the front door as the doorbell rang. “Pizza,” Harry smiled, he nudged Draco who shifted away slightly. Standing up, Harry made his way to the front door, looked through the peephole before opening the door. Draco quickly cast an accio to a blanket from the bedroom and wrapped it around his body, smiling gratefully as Harry returned to the sofa with two boxes of Domino’s pizza.
“Tommy Jenkins.” Draco frowned, staring at the memo. “Guess we better break it to poor Mrs. Dunn that it wasn’t that bloody Jim.” he teased, grinning at Harry. The look on Draco’s face made Harry’s stomach jump, he returned the grin, nodding his head. “Yeah.”
Finding out that I was a wizard, aged only eleven? Discovering that I was able to cast spells and that there was a whole world outside of everything I’d ever known? All of that pales in comparison with your news. Your beautifully formed letters have created the most wonderful, welcome sentences that I think I’ll ever read in my entire life. Every fibre of my being is desperate to return to your side. I want to look after you, Draco and tend to your every need.
Harry had been accepted into Auror training along with Draco, Ron, Lavender, Dean and Seamus. Neville had been accepted as an apprentice to Professor Sprout, Ginny had gone off to join the Holyhead Harpies, Luna was editor of the Quibbler, Hermione had joined the Department of Mysteries, which to this day none of them really knew what she did, only that she was an Unspeakable. Harry was a little disappointed that Draco wasn’t his Auror partner, but overjoyed when he’d found out he’d been assigned with Ron. Draco’s Auror partner was Tracey Davis, which he’d worked very well with. When Harry was made Head Auror, he’d asked Ron to be his Deputy, but Ron had declined the offer ‘too much paperwork mate.’ he’d said, Harry often wished he’d accepted. Instead, he’d asked Draco who agreed almost immediately. Tracey had been reassigned to Ron. Harry knew Draco had been close to Tracey, but he didn’t want to press the situation when Draco had discovered his ex-partner had been killed in the line of duty. Eventually, Draco had opened up and told him he was pretty devastated, they’d toasted her life with a bottle of Ogden’s which resulted in a hefty hangover in the morning.
Having a family of my own is one of my dearest wishes- when I was a child, even before I knew I had magic!- I used to sit alone in my cupboard and wonder what it would be like to live with people that loved you, wanted you and cared enough to
"Perhaps," he drawled, slipping his notebook into his jacket pocket. "What are you doing down that alleyway?" he asked, shooting daggers at Potter, who looked thoroughly amused at this point. "For once, it's you following me." Potter smirked, shoving a hand into his jeans pocket. Draco rolled his eyes and pushed past him, causing Potter to chuckle.
Hermione rarely saw the woman react to anything, she wondered what had happened to Rose to make her act this brash. The interview waned on with the usual questions, however none of which were answered coherently by Lockwood, who preferred to make it into a joke. After twenty minutes, Hermione ended the interview and ordered the guard to take Lockwood back to his cell.
Draco’s hold tightened to an almost unbearable pain, Harry grimaced and looked up at his partner. The other man looked almost ill. He slackened his grip and gave an apologetic half-smile to Harry, who nodded.
Harry grimaced, he felt Draco’s fingers wrap around his forearm tightly. “They were shipping crates of maximum strength Veratiserum to use on the new recruits of their organization to ensure cooperation and ultimately, loyalty.” Harry nodded, gesturing for her to continue. “What we believe is they intend to use the Dark Arts to conjure some sort of…”
More than anything I wish I could be by your side while you visit the Healers and take those foul tasting potions. If I could imbibe them for you, love, I swear that I would do.
Harry cursed himself that they’d left the area ‘secure’ so they could return later. All he’d done was made it easier for the Serpents to clean up whatever mess they’d left. He wasn’t even sure how they managed to get around their wards, they were foolproof nearly every single time. He had to say nearly now, they’d never been tampered with before.
When Harry, Draco and Seamus had returned to the Ministry, Harry had immediately sought out Kingsley to brief him on their findings. Draco had gone back to the office to write out their field report, after asking Seamus to go down to spell damage and ask about the sticky note he’d received earlier. Upon walking through the door to the Ministers office, Harry’s eyes rested on Robards and Dean, who was sitting awkwardly in the high backed chair in front of Kingsley’s desk.
Draco shook his head, he was clearly listening. “No, Endelton used the same safe house to store that woman who had been attacked by the Werewolf.” Dean cringed, that particular case was the most gruesome one he’d witnessed, and he’d witnessed some pretty vile things in his years as an Auror.
As for the Wolfsbane Potion? What was the last thing I said to you before I left? Yes, I know it was ‘love you’, but
I find myself looking back at your other letters, I’m afraid I’ve smudged the ink with my bloody tears, I’m almost as bad as Moaning Myrtle. Though she wasn’t that bad, misunderstood and lonely as am I. Merlin, Harry, what am I going to do without you if you don't come back?
“Ron and Harry came to the Premier Inn for a room too, apparently their usual place was full,” Louisa said, her eyes sparkling with mischief. Draco knew that look all too well. “I saw Ron in the lobby after you’d gone up to your room and well…” she trailed off, looking up at Weasley for confirmation. The brute nodded in agreement.
“I would like to take the artifact in question so that myself and Unspeakable Granger can inspect it.” she said evenly, eyeing Kingsley. “That will be fine.” he nodded in agreement. Hermione bit her lip and turned her head towards Draco. “If it’s okay, we’d like to seize the vault so we can look through it a little better.”
melodramatic. You’re such a sap sometimes Potter, I despair. I’m definitely one hundred percent not crying whilst I write this, because I definitely didn’t reread your letter about fifty times, no of course not. Orion is my witness, you have nothing on me!
They moved towards him with impressive speed, casting a series of status spells over Draco’s body. Harry looked down at the man in his arms, fighting back the tears that threatened to escape. Dark thoughts began to plague Harry’s mind, what would he do without Draco? If he died, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to carry on. “Please help him.” he choked out, tears began to flow freely down his cheeks, dropping on to Draco’s blood stained robes.
Harry’s brows furrowed as he walked towards his office, unfolding the parchment and scanning it quickly.
Harry sighed, looked up at the blond and offered a pained smile. “Kingsley put me on leave, we went to the first warehouse - they had Endelton and er-” He was cut off by the stricken look on Draco’s face. “He’s fine, but I had a panic attack I think, er.. I couldn’t do anything,” he said, a blush staining his cheeks. He ran a hand through his hair and looked down at his thighs.
“Has he woken up yet?” Harry asked, finally turning his attention back to the Healer. The man nodded his head, he then frowned and turned his back to the two of them. “Wait,” he mumbled, before jogging towards another Healer at the end of the ward.
When Harry and Draco arrived at the coordinates, neither man really knew what to expect. Upon apparition, Harry was immediately greeted by Seamus. The other man was always known for how upbeat he was, he was extremely well put together when it came to their work and he rarely ever showed signs of emotion, Harry always prided his teammate on his professionalism. However, he had never once witnessed how destroyed his friend looked, unshed tears prickling his eyes, he looked pale, a little green around the edges. Dean on the other hand stood by the curb being violently sick. Harry’s stomach plummeted as he turned his head towards his partner. Draco looked just as shaken by the two other Auror’s as Harry felt.
Harry brought his fist up to his mouth, trying to conceal a laugh. Draco rolled his eyes and nodded, offering a sympathetic smile to Mrs Dunn. “We have confiscated the stolen items, once they’ve been checked over by the department we’ll be returning them to you.”
“What’s wrong?” Louisa asked, placing a hand gently on his knee. It was something she did quite often, Draco still struggled to cope with emotions - something that the PTSD support group had managed to help with as well as his muggle psychiatrist, but there were times where he’d have a relapse, or he’d struggle.
“I did actually notice, Potter, thank you,” Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. Walking forwards, he didn’t bother to check whether Potter was actually following; he just wandered over to the counter to order two cups of the usual lacklustre, really quite dire tea. It reminded him a bit of Aunt Bella’s tea, except less poison and more sugar.
“Sorry,” Harry said lamely, ducking his head down a few inches. “So what you’re saying is, Lockwood was with the Celtic Serpents at least three months ago?” Draco just shrugged “I’m not sure - who was Lockwood’s partner when he was training?” Draco asked, looking at Harry expectantly. “Uh, er…” Harry frowned, racking his brains. He knew Lockwood’s partner hadn’t managed to complete their training but he would be damned if he knew who it was. If he could remember correctly, they were exceptionally lacklustre.
Harry slapped his hands onto his thighs and stood up, nodding his head towards Draco. “Well we best be off, we’ll be in touch about your pumpkins Mrs. Dunn.” she handed both of them a few biscuits for the road and they left the cottage about 45 minutes after they’d entered.
I will hold my hands up, I have fed him numerous sausages, numerous chicken breasts and I even shared my lunch with him today. The only consolation to this entire debacle is that I have the company of this grumpy old Crup that reminds me oh so of your shaggy hair. Actually, he kisses quite the same too. Kidding, of course. All I can think of is laying in bed with you, staring up at the gold painted stars on our ceiling. There’s nothing I want more in the world than you back here with me, I can’t take much longer.
“Hey Malfoy, you’re good at potions right?” Draco was almost positive by now Potter must know his ability in Potions, but his mind began to put him down, wondering why on earth Potter would take notice of what Draco was good at, or even what he did in a day.
” he moaned. Of course Louisa would have to choose Ronald Weasley as the hottest man on the team, if the world wasn’t torturing him enough. “Oh you know him then? You can introduce me.” She said, a wicked smile appearing on her ruby red lips.
It was all very sickeningly sweet. “Well, I suppose we better get going back to London,” Draco finally said, placing his knife and fork down on his empty plate. He downed the rest of his Gin and Lemonade and gave Louisa a look, which she knew all too well.
Once they’d finished dinner, Draco turned his head towards the fridge. “Do you want dessert?” he asked, looking at Harry who was sat slouched back in his chair. “Mm, yeah.” he nodded. Draco snorted and shook his head, he stood up and took their plates over to the kitchen counter. Quickly muttering a spell so the pots, pans and dishes would wash themselves. He wandered over to the fridge and pulled out a blackforest gateau, which he’d purchased in Tesco earlier. He had thought about making his own dessert, but he wasn’t sure he’d have the time.
Once they’d all eaten and discussed everything, they left the break room in pairs. The day didn’t seem to be productive for Harry, but it felt more serious than it had before.
After about half an hour, Draco had gone through his filing cabinets and retrieved almost every report Lockwood had ever filled out, some of them were joint with Endelton. Harry was stood clipping different pieces to the cork board he deemed necessary to the case. He’d rooted out the other cases of crop circles and put them beside the original, when he was done he frowned. They all seemed to be around the North Yorkshire area, he was sure they could rule that this particular area seemed to be where they preferred to base.
You’ll have got my other letter by now. You’ll be glad to know that I’m back to a state of (relative!) calm. I can actually form whole words with my mouth which is a definite improvement on earlier today. I’m still utterly overawed, and overjoyed by your pregnancy but I’m valiantly fighting the powerful urge to Apparate home to be by your side.
“Do you want to sleep with me?” he asked, cringing at the way he worded it. Eloquent Malfoy, eloquent, he thought.
Kicking his door open, Harry began stripping his robes off tossing them carelessly on to the floor, he yanked his wardrobe open and pulled out a pair of jeans and a soft cream jumper. He pulled his black linen trousers off, throwing them down on top of his robes and slipped the jeans on, fastening the buttons. He stifled a yawn and pulled the jumper over his ‘Guns & Roses’ t-shirt. Slipping his vans on, he walked back through to the living room and scowled at Draco who was nursing a cup of tea between his hands.
“Are you alright?” Potter asked. His voice sounded hoarse and Draco winced. “Yes, my head though, it - well it hurts.” he answered.
It always brought him back to his younger self, how prejudiced he was against muggles, had his younger self met Louisa he’d never have looked at her twice, the thought of his life without this ridiculous woman gave him indigestion.
“Oh er, of course, sure,” Potter replied, sounding a little shocked. “It’s muggle though, so you know.” He added. Draco could hear the hesitancy in his voice, and he let out a chuckle. “I have an iPod, Potter, I think I can handle a game.”
Absentmindedly, Draco began running his hands through Harry’s hair, which earned a noise of satisfaction from Harry, who was now half asleep. Looking down at the sleepy man beside him, Draco let himself believe in the fantasy of being the person Harry loved, even if for a moment.
“Mmm?” Harry mumbled, sleepily. Draco smiled at the other man, his head was still on his shoulder, but he’d somehow wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist, he’d not noticed before. He bit down on his lip and braced himself for the awkward moment he was about to have, but it never came. “What time is it?” Harry asked, moving closer to Draco, if that was even possible.
“Malfoy, what are you thinking about?” came the quiet voice of Potter, who was standing just a little too close for comfort. Draco’s eyes narrowed towards Potter, he mumbled under his breath “What do you mean?” which came out a little more scathing than he’d intended.
“What we watching today?” Harry asked, squinting at the screen. His box of chow mein had been so hot it steamed his glasses up. “Something about dolphins.” Draco mumbled in response, sticking his fork into the clear plastic container. “Cool.”
Once inside their room, Draco looked around and inwardly groaned. On the way back to the hotel he’d sobered a little, so everything didn’t spin as rapidly as it had been doing. He’d also eaten copious amounts of pizza on the way there, luckily Potter had bought four large pizzas from Dominos.
Pulling up in front of Louisa’s apartment, Draco smiled at her and bit his lower lip. “I’ll see you later, yeah?” he asked. Louisa nodded, still staring down at her mobile phone. Rolling his eyes, he waved his hand as she closed the car door and let out a breath he wasn’t sure he was holding.
Harry let out a laugh “I asked the same thing, something to do with curse damage can’t touch them bollocks.” he shrugged. Lavender frowned, leaning back in her chair. “Right.”
No doubt, you’ve have been letting him sleep on my side of the bed each night. You always fib and deny it, but I know the truth. That
“Sorry.” Harry said sheepishly, pulling back from the hug. A blush stained his cheeks, he turned quickly towards Seamus and ran a hand through his hair. “Anything?”
“I’ll bite your dick off.” he finished. Harry let out a bark of laughter. “You’ll bite my-” he was cut off by a hand slapping to his mouth. He looked at Malfoy with challenging eyes, and licked his hand. Draco recoiled and stuck his tongue out in disgust.
I’d better go, Draco. Ron is giving me the filthiest of glares from across the room. He wants to go to sleep but I have my wand
“Lethal Weapon 2,” Potter smiled. “It’s a good one.” He stood up, eyeing Draco’s large flatscreen mounted to the wall and frowned. “I really never would’ve expected you to have a television, I mean it’s basically the feature of your entire room.” He chuckled, walking towards the television. He looked around for a DVD player, finding one on a small mounted shelf just off to the right of the television.
Draco looked down at his arm. He began to tap lightly on his wrist and nodded his head, as though a deeply intriguing thing had just happened. “It’s quarter-past the freckle.”
Draco began to explain about the Goblin’s finding a vault belonging to his father, Harry produced the trinket box in question and placed it down gently on to Kingsley’s desk, the shimmer of magic surrounding it. A few minutes later, Unspeakable Wilson, Hermione and Blaise entered the office.
“Merlin she’s a delight isn’t she?” he mumbled, shaking his head. Hermione just chuckled. “She’s lovely actually.”
“Harry,” Draco said, his voice a little unsteady. Harry raised an eyebrow and turned his head towards Draco, noting that they were indeed just inches away from each other. “I wondered..”
“Alright then, well I’m going out.” Draco announced, turning his attention to the television. Harry frowned. “Okay where are we going?” he bit his lip. Harry really didn’t have any intention of going out today, but if Draco wanted to he would make the effort. Draco let out a chuckle and rolled his eyes. “I said
“Mm, yes?” he asked quietly, looking into those blazing green eyes. He felt his heart rate speed up, he inwardly cursed his rogue body.
Hey guys, here I am with another chapter. Sorry it's a little late. I hope you enjoy it. This one is more relationship development, but there is a nice little case element too.
“Draco,” Harry said, a little more breathless than he’d expected. He walked towards Draco, placing his hand on the metal bed rail at the foot of the bed. “You’re awake.” He added, lamely. There were a million different thoughts and feelings going through his mind.
“I want to find love, but - I don’t want another Samuel.” Draco finally admitted, letting out a deep sigh.
Draco raised an eyebrow and pondered the idea of the game for a few moments. “That sounds like fun actually,” he admitted, ducking his head down. He felt a little silly for having this conversation with Potter while they were trapped in this dank room, but nevertheless he continued. “Do you think you could show it to me someday?” Draco asked hopefully. There was nothing as depressing as his current life so the thought of controlling a fantasy life where Draco Malfoy could get married, he could have a thriving career and wear something other than a gray suit and mope outside a gaudy cafe sounded like heaven.
Draco cleared his throat and dove into the inner workings of a Quidditch match, explaining what the quaffle did, the goals, it essentially wasn’t that different to football, except obviously the flying and the bats.
“What the absolute fuck.” Draco said, shaking his head. Harry took a careful look at his partner, his face ashen. The room was destroyed, broken pieces of furniture scattered along the back wall, the sofa upturned in the small joined kitchen. The carpet which was once a light green colour was now stained dark with blood. The body, which Harry could only assume was female cut into pieces, the parts scattered in to the Celtic Serpent symbol. Harry immediately turned around and gagged.
“I love you.” Draco said, mustering as much courage as he could. It was obvious, he’d loved Harry for a long time but the idiot was oblivious at the best of times. Harry took in a sharp intake of breath, before his face split into a wide grin.
“That’s good.” He finally added, he wasn’t sure how long it had taken him to reply, since he woke up he found his mind whirling with different things. It was funny how easily something pieced together when you took a step back and thought about it for a while.
Stood in front of him was Kingsley, Hermione, Lavender, Dean, Seamus and Wilson. Hermione moved forwards and sat down next to him, laying a hand on his knee. “We got Endelton, he’s bruised and battered but alive, everyone is fine,” she started, a small pained smile appeared on her lips. “Harry, Draco woke up.” she whispered.
“Didn’t he just request holiday last month?” asked Harry, frowning. His concentration was fixed to the crop circle, he barely heard Draco’s reply of “Yes, a week.” Harry then spun around fast his gaze snapping to Draco’s face. “Murder is murder, illegal potions are illegal.” he said slowly. Draco raised an eyebrow and smirked “Generally yes, fantastic thinking there, Potter.” he chuckled.
Harry looked at him for a moment, as though he was thinking about it before nodding slowly. He smiled at Draco and placed a hand on his forearm. “Thanks, that would be good.”
It was odd, although Draco didn’t actually have very many friends, he’d made rather an unexpected friend in Hermione Granger, completely by accident of course. By extension of that, he’d made friends with Weasley. Every Sunday, they’d arrange to meet in a random cafe and chat about nonsensical rubbish, but it gave Draco the little bit of human contact he actually needed. Or rather, he wished he didn’t need.
They entered the restaurant together, he glanced around the room quickly - eyes resting on the dark hair of Potter, he was early. “Malfoy, over here!” Potter bellowed, gesturing his hand wildly. Draco let out a huff and held his arm out for Louisa, who took it with a smile.
Looking up at Harry with teary eyes, Draco let out another shaky breath, tears began to pour down his pale cheeks, glistening in the harsh light of their office. Harry placed his free hand on Draco’s cheek. “You’re okay.” he whispered, nodding his head. He offered Draco a sad smile, he knew his partner was hurting.
He picked the folder up off the pile and opened the front page, furrowing his brow. For the last few months a symbol seemed to appear more and more often. It was a celtic cross with a snake through the middle, they still had no idea who this particular group of Dark Wizards were, they had so far found it burnt in to the wallpaper of a murder victims home, in a crop field which caused a stir with a few muggle farmers, who needed obliviated after they witnessed many robed Aurors in the middle of their field. They’d found bottles of maximum strength veritaserum in a disused warehouse stamped with such a mark. The connection was perplexing, he remembered his argument with Draco after they’d spent four hours staring at a board a picture of the crop circle, bottles and the wallpaper mark trying to connect the dots. There really was no connection between the three, but at the same time there was.
“Just so you know, it would be Malfoy-Potter.” he stated, before disapparating. A surprised look flitted across Harry’s features, before settling on a wicked smirk. “Malfoy-Potter huh?” he said to thin air, as he apparated to the Ministry. Once he’d gotten back to his department, he frowned. It was far too quiet, usually the ruckus was in full swing by this time, he looked around and spotted Endelton sitting at his desk quietly, Harry wandered over to him and perched himself on the edge of his desk. “Where is everyone?” His eyes travelled down to the parchment Endelton was filling out and bit his lip.
.” he said it as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, completely forgetting he couldn’t apparate or leave Louisa, or even apparate whilst drunk for that matter.
Harry nodded, chewing his bottom lip in thought. Hermione let out a sigh and looked up at the Healer. “I talked to Dean while I was in the Ministry, he said Malfoy was hit by a Stupefy.” her brows furrowed, she shook her head. “This is curse damage, there’s no way that was from a Stupefy.”
“Crucio!” an unidentified voice screamed, it was definitely male. “Stupefy!” Draco shouted, once Harry had spotted Draco, his head turned towards the attacker, donning full black robes and a hood that mostly covered his face, Harry cursed under his breath.
A pang of guilt hit him, here he was debating whether or not he could trust a friend he’d had for years now, and he didn’t think about how hard it must be to Blaise’s life. He shook his head in dismay, it truly was a complex situation.
His mobile phone pinged, he looked down at it and smiled. The reply came “Yeah, meet me at the usual bookstore at 6?” Draco quickly replied “See you there” and threw the mobile down on the empty passenger seat.
